The first summer after the last winter that refused to end, the rain in Epsom developed a memory. It carried chalk from the Downs and diluted secrets from the allotments, and left the town smelling like wet stone and nettle tea. Jake lived in the cottage he'd inherited from a grandmother who lit candles for saints but believed in the Force like it was a gust over fields— unseen, certain, and only occasionally spoken about. The cottage was tucked behind an aimless hedge and a gate that squealed like a gossip; the garden sprawled beyond it as if a whole forest had put on a disguise and crept in overnight.

He woke every morning to a bird tapping its reflection in the window glass, as though warning him: wake up, wake up, the day keeps changing when your back is turned. He'd stretch, spar his shadow with a wooden practice blade, lift the kettle with his hand and an invisible thought so that it almost hovered before he remembered not to, and then he'd set it down properly, the metal clinking against the hob as if nothing was odd.

Epsom was Epsom: the racecourse like a silver coin on the horizon, the green lanes where the dog walkers nodded and the joggers made a point of not hearing their feet, the charity shops that displayed an uncanny number of wooden puzzles and brandy glasses. Some days, Jake worked at the local library, cataloguing the town's paper memory; other times he took calls for a council conflict resolution service, the sort of work that made use of a calm voice and a way of noticing which way a conversation tilted. He was thirty and looked like someone who could carry a washing machine by himself or recite poetry in a pub; people trusted him even if they couldn't say why. They called him solid. His grandmother had called him bright. The old training droids had called him back to the center on every strike.

He'd been found as a child on the Downs, according to legend, sitting cross-legged in a circle of chalk as if waiting to be drawn on. This was a family story—an “our Jake always had a way” sort of story—more charm than testimony. He'd been trained privately, quietly, far from the high shrines and their politics. He had a mentor once who quoted the old codes but drank Earl Grey and called his students “ducks.” He learned to listen to the murmur inside things, to step aside instead of stepping into, to accept a life among ordinary people with extraordinary listening. He was not the type to carry a shining blade into traffic. He was the kind who would stand in a doorway and say no.

But the garden was a battlefield he could not win. Jade thickets had buckled the path. Brambles arched into martyrdom and took hostages. Poppies glared. The apple tree threw apples at the fence to get attention. Nettles had established a republic. He stood on the flagstones with a mug of tea and admitted defeat.

“Fine,” he said to the garden, which did not care. “Fine. All right. I'll get help.”

They put an advert up in the post office, between a missing parakeet and an organ teacher looking for pupils who knew their lefts from their rights. He wrote: gardener needed, not fussy, tea provided, danger pay negotiable. The reply came folded into a crisp brown envelope tucked under the gate latch, dampened slightly by the night's breath. The paper said, in a hand that looked like someone had learned to write on bark, I'll be there Tuesday if it's not raining. It will be. Tell the apple tree to behave. Rowan.

Tuesday came dry and bright and then admitted to a drizzle. There was a knock like a friendly argument on the door and there was the gardener—Rowan—boots muddied as if they'd walked through an older forest to get here, a canvas jacket patched at the elbows, eyes the grey of a sky that had forgotten it ever did blue, a grin with the wear on it of someone who used it regularly as a tool. He was taller than Jake by just enough to notice. He was carrying a spade that looked like a loyal dog.

“I'm late,” Rowan said. “Your hedge tried to eat me.”

“It does that,” Jake said. “I've told it to be nicer.”

“You could tell it again.” Rowan leaned against the doorframe. The way he leaned made the house want to lean back. “I'm Rowan. Hale. Rowan Hale.”

“Jake,” he said, forgetting his surname for a second because there were people who had a gravity field and Rowan was one. “Kavanagh. Tea?”

Rowan glanced over Jake's shoulder into the hallway, the stacked books, the photographs of people standing in gardens, the tick of the hallway clock like a small animal with a stick. “Always,” he said. “Then we see what your wild kingdom requires.”

They drank tea at the kitchen table, hands curled around mugs, steam caught in the brass light of morning. Jake tried to pour milk and nearly did it without touching the jug. He caught himself. The jug paused in the air, then clinked down, maybe a trick of the light, maybe a twitch of the wrist.

Rowan watched his hands as if they were a performance. “You've got neat tricks,” he said.

“I've got a kettle that boils when I ask nicely,” Jake said, with more truth in the joke than he intended. He had learned to blur the edges of what he could do, wrap it in laughter and tea and a dull cardigan.

Rowan's grin flicked and gentled into something like interest. The storm grey of his eyes went softer. “Good,” he said. “I hate men who can't boil water.”

They went out into the garden, into the patient catastrophe of it. Rowan investigated like a detective called to an eccentric crime scene.

“Someone's been feeding the ivy,” he said, suspiciously. “And the ivy reports directly to a megalomaniac fern. And what is this?” He kneeling to inspect a clump of something that looked like it had ideas above its station.

“A wildflower mix I threw down in a mood,” Jake admitted.

Rowan lifted the spade with a flourish. “We'll triage,” he said. “We will be fair to all parties. We will be merciful, to a point. Also, we'll find out which of these plants are squatters and evict them.”

Jake watched him work. There were people the Force liked more than others—not because of blessing or destiny, but because they moved in ways that fit the world's pulse. Rowan had that. He dug with a rhythm that suited the soil, paused and put his ear to the ground, as if the garden might tell him where it hurt. His hair, brown with a hint of copper when the sun's single daring finger came through the clouds, was tied back not neatly. He caught his breath now and then with a slight sound that reminded Jake of the little cough birds make when they settle in hedges. He made jokes with his shoelaces untied. He said things like, “When a fox marks your garden, it's just an invoice,” and then asked if Jake had any biscuits because fighting ivy required glucose.

By lunchtime Rowan had found a path that the garden had hidden under moss and defiance; he had declared truce with the nettles, who were allowed to keep a corner in exchange for not launching raids; he had spoken sternly to the apple tree, which had dropped a wormy fruit in protest. They ate sandwiches sitting on the back step, brown bread with crisp lettuce, which Rowan looked at with theatrical suspicion.

“Far too healthy,” he said. “I'll forgive you if there's cake later.”

“There’s a bakery on the High Street,” Jake said. “People pilgrimage.”

“Then we will pilgrim.”

“You're from here?” Jake asked.

“From here and not from here,” Rowan said. “Born in Crawley, grew up wherever the van would get to. My mum thought home was a place you packed. We ended up in Epsom because the van's brakes fell off on East Street. It seemed like a sign.” He chewed, slow. “You're very from here.”

“Grandmother's garden,” Jake said. “Grandmother's ghosts. I never learned how to leave.”

“Maybe you didn't have to,” Rowan said. “Some places sit on you and keep you safe.”

He looked up at the sullen clouds. He lifted his hand, palm up, and the first rain found it, a single fat drop. “Time to call it?” he said. “Or do we work in the wet and pretend to be heroes, and then get colds?”

“Tea,” Jake said, because tea was the national therapy and also because he wanted to keep Rowan in the kitchen where the house was warmer, where Rowan's presence felt like a new color on the old walls. They went inside. The kettle listened and steamed. The radio murmured something about a traffic delay near Leatherhead and then forgot to finish the story.

Rowan turned an old photo face up on the sill, the two people in it standing at the fence of a field with a sky behind them like a promise. “Your grandparents?”

“Her and the man she married before the war,” Jake said. “He died young. She was very young. When she looked at me it was like she was counting backwards to that field.”

Rowan put the picture down gently. “Fields keep the same shape long after people change,” he murmured. “I have a map of all the fields I've worked in. Not a real map. More like—a lot of memories wearing boots.”

“Do you mark them?” Jake asked, then worried how that sounded, but Rowan smiled again.

“On my skin, sometimes,” he said. He tugged his jacket down and showed the edge of a small ink line on his wrist, a thin stalk with a seedhead—timothy grass—or a falling star, depending how you looked. The line was delicate, clever enough to look like a mistake until it wasn't. “Just a guide. Just a note to myself. Don't trust memory alone.”

Jake felt something move in him, a slight cold wind from another room. He'd dreamt of a mark once. In the dream someone put their hand out and their palm was a window to someplace dangerous. He shook it off so easily he thought he had.

After Rowan went at five, with a promise to bring cake next time if Jake provided the plate, the house went quiet in the way houses do when you realise you were warmed by someone's presence more than the kettle. The garden, chastened, lay under a damp evening with its new edges and its old secrets. Jake stood on the threshold and felt the air shift around him, as if the day was closing like a book.

When the ripple began, he almost missed it. He was used to small out-of-step moments: a song he didn't know, sitting in his head like he'd known it forever; a street where the lampposts were just slightly closer than the day before; the kettle finishing a second before he put it on. He'd always had that sense that time wasn't so much a road as a braided river. He chose his steps. He listened for the shallow parts. But that evening the ripple had a face to it—Rowan’s face—but altered, the eyes not grey but black, the skin paler, the laugh thinner. A vision, perhaps. Or the garden's gossip.

He closed his eyes and saw a narrow shop on a corner he'd never noticed, its window painted a dull matte black, the door hung with bells that weren't bells but bits of chain. He saw Rowan's hand pressed against glass, a cardboard sign that read walk-ins welcome in a font that tried too hard. He saw a drawing pinned up—a sigil or a map—something that looked like an animal with its head on backwards, drawn in clean lines like a blessing or a curse. His stomach turned. He opened his eyes. It was just the apple tree crooking its black fingers against a sky that had decided on purple for the evening.

He went to bed and dreamed of chalk. He dreamed of a well on the Downs where people threw pennies and wishes and his grandmother stood over it with a broom, sweeping the mist into neat piles. He dreamed of Rowan in a field of rye, laughing, then walking away, the stalks brushing his back, bird wings cracking the air, and then the rye turning to ink, rising up his arms like night fallen too fast. He woke with his mouth saying no.

They worked together through June, the afternoons stretching like cats. Rowan taught him the specific swear words you reserve for bindweed, the patience required to wait for a wren to finish a song before you reach for the watering can. He showed him how to cut lavender and hang it with its dignity intact; how not to apologise when a slug is what it is; that a garden, like a person, grows the story you tell it about itself. Jake taught Rowan, in small demonstrations, how stillness could be a tool; that sometimes the apple chose you back if you asked; that there is a way to hold your breath that makes you better at listening to the dirt.

On the seventh day he repaired the back door lock without touching it. He told himself the screwdriver had fit easily. Rowan watched him not do it.

“There's a line,” Rowan said, later, over cakes from the place with the window full of overconfident eclairs. “A line in people, you know? Between what they say they are and what they are when they forget to talk. You have a line like that. It's a nice line. It glows.”

“That's a kind thing to say.”

“It's honest.” Rowan shrugged. “Some folks are full of holes you can't see. You feel like... like a river rock with sun on it.”

Jake did not know what to do with this kind of looking. He changed the subject clumsily by telling a story about a man at the library who had memorised the Dewey Decimal system but still returned books late. Rowan came closer to him while he laughed. The closeness was a kind of sweet pain. Jake felt the day turn new and particular, each minute attached to the next by a thin live wire.

They didn't kiss. Not then. A kind comprehension grew between them, rooted in the way they were easy together. Rowan would put his hand on the back of Jake's neck when he leaned over the compost and Jake would feel taller for it. He would go into town on errands and bring back accidental things: a ribbon for tying the rosemary back, even though rosemary has no patience for ribbons; a postcard with a horse on it, because he couldn't resist the eyes; a lemon, because the kitchen seemed to want a lemon. They walked to the Downs on a Saturday, carrying a thermos and a bag of crisps because training cannot make you elegant all the time. They lay on a patch of scrub, the wind tracing their faces, while gliders stitched the wide sky. Epsom Downs are a fabric you recognise by touch.

“Why do you stay?” Rowan asked, the voice of someone who had once been very good at leaving. “In this town. In this house.”

“Because it's home,” Jake said. “Because there are things I promised to watch. Because my grandmother asked me, when she was dying, to make sure the house didn't go quiet. She said quiet isn't nothing. It's a thing that grows if you're not careful.”

Rowan nodded. He rolled onto his side. His knuckles brushed Jake's shirt on purpose. “I don't have anyone who ever asked me to stay,” he said. “But I'm getting better at it. Staying put. Not because of heavy reasons. Because of light ones.”

They did kiss, later, under the apple tree that had decided to stop sulking and blossom again. It was a kiss like a door opening to a room you thought was a cupboard and finding it's a garden; it was slow, honest, and with a sense of humour. Afterwards, they stood with their foreheads touching, the rain beginning to prick them both.

“This,” Rowan said, like he had found a word he'd been missing.

“I know,” Jake said. The Force had a way of naming things inside him; it hummed now, a sympathetic note to his heart.

When the corner shop arrived, it did so as if it had always been there. Jake walked into town to return a book and realised there was a narrow alley where there hadn't been; at the end of it, a door painted green with oil that hadn't finished drying. The sign above said Ink & Bone. The windows were shaded. A small bell hung on a chain. The alley smelled like rain that had been held in someone's hand for too long.

He paused. The hairs on his arms stood up—this was a thing that had slipped into their town without asking permission. He touched the door, gently, and the bell did not ring. The Force moved against his fingers like a cat that didn't want to be made a fuss of.

Back at the cottage, Rowan was kneeling by the raised beds, fitting a small square net over the strawberries. He had a smear of soil on his temple and the sun, surprising everyone, had made his skin warmer.

“There's a new place in town,” Jake said, pouring water. “One of those tattoo shops that try to be temples.”

Rowan smiled without looking up. “I like tattoos,” he said. “People making maps. Owning their surfaces. Turning into the thing they carry.”

“This one felt... different,” Jake said. “Like the kind of different that's a storm three days away over the sea.”

Rowan stood and wiped his hands on his trousers. “Maybe they do seafaring ships,” he said with a grin. “Sailors and swallows. Hearts with daggers. 'Mum' in a ribbon, but in Latin.”

“You’d have 'Mum' in Latin?”

“Mater,” Rowan said gravely. “Or 'Don't clip the hedges after rain' in Sanskrit. Something wise.”

Jake wanted to say, don't go there. He didn't know why he wanted to say it. He didn't want to be the kind of person who told someone not to get a tattoo. He wanted to be the kind of person who let rain fall where it needed to and trusted that the ground would drink it and no one would drown you see. He had the feeling, suddenly, that the garden had gone quiet to hear him think. Rowan was looking at his face with that attention he had, patient as a plant listening for the underground river.

“You got that look you get,” Rowan murmured. “Like you've read the last page before the middle.”

“Sometimes I see things,” Jake said, not looking at him. “Sometimes they're nothing. Sometimes they're—” He made a hand gesture like he could push the dark aside.

“Tell me anyway.”

“A shop that's like a trap,” Jake said. “A mark that looks wrong on you. Not wrong because you shouldn't have marks. Wrong because it wants to change you into something you’re not.”

Rowan came close enough to touch. He didn't, not yet. “Okay,” he said. “Good to know. I'll keep my ears on, then.” He smiled. “I'm not easily trapped. I grew up learning to get out of things.”

“I know,” Jake said. He did. He knew the way Rowan didn't agree to gravity unless it asked nicely.

The thing about forewarnings is that they're rarely precise. Time hates to be pinned down. It flaps. It sulks. It changes its mind and insists it never had one. Days went by and the new shop was just a new shop where people went in with pale arms and came out with bandages and secret swollen pride. Rowan made no appointment. He cut the hedge. He found a bird's nest and watched from a respectful distance as eggs turned into open beaks. He bought more biscuits than strictly necessary and taught Jake to dunk with an artist’s restraint. He fell asleep on the sofa one afternoon, his mouth open slightly, as if asleep was just talking with your lips less. Jake watched him, and the simple fact of watching was the kind of joy that didn't need names. The radio said thunderstorms were due in three days. It said it until it believed it.

On a Thursday evening, when the rain arrived all at once and punched the roof like it was bored, Rowan ran into the kitchen dripping, his jacket pasted to him, his hair all points.

“I got an invite,” he said, panting, pushing his wet fringe back. “Not like a formal thing. The woman at the new shop. I stopped to look and she looked back at me and she said, 'We're doing a thing tonight. After hours. Artists talking about ink.' It felt rude to say no.”

Jake put a towel around his shoulders that was also an embrace. “You don't owe them your skin,” he said.

“I know,” Rowan said. He held on to Jake's wrists, warm through the towel. “But I like thought. I like people talking about marks. It's—it's like gardens, a little bit. The decision to make. The responsible and the wild parts both wanting.”

“I'll come with you,” Jake said, surprising himself. He hadn't planned it until he said it. But there it was, between them, that line, bright. “I'll stand at the back and be uncharming.”

“Impossible,” Rowan said, and the word made his mouth a little uneven in a way Jake wanted to fix with his thumb. He leaned in. They kissed again, briefly, laughter and lightning reflected in the window.

The shop smelled of ink and holy water and rain brought in by people's coats. The woman who greeted them wore a black dress that might have been a robe if you looked at it too long. She had lines around her eyes drawn by someone else’s sadness and fingers stained the permanent blue of people who keep pens in their pockets. Behind her were framed designs—birds and bones and branches, maps with no roads, animals that were more a suggestion than a lesson.

“Welcome,” she said. “Look around. See what catches and what leaves you alone.”

People murmured. There were bowls of crisps like offerings. There was a man with a tattoo of a fox on the back of his hand that made his thumb look like a tail. There were candles which probably weren't real but fooled enough of the room to steady it. Rowan moved through the space with a polite kind of interest. When he looked at certain designs, his face changed: one of joy at a small fern done in green so subtle it was a secret; one of respect at a fine-lined wolf; one of a complicated feeling when he faced the back wall where a single image hung alone, a thing that might have been a knot or a face, some old script that would not translate for free.

Jake stood very still. The Force thickened in the room like air gone heavy before a storm. He listened for the sound of a trap—the click of something closing, the breath that comes when people get what they didn't know they wished for and can't get back. The woman in black—her presence prickled him, not wrong exactly, but insistent.

She joined Rowan by the wall. “This one,” she said. “This one is not for everyone.”

“What is it?” Rowan asked. He didn't reach out. He had a discipline in him that looked like rebellion, but wasn't.

She tilted her head. “Lots of things are lots of things,” she said, which was a skillful way of not answering. “But if you wear it, you don't wear anything by mistake ever again.” She turned slightly and her look slid to Jake, cool as a blade kept under the floorboards. “You'd like that for him,” she said, oddly. “You'd like him to be a person without accidental worlds attached to his hands.”

Rowan frowned, turned to see who she spoke about. He watched Jake watch him. The rain knuckled the window like a drunk trying to be polite. Somewhere in the back a machine buzzed, then stopped. A man laughed; the laugh didn't believe itself.

“I don't want marks that don't say my name,” Rowan said. “Not in any language.”

“And you won't get any without asking,” the woman said. “We’re not that kind of shop.” And then she smiled a little, because she knew secrets were the kind of advice that acted like a dare.

Jake went closer. The image on the wall wasn't a sigil he'd learned; it wasn't a chalk line on a hillside that meant this or that. It shifted slightly as his focus slipped. He didn't like it. He didn't like the way it tried to convince you that it knew you already and only needed to correct your misunderstandings. He stood between Rowan and the picture without deciding to.

The woman lifted her hand like someone offering a bird. “No harm,” she said, perhaps to stop something happening. It worked. Or appeared to.

“Let's go,” Jake said to Rowan. The words were soft and firm and stepped in front of other words. He didn't want to be the kind of person who moved someone with a look. He wanted to be the kind of person who said, gently, please. Rowan's eyes flicked, amused and fond, to his mouth, to the way it set when he was bracing the future.

“All right,” Rowan said. “We've seen what we needed to see.” He thanked the woman for the talk they hadn't had. He thanked the fox on the man's hand for existing. He put on his jacket and let Jake open the door. The bell made a chain-sound that was not a bell and the room let them go like a breath finally released.

On the pavement, the rain had paused to think about what it was doing. The streetlights wore halos. The air was metallic, the way air is when it has learned its own lesson.

“I won't go,” Rowan said. “If that's what you need me to say.”

“I won't ask that,” Jake said. “I don't own your decisions. But I will say: I saw something. And I am—” He almost said scared. He changed it to careful. “I am careful. Because sometimes a mark is only ink. And sometimes it invites something in. Or locks something out.”

Rowan took his hands and, right there in the soft glow of an ordinary town, he held them as if he were measuring them for gloves. “I hear you,” he said. “I've spent so long going without anchors. I'm not in a hurry to get a new one. But sometimes I think—if I marked myself, if I put my own word on myself—maybe I'd be my own anchor, and not get dragged when the tide runs weird.”

“What's your word?” Jake asked.

“Still deciding,” Rowan said. He smiled and his face was suddenly too dear to look at straight on. “Maybe it’s you.”

They walked the long way home. The Downs lay dark and breathing to their left. The rain started again and then the moon won a brief small battle with the clouds and made everything silver. They didn't speak. They didn't need to practice not speaking. They moved together like two people who would, given half a chance, put their beds in the same place and not talk through every night.

The house smelled of mint and wet dog even though they had no dog. Jake made more tea; Rowan dripped onto the doormat and then onto the kitchen flags. They set their wet shoes by the radiator. It was the ordinary, and the ordinary had saved lives before. It could save them too. That was the story they let sit around the mugs.

“Will you tell me,” Rowan said, after a while when the sound of rain had settled into a long-term project, “about you? The bit of you that's not in books. The bits that move cups when you're not thinking.”

Jake could have said no. He did not often tell. He made sets of explanations that were adequate for people who loved him; he used metaphors and cartoons. But the day had pushed him hard enough that honesty felt like a relief, like taking off tight shoes.

“I was taught to listen to the Force,” he said. “Or maybe it was always teaching me. And there were people who knew names for things, and people who didn't. I learned some names. I learned some silences. And I learned I could move through time a little—not like a magician with a watch, but like a man who knows where the river crosses are when it's in flood.”

Rowan's eyes widened and then softened. “Can you go back?”

“Sometimes,” Jake said. “Sometimes I can walk backwards through the room and not knock anything over. Sometimes I can adjust the knob on the radio and get a station that's from yesterday. Sometimes I can step off the path before the thorn goes through my foot. It isn't dramatic. It isn't—" He made a face. “It isn't what stories make it. It's ordinary, mostly. And I'm cautious. Because the garden doesn't like it when you dig where the roots don't want you to.”

Rowan reached across the table and held his wrist where the pulse beat, softly, as if counting for himself. “You won't do it for small things,” he said.

“I try not to do it at all,” Jake said. “The time it likes me is when I let it be. It huffs. It forgives me. I forgive it. We try not to start arguments with each other. But sometimes—” He hesitated. “Sometimes I get scared of what I can feel coming.”

“Is there something coming?” Rowan asked. The question wasn't panic. It was the kind you ask when someone you love knows which clouds will break and which are just putting on a show.

“There always is,” Jake said. “That's the boring answer. The other answer is—there's a tug. Like a string tied to a doorknob and someone's walking away with it. I can feel it at my wrist. Maybe it's just the way rain makes everything heavy.”

Rowan let his fingers slip from Jake’s wrist to his palm and they sat like that, hands held, both of them staring at the window where their own reflections watched them, two men with wet hair and a kitchen behind them and all their ghosts off duty for once. The clock in the hall asserted itself. The radio hummed and then was quiet. The night happened.

In the morning, the alley with Ink & Bone was gone. In its place was the pale brick wall of a solicitors' office that had been there since 1987 and always would be. Rowan said nothing about it, and Jake said nothing about it, and the town did that thing towns do where they absorb a past that no longer fits and forget the parts that would make telling the story hard.

Days settled into a new capacity. The quiet in the house changed texture; it was no longer the scary kind. Rowan brought a basil plant into the kitchen and sang to it like a fool. Jake showed him how to listen for foxes moving in the hedge. They bought a cheap secondhand bench and carried it home; people smiled at them like they had a right to be in the street together. Jake woke in the night and found Rowan's shoulder in the dark with his hand, just to check it was there. The days moved like good bread rising on a shelf.

Then a letter came. Not a brown envelope this time, but cream, thick, heavy like a problem. It was for Rowan, and Rowan read it with his hand on the table and his mouth set. He put it down. He looked up.

“My father,” he said, a word he didn't say often. “He's... he's in hospital. He fell. They say he's fine. He isn't fine. He won't want me there and I'm going anyway. He's in Brighton. I have to go—today.”

Jake packed a bag in five minutes and only after did he think to ask if he was invited.

“Of course,” Rowan said. “I don't want to go alone.” His gratitude was the kind that moved through his eye like a fish. “I need you to tell me when I say the wrong things and to tell me when not to leave.”

They took the train through rain-wet places with names that sounded like they had been invented by someone who loved saying them, and then Brighton opened up like a glittering wound. The hospital smelled like the kind of cleaning that has to overcome the smell of fear. Rowan's father was a tall man who had not wanted a son. He had a face too handsome to be kind to. He had a tattoo, faint with the years, of a wire fence around his heart.

They sat in a corridor under a clock that refused to be on the hour. Rowan's father woke and slept and woke and refused the food. He said, “You still playing in the dirt?” and Rowan said, “Yes,” and Jake held his hand under the chair where no one could see and pressed a thumb into the place where his fear came to surface, the joint, and thought of bridges. It was not the time for miracles.

They stayed the night in a boarding house with wallpaper that had seen sailors. The sea breathed like a giant animal below them, exhaling stories. Rowan lay on his side and Jake formed his body to him like a tide around a stone. Rowan didn't sleep. Jake did, briefly; in those minutes he dreamed of a needle and a whisper and a word in a language only the skin knows.

In the morning, Rowan's father was discharged with a prescription and a warning. He told Rowan to stop being a nuisance. He told him nothing else. Rowan, being good, let it pass through him the way a wave passes through a fence—distorted, yes, but not ruined. They stood on the shingle and watched the gulls heckle the sea.

“Something's going to happen,” Rowan said.

“Yes,” Jake said.

“I won't be easy to stop. Not because I'm stubborn, though I am. Because when something wants me, it often gets me.”

“You told me you'd listen when I said no.”

“And I will,” Rowan said, honest as a spade. He kissed Jake and the salt got in their mouths. “But I might hear something you don't.”

They went back to Epsom and the cottage and the basil plant now sulking. They put their bags down in the hall and the house breathed out. They slept, the kind of sleep that has its arms around you. In the morning, the letter was still on the table, and the rain had moved on, and the sky had a patch of indifference.

Before lunch, Rowan said, “I'm going into town.” He said it like an apology and a proclamation and a test.

“Which part?” Jake asked, though he knew. He always knew the shape of a thing before it put its clothes on.

“The part where I decide my name on my own skin,” Rowan said. He kissed Jake’s temple. “Come with me if you want to stop me. Or if you want to let me.”

There was, in the space after he left the room, a tightness like a knot tied in an old string. The house's quiet changed back to something that wanted to grow. A bird hit the window and flew away, embarrassed. The Force stood up in him like a friend who has been patient too long.

He went to the doorway. He stood on the step. He put his hand out as if to feel which way the river ran.

“Wait,” he said to no one. To the air. To the day. To Rowan already halfway down the path, his shoulders set, the hedge trying to eat his jacket one last time and failing because love is a knife sometimes and sometimes it is a hand.

“Wait,” he said again, and time went slippery under his feet. The apple tree held its breath. Somewhere in town a bell made a chain-sound that decided a room. He could still reach him if he ran. He could. Or he could stand here and let the world choose and tidy up later.

He took a step, then another, then the next one forgot itself and he was in the path and the hedge was laughing at his knees. He called Rowan’s name, and when the man turned, his face was already set to yes. He was carrying that softness with him like armour.

“Let's go together,” Jake said. “If you do it, I'm there. If you don't, I'm there. I'm there.”

And Rowan, that simplest and most complicated of men, held out his hand and the air between them changed, the way it always did when you reached for the one thing you weren’t supposed to be able to hold. The afternoon opened to them like a corridor they could walk down or run or fall or fly. They chose to walk, for now, because walking was still theirs. Outside the clouds had pulled themselves thin and each thread of light had to work hard to make a day out of it. They went into town with their shoulders almost touching.

Behind them, the garden watched as all gardens watch, but not unkindly. It knew something about cuts that turn into paths. It knew something about marks that grow into truth. It knew something, too, about how many ways there are to say wait and mean will you come back. It knew more than it let on, the way old places do.Chapter Three

They walked as if the town had stretched itself a little to let them through, as if pavements can be persuaded by certain alignments of shoulders. The sky had given up on the possibility of drama and gone the colour of a pencil eraser, and the smell in the air was washing; everyone’s hedges were gently damp and minded their manners. Rowan talked about a robin he had found sleeping in a coil of hose like someone choosing the wrong sofa because it matched their jumper. Jake listened and watched the way Rowan used his hands to measure out the heft of small stories, as if language had weight and needed a scale. Occasionally they bumped elbows and pretended they hadn’t, the way people do when they are newly trying on the shape of a pair.

Epsom was very sure of itself that afternoon. The charity shops had achieved a new equilibrium of faded board games and silver-plated fish knives. The newsagent displayed a rack of postcards that tried earnestly to sell the concept of the racecourse to people who had never seen a horse. A woman pushed a pram as if she were steering a ship into harbour and a whippet trotted past, apologising for being awake. Jake loved the town with the fierce, undemonstrative affection reserved for things you have had to repair yourself. He loved the way you could be a person with a secret in Epsom and the town would agree to carry it for you if you kept an eye on the bins.

They cut down a side street where the road narrowed and made a point of bullying the cars into single file. Jake’s mouth had gone dry in anticipation of a door that might not exist. He had not told Rowan about the way the alley needed certain weather, certain angles of the chin, certain agreements with chance. Ever since he was a boy he had understood that some places only turned their faces to you if you looked at them with the respect you’d give an old dog who bites.

“Which way?” Rowan asked, not to tease but to let Jake choose the seam to open.

“Two lefts, then one right, then stop before the paving slab with the chip in it,” Jake said, and Rowan narrowed his eyes and looked down like a man about to try stepping-stones in a fast stream.

The alley had not been there yesterday, and so it was obviously there now. It did not announce itself; it pretended to be a gap where two buildings had forgotten to touch. The green door was duller than before, as if it had absorbed rainfall and certain looks and become a darker version of itself. The chain-bell hung, metal with a memory. The little sign in the window said appointment only in letters that wanted to be taller, but you could feel the lie in it. There was always a back door to a rule if the rule had been written by a person.

Rowan exhaled deliberately and looked at Jake. “If you say turn around, I’ll turn around,” he said. His voice did not creak with virtue. He simply offered the hinge.

“If I say turn around, you’ll think about this alley in the bath and in the queue for stamps and in the middle of sentences,” Jake said. “And you’ll come back on a day I can’t see you and I will be washing the mugs wondering why the quiet got teeth again. So we go in and we make sure the room is the sort of room that can watch us leave.”

Rowan grinned with one side of his mouth, the way he did when pleased by courage. “On we go,” he said, and brushed his knuckles against Jake’s as if the act of not holding hands in a small public moment was its own small intimacy.

The bell made its chain-sound and the smell of alcohol cleaned the old dust out of their noses. The room was not quite the same, which is how you know a place is more alive than brick. The candles were more obviously false; the crisp bowls had been replaced with a plate of biscuits that were good in a way that horror films make good biscuits look evil. The woman in black wore a cardigan, as if this was a day she was pretending to be less than she was. Her eyes were the same—tired by strangers and tender with some unconfessed kindness.

“You came back,” she said, and then, to Rowan, not unkindly, “Or forward.”

“Back and forward are often an argument,” Rowan said. “I’d prefer to go sideways. Is there tea?”

Her mouth smiled without telling her eyes. “A sacrilege in a studio,” she said. “But there’s a kettle in the back for sins and biscuits for confession. I’m Maris.”

Jake said her name in his head and it settled there in the way that true things take up a manageable space. The place behind the curtain hummed with a sound like a bee if it were a square. He let the Force find its own edges and he did not tug on it, the way you don’t pull a thread in a jumper unless you want to be cold.

Maris waved them towards a table that offered portfolios like albums of plausible futures. “Look,” she said. “Then talk. Most people come in with the wrong sentence and go out with a smaller, truer one. It’s a service industry, even if we use needles instead of napkins.”

Rowan took the chair that would not trap him. He turned the pages and the room’s air adjusted to the concentration of someone who is actually seeking. He paused at a drawing of a wren done with such pride that you could hear the tiny machine-gun of its song. He paused at a fishbone, clean as a cathedral. He paused at a knot that would keep a boat in weather. He did not stop at the sigil on the wall, because it wasn’t on the wall. The space it had occupied felt like a chair that someone still warm had just vacated.

“It’s not hanging,” Jake said, not because he meant to say it out loud, but because sometimes your days decide to use your mouth.

Maris lifted a shoulder. “We take it down when the room has had too much of it,” she said. “Rooms get full.”

“What was it?” Rowan asked. His tone was respectful the way you are when asking the name of a dog that might bite.

Maris set a cup on a saucer so quietly the absence of clink made a small point. “It was a map,” she said. “Some maps take you one way however you hold them. We made it in a season when people seemed to want one road and we thought perhaps we could be useful. It did some harm, probably, and some good, possibly. We are not keeping it on the wall until we’re sure we have better questions.”

Rowan sat back and looked at her in the way he looked at brambles—kindly, but with an intention to separate out what was choking what. “I don’t want a map that folds me,” he said. “I want a note to self I can still read when I’m tired.”

“Good,” Maris said. She had the air of a teacher who had heard a correct answer in a language she did not teach. “Show me your skin.”

Rowan laughed and held his wrist up with its delicate timothy grass. The stalk lay along his pulse like a stretched cat. “I want something that sits beside this without pretending to have been there all along,” he said. “Something that doesn’t make the first one a prologue.”

Maris bent over the small line and did not touch it, as if proximity were a ceremony. “You have lawn on your arm,” she murmured. “Not lawn like the sort that thinks it’s a carpet. Lawn like the word’s other selves: linen thin enough to see through, tenderness cut sharp to hold its shape, and the sort of ground you can roll on without apologising later. What else are you keeping?”

“Rowan, sprig,” he said, and for the first time since Jake had known him he sounded self-conscious about his name, as if it were a shirt that had always fit and suddenly felt loud. “People have teased me with amulets since infants’ school. Tie red thread around your wrist because witches, take a leaf to the exam because luck, get a talisman because you need more than you. I’d like a sprig because I am the tree, sometimes, but I also stand under it.”

Maris nodded. “Branch or berries?” she asked. “Leaves or the star caught in the berry calyx who thinks no one notices him?”

“Leaves,” Rowan said, and then looked at Jake because this, somehow, needed to be a two-person decision. “Not because I don’t want the star. Because I think I have enough stars on me and they made me untidy.”

Jake kept his seat because he had learned not to act at the speed of fear. He looked at Rowan’s wrist and thought about the first day in the kitchen when the jug had hung in the air like a secret and Rowan had decided it was a very good joke. “One leaflet,” he said. “Two, perhaps. Not a whole twig. And a vein drawn so spare it looks like breath.”

Maris looked between them and softened, not in the way of someone reassured of a sale, but the way people do when reminded by strangers that love can be ordinary and thus exceeding strange. “We can do that,” she said. “Black ink, celebrant thin, with a suggestion of green if light falls a certain way. It will heal like it grew there. It will behave when you sweat. It will not try to be a sermon.”

“And the bit on the wall?” Rowan asked, too alert not to check where the teeth were. “It won’t jump?”

Maris pursed her mouth and for the first time looked older than herself. “Not if we decide it doesn’t,” she said, which was both true and insufficient, which was most of how the world worked.

While she drew, Rowan held his breath like someone balancing a glass of water on his chest. He did not stop being himself, but he gathered himself up so his edges were not in the way. He looked at Jake and it was the sort of look that made a room a tent and a tent a house. Jake allowed himself the luxury of looking back with all his noticing turned up. He had learned to dim it for the comfort of others; there was no comfort in dimming here.

The design on paper was hardly anything. Two leaves, one slightly behind the other, the topmost with a stem that seemed to be listening. The line broke where his pulse would be, a suggestion that all ink should compromise with blood. Rowan nodded, the way he nods at a plant he has decided to unpack from its pot and give a better life.

The making itself was a ceremony disguised as procedure. Maris put on gloves the colour of hospitals and adjusted the machine so that its song was not a buzz but a disciplined purr. She cleaned Rowan’s wrist as if she were telling a story to a baby and only the vowels mattered. The first touch of the needle made a sound in Jake’s mouth that didn’t leave. It wasn’t pain that struck him; it was the fact of choice made visible, the aah of a thin road being laid across skin where the mapmaker has promised never to claim right of way.

Rowan breathed out through his nose and went to the place inside himself where he counted birds at dusk. He did not look away and he did not try to look more brave than he was. Jake put his hand on the back of Rowan’s neck as if he were steadying a fencepost, light and certain and not at all an owner. The Force hummed, but it was not the loud hum of imminent wrongness; it was the low thrum of a machine that had finally been oiled. He could feel in the room a second room where something watched and shrugged and wandered off, bored by how little hurry there was here.

Maris worked like a gardener who believes in thinning seedlings. She gave small pauses to allow breath to be attended to. Rowan told a story about a woman who had kept a lemon tree alive through an entire winter above a pub that never closed its windows and how the fruit had come small and bitter and perfect and how she had cried when she cut it and he had told her that bitterness is most of the point. Jake had to swallow a laugh because if you had asked him to define Rowan he could have said that story and it would have been enough.

When it was done, Maris wiped the ink away and the small leaves lay on Rowan’s wrist as if they had not been made but discovered. The line at the stem did not touch the grass-stalk; they attended to each other over a careful gap. Jake exhaled as if he had been holding his breath for a week. Rowan flexed his hand and watched the leaves animate with tendon.

“It looks like a mistake no one will admit to,” Rowan said, delighted. “Which means it’s right.”

“We sell cling film and lies about aftercare,” Maris said, but her tone turned fond. “Wash it like a thing you rescued. No soaking; you’re not tea. When it itches, do nothing and think of all the times you did nothing when doing something would have broken what you were making. Come back if it bites you. Don’t come back if it bites you and you liked it.”

Rowan hopped off the chair and let the blood return to his fingers. He reached into his pocket for money and Maris pushed it back, not dramatically, but the gesture had the weight of a small, serious spell. “First one for that grass was mine,” she said. “This one is an apology for something other people put on our wall and then put in your head.”

Rowan looked like someone offered a gift that matched a hole he hadn’t confessed. “Then I’ll leave something else,” he said, and fished out the slice of hazelnut loaf he had wrapped in greaseproof and forgotten to eat on the way. “For afterwards,” he added. “Because I know this is a place with biscuits that don’t forgive. And because you made something delicate without making me delicate.”

Maris laughed, and it was an honest laugh that started in her shoes and had never been paid to attend a room. She took the cake and put it on the shelf as if it were saint bread. “Leave your name,” she said, and pushed a battered ledger at him, its pages full of loops and brags. He wrote Rowan in the way he always wrote his name—legible, tidy, as if generosity could be made into a handwriting. He hesitated and then added Hale under it, because sometimes you need a second word to feel like a whole one.

Jake did not sign anything. He stood and watched the corners of the room for the place where the map in his dream had tried to make his skin a door. He felt it glance off him the way rain hits a window and decides you are not the right size. He felt time tug at his sleeve and for once he tugged back, gently, and time grumbled and agreed to walk at his speed until they reached the end of the street.

They left with their hands not touching because both of them wanted to but both of them wanted to enjoy the wanting for a few steps more. The alley, which had a sense of humour, released them back into Epsom as if it had decided they were boring and therefore unprofitable. The air out here tasted different; it had less of yesterday in it.

“Let me see,” Jake said, as soon as they were committed to the ordinary light of the High Street. Rowan peeled back the cling film and held his wrist up like a small offering. The leaves were so spare that his eyes had to work to see them, which is always good. The vein was a whisper. The gap was the sentence. People passed them with carrier bags and lives that had nothing to do with this. Jake felt foolish with relief.

“It feels like standing on one foot,” Rowan said. “Like the bit of me that reaches wants to lift the rest too. It tingles the way weather happens.”

“It suits you,” Jake said. “Not because rowan trees on Rowan is cute, though it is, and I reserve the right to be cute about you forever. Because it is a decision you will remember making when you’re eighty and intolerable.”

Rowan curled his fingers and the leaf moved minutely, a bird flick. “I am already intolerable,” he said. “That’s one of my strengths.” He glanced sideways. “You stood in the room like you were holding the door open and like you would close it if the wind tried to blow it. Thank you.”

“I am a man of thresholds,” Jake said, and made it a joke because the other thing was to say: I cannot always save anyone, but I can sometimes help the shape of our going. He swallowed his wish to explain. The day did not want an explanation; it wanted cake.

They went to the bakery whose window was a spectacle of pastry theatre and bought two custard tarts so slick on top that they reflected the ceiling. The woman behind the counter congratulated Rowan as if he had had a baby. They took their paper bag to the little square by the railings where old men argued with squirrels and teenagers pretended not to have faces and sat on a bench that had been dedicated to someone who had loved dogs and they ate and let sugar solve a few insoluble problems.

“Tell me your word,” Rowan said suddenly, licking a thumb with exaggerated care.

“I have several,” Jake said, suspicious. “They change like weather. Sometimes it’s ‘stay,’ and sometimes it’s ‘go on then,’ and sometimes it’s ‘enough,’ but not the mean kind that means stop, the good kind that means there is plenty. Sometimes it’s the name of a person I haven’t met yet.”

“Sometimes it’s my name,” Rowan said, and he did not make it a question.

“Sometimes it is,” Jake said, and did not lower his eyes, because he had once been taught that to hold the gaze of someone you love is an act of respect, not challenge.

They walked home slowly because the afternoon had become a beagle and wanted to sniff everything. Rowan wanted to show a patch of valerian coming up between two paving stones that looked like a small rebellion. Jake wanted to stop outside the house where a boy had chalked a hopscotch that used prime numbers and the last square said SPACE. A woman cycling with tulips in her pannier decided at speed that she knew them and smiled in a way that put cake into your mouth. Epsom was being ridiculous and perfect and they let it show off.

Back at the cottage, the garden pretended not to be watching, which is a difficult pose for a garden to maintain. The apple tree had made up its mind to be the sort of citizen who bears fruit without comment. The nettles were busy with a project at the edge. Rowan went to show the basil its rival and the basil swelled with jealousy and perked. He washed his wrist as if washing a child’s knee. He held it under the tap and said things like, “Good leaf,” the way you do if you have decided a piece of yourself is a dog.

Jake stood in the doorway and felt the house lean around them the way good houses have always leaned around people they plan to keep. He could almost hear his grandmother folding her arms in contentment in the next room. He could almost hear the droids’ soft insistence that the center you return to is built out of cups and doorframes as much as discipline. The knot in the day loosened without untying.

That night, they lay on their backs and described the ceiling to one another as if it were a night sky you could name. Rowan’s wrist warmed gently against Jake’s shoulder and the leaf was an ember that did not burn. They talked about his father as if he were a country whose border controls had always been inconsistent. They did not talk about the alley. When Jake slept he dreamed of a chalk man drawn on a hill, one of those ancient designs that no one quite has ownership of, and the chalk man had a small leaf on his wrist. The leaf glowed and then didn’t. The man got up out of the turf and walked into town to buy a loaf and no one noticed he had never been a person before.

When he woke, Rowan was sitting up with his back to the headboard, watching a moth investigate the curtain. He looked very awake and very calm. “There’s a string in me,” he said, because morning is for statements. “It’s not pulling. It’s there. It runs to somewhere I can’t tell. It doesn’t feel like a trap and it doesn’t feel like an anchor. It feels like those lines old farmers use to measure a field—quiet and indispensable.”

“Does it end at my hand?” Jake asked, half jest and half enquiry, because there are ways to be gentle with a truth without diminishing it.

“It touches your hand and goes on,” Rowan said. “Which is right. I want more of my life to do that. Touch and go on. Not because I want to be away from you. Because each thing that touches should not end there.”

Jake reached for him and put his hand on the new mark because touching new marks is forbidden by every sensible pamphlet and that has always been how you bless things that you intend to keep safe. He felt, as his palm warmed the leaf, a shift in the air, a small click like the click a good lock makes when the bolt slides into a place that was built to receive it. He did not move backwards through time and he did not leap forward. He let the moment happen at the speed it had chosen. He knew a door had been closed somewhere he would never see and a window had been opened where a fox would once be grateful.

In the late morning post, a postcard arrived. It had been addressed to the house, not to any person; the scrawl was secretarial and also embarrassed. On the front was a picture of a horse with a sad, intelligent face. On the back was a very tidy message that said: We are moving premises. It was nice to have you. Thank you for returning what wasn’t yours. — M. There was a single small dot of green ink by the signature that could have been a smear and could have been a berry.

Rowan stuck it to the fridge with a magnet shaped like a lemon and said, “We have a certificate.” He made tea with both hands and no tricks and all the hungry parts of the house cheered in their chairs the way audiences do when everyone pretends they are not going to try to clap in rhythm and then do, and it works, for once, and the song and the hands find each other.

In the weeks that followed, the town resumed its habit of being too much and not enough at once. The library ran out of envelopes and acquired a donation of fifty-seven copies of the same thriller. Kids came in after school and smelt like cut grass and caramel. Jake returned books to their shelves as if shelving was a defiance of entropy. He answered calls from people who had got into minor road rage fights with their neighbours’ hedges and said sentences like, “I hear that the bay is making you feel judged,” in a steady voice. He swore at a stapler only in his head. He put the kettle on and occasionally didn’t.

Rowan’s wrist healed and flaked and itched and healed again and ended up looking like a thought that had always been there. He kept working in the garden and in other people’s, where he made eye contact with terracotta pots and held conversations about drainage with men who had never confessed anything and found themselves admitting to mosquito bites and grief. He tied the rosemary back with a rough string that succeeded where silk had been pretence. He planted peas in a line so straight the birds thought it rude and left them alone out of respect. He whittled a little because men who are happy whittle without shame.

Sometimes, at the very edge of sleep, Jake would feel the river of time snapping at his shoes and he would rest his boot on its neck and say, not now, old thing, not yet. Once, he felt it offer him a day he had already lived and he turned it down gently as you turn down an invitation to a party held by people you love and cannot bear right now. Once, he woke laughing because time had tried to sell him something he already owned, which is an old trick employed by markets and gods.

midsummer came and then pretended to leave and then came back, sheepish. The Downs bristled with families who had trained themselves to sit on grass for more than an hour. The garden grew into itself and then out of it. Birds rained commentary. The apple tree made plans to overachieve. The basil found a tone and stuck to it. The nettles extended their republic and sent a delegation to discuss trade. The gate still squealed confidentially and the hedge still bit the sleeve of any jacket careless enough to come within reach. When the afternoons went long and gummy with heat, Rowan would bring a bowl of water out to the steps and stick his feet in and sigh like a man who understands his own good fortune and does not feel the need to forgive it.

It was in one of those afternoons that the ripple returned, not as violence, not as demand, but as a change in light, as if someone had put a thumbprint on the sun. Jake was sitting with a book open at a page he had no intention of reading and Rowan was asleep with his head slid sideways on to Jake’s thigh, the new leaf turned up to blink at the sky. The air rose and fell like a chest remembering breathing. The Force came near and checked the perimeter.

The difference was a sound at the far end of the garden where the path went crooked because there had once been a shed and now there wasn’t. It sounded like a step belonging to something that had practised. Jake didn’t move; he let it come. The fox emerged, the one that had signed its invoices so regularly they had built a sort of civil relationship. Its coat had the sort of gaps old furniture has where you have never found the splinter. Its face was its face; you cannot improve on a fox’s regard for its own soul. It placed something at the edge of the flagstone like a courier too proud to ring the bell and looked Jake directly in the eye with an expression that said, this isn’t for you, and also, you will be the delivery mechanism because you are taller.

He slid out from under Rowan’s weight carefully because love is a religion of not waking the other person until you want to wake them; he crept forward and crouched by the gift. It was a small piece of chain, fine enough to go on a wrist, delicate enough to snap if you misused it. It was not the bell-chain from the shop, but it had been near it at some point; it smelt faintly of metal and mended ink. Looping through the links were three hairs that were not human and not fox. They were pale as nettle threads. He knew them, the way you know a voice through a telephone line from the next county. He held it up and the leaf on Rowan’s wrist caught the light reflected back and shivered.

“Fox mail?” Rowan said, drowsy, without opening his eyes.

“We have a subscription,” Jake said. “It’s from someone who likes to move rooms.”

Rowan sat up so fast that sleep fell off him like crumbs. He took the chain and held it to his ear like a conch. He listened, face turned inward. “It makes a humming like a tap that drips in the night until you convince yourself it’s the sea,” he said. “And a small sound like someone unscrewing a jar with a difficult lid.”

“It is either a request or a trap or a test,” Jake said. “Those are the categories into which life fits, at least on Thursdays.”

“My father has taken up the habit of calling me at five in the morning to tell me no one visits anymore,” Rowan said, apropos and not. “He had a fall again. He didn’t fall. He put himself on the floor gently because he was not ready to be upright. He said one thing I have never heard him say. He said my name like it was made of wood he was not entitled to carve. Something is changing and it’s not just because we made a leaf.”

“You think the shop isn’t done with us,” Jake said. He said it lightly not because he thought it was light, but because he wanted time to relax its jaw.

Rowan examined the chain and then, without drama, fastened it round his wrist on the other arm, the one with no leaves and no grass, the one he always used to hold a ladder steady. He looked at Jake whilst doing it, the way you look at a person when they’re going to have opinions about the thing you’re about to do. “If it’s a trap,” he said, “let it catch something that is not my hand. If it’s a request, consider this the right address. If it’s a test, let it test what I decided today and not what I decided when I was eight.”

Jake wanted to say take it off. He wanted to say not in my house. He wanted to say I promised your grandmother, who is not my grandmother, unknown and still present, that I would not humour your daft decisions. He said, instead, because that part of him that always chose the path that crossed in shallow water had not deserted him, “It looks good on you, if the goal is to look like a person who knows where the doors are.”

Rowan held his arms out like someone modelling sleeves. “My goal is to be a man who opens the right ones,” he said, and then went back to sleep with the speed and honesty of a person we should put in charge of important committees.

Jake watched the fox who watched back until watching had achieved all the exchange it could. Then the fox trotted into the hedge, where everything was a parliament. Jake leaned his head against the warm plaster by the kitchen door and listened for the sound that always came when a narrative had found a new bit of itself and was deciding whether to tell it. It was like the soft impact of chalk on the ground when you draw another line on a figure halfway through and the chalk breaks and the dust stays on your skin.

That evening, as if a day had two mornings and both of them had unsettled weather, the telephone rang and did not stop ringing until Jake got to it. The council needed him because of a fence argument that had become the kind of fence argument with ladders. The library needed him because the alarm had done that thing it did when moths learned to impersonate criminals. The day made demands. He went out into it with the sort of fatal cheer the English reserve for days when everything is a puddle and nothing is negotiable. He put his boots on and checked his pockets for coins and patience and door keys and the tiny screwdriver he used to talk sense into loose screws.

Rowan kissed the side of his head at the door, the quick kind that says later. “I’ll be in the garden,” he said. “Or slightly beyond. There’s a woman on the estate by the cricket club who has a hedge that has delusions of trench warfare.”

Jake hesitated, the sort of hesitate that lasts longer on the inside than the outside. “If the chain pulls, you shout,” he said, and immediately wanted to dissolve the sentence in tea because he didn’t like the way it put the world in two careful halves.

“If it pulls, I’ll pull back first,” Rowan said, and waggled his wrist once so that the fine links made a domestic sound. “I haven’t had a good tug of war with a bad idea in months.”

Jake left. He did his day. He listened to a man confess his affection for a fence panel that had rotted heroically. He made note of moths’ ambitions. He catalogued a box of local leaflets from the nineties that were a history of a town trying, in good faith, to tell itself it was modern whilst hosting a dog show with a category called Best Whiskers. He bought paracetamol. He called his sister and said something sincere about a birthday and meant it. He performed the simple liturgy of being a person.

When he came home towards dusk, the hedge was in a mood and the gate had opinions, which suggested that the garden had been visited by the kind of truth that leaves. The kitchen was warm and smelt of onion in the way that made you think winter would be fine when it came. There was a teacup in the sink with a ring halfway down it, as if interrupted by a knock. The basil was being proud. The radio had died mid-sentence and would not admit it.

Out back, the apple tree was as it had been and as it would be. The nettle republic had passed a vote. The small bench had moved three inches to the left and neither of them would ever own up to having done it. Rowan was not there.

Jake did not shout. He sat on the back step and put his head in his hands and spoke to the bit of himself that always ran down a field before he’d checked the ground for holes. He did nothing dramatic with time. He did not look for a door in a tree. He took out his phone and tried to be ordinary.

He called and it went to voicemail. He texted and wrote: soup? He sent nothing else and would not, because that way lay the sort of need that frightened him when he saw it in other people. He looked at the chain on the table and did not touch it because it was on the table, which meant Rowan had taken it off, which meant he had put it on the table, which meant he had found where it led and decided to leave himself behind, which meant something had been learnt, which meant the story had not been written by a stranger.

At full dark, his phone lit up with a message that said: come. no hurry. old scout hut. bring your calm. And because Rowan could not help himself there was a second: and a torch if you have one that doesn’t think it’s a lighthouse.

Jake stood and the house gathered itself around him like a coat that had hung by the door for this exact walk. He took the torch that had patience and he put the chain in his pocket after all because he had never been good at being neat. He told the garden to mind its corners and not let anyone in the back door whose shoes smelt like planning. He shut the front door, which squealed in agreement and worry.

The road to the old scout hut was not long, but it had a way of being longer than your reasons for going there. As a place, it had always hovered slightly outside the map of Epsom; it was technically there in that it took up space, received post, held spiders; it was not there in that no one could have told you the last time they had been inside without getting the date wrong. The hut crouched behind the trees where the path forgot its purpose and turned to leaf. It had been painted the colour of false hope and then left to flake. Someone had put a new padlock on the door in an act of optimism and then lost the key.

Rowan was on the step with a thermos and a kind smile for whoever he had been waiting for. He stood when he saw Jake and the relief on his face had the complicated geometry of love—self-respect plus a willingness to look foolish plus the need to put himself at the same height as the person approaching.

“You came quickly,” he said, and took the torch and kissed the mouth that had permitted that speed.

“I didn’t run,” Jake said, because there are certain boasts a person like him cannot make even when they are true, and the torch and the chain were heavy in his pocket in the way that all ordinary objects are at the moment they become important.

Rowan pointed at the door. “We’ve got a room,” he said, and this time the word didn’t mean walls and floors. It meant a place in days you could use. “It wasn’t a trap. It was a trick and an invitation, and I was with it and then I wasn’t because it required me to stop being funny and I refused. But I think—I think we will want to go in. Not tonight. Not with my stupid brave hands doing all the talking. With your calm. With our leaf. With cake. With a rope tied to the apple tree if you think it helps. I want to see what the town remembers when it forgets to be itself.”

Jake put his hand on the door because that was always his job, to talk to doors. The wood was old as a promise made too young and kept anyway. The padlock was new; it had the energy of a teenager at a choir rehearsal. Behind the wood was a smell like chalk after rain. He knocked, not because he expected an answer, but because you knock on certain doors even when they are yours. The sound inside was breath. He took out the chain and held it against the cold metal and the chain was not a key, but the padlock decided it had been long enough unfinished. It clicked. The click was mild and profound.

Rowan leaned his shoulder to the wood and Jake let the torch find the space within. Dust turned its slow stars in the beam. There were stacked chairs the colour of bad oranges. A folded flag had been left incorrectly; the corners were wrong. There was a smell of tea that someone had never emptied out of cups. On the back wall, where someone had once put a white board to teach knots and kindness, there was a map of the Downs drawn in fat green. On it, someone had inked a small leaf, just there, where the path curved down towards Tattenham Corner, which is the sort of name you can live a whole life inside and still get lost in.

They did not go in, not all the way. They stood in the doorway like the sort of people their own grandmothers would have approved of, and the torch laid a thin road over the dust. They did not speak for a minute because there are some agreements you make with a room that are better made in your chest. When Rowan finally moved, it was to slip his hand into Jake’s, not because he needed to be held, but because you hold hands when you are choosing to tie your separate fears into a single acceptable rope.

“Tomorrow,” Jake said. It wasn’t a command. It was a day.

“Tomorrow,” Rowan said, and the word moved out into the hut and touched the chairs and the white board and the map and got on with finding a place to sit.The next day arrived with its sleeves rolled up as if it had been volunteered for something. The light was the colour of washing-up water and the kitchen smelled of toast and resolve. They built a small expedition out of household objects because that is how you cross into strangeness without breaking it: a thermos of tea that had been allowed to think highly of itself; a tin with three slices of lemon drizzle stacked like quiet coins; the good torch, the one that didn’t strangle its batteries to get attention; a ball of twine that had once been a good idea and now looked like a sheep; a bit of chalk from the bowl on the mantel where Jake kept his pocketed pebbles and the glass marble he’d found under the lilac; two apples with more personality than juice; and a first-aid kit that had never yet had to be important. Rowan argued with his boots and won. Jake kissed his forehead in the way you do when you’re blessing someone’s socks. They looked at each other and let the day hear them being sure.

They did tie a rope to the apple tree, in the end, because superstition is only practical past remembered through other people’s mistakes. Rowan made an elaborate joke of it, looping the twine around his waist like a comedy mountaineer, and then undid it because dignity, and then tied it to his belt all the same. The apple tree tolerated the indignity with an air of long-suffering civic responsibility. “For the council minutes,” Rowan said, patting the trunk. “In case we come back with stories that require secondary witnesses.” Jake tied the other end with the sort of knot he trusted in storms and funerals. He felt the Force settle into the fibres with interest, like a cat curling into a basket that had always been meant for it but would deny it if asked.

The path to the hut knew them now, which made it more important to behave like strangers. They said hello to the disturbed robin and to the bit of fence that had decided to go diagonally. The padlock had taken its lesson from the night before and did not pretend to be more than a gesture. The door stuck, then remembered itself, then opened to their combined manners. Inside the air was cool in the way of rooms that keep their own councils. Dust rose to meet them and failed to be sinister. A line of chairs along the wall made the same statement as a small, polite queue in a post office where the stamp dispenser had gone wrong: determined, resigned, faintly comic.

They placed their offerings on a table near the window with the seriousness of children who have chosen who gets the blue cup. Tea went into both mugs; cake existed. Jake put a bit of chalk on the windowsill and another on the floor by the threshold, a small pale breadcrumb trail that was really a series of thank-yous for the floor remembering how to be underfoot. Rowan stalked the perimeter with his hands behind his back like a benign inspector of guardrails. He paused at the stacked flags and the heap of neckerchiefs and the box of “Lost Property” labelled in a sharp, kind hand that did its best not to judge. He picked up a whistle with a lanyard that had become a rope because time does that and thought about it for a second, then put it down with the handling people give to relics.

The map on the back wall had not moved. The little leaf that had been drawn where the path curved felt less like a joke and more like someone else’s confidence in them. Rowan stood in front of it and let the room’s hum catch him. “It looks like instructions if you squint,” he murmured. “Not to go there. To remember you’ve already been there and the ground liked it.” Jake came to stand beside him, and the quiet between them shifted from pause to readiness. He did not reach with his talent the way you might reach for a deadbolt; he simply let the drift of time come close and then did not flinch when it recognised him.

The change when it came was small and exact. The room thickened not in the lungs but at the knees, the way a meadow thickens when the grass has decided human ankles are an acceptable indignity. The green of the map on the wall breathed once. The beam of the torch swung and clipped a dust mote that looked suddenly like a planet. The smell altered: chalk, yes, and canvas, and the ghost of polish that had once been rubbed into wood by hands that did things the hard way as a form of grace. A thread ran up Rowan’s arm from the leaf and hummed under his skin like the line of a song no one is trying to remember and can’t forget. He looked at Jake and did not ask for permission. He put two fingertips against the drawn leaf.

The world did not jump. It decided to include a second world, then practiced at making them both fit. The map came off the wall without moving and laid itself over the room, so the stacked chairs were sudden hedgerows, and the table was a hump in the turf, and the smell of rain not yet agreed upon made a promise to all four corners. They were not elsewhere. Elsewhere arrived and stood respectfully behind the furniture. Jake felt it settle around his shoulders like a coat he’d been lent by someone who had worn it through weather. The cricket of the actual field came in at the edges, stitching itself into the shiver of fluorescent light. Somewhere a child shouted for their lost ball, and the lost ball rolled along the hut floor slowly and did not arrive.

Rowan breathed. “We’re fine,” he said out loud, and the hut agreed, and the path ran in under the threshold, and the drawn leaf expanded a little and then stopped as if surprised at its own nerve. He kept his fingers there, and at the same time took them away. In the overlay field a line of chalk ran around a patch of ground and made the air inside it cooler. A small boy sat within with his hands on his knees like an agreement. He was not any of the ways children in stories are obviously special. He looked like a boy who had been taught to stay where he was put because people were coming back and he had believed them and he was right. Jake felt the old ache in his chest where loyalty keeps its essential sorrow. He did not step forward; he would not walk over a version of his own trust.

“Am I allowed to wave?” Rowan asked, because if anyone could make an impossible thing polite, it was him. Jake, who had once been warned, and then taught, and then forgiven, measured the balance and found the fulcrum and nodded. Rowan lifted his hand and made a small, ridiculous wave that would have been an act of love in any language, and the boy ignored him completely in the way of children who are content and concentrating. The chalk line around him brightened in appreciation, like a well-drawn boundary relishing its conductivity.

Behind them, something shifted that was not sinister because it was interested, which is a difference worth writing down. A cupboard that had always been there sighed open a fraction. There was a smell of bergamot as if Earl Grey had decided to be an apparition. “Well then, ducks,” a voice said, from a distance that wasn’t measured in feet. “You’ve found the bolt-hole I told the world not to mislay.” The voice was neither male nor female in the way education sometimes isn’t if you’re lucky. It held a smile and an insistence that there would be biscuits if you were decent.

Jake startled not with fear but with an old affection he had progressed so carefully he’d put it back on the shelf for a day. “You’re dead,” he said, because honesty around certain ghosts gets you more change in the jar. The echo of his mentor, who had been partial to knitted waistcoats and unlicensed metaphors, approved. A sliver of someone stood by the white board, not part of the overlay and not separate from it. It was like a number someone had left out of a sum on purpose and the sum was better for it.

“I am not making all this effort to be dead,” the voice said, tart and fond. “I am temporarily unavailable for meetings. Also, every room we built has a spare key. Congratulations on being the sort of people rooms tell about each other. No poking the seams. No putting your boots on the furniture. If you pick up a name, put it back where you found it. Bring cake next time.” Rowan lifted the tin by reflex and the air warmed with gratitude that was not his own. The voice sighed like an old kettle deciding to become steam. “And take that map with a pinch of salt, lovely lads. It likes to pretend it’s in charge.”

Rowan nudged the wall with his shoulder the way you do to a doorframe when you’re deciding if it will know your height. “We brought cake this time,” he said, because he was a man who could and would talk to a room and the room would talk back. “And tea. And the kind of rope that admits to being string. And a compliment we will withdraw if you get haughty.” The cupboards were thrilled. Jake set the tin open on the table and the map kept misbehaving only within the limits of good furniture. The boy in the chalk died out like a sigh, not because he was gone but because memory has to sit down sometimes and let fresh air in.

They explored in the manner of careful people, which is to say they did not hurry to the interesting corners and they looked under the obvious things. The flag folded wrongly had been teaching itself patience; Rowan put it right with reverence and no ceremony. A noticeboard held thumbtacks like exclamation marks around obsolete events: jumble sale, bring a pound and a sense of humour; campout, bring your courage and a jumper; first aid course, bring someone you love and learn how to be useful. In the back there was a cupboard that opened on a stack of brown envelopes addressed to people whose addresses would not recognise them now. Jake touched them with his eyes only and felt the little sustained hum that lost post produces wherever it congregates. He imagined the way the town bent around those almost-deliveries and did not offer to put anything right.

On the stage-that-wasn’t, under a scalloped curtain that had seen more promised applause than its share of real, a row of badges sat in a tray awaiting sewing on. They were achievements you could measure with your hands. Fire, tied knot, last stretch of a hill climbed without complaint, kindness done when it didn’t get you praised. Rowan flicked one with his fingernail and it made the tiny, bravely arrogant tinny sound of all bits of tin pretending to be medals. He glanced at Jake and Jake shook his head like a man holding back a child from running into a road not because of danger but because of habit, and then nodded because you don’t let good small things sit in a drawer forever. Rowan took one, the one with a simple flame, and placed it on the table by the cake. He did not put it in his pocket, because talismans resent pockets.

Time did its old trick then of offering a shortcut, the place where a careful person would be tempted to step and a less careful person would end up ankle-deep in someone else’s bog. Out through the skirting board and in along the window frame came a low, fast breeze from a day a long way off, the smell of it full of horses and cheap lager and the plastic scent of rain ponchos worn by people who intended to sit down and then did not. The Downs on Derby day pressed itself against the hut and asked if anyone was coming out to play at crowds. Jake held the air with one hand like a man kindly refusing a leaflet. He did not force it back; he waited until the poor thing had done its breathing and then let it go about its business, which would be to be weather and forget him.

“What’s the chain doing?” he asked, because it was no good ignoring the smaller hooks in in case the larger ones looked empty. Rowan had looped it back on, not as bravado, simply because some gestures sit better repeated. The fine links had warmed to skin and did not bite. They twitched once against his pulse, a curious animal accepting a seed. “It’s content,” Rowan said. “It thinks we’re in the right room. It thinks I should lie under a table for ten minutes and listen to the dust settle. It has the opinion of a small boy with good instincts.” He ducked without waiting for an answer and slid under the table and lay on his back with his palms flat to the floorboards like a man touching a living beast, which after all he was.

Jake had never in his life been able to resist a sensible absurdity. He joined him, the wood cool against his shoulder blades, the hush of the place enveloping rather than muffling. Under the table the light came gentle, filtered by chair legs and cake, and the map on the wall became the inside of a tent. The hut made a contented sound that might never have happened outside their bodies. “I want to tell you a rule I was given and broke and was forgiven for,” he said, because intimacy’s alchemy is lessons turned into tenderness. “When a place is made for children, you treat it like it still is, even if no children have been there for a decade. It keeps the floor firm. It keeps the windows honest.”

Rowan turned his head and pressed their temples together as if comparing the shape of thinking. “We are being the sort of men our ten-year-old selves would have told to bring better biscuits,” he said, and their shared breath had the rhythm of a promise being written and crossed out and written again, better. They lay there until it seemed discourteous to the body to rest more. When they sat up, the room had gone back to being less than field and more than hut in a way that made the leaving feel more like pausing. They packed the spare slice for the fox who had done his courier duty. They washed the mugs with the hut’s cold tap and left them upside down to dry as if the room were a small country that appreciated its domestic rituals respected and observed.

On their way out, Jake put his palm flat to the doorframe and said thank you without any words getting ambitious, and the wood accepted the gratitude and filed it where kind acts go to make beams less prone to splinter. The padlock consented to be a padlock. Rowan looped the twine around the door handle as a sign to themselves that a rope is most honest when it is there to be tripped over on the way in, not as a guarantee that you can be pulled back if you fail yourself. They stepped into the bright nothing of an afternoon that had decided to be unreportable and felt their shoulders drop the small fraction which is the measure of a place that didn’t take something it couldn’t give back.

Back at the cottage the basil had attracted an aphid and was pretending to be above such indignities. The house smelled as if someone had made gravy days ago and the walls had only now remembered to enjoy it. Jake checked the voicemail and found three messages in the voice of men who believed that if they said their names sharply enough he would become their employee, and one from his sister which was mostly laughing, and one from a number that might have been his grandmother’s if ghosts believed in contracts with phone companies. He saved the last without listening to it and then listened to it immediately and it was nothing, a pocket call from the world, background noise, the music of strangers shopping for onions, someone saying the word “apple” as if that were auspicious.

Rowan’s phone, left in the hall like an animal that likes to ask to be let out but never wants to be, woke up with a shiver. He glanced at the screen and stood very still for the length of a sentence. “It’s him,” he said, without sourness. “He wants to know if I know what brand of cough sweets your grandmother used to like. I think he’s pretending he has a cough. Or a grandmother.” He answered, and his voice acquired the firmness of a man building a small step and testing it. He listened more than he spoke. He said, twice, “I can come,” and once, “No, not to argue,” and then, blessedly, “You don’t have to like me while I’m there,” and finally, “You’re allowed to leave the window open if you’re afraid of the room. I’ll shut it later.”

When he hung up he didn’t lean on anything. He did walk into the kitchen and set both hands on the table the way you put your two hands on the back of someone’s shoulders and tell their spine that it is fine as it is. “He’s frightened,” he said. “He thinks he’s having thoughts in front of other people and he doesn’t like it. He remembered his mother’s hands, which were cruel and tidy. He is apologising to a version of my mother he made up because he never forgave the real one for having pockets full of maps and no interest in furniture. He wants me to come tomorrow, but he doesn’t want me to bring anything that smells like kindness.”

Jake set the kettle to its small excellence without any help at all and came to him and leaned their hips together and their weight found the point where it divided and then recombined. “We’ll go,” he said. “We’ll take nothing but our ordinary. We’ll bring the stupid brave hands and leave the miracles in the cutlery drawer with the blunt knives. If he starts being clever at you, I’ll let him; if he starts being unkind, I’ll be boring at him until he has to behave.”

Rowan laughed a little into his shoulder and the sound had tired in it but not despair. “I will need cigarette money for not smoking,” he said, which is one of the best sentences anyone had ever carried around to help themselves with. He rolled his wrist and looked at the leaf which had settled into being as if it had come up through skin from bone. “I am not being dragged,” he added, softly. “I am going. That is a different story, and I intend to be fussy about it.”

Evening happened because it does. They ate broad beans and pasta and forgot to be embarrassed about how much salt they liked. The fox came and accepted the cake with the air of a beast who has seen worse bargains, and when he left he left one hair caught in the gate, pale and fine and not at all horse. Jake thought about putting it on the mantel and then, because he was learning, put it under the corner of the doormat with the other small true things that needed to be stepped on occasionally to stay real. The radio tried a documentary about the history of the paperclip and they both said “oh yes” in the exact same tone at the part where war made everything both simpler and worse.

When they went to bed, the house did that flexing thing good houses do, making room for what the night might bring. They lay on their sides like a landscape with two hills. Rowan held his father’s number in his head like a small coin he’d decided to keep, not because of value, because of provenance. Jake thought of the hut and the boy inside his own chalk and did not reach for him. The boy had done very well without him, and part of loving yourself is not discrediting the version that got you here. The chain on the bedside table learned how to be quiet. The leaf on Rowan’s wrist warmed briefly, then cooled, then was a leaf.

Morning started like a sentence that had needed to write itself for a long time. The light had decided to be benign. The kettle cooperated. Rowan put on the shirt that made him look unnecessarily expensive and then ruined the effect by putting his laces in a domestic sort of knot. They took the train because roads are for people with a tolerance for predictable anger and they were not those people today. Brighton again, and the smell of hot chips that tries so hard to be philosophy. The hospital was the same and different, like someone had swapped two paintings on the wall and told no one and the nurses were being kind about it.

Rowan’s father had a face that had been written in with nibs and then rubbed out at the edges with thumbs. He said “Well” like a stone. He did not say anything else for a while and the silence had to be pressed flat to fit in the room. Rowan sat as if he were there for as long as it took the bed to grow daisies. Jake stood like furniture and made sure his breathing was audible in a human but not pushy way. The old man looked at Rowan’s wrist and his mouth pinched, not because of judgement, because of longing that did not have a word it trusted. “Your mother had one of those on a rib,” he said, eventually, and the sentence lay down on the bed between them like a dog no one had expected to see again.

They stayed until they had worn the room down to something it could live with, then left. On the way back they did not talk to fill it. They sat the silence between them and stroked it. At Clapham Junction a child on the platform shouted “Fox!” at a pigeon and offered it half a biscuit and the pigeon accepted the name and the biscuit with indecent confidence. At Epsom they walked home the long way again because the long way had their feet memorised now and had started thinking in anticipation of their jokes. The rope on the apple tree told them with a single tautness that the hut had not sulked while they were out. The basil had forgiven the aphid. The house was making plans, which is to say it was. They stepped in and the door made the soft, intimate fuss you only get from hinges that have been forgiven a thousand times. The next day took its place on the shelf with the other bright jars. The next day would be theirs too, unless it wasn’t, and then it would be more a belonging for having been lost and found.The day after Brighton, the town behaved so impeccably that it felt like a rehearsal for kindness. The rain washed the pavements exactly once and then left them alone; buses arrived at the moments they had promised to, with drivers who nodded as if they were participating in a social experiment about civility; even the dog that normally shouted at postmen through number twenty-seven’s letterbox simply watched and considered unionising in silence. Jake woke before the bird at the glass had decided to start its taps and lay very still to see if his body would tell him something his mind hadn’t caught yet. The string in him that sometimes hummed with weather was quiet, and the quiet was not the growing kind his grandmother had warned him about, but the useful kind that lets you walk along the edge of a thought without falling into it. He went to the kitchen and found Rowan there already, in the shirt that made him look like someone had ironed him as an act of tribute and a pair of socks that had become a metaphor for his rebellion. The new leaf on his wrist had settled into its tone; it no longer flared in certain lights, it simply belonged, the way a word begins to belong after you’ve spoken it aloud at someone who made their face soft to receive it.

They ate toast like people who trusted the bread, and agreed without using sentences that had the word “plan” in them that they would go to the hut after errands and the library and the necessary call to Rowan’s father which would be more of a listening than an exchange. The day unfolded in the small units that domesticate fate: the thock of the letterbox with a circular about wheelie bins that was almost a work of art; a neighbour’s request to borrow a ladder which, after ten minutes’ conversation about ladders, turned into a request to borrow Rowan, and Rowan accepted and then brought both back fixed; a book returned to the library with a sprig of pressed thyme in it which made the whole counter smell like a recipe. By the time they put their shoulders into the hut door together, a kind of preparedness had settled on them that felt less like strategy and more like a pair of boots set by a threshold with their laces already agreeing to be tied.

Inside, the temperature had remembered the exact degree to keep a scout hut at, which is the one where tea tastes like conversation and people’s hands look more useful than complicated. The map on the back wall affected innocence with the confidence of a cat that has knocked something off a shelf and found it improved the room. The dots of chalk Jake had left on the sill and by the threshold were intact, neither scuffed nor boasting, which meant the hut had not been bothered by anyone who didn’t know how to enter a place quietly. There was a new thing, though, as there always is; even when towns refuse to change, rooms have their own ideas. A piece of paper had been slid under a chair like a neighbor’s gossip slid under a door, and on it was a stamped notice with council language that had practised being polite for years and then broken its own heart: Proposed Renewal of Site: Scout Hut 1A Wood Lane, Consultation. The sentences that followed were the kind that try to sound like they are in the service of children while implying that children would surely rather be in a glass building with air conditioning than a wooden one with splinters of history. A meeting was scheduled for a Wednesday in a room above a chemist where chairs would make people’s knees take sides.

Rowan read it with his head on one side as if it were a plant leaf folding against drought and looked at the hut’s windows with a farmer’s instinct to judge a field by the way the light sits on it. “They want to turn you into something that smells like paint and temporary good intentions,” he said, not to Jake, but to the boards and the flagpole and the handsome useless heap of lost-and-found neckerchiefs. “They want you to be brighter and easier to clean and less like a bench people have carved their names into since 1972, which is to say, less like the place where people learned how to be themselves in front of other people.” He placed the notice back on the chair and flattened it with his palm, a gesture that did not look like submission but like hospitality. “Well then,” he added, and the words contained a whole rota of small acts and a box of biscuits.

Jake took the paper and felt it with the careful part of himself that disliked being surprised and tried to make surprise his co-conspirator. The Force did not crackle with wrath; it did not get indignant on the hut’s behalf; it did the slower thing of showing him, in the part of his mind that kept the weather, a series of Wednesday evenings of people who mattered to each other gathering in rooms that had been places of ritual so often that those rooms had become a kind of liturgy themselves. He saw hands lifted to speak, and voices making their small shapes, and the odd joy of a sentence that lands square and is allowed to sit for a minute and make the air honest. He folded the notice twice and then twice again and tucked it into his pocket with coins, so that it would have company when he walked around later and let it form an argument in him without becoming a speech. “We’ll go,” he said, and it was not a declaration so much as a confirmation that they had remembered to be their own kind of grown-ups.

On the way out they found a little bundle of feathers under the eaves with a string tied delicately around it, like a child’s idea of a parcel. It was not sinister, and Rowan’s grin didn’t last a second because he knew at once that the parcel was from the fox’s larger family—the ones with thumbs. He untied the string with a fastidiousness that would have made his mother proud, if his mother had known how to be proud without worrying she was doing it wrong, and inside was a train ticket stub. The print had rubbed off the place with the price and the class; the date still held. It was the Saturday of Derby week last year, and the origin was Epsom Downs, and the destination was simply LONDON TERMINALS like a promise of escape and a threat of nothing in particular. There was a smear of green ink on the edge, not quite a berry, not quite a leaf. They looked at each other in the way you do when a room sends you post, and the hut settled, pleased that its missive had hit the right hands.

They took the stub home and stood it on the mantel under the horse magnet as if that would amuse whatever household gods had been accruing in the corners since Jake’s grandmother had brought home a souvenir spoon from Lourdes and told it to behave. The evening folded them into itself, and the basil became insufferable and the radio installed a programme about swans that sounded like a coded message, and Jake attempted, without looking like he was attempting, to count how many lives he was living in at once and whether any of them needed unsubscribing from. It is a piece of human luck, he considered, that most of the time the answer to such an inventory is simply to make more soup.

By Wednesday the notice had made a ring on the table where it had sat under a sweating glass, which felt appropriately petty. They climbed the narrow stairs above the chemist to the sort of municipal room that had been painted the colour of compliance and then allowed to learn to forgive itself. People had come in the kind of numbers you only get when publicity has been both poor and effective, which is to say they had mostly heard about it from someone who had said their names to them at a market stall. There were pensioners with good coats and expressions that meant they had weathered every plan the council had ever had, mothers with biro on their knuckles and toddlers like satellites, teenagers who were there because someone had made them be there and would later claim credit for their appearance for years, and three men who smelt of wet dog and committee. Maris slid in late with her cardigan and her smile that did not apologise for being tired, and took a place at the back where the chairs were clever enough not to squeak at people.

The man at the front explained Renewal in a voice that made clear he believed in the concept of the hut while also believing in the power of sprayed plaster to expel sorrow. He had slides that showed children who had never touched England in their lives and were nonetheless cheerful. He said “accessibility” in a way that did not mention that wheelchairs, inconveniently, have to move over thresholds made by time. He said “safety” in a tone that treated splinters as lawsuits rather than transformations, because everyone remembers the first time they bled for something useful. When he opened the floor, Epsom unfurled its true speech. The woman who ran Guides in a room that smelt of biscuits and weather related, in detail, the way the hut’s unprepossessing sink had taught fifteen girls to help each other, and the unglamour of filling kettles had been a training in democracy. The old man with a jumper knitted out of someone else’s promises told the tale of the time a storm had walked in and everyone’s shoes had squeaked and the roof had held and people had learned you can defy rain by singing on the beat. The teenager confessed to having kissed someone badly behind the stage and having learned ever since that privacy is also a public good when you are desperate and honest. Maris stood for a moment with her head bent and then raised it and said, clearly enough that the careers of ten men would falter for a second sometime later without knowing why, that there are rooms that collect bravery in their wallpaper, and when you strip them and paint them and make them look like every other room you take away the one thing that made being there matter.

Rowan did not intend to speak and did, because he found his hand had lifted of its own accord and words had formed like birds who had practised together. He said that a place like the hut knows the length of a day in more ways than any device you can plug in, that it reminds the bodies inside it that a minute is not just a unit of billing. He said that he had brought a leaf in with him and that he would like to leave with the leaf intact, and it made no sense to the man with the slides and all the sense to the room. Jake, whose talent was saying no in a doorway without thunder, waited for the man with slides to counter with cost and policy and compliance and something about insurance, and then said into the pause, gently and with a clarity that unsettled the air, that for a town to consider demolishing one of the places where its children have been allowed to be foolish and brave without being punished, it should first ask the walls if they are tired. There was laughter and there was that feeling of a room choosing to agree with itself and therefore to do the slower, better thing. The slides came down carefully and a committee was suggested with the air of a necessary compromise. On the way out, an old man Jake had never seen before but who had the smell of the Downs in dry weather said to him without greeting, “You’ve got your grandmother’s foolishness, boy,” and patted his elbow in a way that made it feel scandalously public to carry a lineage.

They went to the bakery as if it were a debriefing room and purchased cake with the solemnity of victualling a ship. Outside on the pavement, the leaf on Rowan’s wrist woke like a thing sniffing the air and he held his arm a little away from his body to see what it wanted. There was nothing dramatic; there was merely a sense that the afternoon had put on a different shirt and would have to be dealt with accordingly. He glanced up the High Street towards the racecourse and the air had that pearly, uncommitted quality that Derby weeks always had, as if the sky itself were thinking about odds. The ticket stub on their mantel had been waiting to have a conversation and had now cleared its throat; it was not tugging, but it had opinions about punctuality. They took their bag home and put the cake under a towel because houses expect to be trusted with cake, and went up towards the Downs with their hands in their pockets and the kind of intention that makes crows watch.

Derby week does something to Epsom that is not entirely Epsom’s idea. It fills the lanes with people who believe in speed but not always in momentum; it makes the grass short of its own choice; it makes the lampposts listen to jokes in dialects they had not heard since the pyramids were new. The course lay ahead like an error that had been formalised into tradition, and the rails gleamed and the temporary stands looked like a city pretending to be a tent. Jake watched the crowd the way a river watches its banks; he could not stop it being itself, but he could curl a eddy here and lessen a pull there. He had not come to practise anything; he had come to note what happened to time when people cheered at a line no one present had drawn. Rowan’s attention went to the grass, to the line where foot met earth, to the sense that plants have when they consent to being trodden on for a day in exchange for time alone later to put themselves back together.

They walked among the stalls selling unlikely hats and kebabs that made no promises and were therefore reasonable, and they bought a shared paper cup of tea that contained the flavour of a thousand other cups of tea drunk standing up with insufficient sugar. They let themselves be part of the thing without being diluted by it, and every now and then Rowan would let his fingers brush Jake’s sleeve as if he were sighted through touch. It would have been a day entirely without event if not for the boy whose leg went through the lower rail as if permission meant nothing, and the world did the sharp intake of breath it always does when someone mistakes the strictness of certain lines.

He was small and too fast and had managed that trick children have of being both allowed and unwatched, and he was already falling forwards in the peculiar slow time inside a panic towards the gap where hooves might land or not land without noticing the difference. There was a mother’s noise and a man’s shout and the reflexive lurch of three strangers who had correctly decided that dignity was irrelevant. Jake experienced the unpleasant blessing of knowing exactly how long the fall would take and what the ground would do to a small ribcage if certain other things were true. He did not step backwards through anything and he did not step forwards into a place he couldn’t give back; he stepped sideways in a way that made the air hesitate for a moment and offered it something else to think about. It was small, a breath shifted here, a sleeve caught there, the smallest additional friction against the boy’s knee that moved a vector by a finger’s breadth. Rowan did not know he had moved until he had moved; his gardener’s body had always been built to lean the right way at the right moment, to make a human hedge where a gap was irresponsible to leave. He put his hand, the one without leaves, palm up under the boy’s chest, and took the weight the way you receive a delicate pot falling off a shelf, and the boy’s little sternum made a sound against his palm that was a pleasanter sentence than the one it had been on course to utter.

There was the sort of hush that happens in crowds which is not about reverence but about people being briefly ashamed of all the things they had been thinking a moment before, and then there was that sound that English people make when relief has stopped them being ironic. The boy cried in the trying-to-be-brave way of a person whose last ten seconds had included too many revisions, and clung to Rowan’s shirt with the kind of fidelity usually exhibited by barnacles. The mother said thank you in two registers at once and then began to apologise for the boy’s existence, and Rowan interrupted her with the calm of a man who had been lifted off a wall by strangers once and had been allowed to pretend he had jumped. “He has the right idea,” he said. “Better to find where the edges are with a person holding on to you than with a fence that doesn’t care.” He set the boy down and made his face stupid on purpose until the child snorted through tears, and Jake saw the way that the child’s line through time had altered by a millimetre and would therefore make a different life, and felt the appropriate measure of awe and terror without having to show anyone.

They moved on because standing in the public kindness too long makes you into the sort of people who try to get knighted for bringing their neighbour’s bin in. Behind them the crowd filled in with its chatter and its odds and its need to have a day be a day. In them the string that connected the hut, the ticket stub, the racecourse, the notice in Jake’s pocket and his grandmother’s broom all thrummed in sympathy, and then settled. The leaf on Rowan’s wrist behaved itself and did not try to enact any further mythology in front of the bookmakers. They walked along the rail until the grass found them again and Epsom remembered it was more a town than a temporary carnival. On the way down from the course a fox in the central reservation watched them cross at the lights with the indifference of a minor god not in charge of that particular weather and flicked an ear as if to mark them as people who had not embarrassed themselves today.

That night, in the kitchen where the paint peeled in the corner you only noticed when you were happy, they told the story back and forth between them the way people do who prefer to taste competence on their tongues rather than dramatics. Rowan showed Jake the faint red mark on his palm where the boy’s chest had met the moment, and Jake pressed his own hand over it and felt the echo stop trying to ripple itself into importance and accept its size. The radio recorder played the local bulletin almost by accident and halfway through a piece about lost dogs and found councillors there was thirty seconds in which a “man with quick hands” and “his friend” had made “a calm decision” at the rail. The words were the blandest way to name grace, which meant they were perfect. Jake’s phone dinged with a single text from his sister that said I know it was you because of the phrase “calm decision” and a row of lemon emojis she used to mean love in their own language. Rowan’s phone produced a missed call from his father and then, before Rowan could make a choice, rang again and he answered and listened to a man breathe in a morality tale and say, almost diffidently, “There’s a clip on the telly. They said you were someone’s friend,” and then, after a beat that tore and mended, “I hope that someone keeps you in the place you act like.”

They did not say out loud that the hut had been right to send the stub, and they did not say out loud that the leaf had warned as much as decorated, and they did not say out loud that they were now part of a thing that was not a club and not a church and not a committee and not a fairy story. They did say, in between bites of cake and a debate about whether the basil had turned a corner into tyrannical, that they would make a list, not of rules, but of household habits for how to behave when rooms had their ideas. It was the sort of list that grows itself if you leave paper on a table: bring cake, tie rope, say thank you to wood, don’t show off in front of the overlay, sit under tables if you have to, call people by their names even if you only know the names of their dogs, wait for the kettle to boil without helping it, ask the fox if this is what he meant, put chalk in pockets and maps back on walls, and consider that a good door deserves to be patted twice a year without having to squeak to get attention.

When he slept, Jake dreamed of lines, but not as traps, as bindings you tie across your own back to remind your muscles how to hold you when you laugh with your whole torso. He dreamed of his mentor’s voice telling a room to be quiet using nothing more than the way she stirred her tea. He dreamed of Rowan lying under a table while dust made small planets and of being in love as if it were a hobby and a vocation and an exercise and a mirage and a thing to do because you were bored and a thing to do because you had remembered mortality and a thing to do as if you had invented it, all at once. In the morning he woke to Rowan sitting on the edge of the bed with one sock on and the other sock suspended between thumb and thought, looking at his phone with a frown that didn’t make fear, it made logistics. His father had sent a message saying he had left the back door open because the house felt like it wanted him to and was that a daft thing to do, and could someone tell him if the rain would spoil it.

They caught the mid-morning train like a pair of sentences that had found a comma. Brighton was breezy with an optimism it hadn’t earned. The sea heaved as if it had eaten opinions for breakfast. The back door was open and the house behind it smelt of old polish and earth dragged in on shoes that had made themselves honest. The corridors had the look of being empty and sincere. Rowan did not announce himself as a son; he announced himself as a man with tea and a willingness to wash cups. His father looked at the back door once and made a face as if he had been expecting to be told off by a god and therefore felt a failure for not being punished. Rowan propped it with a chair the way you prop chairs under the night to tell it that you have not abdicated your duty, you are just allowing traffic. The old man watched him and the watching softened him, and then he said, without taking his eyes off what he could not admit he loved, “Your mother used to tie twine to the apple tree and say it kept her honest,” and then he shut his mouth on the second half of the story, which was probably that he had hated it because it looked like superstition and a person gets tired of seeing other people’s rituals if they’re not allowed any of their own. They sat with the door open until the house breathed differently, and if that was magic it was the sort that doesn’t need to be applauded.

On the way back, they picked up a packet of the cough sweets the old man had pretended to need, and a lemon sharp enough to make a point without labouring it, and Rowan looked at the window of a tattoo place down a side street where Brighton does what Brighton always had, and he smiled and did not go in, and the leaf on his wrist did not mutter, and the chain in his pocket behaved. They were past the season of wanting to test doors because the first door had come when it needed to and told all the other doors to wait or be more polite. At home, the rope around the apple tree had tightened itself in the rain and then slackened and then done nothing except be a rope. The hut would not be razed without giving up a fight, but the nature of the fight had already been set by the room itself: cake, chairs, speaking plainly, no one pretending to be cleverer because their language had more syllables.

The following week the fox brought them a bus ticket with a smear of engine oil and the smell of aniseed, and a child's drawing of a wren with legs far too long for honesty, and a tiny plastic whistle from a Christmas cracker. The bus ticket said PACES LANE in the place that meant destination and neither of them had been to Paces Lane or believed it had ever existed until it turned out to be a small road behind the allotments where the launderette with the stubborn machine sat emitting steam like a magician who had lost his rabbit. The launderette’s owner was a woman with forearms like parliaments who looked at the whistle and the long-legged wren and the two men and put her hand on her hip with the air of someone who had been expecting being asked to share her room with a story. They made an appointment for a Thursday to come back when she shut early. She told them there would be tea and a rule about never opening the large machine on the end because if you let certain cycles out halfway through they become weather. They went home and the town put on its dusk the way teenagers put on hoodies, sheepishly and with intent.

Summer began to do that thing summers always do where they threaten to be their parents and then betray them with rain, and the basil bolted and Rowan forgave it and ate its flowers and pronounced them charming despite being almost no food at all. The council sent another letter with an invitation to say further things in a survey that would make no difference until it did. Jake stood under the apple tree one evening and listened to a very specific hum in the hedge and understood that his days were making a braid that could be held without tying it into a knot that might later cut. He thought of the boy inside the chalk and honoured that version of himself by not visiting him again just to prove he could. He thought of the Derby rail and the tiny new planet of history that had been made in the space of a breath and a hand. He thought of his grandmother, who had believed passionately in hospitality for saints and for kettles and for people who claimed not to be either, and he felt her in his thumbs when he pressed dough, which meant he was still doing everything right that mattered.

The next time they went to the hut, the map had acquired a small blue scribble in the place where the launderette would have been if the map had allowed it to exist; it was not smug about its new knowledge, and that was important. The chairs had rearranged themselves as if anticipating a gathering of people who say the best things after meetings, when they have their coats on and their hands on door handles and their sentences turn into confessions because there is less time to argue. Rowan made the tea and left a cup by the whiteboard in case the room wanted to practise being a person, and Jake laid the coins from his pocket in a line on the windowsill that faced the place in the sky where the light gets tired last. They didn’t need a ritual; they had rituals everywhere now, the kind that look like breath and cake and the rights of chairs and the duty of rope. The thin hum of something larger than them being pleased turned up briefly, then minded its own business, which is all anyone should ever want from gods.

They spoke, that afternoon, about lines in a way that had no need of metaphors. Rowan confessed that he wanted to write his name on the inside of his skull in something that could not be scrubbed out by other people’s ideas of him and had put a leaf on his skin as practice, and Jake confessed that he had spent years thinking his only ethical option was to be a wall other people could lean on, when in fact it turned out he could be a gate and open and shut with a purpose. They agreed that they would not put rules on one another and they would enforce the ones the world needed for as long as their knees held out and after, if necessary, with sticks. They said nothing about the future because speaking about futures makes them competitive when you don’t intend it, and in the quiet after that sort of conversation you can hear the house grin and accept you into the society of those who have decided to live in it together rather than adjacent.

When their Thursday came and the launderette shut early and the steam learned that it had to behave, they went with their tin and their rope and their unreasonably good torch and found that rooms can happen in the ugliest places and prettiest too if you let them. The machine at the end was a door the size of a drum and the hum you get when a thousand shirts have agreed to enact pity. The woman with forearms like parliaments showed them her stash of buttons that the machines had confessed and gave them the good stool that had learned more about time than half the priests in Surrey. The wren with the long legs turned out to be a drawing of a map if you tilted your head, and Paces Lane revealed a place where people had mended each other’s sleeves for twenty years and had not noticed they had built a sanctuary. The chain on Rowan’s wrist warmed like cutlery in hot water and the leaf on his skin did its small nod and all three of them, because three is a number rooms approve of, stepped into a version of the launderette where the machines beat time like polite drums and the air held a wet clean that you can inhale when you’ve been told that your life will be dirt and have decided that that was never in the terms and conditions.

By the time they came home and laid their keys on the table as if they had invented the concept of coming back to the same place multiple times in one life, evening had begun to lay claims on the corners. Everything smelled of whatever you would call luck if you were ashamed of the word. The fox looked at them from the path with an expression that could be translated as I am bored of this, bring me new trinkets, and then showed them a slow blink that meant he had seen them pick up a boy and leave a map and rescue a sink, and was prepared, grudgingly, to include them in his roundup of the day’s credible shifts in the universe. Jake, who had never thought of himself as a person in charge of anything larger than his own set of mugs, kissed Rowan under the apple tree with the sort of kiss you give to a person you have agreed with about the content of rooms, and the rain delayed itself for the duration because there is etiquette even in the sky if you act as if there is and enforce it with tea.Chapter Nine

The storm that came in July did not announce itself with grand gestures or theatrical lighting. It turned up early in the morning like a tradesman who did not believe in phoning first, put its bag down by the door and began taking things apart to see how they worked. The sky had the wrong texture, too close and oddly creased, and the birds in the hedge were all late for something and unhappy about it. By ten o’clock, the first peel of thunder rolled over Epsom without bothering to make its voice quotable. By eleven, the electricity had decided it was taking a vow of silence and the kettle developed principles. The basil took on the personality of a person who had lit a candle believing in the power of intention and was annoyed to find that candles have no inherent union with weather.

They were ready in the ordinary ways before they had to be ready in the other ones. Jake had a torch with the right sort of beam and a bag packed with what the house thought was sensible for adventures: a packet of ginger biscuits that opened as if it had decided to be generous, two jumpers that could look official at a moment’s notice, a pencil that had lived a happy old age in the kitchen drawer and still had fight in it, and the twine that had learned not to get tangled simply from watching them. Rowan added a rag to wipe his hands with and a small plastic tub of salt because it seemed polite to bring a weather offering to a building that was about to have opinions.

By lunchtime, the town was punctuated by the small civic disasters that prove civilization: lights out in the underpass, an elderly man with his corner lamp switched off mid-crossword having to guess whether the word for “uplifted” was “elate” or “raise,” fridges getting philosophical, the traffic lights dealing cards in a new pattern that made everyone consider walking for once. The library had darkened in a way that made the stacks look like a forest pretending to be kind, and the three teenagers Jake had shooed out twenty minutes before sat on the steps wearing the expressions of people who would pretend to be fine with the end of the world until it interfered with their plans to buy crisps. Calls came and went; the council hotline coughed and was quiet and then coughed again, and the woman from the launderette on Paces Lane left a message that sounded like she had been standing by a drum beat and politely trying to talk over it.

They went to her first because machines that hum are a better conversation than people who panic. Shirin Ansari had her sleeves pushed up as if arguing with the very idea of sleevelessness, and the air inside the launderette was thick with a heat that had not been authorized by any thermostat. The machine at the end that she had warned them about had developed a song. It was not unmelodious, but it had too much insistence for comfort, the way certain lullabies are meant to work on mothers more than babies. The drum turned, then hesitated, then turned again, and if a person were the kind to translate, they would have said it was trying to speak and had not worked out what of.

Shirin handed Rowan a tea towel as if offering him a glove before a bout, glared at the ceiling as if that would make it stop leaking somewhere else, and said, “Somebody’s put a duvet in it when they know I told them, and it’s stopped on rinse with a mind of its own. It keeps drawing cups of water from nothing. I turned the stopcock off; it didn’t notice. It’s not the fuse. It’s not the pump. It’s a thought.” She turned her gaze on Jake with an expression that would have convicted him of getting above himself if he had been a fuse. “Do your thing,” she said, as if telling him to take his shoes off in a mosque.

Jake crouched by the machine and placed his hand on its enamel with the kind of serious frivolity that machines respect. The hum came up into his skin and found the bit of him that was good at catching tune, and he found the bit of it that was a little boy with their hands over their ears in a room full of well-meaning adults. It was not danger; it was a line failing to connect with itself, a thread that had been pulled through a multi-wash cycle and now pretended it was there on purpose. He closed his eyes because that sometimes helped the world think he had fewer distractions, and let the pattern reveal. The song ran away down the pipes and into a dark, brick-throated space that belonged to a bygone utility and had not been asked to do anything interesting since 1969. From there, it joined a wider hum—the town’s infrastructure doing its version of the Lord’s Prayer—and found, nested in the hum, a knot that had been tied by people who wanted to be helpful and had never been supervised by a fox.

He opened his eyes not because he was done but because he had remembered how much he liked Rowan in high weather. “It’s connected to something that was left halfway through being built,” he said, and Shirin made a skeptical noise that had saved lives. “Here,” he added, tapping the fascia with two fingers. “It’s pulling from another room the way one person’s grief pulls plates out of your cupboards until you realize you haven’t anything left to serve with.”

“Pipes,” Shirin said, translating Jake into plumber. “If you tell me which wall to swear at, I’ll go at it with a wrench.”

“Not pipes,” Rowan said, who was listening to the way the drums made the air move. “Strings. The sort people tie across themselves to make their back behave. If you fill a room with tied strings and then a machine asks for water, the room will try to help out of habit. Not because it’s obedient. Because it’s generous.”

Shirin made a face like a woman who had never been entirely persuaded by generosity. “Someone’s put thread where it doesn’t belong,” she said. “And now all my pants are going to get opinions.” She wiped her hands on her own tea towel out of fairness and nodded at the back door. “You’ll want the service alley. Wear sense.”

The service alley behind the launderette had its own weather. It was close enough to the bricks to be intimate, damp in a way that suggested it always kept a secret back in case you were going to ask for another. The drains sang a little and the bins were full of other people’s decisions. Behind the metal gate that had been painted a pale blue by someone who had never recovered from their fondness for their first bicycle was a small square of the town that the town had forgotten deliberately. It was a place of old stacks of crates and buckets that had learned to be philosophical and an untidy skein of twine tied across from pipes to hook and back to metre box in a pattern that would have made a spider insulted. The twine was thin, the sort you buy to make brown paper parcels more moral, and it had knots that had been tied by someone good at tying if not good at leaving things alone.

Rowan went straight to the centre of the skein the way a man goes to the centre of a thicket, not bravely, with knowledge of scratches. He put his wrists under the most complicated bit and let the skin of his forearms learn the pattern. “This is not one person,” he murmured. “It’s several lots of someone. You can tell by how the knots are. These ones were done in a hurry by a pair of hands that had recently learned to bake. These ones are as careful as a maths teacher trying not to scare teenagers. And these ones—” he batted lightly at two bad-tempered kinks in the twine “—these ones are the work of a person who did Guides once and misremembered all the fun on purpose.”

Jake stood quietly and let the Force get a word in. The skein tugged at his patience with a familiarity he did not enjoy. It had the same tone—the same smugness of being useful—that the map in the studio had held, the one they had not let into Rowan’s skin. It was not the same hand; the studio had thought about intent and this had thought about outcome and would discuss ethics only after someone made biscuits. Still, the shape of the thought was too close for comfort. Someone had been making a network to make the town easier, to let rooms speak to each other with less fuss, to see if the green of the Downs could be persuaded to share a little more of itself with the narrow shop on the corner where lights forget their responsibilities. It was the generous project of someone who had not been told their generosity had limits. He had liked people like that as a younger man, all yearning and string. He had been people like that. He knelt and the rain hit his hair and ran into his collar and he put his two hands into the web as if demonstrating how to hold a hen, and the knots loosened because nice knots do when they believe you are not going to throw them away.

Shirin leaned on the door frame and watched with the air of a person at a doctor’s appointment where the doctor had turned out to be a good storyteller and a competent liar. “You going to leave me with none at all?” she asked, when the web had dropped two inches and the humming in her machine turned into a nervous cough. “Because I don’t mind mending, but if you take out the bit that means my Tuesdays work, I shall put a word in with all the saints I don’t believe in.”

“Not none,” Jake said. “Just enough to stop the machine thinking it is connected to every drain in Epsom and also the sea.” He leaned, he altered, he put one small thing back and took one small thing out and the web learned something about humility. Rowan slid a knot into an easier shape and the line at his wrist—leaf vein, pulse—warmed to the thought of a system being persuaded to become kinder. The storm cracked overhead abruptly like an old man’s joke and the machine inside gave up pretending to be a river and became an excellent tool again. Shirin nodded once as if she had bought a car and kicked all its tyres and found none of them ghastly, and went back in to inspect her wash with the suspicion that keeps cities tidy. When the three of them had confirmed that towels would be towels in the morning, she came back and observed their handiwork with a face that belonged to both Parliament and kitchen. “You left enough string for children,” she said, which was her best blessing, and then, because she was not someone who merely bore witness and washed cups, added, “There’s been a woman. Long coat, wrong shoes for this kind of floor, hair like a threat. She’s been coming in with a bag that clinks. Pinned the first bit of string back there like she was doing an exam and didn’t want to show her working. She smiles like the radio. Don’t like her. She’s got hands like she knows what all the sockets in a house are for.”

“Did she sign her name to anything?” Rowan asked, already knowing she had not because people who tie secret beneficial knots do not leave their surnames in biro by the fused spur.

“Left a scent,” Shirin said, and even if she meant perfume they all of them thought of green ink. “And a card in the charity shop for a thing called Walk-In Wish, which you would avoid if you had sense.”

“We are making it a habit,” Jake said, standing and wiping his hands and feeling the web in his chest relax into something he would permit to be called pride. “But if she comes back, do you mind if I see her?”

“I’ll take money off her,” Shirin said. “I won’t take any of her sentences. She can come and hang her threads but if she puts them over the fire exit I’ll send her to you with a carrier bag of socks to sort as penance.”

They left the launderette with the rain rearranged into an acceptable companion. The electricity across the town had perked back into a semblance of work, the kind it does when it suspects everyone is comparing it to candles, and the light in the charity shop defending fish knives blinked twice and then got its act together. Maris was in the doorway of a shop that had not been Ink & Bone until you looked and found that, temporarily at least, it was. She had a scarf to prove the weather to anyone who doubted and eyes that sent apologies ahead and behind her like good diplomats. She caught sight of them and decided to look instead at something lower down in case attention proved to be an act of theft. It is a pleasure to be in a town full of people who know how to be wary without getting dull.

“Your friend,” she said, when they joined her under the lintel that had seen most of their problems, and by your friend she did not mean Rowan’s father. “She is doing something unhelpful with rope. Not the shop. Don’t worry about the shop. I am not so naïve as to keep that thing’s wine glasses in a room with my heart.” She made a face that was both proud and embarrassed. “I thought when we moved I would be grander,” she added. “Turns out I am happier being smaller. Happier when I add one wren to your man’s arm and then go home and fry an onion like the heroine of a good poem. The thing about grand is it wants to eat everything. It is never not hungry. I have spent enough time hungry not to be flattered.”

“Walk-In Wish?” Jake asked. “Or has she found a new sign to write?”

Maris pursed her mouth and unpursed it without judgement. “They call it the Wish for short,” she said. “It’s a van some days and a kiosk others. It gives out paper promises tied with green thread and tells people to make a wish and walks away with what people use to wish for. You know this. You know the price. We’ve all made that trade when we are young and tell no one about it in case they take away the wish and leave us with something worse, which is the knowledge that the wish was never the point. She’s a collector. She has a face people like telling their endings to.”

Rowan grunted, not unfriendly. “We’ll go look,” he said. “If only to make sure she’s not parked across the drop kerb outside the library.”

“Do,” Maris said, and her hand came briefly up to touch his sleeve the way women do when they don’t mean to tell you to be careful and do it anyway. “Because if what she wants is a network all over this town with knots she can pull around her little finger, she is only a woman. But the thing she has convinced is with her is not. You will forgive me if I do not name it in the street.”

“You don’t have to name things to make them show up,” Jake said, and she smiled as if he had repeated one of her own sermons back to her and got the cadence right.

They found the van by the bandstand with a queue of women whose hair betrayed their opinions and a child trying to find the bravery to ask for a dog. The paint on the side of it had been done by someone with a steady hand who had earned the right to make deliberate mistakes. Wishes tied to string hung like a veil from the awning and made a sound not unlike rain when people brushed past. The woman inside wore a coat of the kind that says city while your shoes say give me a break. Her hair was a glossy advertisement for arguments about hair. Her hands were the right sort for the life Maris had assigned her: patient, capable of removing the lid from any jar in a kitchen, interested in rings that could cut. She talked to the queue in the tone of person who could run a quiz night without help. It was not the sigil on the wall. It was not the map. It was a cousin with a borrowing habit.

Rowan looked at Jake and they did not have the conversation out loud because the town felt too eavesdroppy for that and on certain afternoons it is merciful to keep one’s cleverness off the pavement. He had that open look he got when he had decided he would not let a person make him smaller by being big in a room. Jake had already worked out the half-sentence that would sit between whatever the woman said and the rope she was trying to throw to his friend’s belt. He had the unhelpful advantage of seeing how this particular afternoon could be made to take almost any shape, and also the bit of handicap which is that seeing all the shapes doesn’t tell you which one would be kindest to everyone else’s story. He put his hand lightly in the small of Rowan’s back as if he were an umbrella you lent to a person you loved without conditions.

They joined the queue. The women in front did not roll their eyes at them because they were not the kind of women who needed to turn strangers into performances. One of them pointed at Rowan’s leaf and said quietly that it was tasteful, a word she intended as praise and he accepted as if it were. When they got to the front, the woman in the van leaned forward into the shape of someone who would give you the name of a good dentist without boasting. She assessed them with a speed that would have done credit to an accident and emergency nurse. She smiled at Jake in the way you smile at a person you intend to tell they can stop wanting what they want so much and be happy, and she smiled at Rowan like a cat being patient with a child.

“Welcome to the Wish,” she said. “For a small donation I can take one thing off your heart and put it somewhere it won’t bruise any more. I’ll tie you a token and you’ll carry the knowledge instead of the ache.”

“That is not what knowledge likes,” Rowan said, gently. “It thinks bruises are part of the point.”

She laughed, pleased, and put a bowl in front of them for coins as if coins had not had enough to do today. “The funny ones,” she said. “You’re always my favourites.” She put a piece of card on the counter and pushed it so that it stopped exactly in front of Jake’s hand. “Tell me what you want to stop wanting.”

“I have learned to live with wanting,” Jake said, because perhaps it was not the afternoon for performing humility. He put a pound and a piece of gingham ribbon from his pocket in the bowl because money is a language and so is charm. “You’ve been down Paces Lane,” he added, conversationally. “You’ve strung the draughts behind the launderette like a harp because you’re a little bit in love with the sound it makes. You’re good at knots but not good at thinking of who has to trip over them when they’ve been left hanging.”

She banked the pound and took the ribbon and made the smallest frown because being seen is always uncomfortable even when you charge for it. “Who looks after you?” she asked, suddenly. “Does he? Because you’ve got the look of a man who takes care of a lot of corners on behalf of other people and then never quite gets to the middle of his own room.”

Rowan swallowed a laugh because it was accurate which didn’t make it nice. “I do my little bit,” he said. “He does more of his than he says. He does it politely.”

The woman’s gaze snapped to the leaf on Rowan’s wrist and softened a fraction the way we all of us soften when we see something tender that has survived a week. “It’s a good mark,” she said. “I couldn’t have done it better myself.”

“You didn’t,” Rowan said and smiled so that the kindness had a little competent tooth. “If you’re collecting strings, stop running them past the drains. Find something that can carry stories without getting saturated. Knit them to a place where people expect to put down and pick up and move along.”

She tilted her head. “Like a church hall,” she said. “But not a church. A place where the floor forgives.”

“The hut,” Jake said, because naming a place can be a gift if you do it with both hands.

“The hut,” the woman repeated. She rolled the word in her mouth as if tasting the varnish. “I’m not your enemy,” she added, and it was either true or the kind of lie people tell when they are trying to convince themselves that what they want is a by-product of good. “I just hate it when rooms waste themselves by belonging only to one kind of person.”

“So do we,” Rowan said. “That’s why we tidy chairs and make tea and put notices where eyes fall. If you promise not to turn your threads into a net, we will not cut them. If you promise to ask rooms before you ask people, we will stop putting our hands into your knots. If you don’t promise, we will come back here with a bag of washing and take our patience out on your van.”

She made a face as if to be offended and could not quite manage it. “All right,” she said. “But if you two collect rooms and then keep them like shoes you don’t want anyone else to scuff, I’ll come into your house and rearrange your teaspoons.”

“We’re not spoon-proud,” Jake said, and she believed him enough to let go the green thread in her hand so that it lay in loops not longing to harden into lines. The wish tokens rubbed against each other softly and the woman reached for one and tied it on the van’s awning where a sparrow could laugh at it later. “What would you take off our hearts,” he asked, curious despite himself, “if we gave you a pound more?”

“The bit of you that looks for the end of a day as if endings were the point,” she said, to him. “And the bit of you that thinks if a thing isn’t hard you haven’t earned it,” she said, to Rowan. Then she shook her head as if she had embarrassed herself and said, “Go home. The storm’s over the top of the water now. It’ll behave itself as long as no one shows off.”

They left the bandstand and the van and the queue of women who did not need their commentary and made their way along pavements that had not yet confessed their puddles to the evening. The launderette hummed like a contented mother with a baby that had finally burped. The basil in the kitchen had forgiven, temporarily, living in a house where weather was allowed inside. The hut would not be renewed without their cooperation, but that fight was not the afternoon’s. The leaf on Rowan’s wrist had settled and the chain in his pocket made the occasional intriguing citizenship ceremony against his keys and then forgot itself. They put their damp coats on the backs of chairs and sat on the floor with their backs against the sofa like students of an institution that had invented being tired and done it beautifully.

There was a knock at the door, not timid, not hostile, the knock of a person who believes in the right of doors to behave like doors and will fight them later if necessary. Jake stood because he was nearer and opened it and his grandmother did not stand there because she was sensible about that sort of thing. Rowan’s father stood there, all the height of him and the width and the wire fence tattoo like a joke he had grown out of. He looked older than he had in the hospital and younger than he had on the phone. He had brought a plastic bag with the kind of essentials you can never admit are essential—bread, two bananas, a plunger—and he offered the plunger to Rowan as if to acknowledge the household had better plumbing and worse illusions than his own.

“I was out,” he said, not apologizing and not pronouncing any words carefully on purpose, “and a storm doesn’t respect people who live alone. I thought of that woman once, with her twine on a tree, and I wondered what would happen if I knocked. Then I thought nothing good would happen, and I knocked anyway. This is a good door. You can tell by the noise it made when I did that.”

“You can come in,” Rowan said, and it was not generous and not reluctant and not resigned. It was a sentence like a plank he had nailed into place on his own porch. He took the bag and put the plunger by the sink with a reverence that made a joke of nothing. He leaned, just a little, towards the man who had made him and failed him and learned recently how to handle a kettle. “You can sit,” he added. “You won’t like the chairs. They don’t have things to complain about.”

Rowan’s father sat and tested the chair and found that the chair had made up its mind to work and was going to do so whether or not he found fault. He put his hands on his knees and looked at the floor and then at the leaf on his son’s wrist and then at Jake. He did not appreciate the leaf because he had yet to learn how to appreciate anything that did not claim his attention, but he did register it as a decision and found it improved his opinion of the person who had made it. “I watch the telly in the daytime now,” he said, as if confessing to a priest, and Jake did not turn his head into a smile for fear of making the room lopsided. “I make the tea when it’s not necessary. I left my back door open because of a story you told me and I’ve been thinking that perhaps the door wasn’t where the risk was. Perhaps it was the way I was closing everything in myself that made the house go small. I am not good at not being sure. Does that get easier.”

“You get better at making soup when you can’t be sure what’s in the cupboard,” Jake said, and the man snorted unwillingly because actual brains know good advice when they hear it even if pride has to book a separate seat.

They fed him and he ate with the precise irritation of a person who has never learned how to be grateful without turning it into acquiescence. He watched while Rowan washed up in a manner that was not an apology for doing women’s work because the only work that belongs to one person in this house is the thinking and they share that. He asked a question about the rope on the apple tree as if it were a dog tie and was rewarded with an explanation that functioned as an invitation to look out of the window next time you want to name what keeps you honest. He did not say sorry with his mouth and it would not have been useful if he had. He did say, when he stood at the door to go back to Brighton because a man has to keep habits for a while to diagnose the ones that need breaking, “I saw that you were someone’s friend on the telly. I won’t pretend I know how to say the right thing about that. I know how to say that I hope whoever that was knows what they’ve got. I know how to say nothing too.”

After he had gone and the door had made its small end-of-episode noise and the house had stretched its corners in relief at being asked once again to keep fewer ghosts than necessary, they sat at the table and wrote on a square of paper that lives had become, organically, the sort of thing that can be managed by a list. It was nothing like the surveys of the council and everything like the instructions you leave for a friend who is looking after your house when you finally give in and go away for three days. Water the basil only when it asks, they wrote. The fox likes cake more than meat; don’t let him talk you out of that. The hut answers to please, never to how much. If the machine hums, listen before touching the plug. Hang the washing in the spare room on Wednesday because Wednesday has always been good with towels. If someone brings you a plunger, say thank you like it’s a relic. Keep a pound and a ribbon in your pocket; you will need one even if you think you don’t. Don’t be funny when the room needs quiet. Be funny when people need air. It made a short piece of common sense and a long comfort. They put it on the fridge behind the lemon magnet because the lemon had earned its place through maintaining its good influence on everyone’s punctuation.

The next day dawned with a sky so clean you could see yesterday drying on the line. Shirin had left a bag on their gate with a hand towel inside embroidered with a wren with outrageously long legs so that if anyone had been looking for omens they could have declared themselves satisfied. Maris had pushed a card through the letterbox that said, simply, tell rooms what you can carry, and they put it under the fruit bowl because the fruit bowl had started to be the place where counsel gathered. The van with the wishes had moved on and the threads it had left in the trees were being used by two starlings to have a serious conversation with their nest.

When they went to the hut, the notice about renewal had attracted four blue dots in the corner, done by a biro that had got hot and loved it, which meant men with opinions had been there. The chairs were arranged as if expecting women who translate other people’s sentences into action. On the map, by Tattenham Corner, a tiny plastic whistle had appeared, set carefully on a drawing pin so that it might be useful at the right moment. Jake imagined the boy at the rail, thirty years from now, parent to a child with knees that go sideways and a laugh that is a menu of weather, telling a small person that wishes are what you make afterwards when you’ve done the thing you were afraid of, and he felt he could carry that.

Rowan stood with his hands behind his back and read the room with an accuracy that would have been scientific if he had liked science. “People are going to come here and tell it their problems now,” he said. “Not just children. Not just us. People with plasters and people with maps. We will have to be committee without losing the ability to be daft.”

“We can be daft,” Jake said. “The daftness is structural. It’s our heritage and our right. Also our obligation. If we stop being daft, the fox will form a union.”

“He already has,” Rowan said. “We pay him in cake and silence. It’s a good contract.” He reached for Jake’s hand because rooms approve of hands held when plans are made about them, and they stood like that with the map’s green making the whiteboard look less lonely and the whistle promising that if anyone remembered to carry it in their pocket there would be a day when its use would be both appropriate and triumphant. They were, beyond any of this, two people in a town that had decided not to refuse them any longer. They were, inside that, men who had each found a door in a body that had thought it was a cupboard. They had time and they had rooms and they had rope and they had a basil plant that would never, ever be satisfied. On that basis, they were, by any measure, extremely rich.
