     "novel_text": "The thing about columns and rows is they\u2019ll accept anything as long as you feed them with a certain obedience. Numbers don\u2019t ask about the drift between your shoulder blades when you wake at three. They let you bring the coffee to your lips (or pretend to) and sit in your chair and tell yourself that you are good at this, that you, Deirdre Keene, are reliable. Spreadsheets do not wonder what you meant to say last week and couldn\u2019t. They do not ask why, sometimes, you forget the taste of sugar.\n\nOn Monday mornings in Little Rock the air along Main Street sticks. There\u2019s the little bakery where the baker, a woman named Freda who always wore bright scarves no matter the humidity, rolled out dough behind the window. The men under the flyovers had their guitars and greasy caps and this way of watching traffic like the river was lodged inside the windshield glass. Our office had a blinking sign with KEEFE & BOONE, CPAs stuttering through the heat like a cheap promise. I\u2019d arrive before anyone else, because the office felt cleaner with the lights off, because there are forms of silence you can only catch before eight a.m. I liked to slide into my chair, set my bag down like I was setting down a pet rabbit, lift my hands above the keyboard. That first settling, as if I might breathe myself into the grid.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re early again,\u201d Tasha would say when she came in at eight\u2013thirteen, a stack of mail and her purse knocked against her hip. Tasha is the kind who laughs with her front teeth, and if you tell her a secret she will carry it around like a warm roll in a napkin. Put it on a plate later and ask if you want butter.\n\n\u201cI like the quiet,\u201d I said on that particular Monday. \u201cHelps me remember what I meant to do.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat you meant to do was send the Hudson inventory sheet, your noon meeting is Mr. Ellison\u2014oh wait, no, not Ellison. Something else. You know what? I\u2019ll print your schedule. You hungry?\u201d\n\nShe said hungry with her mouth buttery. I said I already had a piece of toast, which wasn\u2019t exactly true. I had lifted the toast to my mouth and held it there until I could smell it. I thought I could smell it. Burnt edges, salt of the butter. When I finally set it down there was no bite mark. I didn\u2019t feel like thinking about that part.\n\nMr. Boone shuffled in a little after nine, straight from his car, tie still folded on the passenger seat, hair laid flat like he\u2019d ironed it with a book. He peeked into my office. \u201cDeirdre. We\u2019ve got\u2014did Tasha tell you? The school board wants an extension. The young woman with the neon shoes called and said they\u2019ve got an auditor coming Monday next, so not to expect\u2014\"\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll draft the extension,\u201d I said, fingers already reaching for the letterhead. \u201cDo we have their updated totals on revenue from events?\u201d\n\n\u201cAsk my son, if he ever remembers to show up,\u201d Mr. Boone said. His son never remembered to show up. Sometimes I wondered if the son was a myth. \u201cAnd Deirdre,\u201d he added, voice softer, \"how was yesterday?\"\n\nHe always asked that. He asked it because my father and his wife, Vivian, invited everyone in the building to the barbeque yesterday, to make a thing of my father\u2019s one-year sobriety chip. I brought coleslaw in a green bowl and smiled and smiled, the kind of smile you put on the counter and slice into pieces. I tried not to look at the backyard and the way the shadows seemed thicker than shade.\n\n\u201cIt was fine,\u201d I said. \u201cThe ribs were a hit.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood. Good. Tell your dad he tells the best jokes and that none of us believe half his stories, but that\u2019s half his charm.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the charm is the other half.\u201d It was a joke from the night before and he laughed like he recognized the echo.\n\nHe left. Tasha printed my schedule and held it in her hands like she would give me the keys to a car, her nails a fresh raspberry color. \u201cYou\u2019ve got an eleven with Teague Caldwell about the signage business, a Zoom at one, then you were going to go over to your dad\u2019s for a minute, if I remember, because\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause I said I would fix the lawnmower,\u201d I finished. \u201cI lied. I can't fix the lawnmower.\u201d\n\n\u201cUse your \u2018I have sensitive wrists\u2019 excuse.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have that excuse.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou could. It fits you. Dainty wrists, strong opinions.\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t correct her. I took the schedule and pretended to look it over. On the corner she\u2019d drawn a little sailboat. She does that when she\u2019s thinking about leaving town, even if only in a picture. The boat had a crooked mast. The word GO was scribbled under it.\n\nThere isn\u2019t an ocean anywhere near Little Rock, not really, no matter how much the Arkansas River pretends. But I grew up with postcards of coastlines because my mother sent them from California when she remembered, which was every four months or eight or twenty. My father would tape them to the fridge. Your mother thinks of you, he would say, as if thinking were a thick coat you could wrap around me. The postcards had pelicans and fog and lines of tiny houses on cliffs like petits fours. The edges curled and caught pizza grease and the smell of winter potatoes. I touched the glossy sand and thought my fingers might taste like salt.\n\nI didn\u2019t meet Mara until we were both twenty-two. She arrived in our house as if the house had been waiting for her, like her footsteps always belonged there. My father called me from his office one afternoon. He said, \u201cI have something surprising but good, I think good. I want you to meet someone.\u201d\n\n\u201cLike a dog?\"\n\nHe laughed, caught, then quiet, like he wanted to be brave. \u201cLike a person.\u201d\n\nIt was a restaurant with black napkins and the kind of light that wanted you to be lonely but not alone. He had Vivian beside him, small, fingers wrapped in rings like vines. Vivian\u2019s daughter sat across from them, looking like she had been put in that chair by a pair of careful hands. Mara Ellison. That is where the name belonged, in a sentence like that, as if the book had finally turned the page to reveal the name italicized. She had a cardigan with two missing buttons and a small scar on her chin that made her face somehow true.\n\nMara looked at me, then at the bread plate, then back at me, as if calibrating. \u201cMy mother talks very fast,\u201d she said by way of hello, and I laughed, and the two of us fell into talking like people who have already survived something together. We had not. But that energy was in the room, like an aftertaste.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m an x-ray tech,\u201d she said, tearing her bread in a way that made crumbs like snow. \u201cI like looking at the ghost-map of people.\u201d\n\nMy father coughed. \u201cYou like being able to see inside people,\" he corrected, like she had made a faux pas. She shrugged.\n\n\u201cNo, I said what I meant,\u201d Mara said, but then smiled at him like she was sorry for being herself. \u201cI grew up in Florida,\u201d she added. \u201cI\u2019m still getting used to not smelling salt in the morning. That sounds pretentious. Sorry.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt does, but I forgive you,\u201d I said. There was the river. There were the postcards. My childhood lived between water and the idea of water. \u201cWe have the river,\u201d I told her. \u201cWhen it\u2019s hot, and the air heavy, if you close your eyes on the Junction Bridge you can hear the ocean pretending.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not how pretending works,\u201d she said softly.\n\n\u201cMaybe it is.\u201d\n\nShe stared at me until it felt like the stare went through and through, like those films she developed. Later, when Vivian and my father had their heads close, telling each other a story without words, Mara and I leaned on the railing outside the restaurant. A delivery truck breathed out a moan down by the alley and teenagers clumped past like birds. The sky had gone that gummy mauve it gets in August, the air thought it was syrup.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad we\u2019re the same age,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cMe too,\u201d I said. I meant: me too, that makes this all less strange. I meant: we could have been anything. I didn\u2019t mean the thing I would mean later.\n\nWe became family quickly, which is to say we tripped into each other's patterns and then pretended to have meant to do it. On Sundays, Vivian made pancakes and put berries into little white bowls as if berries deserve to be handled like jewels. My father pretended he knew anything about cars and so did I. Mara corrected us and actually fixed the thing we were staring at. She had thick hair that smelled like applesauce or at least my memory told me it did. We went to the dog park even though we did not have a dog, to point at the dogs and say that one, not that one, that one. We took my father to a meeting in a church basement where a man named Beau with bright eyes hugged him and said \u201cKeep coming back\u201d like a spell. We came back, all of us, and then back again.\n\nIt is a way of saying that we were a family before my father and Vivian got the paper. It is a way of saying the paper changed the vocabulary and not the thing. While we signed documents at a courthouse that had too much echo, while Vivian cried and my father wiped at her nose with a cocktail napkin, Mara took a photo of the four of us and put it online with the caption new math. The likes stacked up, little blue thumbs in a parade. I sat on the steps and looked at it and felt weirdly tall and then small as a bird. Sometimes I felt like my palms were empty, even when they held my purse and the rubber stamp and my keys.\n\nAt work, the green numbers slid straight and I got raises that didn't feel like anything. At home, I watched Mara carry a plant from room to room looking for the light like she was practicing something. When she got a job at the hospital three exits down, she brought her scrubs home and threw them in the corner and took her shoes off and tried to shake off all the bones she had looked at during the day. \u201cAnkle,\u201d she would say, rotating her hand like a compass. \u201cRadius. A snapped rib that looked like bent chalk. The art of what isn't heart failure. A boy who keeps tripping over his cat and swears it\u2019s the cat\u2019s fault.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a collector,\u201d I teased.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying not to bring them home,\u201d she said, and then leaned her head on my shoulder and I forgot for a moment how to breathe. She lifted it quick, as if she noticed something had shifted and was trying to correct for it, like holding a tray someone bumped.\n\nWe were careful. That is not the same thing as being blind. We each dated, badly, like we were running errands other people wanted us to run. I sat across from a man who sold copy machines and listened to his story about going to Cabo with his college buddies. I went home and told Mara and she put her fist under her chin and listened with wide eyes and said \u201cNo,\u201d when he texted later, as if she knew the inside of me like one of her films. She went to the riverfront with a woman who sold handmade jewelry and came back with green ears. \u201cI think they were painted,\u201d she said. \u201cIt makes me mad to think about lead.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverything turns out to be painted,\u201d I said, because sometimes I can\u2019t help myself and say a line that wants to sit like a stone in the room.\n\n\u201cMaybe you mean plated?\u201d she asked, smiling.\n\n\u201cMaybe I do.\u201d\n\nI wasn\u2019t sure what I meant. Peeled grapes in a dish. A word said enough without meaning gets soft, gets mushy, you can swallow it like a pill.\n\nIf this were a different story, one with an easy moral, I could say that the first time I realized I was in love was the day Mara cut her hair. She stood in the bathroom and looked at herself the way people look at maps when the road is closed. She took the scissors and made the first hard snip, and the sound went through me like the pluck of a string. Hair fell on her shoulders and clung to her shirt, an animal that didn't want to be evicted. She turned to me with a small, almost panicked laugh. \u201cOh, this was a bad idea.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s perfect,\u201d I said, too fast, and then saw that it actually was. She was herself without the extra. Something clean and sharp and tender.\n\n\u201cIf I look like a fourteen-year-old boy, you have to tell me,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t,\u201d I said. \u201cYou look like\u2014\u201d I stopped because anything I would say might be too thoroughly true and that would change the room. \u201cYou look like yourself,\u201d I said lamely, and she rolled her eyes and threw her hair into the trash in a soft, alive pile.\n\nThere were other days that could be candidates. The day at the flea market when she held up a cracked blue plate and made a grand speech about how the crack would let the light in. The night she stood at the sink and cried at the end of a podcast, and I stood with her, two women staring into a basin of water as if trying to read it. The afternoon we both came down with norovirus and took turns being brave and it turned out she was braver and it turned out I loved her for being braver and for letting me pretend. Love doesn\u2019t arrive like a marauder. It keeps house and rearranges the chairs.\n\nOf course, there were signs I should have been seeing, too, and I saw them but decided they were not signs. When our old cat\u2014hers from Florida and ours from the minute her mother left her in our foyer with a carrier and a box of her belongings\u2014decided to ignore me and then curl himself around the leg of the couch when I sat down, as if I were air. When my breath fogged the bathroom mirror less than her breath did, even though I leaned in and huffed. When Vivian asked me, in front of the fridge, whether I remembered the day I broke my wrist at the skating rink, and I said yes and told her about the spinning, the music, the smell of nachos, and then noticed how her face rearranged and how she said, gently, \u201cHoney, that was me. I told you that story last month.\u201d\n\nI laughed too loud. \u201cI\u2019m stealing your material,\u201d I said. \u201cI knew I heard it somewhere.\u201d\n\nThe night after my father fell off the wagon\u2014three days and then it just as suddenly was over; Beau's hug seemed to work like a hand on a thermostat\u2014we sat in the backyard in the dark, Mara and me, feet bare, grass like a damp towel. It had rained and everything smelled like the underside of the world. She said, \u201cI keep dreaming of a shore. Like wooden steps and algae. I can hear someone calling down the beach. It\u2019s not Florida. It\u2019s\u2014\"\n\n\u201cCold,\u201d I said without meaning to. \u201cThe wind comes in with teeth. The foam is brown. There\u2019s a pier with a shuttering board on the end. You always want to look over but you know you won\u2019t like what\u2019s there.\u201d\n\nShe stilled. \u201cHow did you know that?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don't know,\" I said, trying to laugh it off. \"Maybe I just know beaches. Maybe Tasha drew me a boat.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not funny,\u201d she said. She turned her head. Even in the dark, I felt the outline of her attention like a weight. \u201cIf you had been with me, you would know this isn\u2019t sunshine beach. It\u2019s\u2014\"\n\n\u201cSharp,\u201d I said. \u201cI know. Sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to mock.\u201d\n\nShe exhaled. \u201cYou don\u2019t. Not ever,\u201d she said, which turned out not to be true, if you count what came later as a kind of mockery, the universe\u2019s mean joke, the big bad trick. But in that moment we sat with our knees touching. She was warm, and I tried to feel the warmth like a proof of my own temperature.\n\nYou can survive for a long time by telling yourself you are simply dramatic. You can explain the flicker in the corner of your eye as screen fatigue and the way the hallway light buzzes when you walk under it as old wiring. You can say that the cashier not looking up when you hand her a bill is a symptom of modern life and not what it is: sometimes your hands don\u2019t feel like they exist even to you. For a long time I lived like this, between explanations, keeping a list in my head like grocery items. You need bread. You need milk. You need to believe in gravity.\n\nMara suggested a trip. \u201cA little one,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have four days in October when both of us can go.\u201d\n\nShe printed a map on the office printer when she stopped by to bring me a sandwich and stood in my doorway and held it up. \u201cNew Orleans?\u201d she offered, and then shrugged like she was trying on a dress. \u201cOr Gulf Shores. I know, I know, touristy. Or we could be fancy and go up the coast. We could just go to Lake Ouachita and pretend it\u2019s an ocean.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go to the ocean,\u201d I said too quick. My mouth outran me.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not a planner,\u201d she teased. \u201cI like this side of you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI look good on the coast,\u201d I said, doing my voice the way my mother had done, that self-mockery kept barely at the edge of fun. The truth is: I wanted something to end. Or to start. My life measured itself between ledgers, between other people\u2019s true stories. The ocean seemed like an honest thing. It doesn\u2019t pretend to hold.\n\nWe set the date. Vivian put three kinds of snacks in a basket and called it \u201cfor the road\u201d like we were leaving for the army. My father held my face in his hands and kissed my forehead and whispered \u201cDon\u2019t be too\u2026you,\u201d and then laughed and said, \u201cKidding. Be yourself. Always be yourself. Take care of my girls.\u201d It was a joke, but he meant it, and I watched how his expression moved like water when he looked from me to Mara and back, proud and afraid in the way of men who have learned how much they can lose.\n\nWe did all the regular road trip things. We bought Coca-Colas in glass bottles because it mattered to Mara that the bottles were glass. We sang to a playlist she had made that would probably embarrass a certain strain of person\u2014Abba next to a Portuguese fado she found online, old country next to something that sounded like it had been recorded in a closet in Queens. She told me about a patient who had, in the most patient way, explained to her the difference between cartilage and a donut. I told her about the time Mr. Boone had called me Deborah for six months and how I never corrected him because I wanted to see when the lie would run out of gas.\n\nAt a rest stop outside of Biloxi, Mara took a picture of the sky like a tourist and then of me like a spy. \u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d I said, laughing and holding my hand up and then lowering it because I wanted the picture to exist and also didn\u2019t. She showed me the photo. My mouth was half-open, like I had been about to catch a word, and my eyes were too big. The color was off, somehow, like the pictures of dead people in old houses. She clicked and clicked. In one of them, my arm looked faint, as if the sun had eaten it. \u201cThe exposure\u2019s weird,\u201d she said. \u201cMy phone\u2019s acting up.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt always acts up when you drive through low country,\u201d I told her. I would have told her anything. If she had said the moon was just a lamp held by a patient god, I would have asked if we needed to dust it.\n\nWe arrived at the coast just before sunset. It was that hour that makes storybooks feel brave, when the water isn\u2019t blue so much as a scraped metal color, scuffed and shining. The hotel was two blocks from the beach and the woman at the desk had a name tag that said SANDI with an i. She gave us two paper keys and a list of restaurants and a look like she\u2019d seen all kinds of couples and didn\u2019t commit any of them to paper. We threw our bags on the top of the bedspread like we had been taught not to and ran down to the shore.\n\nIt is foolish to say the sand looked like sugar, but it did, and my feet remembered something my brain did not. The ocean had its whole complicated body out in front of us, doing its math. Mara stood with her arms crossed against the wind and let out a laugh like she couldn\u2019t help it. \u201cThis is so stupidly good,\u201d she said. A little boy ran past with a kite that couldn\u2019t decide what it wanted to do. An old woman held her shoes in her hand like a bouquet. A couple took turns taking pictures of each other with the horizon like a dare.\n\n\u201cI want to swim,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cIn your jeans? The water\u2019s cold.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d I said, which is something I often say when it isn\u2019t. I rolled my pants up and went in to my calves and then to my knees, and something in me went still. The water wasn\u2019t cold enough to be a shocking cold. It was the kind of cold that made your bones ring. I walked out until my jeans were heavy and I thought of all the times, as a kid, I put my feet in the tub and pretended it was a shoreline and let my father teasingly complain about the water on the floor. I thought: you are the kind of woman who comes to the shore and doesn\u2019t know how to behave.\n\nMara held back because her mother\u2019s voice lived in her somewhere and said you catch a chill fast. She stood with her shoes looped on her fingers like a second pair of lungs and watched me. \u201cDeirdre,\u201d she said, like a warning, and also like a poem. The light made it hard to see her face. For a blink, the horizon bent. This happens sometimes when your eyes decide they will not be bossed.\n\nI didn\u2019t go far, but when the wave reached past my knees and pulled, for an instant it was like something under the surface had my ankles between two fingers. Stronger than I\u2019d expected. I sucked my breath and staggered and grabbed whatever was nearest. My hand went to air. There was an emptiness that had texture. I righted myself and laughed, because we laugh when we are scared and do not want to change the mood of a day. \u201cOkay,\u201d I said to the water. \u201cOkay, boss.\u201d\n\n\u201cCome back,\u201d Mara said. When I waded in fully again, my legs were without their handcuffs. She took my arm, not because I needed it, but to claim me, and the claim spelled itself all the way up to my shoulder.\n\nWe ate seafood at a place with paper on the tables and a waitress who wore a silver beluga tail on a chain. The fries were too thin. Mara dipped hers in three sauces, constructing the bite like it mattered. She told me about her mother\u2014about Vivian\u2019s early morning dances in the kitchen, about the times she woke up to find a note and ten dollars and the sense she had to be twice alive to account for all the places her mother went to be alive. I told Mara about the time my mother sent me a postcard and forgot to write my name, how I stared at the blank as if it might tell me something about fate.\n\n\u201cDo you think it was meant,\u201d she asked, \u201cthat we would be family?\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople say everything is meant to make their heartbreaks into lesson plans,\u201d I said, which was unkind. \u201cMaybe it was luck. Maybe it was an accident that we held onto.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou think too hard,\u201d she said. She aimed the tip of a fry at me and laughed. That sound was like a rope tossed, not a rope pulled.\n\nWe walked back to the hotel, both of us sand-dusted and tired in the best way, missing the details we\u2019d miss on purpose in the morning for the sake of a better story. In the small guest shop, I held up a seashell night light and said, \u201cFor Vivian,\u201d and she held up a T-shirt that said SALTY in block letters and flipped it to show the back said BUT SWEET, and we groaned like old people. She bought a little blue fish for the dashboard of her car, a creature with googly eyes, its little suction cup mouth ready.\n\nThat night, I slept in the second bed and stared up at the ceiling until I felt my heart would reduce itself to math. The hotel air conditioner swallowed and spit air. The curtain trembled. Mara lay in the other bed, her breath the soft shift of a tide. I thought about getting up and moving into her bed, about making the air a different shape with my body and how it would feel to put my knee against hers and fit into some shared city of sleep we had by now built with our walking and our laughter. I did not move. I lay there as long as I could. Dawn is always a humiliation, a proof of your inability to decide.\n\nIn the morning, we ran. Mara runs like an old film star, everything graceful and slightly faster than you\u2019d think. I run like a person running from a bee. We went up the boardwalk and down the firm sand near the water line and then cut back toward a jetty that shoved itself into the body of the sea like a crooked arm. A handful of fishermen, quiet, the kind of quiet that knows something. A man in a white cap nodded and spoke the way men at the ocean do, as if the ocean has made them kind. \u201cMorning.\u201d\n\n\u201cMorning,\u201d we said. My cheeks felt hot. The wind tried to put its hands in my pockets to see if I was telling the truth. We went out to the end of the jetty because people always go to the end. It is what you do with ends. The water here hit the rocks like it wanted to eat them. Mara said, \u201cCareful,\u201d and I said, \u201cI am,\u201d and the rock under my foot told a different story.\n\nI did not fall. That happened later, to her, and the whole world turned on it. But this morning, T minus some days, I slid and my hand went down to catch me, found nothing, found out that touch was not a reliable narrator. I righted myself with a jerk so sharp my neck popped.\n\n\u201cYou good?\u201d Mara asked, looking at me with that narrow way she had when she was weighing whether she should call a doctor.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m good,\u201d I said, too bright, and we turned back.\n\nIf I made a list of clues, it would read like a bad detective novel. The spoon that fell and no one heard. The way the woman at the front desk looked right over me when we asked for extra towels, and I told myself this is how front desk women are trained and then watched her eyes track across me like across a window. The man on the beach selling puka shells who put his tray in front of Mara and said \u201cMa\u2019am,\u201d as if the rest of the air was just the thing she was made out of. The photo Mara took of me on the steps of the pier, the one where my face looked double, like paper copied badly. She deleted it undeleted it deleted it again and said, quietly, \u201cI don\u2019t understand what setting is doing that,\u201d as if the setting were inside me and she was trying not to name it.\n\nWe left the ocean after two days when we had meant to stay four because of a call from the hospital that a freezer was down and Mara had a kind of duty that glowed in her and I loved that duty because it gave the day a shape. We were good at turning around, the two of us; we had practice. On the way back, traffic coagulated and then broke apart and we passed a billboard that said IF YOU DIED TODAY WHERE WOULD YOU GO in a font that looked like someone\u2019s hard breath. I said a smart thing about evangelical marketing and Mara did not answer. She put her hand on the back of my neck for a second and left it there as if to steady me, and we were both quiet.\n\nBeing from Little Rock is like being from any place, which is to say it has a bridge you think is ugly but sometimes looks like an altar in the right light. It has people who always wear shorts and people who always say \u201cbless\u201d and mean it and don\u2019t. It has a place that fries catfish in the back and a place with pizzas so good a part of your mind goes to Ohio for no reason. It has the river and the way the river means you might leave, even if you won\u2019t. We came home to all of this and I let it wrap around me like a routine. Mara went to the hospital and I went back to the office. Tasha asked if we saw dolphins and I lied and said yes, because she wanted me to have seen them. Mr. Boone stood in my door with his hands in his pockets and asked how the water was. \u201cWet,\u201d I said, and he nodded like I\u2019d offered a concept.\n\nThat weekend, our neighborhood had a block party on a street that spilled into ours. The kind with kids on scooters and a folding table greedy with beans and slaws and cans of beer sweating like they were embarrassed to be from a plant. Vivian wore new sandals that had too much strategy on the straps. My father told his good joke about accidentally eating a candle and saying it tasted like rose, and then he told it again to a different cluster. I drifted between the group by the grill and the group on the curb and the group under the pear tree like plankton in a gentle current. Mara was talking to a woman from the next block about knees. Her hands drew circles in the air. She looked up and saw me and smiled in a way that made a line from her to me that anyone could see, a clothesline, a thing with pegs.\n\n\u201cDeirdre,\u201d Vivian said beside me, and I turned because her voice was pitched wrong. \u201cHoney, I\u2026do you want anything? Are you all right? You look a little pale.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m always pale,\u201d I said. My mouth was dry. There\u2019s always an explanation. She touches my shoulder, it is cool.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s something,\u201d she began, then shook her head. She had that look she gets when she knows a recipe calls for a spice she doesn\u2019t have and she\u2019s trying to make her tongue remember its name. \u201cI forget what I meant to say.\u201d\n\nWe sat on the curb as the kids made galaxies with their chalk. Mara joined us. She put her chin on her knees and watched the oldest boy draw a whale. \u201cThat\u2019s not how whales look,\u201d she said to him, and he shrugged and said, \u201cIt\u2019s how mine do,\u201d and she conceded the point.\n\n\u201cI want to go to the ocean again,\u201d she said, softly, to me. \u201cSoon. Before the cold does whatever it does to people.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe just went,\u201d I said, equally soft, because I had a slight stupid fear that if we said it too loudly, someone would hear, and what they would hear is not the word ocean but something else. \u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d I added, because fear be damned, and her hand slid near mine on the pavement and didn\u2019t touch. She drew her finger in the dust and made a shape that could have been a fish. Or an ear. Or a wish.\n\nLater that night, after the folding tables had returned to garages and the paper lanterns had been persuaded back into their flat selves, after my father had put his coin on the windowsill like a talisman and sent me a text that said simply good night, I lay in bed and listened to the house talk. Houses do, when you let them. The ice maker coughed its little stones. The hallway learned about shadows. I thought of the ocean like you think of someone who has touched your hair and then gone into another room.\n\nWhen sleep came, finally, it was not the kind where you float. It had mass. I dreamed I was on a pier that had no visible boards. I dreamed I could hear Mara calling\u2014not for me but my name, hard, like a knuckle on a door. The water did a dangerous thing. And then I woke with my throat closed and my hands reaching for a railing that was not there. The light on my phone said four-oh-two. A word sat at the top of my mouth. I swallowed it before it could name me.\n\nMorning, and the light that comes through our kitchen window made our cheap tile look like an expensive idea. Mara had beat me to the coffeepot and was reading the news on her phone with the grimness of a person who wants to know what mess she\u2019s walking into. She pushed a mug toward me across the counter. I wrapped my hands around it. Sometimes the only thing that proves you exist is the shape your hands make around the everyday.\n\n\u201cDo you ever feel like you\u2019ve already done this? I don\u2019t mean just d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu,\u201d she said without looking up. \u201cI mean like you\u2019re repeating a phrase until it stops meaning anything. Coffee, coffee, coffee.\u201d\n\n\u201cI always feel like that,\" I said. \"Doesn't everybody?\"\n\n\u201cEveryone doesn\u2019t say it like it\u2019s consolation,\u201d she answered, trying to grin, but her eyes wobbled in their set like light on the bottom of a pool. She stared at me then, and it was a look that pulled me as a tide pulls a small boat that has no anchor. She said my name, very gently. \u201cDeirdre. I\u2026\u201d\n\nHer phone rang. The hospital. A voice she obeyed without liking to. She put the mug down in a way that made no sound. She said okay twice and then okay again and then hung up. \u201cStorm coming,\u201d she said. \u201cThey want me to come in early in case power goes out and they need to move the portable units. I might need to stay overnight.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll drop you,\u201d I said. I already had my keys. I already had my shoes. Sometimes your body does what you think.\n\nShe put her palm against my jaw just for a second as if to say yes, we are in the same room. \u201cYou can\u2019t,\u201d she said, half laughing. \u201cYour eleven, remember? Teague Caldwell? Signs? The man who says Friendly like he\u2019s saying the opposite?\u201d\n\n\u201cI'll reschedule,\u201d I said. After a pause, I said, \u201cNo, I won\u2019t,\u201d because I knew the shape of my day, because I thought there would be time to do all the things later, including the ones we were not naming.\n\nThe rain came in sideways. Little Rock does rain like this sometimes, a temper tantrum, and then the sun as if to say, I didn't mean it. By noon, it was a proper storm. Lights flickered. Tasha wrote me in all caps from her desk: IF YOU DIE CAN I HAVE YOUR COOL STAPLER. I wrote back: YES BUT YOU HAVE TO CARRY IT EVRYWHERE TO HONOR ME. She wrote: I WILL STAPLE THE SKY and sent a cat gif. Mr. Boone said we would close early as soon as the land made its decision. I thought about Mara in her basement rooms, the hum of the machines they moved so carefully. I thought about my father sitting on his couch and letting the news tell him what he already knew. I thought about Vivian knitting a complicated thing out of blue.\n\nI went to the window and laid my hand against the glass because sometimes the touch of the outside makes the inside true. My hand did not leave a print. The thought arrived\u2014simple, like a bead.\n\nI turned away quickly, because the difference between a bead and a noose is what you string with it.\n\nAt three, the storm took the light for a minute. Someone down the hall said, \u201cThere it goes,\u201d like talking to a child that had gotten close to a hot stove, and then it came back. My computer rebooted itself and decided I was not me and refused my password twice and then relented like a mother bargaining with a baby. The quiet that follows an almost-outage is different, as if a bigger quiet had rolled through the one you keep at your desk. I got my bag and my raincoat and told Tasha to go home. She saluted me with a ruler. Mr. Boone had already vanished, which is his gift.\n\nThe road from the office to the hospital is only a few turns. It took me twice as long because the streets had become a different set of rules. The water did that thing where it tries to decide whether to swallow or let go. I drove carefully, not because I was patient but because care was all I had left. When I pulled into the section of the garage that Mara had told me to use, a big foam mattress leaned against one wall, a thing that had a job I couldn\u2019t imagine. I ran. The automatic doors opened like a mouth and I stepped in and past the sanitizer a volunteer held like a chalice and down to the basement.\n\n\u201cMa\u2019am,\u201d the man at the desk said as I passed, \u201cvisiting hours are\u2014\u201d and then he looked at me and his mouth smoothed out, the way faces do when they decide they haven't seen you. He turned to his computer screen like it had just asked him a question. I could have laughed. I could have cried. I kept walking.\n\nIn the basement, the air smells like wet metal and long plans. I went by the vending machines, the same ones that had broken our hearts at two in the morning that time Vivian\u2019s sister had her gallbladder out and nobody wanted chips. I saw a group of people in blue gowns move a machine that looked like a stalagmite. I did not see Mara. I did not expect to. It is a big building. I turned, the way you do when you are trying not to be lost. A woman in scrubs said, \u201cCan I help you find something?\u201d and I said, \u201cSome one,\u201d and she said, \u201cOh. Who?\u201d and I said the name of my step-sister.\n\nThe woman repeated Mara\u2019s name, once, like it was a test, and then again, like a whisper. \u201cShe\u2019s in East,\u201d she said, gesturing with her thumb in a direction that could be any direction. \u201cShe lives there on weekends. The wind is worse on that side. Seems to cheer her.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d I said, because gratitude is a path you can lay down in front of you when there is only fluid and no floor.\n\nMara was where she had promised the world she would be, steady and moving, making easy light jokes as she helped someone\u2019s mother find the bathroom. She saw me and her face\u2014yes\u2014her face changed, but not the way a person\u2019s face might change if they saw a ghost. It was the change you make for a friend showing up in the rain when you didn\u2019t ask them to. \u201cYou,\u201d she said, like a gentle accusation.\n\n\u201cMe,\u201d I said.\n\nShe wiped her hands on her scrub pants even though they were clean. \u201cIf you\u2019re here to tell me to go home when they let me go, to sleep, I promise I will. If you\u2019re here to say you\u2019ll hold my place in line for bread if everyone panics, I will text you when the line forms. If you\u2019re here to lurk like a bad omen, to look at me with those big eyes, to\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI wanted to see you,\u201d I said, cutting her off because her words were pinning me like insects to cork. \u201cI wanted to make sure you\u2019re okay.\u201d\n\nShe moved in, a fraction, as if that were a thing her body had learned as a trick. It felt like there were other ocean days behind us already, all of them stacked in a neat pile we would call memory. \u201cI am, so far,\u201d she said.\n\nI reached toward her, for a hand, for a shoulder. I did not touch anything. Either my fingers failed me or the air refused. She flinched anyway, and then frowned, as if she\u2019d been struck by an idea she didn\u2019t like and wanted to hand it back to the universe.\n\n\u201cGo home,\u201d she said, but not unkindly. \u201cMake sure Vivian\u2019s got a candle and your dad\u2019s not using this as an excuse to make Irish coffee. Tell Tasha to take her stapler if she hasn\u2019t already left. Call me when you park. Wait\u2014no\u2014text; they yell when I talk on the floor.\u201d\n\nI wanted to say something else. I wanted to say the word that had sat in my mouth at four-oh-two. I wanted to say I love you in the voice you reserve for the last minute and the first. I put my mouth around the word. The lights blinked again. Someone down the hall made a mess of equipment. Mara looked past me, automatically, as you do, as she had to. It is one of the marks of her goodness that she looks away from her own story when someone calls for help. I let the word go back where it had hidden.\n\nOn the way out, a man in the elevator looked at me like I had borrowed his coat and not offered to return it. I said sorry. He pressed his lips together like closure. The storm had moved on; it always moves. The city shone the way it does after rain, as though every surface has been rehearsing for this role.\n\nMy phone shook in my hand when I was almost home. Tasha\u2019s name. I pulled over. She had sent a photo of my desk chair with a note: I SPUN IT TWICE FOR YOU. COME BACK TOMORROW. She added four hearts and a sailboat.\n\nI texted back a picture of the road with the wipers mid-stroke and said: the water is a comedian, and she sent back: that joke was bad.\n\nAt home, Vivian had candles anyway, three, even though the lights held. My father watched the weather and made commentary as if his opinions could move systems. He said whether he had eaten a candle again and I told him no one believes him, and he looked pleased, like he loved being known so well. We played a game with cards and Vivian cheated without meaning to and I cheated with great intention. I went to sleep and dreamed again of the shore. I heard my name. Once, just once, a voice said: Dierdre. They spelled me wrong. It broke me in a weird fleshy place. In the morning, I found a grain of sand under my tongue, and I laughed because there is only so much you can do with coincidence.\n\nWhat I am trying to do is tell it whole. How we were before the real beginning. How we walked toward the same bad and good. How I stood at the edge of the river in Little Rock and watched it pull and release and told myself that it was just water, just water, as if I didn\u2019t already know that what is just a thing can also be the whole of it, the main act. How my body had, already, started telling me the punchline before the joke had been set up. How I looked at Mara and saw not only her face but the place beyond it where my own breath made shapes and disappeared. How I insisted on believing that you could go to the sea and not come back different.\n\nLater, when we stood on a different shoreline and the sky took a mouthful of her and I ran out and I couldn\u2019t catch what the world had peeled off the world, later, when I would try to hold a towel or a life preserver or a hand and find myself holding the idea of holding, I would look back on these days and want to smash the small domestic idols of our routine. The mugs, the pens, the night light shaped like a shell. I would think of the spreadsheet on my computer and how the boxes waited with so much patience and how betrayed they would be if they could feel anything. I would think of how the man at the garage had looked through me like I was a window and how the child\u2019s chalk did not dust the side of my hand when I dragged it across the whale. I would think of Vivian\u2019s almost-story. Of my father\u2019s almost-courage. Of my own almost-mouth.\n\nBut that comes after. For now, I am not a bad detective with a messy corkboard; I am simply a woman in Arkansas who keeps a neat one-bedroom, who pays the water bill on time, who knows the way to Gulf Shores and back, who has learned the names of her neighbors\u2019 dogs, who knows the weight of her father\u2019s coin in her palm, who writes in a ledger a line each day that says, in its own neat columns, I was here. I was here. I was here. Even if the ink doesn't know me, even if the page is only pretending to listen. Even if, when I turn to look for my reflection, there is nothing but the window, which is a way to say the world, which is a way to say: not yet. Not yet. Not yet.On Wednesday morning the heat returned as if it had left something behind and came back for it, and Main Street got that varnished look it wears when the humidity stands in the doorway with its arms wide. I went early to Freda\u2019s bakery because I thought maybe sugar could teach me its language again if I spoke to it at the source. The window was fogged near her elbows where she was leaning over the dough, and her scarf today was a citrus orange that made her look like a certain kind of bird that knows what to do with wind. When the bell rang and I stepped in, the cool air kissed my arms like a grandmother who had forgiven me for everything in advance. I held the thought that I could be a woman who buys a small paper bag and walks to work with a bun that she intends to eat in three bites and then discovers it takes seven. Freda\u2019s niece manned the register and asked, in that way some young people have that turns every question into a dare, \u201cWhat can I get for you?\u201d and I said, \u201cWhat you would give your favorite teacher if you needed her to grade you easy,\u201d and she laughed and handed me a raspberry thing with sugar jewels jeweled so hard they looked like polish.\n\nBack at my desk, when the ribbon of city traffic outside had turned into a sound with a shape I recognized, I took a bite. It was good in the way beauty can be good even if you can\u2019t name its parts, and then there was a hiccup in my head where flavor ought to open. I chewed and knew texture, knew seed and butter and the cold from the case, but there was nothing that would answer to the name sweet. I reached for my coffee to see if it could prune back the blank and sipped and thought of faucet water and then of nothing at all. Tasha came in on her minute with the mail and the purse bang and saw my face do a geometry and said, \u201cDon\u2019t like?\u201d and I told her, because honesty is sometimes a rebellion, \u201cI can\u2019t tell,\u201d and she put her hand on the desk near mine like she was pressing the paper from curling. She has a gift for standing next to trouble in a way that makes it look like company. \u201cMaybe you need salt,\u201d she said, and we laughed because we are citizens of this country where advice lives like air.\n\nTeague Caldwell did come at eleven and filled my doorway with opinions and fabric. He sells signs, which makes him sound like a man who would\u2019ve thrived in another century, holding up painted boards at a fair and shouting the futures they would give you if you let them. He wore a shirt the color of new pennies and showed me a set of mock-ups for a barbecue joint that wanted to look like it had been there forever. He did that thing where he put his finger halfway into the air as if the finger itself could draw a better line. He said Friendly twice as if it were a safety word and then apologized for saying it too much and I forgave him because there are words I use like salt too. He asked for water in a way that made me get up and I led him to the little machine near the credenza and pulled two paper cones and filled them and handed one to him and he took it and then looked at the other and then at me as if there were a third person standing between us who\u2019d gotten the second cup. He drank his water and I drank mine and he wiped his moustache even though it did not need wiping. I returned to my chair and felt it receive me with the relief of a dog who has been left too long and feared it was abandonment, and I smiled at that thought because it made the furniture love me.\n\nAfter he left, Tasha leaned in and whispered the gossip she had saved as if she were sliding a pastry across to me under the register. \u201cGuess who called me \u2018Sasha\u2019 and then wrote \u2018Deidra\u2019 on the message,\u201d she said, and I sighed and said, \u201cDoes it rhyme with Bone?\u201d and she nodded and rolled her eyes so hard they made a smiley shape in her head. The door to the hall made that breathing sound it makes when the air system decides to remember itself. The sign outside the window buzzed and then quieted and then buzzed again like it was thinking about making a point and then realized the point required more energy than it had stored.\n\nMy father texted at two the way he does, like a clock he thinks he has trained. He uses punctuation for sincerity. Meeting at six if you want, sweetheart. I read it twice and felt the rubber-band pull of obligation and also love, which in our house sometimes share a drawer. I told him yes, I would go, and he wrote back a heart and then the word \u201cproud\u201d and then the word \u201cchip\u201d and then said sorry for saying chip too much and I told him there are worse words to say too much and he wrote back \u201cwhiskey\u201d and then sent six laughing faces as if he was afraid he had done a wrong. I told Tasha I had to leave a little early to make a church basement look like a safe place, and she drew me a boat on a sticky note and made the mast straight this time.\n\nThe church stood on a corner that collects leaves as though it wanted to tuck them in for later. We had been before. We knew the chairs and which ones wobbled and which smell of coffee has the least ambition. Beau was there with his eyes and his smile that might once have been a different man\u2019s weapon and now belonged to everyone. He hugged my father like you hug a cliff after the storm and did that man thing with the backs of hands and the word \u201cbuddy,\u201d and then hugged me too, which I accepted, even though sometimes my skin doesn\u2019t know what to do with love when it arrives wearing a body. We sat in chairs that make your back know itself. Vivian came late because she had been making a soup for the neighbor down the street who just birthed a human and was trying to feed everyone in the city to seduce sleep. The meeting began the way they begin, with ritual and then the part where people say their names and then the part where they tell the truth like it is a cat that will leave if you try to pet it too fast.\n\nI had never spoken in that room because it felt like trespassing onto a map that wasn\u2019t mine. Tonight I raised my hand and let my father\u2019s eyebrows do a dance and said my name and did not add the words those people say because they belong to their war. I said, \u201cSometimes I don\u2019t know how to come back, and I haven\u2019t even been anywhere,\u201d and there was a small sound around the edges of the room that might have been humor and might have been breath and I kept going because if you stop mid-bridge you live there now. \u201cI mean that there are days when I go to hand someone something and I fail them in a way that looks like dropping. I mean that I am trying to believe I am not magic in the bad sense, disappearing when I am needed and reappearing with nothing to show for the trip. I meet the people I love in a room and I think I did and then sometimes I worry I imagined it because nothing on the table knows my weight.\u201d A man in a blue shirt with a postal logo on his breast nodded like he had seen my route before, and Beau smiled without making it about himself, and my father reached toward my shoulder and then moved his hand to the top of the chair like he was checking it for splinters. Vivian breathed the way she breathes when she is trying to memorize the inside of each of us.\n\nAfter the meeting, in the parking lot lit by lights that always look like alien ships on the ground, my father said, \u201cI didn\u2019t know, honey,\u201d and then shook his head at the hubris of that sentence and rephrased, \u201cI didn\u2019t know the shape of it. Thank you for telling me the shape.\u201d He put a hand in his pocket and found his coin and then decided not to take it out and then took it out anyway and pressed it into my palm and said, \u201cYou hold it for me tonight. I can see it at your place tomorrow. It isn\u2019t a test. It\u2019s\u2014we\u2019re a team,\u201d and I told him that a chip is a token and a token could be a key and yes, okay, I would put it on my windowsill and let the light touch it in his stead. Vivian kissed my temple and told me there was lemon in the soup and that this meant something about healing in some country and would I like a quart to take home, and I said yes because I am never too proud to accept soup.\n\nOn the way home, the air turned into a soft drum on the windshield again and the world smelted itself back into new. I took the bridge slow and looked at the river because I am superstitious and believe in water as if it owed me something just for having been my runway. The bridge lights made cardinal points on the black skin of it. A boy with no shirt ran along the far railing and I wanted to shout that he should go home and put on his mother\u2019s worry like a jacket, but my windows were closed and maybe it was hotter inside than out. When I parked, a stray dog\u2014gray with a white face like a saint\u2014stood near the curb and lifted his head as if to ask me a question I didn\u2019t know in the language for dog. He looked past me and then at me and then did that thing animals do when they smell who you are and how much you can offer and whether your hands are useful. He did not wag. He did not run. He blinked slow and then lay down with the patience of stone. I went inside with the coin warm in my hand and the soup armbreaking the bag and thought of how much the city knows and doesn\u2019t say.\n\nMara called late from the hospital to say she had eaten a packet of peanut butter with a spoon like a child and that if she died of boredom first I had to write a scathing letter to management about how humans should be fed actual food, and then she told me about the old man who had taught her the Spanish word for roof while they waited for his daughter to bring his regular glasses, and then she told me she had dreamed of the pier again during her fifteen minutes in the nap room and that in the dream I had been there and then I had not been and that she woke up furious at me and then laughed at how the brain refuses fairness. I told her about the coin and she said, softly, because she respects the way objects carry heat, \u201cPut it somewhere the morning can see it,\u201d and I said I had put it where the sun slips its first question into my apartment. We were both quiet then, the kind of quiet that holds a shape like the donut of absence she had mentioned once about cartilage, the hole that makes the pastry. After a minute she said, \u201cI thought of writing you a letter today, right in pen, in case the power went and we had to remember what hands are for,\u201d and I told her she should write me a letter and she said, \u201cMaybe I already did,\u201d and then a voice behind her said her name and she said, \u201cOkay, okay,\u201d to the air and hung up in a way that promised we were not finished, just paused.\n\nI began to keep a list at the back of my planner titled Experiments, not because I like science more than anyone else, but because calling something an experiment lets your fear sit outside for a minute like a neighbor smoking. In it I wrote: run water over hands and see if ring leaves line; press palm to mirror and count the seconds before fog; write name in lipstick on glass (wipe immediately); stand in sun and look for shadow with toe; ask Tasha to hand me something with eyes closed; eat a strawberry; light a match and blow it out. Some of these were too dramatic for my morning. Others were the kind of kitchen work women have always done in private, small tests to fold the world back into the right shape. I tried the strawberry and could not tell it from a tomato unless I watched the face of the person who had given it to me and borrowed their joy. I pressed my hand to the mirror and saw only the mirror waiting politely; later that week I did the same after a shower and the moisture made a print like a kiss and I cried because I wanted to shout I am here to the caulking. I asked Tasha to hand me the staple remover with my eyes closed and she did and before it reached my fingers I had to fight down the fear that it would keep going, that I would have to laugh like a woman who had fooled herself by setting a table for a guest who did not come.\n\nAt work, Mr. Boone\u2019s son finally did show himself by accident, not in the office but at the sandwich place two blocks away. He was standing near the pickles looking like he had been sent by a casting agent to audition for the role of Bar Owner Who Makes Poor Choices. He had the Boone hair, a little too patient before it loses its will, and the Boone mouth, a little too ready to be a smile if you gave it half a reason. He was arguing lightly with a woman about the merits of mustard and then he saw me and turned off his voice like a radio and said, \u201cYou work with my dad,\u201d as if this had been one of the facts he kept about himself to deploy at moments of emergency. I said I did and he made a motion like he meant to shake my hand but then shoved both of his into his pockets as if the hands had just remembered something. We made a small conversation because I am a person who can make a conversation the way some people can make an omelet. When I returned with my sandwich and told Tasha I had seen him she slapped the counter like she had lost a bet with herself. \u201cAn apparition,\u201d she said, and then added, \u201cDo not let him think we are as tidy as we are. It scares men like that.\u201d\n\nThe following Sunday, Vivian held her soup night and invited neighbors who had never been inside our house to come in and make our living room look like a magazine about furniture that likes people in it. She made three pots because she believes in options as a moral principle and wrote their names on tape in her neat parochial school script: LENTIL WITH LEMON, CHICKEN RICE, MINESTRONE. My father wore a sweater that made him look like his own father in the photographs where regret is a kind of lighting. Mara and I stood in the kitchen shoulder to shoulder like line cooks and tried to finish each bowl with a flourish to convince people they were being celebrated. \u201cParsley,\u201d she said, pinching it like a spell. \u201cSalt,\u201d I said, tipping the shaker like a wand. A woman with a baby named Lux asked if we were sisters and then gave me a look that said she had meant something else, and I told her the truth we had agreed upon, which is that love makes families and paperwork makes them legal and our two households have had both, and she smiled like that line was the right door to press.\n\nAfter the guests left in a drizzle of thank-yous and the sound of spoon in bowl had transferred to a memory of itself, we did the dishes with the tired happiness of able people. Mara washed and I dried and Vivian flanked us with a towel brigade and my father cut the leftover bread in slices as if he had not been told he was the person in the room least qualified for knives. There was a song on the radio about a man who drives away and the woman who invents a reason to be mad at him to make the leaving easier, and Vivian turned it up while saying the youth of today think they invented yearning. Mara kept handing me wet heavy things and I had the sense again of being a person waiting for a ball that might pass through her hands. Once, without meaning to, I put my towel hand right through the gap between bowl and air and bent at the waist so fast I knocked my hip on the dishwasher. \u201cOw,\u201d I said, not because it hurt but because the body requires narrative. \u201cCareful,\u201d Mara said, and then she touched my hip where it had no business hurting and left her hand there for the count of three and I had to put my free hand on the counter to steady to keep from doing that stupid thing of leaning back into her to pretend the world were simply physics and not longing.\n\nLater, when Vivian had gone to bed with a book about a queen who did not apologize and my father had arranged his coins like a small country and kissed each of us like we were in a play about goodbye, Mara sat on the floor with her back against the couch and said, without preface as is her way when the thought is too true to dress, \u201cDo you think something is wrong with you,\u201d and it was a blessing that she did not say what because sometimes love is letting a person fill in the blank. I said, \u201cI think something is different and the world hasn\u2019t agreed to it yet,\u201d and she nodded like a scientist who has heard the data and knows it doesn\u2019t add but trusts the instinct that sent the search. She said, \u201cDo you want a doctor,\u201d and then made a face at the way she had said it as if doctors were a single creature in a case. \u201cNot a doctor doctor, I mean, I could ask someone. Not for a diagnosis and a word that makes you smaller. Just an eye. Or we could do nothing and decide it will right itself, because sometimes I have found and it kills me that this is as true as the other truth that doing nothing is, often, what saved me from turning a bruise into a story,\u201d and I loved her for knowing that medicine has a window for wisdom and for leaving the latch undone for me.\n\nI told her I had been keeping a list and that I could show it to her if she promised not to laugh at the part where I tried to taste a strawberry with my eyes closed and she said yes and then laughed anyway in the kind way that makes the laugh part of your courage. I fetched the planner and sat with her on the floor and let her read it and she didn\u2019t make a face except when she got to the mirror and then she closed it softly and put her hand, palm down, on the cover as though we were at church and I had sworn. She said, \u201cI think you found the interesting thing about ghosts,\u201d and then looked away like she had surprised herself with her own mouth. \u201cNot the spooky thing. The part where they go to the same rooms again and again because those rooms know them and that is maybe part of how they remain. I don\u2019t believe in them the way the movies do, with wet hems and malice, but I believe in the need that keeps them near. If I were a ghost I would live in a hospital sofa that sinks in the middle and not haunt anyone, exactly, just make sure everyone who sat there found their shoe,\u201d and I told her she would be a very good ghost and she said, \u201cDon\u2019t make me a ghost,\u201d and I said, \u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d even though I knew that was not a promise anyone can keep.\n\nAfter she left that night, I opened the window even though the heat begged me not to and sat at my little table and took out my ledger like it could be a net. The page was cream and made to be believed. I wrote the date and then, in the line I had started keeping for myself ever since I had noticed the spaces people leave for themselves are as important as the spaces they leave for others, I wrote, in my neatest numbers, I was here. The ink looked fine for a second and then gathered itself up into beads as if the paper had decided to be oil. I watched them wobble and then flatten and then wobble again like they had a soft mind. I pressed my thumb to the words and lifted it and there was no black on my skin. I blew on it as though it were a birthday trick. It dried eventually, obedient to the physics of office supplies, and I told myself that the humidity had gotten in, that the paper knew its climate better than I did, and then later I woke in the dark with the ledger in my mind like a person knocking on a door you forgot to lock.\n\nAt lunch on Monday, Tasha said she had been thinking of leaving in March, not leaving leaving, but leaving the office, and that she would drive as far as New Orleans or as far as she could afford to get gas and then she would sit in a cafe and write a letter to her mother in pencil because pencil makes even bad decisions look like drafts. She drew me a boat that took up the whole memo pad and put tiny faces in the windows and said, \u201cWill you miss me if I go?\u201d and I told her that missing is one of my primary languages and that yes, I would miss her in a way that would make me imagine her in every line at the post office and I would send her pictures of our blinking sign so she would remember the good and the silly. She said I could come with her and I said I was chained to spreadsheets by a gold chain and then she looked at me with that face she makes when she thinks I am making a joke to cushion a truth and said, \u201cTake a day. Take two. Take eight. They will not know how to miss you but you will teach them,\u201d and I said I would think about it in the way that means I would think about it like a rosary and probably say no because it was easier and I would be angry at myself for that ease and turn the anger toward something else, like the copier.\n\nA postcard arrived that afternoon from California like the sea had spit it out on the exact person\u2019s porch who would bring it to me. My mother had chosen a photograph of a beach that looks like a bruise, purple and yellow at once, and on the back she wrote, not Dear, but Deidre, and then crossed it out so thoroughly the paper thinned and wrote Dear D. and then wrote, \u201cYou would not believe these oranges,\u201d and then drew three stars and a line that said she had met a woman who made jewelry from old silver trays and made a face out of forgotten spoons and wasn\u2019t that as good a use for a life as any. There was more on the card about a man named Wally who read a poem once on the radio, and then a PS about how she had bought a postcard and then realized it had seagulls she didn\u2019t like the shape of and threw it away and how did I feel about the word cormorant and whether it was too serious to be a bird. The address was almost ours. The mailman had penciled the correction in the margin. I held it and thought of fog horns like fathers who always stayed and of the way she had crossed out my mistake and replaced it with an initial like she had kept the door to my name not shut but just a little shy.\n\nThat night, I dreamed again about the pier. In this one, there were five of us, not four, which puzzled me because I could not count who the fifth belonged to, and then I realized it was lux, not the baby but the word, and the word made a sound when it stepped on the wood, and then my name came, not mispronounced this time, but breathed like a towel warm from the dryer. I turned and saw no one and then saw myself the way sometimes a mirror is a window until your face arrives. I woke with my tongue tasting of metal and fear and sat up too fast and had to hold the edge of the mattress like a ledge. The room wore its quiet like a shawl. The clock on the stove in the other room made that soft tick when it decides to show off that it came from a house with a grandfather in it. My phone blinked in the dark and I thought, dumbly, that a blinking object deserves an answer, and I reached for it and found that for a second there was an inch between reaching and finding, and that inch felt like a life you could live if you stepped into it.\n\nWhen the sun finally gave up and slid back into the building and turned my coin to a small person singing, I wrote to Mara without the courage of morning coffee and said, \u201cLet\u2019s go again,\u201d and then because I am a person who likes to give fate specific instructions, I added, \u201cNot the Gulf. Somewhere with a meaner coastline. Somewhere that makes you stand up straight.\u201d She wrote back in three tics because she is a quick study and said, \u201cNorth Carolina,\u201d and then wrote, \u201cNo, too complicated. Too many of my exes keep their secrets there,\u201d and then wrote, \u201cOregon,\u201d and then wrote, \u201cI\u2019m kidding. Too far unless we sell something,\u201d and then wrote, \u201cCape Cod before the season ends,\u201d and I typed back something about money and days and work and then I typed back nothing and then I wrote, \u201cPick the place you dream,\u201d and she wrote, \u201cOkay,\u201d and then nothing for longer than I knew she could keep a thought from tripping over its own feet, and then she wrote, \u201cI dreamed a stairway,\u201d and then, as if translating herself, \u201cJersey.\u201d\n\nWe are not the kind of people whose lives, when written down, look like maps worth bragging about, but there is a map in our heads of the way to Circle K and the way to the good park and the way to the hospital and the way to the interstate and now there would be a line from Arkansas to a shore the color of bottle glass and boardwalk pizza and men with tattoos that tell the weather. The idea of it felt at once tawdry and perfect, and I decided right then that I could be a person who goes to the wrong ocean in order to find her right one. We picked a weekend. We traded responsibilities like cards and made them sort themselves. Vivian clucked and then hid her smile in my hair. My father held his coin and counted aloud and said he would be fine if we left him and that he could cook for himself and that we both knew that meant he would eat cereal and peas. Tasha drew me a boat that said NE on a little flag and tucked it into my bag when I wasn\u2019t looking and when I found it, later, it felt like permission folded small.\n\nIn the days before we left, I tried my experiments with more devotion as if I could get all my data in now so I\u2019d have something to bring to the ocean. The mirror made a print on a Tuesday and refused on a Thursday and I told myself the glass was moody. The strawberry tasted like summer for exactly one bite and then like the memory of summer for the rest, which is not a bad thing if you are a person who likes memory. The staple remover obliged my fingers like an old friend. A child at the copy machine said, \u201cHey,\u201d like I was a statue that had decided to speak. The cat\u2014our cat, really, because he followed us when Vivian moved and now lives in both houses like a joint custody agreement\u2014walked along the top of the couch and put his face in my hair and then took it out and sneezed and I took it as a blessing. I found the imprint of my palm in the dust on the top of my bookcase and wanted to put glass over it like a museum plaque. I went to the river and dropped a pebble and watched the circles make their solemn march outward and waited for the part of the ritual where you feel better and discovered that sometimes circles are just circles and that you have to do the feeling yourself. A man playing harmonica on the bank played the wrong song for the way the sky looked and I loved him for being wrong with such commitment.\n\nThe night before we left, Mara came over with a plastic bag that held a travel toothbrush, a tiny bottle of lotion that promised gold, and a tin of mints shaped like anchors. She put them on my counter and announced, \u201cWe will not buy any of this on the road and then we will discover we cannot do the thing we came to do for lack of a mint,\u201d and then she saw how my face lifted into some kind of happiness and she took a breath and let it out like a person who has been given something you cannot wrap. She said, \u201cI spoke to a doctor,\u201d and when I made a face, she said, \u201cNot your doctor. Not a doctor like that. Doctor Annabeth, who takes lunches at odd times and knows too much about X-rays and not the lay of the land of our specific bodies and therefore cannot say anything for sure except that people are stranger than the charts allow and that the world we know is made of the parts we can push against and the parts we cannot and that if you feel like falling through sometimes it could be your brain being a liar and it could be the floor being honest and that neither option is a character flaw,\u201d and I stood very still because sometimes love speaks in paragraph and you have to hear all of it. I asked if Annabeth had told her to get me scanned like a suitcase and she said no, not yet, that she said to watch, to write down dates and times the way you are told to track a fever, to see if there was a pattern\u2014sleep, food, weather, sorrow, the river\u2019s mood. She handed me a little notebook with lemons on the cover that she had bought because she does not believe in making equipment so serious it scares the work away.\n\nWe lay on my bed on our stomachs like girls and looked at the map on my computer as if it were a joke telling itself well. I typed in directions from our place to a stretch of shore she remembered from her dream, which is not how dreams work, but if you make them behave like places sometimes they nod and comply. We decided we would go to the sort of motel that leaves a basket of coupons in the room and makes you feel like an aunt and an outlaw at once. We decided we would eat salt water taffy as if it were a sacrament and that we would not pretend we liked it if we did not. We decided we would walk out at dumb hours when the weather told us not to because we are people who do not like to be told. At some point we were both quiet for so long the phone screen went dark by itself and our two faces were in the black as if we were borrowing glass. I rolled onto my back and breathed and she clicked the phone back on not to check anything but so that the light would make it easier for us to keep speaking without naming the thing we were holding between us like a bowl.\n\nWhen she left, I followed her to the door and watched her to the curb because I am a person who thinks distance is a trick and that you can tame it by staring. She turned once and lifted her hand and then put it down and then lifted it again because she is a person who edits even gestures. Down the street, the men under the flyover played something that had words like rain and I thought of the day when the sky would remember us as a pair and not as women trying to be good and I shut the door softly because if you slam it the house remembers.\n\nI slept a lighter sleep, half full, the kind you do when you are about to move the scene. In the morning I would put the coin back in my father\u2019s hand and he would pretend to complain about how warm I had made it and he would then put it to his lips as if to taste whether I had seasoned it different and he would do his little dance of superstition. In the morning, I would put the lemon notebook in the glove box like a secret and we would pull onto the interstate and become people with a purpose that could be written on a postcard without shame. In the morning, I would softly touch the ledger and the line I had made, and I would look for myself like a child checks behind a curtain and then I would say, out loud because seeing counts, I was here and I am going, and I would leave the light on for the person I might be when I returned.In the morning the light came in a tired way that made everything look as if it had spent the night up worrying. I put the coin on the sill before I made coffee and watched its edge catch the pale. It made a flash like a fish turning. At the sink I reached for the mug with the blue rim and found myself having to look twice to be sure I had lifted it; the clink against the counter was the proof. I wrote the date and the words I was here in the ledger with the carefulness of a person addressing a stranger and waited to see if the ink would behave. It pooled a little, not enough to be superstitious about if you are not me, and then it settled like weather. I wanted to write I am going but did not, because leaving feels like a tender thing that grows best if you don't touch it too much at the beginning.\n\nWhen I drove to my father\u2019s, he was already at the door like a boy waiting for the bus. He had on the sweater from a photograph again and his hand played with his pocket where he keeps his worry. Vivian called out from the kitchen for me to take the bag of snacks or she would chase me to the road barefoot and we both laughed because we had both seen her do exactly that for less. I handed him the coin and he tucked his head, and for a second he held it to his lips as if there were something garlic about it he could smell. \u201cYou warm it better,\u201d he said, which is his way of telling me he is counting on me to have steadier hands than he thinks his are. Vivian kissed both of us like a woman packing fruit for a long journey and said, \u201cDon\u2019t be clever if the sign says don\u2019t,\u201d which is her way of telling me she remembers who I was at fifteen. On the doormat there was a damp leaf the exact shape of a tongue. The stray dog from the other night stood further down the sidewalk as if he had an appointment but was early. He looked at me in that seeing way that makes you feel both chosen and assessed and then he looked over me like rain looks over glass.\n\nMara pulled up in her car with the fish on the dashboard and thumped the horn once to say she was impatient in a playful way. She came inside to hug the people who have become her and accepted Vivian\u2019s curse against hunger disguised as almonds and a bag of small oranges. My father told her not to let the tollbooth men give her counterfeit bills and she told him she could identify bone shards on a film the size of a postcard so she could probably tell a fake twenty. He said, \u201cKeep an eye on her,\u201d and jerked his head at me, and she said, very solemn, \u201cAlways,\u201d and then made it into a joke by squinting one eye and holding her hand like a telescope. I slid the lemon notebook into the glove compartment and when I did I felt the car\u2019s insides welcome it like an organism does a friendly graft.\n\nThe road did not care about our errands. It stretched and narrowed where it pleased, and the cities we passed wore their names like emblems and like apologies. In Memphis, the bridge made its rude arch and we sang Abba in a part of our range that is not flattering. In Nashville, every other station was guitar and brag, and Mara put on the fado to rinse us and I pictured an old woman singing into a fishmonger's dawn. We stopped at a station with a mural of a buffalo on the cinder block wall and a woman behind the counter who had four rings in one ear and wrote the total on the back of a receipt because the machine was sulking. I handed over a bill and held it longer than necessary so I could be sure this was a transaction and not a rehearsal; she took it with two fingers and looked up just left of my face and said, \u201cYou friends need anything else?\u201d to the general space. Mara bought a bag of pretzels that promised lightning bolts of salt and a pack of those anchor mints and a magazine with a dog on the cover and a headline about ten ways to know you\u2019ve been loved. In the car she tucked the mints into the cup holder and gave me one like a crumb from a host and watched while I put it on my tongue. It tasted like the shape of mint and then it did not. I told her it was perfect anyway and she touched my wrist in apology for making me take a test when I had not agreed.\n\nWe stayed one night in a place off the interstate that called itself a lodge and had a deer painted on the door. The clerk had a name tag that said JOSE with a little flag sticker next to it and he was on the phone when we walked up and he held up a finger for wait and smiled at Mara and then at the desk as if it had asked him a question. I leaned on the counter because my body likes to push against belonging and the counter did not notice. When he hung up he handed us one key like a person dealing cards deliberately and said, \u201cBreakfast is from six to nine unless it isn\u2019t,\u201d which made me like him. Mara said, \u201cCould we have two?\u201d and he blinked as if recalculating and slid another across without quite making eye contact with me, like a newscaster reading serious words to the wrong camera. In the room the air smelled like rug and an old decision. The television said something about storms walking up the coast with their hands in their pockets. We lay on our separate beds and watched for a while and then turned the channels to a show about antique guns that had nothing to do with our world and then we shut it off and listened to the elevator in the hall take people up and put them down. I fell asleep with my shoe on like a dummy because sometimes my body sleeps as if it is sneaking in a nap it should not be having.\n\nMorning dew made the car look like we had parked in a cloud. We drove and drove and talked and did not, because there is a way to spend hours with a person and never feel you are wasting time even when you say nothing that will be printed in a book. The closer we got, the flatter things went and the more the sky felt like a permission slip someone forgot to sign. The first smell of salt made Mara roll down the window like a teenager and laugh like a woman. It was not the kind Florida breathes, which is like a fruit market in a church. It was rawer and more medicinal, like the air had been cut with something that clears. Boarded-up shuttered motels announced VACANCY with only three letters lit. The T-shirts in shop windows said crabbing is not a hobby it\u2019s a lifestyle and there were men in long shorts with old tattoos that looked like maps of rivers to no place. We crossed a drawbridge and pretend-fought about who was supposed to be steering the sky. When we pulled up to the motel with the name like a sailboat, a woman with a striped shirt and a lip the exact color of tomato paste slid our check-in form through a slot as if she were feeding the ocean a ration. She told us about pizza and she told us about saltwater taffy and she said the lifeguards were on a skeleton crew this late and that skeleton was on brand and then she looked at Mara and back at me like the ocean looks at two waves and knows they will pretend to be different.\n\nWe took the stairs even though the elevator had not offended us and when we reached the landing the wind pushed us back like a big aunt. The room had a bedspread with boats and a lamp shaped like a buoy and a basket of coupons that did indeed make me feel like I had been given permission to be quaint. We threw our bags and did that thing where two people in a room do a choreography that says I will take the left drawer and you will take the right and neither of us will say why that matters. On the balcony a woman in a sweatshirt that said WILDWOOD in a college font smoked as if to balance all that salt. The ocean threw its body at the shore over and over like a person trying to explain a point that has no words. Mara stood with her hands on the rail and said, \u201cIt\u2019s mean,\u201d and she smiled like that made her love it more.\n\nOn the boardwalk we ate the greasy good that was promised. The man behind the counter scraped the griddle like a violin and shouted numbers as if he was calling gamblers to their bets. We took a paper plate with a slice that incredulous New Yorkers would have judged for being broad and perfect, and we folded it and grease mapped my wrist and I tried to taste the basil and the acid and found that while I could identify their shapes with my mind, the sweetness of the tomatoes that everyone tells you to notice in stories was a blank hallway. We bought taffy because we are faithful to ritual, and the girl put it in a box with a picture of a couple from the 1950s who could have been anyone\u2019s mother and father and were pretending to be everyone\u2019s. We sat on a bench and put a piece in our mouths and laughed because taffy is an idea more than a flavor, and I thought: even if I could taste like I used to, this would still be what it is, an obligation you enjoy because it makes time move slower. Birds hovered with their gangster eyes and made plans to snatch from toddlers. A child in a stroller stared at me and then did not. Mara wiped my wrist with her thumb without thinking and then stopped and apologized as if she had stepped too close to a ledge, and I said, trying to make the truth smaller than it is, \u201cI like to be looked after,\u201d and she said, \u201cBy me,\u201d like a person checking the spelling of a difficult word.\n\nIn the afternoon, when the light went sideways and the families went in for naps and the boardwalk men put out their racks of hoodies like teeth, we walked to the stairs that go down to the beach. The stairs were wrong in the way that made them right. They had a bend on the third plank that made you put your foot down differently and a nail head that had risen to make a warning, and Mara put her hand on the railing and said, \u201cThis is it,\u201d not loudly, not with drama, like how someone says they have found the street they grew up on by smell. The wood had that gritty skin that only boards near salt get. The wind made the flags go hard at the lifeguard chairs and the red cloth was the exact color of a decision you regret in a good dress. On the sand there were the usual armies of umbrellas with their spines showing and a man sleeping in a posture that would have meant sadness in another place but here meant simply sun.\n\nI looked down at our hands, the way you do when you know that it's not appropriate to look at faces for too long, and I tried to see our shadows. Mara\u2019s hand cast a neat double on the board. Mine did a strange thing. It shivered, not with the wind but with hesitation, as if the light could not make up its mind whether to be caught. I stepped forward to make a deeper shape and there was a smear and then nothing, the plank just itself again. It made my stomach go light in the wrong way. I stepped back. The board, the rail, the nail head, all were confident without me. I wanted to laugh because it is a joke the world plays often: how we think we mark things and how often they are busy marking themselves. I had that petty thought that maybe the angle is wrong and blamed the hour like a scold. Mara had crouched to tie her shoe with the grace she has with all knots. When she stood, she brushed my shoulder in passing and the brush landed like a moth, there, then gone.\n\nWe took our towels down because that is what women do even when we know we will not sit still. The water had that look of panes stacked at a diagonal, clear and then dark then light again, thick. We did not intend to swim, because the flags and because the lifeguard with the whistle blew at a boy trying to be a hero and because Mara\u2019s mother lives in her like a lighthouse and flickers warnings at reasonable intervals. We rolled our pants and did the ridiculous ankle dance of stepping in and then out as if the ocean is a test you can fail on a minor scale and get partial credit. A wave reached up and touched me knee to knee and in that touch there was the smallest suggestion of thumb and forefinger again, a grip not cruel but instructive, and I had to plant both feet and tell my body it belonged. I scooped water and let it lick my palms; it had no taste. I put my tongue to the corner of my mouth to see if salt had chosen that place and found that the ocean could be sugar or snow and my mouth would not testify anymore.\n\nThe man with the whistle blew it for someone else. The women near us said their mother\u2019s names as admonitions. Mara pointed with her elbow at the end of the pier that chewed its teeth into the water, and she told me that in the dream the board had been loose right there and she had wanted to fix it with her two hands and then she had woken with her fingers curled and the half-moon marks on her palm like a little secret alphabet. I said, \u201cLet\u2019s go look,\u201d because looking is the human narcotic, and we went, not because we intended to climb it but because the angle from underneath shows you the structure of your fantasies. The barnacles were thick as an old truth. The pilings wore their skirts of weed like a fashion they did not ask for. A boy with a plastic net told us seriously that jellyfish had been seen near and to watch out for their invisible stings, and Mara thanked him gravely because she always thanks children as if they were diplomats.\n\nWe walked back to the towel and we sat just long enough to act like people who know how to idle. Then Mara stretched on her back and put her arm over her eyes and said, \u201cIf you were anyone else, I would tell you a thing,\" and I said, \u201cTell me a thing,\u201d and she said, \u201cIf I tell you, it changes it.\u201d I lay on my side and propped my head and watched the gulls do their petty crime. I thought about all the ways people confess love as if it were a crime, in whispers and with scans of the room; I thought of all the rooms where saying it had been the only clean act people could manage. I did not say the words that had sat in my mouth. I took out the lemon notebook and wrote down the time and the word downstairs and the words shadow hesitant and taste absent and then drew a picture of the pier like a child, which is to say the lines lied with love.\n\nThat night the motel hummed like a refrigerator even when the air conditioner had shut up. We ate at a place where the waitress said hon as if someone had handed her the word when she was ten and told her to keep it safe. The fried clams were a bruise, perfect in their rightness to the place, and I watched Mara savor each piece with an attention that made me feel religious. I drank a beer and it tasted like promises, which is to say more foam than substance, which is to say I liked it and then it left me. We went to the arcade and lost money on a game that required you to drive a car with a wheel that fought back like a bad memory. A girl in a sweatshirt offered to take our picture with the plastic shark's mouth around our shoulders and we said yes because when someone offers to domesticate a moment for you it feels unkind to refuse. She clicked twice. In the first, Mara looked like a woman who knows a joke about grief and I looked like I had been drawn in with pencil and then an eraser had passed over me gently. In the second there was a glare. The girl showed me and said, \u201cSometimes this phone hates inside light,\u201d and we told her not to worry and then after she left Mara deleted none of them and let them sit like stones.\n\nIn the room we watched the weather again, because it is in us, in both of us, to want to know where and how things will go wrong and whether other people might be suffering in a way that can make ours feel connected. The man on the television said something about a system off the shelf, and the map made colors in a smear that looked like a child\u2019s painting of a bruise and an angel. Mara brushed her teeth and then looked at herself in the mirror long and hard as if she were asking the person in there a question about courage. I turned off one lamp and then another and then turned one back on, because light\u2019s job is to argue you into staying. On our separate beds we lay and talked until our sentences had gaps between them like planks over water, and sometimes neither of us stepped anyway and the gaps closed by themselves. When she said good night, she said it like a person being careful with something that could roll; when I said it, it sounded like a coin, bright and too round.\n\nIn the morning the air had a temper. People walk differently on days when the sky has its own business. I put the ledger on the bed and made the small account of our ordinary, what we had spent in dollars and in whatever else you spend on travel and on wanting. I wrote, I was here and also, ridiculously, I am trying, and then closed it in a hurry as if someone might see me being earnest and mistake it for weakness. Mara came out of the shower with her hair wet and her face lit in a way that was not only the bathroom light. She said she had dreamed again and that in the dream it had not been the board that was loose but the hinge in her, the place where you decide to step. She laughed at herself and called it melodrama and rolled her eyes as if to puncture it and then she put her hand on the adapted place between my shoulder and my neck where people put hands when they mean it and what passed between us felt like the solid version of that word I had been keeping wet.\n\nWe walked to the beach with our towels and our small bottle of a day\u2019s courage. The flags stood their ground and the lifeguards had a look that says we will do what we can but the ocean doesn\u2019t sign contracts. The stairway from the dream made its turn and we respected it. The water was louder than the night before. Sometimes the sea gossips; today it argued. A man in a yellow shirt jogged by with a dog that looked like a mistake and both of them were happy. A father built a wall with his small son that the next wave took with bored efficiency and the child cried as if he had not expected the obvious. Mara\u2019s eyes were on the place where the water and the wood shake hands without respect. Her mouth made the line she gets when she is listening with the part of her that thinks in pictures. I stood next to her and could not tell if the nail head on the third board was higher or if I only wanted it to be. Sometimes you see signs because you need them more than you need facts.\n\nWe did the small cautionary things. We looked for ripples that suggest a current you cannot argue with. We decided to stand near the old woman with the visor because old women know. I rolled my pants again because I am a slow learner in matters of wet. A wave came in and made lace at our ankles and then another came in that was less lace and more sleeve. The sky had its mouth open so slightly that you could not call it anything but a breath. Mara said my name in that voice she uses when she is turning her head away from what she loves because she has to look toward work. \u201cDeirdre,\u201d she said, and it was a string thrown, and I looked at her and saw the tendons at her wrist like anchors, and then the wave that was not lace put its hand out and pulled.\n\nIt did not look like drama the way people tell it later when they want to be kind to themselves for not seeing it coming. It looked like an ordinary disobedience with ill manners. Her foot went from under, not because she is careless but because balance is a god with moods. She bent, the most human motion, not falling so much as adjusting. I reached. My hand did not meet her. It met the shape of her in air, and the air had its own good fidelity to itself. The towel at my shoulder slid and I took that stupid step, the one you take when you think the floor will move to meet you. The water came harder and made a rope around her knees and laughed in that heartless way the animate world has when it does not mean you. She shot me a look that was not panic, not yet; it was an equation\u2014me plus you plus water equals\u2014solve, solve, solve. I solved by holding my hands as if I knew how to make myself a hook. It is a special section of hell, discovering you cannot touch the person you have been trying not to love loudly. My fingers closed on nothing that the world would give me. It was like being asked to pick up fog and not offend it.\n\nPeople were shouting. The lifeguard made his whistle into a knife. The old woman with the visor stood like a saint in a painting and said nothing because what could she say that would be better than a rope. Mara set her feet down and for a second that I will live in forever she was steadied. She held her hand out because she is a person who thinks of the simplest miracle first, and I put mine under hers because I am a person who still thinks miracles listen. The press of palm to palm that I had imagined a hundred times in rooms and kitchens and offices and at other people\u2019s tables was a ghost\u2019s joke. It landed light as thought and slid. We both felt the slide. She made a face that I have no name for because our inventory of expressions does not have one for this. It said this cannot be and also I am not surprised. She tried again because she is stubborn. I tried again because I have only so many moves.\n\nThe water did what it had set out to do without remorse. It is very likely that if I had been another woman, a heavier one, a more present one, a woman whose hand leaves sugar on the tongues of cups, I would have made a difference, and it is very likely that if she had been any other woman, she would have made the same mistake and we call it devotion. The wave that took a mouthful of her was not even a show-off. It was the mean thorough one that comes after the drama, that goes about its business and collects what the prettier wave left behind. It folded her waist and took her knees and offended gravity on her behalf. She went under with a look back that was not for me exactly but I took it that way because one day there would be no one else to take it. The ocean did not want her, not any more than it wants a bottle cap. It wanted motion. It wanted to prove a point it couldn't stop proving. The lifeguard went in with his straight back and his red float and another one followed and the people on the beach made that sound that crowds make, the sound that says we are the world and we are useless.\n\nI stepped after, as if I had a right to participate in rescue, as if my body could negotiate with law. A man I did not know put his arm across me to stop me, the way you do in a car when the driver slams brakes and you play seat belt with your hand, and his arm felt like a bar even though I know very well it might not have been there. I moved around him because I am also stubborn and the water met me like a doorman who has been given very clear orders. It pushed. It pushed again. I understood that if I went further it would make a case against me. If I called her name it would not carry. I called it anyway. It sounded to me like when you knock on a hotel wall and there is a person next door you want to know you are there in case. The lifeguards made their angles. The one with the red float reached her shoulder and she came up and blew like a person who has been underwater for exactly long enough to tell a story later. The water receded to a moody line. It came back. It took more. It returned what it had to return. The world compressed itself to four bodies and a rope of foam.\n\nLater, when we were on our knees on the towel and she was coughing in that awful animal way that makes you want to buy air in bottles to give it to people, she laid her hand on my forearm without thinking and her hand went right through the place where mine ought to have been and landed on the grit of the towel. She felt around like you do in a dark room for the pull cord, and we both looked at where our skin should have been together, and the look did not belong to any language I had. We sat that way as the men shouted rules at the sea and a woman prayed too loud and the boy with the jellyfish net explained to his father exactly what had occurred. The lime green on the lifeguard\u2019s whistle looked shamefully cheerful. The sand under our knees felt like every grain was staring up and taking a note it would keep.\n\nWe tried to behave like the right kind of people. She let herself be examined on the sand by the men who have learned to kneel and say ma\u2019am while they check your pulse. She nodded and followed their instructions to breathe slow like a practice. I wrapped a towel around her because towels are what we have and because that is the act we have been given in every tragedy since blankets were invented. She took it and smiled as if to tell me I had not failed to perform kindness and that in itself is a kind of kindness. The lifeguard said words about rip current and eyes open and not above your waist and I said, against the part of me that likes sarcasm, thank you. The old woman in the visor patted my shoulder and missed it and patted the air and did not seem to notice. Somewhere someone put their cooler down hard and made a sound that made me jump.\n\nBack in the room, after the men had allowed us to leave because nothing was broken you could fix with a cast and because you have to let people go if they insist on going, Mara sat on the edge of the bed with the towel around her shoulders like a cape and the fish on the dashboard downstairs stared north. She coughed and then laughed and then cried all in the one breath, as if there had not been time to sort. She said, \u201cDo not say it,\u201d and I did not, and she said, \u201cSay it,\u201d and I did not. I crossed the room and stood in front of her and put my hands out and watched her put hers in mine and watched them again not catch. We both watched the not of it like a live thing between us. Her fingers closed on the air where mine had gone as if she were squeezing an invisible fruit and her mouth made a sound I had heard before in barns and kitchens and rooms with bad news; it is the sound made when the thing you already knew and would not say to yourself arrives with proof.\n\nWe stayed there too long for comfort, for sense, but sense was a door that had already shut. The tide kept shouting the same sentence outside in a language that doesn't accommodate apology. A siren far up the road did the ceremonial wail that communities insist upon as if it helps even when you cannot tell where to send your grief. Mara stood finally, because she is not a person who will be made into a patient without a fight. She peeled the towel off her shoulders as if she were taking her skin off and putting it back on, and she reached for me without eyes and found me not. She said my name the way you say a word when you are making sure it belongs to your mouth and then she said it again in the way you do when you are asking the room to answer. I made a decision to be the kind of person who says a true thing even if it makes the air colder. I said, \u201cI don\u2019t know how it\u2019s going to go. I think I might not be the same kind of real as I used to be.\u201d She nodded as if thanking me for putting a line on a map that already had roads.\n\nWe did the next simple things because the brain likes a list when the heart is roaring. We put her clothes in a pile by the radiator to tempt them to dry even though the radiator was cold. We wrung out salt from a shirt that had no reason to have so much in it. We took the lemon notebook from the glove box like a doctor fetching a file and wrote the time and the steps and what the water had said of us and how the towel had felt like a person when it was the only thing I could hold. We wrote in different hands and then read each other\u2019s entry aloud like a prayer. We did not write the word ghost and we did not write the phrase almost family and we did not write the thought that some stories are jealous and want a clean tragedy to show at the end, because we are suspicious of clean anything when it comes to pain.\n\nOutside, the storm the man on television had invited into our plans set its first foot down. The window glass went into itself with the sound of thin instruments. The people on the walk put their heads down and their shoulders forward because you can march through almost any weather if you pretend you are being paid. The sign at the motel office flickered VAC and then ANC and then nothing, and JOSE must have been thinking of his mother as he filled the lobby with the smell of coffee because buildings smell like the person in them who is trying. Mara stood at the window in the towel and watched the line of the sea like a person reading the heart monitor for someone she loves and cannot fix. Without thinking, because my body remembers what it has done even when it is losing its receipts, I stepped behind her and put my forehead between her shoulder blades and felt the heat of her that way without asking the air to broker. She did not startle. She reached back with one hand and let it hover where my hip would have been and left it there anyway. We stood like that for a long time, not moving, letting the weather do the noise for us, pretending that leaning is an action that can keep a person from being pulled.By morning the storm had lost its theater and kept only the mess, a sulk of sea that slapped the pilings without showing off. We packed in the way people do when they are pretending a trip has simply ended and not changed its contract, each of us folding shirts into the same domestic squares we learned from our mothers as if neatness could unsnag the line. At the desk, JOSE had traded his flag sticker for a pumpkin pin that bobbed when he breathed. He slid the folio toward us and said the words he knew how to mean, that he hoped we had enjoyed our stay, that the taffy really is better at the shop near the kite place if you care, that the storm had been kind compared to the one three years ago that took the ice machine\u2019s mind. Mara signed in the line with her careful print, and when I took the pen it was as though I had dipped it in water; the blue made a thin show and then receded into nothing, leaving the faintest gray suggestion of my name like a rumor. JOSE glanced down and then reflexively up, but his gaze did not catch my face; it slid to the left and landed on a stack of coasters advertising a beer the motel did not serve. He tapped the paper with his finger and said, \u201cYou\u2019re all set,\u201d to the air exactly where I had been standing and I thanked him too brightly and folded the receipt like something you tuck in your shoe for luck.\n\nOn the stairs the wind tried again to make us confess. It pushed against our knees and made the lemon notebook in the glove box press its spine against the plastic like it had a heartbeat. We drove with the radio quiet for a while and let the interstate say what it says to all travelers, that you may be anyone and leaving anywhere and that it will not ask your reason. At the first rest stop the automatic sink and I came to our understanding, which is to say it refused me outright and then, after I had moved my hands in front of its black glass eye like a woman trying to teach a bird a trick, it turned a thread of water on for half a second and shut it with a spasm of disdain. The paper towel machine watched me like a cat and did not purr. Mara stepped next and the sink gushed as if happy to recognize a regular; she dried her hands and looked at me with a kindness I did not want and at the sensor with a scolding I did. \u201cWe will out-stubborn you,\u201d she told the metal, and the woman at the mirror with lipstick like a vow laughed, because sometimes other women will laugh with you when you choose your enemy and it is safe.\n\nWe made a new column in the lemon notebook called Machines, because even I like to see where the story repeats. Under it I wrote sink no, door if someone else walks with me yes, elevator yes, card reader looks me in the eye and shakes its head, microwave yes, scanner no, and then I drew a picture of the stall door latch because it had held when I asked it to and that felt like grace. On the road again the sky kept its gray in a pocket, letting out its light in brief folds, and Mara drove with her jaw set like a person who has chosen a pace and will not be bullied by the clock. Somewhere outside of Wilmington we played the game where you name houses as if they were dogs, white one with a porch is Petunia, the one with the tire swing is Huck, the brick with the glass block is Marge who makes lemon squares and pretends not to notice the money in the tin, and a small blue house that tilted slightly toward the road and looked game for anything was named Halfway because every trip needs a point to which you could return if you changed your mind.\n\nIn the part of the drive where roads become muscle memory and your body can leave your head alone for an hour, Mara said she had been thinking about a string. She said sailors, the old ones, kept a line between them when they went to the bow in weather, and that she had seen a picture once of two men with their jackets dark with rain tied to a mast like children to a story, and that she had thought it foolish and brave in the same breath. She said she was thinking about tying something to me the way you tie a key to a child\u2019s belt loop on the first week of school. I told her I would wear any string she gave me and not for the metaphor but because my chest had begun to feel like a room without a doorknob. She reached into the bag of superstition between us and took out a scarf Vivian had shoved there because in every weather there is a draft, and she folded the scarf on her thigh with the care of a woman making a bed someone will be born in. At a long stoplight in a small town that had a barber pole and a thrift store that smelled like the afterlife of church, she looped the scarf around my wrist and then around hers and tied a double knot like a woman who has fixed a hundred pieces of machinery and knows which knot tells the truth. We sat for a minute in the ordinary binding of it and both of us watched our hands to see if they would obey. The light changed and a man in a dump truck eased past us with the patience of a person with nothing left to prove.\n\nBack in Little Rock, the river lay down with the tired look of an animal after a sermon. I dropped Mara at the hospital even though she had told me not to, and we both acted surprised when the scarf fell between us like an undone promise. She went in through the volunteer door and the gray-haired woman with the clipboard smiled at her and then right past me in the same motion, and I had the childish urge to stomp my foot because sometimes indignation is easier than grief. I walked back to the car with the scarf in my hand like a leash and sat with my forehead on the steering wheel for longer than I meant to, until a man in a security golf cart tapped his horn twice, politely, to ask me not to be a hazard, and his face did the thing faces do when they see something they can\u2019t set down, a flicker and then a smoothing, as if a hand had passed over the surface of him.\n\nVivian, when I came in, had her hands in dough and a radio on low telling her about the city in its best voice. She wiped her palms on her apron and came toward me with the body of a woman greeting her child and then she stopped, not because she had seen anything but because something in the air had made a slight change, like a key turned one element toward locked instead of open. She reached and then rubbed her forearms as if she had been cold and could not name why. I told her about the motel coffee and the sign and the sink and she blew hair out of her eyes the way a girl does, and she said she had a friend who had days like that after her daughter left for Montana and that the friend had started wearing perfume again just so something would remind the room to notice her. I told Vivian that if I wore a smell it would be probably soil or oranges and she nodded solemnly like choosing a scent was a contract with the self and said she had some oil from a woman at church who made everything smell like the inside of a good decision.\n\nMy father came home from his meeting with Beau with a new coin that he put next to the old one on the mantle like two brothers he was trying to force into friendship. He made a long story short, a skill he never remembers he has, and said a man had told a thing about losing the right to be the main character of your days and how he had learned to be grateful for it, and my father said he had almost stood up to argue and then had kept his seat and his mouth and that in itself was growth and a miracle both. He took my face in his hands, which is his chief indulgence, and then he paused and looked at his palms and laughed at himself for checking whether I had left something there like glitter, and he kissed my forehead anyway and told me that I was, in the words of Beau, in the middle of a story and that the middle is the puddle of it and the place you mistake for the end. I could have kissed Beau, saint of middle parts, right then and there for giving my father that sentence to hand me like a cup of water.\n\nAt work, the office had the dignity of a person who has been through a storm and put her hair back up. The blinking sign still stuttered but it was a friend\u2019s stutter. Tasha had indeed spun my chair and it had the faint smell of impulsive perfume, which I told her made it sit better. She kissed the air at me and then stopped, because her body is wise, and she said, \u201cPermission?\u201d and I said yes and we bumped shoulders like birds. She did not say the word ghost or any of its cousins because she is a woman who knows a word can call a thing to the table like a summons. She gave me a file labeled CALDWELL, SIGNAGE in her neat fifth-grade teacher letters and then whispered that Mr. Boone had asked about the ocean and she had told him it was wet and he had laughed like a good man. When he came to my door he put his hands in his pockets and looked at the floor first, a habit of his that I am fond of because it means he is about to try to be kinder than he knows how. He said he had decided he was going to start coming in on time just to see what would happen to the fabric of the world. I told him it would snag and then mend. He told me his son said hello, which I doubted, and that the school board woman with the neon shoes had called and said their auditor had cried in the supply room, which I respected, and then he asked if I wanted to take a Wednesday to not be here and I told him the truth, which is that I want to but wanting does not always move me.\n\nTeague, with his folds of fabric and his adjectives, came to show me the new mock-ups and stood in the doorway like a man posing for a portrait of a person who sells signs. He did not call me Deborah and I decided to count that as victory. He laid the papers on the desk like cards and tapped a corner and said he had taken my note about the barbecue place wanting to look like it knew how to forgive you for leaving and that he had tried a font that looked as if someone\u2019s uncle had a steady hand in 1978. When he lifted the top sheet the next one stuck as if by wet, and he said, \u201cHuh,\u201d and then smiled his salesman smile at the air as if it had considered buying. \u201cStatic,\u201d he said apologetically, and I nodded as if its name calmed me, and he reached to separate them and his fingers went perfectly through the margin my hand had made a moment earlier. He jerked back and made a joke about the paper being sharp and I let him have it, because sometimes everybody deserves a soft lie.\n\nBecause I am not brave but wish to be, I took a bus after work to the hospital to find Annabeth, who has a badge that says DOCTOR in the way you put a bell over a word to make it understood. She has hair like a hymn and a laugh with the bark still in it, and she looked at me the way people look at a painting they haven\u2019t learned to love yet and plan to, respectfully, with a little apology. She did not check my reflexes or ask me to count backward by sevens or draw a clock, though she told me what other people would ask and I thanked her in advance for skipping their script. She asked instead what the machines say yes to and what they deny, and she asked when it is worse and when the world sighs and lets me in, and I said, surprising myself, that it is worse when I am about to say a thing that would rearrange the furniture of a room and that it is better when I am giving someone change for a ten at a fundraiser and miscount by accident and everyone laughs. She nodded like I had offered her an interesting flavor. She said that some brains take you out of your body when there is a lion, and that some decide there is a lion when there is love, which is another kind of catastrophe, and that sometimes this is a trick you can learn to take apart with breath and a word and sometimes it is the world\u2019s trick and then your job is to carry it like a bowl. \u201cYou are not broken,\u201d she said like a person telling a child that their shoes will do fine. \u201cYou are not a magician, the bad kind. And even if you were, I have met a great many women who exist only slightly and you are not one of them. Where can you feel yourself the most?\u201d she asked, and I thought of the place where my head meets my neck and of the way sound catches under the sternum like a moth and I told her the truth, which is that my voice does not betray me.\n\nMara came at the end of the day in her scrub top and tired shoulders and brought me a small machine wrapped in a towel like a baby. \u201cIt\u2019s a thermal thing,\u201d she said with the glee of a person who knows a toy might save the world. \u201cWe use it for the engine room,\u201d she added, as if hospitals had those, and I put my hand up like a child in a schoolyard and she took the camera and aimed and showed me the bloom of my neck, the heat at my chest where my heart insists, the cool at my fingers that surprised her and did not me. She aimed at my palm and I watched the colors make their appeal and I felt like I was watching a weather map of a place I had visited and could not recollect the details of. \u201cYou see?\u201d she whispered, not because anyone was asleep but because we have both begun to whisper when we get too close to naming. \u201cYou are not nothing. You are noise. The good kind.\u201d She took a picture of the cat as he walked in like a mayor and he made a glorious flame. He paused by my leg and hesitated, which is his version of affection, and then rubbed his head against the couch instead and threw me a look as if to say that everyone is complicated and he has decided that is the only fun we get.\n\nWe tried the scarf experiment the next night in my apartment because I decided being foolish is better done at home. We tied it from wrist to wrist again and lay on the floor like girls reading magazines, only one of the magazines was the lemon notebook and the other was a back issue of a medical journal that had a picture of a spine like a sea creature. We pulled gently, left then right, and when I closed my eyes and let her move me I felt the tug like the smallest approval and something in me unclenched and I laughed and then cried in the same breath, which is my version of the body taking off a sweater. She kissed the inside of her own wrist where the knot lay like a charm and I pretended she had kissed mine and was pleased with the pretending because sometimes make-believe is the only way to cross a street. We fell asleep like that, wrists cinched, and woke to find the scarf coiled on the rug with the petulance of objects that have been asked to sustain something they were not designed for. The knot had slipped toward her and off me as if the night knew how to rearrange the narrative. She made a sound that was not disappointment and not anger. It was recognition.\n\nTasha, because she understands the value of loud, took me to a karaoke place on a Thursday and stood me in front of a microphone that smelled like every mouth it had ever met and said, \u201cSing badly,\u201d which is her version of a blessing. We picked a song about standing in a kitchen at midnight and we did not hit any notes that would hurt a dog and the men at the bar watched the game and not us and the woman with the baseball cap cried at a line we did not mean to underline. The machine did not doubt me. It turned my voice into paper and then into air and I could feel the way the sound bent around the room and came back to my ribs. I watched myself steam in the cheap light like rice and I wrote that down later in the lemon book because it felt like news, that you can be believed by your own mouth. When we came out into the dark a man with a trumpet on a bicycle rode by and let the instrument cough once as if to say this is an option, too, and I laughed like a person who has been chosen for a minor miracle and plans to tip well. Tasha twined her arm in mine, then pulled away deliberately and looked at my face to make sure she had not offended, and I told her silently with my shoulders that she had not and with my mouth that I am still practicing.\n\nDays began to sort themselves into categories that I refuse to make into a calendar because the minute you give something a name it asks to be called for supper every night. There were sink days and ledger days and days when numbers slid into their columns like swallows finding the right garage. There were mornings when the coin my father gave me warmed in my palm as if it were alive and days when I could not get it to change temperature at all and I told myself the apartment was simply a colder place than it felt. There were afternoons when the cat took pity and sat near me and arranged his small thunder on my shin and I wept because animals are economists and do not give what does not have use. There were evenings when Mara fell asleep in my lap and then startled when her head met the arrangement of cushions I had made to keep it from dropping to the floor, and her apology for waking was also an apology for the condition neither of us had asked for and she performed it with grace and the joke she has for sorrow: that it is neighborly to both of us and therefore should be brought mac and cheese.\n\nThe ledger misbehaved one night and then obeyed the next and I decided that paper is moodier than we allow. I bought a pencil because I wanted to make the world argue less and its lead did what lead does, wore itself down with service. I pressed the letters of I was here with more force than is required for such small words and when I finished the indentation showed on the next page, an embossing of evidence. I liked the idea that the future had already been bruised by my insistence, and I told that to the ceiling because sometimes you have to accuse your roof of complicity. The mirror in the bathroom fogged only at the edges when I breathed and sometimes not at all and I learned to take comfort in the shower because the steam did not lie; it rushed and coated and made me part of weather, and if that is all I am allowed then I can be good weather.\n\nWe went to my father\u2019s together on a Sunday when his poker men came by to pretend to care about cards and to care very much about pretzels. They dealt as if they were inventing the deck and told stories that sounded like each other because that is how men keep safe in groups. My father told none of his candle story out of respect for the fresh faces and laughed at the right places with his mouth and not his hands. Vivian handed out bowls as if she were crowning each man with the right to keep living and their eyes softened as spoons met soup. Mara sat on the floor between my father\u2019s chair and the coffee table and in the middle of someone\u2019s long-ago baseball she put her hand out and I, idiot, put mine in it and we both watched as our longtime trick disappointed us. She did not pull back. She kept her hand there, in the space where mine had meant to be, and she closed her fingers and she breathed and I did the same and to anyone watching we looked like ordinary women making a small ordinary pact. My father\u2019s eyes found us because the animal in him keeps us both and he smiled in that wide way like a prayer answered he cannot repeat aloud because it would get hurt by being said, and then he looked away deliberately in the way of people who understand that privacy sometimes is the only way to keep a thing alive.\n\nNight came like a slow good songwriter and the city pressed itself into its familiar shapes. I dreamed I was under the pier and that I could see up through the boards to the shoes of people who thought they were alone and I reached for their laces not to trip them but to tell them I was there. I woke with salt on my lips that was not taste but the memory of it and found the scarf coiled again near my wrist because I had tied it in my sleep without knowing and that felt like hope disguised as clumsiness. In the morning Mara texted me a picture of the skeleton of a leaf she had found on the hospital sidewalk and she wrote, This is what happens when the world takes everything but the shape, and I wrote back, What if shape is enough, and she wrote, Sometimes.\n\nThe next week held itself together like a cake that threatens to fall if you open the oven and we did not open it. I went to work, I went to the meeting in the basement with the chairs and the coffee that tastes like having tried, I went to the river and watched a man teach his son how to throw a line without catching his own ear, I went to the store and chatted with the cashier who always asks me to bless her even though I am an atheist with good manners, and the automatic door at the pharmacy did not open until a woman with a stroller approached beside me and then it flew back so fast the air kissed my arm as if to apologize. If there is a god watching over those doors, he has a sense of humor and a poor understanding of timing. I put these things in the lemon notebook as if bullets could pin down the air and the act of placing a dot at the end of a phrase could nail it to the day.\n\nOn Friday, because we had decided not to be bullied entirely by fear, we drove out to the lake to practice a different kind of water. The Arkansas does not speak the language of Jersey and I wanted to hear our dialect again. We stood on the bank under a sky that had pressed its iron and waited for the place where water coaxes stone to confess. I stepped in up to my shins like a person who has not learned and the chill made my teeth report. Mara held my elbow not because it would help but because sometimes pretending is the only bridge you get. A boy with a stick pretended to be Moses and the water obeyed him only as much as it must a child with an Old Testament in his grin. When we left, we were damp and we were not undone, and in the lemon book I wrote, lake easier, and the little check mark I drew after it felt like the first yes I had earned in weeks.\n\nThat night I took the coin from the windowsill where the morning makes a habit of finding it and put it in my mouth like a wafer. It tasted like a thing that has been in the hands of a man who keeps choosing and that was both iron and bread. I placed it in my father\u2019s palm later with ceremony and he pretended to scold me for drooling on dignity and then he slipped it in his pocket and patted it like you pat a child who has made a plan. Walking home I saw the stray dog again, the saint with his white face, and I crouched and offered him my hand without anticipation. He came forward without haste and sniffed and blinked and then laid his chin for a second in the air where my fingers had meant to be, and that is something no machine can do, and I stood up with him and we both looked down the street to where the flyover men were playing a song that had a new refrain and neither of us needed the words to know we were meant to keep moving.The next morning I decided to be loud in the ways that were still permitted. I put on a skirt the color of tail lights and bracelets that made opinions when I moved my wrists. At Freda\u2019s I asked for flour, just a pinch, and told her I was trying a recipe that might be improved by superstition. She cupped white onto my palm as if it were holy and said, \u201cNow you\u2019ll leave a trail,\u201d and I pressed my hands together, two prayer books, and clapped once over the counter on purpose so the dust would rise and drift toward the window where the heat writes its letters. Her niece laughed at the cloud and a child in a dinosaur T-shirt turned and said, \u201cSnow,\u201d to no one in particular. I left two finger marks on the door handle and felt a childish pride, as if I had signed a guest book in a language glass understands. Outside, a boy clipped my elbow with his scooter and said, \u201cSorry, ma\u2019am,\u201d to the space just over my shoulder. I told the air it had been forgiven and the air took its time to run the message to him.\n\nBack at the office the school board arrived with their neon emissary and a florist\u2019s worth of anxiety. The young woman with the shoes, whose name turned out to be Keely, stood in my doorway with a box of donut holes and an expression you might bring to a veterinarian when your cat has done something unspeakable to the rug. Behind her came the auditor, a woman whose hair had been forced by humidity into a halo she did not want and whose eye makeup made it look as if she had not slept since 1996. She introduced herself as Ms. Kent and shook the air where my hand was, briskly, efficiently, like a person who has learned to get through a day by making it into tasks. Her voice was the kind that makes you confess how you arranged the petty cash even when you did it ethically. We took them to the conference room. Mr. Boone came in with his tie obedient and his son\u2019s ghost hovering near him in the lack of it, and Tasha placed a pen at each chair as if we were about to sit a true or false about our souls.\n\nThe numbers did that thing numbers do when they know an audience is not charitable; they threw shadows and invented mysteries. Keely\u2019s foot jittered to a song only she could hear and Ms. Kent stacked and restacked the same three pages until it looked like she was building a small city she might then knock down for revenge. When Ms. Kent stepped into the hall and caught herself, unprofessionally, tears pricking like freckles, I followed with my voice ahead of me. I told her about the freezer room at the hospital and how Mara moved stalagmites from one socket to another during storms as if they weighed nothing because need lightens. I told her about how numbers are like cats; they will sit in your lap if you don\u2019t stare at them directly. She laughed against her will and wiped the underside of her eye with the edge of her wrist because she was wearing mascara and I have learned that women will risk much but not stripes down their cheeks if there is a choice. She thanked\u2014something\u2014for the story. She did not turn toward me, exactly; she bowed toward the corridor in my direction like a person acknowledging good lighting. When she went back in she made a generous decision about a column that could have been argued either way. Keely offered me a donut hole in celebration and I accepted it because there are days you take a sphere of fried sugar like communion and it absolves you for five minutes.\n\nAt lunch, Tasha put her shoulder against the door frame and confessed that she had been offered a job at a place with plants on desks that were watered by schedule and a policy about dogs on Fridays that read like a marriage vow. \u201cIt\u2019s in town,\u201d she said, as if telling me the town would keep us married, \u201cand they promised to let me be weirder than is safe.\u201d I told her to take it, because I am a woman who has learned that pushing people out of cages is not disloyalty. She said she hadn\u2019t decided, which means she had, and I drew her a boat on the back of a folder while she talked about health insurance and the smell of new carpet and the emotional temperature of managers who use the phrase my door is always open. The mast went straight all by itself without my will. When I showed it to her she put her thumb on the hull and pressed until the paper dented like a shoreline. \u201cThat\u2019s the place,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I go, I\u2019ll leave you my stapler,\u201d and I told her I wanted her laugh more.\n\nWe made an attempt at dinner that night as if a meal might be a test you can pass. Mara brought lemons that she pressed with a small tool shaped like a bird and I roasted a chicken with the ridiculous confidence that comes from recipes that call for salt and time. We ate, in the way the middle class does, with gratitude that sits in the room like a good friend. I tried to taste. The acid announced itself like a thin woman with a megaphone. The chicken had its human warmth, the fat ready and the skin adequate, and everything that used to be a delicate balance struck me as a set for a play I had once been in and forgotten the lines to. Mara watched my face with a look that always makes me braver and worse. \u201cTell me,\u201d she said, and I told her that the lemon tasted like the idea of lemon, the way a postcard is the idea of a place if you\u2019ve never been. She tore her piece of bread with those strong fingers and said, \u201cI can feed the part of you that still eats ideas,\u201d and then smiled like a woman who knows the scale of promises and is not afraid of that math.\n\nOn the walk after, the sidewalk was a seam the city had been too busy to tighten. A crew had left a square of wet cement under a small fence, four little metal legs like a child\u2019s playpen. Without making a plan, we both wanted our hands there. We dipped fingers like thieves, the way every mouth wants to lick frosting if invited. Mara pressed her palm, sure, leaving a whorl you could probably use to open her accounts. I pressed mine and watched the gray accept the gesture politely and then shrug. Two faint commas where my ring and my bone might leave a thought, no more. A woman in a visor pushing a stroller, as if they are a species proliferating, smiled at us and said, \u201cYour children will love finding that in twenty years,\u201d and Mara said, \u201cYes,\u201d confidently, even though we have not decided whether children belong to our plot line. I put the lemon notebook on the driver\u2019s seat later and wrote, cement says maybe, and I liked that as an answer better than no.\n\nAnnabeth met me again on the corner where the hospital breathes out its nests of parking and told me a story about a man whose arm had decided it belonged to someone else. She told it gently, with no relish for the freakish. She said, \u201cThe brain is a trickster and also the kindest nurse you ever had. Sometimes it cuts feeling so you can pass through a particular hour. Sometimes it leaves you in the room and takes the heavy box down the stairs without telling you so you think you are lazy for not helping. Sometimes it tells the world to stop touching you because you have not consented for a long time.\u201d We walked slowly and counted the way the automatic doors agreed to respond to Mara, then to me. She watched my face when I used my voice to announce myself to the metal and the glass, saying \u201chello\u201d to a door like I was arriving at a cousin\u2019s. The door behaved perfectly and Annabeth reached to take my wrist and then converted the reach, practiced now, into a gesture near my sleeve. \u201cWe will build a stupid toolkit,\u201d she said. \u201cPerfume, bells, high color, the manner of a woman with a complaint. Your voice most of all. Your voice hooks in.\u201d She told me to go into the stairwell and sing a little. I laughed and did it. The echo hugged me the way a church does if you do not owe it money. When I came out a janitor with a scent like pine in his collar said, \u201cYou made that landing nicer,\u201d to the wall, and I decided I would take compliments where they fell.\n\nThere was a day at the crosswalk when the sun believed itself a benevolent king and I stepped out with my stack of papers and confidence and a car did not slow because the car did not have brains for me. My own brain did what it had been practicing; I said my name in the middle of the street like you say amen and the driver, a woman my mother\u2019s age with a visor and good lipstick, startled like she had seen a deer on hind legs and braked. She put her hand to her heart in the old gesture as if to make sure it was still in attendance. I bowed to her like a clown at the end of a cheap trick. My knees waited to shake until I had made the opposite curb. I wrote in the lemon book, crosswalk voice wins, and underlined it, and made a little star as if I had earned a badge.\n\nAt the meeting in the basement with the coffee that warms you by guilt and then by love, Beau nodded at me the way a man nods when he is asking without asking. I said a few words because my father\u2019s shoulders had lifted into their set of please hear me and I wanted to meet him. I spoke about machines the way a child speaks about weather, too seriously and with one secret. I said that sometimes I feel like the stamp the notary uses at work has been lifted from the desk and no one knows where to put it down, and a woman three chairs away whose hands were knitting a vague blue made a sound that said she knew that landscape. After, my father hugged me full and hard and then let his hands slide to the edges of my sweater as if making sure the sweater had obeyed gravity. In the parking lot with the saucers of light we all love like UFOs, Vivian pressed a small vial into my palm that said orange blossom on a label in a woman\u2019s hand. \u201cTry this,\u201d she said. \u201cIt makes the house remember me when I come in, and I tried a million before it didn\u2019t make me feel like whoever was wearing those magazines in the 80s.\u201d It smelled like a church married to a grove. I dabbed it behind my ears and on my wrists and startled myself later when I turned my head fast and the air came with me.\n\nWhen Tasha told Mr. Boone she was taking the job with the plants and the promise, he surprised us both by leaning back, looking at the ceiling with affection, and then standing to hug her like a man who has read a pamphlet about appropriate workplace boundaries and decided to take the risk in the name of human decency. He said, \u201cYou\u2019ll ruin them in the best way,\u201d and she said, \u201cI know,\u201d and then she cried in my office not like a woman leaving but like a woman arriving somewhere that required a toll she had saved up for in jars. We spent her last hour drawing boats with serious masts on memo pads and leaving them under staplers and in drawers for the future to find when it needs directional signs. When she left that day she took the stapler and wrote me a note that said, I will staple the sky, which is nonsense and also what you want someone you love to threaten.\n\nMara had been asked to present a thing at a small conference in Wilmington about exactly the machines she loved and cursed. \u201cIt\u2019s hardly anything,\u201d she said, \u201cjust me saying that organization is not a personality flaw,\u201d and I told her to call it what it is, a miracle. I pretended I had a choice about whether to go and she pretended we could be prudent and we both did that adult dance until we tripped over the truth. We booked a cheap hotel with carpets that looked like the idea of weather and a broken chalkboard out front that still promised a continental breakfast even though the chalk no longer took. My mother sent a postcard from California that week with a drawing of pelicans arranged like comets and she wrote my name correctly and then underlined it as if to see how it looked, and in the corner she scrawled, \u201cDo you ever think how much of life is waiting in halls?\u201d and I wanted to call and say yes, but I don\u2019t know what you waited for, and also to ask her whether pelicans still stole lunches right off blankets. I pinned the card to the cork board with a pushpin that bent like a tired person and thought of her in fog and me in our heat and Mara near a storm line and all of us trading weather like recipes.\n\nThe night before we left I took the orange blossom and dotted the inside of my scarf and the inside of the jacket I wear when I want to be taken seriously and the hem of the T-shirt I sleep in because I planned to take it off and put it in Mara\u2019s bag. She watched me do it and I watched her watch me and there are entire marriages built on such small ceremonies. We made tea because that is what you do when you have decided to leave a place for a place that has water plotted against you. The kettle sang, as kettles are generous enough to do, and I poured and tasted nothing and tasted everything because the smell put a cloak on the nothing. We sat on the floor with our backs against the couch, our knees up like children making forts, and went over the list of simple weapons: voice, color, scent, the name of a person said in the room like a claim. \u201cAnd if all else fails,\u201d she said, \u201cI will tie you to things,\u201d and I told her I was starting to find it sexy, which made her laugh that laugh that has saved me from five different cliffs.\n\nWe left before the traffic learned how to be cruel and the road offered itself up in long gray scrolls. The strangeness of travel is you become more yourself and less at the same time. The automatic soap dispensers at the first stop offended me and then relented and I curtsied to the paper towels because you may as well thank the gods for their crumbs. In the car, the lemon notebook\u2019s pages were beginning to have that dog-eared look of devotion. Under Machines I added, hotel key card works if someone else tries first, and under People I put, cashier called me hon to the air and it warmed me anyway. Mara drove the way she always does, like a pilot making decisions no one else sees, and sang along to a woman with a voice like rope and violets. We crossed a stretch where the land had been shaved down to bones and the horizon made a solemn promise and kept it. When we arrived, the hotel smelled like last week\u2019s rain and a bowl of apples that was not actually there.\n\nHer talk was in a room with carpet trying to be a forest and chairs that resent their bolts. She set up her slides, which were the careful kind that do not wrestle an audience but lead them up a path by the elbow. I sat near the back with a Styrofoam coffee that tasted like all the churches in America and watched her make a room unlazy. She said the names of machines the way other women say the names of children into microphones and she did not pretend to like any of them more than they deserved. After, a man with a tie that had too many opinions said something about algorithms and she managed to be kind and precise at once, which is her knife work. A woman in a green cardigan asked a question so gently it was almost a confession and Mara answered like a balm. When the applause came it sat down properly, not overeager, the better sort of appreciation. By the snack table a person trying to keep the grapes from rolling into the cookie platter asked me if I had enjoyed our keynote and I said yes and wanted to say more and did not because explanation always costs a toll.\n\nWe walked after, because if there is a body of water within a mile Mara will negotiate me toward it without me noticing. The Cape Fear wore its bad name with class. The air had salt in its breath even upriver. A man on a bench played a guitar with only five strings and still found us a song. The pier had planks that had listened to more stories than wood should be asked to hold. As we stepped, the light took on that drama school quality it has near closing time. I watched our shadows again because once you begin you cannot stop. Mine did not go missing, not entirely; it limped, then thickened, then refused, like a friend who will not come to your party and then does at the last minute with a casserole. Mara took my hand in the way you will if you have decided to stop being careful, and for a moment her fingers warmed the place my fingers would have been as if heat still obeyed the old rules. It was not the cinematic moment where everything snaps into a lesson. It was two women with a lemon notebook and a scarf and a past and a river and a promise and a cliff.\n\nThat night, in the bed with the rustle of sheets that have been laundered out of their softness, I said the sentence I had been rehearsing for months in my mouth. I said it in the dark because truth looks less formal in the dress she sleeps in. I told her that I loved her and that it was the kind of love that felt like a tide chart I kept folded in my purse even when the river behaved. When I had finished and there was the space afterwards where the air decides if it will give you back what you have pressed into it, she reached for me and her hand passed into the heat by my shoulder and came back with nothing but proof. She said my name very softly, a way I had not yet heard, the way people say a country when they have finally crossed its border. She said she loved me back, and I saw the word go into the room and put its lamp down and open curtains. We kissed with fabric between us, my foolish scarf and her mouth and mine, the way children play marriages in school with mittens and veils borrowed, and it was ridiculous and decent and I would have married the absurd right then for the service it provided. Beneath the cloth I could feel her breath and hear the small noise she makes when her heart permits joy, which is an animal sound, not a word. It anchored me better than any belt could.\n\nIn the morning the hotel breakfast was a democracy of carbs and two apples that had seen things. We took a cinnamon roll to the river and tore it like sisters in a fable and fed the gulls even though a sign asked us not to because the sign had no gulls to scold. The sky had the posture of a person on the edge of deciding if they would leave the party. Mara tipped her head back to let the wind lift her hair and then squared her shoulders because she has never been good at letting weather be in charge. \u201cOne more walk,\u201d she said, and we went to the ferry steps where the river pretends to be a road. The boards there had been worn to language. A man in a shirt that had been white told us to watch our feet because the splinters had made a union. We watched. We walked anyway.\n\nOn our way back, a child with a balloon shaped like a fish let go because the sky is better at invitations than parents are at warning. The fish went to its god and the child made the sound children make when they have lost a kingdom. Mara started to run without thinking because she is the kind of woman who thinks she can persuade physics by argument. I called her name the way I have learned to call it when I am at the edge of the street and the cars have not agreed on me yet, and she stopped and turned and the balloon was already on its way to the afterlife of latex. The mother thanked a radius of people and the mother\u2019s friend adjusted her visor and the child hiccuped like a broken metronome. We walked on, our shadows behaving within acceptable error margins. The lemon notebook had its new page waiting and I put, ferry boards said yes, and then I wrote it again because repetition makes a thing truer to me, even if it annoys other people.\n\nOn the drive home the rain decided we were not to be tested further and let us keep the dry. Somewhere past the state line the stray dog crossed my mind like a benediction and I said it out loud without meaning to. \u201cThe saint,\u201d I said, and Mara said, \u201cWhich one?\u201d and I told her about the white face and how he had put his chin where my fingers would have been and she said, \u201cThat is how I plan to love you when it all is its worst,\u201d and we both sat in that sentence like a pew and let it do its job. When we got back to the apartment, the coin on the sill flashed once at the last light and I touched it with my mouth again because I am foolish and crave metal in my narrative. The orange blossom had held at the throat of my jacket and when I hung it on the chair the room leaned toward me as if to ask what I had learned.\n\nLater, when sleep did its patchwork, I dreamed I was inside a library where all the books were ledger paper and each column had my handwriting and every I was here had a smudge where a thumb had gone not quite through but tried. The librarian wore Tasha\u2019s raspberry nails and said I could take out only three at a time, and when I protested she insisted, smiling, that rationing makes you spend slower and love harder. I woke with the scarf under my hand like an obedient pet and the first edge of panic not attending, for once, like a bad neighbor. I lay there and watched the weak morning try to convince itself to be day and I felt the weight of my voice in my mouth and the thought I had not dared think yet was this: there might be a place on the map where everything will either decide or undo, and we are walking toward it not because we love to be ruined but because all the streets we choose are the same street in the end. I did not write that in the lemon book because some lines do not want paper near them yet. I wrote instead, tomorrow buy more flour, and put the pen down like a promise.The week had a new hinge. It swung easier some hours, stubbornly others, and I learned to listen for the squeak the way you listen for a kettle when you\u2019re in the next room. I wore the orange blossom and watched men with clipboards pause in doorways like they had forgotten what they came for and then remember. I spoke my name to empty rooms sometimes, a superstition that embarrassed me if I thought about it too hard, so I tried not to. Tasha collected her plants from the windowsill on a Wednesday and introduced them to the light with the gravity of a god. \u201cThis is Meyer,\u201d she told the sun, and then she turned to me and pressed her forehead to mine without touching and said, \u201cThis is where we make the warm ourselves,\u201d and I told her I was not that kind of appliance and she grinned and said, \u201cYou are,\u201d and then cried after she\u2019d said goodbye to Mr. Boone in the supply closet because she is the kind of person who gives her best minutes to places that will miss her later and pretend they don\u2019t.\n\nShe sent me a picture from her new place a week later of a desk with a toy robot and a plant with long hair and a mug that said \u201cmake it weird,\u201d and she wrote, they clap when I say I\u2019m leaving for lunch, and then, I think I might learn to like applause that doesn\u2019t require me to sing. I sent back a photo of the lemon notebook with the page titled People and under it my tidy list of the ways the day had agreed to see me: the dry cleaner who said \u201csweetheart\u201d in the direction of my shoulder and meant me, the child who looked straight at me and declared my hair a color, the woman at the pharmacy who asked what perfume and then, without waiting, said, \u201cOrange blossom, good choice,\u201d and my own voice, my honest, tacky savior.\n\nMara kept the scarf in her bag like a talisman, and sometimes, in an elevator or at the bottom of a hospital stairwell when she had fifteen years of air left between tasks, she texted, tie? and I texted back yes even if my hands were busy, because the act itself did a kind of work that breath couldn\u2019t. Annabeth, in the way of a person who is good at not making too big a meal of your fear, sent me an email with a list so simple it could be printed on a recipe card: \u201csmell, sound, color, friction, name,\u201d and I taped it inside a cabinet where the bowls live so I could read it while I found the right one for cereal. My father took to pausing at the threshold of rooms like a man about to say grace and then remembering he did not need to. He would glance at the coin and I would see in his eyes the quick calculation of days he had not been a certain kind of man and he would smile a small private smile and then say, louder, \u201cTea?\u201d because sometimes you do not say hope out loud because you are afraid it will leave through the window if it hears its own name.\n\nOn a Thursday that did not announce itself as important, my mother called. Her number was a geography I do not travel and I watched it ring twice before I picked it up because I wanted to practice not wanting. She began not with hello but with, \u201cI am near a pier that is ashamed of itself,\u201d and in the background I could hear gulls and the sound of a man dragging a cooler as if everyone in California must have the same neighbors as ours. She said she had been thinking of the word undertow and had decided it made people blame the water for wanting what it wants and that she preferred riptide because it sounded like a mood. She told me a woman named Wally had invited her to a reading on a boat and she had said yes even though boats make her remember that she is small, and then she said my name correctly and it was as if a bird had flown into a window and remained whole anyway. She asked me if I had been happy lately with a consideration that startled me, the way strangers can be so kind that you feel both loved and anonymous, and I said, after a breath that felt like a rehearsal, that I had been something near it and sometimes inside it and once in a while exactly it. \u201cGood,\u201d she said, as if I had put a check beside a box she had been carrying around all day. \u201cSomeone should be,\u201d she added, and then she told me the shape of the fog on the bay and how it made blades out of ordinary things and I wanted to ask her who taught her to miss people sideways, but the call was already ending in that way some calls do, the way that makes you feel like a commercial for a product you both won\u2019t buy.\n\nIt was Mara who said it, like a dare and like a gift, in the quiet after my mother\u2019s voice had left my walls. \u201cOne more ocean before the cold,\u201d she said. \u201cA meaner one than Jersey. Not because I want to be punished but because I want to stand next to a true thing and feel it not lie to me.\u201d I looked at the map in my head where money sits like small weights and I saw the lines we could draw and where they would arc and what they would ask of the ledger, and I said, \u201cWe will find a ticket under the couch,\u201d and she smiled because sometimes her belief in my tricks is the only magic I accept. Flights are the kind of extravagance that if you squint can look like prudence; time is money in a way that money never manages to be time. We bought two seats to Boston with a credit card that looked at us and shrugged and said, \u201cAll right,\u201d and we promised ourselves we would sit in the airport like ladies who have always known how to read the departures board with elegance.\n\nI was worried about the machines. Annabeth did not laugh. \u201cThey will like you more than the doors,\u201d she said. \u201cThey do not have to decide in the same way. You will be light on their screens and heavy where it matters.\u201d At the airport the first automatic door, perhaps out of regional pride, made a show of opening for us three full steps before it needed to, and I pretended to curtsey. At the security line, a man with a badge that had his name but not his face smiled at Mara and then gave his smile to the tray into which she put our shoes. I took off my bracelets and they clinked like a sentence under heavy punctuation. The woman at the scanner had a voice like a good bus driver, loud without cruelty. \u201cStep in. Feet on the yellow. Hands up.\u201d I did what she said because I am sometimes a doer when told. The cylinder purred around me and the picture I could not see made someone I could not see nod and then shake their head. \u201cAgain,\u201d the driver said, softer. Mara had already put her shoes on and was rolling her eyes at her own feet, which always forget one sock in the corner of her bag. \u201cAgain,\u201d the woman said one more time, the third with the kind of patience good people mistake for duty. When I stepped out she motioned me gently with an open palm to the side where another agent held a pair of hands over a table as if warming them for a song.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to do a pat down,\u201d she said, very formal, and her eyes kept sliding to my left in that way people have started to watch the air. \u201cConsent?\u201d she added, and I wanted to hug her for remembering the word that makes it all bearable. \u201cConsent,\u201d I said, and she did her careful pressing, the back of her hand where there are laws about how to touch even when touching is part of the job, and it was not that she passed through me; it was that she seemed to find the edges of me where they were clearest and move around the places the world had left blank like a person stepping around a puddle in the dress she saved up for. \u201cThank you,\u201d she said, as if I had granted her a favor by existing, and we both pretended I had not been a question.\n\nOn the plane a woman with a magazine and nails the color of cherries took the seat across the aisle and fell in love with the baby two rows up without ever introducing herself. Mara squeezed my knee when the sky tried to argue with the wing because planes are good at reminding you that you are in a box floating in a mood. I held the scarf under my palm and tried to remember the exact feeling of her skin when our hands still docked without a broker. The city was a puzzle we left behind for someone else to finish. In the air, the landscape gives up form and turns into narrative; rivers are lines, lakes are commas, clouds are a paragraph the wind is editing. When we dropped into Boston, the ground came up to meet us like an old friend who has been practicing how not to hurt you with enthusiasm. The airport there smelled like salt and coffee and the first day of college. The taxi driver had a picture of a boy in a soccer uniform propped on his dashboard where the fish had sat in ours. He told us, without being asked, the best places to get chowder, and then, without meaning to, the story of the time he got lost on the way to his wife in labor and how the baby had forgiven him eventually by coming home late every day from school for a month like a ritual.\n\nWe drove up the coast in a borrowed car with a heater that sounded like an argument. The signs were full of towns that made my mouth feel like it was learning an accent. Marblehead. Gloucester. Rockport. The water here did not fuss; it brooded. The rocks were not decorations; they had jobs. We stopped where a woman in a red hat told us to because everybody tells travelers the same secrets and we believe them because we want to be on the right side of the myth. The wind went straight through my sweater with the candor of an old aunt. The smell was the kind that makes your teeth answer, clean and briny and the opposite of sweet. We found a stretch of path that had been obliged to exist by generations of people who insisted that walking beside trouble is part of a life well-lived. The railing was a moral suggestion, not a promise. Mara took her camera out not to take pictures but to make her hands behave like visitors.\n\nWe walked with our bodies angled forward, not because we were eager but because the wind asked us to introduce ourselves. The tide was in a mood. The rocks took it as they had always taken it, with the resigned nobility of elders at weddings. A woman in a mustard coat was laughing into her scarf and a man with a face the color of a good table watched her as if the laugh were a sport he had paid to see. Mara pointed with her chin toward a place where the water tried and tried at a seam in the rock, a rhythm older than our superstition. \u201cThis is the one,\u201d she said, and then added, \u201cnot for drama but for scale,\u201d and I nodded even though nodding in this wind felt like giving away part of your face.\n\nWe sat when the railing insisted we should and when we got up we pretended we had not been obeying. I looked for my shadow because I am a fool and because keeping count of how many times the world remembers me has become like counting your steps when you don\u2019t want to think about death. It came and went in the stubby way northerly light makes everyone a little shorter. Mara put her hand palm-up near mine without quite touching and I lowered mine into that waiting the way you set a feat of pastry into an oven and then do not open the door. We did not make a shape the world could recognize. We made an intention and left it there between us where the sea could borrow it for a minute like a dish left to cool.\n\nThere are towns in Massachusetts where the houses are so clean-faced you feel you must ask permission to breathe. Ours had an inn with wallpaper that looked like someone had painted the inside of a shell and thought better of it halfway through. The woman at the desk put down a ledger like a stage prop and I loved her on sight for giving paper the respect I give it. She handed Mara a pen as if passing a baton in a race and then, to me, a key with a heavy fob that said 12 in an ambitious font. The key weighed like proof. I carried it with ceremony and set it on the table in our room like a bell we would ring when the evening needed to change shape. In that room, which had two chairs that had not agreed on who should be comfortable, the window gave us a slice of ocean the way pie is sliced for greedy cousins. We shrugged off our coats grudgingly and I rubbed my hands together in the old childish way that makes parents say you will set yourself on fire and then I cupped them around my mouth and said my name softly and watched my breath fog the glass and declare me present and then decide I had been presumptuous and recede.\n\nNight here was a different animal than the night at home. It hunted slower, with better posture. We went down to the small restaurant where men pretended to know oysters and women actually did and the chalkboard claimed chowder three times as if to prove it would not run out if it were forced to repeat itself. The waitress wore her hair like a vote and called everyone friends and meant it as a bribe. We ate, because eating is how you say yes to a place, and Mara made the soup seem like an event. I watched the color on her mouth and decided that lipstick is a kind of announcement I had been too timid to make my whole life. We walked home with our hands in our pockets like teenagers who have stolen cigarettes and are pretending the cold is the reason their fingers feel wrong.\n\nIn bed, under a duvet that clearly came from a catalog that arrives addressing you as if you are already who you want to be, we made our small adjustments. The scarf lay between our pillows like a referee that does not blow its whistle. The heat knocked in the wall like an upstairs neighbor. We talked in that sleepward way that makes sentences sound like recipes mumbled in kitchens you have loved. I said, because the thoughts had lined up and recruited me as their witness, that this place felt like the kind of place where you find out who is brave and who simply looks it. She said, because she is the sort of person who finds courage in the correct drawer, that the difference is irrelevant when the wave is knee-high and very relevant when it is not, and that either way she did not plan to go in past her thighs. I told her that a thigh is a promise as well as a body part and she laughed into the pillow and told me to save metaphors for when the restaurant ran out of pie.\n\nMorning made us new. It always tries. We put on clothes that made us look like we intended to be dignified about wind, which is a farce and also a fight worth picking. We stood on the rocks because everyone stands on the rocks; it is the choreography of visitors, and we would not insult the dance by pretending an originality we did not have. I tied the scarf around my wrist and then around hers and the knot perversely looked like a heart and we rolled our eyes at the coincidence and let it be. A man with a dog said to watch our step and then looked a hair left of my face and repeated it as if he had told the news to the wrong person first and was correcting his etiquette. We thanked him in stereo.\n\nDown the path a woman in a purple hat was making a devotional of photographs. She crouched, she stood, she crouched again, the way belief makes you bob sometimes. The water did its long arithmetic against the granite. It sent up spray in small astonishments. There was a spot where the steps had been carved into the stone by someone with a patience you only see in New England carpenters or thieves, and the salt had done its bleaching and sanding so that sometimes you forgot the steps were not bones. \u201cNot down there,\u201d Mara said, not because she thought I would but because she needed to hear herself say a boundary out loud. The wind played the old joke of trying to pull my hood off my head. I put it back on, not because I wanted to keep my hair dry but because I wanted to quarrel with an element and win one small round.\n\nWe stood where the spray could pretend to baptize us without truly wetting our feet. The sea made that sound that is so much like a crowd that you almost turn to see if strangers have decided to sing. I put my mouth near her ear and I said, lightly to prove I can still be light, that the lemon notebook was sitting in the room on the desk and would likely, if it could, write in itself about the angles of this place. She turned and her cheek brushed the scarf and the scent of orange blossom rose like a forgiveness, and she made her surprise face at the way it moved through the cold, and she said she wanted to sit in a pew that smelled like this when she was old. We made a plan without making it: after this rock, that one; after that one, the bench; after the bench, the path back where tea gloats and we let it. Plans are a religion we practice because nothing else asks so little.\n\nThe first big shot of water came when we were not looking, because that is how show-offs work. It was theatrical and not mean, and it wet our jeans to the shin and made the child part of me giggle and the adult part of me inventory our phones. The second did not arrive soon after because it was not the second; it was an accountant wave, biding time, waiting to be wise. Between the two, the sun shouldered through a stripe of cloud and made the wet rock shine in a way that makes it look like a coin you want to pick up even if someone tells you it belongs to a saint. The old saying about never turning your back is the sort of thing people write on magnets, and you forget until the day the ocean spouses itself to your story without your consent. We did not turn our backs. We were not heroic. We did the stupid smart thing of thinking we knew the shape of a minute.\n\nA gull cried like a hinge. The dog barked at its shadow. A group of teenagers at the far end of the path made the noise all teenagers make, the one that is laughter and a dare. The light went a little sideways. \u201cAfter that splash, home,\u201d Mara said\u2014and then stopped talking, because discourse had to be negotiated with the air. I stood, the way you stand when you are inside the picture and you do not want to drain it of anything by moving. The wind took a breath. The sea gathered etiquette or nerve, I cannot say which.\n\nWe saw it begin: the curl far out, the suggestion of a shoulder about to be thrown. It\u2019s odd what the eye decides to narrate. I remember thinking, from nowhere sensible, that this was the exact color of a bruise that starts to heal. I remember seeing the scarf\u2019s knot and thinking I should have learned a different one, the kind sailors use that knows how to be loyal. I remember the shape of Mara\u2019s mouth changing not to fear but to work. The water stood up. It is hard to tell this part without making it more polite than it was. It was not a cliff falling on a church. It was not a window shattering into roses. It was water, and the sky took a mouthful of her because that was the piece of the world nearest to it that could prove gravity is only a suggestion when the ocean is in the mood.\n\nThere was a sound I cannot put into music. It was wood and teeth and a choir chair being dragged across linoleum. The wave came not in a sheet but in a hand with too many fingers. It reached around the shoulder of the rock and made a small correction in our math. The scarf tightened and then tried to think. The knot did its best work, which was not enough work for this. Her knees went light. My feet found nothing they trusted. The railing where it was a suggestion suggested we hold it; I held air and the memory of wood and the memory was generous but it forgot to be solid. The teenagers were suddenly saints, one of them shouting hoarsely, the kind of hoarse that takes hours of laughing to earn, and the dog took three authoritative steps backward because dog wisdom is the better kind. I said her name with my chest. The wind said no in five dialects. The scarf, faithful as an oath said too fast, slid.\n\nBodies do what bodies are born to do. She reached with that left hand I have watched tie a thousand patient knots on childhood and grown-up tangles and it went through the place my right hand had earned by long practice and could not make now. The world glitched; it did not stop. I felt the heat of her near me the way you feel an idea right before it arrives. Then the wave took the back of her coat in its mouth and stepped down from the stage. The step wasn\u2019t dramatic. The step was banal, the way accidents in kitchens are banal, a cut that bleeds more than is fair. She went forward and down with grace because she is that kind of woman even in physics. The scarf went slack in my palm in that obscene way cloth goes dead when it is not being asked to be a boundary anymore.\n\nI did not scream, not at first. Not because I am brave. Because there is a lag when something your theory of the world depends on is revised by water. The man with the dog shouted something that had numbers in it; a number you dial when you are correct and want to feel you participated. The mustard coat ran. The teenagers turned into rescue, the verb. There was a rope somewhere because men in towns like this are never more than thirty feet from a coil of rope in any season. Someone threw the rope too short. Someone else threw it like he had been born for this offering. The wave that had taken a bite rolled her further than I wanted a person I loved to roll and then did the decency of letting her show her face, coughing and furious, and then the stone took her side like an indifferent friend, blocking what it could of the fuss. I moved because my body, the part of it that can still vote, told me the worst sin is theater when someone is drowning. I got on my knees because a nun in me remains. I put my hands into the wave with the gall of a child who has never had to ask permission. It gave me cold. That is the truth I will never argue with it about. It gave me cold and noise and the memory of her shoulder between my palms and the precise knowledge that I would trade math for touch for the rest of my days and the universe will not accept that currency.\n\nWhen they got a loop around her waist she did not fight as hard as you would think. She is practical, and she is not the sort of person who refuses help because pride is a more precious possession than breath. The men leaned their weight back in a mutual trust fall with rock and salt supervising. The rope, honest in the way rope is, did what it had been taught. The water tried, like a suitor with poor timing, and was refused. She came against my knees and I made a cradle of my lap that my lap could not be, and she lay half on the stone and half on an ambition we had both been keeping. Her eyes met mine, not cinematic at all, just two tired eyes trying to find the place to rest that does not require apology. \u201cOkay,\u201d she said, not to me, to the moment, like a woman agreeing to be put under for a surgery she wants to wake from. Then she coughed and rolled and sat and put the heels of her hands into her eyes as if to push the sea back with bone.\n\nMany things happened around us in ritual order: phones gave up their attention to maps and acquired it for the men in coats; a siren placed its color in the air like a marker; the woman with the purple hat kept taking pictures even though decency had a case to make against her, and she kept them for herself, not because she was cruel but because sometimes you witness and your only language is to collect. The wind selected a few sentences and tore them up just to show us it could. The rope fell into obedient loops on the ground like something that would ask to be put away properly later and be thanked for its service. The scarf, traitorous and faithful both, lay against my thigh and I wanted to bite it and kiss it and tie it around the neck of the sea.\n\nInside the inn, the woman with the ledger turned into a nurse with a kettle and a wool blanket without having to change clothes. She made tea the way instruction manuals tell you to make tea and forced mugs into our hands that I held because heat and ceramic are a church too. Mara was shivering and telling her body to quit the dramatics, the way she tells a machine to stop an alarm with a palm like a blessing, and we did the little obedient things people do after large resistances: we took off wet socks, we rubbed ankles with the corners of towels, we said we were fine, we said thank you enough times that the word turned into its sound without meaning. The purple hat sat two chairs away and did not have the grace to look sorry; she had the grace to look earnest, which is sometimes better.\n\nWhen we were alone, the kettle quiet after impressing itself on the room, we looked at the lemon notebook on the bedside table. It was open because I had left it that way as if to let the day write its name when we were gone. I picked up the pen and wrote with a hand that had learned nothing and everything, \u201crock path, rope, wave with a mouth,\u201d and the ink did not pool; it sank right in, thirsty as if I had finally been telling the truth with the right nib. Mara took the pen and wrote, very small and very neat, \u201cdid not die,\u201d and then put a period, not because she believed in conclusions but because she needed to end one sentence.\n\nWe drove down the coast later than we meant to, not because we were afraid of the place but because we were a little in love with it, the way you sometimes keep talking with a person who has been rude because their rudeness was honest and it taught you something useful about your own manners. In Boston we returned the car like people who had taken a child to the park and not let it run past the fence. At the airport the doors opened in the same mean way every time, as if they had decided to stop mocking me and simply perform their trick. The scanner hummed and the woman with the bus driver voice nodded me through with the efficiency of someone who has had enough miracles for one shift and is not collecting any more. On the plane, a man across the aisle snored with a toddler\u2019s abandon and the flight attendant smiled like a woman who had seen worse and will again.\n\nBack home, the river had retreated into behaving and the dog with the saint\u2019s face was asleep in a patch of afternoon like he had rented the square for the hour. Vivian put her hands on my cheeks and then on Mara\u2019s and then on the air in front of the two of us and laughed because sometimes laughter is cheaper than panic and tiny enough to go in your pocket. My father took one look and sat down because sitting is his act of respect when the story has been larger than is fair. He pressed the coin into my palm with the relief of a man handing back a baby and told me to keep it until the end of the week, and I did not argue because sometimes being obedient is the kind of love that matters.\n\nNight fell and I did not go to sleep. I sat with my ledger like a widow with knitting and I wrote I was here not in the line but in the margin, as if I needed to say it off record, away from the part that will be audited. The ink behaved. My voice behaved, when I used it to make the word sound in the kitchen at two in the morning. The scarf lay on the back of a chair and looked like a snake that had decided to understand compassion. Mara wrote from three floors and two blocks away that she could still feel the sea in the cartilage of her ears and that she planned to fall asleep saying the name of every fish she could think of to put a fence around it. I wrote back that I could come over and read her a taxonomy and she replied with the word \u201clater,\u201d the way people promise to keep living, and I held the phone warm until it cooled, and when I finally set it down it made the smallest noise on the table, a coin, a stone, a proof.",

Numbers don\u2019t ask about the drift between your shoulder blades when you wake at three. They let you bring the coffee to your lips (or pretend to) and sit in your chair and tell yourself that you are good at this, that you, Deirdre Keene, are reliable. Spreadsheets do not wonder what you meant to say last week and couldn\u2019t. They do not ask why, sometimes, you forget the taste of sugar.\n\nOn Monday mornings in Little Rock the air along Main Street sticks. There\u2019s the little bakery where the baker, a woman named Freda who always wore bright scarves no matter the humidity, rolled out dough behind the window. The men under the flyovers had their guitars and greasy caps and this way of watching traffic like the river was lodged inside the windshield glass. Our office had a blinking sign with KEEFE & BOONE, CPAs stuttering through the heat like a cheap promise. I\u2019d arrive before anyone else, because the office felt cleaner with the lights off, because there are forms of silence you can only catch before eight a.m. I liked to slide into my chair, set my bag down like I was setting down a pet rabbit, lift my hands above the keyboard. That first settling, as if I might breathe myself into the grid.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re early again,\u201d Tasha would say when she came in at eight\u2013thirteen, a stack of mail and her purse knocked against her hip. Tasha is the kind who laughs with her front teeth, and if you tell her a secret she will carry it around like a warm roll in a napkin. Put it on a plate later and ask if you want butter.\n\n\u201cI like the quiet,\u201d I said on that particular Monday. \u201cHelps me remember what I meant to do.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat you meant to do was send the Hudson inventory sheet, your noon meeting is Mr. Ellison\u2014oh wait, no, not Ellison. Something else. You know what? I\u2019ll print your schedule. You hungry?\u201d\n\nShe said hungry with her mouth buttery. I said I already had a piece of toast, which wasn\u2019t exactly true. I had lifted the toast to my mouth and held it there until I could smell it. I thought I could smell it. Burnt edges, salt of the butter. When I finally set it down there was no bite mark. I didn\u2019t feel like thinking about that part.\n\nMr. Boone shuffled in a little after nine, straight from his car, tie still folded on the passenger seat, hair laid flat like he\u2019d ironed it with a book. He peeked into my office. \u201cDeirdre. We\u2019ve got\u2014did Tasha tell you? The school board wants an extension. The young woman with the neon shoes called and said they\u2019ve got an auditor coming Monday next, so not to expect\u2014\"\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll draft the extension,\u201d I said, fingers already reaching for the letterhead. \u201cDo we have their updated totals on revenue from events?\u201d\n\n\u201cAsk my son, if he ever remembers to show up,\u201d Mr. Boone said. His son never remembered to show up. Sometimes I wondered if the son was a myth. \u201cAnd Deirdre,\u201d he added, voice softer, \"how was yesterday?\"\n\nHe always asked that. He asked it because my father and his wife, Vivian, invited everyone in the building to the barbeque yesterday, to make a thing of my father\u2019s one-year sobriety chip. I brought coleslaw in a green bowl and smiled and smiled, the kind of smile you put on the counter and slice into pieces. I tried not to look at the backyard and the way the shadows seemed thicker than shade.\n\n\u201cIt was fine,\u201d I said. \u201cThe ribs were a hit.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood. Good. Tell your dad he tells the best jokes and that none of us believe half his stories, but that\u2019s half his charm.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the charm is the other half.\u201d It was a joke from the night before and he laughed like he recognized the echo.\n\nHe left. Tasha printed my schedule and held it in her hands like she would give me the keys to a car, her nails a fresh raspberry color. \u201cYou\u2019ve got an eleven with Teague Caldwell about the signage business, a Zoom at one, then you were going to go over to your dad\u2019s for a minute, if I remember, because\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause I said I would fix the lawnmower,\u201d I finished. \u201cI lied. I can't fix the lawnmower.\u201d\n\n\u201cUse your \u2018I have sensitive wrists\u2019 excuse.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have that excuse.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou could. It fits you. Dainty wrists, strong opinions.\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t correct her. I took the schedule and pretended to look it over. On the corner she\u2019d drawn a little sailboat. She does that when she\u2019s thinking about leaving town, even if only in a picture. The boat had a crooked mast. The word GO was scribbled under it.\n\nThere isn\u2019t an ocean anywhere near Little Rock, not really, no matter how much the Arkansas River pretends. But I grew up with postcards of coastlines because my mother sent them from California when she remembered, which was every four months or eight or twenty. My father would tape them to the fridge. Your mother thinks of you, he would say, as if thinking were a thick coat you could wrap around me. The postcards had pelicans and fog and lines of tiny houses on cliffs like petits fours. The edges curled and caught pizza grease and the smell of winter potatoes. I touched the glossy sand and thought my fingers might taste like salt.\n\nI didn\u2019t meet Mara until we were both twenty-two. She arrived in our house as if the house had been waiting for her, like her footsteps always belonged there. My father called me from his office one afternoon. He said, \u201cI have something surprising but good, I think good. I want you to meet someone.\u201d\n\n\u201cLike a dog?\"\n\nHe laughed, caught, then quiet, like he wanted to be brave. \u201cLike a person.\u201d\n\nIt was a restaurant with black napkins and the kind of light that wanted you to be lonely but not alone. He had Vivian beside him, small, fingers wrapped in rings like vines. Vivian\u2019s daughter sat across from them, looking like she had been put in that chair by a pair of careful hands. Mara Ellison. That is where the name belonged, in a sentence like that, as if the book had finally turned the page to reveal the name italicized. She had a cardigan with two missing buttons and a small scar on her chin that made her face somehow true.\n\nMara looked at me, then at the bread plate, then back at me, as if calibrating. \u201cMy mother talks very fast,\u201d she said by way of hello, and I laughed, and the two of us fell into talking like people who have already survived something together. We had not. But that energy was in the room, like an aftertaste.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m an x-ray tech,\u201d she said, tearing her bread in a way that made crumbs like snow. \u201cI like looking at the ghost-map of people.\u201d\n\nMy father coughed. \u201cYou like being able to see inside people,\" he corrected, like she had made a faux pas. She shrugged.\n\n\u201cNo, I said what I meant,\u201d Mara said, but then smiled at him like she was sorry for being herself. \u201cI grew up in Florida,\u201d she added. \u201cI\u2019m still getting used to not smelling salt in the morning. That sounds pretentious. Sorry.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt does, but I forgive you,\u201d I said. There was the river. There were the postcards. My childhood lived between water and the idea of water. \u201cWe have the river,\u201d I told her. \u201cWhen it\u2019s hot, and the air heavy, if you close your eyes on the Junction Bridge you can hear the ocean pretending.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not how pretending works,\u201d she said softly.\n\n\u201cMaybe it is.\u201d\n\nShe stared at me until it felt like the stare went through and through, like those films she developed. Later, when Vivian and my father had their heads close, telling each other a story without words, Mara and I leaned on the railing outside the restaurant. A delivery truck breathed out a moan down by the alley and teenagers clumped past like birds. The sky had gone that gummy mauve it gets in August, the air thought it was syrup.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad we\u2019re the same age,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cMe too,\u201d I said. I meant: me too, that makes this all less strange. I meant: we could have been anything. I didn\u2019t mean the thing I would mean later.\n\nWe became family quickly, which is to say we tripped into each other's patterns and then pretended to have meant to do it. On Sundays, Vivian made pancakes and put berries into little white bowls as if berries deserve to be handled like jewels. My father pretended he knew anything about cars and so did I. Mara corrected us and actually fixed the thing we were staring at. She had thick hair that smelled like applesauce or at least my memory told me it did. We went to the dog park even though we did not have a dog, to point at the dogs and say that one, not that one, that one. We took my father to a meeting in a church basement where a man named Beau with bright eyes hugged him and said \u201cKeep coming back\u201d like a spell. We came back, all of us, and then back again.\n\nIt is a way of saying that we were a family before my father and Vivian got the paper. It is a way of saying the paper changed the vocabulary and not the thing. While we signed documents at a courthouse that had too much echo, while Vivian cried and my father wiped at her nose with a cocktail napkin, Mara took a photo of the four of us and put it online with the caption new math. The likes stacked up, little blue thumbs in a parade. I sat on the steps and looked at it and felt weirdly tall and then small as a bird. Sometimes I felt like my palms were empty, even when they held my purse and the rubber stamp and my keys.\n\nAt work, the green numbers slid straight and I got raises that didn't feel like anything. At home, I watched Mara carry a plant from room to room looking for the light like she was practicing something. When she got a job at the hospital three exits down, she brought her scrubs home and threw them in the corner and took her shoes off and tried to shake off all the bones she had looked at during the day. \u201cAnkle,\u201d she would say, rotating her hand like a compass. \u201cRadius. A snapped rib that looked like bent chalk. The art of what isn't heart failure. A boy who keeps tripping over his cat and swears it\u2019s the cat\u2019s fault.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a collector,\u201d I teased.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying not to bring them home,\u201d she said, and then leaned her head on my shoulder and I forgot for a moment how to breathe. She lifted it quick, as if she noticed something had shifted and was trying to correct for it, like holding a tray someone bumped.\n\nWe were careful. That is not the same thing as being blind. We each dated, badly, like we were running errands other people wanted us to run. I sat across from a man who sold copy machines and listened to his story about going to Cabo with his college buddies. I went home and told Mara and she put her fist under her chin and listened with wide eyes and said \u201cNo,\u201d when he texted later, as if she knew the inside of me like one of her films. She went to the riverfront with a woman who sold handmade jewelry and came back with green ears. \u201cI think they were painted,\u201d she said. \u201cIt makes me mad to think about lead.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverything turns out to be painted,\u201d I said, because sometimes I can\u2019t help myself and say a line that wants to sit like a stone in the room.\n\n\u201cMaybe you mean plated?\u201d she asked, smiling.\n\n\u201cMaybe I do.\u201d\n\nI wasn\u2019t sure what I meant. Peeled grapes in a dish. A word said enough without meaning gets soft, gets mushy, you can swallow it like a pill.\n\nIf this were a different story, one with an easy moral, I could say that the first time I realized I was in love was the day Mara cut her hair. She stood in the bathroom and looked at herself the way people look at maps when the road is closed. She took the scissors and made the first hard snip, and the sound went through me like the pluck of a string. Hair fell on her shoulders and clung to her shirt, an animal that didn't want to be evicted. She turned to me with a small, almost panicked laugh. \u201cOh, this was a bad idea.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s perfect,\u201d I said, too fast, and then saw that it actually was. She was herself without the extra. Something clean and sharp and tender.\n\n\u201cIf I look like a fourteen-year-old boy, you have to tell me,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t,\u201d I said. \u201cYou look like\u2014\u201d I stopped because anything I would say might be too thoroughly true and that would change the room. \u201cYou look like yourself,\u201d I said lamely, and she rolled her eyes and threw her hair into the trash in a soft, alive pile.\n\nThere were other days that could be candidates. The day at the flea market when she held up a cracked blue plate and made a grand speech about how the crack would let the light in. The night she stood at the sink and cried at the end of a podcast, and I stood with her, two women staring into a basin of water as if trying to read it. The afternoon we both came down with norovirus and took turns being brave and it turned out she was braver and it turned out I loved her for being braver and for letting me pretend. Love doesn\u2019t arrive like a marauder. It keeps house and rearranges the chairs.\n\nOf course, there were signs I should have been seeing, too, and I saw them but decided they were not signs. When our old cat\u2014hers from Florida and ours from the minute her mother left her in our foyer with a carrier and a box of her belongings\u2014decided to ignore me and then curl himself around the leg of the couch when I sat down, as if I were air. When my breath fogged the bathroom mirror less than her breath did, even though I leaned in and huffed. When Vivian asked me, in front of the fridge, whether I remembered the day I broke my wrist at the skating rink, and I said yes and told her about the spinning, the music, the smell of nachos, and then noticed how her face rearranged and how she said, gently, \u201cHoney, that was me. I told you that story last month.\u201d\n\nI laughed too loud. \u201cI\u2019m stealing your material,\u201d I said. \u201cI knew I heard it somewhere.\u201d\n\nThe night after my father fell off the wagon\u2014three days and then it just as suddenly was over; Beau's hug seemed to work like a hand on a thermostat\u2014we sat in the backyard in the dark, Mara and me, feet bare, grass like a damp towel. It had rained and everything smelled like the underside of the world. She said, \u201cI keep dreaming of a shore. Like wooden steps and algae. I can hear someone calling down the beach. It\u2019s not Florida. It\u2019s\u2014\"\n\n\u201cCold,\u201d I said without meaning to. \u201cThe wind comes in with teeth. The foam is brown. There\u2019s a pier with a shuttering board on the end. You always want to look over but you know you won\u2019t like what\u2019s there.\u201d\n\nShe stilled. \u201cHow did you know that?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don't know,\" I said, trying to laugh it off. \"Maybe I just know beaches. Maybe Tasha drew me a boat.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not funny,\u201d she said. She turned her head. Even in the dark, I felt the outline of her attention like a weight. \u201cIf you had been with me, you would know this isn\u2019t sunshine beach. It\u2019s\u2014\"\n\n\u201cSharp,\u201d I said. \u201cI know. Sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to mock.\u201d\n\nShe exhaled. \u201cYou don\u2019t. Not ever,\u201d she said, which turned out not to be true, if you count what came later as a kind of mockery, the universe\u2019s mean joke, the big bad trick. But in that moment we sat with our knees touching. She was warm, and I tried to feel the warmth like a proof of my own temperature.\n\nYou can survive for a long time by telling yourself you are simply dramatic. You can explain the flicker in the corner of your eye as screen fatigue and the way the hallway light buzzes when you walk under it as old wiring. You can say that the cashier not looking up when you hand her a bill is a symptom of modern life and not what it is: sometimes your hands don\u2019t feel like they exist even to you. For a long time I lived like this, between explanations, keeping a list in my head like grocery items. You need bread. You need milk. You need to believe in gravity.\n\nMara suggested a trip. \u201cA little one,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have four days in October when both of us can go.\u201d\n\nShe printed a map on the office printer when she stopped by to bring me a sandwich and stood in my doorway and held it up. \u201cNew Orleans?\u201d she offered, and then shrugged like she was trying on a dress. \u201cOr Gulf Shores. I know, I know, touristy. Or we could be fancy and go up the coast. We could just go to Lake Ouachita and pretend it\u2019s an ocean.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go to the ocean,\u201d I said too quick. My mouth outran me.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not a planner,\u201d she teased. \u201cI like this side of you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI look good on the coast,\u201d I said, doing my voice the way my mother had done, that self-mockery kept barely at the edge of fun. The truth is: I wanted something to end. Or to start. My life measured itself between ledgers, between other people\u2019s true stories. The ocean seemed like an honest thing. It doesn\u2019t pretend to hold.\n\nWe set the date. Vivian put three kinds of snacks in a basket and called it \u201cfor the road\u201d like we were leaving for the army. My father held my face in his hands and kissed my forehead and whispered \u201cDon\u2019t be too\u2026you,\u201d and then laughed and said, \u201cKidding. Be yourself. Always be yourself. Take care of my girls.\u201d It was a joke, but he meant it, and I watched how his expression moved like water when he looked from me to Mara and back, proud and afraid in the way of men who have learned how much they can lose.\n\nWe did all the regular road trip things. We bought Coca-Colas in glass bottles because it mattered to Mara that the bottles were glass. We sang to a playlist she had made that would probably embarrass a certain strain of person\u2014Abba next to a Portuguese fado she found online, old country next to something that sounded like it had been recorded in a closet in Queens. She told me about a patient who had, in the most patient way, explained to her the difference between cartilage and a donut. I told her about the time Mr. Boone had called me Deborah for six months and how I never corrected him because I wanted to see when the lie would run out of gas.\n\nAt a rest stop outside of Biloxi, Mara took a picture of the sky like a tourist and then of me like a spy. \u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d I said, laughing and holding my hand up and then lowering it because I wanted the picture to exist and also didn\u2019t. She showed me the photo. My mouth was half-open, like I had been about to catch a word, and my eyes were too big. The color was off, somehow, like the pictures of dead people in old houses. She clicked and clicked. In one of them, my arm looked faint, as if the sun had eaten it. \u201cThe exposure\u2019s weird,\u201d she said. \u201cMy phone\u2019s acting up.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt always acts up when you drive through low country,\u201d I told her. I would have told her anything. If she had said the moon was just a lamp held by a patient god, I would have asked if we needed to dust it.\n\nWe arrived at the coast just before sunset. It was that hour that makes storybooks feel brave, when the water isn\u2019t blue so much as a scraped metal color, scuffed and shining. The hotel was two blocks from the beach and the woman at the desk had a name tag that said SANDI with an i. She gave us two paper keys and a list of restaurants and a look like she\u2019d seen all kinds of couples and didn\u2019t commit any of them to paper. We threw our bags on the top of the bedspread like we had been taught not to and ran down to the shore.\n\nIt is foolish to say the sand looked like sugar, but it did, and my feet remembered something my brain did not. The ocean had its whole complicated body out in front of us, doing its math. Mara stood with her arms crossed against the wind and let out a laugh like she couldn\u2019t help it. \u201cThis is so stupidly good,\u201d she said. A little boy ran past with a kite that couldn\u2019t decide what it wanted to do. An old woman held her shoes in her hand like a bouquet. A couple took turns taking pictures of each other with the horizon like a dare.\n\n\u201cI want to swim,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cIn your jeans? The water\u2019s cold.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d I said, which is something I often say when it isn\u2019t. I rolled my pants up and went in to my calves and then to my knees, and something in me went still. The water wasn\u2019t cold enough to be a shocking cold. It was the kind of cold that made your bones ring. I walked out until my jeans were heavy and I thought of all the times, as a kid, I put my feet in the tub and pretended it was a shoreline and let my father teasingly complain about the water on the floor. I thought: you are the kind of woman who comes to the shore and doesn\u2019t know how to behave.\n\nMara held back because her mother\u2019s voice lived in her somewhere and said you catch a chill fast. She stood with her shoes looped on her fingers like a second pair of lungs and watched me. \u201cDeirdre,\u201d she said, like a warning, and also like a poem. The light made it hard to see her face. For a blink, the horizon bent. This happens sometimes when your eyes decide they will not be bossed.\n\nI didn\u2019t go far, but when the wave reached past my knees and pulled, for an instant it was like something under the surface had my ankles between two fingers. Stronger than I\u2019d expected. I sucked my breath and staggered and grabbed whatever was nearest. My hand went to air. There was an emptiness that had texture. I righted myself and laughed, because we laugh when we are scared and do not want to change the mood of a day. \u201cOkay,\u201d I said to the water. \u201cOkay, boss.\u201d\n\n\u201cCome back,\u201d Mara said. When I waded in fully again, my legs were without their handcuffs. She took my arm, not because I needed it, but to claim me, and the claim spelled itself all the way up to my shoulder.\n\nWe ate seafood at a place with paper on the tables and a waitress who wore a silver beluga tail on a chain. The fries were too thin. Mara dipped hers in three sauces, constructing the bite like it mattered. She told me about her mother\u2014about Vivian\u2019s early morning dances in the kitchen, about the times she woke up to find a note and ten dollars and the sense she had to be twice alive to account for all the places her mother went to be alive. I told Mara about the time my mother sent me a postcard and forgot to write my name, how I stared at the blank as if it might tell me something about fate.\n\n\u201cDo you think it was meant,\u201d she asked, \u201cthat we would be family?\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople say everything is meant to make their heartbreaks into lesson plans,\u201d I said, which was unkind. \u201cMaybe it was luck. Maybe it was an accident that we held onto.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou think too hard,\u201d she said. She aimed the tip of a fry at me and laughed. That sound was like a rope tossed, not a rope pulled.\n\nWe walked back to the hotel, both of us sand-dusted and tired in the best way, missing the details we\u2019d miss on purpose in the morning for the sake of a better story. In the small guest shop, I held up a seashell night light and said, \u201cFor Vivian,\u201d and she held up a T-shirt that said SALTY in block letters and flipped it to show the back said BUT SWEET, and we groaned like old people. She bought a little blue fish for the dashboard of her car, a creature with googly eyes, its little suction cup mouth ready.\n\nThat night, I slept in the second bed and stared up at the ceiling until I felt my heart would reduce itself to math. The hotel air conditioner swallowed and spit air. The curtain trembled. Mara lay in the other bed, her breath the soft shift of a tide. I thought about getting up and moving into her bed, about making the air a different shape with my body and how it would feel to put my knee against hers and fit into some shared city of sleep we had by now built with our walking and our laughter. I did not move. I lay there as long as I could. Dawn is always a humiliation, a proof of your inability to decide.\n\nIn the morning, we ran. Mara runs like an old film star, everything graceful and slightly faster than you\u2019d think. I run like a person running from a bee. We went up the boardwalk and down the firm sand near the water line and then cut back toward a jetty that shoved itself into the body of the sea like a crooked arm. A handful of fishermen, quiet, the kind of quiet that knows something. A man in a white cap nodded and spoke the way men at the ocean do, as if the ocean has made them kind. \u201cMorning.\u201d\n\n\u201cMorning,\u201d we said. My cheeks felt hot. The wind tried to put its hands in my pockets to see if I was telling the truth. We went out to the end of the jetty because people always go to the end. It is what you do with ends. The water here hit the rocks like it wanted to eat them. Mara said, \u201cCareful,\u201d and I said, \u201cI am,\u201d and the rock under my foot told a different story.\n\nI did not fall. That happened later, to her, and the whole world turned on it. But this morning, T minus some days, I slid and my hand went down to catch me, found nothing, found out that touch was not a reliable narrator. I righted myself with a jerk so sharp my neck popped.\n\n\u201cYou good?\u201d Mara asked, looking at me with that narrow way she had when she was weighing whether she should call a doctor.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m good,\u201d I said, too bright, and we turned back.\n\nIf I made a list of clues, it would read like a bad detective novel. The spoon that fell and no one heard. The way the woman at the front desk looked right over me when we asked for extra towels, and I told myself this is how front desk women are trained and then watched her eyes track across me like across a window. The man on the beach selling puka shells who put his tray in front of Mara and said \u201cMa\u2019am,\u201d as if the rest of the air was just the thing she was made out of. The photo Mara took of me on the steps of the pier, the one where my face looked double, like paper copied badly. She deleted it undeleted it deleted it again and said, quietly, \u201cI don\u2019t understand what setting is doing that,\u201d as if the setting were inside me and she was trying not to name it.\n\nWe left the ocean after two days when we had meant to stay four because of a call from the hospital that a freezer was down and Mara had a kind of duty that glowed in her and I loved that duty because it gave the day a shape. We were good at turning around, the two of us; we had practice. On the way back, traffic coagulated and then broke apart and we passed a billboard that said IF YOU DIED TODAY WHERE WOULD YOU GO in a font that looked like someone\u2019s hard breath. I said a smart thing about evangelical marketing and Mara did not answer. She put her hand on the back of my neck for a second and left it there as if to steady me, and we were both quiet.\n\nBeing from Little Rock is like being from any place, which is to say it has a bridge you think is ugly but sometimes looks like an altar in the right light. It has people who always wear shorts and people who always say \u201cbless\u201d and mean it and don\u2019t. It has a place that fries catfish in the back and a place with pizzas so good a part of your mind goes to Ohio for no reason. It has the river and the way the river means you might leave, even if you won\u2019t. We came home to all of this and I let it wrap around me like a routine. Mara went to the hospital and I went back to the office. Tasha asked if we saw dolphins and I lied and said yes, because she wanted me to have seen them. Mr. Boone stood in my door with his hands in his pockets and asked how the water was. \u201cWet,\u201d I said, and he nodded like I\u2019d offered a concept.\n\nThat weekend, our neighborhood had a block party on a street that spilled into ours. The kind with kids on scooters and a folding table greedy with beans and slaws and cans of beer sweating like they were embarrassed to be from a plant. Vivian wore new sandals that had too much strategy on the straps. My father told his good joke about accidentally eating a candle and saying it tasted like rose, and then he told it again to a different cluster. I drifted between the group by the grill and the group on the curb and the group under the pear tree like plankton in a gentle current. Mara was talking to a woman from the next block about knees. Her hands drew circles in the air. She looked up and saw me and smiled in a way that made a line from her to me that anyone could see, a clothesline, a thing with pegs.\n\n\u201cDeirdre,\u201d Vivian said beside me, and I turned because her voice was pitched wrong. \u201cHoney, I\u2026do you want anything? Are you all right? You look a little pale.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m always pale,\u201d I said. My mouth was dry. There\u2019s always an explanation. She touches my shoulder, it is cool.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s something,\u201d she began, then shook her head. She had that look she gets when she knows a recipe calls for a spice she doesn\u2019t have and she\u2019s trying to make her tongue remember its name. \u201cI forget what I meant to say.\u201d\n\nWe sat on the curb as the kids made galaxies with their chalk. Mara joined us. She put her chin on her knees and watched the oldest boy draw a whale. \u201cThat\u2019s not how whales look,\u201d she said to him, and he shrugged and said, \u201cIt\u2019s how mine do,\u201d and she conceded the point.\n\n\u201cI want to go to the ocean again,\u201d she said, softly, to me. \u201cSoon. Before the cold does whatever it does to people.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe just went,\u201d I said, equally soft, because I had a slight stupid fear that if we said it too loudly, someone would hear, and what they would hear is not the word ocean but something else. \u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d I added, because fear be damned, and her hand slid near mine on the pavement and didn\u2019t touch. She drew her finger in the dust and made a shape that could have been a fish. Or an ear. Or a wish.\n\nLater that night, after the folding tables had returned to garages and the paper lanterns had been persuaded back into their flat selves, after my father had put his coin on the windowsill like a talisman and sent me a text that said simply good night, I lay in bed and listened to the house talk. Houses do, when you let them. The ice maker coughed its little stones. The hallway learned about shadows. I thought of the ocean like you think of someone who has touched your hair and then gone into another room.\n\nWhen sleep came, finally, it was not the kind where you float. It had mass. I dreamed I was on a pier that had no visible boards. I dreamed I could hear Mara calling\u2014not for me but my name, hard, like a knuckle on a door. The water did a dangerous thing. And then I woke with my throat closed and my hands reaching for a railing that was not there. The light on my phone said four-oh-two. A word sat at the top of my mouth. I swallowed it before it could name me.\n\nMorning, and the light that comes through our kitchen window made our cheap tile look like an expensive idea. Mara had beat me to the coffeepot and was reading the news on her phone with the grimness of a person who wants to know what mess she\u2019s walking into. She pushed a mug toward me across the counter. I wrapped my hands around it. Sometimes the only thing that proves you exist is the shape your hands make around the everyday.\n\n\u201cDo you ever feel like you\u2019ve already done this? I don\u2019t mean just d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu,\u201d she said without looking up. \u201cI mean like you\u2019re repeating a phrase until it stops meaning anything. Coffee, coffee, coffee.\u201d\n\n\u201cI always feel like that,\" I said. \"Doesn't everybody?\"\n\n\u201cEveryone doesn\u2019t say it like it\u2019s consolation,\u201d she answered, trying to grin, but her eyes wobbled in their set like light on the bottom of a pool. She stared at me then, and it was a look that pulled me as a tide pulls a small boat that has no anchor. She said my name, very gently. \u201cDeirdre. I\u2026\u201d\n\nHer phone rang. The hospital. A voice she obeyed without liking to. She put the mug down in a way that made no sound. She said okay twice and then okay again and then hung up. \u201cStorm coming,\u201d she said. \u201cThey want me to come in early in case power goes out and they need to move the portable units. I might need to stay overnight.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll drop you,\u201d I said. I already had my keys. I already had my shoes. Sometimes your body does what you think.\n\nShe put her palm against my jaw just for a second as if to say yes, we are in the same room. \u201cYou can\u2019t,\u201d she said, half laughing. \u201cYour eleven, remember? Teague Caldwell? Signs? The man who says Friendly like he\u2019s saying the opposite?\u201d\n\n\u201cI'll reschedule,\u201d I said. After a pause, I said, \u201cNo, I won\u2019t,\u201d because I knew the shape of my day, because I thought there would be time to do all the things later, including the ones we were not naming.\n\nThe rain came in sideways. Little Rock does rain like this sometimes, a temper tantrum, and then the sun as if to say, I didn't mean it. By noon, it was a proper storm. Lights flickered. Tasha wrote me in all caps from her desk: IF YOU DIE CAN I HAVE YOUR COOL STAPLER. I wrote back: YES BUT YOU HAVE TO CARRY IT EVRYWHERE TO HONOR ME. She wrote: I WILL STAPLE THE SKY and sent a cat gif. Mr. Boone said we would close early as soon as the land made its decision. I thought about Mara in her basement rooms, the hum of the machines they moved so carefully. I thought about my father sitting on his couch and letting the news tell him what he already knew. I thought about Vivian knitting a complicated thing out of blue.\n\nI went to the window and laid my hand against the glass because sometimes the touch of the outside makes the inside true. My hand did not leave a print. The thought arrived\u2014simple, like a bead.\n\nI turned away quickly, because the difference between a bead and a noose is what you string with it.\n\nAt three, the storm took the light for a minute. Someone down the hall said, \u201cThere it goes,\u201d like talking to a child that had gotten close to a hot stove, and then it came back. My computer rebooted itself and decided I was not me and refused my password twice and then relented like a mother bargaining with a baby. The quiet that follows an almost-outage is different, as if a bigger quiet had rolled through the one you keep at your desk. I got my bag and my raincoat and told Tasha to go home. She saluted me with a ruler. Mr. Boone had already vanished, which is his gift.\n\nThe road from the office to the hospital is only a few turns. It took me twice as long because the streets had become a different set of rules. The water did that thing where it tries to decide whether to swallow or let go. I drove carefully, not because I was patient but because care was all I had left. When I pulled into the section of the garage that Mara had told me to use, a big foam mattress leaned against one wall, a thing that had a job I couldn\u2019t imagine. I ran. The automatic doors opened like a mouth and I stepped in and past the sanitizer a volunteer held like a chalice and down to the basement.\n\n\u201cMa\u2019am,\u201d the man at the desk said as I passed, \u201cvisiting hours are\u2014\u201d and then he looked at me and his mouth smoothed out, the way faces do when they decide they haven't seen you. He turned to his computer screen like it had just asked him a question. I could have laughed. I could have cried. I kept walking.\n\nIn the basement, the air smells like wet metal and long plans. I went by the vending machines, the same ones that had broken our hearts at two in the morning that time Vivian\u2019s sister had her gallbladder out and nobody wanted chips. I saw a group of people in blue gowns move a machine that looked like a stalagmite. I did not see Mara. I did not expect to. It is a big building. I turned, the way you do when you are trying not to be lost. A woman in scrubs said, \u201cCan I help you find something?\u201d and I said, \u201cSome one,\u201d and she said, \u201cOh. Who?\u201d and I said the name of my step-sister.\n\nThe woman repeated Mara\u2019s name, once, like it was a test, and then again, like a whisper. \u201cShe\u2019s in East,\u201d she said, gesturing with her thumb in a direction that could be any direction. \u201cShe lives there on weekends. The wind is worse on that side. Seems to cheer her.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d I said, because gratitude is a path you can lay down in front of you when there is only fluid and no floor.\n\nMara was where she had promised the world she would be, steady and moving, making easy light jokes as she helped someone\u2019s mother find the bathroom. She saw me and her face\u2014yes\u2014her face changed, but not the way a person\u2019s face might change if they saw a ghost. It was the change you make for a friend showing up in the rain when you didn\u2019t ask them to. \u201cYou,\u201d she said, like a gentle accusation.\n\n\u201cMe,\u201d I said.\n\nShe wiped her hands on her scrub pants even though they were clean. \u201cIf you\u2019re here to tell me to go home when they let me go, to sleep, I promise I will. If you\u2019re here to say you\u2019ll hold my place in line for bread if everyone panics, I will text you when the line forms. If you\u2019re here to lurk like a bad omen, to look at me with those big eyes, to\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI wanted to see you,\u201d I said, cutting her off because her words were pinning me like insects to cork. \u201cI wanted to make sure you\u2019re okay.\u201d\n\nShe moved in, a fraction, as if that were a thing her body had learned as a trick. It felt like there were other ocean days behind us already, all of them stacked in a neat pile we would call memory. \u201cI am, so far,\u201d she said.\n\nI reached toward her, for a hand, for a shoulder. I did not touch anything. Either my fingers failed me or the air refused. She flinched anyway, and then frowned, as if she\u2019d been struck by an idea she didn\u2019t like and wanted to hand it back to the universe.\n\n\u201cGo home,\u201d she said, but not unkindly. \u201cMake sure Vivian\u2019s got a candle and your dad\u2019s not using this as an excuse to make Irish coffee. Tell Tasha to take her stapler if she hasn\u2019t already left. Call me when you park. Wait\u2014no\u2014text; they yell when I talk on the floor.\u201d\n\nI wanted to say something else. I wanted to say the word that had sat in my mouth at four-oh-two. I wanted to say I love you in the voice you reserve for the last minute and the first. I put my mouth around the word. The lights blinked again. Someone down the hall made a mess of equipment. Mara looked past me, automatically, as you do, as she had to. It is one of the marks of her goodness that she looks away from her own story when someone calls for help. I let the word go back where it had hidden.\n\nOn the way out, a man in the elevator looked at me like I had borrowed his coat and not offered to return it. I said sorry. He pressed his lips together like closure. The storm had moved on; it always moves. The city shone the way it does after rain, as though every surface has been rehearsing for this role.\n\nMy phone shook in my hand when I was almost home. Tasha\u2019s name. I pulled over. She had sent a photo of my desk chair with a note: I SPUN IT TWICE FOR YOU. COME BACK TOMORROW. She added four hearts and a sailboat.\n\nI texted back a picture of the road with the wipers mid-stroke and said: the water is a comedian, and she sent back: that joke was bad.\n\nAt home, Vivian had candles anyway, three, even though the lights held. My father watched the weather and made commentary as if his opinions could move systems. He said whether he had eaten a candle again and I told him no one believes him, and he looked pleased, like he loved being known so well. We played a game with cards and Vivian cheated without meaning to and I cheated with great intention. I went to sleep and dreamed again of the shore. I heard my name. Once, just once, a voice said: Dierdre. They spelled me wrong. It broke me in a weird fleshy place. In the morning, I found a grain of sand under my tongue, and I laughed because there is only so much you can do with coincidence.\n\nWhat I am trying to do is tell it whole. How we were before the real beginning. How we walked toward the same bad and good. How I stood at the edge of the river in Little Rock and watched it pull and release and told myself that it was just water, just water, as if I didn\u2019t already know that what is just a thing can also be the whole of it, the main act. How my body had, already, started telling me the punchline before the joke had been set up. How I looked at Mara and saw not only her face but the place beyond it where my own breath made shapes and disappeared. How I insisted on believing that you could go to the sea and not come back different.\n\nLater, when we stood on a different shoreline and the sky took a mouthful of her and I ran out and I couldn\u2019t catch what the world had peeled off the world, later, when I would try to hold a towel or a life preserver or a hand and find myself holding the idea of holding, I would look back on these days and want to smash the small domestic idols of our routine. The mugs, the pens, the night light shaped like a shell. I would think of the spreadsheet on my computer and how the boxes waited with so much patience and how betrayed they would be if they could feel anything. I would think of how the man at the garage had looked through me like I was a window and how the child\u2019s chalk did not dust the side of my hand when I dragged it across the whale. I would think of Vivian\u2019s almost-story. Of my father\u2019s almost-courage. Of my own almost-mouth.\n\nBut that comes after. For now, I am not a bad detective with a messy corkboard; I am simply a woman in Arkansas who keeps a neat one-bedroom, who pays the water bill on time, who knows the way to Gulf Shores and back, who has learned the names of her neighbors\u2019 dogs, who knows the weight of her father\u2019s coin in her palm, who writes in a ledger a line each day that says, in its own neat columns, I was here. I was here. I was here. Even if the ink doesn't know me, even if the page is only pretending to listen. Even if, when I turn to look for my reflection, there is nothing but the window, which is a way to say the world, which is a way to say: not yet. Not yet. Not yet.",

I went early to Freda\u2019s bakery because I thought maybe sugar could teach me its language again if I spoke to it at the source. The window was fogged near her elbows where she was leaning over the dough, and her scarf today was a citrus orange that made her look like a certain kind of bird that knows what to do with wind. When the bell rang and I stepped in, the cool air kissed my arms like a grandmother who had forgiven me for everything in advance. I held the thought that I could be a woman who buys a small paper bag and walks to work with a bun that she intends to eat in three bites and then discovers it takes seven. Freda\u2019s niece manned the register and asked, in that way some young people have that turns every question into a dare, \u201cWhat can I get for you?\u201d and I said, \u201cWhat you would give your favorite teacher if you needed her to grade you easy,\u201d and she laughed and handed me a raspberry thing with sugar jewels jeweled so hard they looked like polish.\n\nBack at my desk, when the ribbon of city traffic outside had turned into a sound with a shape I recognized, I took a bite. It was good in the way beauty can be good even if you can\u2019t name its parts, and then there was a hiccup in my head where flavor ought to open. I chewed and knew texture, knew seed and butter and the cold from the case, but there was nothing that would answer to the name sweet. I reached for my coffee to see if it could prune back the blank and sipped and thought of faucet water and then of nothing at all. Tasha came in on her minute with the mail and the purse bang and saw my face do a geometry and said, \u201cDon\u2019t like?\u201d and I told her, because honesty is sometimes a rebellion, \u201cI can\u2019t tell,\u201d and she put her hand on the desk near mine like she was pressing the paper from curling. She has a gift for standing next to trouble in a way that makes it look like company. \u201cMaybe you need salt,\u201d she said, and we laughed because we are citizens of this country where advice lives like air.\n\nTeague Caldwell did come at eleven and filled my doorway with opinions and fabric. He sells signs, which makes him sound like a man who would\u2019ve thrived in another century, holding up painted boards at a fair and shouting the futures they would give you if you let them. He wore a shirt the color of new pennies and showed me a set of mock-ups for a barbecue joint that wanted to look like it had been there forever. He did that thing where he put his finger halfway into the air as if the finger itself could draw a better line. He said Friendly twice as if it were a safety word and then apologized for saying it too much and I forgave him because there are words I use like salt too. He asked for water in a way that made me get up and I led him to the little machine near the credenza and pulled two paper cones and filled them and handed one to him and he took it and then looked at the other and then at me as if there were a third person standing between us who\u2019d gotten the second cup. He drank his water and I drank mine and he wiped his moustache even though it did not need wiping. I returned to my chair and felt it receive me with the relief of a dog who has been left too long and feared it was abandonment, and I smiled at that thought because it made the furniture love me.\n\nAfter he left, Tasha leaned in and whispered the gossip she had saved as if she were sliding a pastry across to me under the register. \u201cGuess who called me \u2018Sasha\u2019 and then wrote \u2018Deidra\u2019 on the message,\u201d she said, and I sighed and said, \u201cDoes it rhyme with Bone?\u201d and she nodded and rolled her eyes so hard they made a smiley shape in her head. The door to the hall made that breathing sound it makes when the air system decides to remember itself. The sign outside the window buzzed and then quieted and then buzzed again like it was thinking about making a point and then realized the point required more energy than it had stored.\n\nMy father texted at two the way he does, like a clock he thinks he has trained. He uses punctuation for sincerity. Meeting at six if you want, sweetheart. I read it twice and felt the rubber-band pull of obligation and also love, which in our house sometimes share a drawer. I told him yes, I would go, and he wrote back a heart and then the word \u201cproud\u201d and then the word \u201cchip\u201d and then said sorry for saying chip too much and I told him there are worse words to say too much and he wrote back \u201cwhiskey\u201d and then sent six laughing faces as if he was afraid he had done a wrong. I told Tasha I had to leave a little early to make a church basement look like a safe place, and she drew me a boat on a sticky note and made the mast straight this time.\n\nThe church stood on a corner that collects leaves as though it wanted to tuck them in for later. We had been before. We knew the chairs and which ones wobbled and which smell of coffee has the least ambition. Beau was there with his eyes and his smile that might once have been a different man\u2019s weapon and now belonged to everyone. He hugged my father like you hug a cliff after the storm and did that man thing with the backs of hands and the word \u201cbuddy,\u201d and then hugged me too, which I accepted, even though sometimes my skin doesn\u2019t know what to do with love when it arrives wearing a body. We sat in chairs that make your back know itself. Vivian came late because she had been making a soup for the neighbor down the street who just birthed a human and was trying to feed everyone in the city to seduce sleep. The meeting began the way they begin, with ritual and then the part where people say their names and then the part where they tell the truth like it is a cat that will leave if you try to pet it too fast.\n\nI had never spoken in that room because it felt like trespassing onto a map that wasn\u2019t mine. Tonight I raised my hand and let my father\u2019s eyebrows do a dance and said my name and did not add the words those people say because they belong to their war. I said, \u201cSometimes I don\u2019t know how to come back, and I haven\u2019t even been anywhere,\u201d and there was a small sound around the edges of the room that might have been humor and might have been breath and I kept going because if you stop mid-bridge you live there now. \u201cI mean that there are days when I go to hand someone something and I fail them in a way that looks like dropping. I mean that I am trying to believe I am not magic in the bad sense, disappearing when I am needed and reappearing with nothing to show for the trip. I meet the people I love in a room and I think I did and then sometimes I worry I imagined it because nothing on the table knows my weight.\u201d A man in a blue shirt with a postal logo on his breast nodded like he had seen my route before, and Beau smiled without making it about himself, and my father reached toward my shoulder and then moved his hand to the top of the chair like he was checking it for splinters. Vivian breathed the way she breathes when she is trying to memorize the inside of each of us.\n\nAfter the meeting, in the parking lot lit by lights that always look like alien ships on the ground, my father said, \u201cI didn\u2019t know, honey,\u201d and then shook his head at the hubris of that sentence and rephrased, \u201cI didn\u2019t know the shape of it. Thank you for telling me the shape.\u201d He put a hand in his pocket and found his coin and then decided not to take it out and then took it out anyway and pressed it into my palm and said, \u201cYou hold it for me tonight. I can see it at your place tomorrow. It isn\u2019t a test. It\u2019s\u2014we\u2019re a team,\u201d and I told him that a chip is a token and a token could be a key and yes, okay, I would put it on my windowsill and let the light touch it in his stead. Vivian kissed my temple and told me there was lemon in the soup and that this meant something about healing in some country and would I like a quart to take home, and I said yes because I am never too proud to accept soup.\n\nOn the way home, the air turned into a soft drum on the windshield again and the world smelted itself back into new. I took the bridge slow and looked at the river because I am superstitious and believe in water as if it owed me something just for having been my runway. The bridge lights made cardinal points on the black skin of it. A boy with no shirt ran along the far railing and I wanted to shout that he should go home and put on his mother\u2019s worry like a jacket, but my windows were closed and maybe it was hotter inside than out. When I parked, a stray dog\u2014gray with a white face like a saint\u2014stood near the curb and lifted his head as if to ask me a question I didn\u2019t know in the language for dog. He looked past me and then at me and then did that thing animals do when they smell who you are and how much you can offer and whether your hands are useful. He did not wag. He did not run. He blinked slow and then lay down with the patience of stone. I went inside with the coin warm in my hand and the soup armbreaking the bag and thought of how much the city knows and doesn\u2019t say.\n\nMara called late from the hospital to say she had eaten a packet of peanut butter with a spoon like a child and that if she died of boredom first I had to write a scathing letter to management about how humans should be fed actual food, and then she told me about the old man who had taught her the Spanish word for roof while they waited for his daughter to bring his regular glasses, and then she told me she had dreamed of the pier again during her fifteen minutes in the nap room and that in the dream I had been there and then I had not been and that she woke up furious at me and then laughed at how the brain refuses fairness. I told her about the coin and she said, softly, because she respects the way objects carry heat, \u201cPut it somewhere the morning can see it,\u201d and I said I had put it where the sun slips its first question into my apartment. We were both quiet then, the kind of quiet that holds a shape like the donut of absence she had mentioned once about cartilage, the hole that makes the pastry. After a minute she said, \u201cI thought of writing you a letter today, right in pen, in case the power went and we had to remember what hands are for,\u201d and I told her she should write me a letter and she said, \u201cMaybe I already did,\u201d and then a voice behind her said her name and she said, \u201cOkay, okay,\u201d to the air and hung up in a way that promised we were not finished, just paused.\n\nI began to keep a list at the back of my planner titled Experiments, not because I like science more than anyone else, but because calling something an experiment lets your fear sit outside for a minute like a neighbor smoking. In it I wrote: run water over hands and see if ring leaves line; press palm to mirror and count the seconds before fog; write name in lipstick on glass (wipe immediately); stand in sun and look for shadow with toe; ask Tasha to hand me something with eyes closed; eat a strawberry; light a match and blow it out. Some of these were too dramatic for my morning. Others were the kind of kitchen work women have always done in private, small tests to fold the world back into the right shape. I tried the strawberry and could not tell it from a tomato unless I watched the face of the person who had given it to me and borrowed their joy. I pressed my hand to the mirror and saw only the mirror waiting politely; later that week I did the same after a shower and the moisture made a print like a kiss and I cried because I wanted to shout I am here to the caulking. I asked Tasha to hand me the staple remover with my eyes closed and she did and before it reached my fingers I had to fight down the fear that it would keep going, that I would have to laugh like a woman who had fooled herself by setting a table for a guest who did not come.\n\nAt work, Mr. Boone\u2019s son finally did show himself by accident, not in the office but at the sandwich place two blocks away. He was standing near the pickles looking like he had been sent by a casting agent to audition for the role of Bar Owner Who Makes Poor Choices. He had the Boone hair, a little too patient before it loses its will, and the Boone mouth, a little too ready to be a smile if you gave it half a reason. He was arguing lightly with a woman about the merits of mustard and then he saw me and turned off his voice like a radio and said, \u201cYou work with my dad,\u201d as if this had been one of the facts he kept about himself to deploy at moments of emergency. I said I did and he made a motion like he meant to shake my hand but then shoved both of his into his pockets as if the hands had just remembered something. We made a small conversation because I am a person who can make a conversation the way some people can make an omelet. When I returned with my sandwich and told Tasha I had seen him she slapped the counter like she had lost a bet with herself. \u201cAn apparition,\u201d she said, and then added, \u201cDo not let him think we are as tidy as we are. It scares men like that.\u201d\n\nThe following Sunday, Vivian held her soup night and invited neighbors who had never been inside our house to come in and make our living room look like a magazine about furniture that likes people in it. She made three pots because she believes in options as a moral principle and wrote their names on tape in her neat parochial school script: LENTIL WITH LEMON, CHICKEN RICE, MINESTRONE. My father wore a sweater that made him look like his own father in the photographs where regret is a kind of lighting. Mara and I stood in the kitchen shoulder to shoulder like line cooks and tried to finish each bowl with a flourish to convince people they were being celebrated. \u201cParsley,\u201d she said, pinching it like a spell. \u201cSalt,\u201d I said, tipping the shaker like a wand. A woman with a baby named Lux asked if we were sisters and then gave me a look that said she had meant something else, and I told her the truth we had agreed upon, which is that love makes families and paperwork makes them legal and our two households have had both, and she smiled like that line was the right door to press.\n\nAfter the guests left in a drizzle of thank-yous and the sound of spoon in bowl had transferred to a memory of itself, we did the dishes with the tired happiness of able people. Mara washed and I dried and Vivian flanked us with a towel brigade and my father cut the leftover bread in slices as if he had not been told he was the person in the room least qualified for knives. There was a song on the radio about a man who drives away and the woman who invents a reason to be mad at him to make the leaving easier, and Vivian turned it up while saying the youth of today think they invented yearning. Mara kept handing me wet heavy things and I had the sense again of being a person waiting for a ball that might pass through her hands. Once, without meaning to, I put my towel hand right through the gap between bowl and air and bent at the waist so fast I knocked my hip on the dishwasher. \u201cOw,\u201d I said, not because it hurt but because the body requires narrative. \u201cCareful,\u201d Mara said, and then she touched my hip where it had no business hurting and left her hand there for the count of three and I had to put my free hand on the counter to steady to keep from doing that stupid thing of leaning back into her to pretend the world were simply physics and not longing.\n\nLater, when Vivian had gone to bed with a book about a queen who did not apologize and my father had arranged his coins like a small country and kissed each of us like we were in a play about goodbye, Mara sat on the floor with her back against the couch and said, without preface as is her way when the thought is too true to dress, \u201cDo you think something is wrong with you,\u201d and it was a blessing that she did not say what because sometimes love is letting a person fill in the blank. I said, \u201cI think something is different and the world hasn\u2019t agreed to it yet,\u201d and she nodded like a scientist who has heard the data and knows it doesn\u2019t add but trusts the instinct that sent the search. She said, \u201cDo you want a doctor,\u201d and then made a face at the way she had said it as if doctors were a single creature in a case. \u201cNot a doctor doctor, I mean, I could ask someone. Not for a diagnosis and a word that makes you smaller. Just an eye. Or we could do nothing and decide it will right itself, because sometimes I have found and it kills me that this is as true as the other truth that doing nothing is, often, what saved me from turning a bruise into a story,\u201d and I loved her for knowing that medicine has a window for wisdom and for leaving the latch undone for me.\n\nI told her I had been keeping a list and that I could show it to her if she promised not to laugh at the part where I tried to taste a strawberry with my eyes closed and she said yes and then laughed anyway in the kind way that makes the laugh part of your courage. I fetched the planner and sat with her on the floor and let her read it and she didn\u2019t make a face except when she got to the mirror and then she closed it softly and put her hand, palm down, on the cover as though we were at church and I had sworn. She said, \u201cI think you found the interesting thing about ghosts,\u201d and then looked away like she had surprised herself with her own mouth. \u201cNot the spooky thing. The part where they go to the same rooms again and again because those rooms know them and that is maybe part of how they remain. I don\u2019t believe in them the way the movies do, with wet hems and malice, but I believe in the need that keeps them near. If I were a ghost I would live in a hospital sofa that sinks in the middle and not haunt anyone, exactly, just make sure everyone who sat there found their shoe,\u201d and I told her she would be a very good ghost and she said, \u201cDon\u2019t make me a ghost,\u201d and I said, \u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d even though I knew that was not a promise anyone can keep.\n\nAfter she left that night, I opened the window even though the heat begged me not to and sat at my little table and took out my ledger like it could be a net. The page was cream and made to be believed. I wrote the date and then, in the line I had started keeping for myself ever since I had noticed the spaces people leave for themselves are as important as the spaces they leave for others, I wrote, in my neatest numbers, I was here. The ink looked fine for a second and then gathered itself up into beads as if the paper had decided to be oil. I watched them wobble and then flatten and then wobble again like they had a soft mind. I pressed my thumb to the words and lifted it and there was no black on my skin. I blew on it as though it were a birthday trick. It dried eventually, obedient to the physics of office supplies, and I told myself that the humidity had gotten in, that the paper knew its climate better than I did, and then later I woke in the dark with the ledger in my mind like a person knocking on a door you forgot to lock.\n\nAt lunch on Monday, Tasha said she had been thinking of leaving in March, not leaving leaving, but leaving the office, and that she would drive as far as New Orleans or as far as she could afford to get gas and then she would sit in a cafe and write a letter to her mother in pencil because pencil makes even bad decisions look like drafts. She drew me a boat that took up the whole memo pad and put tiny faces in the windows and said, \u201cWill you miss me if I go?\u201d and I told her that missing is one of my primary languages and that yes, I would miss her in a way that would make me imagine her in every line at the post office and I would send her pictures of our blinking sign so she would remember the good and the silly. She said I could come with her and I said I was chained to spreadsheets by a gold chain and then she looked at me with that face she makes when she thinks I am making a joke to cushion a truth and said, \u201cTake a day. Take two. Take eight. They will not know how to miss you but you will teach them,\u201d and I said I would think about it in the way that means I would think about it like a rosary and probably say no because it was easier and I would be angry at myself for that ease and turn the anger toward something else, like the copier.\n\nA postcard arrived that afternoon from California like the sea had spit it out on the exact person\u2019s porch who would bring it to me. My mother had chosen a photograph of a beach that looks like a bruise, purple and yellow at once, and on the back she wrote, not Dear, but Deidre, and then crossed it out so thoroughly the paper thinned and wrote Dear D. and then wrote, \u201cYou would not believe these oranges,\u201d and then drew three stars and a line that said she had met a woman who made jewelry from old silver trays and made a face out of forgotten spoons and wasn\u2019t that as good a use for a life as any. There was more on the card about a man named Wally who read a poem once on the radio, and then a PS about how she had bought a postcard and then realized it had seagulls she didn\u2019t like the shape of and threw it away and how did I feel about the word cormorant and whether it was too serious to be a bird. The address was almost ours. The mailman had penciled the correction in the margin. I held it and thought of fog horns like fathers who always stayed and of the way she had crossed out my mistake and replaced it with an initial like she had kept the door to my name not shut but just a little shy.\n\nThat night, I dreamed again about the pier. In this one, there were five of us, not four, which puzzled me because I could not count who the fifth belonged to, and then I realized it was lux, not the baby but the word, and the word made a sound when it stepped on the wood, and then my name came, not mispronounced this time, but breathed like a towel warm from the dryer. I turned and saw no one and then saw myself the way sometimes a mirror is a window until your face arrives. I woke with my tongue tasting of metal and fear and sat up too fast and had to hold the edge of the mattress like a ledge. The room wore its quiet like a shawl. The clock on the stove in the other room made that soft tick when it decides to show off that it came from a house with a grandfather in it. My phone blinked in the dark and I thought, dumbly, that a blinking object deserves an answer, and I reached for it and found that for a second there was an inch between reaching and finding, and that inch felt like a life you could live if you stepped into it.\n\nWhen the sun finally gave up and slid back into the building and turned my coin to a small person singing, I wrote to Mara without the courage of morning coffee and said, \u201cLet\u2019s go again,\u201d and then because I am a person who likes to give fate specific instructions, I added, \u201cNot the Gulf. Somewhere with a meaner coastline. Somewhere that makes you stand up straight.\u201d She wrote back in three tics because she is a quick study and said, \u201cNorth Carolina,\u201d and then wrote, \u201cNo, too complicated. Too many of my exes keep their secrets there,\u201d and then wrote, \u201cOregon,\u201d and then wrote, \u201cI\u2019m kidding. Too far unless we sell something,\u201d and then wrote, \u201cCape Cod before the season ends,\u201d and I typed back something about money and days and work and then I typed back nothing and then I wrote, \u201cPick the place you dream,\u201d and she wrote, \u201cOkay,\u201d and then nothing for longer than I knew she could keep a thought from tripping over its own feet, and then she wrote, \u201cI dreamed a stairway,\u201d and then, as if translating herself, \u201cJersey.\u201d\n\nWe are not the kind of people whose lives, when written down, look like maps worth bragging about, but there is a map in our heads of the way to Circle K and the way to the good park and the way to the hospital and the way to the interstate and now there would be a line from Arkansas to a shore the color of bottle glass and boardwalk pizza and men with tattoos that tell the weather. The idea of it felt at once tawdry and perfect, and I decided right then that I could be a person who goes to the wrong ocean in order to find her right one. We picked a weekend. We traded responsibilities like cards and made them sort themselves. Vivian clucked and then hid her smile in my hair. My father held his coin and counted aloud and said he would be fine if we left him and that he could cook for himself and that we both knew that meant he would eat cereal and peas. Tasha drew me a boat that said NE on a little flag and tucked it into my bag when I wasn\u2019t looking and when I found it, later, it felt like permission folded small.\n\nIn the days before we left, I tried my experiments with more devotion as if I could get all my data in now so I\u2019d have something to bring to the ocean. The mirror made a print on a Tuesday and refused on a Thursday and I told myself the glass was moody. The strawberry tasted like summer for exactly one bite and then like the memory of summer for the rest, which is not a bad thing if you are a person who likes memory. The staple remover obliged my fingers like an old friend. A child at the copy machine said, \u201cHey,\u201d like I was a statue that had decided to speak. The cat\u2014our cat, really, because he followed us when Vivian moved and now lives in both houses like a joint custody agreement\u2014walked along the top of the couch and put his face in my hair and then took it out and sneezed and I took it as a blessing. I found the imprint of my palm in the dust on the top of my bookcase and wanted to put glass over it like a museum plaque. I went to the river and dropped a pebble and watched the circles make their solemn march outward and waited for the part of the ritual where you feel better and discovered that sometimes circles are just circles and that you have to do the feeling yourself. A man playing harmonica on the bank played the wrong song for the way the sky looked and I loved him for being wrong with such commitment.\n\nThe night before we left, Mara came over with a plastic bag that held a travel toothbrush, a tiny bottle of lotion that promised gold, and a tin of mints shaped like anchors. She put them on my counter and announced, \u201cWe will not buy any of this on the road and then we will discover we cannot do the thing we came to do for lack of a mint,\u201d and then she saw how my face lifted into some kind of happiness and she took a breath and let it out like a person who has been given something you cannot wrap. She said, \u201cI spoke to a doctor,\u201d and when I made a face, she said, \u201cNot your doctor. Not a doctor like that. Doctor Annabeth, who takes lunches at odd times and knows too much about X-rays and not the lay of the land of our specific bodies and therefore cannot say anything for sure except that people are stranger than the charts allow and that the world we know is made of the parts we can push against and the parts we cannot and that if you feel like falling through sometimes it could be your brain being a liar and it could be the floor being honest and that neither option is a character flaw,\u201d and I stood very still because sometimes love speaks in paragraph and you have to hear all of it. I asked if Annabeth had told her to get me scanned like a suitcase and she said no, not yet, that she said to watch, to write down dates and times the way you are told to track a fever, to see if there was a pattern\u2014sleep, food, weather, sorrow, the river\u2019s mood. She handed me a little notebook with lemons on the cover that she had bought because she does not believe in making equipment so serious it scares the work away.\n\nWe lay on my bed on our stomachs like girls and looked at the map on my computer as if it were a joke telling itself well. I typed in directions from our place to a stretch of shore she remembered from her dream, which is not how dreams work, but if you make them behave like places sometimes they nod and comply. We decided we would go to the sort of motel that leaves a basket of coupons in the room and makes you feel like an aunt and an outlaw at once. We decided we would eat salt water taffy as if it were a sacrament and that we would not pretend we liked it if we did not. We decided we would walk out at dumb hours when the weather told us not to because we are people who do not like to be told. At some point we were both quiet for so long the phone screen went dark by itself and our two faces were in the black as if we were borrowing glass. I rolled onto my back and breathed and she clicked the phone back on not to check anything but so that the light would make it easier for us to keep speaking without naming the thing we were holding between us like a bowl.\n\nWhen she left, I followed her to the door and watched her to the curb because I am a person who thinks distance is a trick and that you can tame it by staring. She turned once and lifted her hand and then put it down and then lifted it again because she is a person who edits even gestures. Down the street, the men under the flyover played something that had words like rain and I thought of the day when the sky would remember us as a pair and not as women trying to be good and I shut the door softly because if you slam it the house remembers.\n\nI slept a lighter sleep, half full, the kind you do when you are about to move the scene. In the morning I would put the coin back in my father\u2019s hand and he would pretend to complain about how warm I had made it and he would then put it to his lips as if to taste whether I had seasoned it different and he would do his little dance of superstition. In the morning, I would put the lemon notebook in the glove box like a secret and we would pull onto the interstate and become people with a purpose that could be written on a postcard without shame. In the morning, I would softly touch the ledger and the line I had made, and I would look for myself like a child checks behind a curtain and then I would say, out loud because seeing counts, I was here and I am going, and I would leave the light on for the person I might be when I returned.",

                              "content": "In the morning the light came in a tired way that made everything look as if it had spent the night up worrying. I put the coin on the sill before I made coffee and watched its edge catch the pale. It made a flash like a fish turning. At the sink I reached for the mug with the blue rim and found myself having to look twice to be sure I had lifted it; the clink against the counter was the proof. I wrote the date and the words I was here in the ledger with the carefulness of a person addressing a stranger and waited to see if the ink would behave. It pooled a little, not enough to be superstitious about if you are not me, and then it settled like weather. I wanted to write I am going but did not, because leaving feels like a tender thing that grows best if you don't touch it too much at the beginning.\n\nWhen I drove to my father\u2019s, he was already at the door like a boy waiting for the bus. He had on the sweater from a photograph again and his hand played with his pocket where he keeps his worry. Vivian called out from the kitchen for me to take the bag of snacks or she would chase me to the road barefoot and we both laughed because we had both seen her do exactly that for less. I handed him the coin and he tucked his head, and for a second he held it to his lips as if there were something garlic about it he could smell. \u201cYou warm it better,\u201d he said, which is his way of telling me he is counting on me to have steadier hands than he thinks his are. Vivian kissed both of us like a woman packing fruit for a long journey and said, \u201cDon\u2019t be clever if the sign says don\u2019t,\u201d which is her way of telling me she remembers who I was at fifteen. On the doormat there was a damp leaf the exact shape of a tongue. The stray dog from the other night stood further down the sidewalk as if he had an appointment but was early. He looked at me in that seeing way that makes you feel both chosen and assessed and then he looked over me like rain looks over glass.\n\nMara pulled up in her car with the fish on the dashboard and thumped the horn once to say she was impatient in a playful way. She came inside to hug the people who have become her and accepted Vivian\u2019s curse against hunger disguised as almonds and a bag of small oranges. My father told her not to let the tollbooth men give her counterfeit bills and she told him she could identify bone shards on a film the size of a postcard so she could probably tell a fake twenty. He said, \u201cKeep an eye on her,\u201d and jerked his head at me, and she said, very solemn, \u201cAlways,\u201d and then made it into a joke by squinting one eye and holding her hand like a telescope. I slid the lemon notebook into the glove compartment and when I did I felt the car\u2019s insides welcome it like an organism does a friendly graft.\n\nThe road did not care about our errands. It stretched and narrowed where it pleased, and the cities we passed wore their names like emblems and like apologies. In Memphis, the bridge made its rude arch and we sang Abba in a part of our range that is not flattering. In Nashville, every other station was guitar and brag, and Mara put on the fado to rinse us and I pictured an old woman singing into a fishmonger's dawn. We stopped at a station with a mural of a buffalo on the cinder block wall and a woman behind the counter who had four rings in one ear and wrote the total on the back of a receipt because the machine was sulking. I handed over a bill and held it longer than necessary so I could be sure this was a transaction and not a rehearsal; she took it with two fingers and looked up just left of my face and said, \u201cYou friends need anything else?\u201d to the general space. Mara bought a bag of pretzels that promised lightning bolts of salt and a pack of those anchor mints and a magazine with a dog on the cover and a headline about ten ways to know you\u2019ve been loved. In the car she tucked the mints into the cup holder and gave me one like a crumb from a host and watched while I put it on my tongue. It tasted like the shape of mint and then it did not. I told her it was perfect anyway and she touched my wrist in apology for making me take a test when I had not agreed.\n\nWe stayed one night in a place off the interstate that called itself a lodge and had a deer painted on the door. The clerk had a name tag that said JOSE with a little flag sticker next to it and he was on the phone when we walked up and he held up a finger for wait and smiled at Mara and then at the desk as if it had asked him a question. I leaned on the counter because my body likes to push against belonging and the counter did not notice. When he hung up he handed us one key like a person dealing cards deliberately and said, \u201cBreakfast is from six to nine unless it isn\u2019t,\u201d which made me like him. Mara said, \u201cCould we have two?\u201d and he blinked as if recalculating and slid another across without quite making eye contact with me, like a newscaster reading serious words to the wrong camera. In the room the air smelled like rug and an old decision. The television said something about storms walking up the coast with their hands in their pockets. We lay on our separate beds and watched for a while and then turned the channels to a show about antique guns that had nothing to do with our world and then we shut it off and listened to the elevator in the hall take people up and put them down. I fell asleep with my shoe on like a dummy because sometimes my body sleeps as if it is sneaking in a nap it should not be having.\n\nMorning dew made the car look like we had parked in a cloud. We drove and drove and talked and did not, because there is a way to spend hours with a person and never feel you are wasting time even when you say nothing that will be printed in a book. The closer we got, the flatter things went and the more the sky felt like a permission slip someone forgot to sign. The first smell of salt made Mara roll down the window like a teenager and laugh like a woman. It was not the kind Florida breathes, which is like a fruit market in a church. It was rawer and more medicinal, like the air had been cut with something that clears. Boarded-up shuttered motels announced VACANCY with only three letters lit. The T-shirts in shop windows said crabbing is not a hobby it\u2019s a lifestyle and there were men in long shorts with old tattoos that looked like maps of rivers to no place. We crossed a drawbridge and pretend-fought about who was supposed to be steering the sky. When we pulled up to the motel with the name like a sailboat, a woman with a striped shirt and a lip the exact color of tomato paste slid our check-in form through a slot as if she were feeding the ocean a ration. She told us about pizza and she told us about saltwater taffy and she said the lifeguards were on a skeleton crew this late and that skeleton was on brand and then she looked at Mara and back at me like the ocean looks at two waves and knows they will pretend to be different.\n\nWe took the stairs even though the elevator had not offended us and when we reached the landing the wind pushed us back like a big aunt. The room had a bedspread with boats and a lamp shaped like a buoy and a basket of coupons that did indeed make me feel like I had been given permission to be quaint. We threw our bags and did that thing where two people in a room do a choreography that says I will take the left drawer and you will take the right and neither of us will say why that matters. On the balcony a woman in a sweatshirt that said WILDWOOD in a college font smoked as if to balance all that salt. The ocean threw its body at the shore over and over like a person trying to explain a point that has no words. Mara stood with her hands on the rail and said, \u201cIt\u2019s mean,\u201d and she smiled like that made her love it more.\n\nOn the boardwalk we ate the greasy good that was promised. The man behind the counter scraped the griddle like a violin and shouted numbers as if he was calling gamblers to their bets. We took a paper plate with a slice that incredulous New Yorkers would have judged for being broad and perfect, and we folded it and grease mapped my wrist and I tried to taste the basil and the acid and found that while I could identify their shapes with my mind, the sweetness of the tomatoes that everyone tells you to notice in stories was a blank hallway. We bought taffy because we are faithful to ritual, and the girl put it in a box with a picture of a couple from the 1950s who could have been anyone\u2019s mother and father and were pretending to be everyone\u2019s. We sat on a bench and put a piece in our mouths and laughed because taffy is an idea more than a flavor, and I thought: even if I could taste like I used to, this would still be what it is, an obligation you enjoy because it makes time move slower. Birds hovered with their gangster eyes and made plans to snatch from toddlers. A child in a stroller stared at me and then did not. Mara wiped my wrist with her thumb without thinking and then stopped and apologized as if she had stepped too close to a ledge, and I said, trying to make the truth smaller than it is, \u201cI like to be looked after,\u201d and she said, \u201cBy me,\u201d like a person checking the spelling of a difficult word.\n\nIn the afternoon, when the light went sideways and the families went in for naps and the boardwalk men put out their racks of hoodies like teeth, we walked to the stairs that go down to the beach. The stairs were wrong in the way that made them right. They had a bend on the third plank that made you put your foot down differently and a nail head that had risen to make a warning, and Mara put her hand on the railing and said, \u201cThis is it,\u201d not loudly, not with drama, like how someone says they have found the street they grew up on by smell. The wood had that gritty skin that only boards near salt get. The wind made the flags go hard at the lifeguard chairs and the red cloth was the exact color of a decision you regret in a good dress. On the sand there were the usual armies of umbrellas with their spines showing and a man sleeping in a posture that would have meant sadness in another place but here meant simply sun.\n\nI looked down at our hands, the way you do when you know that it's not appropriate to look at faces for too long, and I tried to see our shadows. Mara\u2019s hand cast a neat double on the board. Mine did a strange thing. It shivered, not with the wind but with hesitation, as if the light could not make up its mind whether to be caught. I stepped forward to make a deeper shape and there was a smear and then nothing, the plank just itself again. It made my stomach go light in the wrong way. I stepped back. The board, the rail, the nail head, all were confident without me. I wanted to laugh because it is a joke the world plays often: how we think we mark things and how often they are busy marking themselves. I had that petty thought that maybe the angle is wrong and blamed the hour like a scold. Mara had crouched to tie her shoe with the grace she has with all knots. When she stood, she brushed my shoulder in passing and the brush landed like a moth, there, then gone.\n\nWe took our towels down because that is what women do even when we know we will not sit still. The water had that look of panes stacked at a diagonal, clear and then dark then light again, thick. We did not intend to swim, because the flags and because the lifeguard with the whistle blew at a boy trying to be a hero and because Mara\u2019s mother lives in her like a lighthouse and flickers warnings at reasonable intervals. We rolled our pants and did the ridiculous ankle dance of stepping in and then out as if the ocean is a test you can fail on a minor scale and get partial credit. A wave reached up and touched me knee to knee and in that touch there was the smallest suggestion of thumb and forefinger again, a grip not cruel but instructive, and I had to plant both feet and tell my body it belonged. I scooped water and let it lick my palms; it had no taste. I put my tongue to the corner of my mouth to see if salt had chosen that place and found that the ocean could be sugar or snow and my mouth would not testify anymore.\n\nThe man with the whistle blew it for someone else. The women near us said their mother\u2019s names as admonitions. Mara pointed with her elbow at the end of the pier that chewed its teeth into the water, and she told me that in the dream the board had been loose right there and she had wanted to fix it with her two hands and then she had woken with her fingers curled and the half-moon marks on her palm like a little secret alphabet. I said, \u201cLet\u2019s go look,\u201d because looking is the human narcotic, and we went, not because we intended to climb it but because the angle from underneath shows you the structure of your fantasies. The barnacles were thick as an old truth. The pilings wore their skirts of weed like a fashion they did not ask for. A boy with a plastic net told us seriously that jellyfish had been seen near and to watch out for their invisible stings, and Mara thanked him gravely because she always thanks children as if they were diplomats.\n\nWe walked back to the towel and we sat just long enough to act like people who know how to idle. Then Mara stretched on her back and put her arm over her eyes and said, \u201cIf you were anyone else, I would tell you a thing,\" and I said, \u201cTell me a thing,\u201d and she said, \u201cIf I tell you, it changes it.\u201d I lay on my side and propped my head and watched the gulls do their petty crime. I thought about all the ways people confess love as if it were a crime, in whispers and with scans of the room; I thought of all the rooms where saying it had been the only clean act people could manage. I did not say the words that had sat in my mouth. I took out the lemon notebook and wrote down the time and the word downstairs and the words shadow hesitant and taste absent and then drew a picture of the pier like a child, which is to say the lines lied with love.\n\nThat night the motel hummed like a refrigerator even when the air conditioner had shut up. We ate at a place where the waitress said hon as if someone had handed her the word when she was ten and told her to keep it safe. The fried clams were a bruise, perfect in their rightness to the place, and I watched Mara savor each piece with an attention that made me feel religious. I drank a beer and it tasted like promises, which is to say more foam than substance, which is to say I liked it and then it left me. We went to the arcade and lost money on a game that required you to drive a car with a wheel that fought back like a bad memory. A girl in a sweatshirt offered to take our picture with the plastic shark's mouth around our shoulders and we said yes because when someone offers to domesticate a moment for you it feels unkind to refuse. She clicked twice. In the first, Mara looked like a woman who knows a joke about grief and I looked like I had been drawn in with pencil and then an eraser had passed over me gently. In the second there was a glare. The girl showed me and said, \u201cSometimes this phone hates inside light,\u201d and we told her not to worry and then after she left Mara deleted none of them and let them sit like stones.\n\nIn the room we watched the weather again, because it is in us, in both of us, to want to know where and how things will go wrong and whether other people might be suffering in a way that can make ours feel connected. The man on the television said something about a system off the shelf, and the map made colors in a smear that looked like a child\u2019s painting of a bruise and an angel. Mara brushed her teeth and then looked at herself in the mirror long and hard as if she were asking the person in there a question about courage. I turned off one lamp and then another and then turned one back on, because light\u2019s job is to argue you into staying. On our separate beds we lay and talked until our sentences had gaps between them like planks over water, and sometimes neither of us stepped anyway and the gaps closed by themselves. When she said good night, she said it like a person being careful with something that could roll; when I said it, it sounded like a coin, bright and too round.\n\nIn the morning the air had a temper. People walk differently on days when the sky has its own business. I put the ledger on the bed and made the small account of our ordinary, what we had spent in dollars and in whatever else you spend on travel and on wanting. I wrote, I was here and also, ridiculously, I am trying, and then closed it in a hurry as if someone might see me being earnest and mistake it for weakness. Mara came out of the shower with her hair wet and her face lit in a way that was not only the bathroom light. She said she had dreamed again and that in the dream it had not been the board that was loose but the hinge in her, the place where you decide to step. She laughed at herself and called it melodrama and rolled her eyes as if to puncture it and then she put her hand on the adapted place between my shoulder and my neck where people put hands when they mean it and what passed between us felt like the solid version of that word I had been keeping wet.\n\nWe walked to the beach with our towels and our small bottle of a day\u2019s courage. The flags stood their ground and the lifeguards had a look that says we will do what we can but the ocean doesn\u2019t sign contracts. The stairway from the dream made its turn and we respected it. The water was louder than the night before. Sometimes the sea gossips; today it argued. A man in a yellow shirt jogged by with a dog that looked like a mistake and both of them were happy. A father built a wall with his small son that the next wave took with bored efficiency and the child cried as if he had not expected the obvious. Mara\u2019s eyes were on the place where the water and the wood shake hands without respect. Her mouth made the line she gets when she is listening with the part of her that thinks in pictures. I stood next to her and could not tell if the nail head on the third board was higher or if I only wanted it to be. Sometimes you see signs because you need them more than you need facts.\n\nWe did the small cautionary things. We looked for ripples that suggest a current you cannot argue with. We decided to stand near the old woman with the visor because old women know. I rolled my pants again because I am a slow learner in matters of wet. A wave came in and made lace at our ankles and then another came in that was less lace and more sleeve. The sky had its mouth open so slightly that you could not call it anything but a breath. Mara said my name in that voice she uses when she is turning her head away from what she loves because she has to look toward work. \u201cDeirdre,\u201d she said, and it was a string thrown, and I looked at her and saw the tendons at her wrist like anchors, and then the wave that was not lace put its hand out and pulled.\n\nIt did not look like drama the way people tell it later when they want to be kind to themselves for not seeing it coming. It looked like an ordinary disobedience with ill manners. Her foot went from under, not because she is careless but because balance is a god with moods. She bent, the most human motion, not falling so much as adjusting. I reached. My hand did not meet her. It met the shape of her in air, and the air had its own good fidelity to itself. The towel at my shoulder slid and I took that stupid step, the one you take when you think the floor will move to meet you. The water came harder and made a rope around her knees and laughed in that heartless way the animate world has when it does not mean you. She shot me a look that was not panic, not yet; it was an equation\u2014me plus you plus water equals\u2014solve, solve, solve. I solved by holding my hands as if I knew how to make myself a hook. It is a special section of hell, discovering you cannot touch the person you have been trying not to love loudly. My fingers closed on nothing that the world would give me. It was like being asked to pick up fog and not offend it.\n\nPeople were shouting. The lifeguard made his whistle into a knife. The old woman with the visor stood like a saint in a painting and said nothing because what could she say that would be better than a rope. Mara set her feet down and for a second that I will live in forever she was steadied. She held her hand out because she is a person who thinks of the simplest miracle first, and I put mine under hers because I am a person who still thinks miracles listen. The press of palm to palm that I had imagined a hundred times in rooms and kitchens and offices and at other people\u2019s tables was a ghost\u2019s joke. It landed light as thought and slid. We both felt the slide. She made a face that I have no name for because our inventory of expressions does not have one for this. It said this cannot be and also I am not surprised. She tried again because she is stubborn. I tried again because I have only so many moves.\n\nThe water did what it had set out to do without remorse. It is very likely that if I had been another woman, a heavier one, a more present one, a woman whose hand leaves sugar on the tongues of cups, I would have made a difference, and it is very likely that if she had been any other woman, she would have made the same mistake and we call it devotion. The wave that took a mouthful of her was not even a show-off. It was the mean thorough one that comes after the drama, that goes about its business and collects what the prettier wave left behind. It folded her waist and took her knees and offended gravity on her behalf. She went under with a look back that was not for me exactly but I took it that way because one day there would be no one else to take it. The ocean did not want her, not any more than it wants a bottle cap. It wanted motion. It wanted to prove a point it couldn't stop proving. The lifeguard went in with his straight back and his red float and another one followed and the people on the beach made that sound that crowds make, the sound that says we are the world and we are useless.\n\nI stepped after, as if I had a right to participate in rescue, as if my body could negotiate with law. A man I did not know put his arm across me to stop me, the way you do in a car when the driver slams brakes and you play seat belt with your hand, and his arm felt like a bar even though I know very well it might not have been there. I moved around him because I am also stubborn and the water met me like a doorman who has been given very clear orders. It pushed. It pushed again. I understood that if I went further it would make a case against me. If I called her name it would not carry. I called it anyway. It sounded to me like when you knock on a hotel wall and there is a person next door you want to know you are there in case. The lifeguards made their angles. The one with the red float reached her shoulder and she came up and blew like a person who has been underwater for exactly long enough to tell a story later. The water receded to a moody line. It came back. It took more. It returned what it had to return. The world compressed itself to four bodies and a rope of foam.\n\nLater, when we were on our knees on the towel and she was coughing in that awful animal way that makes you want to buy air in bottles to give it to people, she laid her hand on my forearm without thinking and her hand went right through the place where mine ought to have been and landed on the grit of the towel. She felt around like you do in a dark room for the pull cord, and we both looked at where our skin should have been together, and the look did not belong to any language I had. We sat that way as the men shouted rules at the sea and a woman prayed too loud and the boy with the jellyfish net explained to his father exactly what had occurred. The lime green on the lifeguard\u2019s whistle looked shamefully cheerful. The sand under our knees felt like every grain was staring up and taking a note it would keep.\n\nWe tried to behave like the right kind of people. She let herself be examined on the sand by the men who have learned to kneel and say ma\u2019am while they check your pulse. She nodded and followed their instructions to breathe slow like a practice. I wrapped a towel around her because towels are what we have and because that is the act we have been given in every tragedy since blankets were invented. She took it and smiled as if to tell me I had not failed to perform kindness and that in itself is a kind of kindness. The lifeguard said words about rip current and eyes open and not above your waist and I said, against the part of me that likes sarcasm, thank you. The old woman in the visor patted my shoulder and missed it and patted the air and did not seem to notice. Somewhere someone put their cooler down hard and made a sound that made me jump.\n\nBack in the room, after the men had allowed us to leave because nothing was broken you could fix with a cast and because you have to let people go if they insist on going, Mara sat on the edge of the bed with the towel around her shoulders like a cape and the fish on the dashboard downstairs stared north. She coughed and then laughed and then cried all in the one breath, as if there had not been time to sort. She said, \u201cDo not say it,\u201d and I did not, and she said, \u201cSay it,\u201d and I did not. I crossed the room and stood in front of her and put my hands out and watched her put hers in mine and watched them again not catch. We both watched the not of it like a live thing between us. Her fingers closed on the air where mine had gone as if she were squeezing an invisible fruit and her mouth made a sound I had heard before in barns and kitchens and rooms with bad news; it is the sound made when the thing you already knew and would not say to yourself arrives with proof.\n\nWe stayed there too long for comfort, for sense, but sense was a door that had already shut. The tide kept shouting the same sentence outside in a language that doesn't accommodate apology. A siren far up the road did the ceremonial wail that communities insist upon as if it helps even when you cannot tell where to send your grief. Mara stood finally, because she is not a person who will be made into a patient without a fight. She peeled the towel off her shoulders as if she were taking her skin off and putting it back on, and she reached for me without eyes and found me not. She said my name the way you say a word when you are making sure it belongs to your mouth and then she said it again in the way you do when you are asking the room to answer. I made a decision to be the kind of person who says a true thing even if it makes the air colder. I said, \u201cI don\u2019t know how it\u2019s going to go. I think I might not be the same kind of real as I used to be.\u201d She nodded as if thanking me for putting a line on a map that already had roads.\n\nWe did the next simple things because the brain likes a list when the heart is roaring. We put her clothes in a pile by the radiator to tempt them to dry even though the radiator was cold. We wrung out salt from a shirt that had no reason to have so much in it. We took the lemon notebook from the glove box like a doctor fetching a file and wrote the time and the steps and what the water had said of us and how the towel had felt like a person when it was the only thing I could hold. We wrote in different hands and then read each other\u2019s entry aloud like a prayer. We did not write the word ghost and we did not write the phrase almost family and we did not write the thought that some stories are jealous and want a clean tragedy to show at the end, because we are suspicious of clean anything when it comes to pain.\n\nOutside, the storm the man on television had invited into our plans set its first foot down. The window glass went into itself with the sound of thin instruments. The people on the walk put their heads down and their shoulders forward because you can march through almost any weather if you pretend you are being paid. The sign at the motel office flickered VAC and then ANC and then nothing, and JOSE must have been thinking of his mother as he filled the lobby with the smell of coffee because buildings smell like the person in them who is trying. Mara stood at the window in the towel and watched the line of the sea like a person reading the heart monitor for someone she loves and cannot fix. Without thinking, because my body remembers what it has done even when it is losing its receipts, I stepped behind her and put my forehead between her shoulder blades and felt the heat of her that way without asking the air to broker. She did not startle. She reached back with one hand and let it hover where my hip would have been and left it there anyway. We stood like that for a long time, not moving, letting the weather do the noise for us, pretending that leaning is an action that can keep a person from being pulled.",

                              "content": "By morning the storm had lost its theater and kept only the mess, a sulk of sea that slapped the pilings without showing off. We packed in the way people do when they are pretending a trip has simply ended and not changed its contract, each of us folding shirts into the same domestic squares we learned from our mothers as if neatness could unsnag the line. At the desk, JOSE had traded his flag sticker for a pumpkin pin that bobbed when he breathed. He slid the folio toward us and said the words he knew how to mean, that he hoped we had enjoyed our stay, that the taffy really is better at the shop near the kite place if you care, that the storm had been kind compared to the one three years ago that took the ice machine\u2019s mind. Mara signed in the line with her careful print, and when I took the pen it was as though I had dipped it in water; the blue made a thin show and then receded into nothing, leaving the faintest gray suggestion of my name like a rumor. JOSE glanced down and then reflexively up, but his gaze did not catch my face; it slid to the left and landed on a stack of coasters advertising a beer the motel did not serve. He tapped the paper with his finger and said, \u201cYou\u2019re all set,\u201d to the air exactly where I had been standing and I thanked him too brightly and folded the receipt like something you tuck in your shoe for luck.\n\nOn the stairs the wind tried again to make us confess. It pushed against our knees and made the lemon notebook in the glove box press its spine against the plastic like it had a heartbeat. We drove with the radio quiet for a while and let the interstate say what it says to all travelers, that you may be anyone and leaving anywhere and that it will not ask your reason. At the first rest stop the automatic sink and I came to our understanding, which is to say it refused me outright and then, after I had moved my hands in front of its black glass eye like a woman trying to teach a bird a trick, it turned a thread of water on for half a second and shut it with a spasm of disdain. The paper towel machine watched me like a cat and did not purr. Mara stepped next and the sink gushed as if happy to recognize a regular; she dried her hands and looked at me with a kindness I did not want and at the sensor with a scolding I did. \u201cWe will out-stubborn you,\u201d she told the metal, and the woman at the mirror with lipstick like a vow laughed, because sometimes other women will laugh with you when you choose your enemy and it is safe.\n\nWe made a new column in the lemon notebook called Machines, because even I like to see where the story repeats. Under it I wrote sink no, door if someone else walks with me yes, elevator yes, card reader looks me in the eye and shakes its head, microwave yes, scanner no, and then I drew a picture of the stall door latch because it had held when I asked it to and that felt like grace. On the road again the sky kept its gray in a pocket, letting out its light in brief folds, and Mara drove with her jaw set like a person who has chosen a pace and will not be bullied by the clock. Somewhere outside of Wilmington we played the game where you name houses as if they were dogs, white one with a porch is Petunia, the one with the tire swing is Huck, the brick with the glass block is Marge who makes lemon squares and pretends not to notice the money in the tin, and a small blue house that tilted slightly toward the road and looked game for anything was named Halfway because every trip needs a point to which you could return if you changed your mind.\n\nIn the part of the drive where roads become muscle memory and your body can leave your head alone for an hour, Mara said she had been thinking about a string. She said sailors, the old ones, kept a line between them when they went to the bow in weather, and that she had seen a picture once of two men with their jackets dark with rain tied to a mast like children to a story, and that she had thought it foolish and brave in the same breath. She said she was thinking about tying something to me the way you tie a key to a child\u2019s belt loop on the first week of school. I told her I would wear any string she gave me and not for the metaphor but because my chest had begun to feel like a room without a doorknob. She reached into the bag of superstition between us and took out a scarf Vivian had shoved there because in every weather there is a draft, and she folded the scarf on her thigh with the care of a woman making a bed someone will be born in. At a long stoplight in a small town that had a barber pole and a thrift store that smelled like the afterlife of church, she looped the scarf around my wrist and then around hers and tied a double knot like a woman who has fixed a hundred pieces of machinery and knows which knot tells the truth. We sat for a minute in the ordinary binding of it and both of us watched our hands to see if they would obey. The light changed and a man in a dump truck eased past us with the patience of a person with nothing left to prove.\n\nBack in Little Rock, the river lay down with the tired look of an animal after a sermon. I dropped Mara at the hospital even though she had told me not to, and we both acted surprised when the scarf fell between us like an undone promise. She went in through the volunteer door and the gray-haired woman with the clipboard smiled at her and then right past me in the same motion, and I had the childish urge to stomp my foot because sometimes indignation is easier than grief. I walked back to the car with the scarf in my hand like a leash and sat with my forehead on the steering wheel for longer than I meant to, until a man in a security golf cart tapped his horn twice, politely, to ask me not to be a hazard, and his face did the thing faces do when they see something they can\u2019t set down, a flicker and then a smoothing, as if a hand had passed over the surface of him.\n\nVivian, when I came in, had her hands in dough and a radio on low telling her about the city in its best voice. She wiped her palms on her apron and came toward me with the body of a woman greeting her child and then she stopped, not because she had seen anything but because something in the air had made a slight change, like a key turned one element toward locked instead of open. She reached and then rubbed her forearms as if she had been cold and could not name why. I told her about the motel coffee and the sign and the sink and she blew hair out of her eyes the way a girl does, and she said she had a friend who had days like that after her daughter left for Montana and that the friend had started wearing perfume again just so something would remind the room to notice her. I told Vivian that if I wore a smell it would be probably soil or oranges and she nodded solemnly like choosing a scent was a contract with the self and said she had some oil from a woman at church who made everything smell like the inside of a good decision.\n\nMy father came home from his meeting with Beau with a new coin that he put next to the old one on the mantle like two brothers he was trying to force into friendship. He made a long story short, a skill he never remembers he has, and said a man had told a thing about losing the right to be the main character of your days and how he had learned to be grateful for it, and my father said he had almost stood up to argue and then had kept his seat and his mouth and that in itself was growth and a miracle both. He took my face in his hands, which is his chief indulgence, and then he paused and looked at his palms and laughed at himself for checking whether I had left something there like glitter, and he kissed my forehead anyway and told me that I was, in the words of Beau, in the middle of a story and that the middle is the puddle of it and the place you mistake for the end. I could have kissed Beau, saint of middle parts, right then and there for giving my father that sentence to hand me like a cup of water.\n\nAt work, the office had the dignity of a person who has been through a storm and put her hair back up. The blinking sign still stuttered but it was a friend\u2019s stutter. Tasha had indeed spun my chair and it had the faint smell of impulsive perfume, which I told her made it sit better. She kissed the air at me and then stopped, because her body is wise, and she said, \u201cPermission?\u201d and I said yes and we bumped shoulders like birds. She did not say the word ghost or any of its cousins because she is a woman who knows a word can call a thing to the table like a summons. She gave me a file labeled CALDWELL, SIGNAGE in her neat fifth-grade teacher letters and then whispered that Mr. Boone had asked about the ocean and she had told him it was wet and he had laughed like a good man. When he came to my door he put his hands in his pockets and looked at the floor first, a habit of his that I am fond of because it means he is about to try to be kinder than he knows how. He said he had decided he was going to start coming in on time just to see what would happen to the fabric of the world. I told him it would snag and then mend. He told me his son said hello, which I doubted, and that the school board woman with the neon shoes had called and said their auditor had cried in the supply room, which I respected, and then he asked if I wanted to take a Wednesday to not be here and I told him the truth, which is that I want to but wanting does not always move me.\n\nTeague, with his folds of fabric and his adjectives, came to show me the new mock-ups and stood in the doorway like a man posing for a portrait of a person who sells signs. He did not call me Deborah and I decided to count that as victory. He laid the papers on the desk like cards and tapped a corner and said he had taken my note about the barbecue place wanting to look like it knew how to forgive you for leaving and that he had tried a font that looked as if someone\u2019s uncle had a steady hand in 1978. When he lifted the top sheet the next one stuck as if by wet, and he said, \u201cHuh,\u201d and then smiled his salesman smile at the air as if it had considered buying. \u201cStatic,\u201d he said apologetically, and I nodded as if its name calmed me, and he reached to separate them and his fingers went perfectly through the margin my hand had made a moment earlier. He jerked back and made a joke about the paper being sharp and I let him have it, because sometimes everybody deserves a soft lie.\n\nBecause I am not brave but wish to be, I took a bus after work to the hospital to find Annabeth, who has a badge that says DOCTOR in the way you put a bell over a word to make it understood. She has hair like a hymn and a laugh with the bark still in it, and she looked at me the way people look at a painting they haven\u2019t learned to love yet and plan to, respectfully, with a little apology. She did not check my reflexes or ask me to count backward by sevens or draw a clock, though she told me what other people would ask and I thanked her in advance for skipping their script. She asked instead what the machines say yes to and what they deny, and she asked when it is worse and when the world sighs and lets me in, and I said, surprising myself, that it is worse when I am about to say a thing that would rearrange the furniture of a room and that it is better when I am giving someone change for a ten at a fundraiser and miscount by accident and everyone laughs. She nodded like I had offered her an interesting flavor. She said that some brains take you out of your body when there is a lion, and that some decide there is a lion when there is love, which is another kind of catastrophe, and that sometimes this is a trick you can learn to take apart with breath and a word and sometimes it is the world\u2019s trick and then your job is to carry it like a bowl. \u201cYou are not broken,\u201d she said like a person telling a child that their shoes will do fine. \u201cYou are not a magician, the bad kind. And even if you were, I have met a great many women who exist only slightly and you are not one of them. Where can you feel yourself the most?\u201d she asked, and I thought of the place where my head meets my neck and of the way sound catches under the sternum like a moth and I told her the truth, which is that my voice does not betray me.\n\nMara came at the end of the day in her scrub top and tired shoulders and brought me a small machine wrapped in a towel like a baby. \u201cIt\u2019s a thermal thing,\u201d she said with the glee of a person who knows a toy might save the world. \u201cWe use it for the engine room,\u201d she added, as if hospitals had those, and I put my hand up like a child in a schoolyard and she took the camera and aimed and showed me the bloom of my neck, the heat at my chest where my heart insists, the cool at my fingers that surprised her and did not me. She aimed at my palm and I watched the colors make their appeal and I felt like I was watching a weather map of a place I had visited and could not recollect the details of. \u201cYou see?\u201d she whispered, not because anyone was asleep but because we have both begun to whisper when we get too close to naming. \u201cYou are not nothing. You are noise. The good kind.\u201d She took a picture of the cat as he walked in like a mayor and he made a glorious flame. He paused by my leg and hesitated, which is his version of affection, and then rubbed his head against the couch instead and threw me a look as if to say that everyone is complicated and he has decided that is the only fun we get.\n\nWe tried the scarf experiment the next night in my apartment because I decided being foolish is better done at home. We tied it from wrist to wrist again and lay on the floor like girls reading magazines, only one of the magazines was the lemon notebook and the other was a back issue of a medical journal that had a picture of a spine like a sea creature. We pulled gently, left then right, and when I closed my eyes and let her move me I felt the tug like the smallest approval and something in me unclenched and I laughed and then cried in the same breath, which is my version of the body taking off a sweater. She kissed the inside of her own wrist where the knot lay like a charm and I pretended she had kissed mine and was pleased with the pretending because sometimes make-believe is the only way to cross a street. We fell asleep like that, wrists cinched, and woke to find the scarf coiled on the rug with the petulance of objects that have been asked to sustain something they were not designed for. The knot had slipped toward her and off me as if the night knew how to rearrange the narrative. She made a sound that was not disappointment and not anger. It was recognition.\n\nTasha, because she understands the value of loud, took me to a karaoke place on a Thursday and stood me in front of a microphone that smelled like every mouth it had ever met and said, \u201cSing badly,\u201d which is her version of a blessing. We picked a song about standing in a kitchen at midnight and we did not hit any notes that would hurt a dog and the men at the bar watched the game and not us and the woman with the baseball cap cried at a line we did not mean to underline. The machine did not doubt me. It turned my voice into paper and then into air and I could feel the way the sound bent around the room and came back to my ribs. I watched myself steam in the cheap light like rice and I wrote that down later in the lemon book because it felt like news, that you can be believed by your own mouth. When we came out into the dark a man with a trumpet on a bicycle rode by and let the instrument cough once as if to say this is an option, too, and I laughed like a person who has been chosen for a minor miracle and plans to tip well. Tasha twined her arm in mine, then pulled away deliberately and looked at my face to make sure she had not offended, and I told her silently with my shoulders that she had not and with my mouth that I am still practicing.\n\nDays began to sort themselves into categories that I refuse to make into a calendar because the minute you give something a name it asks to be called for supper every night. There were sink days and ledger days and days when numbers slid into their columns like swallows finding the right garage. There were mornings when the coin my father gave me warmed in my palm as if it were alive and days when I could not get it to change temperature at all and I told myself the apartment was simply a colder place than it felt. There were afternoons when the cat took pity and sat near me and arranged his small thunder on my shin and I wept because animals are economists and do not give what does not have use. There were evenings when Mara fell asleep in my lap and then startled when her head met the arrangement of cushions I had made to keep it from dropping to the floor, and her apology for waking was also an apology for the condition neither of us had asked for and she performed it with grace and the joke she has for sorrow: that it is neighborly to both of us and therefore should be brought mac and cheese.\n\nThe ledger misbehaved one night and then obeyed the next and I decided that paper is moodier than we allow. I bought a pencil because I wanted to make the world argue less and its lead did what lead does, wore itself down with service. I pressed the letters of I was here with more force than is required for such small words and when I finished the indentation showed on the next page, an embossing of evidence. I liked the idea that the future had already been bruised by my insistence, and I told that to the ceiling because sometimes you have to accuse your roof of complicity. The mirror in the bathroom fogged only at the edges when I breathed and sometimes not at all and I learned to take comfort in the shower because the steam did not lie; it rushed and coated and made me part of weather, and if that is all I am allowed then I can be good weather.\n\nWe went to my father\u2019s together on a Sunday when his poker men came by to pretend to care about cards and to care very much about pretzels. They dealt as if they were inventing the deck and told stories that sounded like each other because that is how men keep safe in groups. My father told none of his candle story out of respect for the fresh faces and laughed at the right places with his mouth and not his hands. Vivian handed out bowls as if she were crowning each man with the right to keep living and their eyes softened as spoons met soup. Mara sat on the floor between my father\u2019s chair and the coffee table and in the middle of someone\u2019s long-ago baseball she put her hand out and I, idiot, put mine in it and we both watched as our longtime trick disappointed us. She did not pull back. She kept her hand there, in the space where mine had meant to be, and she closed her fingers and she breathed and I did the same and to anyone watching we looked like ordinary women making a small ordinary pact. My father\u2019s eyes found us because the animal in him keeps us both and he smiled in that wide way like a prayer answered he cannot repeat aloud because it would get hurt by being said, and then he looked away deliberately in the way of people who understand that privacy sometimes is the only way to keep a thing alive.\n\nNight came like a slow good songwriter and the city pressed itself into its familiar shapes. I dreamed I was under the pier and that I could see up through the boards to the shoes of people who thought they were alone and I reached for their laces not to trip them but to tell them I was there. I woke with salt on my lips that was not taste but the memory of it and found the scarf coiled again near my wrist because I had tied it in my sleep without knowing and that felt like hope disguised as clumsiness. In the morning Mara texted me a picture of the skeleton of a leaf she had found on the hospital sidewalk and she wrote, This is what happens when the world takes everything but the shape, and I wrote back, What if shape is enough, and she wrote, Sometimes.\n\nThe next week held itself together like a cake that threatens to fall if you open the oven and we did not open it. I went to work, I went to the meeting in the basement with the chairs and the coffee that tastes like having tried, I went to the river and watched a man teach his son how to throw a line without catching his own ear, I went to the store and chatted with the cashier who always asks me to bless her even though I am an atheist with good manners, and the automatic door at the pharmacy did not open until a woman with a stroller approached beside me and then it flew back so fast the air kissed my arm as if to apologize. If there is a god watching over those doors, he has a sense of humor and a poor understanding of timing. I put these things in the lemon notebook as if bullets could pin down the air and the act of placing a dot at the end of a phrase could nail it to the day.\n\nOn Friday, because we had decided not to be bullied entirely by fear, we drove out to the lake to practice a different kind of water. The Arkansas does not speak the language of Jersey and I wanted to hear our dialect again. We stood on the bank under a sky that had pressed its iron and waited for the place where water coaxes stone to confess. I stepped in up to my shins like a person who has not learned and the chill made my teeth report. Mara held my elbow not because it would help but because sometimes pretending is the only bridge you get. A boy with a stick pretended to be Moses and the water obeyed him only as much as it must a child with an Old Testament in his grin. When we left, we were damp and we were not undone, and in the lemon book I wrote, lake easier, and the little check mark I drew after it felt like the first yes I had earned in weeks.\n\nThat night I took the coin from the windowsill where the morning makes a habit of finding it and put it in my mouth like a wafer. It tasted like a thing that has been in the hands of a man who keeps choosing and that was both iron and bread. I placed it in my father\u2019s palm later with ceremony and he pretended to scold me for drooling on dignity and then he slipped it in his pocket and patted it like you pat a child who has made a plan. Walking home I saw the stray dog again, the saint with his white face, and I crouched and offered him my hand without anticipation. He came forward without haste and sniffed and blinked and then laid his chin for a second in the air where my fingers had meant to be, and that is something no machine can do, and I stood up with him and we both looked down the street to where the flyover men were playing a song that had a new refrain and neither of us needed the words to know we were meant to keep moving.",

                              "content": "The next morning I decided to be loud in the ways that were still permitted. I put on a skirt the color of tail lights and bracelets that made opinions when I moved my wrists. At Freda\u2019s I asked for flour, just a pinch, and told her I was trying a recipe that might be improved by superstition. She cupped white onto my palm as if it were holy and said, \u201cNow you\u2019ll leave a trail,\u201d and I pressed my hands together, two prayer books, and clapped once over the counter on purpose so the dust would rise and drift toward the window where the heat writes its letters. Her niece laughed at the cloud and a child in a dinosaur T-shirt turned and said, \u201cSnow,\u201d to no one in particular. I left two finger marks on the door handle and felt a childish pride, as if I had signed a guest book in a language glass understands. Outside, a boy clipped my elbow with his scooter and said, \u201cSorry, ma\u2019am,\u201d to the space just over my shoulder. I told the air it had been forgiven and the air took its time to run the message to him.\n\nBack at the office the school board arrived with their neon emissary and a florist\u2019s worth of anxiety. The young woman with the shoes, whose name turned out to be Keely, stood in my doorway with a box of donut holes and an expression you might bring to a veterinarian when your cat has done something unspeakable to the rug. Behind her came the auditor, a woman whose hair had been forced by humidity into a halo she did not want and whose eye makeup made it look as if she had not slept since 1996. She introduced herself as Ms. Kent and shook the air where my hand was, briskly, efficiently, like a person who has learned to get through a day by making it into tasks. Her voice was the kind that makes you confess how you arranged the petty cash even when you did it ethically. We took them to the conference room. Mr. Boone came in with his tie obedient and his son\u2019s ghost hovering near him in the lack of it, and Tasha placed a pen at each chair as if we were about to sit a true or false about our souls.\n\nThe numbers did that thing numbers do when they know an audience is not charitable; they threw shadows and invented mysteries. Keely\u2019s foot jittered to a song only she could hear and Ms. Kent stacked and restacked the same three pages until it looked like she was building a small city she might then knock down for revenge. When Ms. Kent stepped into the hall and caught herself, unprofessionally, tears pricking like freckles, I followed with my voice ahead of me. I told her about the freezer room at the hospital and how Mara moved stalagmites from one socket to another during storms as if they weighed nothing because need lightens. I told her about how numbers are like cats; they will sit in your lap if you don\u2019t stare at them directly. She laughed against her will and wiped the underside of her eye with the edge of her wrist because she was wearing mascara and I have learned that women will risk much but not stripes down their cheeks if there is a choice. She thanked\u2014something\u2014for the story. She did not turn toward me, exactly; she bowed toward the corridor in my direction like a person acknowledging good lighting. When she went back in she made a generous decision about a column that could have been argued either way. Keely offered me a donut hole in celebration and I accepted it because there are days you take a sphere of fried sugar like communion and it absolves you for five minutes.\n\nAt lunch, Tasha put her shoulder against the door frame and confessed that she had been offered a job at a place with plants on desks that were watered by schedule and a policy about dogs on Fridays that read like a marriage vow. \u201cIt\u2019s in town,\u201d she said, as if telling me the town would keep us married, \u201cand they promised to let me be weirder than is safe.\u201d I told her to take it, because I am a woman who has learned that pushing people out of cages is not disloyalty. She said she hadn\u2019t decided, which means she had, and I drew her a boat on the back of a folder while she talked about health insurance and the smell of new carpet and the emotional temperature of managers who use the phrase my door is always open. The mast went straight all by itself without my will. When I showed it to her she put her thumb on the hull and pressed until the paper dented like a shoreline. \u201cThat\u2019s the place,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I go, I\u2019ll leave you my stapler,\u201d and I told her I wanted her laugh more.\n\nWe made an attempt at dinner that night as if a meal might be a test you can pass. Mara brought lemons that she pressed with a small tool shaped like a bird and I roasted a chicken with the ridiculous confidence that comes from recipes that call for salt and time. We ate, in the way the middle class does, with gratitude that sits in the room like a good friend. I tried to taste. The acid announced itself like a thin woman with a megaphone. The chicken had its human warmth, the fat ready and the skin adequate, and everything that used to be a delicate balance struck me as a set for a play I had once been in and forgotten the lines to. Mara watched my face with a look that always makes me braver and worse. \u201cTell me,\u201d she said, and I told her that the lemon tasted like the idea of lemon, the way a postcard is the idea of a place if you\u2019ve never been. She tore her piece of bread with those strong fingers and said, \u201cI can feed the part of you that still eats ideas,\u201d and then smiled like a woman who knows the scale of promises and is not afraid of that math.\n\nOn the walk after, the sidewalk was a seam the city had been too busy to tighten. A crew had left a square of wet cement under a small fence, four little metal legs like a child\u2019s playpen. Without making a plan, we both wanted our hands there. We dipped fingers like thieves, the way every mouth wants to lick frosting if invited. Mara pressed her palm, sure, leaving a whorl you could probably use to open her accounts. I pressed mine and watched the gray accept the gesture politely and then shrug. Two faint commas where my ring and my bone might leave a thought, no more. A woman in a visor pushing a stroller, as if they are a species proliferating, smiled at us and said, \u201cYour children will love finding that in twenty years,\u201d and Mara said, \u201cYes,\u201d confidently, even though we have not decided whether children belong to our plot line. I put the lemon notebook on the driver\u2019s seat later and wrote, cement says maybe, and I liked that as an answer better than no.\n\nAnnabeth met me again on the corner where the hospital breathes out its nests of parking and told me a story about a man whose arm had decided it belonged to someone else. She told it gently, with no relish for the freakish. She said, \u201cThe brain is a trickster and also the kindest nurse you ever had. Sometimes it cuts feeling so you can pass through a particular hour. Sometimes it leaves you in the room and takes the heavy box down the stairs without telling you so you think you are lazy for not helping. Sometimes it tells the world to stop touching you because you have not consented for a long time.\u201d We walked slowly and counted the way the automatic doors agreed to respond to Mara, then to me. She watched my face when I used my voice to announce myself to the metal and the glass, saying \u201chello\u201d to a door like I was arriving at a cousin\u2019s. The door behaved perfectly and Annabeth reached to take my wrist and then converted the reach, practiced now, into a gesture near my sleeve. \u201cWe will build a stupid toolkit,\u201d she said. \u201cPerfume, bells, high color, the manner of a woman with a complaint. Your voice most of all. Your voice hooks in.\u201d She told me to go into the stairwell and sing a little. I laughed and did it. The echo hugged me the way a church does if you do not owe it money. When I came out a janitor with a scent like pine in his collar said, \u201cYou made that landing nicer,\u201d to the wall, and I decided I would take compliments where they fell.\n\nThere was a day at the crosswalk when the sun believed itself a benevolent king and I stepped out with my stack of papers and confidence and a car did not slow because the car did not have brains for me. My own brain did what it had been practicing; I said my name in the middle of the street like you say amen and the driver, a woman my mother\u2019s age with a visor and good lipstick, startled like she had seen a deer on hind legs and braked. She put her hand to her heart in the old gesture as if to make sure it was still in attendance. I bowed to her like a clown at the end of a cheap trick. My knees waited to shake until I had made the opposite curb. I wrote in the lemon book, crosswalk voice wins, and underlined it, and made a little star as if I had earned a badge.\n\nAt the meeting in the basement with the coffee that warms you by guilt and then by love, Beau nodded at me the way a man nods when he is asking without asking. I said a few words because my father\u2019s shoulders had lifted into their set of please hear me and I wanted to meet him. I spoke about machines the way a child speaks about weather, too seriously and with one secret. I said that sometimes I feel like the stamp the notary uses at work has been lifted from the desk and no one knows where to put it down, and a woman three chairs away whose hands were knitting a vague blue made a sound that said she knew that landscape. After, my father hugged me full and hard and then let his hands slide to the edges of my sweater as if making sure the sweater had obeyed gravity. In the parking lot with the saucers of light we all love like UFOs, Vivian pressed a small vial into my palm that said orange blossom on a label in a woman\u2019s hand. \u201cTry this,\u201d she said. \u201cIt makes the house remember me when I come in, and I tried a million before it didn\u2019t make me feel like whoever was wearing those magazines in the 80s.\u201d It smelled like a church married to a grove. I dabbed it behind my ears and on my wrists and startled myself later when I turned my head fast and the air came with me.\n\nWhen Tasha told Mr. Boone she was taking the job with the plants and the promise, he surprised us both by leaning back, looking at the ceiling with affection, and then standing to hug her like a man who has read a pamphlet about appropriate workplace boundaries and decided to take the risk in the name of human decency. He said, \u201cYou\u2019ll ruin them in the best way,\u201d and she said, \u201cI know,\u201d and then she cried in my office not like a woman leaving but like a woman arriving somewhere that required a toll she had saved up for in jars. We spent her last hour drawing boats with serious masts on memo pads and leaving them under staplers and in drawers for the future to find when it needs directional signs. When she left that day she took the stapler and wrote me a note that said, I will staple the sky, which is nonsense and also what you want someone you love to threaten.\n\nMara had been asked to present a thing at a small conference in Wilmington about exactly the machines she loved and cursed. \u201cIt\u2019s hardly anything,\u201d she said, \u201cjust me saying that organization is not a personality flaw,\u201d and I told her to call it what it is, a miracle. I pretended I had a choice about whether to go and she pretended we could be prudent and we both did that adult dance until we tripped over the truth. We booked a cheap hotel with carpets that looked like the idea of weather and a broken chalkboard out front that still promised a continental breakfast even though the chalk no longer took. My mother sent a postcard from California that week with a drawing of pelicans arranged like comets and she wrote my name correctly and then underlined it as if to see how it looked, and in the corner she scrawled, \u201cDo you ever think how much of life is waiting in halls?\u201d and I wanted to call and say yes, but I don\u2019t know what you waited for, and also to ask her whether pelicans still stole lunches right off blankets. I pinned the card to the cork board with a pushpin that bent like a tired person and thought of her in fog and me in our heat and Mara near a storm line and all of us trading weather like recipes.\n\nThe night before we left I took the orange blossom and dotted the inside of my scarf and the inside of the jacket I wear when I want to be taken seriously and the hem of the T-shirt I sleep in because I planned to take it off and put it in Mara\u2019s bag. She watched me do it and I watched her watch me and there are entire marriages built on such small ceremonies. We made tea because that is what you do when you have decided to leave a place for a place that has water plotted against you. The kettle sang, as kettles are generous enough to do, and I poured and tasted nothing and tasted everything because the smell put a cloak on the nothing. We sat on the floor with our backs against the couch, our knees up like children making forts, and went over the list of simple weapons: voice, color, scent, the name of a person said in the room like a claim. \u201cAnd if all else fails,\u201d she said, \u201cI will tie you to things,\u201d and I told her I was starting to find it sexy, which made her laugh that laugh that has saved me from five different cliffs.\n\nWe left before the traffic learned how to be cruel and the road offered itself up in long gray scrolls. The strangeness of travel is you become more yourself and less at the same time. The automatic soap dispensers at the first stop offended me and then relented and I curtsied to the paper towels because you may as well thank the gods for their crumbs. In the car, the lemon notebook\u2019s pages were beginning to have that dog-eared look of devotion. Under Machines I added, hotel key card works if someone else tries first, and under People I put, cashier called me hon to the air and it warmed me anyway. Mara drove the way she always does, like a pilot making decisions no one else sees, and sang along to a woman with a voice like rope and violets. We crossed a stretch where the land had been shaved down to bones and the horizon made a solemn promise and kept it. When we arrived, the hotel smelled like last week\u2019s rain and a bowl of apples that was not actually there.\n\nHer talk was in a room with carpet trying to be a forest and chairs that resent their bolts. She set up her slides, which were the careful kind that do not wrestle an audience but lead them up a path by the elbow. I sat near the back with a Styrofoam coffee that tasted like all the churches in America and watched her make a room unlazy. She said the names of machines the way other women say the names of children into microphones and she did not pretend to like any of them more than they deserved. After, a man with a tie that had too many opinions said something about algorithms and she managed to be kind and precise at once, which is her knife work. A woman in a green cardigan asked a question so gently it was almost a confession and Mara answered like a balm. When the applause came it sat down properly, not overeager, the better sort of appreciation. By the snack table a person trying to keep the grapes from rolling into the cookie platter asked me if I had enjoyed our keynote and I said yes and wanted to say more and did not because explanation always costs a toll.\n\nWe walked after, because if there is a body of water within a mile Mara will negotiate me toward it without me noticing. The Cape Fear wore its bad name with class. The air had salt in its breath even upriver. A man on a bench played a guitar with only five strings and still found us a song. The pier had planks that had listened to more stories than wood should be asked to hold. As we stepped, the light took on that drama school quality it has near closing time. I watched our shadows again because once you begin you cannot stop. Mine did not go missing, not entirely; it limped, then thickened, then refused, like a friend who will not come to your party and then does at the last minute with a casserole. Mara took my hand in the way you will if you have decided to stop being careful, and for a moment her fingers warmed the place my fingers would have been as if heat still obeyed the old rules. It was not the cinematic moment where everything snaps into a lesson. It was two women with a lemon notebook and a scarf and a past and a river and a promise and a cliff.\n\nThat night, in the bed with the rustle of sheets that have been laundered out of their softness, I said the sentence I had been rehearsing for months in my mouth. I said it in the dark because truth looks less formal in the dress she sleeps in. I told her that I loved her and that it was the kind of love that felt like a tide chart I kept folded in my purse even when the river behaved. When I had finished and there was the space afterwards where the air decides if it will give you back what you have pressed into it, she reached for me and her hand passed into the heat by my shoulder and came back with nothing but proof. She said my name very softly, a way I had not yet heard, the way people say a country when they have finally crossed its border. She said she loved me back, and I saw the word go into the room and put its lamp down and open curtains. We kissed with fabric between us, my foolish scarf and her mouth and mine, the way children play marriages in school with mittens and veils borrowed, and it was ridiculous and decent and I would have married the absurd right then for the service it provided. Beneath the cloth I could feel her breath and hear the small noise she makes when her heart permits joy, which is an animal sound, not a word. It anchored me better than any belt could.\n\nIn the morning the hotel breakfast was a democracy of carbs and two apples that had seen things. We took a cinnamon roll to the river and tore it like sisters in a fable and fed the gulls even though a sign asked us not to because the sign had no gulls to scold. The sky had the posture of a person on the edge of deciding if they would leave the party. Mara tipped her head back to let the wind lift her hair and then squared her shoulders because she has never been good at letting weather be in charge. \u201cOne more walk,\u201d she said, and we went to the ferry steps where the river pretends to be a road. The boards there had been worn to language. A man in a shirt that had been white told us to watch our feet because the splinters had made a union. We watched. We walked anyway.\n\nOn our way back, a child with a balloon shaped like a fish let go because the sky is better at invitations than parents are at warning. The fish went to its god and the child made the sound children make when they have lost a kingdom. Mara started to run without thinking because she is the kind of woman who thinks she can persuade physics by argument. I called her name the way I have learned to call it when I am at the edge of the street and the cars have not agreed on me yet, and she stopped and turned and the balloon was already on its way to the afterlife of latex. The mother thanked a radius of people and the mother\u2019s friend adjusted her visor and the child hiccuped like a broken metronome. We walked on, our shadows behaving within acceptable error margins. The lemon notebook had its new page waiting and I put, ferry boards said yes, and then I wrote it again because repetition makes a thing truer to me, even if it annoys other people.\n\nOn the drive home the rain decided we were not to be tested further and let us keep the dry. Somewhere past the state line the stray dog crossed my mind like a benediction and I said it out loud without meaning to. \u201cThe saint,\u201d I said, and Mara said, \u201cWhich one?\u201d and I told her about the white face and how he had put his chin where my fingers would have been and she said, \u201cThat is how I plan to love you when it all is its worst,\u201d and we both sat in that sentence like a pew and let it do its job. When we got back to the apartment, the coin on the sill flashed once at the last light and I touched it with my mouth again because I am foolish and crave metal in my narrative. The orange blossom had held at the throat of my jacket and when I hung it on the chair the room leaned toward me as if to ask what I had learned.\n\nLater, when sleep did its patchwork, I dreamed I was inside a library where all the books were ledger paper and each column had my handwriting and every I was here had a smudge where a thumb had gone not quite through but tried. The librarian wore Tasha\u2019s raspberry nails and said I could take out only three at a time, and when I protested she insisted, smiling, that rationing makes you spend slower and love harder. I woke with the scarf under my hand like an obedient pet and the first edge of panic not attending, for once, like a bad neighbor. I lay there and watched the weak morning try to convince itself to be day and I felt the weight of my voice in my mouth and the thought I had not dared think yet was this: there might be a place on the map where everything will either decide or undo, and we are walking toward it not because we love to be ruined but because all the streets we choose are the same street in the end. I did not write that in the lemon book because some lines do not want paper near them yet. I wrote instead, tomorrow buy more flour, and put the pen down like a promise.",

It swung easier some hours, stubbornly others, and I learned to listen for the squeak the way you listen for a kettle when you\u2019re in the next room. I wore the orange blossom and watched men with clipboards pause in doorways like they had forgotten what they came for and then remember. I spoke my name to empty rooms sometimes, a superstition that embarrassed me if I thought about it too hard, so I tried not to. Tasha collected her plants from the windowsill on a Wednesday and introduced them to the light with the gravity of a god. \u201cThis is Meyer,\u201d she told the sun, and then she turned to me and pressed her forehead to mine without touching and said, \u201cThis is where we make the warm ourselves,\u201d and I told her I was not that kind of appliance and she grinned and said, \u201cYou are,\u201d and then cried after she\u2019d said goodbye to Mr. Boone in the supply closet because she is the kind of person who gives her best minutes to places that will miss her later and pretend they don\u2019t.\n\nShe sent me a picture from her new place a week later of a desk with a toy robot and a plant with long hair and a mug that said \u201cmake it weird,\u201d and she wrote, they clap when I say I\u2019m leaving for lunch, and then, I think I might learn to like applause that doesn\u2019t require me to sing. I sent back a photo of the lemon notebook with the page titled People and under it my tidy list of the ways the day had agreed to see me: the dry cleaner who said \u201csweetheart\u201d in the direction of my shoulder and meant me, the child who looked straight at me and declared my hair a color, the woman at the pharmacy who asked what perfume and then, without waiting, said, \u201cOrange blossom, good choice,\u201d and my own voice, my honest, tacky savior.\n\nMara kept the scarf in her bag like a talisman, and sometimes, in an elevator or at the bottom of a hospital stairwell when she had fifteen years of air left between tasks, she texted, tie? and I texted back yes even if my hands were busy, because the act itself did a kind of work that breath couldn\u2019t. Annabeth, in the way of a person who is good at not making too big a meal of your fear, sent me an email with a list so simple it could be printed on a recipe card: \u201csmell, sound, color, friction, name,\u201d and I taped it inside a cabinet where the bowls live so I could read it while I found the right one for cereal. My father took to pausing at the threshold of rooms like a man about to say grace and then remembering he did not need to. He would glance at the coin and I would see in his eyes the quick calculation of days he had not been a certain kind of man and he would smile a small private smile and then say, louder, \u201cTea?\u201d because sometimes you do not say hope out loud because you are afraid it will leave through the window if it hears its own name.\n\nOn a Thursday that did not announce itself as important, my mother called. Her number was a geography I do not travel and I watched it ring twice before I picked it up because I wanted to practice not wanting. She began not with hello but with, \u201cI am near a pier that is ashamed of itself,\u201d and in the background I could hear gulls and the sound of a man dragging a cooler as if everyone in California must have the same neighbors as ours. She said she had been thinking of the word undertow and had decided it made people blame the water for wanting what it wants and that she preferred riptide because it sounded like a mood. She told me a woman named Wally had invited her to a reading on a boat and she had said yes even though boats make her remember that she is small, and then she said my name correctly and it was as if a bird had flown into a window and remained whole anyway. She asked me if I had been happy lately with a consideration that startled me, the way strangers can be so kind that you feel both loved and anonymous, and I said, after a breath that felt like a rehearsal, that I had been something near it and sometimes inside it and once in a while exactly it. \u201cGood,\u201d she said, as if I had put a check beside a box she had been carrying around all day. \u201cSomeone should be,\u201d she added, and then she told me the shape of the fog on the bay and how it made blades out of ordinary things and I wanted to ask her who taught her to miss people sideways, but the call was already ending in that way some calls do, the way that makes you feel like a commercial for a product you both won\u2019t buy.\n\nIt was Mara who said it, like a dare and like a gift, in the quiet after my mother\u2019s voice had left my walls. \u201cOne more ocean before the cold,\u201d she said. \u201cA meaner one than Jersey. Not because I want to be punished but because I want to stand next to a true thing and feel it not lie to me.\u201d I looked at the map in my head where money sits like small weights and I saw the lines we could draw and where they would arc and what they would ask of the ledger, and I said, \u201cWe will find a ticket under the couch,\u201d and she smiled because sometimes her belief in my tricks is the only magic I accept. Flights are the kind of extravagance that if you squint can look like prudence; time is money in a way that money never manages to be time. We bought two seats to Boston with a credit card that looked at us and shrugged and said, \u201cAll right,\u201d and we promised ourselves we would sit in the airport like ladies who have always known how to read the departures board with elegance.\n\nI was worried about the machines. Annabeth did not laugh. \u201cThey will like you more than the doors,\u201d she said. \u201cThey do not have to decide in the same way. You will be light on their screens and heavy where it matters.\u201d At the airport the first automatic door, perhaps out of regional pride, made a show of opening for us three full steps before it needed to, and I pretended to curtsey. At the security line, a man with a badge that had his name but not his face smiled at Mara and then gave his smile to the tray into which she put our shoes. I took off my bracelets and they clinked like a sentence under heavy punctuation. The woman at the scanner had a voice like a good bus driver, loud without cruelty. \u201cStep in. Feet on the yellow. Hands up.\u201d I did what she said because I am sometimes a doer when told. The cylinder purred around me and the picture I could not see made someone I could not see nod and then shake their head. \u201cAgain,\u201d the driver said, softer. Mara had already put her shoes on and was rolling her eyes at her own feet, which always forget one sock in the corner of her bag. \u201cAgain,\u201d the woman said one more time, the third with the kind of patience good people mistake for duty. When I stepped out she motioned me gently with an open palm to the side where another agent held a pair of hands over a table as if warming them for a song.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to do a pat down,\u201d she said, very formal, and her eyes kept sliding to my left in that way people have started to watch the air. \u201cConsent?\u201d she added, and I wanted to hug her for remembering the word that makes it all bearable. \u201cConsent,\u201d I said, and she did her careful pressing, the back of her hand where there are laws about how to touch even when touching is part of the job, and it was not that she passed through me; it was that she seemed to find the edges of me where they were clearest and move around the places the world had left blank like a person stepping around a puddle in the dress she saved up for. \u201cThank you,\u201d she said, as if I had granted her a favor by existing, and we both pretended I had not been a question.\n\nOn the plane a woman with a magazine and nails the color of cherries took the seat across the aisle and fell in love with the baby two rows up without ever introducing herself. Mara squeezed my knee when the sky tried to argue with the wing because planes are good at reminding you that you are in a box floating in a mood. I held the scarf under my palm and tried to remember the exact feeling of her skin when our hands still docked without a broker. The city was a puzzle we left behind for someone else to finish. In the air, the landscape gives up form and turns into narrative; rivers are lines, lakes are commas, clouds are a paragraph the wind is editing. When we dropped into Boston, the ground came up to meet us like an old friend who has been practicing how not to hurt you with enthusiasm. The airport there smelled like salt and coffee and the first day of college. The taxi driver had a picture of a boy in a soccer uniform propped on his dashboard where the fish had sat in ours. He told us, without being asked, the best places to get chowder, and then, without meaning to, the story of the time he got lost on the way to his wife in labor and how the baby had forgiven him eventually by coming home late every day from school for a month like a ritual.\n\nWe drove up the coast in a borrowed car with a heater that sounded like an argument. The signs were full of towns that made my mouth feel like it was learning an accent. Marblehead. Gloucester. Rockport. The water here did not fuss; it brooded. The rocks were not decorations; they had jobs. We stopped where a woman in a red hat told us to because everybody tells travelers the same secrets and we believe them because we want to be on the right side of the myth. The wind went straight through my sweater with the candor of an old aunt. The smell was the kind that makes your teeth answer, clean and briny and the opposite of sweet. We found a stretch of path that had been obliged to exist by generations of people who insisted that walking beside trouble is part of a life well-lived. The railing was a moral suggestion, not a promise. Mara took her camera out not to take pictures but to make her hands behave like visitors.\n\nWe walked with our bodies angled forward, not because we were eager but because the wind asked us to introduce ourselves. The tide was in a mood. The rocks took it as they had always taken it, with the resigned nobility of elders at weddings. A woman in a mustard coat was laughing into her scarf and a man with a face the color of a good table watched her as if the laugh were a sport he had paid to see. Mara pointed with her chin toward a place where the water tried and tried at a seam in the rock, a rhythm older than our superstition. \u201cThis is the one,\u201d she said, and then added, \u201cnot for drama but for scale,\u201d and I nodded even though nodding in this wind felt like giving away part of your face.\n\nWe sat when the railing insisted we should and when we got up we pretended we had not been obeying. I looked for my shadow because I am a fool and because keeping count of how many times the world remembers me has become like counting your steps when you don\u2019t want to think about death. It came and went in the stubby way northerly light makes everyone a little shorter. Mara put her hand palm-up near mine without quite touching and I lowered mine into that waiting the way you set a feat of pastry into an oven and then do not open the door. We did not make a shape the world could recognize. We made an intention and left it there between us where the sea could borrow it for a minute like a dish left to cool.\n\nThere are towns in Massachusetts where the houses are so clean-faced you feel you must ask permission to breathe. Ours had an inn with wallpaper that looked like someone had painted the inside of a shell and thought better of it halfway through. The woman at the desk put down a ledger like a stage prop and I loved her on sight for giving paper the respect I give it. She handed Mara a pen as if passing a baton in a race and then, to me, a key with a heavy fob that said 12 in an ambitious font. The key weighed like proof. I carried it with ceremony and set it on the table in our room like a bell we would ring when the evening needed to change shape. In that room, which had two chairs that had not agreed on who should be comfortable, the window gave us a slice of ocean the way pie is sliced for greedy cousins. We shrugged off our coats grudgingly and I rubbed my hands together in the old childish way that makes parents say you will set yourself on fire and then I cupped them around my mouth and said my name softly and watched my breath fog the glass and declare me present and then decide I had been presumptuous and recede.\n\nNight here was a different animal than the night at home. It hunted slower, with better posture. We went down to the small restaurant where men pretended to know oysters and women actually did and the chalkboard claimed chowder three times as if to prove it would not run out if it were forced to repeat itself. The waitress wore her hair like a vote and called everyone friends and meant it as a bribe. We ate, because eating is how you say yes to a place, and Mara made the soup seem like an event. I watched the color on her mouth and decided that lipstick is a kind of announcement I had been too timid to make my whole life. We walked home with our hands in our pockets like teenagers who have stolen cigarettes and are pretending the cold is the reason their fingers feel wrong.\n\nIn bed, under a duvet that clearly came from a catalog that arrives addressing you as if you are already who you want to be, we made our small adjustments. The scarf lay between our pillows like a referee that does not blow its whistle. The heat knocked in the wall like an upstairs neighbor. We talked in that sleepward way that makes sentences sound like recipes mumbled in kitchens you have loved. I said, because the thoughts had lined up and recruited me as their witness, that this place felt like the kind of place where you find out who is brave and who simply looks it. She said, because she is the sort of person who finds courage in the correct drawer, that the difference is irrelevant when the wave is knee-high and very relevant when it is not, and that either way she did not plan to go in past her thighs. I told her that a thigh is a promise as well as a body part and she laughed into the pillow and told me to save metaphors for when the restaurant ran out of pie.\n\nMorning made us new. It always tries. We put on clothes that made us look like we intended to be dignified about wind, which is a farce and also a fight worth picking. We stood on the rocks because everyone stands on the rocks; it is the choreography of visitors, and we would not insult the dance by pretending an originality we did not have. I tied the scarf around my wrist and then around hers and the knot perversely looked like a heart and we rolled our eyes at the coincidence and let it be. A man with a dog said to watch our step and then looked a hair left of my face and repeated it as if he had told the news to the wrong person first and was correcting his etiquette. We thanked him in stereo.\n\nDown the path a woman in a purple hat was making a devotional of photographs. She crouched, she stood, she crouched again, the way belief makes you bob sometimes. The water did its long arithmetic against the granite. It sent up spray in small astonishments. There was a spot where the steps had been carved into the stone by someone with a patience you only see in New England carpenters or thieves, and the salt had done its bleaching and sanding so that sometimes you forgot the steps were not bones. \u201cNot down there,\u201d Mara said, not because she thought I would but because she needed to hear herself say a boundary out loud. The wind played the old joke of trying to pull my hood off my head. I put it back on, not because I wanted to keep my hair dry but because I wanted to quarrel with an element and win one small round.\n\nWe stood where the spray could pretend to baptize us without truly wetting our feet. The sea made that sound that is so much like a crowd that you almost turn to see if strangers have decided to sing. I put my mouth near her ear and I said, lightly to prove I can still be light, that the lemon notebook was sitting in the room on the desk and would likely, if it could, write in itself about the angles of this place. She turned and her cheek brushed the scarf and the scent of orange blossom rose like a forgiveness, and she made her surprise face at the way it moved through the cold, and she said she wanted to sit in a pew that smelled like this when she was old. We made a plan without making it: after this rock, that one; after that one, the bench; after the bench, the path back where tea gloats and we let it. Plans are a religion we practice because nothing else asks so little.\n\nThe first big shot of water came when we were not looking, because that is how show-offs work. It was theatrical and not mean, and it wet our jeans to the shin and made the child part of me giggle and the adult part of me inventory our phones. The second did not arrive soon after because it was not the second; it was an accountant wave, biding time, waiting to be wise. Between the two, the sun shouldered through a stripe of cloud and made the wet rock shine in a way that makes it look like a coin you want to pick up even if someone tells you it belongs to a saint. The old saying about never turning your back is the sort of thing people write on magnets, and you forget until the day the ocean spouses itself to your story without your consent. We did not turn our backs. We were not heroic. We did the stupid smart thing of thinking we knew the shape of a minute.\n\nA gull cried like a hinge. The dog barked at its shadow. A group of teenagers at the far end of the path made the noise all teenagers make, the one that is laughter and a dare. The light went a little sideways. \u201cAfter that splash, home,\u201d Mara said\u2014and then stopped talking, because discourse had to be negotiated with the air. I stood, the way you stand when you are inside the picture and you do not want to drain it of anything by moving. The wind took a breath. The sea gathered etiquette or nerve, I cannot say which.\n\nWe saw it begin: the curl far out, the suggestion of a shoulder about to be thrown. It\u2019s odd what the eye decides to narrate. I remember thinking, from nowhere sensible, that this was the exact color of a bruise that starts to heal. I remember seeing the scarf\u2019s knot and thinking I should have learned a different one, the kind sailors use that knows how to be loyal. I remember the shape of Mara\u2019s mouth changing not to fear but to work. The water stood up. It is hard to tell this part without making it more polite than it was. It was not a cliff falling on a church. It was not a window shattering into roses. It was water, and the sky took a mouthful of her because that was the piece of the world nearest to it that could prove gravity is only a suggestion when the ocean is in the mood.\n\nThere was a sound I cannot put into music. It was wood and teeth and a choir chair being dragged across linoleum. The wave came not in a sheet but in a hand with too many fingers. It reached around the shoulder of the rock and made a small correction in our math. The scarf tightened and then tried to think. The knot did its best work, which was not enough work for this. Her knees went light. My feet found nothing they trusted. The railing where it was a suggestion suggested we hold it; I held air and the memory of wood and the memory was generous but it forgot to be solid. The teenagers were suddenly saints, one of them shouting hoarsely, the kind of hoarse that takes hours of laughing to earn, and the dog took three authoritative steps backward because dog wisdom is the better kind. I said her name with my chest. The wind said no in five dialects. The scarf, faithful as an oath said too fast, slid.\n\nBodies do what bodies are born to do. She reached with that left hand I have watched tie a thousand patient knots on childhood and grown-up tangles and it went through the place my right hand had earned by long practice and could not make now. The world glitched; it did not stop. I felt the heat of her near me the way you feel an idea right before it arrives. Then the wave took the back of her coat in its mouth and stepped down from the stage. The step wasn\u2019t dramatic. The step was banal, the way accidents in kitchens are banal, a cut that bleeds more than is fair. She went forward and down with grace because she is that kind of woman even in physics. The scarf went slack in my palm in that obscene way cloth goes dead when it is not being asked to be a boundary anymore.\n\nI did not scream, not at first. Not because I am brave. Because there is a lag when something your theory of the world depends on is revised by water. The man with the dog shouted something that had numbers in it; a number you dial when you are correct and want to feel you participated. The mustard coat ran. The teenagers turned into rescue, the verb. There was a rope somewhere because men in towns like this are never more than thirty feet from a coil of rope in any season. Someone threw the rope too short. Someone else threw it like he had been born for this offering. The wave that had taken a bite rolled her further than I wanted a person I loved to roll and then did the decency of letting her show her face, coughing and furious, and then the stone took her side like an indifferent friend, blocking what it could of the fuss. I moved because my body, the part of it that can still vote, told me the worst sin is theater when someone is drowning. I got on my knees because a nun in me remains. I put my hands into the wave with the gall of a child who has never had to ask permission. It gave me cold. That is the truth I will never argue with it about. It gave me cold and noise and the memory of her shoulder between my palms and the precise knowledge that I would trade math for touch for the rest of my days and the universe will not accept that currency.\n\nWhen they got a loop around her waist she did not fight as hard as you would think. She is practical, and she is not the sort of person who refuses help because pride is a more precious possession than breath. The men leaned their weight back in a mutual trust fall with rock and salt supervising. The rope, honest in the way rope is, did what it had been taught. The water tried, like a suitor with poor timing, and was refused. She came against my knees and I made a cradle of my lap that my lap could not be, and she lay half on the stone and half on an ambition we had both been keeping. Her eyes met mine, not cinematic at all, just two tired eyes trying to find the place to rest that does not require apology. \u201cOkay,\u201d she said, not to me, to the moment, like a woman agreeing to be put under for a surgery she wants to wake from. Then she coughed and rolled and sat and put the heels of her hands into her eyes as if to push the sea back with bone.\n\nMany things happened around us in ritual order: phones gave up their attention to maps and acquired it for the men in coats; a siren placed its color in the air like a marker; the woman with the purple hat kept taking pictures even though decency had a case to make against her, and she kept them for herself, not because she was cruel but because sometimes you witness and your only language is to collect. The wind selected a few sentences and tore them up just to show us it could. The rope fell into obedient loops on the ground like something that would ask to be put away properly later and be thanked for its service. The scarf, traitorous and faithful both, lay against my thigh and I wanted to bite it and kiss it and tie it around the neck of the sea.\n\nInside the inn, the woman with the ledger turned into a nurse with a kettle and a wool blanket without having to change clothes. She made tea the way instruction manuals tell you to make tea and forced mugs into our hands that I held because heat and ceramic are a church too. Mara was shivering and telling her body to quit the dramatics, the way she tells a machine to stop an alarm with a palm like a blessing, and we did the little obedient things people do after large resistances: we took off wet socks, we rubbed ankles with the corners of towels, we said we were fine, we said thank you enough times that the word turned into its sound without meaning. The purple hat sat two chairs away and did not have the grace to look sorry; she had the grace to look earnest, which is sometimes better.\n\nWhen we were alone, the kettle quiet after impressing itself on the room, we looked at the lemon notebook on the bedside table. It was open because I had left it that way as if to let the day write its name when we were gone. I picked up the pen and wrote with a hand that had learned nothing and everything, \u201crock path, rope, wave with a mouth,\u201d and the ink did not pool; it sank right in, thirsty as if I had finally been telling the truth with the right nib. Mara took the pen and wrote, very small and very neat, \u201cdid not die,\u201d and then put a period, not because she believed in conclusions but because she needed to end one sentence.\n\nWe drove down the coast later than we meant to, not because we were afraid of the place but because we were a little in love with it, the way you sometimes keep talking with a person who has been rude because their rudeness was honest and it taught you something useful about your own manners. In Boston we returned the car like people who had taken a child to the park and not let it run past the fence. At the airport the doors opened in the same mean way every time, as if they had decided to stop mocking me and simply perform their trick. The scanner hummed and the woman with the bus driver voice nodded me through with the efficiency of someone who has had enough miracles for one shift and is not collecting any more. On the plane, a man across the aisle snored with a toddler\u2019s abandon and the flight attendant smiled like a woman who had seen worse and will again.\n\nBack home, the river had retreated into behaving and the dog with the saint\u2019s face was asleep in a patch of afternoon like he had rented the square for the hour. Vivian put her hands on my cheeks and then on Mara\u2019s and then on the air in front of the two of us and laughed because sometimes laughter is cheaper than panic and tiny enough to go in your pocket. My father took one look and sat down because sitting is his act of respect when the story has been larger than is fair. He pressed the coin into my palm with the relief of a man handing back a baby and told me to keep it until the end of the week, and I did not argue because sometimes being obedient is the kind of love that matters.\n\nNight fell and I did not go to sleep. I sat with my ledger like a widow with knitting and I wrote I was here not in the line but in the margin, as if I needed to say it off record, away from the part that will be audited. The ink behaved. My voice behaved, when I used it to make the word sound in the kitchen at two in the morning. The scarf lay on the back of a chair and looked like a snake that had decided to understand compassion. Mara wrote from three floors and two blocks away that she could still feel the sea in the cartilage of her ears and that she planned to fall asleep saying the name of every fish she could think of to put a fence around it. I wrote back that I could come over and read her a taxonomy and she replied with the word \u201clater,\u201d the way people promise to keep living, and I held the phone warm until it cooled, and when I finally set it down it made the smallest noise on the table, a coin, a stone, a proof.",
