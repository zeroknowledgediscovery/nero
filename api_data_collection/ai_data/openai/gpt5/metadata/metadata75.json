     "novel_text": "At dawn, Dover pretended to be a postcard again. The chalk edge of the cliff cut the sky cleanly; the gulls were already up and arguing about something nobody else could get worked up about, and the sea, in its endless shrug, slapped against the harbour wall as if to say, there you go, have another go, let\u2019s see. Hannah had been awake since five-thirty. It wasn\u2019t nerves, not exactly. Just that a thread ran through her\u2014silver, taut\u2014that pulled her up out of bed before the alarm, tugging her along toward the day.\n\nShe made tea and stood by the kitchen window, sipping it black. Her terrace had a view of the ferry lanes if she craned a bit, and when she did, a ship the size of a quiet thought drifted across the rectangle of sea. Somewhere, inside that big white thing full of strangers and cartons of goods and thick ropes and blinking lights, somebody was probably also drinking tea, scalding their lip, thinking about a Tuesday that had arrived just like that. Hannah smiled at the idea that her own thoughts might be mirrored by some passing stranger. It made the morning softer.\n\nIn the classroom, the tidy fish tank hummed. The filter kept up its ghost-whisper, the heater lamp glowed like a tiny amber sun. Inside, her small geniuses flickered: neon tetras, wobbly zebra danios, and six guppies that had started out as three. Babies spent half their lives getting born, Hannah thought. People spent the other half finding their way back to a place where they could be simple again. She untied her scarf and hung it on the back of the chair. On the whiteboard she wrote the day and a quote in peculiar purple: \u201cLiterature is news that stays news.\u201d \u2014Ezra Pound. Then, underneath, in smaller script: Plus, we will not set the classroom on fire today, 9C.\n\n\u201cPromise me,\u201d she said out loud to the empty desks.\n\nThe guppy with the stubby dorsal, the one with a blotch like a thumbprint on his tail, waggled nearer to the glass and gave her a hard little bead eye. This was the boss of the guppies; she\u2019d named him after a soldier from an old story she loved. Galahad was too grand. She shortened it. Gal.\n\n\u201cMorning, Gal,\u201d she told him. \u201cBe kind to the others today. No nipping. Not hilarious. Not cute.\u201d\n\nHe flicked sideways, showed her his sheen, and took a ceremonial bite at a bubble. He was the most temperamental of her small universe. If fish could brood, Gal brooded, tiny and serious. The science teacher down the hall had told her guppies could be territorial in tanks, and sometimes, if they saw their reflection, they\u2019d posture at it all day. \u201cLike men in gyms,\u201d Mr. Shaw had said, balancing microwaved porridge and optimism in one hand.\n\nIt was, properly, Mr. Shaw who had introduced the tank as a calming presence for the students\u2014well-being, reduced anxiety, regulated breathing. But feeding them had become Hannah\u2019s small meditation. The students thought she\u2019d set up the tank to teach them empathy, which was a pleasant rumor she never corrected.\n\nThe first bell spilled bodies along the corridor. Teenagers arrived in drifts, hair damp, shoes squeaking. They came into her room carrying armfuls of their waking lives: a basketball, the taste of rushed toast, a worry about a family member said sideways. She saw it all like flash cards. They were hers. Not really, not legally or forever, but for being thirteen and fourteen and hopelessly proud about washing their face now and then, they belonged to her for sixty minutes a day. She was both carried and tugged by this\u2014she didn\u2019t go around naming it love in case anybody overheard and thought she might be weak.\n\n\u201cMiss Flint, Miss Flint,\u201d Noah said, two steps into the room, skipping the whole greeting scheme. \u201cIf a character lies to another character, and then something bad happens to them, do we assume the author is telling us lying is bad?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhoa,\u201d she said. \u201cGood morning to you too. Put your bag down, Noah. Do we assume that?\u201d\n\n\u201cI did in the homework,\u201d he said, in a way that was both hopeful and defensive. \u201cDo not call my mother.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the author is telling you that choices have consequences. But lying isn\u2019t always wrong in literature, or in life. Sometimes it saves someone.\u201d\n\nSafia came past and rolled her eyes at the fish. \u201cMiss, that one\u2019s aggy.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh?\u201d Hannah looked at Gal, who was indeed performing a tiny, indignant dance at the glass.\n\n\u201cI walked past and he swam at me like he wanted beef,\u201d Safia said, twirling her pen. \u201cHe knows what he did.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe knows nothing,\u201d Hannah said. \u201cHe\u2019s a fish.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Safia smirked. \u201cBecause he seems to know something. He\u2019s got that look.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have that look,\u201d Noah muttered, flipping open his English folder, where he always drew a little dragon in the top corner before he wrote a sentence.\n\nIt was a good class. For most of the period, they did not set anything on fire. They argued, with zeal, about whether Macbeth was a weak man pushed by a violent woman, or a violent man full stop. They wrote in that fervent way they had, where their handwriting went sideways as if chasing a thought down a corridor. When she read what they wrote, she saw little glimmers. Not genius, not the kind you could swallow whole and be saved by forever. She saw care. Care looked like the moment a student crossed out an extra adjective and left a sentence cleaner. Care looked like when the boy with the loudest laugh stayed quiet because he\u2019d seen that the girl next to him needed the room to speak.\n\nHalfway through the lesson, the headteacher knocked and leaned in as if the door were a curtain and this was a stage. Mr. Barnes always had the air of a man stepping onto a platform to announce an arrival. He had tried to retire three times and failed all three, and there was rumor that the school would end before he did. The way children continued to believe in him and also did not believe in anything else, that was something.\n\n\u201cAh! The Bard\u2019s emissaries,\u201d he boomed, then lowered his voice when he saw the plan on the board. \u201cMiss Flint, could you quickly pop into the staffroom at break?\u201d\n\n\u201cCertainly,\u201d she said. He gave a small bow to the fish tank before he left, because for all his bluster he was fundamentally a person who took things to heart.\n\nAt break, she left the room in Safia\u2019s charge with a warning about the fish. \u201cNobody taps on the glass,\u201d she said, and then saw three hands drop, guilty. \u201cAnd if Gal starts to act like he\u2019s running the place, remind him who pays the water bill. Sit. And absolutely do not set anything on\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cFire, Miss,\u201d they chorused, gleeful. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nThe staffroom was in that state between a war and a potluck. Coffee, biscuits, papers. Two flyers stuck on the noticeboard: one for yoga, one for CPR training. Somebody had drawn a moustache on the CPR dummy in the photograph. Mr. Shaw was bent over his phone, a smear of porridge on his tie like he\u2019d been kissed by breakfast.\n\n\u201cI saw you at the Mariner on Friday,\u201d he said when he looked up. \u201cYou didn\u2019t say you were performing. You were marvelous.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was not,\u201d she said, too quick, and then she wanted to laugh at herself. \u201cBut thank you.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou did this\u2026 something with your voice. That song, what was it?\u201d\n\n\u201cTraditional,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know the title. My mum used to sing versions of it when I was small. I think it\u2019s Irish. Or Welsh. Or it just pretends to be everything.\u201d\n\nMr. Barnes appeared with a plate of two custard creams, which he presented to her as if awarding a medal. \u201cHannah,\u201d he said, \u201cyou\u2019re avoiding the subject as usual.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, are we having an intervention?\u201d She took the biscuits. She felt absurdly seen. \u201cIs this about my addiction to chalk, because\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about your singing,\u201d he said, softening. \u201cYou\u2019re an English teacher pretending to be only an English teacher. Meanwhile, half the town have recorded you on their phones. Do something with it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat would I do?\u201d\n\n\u201cApply,\u201d Mr. Shaw said. \u201cBritain\u2019s Got Talent. You think we don\u2019t have Wi-Fi in this school? I\u2019ve seen the adverts. I\u2019ve seen you sing. You could. Couldn\u2019t she?\u201d\n\nIn the corner, Ms. Davis from Maths looked up from marking and made a face like she\u2019d bit into a lemon and liked it. \u201cI haven\u2019t got telly since 2004. But I\u2019d watch if you were on, Hannah.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to be one of those teachers who goes on telly and the kids find it and they clip it and slow it down and make it into a meme where I look like a chicken.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat will happen no matter what you do,\u201d Mr. Barnes said kindly. \u201cYou can either become a chicken on a big stage, or a chicken on a small one.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hate you all,\u201d she said, and bit the biscuit. She wasn\u2019t really upset. The thought of it loosened something. The thought terrified her, made her heart full with panic as if someone had plugged her into the shore power for a ferry. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I have marking. And parents\u2019 evening. And the fish.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe fish will rally,\u201d Mr. Shaw said. \u201cWe\u2019ll feed them.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot you,\u201d she told him, but there was no bite in it. Her phone buzzed in her pocket\u2014a reminder to drink water, because she had to trick herself into kindness. She sipped his coffee instead, which was a mistake. \u201cGood grief, how do you drink this? It\u2019s like someone brewed a campfire.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s because the kettle is older than the school,\u201d Ms. Davis muttered.\n\nShe thought about it all day, moving around the edges of herself. It wasn\u2019t that she\u2019d never wanted something for herself. She had. She was just good at wanting quietly, in rooms where nobody else could get hurt. Once, years ago, she\u2019d saved up to go to London to see a show and then given the tickets away, because a parent called her the day before and said they couldn\u2019t afford to get their son to the college interview that might change everything, and it turned out the train ticket and her show tickets were close enough, and she\u2019d sat at home and eaten all the strawberries in one go and listened to the whole show on cast recording while she did laundry and told herself it was fine. It had been fine. But it had also not been fine. Both.\n\nAt the end of the day, she wrote \u201cHomework: Three paragraphs on ambition in Macbeth\u201d on the board, and put a smiley face with vampire teeth, for reasons known only to her marker. The class groaned like a choir performed by furniture. Out in the corridor, a boy\u2019s voice cracked like a plank splitting.\n\n\u201cWould you apply?\u201d Safia asked her, on her way out, one hand on the doorframe as if anchoring herself. \u201cFor that show?\u201d\n\n\u201cI might,\u201d Hannah said, as if answering about a dish she might cook, or a jumper she might try on. \u201cShould I?\u201d\n\nSafia nodded in a very adult way for fourteen. \u201cI think you should do stuff when it scares you. Unless it\u2019s like getting in a stranger\u2019s van. But the other stuff. The mind stuff.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks for that detailed moral framework,\u201d Hannah said, smiling. \u201cNo vans. Noted.\u201d\n\nWhen the last child had clattered away, she watered the plants, she fed the fish. Gal performed his small drama again, shimmying, flaring his little tail, lunging toward his own reflection in the glass, then at a bewildered danio who darted off, stripes flashing like a coded message.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll get yourself worked up,\u201d she told him. \u201cAnd then what? You\u2019ll jump out onto the carpet and blame me.\u201d\n\nShe stood a long moment, hands on the back of a chair, the muscles in her shoulders talking to her. It was as if someone else, years ago, had made a decision about her and she\u2019d been living it ever since; teaching had saved her in so many small ways she didn\u2019t know how to count them. But there was something else she had never admitted, not to her mother, not even to herself on bad days. She missed singing the way some people missed summer when it was winter\u2014an ache that made winter, paradoxically, sharper and more ferocious. Even singing in a corner of a pub with the smell of chips and the stick of beer on the floor had been a kind of sanctuary.\n\nWhen she got home, Tamsin\u2019s cat was on her doorstep again, a smooth black shape with a bell that never made a sound. Tamsin\u2019s cat did not know she wasn\u2019t Hannah\u2019s cat. She knew that a human lived here who would produce a saucer of milk or a piece of chicken at odd, inconvenient hours. Hannah stiffened herself. \u201cNo,\u201d she told the cat. \u201cWe have had the talk.\u201d\n\nThe cat looked wounded and sauntered off, tail like a question mark. The hall smelled faintly of paint because her neighbour upstairs was forever \u201cdoing up\u201d something. She had once knocked and asked what he was doing and he\u2019d told her it was \u201csoundproofing,\u201d which made her wonder what he had previously done that had made so much sound. She had received no further details and tried hard not to need any.\n\nHer mum phoned while she was cooking. She put her on speaker and stirred onions until they were transparent. June Flint had the voice of a woman who had been heard once and wanted to be heard again forever, but kindly, the way an old radio station\u2019s voice can be kind. June had worked in the library until it closed, then at the petrol station until they built a self-serve, and now she worked in a charity shop on the High Street two days a week, and knew most of the town\u2019s gossip without trying for it.\n\n\u201cYou at home?\u201d June said. \u201cOr are you out being a night hawk?\u201d\n\n\u201cI am cooking linguine,\u201d Hannah said. \u201cAnd if I call the dish that, it feels fancier than this thing with onions and a carrot and anxiety.\u201d\n\n\u201cLinguine is always linguistic,\u201d June said, happy. \u201cGuess who came into the shop today.\u201d\n\n\u201cMargaret who thinks the Council is a conspiracy?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, that\u2019s Wednesdays. Today, that man who runs the pier caf\u00e9. He said you made them all cry last Friday. And Janet brought a cake she\u2019d made from scratch, and he said they opened the back doors and let the sea join in. He said you made the room feel like it was a church.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat sounds like it violates several health codes,\u201d Hannah said, but she felt the words punch her, gently, in the sternum. \u201cYou were always good at getting people to exaggerate.\u201d\n\n\u201cI never exaggerate,\u201d June said, in the tone of someone who exaggerates for a living. \u201cYou were exceptional. I wish your father had\u2014well, never mind. I wish he had been the sort of man who liked to hear things that were beautiful.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s not,\u201d Hannah said, softly. She did not often say his name. It was like someone had folded it into a paper airplane and thrown it out to sea, and sometimes, on stormy days, felt like it might blow back in.\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d June said, pivoting. \u201cBut Hannah. Have you thought of applying? For that show. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s on the telly or on the computer these days. Britain\u2019s, you know, talent. You have talent.\u201d\n\nShe laughed, but quietly, like somebody told a joke at a funeral. \u201cEverybody in town has this conspiracy. I am being pushed. Is there a newsletter?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s called we want you to be happy,\u201d June said, and the way she said it made the room colder and warmer at once. Hannah turned the heat down under the saucepan, and rubbed her temple. The cat, which had circled back, screamed at her window as if in sympathy.\n\n\u201cStop it,\u201d she told the cat. \u201cI can\u2019t be bullied by mammals.\u201d\n\nAfter dinner, she sat on the floor with her laptop and watched videos. Endless, slick, ridiculous, gorgeous videos of people doing things that made the hair on her arms stand up: tap dancing, a violin that sounded like a person singing with their whole chest, a child standing there small as a biscuit and suddenly sounding like an avalanche. She watched the judges. The sighs. The stage lights that looked like the inside of an eyelid when you closed your eyes too quick. The big gold confetti moment, that blast of manufactured joy that nevertheless looked, at the end of it, oddly real. She watched and felt every hamstring in her body tighten. The very idea of stepping in front of all that and offering herself.\n\nShe registered on the site. There was a form. Of course there was a form. Name, age, occupation, location. A space to write about herself. She wrote: I teach English to the best and most terrifying people in Dover. I sing when they\u2019re not looking. She erased it. She wrote: I grew up on the cliff side of town. My mum sings in the kitchen and the gulls are drunk on the bins by the bus stop and none of it has ever stopped me wanting to make a noise that doesn\u2019t go away. She erased it.\n\nRubbish. All of it too earnest or too odd. She typed: Teacher. Dover. Hannah Flint. Off we go. And clicked save before she could decide it was wrong.\n\nIt wanted a video. Of course it did. She stood up, because sitting down, somehow, felt too serious. She set her phone up against a pile of books. The phone slid. She propped it with a mug. The mug held. She opened the window to let air in and Dover came in whole, car by car, shout by shout, the key noise of the town like someone rattling a tin of screws forever. She shut the window again. She took it seriously then: put the phone on airplane mode, ran her hands through her hair like that would fix hair. It didn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cHello,\u201d she told the camera. \u201cI\u2019m Hannah from Dover, I\u2019m an English teacher, and I would like to sing for you.\u201d It sounded ridiculous as soon as she said it, her own voice sliding away from her like a thing let go. She stopped the recording. She paced. She pressed record again and didn\u2019t say anything this time, just stood there, air-doing the piano introduction, then the song came as if she were hearing it through a wall. She sang it as if somebody needed it right now.\n\nWhat she had always loved were the songs that sounded like sea shanties even when they weren\u2019t; songs that had come, unhurried, through generations and wind and small kitchens with roller blinds, and only got more themselves as they went. She sang the one she\u2019d sung at the Mariner. She stood in the small light of her lamp and lifted the corners of the words and the room did what rooms do when they were given something to respond to\u2014it waited.\n\nHalfway through, the cat leapt into frame and landed with a disgraceful noise. Hannah soldiered on, because what else. When she finished, she had to laugh. The cat blinked as if having accomplished something important. \u201cA duet,\u201d Hannah whispered, breath streaked with relief. The phone stopped recording a second later. She watched herself back once, not because she liked it\u2014she always looked like she was trying not to look like she was looking at anything\u2014but because she needed to make sure the sound was bearable and that the cat had not knocked the phone flat.\n\nThere was a tremor in her jaw she hadn\u2019t known about. She hated that. She loved that. It meant she was paying attention. She uploaded.\n\nThe site bar crept along like a snail with a heavy backpack. She made tea and gave the fish a little midnight snack and wiped the kitchen counters like an apology for all the seconds that had passed without her noticing. When the bar turned green and the page declared, cheerily, Thank you! one of her hands was actually shaking, which was a clich\u00e9, which she hated, which she forgave.\n\nShe dreamed about it that night, in the ridiculous, television-sized way of it: confetti in her hair, her mother sitting in the front row and clapping with a nervousness that made the clapping look like a heartbeat. Mr. Barnes wearing a tie as if it were a flag. The judges vast and frightening like monuments, and the stage smelling of dust and hot electricity. She woke up and laughed in the dark. She went to the bathroom, drank water, stood at the window looking out at the part of Dover that always slept and the part that never did. The ferry horns gave off a mournful shape of sound that seemed to slow her breathing.\n\nThe email came three days later. It wasn\u2019t dramatic; there was no trumpet. It was subject-lined in the modern, airy fashion: Next steps: Your Britain\u2019s Got Talent application. It sat there in her inbox like something that might burst or be a dud, and for a long moment she didn\u2019t open it. She walked around her living room with her hands on her hips like somebody hunting for scissors. She sat. She stood. She opened it.\n\nWe loved your video, it said. Come to the audition in London. It gave a date. It gave a time. She made a noise that would have, had her door been open, sent cats from three streets over sprinting to her. She laughed to herself with her hand over her mouth, as if there was anyone to hear. She sat down very carefully. She texted one person, and that person was her mother.\n\nAudition, it read. London. It\u2019s happening.\n\nWithin seconds, June rang. \u201cI knew it,\u201d her mother said, triumphant and breathless. \u201cHannah. Oh my heart. Oh my girl. You\u2019ll wear that dress, won\u2019t you. The green one.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll wear whatever on the day is clean and doesn\u2019t make me look like a lampshade,\u201d Hannah said, crying and not minding that she was crying. She was quiet about it, so as not to frighten the joy away. \u201cI haven\u2019t told the school yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe school will throw a parade,\u201d June said. \u201cAnd I will wave at it from exactly this sofa and then attend with a banner. Do you want me to come to London with you?\u201d\n\nShe thought about her mother in that big, busy building with all the noise and waiting and vending machines and never enough seats, about the way June\u2019s knee had started to tell its own long weather. \u201cMaybe not,\u201d she said, love nudging at her throat. \u201cI think I\u2019ll go alone. That way if I fall over with nerves, there will be nobody there to see.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, you,\u201d June said softly. \u201cThere\u2019ll be thousands to see. And not one of them will mind, if they\u2019re your people. I\u2019m proud of you.\u201d\n\nThat day at school, news travelled through the teachers\u2019 wing like steam. She didn\u2019t say it loud; she told Mr. Barnes in his office and he came up out of his chair like a spring, then he told Mr. Shaw in the corridor and Mr. Shaw actually clapped like a seal and called out across the stairwell, and then Ms. Davis stormed into the shared planning space and demanded to know why she had to hear about these things third hand, and then at break there was a cake, because if there was one thing schools could do still, it was a cake, even if it was marked \u201cCongratulations Hannnah\u201d with an extra n that she immediately grew weirdly fond of.\n\nThe students smelled news within a lesson. Some of them had already found a clip of her online from the Mariner; one had set it to a filter that gave her rabbit ears. She pretended to be outraged. She wasn\u2019t outraged. She had never felt more seen by people she hadn\u2019t been trying to be seen by.\n\n\u201cMiss,\u201d Noah said, the second his bag touched his desk. \u201cMiss. Miss. If you win, are you going to leave us?\u201d\n\n\u201cAm I going to leave you if I win fame, fortune, and a probable hovercraft?\u201d she said, deadpan. \u201cHow dare you ask me such things in this house. We only talk about Macbeth in this house.\u201d\n\n\u201cSeriously,\u201d Safia said. \u201cAre you going to forget us when you\u2019re famous? Big Headline: Dover Teacher Abandons Children For Glitter.\u201d\n\n\u201cI could never abandon glitter,\u201d Hannah said. Then she softened. \u201cI\u2019m not going to forget anybody. I\u2019m going to go and sing and then I\u2019m going to come back and mark your homework and tell you to stop tapping your pens.\u201d\n\nThey both grinned at that. It anchored them all.\n\nTwo days before the audition, after school, she stood in the music room where Mr. Sands, who was a closed door pretending to be open, let her in to practice. It was odd being in there; she felt like she was wearing someone else\u2019s shirt, the collar too wide and the cuffs dipping over her hands. The room smelled of polish and old pianos and the particular tang of teenage nerves that had been left behind like a vapor. She warmed up, then sang the song twice through in a voice that felt both like her own and remote, like a letter she recognized but couldn\u2019t place.\n\nMr. Sands listened once through a split of his door like a butler. \u201cYou know,\u201d he said finally, \u201cyou have the timing of a person who knows how to be quiet, which is rarer than most think.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs that good?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is when you choose when to break it. Break it exactly then.\u201d He marked the bar in the air with a pencil, and she felt, for the first time, the proper shape of the song under her feet, the way some singers talk about it, not like stepping onto a stage, but like stepping onto a boat that had already decided where it would take you. She thanked him and he went, because he was good at going.\n\nOn the way home she bought a green dress in a shop none of the students went to, because it was where people their age went to die of boredom. The dress was not the green her mother meant; it was paler and softer, a green you might find buried in the color of a bottle left too long in the sea. She folded it into her bag as if it might speak too loud if she carried it openly.\n\nAt home, Gal was in a mood. She\u2019d come to recognize them. The other fish gave him room the way the rest of the world gives room to a small man with a loud voice on public transport\u2014not fear, just a gentle sliding away. He did his reflection routine three times, then broke off suddenly as if offended by how good he looked. She tap-tapped the glass once with her nail and he flared at her, offended.\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re all on our very best behavior, then. Good.\u201d\n\nShe barely slept the night before London. When she did, she dreamed she was in front of the judges and instead of singing she could only recite the Year 9 reading list, \u201cOf Mice and Men\u201d coming out in a high, trembling soprano, \u201cAn Inspector Calls\u201d in a weeping whisper, and the audience, bless them, smiled politely as if this were what they had paid for and weren\u2019t quite sure why.\n\nShe woke in the grey, the morning not yet committed to being what it was. She made toast and ate half of it and left the other half for the cat who did not belong to her, who appeared as if conjured, sniffed the toast as if insulted, and walked off with great energy. She put on the dress. She looked at herself in the mirror and saw someone who had forgotten how to comb properly and remembered, at the last second, how to stand. She rolled her shoulders. She picked up her bag.\n\nOn the train, she sat in one of those seats with a little table, and across from her a man hid inside a newspaper as if war might break out and he needed to be there first. Two teenage girls slid into the seats beside her, chewing something that smelled like watermelon and chemicals, talking at the same time as if their words would collide and that was fine. One of them glanced at Hannah\u2019s hair, at her dress, at the way she kept her hands on her knees like she needed to keep her knees from floating away, and said, kindly, \u201cAre you having a day?\u201d\n\n\u201cA small one,\u201d Hannah said.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got this,\u201d the girl said, as if seeing not a day but the whole of a life through the window. She went back to telling her friend about a cat in a video that had jumped onto a man\u2019s head, and the laughter of the two of them together felt like a protection spell. Hannah breathed. The train went into a tunnel and came out the other side, and the world had a different shade of green.\n\nLondon was so many people it felt like a mistake. She followed signs that did not seem to have anything to do with her, and then they did. She collected a badge. She was called a \u201ccontestant\u201d by someone with a clipboard, which made her want to flee into a hedge. She sat with other people who were good at other things: a group in matching tracksuits whose bodies looked as if they might be able to flip without warning, a woman with a dog that had an expression of profound philosophical interest, a man with a violin case that he touched with the care of a newborn\u2019s head.\n\nShe did not talk to anyone for a while. She held her cup of water and watched a television in the corner show people doing what they had come here to do. Her name was called. It wasn\u2019t her name at first. It was a number on a list, and then it was her name. Hannah Flint. She stood up and she walked along the corridor where the carpet changed from blue to black as if the building itself knew she was going through something. A woman with a headset smiled at her and performed the same smile she had performed for a hundred players today, and it didn\u2019t matter\u2014it worked on her anyway. The stage door was a mouth. The stage itself, when she was finally stood on it, was a town square. The lights were a weather all their own.\n\nShe saw the judges, their collective familiarity doing that trick where it felt as if you knew them, deeply, because you knew the shape of their eyebrows when they heard something they did not expect. She saw beyond them, the shadowed arms of the audience, the black glittering mass of it, the heartbeat of a thousand strangers. It could break you, she thought suddenly, and then: I am not asking it to.\n\nThey asked her questions. The usual. She answered the usual. Teacher, yes. Dover, yes. An English teacher. You teach Macbeth? A laugh broke out, one of the judges making a joke about a curse and she smiled in the right places. She held the microphone in both hands. She had practiced standing like a person who knew what to do with their arms. She did not yet know. That was okay, she told herself. That was okay.\n\n\u201cOff you go,\u201d one of them said kindly, as if letting her out into a garden.\n\nShe nodded once. She did not look back. Somewhere in the building, somebody dropped something heavy. The stage had its own gravity. She started the song.\n\nThat first line went up into the rafters and came back down and hit her in the chest. She nearly laughed at the oddness of it, how her own voice could feel like a boomerang. But then the second line found its feet. The third line knew exactly where to set its cup down. By the third verse, if you could call them verses, she had stopped seeing anything but what was just ahead of her\u2014the next word, and the word after, and the little lift into the vowel there that Mr. Sands had described with his pencil in the air. She did the thing he had told her: she broke the quiet exactly then and then found it again and people in the audience did that involuntary thing, the small sound that you can\u2019t repress when someone meets you where you live.\n\nWhen she finished, there was a pause that was either horror or grace. Then the room came back on, light and hot, in relief. She smiled because that\u2019s what you do when you can\u2019t think of whether to smile or cry. Someone stood up in the judges\u2019 row. Someone else put their hand over their mouth the way she had done in her living room. She heard someone on the edge of the stage say \u201cYes\u201d in a whisper, just to themselves. The applause came in waves, and the first wave carried her toward shore and the second wave dunked her and the third wave handed her back, laughing, to herself.\n\nThe judges spoke. They were kind. They were not all kind in the same way. One compared her voice to \u201ca thing that knows the difference between a funeral and a hurricane.\u201d Another said she\u2019d never heard a teacher like that before, which was a nice way of saying teachers were held in a particular box, and she had opened the lid. There was a joke about the fish when she mentioned the tank in her classroom. It turned into an odd, wide conversation about empathy and small ecosystems and children learning to be human. She forgot almost immediately exactly what she had said because her body was doing that thing bodies do when adrenaline is both a gift and a curse.\n\nThey gave her four yeses. It was the kind of sentence she had heard on television a hundred times and not felt, and now it pinned her to herself kindly. She felt very plainly that she would go back to Dover and teach again next week, and also that she had stepped into a place in her own voice that she could not step back out of.\n\nWhen she got back on the train, her phone filled with texts and messages and the quick bright burst of a new reality. She read some. She put the phone face-down when it was too much. Across from her, a boy played on his handheld console and made a face like thunder and his dad said gently, \u201cNo melting, mate,\u201d and the boy said, \u201cI\u2019m not melting,\u201d with pride, and did the small breathing trick his dad showed him. Hannah learned the trick simply by being there. She did it too, and smiled out the window at the grey coming on.\n\nIn the classroom the next day, the fish were fine. Gal, for once, seemed contrite. She fed them. The students filed in with the good gossip eyes, and she let them gossip for a bit because they were children and she had become a kind of news. Later they read a poem by Heaney about feeling the weight of what you are good at and also the weight of not doing it. They didn\u2019t relish Heaney like she did, but they saw a line that was theirs, and marked it.\n\nAt lunchtime, Mr. Barnes called a meeting in the hall and announced her audition success like the unveiling of a satellite. There were photos. She hated it; she loved it. On her way back to her room, she saw the science lab door ajar and Mr. Shaw hunched over a tank twice the size of hers. He was doing triage on a snail who had crawled upside down for too long and looked exhausted by it.\n\n\u201cThis is my life now,\u201d he said, without self-pity. \u201cGive me a day at sea and six non-moronic teenagers any time.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can offer you fifteen adolescents and a morally complex guppy,\u201d she said.\n\nHe looked up. \u201cHe does look\u2026 what\u2019s the word?\u201d\n\n\u201cPeeved.\u201d\n\n\u201cAggrieved.\u201d\n\n\u201cAngry,\u201d she said, and heard how it sounded in her own mouth: angry guppy. A stupid, comic phrase to say out loud in a day that felt like it deserved better. She laughed at herself for laughing. \u201cHe is, though. I swear he holds grudges.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey say fish forget in five seconds,\u201d Mr. Shaw said, then leaned down to whisper to the snail as if it could hear him and it mattered. \u201cI don\u2019t believe them.\u201d\n\nOn Friday she went back to the Mariner because she had promised herself she would not stop doing the small versions of the thing just because she had done a big version. The bar was warmer than London and smelled strongly of the potato in chips, and the room didn\u2019t care about judges or the right cut of a dress. Maggie, who ran the place, wiped her hands on a towel and hugged her long and hard. \u201cOnly rules still apply,\u201d she said, eyes shocking with brightness. \u201cNo singing \u2018Wonderwall\u2019. No singing, \u2018Hallelujah\u2019 unless you are Leonard Cohen brought back. One free drink if you mention Dover at least once.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll mention Dover three times like Beetlejuice,\u201d Hannah said, and Maggie nodded solemnly like that made mystical sense.\n\nThe first song went well, which is to say it felt like throwing a ball to a friend a small distance away on a day when your feet kept on solid earth. She didn\u2019t look at people\u2019s faces. She looked just above them, at the framed photo of the cliffs. The second song went better, like a ball that knew its own arc. In the gap between one and two she saw a man at the bar point at his phone and mouth to his mate, That\u2019s her, and then look at her like she might not be and then like she was real anyway.\n\nSomewhere near the top of the weekend, she got an email that said Please do not share any program details (it was all capitals and felt like being told to keep someone\u2019s eyes safe). She didn\u2019t, because even if she had been tempted, she had never been a person who could keep up with one secret and a life at the same time. Still, things moved under the surface. She got a call from a person with a voice like a very confident robot who said words like schedule, risk assessment, wardrobe. She learned she would come back soon, that there were further rounds, that maybe, if she didn\u2019t drop the ball and the ball didn\u2019t suddenly become, say, a cat, she could be on the telly proper.\n\nBetween hanging up and making another cup of tea, she felt that odd, split feeling people in old stories must have felt when a ship was due and you couldn\u2019t see it yet, just a darker line on the horizon.\n\nMonday came and went, and so did Tuesday, and the fish did small fish things that felt important to them, and the children did small human things that felt important to her, and late one afternoon, when the sun made a rectangle on her classrooms carpet like a stage she would never step on, because floors were floors and you could not be asked to be a bigger giant than you were, Safia stood by the fish with a frown.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s giving me drama,\u201d she said, meaning Gal, who had puffed himself up to twice his arrogance.\n\n\u201cHe gives everyone drama,\u201d Hannah said. \u201cHe\u2019s a fish with an ego. We forgive him the way we forgive each other.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf he nips my finger I\u2019m telling my mum,\u201d Safia said, delighted to have something silly to say in a week of serious things. She did not put a finger in the tank. Nobody did. The tank hummed its patient hum, the sort of noise that keeps you in this world when your mind tries to go somewhere else.\n\nHannah tidied, set the chairs on top of the desks to make the cleaners love her, and turned out the light. In the part-shadow, the fish glowed in their separate way. She stood a while longer, listening to what a room listened to after everyone had left it. Then she went home, walking the long way, past the place where the road gave way to the path to the cliff. The wind picked at her hair, and she let it.\n\nAt home, she opened the window. The cat arrived within minutes, not surprised to find herself welcome in a house whose owner kept saying no. She placed a saucer on the floor because habits are louder than rules. On the telly, people were also singing. It looked smaller when it wasn\u2019t your stage. It looked like something anyone could do, which was the program\u2019s great trick and also what made it tender.\n\nShe turned it off. She drank her tea. She smiled at the darkness gathering like it always had, no matter what theatrics any of them were doing at the other end of the line. She tucked herself into bed and, for once, fell like a dropped coin into sleep. Outside, the sea went on, not caring if she had said \u201cYes\u201d or if anyone had said it back. It kept on doing what it did. She took comfort in that.\n\nIn the morning, the first thing she did\u2014before even making tea\u2014was feed the fish. Gal came up as if ready to negotiate a treaty and then, last second, darted away from a mirrored ghost of himself. Even fish, she thought, had versions of themselves they were frightened of. She tapped the glass very gently, and it made a sound like a small bell. Gal came back, greedy, alive, certain as anything of his small kingdom.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t get ideas,\u201d she told him. \u201cYou and me both.\u201d She dropped a pinch of flake in and he snapped it like a secret. She laughed, at herself, at him, at the week, at the thing she had set in motion without knowing exactly where it would take her.\n\nThat afternoon, between helping a boy write a sentence with fewer commas and convincing a girl that the best way to show she was smart was not always to talk loudly, she got another email. Not hugs this time. Not London. Not schedules. Just a line that made her heart go sideways before it steadied. A change in the shape of what was next.\n\nWe\u2019re making some adjustments to the live shows, it said. Unlikely, but possible, that due to a situation beyond our control, you may be moved forward if a slot opens. We appreciate your flexibility.\n\nShe read it twice. She did not know exactly what it meant. She did know what it felt like, to be told that she might be shoved into a place she wasn\u2019t expecting to be yet. She stood in the doorway of her classroom and watched her students pack their bags and shout again and run for their buses, and thought: whatever happens, happens to the part of me that can breathe on a stage, not the part that knows what Noah needs when he\u2019s trying not to be seen.\n\nOn her way out, she said to Gal, \u201cBig changes,\u201d and he flared as if in agreement. She rolled her eyes at herself. She turned off the light, and the glow in the tank went from gold to black and back again as the small engine kept on. Filtering, cleansing, making a small world make sense. She left the room and shut the door on that private weather, holding the banister like a steadying hand as she went down into the evening that waited for her, down in the hall, beyond the door, into Dover, walking squarely into whatever wind there was.Wednesday began with a siren that wasn\u2019t a siren, just the kettle remembering how to shout. Outside, the seafront was still trying to decide whether to be blue or grey, and the gulls were in their morning parliament, grey-suited and outrageously confident. Hannah poured the water and watched tea happen the way weather happens\u2014quietly and then all at once. The email from the night before might as well have been taped to the inside of her skull. Adjustments. Slot opens. Flexibility appreciated. She\u2019d read it, rolled it around on her tongue as if it were a sweet with a bitter centre, and then she\u2019d slept anyway, because sleep was one of the few things she could still do without permission. Now the day stood there, new and ordinary, and she was supposed to be both.\n\nShe arrived early at school to mark three essays before anyone else put their noise in the corridor. In the tank, Gal was arranging the morning in the precise, imperfect way he preferred. He chased a tetra half-heartedly, then went to survey his own reflection and quivered in a way that would have been comic if it didn\u2019t look so much like an argument with the self. \u201cAll right,\u201d she told him, one hand on the glass, performing the ritual of greeting like it mattered. \u201cI understand. I\u2019m also frighteningly good-looking and that is my burden.\u201d He angled, flared, darted. When she sprinkled the flakes he shot up through them as if trying to catch weather.\n\nBy the second bell the corridor was tinny with laughter, and she was already braced for Noah to ask a question that sounded like a philosophy minor had got lost in an English classroom. He didn\u2019t disappoint. \u201cMiss,\u201d he appeared at her elbow, hair doing something architectural, a smear of something on his sleeve that better not be jam. \u201cIf ambition wrecks Macbeth, and if ambition also gets you a life, where\u2019s the line? Because you always tell us there\u2019s a line. That\u2019s like your whole thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy whole thing,\u201d she said, \u201cis \u2018use your commas sparingly\u2019 and \u2018wash your hands after the loo.\u2019 And then, maybe, then, ambition. The line is where it stops belonging to you and starts belonging to hurting other people.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not a line,\u201d he objected, but he smiled when he said it. He saw the fish the way he saw everything, in glances and leaps. \u201cGal looks a bit weird.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe looks like himself,\u201d she said. \u201cWhich is exhausting enough.\u201d\n\nMid-morning, the headteacher\u2019s voice rose over the staffroom like a trumpet done quietly. Mr. Barnes had a way of delivering news that made it feel like you were all in the same boat, even if the boat was sinking. \u201cHannah,\u201d he said when she stepped in, having been paged over the dodgy speaker system that cut out on the word \u201curgent\u201d and replaced it with a noise like a door being kicked. \u201cHow are your nerves?\u201d\n\n\u201cServiceable,\u201d she said. \u201cWe talking general or specific?\u201d\n\n\u201cSpecific. You\u2019ve had something from the programme?\u201d\n\nShe nodded, holding out her phone so he could see the email, because she had not yet learned how to pretend she did not want a witness to everything. Mr. Shaw leaned over Mr. Barnes\u2019 shoulder, porridge, incredibly, already redeemed into a fresh tie, like a man who believed in second breakfasts.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re asking if you can shift,\u201d Mr. Barnes said, reading. \u201cMove up if someone drops, so to speak. Could happen, might not happen. And if it happens, it sounds like very short notice, doesn\u2019t it. Of course it does.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat day is short notice in television?\u201d Mr. Shaw said, hauling a chair over to sit and fully commit to the conversation. \u201cThey could call you while you\u2019re on the loo and expect you to belt it out over the hand dryer.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hate this image,\u201d Ms. Davis said from the corner without looking up. \u201cAlso, I\u2019ve thought about it and we will have to organise cover. Look at this timetable.\u201d She slid Hannah\u2019s key lessons across the table like a deck of cards she could read. \u201cYear 11 mock feedback Friday. Parents\u2019 evening Thursday.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can move parents\u2019 evening,\u201d Mr. Barnes said, like a magician disappointed nobody appreciated the trick. \u201cI\u2019ll call it a climate event. We\u2019ll evacuate them into next week. It\u2019s fine.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt isn't,\u201d Hannah said, and heard the smallness in her own voice and immediately wanted to make it more generous. \u201cBut thank you. I\u2019m worried about leaving them mid-battle. Macbeth\u2019s in the witches.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll still be in the witches when you get back,\u201d Mr. Shaw said. \u201cThe witches are patient. You\u2019re allowed to go and do something that is for you. We will mind your children. We will not feed Gal. I cannot stress this enough.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou fed them once,\u201d she said. \u201cThey still talk about it.\u201d\n\nHe winced. \u201cI misread the tub. In my defence, the tub was very mislabeled.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot at all,\u201d Ms. Davis said, because she couldn\u2019t resist. \u201cIt said fish food.\u201d\n\nThey were ridiculous and they were a family of sorts. She felt the warm swill of being protected and wanted to resist it because protection sometimes came with obligations she couldn\u2019t pay back. Mr. Barnes landed the plane, as he did. \u201cIf they call,\u201d he said, \u201cwe\u2019ll arrange cover. You\u2019ll go. We\u2019ll be proud and grumble and send you texts. You will come back. I\u2019ve been here long enough to know how this works.\u201d\n\nShe kept her phone face down during Period 3 in case the call made her heart do something visible. Period 4 it vibrated anyway and she let the students get on with their writing while she stepped into the corridor and looked at the number as if she might be able to change it by will. Unknown. Of course. A woman with a pleasant, brisk voice introduced herself and told Hannah, delightfully, that everything was either fine or very much not fine.\n\n\u201cSo, we\u2019ve had a\u2026 situation,\u201d the woman said, with the bright glide of someone who wore a lanyard shaped like a shield. \u201cA group can\u2019t perform due to a travel issue. We are shuffling. There is a possibility\u2014and I stress possibility\u2014you might go in their place. It would be this Sunday. That gives you\u2026\u201d Hannah heard tapping and imagined a schedule falling down a set of stairs. \u201cIt gives you three days. We would want you Saturday for rehearsal.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 yes,\u201d Hannah said, and then because she had taught herself to be specific in a crisis, added, \u201cI am a teacher. I have parents\u2019 evening Thursday and mocks Friday. I can rehearse on Saturday. I can be in London Sunday. I will be underprepared Thursday and somehow more prepared Sunday.\u201d\n\n\u201cBrilliant,\u201d the woman said, genuinely sounding like it was. \u201cWe\u2019ll have our musical director call you to talk about arrangements. The folk piece you did\u2014we loved it, the EP loved it\u2014but the live show we might want to add texture. Something that grows. Strings, maybe a bodhr\u00e1n, something that is not dreadful. We don\u2019t do dreadful. I\u2019ll email. Oh, and media. We\u2019ll manage your press. Don\u2019t announce. Not yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot announcing is my strongest skill,\u201d Hannah said, then hung up and stood very still in the corridor and listened to the heavy breathing of the building\u2014the pipes, the ancient radiators, the stampede of Year 8s somewhere above. Her pulse felt like the sea at spring tide. She wanted to sit down but there was nowhere to sit that didn\u2019t look like a child had once cried there.\n\nIn her classroom, the students had performed a miracle. They had written quietly for two whole minutes while she was gone because she had asked them to. Safia looked up when she came in and tilted her head. \u201cYou okay, Miss?\u201d\n\n\u201cI am very okay,\u201d she said, and meant it and didn\u2019t. \u201cI am a person who will need to drink water and breathe, which are both free, and then I will be okay. Commas. Who needs me with commas?\u201d\n\nThat afternoon, while the others went to the car park to argue about whose mother was worse, she found Mr. Sands in the music room and told him what she could tell. He nodded like an old metronome. \u201cYou\u2019ll want to pick something you can lean on if the floor moves,\u201d he said. \u201cThe floor will move. It won\u2019t be the end of the world; it\u2019ll feel like it is. Whatever you pick, it should have a hinge. Somewhere you can rest a second inside it and then open it and go through.\u201d\n\nHe had a list. Of course he had a list. He was the kind of man who had a list on onion-skin paper. They tried two songs in the dim gold of the room, windows fogged with the ghosts of trumpet lessons. One was too cheerful; it tasted like seaside rock. The other had something in it like salt. She sang, then stopped, then sang again, and the second time, halfway through, there was that hinge he\u2019d promised. She stepped through it and found herself on the other side, in air clearer than she\u2019d had any right to expect. When she was done, he made a small noise like somebody had placed a chess piece exactly where it had always wanted to be. \u201cThat one,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can make the room do what you ask with that one.\u201d\n\nOn the way home she walked past the charity shop on the High Street and stared at the jumble in the window until her own reflection arranged itself into someone she recognised. A coat on a hanger looked like a person waiting to be picked up. June had scrawled on a bit of card for their book table: Two for one, unless I know you\u2019re rich. XXX June. The shop was not open, it was never open at the exact moment when you thought \u201cYes, now,\u201d but she liked the feeling of her mother\u2019s handwriting out there like a flag.\n\nAt home, the cat was a small, sleek alarm. It sat on the doorstep, refusing to move with such determination that the world bent around it. \u201cI will not be owned by this relationship,\u201d Hannah told it, and then let it in anyway because she was what she was. She pulled out her phone and called her mother and managed to say it without making it sound like a storm. June took it like any weather. \u201cRight,\u201d she said, \u201cso I\u2019ll set my telly to record and I\u2019ll put cakes in the freezer because you never know who\u2019ll show up, and I\u2019ll tell Margaret she\u2019s not to come to mine on Sunday to talk about the bins unless it\u2019s an emergency, and if it is an emergency she will bring the bins with her because I won\u2019t miss you.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to watch it live,\u201d Hannah said, trying to be kind and not sure if kindness looked like that. \u201cYou can watch in your own time.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would like to be with you in it while it\u2019s happening, thank you very much,\u201d June said, stout as a lighthouse. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be brave for me. Be brave for the girl who loved songs. I\u2019ll mop up after her if she cries.\u201d She said it like a pact. Then, because she was also the sort of mother who knew about knees and weather, she added, \u201cI went up the stairs at the shop today and my left knee told me the truth, which is that it is well past its best and would like to be replaced with something titanium and glamorous. I am telling you this to remind you that bodies are both miracles and liars. Eat a potato.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to London, not the trenches,\u201d Hannah said, but she found herself putting actual butter on a potato later and eating it like a person who believed in fuel.\n\nThursday she stood for three hours under strip lights while parents told her everything and nothing and she told them that their children were trying and brilliant and complicated and that she was very proud to be in their lives. She meant it down to the marrow. She meant it even about the ones who had made her want to throw a thesaurus out of a window. Noah\u2019s mother wore a coat that made her look like a saffron; she shook Hannah\u2019s hand hard enough to make the skin of her palm ache. \u201cHe says you\u2019re good,\u201d she said. \u201cHe says you see him. That\u2019ll do me.\u201d\n\nSafia\u2019s father did a strict nod like a folded piece of paper and said, \u201cPlease keep her busy. She talks less when she has to read.\u201d Safia rolled her eyes and looked away and then looked back and mouthed, \u201cThank you,\u201d like a tiny revolution.\n\nIt was after the last parent had gone and the custard creams had been beaten into dust that she went back to her classroom to turn off the lamp and found Gal not right. It took her a second. Fish were always doing something that looked like nothing and vice versa. He hovered in the corner like an idea that hadn\u2019t decided whether it would be good. When he flicked, the tails of his fins looked ragged, as if he\u2019d gone through a small, personal storm. The lamp made his colours too clear. She knelt, very gently the way people talk to babies and gods, and watched. He darted. He did not dart as he usually darted. He didn\u2019t posture at himself, which might have had you calling emergency services.\n\nShe found Mr. Shaw packing his bag with the look of a man who had not stopped moving since 1999. \u201cMy fish,\u201d she said, and he took one look at her and put the bag back down.\n\n\u201cDescribe your fish,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cRuffled,\u201d she said, aware it wasn\u2019t the science word. \u201cTired. Like me,\u201d she added, to forestall the joke.\n\n\u201cCould be fin rot,\u201d he said. \u201cOr stress. Or his own personality biting him, which can happen. I\u2019ll look.\u201d He bent to the tank and squinted like he was reading a poem written very small. \u201cHe\u2019s frayed. You need to keep the water extra clean. No overfeeding. Bit of aquarium salt if you\u2019ve got it, very small amount. Turn down the light. Pretend you are a spa, not a disco.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never been a disco,\u201d she said, solution and worry fighting like cats behind her ribs. \u201cWill he be okay?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a guppy,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re tougher than they look. But they\u2019re not immortal. None of us are. Which is annoying when you\u2019ve got a weekend like yours.\u201d He put a hand on her shoulder, which he did rarely enough that she felt it as a blessing. \u201cGo to London. I\u2019ll check on them Saturday. I promise not to feed them.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will positively not feed them,\u201d she said, because rituals mattered. \u201cAnd if he\u2019s gone when I come back, I will pretend to handle it and then cry in a cupboard.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can cry in my cupboard,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has a chair and a poster of Marie Curie.\u201d\n\nFriday was the kind of day schools specialise in. A fire alarm. A debate in the corridor about whether a bacon sandwich was morally wrong. A girl with a headache the size of France. Hannah stood in the middle of it with her hands open and let it happen and did what you do when you don\u2019t get to control anything: you controlled the controllables. She photocopied. She left a folder for her cover teacher labelled in a way that would make it impossible for anyone to say they didn\u2019t know what to do. She put sticky notes on the fish food. She wrote a silly, stern note and stuck it over the tank: I\u2019m watching you. Be civil. She resisted the urge to sign it \u201cLove, God.\u201d\n\nIn the afternoon she got fifteen minutes with Mr. Sands, a piano, and the song that had chosen her. They flipped it inside out. They took bars away and put them back. It felt like turning up the collar of a coat and finding someone else\u2019s name stitched in and deciding to leave it there. He made a face at the phrase they knew had to lift, and she lifted it until the ceiling noticed. When she finished, he didn\u2019t clap. He put his hand flat on the piano as if to steady it. \u201cDon\u2019t let them hurry you,\u201d he said, noting the places where the years had made him kind instead of brittle. \u201cYou go in with your own weather.\u201d\n\nSaturday early, she took the train to London with a bag that made her feel like she was moving cottages. She had never been to television rehearsals, but she had read a lot of books and seen enough behind-the-scenes content to walk in as if she could identify a gaffer in the wild. The building they used as a base looked like a very expensive car park. Inside, everything was polished and unfinished at once, wires like vines, walls that were both temporary and permanent, people with headsets moving in the purposeful way people moved when they had been told not to let things go wrong.\n\nThere was a room labeled Contestants which made her laugh because she kept forgetting she was one. Inside it, a group of boys were drumming on their thighs, a woman with hair like a bird of paradise was quietly humming scales, and a man with a face your grandparents would trust was oiling his violin bow the way some people pat a horse before they ride it. The dog was there, too, the philosophical one, gazing at a tin bowl as if it contained the secrets of the universe and perhaps it did.\n\nThey put her in front of a camera with a young man who asked questions in a voice like a smile. He asked why she taught. He asked why she sang. She answered the same answer two different ways because that\u2019s what the truth looks like when you turn it. The producer with the bright voice from the phone had a body to go with it and a clipboard you could probably have used as shelter in a storm. \u201cWe\u2019ll try strings,\u201d she said to Hannah, her pen clicking like a clock. \u201cWe have this arrangement we can build from. Our MD is a genius disguised as a person. Don\u2019t panic. If we panic you\u2019ll know because we all start walking faster and you will feel it like a tide.\u201d\n\nThey went through it with the band in a half-lit space that made everything feel like dressing up. The first run was too polite. The second found its bones. The third made the hair on her arms stand up like wheat. The MD, who had the face of someone who could hear sketches of Bach in a printer, tapped the stand and said, pleased, \u201cThere. Again from there.\u201d The strings lifted like a breath, a drum came in under them with the patience of someone walking alongside someone else who could not walk fast. She held the microphone in both hands because there was nowhere else to put the need, and sang, and for a second she saw Dover behind the blackness of the room. She saw the cliffs and the classroom and her mother\u2019s hands tapping the steering wheel in time when she drove her to primary school, one finger, then another, then the whole hand, with the radio or with the song in her head, whatever was playing that day.\n\nBetween the rehearsals, she sat with the drumming boys and talked about nothing that was actually nothing: chips, trainers, the way London air tasted like a coin. One of them said, \u201cYou don\u2019t seem scared,\u201d a statement rather than a question, and she laughed without laughing, which was a skill she\u2019d honed. \u201cI am very good at both being scared and holding tea without spilling,\u201d she said. He nodded as if this were an ancient art and was proud to know its name.\n\nThen, because all stories contain a piece you didn\u2019t ask for, her phone buzzed and it was the charity shop, or rather, Dorothy from the charity shop, who did not believe in preambles. \u201cYour mother\u2019s all right,\u201d Dorothy announced. \u201cBefore you get in a state. She slipped on a black plastic bag some idiot left on the floor. Sat down hard. I told her she\u2019d done it wrong if she meant to be graceful. Knee\u2019s protesting. We\u2019ve iced it. She will sit for two hours because I told her she would and because she cannot get up without me and that is how I like my friends, occasionally captive. She says not to ring. I am ringing because after two hours she will pretend nothing happened. Don\u2019t come. If you come, I\u2019ll hide you in the racks because Margaret will be here and she\u2019ll only try to adopt you.\u201d\n\nHannah leaned back against a wall that might have been a set and closed her eyes because sometimes that made the world tilt back into place. \u201cThank you,\u201d she said. \u201cTell her I love her, and I will come after, and I will bring something inappropriate from the supermarket and a determination to make her sit with her leg up.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll make sure she\u2019s clean for your visit,\u201d Dorothy said grandly, as if June were a spaniel that had rolled in something. \u201cGo and be marvellous. We will do the domestic follies. We are very experienced at it.\u201d She hung up without goodbye in the way of women who remembered when phone calls were expensive.\n\nHannah stood there another minute and let herself be someone\u2019s daughter very hard, then put the phone away and went back to rehearsal, because there are only so many choices. The stage manager took them through the walk, the stand, the look-left, the breathe. \u201cFind your mark,\u201d he said to each of them in turn, and there was something childlike and holy about it. Find your mark. As if you were always meant to end up exactly there.\n\nShe went back to Dover that evening because sleeping in a white hotel where the art was framed abstractly would have made her feel like a person in a brochure, and she needed to be a person in a bed with a cat that wasn\u2019t hers. The train had that end-of-day ache that rides home in other people\u2019s faces. A pair of lads argued about whether gravy on chips was universal truth or a personal failing. A woman in a fluorescent vest slept with her mouth open, shrugged into her nap like armour. The cat was waiting as if it had engineered the timetable. It showed her its entire contempt of the universe and then ate what she put down with the focus of a meditator. She texted Dorothy and received a photo of June with a bag of frozen peas on one knee and a grin that was all schoolgirl, and the caption, in Dorothy\u2019s scrawl: Will live. Very annoyed to be alive. Bring cake.\n\nOn Sunday the sea looked like somebody had sanded it. A thin rain had been thrown up and then forgotten. She put on the dress, the one that looked like glass that had learned to be kind. She looked at herself in the mirror and felt poised over the day like a bird over a wave deciding whether to dive. In the kitchen, she wrote a note nobody would see: Feed fish. Breathe. Okay. She left it on the table anyway, like a spell.\n\nThe staging area backstage had become a fairground of nerves. They had a run-sheet with everyone\u2019s name in neat columns and everything about it suggested certainty while everything about it was secretly made of decisions. Someone in a suit jogged past in trainers. A woman in a gold jumpsuit muttered about zips. The dog had a small moment with a polystyrene cup and was redirected kindly. When they miked her, the sound tech said, \u201cYou\u2019ve got a nice voice,\u201d in the flat tone of someone who meant it and had said it to people who didn\u2019t deserve it, which made it feel like a gift.\n\nThen the bit that wasn\u2019t supposed to happen happened, which is that the big voice came over from somewhere in the sky and said her name earlier than it should have. The act before had been cut short for something that sounded important up close and wouldn\u2019t matter at all tomorrow; the song before hers had been all fireworks and she had to walk out into whatever heat was left. The lighting guy, bless him, didn\u2019t meet her eye, because professionals know when looking at you might break you. The stage manager said calmly, \u201cWe\u2019re up,\u201d and touched her elbow exactly once and then let go.\n\nThe first line of the song had to be placed on a table without cracking. She thought of Mr. Sands and his hinge and of Gal with his ragged fin, holding himself slightly differently and still himself. She thought of Noah drawing his dragon in the corner of every page, the same dragon, the same corner, because staking a claim on a corner is sometimes all a growing person can do. She thought of her mother\u2019s knee and the way June would tell it off, bromide-filled peas sweating onto a tea towel, more annoyed than defeated. She thought of Dover cutting the sky cleanly, of the part of the sea that belonged to ferries and the part that belonged to quiet thoughts, and she set the first line down.\n\nWe could say that the rest took care of itself, but that would be letting the work pretend to be a miracle. She did the work. She lifted where she had to and rested where she could and looked at nobody and everybody. The strings held, and when she leaned they took her weight, and the drum beneath her was careful and then not careful, which was exactly what she needed from anyone right then. Something happened in the second verse that wasn\u2019t planned and didn\u2019t matter except that it mattered to her. She heard a sound from the audience that was too small to be clapping and too big to be a breath, a sound like someone finding their own heart in their pocket by accident, and she smiled without meaning to and a camera somewhere caught it. Later, June would text her that that bit made three separate people in the charity shop cry, and Dorothy would reply, only one of them because of haemorrhoids.\n\nAfter, you go and stand somewhere and get told that you did it, as if that sentence can hold anything. The judges said words again and some of them landed and some of them floated off with the confetti. She heard someone say \u201cauthentic,\u201d which is a dangerous word if you let other people own it. She thought: I am the only one who knows why this was real. She looked down and saw that she had been holding the microphone with both hands again and laughed at herself for not learning any faster. The lights warmed her skin and then stopped. She walked off. Someone hugged her. Someone else missed and hugged a piece of air. The gold on everything looked like the inside of a throat.\n\nThere was no confetti because it wasn\u2019t that sort of yes, not yet. There was a different kind of recognition which came from people who had backstage jobs and had seen too much and could tell when a thing had done what it meant to do. A woman with a headset pressed her hand once in a sandwich of hand-and-clipboard and said, \u201cThat\u2019s how we do it,\u201d in the way people say \u201cWe\u201d when they didn\u2019t lift a finger and also lifted lots of fingers. Hannah wanted to sit down on the floor and drink water forever. Instead she went to the place where the press was and said the three sentences she had learned to say\u2014Teacher. Dover. Love to my students\u2014and then she escaped with dignity that looked a lot like running.\n\nThe train back that night was full of people who thought they had seen something and weren\u2019t sure whether to admit it. A man across from her kept trying to catch her eye and then chickening out, which she understood on a spiritual level. Two girls took a selfie and then whispered so loud you could hear the whisper from three seats. She texted Mr. Barnes, Mr. Shaw, Ms. Davis, Mr. Sands. The group chat exploded into gifs that meant \u201cWe can\u2019t cope,\u201d and \u201cWe coped,\u201d and \u201cNow what.\u201d She texted June and Dorothy and received a photo of an empty plate and a caption: Cake has passed on. Went doing what it loved.\n\nOn Monday, the school moved as if nothing had happened and also as if everything had. The children were kind to her in the way children are kind when they decide an adult belongs, which means they mocked her gently and took the mick about her dress and staged a two-minute debate about whether she had eyebrows when they saw her on telly, because makeup. She laughed at them and made them read a sonnet and the world knit itself back together.\n\nAt break, she went to check on Gal. Mr. Shaw had left a note, capital letters, a drawing of a fish with a cape. He had done the salt in the right proportions, or close enough, and Gal was not cured but he was not worse. He swam with intent. His fins, still a little torn, moved like flags after a storm: battered but legible. Hannah put her hand to the glass and in some way that did not bear scientific scrutiny, he came to it. It felt like solidarity even if it was just habit. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to die of it,\u201d she told him. \u201cEither of us. Not this week.\u201d\n\nThat afternoon, as if the world were regularly scheduled and had no room for a subplot, Mr. Barnes rolled assembly in like a circus and made her stand there while the whole school cheered and then pretended not to have done it because public displays of anything are death if you\u2019re fourteen. She said something about trying and failing and trying anyway, and the microphone squealed and she winced and they laughed kindly at her pain. On the back row, Noah pretended to pretend he wasn\u2019t proud, which was a perfect circle of love drawn with a pen that was running out. Safia did a tiny clapping motion, hands just apart, like a bird.\n\nLate in the day, when the building had done its worst and was finally winding down like a radio station, the email came. It did not shout. It did not need to. It said: Next live round scheduled. It said: Rehearsal Thursday. It said: Publicity Tuesday. It said: Please keep all details confidential and be aware of press interest. It said: We were moved by the way you did the quiet. Our director would like you to consider a change to your second verse. It said: Call us.\n\nShe called, because you don\u2019t not call a person who holds a small part of your life between two fingers like that. The producer sounded as if she had been not sleeping for a hundred hours and also like she could run a small country on the side. \u201cWe want the story,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Dover of it, the teacher of it. We want the classroom in the song without it being literal. Think we can do that?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t do literal unless I\u2019m labelling fish food,\u201d Hannah said. She thought of Heaney. She thought of the boy on the train with the breathing trick. She thought of her mother\u2019s peas. \u201cWe can do that.\u201d\n\nWhen she left the building, it was already evening, and the light made a long strip on the floor of her room like a rug someone had rolled out toward a door she hadn\u2019t noticed. She put the chairs on the desks. She wiped the board clean of the day\u2019s vocabulary. She paused in the doorway longer than was normal, the way you do when you want someone to say \u201cDon\u2019t go,\u201d and there is nobody to say it because you have made your decisions and the room has its own life to get on with. In the tank, the small engine hummed. In the glass, she saw herself twice and the fish three times and the room infinite. She was a bit of everything: teacher and singer, daughter and person with a cat she wasn\u2019t allowed, woman who would get on a train and go to a place not built for her and stand there anyway.\n\nOutside, Dover lifted its chin to the night. The gulls were already asleep on whatever surfaces they had claimed, the buses were doing their last rounds like stubborn angels, and out past the harbour wall the sea rehearsed the same line it had always rehearsed, with conviction and without applause. She locked the door, took the banister in her hand as if it were a friend, and went down into the evening, the promise of new wind not frightening and not benign, but simply itself, and met it like you meet an old truth.The week opened itself like a map and immediately showed her the fold that always resisted lying flat. Tuesday was branded \u201cpublicity\u201d in the email that did not bother with punctuation beyond the bossy, and she had the small, ridiculous urge to iron her day the way you iron a shirt you want a stranger to approve of. Dover decided to behave like a town from a brochure, sky rinsed and gulls distant, as if someone had turned down their volume. The crew arrived in a white van that made the street look abruptly like a scene that had been ordered rather than lived, and Ms. Davis stood in the car park with her arms crossed and her mouth set in the way of a gate. They had permissions and badges and a man with a clipboard who said he loved schools, which Hannah tried not to interpret. They were careful and they were quick and they were wrapped in the smell of coffee and new batteries, and when they walked into 9C they took their hats off in the way that people still do, instinctive, as if classrooms were small churches with posters about safe sex.\n\nThey filmed the tank without the children in the room, because Mr. Barnes had said very clearly in a meeting that you do not let a camera see a child whose mother or father has not signed a piece of paper, and you do not even let a camera think about seeing a child, not without a piece of paper that could get God out of trouble. The cameraman\u2014a young woman with a nose ring and a serious, practical plait\u2014knelt like a supplicant and filmed Gal from his good side, which made Hannah laugh quietly because Gal would be unbearable if he knew he had one. He was still frayed but he would not be cowed; he surged toward the lens with the kind of swagger that, scaled up, would get you barred from pubs.\n\n\u201cHero fish,\u201d the sound man whispered, smiling like a conspirator as he held a fuzzy microphone that looked like a mammal you might whisper your sins into. \u201cWhat\u2019s his name?\u201d\n\n\u201cGal,\u201d she said, and when he looked blank she added, \u201cAfter a knight, but not the shiny one. The one who keeps making the wrong decision and then turns around and tries again.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood man,\u201d the sound man said to the fish, which felt perfectly natural in the context of a day that had agreed to be odd. They filmed her at the board and at the piano that lived in the corner and refused to stay in tune, not singing properly because they made it clear they didn\u2019t want her to empty the cupboard before the party. They filmed her hand underlining a sentence, and when they watched that back on a tiny screen it looked like something gentler than marking, like mending a seam.\n\nShe had laid out the exercise books with the appealing audacity of a person who believed that handwriting, properly done, could move mountains. Some of the children watched the incident through the door as they were allowed to pass in pairs on their way to Science, which Mr. Shaw had agreed to because he was in a reckless mood and had already terrorised his Year 10 with Bunsen burners before ten a.m. Safia stood with her head in the doorframe and her hair in a state of opinion, and when the camera turned toward the corridor like a sunflower she ducked in a way that would have shamed an acrobat. Later she reappeared with a great seriousness and said, \u201cMiss, if you are going to be on the telly again, can you make sure your eyebrows are even, because my mum said\u2014\u201d and then stopped, delighted with herself, because she knew very well she was pushing and guessing at the line, and took herself away before anyone else could.\n\nThe local paper, which employed a man who wore a tie out of respect for things and who collected the town\u2019s stories the way people used to collect bus tickets, asked for a photograph on the esplanade. Hannah put on a coat that made her look marginally more like a person in charge of her own life and stood by the railings while waves did what they had always done, which was make a nonsense of railings. The photographer kept saying things like \u201cchin down\u201d and \u201ceyes up\u201d and \u201cthink of a funny thought\u201d and she tried to oblige by thinking of Mr. Barnes bowing to the fish tank as if to a monarch. A gull swept in and took one look at the tableau and made a noise that could have been derision or blessing. The caption, the photographer promised, would be kind, because his mother liked her mother and this was how you did journalism in a town built like a family.\n\nOn the way back from that, she took the long route and stopped in at the charity shop with a paper bag she pretended was an impulse buy and was actually cake. June was sitting behind the till with a knee that was a small weather system, the bag of peas now a legend in a story that had already accrued five versions depending on who told it.\n\n\u201cI was twirling,\u201d June announced as if it would be unkind not to lead with the ridiculous. \u201cI was doing the tango with a bin liner. Dorothy said it was more like the foxtrot with a dishrag. The point is, only my pride bruised, and possibly the bit of me that said I was still seventeen. Give me a slice of whatever you\u2019ve got. I promise not to rate it and then I might rate it anyway.\u201d\n\nThey sat at the back on two chairs that had belonged to a church that had moved on and to a wedding that had ended happily if the scratched initials on the underside of the seats could be believed. They ate cake with a kind of full-bellied silence that only people who have known each other a long time can carry off. June watched Hannah with the way she watched her daughter, which was always several emotions at once. Pride came first. Then fear. Then joy. Then a fourth thing that was like the memory of a bridge they had crossed once in rain that had been both a nuisance and a blessing.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll look after yourself?\u201d June said, because mothers had to ask or else the sky would fold in. \u201cYou\u2019ll remember to eat and the bit in the song that feels like you\u2019ll fall off the edge isn\u2019t the edge at all, it\u2019s the bit right before you get the handrail? You\u2019ll remember your own handrail?\u201d\n\nHannah thought of the hinge, and of the breath she had found inside the song like a place to sit down in a field that had previously offered only standing. She thought of the banister and the way she gripped it every evening as if it were a person with a very steady personality. \u201cI\u2019ll remember,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd if I forget, I\u2019ve got professional reminders with clipboards who will hustle me back into remembering.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019d better,\u201d June sniffed, and then softened, because hardness did not suit her for long. \u201cWhen you were small you used to sing to your rubber duck and you\u2019d pretend it didn\u2019t float unless your song told it how. I need to tell you that the duck floats anyway. But it floats better when you do.\u201d\n\nThursday\u2019s rehearsal brought the part of the process that Hannah hadn\u2019t anticipated would undo her, which was the smallness of the kindness between strangers who were suddenly on the same team. The MD had arranged the invisible classroom into the song without a single literal bell. There was a rasp of bow against string that sounded like chalk finding the right angle. There was a high line that could have been a child deciding to speak. There was a drum so soft it could have been thumbs on a desktop. When she sang into that, the words found a way of carrying their own memory without dragging it around by the hair. She leaned into the hinge and it swung as if the song had been waiting years for somebody to open it.\n\nBetween run-throughs, she paced the corridor where other people\u2019s nerves had been left to cool, and she caught sight of herself in a panel of glass that had decided to act as a mirror just for this afternoon. She looked like someone who had told the truth by mistake and been applauded for it, which was the sort of luck you did not rely on. Her phone vibrated like a small creature with a warning, and she made the mistake of looking at it between doors, just long enough to see a message that began, Who does she think she is, and a profile picture of someone whose dog looked very happy. She slid the phone back into her bag with a level of care that did not match the threat and took a breath against the brick wall that smelled faintly of new paint and older anxiety. The MD opened the door a crack and saw it on her face, the thing of being very visible and also very attackable, and he did not say anything deep or supportive. He raised his eyebrows and said, \u201cOne more? From the place where it breaks?\u201d\n\nThey did it again, from the broken bit, which was how you learned not to fear it, and the breaking place became something else. It became the part of the song that knew her, and she knew it, and when you meet yourself like that on a stage, the part of the audience that has been waiting to meet themselves too will find you where you stand.\n\nFriday, a letter came from the Department of Education that looked official and turned out to be a round-robin about attendance figures and football boots, and a card came from a woman called Maureen with a pen that stuttered across the paper where it hit the raised bit where \u201cWith Sympathy\u201d would have been on cards for other occasions. \u201cWe watched you,\u201d it said, with a sea of exclamation marks that wanted very much to be polite. \u201cMy husband said you had the lungs of an old mining choir. I told him not to be rude and then he cried. We are not from Dover but we came there once on a bus trip in 1997 and had a very bad sandwich which I am obviously not blaming you for. I hope you don\u2019t stop.\u201d She pinned it to the noticeboard with the yoga flyer and the CPR moustache and the map for the fire exits, because in a school, all human events end up in one messy constellation anyway.\n\nShe had briefly believed that she could keep the piece of herself that liked to be alone with her singing only slightly less alone, that she could learn to stand on the bigger square of light without also being invited to be a person for other people to have opinions about in their kitchens. The online thing pushed back against that quiet fantasy with the inexorable pressure of a tide you hadn\u2019t read on the chart. She did what she always did when she didn\u2019t trust the weather; she sought out sensible people who had never once pulled her into a storm, and she brought them biscuits so they\u2019d be happy telling her the truth.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll need to not read the comments,\u201d Ms. Davis said, eating a custard cream with the methodical efficiency of somebody reading through the answer booklet and circling B\u2019s. \u201cAnd you\u2019ll need to fail at not reading them and then not write back to them, which will be a new muscle. If someone rings the school because they are cross that you have a job and also a dream, tell them to ring me. I like the cross. They\u2019re my people. I drain them of their cross and send them into the afternoon with a reminder to do their spellings.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome of them are kind,\u201d Hannah said, because she wanted to admit all the weather when she talked to Davis or else she would be corrected. \u201cSometimes they say a thing that looks like it could go in a pocket for later. I don\u2019t like to pretend there isn\u2019t good in it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can carry the good in one pocket,\u201d Ms. Davis allowed. \u201cThe other pocket you fill with pebbles, for throwing at the gulls. I\u2019m joking. Don\u2019t throw at the gulls. They know people who will throw back.\u201d\n\nMr. Barnes came and stood at the doorway with the small pose he did when he wanted a moment without it feeling like a moment. He had a letter in his hand and a glint that could end a war. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a complaint,\u201d he began in a tone that said the complaint could go into the bin as politely as into the fire. \u201cSomeone\u2019s very concerned that your sudden celebrity might destabilise the already precarious boat of Year 9\u2019s attention spans.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoes the someone have a name?\u201d Hannah asked, and when he told her, she nodded, because the name belonged to a person who had reasons, who had lived in a small town for a long time and believed in keeping everyone at the correct altitude. \u201cI\u2019ll speak to her,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll tell her that all my teaching is still done with chalk on the same boards, and that fame is a word that belongs to other people and not to me. I\u2019ll tell her that no matter what town my face appears in, this is the only room I care to own.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll tell her,\u201d he agreed, and folded the letter into a small square that ended up in his pocket as if that were the natural end of all official documents. \u201cAnd I will tell her that if we don\u2019t allow our own to go and be seen, then we only ever see strangers, and what good is that.\u201d\n\nIn the midst of all that, small life kept insisting on being cared for. Noah forgot his homework and turned up with a poem folded into a plane instead, which he launched too soon and then went to fetch as if participation had always been his plan. Safia said \u201cblood will have blood\u201d in a rebuttal about Macbeth with a crispness that could have cut carpet, and then softened and said, \u201cbut also sometimes blood will have a nap,\u201d which made the room laugh and then think and then write something better than they would have written without humour. A boy who had practised sullen to the point where it had become an art form asked quietly if he could read his work out, and when he did, his voice wobbled in a way that made another boy who \u201cdidn\u2019t do feelings\u201d go still for a full five seconds. Hannah watched the five seconds and then watched them break into adolescence again like a shoal breaking for the light, and she put it in her other pocket, the one she kept for what mattered.\n\nSaturday came round again because days insist on sequence no matter how dramatic you want them to be. She walked to her mother\u2019s with a bag of shopping and half the town stopping her to tell her the details of their viewing habits. She adored and tolerated it with the same reserves. June had her leg up and a book under the cushion and no intention of making this about pain when there was cake to discuss, and by the time Hannah left, Dorothy had turned up with a jar of pickled onions insisting they cured disappointment, which made no sense and also some sense. On the way home, the mariner\u2019s wind caught her and put colour into her face that no makeup on any programme could have faked.\n\nThat night the cat was waiting on the windowsill again, bell silent, whiskers organised. Hannah opened the window and let it in and said nothing about boundaries because boundaries were for daylight. The cat did a full perimeter and then settled with the insulted sigh of a creature who had once been worshipped and found the present day wanting. She sat on the floor with her back against the cupboard and her legs out in front of her and let the room feel itself around her. When she sang softly into the quiet\u2014half a verse, a line for luck\u2014it wasn\u2019t for rehearsal or for a camera but to remind her body that it could make a sound and trust it to leave and not be lost.\n\nSunday felt less like a mountain to climb and more like a hill she already knew, because she had learned the shape of the day now, where the stairs were and where the carpet changed its mind. The backstage smelled of hairspray and the inside of a black coat, and the people with headsets nodded at her in the way you nod at someone in church when you\u2019re not supposed to be greeting but it would be rude not to. She played a game with herself to settle her heart to a manageable architectural tremor; she thought of all the banisters she had put her hands on and thanked each one in turn, the school, the charity shop, the stairs at the Mariner with their carvings, the unforgiving rails at the pier. She thought of the tank and the way the engine hummed like a small, determined animal. She thought of Gal, already perhaps re-growing a whisper of fin, and it steadied her more than it had any right to. It was absurd to be steadied by a fish and it was also exactly right.\n\nThe producer caught her by the elbow as she set her foot on the stairs to the stage, and she braced without knowing whether it would be a change or a blessing. \u201cIt\u2019s yours,\u201d the woman said, and she said it with the quiet that powerful people put on when they have decided to be careful with you. \u201cIf the audience get excited early, don\u2019t let them rush you. If they cough, don\u2019t panic. If the lights feel warmer than last time, it\u2019s because they are. They have moods. We all do. Yours is the weather tonight.\u201d\n\nIn London, time behaved like a rubber band, generous and cruel. The first note hung longer than it should have and then fell like a fruit that had deserved to be eaten. The second verse was the place they had reworked to make room for the life she could not bring to the stage literally; she placed the silence where the classroom lived and let the strings catch it as if it were a bird that had flown in accidentally and would not be manhandled. Halfway along it, someone shouted something inarticulate, the kind of shout that could unnerve you if you believed it had anything to do with you. She set her foot on the hinge and it held and nothing fell apart. The finish was less of a finish and more of a setting down, and the relief in the room felt like the sense of an old joke finally being shared with the right person.\n\nThe aftermath was the same and entirely different, because that is how repetition does its clever work. The panel said a thing they had meant or not meant and it mattered and it didn\u2019t. The audience stood up or didn\u2019t stand up as instructed by their own hearts or by the person at the end of the row with stronger feelings than sense. She came off and was grabbed for press and did not remember the words she said until someone sent them to her later with commentary. A woman she did not know held her by the shoulders and said \u201cThat was an answer to a question I hadn\u2019t asked yet,\u201d and then looked embarrassed and went away quickly before the moment could curdle. It was all human and ridiculous and beautiful and exhausting, and when the door to the corridor shut behind her she leaned on it and wanted very much to go to a place where the floor did not have tape on it telling her who to be.\n\nShe got that place on the train again, the ugly blessed carriage that took people back to kitchens they understood. The phone had messages in it like a river has fish, some you wanted to catch and some you hoped would find their own estuary. She scrolled and stopped and put it down and picked it up, because the muscle was new and twitchy. She saw one from a student who had left two years ago and was now, apparently, in the army, who wrote, \u201cI thought it was daft when you made us write the letters to ourselves but I found mine in my drawer and it told me to keep going. Seeing you on the telly made me think I can do both the stupid job and the singing I do in my cupboard. Thank you. Don\u2019t tell anyone I said thank you,\u201d and she hid her face in her scarf for a second because it was her new favourite thing that she would tell no one about.\n\nWhen the train tipped them into Dover, the air was colder in the useful way, as if the night had been saving a clean breath for her. She went home the long way again, because she was not ready for rooms. The harbour lights had their own idea of celebration, steady pulses instead of glitter. She could see, out beyond, the smudge of a ferry turning, its own small world of microwaves and children and truck drivers and a woman somewhere with a notebook making a list. The cat was there when she reached her street, of course it was, and this time it allowed itself to be picked up with the grace of a creature who understands PR.\n\nMonday morning didn\u2019t care how your Sunday had gone. School rolled over her like itself, and she was grateful. The fish were still alive; Gal made a small ceremony of being fed as if he intended to sign something official. Mr. Shaw had left another note, this time with detailed measurements and an apology to Marie Curie for earlier flippancy. The door banged and Year 9 arrived and they did their ritual of pretending they had nothing to say and then saying everything at once. Safia reported with authority that her uncle had cried \u201cfor no reason, which is to say a lot of reasons.\u201d Noah said, very sternly, that he had noticed a comma missed in one of the captions and it had ruined the whole experience, and then he grinned in a way that said he had been proud enough to make himself dizzy.\n\nAt lunch, Mr. Barnes asked her to the hall and she went with obedient suspicion. The entire staff had organised an impromptu rehearsal of the wave generation, and somebody\u2014of course Ms. Davis\u2014had made a banner out of sugar paper and too much hope that read KEEP YOUR WEATHER, MISS FLINT, and she pretended not to cry and failed in a manageable way. In the afternoon, Mr. Sands brought her a photocopy of a song he had taken from some anthology three headteachers ago, and said without preamble, \u201cIf you go further, this might be for when you cannot imagine how to do it again. It doesn\u2019t sound like you now. But it could.\u201d He was a closed door that occasionally opened and put a cake on the mat.\n\nThere was, because the world requires balance, another message from the programme that had a perfunctory cheerfulness she had learned meant someone with a higher salary had had an idea. They wanted her to come to London Tuesday evening, not for singing but for sitting on a sofa and being gently interrogated by a presenter whose job it was to presume intimacy. \u201cWe think people want to learn more about you,\u201d the producer said, steady and kind, and Hannah\u2019s stomach did a thing she had not had time to schedule. She had the reflex to say no because of her children and her privacy and the fact that you cannot live on a sofa, but she also had a different reflex now that had been born the moment her song found its hinge on a stage with hot air and more opinions than lungs. She said yes and she wrote another set of cover notes and she was both glad and appalled that she had a system now for disappearing without cutting a child in half.\n\nOn the sofa, she found that the presenter was a person and not a machine and had a laugh that meandered on the way to its point, and that somebody had told him not to ask about her father, which meant something had been heard at some level. He did ask about the fish, and she told a national audience that her guppy had been poorly and that guppies could, in their way, be valiant, and the show cut to b-roll of a tank that was definitely not hers because her classroom did not have lighting like a spaceship. They gauzed Dover with a tenderness that made her forgive them, and when she spoke about teaching, they did not make that look like a fallback. If anybody read her words as a plea for sainthood, they did so without her permission.\n\nDays spun. The second live show came nearer as if running downhill. She found that she had a new skill, which was recognising the exact moment when Ms. Davis had had too much of other people\u2019s nonsense and diverting a child just before impact. She found that she could add salt to a tank without feeling like she was hexing the water. She found that she could ask for what she needed from the MD without fear that he would decide she was a diva and show her out. The song changed one more time in a way so small only they would notice, an extra breath at the front, and it made everything after it clearer. She thought of that change as an apology to the part of herself that had been told to be quiet for too long; she had given it a seat at the table first.\n\nThe morning of the second live, the sea went blue without being asked. She took her tea to the window and stood looking at the bit of town that had not moved since her childhood except where people had insisted on putting up new shades of paint and hope. The email pinged and she let it sit because she had learned that emails could wait for a second if you asked them to, and when she opened it, it was from a person who had nothing to do with television and everything to do with the other half of her life. It was from a woman who ran a little choir in a church hall that smelled of dust and biscuits; she wrote, \u201cIf you need a room to sing into with nobody in it and a piano that only sometimes pretends to be one, the key is still under the mat. I put new tea towels in. Your mum says she\u2019ll tell you not to get ideas, by which she means please get ideas and then come home with them.\u201d\n\nIn the corridor outside her classroom, a notice that hadn\u2019t been there yesterday had been pinned up, and she paused. It was Ms. Davis\u2019s handwriting again, tart and loopy. It said: \u201cResilience clinic. Free. Room 12. Bring your fear and a pencil.\u201d Underneath someone had replied in a different hand: \u201cDo you have pens.\u201d Under that: \u201cNo.\u201d Under that in another, smaller hand: \u201cCan I bring a different fear than everyone else.\u201d Someone had drawn a fish with a cape. Someone had underlined \u201cfree\u201d twice as if to make the point. She stood there a second, the late morning sun finding a way down the rumpus of brick and glass, and let herself believe in the ordinary heroism of the people she worked with.\n\nWhen she finally turned on the lamp of the tank and sprinkled the flakes, Gal came up from the plant like someone returning to work after having discovered they were not immortal. He took the food and didn\u2019t posture, which in guppy terms was a mantra. He swam without drama. He left the mirror alone for a full two minutes. She watched him and the quiet he made felt like a promise you could write on your palm and not have it sweat off. She put her hand to the glass and he touched where she touched, drawn by whatever fish are drawn by, hunger or habit or heat.\n\n\u201cYou and me,\u201d she told him, because she had a ridiculous heart and it demanded ridiculous rituals. \u201cWe do it again. We make a small world make sense, and then we go out into the larger one and try not to let it unmake us.\u201d He flared once, a tiny, dignified flare, as if to say he accepted the terms, and she laughed and turned to face a day that would require her to mark the difference between an adverb and an adjective in one hour and to stand between two forms of air in another. It would be, she thought, a day like any other, and it would be the day she had wanted since the silver thread had tugged her up in the dawn on Monday that felt like a decade ago. The kettle would shout. The gulls would hold their parliament. London would begin to warm its lights. She would take her banister in her hand when it was time to leave, and meet the stairs like a truth she could not unknow.Wednesday afternoon folded around her the way school days do when they know they are going to have to let you go early and are sulking about it. She spent the last lesson on grammar because grammar was ballast. They diagrammed sentences with the patience of archaeologists, and when Noah protested that nobody in the modern world needed to know what a subordinating conjunction was, she told him that knowing how things held together was never wasted, and he wrote a sentence that used three and then crossed two out because restraint is a muscle too. Safia read hers aloud like a person expecting the room to argue, and when it didn\u2019t, she took the quiet as if it were a compliment. At the bell Hannah held them just long enough to say, \u201cBe kind to each other while I\u2019m gone. Don\u2019t let anybody eat your lunch or your thunder. Do the homework. It will not kill you. If it does kill you, it will make an excellent piece of gothic writing.\u201d They laughed and went, and she stood in their weather as it thinned.\n\nIn the corridor, a man with a camera who had absolutely been told he wasn\u2019t to be here and had come anyway pretended to find the noticeboard fascinating. Mr. Barnes materialised like a moral and put his hand out for the man\u2019s lanyard. \u201cNo children,\u201d he said, not unkindly and not soft. \u201cNot my walls. You want shots of inspirational footsteps, you film the staircase. You want inspirational people, you write to me and I tell you \u2018no\u2019 politely.\u201d The man attempted charm and got back the expression that had retired three Ofsted inspectors in a row. He left, waving apologetically at the CPR dummy on the poster which, even moustached, looked unimpressed.\n\nHannah turned on the lamp in the tank for a last look and Gal obliged her by being ordinary. He lapped the filter, discovered it was the same filter as yesterday, and didn\u2019t take offence. His tail was tattered still but less; like paper dried on a line after rain, it had remembered its own shape. She was surprised at how much energy it gave her, this small confirmation that mending could be noticed if you were patient enough to let your eyes settle. She spoke low to him because it helped her. \u201cSpa, not disco,\u201d she said. \u201cEat politely. Don\u2019t make Mrs. Partridge from cleaning speak sharply to you because it will ruin your whole evening.\u201d\n\nShe left cover work that even a stranger with a cold could deliver, labelled it like a military operation, and locked her cupboard against the part of herself that would, at nine p.m., mourn three red pens she hadn\u2019t rescued. She went via the office to thank the receptionist for being the sort of person who kept the whole enterprise polite, and via the hall where Ms. Davis had written on the whiteboard for the resilience clinic a new line: You may bring biscuits. It will help nobody and change everything. Someone had drawn a lightning bolt that looked suspiciously like Mr. Shaw\u2019s project from Year 8 electric circuits. She pictured him leaning on a desk with his porridge tie already on its second life of the day and felt the school in her bones as if it were weightlifting and she was unexpectedly good at it.\n\nOn the stairs, she did what she had promised herself she would always do if this kept happening. She paused with her hand around the banister and said out loud, because privacy is a relative concept in a building that contains a thousand hearts, \u201cThank you.\u201d It was not to anything in particular and also to everything. She was a woman who had spent her twenties convinced gratitude was a posture and now had to be honest about the fact that it was a practice and better warmed you than not. Then she went; the day let her go; the wind outside had been saving up.\n\nLondon received her with the air of a city that had already seen it all and might see it again if it felt like it. The building took her and the building took everyone, dog and drum boys and a man with a harmonica who had the ancient face of road and sleep. The runner with the clipboard who had adopted her as a project pointed her to a corner that would be hers for ten minutes and told her how we were running, and Hannah loved her in the way you love people who do not lie to you about time. The MD walked her through the small amendments they had set like stones, the breath before the first phrase, the decision not to let the strings show off, the agreement that silence would be part of the arrangement because you can arrange quiet if you\u2019re brave enough. In the dressing room, the makeup woman had a steady hand and the professional malice for the cheap highlighter that had clearly broken three teenagers\u2019 hearts this week; she swapped in a better kind with a calm \u201cNo sparkle at your age unless you\u2019re a Christmas ornament,\u201d and brushed Hannah\u2019s eyebrows into submission, which made Safia\u2019s voice run in her head, a warning and a grace.\n\nWhen the stage manager came to collect the next set of trembling people, he looked at Hannah the way people do when they have decided they will behave like the inverse of a hurricane and the metaphor will hold if both of you hold it. \u201cSame marks,\u201d he said. \u201cDifferent day. Don\u2019t let the room tell you who you are. We can dim light; we cannot dim you. You do that or you don\u2019t.\u201d He was the priest of tape and doorways. She nodded and carried herself to the wings.\n\nOut there, the room was full of air and noise and bright rules. The audience glittered like a night sea. She could not see faces and was grateful for it. The judges arranged themselves like small countries behind a border and she barely looked at them because her business was with the next breath and the next. The little red light came on in a place it had not been yesterday and it would have undone her once, the thought of so many eyes in so many rooms, but she had already spent a decade with thirty pairs of eyes on her every morning first thing, and those eyes were the unkindest and the kindest both, so she knew a thing about looking and stillness. The presenter said her name the way announcers say names when they don\u2019t want to put their own weather in it, and she stepped forward and put her weather down like a rug.\n\nThe opening was clean because she asked it to be. The note sat where it had been told to sit, but like a living thing, not like a soldier. The strings found her without stepping on her heels. She looked nowhere and everywhere; she allowed herself, once, to look at a point where a person might be and was repaid by the oddest sense of being recognised by a stranger, which made your heart confused and your back straighten. Halfway through the second verse\u2014the verse they\u2019d carved to carry the classroom\u2014someone in the balcony began to clap on a feeling, and others read the weather wrong and joined in because kindness is sometimes clumsy. She felt the rush of it come up toward her like a wind that hadn\u2019t read the sign. She lifted her hand an inch and opened her fingers and did not look stern\u2014she couldn\u2019t; she could only look like a teacher asking for quiet with a smile\u2014and the applause died as if she had put a coat over a parrot. She did not hurry to reward them for obeying. She put down the silence instead, and you could feel it, the room deciding to be held.\n\nIt trembled once; she held; the hinge held. She thought of the children when they breathed together and a noise that wanted to be mischief turned into listening because someone had made them want to be proud of themselves. She got to the place where the word ran up the hill and over, and she let it climb and did not overfeed it. The drum found her feet. At the end she did not put a flourish where none belonged. She let the music sit down and then she sat down with it, inside it, so that when the applause finally came, it came into a room that had not been startled but welcomed.\n\nThe panel said things. One of them said, \u201cThat\u2019s control,\u201d and meant it as a compliment and also like a warning, because people are suspicious of women who handle rooms. One of them made a joke about detentions for clapping and the camera found her laughing at herself, because self-ridicule is an easier public act than self-belief. One of them said something about a grandmother that the nation would relate to, and it washed over her harmlessly because she was busy feeling her pulse slow to a human animal\u2019s. Above all, what she heard was the sound\u2014a relief, a release, a decision\u2014that comes from a crowd who have been given back to themselves. She took it in because it belonged to them and she was lucky enough to be present at the time of its happening.\n\nBackstage, where light behaves differently, the MD shrugged one shoulder as if to say that was the tune, and the runner with the clipboard took a victory sip of water for her because she had been holding two clipboards and a radio and the fate of six latecomers. The dog did an interview and barked at the appropriate syllable. A man cried for fifteen seconds and then remembered that he did not do crying and instead absolutely had something in his eye. She went where she was told, said the things you say when someone with a bright microphone leans into your day and asks what it was like to be alive for two minutes; she did not know how to answer that without sounding facetious or enormous, and so she told a small truth that she knew would feed no wolves. She said, \u201cThey listened,\u201d and the presenter said \u201cWe did,\u201d and for once it felt true.\n\nOn the train back she had her face in a scarf again\u2014not to hide, exactly, but to keep heat in\u2014and the carriage did that thing of becoming briefly a village. Two older women watched her with proprietary fondness and showed each other photos of dogs not present. A boy moved seats because he had misjudged the smell of his crisps, and apologised, which looked a lot like grace. Across from her a teenager put a hand on his friend\u2019s shoulder and said, in exactly the rhythm of the man she had seen days ago, \u201cNo melting,\u201d and Hannah had to bite inside her cheek to keep from laughing and crying at the same time at the way even the tricks of breathing travel. Her phone was a beehive. She answered what she had the strength for, left the rest like nectar for later, and sent June a photo of the backstage curtain because it felt like the only true portrait of the night.\n\nDover made its case at midnight with a damp wind and an unambiguous horizon. She went the long way again because her nerves needed unpeopled distances and the comforting light of kebab shops. At the corner by the salon that turned hair into architecture, a car idled with music turned to thin. A seagull upended a bin with an air of civic purpose. The cat appeared at the bottom of her steps as if it had been contracted by a very quiet agency to greet and appraise. It suffered a kiss on the top of its head in order to collect rent. Inside, she laid the green dress over a chair like laundry because she refused to make a shrine of it. She took her makeup off with the dutifulness of someone taught by a mother who believed in clean faces and moisturiser as creed. In bed she fell asleep the way you fall into a swimming pool when you know it\u2019s going to be cold and know you\u2019ll be fine and do it anyway.\n\nMorning made a liar of glamour. There was toothpaste to buy and register to cover and a note from the premises manager about the boiler that had tried to die again. The fish glowed in their own reasonable way and ate without theatre. Gal, now moving with a more modest flourish, acknowledged her with ignorance and need, which was always the agreement between them. In her inbox a message had arrived while she'd been in a green room, and for a second it looked like the sort of subject line you delete because you are not made of time. It said simply: Your father. She didn\u2019t open it until break, when she had a biscuit in a napkin and the staffroom was in the quiet between two laughs.\n\nThe email was from Dorothy, of course. Dorothy did not write long and she did not write late unless it was worth it. Hannah read, felt the floor, kept reading. He had been in the shop, Dorothy wrote, because he had not been able to not, and June had been out back arranging old board games into piles by missing pieces and Dorothy had seen him first and made him tea without asking what he took because it was not that kind of day. He had said he had seen Hannah on the television and he had called her Hannah as if the word were unfamiliar and wanting to be practiced and Dorothy had said, After all this time, imagine, and he had winced as if hit and she had not apologised for the blow. He had left a card. He had said he would come back only if asked. Dorothy had suggested to him, in the tone she reserved for men and moths, that if he was waiting for women to ask, he would keep waiting for the rest of any decent life. He had not argued. The card was attached below, a scan that made his writing newly wretched, clumsy, older.\n\nShe stared at the looping letters like they were in code. He had not said much. He had said he was in Folkestone, which explained nothing. He had said he was glad to see she had used her lungs the way her mother had always wanted, which was an odd sentence to give a stranger to carry. He had said he was sorry without adjectives. He had written a number. He had not asked forgiveness as if he were entitled to it and he had not begged as if he were a child. He had done a very British thing and left a door ajar in case the weather changed.\n\nShe folded her biscuit in half and then into quarters because hands have to do something. It was notable that her heart did not start sprinting as if chased; it lifted into a light jog and then steadied. Mr. Barnes appeared with the slowness of friendship and Elaine from Geography, who knew every hill from here to Calais, slid a cup toward her. She did not say a thing about her father because there was no thing to say that had not already learned all the shapes of silence. She put the card under a book on subjunctives and let its corners flatten out.\n\nThe children were unbothered by the adult plotline they did not know about because their own stories were more urgent. A forgotten PE kit became an existential crisis for a boy who had never cried at anything school had thrown at him and now cried at cotton. A girl who had spent months refusing to write her name any way but suspended in the air wrote it on the line and blinked at her own practicality as if somebody had swapped her pen with a maturity. Safia brought in a news article about an opera singer whose throat had decided to go on strike and demanded in a way that made Hannah proud and nervous that the class talk about bodies and work and what you do when you want something and your body says no. They argued with respect and a few very excellent insults and wrote with care and then ruined their own carefulness with an extra adjective that some of them had the good grace to cross out.\n\nBetween the end of school and the next thing, she walked to June\u2019s to pick up the card in its real cardboard. June sat with her foot up on the pouffe and her face arranged into a brave that was always only ever half real. They handled the card as if it was expensive and not from a pack you could buy for a pound in a petrol station. June didn\u2019t tell Hannah what to do. She didn\u2019t ask. She leaned her head against the chair and sang one line of a song without meaning to, a foolish old lullaby, and they both laughed because nerves will make you laugh at anything, especially tenderness. \u201cHe didn\u2019t come in all at once,\u201d June said finally. \u201cHe was a man who took a very long time to arrive everywhere, including himself. If you call him, call him as if he might get lost on the way and need to be fetched. And if you don\u2019t call him, don\u2019t call him. There\u2019s no prize for either. I\u2019m here afterwards either way.\u201d\n\nThe show accordioned the week again, a strange concertina of normal and not. There was another rehearsal with the band, tighter, looser, sweeter. There was a fifteen-minute slot with a television person who seemed genuinely to believe that if the nation learned that Hannah liked cheddar more than brie, the nation might feel better about its own choices. There was a message from the man in Folkestone with the misspelled subject line that somehow made her forgive more than the content did\u2014\u201cSaw you again\u201d with no punctuation, as if saying something without a capital would make it less dangerous. She replied with a sentence that did not close doors; she kept her weather. When she put her phone away after sending it, she put her hand flat on the desk of her classroom, on the gum that a hundred bored children had once stuck under there and been forgiven for, and felt the table forgive her back for whatever she was about to break or mend.\n\nA parent did corner her one afternoon with the fierce politeness of someone who had spent too much of their life writing letters in blue ink. The woman had concerns about priorities. She had read\u2014she didn\u2019t like to say where\u2014that fame could destabilise a person\u2019s moral compass and the GCSE syllabus in one go. Hannah let the woman say it all because sometimes people have to hear themselves to know they are talking about their own fear. When she had finished, Hannah said, \u201cYour daughter will get the same me she has always got. She will get the best me I can give. I will be here before the bell and after it. I will hold a space open for her and point at her commas. I will say no when she is unkind and yes when she risks being brave. And then I go to London and sing and it doesn\u2019t take the chalk out of my hand. It just takes me for a bit and brings me back differently. If you like, you can not watch. If you like, you can come to parents\u2019 evening and make me say all this again. I\u2019ll say it as many times as you need.\u201d The woman\u2019s mouth went soft. She said, \u201cAll right,\u201d as if she had expected to be argued with and someone had instead offered her a cup of tea. She sent a follow-up email with a single line: Thank you for doing both.\n\nSome nights, when the house was very still and the cat had given up pretending it didn\u2019t live there, she sang without sound. She shaped the words and let air do what sound would do without waking the neighbours or the griefs she had promised not to water after dark. She stood by the window and watched the ferry\u2019s slow grace and felt the town at her back, a weight and a mercy. On one of those nights, when the day had been full of good small events and a single unignorable ache, her phone lit up with a message that said simply, Are you awake. She was, but she typed, I can be tomorrow, which was the kindest way of saying not yet. The reply did not come, which was a reply.\n\nIn the music room, Mr. Sands wrote a note on a scrap that then became important because he had written it. It said: The third song will need a different kind of quiet. Sit differently. He offered her nothing else, because he was not a man to apologise to a person for the mountains becoming steeper. She knew what he meant. The first quiet had been a held breath. The second had been a hand raised for hush. The third would be a silence you invited yourself into because you knew now it was a room and not an absence. She took the paper and put it in her pocket, and it warmed there until the next Wednesday, when she unfolded it and it made perfect sense, but only because she had had a Tuesday in between that contained three hours of detention, a child with a sore heart, and a gull so enormous it looked like a rumour.\n\nThe semi-final\u2014that was the language other people used; she thought of it as another square of light\u2014came nearer and brought with it a new kind of message from the programme. \u201cWe\u2019re thinking,\u201d the producer said carefully, \u201cabout a small\u2026 community element.\u201d Hannah braced, because community in television is often code for tidy sentiment. \u201cNot literal,\u201d the woman went on, hearing her brace over the phone like a wire. \u201cNo children on a stage. We were humiliated by an ethics lecture from your headteacher and have come to respect the man. But a chalkboard. A desk. A light like late afternoon. If we do it right, it will look like where you live. You can say no. If you say no, we will do blue lights and pretend we thought of blue this morning.\u201d\n\nHannah put the phone between her ear and shoulder and thought about the room and what it would think of being imitated. She pictured 9C as a ghost on a London soundstage and wanted not to cheapen it. She also wanted to honour the way a place shapes a voice. \u201cDust,\u201d she heard herself say. \u201cAnd a hum. You can fake the dust. The hum is harder. There\u2019s a weather to the room. If you respect the weather, you can borrow it. If you don\u2019t, you\u2019ll break my heart and whatever\u2019s left of your budget.\u201d There was a delighted intake of air on the other end and the sound of a pen racing ahead of itself. \u201cWe can do hum,\u201d the producer said. \u201cWe cannot believe we are having a conversation about hum. This is why these shows are ridiculous and magnificent.\u201d\n\nOn the day itself\u2014why pretend it was anything but a truer day dressed up\u2014she arrived to find her life suggested in props. A chair that wasn\u2019t her chair but understood chairness. A board cleaner that was too clean. A strip of light across a fake carpet that had the colour of the rectangle in her classroom when the sun was right, which made her forgive them their budget and their smoothing of rough edges. They had even made the air look worked-in, which was a level of artistry she had not expected. She ran her hands along the desk the way you pat a horse, half to calm it and half to calm yourself, and felt the slight give of set builders who had decided not to build the world out of lies. The MD lifted his chin at the light cue and she nodded because they were in agreement: weather first, notes second.\n\nHer father sent a message that afternoon, a wiser one than the last. Can I come, it said, to the telly. Not there, she typed. Another time. Another place. Tea. It was generous and it wasn\u2019t; it was a hand held out over the right body of water at least. He sent back, Tell me if sugar, and she had to sit down in the corridor because the sentence was plain and silly and contained more of him than any apology would have. She wrote, No sugar, because some truths you learn at six and keep. She did not tell June until after, because she was not unkind and because you cannot ask a mother to hold two kinds of nerves at once and still make a salad.\n\nWhen she walked out, the dust and hum worked. The room was a suggestion of a room; the song did the rest. She placed the first word on the line where black marker met whiteboard and let the vowel find the corners. The arrangement sat under her like a piece of floor that had decided not to betray her today. They had added a single bell\u2014light as the sound her fingernail made on the tank glass when she tapped good morning to Gal\u2014and she had argued against it until she heard it and conceded that sometimes the clich\u00e9 and the truth share a wardrobe. The audience quieted in phases. The judges did what judges do. The camera remembered to leave her eyes alone and look at her hands when she told it to with an angle of the wrist; she would not have known how to command that three weeks ago. Somewhere in the middle, in the place where Mr. Sands had promised a different quiet lived, she went there. She sat in the blank that wasn\u2019t blank. She opened a door that hadn\u2019t existed last month and found, behind it, not fear, but space.\n\nAfter, you blink and find yourself in a room with fruit on a plate and people making noises like memory is hurting them. The runner with the clipboard looked like a person who had been asked to count rain, but she smiled and stuck a post-it to Hannah\u2019s hand like a new sacrament. It had three names on it and a time and a note: Press friendly. Press-ish. Press no. She tried to follow the schedule and failed because life is the only thing that gets to be in charge. Someone from a newspaper with a reputation for cruelty asked her, with the elegance of a man trying to get blood out of a stone, whether there were any men in her life who might be proud tonight. She said, \u201cMany,\u201d and moved on before he could imagine he was one.\n\nWhen it was over, over in the way that means there is always a next, she got the train back and turned off her phone for most of it and looked out of the dark into the dark and felt at home. At Dover, two boys tried to run on the platform and their mother snapped their names into obedience; then she put her hand on their heads gently because tenderness always apologises to discipline if it can. The cat was on the step with a new sense of itself; perhaps it had been complimented by a cameraman and would be unbearable for a week. She gave it dinner that would only encourage it. She took the note Mr. Sands had written and pinned it beside the fridge magnet that said BE NICE OR LEAVE and the electricity bill that made a case for revolution.\n\nIn the morning, the resilience clinic had acquired a queue and Ms. Davis was wearing a cape made of sarcasm and was dispensing pencils with the sternness of a pharmacist. \u201cYou don\u2019t need an appointment,\u201d she told a child who clearly wished she did. \u201cYou need a seat and a willingness to be improved. When I look at you, I see potential. When you look at me, you see me seeing your potential. Let us not waste each other\u2019s time.\u201d The child sat and took a breath and then another and then did their homework, which was a miracle in every direction and also, somehow, not unusual for a Tuesday.\n\nHannah took 9C through a poem that needed them, not because it was obvious but because it had hands the size of their hearts and they could feel themselves being held if they stopped showing off long enough. Noah found the word \u201cward\u201d inside \u201ctoward\u201d and made a joke bad enough to be an achievement. Safia asked if ambition ever calmed down and whether that meant you had to invent a new word once you got what you wanted because calling it ambition forever seemed unfair. They wrote with their heads tilted, the way people do when they are taking themselves seriously and don\u2019t wish to be caught at it.\n\nMidweek, Dorothy rang Hannah at school at exactly the wrong time and so it must have been important. \u201cI have held him off three days,\u201d she said, and Hannah parted her mouth to say \u201cWho\u201d and didn\u2019t have to. \u201cHe is coming to the shop Thursday at ten,\u201d Dorothy went on. \u201cNo grand entrances. I told him if he arrived like a trumpet I would send him to the Oxfam up the road. Bring your ordinary. Wear good shoes because I will make you stand if I need to tell him how much kneecaps cost.\u201d Hannah agreed, and then put the phone in the drawer the way you put a fox in a shed; it was in there safely and you could hear it prowling anyway.\n\nThursday, she went. The morning had the thin beauty of biscuit tea. The shop smelled like old wool and soap and a little like last week\u2019s fish from the market drifting in because it always did. June had her leg up and her lip bravado. Dorothy stood like a general. He came in as if the threshold were higher than it had ever been. He had the look of a man who had never not been tall and who had spent years attempting to shrink. The face was the one she remembered and not, grief and weather and the relief of having no-one to perform for writing their own lines. He took off his hat. He held it. He held himself like a person arriving late to the theatre and trying not to be seen. He saw her. She saw him. They did not do the television thing of making it a picture that someone would keep. They did the human thing of saying each other\u2019s names as if they had to check they still worked in the mouth.\n\n\u201cTea,\u201d June said, with the iron-sweetness of people who have been kind for so long they use a different spice now. \u201cSugar?\u201d He looked at Hannah and she shook her head and he shook his, and Dorothy made three mugs like an offering and put a plate between them that said, in capital letters, CAKE, as if anyone was unclear on what squares of sweetness could do. He said sorry like a man who had tried the word on in private until it fitted. She did not know what to do with it because apologies are not debts you can count. She said thank you because manners were scaffolding and she needed something to hold on to. He told her that he had a life up the road and it had not been a tidy one and he did not make excuses because excuses are a littering habit. He said he had watched her and felt complicated, and she said \u201cMe too,\u201d and they did a small, precise smile that only people unsure of the content of their own chests can do.\n\nWhen she left the shop, Dorothy gave her a bag of picked-over paperbacks and said, \u201cThese are a prop in case anybody thinks you are a person who has never had to carry too much that didn\u2019t belong to you,\u201d and June kissed her palm and pressed it like a stamp. Outside, Dover had decided on bright. The sky treated their town like a thing worth making.\n\nOn Friday, Gal had regrown a rag-edge you could only see if you wanted to, and she wanted to. In class, they had a fire drill that did not feel like a drill to the Year 7 who had not yet learned that alarms are sometimes permission to chat and sometimes practice for not dying. She shepherded them into the cold and told a boy that he was not his panic, he was a person holding it, and he held it because she asked and because he could. Mr. Barnes wore his hi-vis vest like a coronation robe and counted with the bored omniscience of a man who had counted through wars. Ms. Davis confiscated chewing gum with a flourish. Mr. Shaw rescued a snail from a puddle with the care of a saint. The building let them back in because it held no grudge.\n\nThe programme wrote with more times, more rehearsals, more ideas you could say yes to without losing any of yourself you intended to keep. The MD handed her a new chart that looked like the same song had gone to a city and come back with a tattoo. Mr. Sands nodded at the hinge. The runner added a smiley face to her emails which meant she thought she and Hannah were friends now, and they were the sort of friends you become accidentally when you stand together in corridors holding other people\u2019s hopes on clipboards.\n\nOn Saturday night, when the town pretended at being a different town and girls with jackets for shoulders walked too fast on thin heels, she went to the Mariner and sang without cameras, and Maggie gave her the look that meant no nonsense and also six chips on the house because Maggie believed in appropriate salt. A man in the corner always, always called for Wonderwall and another man always shouted him down and they both grinned because rituals keep us from believing time is random. Hannah sang a song she had not sung in years, one her mother had left in a drawer of the house they had lived in before this one, and it worked because the room had decided it would. She saw one of her Year 11s in the doorway and they froze and then remembered who they were supposed to be in public and acted accordingly. They sent her a message later that implied she had not seen them and also that they were extremely impressed.\n\nSunday came heavy and went light. She went to London with the feeling that the part of the story after this would be different if she made it so, and that she could not, after all, make the sea do anything but what it did. Backstage, someone had spilled glitter and someone else had looked at it like a crime scene. She walked out and found the shape and did the thing and heard the room happen. When the result came\u2014because that is what these shows offer, an ending that isn\u2019t\u2014she felt the oddity she had not prepared for. She had been advanced; she had been chosen to go forward by the votes of a thousand living rooms and the calculation of two judges and a bit of luck, and she felt the relief and a nonsense grief for the people who would not go forward with her because you cannot carry everyone and that is unfair and exactly right.\n\nShe got home at dawn and let herself in and did the one thing that made sense. Before she put the kettle on, before she sent texts, before she allowed the day to stack its needs beside the sink, she fed the fish. They came like small suns. Gal arrived and performed a sensible arc. She tapped the glass and the sound was the same sound as ever, bell and nail, small and contained. \u201cWe won\u2019t let it unmake us,\u201d she told him, and he turned and vanished into his own water as if to say that he, at least, had figured that out. She made tea and stood at the window and watched Dover rehearse itself into the morning with the confidence of a town that has survived worse news and better and will again. She had songs to learn, she had books to mark, she had a father\u2019s number in her phone and a mother\u2019s voice in her ear and a fish with a fin like a flag not yet at full mast, and for once, she could stand in the middle of all of it and not feel like she needed permission. The gulls were up and ridiculous. The ferry sounded softly, a held note. She breathed and let the day happen the way weather happens\u2014quietly and then all at once.Chapter 9\n\nBy the time Monday decided what to be, the town had already chosen its mood. Dover went with a blue that wanted to be taken seriously and a wind that kept trying the doorhandles. Hannah woke to the kettle\u2019s old sermon and the cat on the windowsill doing its impression of a saint wronged. She made tea and fed the fish before she remembered to stand in front of the day and agree to it. Gal came up from the greenery in a measured way, not the swaggering charge of a week ago, and his tail had lost some of its raggedness, the edge silked back into itself like a torn shirt mended by a patient hand. He ate and did not perform, which in its own universe was a vow.\n\nThe email for the week had arrived in the night with times and rooms and the confident tone of a person writing down a tide table and believing it. Tuesday: press. Thursday: rehearsal. Sunday: show. The producer had written, lightly, Remember to breathe, and Hannah found herself annoyed and grateful because she possessed a professional stubbornness about being told to do the things she was already doing to stay alive. She put her hand on the banister as she left the flat, said thank you to nobody in particular like a person salting steps against ice, and went down into a morning that had put its collar on straight.\n\nSchool was a machine too big to have feelings and yet somehow had them. The first bell made its own weather. A piece of paper on the staffroom table announced a bake sale in aid of something the geography department had started calling The Earth. Ms. Davis had expanded her Resilience Clinic hours and was already presiding at a table with a queue, dispensing stern permission slips for courage. Mr. Shaw had a new tie in a shade of porridge that suggested porridge had ambitions. Mr. Barnes moved down the corridor in his natural state, which was triumphant containment. In 9C, the fish engine hummed like a small vow and the board was clean. She wrote, under the date, A sentence is a kind of kindness if you let it be, and under that: Macbeth: the bits we missed because we were busy being brilliant.\n\nThey worked that first period with a steadiness that might have been boring if you had been untrained in the art of noticing. Noah introduced a clause that threatened to overwhelm the sentence and then cut it with a small show of grief and pride that only people who love commas can pull off. Safia sat differently, her chin up at an angle that suggested she was, for today, keeping several feelings in alphabetical order. A boy who had never understood that grammar was just a way to share a brain with someone else wrote four lines that were less like showing off and more like standing next to someone without startling them. The room warmed, not temperature so much as agreement.\n\nAt break a note came through the vaguely functioning internal post like a message in a bottle. Dorothy, said the front in her crabbed hand, and inside was the summary you would want from a person who made summaries out of chaos for a living. He will be in Thursday at ten, it said. He will be sorry at a level that may or may not be useful. You will be kind at a level that may or may not be wise. Bring biscuits. We will need ballast. Hannah folded the note and put it on top of the exercise books for 9C like a talisman. She lifted it, because you cannot ask talismans to carry actual work, and put it in her pocket.\n\nShe did the Tuesday publicity with a practiced wariness and a fledgling ease. A producer took them to the east pier for a shot that would never behave, gulls heckling like MPs and wind insisting on hair as theatre. The camerawoman with the nose ring, who had now become Hannah\u2019s favourite because she did her job without needing to be seen doing it, filmed Hannah walking along the railings as if the railings had written to request it. They filmed the tank again with extreme tenderness, and the sound man spoke reverently into his furry microphone as if it were a small animal that would be offended by lies. They placed a light in her classroom that made the dust look like a choice. She let them, because sometimes you can tell when somebody is borrowing the truth and not stealing it.\n\nIn the corridor afterward, a man with a lanyard asked for a comment about her journey and Ms. Davis walked past and said briskly, \u201cIt\u2019s a noun that has been tortured,\u201d and everyone laughed the slightly wicked laugh of people who needed to move the world forward a fraction and knew the only available lever was humour. The local paper sent a boy so new he had elbows for personality and he asked Hannah if she had any regrets. \u201cLoads,\u201d she said, because it was the only honest answer and because she liked to leave a young journalist with a clean sentence even if it made no headline.\n\nThe producer rang the next day to talk about the final song in a tone that pretended it wasn\u2019t called a final. \u201cWe\u2019re hearing it with a swell,\u201d she said, clicking a pen like a metronome. \u201cNot a syrupy one. Something that says ferry, not wedding. The MD is thinking low brass, a suggestion of horn, the sound that holds the bottom of a room up when a voice gets brave.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot a trumpet,\u201d Hannah said, thinking of men on small stages doing too much with their cheeks. \u201cSomething that remembers being useful in fog.\u201d\n\n\u201cExactly,\u201d the woman said, relieved as if somebody had named the weather. \u201cAnd as for the set\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNo children,\u201d Hannah said, because she would not let her classroom be converted into a moral she didn\u2019t control. \u201cBut a board. A line of light. Something chalky that isn\u2019t literal chalk. And if you can make the hum, you can have it. If you can\u2019t, we go simple and let the sound do the work.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe hum,\u201d the woman repeated, half laughing, half determined. \u201cGod help us, we\u2019re staging hum. I\u2019ll have props and lighting cry into their lattes and then make me proud.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, she put on a coat that made her look like the sort of person who returned phone calls on time and went to the charity shop at ten. It felt too early for reconciliation and exactly right for tea. June had reorganised the shelves with her own logic, biographies next to whisk recipes and a stack of crime novels smiling at a broken clock. Dorothy stood behind the till like a bouncer at a church fete. He came in as if the bell didn\u2019t want to ring for him. He had a hat because men like him think hats make them better behaved. He took it off and held it, which was almost a prayer. He had her mouth and somebody else\u2019s sorrow. He said her name like a listener testing a speaker. She said his like she was making a list and stumbled over nothing and considered it a victory that her voice didn\u2019t wobble around the edge of old.\n\nThey sat on the chairs that had belonged to a wedding and a church and now to the general public. Dorothy brought tea with the moral heft of a union leader and put the plate of cake between them as if marking on a map where conversations can pivot. He said sorry with less drama than television would want and more care than she had given him credit for. He mentioned a town up the road, a job in a place that smelled of oil and time, the years he had spent talking himself out of movies in which he knocked on doors and was considerate at last. He did not ask for forgiveness as if it were a prescription. He put a card on the table as if he might be asked for proof of existence. He laughed once at himself and did not linger in the laugh as men sometimes do when they are pleased with their own charm. He looked at June the way a man looks at a mountain he did not climb because the weather he had brought was wrong.\n\nJune was magnificent and ordinary, which is to say she did not make of the moment a statue. She poured tea and enquired after weather and handed him the biscuit with the most jam like a queen and would not have him say more than the room could hold without cracking. \u201cWe like you alive,\u201d she said, when he said he did not deserve it, and that seemed to satisfy her terms. He asked if he could hear Hannah sing in a room that was not on the television and Hannah said yes in the restrained, risky way of someone who had decided to be specific. \u201cThe Mariner,\u201d she said. \u201cSaturday. Maggie has rules. And chips. Chips most of all.\u201d\n\nWhen she left them, the sky over the High Street had gone fat with possibility. She carried an empty shopping bag so she would look like a person on an errand and not like a person who had changed the way she carried her own past. She went back to school through the narrow bit where the wall leaned in and down the stairs, touching the banister twice on the same journey for luck or because she couldn\u2019t help it.\n\nIn 9C, Noah was trying to build a sentence that could carry a thought without collapsing and was making the face of a person who insists on carrying the wardrobe alone. \u201cTwo verbs,\u201d she told him, gentle with the truth and stingy with unnecessary mercy. \u201cOne of them can carry. One must sit down.\u201d He snorted and made the cut and then pretended the relief belonged to nobody. Safia rolled her eyes at a line in Macbeth and then read it out like she had written it and wanted feedback, which is as much as you can ask of anyone. At the end of the period, a girl who never spoke first walked up and said, \u201cMiss, when you\u2019re on the telly and they clap at the wrong time, it annoys me. Not because it\u2019s wrong, just because it\u2019s wrong. Anyway.\u201d She left, and Hannah stood a moment longer to feel the gift of that wrong-shaped confidence being handed over with a shrug.\n\nThe set rehearsal on Thursday was a lesson in faith placed in people who have a religion called Lighting. The props team had made dust without making it sentimental. The sound tech had found a hum in a box and then tuned it so it felt like a building breathing. The MD stood with his low brass and his string section and in the half-light the instruments made shadows that looked like old ships. They tried the first verse in a key that made her voice brace and then undo, and she said, quietly because you do not shout at people trying to help you, \u201cOne lower,\u201d and he nodded because this was the work and not a favour. The bell they had argued about came once like a coin under water and because it was not forced it didn\u2019t make her hate it. She stepped into the hinge and this time handled it without stepping on its foot. The second quiet\u2014that was last week\u2019s trick. The third was a room you had to find without eyes. She felt it open somewhere between her chest and the part of the stage she might have claimed if she were a different woman. She sat down in it and did not apologise.\n\nFriday, the tank decided to have an opinion. She came in from a lunch duty that had involved persuading a group of Year 8 boys that arguing about crisps loudly does not make them philosophers, and heard a sound that did not belong. The filter was working too hard or not hard enough; she couldn\u2019t tell with machines that lived under water. Gal hung in the corner with the program of a man who wanted to be left alone to make his own foolish mistakes. She turned off the lamp, turned it on again, watched the bubbles. Mr. Shaw arrived like luck and leaned down so hard his tie dipped and came up printed with flecks like confetti. \u201cWe\u2019ll syphon,\u201d he said, the way you say \u201cWe\u2019ll march\u201d if you have a different kind of job. He produced a tube from a cupboard that shouldn\u2019t have contained it and a bucket that had once held custard and the air in the room changed from panic to a plan.\n\nSafia and Noah were deputised as junior aquarists and took the roles with the gravity of an emergency. \u201cSpa, not disco,\u201d Hannah reminded them, and they worked as if the phrase had been part of a sacred text. Water slid obediently into the bucket and the bucket into the sink and the sink tried to be helpful. Gal, to his credit, did not take the opportunity to make himself into a Greek tragedy; he held his water and his temper. When they had refilled and salted and turned the lamp down to mood rather than theatre, the tank settled into its hum like a person into a chair. \u201cWe can\u2019t fix everything,\u201d Mr. Shaw said, not looking at her, because kindness does not make eye contact while it\u2019s being the truth. \u201cBut we can keep the water decent.\u201d\n\nThe Mariner on Saturday smelled like a decision. Maggie pretended to be cross about the televisions and was actually pleased, and she announced to the bar that \u201cthe rules still apply\u201d as if she were guarding over a moral code and a jukebox. Hannah wore ordinary clothes that looked deceptive in their effort, and when she sang the first song the room behaved itself like a Wednesday church that had understood the sermon. In the second, she saw the door open and a hat appear and the man under it fail to come in and she sang anyway because she had not changed the rule that you do not chase people into rooms they have not chosen. Dorothy, who had honed the art of seeing without intruding, ghosted into the doorway at the same moment and performed a glance that asked a question and got the answer it had expected; she nodded, went back to June, and left the door ajar. Hannah closed her eyes long enough to feel the ache and not long enough to make a theatre of it. She opened them and the room gave her back to herself with the usual gifts, the chips and the laughter and the man who always wanted Wonderwall and the man who always forbade it and their little play inside her bigger one, which was all any of them could reasonably carry.\n\nThe Sunday of the final refused to behave like a special day. It was the same kettle and the same thin light through her kitchen blind and the same cat with the opinion of a baronet. June sent a text that was an emoji of a potato because she had discovered them in her phone and would not be dissuaded. Ms. Davis sent a picture of a pencil like a baton. Mr. Barnes sent a photograph of a tie that looked illegal. Mr. Sands sent no picture, only words: Sit differently. The MD sent a link to a clip of a cello being tuned in a church and a sentence that said, oddly, this is the hum. Dorothy sent, briskly, Weather fine at ten today. Your father not dead. Your mother very alive. Don\u2019t trip.\n\nBackstage had learned her shape by now and did not jostle. The runner with the clipboard had spent her week on other people\u2019s accounts of fear and had not lost her manners; she handed Hannah a microphone like a chalice and said, \u201cWe\u2019ve lit the hum,\u201d and did not laugh at herself. The brass did their private rituals, oil and breath and grimaces. The strings were warm. The bell waited to be rung and did not mind whether it was in a song or a desk somewhere. The stage manager checked the tape marks on the floor as if they were a low code for a landing. The light guy had found a way to make the dust glint once and then forget itself, which was the line between sentimentality and art and he had managed to step on the right side of it. Hannah stood in the wings and thought of all her banisters and in doing so made a rope with them and found she could hold it. She thought of the tank, which now made peace reliably enough to be taken for granted, and of Gal, who had chosen, in recent days, the path of ordinary life as a means of carrying on. She thought of her father\u2019s hat in a doorway and of her mother\u2019s peas and of a house where a cupboard was closed and wouldn\u2019t cry until later.\n\nThey called her name without ceremony because the ceremony is the bit that costs and her portion had already been spent on light. She stepped out and placed her feet where the tape said the world would hold them. The audience went to the place they had learned to go when a song began to make a room without their help. She put the first word on the board inside her head and watched it write itself in a hand she recognised. The brass under her didn\u2019t elbow; they shouldered. The strings laid a tablecloth and stood back. She breathed for the length of a ferry\u2019s horn and began.\n\nShe let the second verse pick up the day and put it down without breaking the handle. The third quiet came like a corridor you had to go down alone and she went down it and found at the end a window she could open with one hand. She felt the bell arrive the way you feel a guest you were dreading surprise you by wiping their feet. The room did the right sound. The judges did their jobs. She did not look at them. She looked up where the dust lived and told the dust something without words about second chances and small engines and ferries that come when they say they will, and then she lifted the last words off the table as if they were a good plate and you were closing the kitchen for the night.\n\nThere were the noises. There always are. Approval. The particular applause that is relief pretending to be celebration. The voice of a man who gets paid to turn his feelings into an instruction telling people to vote. The red light where the camera lived like an obedient star. She said the appropriate sentences to a presenter whose kindness was real enough to be useful. The panel said sentences that would make sense in other kitchens later. She left by the door you leave when you\u2019re needed somewhere else. In a corridor, the runner put her hand on Hannah\u2019s arm for a thickness of a second and said, \u201cGood,\u201d and nobody argued with her, which, in television, is almost a miracle.\n\nOn the train home, she turned her phone over and back on the little table as if it were a coin deciding what to be. Messages piled on each other like puppies; she sorted them with the practiced absence of a teacher marking thirty books in an hour, lightly, while saving the heavy attention for what plainly needed it. June sent a photograph of Dorothy asleep on the charity shop sofa in a position that suggested she had won a fight with gravity. Mr. Barnes had recorded his television saying \u201cMiss Flint\u201d out loud and sent her the clip with the caption: I have trained the machine. Ms. Davis had written, Resilience clinic fully booked. Will now be franchising. Mr. Sands had written only, Nice chair, by which he meant: you sat differently and it worked. Her father had written, Only cried once, and she put her head in her scarf for a moment because she had not thought to measure herself against that unit.\n\nDover was cold and clean and unfazed when she arrived back in it, which helped. The cat considered the question of appearing surprised and decided it was beneath her. The dress for once did not get the chair; it went straight to a hanger like a person with a mortgage. She put the kettle on and stood at the window, the old indulgence of watching a town practice being itself before she rejoined it. She slept without needing to talk herself into it, coin-drop, cool.\n\nMonday decided it wanted to be mostly Year 9. They arrived with news written on their foreheads and a craving for ordinary like you crave salt. Safia had perfected an eyebrow that said you had done well without endorsing anything that might embarrass her; she did it twice, which amounted to parental approval. Noah had written a letter to his future self that contained a joke so dreadful it made its own weather and an instruction to remember how to breathe on trains; he pretended he had written it for homework and not because of feeling. A boy whose talent was to laugh loudly at the wrong time managed to sit through the hinge of a poem without exploding and then went out into the corridor and ran a lap to disperse the pressure. In the tank, Gal did a tour like a general reassuring his troops that, sorry, the hum will continue. There was a lurch at lunchtime because someone had written something about her online that stung for six minutes and seventy-two hours at once, and Ms. Davis confiscated her phone the way she confiscated gum and handed it back with the authority of a pharmacist. \u201cOne an hour,\u201d she said. \u201cOr you will rot your teeth.\u201d\n\nThere were practicalities because real life is always practicalities no matter how the lights behave elsewhere. She did an inventory of glue sticks and found it wanting. She set detention for three people who had done nothing wrong except perform their despair at the wrong time and she sat with them while they did their homework as if they had meant to. She filled in a spreadsheet that pretended to track meaning. She called a parent and said, carefully, that their child was nearly a poem. She met with the head and the woman with concerns and left with less bureaucracy and more cake than she had thought possible.\n\nThe message from the programme that night had a different colour to it; victory and its obligations threaded through the lines. Schedules with earlier mornings, rehearsals that would demand her other hands. There would be a filmed piece in Dover, with the permission of those willing, about where she sang when nobody listened and she put a stop sign on the charity shop by writing a single sentence: My mother does not belong to you. The producer, to her credit, wrote back, Absolutely, and added three hearts and the phrase, Against form, which made Hannah like her more.\n\nIn the quiet square of late, when the cat had admitted defeat and slept unguarded and the radiators sighed like an old ship docking, she took out the card from her father and held it under the lamp. He had a number and the barest bones of a signature and a blot where the pen had refused and he had forced it. She dialled because she did not like to teach children courage and not model it at least in small, survivable amounts. It rang. He answered with the startled sound of someone not used to receiving anything he wanted. They arranged tea without saying the word sorry again, which felt sane. \u201cThe pier caf\u00e9,\u201d he said, grateful to have a noun to hide behind, and she said \u201cYes,\u201d and then they hung up before politeness could get in the way.\n\nHe was there on Wednesday with his hat and everything he had not known how to offer. The pier caf\u00e9 remembered him without permission because buildings keep secrets and refuse to divulge unless asked kindly. They chose a table by the window where the light forgave them both. He told her a story about a ferry he had nearly missed in 1993 and the woman he had admired on it for three hours and the fact that when the ferry docked he had not followed her because the idea of her had become something else and his courage had been spent on making the story instead. He told her a smaller story about a budgie he had kept for a winter when Hanna was little and then given away because its happiness had become a mirror. He didn\u2019t explain the metaphor because the caf\u00e9 would not have survived it. He asked her, halting, for a selection of nothing that added up to permission. She gave him some. He did not press her for more. He looked at her mouth when she spoke as if to reassure himself that it still worked like his did. He paid and pretended not to. They left together and gave the gulls a thing to comment on and parted before the point where they might have tried to fix more than a morning could hold.\n\nIt was a good day to teach Macbeth. The class took delight in the witchy bits in a way that would have concerned the medieval but was perfectly healthy in a building with three fire extinguishers per floor. \u201cVaulting ambition, which o\u2019erleaps itself and falls on the other,\u201d Hannah wrote, and Safia muttered under her breath that sometimes ambition just tripped on a step and made a noise and kept going, which felt like a modern footnote. Noah asked whether Macbeth would have been happier as a teacher and then answered himself with a brisk \u201cNo,\u201d which made the room exhale. They drew lines on the board not because they were making graphs but because sometimes you need to make a visible path between a feeling and a word.\n\nOn Thursday, the programme came with a small swarm to film conversations they would later call \u201cpackages,\u201d and 9C pretended to be uninterested while clearly measuring how this would accumulate into story. Mr. Barnes held the line like a man on a towpath and the crew were good and careful and took off their hats again. The boy with the loud laugh pressed his lips tight until the camera went past and then was released and laughed the laugh of a person who had survived being quiet in public. They filmed the outside of the school and the inside of the sea and something in between, and even Ms. Davis admitted in the staffroom afterward that the nose-ringed camerawoman had an eye for hum and left the biscuit plate suspiciously emptier than before, which was as close as she got to a compliment.\n\nThe final rehearsal in London was less about notes now and more about spine. The MD did not stop the band between phrases to fix; he adjusted air. \u201cFrom the breath,\u201d he kept saying, not because he was in love with a metaphor but because he had made a habit of being right. The stage manager marked the places where panic tends to pool, the corners and the middle and the bit where your shoe snags on tape that was not there yesterday. The runner now knew her tea order and the fact that before walking out Hannah liked the feel of a pencil in her pocket even though there was nothing to write on out there; she put one there without comment and ticked a box you will not find on any form.\n\nSaturday night, Dover did its best impression of a different town again and put pinks in the sky it couldn\u2019t afford. The Mariner was full of a kind of pride that did not require anybody to lower their eyes. Maggie gave Hannah a look that said no nonsense and everything and handed her a piece of bread that felt medicinal. A man in a corner wiped his eyes and nobody saw him do it. A girl from Year 11 thought she was invisible until Hannah waved at her and then remembered she was supposed to be someone else in public and posed, badly, for a selfie she would later pretend had been ironic. Hannah sang a song that had more air than sound in it, because the room would let her, and a woman from Wales who was nobody\u2019s aunt gave her a hug afterward that smelled of lamb fat and laundry and left her steadier than she had any right to be.\n\nSunday morning she put her coat on and did the thing she had done enough times now that the place between nerves and ritual had become habitable. Tea. Fish. Hand on banister. The hum. She went to London and the city pretended it had been waiting. In the wings she put her hand flat on the wall and thanked it, because she had become a person who thanked bricks. The MD looked at her and did not say good luck, because men like him do not believe luck should take the credit. He lifted his hand and she nodded and they both had the unglamorous look of people who are about to do exactly what they said they would do.\n\nOut there, the hum had been installed. The board shone because someone had wiped it down with a ferocity usually reserved for sins. The light lay on the fake carpet like a real one waits for the day\u2019s first foot. She stepped into her mark and spoke the first line into a room that had agreed, for a handful of minutes, to be a classroom without walls, and the sound went up and came down and didn\u2019t break, and the show did what shows have done for a hundred years in halls with dusty curtains and cavernous ceilings and had the decency to get out of the way.\n\nLater, on the train that was rapidly becoming a second living room, her phone would buzz with a message from a stranger that said, in the rough grammar of someone who valued urgency over correctness, \u201cYou made me think. And I\u2019m not a thinker. Don\u2019t tell my husband.\u201d June would send a photo of a potato that had been carved into a heart because someone had come into the charity shop that afternoon with nothing to do and too many knives, and Dorothy would caption it, Art, and add, in a second message, He doesn\u2019t wear the hat indoors, marriage saved. Mr. Barnes would send a video of his tie hanging over the end of his banister like a flag at half mast and a line: We will require cake. Ms. Davis would send nothing but leave a pencil on Hannah\u2019s desk the next morning, point sharpened, eraser unused, and the resilience clinic would have a sign-up sheet with three pages of names, none of whom were in need of anything a biscuit could not at least begin to address. Mr. Shaw would tie a new tie in the morning because porridge, left unsupervised, is a destiny.\n\nBefore all that, though, there was the night and the step and the hush and the hinge and the bell and the line where breath became note and note became a room and the room became, for once, a place where she could put down everything she was carrying and not be asked for a receipt. The ferries would still move; the gulls would still scream like a committee; the fish would still discover the same filter and not be disappointed. She would still go back and mark the subordinate clause and explain to a child that sometimes the moral of a story is that you are tired and you should go to sleep. She would still answer the phone to her father and say, Yes, tea, the pier caf\u00e9, two sugars for nobody. She would still make a note and put it on her kitchen table that nobody would see: Feed fish. Breathe. Okay. She would still laugh at herself for needing instructions and then follow them like a person who had finally decided to be kind.\n\nIt was when she was standing in her kitchen later, the dress hung up like evidence, the cat deciding whether to purr or litigate, that the email arrived with the sort of subject line that knows it is important and has not yet learned humility. Congratulations, it said, and gave a time and a date and a list of obligations that would reshape her next month like weather. The finals would not be a single night but a campaign. She had become a person whose life would, temporarily, be written as a schedule and she was not frightened in the way she had expected to be. She took it in and turned off the light and went to the window and looked at Dover being exactly Dover. The ferry sounded an old note. In the tank, the engine hummed like a promise made by someone ordinary and kept. She put her hand to the glass and Gal came, not because love works like that but because hunger and light do, and she laughed at the analogy and forgave herself the cheapness and went to bed.\n\nThe next days did that trick time does when it knows you\u2019re watching: they went both slow and very fast. In school, they diagrammed sentences because sentences are the bones of courage, and when Noah tried to add a fourth clause as if making an argument louder made it right, she raised an eyebrow he had learned to respect and he sighed and cut it and beamed without admitting it. Safia wrote an essay that ended with a question and then a statement and then crossed out the question, a victory of discipline over drama that could have been taught but had in the end been decided. A boy who was not a reader came in carrying a paperback as if it were a mug that might spill, and when she asked him why he had it he said, as if confessing to a crime, \u201cIt had a dragon,\u201d and she nodded because all decent roads begin with dragons. The resilience clinic introduced a sign that read: You are allowed to bring a friend. You are not allowed to bring a flame thrower. The graph of improvement grew like vines around the windows of Room 12. Ms. Davis adjusted a cape none of them could see and took attendance as if it were a sacrament.\n\nIn Dover, the charity shop saw a run on dresses for weddings that had not yet been proposed. June presided like a benevolent weather front, and the shop briefly became a station where half of town came to admit small hopes and be assigned a price sticker appropriate to their budget. Dorothy wrote a sign that said: Advice is free. Sarcasm is extra. Remarkably few people paid, perhaps because Dorothy, when asked, refused to accept anything but cake.\n\nLondon asked for more of her than it had before and she said yes without bleeding in public. The MD added a thread of harmony that made the bell look over its shoulder. The low brass did a rehearsal with the door open and a man from a different show put his head in, frowned, and then nodded and walked on as if checking the weather for a trip he had not yet booked. The runner with the clipboard had officially run out of battery and yet somehow kept going, her hair now permanently part of the communications system. A wardrobe woman with the bite of a good sister insisted on different shoes because you cannot stand in that place wearing hope alone; your feet will have opinions.\n\nOn a Thursday that started with rain and the taste of metal and ended with a rainbow that refused to be twee because it had to exist somewhere, her father sent a photograph of a mug with a tea stain on a saucer and the edge of a newspaper and a line: Three things I brought with me to the coast: a book I pretended to read, a regret I\u2019ve stopped polishing, and a thermos. I wouldn\u2019t mind if I had to share the thermos one day. She sent back a picture of a pencil and a kettle and a fish, and he replied with a series of question marks that made her smile in spite of her caution. June, uninvited to that exchange, texted an entirely unnecessary warning about men and the way they mistake showing up for penance and then undercut herself with, Bring potatoes Sunday. Dorothy, not given to subtlety, wrote: You\u2019re allowed to send him for milk and not say thank you.\n\nWhen the call sheet for the final-final came through, it had that alarming link of columns and obligations that had once made her think of air traffic control and now made her think of school timetables; confusing until lived, then automatic. They wanted an interview where she talked about what singing had saved her from. She wrote back and said in as many words that the interesting thing was that teaching had saved her, too, and where would they like to put that, and the producer sent a reply composed entirely of exclamation marks and the word Yes, repeated until it bored even itself and became moving. They wanted a shot of her in the empty classroom after the last bell, and she told them to take off their hats, and they did, and the room agreed to be a television for twenty minutes and then returned to itself as if television were a weather that passed.\n\nThe cat, because it was not owned by anyone\u2019s narrative, developed a cough that lasted briefly and with a drama that threatened to destabilise the entire week and then disappeared as if purchased, used, and returned. The neighbour upstairs continued to do soundproofing to an unknown end result. The banister continued to offer itself and she continued to take it. The fish hummed. The engine hummed. The town hummed. The song in her chest hummed. She went to London and said yes to a microphone and no to a director who wanted her to turn and look at the camera on the word love, politely, because that was a stage direction her body would not obey without lying. She opted for speaking the word as if it were an object you set down carefully, and he threw his hands up and said, \u201cFine, fine, art,\u201d and then turned to terrorise somebody who had wanted to be terrified.\n\nOn the night itself\u2014the last one they would count and then insist meant the most\u2014she stood in the wing and thought of the cards she had been dealt and the ones she had refused and the ones she had not even seen on the table. She felt the hinge under her feet as a promise and not a trap. She lifted her head because Mr. Sands would have said so and she had learned that listening to him made a life easier in ways that were not always musical. She went out into the light and said the first line in the voice of a person who knew that endings are sluttish things and will go where they want, and she did not begrudge them. She asked the room for a quiet that was not silence but a kind of attention, and the room, small miracle of strangers, gave it. She stepped through and did not fall.\n\nWhatever was going to happen that night happened the way wind happens\u2014according to rules and without them. Someone would win and she might not and it would be both important and not. She would go back to school and tell Noah to be kind to his adverbs and tell Safia that she could hold the middle of an argument without declaring war. She would go to the pier caf\u00e9 and drink tea with a man who had been late his whole life and had brought a thermos as proof of intention. She would stand in a charity shop and be assigned a price that would make someone believe in their own reflection for an hour. She would watch a fish regrow himself into something like grace. She would put her hand on the banister and feel it cool under her palm and think, every time, of all the ways you can go down without falling.\n\nAnd when, very late and then too early, she woke up into the sad sweetness of after, she would feed the fish before she made tea because that was the order that made sense to her, and Gal would present himself like a small sun and take what she gave and swim on like an agreement made between two creatures who had never met in the wild and were making this one up. She would stand by the window and watch the ferry do its slow and faithful work and think that the best part of any of this had not been the applause or the lights but the moment in a room when somebody had listened and changed a molecule and everything around it had had to rearrange to make room. She would hold that in the way you hold heat in your pockets when it is January and the town cannot help you with the cold. She would go to school. She would be the person with the chalk. She would hum. She would make weather and let weather be made. She would not forget, because forgetting would have felt like a betrayal and she had had enough of those to last all her lives.",

                              "content": "At dawn, Dover pretended to be a postcard again. The chalk edge of the cliff cut the sky cleanly; the gulls were already up and arguing about something nobody else could get worked up about, and the sea, in its endless shrug, slapped against the harbour wall as if to say, there you go, have another go, let\u2019s see. Hannah had been awake since five-thirty. It wasn\u2019t nerves, not exactly. Just that a thread ran through her\u2014silver, taut\u2014that pulled her up out of bed before the alarm, tugging her along toward the day.\n\nShe made tea and stood by the kitchen window, sipping it black. Her terrace had a view of the ferry lanes if she craned a bit, and when she did, a ship the size of a quiet thought drifted across the rectangle of sea. Somewhere, inside that big white thing full of strangers and cartons of goods and thick ropes and blinking lights, somebody was probably also drinking tea, scalding their lip, thinking about a Tuesday that had arrived just like that. Hannah smiled at the idea that her own thoughts might be mirrored by some passing stranger. It made the morning softer.\n\nIn the classroom, the tidy fish tank hummed. The filter kept up its ghost-whisper, the heater lamp glowed like a tiny amber sun. Inside, her small geniuses flickered: neon tetras, wobbly zebra danios, and six guppies that had started out as three. Babies spent half their lives getting born, Hannah thought. People spent the other half finding their way back to a place where they could be simple again. She untied her scarf and hung it on the back of the chair. On the whiteboard she wrote the day and a quote in peculiar purple: \u201cLiterature is news that stays news.\u201d \u2014Ezra Pound. Then, underneath, in smaller script: Plus, we will not set the classroom on fire today, 9C.\n\n\u201cPromise me,\u201d she said out loud to the empty desks.\n\nThe guppy with the stubby dorsal, the one with a blotch like a thumbprint on his tail, waggled nearer to the glass and gave her a hard little bead eye. This was the boss of the guppies; she\u2019d named him after a soldier from an old story she loved. Galahad was too grand. She shortened it. Gal.\n\n\u201cMorning, Gal,\u201d she told him. \u201cBe kind to the others today. No nipping. Not hilarious. Not cute.\u201d\n\nHe flicked sideways, showed her his sheen, and took a ceremonial bite at a bubble. He was the most temperamental of her small universe. If fish could brood, Gal brooded, tiny and serious. The science teacher down the hall had told her guppies could be territorial in tanks, and sometimes, if they saw their reflection, they\u2019d posture at it all day. \u201cLike men in gyms,\u201d Mr. Shaw had said, balancing microwaved porridge and optimism in one hand.\n\nIt was, properly, Mr. Shaw who had introduced the tank as a calming presence for the students\u2014well-being, reduced anxiety, regulated breathing. But feeding them had become Hannah\u2019s small meditation. The students thought she\u2019d set up the tank to teach them empathy, which was a pleasant rumor she never corrected.\n\nThe first bell spilled bodies along the corridor. Teenagers arrived in drifts, hair damp, shoes squeaking. They came into her room carrying armfuls of their waking lives: a basketball, the taste of rushed toast, a worry about a family member said sideways. She saw it all like flash cards. They were hers. Not really, not legally or forever, but for being thirteen and fourteen and hopelessly proud about washing their face now and then, they belonged to her for sixty minutes a day. She was both carried and tugged by this\u2014she didn\u2019t go around naming it love in case anybody overheard and thought she might be weak.\n\n\u201cMiss Flint, Miss Flint,\u201d Noah said, two steps into the room, skipping the whole greeting scheme. \u201cIf a character lies to another character, and then something bad happens to them, do we assume the author is telling us lying is bad?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhoa,\u201d she said. \u201cGood morning to you too. Put your bag down, Noah. Do we assume that?\u201d\n\n\u201cI did in the homework,\u201d he said, in a way that was both hopeful and defensive. \u201cDo not call my mother.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the author is telling you that choices have consequences. But lying isn\u2019t always wrong in literature, or in life. Sometimes it saves someone.\u201d\n\nSafia came past and rolled her eyes at the fish. \u201cMiss, that one\u2019s aggy.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh?\u201d Hannah looked at Gal, who was indeed performing a tiny, indignant dance at the glass.\n\n\u201cI walked past and he swam at me like he wanted beef,\u201d Safia said, twirling her pen. \u201cHe knows what he did.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe knows nothing,\u201d Hannah said. \u201cHe\u2019s a fish.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Safia smirked. \u201cBecause he seems to know something. He\u2019s got that look.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have that look,\u201d Noah muttered, flipping open his English folder, where he always drew a little dragon in the top corner before he wrote a sentence.\n\nIt was a good class. For most of the period, they did not set anything on fire. They argued, with zeal, about whether Macbeth was a weak man pushed by a violent woman, or a violent man full stop. They wrote in that fervent way they had, where their handwriting went sideways as if chasing a thought down a corridor. When she read what they wrote, she saw little glimmers. Not genius, not the kind you could swallow whole and be saved by forever. She saw care. Care looked like the moment a student crossed out an extra adjective and left a sentence cleaner. Care looked like when the boy with the loudest laugh stayed quiet because he\u2019d seen that the girl next to him needed the room to speak.\n\nHalfway through the lesson, the headteacher knocked and leaned in as if the door were a curtain and this was a stage. Mr. Barnes always had the air of a man stepping onto a platform to announce an arrival. He had tried to retire three times and failed all three, and there was rumor that the school would end before he did. The way children continued to believe in him and also did not believe in anything else, that was something.\n\n\u201cAh! The Bard\u2019s emissaries,\u201d he boomed, then lowered his voice when he saw the plan on the board. \u201cMiss Flint, could you quickly pop into the staffroom at break?\u201d\n\n\u201cCertainly,\u201d she said. He gave a small bow to the fish tank before he left, because for all his bluster he was fundamentally a person who took things to heart.\n\nAt break, she left the room in Safia\u2019s charge with a warning about the fish. \u201cNobody taps on the glass,\u201d she said, and then saw three hands drop, guilty. \u201cAnd if Gal starts to act like he\u2019s running the place, remind him who pays the water bill. Sit. And absolutely do not set anything on\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cFire, Miss,\u201d they chorused, gleeful. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nThe staffroom was in that state between a war and a potluck. Coffee, biscuits, papers. Two flyers stuck on the noticeboard: one for yoga, one for CPR training. Somebody had drawn a moustache on the CPR dummy in the photograph. Mr. Shaw was bent over his phone, a smear of porridge on his tie like he\u2019d been kissed by breakfast.\n\n\u201cI saw you at the Mariner on Friday,\u201d he said when he looked up. \u201cYou didn\u2019t say you were performing. You were marvelous.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was not,\u201d she said, too quick, and then she wanted to laugh at herself. \u201cBut thank you.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou did this\u2026 something with your voice. That song, what was it?\u201d\n\n\u201cTraditional,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know the title. My mum used to sing versions of it when I was small. I think it\u2019s Irish. Or Welsh. Or it just pretends to be everything.\u201d\n\nMr. Barnes appeared with a plate of two custard creams, which he presented to her as if awarding a medal. \u201cHannah,\u201d he said, \u201cyou\u2019re avoiding the subject as usual.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, are we having an intervention?\u201d She took the biscuits. She felt absurdly seen. \u201cIs this about my addiction to chalk, because\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about your singing,\u201d he said, softening. \u201cYou\u2019re an English teacher pretending to be only an English teacher. Meanwhile, half the town have recorded you on their phones. Do something with it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat would I do?\u201d\n\n\u201cApply,\u201d Mr. Shaw said. \u201cBritain\u2019s Got Talent. You think we don\u2019t have Wi-Fi in this school? I\u2019ve seen the adverts. I\u2019ve seen you sing. You could. Couldn\u2019t she?\u201d\n\nIn the corner, Ms. Davis from Maths looked up from marking and made a face like she\u2019d bit into a lemon and liked it. \u201cI haven\u2019t got telly since 2004. But I\u2019d watch if you were on, Hannah.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to be one of those teachers who goes on telly and the kids find it and they clip it and slow it down and make it into a meme where I look like a chicken.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat will happen no matter what you do,\u201d Mr. Barnes said kindly. \u201cYou can either become a chicken on a big stage, or a chicken on a small one.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hate you all,\u201d she said, and bit the biscuit. She wasn\u2019t really upset. The thought of it loosened something. The thought terrified her, made her heart full with panic as if someone had plugged her into the shore power for a ferry. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I have marking. And parents\u2019 evening. And the fish.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe fish will rally,\u201d Mr. Shaw said. \u201cWe\u2019ll feed them.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot you,\u201d she told him, but there was no bite in it. Her phone buzzed in her pocket\u2014a reminder to drink water, because she had to trick herself into kindness. She sipped his coffee instead, which was a mistake. \u201cGood grief, how do you drink this? It\u2019s like someone brewed a campfire.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s because the kettle is older than the school,\u201d Ms. Davis muttered.\n\nShe thought about it all day, moving around the edges of herself. It wasn\u2019t that she\u2019d never wanted something for herself. She had. She was just good at wanting quietly, in rooms where nobody else could get hurt. Once, years ago, she\u2019d saved up to go to London to see a show and then given the tickets away, because a parent called her the day before and said they couldn\u2019t afford to get their son to the college interview that might change everything, and it turned out the train ticket and her show tickets were close enough, and she\u2019d sat at home and eaten all the strawberries in one go and listened to the whole show on cast recording while she did laundry and told herself it was fine. It had been fine. But it had also not been fine. Both.\n\nAt the end of the day, she wrote \u201cHomework: Three paragraphs on ambition in Macbeth\u201d on the board, and put a smiley face with vampire teeth, for reasons known only to her marker. The class groaned like a choir performed by furniture. Out in the corridor, a boy\u2019s voice cracked like a plank splitting.\n\n\u201cWould you apply?\u201d Safia asked her, on her way out, one hand on the doorframe as if anchoring herself. \u201cFor that show?\u201d\n\n\u201cI might,\u201d Hannah said, as if answering about a dish she might cook, or a jumper she might try on. \u201cShould I?\u201d\n\nSafia nodded in a very adult way for fourteen. \u201cI think you should do stuff when it scares you. Unless it\u2019s like getting in a stranger\u2019s van. But the other stuff. The mind stuff.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks for that detailed moral framework,\u201d Hannah said, smiling. \u201cNo vans. Noted.\u201d\n\nWhen the last child had clattered away, she watered the plants, she fed the fish. Gal performed his small drama again, shimmying, flaring his little tail, lunging toward his own reflection in the glass, then at a bewildered danio who darted off, stripes flashing like a coded message.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll get yourself worked up,\u201d she told him. \u201cAnd then what? You\u2019ll jump out onto the carpet and blame me.\u201d\n\nShe stood a long moment, hands on the back of a chair, the muscles in her shoulders talking to her. It was as if someone else, years ago, had made a decision about her and she\u2019d been living it ever since; teaching had saved her in so many small ways she didn\u2019t know how to count them. But there was something else she had never admitted, not to her mother, not even to herself on bad days. She missed singing the way some people missed summer when it was winter\u2014an ache that made winter, paradoxically, sharper and more ferocious. Even singing in a corner of a pub with the smell of chips and the stick of beer on the floor had been a kind of sanctuary.\n\nWhen she got home, Tamsin\u2019s cat was on her doorstep again, a smooth black shape with a bell that never made a sound. Tamsin\u2019s cat did not know she wasn\u2019t Hannah\u2019s cat. She knew that a human lived here who would produce a saucer of milk or a piece of chicken at odd, inconvenient hours. Hannah stiffened herself. \u201cNo,\u201d she told the cat. \u201cWe have had the talk.\u201d\n\nThe cat looked wounded and sauntered off, tail like a question mark. The hall smelled faintly of paint because her neighbour upstairs was forever \u201cdoing up\u201d something. She had once knocked and asked what he was doing and he\u2019d told her it was \u201csoundproofing,\u201d which made her wonder what he had previously done that had made so much sound. She had received no further details and tried hard not to need any.\n\nHer mum phoned while she was cooking. She put her on speaker and stirred onions until they were transparent. June Flint had the voice of a woman who had been heard once and wanted to be heard again forever, but kindly, the way an old radio station\u2019s voice can be kind. June had worked in the library until it closed, then at the petrol station until they built a self-serve, and now she worked in a charity shop on the High Street two days a week, and knew most of the town\u2019s gossip without trying for it.\n\n\u201cYou at home?\u201d June said. \u201cOr are you out being a night hawk?\u201d\n\n\u201cI am cooking linguine,\u201d Hannah said. \u201cAnd if I call the dish that, it feels fancier than this thing with onions and a carrot and anxiety.\u201d\n\n\u201cLinguine is always linguistic,\u201d June said, happy. \u201cGuess who came into the shop today.\u201d\n\n\u201cMargaret who thinks the Council is a conspiracy?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, that\u2019s Wednesdays. Today, that man who runs the pier caf\u00e9. He said you made them all cry last Friday. And Janet brought a cake she\u2019d made from scratch, and he said they opened the back doors and let the sea join in. He said you made the room feel like it was a church.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat sounds like it violates several health codes,\u201d Hannah said, but she felt the words punch her, gently, in the sternum. \u201cYou were always good at getting people to exaggerate.\u201d\n\n\u201cI never exaggerate,\u201d June said, in the tone of someone who exaggerates for a living. \u201cYou were exceptional. I wish your father had\u2014well, never mind. I wish he had been the sort of man who liked to hear things that were beautiful.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s not,\u201d Hannah said, softly. She did not often say his name. It was like someone had folded it into a paper airplane and thrown it out to sea, and sometimes, on stormy days, felt like it might blow back in.\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d June said, pivoting. \u201cBut Hannah. Have you thought of applying? For that show. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s on the telly or on the computer these days. Britain\u2019s, you know, talent. You have talent.\u201d\n\nShe laughed, but quietly, like somebody told a joke at a funeral. \u201cEverybody in town has this conspiracy. I am being pushed. Is there a newsletter?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s called we want you to be happy,\u201d June said, and the way she said it made the room colder and warmer at once. Hannah turned the heat down under the saucepan, and rubbed her temple. The cat, which had circled back, screamed at her window as if in sympathy.\n\n\u201cStop it,\u201d she told the cat. \u201cI can\u2019t be bullied by mammals.\u201d\n\nAfter dinner, she sat on the floor with her laptop and watched videos. Endless, slick, ridiculous, gorgeous videos of people doing things that made the hair on her arms stand up: tap dancing, a violin that sounded like a person singing with their whole chest, a child standing there small as a biscuit and suddenly sounding like an avalanche. She watched the judges. The sighs. The stage lights that looked like the inside of an eyelid when you closed your eyes too quick. The big gold confetti moment, that blast of manufactured joy that nevertheless looked, at the end of it, oddly real. She watched and felt every hamstring in her body tighten. The very idea of stepping in front of all that and offering herself.\n\nShe registered on the site. There was a form. Of course there was a form. Name, age, occupation, location. A space to write about herself. She wrote: I teach English to the best and most terrifying people in Dover. I sing when they\u2019re not looking. She erased it. She wrote: I grew up on the cliff side of town. My mum sings in the kitchen and the gulls are drunk on the bins by the bus stop and none of it has ever stopped me wanting to make a noise that doesn\u2019t go away. She erased it.\n\nRubbish. All of it too earnest or too odd. She typed: Teacher. Dover. Hannah Flint. Off we go. And clicked save before she could decide it was wrong.\n\nIt wanted a video. Of course it did. She stood up, because sitting down, somehow, felt too serious. She set her phone up against a pile of books. The phone slid. She propped it with a mug. The mug held. She opened the window to let air in and Dover came in whole, car by car, shout by shout, the key noise of the town like someone rattling a tin of screws forever. She shut the window again. She took it seriously then: put the phone on airplane mode, ran her hands through her hair like that would fix hair. It didn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cHello,\u201d she told the camera. \u201cI\u2019m Hannah from Dover, I\u2019m an English teacher, and I would like to sing for you.\u201d It sounded ridiculous as soon as she said it, her own voice sliding away from her like a thing let go. She stopped the recording. She paced. She pressed record again and didn\u2019t say anything this time, just stood there, air-doing the piano introduction, then the song came as if she were hearing it through a wall. She sang it as if somebody needed it right now.\n\nWhat she had always loved were the songs that sounded like sea shanties even when they weren\u2019t; songs that had come, unhurried, through generations and wind and small kitchens with roller blinds, and only got more themselves as they went. She sang the one she\u2019d sung at the Mariner. She stood in the small light of her lamp and lifted the corners of the words and the room did what rooms do when they were given something to respond to\u2014it waited.\n\nHalfway through, the cat leapt into frame and landed with a disgraceful noise. Hannah soldiered on, because what else. When she finished, she had to laugh. The cat blinked as if having accomplished something important. \u201cA duet,\u201d Hannah whispered, breath streaked with relief. The phone stopped recording a second later. She watched herself back once, not because she liked it\u2014she always looked like she was trying not to look like she was looking at anything\u2014but because she needed to make sure the sound was bearable and that the cat had not knocked the phone flat.\n\nThere was a tremor in her jaw she hadn\u2019t known about. She hated that. She loved that. It meant she was paying attention. She uploaded.\n\nThe site bar crept along like a snail with a heavy backpack. She made tea and gave the fish a little midnight snack and wiped the kitchen counters like an apology for all the seconds that had passed without her noticing. When the bar turned green and the page declared, cheerily, Thank you! one of her hands was actually shaking, which was a clich\u00e9, which she hated, which she forgave.\n\nShe dreamed about it that night, in the ridiculous, television-sized way of it: confetti in her hair, her mother sitting in the front row and clapping with a nervousness that made the clapping look like a heartbeat. Mr. Barnes wearing a tie as if it were a flag. The judges vast and frightening like monuments, and the stage smelling of dust and hot electricity. She woke up and laughed in the dark. She went to the bathroom, drank water, stood at the window looking out at the part of Dover that always slept and the part that never did. The ferry horns gave off a mournful shape of sound that seemed to slow her breathing.\n\nThe email came three days later. It wasn\u2019t dramatic; there was no trumpet. It was subject-lined in the modern, airy fashion: Next steps: Your Britain\u2019s Got Talent application. It sat there in her inbox like something that might burst or be a dud, and for a long moment she didn\u2019t open it. She walked around her living room with her hands on her hips like somebody hunting for scissors. She sat. She stood. She opened it.\n\nWe loved your video, it said. Come to the audition in London. It gave a date. It gave a time. She made a noise that would have, had her door been open, sent cats from three streets over sprinting to her. She laughed to herself with her hand over her mouth, as if there was anyone to hear. She sat down very carefully. She texted one person, and that person was her mother.\n\nAudition, it read. London. It\u2019s happening.\n\nWithin seconds, June rang. \u201cI knew it,\u201d her mother said, triumphant and breathless. \u201cHannah. Oh my heart. Oh my girl. You\u2019ll wear that dress, won\u2019t you. The green one.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll wear whatever on the day is clean and doesn\u2019t make me look like a lampshade,\u201d Hannah said, crying and not minding that she was crying. She was quiet about it, so as not to frighten the joy away. \u201cI haven\u2019t told the school yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe school will throw a parade,\u201d June said. \u201cAnd I will wave at it from exactly this sofa and then attend with a banner. Do you want me to come to London with you?\u201d\n\nShe thought about her mother in that big, busy building with all the noise and waiting and vending machines and never enough seats, about the way June\u2019s knee had started to tell its own long weather. \u201cMaybe not,\u201d she said, love nudging at her throat. \u201cI think I\u2019ll go alone. That way if I fall over with nerves, there will be nobody there to see.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, you,\u201d June said softly. \u201cThere\u2019ll be thousands to see. And not one of them will mind, if they\u2019re your people. I\u2019m proud of you.\u201d\n\nThat day at school, news travelled through the teachers\u2019 wing like steam. She didn\u2019t say it loud; she told Mr. Barnes in his office and he came up out of his chair like a spring, then he told Mr. Shaw in the corridor and Mr. Shaw actually clapped like a seal and called out across the stairwell, and then Ms. Davis stormed into the shared planning space and demanded to know why she had to hear about these things third hand, and then at break there was a cake, because if there was one thing schools could do still, it was a cake, even if it was marked \u201cCongratulations Hannnah\u201d with an extra n that she immediately grew weirdly fond of.\n\nThe students smelled news within a lesson. Some of them had already found a clip of her online from the Mariner; one had set it to a filter that gave her rabbit ears. She pretended to be outraged. She wasn\u2019t outraged. She had never felt more seen by people she hadn\u2019t been trying to be seen by.\n\n\u201cMiss,\u201d Noah said, the second his bag touched his desk. \u201cMiss. Miss. If you win, are you going to leave us?\u201d\n\n\u201cAm I going to leave you if I win fame, fortune, and a probable hovercraft?\u201d she said, deadpan. \u201cHow dare you ask me such things in this house. We only talk about Macbeth in this house.\u201d\n\n\u201cSeriously,\u201d Safia said. \u201cAre you going to forget us when you\u2019re famous? Big Headline: Dover Teacher Abandons Children For Glitter.\u201d\n\n\u201cI could never abandon glitter,\u201d Hannah said. Then she softened. \u201cI\u2019m not going to forget anybody. I\u2019m going to go and sing and then I\u2019m going to come back and mark your homework and tell you to stop tapping your pens.\u201d\n\nThey both grinned at that. It anchored them all.\n\nTwo days before the audition, after school, she stood in the music room where Mr. Sands, who was a closed door pretending to be open, let her in to practice. It was odd being in there; she felt like she was wearing someone else\u2019s shirt, the collar too wide and the cuffs dipping over her hands. The room smelled of polish and old pianos and the particular tang of teenage nerves that had been left behind like a vapor. She warmed up, then sang the song twice through in a voice that felt both like her own and remote, like a letter she recognized but couldn\u2019t place.\n\nMr. Sands listened once through a split of his door like a butler. \u201cYou know,\u201d he said finally, \u201cyou have the timing of a person who knows how to be quiet, which is rarer than most think.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs that good?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is when you choose when to break it. Break it exactly then.\u201d He marked the bar in the air with a pencil, and she felt, for the first time, the proper shape of the song under her feet, the way some singers talk about it, not like stepping onto a stage, but like stepping onto a boat that had already decided where it would take you. She thanked him and he went, because he was good at going.\n\nOn the way home she bought a green dress in a shop none of the students went to, because it was where people their age went to die of boredom. The dress was not the green her mother meant; it was paler and softer, a green you might find buried in the color of a bottle left too long in the sea. She folded it into her bag as if it might speak too loud if she carried it openly.\n\nAt home, Gal was in a mood. She\u2019d come to recognize them. The other fish gave him room the way the rest of the world gives room to a small man with a loud voice on public transport\u2014not fear, just a gentle sliding away. He did his reflection routine three times, then broke off suddenly as if offended by how good he looked. She tap-tapped the glass once with her nail and he flared at her, offended.\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re all on our very best behavior, then. Good.\u201d\n\nShe barely slept the night before London. When she did, she dreamed she was in front of the judges and instead of singing she could only recite the Year 9 reading list, \u201cOf Mice and Men\u201d coming out in a high, trembling soprano, \u201cAn Inspector Calls\u201d in a weeping whisper, and the audience, bless them, smiled politely as if this were what they had paid for and weren\u2019t quite sure why.\n\nShe woke in the grey, the morning not yet committed to being what it was. She made toast and ate half of it and left the other half for the cat who did not belong to her, who appeared as if conjured, sniffed the toast as if insulted, and walked off with great energy. She put on the dress. She looked at herself in the mirror and saw someone who had forgotten how to comb properly and remembered, at the last second, how to stand. She rolled her shoulders. She picked up her bag.\n\nOn the train, she sat in one of those seats with a little table, and across from her a man hid inside a newspaper as if war might break out and he needed to be there first. Two teenage girls slid into the seats beside her, chewing something that smelled like watermelon and chemicals, talking at the same time as if their words would collide and that was fine. One of them glanced at Hannah\u2019s hair, at her dress, at the way she kept her hands on her knees like she needed to keep her knees from floating away, and said, kindly, \u201cAre you having a day?\u201d\n\n\u201cA small one,\u201d Hannah said.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got this,\u201d the girl said, as if seeing not a day but the whole of a life through the window. She went back to telling her friend about a cat in a video that had jumped onto a man\u2019s head, and the laughter of the two of them together felt like a protection spell. Hannah breathed. The train went into a tunnel and came out the other side, and the world had a different shade of green.\n\nLondon was so many people it felt like a mistake. She followed signs that did not seem to have anything to do with her, and then they did. She collected a badge. She was called a \u201ccontestant\u201d by someone with a clipboard, which made her want to flee into a hedge. She sat with other people who were good at other things: a group in matching tracksuits whose bodies looked as if they might be able to flip without warning, a woman with a dog that had an expression of profound philosophical interest, a man with a violin case that he touched with the care of a newborn\u2019s head.\n\nShe did not talk to anyone for a while. She held her cup of water and watched a television in the corner show people doing what they had come here to do. Her name was called. It wasn\u2019t her name at first. It was a number on a list, and then it was her name. Hannah Flint. She stood up and she walked along the corridor where the carpet changed from blue to black as if the building itself knew she was going through something. A woman with a headset smiled at her and performed the same smile she had performed for a hundred players today, and it didn\u2019t matter\u2014it worked on her anyway. The stage door was a mouth. The stage itself, when she was finally stood on it, was a town square. The lights were a weather all their own.\n\nShe saw the judges, their collective familiarity doing that trick where it felt as if you knew them, deeply, because you knew the shape of their eyebrows when they heard something they did not expect. She saw beyond them, the shadowed arms of the audience, the black glittering mass of it, the heartbeat of a thousand strangers. It could break you, she thought suddenly, and then: I am not asking it to.\n\nThey asked her questions. The usual. She answered the usual. Teacher, yes. Dover, yes. An English teacher. You teach Macbeth? A laugh broke out, one of the judges making a joke about a curse and she smiled in the right places. She held the microphone in both hands. She had practiced standing like a person who knew what to do with their arms. She did not yet know. That was okay, she told herself. That was okay.\n\n\u201cOff you go,\u201d one of them said kindly, as if letting her out into a garden.\n\nShe nodded once. She did not look back. Somewhere in the building, somebody dropped something heavy. The stage had its own gravity. She started the song.\n\nThat first line went up into the rafters and came back down and hit her in the chest. She nearly laughed at the oddness of it, how her own voice could feel like a boomerang. But then the second line found its feet. The third line knew exactly where to set its cup down. By the third verse, if you could call them verses, she had stopped seeing anything but what was just ahead of her\u2014the next word, and the word after, and the little lift into the vowel there that Mr. Sands had described with his pencil in the air. She did the thing he had told her: she broke the quiet exactly then and then found it again and people in the audience did that involuntary thing, the small sound that you can\u2019t repress when someone meets you where you live.\n\nWhen she finished, there was a pause that was either horror or grace. Then the room came back on, light and hot, in relief. She smiled because that\u2019s what you do when you can\u2019t think of whether to smile or cry. Someone stood up in the judges\u2019 row. Someone else put their hand over their mouth the way she had done in her living room. She heard someone on the edge of the stage say \u201cYes\u201d in a whisper, just to themselves. The applause came in waves, and the first wave carried her toward shore and the second wave dunked her and the third wave handed her back, laughing, to herself.\n\nThe judges spoke. They were kind. They were not all kind in the same way. One compared her voice to \u201ca thing that knows the difference between a funeral and a hurricane.\u201d Another said she\u2019d never heard a teacher like that before, which was a nice way of saying teachers were held in a particular box, and she had opened the lid. There was a joke about the fish when she mentioned the tank in her classroom. It turned into an odd, wide conversation about empathy and small ecosystems and children learning to be human. She forgot almost immediately exactly what she had said because her body was doing that thing bodies do when adrenaline is both a gift and a curse.\n\nThey gave her four yeses. It was the kind of sentence she had heard on television a hundred times and not felt, and now it pinned her to herself kindly. She felt very plainly that she would go back to Dover and teach again next week, and also that she had stepped into a place in her own voice that she could not step back out of.\n\nWhen she got back on the train, her phone filled with texts and messages and the quick bright burst of a new reality. She read some. She put the phone face-down when it was too much. Across from her, a boy played on his handheld console and made a face like thunder and his dad said gently, \u201cNo melting, mate,\u201d and the boy said, \u201cI\u2019m not melting,\u201d with pride, and did the small breathing trick his dad showed him. Hannah learned the trick simply by being there. She did it too, and smiled out the window at the grey coming on.\n\nIn the classroom the next day, the fish were fine. Gal, for once, seemed contrite. She fed them. The students filed in with the good gossip eyes, and she let them gossip for a bit because they were children and she had become a kind of news. Later they read a poem by Heaney about feeling the weight of what you are good at and also the weight of not doing it. They didn\u2019t relish Heaney like she did, but they saw a line that was theirs, and marked it.\n\nAt lunchtime, Mr. Barnes called a meeting in the hall and announced her audition success like the unveiling of a satellite. There were photos. She hated it; she loved it. On her way back to her room, she saw the science lab door ajar and Mr. Shaw hunched over a tank twice the size of hers. He was doing triage on a snail who had crawled upside down for too long and looked exhausted by it.\n\n\u201cThis is my life now,\u201d he said, without self-pity. \u201cGive me a day at sea and six non-moronic teenagers any time.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can offer you fifteen adolescents and a morally complex guppy,\u201d she said.\n\nHe looked up. \u201cHe does look\u2026 what\u2019s the word?\u201d\n\n\u201cPeeved.\u201d\n\n\u201cAggrieved.\u201d\n\n\u201cAngry,\u201d she said, and heard how it sounded in her own mouth: angry guppy. A stupid, comic phrase to say out loud in a day that felt like it deserved better. She laughed at herself for laughing. \u201cHe is, though. I swear he holds grudges.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey say fish forget in five seconds,\u201d Mr. Shaw said, then leaned down to whisper to the snail as if it could hear him and it mattered. \u201cI don\u2019t believe them.\u201d\n\nOn Friday she went back to the Mariner because she had promised herself she would not stop doing the small versions of the thing just because she had done a big version. The bar was warmer than London and smelled strongly of the potato in chips, and the room didn\u2019t care about judges or the right cut of a dress. Maggie, who ran the place, wiped her hands on a towel and hugged her long and hard. \u201cOnly rules still apply,\u201d she said, eyes shocking with brightness. \u201cNo singing \u2018Wonderwall\u2019. No singing, \u2018Hallelujah\u2019 unless you are Leonard Cohen brought back. One free drink if you mention Dover at least once.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll mention Dover three times like Beetlejuice,\u201d Hannah said, and Maggie nodded solemnly like that made mystical sense.\n\nThe first song went well, which is to say it felt like throwing a ball to a friend a small distance away on a day when your feet kept on solid earth. She didn\u2019t look at people\u2019s faces. She looked just above them, at the framed photo of the cliffs. The second song went better, like a ball that knew its own arc. In the gap between one and two she saw a man at the bar point at his phone and mouth to his mate, That\u2019s her, and then look at her like she might not be and then like she was real anyway.\n\nSomewhere near the top of the weekend, she got an email that said Please do not share any program details (it was all capitals and felt like being told to keep someone\u2019s eyes safe). She didn\u2019t, because even if she had been tempted, she had never been a person who could keep up with one secret and a life at the same time. Still, things moved under the surface. She got a call from a person with a voice like a very confident robot who said words like schedule, risk assessment, wardrobe. She learned she would come back soon, that there were further rounds, that maybe, if she didn\u2019t drop the ball and the ball didn\u2019t suddenly become, say, a cat, she could be on the telly proper.\n\nBetween hanging up and making another cup of tea, she felt that odd, split feeling people in old stories must have felt when a ship was due and you couldn\u2019t see it yet, just a darker line on the horizon.\n\nMonday came and went, and so did Tuesday, and the fish did small fish things that felt important to them, and the children did small human things that felt important to her, and late one afternoon, when the sun made a rectangle on her classrooms carpet like a stage she would never step on, because floors were floors and you could not be asked to be a bigger giant than you were, Safia stood by the fish with a frown.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s giving me drama,\u201d she said, meaning Gal, who had puffed himself up to twice his arrogance.\n\n\u201cHe gives everyone drama,\u201d Hannah said. \u201cHe\u2019s a fish with an ego. We forgive him the way we forgive each other.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf he nips my finger I\u2019m telling my mum,\u201d Safia said, delighted to have something silly to say in a week of serious things. She did not put a finger in the tank. Nobody did. The tank hummed its patient hum, the sort of noise that keeps you in this world when your mind tries to go somewhere else.\n\nHannah tidied, set the chairs on top of the desks to make the cleaners love her, and turned out the light. In the part-shadow, the fish glowed in their separate way. She stood a while longer, listening to what a room listened to after everyone had left it. Then she went home, walking the long way, past the place where the road gave way to the path to the cliff. The wind picked at her hair, and she let it.\n\nAt home, she opened the window. The cat arrived within minutes, not surprised to find herself welcome in a house whose owner kept saying no. She placed a saucer on the floor because habits are louder than rules. On the telly, people were also singing. It looked smaller when it wasn\u2019t your stage. It looked like something anyone could do, which was the program\u2019s great trick and also what made it tender.\n\nShe turned it off. She drank her tea. She smiled at the darkness gathering like it always had, no matter what theatrics any of them were doing at the other end of the line. She tucked herself into bed and, for once, fell like a dropped coin into sleep. Outside, the sea went on, not caring if she had said \u201cYes\u201d or if anyone had said it back. It kept on doing what it did. She took comfort in that.\n\nIn the morning, the first thing she did\u2014before even making tea\u2014was feed the fish. Gal came up as if ready to negotiate a treaty and then, last second, darted away from a mirrored ghost of himself. Even fish, she thought, had versions of themselves they were frightened of. She tapped the glass very gently, and it made a sound like a small bell. Gal came back, greedy, alive, certain as anything of his small kingdom.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t get ideas,\u201d she told him. \u201cYou and me both.\u201d She dropped a pinch of flake in and he snapped it like a secret. She laughed, at herself, at him, at the week, at the thing she had set in motion without knowing exactly where it would take her.\n\nThat afternoon, between helping a boy write a sentence with fewer commas and convincing a girl that the best way to show she was smart was not always to talk loudly, she got another email. Not hugs this time. Not London. Not schedules. Just a line that made her heart go sideways before it steadied. A change in the shape of what was next.\n\nWe\u2019re making some adjustments to the live shows, it said. Unlikely, but possible, that due to a situation beyond our control, you may be moved forward if a slot opens. We appreciate your flexibility.\n\nShe read it twice. She did not know exactly what it meant. She did know what it felt like, to be told that she might be shoved into a place she wasn\u2019t expecting to be yet. She stood in the doorway of her classroom and watched her students pack their bags and shout again and run for their buses, and thought: whatever happens, happens to the part of me that can breathe on a stage, not the part that knows what Noah needs when he\u2019s trying not to be seen.\n\nOn her way out, she said to Gal, \u201cBig changes,\u201d and he flared as if in agreement. She rolled her eyes at herself. She turned off the light, and the glow in the tank went from gold to black and back again as the small engine kept on. Filtering, cleansing, making a small world make sense. She left the room and shut the door on that private weather, holding the banister like a steadying hand as she went down into the evening that waited for her, down in the hall, beyond the door, into Dover, walking squarely into whatever wind there was.",

Outside, the seafront was still trying to decide whether to be blue or grey, and the gulls were in their morning parliament, grey-suited and outrageously confident. Hannah poured the water and watched tea happen the way weather happens\u2014quietly and then all at once. The email from the night before might as well have been taped to the inside of her skull. Adjustments. Slot opens. Flexibility appreciated. She\u2019d read it, rolled it around on her tongue as if it were a sweet with a bitter centre, and then she\u2019d slept anyway, because sleep was one of the few things she could still do without permission. Now the day stood there, new and ordinary, and she was supposed to be both.\n\nShe arrived early at school to mark three essays before anyone else put their noise in the corridor. In the tank, Gal was arranging the morning in the precise, imperfect way he preferred. He chased a tetra half-heartedly, then went to survey his own reflection and quivered in a way that would have been comic if it didn\u2019t look so much like an argument with the self. \u201cAll right,\u201d she told him, one hand on the glass, performing the ritual of greeting like it mattered. \u201cI understand. I\u2019m also frighteningly good-looking and that is my burden.\u201d He angled, flared, darted. When she sprinkled the flakes he shot up through them as if trying to catch weather.\n\nBy the second bell the corridor was tinny with laughter, and she was already braced for Noah to ask a question that sounded like a philosophy minor had got lost in an English classroom. He didn\u2019t disappoint. \u201cMiss,\u201d he appeared at her elbow, hair doing something architectural, a smear of something on his sleeve that better not be jam. \u201cIf ambition wrecks Macbeth, and if ambition also gets you a life, where\u2019s the line? Because you always tell us there\u2019s a line. That\u2019s like your whole thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy whole thing,\u201d she said, \u201cis \u2018use your commas sparingly\u2019 and \u2018wash your hands after the loo.\u2019 And then, maybe, then, ambition. The line is where it stops belonging to you and starts belonging to hurting other people.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not a line,\u201d he objected, but he smiled when he said it. He saw the fish the way he saw everything, in glances and leaps. \u201cGal looks a bit weird.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe looks like himself,\u201d she said. \u201cWhich is exhausting enough.\u201d\n\nMid-morning, the headteacher\u2019s voice rose over the staffroom like a trumpet done quietly. Mr. Barnes had a way of delivering news that made it feel like you were all in the same boat, even if the boat was sinking. \u201cHannah,\u201d he said when she stepped in, having been paged over the dodgy speaker system that cut out on the word \u201curgent\u201d and replaced it with a noise like a door being kicked. \u201cHow are your nerves?\u201d\n\n\u201cServiceable,\u201d she said. \u201cWe talking general or specific?\u201d\n\n\u201cSpecific. You\u2019ve had something from the programme?\u201d\n\nShe nodded, holding out her phone so he could see the email, because she had not yet learned how to pretend she did not want a witness to everything. Mr. Shaw leaned over Mr. Barnes\u2019 shoulder, porridge, incredibly, already redeemed into a fresh tie, like a man who believed in second breakfasts.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re asking if you can shift,\u201d Mr. Barnes said, reading. \u201cMove up if someone drops, so to speak. Could happen, might not happen. And if it happens, it sounds like very short notice, doesn\u2019t it. Of course it does.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat day is short notice in television?\u201d Mr. Shaw said, hauling a chair over to sit and fully commit to the conversation. \u201cThey could call you while you\u2019re on the loo and expect you to belt it out over the hand dryer.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hate this image,\u201d Ms. Davis said from the corner without looking up. \u201cAlso, I\u2019ve thought about it and we will have to organise cover. Look at this timetable.\u201d She slid Hannah\u2019s key lessons across the table like a deck of cards she could read. \u201cYear 11 mock feedback Friday. Parents\u2019 evening Thursday.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can move parents\u2019 evening,\u201d Mr. Barnes said, like a magician disappointed nobody appreciated the trick. \u201cI\u2019ll call it a climate event. We\u2019ll evacuate them into next week. It\u2019s fine.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt isn't,\u201d Hannah said, and heard the smallness in her own voice and immediately wanted to make it more generous. \u201cBut thank you. I\u2019m worried about leaving them mid-battle. Macbeth\u2019s in the witches.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll still be in the witches when you get back,\u201d Mr. Shaw said. \u201cThe witches are patient. You\u2019re allowed to go and do something that is for you. We will mind your children. We will not feed Gal. I cannot stress this enough.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou fed them once,\u201d she said. \u201cThey still talk about it.\u201d\n\nHe winced. \u201cI misread the tub. In my defence, the tub was very mislabeled.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot at all,\u201d Ms. Davis said, because she couldn\u2019t resist. \u201cIt said fish food.\u201d\n\nThey were ridiculous and they were a family of sorts. She felt the warm swill of being protected and wanted to resist it because protection sometimes came with obligations she couldn\u2019t pay back. Mr. Barnes landed the plane, as he did. \u201cIf they call,\u201d he said, \u201cwe\u2019ll arrange cover. You\u2019ll go. We\u2019ll be proud and grumble and send you texts. You will come back. I\u2019ve been here long enough to know how this works.\u201d\n\nShe kept her phone face down during Period 3 in case the call made her heart do something visible. Period 4 it vibrated anyway and she let the students get on with their writing while she stepped into the corridor and looked at the number as if she might be able to change it by will. Unknown. Of course. A woman with a pleasant, brisk voice introduced herself and told Hannah, delightfully, that everything was either fine or very much not fine.\n\n\u201cSo, we\u2019ve had a\u2026 situation,\u201d the woman said, with the bright glide of someone who wore a lanyard shaped like a shield. \u201cA group can\u2019t perform due to a travel issue. We are shuffling. There is a possibility\u2014and I stress possibility\u2014you might go in their place. It would be this Sunday. That gives you\u2026\u201d Hannah heard tapping and imagined a schedule falling down a set of stairs. \u201cIt gives you three days. We would want you Saturday for rehearsal.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 yes,\u201d Hannah said, and then because she had taught herself to be specific in a crisis, added, \u201cI am a teacher. I have parents\u2019 evening Thursday and mocks Friday. I can rehearse on Saturday. I can be in London Sunday. I will be underprepared Thursday and somehow more prepared Sunday.\u201d\n\n\u201cBrilliant,\u201d the woman said, genuinely sounding like it was. \u201cWe\u2019ll have our musical director call you to talk about arrangements. The folk piece you did\u2014we loved it, the EP loved it\u2014but the live show we might want to add texture. Something that grows. Strings, maybe a bodhr\u00e1n, something that is not dreadful. We don\u2019t do dreadful. I\u2019ll email. Oh, and media. We\u2019ll manage your press. Don\u2019t announce. Not yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot announcing is my strongest skill,\u201d Hannah said, then hung up and stood very still in the corridor and listened to the heavy breathing of the building\u2014the pipes, the ancient radiators, the stampede of Year 8s somewhere above. Her pulse felt like the sea at spring tide. She wanted to sit down but there was nowhere to sit that didn\u2019t look like a child had once cried there.\n\nIn her classroom, the students had performed a miracle. They had written quietly for two whole minutes while she was gone because she had asked them to. Safia looked up when she came in and tilted her head. \u201cYou okay, Miss?\u201d\n\n\u201cI am very okay,\u201d she said, and meant it and didn\u2019t. \u201cI am a person who will need to drink water and breathe, which are both free, and then I will be okay. Commas. Who needs me with commas?\u201d\n\nThat afternoon, while the others went to the car park to argue about whose mother was worse, she found Mr. Sands in the music room and told him what she could tell. He nodded like an old metronome. \u201cYou\u2019ll want to pick something you can lean on if the floor moves,\u201d he said. \u201cThe floor will move. It won\u2019t be the end of the world; it\u2019ll feel like it is. Whatever you pick, it should have a hinge. Somewhere you can rest a second inside it and then open it and go through.\u201d\n\nHe had a list. Of course he had a list. He was the kind of man who had a list on onion-skin paper. They tried two songs in the dim gold of the room, windows fogged with the ghosts of trumpet lessons. One was too cheerful; it tasted like seaside rock. The other had something in it like salt. She sang, then stopped, then sang again, and the second time, halfway through, there was that hinge he\u2019d promised. She stepped through it and found herself on the other side, in air clearer than she\u2019d had any right to expect. When she was done, he made a small noise like somebody had placed a chess piece exactly where it had always wanted to be. \u201cThat one,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can make the room do what you ask with that one.\u201d\n\nOn the way home she walked past the charity shop on the High Street and stared at the jumble in the window until her own reflection arranged itself into someone she recognised. A coat on a hanger looked like a person waiting to be picked up. June had scrawled on a bit of card for their book table: Two for one, unless I know you\u2019re rich. XXX June. The shop was not open, it was never open at the exact moment when you thought \u201cYes, now,\u201d but she liked the feeling of her mother\u2019s handwriting out there like a flag.\n\nAt home, the cat was a small, sleek alarm. It sat on the doorstep, refusing to move with such determination that the world bent around it. \u201cI will not be owned by this relationship,\u201d Hannah told it, and then let it in anyway because she was what she was. She pulled out her phone and called her mother and managed to say it without making it sound like a storm. June took it like any weather. \u201cRight,\u201d she said, \u201cso I\u2019ll set my telly to record and I\u2019ll put cakes in the freezer because you never know who\u2019ll show up, and I\u2019ll tell Margaret she\u2019s not to come to mine on Sunday to talk about the bins unless it\u2019s an emergency, and if it is an emergency she will bring the bins with her because I won\u2019t miss you.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to watch it live,\u201d Hannah said, trying to be kind and not sure if kindness looked like that. \u201cYou can watch in your own time.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would like to be with you in it while it\u2019s happening, thank you very much,\u201d June said, stout as a lighthouse. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be brave for me. Be brave for the girl who loved songs. I\u2019ll mop up after her if she cries.\u201d She said it like a pact. Then, because she was also the sort of mother who knew about knees and weather, she added, \u201cI went up the stairs at the shop today and my left knee told me the truth, which is that it is well past its best and would like to be replaced with something titanium and glamorous. I am telling you this to remind you that bodies are both miracles and liars. Eat a potato.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to London, not the trenches,\u201d Hannah said, but she found herself putting actual butter on a potato later and eating it like a person who believed in fuel.\n\nThursday she stood for three hours under strip lights while parents told her everything and nothing and she told them that their children were trying and brilliant and complicated and that she was very proud to be in their lives. She meant it down to the marrow. She meant it even about the ones who had made her want to throw a thesaurus out of a window. Noah\u2019s mother wore a coat that made her look like a saffron; she shook Hannah\u2019s hand hard enough to make the skin of her palm ache. \u201cHe says you\u2019re good,\u201d she said. \u201cHe says you see him. That\u2019ll do me.\u201d\n\nSafia\u2019s father did a strict nod like a folded piece of paper and said, \u201cPlease keep her busy. She talks less when she has to read.\u201d Safia rolled her eyes and looked away and then looked back and mouthed, \u201cThank you,\u201d like a tiny revolution.\n\nIt was after the last parent had gone and the custard creams had been beaten into dust that she went back to her classroom to turn off the lamp and found Gal not right. It took her a second. Fish were always doing something that looked like nothing and vice versa. He hovered in the corner like an idea that hadn\u2019t decided whether it would be good. When he flicked, the tails of his fins looked ragged, as if he\u2019d gone through a small, personal storm. The lamp made his colours too clear. She knelt, very gently the way people talk to babies and gods, and watched. He darted. He did not dart as he usually darted. He didn\u2019t posture at himself, which might have had you calling emergency services.\n\nShe found Mr. Shaw packing his bag with the look of a man who had not stopped moving since 1999. \u201cMy fish,\u201d she said, and he took one look at her and put the bag back down.\n\n\u201cDescribe your fish,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cRuffled,\u201d she said, aware it wasn\u2019t the science word. \u201cTired. Like me,\u201d she added, to forestall the joke.\n\n\u201cCould be fin rot,\u201d he said. \u201cOr stress. Or his own personality biting him, which can happen. I\u2019ll look.\u201d He bent to the tank and squinted like he was reading a poem written very small. \u201cHe\u2019s frayed. You need to keep the water extra clean. No overfeeding. Bit of aquarium salt if you\u2019ve got it, very small amount. Turn down the light. Pretend you are a spa, not a disco.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never been a disco,\u201d she said, solution and worry fighting like cats behind her ribs. \u201cWill he be okay?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a guppy,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re tougher than they look. But they\u2019re not immortal. None of us are. Which is annoying when you\u2019ve got a weekend like yours.\u201d He put a hand on her shoulder, which he did rarely enough that she felt it as a blessing. \u201cGo to London. I\u2019ll check on them Saturday. I promise not to feed them.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will positively not feed them,\u201d she said, because rituals mattered. \u201cAnd if he\u2019s gone when I come back, I will pretend to handle it and then cry in a cupboard.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can cry in my cupboard,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has a chair and a poster of Marie Curie.\u201d\n\nFriday was the kind of day schools specialise in. A fire alarm. A debate in the corridor about whether a bacon sandwich was morally wrong. A girl with a headache the size of France. Hannah stood in the middle of it with her hands open and let it happen and did what you do when you don\u2019t get to control anything: you controlled the controllables. She photocopied. She left a folder for her cover teacher labelled in a way that would make it impossible for anyone to say they didn\u2019t know what to do. She put sticky notes on the fish food. She wrote a silly, stern note and stuck it over the tank: I\u2019m watching you. Be civil. She resisted the urge to sign it \u201cLove, God.\u201d\n\nIn the afternoon she got fifteen minutes with Mr. Sands, a piano, and the song that had chosen her. They flipped it inside out. They took bars away and put them back. It felt like turning up the collar of a coat and finding someone else\u2019s name stitched in and deciding to leave it there. He made a face at the phrase they knew had to lift, and she lifted it until the ceiling noticed. When she finished, he didn\u2019t clap. He put his hand flat on the piano as if to steady it. \u201cDon\u2019t let them hurry you,\u201d he said, noting the places where the years had made him kind instead of brittle. \u201cYou go in with your own weather.\u201d\n\nSaturday early, she took the train to London with a bag that made her feel like she was moving cottages. She had never been to television rehearsals, but she had read a lot of books and seen enough behind-the-scenes content to walk in as if she could identify a gaffer in the wild. The building they used as a base looked like a very expensive car park. Inside, everything was polished and unfinished at once, wires like vines, walls that were both temporary and permanent, people with headsets moving in the purposeful way people moved when they had been told not to let things go wrong.\n\nThere was a room labeled Contestants which made her laugh because she kept forgetting she was one. Inside it, a group of boys were drumming on their thighs, a woman with hair like a bird of paradise was quietly humming scales, and a man with a face your grandparents would trust was oiling his violin bow the way some people pat a horse before they ride it. The dog was there, too, the philosophical one, gazing at a tin bowl as if it contained the secrets of the universe and perhaps it did.\n\nThey put her in front of a camera with a young man who asked questions in a voice like a smile. He asked why she taught. He asked why she sang. She answered the same answer two different ways because that\u2019s what the truth looks like when you turn it. The producer with the bright voice from the phone had a body to go with it and a clipboard you could probably have used as shelter in a storm. \u201cWe\u2019ll try strings,\u201d she said to Hannah, her pen clicking like a clock. \u201cWe have this arrangement we can build from. Our MD is a genius disguised as a person. Don\u2019t panic. If we panic you\u2019ll know because we all start walking faster and you will feel it like a tide.\u201d\n\nThey went through it with the band in a half-lit space that made everything feel like dressing up. The first run was too polite. The second found its bones. The third made the hair on her arms stand up like wheat. The MD, who had the face of someone who could hear sketches of Bach in a printer, tapped the stand and said, pleased, \u201cThere. Again from there.\u201d The strings lifted like a breath, a drum came in under them with the patience of someone walking alongside someone else who could not walk fast. She held the microphone in both hands because there was nowhere else to put the need, and sang, and for a second she saw Dover behind the blackness of the room. She saw the cliffs and the classroom and her mother\u2019s hands tapping the steering wheel in time when she drove her to primary school, one finger, then another, then the whole hand, with the radio or with the song in her head, whatever was playing that day.\n\nBetween the rehearsals, she sat with the drumming boys and talked about nothing that was actually nothing: chips, trainers, the way London air tasted like a coin. One of them said, \u201cYou don\u2019t seem scared,\u201d a statement rather than a question, and she laughed without laughing, which was a skill she\u2019d honed. \u201cI am very good at both being scared and holding tea without spilling,\u201d she said. He nodded as if this were an ancient art and was proud to know its name.\n\nThen, because all stories contain a piece you didn\u2019t ask for, her phone buzzed and it was the charity shop, or rather, Dorothy from the charity shop, who did not believe in preambles. \u201cYour mother\u2019s all right,\u201d Dorothy announced. \u201cBefore you get in a state. She slipped on a black plastic bag some idiot left on the floor. Sat down hard. I told her she\u2019d done it wrong if she meant to be graceful. Knee\u2019s protesting. We\u2019ve iced it. She will sit for two hours because I told her she would and because she cannot get up without me and that is how I like my friends, occasionally captive. She says not to ring. I am ringing because after two hours she will pretend nothing happened. Don\u2019t come. If you come, I\u2019ll hide you in the racks because Margaret will be here and she\u2019ll only try to adopt you.\u201d\n\nHannah leaned back against a wall that might have been a set and closed her eyes because sometimes that made the world tilt back into place. \u201cThank you,\u201d she said. \u201cTell her I love her, and I will come after, and I will bring something inappropriate from the supermarket and a determination to make her sit with her leg up.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll make sure she\u2019s clean for your visit,\u201d Dorothy said grandly, as if June were a spaniel that had rolled in something. \u201cGo and be marvellous. We will do the domestic follies. We are very experienced at it.\u201d She hung up without goodbye in the way of women who remembered when phone calls were expensive.\n\nHannah stood there another minute and let herself be someone\u2019s daughter very hard, then put the phone away and went back to rehearsal, because there are only so many choices. The stage manager took them through the walk, the stand, the look-left, the breathe. \u201cFind your mark,\u201d he said to each of them in turn, and there was something childlike and holy about it. Find your mark. As if you were always meant to end up exactly there.\n\nShe went back to Dover that evening because sleeping in a white hotel where the art was framed abstractly would have made her feel like a person in a brochure, and she needed to be a person in a bed with a cat that wasn\u2019t hers. The train had that end-of-day ache that rides home in other people\u2019s faces. A pair of lads argued about whether gravy on chips was universal truth or a personal failing. A woman in a fluorescent vest slept with her mouth open, shrugged into her nap like armour. The cat was waiting as if it had engineered the timetable. It showed her its entire contempt of the universe and then ate what she put down with the focus of a meditator. She texted Dorothy and received a photo of June with a bag of frozen peas on one knee and a grin that was all schoolgirl, and the caption, in Dorothy\u2019s scrawl: Will live. Very annoyed to be alive. Bring cake.\n\nOn Sunday the sea looked like somebody had sanded it. A thin rain had been thrown up and then forgotten. She put on the dress, the one that looked like glass that had learned to be kind. She looked at herself in the mirror and felt poised over the day like a bird over a wave deciding whether to dive. In the kitchen, she wrote a note nobody would see: Feed fish. Breathe. Okay. She left it on the table anyway, like a spell.\n\nThe staging area backstage had become a fairground of nerves. They had a run-sheet with everyone\u2019s name in neat columns and everything about it suggested certainty while everything about it was secretly made of decisions. Someone in a suit jogged past in trainers. A woman in a gold jumpsuit muttered about zips. The dog had a small moment with a polystyrene cup and was redirected kindly. When they miked her, the sound tech said, \u201cYou\u2019ve got a nice voice,\u201d in the flat tone of someone who meant it and had said it to people who didn\u2019t deserve it, which made it feel like a gift.\n\nThen the bit that wasn\u2019t supposed to happen happened, which is that the big voice came over from somewhere in the sky and said her name earlier than it should have. The act before had been cut short for something that sounded important up close and wouldn\u2019t matter at all tomorrow; the song before hers had been all fireworks and she had to walk out into whatever heat was left. The lighting guy, bless him, didn\u2019t meet her eye, because professionals know when looking at you might break you. The stage manager said calmly, \u201cWe\u2019re up,\u201d and touched her elbow exactly once and then let go.\n\nThe first line of the song had to be placed on a table without cracking. She thought of Mr. Sands and his hinge and of Gal with his ragged fin, holding himself slightly differently and still himself. She thought of Noah drawing his dragon in the corner of every page, the same dragon, the same corner, because staking a claim on a corner is sometimes all a growing person can do. She thought of her mother\u2019s knee and the way June would tell it off, bromide-filled peas sweating onto a tea towel, more annoyed than defeated. She thought of Dover cutting the sky cleanly, of the part of the sea that belonged to ferries and the part that belonged to quiet thoughts, and she set the first line down.\n\nWe could say that the rest took care of itself, but that would be letting the work pretend to be a miracle. She did the work. She lifted where she had to and rested where she could and looked at nobody and everybody. The strings held, and when she leaned they took her weight, and the drum beneath her was careful and then not careful, which was exactly what she needed from anyone right then. Something happened in the second verse that wasn\u2019t planned and didn\u2019t matter except that it mattered to her. She heard a sound from the audience that was too small to be clapping and too big to be a breath, a sound like someone finding their own heart in their pocket by accident, and she smiled without meaning to and a camera somewhere caught it. Later, June would text her that that bit made three separate people in the charity shop cry, and Dorothy would reply, only one of them because of haemorrhoids.\n\nAfter, you go and stand somewhere and get told that you did it, as if that sentence can hold anything. The judges said words again and some of them landed and some of them floated off with the confetti. She heard someone say \u201cauthentic,\u201d which is a dangerous word if you let other people own it. She thought: I am the only one who knows why this was real. She looked down and saw that she had been holding the microphone with both hands again and laughed at herself for not learning any faster. The lights warmed her skin and then stopped. She walked off. Someone hugged her. Someone else missed and hugged a piece of air. The gold on everything looked like the inside of a throat.\n\nThere was no confetti because it wasn\u2019t that sort of yes, not yet. There was a different kind of recognition which came from people who had backstage jobs and had seen too much and could tell when a thing had done what it meant to do. A woman with a headset pressed her hand once in a sandwich of hand-and-clipboard and said, \u201cThat\u2019s how we do it,\u201d in the way people say \u201cWe\u201d when they didn\u2019t lift a finger and also lifted lots of fingers. Hannah wanted to sit down on the floor and drink water forever. Instead she went to the place where the press was and said the three sentences she had learned to say\u2014Teacher. Dover. Love to my students\u2014and then she escaped with dignity that looked a lot like running.\n\nThe train back that night was full of people who thought they had seen something and weren\u2019t sure whether to admit it. A man across from her kept trying to catch her eye and then chickening out, which she understood on a spiritual level. Two girls took a selfie and then whispered so loud you could hear the whisper from three seats. She texted Mr. Barnes, Mr. Shaw, Ms. Davis, Mr. Sands. The group chat exploded into gifs that meant \u201cWe can\u2019t cope,\u201d and \u201cWe coped,\u201d and \u201cNow what.\u201d She texted June and Dorothy and received a photo of an empty plate and a caption: Cake has passed on. Went doing what it loved.\n\nOn Monday, the school moved as if nothing had happened and also as if everything had. The children were kind to her in the way children are kind when they decide an adult belongs, which means they mocked her gently and took the mick about her dress and staged a two-minute debate about whether she had eyebrows when they saw her on telly, because makeup. She laughed at them and made them read a sonnet and the world knit itself back together.\n\nAt break, she went to check on Gal. Mr. Shaw had left a note, capital letters, a drawing of a fish with a cape. He had done the salt in the right proportions, or close enough, and Gal was not cured but he was not worse. He swam with intent. His fins, still a little torn, moved like flags after a storm: battered but legible. Hannah put her hand to the glass and in some way that did not bear scientific scrutiny, he came to it. It felt like solidarity even if it was just habit. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to die of it,\u201d she told him. \u201cEither of us. Not this week.\u201d\n\nThat afternoon, as if the world were regularly scheduled and had no room for a subplot, Mr. Barnes rolled assembly in like a circus and made her stand there while the whole school cheered and then pretended not to have done it because public displays of anything are death if you\u2019re fourteen. She said something about trying and failing and trying anyway, and the microphone squealed and she winced and they laughed kindly at her pain. On the back row, Noah pretended to pretend he wasn\u2019t proud, which was a perfect circle of love drawn with a pen that was running out. Safia did a tiny clapping motion, hands just apart, like a bird.\n\nLate in the day, when the building had done its worst and was finally winding down like a radio station, the email came. It did not shout. It did not need to. It said: Next live round scheduled. It said: Rehearsal Thursday. It said: Publicity Tuesday. It said: Please keep all details confidential and be aware of press interest. It said: We were moved by the way you did the quiet. Our director would like you to consider a change to your second verse. It said: Call us.\n\nShe called, because you don\u2019t not call a person who holds a small part of your life between two fingers like that. The producer sounded as if she had been not sleeping for a hundred hours and also like she could run a small country on the side. \u201cWe want the story,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Dover of it, the teacher of it. We want the classroom in the song without it being literal. Think we can do that?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t do literal unless I\u2019m labelling fish food,\u201d Hannah said. She thought of Heaney. She thought of the boy on the train with the breathing trick. She thought of her mother\u2019s peas. \u201cWe can do that.\u201d\n\nWhen she left the building, it was already evening, and the light made a long strip on the floor of her room like a rug someone had rolled out toward a door she hadn\u2019t noticed. She put the chairs on the desks. She wiped the board clean of the day\u2019s vocabulary. She paused in the doorway longer than was normal, the way you do when you want someone to say \u201cDon\u2019t go,\u201d and there is nobody to say it because you have made your decisions and the room has its own life to get on with. In the tank, the small engine hummed. In the glass, she saw herself twice and the fish three times and the room infinite. She was a bit of everything: teacher and singer, daughter and person with a cat she wasn\u2019t allowed, woman who would get on a train and go to a place not built for her and stand there anyway.\n\nOutside, Dover lifted its chin to the night. The gulls were already asleep on whatever surfaces they had claimed, the buses were doing their last rounds like stubborn angels, and out past the harbour wall the sea rehearsed the same line it had always rehearsed, with conviction and without applause. She locked the door, took the banister in her hand as if it were a friend, and went down into the evening, the promise of new wind not frightening and not benign, but simply itself, and met it like you meet an old truth.",

                              "content": "The week opened itself like a map and immediately showed her the fold that always resisted lying flat. Tuesday was branded \u201cpublicity\u201d in the email that did not bother with punctuation beyond the bossy, and she had the small, ridiculous urge to iron her day the way you iron a shirt you want a stranger to approve of. Dover decided to behave like a town from a brochure, sky rinsed and gulls distant, as if someone had turned down their volume. The crew arrived in a white van that made the street look abruptly like a scene that had been ordered rather than lived, and Ms. Davis stood in the car park with her arms crossed and her mouth set in the way of a gate. They had permissions and badges and a man with a clipboard who said he loved schools, which Hannah tried not to interpret. They were careful and they were quick and they were wrapped in the smell of coffee and new batteries, and when they walked into 9C they took their hats off in the way that people still do, instinctive, as if classrooms were small churches with posters about safe sex.\n\nThey filmed the tank without the children in the room, because Mr. Barnes had said very clearly in a meeting that you do not let a camera see a child whose mother or father has not signed a piece of paper, and you do not even let a camera think about seeing a child, not without a piece of paper that could get God out of trouble. The cameraman\u2014a young woman with a nose ring and a serious, practical plait\u2014knelt like a supplicant and filmed Gal from his good side, which made Hannah laugh quietly because Gal would be unbearable if he knew he had one. He was still frayed but he would not be cowed; he surged toward the lens with the kind of swagger that, scaled up, would get you barred from pubs.\n\n\u201cHero fish,\u201d the sound man whispered, smiling like a conspirator as he held a fuzzy microphone that looked like a mammal you might whisper your sins into. \u201cWhat\u2019s his name?\u201d\n\n\u201cGal,\u201d she said, and when he looked blank she added, \u201cAfter a knight, but not the shiny one. The one who keeps making the wrong decision and then turns around and tries again.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood man,\u201d the sound man said to the fish, which felt perfectly natural in the context of a day that had agreed to be odd. They filmed her at the board and at the piano that lived in the corner and refused to stay in tune, not singing properly because they made it clear they didn\u2019t want her to empty the cupboard before the party. They filmed her hand underlining a sentence, and when they watched that back on a tiny screen it looked like something gentler than marking, like mending a seam.\n\nShe had laid out the exercise books with the appealing audacity of a person who believed that handwriting, properly done, could move mountains. Some of the children watched the incident through the door as they were allowed to pass in pairs on their way to Science, which Mr. Shaw had agreed to because he was in a reckless mood and had already terrorised his Year 10 with Bunsen burners before ten a.m. Safia stood with her head in the doorframe and her hair in a state of opinion, and when the camera turned toward the corridor like a sunflower she ducked in a way that would have shamed an acrobat. Later she reappeared with a great seriousness and said, \u201cMiss, if you are going to be on the telly again, can you make sure your eyebrows are even, because my mum said\u2014\u201d and then stopped, delighted with herself, because she knew very well she was pushing and guessing at the line, and took herself away before anyone else could.\n\nThe local paper, which employed a man who wore a tie out of respect for things and who collected the town\u2019s stories the way people used to collect bus tickets, asked for a photograph on the esplanade. Hannah put on a coat that made her look marginally more like a person in charge of her own life and stood by the railings while waves did what they had always done, which was make a nonsense of railings. The photographer kept saying things like \u201cchin down\u201d and \u201ceyes up\u201d and \u201cthink of a funny thought\u201d and she tried to oblige by thinking of Mr. Barnes bowing to the fish tank as if to a monarch. A gull swept in and took one look at the tableau and made a noise that could have been derision or blessing. The caption, the photographer promised, would be kind, because his mother liked her mother and this was how you did journalism in a town built like a family.\n\nOn the way back from that, she took the long route and stopped in at the charity shop with a paper bag she pretended was an impulse buy and was actually cake. June was sitting behind the till with a knee that was a small weather system, the bag of peas now a legend in a story that had already accrued five versions depending on who told it.\n\n\u201cI was twirling,\u201d June announced as if it would be unkind not to lead with the ridiculous. \u201cI was doing the tango with a bin liner. Dorothy said it was more like the foxtrot with a dishrag. The point is, only my pride bruised, and possibly the bit of me that said I was still seventeen. Give me a slice of whatever you\u2019ve got. I promise not to rate it and then I might rate it anyway.\u201d\n\nThey sat at the back on two chairs that had belonged to a church that had moved on and to a wedding that had ended happily if the scratched initials on the underside of the seats could be believed. They ate cake with a kind of full-bellied silence that only people who have known each other a long time can carry off. June watched Hannah with the way she watched her daughter, which was always several emotions at once. Pride came first. Then fear. Then joy. Then a fourth thing that was like the memory of a bridge they had crossed once in rain that had been both a nuisance and a blessing.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll look after yourself?\u201d June said, because mothers had to ask or else the sky would fold in. \u201cYou\u2019ll remember to eat and the bit in the song that feels like you\u2019ll fall off the edge isn\u2019t the edge at all, it\u2019s the bit right before you get the handrail? You\u2019ll remember your own handrail?\u201d\n\nHannah thought of the hinge, and of the breath she had found inside the song like a place to sit down in a field that had previously offered only standing. She thought of the banister and the way she gripped it every evening as if it were a person with a very steady personality. \u201cI\u2019ll remember,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd if I forget, I\u2019ve got professional reminders with clipboards who will hustle me back into remembering.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019d better,\u201d June sniffed, and then softened, because hardness did not suit her for long. \u201cWhen you were small you used to sing to your rubber duck and you\u2019d pretend it didn\u2019t float unless your song told it how. I need to tell you that the duck floats anyway. But it floats better when you do.\u201d\n\nThursday\u2019s rehearsal brought the part of the process that Hannah hadn\u2019t anticipated would undo her, which was the smallness of the kindness between strangers who were suddenly on the same team. The MD had arranged the invisible classroom into the song without a single literal bell. There was a rasp of bow against string that sounded like chalk finding the right angle. There was a high line that could have been a child deciding to speak. There was a drum so soft it could have been thumbs on a desktop. When she sang into that, the words found a way of carrying their own memory without dragging it around by the hair. She leaned into the hinge and it swung as if the song had been waiting years for somebody to open it.\n\nBetween run-throughs, she paced the corridor where other people\u2019s nerves had been left to cool, and she caught sight of herself in a panel of glass that had decided to act as a mirror just for this afternoon. She looked like someone who had told the truth by mistake and been applauded for it, which was the sort of luck you did not rely on. Her phone vibrated like a small creature with a warning, and she made the mistake of looking at it between doors, just long enough to see a message that began, Who does she think she is, and a profile picture of someone whose dog looked very happy. She slid the phone back into her bag with a level of care that did not match the threat and took a breath against the brick wall that smelled faintly of new paint and older anxiety. The MD opened the door a crack and saw it on her face, the thing of being very visible and also very attackable, and he did not say anything deep or supportive. He raised his eyebrows and said, \u201cOne more? From the place where it breaks?\u201d\n\nThey did it again, from the broken bit, which was how you learned not to fear it, and the breaking place became something else. It became the part of the song that knew her, and she knew it, and when you meet yourself like that on a stage, the part of the audience that has been waiting to meet themselves too will find you where you stand.\n\nFriday, a letter came from the Department of Education that looked official and turned out to be a round-robin about attendance figures and football boots, and a card came from a woman called Maureen with a pen that stuttered across the paper where it hit the raised bit where \u201cWith Sympathy\u201d would have been on cards for other occasions. \u201cWe watched you,\u201d it said, with a sea of exclamation marks that wanted very much to be polite. \u201cMy husband said you had the lungs of an old mining choir. I told him not to be rude and then he cried. We are not from Dover but we came there once on a bus trip in 1997 and had a very bad sandwich which I am obviously not blaming you for. I hope you don\u2019t stop.\u201d She pinned it to the noticeboard with the yoga flyer and the CPR moustache and the map for the fire exits, because in a school, all human events end up in one messy constellation anyway.\n\nShe had briefly believed that she could keep the piece of herself that liked to be alone with her singing only slightly less alone, that she could learn to stand on the bigger square of light without also being invited to be a person for other people to have opinions about in their kitchens. The online thing pushed back against that quiet fantasy with the inexorable pressure of a tide you hadn\u2019t read on the chart. She did what she always did when she didn\u2019t trust the weather; she sought out sensible people who had never once pulled her into a storm, and she brought them biscuits so they\u2019d be happy telling her the truth.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll need to not read the comments,\u201d Ms. Davis said, eating a custard cream with the methodical efficiency of somebody reading through the answer booklet and circling B\u2019s. \u201cAnd you\u2019ll need to fail at not reading them and then not write back to them, which will be a new muscle. If someone rings the school because they are cross that you have a job and also a dream, tell them to ring me. I like the cross. They\u2019re my people. I drain them of their cross and send them into the afternoon with a reminder to do their spellings.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome of them are kind,\u201d Hannah said, because she wanted to admit all the weather when she talked to Davis or else she would be corrected. \u201cSometimes they say a thing that looks like it could go in a pocket for later. I don\u2019t like to pretend there isn\u2019t good in it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can carry the good in one pocket,\u201d Ms. Davis allowed. \u201cThe other pocket you fill with pebbles, for throwing at the gulls. I\u2019m joking. Don\u2019t throw at the gulls. They know people who will throw back.\u201d\n\nMr. Barnes came and stood at the doorway with the small pose he did when he wanted a moment without it feeling like a moment. He had a letter in his hand and a glint that could end a war. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a complaint,\u201d he began in a tone that said the complaint could go into the bin as politely as into the fire. \u201cSomeone\u2019s very concerned that your sudden celebrity might destabilise the already precarious boat of Year 9\u2019s attention spans.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoes the someone have a name?\u201d Hannah asked, and when he told her, she nodded, because the name belonged to a person who had reasons, who had lived in a small town for a long time and believed in keeping everyone at the correct altitude. \u201cI\u2019ll speak to her,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll tell her that all my teaching is still done with chalk on the same boards, and that fame is a word that belongs to other people and not to me. I\u2019ll tell her that no matter what town my face appears in, this is the only room I care to own.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll tell her,\u201d he agreed, and folded the letter into a small square that ended up in his pocket as if that were the natural end of all official documents. \u201cAnd I will tell her that if we don\u2019t allow our own to go and be seen, then we only ever see strangers, and what good is that.\u201d\n\nIn the midst of all that, small life kept insisting on being cared for. Noah forgot his homework and turned up with a poem folded into a plane instead, which he launched too soon and then went to fetch as if participation had always been his plan. Safia said \u201cblood will have blood\u201d in a rebuttal about Macbeth with a crispness that could have cut carpet, and then softened and said, \u201cbut also sometimes blood will have a nap,\u201d which made the room laugh and then think and then write something better than they would have written without humour. A boy who had practised sullen to the point where it had become an art form asked quietly if he could read his work out, and when he did, his voice wobbled in a way that made another boy who \u201cdidn\u2019t do feelings\u201d go still for a full five seconds. Hannah watched the five seconds and then watched them break into adolescence again like a shoal breaking for the light, and she put it in her other pocket, the one she kept for what mattered.\n\nSaturday came round again because days insist on sequence no matter how dramatic you want them to be. She walked to her mother\u2019s with a bag of shopping and half the town stopping her to tell her the details of their viewing habits. She adored and tolerated it with the same reserves. June had her leg up and a book under the cushion and no intention of making this about pain when there was cake to discuss, and by the time Hannah left, Dorothy had turned up with a jar of pickled onions insisting they cured disappointment, which made no sense and also some sense. On the way home, the mariner\u2019s wind caught her and put colour into her face that no makeup on any programme could have faked.\n\nThat night the cat was waiting on the windowsill again, bell silent, whiskers organised. Hannah opened the window and let it in and said nothing about boundaries because boundaries were for daylight. The cat did a full perimeter and then settled with the insulted sigh of a creature who had once been worshipped and found the present day wanting. She sat on the floor with her back against the cupboard and her legs out in front of her and let the room feel itself around her. When she sang softly into the quiet\u2014half a verse, a line for luck\u2014it wasn\u2019t for rehearsal or for a camera but to remind her body that it could make a sound and trust it to leave and not be lost.\n\nSunday felt less like a mountain to climb and more like a hill she already knew, because she had learned the shape of the day now, where the stairs were and where the carpet changed its mind. The backstage smelled of hairspray and the inside of a black coat, and the people with headsets nodded at her in the way you nod at someone in church when you\u2019re not supposed to be greeting but it would be rude not to. She played a game with herself to settle her heart to a manageable architectural tremor; she thought of all the banisters she had put her hands on and thanked each one in turn, the school, the charity shop, the stairs at the Mariner with their carvings, the unforgiving rails at the pier. She thought of the tank and the way the engine hummed like a small, determined animal. She thought of Gal, already perhaps re-growing a whisper of fin, and it steadied her more than it had any right to. It was absurd to be steadied by a fish and it was also exactly right.\n\nThe producer caught her by the elbow as she set her foot on the stairs to the stage, and she braced without knowing whether it would be a change or a blessing. \u201cIt\u2019s yours,\u201d the woman said, and she said it with the quiet that powerful people put on when they have decided to be careful with you. \u201cIf the audience get excited early, don\u2019t let them rush you. If they cough, don\u2019t panic. If the lights feel warmer than last time, it\u2019s because they are. They have moods. We all do. Yours is the weather tonight.\u201d\n\nIn London, time behaved like a rubber band, generous and cruel. The first note hung longer than it should have and then fell like a fruit that had deserved to be eaten. The second verse was the place they had reworked to make room for the life she could not bring to the stage literally; she placed the silence where the classroom lived and let the strings catch it as if it were a bird that had flown in accidentally and would not be manhandled. Halfway along it, someone shouted something inarticulate, the kind of shout that could unnerve you if you believed it had anything to do with you. She set her foot on the hinge and it held and nothing fell apart. The finish was less of a finish and more of a setting down, and the relief in the room felt like the sense of an old joke finally being shared with the right person.\n\nThe aftermath was the same and entirely different, because that is how repetition does its clever work. The panel said a thing they had meant or not meant and it mattered and it didn\u2019t. The audience stood up or didn\u2019t stand up as instructed by their own hearts or by the person at the end of the row with stronger feelings than sense. She came off and was grabbed for press and did not remember the words she said until someone sent them to her later with commentary. A woman she did not know held her by the shoulders and said \u201cThat was an answer to a question I hadn\u2019t asked yet,\u201d and then looked embarrassed and went away quickly before the moment could curdle. It was all human and ridiculous and beautiful and exhausting, and when the door to the corridor shut behind her she leaned on it and wanted very much to go to a place where the floor did not have tape on it telling her who to be.\n\nShe got that place on the train again, the ugly blessed carriage that took people back to kitchens they understood. The phone had messages in it like a river has fish, some you wanted to catch and some you hoped would find their own estuary. She scrolled and stopped and put it down and picked it up, because the muscle was new and twitchy. She saw one from a student who had left two years ago and was now, apparently, in the army, who wrote, \u201cI thought it was daft when you made us write the letters to ourselves but I found mine in my drawer and it told me to keep going. Seeing you on the telly made me think I can do both the stupid job and the singing I do in my cupboard. Thank you. Don\u2019t tell anyone I said thank you,\u201d and she hid her face in her scarf for a second because it was her new favourite thing that she would tell no one about.\n\nWhen the train tipped them into Dover, the air was colder in the useful way, as if the night had been saving a clean breath for her. She went home the long way again, because she was not ready for rooms. The harbour lights had their own idea of celebration, steady pulses instead of glitter. She could see, out beyond, the smudge of a ferry turning, its own small world of microwaves and children and truck drivers and a woman somewhere with a notebook making a list. The cat was there when she reached her street, of course it was, and this time it allowed itself to be picked up with the grace of a creature who understands PR.\n\nMonday morning didn\u2019t care how your Sunday had gone. School rolled over her like itself, and she was grateful. The fish were still alive; Gal made a small ceremony of being fed as if he intended to sign something official. Mr. Shaw had left another note, this time with detailed measurements and an apology to Marie Curie for earlier flippancy. The door banged and Year 9 arrived and they did their ritual of pretending they had nothing to say and then saying everything at once. Safia reported with authority that her uncle had cried \u201cfor no reason, which is to say a lot of reasons.\u201d Noah said, very sternly, that he had noticed a comma missed in one of the captions and it had ruined the whole experience, and then he grinned in a way that said he had been proud enough to make himself dizzy.\n\nAt lunch, Mr. Barnes asked her to the hall and she went with obedient suspicion. The entire staff had organised an impromptu rehearsal of the wave generation, and somebody\u2014of course Ms. Davis\u2014had made a banner out of sugar paper and too much hope that read KEEP YOUR WEATHER, MISS FLINT, and she pretended not to cry and failed in a manageable way. In the afternoon, Mr. Sands brought her a photocopy of a song he had taken from some anthology three headteachers ago, and said without preamble, \u201cIf you go further, this might be for when you cannot imagine how to do it again. It doesn\u2019t sound like you now. But it could.\u201d He was a closed door that occasionally opened and put a cake on the mat.\n\nThere was, because the world requires balance, another message from the programme that had a perfunctory cheerfulness she had learned meant someone with a higher salary had had an idea. They wanted her to come to London Tuesday evening, not for singing but for sitting on a sofa and being gently interrogated by a presenter whose job it was to presume intimacy. \u201cWe think people want to learn more about you,\u201d the producer said, steady and kind, and Hannah\u2019s stomach did a thing she had not had time to schedule. She had the reflex to say no because of her children and her privacy and the fact that you cannot live on a sofa, but she also had a different reflex now that had been born the moment her song found its hinge on a stage with hot air and more opinions than lungs. She said yes and she wrote another set of cover notes and she was both glad and appalled that she had a system now for disappearing without cutting a child in half.\n\nOn the sofa, she found that the presenter was a person and not a machine and had a laugh that meandered on the way to its point, and that somebody had told him not to ask about her father, which meant something had been heard at some level. He did ask about the fish, and she told a national audience that her guppy had been poorly and that guppies could, in their way, be valiant, and the show cut to b-roll of a tank that was definitely not hers because her classroom did not have lighting like a spaceship. They gauzed Dover with a tenderness that made her forgive them, and when she spoke about teaching, they did not make that look like a fallback. If anybody read her words as a plea for sainthood, they did so without her permission.\n\nDays spun. The second live show came nearer as if running downhill. She found that she had a new skill, which was recognising the exact moment when Ms. Davis had had too much of other people\u2019s nonsense and diverting a child just before impact. She found that she could add salt to a tank without feeling like she was hexing the water. She found that she could ask for what she needed from the MD without fear that he would decide she was a diva and show her out. The song changed one more time in a way so small only they would notice, an extra breath at the front, and it made everything after it clearer. She thought of that change as an apology to the part of herself that had been told to be quiet for too long; she had given it a seat at the table first.\n\nThe morning of the second live, the sea went blue without being asked. She took her tea to the window and stood looking at the bit of town that had not moved since her childhood except where people had insisted on putting up new shades of paint and hope. The email pinged and she let it sit because she had learned that emails could wait for a second if you asked them to, and when she opened it, it was from a person who had nothing to do with television and everything to do with the other half of her life. It was from a woman who ran a little choir in a church hall that smelled of dust and biscuits; she wrote, \u201cIf you need a room to sing into with nobody in it and a piano that only sometimes pretends to be one, the key is still under the mat. I put new tea towels in. Your mum says she\u2019ll tell you not to get ideas, by which she means please get ideas and then come home with them.\u201d\n\nIn the corridor outside her classroom, a notice that hadn\u2019t been there yesterday had been pinned up, and she paused. It was Ms. Davis\u2019s handwriting again, tart and loopy. It said: \u201cResilience clinic. Free. Room 12. Bring your fear and a pencil.\u201d Underneath someone had replied in a different hand: \u201cDo you have pens.\u201d Under that: \u201cNo.\u201d Under that in another, smaller hand: \u201cCan I bring a different fear than everyone else.\u201d Someone had drawn a fish with a cape. Someone had underlined \u201cfree\u201d twice as if to make the point. She stood there a second, the late morning sun finding a way down the rumpus of brick and glass, and let herself believe in the ordinary heroism of the people she worked with.\n\nWhen she finally turned on the lamp of the tank and sprinkled the flakes, Gal came up from the plant like someone returning to work after having discovered they were not immortal. He took the food and didn\u2019t posture, which in guppy terms was a mantra. He swam without drama. He left the mirror alone for a full two minutes. She watched him and the quiet he made felt like a promise you could write on your palm and not have it sweat off. She put her hand to the glass and he touched where she touched, drawn by whatever fish are drawn by, hunger or habit or heat.\n\n\u201cYou and me,\u201d she told him, because she had a ridiculous heart and it demanded ridiculous rituals. \u201cWe do it again. We make a small world make sense, and then we go out into the larger one and try not to let it unmake us.\u201d He flared once, a tiny, dignified flare, as if to say he accepted the terms, and she laughed and turned to face a day that would require her to mark the difference between an adverb and an adjective in one hour and to stand between two forms of air in another. It would be, she thought, a day like any other, and it would be the day she had wanted since the silver thread had tugged her up in the dawn on Monday that felt like a decade ago. The kettle would shout. The gulls would hold their parliament. London would begin to warm its lights. She would take her banister in her hand when it was time to leave, and meet the stairs like a truth she could not unknow.",

                              "content": "Wednesday afternoon folded around her the way school days do when they know they are going to have to let you go early and are sulking about it. She spent the last lesson on grammar because grammar was ballast. They diagrammed sentences with the patience of archaeologists, and when Noah protested that nobody in the modern world needed to know what a subordinating conjunction was, she told him that knowing how things held together was never wasted, and he wrote a sentence that used three and then crossed two out because restraint is a muscle too. Safia read hers aloud like a person expecting the room to argue, and when it didn\u2019t, she took the quiet as if it were a compliment. At the bell Hannah held them just long enough to say, \u201cBe kind to each other while I\u2019m gone. Don\u2019t let anybody eat your lunch or your thunder. Do the homework. It will not kill you. If it does kill you, it will make an excellent piece of gothic writing.\u201d They laughed and went, and she stood in their weather as it thinned.\n\nIn the corridor, a man with a camera who had absolutely been told he wasn\u2019t to be here and had come anyway pretended to find the noticeboard fascinating. Mr. Barnes materialised like a moral and put his hand out for the man\u2019s lanyard. \u201cNo children,\u201d he said, not unkindly and not soft. \u201cNot my walls. You want shots of inspirational footsteps, you film the staircase. You want inspirational people, you write to me and I tell you \u2018no\u2019 politely.\u201d The man attempted charm and got back the expression that had retired three Ofsted inspectors in a row. He left, waving apologetically at the CPR dummy on the poster which, even moustached, looked unimpressed.\n\nHannah turned on the lamp in the tank for a last look and Gal obliged her by being ordinary. He lapped the filter, discovered it was the same filter as yesterday, and didn\u2019t take offence. His tail was tattered still but less; like paper dried on a line after rain, it had remembered its own shape. She was surprised at how much energy it gave her, this small confirmation that mending could be noticed if you were patient enough to let your eyes settle. She spoke low to him because it helped her. \u201cSpa, not disco,\u201d she said. \u201cEat politely. Don\u2019t make Mrs. Partridge from cleaning speak sharply to you because it will ruin your whole evening.\u201d\n\nShe left cover work that even a stranger with a cold could deliver, labelled it like a military operation, and locked her cupboard against the part of herself that would, at nine p.m., mourn three red pens she hadn\u2019t rescued. She went via the office to thank the receptionist for being the sort of person who kept the whole enterprise polite, and via the hall where Ms. Davis had written on the whiteboard for the resilience clinic a new line: You may bring biscuits. It will help nobody and change everything. Someone had drawn a lightning bolt that looked suspiciously like Mr. Shaw\u2019s project from Year 8 electric circuits. She pictured him leaning on a desk with his porridge tie already on its second life of the day and felt the school in her bones as if it were weightlifting and she was unexpectedly good at it.\n\nOn the stairs, she did what she had promised herself she would always do if this kept happening. She paused with her hand around the banister and said out loud, because privacy is a relative concept in a building that contains a thousand hearts, \u201cThank you.\u201d It was not to anything in particular and also to everything. She was a woman who had spent her twenties convinced gratitude was a posture and now had to be honest about the fact that it was a practice and better warmed you than not. Then she went; the day let her go; the wind outside had been saving up.\n\nLondon received her with the air of a city that had already seen it all and might see it again if it felt like it. The building took her and the building took everyone, dog and drum boys and a man with a harmonica who had the ancient face of road and sleep. The runner with the clipboard who had adopted her as a project pointed her to a corner that would be hers for ten minutes and told her how we were running, and Hannah loved her in the way you love people who do not lie to you about time. The MD walked her through the small amendments they had set like stones, the breath before the first phrase, the decision not to let the strings show off, the agreement that silence would be part of the arrangement because you can arrange quiet if you\u2019re brave enough. In the dressing room, the makeup woman had a steady hand and the professional malice for the cheap highlighter that had clearly broken three teenagers\u2019 hearts this week; she swapped in a better kind with a calm \u201cNo sparkle at your age unless you\u2019re a Christmas ornament,\u201d and brushed Hannah\u2019s eyebrows into submission, which made Safia\u2019s voice run in her head, a warning and a grace.\n\nWhen the stage manager came to collect the next set of trembling people, he looked at Hannah the way people do when they have decided they will behave like the inverse of a hurricane and the metaphor will hold if both of you hold it. \u201cSame marks,\u201d he said. \u201cDifferent day. Don\u2019t let the room tell you who you are. We can dim light; we cannot dim you. You do that or you don\u2019t.\u201d He was the priest of tape and doorways. She nodded and carried herself to the wings.\n\nOut there, the room was full of air and noise and bright rules. The audience glittered like a night sea. She could not see faces and was grateful for it. The judges arranged themselves like small countries behind a border and she barely looked at them because her business was with the next breath and the next. The little red light came on in a place it had not been yesterday and it would have undone her once, the thought of so many eyes in so many rooms, but she had already spent a decade with thirty pairs of eyes on her every morning first thing, and those eyes were the unkindest and the kindest both, so she knew a thing about looking and stillness. The presenter said her name the way announcers say names when they don\u2019t want to put their own weather in it, and she stepped forward and put her weather down like a rug.\n\nThe opening was clean because she asked it to be. The note sat where it had been told to sit, but like a living thing, not like a soldier. The strings found her without stepping on her heels. She looked nowhere and everywhere; she allowed herself, once, to look at a point where a person might be and was repaid by the oddest sense of being recognised by a stranger, which made your heart confused and your back straighten. Halfway through the second verse\u2014the verse they\u2019d carved to carry the classroom\u2014someone in the balcony began to clap on a feeling, and others read the weather wrong and joined in because kindness is sometimes clumsy. She felt the rush of it come up toward her like a wind that hadn\u2019t read the sign. She lifted her hand an inch and opened her fingers and did not look stern\u2014she couldn\u2019t; she could only look like a teacher asking for quiet with a smile\u2014and the applause died as if she had put a coat over a parrot. She did not hurry to reward them for obeying. She put down the silence instead, and you could feel it, the room deciding to be held.\n\nIt trembled once; she held; the hinge held. She thought of the children when they breathed together and a noise that wanted to be mischief turned into listening because someone had made them want to be proud of themselves. She got to the place where the word ran up the hill and over, and she let it climb and did not overfeed it. The drum found her feet. At the end she did not put a flourish where none belonged. She let the music sit down and then she sat down with it, inside it, so that when the applause finally came, it came into a room that had not been startled but welcomed.\n\nThe panel said things. One of them said, \u201cThat\u2019s control,\u201d and meant it as a compliment and also like a warning, because people are suspicious of women who handle rooms. One of them made a joke about detentions for clapping and the camera found her laughing at herself, because self-ridicule is an easier public act than self-belief. One of them said something about a grandmother that the nation would relate to, and it washed over her harmlessly because she was busy feeling her pulse slow to a human animal\u2019s. Above all, what she heard was the sound\u2014a relief, a release, a decision\u2014that comes from a crowd who have been given back to themselves. She took it in because it belonged to them and she was lucky enough to be present at the time of its happening.\n\nBackstage, where light behaves differently, the MD shrugged one shoulder as if to say that was the tune, and the runner with the clipboard took a victory sip of water for her because she had been holding two clipboards and a radio and the fate of six latecomers. The dog did an interview and barked at the appropriate syllable. A man cried for fifteen seconds and then remembered that he did not do crying and instead absolutely had something in his eye. She went where she was told, said the things you say when someone with a bright microphone leans into your day and asks what it was like to be alive for two minutes; she did not know how to answer that without sounding facetious or enormous, and so she told a small truth that she knew would feed no wolves. She said, \u201cThey listened,\u201d and the presenter said \u201cWe did,\u201d and for once it felt true.\n\nOn the train back she had her face in a scarf again\u2014not to hide, exactly, but to keep heat in\u2014and the carriage did that thing of becoming briefly a village. Two older women watched her with proprietary fondness and showed each other photos of dogs not present. A boy moved seats because he had misjudged the smell of his crisps, and apologised, which looked a lot like grace. Across from her a teenager put a hand on his friend\u2019s shoulder and said, in exactly the rhythm of the man she had seen days ago, \u201cNo melting,\u201d and Hannah had to bite inside her cheek to keep from laughing and crying at the same time at the way even the tricks of breathing travel. Her phone was a beehive. She answered what she had the strength for, left the rest like nectar for later, and sent June a photo of the backstage curtain because it felt like the only true portrait of the night.\n\nDover made its case at midnight with a damp wind and an unambiguous horizon. She went the long way again because her nerves needed unpeopled distances and the comforting light of kebab shops. At the corner by the salon that turned hair into architecture, a car idled with music turned to thin. A seagull upended a bin with an air of civic purpose. The cat appeared at the bottom of her steps as if it had been contracted by a very quiet agency to greet and appraise. It suffered a kiss on the top of its head in order to collect rent. Inside, she laid the green dress over a chair like laundry because she refused to make a shrine of it. She took her makeup off with the dutifulness of someone taught by a mother who believed in clean faces and moisturiser as creed. In bed she fell asleep the way you fall into a swimming pool when you know it\u2019s going to be cold and know you\u2019ll be fine and do it anyway.\n\nMorning made a liar of glamour. There was toothpaste to buy and register to cover and a note from the premises manager about the boiler that had tried to die again. The fish glowed in their own reasonable way and ate without theatre. Gal, now moving with a more modest flourish, acknowledged her with ignorance and need, which was always the agreement between them. In her inbox a message had arrived while she'd been in a green room, and for a second it looked like the sort of subject line you delete because you are not made of time. It said simply: Your father. She didn\u2019t open it until break, when she had a biscuit in a napkin and the staffroom was in the quiet between two laughs.\n\nThe email was from Dorothy, of course. Dorothy did not write long and she did not write late unless it was worth it. Hannah read, felt the floor, kept reading. He had been in the shop, Dorothy wrote, because he had not been able to not, and June had been out back arranging old board games into piles by missing pieces and Dorothy had seen him first and made him tea without asking what he took because it was not that kind of day. He had said he had seen Hannah on the television and he had called her Hannah as if the word were unfamiliar and wanting to be practiced and Dorothy had said, After all this time, imagine, and he had winced as if hit and she had not apologised for the blow. He had left a card. He had said he would come back only if asked. Dorothy had suggested to him, in the tone she reserved for men and moths, that if he was waiting for women to ask, he would keep waiting for the rest of any decent life. He had not argued. The card was attached below, a scan that made his writing newly wretched, clumsy, older.\n\nShe stared at the looping letters like they were in code. He had not said much. He had said he was in Folkestone, which explained nothing. He had said he was glad to see she had used her lungs the way her mother had always wanted, which was an odd sentence to give a stranger to carry. He had said he was sorry without adjectives. He had written a number. He had not asked forgiveness as if he were entitled to it and he had not begged as if he were a child. He had done a very British thing and left a door ajar in case the weather changed.\n\nShe folded her biscuit in half and then into quarters because hands have to do something. It was notable that her heart did not start sprinting as if chased; it lifted into a light jog and then steadied. Mr. Barnes appeared with the slowness of friendship and Elaine from Geography, who knew every hill from here to Calais, slid a cup toward her. She did not say a thing about her father because there was no thing to say that had not already learned all the shapes of silence. She put the card under a book on subjunctives and let its corners flatten out.\n\nThe children were unbothered by the adult plotline they did not know about because their own stories were more urgent. A forgotten PE kit became an existential crisis for a boy who had never cried at anything school had thrown at him and now cried at cotton. A girl who had spent months refusing to write her name any way but suspended in the air wrote it on the line and blinked at her own practicality as if somebody had swapped her pen with a maturity. Safia brought in a news article about an opera singer whose throat had decided to go on strike and demanded in a way that made Hannah proud and nervous that the class talk about bodies and work and what you do when you want something and your body says no. They argued with respect and a few very excellent insults and wrote with care and then ruined their own carefulness with an extra adjective that some of them had the good grace to cross out.\n\nBetween the end of school and the next thing, she walked to June\u2019s to pick up the card in its real cardboard. June sat with her foot up on the pouffe and her face arranged into a brave that was always only ever half real. They handled the card as if it was expensive and not from a pack you could buy for a pound in a petrol station. June didn\u2019t tell Hannah what to do. She didn\u2019t ask. She leaned her head against the chair and sang one line of a song without meaning to, a foolish old lullaby, and they both laughed because nerves will make you laugh at anything, especially tenderness. \u201cHe didn\u2019t come in all at once,\u201d June said finally. \u201cHe was a man who took a very long time to arrive everywhere, including himself. If you call him, call him as if he might get lost on the way and need to be fetched. And if you don\u2019t call him, don\u2019t call him. There\u2019s no prize for either. I\u2019m here afterwards either way.\u201d\n\nThe show accordioned the week again, a strange concertina of normal and not. There was another rehearsal with the band, tighter, looser, sweeter. There was a fifteen-minute slot with a television person who seemed genuinely to believe that if the nation learned that Hannah liked cheddar more than brie, the nation might feel better about its own choices. There was a message from the man in Folkestone with the misspelled subject line that somehow made her forgive more than the content did\u2014\u201cSaw you again\u201d with no punctuation, as if saying something without a capital would make it less dangerous. She replied with a sentence that did not close doors; she kept her weather. When she put her phone away after sending it, she put her hand flat on the desk of her classroom, on the gum that a hundred bored children had once stuck under there and been forgiven for, and felt the table forgive her back for whatever she was about to break or mend.\n\nA parent did corner her one afternoon with the fierce politeness of someone who had spent too much of their life writing letters in blue ink. The woman had concerns about priorities. She had read\u2014she didn\u2019t like to say where\u2014that fame could destabilise a person\u2019s moral compass and the GCSE syllabus in one go. Hannah let the woman say it all because sometimes people have to hear themselves to know they are talking about their own fear. When she had finished, Hannah said, \u201cYour daughter will get the same me she has always got. She will get the best me I can give. I will be here before the bell and after it. I will hold a space open for her and point at her commas. I will say no when she is unkind and yes when she risks being brave. And then I go to London and sing and it doesn\u2019t take the chalk out of my hand. It just takes me for a bit and brings me back differently. If you like, you can not watch. If you like, you can come to parents\u2019 evening and make me say all this again. I\u2019ll say it as many times as you need.\u201d The woman\u2019s mouth went soft. She said, \u201cAll right,\u201d as if she had expected to be argued with and someone had instead offered her a cup of tea. She sent a follow-up email with a single line: Thank you for doing both.\n\nSome nights, when the house was very still and the cat had given up pretending it didn\u2019t live there, she sang without sound. She shaped the words and let air do what sound would do without waking the neighbours or the griefs she had promised not to water after dark. She stood by the window and watched the ferry\u2019s slow grace and felt the town at her back, a weight and a mercy. On one of those nights, when the day had been full of good small events and a single unignorable ache, her phone lit up with a message that said simply, Are you awake. She was, but she typed, I can be tomorrow, which was the kindest way of saying not yet. The reply did not come, which was a reply.\n\nIn the music room, Mr. Sands wrote a note on a scrap that then became important because he had written it. It said: The third song will need a different kind of quiet. Sit differently. He offered her nothing else, because he was not a man to apologise to a person for the mountains becoming steeper. She knew what he meant. The first quiet had been a held breath. The second had been a hand raised for hush. The third would be a silence you invited yourself into because you knew now it was a room and not an absence. She took the paper and put it in her pocket, and it warmed there until the next Wednesday, when she unfolded it and it made perfect sense, but only because she had had a Tuesday in between that contained three hours of detention, a child with a sore heart, and a gull so enormous it looked like a rumour.\n\nThe semi-final\u2014that was the language other people used; she thought of it as another square of light\u2014came nearer and brought with it a new kind of message from the programme. \u201cWe\u2019re thinking,\u201d the producer said carefully, \u201cabout a small\u2026 community element.\u201d Hannah braced, because community in television is often code for tidy sentiment. \u201cNot literal,\u201d the woman went on, hearing her brace over the phone like a wire. \u201cNo children on a stage. We were humiliated by an ethics lecture from your headteacher and have come to respect the man. But a chalkboard. A desk. A light like late afternoon. If we do it right, it will look like where you live. You can say no. If you say no, we will do blue lights and pretend we thought of blue this morning.\u201d\n\nHannah put the phone between her ear and shoulder and thought about the room and what it would think of being imitated. She pictured 9C as a ghost on a London soundstage and wanted not to cheapen it. She also wanted to honour the way a place shapes a voice. \u201cDust,\u201d she heard herself say. \u201cAnd a hum. You can fake the dust. The hum is harder. There\u2019s a weather to the room. If you respect the weather, you can borrow it. If you don\u2019t, you\u2019ll break my heart and whatever\u2019s left of your budget.\u201d There was a delighted intake of air on the other end and the sound of a pen racing ahead of itself. \u201cWe can do hum,\u201d the producer said. \u201cWe cannot believe we are having a conversation about hum. This is why these shows are ridiculous and magnificent.\u201d\n\nOn the day itself\u2014why pretend it was anything but a truer day dressed up\u2014she arrived to find her life suggested in props. A chair that wasn\u2019t her chair but understood chairness. A board cleaner that was too clean. A strip of light across a fake carpet that had the colour of the rectangle in her classroom when the sun was right, which made her forgive them their budget and their smoothing of rough edges. They had even made the air look worked-in, which was a level of artistry she had not expected. She ran her hands along the desk the way you pat a horse, half to calm it and half to calm yourself, and felt the slight give of set builders who had decided not to build the world out of lies. The MD lifted his chin at the light cue and she nodded because they were in agreement: weather first, notes second.\n\nHer father sent a message that afternoon, a wiser one than the last. Can I come, it said, to the telly. Not there, she typed. Another time. Another place. Tea. It was generous and it wasn\u2019t; it was a hand held out over the right body of water at least. He sent back, Tell me if sugar, and she had to sit down in the corridor because the sentence was plain and silly and contained more of him than any apology would have. She wrote, No sugar, because some truths you learn at six and keep. She did not tell June until after, because she was not unkind and because you cannot ask a mother to hold two kinds of nerves at once and still make a salad.\n\nWhen she walked out, the dust and hum worked. The room was a suggestion of a room; the song did the rest. She placed the first word on the line where black marker met whiteboard and let the vowel find the corners. The arrangement sat under her like a piece of floor that had decided not to betray her today. They had added a single bell\u2014light as the sound her fingernail made on the tank glass when she tapped good morning to Gal\u2014and she had argued against it until she heard it and conceded that sometimes the clich\u00e9 and the truth share a wardrobe. The audience quieted in phases. The judges did what judges do. The camera remembered to leave her eyes alone and look at her hands when she told it to with an angle of the wrist; she would not have known how to command that three weeks ago. Somewhere in the middle, in the place where Mr. Sands had promised a different quiet lived, she went there. She sat in the blank that wasn\u2019t blank. She opened a door that hadn\u2019t existed last month and found, behind it, not fear, but space.\n\nAfter, you blink and find yourself in a room with fruit on a plate and people making noises like memory is hurting them. The runner with the clipboard looked like a person who had been asked to count rain, but she smiled and stuck a post-it to Hannah\u2019s hand like a new sacrament. It had three names on it and a time and a note: Press friendly. Press-ish. Press no. She tried to follow the schedule and failed because life is the only thing that gets to be in charge. Someone from a newspaper with a reputation for cruelty asked her, with the elegance of a man trying to get blood out of a stone, whether there were any men in her life who might be proud tonight. She said, \u201cMany,\u201d and moved on before he could imagine he was one.\n\nWhen it was over, over in the way that means there is always a next, she got the train back and turned off her phone for most of it and looked out of the dark into the dark and felt at home. At Dover, two boys tried to run on the platform and their mother snapped their names into obedience; then she put her hand on their heads gently because tenderness always apologises to discipline if it can. The cat was on the step with a new sense of itself; perhaps it had been complimented by a cameraman and would be unbearable for a week. She gave it dinner that would only encourage it. She took the note Mr. Sands had written and pinned it beside the fridge magnet that said BE NICE OR LEAVE and the electricity bill that made a case for revolution.\n\nIn the morning, the resilience clinic had acquired a queue and Ms. Davis was wearing a cape made of sarcasm and was dispensing pencils with the sternness of a pharmacist. \u201cYou don\u2019t need an appointment,\u201d she told a child who clearly wished she did. \u201cYou need a seat and a willingness to be improved. When I look at you, I see potential. When you look at me, you see me seeing your potential. Let us not waste each other\u2019s time.\u201d The child sat and took a breath and then another and then did their homework, which was a miracle in every direction and also, somehow, not unusual for a Tuesday.\n\nHannah took 9C through a poem that needed them, not because it was obvious but because it had hands the size of their hearts and they could feel themselves being held if they stopped showing off long enough. Noah found the word \u201cward\u201d inside \u201ctoward\u201d and made a joke bad enough to be an achievement. Safia asked if ambition ever calmed down and whether that meant you had to invent a new word once you got what you wanted because calling it ambition forever seemed unfair. They wrote with their heads tilted, the way people do when they are taking themselves seriously and don\u2019t wish to be caught at it.\n\nMidweek, Dorothy rang Hannah at school at exactly the wrong time and so it must have been important. \u201cI have held him off three days,\u201d she said, and Hannah parted her mouth to say \u201cWho\u201d and didn\u2019t have to. \u201cHe is coming to the shop Thursday at ten,\u201d Dorothy went on. \u201cNo grand entrances. I told him if he arrived like a trumpet I would send him to the Oxfam up the road. Bring your ordinary. Wear good shoes because I will make you stand if I need to tell him how much kneecaps cost.\u201d Hannah agreed, and then put the phone in the drawer the way you put a fox in a shed; it was in there safely and you could hear it prowling anyway.\n\nThursday, she went. The morning had the thin beauty of biscuit tea. The shop smelled like old wool and soap and a little like last week\u2019s fish from the market drifting in because it always did. June had her leg up and her lip bravado. Dorothy stood like a general. He came in as if the threshold were higher than it had ever been. He had the look of a man who had never not been tall and who had spent years attempting to shrink. The face was the one she remembered and not, grief and weather and the relief of having no-one to perform for writing their own lines. He took off his hat. He held it. He held himself like a person arriving late to the theatre and trying not to be seen. He saw her. She saw him. They did not do the television thing of making it a picture that someone would keep. They did the human thing of saying each other\u2019s names as if they had to check they still worked in the mouth.\n\n\u201cTea,\u201d June said, with the iron-sweetness of people who have been kind for so long they use a different spice now. \u201cSugar?\u201d He looked at Hannah and she shook her head and he shook his, and Dorothy made three mugs like an offering and put a plate between them that said, in capital letters, CAKE, as if anyone was unclear on what squares of sweetness could do. He said sorry like a man who had tried the word on in private until it fitted. She did not know what to do with it because apologies are not debts you can count. She said thank you because manners were scaffolding and she needed something to hold on to. He told her that he had a life up the road and it had not been a tidy one and he did not make excuses because excuses are a littering habit. He said he had watched her and felt complicated, and she said \u201cMe too,\u201d and they did a small, precise smile that only people unsure of the content of their own chests can do.\n\nWhen she left the shop, Dorothy gave her a bag of picked-over paperbacks and said, \u201cThese are a prop in case anybody thinks you are a person who has never had to carry too much that didn\u2019t belong to you,\u201d and June kissed her palm and pressed it like a stamp. Outside, Dover had decided on bright. The sky treated their town like a thing worth making.\n\nOn Friday, Gal had regrown a rag-edge you could only see if you wanted to, and she wanted to. In class, they had a fire drill that did not feel like a drill to the Year 7 who had not yet learned that alarms are sometimes permission to chat and sometimes practice for not dying. She shepherded them into the cold and told a boy that he was not his panic, he was a person holding it, and he held it because she asked and because he could. Mr. Barnes wore his hi-vis vest like a coronation robe and counted with the bored omniscience of a man who had counted through wars. Ms. Davis confiscated chewing gum with a flourish. Mr. Shaw rescued a snail from a puddle with the care of a saint. The building let them back in because it held no grudge.\n\nThe programme wrote with more times, more rehearsals, more ideas you could say yes to without losing any of yourself you intended to keep. The MD handed her a new chart that looked like the same song had gone to a city and come back with a tattoo. Mr. Sands nodded at the hinge. The runner added a smiley face to her emails which meant she thought she and Hannah were friends now, and they were the sort of friends you become accidentally when you stand together in corridors holding other people\u2019s hopes on clipboards.\n\nOn Saturday night, when the town pretended at being a different town and girls with jackets for shoulders walked too fast on thin heels, she went to the Mariner and sang without cameras, and Maggie gave her the look that meant no nonsense and also six chips on the house because Maggie believed in appropriate salt. A man in the corner always, always called for Wonderwall and another man always shouted him down and they both grinned because rituals keep us from believing time is random. Hannah sang a song she had not sung in years, one her mother had left in a drawer of the house they had lived in before this one, and it worked because the room had decided it would. She saw one of her Year 11s in the doorway and they froze and then remembered who they were supposed to be in public and acted accordingly. They sent her a message later that implied she had not seen them and also that they were extremely impressed.\n\nSunday came heavy and went light. She went to London with the feeling that the part of the story after this would be different if she made it so, and that she could not, after all, make the sea do anything but what it did. Backstage, someone had spilled glitter and someone else had looked at it like a crime scene. She walked out and found the shape and did the thing and heard the room happen. When the result came\u2014because that is what these shows offer, an ending that isn\u2019t\u2014she felt the oddity she had not prepared for. She had been advanced; she had been chosen to go forward by the votes of a thousand living rooms and the calculation of two judges and a bit of luck, and she felt the relief and a nonsense grief for the people who would not go forward with her because you cannot carry everyone and that is unfair and exactly right.\n\nShe got home at dawn and let herself in and did the one thing that made sense. Before she put the kettle on, before she sent texts, before she allowed the day to stack its needs beside the sink, she fed the fish. They came like small suns. Gal arrived and performed a sensible arc. She tapped the glass and the sound was the same sound as ever, bell and nail, small and contained. \u201cWe won\u2019t let it unmake us,\u201d she told him, and he turned and vanished into his own water as if to say that he, at least, had figured that out. She made tea and stood at the window and watched Dover rehearse itself into the morning with the confidence of a town that has survived worse news and better and will again. She had songs to learn, she had books to mark, she had a father\u2019s number in her phone and a mother\u2019s voice in her ear and a fish with a fin like a flag not yet at full mast, and for once, she could stand in the middle of all of it and not feel like she needed permission. The gulls were up and ridiculous. The ferry sounded softly, a held note. She breathed and let the day happen the way weather happens\u2014quietly and then all at once.",

Dover went with a blue that wanted to be taken seriously and a wind that kept trying the doorhandles. Hannah woke to the kettle\u2019s old sermon and the cat on the windowsill doing its impression of a saint wronged. She made tea and fed the fish before she remembered to stand in front of the day and agree to it. Gal came up from the greenery in a measured way, not the swaggering charge of a week ago, and his tail had lost some of its raggedness, the edge silked back into itself like a torn shirt mended by a patient hand. He ate and did not perform, which in its own universe was a vow.\n\nThe email for the week had arrived in the night with times and rooms and the confident tone of a person writing down a tide table and believing it. Tuesday: press. Thursday: rehearsal. Sunday: show. The producer had written, lightly, Remember to breathe, and Hannah found herself annoyed and grateful because she possessed a professional stubbornness about being told to do the things she was already doing to stay alive. She put her hand on the banister as she left the flat, said thank you to nobody in particular like a person salting steps against ice, and went down into a morning that had put its collar on straight.\n\nSchool was a machine too big to have feelings and yet somehow had them. The first bell made its own weather. A piece of paper on the staffroom table announced a bake sale in aid of something the geography department had started calling The Earth. Ms. Davis had expanded her Resilience Clinic hours and was already presiding at a table with a queue, dispensing stern permission slips for courage. Mr. Shaw had a new tie in a shade of porridge that suggested porridge had ambitions. Mr. Barnes moved down the corridor in his natural state, which was triumphant containment. In 9C, the fish engine hummed like a small vow and the board was clean. She wrote, under the date, A sentence is a kind of kindness if you let it be, and under that: Macbeth: the bits we missed because we were busy being brilliant.\n\nThey worked that first period with a steadiness that might have been boring if you had been untrained in the art of noticing. Noah introduced a clause that threatened to overwhelm the sentence and then cut it with a small show of grief and pride that only people who love commas can pull off. Safia sat differently, her chin up at an angle that suggested she was, for today, keeping several feelings in alphabetical order. A boy who had never understood that grammar was just a way to share a brain with someone else wrote four lines that were less like showing off and more like standing next to someone without startling them. The room warmed, not temperature so much as agreement.\n\nAt break a note came through the vaguely functioning internal post like a message in a bottle. Dorothy, said the front in her crabbed hand, and inside was the summary you would want from a person who made summaries out of chaos for a living. He will be in Thursday at ten, it said. He will be sorry at a level that may or may not be useful. You will be kind at a level that may or may not be wise. Bring biscuits. We will need ballast. Hannah folded the note and put it on top of the exercise books for 9C like a talisman. She lifted it, because you cannot ask talismans to carry actual work, and put it in her pocket.\n\nShe did the Tuesday publicity with a practiced wariness and a fledgling ease. A producer took them to the east pier for a shot that would never behave, gulls heckling like MPs and wind insisting on hair as theatre. The camerawoman with the nose ring, who had now become Hannah\u2019s favourite because she did her job without needing to be seen doing it, filmed Hannah walking along the railings as if the railings had written to request it. They filmed the tank again with extreme tenderness, and the sound man spoke reverently into his furry microphone as if it were a small animal that would be offended by lies. They placed a light in her classroom that made the dust look like a choice. She let them, because sometimes you can tell when somebody is borrowing the truth and not stealing it.\n\nIn the corridor afterward, a man with a lanyard asked for a comment about her journey and Ms. Davis walked past and said briskly, \u201cIt\u2019s a noun that has been tortured,\u201d and everyone laughed the slightly wicked laugh of people who needed to move the world forward a fraction and knew the only available lever was humour. The local paper sent a boy so new he had elbows for personality and he asked Hannah if she had any regrets. \u201cLoads,\u201d she said, because it was the only honest answer and because she liked to leave a young journalist with a clean sentence even if it made no headline.\n\nThe producer rang the next day to talk about the final song in a tone that pretended it wasn\u2019t called a final. \u201cWe\u2019re hearing it with a swell,\u201d she said, clicking a pen like a metronome. \u201cNot a syrupy one. Something that says ferry, not wedding. The MD is thinking low brass, a suggestion of horn, the sound that holds the bottom of a room up when a voice gets brave.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot a trumpet,\u201d Hannah said, thinking of men on small stages doing too much with their cheeks. \u201cSomething that remembers being useful in fog.\u201d\n\n\u201cExactly,\u201d the woman said, relieved as if somebody had named the weather. \u201cAnd as for the set\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNo children,\u201d Hannah said, because she would not let her classroom be converted into a moral she didn\u2019t control. \u201cBut a board. A line of light. Something chalky that isn\u2019t literal chalk. And if you can make the hum, you can have it. If you can\u2019t, we go simple and let the sound do the work.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe hum,\u201d the woman repeated, half laughing, half determined. \u201cGod help us, we\u2019re staging hum. I\u2019ll have props and lighting cry into their lattes and then make me proud.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, she put on a coat that made her look like the sort of person who returned phone calls on time and went to the charity shop at ten. It felt too early for reconciliation and exactly right for tea. June had reorganised the shelves with her own logic, biographies next to whisk recipes and a stack of crime novels smiling at a broken clock. Dorothy stood behind the till like a bouncer at a church fete. He came in as if the bell didn\u2019t want to ring for him. He had a hat because men like him think hats make them better behaved. He took it off and held it, which was almost a prayer. He had her mouth and somebody else\u2019s sorrow. He said her name like a listener testing a speaker. She said his like she was making a list and stumbled over nothing and considered it a victory that her voice didn\u2019t wobble around the edge of old.\n\nThey sat on the chairs that had belonged to a wedding and a church and now to the general public. Dorothy brought tea with the moral heft of a union leader and put the plate of cake between them as if marking on a map where conversations can pivot. He said sorry with less drama than television would want and more care than she had given him credit for. He mentioned a town up the road, a job in a place that smelled of oil and time, the years he had spent talking himself out of movies in which he knocked on doors and was considerate at last. He did not ask for forgiveness as if it were a prescription. He put a card on the table as if he might be asked for proof of existence. He laughed once at himself and did not linger in the laugh as men sometimes do when they are pleased with their own charm. He looked at June the way a man looks at a mountain he did not climb because the weather he had brought was wrong.\n\nJune was magnificent and ordinary, which is to say she did not make of the moment a statue. She poured tea and enquired after weather and handed him the biscuit with the most jam like a queen and would not have him say more than the room could hold without cracking. \u201cWe like you alive,\u201d she said, when he said he did not deserve it, and that seemed to satisfy her terms. He asked if he could hear Hannah sing in a room that was not on the television and Hannah said yes in the restrained, risky way of someone who had decided to be specific. \u201cThe Mariner,\u201d she said. \u201cSaturday. Maggie has rules. And chips. Chips most of all.\u201d\n\nWhen she left them, the sky over the High Street had gone fat with possibility. She carried an empty shopping bag so she would look like a person on an errand and not like a person who had changed the way she carried her own past. She went back to school through the narrow bit where the wall leaned in and down the stairs, touching the banister twice on the same journey for luck or because she couldn\u2019t help it.\n\nIn 9C, Noah was trying to build a sentence that could carry a thought without collapsing and was making the face of a person who insists on carrying the wardrobe alone. \u201cTwo verbs,\u201d she told him, gentle with the truth and stingy with unnecessary mercy. \u201cOne of them can carry. One must sit down.\u201d He snorted and made the cut and then pretended the relief belonged to nobody. Safia rolled her eyes at a line in Macbeth and then read it out like she had written it and wanted feedback, which is as much as you can ask of anyone. At the end of the period, a girl who never spoke first walked up and said, \u201cMiss, when you\u2019re on the telly and they clap at the wrong time, it annoys me. Not because it\u2019s wrong, just because it\u2019s wrong. Anyway.\u201d She left, and Hannah stood a moment longer to feel the gift of that wrong-shaped confidence being handed over with a shrug.\n\nThe set rehearsal on Thursday was a lesson in faith placed in people who have a religion called Lighting. The props team had made dust without making it sentimental. The sound tech had found a hum in a box and then tuned it so it felt like a building breathing. The MD stood with his low brass and his string section and in the half-light the instruments made shadows that looked like old ships. They tried the first verse in a key that made her voice brace and then undo, and she said, quietly because you do not shout at people trying to help you, \u201cOne lower,\u201d and he nodded because this was the work and not a favour. The bell they had argued about came once like a coin under water and because it was not forced it didn\u2019t make her hate it. She stepped into the hinge and this time handled it without stepping on its foot. The second quiet\u2014that was last week\u2019s trick. The third was a room you had to find without eyes. She felt it open somewhere between her chest and the part of the stage she might have claimed if she were a different woman. She sat down in it and did not apologise.\n\nFriday, the tank decided to have an opinion. She came in from a lunch duty that had involved persuading a group of Year 8 boys that arguing about crisps loudly does not make them philosophers, and heard a sound that did not belong. The filter was working too hard or not hard enough; she couldn\u2019t tell with machines that lived under water. Gal hung in the corner with the program of a man who wanted to be left alone to make his own foolish mistakes. She turned off the lamp, turned it on again, watched the bubbles. Mr. Shaw arrived like luck and leaned down so hard his tie dipped and came up printed with flecks like confetti. \u201cWe\u2019ll syphon,\u201d he said, the way you say \u201cWe\u2019ll march\u201d if you have a different kind of job. He produced a tube from a cupboard that shouldn\u2019t have contained it and a bucket that had once held custard and the air in the room changed from panic to a plan.\n\nSafia and Noah were deputised as junior aquarists and took the roles with the gravity of an emergency. \u201cSpa, not disco,\u201d Hannah reminded them, and they worked as if the phrase had been part of a sacred text. Water slid obediently into the bucket and the bucket into the sink and the sink tried to be helpful. Gal, to his credit, did not take the opportunity to make himself into a Greek tragedy; he held his water and his temper. When they had refilled and salted and turned the lamp down to mood rather than theatre, the tank settled into its hum like a person into a chair. \u201cWe can\u2019t fix everything,\u201d Mr. Shaw said, not looking at her, because kindness does not make eye contact while it\u2019s being the truth. \u201cBut we can keep the water decent.\u201d\n\nThe Mariner on Saturday smelled like a decision. Maggie pretended to be cross about the televisions and was actually pleased, and she announced to the bar that \u201cthe rules still apply\u201d as if she were guarding over a moral code and a jukebox. Hannah wore ordinary clothes that looked deceptive in their effort, and when she sang the first song the room behaved itself like a Wednesday church that had understood the sermon. In the second, she saw the door open and a hat appear and the man under it fail to come in and she sang anyway because she had not changed the rule that you do not chase people into rooms they have not chosen. Dorothy, who had honed the art of seeing without intruding, ghosted into the doorway at the same moment and performed a glance that asked a question and got the answer it had expected; she nodded, went back to June, and left the door ajar. Hannah closed her eyes long enough to feel the ache and not long enough to make a theatre of it. She opened them and the room gave her back to herself with the usual gifts, the chips and the laughter and the man who always wanted Wonderwall and the man who always forbade it and their little play inside her bigger one, which was all any of them could reasonably carry.\n\nThe Sunday of the final refused to behave like a special day. It was the same kettle and the same thin light through her kitchen blind and the same cat with the opinion of a baronet. June sent a text that was an emoji of a potato because she had discovered them in her phone and would not be dissuaded. Ms. Davis sent a picture of a pencil like a baton. Mr. Barnes sent a photograph of a tie that looked illegal. Mr. Sands sent no picture, only words: Sit differently. The MD sent a link to a clip of a cello being tuned in a church and a sentence that said, oddly, this is the hum. Dorothy sent, briskly, Weather fine at ten today. Your father not dead. Your mother very alive. Don\u2019t trip.\n\nBackstage had learned her shape by now and did not jostle. The runner with the clipboard had spent her week on other people\u2019s accounts of fear and had not lost her manners; she handed Hannah a microphone like a chalice and said, \u201cWe\u2019ve lit the hum,\u201d and did not laugh at herself. The brass did their private rituals, oil and breath and grimaces. The strings were warm. The bell waited to be rung and did not mind whether it was in a song or a desk somewhere. The stage manager checked the tape marks on the floor as if they were a low code for a landing. The light guy had found a way to make the dust glint once and then forget itself, which was the line between sentimentality and art and he had managed to step on the right side of it. Hannah stood in the wings and thought of all her banisters and in doing so made a rope with them and found she could hold it. She thought of the tank, which now made peace reliably enough to be taken for granted, and of Gal, who had chosen, in recent days, the path of ordinary life as a means of carrying on. She thought of her father\u2019s hat in a doorway and of her mother\u2019s peas and of a house where a cupboard was closed and wouldn\u2019t cry until later.\n\nThey called her name without ceremony because the ceremony is the bit that costs and her portion had already been spent on light. She stepped out and placed her feet where the tape said the world would hold them. The audience went to the place they had learned to go when a song began to make a room without their help. She put the first word on the board inside her head and watched it write itself in a hand she recognised. The brass under her didn\u2019t elbow; they shouldered. The strings laid a tablecloth and stood back. She breathed for the length of a ferry\u2019s horn and began.\n\nShe let the second verse pick up the day and put it down without breaking the handle. The third quiet came like a corridor you had to go down alone and she went down it and found at the end a window she could open with one hand. She felt the bell arrive the way you feel a guest you were dreading surprise you by wiping their feet. The room did the right sound. The judges did their jobs. She did not look at them. She looked up where the dust lived and told the dust something without words about second chances and small engines and ferries that come when they say they will, and then she lifted the last words off the table as if they were a good plate and you were closing the kitchen for the night.\n\nThere were the noises. There always are. Approval. The particular applause that is relief pretending to be celebration. The voice of a man who gets paid to turn his feelings into an instruction telling people to vote. The red light where the camera lived like an obedient star. She said the appropriate sentences to a presenter whose kindness was real enough to be useful. The panel said sentences that would make sense in other kitchens later. She left by the door you leave when you\u2019re needed somewhere else. In a corridor, the runner put her hand on Hannah\u2019s arm for a thickness of a second and said, \u201cGood,\u201d and nobody argued with her, which, in television, is almost a miracle.\n\nOn the train home, she turned her phone over and back on the little table as if it were a coin deciding what to be. Messages piled on each other like puppies; she sorted them with the practiced absence of a teacher marking thirty books in an hour, lightly, while saving the heavy attention for what plainly needed it. June sent a photograph of Dorothy asleep on the charity shop sofa in a position that suggested she had won a fight with gravity. Mr. Barnes had recorded his television saying \u201cMiss Flint\u201d out loud and sent her the clip with the caption: I have trained the machine. Ms. Davis had written, Resilience clinic fully booked. Will now be franchising. Mr. Sands had written only, Nice chair, by which he meant: you sat differently and it worked. Her father had written, Only cried once, and she put her head in her scarf for a moment because she had not thought to measure herself against that unit.\n\nDover was cold and clean and unfazed when she arrived back in it, which helped. The cat considered the question of appearing surprised and decided it was beneath her. The dress for once did not get the chair; it went straight to a hanger like a person with a mortgage. She put the kettle on and stood at the window, the old indulgence of watching a town practice being itself before she rejoined it. She slept without needing to talk herself into it, coin-drop, cool.\n\nMonday decided it wanted to be mostly Year 9. They arrived with news written on their foreheads and a craving for ordinary like you crave salt. Safia had perfected an eyebrow that said you had done well without endorsing anything that might embarrass her; she did it twice, which amounted to parental approval. Noah had written a letter to his future self that contained a joke so dreadful it made its own weather and an instruction to remember how to breathe on trains; he pretended he had written it for homework and not because of feeling. A boy whose talent was to laugh loudly at the wrong time managed to sit through the hinge of a poem without exploding and then went out into the corridor and ran a lap to disperse the pressure. In the tank, Gal did a tour like a general reassuring his troops that, sorry, the hum will continue. There was a lurch at lunchtime because someone had written something about her online that stung for six minutes and seventy-two hours at once, and Ms. Davis confiscated her phone the way she confiscated gum and handed it back with the authority of a pharmacist. \u201cOne an hour,\u201d she said. \u201cOr you will rot your teeth.\u201d\n\nThere were practicalities because real life is always practicalities no matter how the lights behave elsewhere. She did an inventory of glue sticks and found it wanting. She set detention for three people who had done nothing wrong except perform their despair at the wrong time and she sat with them while they did their homework as if they had meant to. She filled in a spreadsheet that pretended to track meaning. She called a parent and said, carefully, that their child was nearly a poem. She met with the head and the woman with concerns and left with less bureaucracy and more cake than she had thought possible.\n\nThe message from the programme that night had a different colour to it; victory and its obligations threaded through the lines. Schedules with earlier mornings, rehearsals that would demand her other hands. There would be a filmed piece in Dover, with the permission of those willing, about where she sang when nobody listened and she put a stop sign on the charity shop by writing a single sentence: My mother does not belong to you. The producer, to her credit, wrote back, Absolutely, and added three hearts and the phrase, Against form, which made Hannah like her more.\n\nIn the quiet square of late, when the cat had admitted defeat and slept unguarded and the radiators sighed like an old ship docking, she took out the card from her father and held it under the lamp. He had a number and the barest bones of a signature and a blot where the pen had refused and he had forced it. She dialled because she did not like to teach children courage and not model it at least in small, survivable amounts. It rang. He answered with the startled sound of someone not used to receiving anything he wanted. They arranged tea without saying the word sorry again, which felt sane. \u201cThe pier caf\u00e9,\u201d he said, grateful to have a noun to hide behind, and she said \u201cYes,\u201d and then they hung up before politeness could get in the way.\n\nHe was there on Wednesday with his hat and everything he had not known how to offer. The pier caf\u00e9 remembered him without permission because buildings keep secrets and refuse to divulge unless asked kindly. They chose a table by the window where the light forgave them both. He told her a story about a ferry he had nearly missed in 1993 and the woman he had admired on it for three hours and the fact that when the ferry docked he had not followed her because the idea of her had become something else and his courage had been spent on making the story instead. He told her a smaller story about a budgie he had kept for a winter when Hanna was little and then given away because its happiness had become a mirror. He didn\u2019t explain the metaphor because the caf\u00e9 would not have survived it. He asked her, halting, for a selection of nothing that added up to permission. She gave him some. He did not press her for more. He looked at her mouth when she spoke as if to reassure himself that it still worked like his did. He paid and pretended not to. They left together and gave the gulls a thing to comment on and parted before the point where they might have tried to fix more than a morning could hold.\n\nIt was a good day to teach Macbeth. The class took delight in the witchy bits in a way that would have concerned the medieval but was perfectly healthy in a building with three fire extinguishers per floor. \u201cVaulting ambition, which o\u2019erleaps itself and falls on the other,\u201d Hannah wrote, and Safia muttered under her breath that sometimes ambition just tripped on a step and made a noise and kept going, which felt like a modern footnote. Noah asked whether Macbeth would have been happier as a teacher and then answered himself with a brisk \u201cNo,\u201d which made the room exhale. They drew lines on the board not because they were making graphs but because sometimes you need to make a visible path between a feeling and a word.\n\nOn Thursday, the programme came with a small swarm to film conversations they would later call \u201cpackages,\u201d and 9C pretended to be uninterested while clearly measuring how this would accumulate into story. Mr. Barnes held the line like a man on a towpath and the crew were good and careful and took off their hats again. The boy with the loud laugh pressed his lips tight until the camera went past and then was released and laughed the laugh of a person who had survived being quiet in public. They filmed the outside of the school and the inside of the sea and something in between, and even Ms. Davis admitted in the staffroom afterward that the nose-ringed camerawoman had an eye for hum and left the biscuit plate suspiciously emptier than before, which was as close as she got to a compliment.\n\nThe final rehearsal in London was less about notes now and more about spine. The MD did not stop the band between phrases to fix; he adjusted air. \u201cFrom the breath,\u201d he kept saying, not because he was in love with a metaphor but because he had made a habit of being right. The stage manager marked the places where panic tends to pool, the corners and the middle and the bit where your shoe snags on tape that was not there yesterday. The runner now knew her tea order and the fact that before walking out Hannah liked the feel of a pencil in her pocket even though there was nothing to write on out there; she put one there without comment and ticked a box you will not find on any form.\n\nSaturday night, Dover did its best impression of a different town again and put pinks in the sky it couldn\u2019t afford. The Mariner was full of a kind of pride that did not require anybody to lower their eyes. Maggie gave Hannah a look that said no nonsense and everything and handed her a piece of bread that felt medicinal. A man in a corner wiped his eyes and nobody saw him do it. A girl from Year 11 thought she was invisible until Hannah waved at her and then remembered she was supposed to be someone else in public and posed, badly, for a selfie she would later pretend had been ironic. Hannah sang a song that had more air than sound in it, because the room would let her, and a woman from Wales who was nobody\u2019s aunt gave her a hug afterward that smelled of lamb fat and laundry and left her steadier than she had any right to be.\n\nSunday morning she put her coat on and did the thing she had done enough times now that the place between nerves and ritual had become habitable. Tea. Fish. Hand on banister. The hum. She went to London and the city pretended it had been waiting. In the wings she put her hand flat on the wall and thanked it, because she had become a person who thanked bricks. The MD looked at her and did not say good luck, because men like him do not believe luck should take the credit. He lifted his hand and she nodded and they both had the unglamorous look of people who are about to do exactly what they said they would do.\n\nOut there, the hum had been installed. The board shone because someone had wiped it down with a ferocity usually reserved for sins. The light lay on the fake carpet like a real one waits for the day\u2019s first foot. She stepped into her mark and spoke the first line into a room that had agreed, for a handful of minutes, to be a classroom without walls, and the sound went up and came down and didn\u2019t break, and the show did what shows have done for a hundred years in halls with dusty curtains and cavernous ceilings and had the decency to get out of the way.\n\nLater, on the train that was rapidly becoming a second living room, her phone would buzz with a message from a stranger that said, in the rough grammar of someone who valued urgency over correctness, \u201cYou made me think. And I\u2019m not a thinker. Don\u2019t tell my husband.\u201d June would send a photo of a potato that had been carved into a heart because someone had come into the charity shop that afternoon with nothing to do and too many knives, and Dorothy would caption it, Art, and add, in a second message, He doesn\u2019t wear the hat indoors, marriage saved. Mr. Barnes would send a video of his tie hanging over the end of his banister like a flag at half mast and a line: We will require cake. Ms. Davis would send nothing but leave a pencil on Hannah\u2019s desk the next morning, point sharpened, eraser unused, and the resilience clinic would have a sign-up sheet with three pages of names, none of whom were in need of anything a biscuit could not at least begin to address. Mr. Shaw would tie a new tie in the morning because porridge, left unsupervised, is a destiny.\n\nBefore all that, though, there was the night and the step and the hush and the hinge and the bell and the line where breath became note and note became a room and the room became, for once, a place where she could put down everything she was carrying and not be asked for a receipt. The ferries would still move; the gulls would still scream like a committee; the fish would still discover the same filter and not be disappointed. She would still go back and mark the subordinate clause and explain to a child that sometimes the moral of a story is that you are tired and you should go to sleep. She would still answer the phone to her father and say, Yes, tea, the pier caf\u00e9, two sugars for nobody. She would still make a note and put it on her kitchen table that nobody would see: Feed fish. Breathe. Okay. She would still laugh at herself for needing instructions and then follow them like a person who had finally decided to be kind.\n\nIt was when she was standing in her kitchen later, the dress hung up like evidence, the cat deciding whether to purr or litigate, that the email arrived with the sort of subject line that knows it is important and has not yet learned humility. Congratulations, it said, and gave a time and a date and a list of obligations that would reshape her next month like weather. The finals would not be a single night but a campaign. She had become a person whose life would, temporarily, be written as a schedule and she was not frightened in the way she had expected to be. She took it in and turned off the light and went to the window and looked at Dover being exactly Dover. The ferry sounded an old note. In the tank, the engine hummed like a promise made by someone ordinary and kept. She put her hand to the glass and Gal came, not because love works like that but because hunger and light do, and she laughed at the analogy and forgave herself the cheapness and went to bed.\n\nThe next days did that trick time does when it knows you\u2019re watching: they went both slow and very fast. In school, they diagrammed sentences because sentences are the bones of courage, and when Noah tried to add a fourth clause as if making an argument louder made it right, she raised an eyebrow he had learned to respect and he sighed and cut it and beamed without admitting it. Safia wrote an essay that ended with a question and then a statement and then crossed out the question, a victory of discipline over drama that could have been taught but had in the end been decided. A boy who was not a reader came in carrying a paperback as if it were a mug that might spill, and when she asked him why he had it he said, as if confessing to a crime, \u201cIt had a dragon,\u201d and she nodded because all decent roads begin with dragons. The resilience clinic introduced a sign that read: You are allowed to bring a friend. You are not allowed to bring a flame thrower. The graph of improvement grew like vines around the windows of Room 12. Ms. Davis adjusted a cape none of them could see and took attendance as if it were a sacrament.\n\nIn Dover, the charity shop saw a run on dresses for weddings that had not yet been proposed. June presided like a benevolent weather front, and the shop briefly became a station where half of town came to admit small hopes and be assigned a price sticker appropriate to their budget. Dorothy wrote a sign that said: Advice is free. Sarcasm is extra. Remarkably few people paid, perhaps because Dorothy, when asked, refused to accept anything but cake.\n\nLondon asked for more of her than it had before and she said yes without bleeding in public. The MD added a thread of harmony that made the bell look over its shoulder. The low brass did a rehearsal with the door open and a man from a different show put his head in, frowned, and then nodded and walked on as if checking the weather for a trip he had not yet booked. The runner with the clipboard had officially run out of battery and yet somehow kept going, her hair now permanently part of the communications system. A wardrobe woman with the bite of a good sister insisted on different shoes because you cannot stand in that place wearing hope alone; your feet will have opinions.\n\nOn a Thursday that started with rain and the taste of metal and ended with a rainbow that refused to be twee because it had to exist somewhere, her father sent a photograph of a mug with a tea stain on a saucer and the edge of a newspaper and a line: Three things I brought with me to the coast: a book I pretended to read, a regret I\u2019ve stopped polishing, and a thermos. I wouldn\u2019t mind if I had to share the thermos one day. She sent back a picture of a pencil and a kettle and a fish, and he replied with a series of question marks that made her smile in spite of her caution. June, uninvited to that exchange, texted an entirely unnecessary warning about men and the way they mistake showing up for penance and then undercut herself with, Bring potatoes Sunday. Dorothy, not given to subtlety, wrote: You\u2019re allowed to send him for milk and not say thank you.\n\nWhen the call sheet for the final-final came through, it had that alarming link of columns and obligations that had once made her think of air traffic control and now made her think of school timetables; confusing until lived, then automatic. They wanted an interview where she talked about what singing had saved her from. She wrote back and said in as many words that the interesting thing was that teaching had saved her, too, and where would they like to put that, and the producer sent a reply composed entirely of exclamation marks and the word Yes, repeated until it bored even itself and became moving. They wanted a shot of her in the empty classroom after the last bell, and she told them to take off their hats, and they did, and the room agreed to be a television for twenty minutes and then returned to itself as if television were a weather that passed.\n\nThe cat, because it was not owned by anyone\u2019s narrative, developed a cough that lasted briefly and with a drama that threatened to destabilise the entire week and then disappeared as if purchased, used, and returned. The neighbour upstairs continued to do soundproofing to an unknown end result. The banister continued to offer itself and she continued to take it. The fish hummed. The engine hummed. The town hummed. The song in her chest hummed. She went to London and said yes to a microphone and no to a director who wanted her to turn and look at the camera on the word love, politely, because that was a stage direction her body would not obey without lying. She opted for speaking the word as if it were an object you set down carefully, and he threw his hands up and said, \u201cFine, fine, art,\u201d and then turned to terrorise somebody who had wanted to be terrified.\n\nOn the night itself\u2014the last one they would count and then insist meant the most\u2014she stood in the wing and thought of the cards she had been dealt and the ones she had refused and the ones she had not even seen on the table. She felt the hinge under her feet as a promise and not a trap. She lifted her head because Mr. Sands would have said so and she had learned that listening to him made a life easier in ways that were not always musical. She went out into the light and said the first line in the voice of a person who knew that endings are sluttish things and will go where they want, and she did not begrudge them. She asked the room for a quiet that was not silence but a kind of attention, and the room, small miracle of strangers, gave it. She stepped through and did not fall.\n\nWhatever was going to happen that night happened the way wind happens\u2014according to rules and without them. Someone would win and she might not and it would be both important and not. She would go back to school and tell Noah to be kind to his adverbs and tell Safia that she could hold the middle of an argument without declaring war. She would go to the pier caf\u00e9 and drink tea with a man who had been late his whole life and had brought a thermos as proof of intention. She would stand in a charity shop and be assigned a price that would make someone believe in their own reflection for an hour. She would watch a fish regrow himself into something like grace. She would put her hand on the banister and feel it cool under her palm and think, every time, of all the ways you can go down without falling.\n\nAnd when, very late and then too early, she woke up into the sad sweetness of after, she would feed the fish before she made tea because that was the order that made sense to her, and Gal would present himself like a small sun and take what she gave and swim on like an agreement made between two creatures who had never met in the wild and were making this one up. She would stand by the window and watch the ferry do its slow and faithful work and think that the best part of any of this had not been the applause or the lights but the moment in a room when somebody had listened and changed a molecule and everything around it had had to rearrange to make room. She would hold that in the way you hold heat in your pockets when it is January and the town cannot help you with the cold. She would go to school. She would be the person with the chalk. She would hum. She would make weather and let weather be made. She would not forget, because forgetting would have felt like a betrayal and she had had enough of those to last all her lives.",
