     "novel_text": "There were ants in the sink again. Not the occasional troop you get when summer is near and jelly has been left open, but a black, churning seam that found the hairline fractures in the porcelain and worried them like teeth. He watched them for a long time\u2014longer than anyone would admit\u2014standing in his bare feet on cold tile, palms flat on the counter, soft laughter breaking out of him like a wheeze.\n\n\u201cHungry?\u201d Bruce said to them, but it was to himself. He said it again, because repetition strengthened the magic. \u201cHungry.\u201d\n\nHe dipped two fingers into the sugar bowl, spread a little sweetness along the wet rim where the ants hesitated, and saw them surge, more and more, in that beautiful mindless ambition. The ceiling fan whirred. Something ticked in the other room. He felt it all as one knit sensation, a mild pressure at the base of his skull.\n\nHe ate the first dozen. Pinched them carefully as if handling eggshells, tilted his head back, and let them fall into his mouth. He chewed very slowly. Crunch. Crunch. The taste was faint, but he had trained himself to notice the faintness, like learning to read rain on glass. Each bite gave him a sliver of something that was neither food nor memory. He laughed again. It misfired out of him in a chirp. Ragged man, ragged laugh.\n\nThere was a photograph face down on the kitchen table. He didn\u2019t flip it over. He had promised himself a day of looking away, and so he did. The promise felt like a torn thumb grazing a thorn and he relished that too, the precise little hurt of it. He ate seven more, and then wiped his fingers on his shirt and sat in the chair that leaned. He knew the chair would give eventually, because everything did.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you,\u201d he said softly, but he didn\u2019t mean the ants.\n\nOutside, the estate stretched in a haphazard grid of pebble-dash semis and saplings the council had put in and forgotten. The street\u2019s single lamp snapped off as the morning came up, thin and undecided. A fox trotted, head low. A woman carried a plant across the road like a baby.\n\nBruce listened to the drain glug and thought about a field where something had happened, and then he thought about not thinking about it. He picked a sliver of ant leg from his molars with the corner of his nail, was shocked at how human that felt. It was easier not to be human when he was eating, which was a stirring contradiction he admired for its smallness. He loved small things. Small things could be made to vanish.\n\nLater, when he laced his boots and tied the lace twice and then once more for luck, he told himself that regret was a form of fuel, and he was well supplied. His breath fogged the hallway mirror and left a smeared oval. He smiled into the oval. The smile looked like a scar. Passable, he thought. He put the photograph in his pocket without looking at it, and went out.\n\nThe morning was a raw sheet over the Chesterfield edge. The crooked spire would be a thumbprint on the sky if he climbed far enough. He thought about that for a while as he walked: the spire, the sky, the thumb. He touched the hole in his jacket where it had snagged on barbed wire last winter. He laughed, soft and to himself. He liked to laugh. It kept him from thinking, which kept him from remembering, which kept him moving. A chain of cheap miracles. He bit the pad of his finger until the sting made him breathe in sharply and feel clean. If he had been watched as he crossed the roundabout and took the side path where the hedges were thin and too symmetrical to be honest, his shape might have looked like anyone\u2019s.\n\nHe knew only the precise moment he would stop. Everything before was routine and everything after was wind.\n\n\u2014\n\nOn the other side of town\u2014in the old part, where the streets kinked and became alleys and the stone had something moist about it\u2014DI Thomas Cassidy was pretending not to be a writer.\n\nHe had shepherded himself through three interviews that morning, two for the book and one for the job, and each had been a different kind of bad. He could do the job interview in his sleep after twenty years. You take responsibility, you don\u2019t take credit, you remember to say safeguarding and strategy and partnership. You polish your vowels. It was the book ones that scraped at him. The woman from the radio wanted to talk about method; the man from the local paper wanted to talk about his hair, which had gone white down the middle in a cat-scratch. He played along. He kept smiling. He did not mention Bruce, because there was no Bruce yet, not publicly. He did not mention ants or regret or the field where something had happened, because he liked to keep his life in boxes. He had always been neat.\n\nHis phone buzzed as he was leaving the caf\u00e9. His mum, he thought, with a text about Sunday. But it was the desk. He almost didn\u2019t take it. He took it.\n\n\u201cDI Cassidy.\u201d\n\n\u201cBoss, you\u2019re needed.\u201d\n\nWhen his sergeant said you\u2019re needed in that clipped tone, it meant not needed so much as required, as if the town had put its thumb on his chest. Cassidy felt that old familiarity rise in him, like the way you step into a coat that fits because your body remembers. \u201cWhere?\u201d\n\n\u201cNear the reservoir. Walker found\u2026 something. It\u2019s odd.\u201d\n\n\u201cOdd how?\u201d\n\nThe sergeant made the sound that meant an unsolved word. \u201cYou need to see. We\u2019ve got officers en route. And, uh, there\u2019s a note. Kind of. Not a note. You\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\nCassidy looked back through the caf\u00e9 window. His face cut him off as if it were unfamiliar. He had been telling himself he would take some time; he had been telling himself he would write things down in a way that kept the ends clean. The book\u2019s cover had a detective on it who was better looking than he was. He thought this would be funny, and it had been funny for exactly a day.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m coming,\u201d he said.\n\nHe walked to the car briskly. He did not run. He did not text his mum. He did not call his ex, who would have said, You are incapable of telling me the truth about your own needs, and then hung up, and he would have had to agree. He joined the main road and watched the houses open out like a final breath.\n\n\u2014\n\nThe first time he saw her after the field, Bruce had been eating ants. This was the trick his mind played: it boggled his body into action when it remembered too much. He could not say when it had started. He was nine or thirteen or twenty and it had been a joke at first, because boys make jokes with their bodies when they are afraid. He remembered the school trip where they had dared each other to eat a worm. He had not done that, because he thought of the worm\u2019s children, but he had eaten the ants then\u2014a handful, a gulp\u2014and learned something bright and hard about the way small lives enter you and disappear. Years later, the joke became a ritual. Years after that, it was the only thing that could mop up the noise.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d she had said that time. He could not see her face, only a suggestion of hair in the doorway, and the door kept moving as if someone were trying to close it and could not. \u201cDon\u2019t do that in the house.\u201d\n\nHe had laughed, and the laughter had come back at him from the bare floorboards. \u201cI know what you\u2019re doing,\u201d she had said, and he had laughed again because he didn\u2019t. He never did, not really.\n\nThere were gaps in him, and he had learned to walk around them. You sidestep. You pretend the missing shapes are a choice. You say sorry in a voice that sounds like someone you might forgive.\n\n\u201cNot in the house,\u201d she said again, and walked away in those soft house socks that never made a sound.\n\n\u2014\n\n\u201cHis name\u2019s Darren Peake,\u201d said the constable at the reservoir. The wind came straight off the water. It pushed the grass down flat in one direction and then changed its mind. There was no shelter. The constable\u2019s ears were red and raw and the tip of his nose shone. \u201cWalked his dog early. Dog\u2014Monty? Marty?\u2014went mad over that ridge, and when he got there, he said he felt\u2026 I don\u2019t know. Funny.\u201d\n\n\u201cFunny,\u201d said Cassidy, and tasted the word. The ground had that sucked at flavour of peat. \u201cIn what way?\u201d\n\nThe constable shrugged. \u201cHe said he was laughing. And he wasn\u2019t a laughing sort, from the sound of it.\u201d\n\nThe ridge sloped down to a shallow basin where the heather changed to a skin of cracked clay. You could see the water had sat here in the rains, and then gone away and forgotten to take something with it. In the middle of the basin, someone had laid out small circles in a larger circle, careful as a schoolkid\u2019s project. At the centre was a jam jar.\n\nCassidy approached. The circles were not stones or coins or paper rosettes. He bent, used the edge of a pencil to nudge one, and pulled the smile out of his face the way you remove a splinter.\n\n\u201cAnts,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re everywhere,\u201d the constable said, backing up. \u201cSorry. Makes my\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Cassidy. He knew the feeling. The ants themselves had been trapped in tiny plastic lids\u2014the kind you pop off milk bottles\u2014thin film over the top to keep them in. A hundred tiny, fuming prisons, set out with extraordinary neatness. The jar in the centre was full of water. In it, a scrap of paper floated like a drowned insect.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t touched anything,\u201d the constable offered, and Cassidy nodded. Good lad. He stepped carefully between two of the lids and took the jar with both hands as if it were an egg. He looked at the paper without disturbing it. A felt-tip had bled in water into a grey fog, but the letters were still legible.\n\nHe read it aloud. \u201c\u2018One of us has to laugh. One of us has to eat. One of us has to remember.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cWho writes that?\u201d the constable said, as if it were indecent. \u201cWho thinks of it?\u201d\n\nThe wind lifted and put his hair in his eyes. Cassidy put the jar back exactly where it had been. The note gave him a taste of metal. It was theatrical and yet not; no declarations, no name, no signature flourish. He thought of the radio interviewer asking about his method and wanted to go back and apologize to the air for having wasted it.\n\n\u201cGet Scenes of Crime,\u201d he said. \u201cNo prints, no shoe marks. Someone spent time here. Look at the spacing.\u201d He measured with his eyes. \u201cThis is deliberate. Not rage, not a tantrum.\u201d\n\n\u201cBoss, there\u2019s another bit.\u201d The constable had squatted, then jumped up as if he\u2019d been caught stealing. \u201cThere. The line. Is that\u2014?\u201d\n\nCassidy followed his gaze. Around the outside edge of the ring of lids, a faint trail had been drawn in something greasy. The late sun made it sheen. It could have been oil. It could have been something else. The ants who had escaped\u2014because of course a few had\u2014crawled over the line and then stopped as if surprised. Some turned back. Some walked in place, confused into a circle a few inches across. The closer he looked, the more wrongness he found.\n\nHe took out his phone. His hands looked ordinary and perhaps tired. He photographed the circle from three angles. He photographed the note in its jar. He photographed the footprints around, all of them the same size, the same tread; a single pair of boots pacing a careful circumference. He photographed the empty land beyond, which looked as if it had been waiting and would continue to wait, untroubled by ants, cops, men.\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s Mr. Peake?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cIn the car, keeping warm. He\u2019s shaken. And he thinks it\u2019s a message.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is a message,\u201d Cassidy said, and felt the warmth of how obvious that was sink into the cold wind. \u201cHe\u2019s right. It\u2019s a message to us, and to someone else.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo who?\u201d\n\n\u201cTo whoever knows the other half.\u201d\n\nThe constable bit his lip in the way young men do when they are trying not to do something else. \u201cBoss?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat line. What is it made of?\u201d\n\n\u201cSmell it,\u201d Cassidy said, and immediately regretted it. He\u2019d said it without thinking. The advice of an old man to a boy. He squatted and touched his glove to the sheen and held his fingers under his nose. The scent reached him: faint, sour, kitchen-sink. He knew it so well he couldn\u2019t place it. He had a moment of oddness\u2014as if his childhood kitchen had been tipped into that basin. Then he had it.\n\n\u201cSugar water,\u201d he said. \u201cOr something like it.\u201d He looked at the constable. \u201cA trail.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor the ants.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor the ants, and for us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho would\u2014?\u201d\n\nCassidy had an answer in his mouth. He didn\u2019t say it. He shook his head instead and turned away, his boot making a perfect print next to the nearest lid, then lifted carefully so as not to blur the edges.\n\n\u2014\n\nHe ate two on the lip of his cup, just to be sure he still knew how. He made sure to be seen eating them, because that was the right game to play. The woman at the next table twitched when she realized what he was chewing. He smiled and said, \u201cThey\u2019re very clean,\u201d and then laughed, which made her get up and leave. He didn\u2019t want her to leave. He wanted to tell her something. He couldn\u2019t name the something, and that unnameable thing was a shape that hung in front of him for the rest of his tea. Sometimes his wanting struck him as funny: two proper words sitting next to each other like kids in a school photograph, and him unable to introduce them.\n\nHe thought about the reservoir. He had done that carefully, he thought, good boy. He liked being a good boy. He touched the photograph in his pocket and felt the corner bite his thigh. \u201cOw,\u201d he said, and laughed, and then inhaled the laugh as if it were smoke to be kept. He would go home now and sit at the table and take the photograph out and not look at it. He would line up ten grains of sugar on the wood and crush each with the tip of his thumb. He would phone nobody. He would boil eggs and undercook them on purpose and eat the whites and throw away the yolks softly into the bin because he couldn\u2019t bear the sight of that dense yellow with its eye. When he did not bear things, he destroyed them gently, as a courtesy.\n\nHe paid with coins and left the receipt in the saucer, folded into a crane he had not learned to make, and felt a sudden radiant certainty that someone was watching him. He turned slowly. Nobody. The caf\u00e9 was empty save the girl who wiped the tables and let her hair curl over her face like vines hiding the side of a ruined house, and the bell that hung by the door and chimed when nobody touched it because of the passing bus. He thought: Not yet. Then he thought: Soon.\n\nAt home he laid the photograph flat on the table and did not look. He turned the radio up. The presenter spoke in a voice like a spoon stirring tea and then fell into a song that was mostly a humming. He put his head down and felt the wood. He made himself still, made himself vanish, the way he had learned in school when the teacher asked where the twenty pence had gone and he was the only child with a pocket big enough to hide it, even though he hadn\u2019t stolen it, not that time. The trick of vanishing, of being so still you cease to throw off reflection, served him better than honesty ever had.\n\nWhen he finally turned the photograph over he did it with ceremony, a flair of his hand, as if he were revealing a card. He saw the girl. He saw the weeds behind her as if they had been planted specifically for that purpose. He saw her mouth, a crease of carelessness he had loved, and he put his finger on it and then took his finger back as if it had been bitten.\n\n\u201cHi,\u201d he said. It was both too formal and too soft. He found a black dot near the corner of her smile with a smear trailing away and realized it was an ant that had gotten itself flattened under the lamination. He laughed. He would have cried if he had remembered how.\n\n\u2014\n\nHe should not have gone home. He should have stayed in a hotel. He should have put the map on the table at the station and made circles on it until the map looked like an overripe fruit. He should have said yes when his sergeant said we can handle this, go to the launch and wear the jacket. He did none of that. He went home because his mother had put stew on and would be offended if he didn\u2019t at least pretend to try it.\n\n\u201cYou look thin,\u201d she said, because this was her line and she loved it.\n\n\u201cI am thin,\u201d he said, and smiled a little because he could.\n\n\u201cWhat did you do this morning? Don\u2019t say nothing. And don\u2019t say \u2018cases\u2019 like you do.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was at the reservoir near Ladybower,\u201d he said, and felt her attention focus in that maternal way that lifted his shirt and pressed an ear to his chest. She had grown up on stories of bodies in water. He softened his tone. \u201cA thing. Odd. We\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot a suicide,\u201d she said, making it a statement that could be argued with.\n\n\u201cNot obviously.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot another girl,\u201d she said, softer.\n\nHe thought of the circle of lids, their mad precision. \u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201cEat your bread before it gets cold,\u201d she said, and there was such fierce love in it that he ate half the loaf and a bowl and a half of stew while promising to have friends, to sleep, to let the album he didn\u2019t like run because she liked the quiet bits. He lay on the sofa while she washed up and looked up at the ceiling where the early damp was bloating the paint like skin over a bruise. He told himself he would sleep and then he would write and then he would go back to the station and start the loops that investigations become. He closed his eyes. He saw a jam jar in a basin.\n\nWhen he woke it was night and the television was presenting him with a situation in which everybody was smiling and he could not find their eyes. His phone buzzed. He had never changed the settings; the default trill made him think of cheap offices. He ran a hand over his face and let the missed call be missed. He went outside to smoke even though he had given up, because this was habit rather than need. The cold took his breath away like a slap he felt he deserved.\n\n\u201cTom?\u201d his mother said behind him, a voice low and safe. \u201cYou\u2019re shaking.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d he said, and tried a joke he didn\u2019t have.\n\n\u201cGo to bed,\u201d she said. \u201cWrite in the morning.\u201d\n\nHe did not sleep. He stared at the patch of dark at the corner of the ceiling and watched it stretch a slow finger out. He thought, not of his book, but of the boy who had eaten ants for a dare and learned something peculiar about himself. There is something wrong with you, he told the boy, without malice. The boy shrugged. There is something wrong with all of us, Tom, but most of us have the decency to keep it under our tongues.\n\nAt four he opened his laptop and stared at the paragraph he had been carrying around for a month. He deleted it. He typed instead: It begins with a circle and a jar and many small lives. He typed: Sometimes a monster is a man too stubborn to stop. He typed: He laughs. You wonder what he\u2019s laughing at.\n\n\u2014\n\nHe had never been to that part of Chesterfield before, though he lived not far and had a map of the town in his head with the tidy print turned to smudges at the edges. The woman\u2019s house was the color of bread. He stood across the street and waited for the feeling of certainty to arrive. It took its time. When it did, it rolled over him like a badly thrown coat.\n\n\u201cBruce,\u201d the woman said, opening the door before he knocked, as if him being outside had pulled some sinew on the inside of her tight. \u201cYou\u2019re late.\u201d\n\nHe stepped in without looking at her hard enough to have to own it. He knew where the kitchen was. He put his hand on the back of one of her chairs as if bracing himself.\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing,\u201d she asked, \u201ctoday?\u201d\n\nHe smiled. She had always typed her questions in proper sentences. \u201cWorking.\u201d He let the word sit and cool. He put his fingers flat on the table. One of them had a small black stain near the nail. He made a fist and the stain disappeared.\n\n\u201cWorking at what?\u201d\n\nHe laughed, soft and absurd. \u201cAt not wanting anything I can\u2019t have.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you bring it?\u201d\n\nHe looked at her then. She had cut her hair to the top of her neck, and it made her look as if she had been boiled down to essence. He loved and feared essence. He reached into his pocket. He put the photograph on the table and slid it with two fingers so that she could flip it. She did not. She stood with her hands clasped in their own company. She did not want to look at the picture and he did not want to see her look, and so they stood in a perfect stalemate of tenderness.\n\n\u201cDid you\u2014\u201d she started, then stopped, then smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re laughing. Why do you laugh at me?\u201d\n\n\u201cI laugh because I don\u2019t know what else to do,\u201d he said, and because I\u2019m afraid that if I stop laughing I will speak.\n\n\u201cWhat will you say?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he offered, too quick.\n\n\u201cFor what?\u201d\n\nHe spread his hands and looked down at them. Ten fingers. Ten stories. None of them good. He had been born wrong. He wasn\u2019t born wrong. He had walked into wrongness like a church and lit a candle.\n\n\u201cFor the field,\u201d she said after a long time, and the word was a blade pressed flat against his tongue. He nodded. \u201cFor the field. For that morning. For,\u201d and she waved her hand at the air as if there were a flavor in it she could not name, \u201cthe laugh.\u201d\n\nHe waited until his smile felt natural and then he held it until it hurt. \u201cI\u2019ll do better,\u201d he said. It was a child\u2019s promise. She was too tired to call it that.\n\n\u201cI need you to go now,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI am going.\u201d\n\nHe went down her path with his hands in his pockets and his head tucked in like he could retract it into his shoulders. At the bottom of the road he turned left and walked until his legs had a pleasant, stupid ache. He stepped into the park and sat on the first bench that would have him. Children\u2019s voices rose and fell and collided like birds that hadn\u2019t yet learned each other\u2019s wingspan. He put his hand onto the worn slat and the warmth of it startled him. He had not expected warmth, and so he laughed where nobody could hear.\n\nNothing solved the field. Time did not. Eating did not. Laughter did not. He had in fact made the field larger, by drawing circles around it in every act of forgetting. He thought about the policeman with the white hair who would have seen the circles on the clay and understood that they were pretty, and had flinched anyway.\n\nHe took a sweet from his pocket. It was a boiled sweet, the kind his grandfather had sucked until it collapsed like a lung. He put it in his mouth and crunch-crunched it too soon and felt the shards prick his tongue. He swallowed the sensation. He stood, and the bench exhaled him.\n\n\u2014\n\nWhen the news broke that evening it was a small story on a slow day, and then it wasn\u2019t slow anymore. Reporters like to be given a shape; this had a shape, neat and practical and menacing. Nobody had died. Nobody had been hurt. And yet the hairs rose. The photographs looked like art and failure. The words were too few and thus too many.\n\nHe drove to the station and endured the press. He made a statement for both sides of himself, the procedural and the public. He did not say the word ants because it would turn the whole thing into a joke before they had time to decide whether or not it was one. He said pattern and an item and perimeter. He did not say laugh because that was a private domestic sound that did not belong to a town.\n\nWhen he got to his desk there was a letter. Nobody sent letters anymore unless they were dangerous or sweet. He looked at the envelope and put it aside and told himself he would get to it. He got to it at eleven at night when the building had that hollow quality of places that have had people in them too long. He slit the top and tipped the sheet onto the desk. It slid obediently.\n\nSometimes he left a case with the taste of iron in his mouth. Sometimes it was sugar.\n\nThe letter had been written in a neat school hand. There were no loops where there should have been loops and the t\u2019s were crossed in a hurry. He read it once, twice, three times, and on the third his hands did a small involuntary thing which he obeyed, a kind of tightening that made him aware of the cords of his wrists.\n\nIt said:\n\nI have been laughing for a very long time. It keeps things in. It keeps things out. I don\u2019t know which is kinder. Maybe neither. We are going to take a walk, you and I. A careful walk. I will make the maps. You will follow them. We will be so polite about it that nobody will get cross. It\u2019s a game. It\u2019s serious. Don\u2019t let anybody take it away from us. Put the jar back where it belongs.\n\nHe folded the letter along its creases and then folded it again and then again until the paper took on a stubborn thickness. He did not look to see if anyone was watching him. He put the letter in his pocket where it lay alongside his phone, which buzzed as soon as the paper touched it as if offended by the contact of a more patient medium.\n\nHe texted his sergeant: Been sent a letter. Bring gloves. Bring your brain. Bring tea.\n\nHe turned off his computer and sat at his desk by the thin lamp while the station hummed and clicked. He hadn\u2019t meant to write about any of this. He had meant to write something cleaner, something that made a person look good. He thought: That\u2019s never been my kind of truth.\n\nHe thought about a man, a boy, a monster. He thought about regret as a kind of chemical you can breathe in and find height on. He thought that the first thing he would do in the morning was call the woman who had been in each of his cases without being in any of them and ask her to remember something she had never told him, and he would take her silence as a form of precision, as he always did.\n\nThree floors below, in the station\u2019s tired lobby, a woman in a red coat stood looking at a noticeboard with her hands in her sleeves. She turned once, to the left, then to the right, and then she left without having learned what she came to learn. Such movements were made everywhere in the town, and together they traced a pattern only one man wanted to see.\n\nBy midnight, the jar had been stolen from the evidence room.\n\nBy morning, someone had put it back on the basin under the sky.\n\nIt sat there, patient as a promise, reflecting nothing. The ants had escaped their lids. The ants had gone home. Or maybe they had simply stopped being on the surface long enough for human eyes to bear it. The wind moved the heather\u2019s feathers. Not much else.\n\nA fox trotted and paused and snuffed and sneezed. Somewhere in the low scrub a laugh went on too long to be a joke, and then folded itself neatly the way a paper folds and did not belong to anyone at all.By the time Cassidy reached the basin the morning had put a thin scab of light over the water and the midges were dancing as if no order had ever existed. He stood with his hands in his pockets for half a minute because the idea of touching anything felt like complicity, and then he went forward because not touching felt worse. The jar sat where it had sat the day before, filled to the ring with water that had clouded slightly, as if it had learned a new word in the night and decided to keep it. The lids had been scuffed and overturned by nothing larger than the wind; their cargo had fled, if you believed in flight as a form of morality, and the pattern that had been a nursery or a cruelty\u2014depending on your perspective\u2014was now only litter with intention. He crouched, and his knees made a sound he minded, and he breathed through his mouth until the damp stopped smelling like something locked up. He could not escape the feeling that the land had shrugged and returned a toy to a child because it preferred quiet to truth.\n\nA car door popped and then a second, and DS Patel came over with her chin tucked into her scarf and a face set for bad news, which was to say neutral. She had the kind of eyes that clock everything and reveal nothing until you buy them a coffee and talk about the thing you really care about, and he appreciated that in her, because he had in recent years found the direct glare of competence hard to bear. She didn\u2019t say good morning. She looked, and when she was done looking she gave him the rectangular nod that meant she had confirmed the data her brain had already hypothesized. \u201cEvidence room,\u201d she said, only those two words, because the rest were either a lecture or a complaint and she preferred to be paid to do those. He nodded back and thought of the warder\u2019s bored mouth, the clipboard, the camera that had been installed in a ceiling tile and was probably now peering at a recorded absence like a blind eye. \u201cAny note?\u201d he asked, and she blew a breath into the air as if she could see it accrue on his question and fall to the ground in a shape they could both interpret. \u201cIf there was, it didn\u2019t get to me,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re doing a trace. We\u2019re doing a count. Everybody\u2019s voice is too loud in the corridors.\u201d\n\nHe touched the jar with a forefinger and the water dimpled politely. The paper inside had bloomed at the edges in feathery filaments and he felt an oddly filial dismay at the idea of words perishing. Patel put on gloves and lifted the glass with both hands and he watched her hands, thinking again that hands are the only honest part of most people. \u201cPut it in the boot,\u201d he said, then corrected himself, \u201cNo, leave it. That\u2019s what he asked. He asked us to leave it.\u201d It wasn\u2019t the instruction that bothered him, it was his own obedience to it, the way he found himself nodding to a man he hadn\u2019t met because the request had arrived in the right tone. Patel watched at an angle that kept judgment to a minimum. \u201cYou\u2019re taking his letters personally,\u201d she said, and he had the grace to laugh because she had cut off his excuse before it reached for the desk. \u201cHe wrote to me, not the team,\u201d he said, and it sounded like vanity even to him. \u201cHe wrote to your role,\u201d she said. \u201cHe wrote to the shape of you. It\u2019s not the same as being seen.\u201d\n\nThey walked the circle as if it might protest, keeping to the flattened grass where their own boots had made a clean path the day before, because there are courtesies even in trespass. He tasted iron then sugar then iron again, and realized hunger had become a language he spoke without thinking. \u201cWhat do you make of the line?\u201d he asked, and she bent and touched her finger to the sheen and sniffed and did not flinch. \u201cKitchen,\u201d she said. \u201cCheap sweetness. He wants movement. He wants to choreograph the least of things. He\u2019s auditioning us by how we step.\u201d The word audition struck him as both precise and indecent; he was not a stage he would willingly sell tickets to, but he knew he had been one before now, and that was what made the job turn in his hands like a tool he sometimes distrusted. He stared towards the far bank where the heather gave way to saplings, and as he stared there was a glint that did not belong, a wink of not-nature. \u201cThere,\u201d he said, and Patel was already walking, boots placing themselves in a polite up-down as if they were old guests of the hillside.\n\nThey found it on the third sapling in a line that had never grown as tall as their planners dreamed, a tiny twist of wire holding the corner of a sandwich bag to a branch at the height of a careful man\u2019s chest. The bag contained a scrap cut from a map, and Cassidy felt something inside him drop with the relief of being given a thing he could name. He took the bag down, and because he had already decided to lean into whatever this was, he opened it with the care of a boy unwrapping a present for a sister he liked. Ordnance Survey, one-inch squares like a cattle grid across the land; blue for water, a pale courteous green for the national park, the bones of old farm tracks like bruises. Someone had drawn a narrow line on the paper that crossed three grid squares and paused at the edge as if waiting to be invited into the next. The line was thin and confident and of a kind with the handwriting on the letter, though he knew that was him writing novels onto scratches. Patel held out her hand. \u201cMay I?\u201d she said, and he gave her the piece and watched her eyes do the small dart of a brain speeding up. \u201cHe wants you to meet him on the way or to discover he has already been,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t tell which.\u201d \u201cBoth,\u201d he said, because that felt true in his chest where truth sometimes sat like a bird with its hackles up. \u201cHe wants to be foreknown and he wants to remain a surprise. All men want that. Some don\u2019t have the nerve to write it down.\u201d\n\nHe had not slept properly, which meant his body had gone to work on his mind and shaken out whatever formal arrangement he had made of his thoughts and left them in a heap. He leaned on the bonnet of Patel\u2019s car and phoned the station and arranged for scenes to trample politely and asked that the acting DCI be told because there was an evidence breach and it would be worse to make him hear it from the grapevine. He hung up and found it hard to take his hand off the metal. Patel watched him for a moment that was almost maternal and then reset it to professional. \u201cWe\u2019re going to need to wear this carefully,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re about to be fed. Sometimes being fed is a way of being fattened.\u201d \u201cHe said walk,\u201d Cassidy said, because he had been raised to answer what was in front of him, and she nodded in a way that condensed two decades of experience into the thickness between one eyelid and another. \u201cThen we walk,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd we make sure we\u2019re the ones doing the map when he thinks he is.\u201d\n\nBruce woke to the sound of a neighbour\u2019s baby performing its first opera of the day and discovered he was unreasonably proud of it. The wail sawed the air and then softened to a learning, and he lay on his back and looked at the flake of paint that hung over his bed like a question he had decided not to answer. He had not dreamed, or he had dreamed the dream that was a corridor with doors and behind each only light. He felt lightless in a way he had learned to call clean because the other word he had for it was wrong, and he was trying to be good by himself. The photograph lay on the table where he had left it, which struck him as both naive and romantic, because objects rarely obey in his experience unless they are too small to argue. He went to it and put his finger on the girl\u2019s mouth in the picture and pressed until the lamination made an indignant creak, then withdrew his hand with chastened grace as if he had trespassed on ground that kept a polite fence. He boiled water and made tea and got the timing wrong on purpose because he wanted to drink it too soon and scald his tongue and be forgiven for it by nobody at all.\n\nHe had not learned good craft in his life, only knack, and he distrusted knack because it turns on you and says you never loved me when you try to keep it. Nevertheless he laid his things on the table with a ceremony that would have embarrassed him if anyone had been watching: the arcade of milk bottle lids he\u2019d cleaned and stacked, the jar with its mouth shining like a wound, the tiny shears that made him think of midwives, the roll of tape he had stolen from a job he\u2019d had for a week which he had left with a lie so polite it had been read as truth. He arranged these as a penitent arranges candles, then he ate one ant which he had trapped under a glass overnight on the rim of a saucer as if he were a monstrous child playing with a felt zoo. He closed his eyes and tasted the nothing that wasn\u2019t nothing at all, and was grateful because gratefulness had the same shape as prayer in his mouth and he did not have the habit of the latter. He told himself the map he had made of the far bank was correct, that the stream bed would hold even after the rain because the bed had been made by water older than his father. He told himself he had written the letter neatly enough that the man would understand it as an invitation and not a dare. His chest fluttered and he pressed a hand there as if to iron his breath flat.\n\nIn the kitchen he had to step around the ants, which was an outcome he had created and then resented as if it had happened to him by an unkind universe. He took the sugar out to the step because the woman had said not in the house and there were lines he would not cross even when he was role-playing a monster for a man he had not met. He laid a trail on the low brick wall that hemmed in his square of grass and watched the first scouts find it; he loved the way a decision made by a dot became a tide, the way motion turns into the idea of motion and then into instruction until everybody moves because a single body did. He thought of the field as if it were a square he could step around and found himself standing on it as if memory had had the bad manners to make itself immediate. When he laughed it was not at the field, though the woman would have thought so if she had been there; it was at his own ridiculous belief in geometry as a salvation. \u201cCircular thinking,\u201d he told the air, and there, that was a joke, so it was safe to let himself breathe again.\n\nHe wrote again, because the first letter had opened a gate in him he had half bricked up, and now there was an ugly satisfaction in pushing through. He wrote slowly, licking the tip of the pen because children do it in cartoons and it felt right, and he frowned without meaning to at the slope of his letters because neatness had once been a way to not be hit. He did not sign his name because he did not believe he had one that would be recognized by the man he was writing to, which felt both dangerously romantic and sensibly anonymous. On the fourth line he drew a small circle he did not need to draw and immediately went to the sink and washed his hands as if the ring had gotten somewhere you didn\u2019t want anything to get. He came back and blew on the paper and he folded it and he slid it into the sandwich bag and he sat and waited for conviction the way some men wait for the kettle to reach the shiver that tells you coffee will not be an insult. When it did not come he put his hands flat and took the photograph and put it in his pocket and went out because motion is a muscle and you have to work it or it refuses to work for you when you need it.\n\nCassidy had always distrusted the stretch of town between the petrol station that never took cash after eight and the district of houses that might have been built in a night by a man with a box of bricks. It wasn\u2019t the crime, he told himself, because crime is everywhere and wears the same shoes so you can hear it coming if you know your steps; it was the way the streets refused to learn their names, corners that insisted on anonymity as if language were a kind of surveillance. The map in his pocket told him to cross, then to cross back, then to take the alley behind the shops where broken glass turned into glitter if you stood where the sun wanted you to, and he did as he was told because not doing as he was told would constitute a different kind of obedience. Patel walked beside him, patient and square in the way of a person who had learned not to rush if you wanted to find what you were after. \u201cHe\u2019s making it public enough to be seen,\u201d she said. \u201cHe wants witnesses without having to suffer being watched.\u201d \u201cHe wants a chorus,\u201d he said, and that made her laugh, a brief unmusical breath that made him like her more. \u201cIf I find you writing this down as a metaphor,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019ll tell your mother.\u201d\n\nThey were not the only ones on the walk. A man pushing a pram at a slant that suggested he\u2019d not done it before and was trying to learn the wrist of it. Two boys with scooters like weapons they hadn\u2019t yet decided to use. A woman with a dog that looked like it had been made from spare parts that had turned out handsome. He took a photograph of the corner where the alley spat them out and looked at the image and flinched at the way the paint on the gable end had peeled in a pattern that looked like a map of lakes he had camped by with his father when he had been small enough to believe maps stayed still once you put them away. Patel took his phone and looked again and he did not object because she was looking at the wall not the camera roll. \u201cThere,\u201d she said, and he felt foolish for not having seen it sooner, because it was not cunning. It was tape, clear as a conscience, pinning another packet of paper to the back of the lamppost where the grey paint sucked light. Inside the bag, in a childish hand, because it took effort to write that adultly childish, a note said: Keep left where others go right. Don\u2019t be heroic. Don\u2019t be clever. Laugh if you need to.\n\nHe closed his eyes and the instruction crawled under his skin because it had the cadence of something kind his mother would say if she\u2019d learned to weaponize comfort, and he could not tell whether his flinch came from the tenderness or the fakery of it. He opened them and made himself smile because he had learned that a face, once it is asked to be public, needs to be told what to do. \u201cLeft,\u201d he said, and they went left. The path took them past the school that had been boarded while they put a new one up further away because somebody who liked diagrams had decided distances are warmer than familiarity. Children\u2019s drawings were pasted to the inside of the ground-floor windows, fat houses and thin trees and a sun that smiled because that is what suns do on paper, and taped to the glass with supermarket tape that hauled up the corners. He stopped and placed his hand against the pane on a smear of blue crayon that had wandered beyond its sky. He felt the particular cold of glass that has made up its mind to stop anything happening on both sides, and he took his hand away quickly as if he had been told off. \u201cYou going to tell me what the field was?\u201d Patel asked, not unkindly and not as a provocation but because you have to put your questions somewhere. He kept his eyes on the paper suns. \u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cNot yet.\u201d\n\nHe had chosen a charity shop as a staging post because he liked the idea of things that had belonged to other people making new shapes under new hands. He had brought a bag of clothes to drop at the door, which was the sort of camouflage that made him proud and ashamed in the same breath, because it worked and he wanted to be the kind of man who didn\u2019t need camouflage. The bell above the door made a sound like a laugh clearing its throat. He put the bag down and bent with it and he slid his packet under the table where those who don\u2019t look closely won\u2019t notice anything except the polite problem of storage. The woman behind the till looked at him with a kind of brave indifference that comes after too much practice at being watched. He smiled the smile that took the least muscle effort and had always been useful. He bought a mug without words on it and put a coin in the dish and took his change and kept his hands very still as he walked out because he trusted his hands least of everything he carried around with him. Outside he let himself breathe and then he broke the discipline of a day and ate two ants off his wrist the way other people lick salt before a drink because he needed to know he could still do it and still feel the small windy quiet in his head that came after.\n\nThe packet was found by a volunteer who wanted a second chair for the window display and reached for the wrong thing, and the wrong thing made her squeak and then laugh because that is what you do when there is nobody to see you be frightened. She brought it to the back and they argued for a moment about whether to ring the number that sits near the till and promises to bring men in blue to talk to you without judgment, and then they argued the other way and did it because arguing is a way to pretend you have made a decision rather than had one made about you by the day. Cassidy went because the map had told him to whether he had read that line or not, and as he walked he felt the town readying itself the way an audience coughs and settles the fabric of themselves. He thought again about the book he had promised to write which he had tried to keep separate from his work by erecting a wall he had painted very tastefully, and now he realized a wall is a kind of display if you put any labour into it. He found himself smiling at the notion that his failure to write was the only decent thing about his attempt, and then he did not smile because patting yourself for an absence is a child\u2019s way of trying to get a sweet after breaking a cup.\n\nInside, the volunteer with the beautiful soft cardigan and the face like a careful garden handed him the bag with relief so palpable he nearly apologized. He took the sandwich bag out and read the thin lines. On one, an X had been drawn in thick ink on the edge of a grid square that he recognized as the bottom of Moor View Terrace, and next to it in the same neat hand: Pause here and think about your hands. Do not put them in your pockets. Do not hold them up. Just look. He laughed then, not at the instruction but at the idea that someone thought he could be choreographed down to the angle of a wrist, and the laugh tasted wrong in his mouth because it had borrowed a tone from another man\u2019s laughter he had never heard in person. Patel had known he would do that and so had placed herself behind him so he couldn\u2019t pocket the paper and become a crime scene, and he loved her for it in the quiet way he reserved for people who saved him from being tiresome.\n\nMoor View Terrace was a row of houses that had had their front gardens paved into driveways in a burst of late-century practicality that had turned colours into surfaces. He stood at the corner where the X wanted him and he looked at his hands and felt the childishness of it and nodded anyway because childishness is not always a pejorative. His hands were his father\u2019s hands with the knuckles shaved down by a kinder life. They had learned long ago how to be still under someone else\u2019s shouting and how to move towards a person who had not asked for it without making them jump. He turned them over and the backs looked like maps of rivers he had never sailed, and he stared until the stinging edge of tears made a soft boundary. Patel let him have that, which is an art you do not get taught. \u201cWell?\u201d she said when he dropped them, and he said, \u201cThey\u2019re only hands,\u201d and she said, \u201cThat\u2019s a good and a frightening answer.\u201d\n\nBy mid-afternoon the walk had been a string threaded through the town on a level so domestic it would have been comic if it hadn\u2019t been precise. A packet inside a library book about edible plants that carried underlining that confessed to a different obsessive than the one they were courting. A chalk arrow brushed into a wall where the chalk had been all but blown away, rescued by the fact of a boy\u2019s sticky palm having pressed it there ten minutes earlier. A paper cup with HANDLE ME UNDER NOT OVER written on the rim and a pair of translucent gloves folded inside. Each instruction held a tiny, maddening kindness executed at knife-point, and the mixture made Cassidy feel a bit sick as if he\u2019d eaten a meal cooked by an ex who had gotten very good at pretending a clean slate. They walked and collected and put back what needed to be in place and let go of what would only make the story worse in a courtroom. By the time the light began to flatten with evening he had a map workaday folded into his pocket that showed him they were being steered not towards the field itself but towards the ring of ordinary streets that had learned to live around it.\n\nHe told himself he wouldn\u2019t knock at the woman\u2019s house when the route took him down her road, because knocking meant taking, and he was trying to be the man who left. His feet had other ideas and he let them because sometimes letting your feet make one decision saves you from making ten bad ones with your head. He saw the lamp in her window and knew the shade and knew how the light broke along the edge of the ceiling where the plaster always cracked first and he felt the old softness rise in him like a bruise you press because you think you deserve it. She opened the door before he reached the step and the look on her face lifted and then set like dough that had been overworked. \u201cTom,\u201d she said, and his name in her mouth was a small lesson in restraint. He held up both hands because the note had told him not to put them in his pockets and because his hands were honest, and she looked at them as if they were a pet he had brought home to show her for permission. \u201cHas he written?\u201d he asked, and her eyes did a calculation he did not try to solve. \u201cNot to me,\u201d she said. \u201cTo you always. To me always a silence that thinks it is elegant.\u201d He couldn\u2019t argue with that because arguing would mean claiming to be the man who could change it, and he had given up that role before it made him into something he didn\u2019t like.\n\nHe stood at the gate and told her he would leave her alone and then didn\u2019t for three more sentences because he needed to hear her voice to sleep. She listened as if it cost her money and then she tilted her head the way she had done when they were still in the business of wanting. \u201cIs this the book,\u201d she asked, and he felt heat up the back of his neck like a boy told to stand in front of the class and read the thing he had written in the ink that bled. \u201cI don\u2019t know what this is,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a man making a pattern out of something he did not finish. It\u2019s a man asking me to keep time while he hits the drum.\u201d \u201cYou will,\u201d she said, and did not say because it\u2019s what you do, and he nodded because refusing praise sometimes looks like you are shoving a present back into a hand that needs to give. They stood until standing made both their knees complain and then she said, \u201cDon\u2019t come back unless you are going to sit and shut your eyes,\u201d and he said, \u201cAll right,\u201d and both of them knew it was a promise he would not keep or break cleanly.\n\nHe built his next shape with such care that he made the act of it into a prayer and he let himself believe he was making a shrine rather than a trap, because this distinction mattered to him more than what the law would say later. Behind the old abattoir where the brick had bled and been painted clean and bled again, there was a loading bay that slanted like a jaw that had been broken and set improperly. He rolled the lids in his palm and laid them in the corners where spiders had made nets and abandoned the nets and the wind had put dust on threads until they looked like the hair of old women. He did not trap anything this time, and he thought that might grant him grace or a longer rope. He poured a circle with sugar that glinted as if it wanted to be snow and then didn\u2019t because snow is a lie of softness and sugar is honest about the teeth it makes rot. He put the jar in the middle and he didn\u2019t put paper in it, because not writing is sometimes writing. He stood and looked at his work and saw not art but effort, and effort visible is embarrassing, and so he laughed to break the embarrassment in two. The sound went up and hit the underside of the loading bay and came back wrong like a face you have only ever seen in reflection suddenly turning real.\n\nHe had the letter ready, the one that would go at the next turn and ask the man about the thing men don\u2019t talk about because we have been allowed to forget the right way to do it. He had written: Did you ever laugh in the wrong place, and did anyone forgive you, and did you forgive you. He had written: There is a thing in the ground and I don\u2019t know whether I am digging it up or putting it back. He had written: If you don\u2019t come soon I will teach myself to stop. Then he had crossed that bit out because that was a bluff and he didn\u2019t want to be the kind of bluffer who believed himself. He put the letter into a napkin he had taken from the caf\u00e9 with the bell that rang when the buses passed and then he took it out because stealing was ugly and he was already a thief so he should stop pretending there were lines that excused him. He used his own paper instead and he put it under a flake of paint that had pulled away from the wall with the kind of satisfaction skin takes in healing over a wound.\n\nAt eight, when the station radio got bored of repeating that there were no updates and no road closures and no threat to the public because if you say it often enough it might become true, the night shift constable on the desk looked up and saw a boy with a helmet under his arm and a letter in his hand and a face that had grown serious because faces grow serious when a letter is in them. He buzzed him in and offered him a seat and took the envelope as if it might break and he did not smell sugar because he did not have that word yet. Cassidy\u2019s phone did an angry little dance on his desk and Patel looked at him over the edge of her mug and he shrugged because there is only so much moving you can do in a day before you start to erode your edges. He put the phone on speaker because he couldn\u2019t bear to hold things right now and the new boy\u2019s voice came into the room with the treble of the tiled lobby. \u201cSir,\u201d he said, and that made Cassidy want to tell him to stop, \u201cthere\u2019s a letter for you. It\u2019s got your name on the front and it smells like\u2026 what\u2019s it smell like. Like pancakes.\u201d \u201cSugar,\u201d Patel mouthed, and he nodded because you take your joys where they come and being right is one of the smaller, easier pleasures. \u201cDon\u2019t open it,\u201d he said, and the boy said, \u201cI know,\u201d in a tone that made him think maybe this one would stay.\n\nHe waited until the boy brought it up, and in the ten minutes that took he looked again at the map he had built from other maps, and he placed the abattoir on it like a chess piece moving himself into a corner with a kind of terrible grace. He did not say the word field aloud because he had decided he would ration himself. He opened the letter with Patel watching because that had become their ritual in a day and the body is quick to grow fond of rituals that make you less alone with the worst bits of you. The note had only one line and it was not a line. It was a string of coordinates, grid references stepping like a hopscotch across the town in a shape so stupidly obvious he wanted to call himself names for having the reaction he had. He laid a bit of tracing paper over the map because he still knew how to do that with his hands despite every app making him lazy. He marked the points and then he connected them and then he didn\u2019t need to connect them because he could suddenly see it. The shape did not represent an arrow pointing anywhere useful or a heart or a cross or any of the god-baiting figures men draw when they want to be clever. It was a circle, of course it was, but not perfect; a circle that had been made by a man walking and letting the land knock his shoulder and bend his elbow and make the loop imperfect enough that it looked like a hand-drawn forgiveness.\n\nHe stood with both palms on the table in the room that had been his and would be another\u2019s and he said, only to the air because he had been taught not to grandstand in front of women who know better, \u201cHe\u2019s going to make us go round until we are dizzy.\u201d Patel said \u201cOr until he is,\u201d which cheered him more than it ought to. He took his hands off the table and put them where he could see them. He thought of the boy who ate ants because boys dare each other when they cannot articulate the thing that scares them and he felt the beginning of something he did not want to call pity. If the field had been a blank when he woke, it was now there all over again, a sullen fact under the skin of the town, and he could no longer tell whether the man with the laugh was trying to keep it buried or dig it out for them all to look at and call by its right name. He pushed his chair back and stood and Patel stood when he did and they went downstairs with the kind of polite haste you learn when you need to look like you are not running towards or away from anything.\n\nBecause he had asked for it, the jar had remained where it had been put, and because it had remained, nobody had knocked it, and because nobody had knocked it, a boy had passed in the morning with his dog and asked his father what it was and the father had said he did not know in a tone that had not been tried on that boy yet, and the boy had discovered new respect for his father\u2019s ability to admit ignorance. Because a fox had come in the night and sniffed and found nothing it wanted, the circle of sugar had only softened on one side and hardened on the other where the wind had packed it like a lip. Because men had come back with equipment in marked vans and put on gloves and put tape where tape goes to tell other people not to go where they want to, the jar had looked important enough to make a passer-by think thoughts too large for the place where he lived. There is a chance we call all of this accusation when we write it down later, and a chance we call it context, and the difference will be decided by whose lawyer polishes their vowels prettiest.\n\nWhen it was properly, entirely dark, and the sky had become the kind of bruise you cannot hide with a sleeve, a man stood at the basin where the jar sat and he did not touch anything with his hands. He stood the way a man stands in a church when he has slept with his friend\u2019s wife and is pretending to pray. He laughed once, very quietly, because the night had the courtesy to make sounds private, and he put his head on one side and listened to whether his laugh had hit the same point on the underside of heaven as it had earlier. He waited until his breathing had slowed to the hymn he knew, and then he turned away and walked the direction the map he had drawn would have sent him, and as he walked he counted his steps, not because the number mattered but because counting has always been a way to keep the wolves back. When he reached the gate at the field he did what he had not done for a long time; he put his hand on the post and he stood still, and he did not laugh, and in the cold, the small silence that rose in him felt like the first honest thing he had made in years. He took it into his mouth like a sweet and did not crunch it too soon.He did not put a number to the day when the game became a case and the case became a habit, because numbering is a way of pretending you\u2019re not inside something. He woke before his alarm and lay measuring the edges of himself in the dark, that old police trick of taking stock without calling it fear, then sat up and let the cold find its usual doors. The map of the circle lay where he had left it, anchored under a cup with a chip that he could not bring himself to throw away, and he moved the cup and felt the small disloyalty of leaving coffee rings on a grid. He told himself he would not go back to the basin until daylight because there was nothing to be got in the night except a feeling, and those were cheaper than they looked, and then he pulled on his boots and went anyway, because he was no longer pretending to tell his body what to do. Out there the ground had taken frost like a veil and the jar wore it prettily on its rim, and his breath did the old dragon trick without making anyone laugh. He stood with his hands where he could see them and felt watched by nothing that was not him, and the quiet that rose in his chest had the decency to feel earned.\n\nPatel had seen the mark on the evidence ledger before he told her to look for it, and she brought it to him with the patience of someone who will let you arrive at your own conclusions and not charge you extra for taking the scenic route. The ledger had a neat line scored through a time in a hand nobody owned, and the witness camera had obliged by showing them the square of its ignorance at exactly the right minute. Lorna Haye from Scenes of Crime arrived half an hour into the day with a mouth already going because she had come from another job that had not been spicy enough to untie her tongue, and she swore quietly about the adhesive residue on the jar lip as if glue had personally offended her. \u201cCheapest tape,\u201d she said, holding up a strip to the light so its bubbles showed like fish. \u201cCorner shop. Half the town stocks it and half the men who stock it talk to each other about weather and never about why anyone might need tape at two in the morning.\u201d He liked Lorna because she did not pretend her evidence was a sword; it was a sieve and she told him so, and he respected people who loved their tools enough to disparage them. She sniffed where he had sniffed and said \u201cGolden syrup thinned and not very much,\u201d and he tried not to be sad at the idea that even a sweetness had been diluted to make it last.\n\nBruce had not expected the gate to make a sound like that under his hand, not quite a creak, more a settling, like bones clicking back into the place they were meant for. He had the urge to apologize to it, which was stupid even by his standards, and so he let the apology arrive and sit in his throat where nobody could call him on it. He breathed as if instructed by a calmer man and felt the ache that had nested in his sternum relocate by a fraction, which he counted as a win because small distances can be continents when you are being brave. He did not laugh, and the absence pleased and frightened him in equal measure because it left room around the edges and room is where the bad bits can get in if you\u2019re not tidy. The field did not behave, which was only fair; it presented itself not as an event but as someone\u2019s back garden the council had glanced at and then forgotten, all tufts and old wire and a half-remembered footpath the ramblers had traded rumors about and then stopped. He went to the stile and stepped up and down as if practicing the motion might prepare him for anything that came after, then took his hand off the post and wiped his palm on his jeans with a child\u2019s reflex that he could not teach out of himself. He thought of her saying not in the house, and for a second the line had the exact grammar of a blessing, and then the second was over and he was just a man in a coat on a morning with breath he could watch.\n\nMonty turned out to be Martin, and Martin turned out to be the sort of dog that sat because he had taught himself sitting was the trick that made people look at him kind. Darren Peake had the manner of a bloke who apologizes to appliances when they fail, which positioned him neatly in the middle of a Venn diagram of men Cassidy trusted and men he suspected would lie for the right reason. \u201cI don\u2019t come up here much,\u201d Darren said as they stood facing across the lip of the basin as if haggling with the land, \u201cnot for years, not since they started putting bins in the lay-by and the kids tipped them over for sport.\u201d Cassidy asked him to describe the laughing again and Darren did, carefully, as if the will itself sat on the tongue and might be too slippery to catch twice. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t mine,\u201d he said, and looked embarrassed at having made a line that dramatic by accident. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t someone else\u2019s either. It was as if the place had made the noise and I got caught under it. And then Marty went for it,\u201d he added, which made the dog lift his head with a hopefulness that broke the heart a little. Cassidy held out his hand and the dog did him the grace of not pretending to be charmed, and in return he did the dog the favor of not trying again too hard. He thanked Darren for coming out a second time and did not take his details again because the man was not a suspect, he was a witness to a feeling, and that is hard enough to live with without your postcode attached.\n\nBy noon the press had been fed just enough to make them string the right words into wrong shapes, and he watched the town\u2019s name march along the bottom of the news with its vowels in the wrong order, which is how news always looks when it is about where you live. He sat in the little room that had tried to be a canteen and become a cupboard for a microwave and a kettle and three mugs with their handles mended, and he let a voicemail from his publisher listen to itself. \u201cOnly if you\u2019ve time, Tom,\u201d it said in a cheery tone that had to have been written down first, \u201cand if this case is taking you away then that\u2019s a story in itself,\u201d and he wanted to text a photograph of a jam jar that reflected nothing and say: there is your story, you boil it until it clouds. Patel slid onto the chair opposite his without asking and put a biscuit on his napkin and told him about a kid she\u2019d once had to talk down from a roof by teaching him how to breathe backwards, and he was grateful for the way her stories arrived in a tone that invited you to stand beside them rather than under them. They agreed not to use the word manifesto in front of the cameras because it granted too much dignity to a set of notes that were, so far, no more than choreographies for a walk. He admitted he hated the nicknames the internet had already offered, because putting a picture on a monster makes him easier to swallow, and she admitted she had laughed at one of them and felt stupid after. They were both allowed to be human in the cupboard, and when they stood up they put it away in the place where you keep a spare jumper you hope you won\u2019t need.\n\nHe met the boy on his street when he went out to buy milk he would not drink, one of those lads who had learned to put their shoulders forward as if carrying a weight they hadn\u2019t been invited to lift. The boy had a plastic tub full of mouse-sized chocolates priced too high, and Bruce bought two because you always buy two, and he ate one in front of the boy in case the boy had been instructed not to trust the exchanges of men who keep sweets for later. \u201cYou the one with the ants,\u201d the boy asked with a scientist\u2019s curiosity, and Bruce laughed without meaning to and then stalled it as if putting a hand on a child\u2019s bicycle seat. \u201cI\u2019ve got a bit of a problem with the sugar,\u201d he said, which was almost true and therefore almost respectable. The boy nodded as if a sugar problem was a thing on a list that men had. \u201cMy mum says if you put cinnamon down they won\u2019t cross it,\u201d he offered, and Bruce said thank you with a sincere gratitude that surprised him because sincerity felt dangerous. He took the cinnamon to mean: there are lines you can draw that are gentle and work, and he tucked that away alongside the list of things he swore he would not use. When the boy left he put the second chocolate in his pocket and forgot it, and the brown wet circle it made on his thigh later felt like a small wound that had been nothing but a sweet a few hours before.\n\nLorna brought him a report that said nothing and managed to make that useful, the way good reports do when they refuse to plump themselves up with words. The sugar had been syrup cut with tap water and the tap water had been no particular tap; the lids had been handled with hands that had recently been washed and dried on a towel that had lint enough to assume a busy house. There were no prints that would hold up past the first mention of a glove, and the shoe marks were the same as yesterday\u2019s shoe marks, which meant he had been danced here and the step had been meant to sting as a repeat. \u201cHe\u2019s all kitchen,\u201d Lorna said with the fond malice of someone who will happily mock your palette while praising your knife work. \u201cAll domestic. If he goes big it will have to be by using smalls a lot.\u201d He heard a shape in that and put it aside because if he looked directly at it he might make a speech about men who graduate from a trick to a system and call it salvation, and he had promised himself he wouldn\u2019t get preachy on a Tuesday. He asked for a list of shops that sold that tape and she sighed the sigh of a woman who would make him his list and then need to watch him misread it, and for a second his chest hurt with love for his team which he would never say out loud to any of them unless they were hurt or drunk.\n\nThe woman at the charity shop took the mug he had bought and put it in the window next to a crocheted blanket the color of old parsnips and a clock that had stopped at a reasonable time of day. He did not like to imagine them touching his parcel after he left, not because of fingerprints or suspicion, but because he didn\u2019t want to be rude where people had already given things away. He crossed the street with the new lightness of a job done in plain sight and felt a brief dangerous happiness at how easily the town let you place one object near another without complaint. He turned the corner and made a right when the note would have made him left just to remind himself he could, then corrected because disobedience for its own sake is a kind of posing. The abattoir\u2019s side street had the smell you do not forget even years after the knives are put away, not blood exactly but iron and a kind of fat that never left the pores of the bricks, and he had the decency to stop and give a moment to the animals because the animals had had no use for his decency when they were alive. He placed the jar and he placed the circle and he placed the nothing, and when he walked away he did it without looking back, because the only thing worse than being a man who checks his work is being a man who enjoys the checking.\n\nThe map in his pocket told him they were being moved around the rim of the thing that mattered, and he resented it because he was susceptible to politeness and thus susceptible to patterns that disguised themselves as courtesy. On Moor View Terrace a woman watering a rectangle of gravel with a hose because muscle memory makes you commit to the wrong tool even when the job has changed, looked up and saw his hands turned over and gave him the nod of someone who has had to talk themselves through something ridiculous to keep themselves steady. He did the co-op and the alley and the lamppost as instructed and discovered the definite pleasure in following a rule that did not belong to the law, which frightened him enough that he began, silently, to add his own rule above each: if he says left, assume somebody is waiting behind right; if he says laugh, let the sound hit your teeth before your throat; if he says don\u2019t be clever, find the clever and lead it somewhere else. Patel matched his pace and whistled tunelessly through her teeth because there are only so many silences you can stand before you need to find a sound that doesn\u2019t belong to the town. They stopped by the chain-link fence that was sagging under the weight of ivy and read a note that said: Remember the field is a field, not a library, and he wanted very much to put his fist through something gentle and then did not, which was a better trick anyway.\n\nHe had decided to stop leaving anything that smelt like sugar on his kitchen counters, which meant he had moved the problem and not solved it, which, to be fair, was a tactic that served a lot of people very well. He took the cinnamon the boy had recommended and laid a thin line under the skirting board and watched the first ant hesitate and turn in the way that made his chest ache with low, weird pride. He had no right to pride in this, but if men only took pride in what they had rights to, the rooms would be quieter and his life had taught him that silence is not always benevolent. He boiled eggs and surrounded the pan with a fortress of teaspoons he did not need, and ate them with good behavior, which was to say he scraped the plate clean because leaving any yellow behind meant you would see it again later in the bin and he wanted mercy from his own eyes. He sat and looked at the photograph he had promised himself not to look at and said the word hello three times in the way you say it when a box is opened and a thing inside it that you did not order looks up and turns out not to be harmful. He wrote and crossed out and wrote and crossed out and in the crossings he saw the old schoolboy who had learned early that you can practice sincerity until it is indistinguishable from the real thing. When he folded the letter and slid it into its cheap plastic skin he did not think of any man, and then he did, and then he laughed softly because being made of contradictions is only ugly if you uncross your arms about it.\n\nThe jar at the abattoir sat and did nothing and had an audience, which is one of the few honest positions for an object in a town. A caretaker from the warehouse next door came out for a smoke and looked at it and made a face that was almost prayer without committing to a god, and two girls in school skirts that had been hemmed without maternal permission photographed it sideways as if the angle would explain anything. Cassidy parked two streets away because the habit of arriving without a flag had been beaten into him by a decade and a half of people who lied best when you told them you were a policeman too early. He walked the long route around the back because he refused to oblige anything that wanted him to be a straight line, and when he saw the circle and the jar he had the sick relief of a prediction that had come true. He told Scenes to do what Scenes does and he stood back and stared at the brick where the fat had leached and thought, unwillingly, of hands, and then he did as he had been told and looked at them again. He did not like what he felt, which was something curiously close to prayer without a subject, and he put that away quickly because it would unman him if he let it sit. He recognized the pattern beginning to evolve from gesture into grammar and he did what he always did when men got fluent at their sins; he pulled other people in and made their voices lay over his like gauze.\n\nHe did not knock at her door that evening because he had the mercy to believe her when she had told him not to, and he lied by omission to himself about not standing on the pavement opposite for a full minute adjusting his scarf until she came to the window and did not see him. His mother rang and he let her, which counts for something, and he stood in the tiny back yard that the estate agent had once called a garden and listened to the sound the bricks made when the cold started to set properly. \u201cYou eat,\u201d she said, without preamble and with love so naked it would have been obscene if it hadn\u2019t been so long-standing, and he told her about stew in a tone that was receipt not confession. She asked him a question about the book that sounded like a question about him, and he told her he would write in the morning and put as much truth into the sentence as it could hold, which was not very much but not nothing. When he went back inside he found the envelope under his door as if the town had practiced this move on other men and got the knack. The flap had been sealed with that cheap tape and his name had been written in a hand that knew exactly how hard you had to press to make ink look like insistence. He took it for granted that this was orchestrated and he loathed himself mildly for the thrill, which is as honest as he gets about these things.\n\nHe opened it with the carefulness he had developed in the years of not letting his curiosity damage his job, and found inside a thing that made the lines he had drawn on his map look like practice. It was not a letter in the way the other letters were letters; it was a timetable, with times that matched the rhythm of somebody\u2019s day who ate when the radio news spoke and walked when the town took its break and stopped when the school bell went twice quickly. There were small instructions that had the seduction of being practical\u2014bring a torch that won\u2019t mind rain; wear shoes that forgive mud; do not tell the boy on the desk your real smile\u2014and at the bottom a sentence he read twice because he wanted it to be written by somebody else. It said: We are not going to the field, not yet, we are going to its shadow, which is kinder and therefore worse. He folded the paper into his pocket and did not sit down because sitting would mean admitting that he was winding himself prettily to a man\u2019s tune, and he had not liked waltzes even at the wedding he had chosen not to drink at.\n\nHe had learned to walk between lamplight as a boy because his father had told him light is where you get counted, and he was very good at not being a number. He moved through the estate in a way that kept him one step ahead of easy descriptions and at each of the corners he had chosen to be a stage he set down a token that would be both a clue to one man and a kindness to nobody. At the precinct he put a circle of coins that added up to nothing under the bench where the old men played at not needing each other and sat until the cold turned his knees into instruments he did not read music for. At the underpass he chalked a laugh onto the wall and when a boy riding too fast asked him what it was he said \u201cA cloud,\u201d and the boy said \u201cLiar,\u201d with a bright friendliness he had not earned. At the garage he pressed his finger to the oil slick until it took his whorl and then wiped it on his jeans because you should never leave your pattern on something that belongs to a place like that. He liked the shape the evening was taking and this admission made him want to be punished, which was both an old hunger and a new one. When he got home he put the ant under the glass again because he had run out of saints to press between the pages of the book of his day and he needed the company of something small that obeyed.\n\nThe shadow of the field was not the alley that ran parallel to it or the old wall or the ditch that filled when the drains sulked; the shadow of the field was the people who did not say its name even in their heads. He knocked on a door he had known he would knock on since his second step that morning and the woman who opened it pressed her palms together because sometimes you pray not to God but to an incoming conversation. She was the one who had found the shoe that time and had not called it a shoe until a policeman told her it was, and she had kept her gaze on the laces the entire interview because looking at the leather would have made it true beyond the capacity of the body. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to say it,\u201d he told her now on her step with the expression he used for people who did not owe him anything, \u201cwe\u2019re going to measure it and then you can throw it away again,\u201d and she smiled with one side of her mouth because she had learned to regulate her kindness the way you regulate the oven when you have to bake and you know your cooker runs hot. She told him about the boys with their bottle rockets and the man with his drone and the woman who stood at the stile and did not climb it because standing was a climb that day, and he listened until he could lay her words on his map like a lace that made the paper feel less cheap. When he left she shut the door very gently and he loved her for not lending the day any more noise than it already got.\n\nNight put its hands on the town like a big brother who meant well and didn\u2019t know his own weight, and they set the van where the van goes when you are trying to be invisible and only manage to look like a van. The young ones took first watch because the young ones always do until their eyes learn to hurt, and Patel sat with them for an hour and told a story that had the common decency to be funny enough to be worth the third retelling. Cassidy walked the perimeter of a building he knew too well and tried to recognize the bits of himself that wanted to look good in a report and told them to go and take the night off. He thought, not for the first time, about a boy he had had in custody once who had cried because he had said I\u2019m sorry to the wrong person in the wrong tone and had not been forgiven, and he wondered if tone was the only thing between men and their worst selves. When the jar did not move and then did and then pretended it had not, he felt rather than saw the adjustment in his team, the shift of bodies that says somebody has written a line and we are going to try to read it out loud together without stammering. The hedge breathed and gave up nothing but a bird that would have been called a blackbird if anyone had carried that word in their pocket at that hour, and the cameras stared with their blank good nature at the path that no one would choose if they wanted to be seen.\n\nHe walked past his own door twice not because he was afraid of what would be behind it but because fear is an old game his body liked to play when the stakes were high. The envelope he had left on the table that morning had swaggered in his absence and made itself look important in a way letters will when they realize they are the only ones at home. He opened it and found inside a photocopy of a page from a book about laughter that he had once seen in a college library and not checked out because he had been busy building a self that didn\u2019t use citations. The margin had a note in a tidy hand: Laughter as anesthetic vs. laughter as incision, and he read the words aloud because hearing them made them stay. He did not sleep. He lay with the lights off and looked at the line where the ceiling met the wall and imagined his coordinates written up there and then, for no good reason, he burst out laughing in the tiniest laugh he had, a rabbit\u2019s laugh, and he put his fist over his mouth as if somebody could hear him in the next street. He was not forgiven. That was not the point.\n\nWhen the morning brought its mean little brightness to the edges of the window frame, the jar at the basin looked less like a trick and more like a decision, and that, he thought, was always going to be the danger: turning a man\u2019s ritual into an altar because you had looked at it too long. He met Patel at the van with tea that had been made too strong on purpose and told her about the timetable, and she blew on her cup and told him that people who invite you to be punctual at their madness always hope you will save them from themselves by being five minutes late. They plotted the day like a picnic no one would enjoy and he sent two rookies to hold the corner by the abattoir with orders to look like idiots and think like thieves. He reminded himself to call his mother and to use the tone that made her not worry until the tone wore off, which took exact minutes he could count. He checked the map and the dotted circle and the shadow, and he thought of a story he had been told once about a farmer who walked the perimeter of his field every morning and wore a track into the earth not because he liked the view but because he needed to know his fences were still his fences, and he wished to God the man they were following had the same smallness in him instead of this insistence on being understood.\n\nHe put on his coat and drew his breath in and moved, and the town did the thing towns do when you treat them like a page and write your name on them without asking, which is they hum a little through their bricks as if getting ready to forgive you after and then, if you\u2019re lucky, actually doing it. He walked until his knees reminded him he was not a young policeman anymore and walked after that because he was too stubborn to let his knees have the last line. He would admit it later in the part of his brain that wrote the book he wasn\u2019t writing, that he had been excited that day, and he would make it clean on paper so he could close the page and live, and he would hope no one he loved saw him do it. He had the shape of a circle and the shadow of the field and the twist of a mind like a wire in his pocket, and he had the laugh he was keeping in his throat because he was saving it for the right place. He told himself that right places exist on some days, even for men who use the wrong voice at the wrong time, and the lie was so good he nearly believed it long enough to be comforted. He did not look up. He did not look down. He put each foot in front of the other and trusted that if he fell, he would fall in a pattern he could live with.\n\nBruce had dreamed of a sink once years ago, and the sink had been as large as his mother\u2019s kitchen, and his father had been in it, a small figure trying to climb the side as the sugar water rose, and he had woken himself with a laugh and had not told anyone because it was not the kind of thing that wins you a nickname you can live under. He did not dream now. He sat awake and examined the air for the sound it made before he laughed and thought, not for the first time, that if he could meet the man with the white-down-the-middle hair he would ask him not about the field but about the way he managed to keep a job and a face on at the same time. He practiced saying I\u2019m sorry to an empty room and admired how well he did it as a piece of theatre and loathed himself as soon as the admiration crept in as if a mouse had made a nest in the lining of his coat. He stood and did the boots and the lace twice and then the extra loop that made him feel looked after by his own hands, and he went out into a morning the color of cigarette paper. He had a pocketful of things that meant nothing to ordinary eyes and too much to his own, and he had a schedule he intended to keep with the zeal of a convert who knows he is late to the religion. He smiled into a window that gave him back a man he had never intended to get to know and kept walking, and if the field rose to his right he did not look, and if the town breathed behind him he did not flinch, and if the day put its thumb on his throat he laughed and swallowed and went on, good boy.Cassidy followed the timetable like a man testing the temperature of water with the back of his hand. It had the steady politeness of bus times but without the anchoring comfort of a destination printed in fat letters on the front. Patel drove because she had the better patience for junctions, and when they stopped she made a note on a card rather than on the map to keep the act of writing from feeling like prophecy. They started at the bowling green that was no longer green but an ankle-twisting scab of hard mud where men still came to suck at cigarettes and complain about the council as if the council lived under their nails. A small paper bag had been tucked neatly under the lip of the old scoreboard and inside there was nothing more than a twist of thread and a fleck of white that might have been sugar or salt or flaked paint. \u201cHe\u2019s underfeeding us today,\u201d Patel said, and he agreed, because it was a day for small measures and the taste of denial was in the air like damp.\n\nThe woman in the red coat was on the far side of the fence and he recognized her not by the coat, which could be anyone\u2019s story, but by the way she arranged her hands as if asking them to behave. She was looking at the bowling shed, not at him, but when he turned to see if she would register him she smiled with enough restraint to signal that she was playing fair, and he found himself smiling back with an equally rationed honesty. \u201cYou\u2019ll make us famous,\u201d she said with no accusation in it, just the weary amusement of someone who had learned fame meant cameras where you buy your bread. He thought about telling her that fame came to towns at a cost they didn\u2019t get to set and then he didn\u2019t say it because he had promised himself to stop making speeches to strangers. \u201cWe\u2019re trying not to,\u201d he said instead, and she nodded, as if that was the answer she had hoped for, and turned away with a neatness that made him like her more.\n\nThey went from the green to the cut-through behind the parade of shops where last night\u2019s takeaway had oiled the pavement into treachery. A chalk arrow had been drawn at ankle height where anyone over ten would miss it, and the chalk had already taken on the grey fuzz of the day. It pointed not to the warren of garages where boys broke bikes into pieces and called it learning, but to the narrow wedge of grass between wall and kerb that had acquired the dignity of having been mown; in the middle of the wedge sat a jam jar with nothing in it but a single bubble, trapped like a thought too small to admit. Lorna arrived with her box before he could talk himself into reverence for the bubble. She crouched with a practical grunt and said something soft to the jar like a nurse coaxing a child to show a bruise, and he felt grateful for the way her attention unmagicked objects without disrespecting them. \u201cYou\u2019ll forgive me when I say this is beginning to be boring,\u201d she murmured, and he gave her the kind of look that meant he was counting on her to be bored enough to see what he had missed.\n\nAt the corner shop on Hathersage Road they bought tape without buying tape, which was to say Patel stood and listened to the owner tell them about the weather for four straight minutes and then, with the casual genius of a woman who had once survived two aunts and a church committee, slid a question under his story like a hand into a pocket. He told them about the man with the laugh that had been too loud for half-eight and the way he had held the banknotes by the very edges as if they were wet. \u201cHe had a cut on his hand,\u201d the owner said, gesturing to the soft part of his own palm, \u201ca little crescent, like he\u2019d argued with a tin and lost, and he said sorry before I\u2019d even looked to see if he\u2019d dropped anything.\u201d Cassidy thanked him and did not try to make the memory do more work than it wanted to. On the step of the shop a boy with a nose that had just decided to grow into his face was drawing an ant with a marker pen on the pavement, fat head, stick legs, a grin that was an accident. \u201cThey bite,\u201d the boy informed him, and then added, very seriously, \u201conly if you stand on their house,\u201d and he said, \u201cFair,\u201d and thought of circles and jars until his chest hurt.\n\nThe map sent them to the library, which gave him the kind of home-sadness he only ever admitted to when he smelled floor polish and old paper living together. The woman at the desk had a cardigan the color of rain clouds and a way of taking a breath that asked you to make your question worth the oxygen, and he showed her his warrant card not because he needed to but because he liked the way her mouth softened when she saw it. The book with the underlining about edible plants sat on a trolley as if it had refused to be reshelved; inside, where yesterday\u2019s hand had circled a picture of chickweed with scholar\u2019s fervor, a folded square of paper had been placed like a translation. It was a photocopy of a map section with nothing marked on it at all, but as he stared he realized the absence was the point; the field, a blank the color of the paper behind the ink, had been left unprinted by a machine that should have filled it, and he felt a silly little thrill at the idea that machines also knew how to let a space be a space. Patel tapped the margin where someone, in that fussy neat hand, had written: Resist filling.\n\nHe had to go to the station to do the thing he hated, which was to stand in front of cameras and say words about public safety that made sense and didn\u2019t give away the parts of a story that would sink the tale before it got legs. The internet had done its usual quick dirty job of naming the shape of the man he was being asked to read, and he needed to say he didn\u2019t like the names without looking like an old bloke scolding children. Patel stood next to him like a quiet metronome and he felt himself speaking to her instead of to the microphones, which was one of his better tricks when he remembered it. He said they were aware of the placements and that nobody had been harmed and that the objects were being handled appropriately and he did not say ants because he had worked out the word itself did a stupid thing to faces. A reporter with hair so glossy it could have been sent to a lab asked him whether he thought the perpetrator was trying to \u201ccommunicate a trauma,\u201d and he stood still instead of saying what he wanted to, which was, show me a person who isn\u2019t.\n\nHe pushed the timetable around the afternoon like peas on a plate and found himself late to a small appointment he had not admitted even to Patel. The woman in the house the color of bread opened before his knuckles could steal a second knock, and this time he did not perform his hands; he kept them at his sides like a pupil remembering himself. \u201cYou again,\u201d she said, with the little rise at the end that let him put his own tone in the gap. He told her about the timetable and the map that resisted being filled and the boy\u2019s ant and she listened the way she had always listened, even when she had told him she was done, and when he stopped she nodded as if to say not bad, and he had to fight down the appalling urge to ask if he was doing well. \u201cHe came here once,\u201d she said, and he did not ask who because they were done pretending there were multiple he\u2019s in this conversation, \u201cand he laughed in the corridor because he thought the echo was kind. I think he has always wanted sound to be kind. Kindness is not its job.\u201d He wanted to say I know, and he wanted to say I don\u2019t, and in the end he kissed the air between them with a thank you he did not speak.\n\nBruce had been to the corner shop and bought the cheap tape because he liked the thing it did to the skin of his hands, the way it pulled at him just enough to remind him of his edges without taking anything. He had left a coin on the counter that was slightly too big for the amount and had waited to be told off as if he were a boy seeking proof of borders, and when none came he laughed in a way that tried to be an apology. Back at the table the jars had taken on the serious aspect of instruments in an orchestra pit; he liked them in ranks though he distrusted what that said about him. He had tried the cinnamon, twice, and watched with an odd ache as the ants turned away with obedience that looked like grief if you squinted, and he had a moment of furious tenderness for a child he had never made. He left the cinnamon in a line on the doorstep as if it could keep the world out of his house while letting the air in, and when he stepped over it he did it with the respect of a man who had invented something he wished he\u2019d been taught.\n\nHe went to see Joel because he had decided it would count as penance, and because Joel had once been his friend at a time when friends are chosen for you by geography and a shortage of chairs. Joel ran a unit that fixed phones and sold glass screens you could satisfyingly peel a film off, and when Bruce stepped in he felt the judder in his chest he associated with nostalgia and guilt, which were cousins in his body. \u201cWell,\u201d Joel said, putting his palms on the counter like a man who had sworn to always touch wood before saying something that might break, \u201clook who still walks like he expects the place to tip.\u201d Bruce laughed softly because saying you\u2019re not wrong would have been crueler; he asked after Joel\u2019s wife and Joel used her maiden name like he always had, and in the gap Bruce felt as if someone had lifted a lid off his head and checked the contents. \u201cYou hear from her?\u201d Joel asked, a question tossed with the casual malice of old intimacy, and Bruce said he brought a photograph back and watched Joel\u2019s mouth do the small leap that meant he would not tease after all. \u201cYou doing your weird thing still?\u201d Joel said in a voice that tried to laugh before Bruce did, and for the first time in a long while Bruce did not rise to the stage. \u201cTrying not to,\u201d he said, and they both let that sit between the phone cases and the lanyards and the memory of the field without naming any of it.\n\nLorna\u2019s list of tape sellers narrowed things in that way that frustrates and comforts at once, because a narrower circle is still a circle until it isn\u2019t. They went to the second on the page because the first had already given them the laugh story and one story a morning was his measure. The man at the counter in the second had the consuming kind of beard that attempted to make a personality and he spoke like he believed he was himself a cautionary tale. Patel used a new tone, all praise and no threat, and he brought out a sheaf of receipts because men who stock things love an audience for their stockrooms even when the stock is stickers and string. They found a sale at nine-thirty the morning of the first jar, cash, a roll of tape, a packet of napkins printed with small leaves that Bruce would never have bought if anyone were watching, and golden syrup. \u201cHe asked if we had honey and when I said no he said, \u2018Not that sort of sweetness then,\u2019\u201d the man reported, his eyes satisfied at having been helpful, and Cassidy nodded and hoped the sentence would behave when he repeated it later to his own head.\n\nThe town had started to perform being watched, which meant people enacted their own decent version of themselves on corners and handed it to him, which was generous and odd and made him tired. A lad on a scooter slowed conspicuously when he saw tape and then sped up like he had only just remembered being a teenager; a man in a van put his arm out the window and waved at nobody because waving is contagious; a woman pushed a pram with one hand and held a phone to her ear with the other and said \u201cYeah, the ant thing,\u201d in a voice that could have been incredulous or hungry. He wished for the comfort of a fight and then caught himself wishing it and felt ashamed, because men like him are given too many fights for free. Patel watched a gull bully a smaller gull off a bin with the clean attention of a person who refuses to attribute morals to birds, and he thought, not for the first time, that she saved him from writing sins into everything.\n\nAt three they followed the timetable to the undercroft of the old college where the theatre students had once painted the walls black and learned to smoke in elegant arcs. There was a circle there\u2014of course there was\u2014made with flour this time, poor man\u2019s chalk, and the gusts had softened it into an edible fog. In the middle, a jar had its lid screwed tight for the first time and in it there hung a fishing float, red and white, not submerged because there was no water, just a trinket suspended as if in a bad dream version of buoyancy. A note on the underside of the lid, written with that insistent tidy hand, said: One of us had to learn the wrong tool. He felt the old itch to take offence at the pronoun and then breathed it out, because he had been a person\u2019s \u201cus\u201d when it had not been his to wear, and he would rather sit in that embarrassment than pretend none of this was touching him.\n\nHe brought the jar back very carefully and asked Lorna to see whether the glue residue on the lid was the same as the rest and she said she would and told him, by way of payment for making her do repetition, the story of her first boyfriend who had insisted they\u2019d never need more than three knives in a kitchen and how she had left him in the aisle of a shop because she had watched a woman come in to buy seven. He laughed, properly and entirely his own, and the relief of it made his eyes water, which made Patel pass him a tissue like a mother at a school play without remark. He made tea he knew nobody would love because he liked to practice being mediocre in private, and he took his mug to the little window that looked onto a wall and made himself look anyway as if the wall might unexpectedly offer a view. When the front desk called up to say there was a package addressed to him he did not sigh, which was the best he could manage.\n\nThe package was an ant farm of the cheap sort that made parents sigh even as they handed over the notes at Christmas. The plastic had been scoured clean and the sand had been dyed a disreputable blue that made him think of those drinks kids carry on buses. The colony inside it was real and moderately healthy and had a small smear of syrup pressed against one of the corners, and he felt his stomach turn at the thought of someone shepherding these in and out of a post office. There was a sticker on the back with a smiley face on it, the kind schools put on homework when the work had been close but not quite, and under it a note that read: Do not call this cruelty out loud, because that would be a lie, but do not call it mercy either. He put the box down and looked at Patel and she looked back and they did not talk for the length of time it takes a kettle to think about boiling. He carried the farm to Lorna with hands that he kept steady because he had done this before with other boxes and he wanted to give the ants the courtesy of a calm that had been denied to bigger suffering.\n\nIn the evening his mother fed him on a shoulder of pork that had been cooked so slowly he could have cried, and he did not tell her about jars or fields or maps but he told her a story about a gull that had bullied another gull and she told him she had always preferred pigeons because they seemed to be doing their best. He washed up and she dried like they had when his father had still been a door at the end of the hall and not a missing word at the end of a sentence, and he was almost happy because there are moments in most days where the body does you the kindness of forgetting you have another job. The envelope under his door when he got home was less of a surprise for having been inevitable, and he sat on the bottom step with his coat still on and opened it because he wanted, perversely, to do something thoughtless and make it good by the thought that followed. Inside was a polaroid of the jar at the basin under the sky, the rim of it furred with frost, and over the picture someone had written: Some of us are trying to be good. He stood and stood until his knees complained and then he folded the picture and put it into his wallet behind his warrant card and he told himself he would not interpret that act in any way at all.\n\nBruce had walked the shadow so long that day he felt he had worn his name into it, which would have made him ashamed if names were not the things he distrusted most after forgiveness. He had gone to the underpass and rubbed out his chalk cloud and drawn a different one and watched a girl with a pram nod at him like an adult nodding at a child pretending to be a shopkeeper, and the tenderness of it had nearly knocked him off his feet. He took the timetable he had made and scored through two times because he had let himself miss them, which meant he could punish himself with the neatness of the line and not the content of the day, and he laughed softly at his own thrift. At the abattoir he stood and said hello out loud to the bacteria because something in him insisted on manners where there had been none, and at the basin he stood with his hands behind his back like a schoolboy and did not move until he had had the thought he had come for. It was not a noble thought. It was this: if you teach a man to walk in circles, he will call it a pilgrimage if it keeps him from falling down.\n\nThe woman in the red coat came to the station again not because she had anything to add but because looking at the board of notices made her think of order and order had always been her hobby. She had the face of someone who could tell you how to sew a hem and where to stand in a church to avoid being photographed in the wrong light and she stared at the actors\u2019 call for extras for a panto as if it were an answer to a question she hadn\u2019t wanted to ask. The boy on the desk, the one with the inner calm that had made Cassidy briefly hopeful for the future of uniforms, offered her a chair and she thanked him and did not sit. When she left he wrote down her registration as if registering things made them safer and then rubbed it out because you should not write down the movements of people who are only trying to keep their heads above water by reading small words pinned to cork. He did not mention it to Cassidy, which was wise because Cassidy already carried too many harmless facts like pebbles in his pocket for luck.\n\nBy the time the dark had fully fallen, the jar under the abattoir\u2019s tilt had been replaced with another of the same width and shape and nothing inside at all, and Lorna swore because emptiness is harder to test than anything. \u201cHe\u2019s testing whether we\u2019re testing,\u201d she said, which sounded like a riddle that had lost its nerve, and Patel nodded and wrote a line on her card that consisted of an arrow and a circle and then a little square, which he knew meant stop trying to be a poet and get some sleep. He went home, because even men who are trying their best at being relentless go home at some point, and he put his coat over the back of a chair and it slid to the floor in a way that made him feel suddenly tired of objects that refused to hold on. He sat and meant to write one sentence that would at least be the first brick in the wall of the chapter he had promised and he wrote instead the name of a girl he had said he would not write and then he deleted it because he did not own any part of her and because naming is a violence when you are not sure of your right to the name.\n\nHe slept badly and woke early and would have made himself a list of the day if lists hadn\u2019t begun to feel like a man\u2019s idea of control rather than control itself. He checked his phone and ignored the paper that had wanted to put his picture next to a jar as if the pairing were a romance, and he ignored the message from the publisher that had learned how to be gently urgent, and he walked the map in his head one more time to make sure he could still buy milk without walking into a moment. At the basin the frost had lifted its fingers and the jar looked naked and ordinary, and for a second he felt such a mad, disloyal urge to kiss the glass for having behaved itself that he put both hands in his pockets and looked up at the sky and counted to twelve. Patel came up beside him without making the sound that boots usually make and stood and then left again because there are days when companionship is a kind of silence you take in shifts.\n\nOn the far side of the town, in a kitchen where the ants had learned the cinnamon line without being taught, Bruce boiled eggs and ate the yolks deliberately, which for him felt like the kind of heroism that goes unrewarded for obvious reasons. He stood at the sink and put his finger into the rim and then took it out and laughed very, very quietly at himself because there was nothing in the rim to find and not finding something had never stopped him pretending. The photograph lay on the table under a glass, not to protect it but to dignify it, and he lifted the glass and put it down again like a man practicing a trick he would never perform in front of anybody. He put on his boots and laced them and laced them again and then did not do the extra loop, and this, he told himself, was proof of nothing except that superstition can be moved and will move back if you let it. He touched the place on his thigh where the melted chocolate had made a dark petal the day before and found nothing but clean denim, and he felt a careful, ridiculous gladness at the smallness of that.\n\nHe stepped out into a town that had learned, over a week, the precise angle it liked to hold its head at when being watched, and he wondered whether it would ever put its head back the way it had been. The boy with the chocolates waved without the chocolates and said the cinnamon had worked for his mum and he took the gift with the gravity of a benediction. He passed the field without looking. He put his tongue against his teeth to hold in the first laugh of the day and managed to turn it into air that went out of his nose in what might in other men have been a sigh. He had the jar and the farmed ants and the thread and the float and the schedule and the shadow of a place where the ground had once made him into an echo, and he told himself that if he kept the route and the rules he could cross something like a river without getting wet at all. It was a childish lie and it lasted just long enough to get him to the first corner, which was all he had asked of it, and he was honest enough, with himself, to call that a victory of sorts, even if it tasted like syrup thinned so it would go further.Chapter 8\n\nCassidy woke into a morning that had trimmed everything down to its outlines, the kind of thin light that makes a town look drawn rather than built. He lay for a while in the bed that had learned the shape of his restlessness and watched the pale rectangle of the blind adjust degree by degree as if someone were lifting it with careful fingers. The timetable from the night before lay open on the chair where his trousers should have been, and he read it across the room as if distance would reduce its claim on him. He told himself he would not let today be choreographed, then admitted that the admission was itself a step, and smiled at his own defeat with the kind of gentleness he reserved for his younger, stupider selves. In the kitchen his mother had left bread out under a tea towel and the smell of it tugged on the part of him that was always a boy in a house that hugged back, so he ate two slices standing up and let the butter do its moral work.\n\nWhen he got to the station Patel had already been through the overnight reports and triaged them into piles that looked identical to anyone who did not know her system. She slid the smallest pile towards him and held it in place with the flat of her hand, and he felt absurdly grateful for the weight. \u201cNo jars moved,\u201d she said, and he nodded because the sentence contained both relief and promise. \u201cOne prank in Newbold, a plastic takeaway tub with \u2018Feed Me\u2019 written on it in eyeliner. The kid\u2019s mum brought him in and told him off in front of us, which was the nicest thing I\u2019ve watched all week.\u201d He laughed, and the laugh lifted something in him that had nothing to do with jars or notes. On the whiteboard in the briefing room he drew a circle without thinking and then rubbed it away because he refused to become the man who represented other men\u2019s obsessions without charging them rent.\n\nThey had Lorna for half the morning before the arson in Hasland yanked her away, and in that time she did what she did best, which was to turn shabby material into information without ever pretending at magic. She had taken apart the ant farm with a delicacy that would have made her a good burglar, and she showed him the burr on the edge of the plastic where someone had pried at it with a butter knife. \u201cHe\u2019s careful until he\u2019s bored,\u201d she said, tapping a fingernail against the seam and setting up a small, satisfying clatter. \u201cThe float? Sold at one of three tackle shops in a ten-mile radius. The thread is cheap cotton, the kind that pills if you think about it.\u201d She laid a strip of tape under the lamp so that the bubbles in it stood out like small, captured planets and raised an eyebrow. \u201cCorner shop glue, like we thought. I\u2019ll say this and then you can ignore it when it suits you: his materials are all made for kitchens and primary schools. If he escalates, it won\u2019t be because he found a new aisle.\u201d\n\nThe tackle shop on Chatsworth Road smelled exactly as it should, a respectable defeat of damp and feathers and oil, and he loved it on sight. The man behind the counter had the glazed cheerfulness of someone who had learned to enjoy repetitive explanations, and when Cassidy showed his card the man did not stop smiling, he simply tuned it to a frequency that said he would be helpful as a default rather than from fear. \u201cFloats like that? Bought two, week before last. He didn\u2019t know what he wanted, which is normal, but he asked questions like he was trying to guess the answers I wanted to give,\u201d the man said, and he demonstrated how a person who has spent a lifetime untangling line does not make a theatrical knot. \u201cPaid cash. Laughed when I told him we sell bait, said \u2018No more mouths in the house,\u2019 then laughed again. He had a neat way with his change, which is rare.\u201d Patel was already leaning to see the screen when he offered to check the cameras, and the angles, predictably, were a hymn to the ceiling, but one showed a pair of hands taking the goods and standing a moment too long at the card tree. Cassidy looked at the video twice, then looked away to let the information stack itself somewhere useful, and he thanked the man with a sincerity that he hoped would feel like payment.\n\nBruce had slept an hour at a time, little dozes that cracked off him like flaking paint, and when he swung his legs out of bed he discovered a gratitude he didn\u2019t trust. The line of cinnamon had held at the skirting and he found a tiny community of ants exploring its edge with what he interpreted as politeness. He stood for a time and did nothing, a practice he had found harder than any of his tricks, and when his body tried to laugh he put the feeling into a cough and felt immediately ridiculous, so he allowed himself a softer sound, a breath with a shape, and called that his medal for the morning. He boiled eggs and ate both yolks as if they were pills prescribed by a doctor he had decided to obey, and when the second stuck in his throat he swallowed around it with a discipline that made him proud in the unlovely way effort makes you. The photograph lay under its glass and he did not touch it, which felt like a kind of fidelity nobody would reward him for, and he left the house with his hands empty and his mouth behaving.\n\nHe went to the church because he had put it on his list of places he had never liked and decided to take things in order. The spire was still wrong in a way that made the whole of him itch, though he admired its refusal to be straight as if it were a man kind enough to make his weakness charming. Inside, a guide gave him a piece of laminated paper with facts on it and a smile that asked him not to run, and he walked the aisle with a seriousness he was trying on for size. He did not like the way his footsteps became other people\u2019s footsteps, and he did not like the smear of wax on the floor where a candle had gone soft in a draught, and he stood for longer than he needed to in front of a stone woman whose face had been rubbed soft by fingers and made himself think of nothing at all. He put a pound in the wooden box because he understood the economy of faith even if he had never been good at the practice, and he left with the peculiar feeling that the building had regarded him and found him too noisy even at his quietest.\n\nCassidy and Patel took the long way to the crooked spire because the map had started to make his feet go where it wanted without asking, and he would not give up small freedoms without charging them. In the square a woman in a high-vis jacket was instructing a line of children on how to be visible in the world, and the sight made him feel obscurely tender and then obscurely sad. He bought a cheap notebook at the newsagent because his pocket had begun to look surly with folded A4 and he wrote three phrases he did not want to forget: resist filling; wrong tool; not yet. Patel watched the page tilt in his hand as if words might leak off the edge, and when he looked up she was already looking away in that deliberate privacy she afforded people when they were doing small, vulnerable things. They stood under the spire and let their necks ache, and he tried, for the space of a minute, to imagine a structural flaw as a kind of public permission to be crooked, then put the thought away because he was not interested in being that indulgent today.\n\nThe woman in the red coat was back at the station before lunch, and this time she brought a jar wrapped in a tea towel like a child. She did not ask for Cassidy by name because she did not have to, and the boy at the desk made the right shape with his face when he saw what she had. \u201cIt was on my step,\u201d she said, and she put the jar down with the care of someone placing a hot dish on a table they do not own. Inside was a ring of water no higher than a fingernail and a scrap of paper pressed to the glass by static, and when he peeled it up with a gloved nail the words were neat and small and infuriatingly polite. Not in the house, it said, and then below it, in parentheses, please. He felt his mouth make a shape that would look like anger to someone across the room and tried to correct it, and the woman watched him with a softness that stopped short of pity. \u201cI know who it is,\u201d she said, and he took the sentence not as an admission but as a burden she had let him see.\n\nThey went to hers together, because there are moments when the containment of the station is a cruelty and you must show yourself in a room that knows a different truth about you. She made tea with the competence of a person who had been taught that hospitality is a muscle you must exercise even when the body is unfit, and he followed her into a kitchen that was a testimony to a woman continually preventing things. The cinnamon line under her back door made his throat hurt with its humble earnestness, and he did not say anything about it because praise would be an insult. She told him what he already knew in bones and did not know in words, a careful braid of memories tied at the top with the sentence I don\u2019t want him punished so much as stopped. He said that stopping did not always arrive without punishment attached, and she looked at him with the brilliant fury of a decent person who has been taught to be reasonable and would like her allowance increased. He left with the jar, empty now, and a sense that his job had to include the invention of softer endings even if the world was not built to hold them.\n\nBruce walked to the tackle shop again because he had liked the smell and because he did not like doing anything only once when he could ruin it with repetition. He stood at the rack of floats and pretended to make a decision he had already made, and when the man behind the counter asked if he wanted help he said no with gratitude that surprised them both. He bought thread he did not need and asked a stupid question about the weight of a thing so slight he barely felt it in his palm, and when the man laughed he laughed too, but he kept the sound below the counter as if a child were sleeping bound for the first time in months. Outside he leaned against the bus stop and watched a woman put coins in one of those charity collections that are designed to make you feel watched, and he envied the ease of her decision. He threw his receipt in the bin and took it out again and folded it into a small square and put it in his pocket like a man saving his own alibi.\n\nThe abattoir held nothing in the afternoon but a smell that had decided to live there whether anyone liked it or not, and he stood at the corner of the loading bay and scanned the neat square of shadow underneath for signs of his own mischief. The jar he had put there had gone, which made him feel bereaved in a way he did not think was allowable, and he was ashamed and then he was not, because shame had begun to feel like vanity. He took a napkin with leaves printed on it from his pocket and put it under a flake of ragged paint as if he were teaching the wall to read, and he walked away with his hands in plain view, which made him feel both chastened and proud. Someone had chalked a hopscotch grid into the road and he avoided it with the superstition of a man who does not want to step into a game he hasn\u2019t been invited to, then deliberately stepped into the last square because he wanted to feel, for half a second, like an eleven-year-old boy who could command a stone.\n\nIn the cupboard that pretended to be a canteen the kettle performed its slow anger and Patel read her messages with a stillness he envied. \u201cThe woman in the red coat?\u201d she said at last, and he nodded because they had agreed not to name her even between themselves. \u201cShe knows him,\u201d Patel said, and he said, \u201cShe knew him,\u201d because tense was a hill he would die on if it meant he could keep the past from dragging too much mud into the room. Patel slid him a biscuit because he had forgotten to bring his own, and he looked at it the way a child looks at a coin they have not earned. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to follow his timetable the next two days,\u201d she said without apology. \u201cThen we stop doing that at all and make our own, because otherwise we become applause.\u201d He agreed, not just because she was right but because the phrase gave him a smug little pleasure he would not voice for fear it ruined the sentence.\n\nIn the mid-afternoon lull when the day pretends to be shorter than it is, a small boy was brought into the station because he had taken a jar off a wall near the college and had decided it was treasure. He had the serene courage of a person whose mother had told him plainly that the world belonged to nobody and to everybody, and he held the jar in both hands like it contained a heat that did not burn. The note in it, folded once and then once again, had a single word on it in that same tidy insistence: Listen. Cassidy did, because he had grown used to being told to do simple things and finding himself crying halfway through, and he balanced the jar to his ear like a sea shell and felt the foolishness hit and pass, and then he realized the foolishness was his, not the object\u2019s. The jar had been left upright with a cheap dictaphone under it, the kind that clicks with an old-fashioned hunger, and when Lorna pressed play the room filled with the sound of a laugh that had learned how to be alone.\n\nHe carried the sound up the corridor as if it had weight and played it in the briefing room and let it bounce off the cheap vinyl chairs because he did not trust himself to hold it any closer. It was not cruel, which somehow made it worse; a bent laughter, an attempt at kindness executed by the wrong muscles, a body\u2019s attempt to screw a lid onto an emotion that had no jar to fit it. He watched Patel\u2019s face go through three precise changes: skepticism, concern, and then the most private look of all, the one she used when she found herself unexpectedly forgiving someone who had not asked. He stopped the recording and the silence afterward felt like the aftertaste of metal. \u201cHe\u2019s giving us himself at last,\u201d he said, and Patel shook her head, not to contradict him but to warn him that belief has its own gravity.\n\nJoel closed the shop early because his daughter had her school concert and because he had become a person who refused to miss that sort of thing even when money barked at him from the till. Bruce stood in the doorway after he had flipped the sign and said, without a proper hello, \u201cI think I\u2019m going to stop,\u201d and Joel looked at him with the tired care of a man who had loved someone in the wrong decade and not died of it. \u201cStop what,\u201d he said, because he would not give him the grace of speaking for him, and Bruce looked at his own hands, which had begun to interest him in a way he had not expected. \u201cStop laughing when I don\u2019t mean it,\u201d he said, and Joel leaned on the counter with both elbows and considered this terribly reasonable ambition. \u201cI hope you do,\u201d he said, and then because he could not help himself, he added, \u201cI hope you can.\u201d\n\nBy evening Cassidy had allowed himself to believe they were keeping pace, which is always when a case decides to quicken. A new circle appeared at the top of a flight of disused steps where the rail line had once thought about becoming a path, and inside it, instead of a jar, was a saucer, the kind your grandmother keeps even when the cup dies, and in the saucer a small dark moth lay with its wings together in the posture of an idea being given up. There was no note, only a dusting of cinnamon on the rim that looked exactly like an attempt to be kind to the invisible. Lorna stood with her hands on her hips and said nothing because sometimes objects deserve an unargument, and Patel took a breath and let it out slowly, and he thought, wildly and without evidence, that the cinnamon was a concession to the boy\u2019s mother and he loved and hated the man for it at the same time. He took the saucer as if removing a crown from a head and left the circle untroubled because it had the dignity of a thing that was trying not to do harm.\n\nHe stood again at his mother\u2019s sink that night and washed a plate he had not dirtied, that old trick of turning penances into tasks, and she watched him with her chin on her hand with a tenderness that sat plainly on her face like jewellery worn for a reason. \u201cYou look like your father when you\u2019re listening to yourself,\u201d she said, and he did not know what to do with the sentence, so he put the plate on the rack at a neat angle and dried his hands. She asked him if the boy on his desk was doing well and he said yes because the boy was, and she asked if he had written anything, and he said no because he still could not bear to describe what he was doing without adding sugar. She kissed the side of his head when he bent and told him to bring Patel round for tea any time she liked, and he made the right noise of assent and left with his pockets feeling indecently heavy.\n\nThe envelope under his door that evening had been folded with too much attention, the kind of care that makes an object look guilty, and he put it on the table and walked around it twice because he refused to look greedy. When he opened it he found three pieces of paper: a photocopy of a map that had been darkened until the field was nothing but a soft square, a photograph of a jam jar filled to the brim and reflecting only sky, and a note that said, in that reasonable child\u2019s hand, Some of us are trying to stop. He sat down because his knees had decided to give him up, and he stared at the words until they blurred, and then he laughed once, quietly, because his body had to do something and crying was not available. He put the note into the notebook with resist filling and wrong tool and not yet and felt that ridiculous, invincible human feeling that lists, if righteous enough, can change a life.\n\nBruce did not eat an ant that night. He trapped one under his glass and he watched it for the full length of a song on the radio that a happy person would have recognized and he let it go, and he did not make a performance of that mercy even to himself. He put sugar on the back step and then swept it off and then put it back on again and laughed in exasperation at his own indecision and then stopped because the laugh had caught on a metal edge somewhere in him. He wrote a note that he did not deliver and read it aloud in the voice he used in his head when he tried to be good, a bright, careful thing that embarrassed him as soon as it left his mouth. He stood at the sink and put his finger in the rim and then took it out and wiped it on his jeans and stood some more and was astonished at his own capacity for stillness. When he slept he did not, and in the morning he called it sleep because he had to give the night a name.\n\nAt nine the next morning a man in a delivery uniform put a box on the station desk and signed for it himself with a smile because he understood the pleasures of a good forgery. Inside was nothing theatrical, which frightened Cassidy more than it should have. There was a bag of cheap cinnamon, a roll of tape that had already lost its battle with its own adhesive, and a single lid from a supermarket milk bottle with a neat square of clingfilm stretched across it and secured with an elastic band. There was no ant, only the suggestion of a place where an ant could go and be cared for and then be let out again if someone remembered. The note said: Some lines I will not cross, and he looked at the line of powder and the lid and the shamed, slack tape and felt his own throat do a small, unlovely thing. Patel swore softly under her breath in a language he did not understand and then translated the swear into a breath that made him want to be better at his job.\n\nThey did the timetable until its edge, and on the edge there was the field. Not the field itself, which remained heavy in the way fields are when they do not have an audience, but the alley that refuses to call itself a path and the scratch of fence that had learned to sag where people step. At the mouth of that cut-through there was a circle that had been made without cruelty, a dusting of cinnamon as if someone had made a cake on the ground and decided at the last second not to bake it, and in the very middle, nothing at all. He stood looking at the emptiness and felt, not relief, but a complicated grief that had the shape of a man who had promised to stop and not quite managed it. He did not step into the circle because he liked the line better than the gesture, and he did not speak because there is a kind of quiet you do not interrupt with theory. Patel shifted beside him and not touching him managed to lay her steadiness alongside his.\n\nThe woman in the red coat cut across the bottom of the road then and gave them a look that said she knew where they were and was braced for it. She did not stop and they did not call to her because it would have turned the moment into something small and they were both trying not to be cheap with their courage. Behind them, in the ordinary street where people had their bins lined up for collection with the precise pride of men who polish their shoes on Sundays, a boy laughed too loudly for the joke he\u2019d been told and then looked around to see if anyone wanted to correct him. Cassidy closed his eyes and put a hand on the fence as if he were steadying someone else, and when he opened them he had decided one thing, which was that people who try to stop are entitled to an audience that does not boo.\n\nHe went home early by his standards, which meant before midnight, and he cooked something badly and ate it with care and put his plate in the sink with an awkward gratitude that surprised him. He took out his notebook and wrote down, not the case, but the way Patel had stood beside him without leaning, and the way Lorna had not laughed at the moth, and the way the cinnamon line had looked absurd and holy at once. He wrote the sentence He is trying to be good and trying not to be bad and failing in both directions, and then he crossed it out because he had taken enough from the man without taking the right to sentence him in his own drawer. He turned off the lamp and lay in the dark and laughed once, on purpose, and then he said sorry like a man saying grace and felt a bit of the day release him without letting him go.\n\nBruce woke without the usual startle because he had nothing new to be afraid of and found that to be the strangest sensation of all. He made tea with water that had not quite boiled because he did not want to be scalded by anything, even comfort, and he drank it standing up because the chair would have felt like a claim. He went to the table and put his finger on the edge of the glass over the photograph and then took it away and then put it back and then took it away, because repetition remained the only way he knew to make respect look like habit. He put on his boots and tied the laces twice and then, because he had promised himself he could, he undid the second knot and left it at one. When he stepped out of the door he did not look at the field, but he let the town look at him, and he thought, as the day put its cheap miracle of light on the brick of his street, that there are mornings you can forgive yourself for being a man who is only walking.Chapter 9\n\nCassidy let the morning come to him rather than stepping out into it as if he could outpace whatever the town had planned. The light was thin again, a sheet spread tight, and he watched it gather itself on the edge of his mother\u2019s crockery and the cheap metal of the kettle. He used the notebook he\u2019d bought because paper that was meant for shopping lists had a way of forbidding grandiosity, and he wrote three headings he had decided to live under for the day: What we refuse; What we accept; What we make. Under refuse he put the names the papers liked and crossed them out once, then again, until the page had that bruised feel of correction that satisfied him. Under accept he put: we are being watched; we are being led; we are allowed to step off the line. Under make he left a space, because leaving a space had become the only ambition he trusted not to turn into self-praise. When he got to the station Patel was already there with her hair tied back into the sort of knot that declares an intention. She slid him a stack of reports and the top one had a neat underline she\u2019d made that he had come to read as the opposite of panic. \u201cTwo imitations overnight, both schoolboys, both contrite the second you looked at them like a human. One dictaphone returned by a man who\u2019d put his shopping on it to reach his keys and realized he was part of a story. No jars moved without permission. Caf\u00e9s reporting shortages in jam because you\u2019ve turned the town into a metaphor.\u201d He laughed because he was proud and because pride is ridiculous when you claim it for a thing that isn\u2019t yours, and he promised to resolve the jam if he could resolve the man, and she said that was a fair bargain on a Wednesday.\n\nBruce had given himself a new rule, which was to wait until after nine before he did anything that made his heart skip, and it was a rule he knew he would break but he wanted the feeling of having made it. He boiled the eggs and ate the yolks slowly because he had decided that eating the part he disliked was a small apology that might be accepted by the day if not by any person. The cinnamon line at the baseboard had held, and he watched an ant go right up to it and then swing away without any complaint, and the politeness of that movement made his eyes sting in a way he would not be able to defend to anyone. He stood at the window and permitted himself an inventory of what he had not done: he had not laughed at the wrong time since the afternoon in the tackle shop when the man had made a joke about bait and he had swallowed the sound like a boy swallowing a sweet he had not paid for; he had not set a circle in a place a child could stumble on it and feel they had been made into a riddle; he had not written the girl\u2019s name down even once. He put on his boots without the extra loop for luck to prove to himself luck was not a god he answered to anymore, and then he put the loop in and took it out again because superstition and sincerity are cousins and neither of them likes to be snubbed in public.\n\nLorna brought in a little tray she had stolen from the kitchen and placed the elements on it like a teacher arranging a lesson. The dictaphone had given up its short song of laughter and a low hiss that might have been wind and might have been the mouth of a bottle, and she\u2019d saved the clips and slowed them until the spaces between the breath could be read. \u201cNo train noise, no roads close enough to make a simple guess, a fox in the middle if I had to put money on it, and that laugh,\u201d she said, tapping the tinny speaker with a nail, \u201chas had practice at being smaller than it wants to be. There\u2019s a pressure in the top of it where the sound gets pushed. You could get a read on a cough from it if we were lucky about pollen, but we\u2019re not. Timber says middle-aged man who has not exactly been quiet his whole life but has learned how to be.\u201d Cassidy didn\u2019t ask how she knew. He listened again and recognized the part of the sound that had tried to be kind and failed, and he hated how that made it worse. Patel stood in the doorway and chewed her thumbnail because she had decided not to bite down on her tongue after last year, and she said, \u201cIf he wants us to hear him, at least he\u2019s stopped using other people\u2019s voices,\u201d and he wrote that down without looking like he had.\n\nThe press had pressed. He stood in front of the familiar rectangle of microphones because people get frightened if you stop giving them a place to look, and he said the sentences about public reassurance in a tone he had tuned to manage both patience and steel. A child had coppered the day by holding a jar in a photograph, and he had felt his mouth pull tight at that, not because it implicated anything he could arrest but because it made the jar a toy, and he had spent a week trying to make it everything but. When the gloss-haired reporter asked him whether he believed the perpetrator was \u201copening dialogues,\u201d he said that talking can be a way to stop your hands doing what they want to do, and got himself in trouble with the men who wanted him to say madness because madness is comforting when you can tie it to someone else\u2019s ears. His publisher rang and left a cheery voicemail with a sorry about all that jar business at the end of it, and he put the phone face down because face down was a way of telling himself it wasn\u2019t real, which is a trick he had learned from people who had taught him what denial looks like in a neat suit.\n\nBruce bought a float he would never use because the man behind the counter had a way of talking that made you feel you were already forgiven. He carried the small thing in his pocket and let it knock against his thigh until it became something he thought with rather than an object. He walked past the crooked spire and resisted the pull to go inside again because penance done twice in a week was either devotion or obsession and he had at least decided which he disliked more in other men. He did not go to the woman\u2019s house though his feet bent towards it, because he had said he would not, and there are days when that kind of fidelity, to a boundary that only exists because someone spoke it, can feel like heroism without any of the applause. On his street a man was washing a car with dedication that looked theological, and the water left bright streaks like veins on the tarmac, and Bruce found himself stopping to watch, and stopping to watch without laughing felt so newly available to him he had to lean on the post to keep it.\n\nPatel had made a map of their own while he had been staring at the microphones, which is why you ask other people to stand on your left. She had taken the circles and the jars and the note drops and the cheap tape sales and the tack shop purchases and overlaid them with school run times and coffin routes and bin collection days, a domestic web that made his heart contract because all the routes that matter in a town are the ones that repeat whether men perform crimes or not. \u201cHe\u2019s keeping to kindness,\u201d she said, and when he flinched at the word, she added, \u201cI mean he\u2019s choosing places where an accident is unlikely. He knows where children drift, and he does not court them. His cruelty, if we\u2019re calling it that, is polite. There\u2019s a list of shops up here he has not used and two of them are the ones that would have kept receipts.\u201d He loved her for the ugliness she refused to gloss and he loved her for naming kindness even when he hated that it was the right word. He took her map and put it next to his notebook entry for what we make and drew a line not around the field but around the places men swear are not the field and wrote: shadow perimeter. Sometimes naming is a trap. Sometimes naming is a release. It would be too neat to pretend he knew which he was doing.\n\nThe boy on the desk had begun to learn how to say no in a way that invited people to accept it, and Cassidy took a mean, petty little joy in that because a station is made or broken at the front by the tone in a lad\u2019s voice when he tells someone they can\u2019t see the inspector. The woman in the red coat came again, a little earlier, and brought a jar wrapped in a towel with an embarrassment that touched him harder than the object. \u201cIt was on the wall by my gate,\u201d she said, and she stood there with her hands doing their own small ritual of keeping each other from saying too much. Inside was no sugar line or float or note, only a tracing of steam caught on the glass as if someone had held their mouth to it and breathed out gently. He looked and he knew the shape of that breath like he knew the shape of his own name in a room that didn\u2019t welcome it. \u201cHe is stopping,\u201d she said, and by the terrible mercy of English tenses she meant both that he was in the act and that perhaps he would, and he said, \u201cWe will help him,\u201d and knew he had said something that was neither a promise nor a lie but an intention, which is as close as most men get when they are not allowed to be priests.\n\nHe set a decoy because he had an old pride in the craft and he did not intend to let a week of having his steps counted turn him into someone who did not set his own problem. It was not elegant. It was a jam jar with a lid that had been handled with bare fingers and then wiped with a cloth so that a print would be likely but not a certainty, and inside it there was nothing but a small scrap of kitchen roll with a sentence copied from the man\u2019s first note, the one that had done its metal taste trick on him: One of us has to remember. He placed it under the eaves of the community hall between the hours when toddlers are sung to and decent men come to discuss allotments, and he set a camera that did not try to hide because he had learned that hiding makes people perform for you while being visible sometimes grants you the freedom of being ignored. Patel told him he was being theatrical and he said that sometimes the way you find people who love show is you put a small stage where they can step onto it without having to admit to themselves that they wanted to. He hated himself a little even as he said it and his contempt was a good, stingy discipline.\n\nBruce walked past the community hall on purpose and on accident because he had always liked the smell of its wood in the heat and because he had a sense that someone was trying to put a thing on a shelf for him to reach. He saw the jar and he registered the camera and he felt the chuckle rise like a burp he could not control. He put his knuckles to his mouth and he spoke into his hand as if his body were a microphone that might betray him. He did not touch the jar. He stood and looked at it and he let himself admire the honesty of the trap. He read the line inside and felt the muscles along his spine do that climbing thing like cats in cartoons, which is to say his body pulled away and leaned in both at once. He was furious at the insistence of the word remember because remembering was his field and he had been trying, for days now, to walk around the trampling. He left because you should always leave when you feel a door swing both ways and you cannot tell which way is the kinder.\n\nLorna called him into the lab with the sort of expression she used for news that would be useful but not satisfying. \u201cEvidence room breach wasn\u2019t clever,\u201d she said, blowing on a cup of tea that had been allowed to stew itself bitter, \u201cand I\u2019m not sure whether that makes it better or worse. We\u2019ve got a clean trail up to the door, a blur on the camera where there should be a man, which was achieved by a piece of tape with Vaseline on it, and then a blank because somebody left the camera pointing at the ceiling. I pulled the logs. A night cleaner\u2019s fob. The night cleaner does not have a nephew, and yet a nephew entered. I can build you a list of people who have nephews if you want a laugh, but it will not get us closer to your jar. If you\u2019re asking me whether the breach was an inside job, I\u2019d say it was inside the building but outside the team, and if you\u2019re asking me whether that\u2019s what the team wants to hear, I\u2019ll say you should buy biscuits.\u201d He bought biscuits because biscuit buying is a language that has saved more stations than policy ever did, and he told Patel to send flowers to the cleaner because being used is a special kind of hurt and flowers were the only apology he could sign off without involving a lawyer.\n\nHe watched the decoy jar for an hour that felt like practice at being still, and in that hour three different people noticed the camera and adjusted what they were carrying and two women performed complaint with that generous relish people have when they suspect they are protecting their babies from the world, and one man in a fluorescent vest paused and put his hand on the jar as if checking to see if it were warm. The man in the vest was not Bruce, and this knowledge did not comfort him because hope had begun to attach itself to what he could not plan for. At eleven a boy on a scooter came past and took out his phone and performed a video of the jar\u2019s existence for friends who would watch it and forget, and the word \u201clore\u201d got used in the comments because that is what children call the story of a thing when the adults have not given it a name yet. He pulled the jar back before lunch with the ignominy of the trick that fails without revealing anything but the shape of your vanity, and Patel did not say I told you because she had learned there are ways to be right that make your job harder.\n\nBruce went to see Joel with nothing in his hands because he had decided that if he was going to be forgiven by anyone it would have to be for the thing he had done, not for an exchange rate. Joel\u2019s shop smelled of plastic sweating under strip lights, and this mood is strangely companionable when you need to confess. \u201cI want to tell you something you will not be able to use,\u201d he said, and Joel put his elbows on the counter like a man prepared to hold up more than his share of weight. \u201cDon\u2019t say the field,\u201d Joel said, with an automatic kindness that made Bruce love him. \u201cNo,\u201d Bruce said, and it tasted good to keep one boundary where it belonged, \u201cI want to tell you that I am stopping. That if I laugh, I will swallow it. That if I put something down, I will pick it up again. That if I start to make a circle, I will draw a line through it and go home.\u201d Joel nodded and then had the decency to be honest. \u201cYou won\u2019t,\u201d he said, not cruelly and not without hope, \u201cyou\u2019ll do some of those some days. But you\u2019ve got the look of a man who wants to try, and trying is a thing I still give out scores for like a PE teacher.\u201d Bruce laughed even though he had not planned to, and they both looked at each other like they had shared an act of intimacy and had gotten away with it.\n\nA lunch hour passed in the station with the familiar mending of corners. A constable with a new baby showed photographs that had a way of softening the grip on rage that work sometimes turns into. Lorna told a story about a forensics conference at which men had used the word \u201cladies\u201d in a tone that suggested they had asked permission first, and Patel rolled her eyes with professional finesse and then ate a sandwich with the complacency of someone who had remembered to eat. Cassidy watched his mother\u2019s name light his phone and let himself answer not because he had time but because there is always time when the voice at the other end will be the one that was there when you learned to be less than you wanted to be and more than you thought. She told him she had seen a jar on the news and she had felt the urge to put a knitted cover on it to stop it coming to harm, and he loved her so much in that moment that he had to put the phone on speaker because his hand shook. She said, \u201cBring Patel for tea,\u201d again, and he said, \u201cI will,\u201d again, and the repetition healed something small in him that did not heal when he made grander promises.\n\nThe map in his pocket had begun to feel less like a prophecy and more like a suggestion, a difference he intended to live by. He and Patel took the afternoon as a space to insert three places not on any of the notes, and they did it with the courtesy of people choosing chairs in a busy caf\u00e9, aware that everyone is trying to sit somewhere without making a scene. The first place was the narrow triangle of grass by the sculpture of the miner with the too-clean hands, and he stood there and allowed himself a thought about what statues are for and how they regulate guilt, and then he let it go before he made himself insufferable. The second was the lay-by by the reservoir that had begun it, because you have to go back to the mouth of the story sometimes to remind it you are its author as much as its reader, and he watched the wind riffle the heather with the charity of a man who knew wind had no story. The third was the alley behind his mother\u2019s house because he wanted to test the superstition that says the story will not come where your childhood stood, and he was relieved and ashamed to find that superstition is as arbitrary and as right as it always is.\n\nBruce put a jar on his own step and did not put anything in it. He placed it like a test he could pass and he left it when he went out and he left it when he came back, and when he opened his door after dusk and saw the glass still there like an object that had chosen not to be a symbol, he had to sit on the mat for a moment and breathe because the relief hurt him all the way through. He put sugar under the jar and then swept it away and then put cinnamon there instead and stood and waited for his own judgment and, when it did not arrive, he applauded himself with the mean little claps of a boy who has learned to be his own teacher. He ate a slice of bread without butter because he had decided to make himself small, and then he put butter on a second slice because smallness had never made a man kinder to anyone but himself. As the radio blathered in the next room and the woman with the gentle voice asked a politician to be honest in a tone she knew would fail, Bruce laughed the size of a fingernail and felt forgiven. He did not know by whom.\n\nBy late afternoon the station had acquired that smell of men who have worn their jumpers too long inside the same four walls, and the air was ready for something, not dramatic, but decisive. The boy on the desk handed him an envelope as if it contained a live thing that could be calmed by a certain pressure, and for once, the envelope was dull and brown and had not been folded with an excess of care that made him feel manipulated. Inside was a timetable just like the first, a neat line of times you could set your pulse to, but across it the man had written in the unruffled hand of a boy who always gives himself full marks for neatness: we will go to the field only when neither of us is trying to be good. Cassidy sat with the sentence as if it were a badly behaved friend at a wake and he realized with a low, heavy certainty that the man had understood something criminal and true about him, which was that he had been using goodness as a bargaining chip with the day. Patel read it and made a sound that had no word, and then she folded the paper so that the sentence lay across itself and could not be read without effort, which was her form of editing when men got ideas.\n\nThey walked a route that had not been given to them and felt like their own because they had decided to claim it. It took them up past the school that smelled of dry pasta and small rushes, and along the row where the hedges had learned to tolerate lopsidedness, and down the steps the council had put in to admit their own failure at making slopes. At the corner where three roads tried and failed to become one, the woman in the red coat was waiting not for them but in the way you wait when you do not want to reach the place you are going at the speed your legs would get you there. She did not move to intercept and they did not stop, and the courtesy of that choreography made him feel oddly adult. A boy on a bike came too close and yelled comedy apologies with an exhilaration he would have liked more if he hadn\u2019t been allowing himself the luxury of feeling old. When they reached the alley that refused its own name, the smell of damp fence caught at the back of his throat like a word he could not yet recall, and he touched the wood with a hand he kept visible because his hands had become part of the conversation.\n\nHe cooked for himself because he had decided he would not rely on his mother to tidy the day for him just because she could. The stew took too long and not long enough and he ate it with the agitation of a man who wants there to be a task attached to swallowing. He took out the notebook and wrote under What we make: a way back, and then he turned to a fresh page and wrote a line that was not the first sentence of the book he had promised but the first sentence of any page that would let him keep living near work without becoming work. It said: I will not make a man into a story until he makes himself into one, and even then I will check for his permission in places that are not his mouth. He did not pretend he would keep it, because men like him promise lines to themselves the way other men promise each other favours, but he let the words sit on the kitchen table like a little barricade against the version of himself who would be tempted to be clever and paid for it with something soft.\n\nBruce did not put anything out that night. He did not lay a line or a float or a thin film. He did not press his nail into the soft blue of the ant farm because it was in the station now and he was in his house and there were things he had sent away from himself with a weird pride that he preferred, for the first time in a while, to keep. He stood in the dark and did not check the window to see if the street was empty, because the street had earned the right to be itself without his surveillance. He laughed once because laughing had become a thing his body did the way some people\u2019s bodies make a small noise when they stand up too fast, and he swallowed the sound into himself as if it were tea he had decided to sip rather than gulp. When he slept his dreams had the kind of narrative that is a mercy, a straightforward story about a bus that did and did not arrive, and he woke with the clean disappointment this yields. He placed his finger on the photograph\u2019s edge without flipping it, because there are days when turning something over is a violence even if it is a softness when you\u2019re finished.\n\nBy morning a circle had appeared that was not his and not Cassidy\u2019s, which embarrassed both of them because the town has the right to create meaning without being asked to sign for it. It was in chalk outside the library where the children\u2019s hour made adults pretend their nostalgia was wholesome, and in the middle of it a woman had written in a terrible looped hand that these sorts of hands prefer: Be kind. The circle was swept away by a man with a brush because chalk annoys men with responsibilities they take seriously, but the sentence remained because chalk is persistent, and he stood and watched as the curve of the B tried to hold onto the pavement a second longer than the other letters, and he felt grateful and stupid and ready all at once. Patel nodded at the sentiment and then insisted they ignore it for work purposes because you can\u2019t prosecute sentimental instructions even if they are rude enough to tell you how to do your job. He wrote Be kind in his notebook anyway and did not cross it out, which was a rebellion of the most pathetic kind and therefore the only one that did not pour poison back into the system.\n\nAround noon, when the town likes to pretend it can be a different town after lunch, another dictaphone arrived under a jar that had not been meant to sing. The voice that came out when Lorna pressed play had learned a new thing overnight; it was the same laugh, damped and willing to behave, but under it there was a word that had not gotten permission to be heard and had gotten out anyway. It was the girl\u2019s name. It came like a breath the body had tried to hold and failed. Cassidy did not write it down because paper is a kind of court, and he did not repeat it to Patel because repeating is a kind of ritual, and he did not let it loose in the briefing room because letting names loose is like telling a dog to go and run along the road. He pressed stop and he held the little machine in his palm with the careful disgust he reserved for things that carried grief that wasn\u2019t his, and he said aloud, only to the corners of the room that had listened to policemen practice speeches for thirty years, \u201cWe are almost done being polite.\u201d\n\nBruce had not meant for the name to be bought by the air. It had slipped out of the side of his laugh like a coin dropped by a man who does not keep change separate from his notes, and he had felt it go and had not reached out because reaching out to stop a name is the same as chasing it, and chasing is a kind of performance and he was trying to stop performing. He walked to the field and stood at the gate because it had become the only way to do the opposite of what he had been doing, and the gate made its small sound and he placed his hand where his hand had learned to go, and he did not step up or over. He did not think the word pilgrimage because pilgrimage romanticizes distance and he was practicing an uglier kind of honesty that day, the sort that refuses poetry. He laughed once and he stopped the laugh by biting down on the side of his mouth until he tasted salt that had not been put there by sugar, and he said out loud, to the soil that would not reward him for talk, \u201cI am not bringing you anything today,\u201d and he meant it with a sincerity that scared him because it felt like theft from his own only language.\n\nThey did not make a plan to go to the field that afternoon and so of course that was when the field made a plan to receive them. A boy with a dog whose name was Martin and could again be misheard as Monty, because this is how stories remind you that they repeat, came to the station with a face that had learned how to be important because someone had just told him the right thing would depend on what he said next. The dog had rolled in something that smelled like a dead story and the boy had gone down into the basin to shout and had found a circle of cinnamon so strong that he had sneezed three times like a cartoon, and in the middle of the circle there was no jar and no float and no paper and no nothing. Cassidy closed his eyes because the body has to signal its gratitude to bad news for its clarity, and then he stood and he called Patel and he called Lorna and he told himself that he would walk to the field and he would not count his steps and he would not look at his hands and he would not call what was about to happen anything until it had finished happening. This is a discipline. It is not one he had often kept.\n\nThe basin had accepted the cinnamon with the quiet one might grant a doctrine too mild to argue with. The wind had gathered it at the edges as if to stop anyone sneezing themselves sick, and the ants had performed an obedience that made the throat tight. There was no jar, which he found hysterically offensive after a week in which glass had been the god of small intentions. The circle was a line a man had drawn for himself and not crossed, and he stood with a sudden, wretched pride he could not defend or explain. Patel came to his side and did not step over because she had gotten good at not claiming a line even as she inspected it, and Lorna made an irritable sound because politeness makes crumbly evidence. \u201cHe\u2019s saying he can stop while showing us he can still draw,\u201d she said, which was the sort of sentence that would be quoted poorly later in the dark places where people like to make stories about men who hurt other people, and he nodded because she had earned that ugliness with a day of seeing too closely to be flattered by it.\n\nHe did not touch the cinnamon because it was not his to handle if this was a peace offering, and he did not photograph it straight away because sometimes the act of making a record is the thing that changes the fact in front of you more than the weather ever could. He stood and he let himself think a dangerous thought, which was that maybe the jar had been showing them a man teaching himself to be tidy in public, and maybe the field would not need to be refreshed with his grief if he could learn to make his circles at home where cinnamon lines held. He did not say it because thoughts like that end up signed in ink in places they shouldn\u2019t, and he liked his job enough to know what it can\u2019t hold. Patel, who could always smell when his brain went soft, put a hand near his arm without laying it on, and he understood the signal: be a policeman now, not a man who writes things down for soft reading later. He pulled on gloves and he asked for the tape and he measured the circle with his eyes in the old way and he told a constable where to stand so his boot made a friend for yesterday\u2019s tread.\n\nBruce sat on his own back step with the glass in his pocket and a walnut he could not crack with his teeth because he had never learned the trick, and he took a little proud pleasure in that lack because there are weaknesses you do not want to cure. Across the street a woman drew a chalk rainbow for a child who had already learned that chalk is a temporary claim, and the child coloured within the lines with an obedience that frightened him and moved him. He laughed, small and no bigger than a cough, and the child looked up at him with the clean suspicion children reserve for men who laugh on steps. He waved with a sincerity he almost got away with, and the child waved back because the child had not learned the rhythms of precaution yet, and the woman looked at him with a careful inattention because women have. He swallowed the next laugh before it thought to be born, and he went back inside and sat with his back to the sink and listened to the disgusting, beautiful steadiness of water going where it should in a house that was not yet broken by any of his tricks.\n\nBack at the station the envelope waited that would make the afternoon into what the afternoon had always intended to be. It was heavy in the way envelopes get heavy when someone has added weight to make you feel its seriousness, and inside there was a rough circle cut from a map with impatience, and a sentence that told him what time would be honest and what time would be theatre. Dawn, it said, and then it said: if you laugh you stop; if I laugh I stop. He showed it to Patel and she lifted one eyebrow in a way that meant she was finding him a way to keep his dignity while reminding him he had already lost a slice of it by believing in this fairness. They made a plan about bodies and cameras and routes they would not take and angles men don\u2019t think of because they have not learned to carry prams, and he sent a message to his mother that said simply, early, and she texted back, I know, like a woman who had always known when her son was going to go to a field and perform dignities. He put the note in his pocket and he said to himself and to whatever it is in a room that listens when you are not saying it aloud: do not ruin this by narrating.\n\nHe slept in the way police sleep before early things, which is to say he lay down and he let the body pretend to go dark and he allowed his brain to run its show behind a curtain and he got up twice and forgot he had gotten up at all. He put on his boots and he did the laces once because he had promised himself a minimal superstition, and he did not look at the notebook because the book had no right to the shape of what was about to happen. He met Patel at the van with the thermos she liked, too strong, and with a silence he hoped would count as professionalism, and they did not talk about where they would stand or not stand because these were movements they had already rehearsed in the unattractive ballet of necessary work. The sky above the basin was not honest about its plan and he found himself liking it for that, because honesty is not a virtue in a landscape, only a quality some men ask of other men so that they can feel right pronouncing them sinners. He walked and he did not count and he kept his hands where he could see them until he reached a place where keeping them in sight would itself be theatre, and then he put them in his pockets because warmth is allowed to trump symbolism on a cold morning.\n\nBruce had waited for dawn outside of sleep and found that his body could be more patient than he had quite allowed. He did not eat an ant. He did not eat anything. He had tea with the water a moment off boil, and then he poured it away because making will make you do stupid things like forget to drink. He took the jar and he did not take any implements because he had promised himself a clean day, and he walked the streets with the care of a man who knows which stones like to slide under your feet. He did not look for cameras because cameras are nerves and he had enough of his own, and he did not perform his hands because there would be nobody to read them, and he laughed once very softly at the thought that if a man laughs alone in the morning it might count as a prayer after all. He came to the gate and he placed his hand on the wood and it made its almost sound as if it were easing an old joint, and this was the courtesy he had been craving from the world all week. He did not step over. He stood. He waited.\n\nThe basin did not want a speech. The cinnamon line from the day before had been blurred by a wind that had not meant to take sides, and the ground held that sucked-light sheen that peat gives you when it would prefer not to have your boot. He stood at the edge with Patel in his periphery and the men he had begged for when he had needed muscle behind decency, and he looked down at the little theater he had let a man build in his case and he did not hate himself for that, because hating yourself at the edge of a decision is a child\u2019s way of asking to be forgiven before you act. The man was not there and then he was there, in the way that careful men appear when they decide to stop avoiding an appointment. He did not look like a monster because monsters are a theater costume and Bruce had never liked dressing up. He looked like a man trying not to knock over a thing he had just stopped himself wanting. Cassidy did not speak and neither did he, and this was the first good decision of the morning. The sound in the basin was not quite silence. It was the soft not-noise of a day not begun.\n\nThe agreement about laughing had been written because it had to be written, not because it would be kept. Cassidy felt the reflex in his throat and he shut it as if he had swallowed a too-hot thought. Bruce felt his laugh jitter in his jaw and he pressed his tongue to his teeth because he had decided to give himself that trick and it worked, impractically, as far as tricks do. They stood as men stand when the air wants to do a thing and you are considerate enough not to ask what thing that is. Patel placed herself as if she were the thought in his head that would keep him from winning by the wrong set of rules. Lorna was not there because you do not bring a woman who must touch things for a living to a place where touching is half the crime. A fox broke the small etiquette of the morning by making its way along the edge with the indifference that keeps animals moral, and Bruce watched it and then he looked at Cassidy and Cassidy allowed himself a small nod because consent, even between men, is a discipline.\n\nWhen he spoke, Bruce did not say sorry. He did not say the name that had escaped his laugh. He said, \u201cI am trying to stop,\u201d and it was the least dramatic sentence he\u2019d managed all week, and it had the correctness of a man who has practiced arranging his mouth around a truth he can carry. Cassidy let the air close over the words and then he answered with the sentence he had written to himself last night and then crossed out so it would not own him. \u201cWe are going to stop you,\u201d he said, and he found, as he said it, that he meant it in a way that allowed for more than one ending. Bruce nodded at the offer of a soft plural, and his mouth did the thing it had always done when it tried not to do the other thing, and the laugh flickered in the old way and then did not come. He put the jar down on the ground without crossing, which was both an act of deference and a kind of prayer to a fence, and he stepped back, and Cassidy put on his gloves, and behind them the town took a breath that did not belong to them and let it go.",

                              "content": "There were ants in the sink again. Not the occasional troop you get when summer is near and jelly has been left open, but a black, churning seam that found the hairline fractures in the porcelain and worried them like teeth. He watched them for a long time\u2014longer than anyone would admit\u2014standing in his bare feet on cold tile, palms flat on the counter, soft laughter breaking out of him like a wheeze.\n\n\u201cHungry?\u201d Bruce said to them, but it was to himself. He said it again, because repetition strengthened the magic. \u201cHungry.\u201d\n\nHe dipped two fingers into the sugar bowl, spread a little sweetness along the wet rim where the ants hesitated, and saw them surge, more and more, in that beautiful mindless ambition. The ceiling fan whirred. Something ticked in the other room. He felt it all as one knit sensation, a mild pressure at the base of his skull.\n\nHe ate the first dozen. Pinched them carefully as if handling eggshells, tilted his head back, and let them fall into his mouth. He chewed very slowly. Crunch. Crunch. The taste was faint, but he had trained himself to notice the faintness, like learning to read rain on glass. Each bite gave him a sliver of something that was neither food nor memory. He laughed again. It misfired out of him in a chirp. Ragged man, ragged laugh.\n\nThere was a photograph face down on the kitchen table. He didn\u2019t flip it over. He had promised himself a day of looking away, and so he did. The promise felt like a torn thumb grazing a thorn and he relished that too, the precise little hurt of it. He ate seven more, and then wiped his fingers on his shirt and sat in the chair that leaned. He knew the chair would give eventually, because everything did.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you,\u201d he said softly, but he didn\u2019t mean the ants.\n\nOutside, the estate stretched in a haphazard grid of pebble-dash semis and saplings the council had put in and forgotten. The street\u2019s single lamp snapped off as the morning came up, thin and undecided. A fox trotted, head low. A woman carried a plant across the road like a baby.\n\nBruce listened to the drain glug and thought about a field where something had happened, and then he thought about not thinking about it. He picked a sliver of ant leg from his molars with the corner of his nail, was shocked at how human that felt. It was easier not to be human when he was eating, which was a stirring contradiction he admired for its smallness. He loved small things. Small things could be made to vanish.\n\nLater, when he laced his boots and tied the lace twice and then once more for luck, he told himself that regret was a form of fuel, and he was well supplied. His breath fogged the hallway mirror and left a smeared oval. He smiled into the oval. The smile looked like a scar. Passable, he thought. He put the photograph in his pocket without looking at it, and went out.\n\nThe morning was a raw sheet over the Chesterfield edge. The crooked spire would be a thumbprint on the sky if he climbed far enough. He thought about that for a while as he walked: the spire, the sky, the thumb. He touched the hole in his jacket where it had snagged on barbed wire last winter. He laughed, soft and to himself. He liked to laugh. It kept him from thinking, which kept him from remembering, which kept him moving. A chain of cheap miracles. He bit the pad of his finger until the sting made him breathe in sharply and feel clean. If he had been watched as he crossed the roundabout and took the side path where the hedges were thin and too symmetrical to be honest, his shape might have looked like anyone\u2019s.\n\nHe knew only the precise moment he would stop. Everything before was routine and everything after was wind.\n\n\u2014\n\nOn the other side of town\u2014in the old part, where the streets kinked and became alleys and the stone had something moist about it\u2014DI Thomas Cassidy was pretending not to be a writer.\n\nHe had shepherded himself through three interviews that morning, two for the book and one for the job, and each had been a different kind of bad. He could do the job interview in his sleep after twenty years. You take responsibility, you don\u2019t take credit, you remember to say safeguarding and strategy and partnership. You polish your vowels. It was the book ones that scraped at him. The woman from the radio wanted to talk about method; the man from the local paper wanted to talk about his hair, which had gone white down the middle in a cat-scratch. He played along. He kept smiling. He did not mention Bruce, because there was no Bruce yet, not publicly. He did not mention ants or regret or the field where something had happened, because he liked to keep his life in boxes. He had always been neat.\n\nHis phone buzzed as he was leaving the caf\u00e9. His mum, he thought, with a text about Sunday. But it was the desk. He almost didn\u2019t take it. He took it.\n\n\u201cDI Cassidy.\u201d\n\n\u201cBoss, you\u2019re needed.\u201d\n\nWhen his sergeant said you\u2019re needed in that clipped tone, it meant not needed so much as required, as if the town had put its thumb on his chest. Cassidy felt that old familiarity rise in him, like the way you step into a coat that fits because your body remembers. \u201cWhere?\u201d\n\n\u201cNear the reservoir. Walker found\u2026 something. It\u2019s odd.\u201d\n\n\u201cOdd how?\u201d\n\nThe sergeant made the sound that meant an unsolved word. \u201cYou need to see. We\u2019ve got officers en route. And, uh, there\u2019s a note. Kind of. Not a note. You\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\nCassidy looked back through the caf\u00e9 window. His face cut him off as if it were unfamiliar. He had been telling himself he would take some time; he had been telling himself he would write things down in a way that kept the ends clean. The book\u2019s cover had a detective on it who was better looking than he was. He thought this would be funny, and it had been funny for exactly a day.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m coming,\u201d he said.\n\nHe walked to the car briskly. He did not run. He did not text his mum. He did not call his ex, who would have said, You are incapable of telling me the truth about your own needs, and then hung up, and he would have had to agree. He joined the main road and watched the houses open out like a final breath.\n\n\u2014\n\nThe first time he saw her after the field, Bruce had been eating ants. This was the trick his mind played: it boggled his body into action when it remembered too much. He could not say when it had started. He was nine or thirteen or twenty and it had been a joke at first, because boys make jokes with their bodies when they are afraid. He remembered the school trip where they had dared each other to eat a worm. He had not done that, because he thought of the worm\u2019s children, but he had eaten the ants then\u2014a handful, a gulp\u2014and learned something bright and hard about the way small lives enter you and disappear. Years later, the joke became a ritual. Years after that, it was the only thing that could mop up the noise.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d she had said that time. He could not see her face, only a suggestion of hair in the doorway, and the door kept moving as if someone were trying to close it and could not. \u201cDon\u2019t do that in the house.\u201d\n\nHe had laughed, and the laughter had come back at him from the bare floorboards. \u201cI know what you\u2019re doing,\u201d she had said, and he had laughed again because he didn\u2019t. He never did, not really.\n\nThere were gaps in him, and he had learned to walk around them. You sidestep. You pretend the missing shapes are a choice. You say sorry in a voice that sounds like someone you might forgive.\n\n\u201cNot in the house,\u201d she said again, and walked away in those soft house socks that never made a sound.\n\n\u2014\n\n\u201cHis name\u2019s Darren Peake,\u201d said the constable at the reservoir. The wind came straight off the water. It pushed the grass down flat in one direction and then changed its mind. There was no shelter. The constable\u2019s ears were red and raw and the tip of his nose shone. \u201cWalked his dog early. Dog\u2014Monty? Marty?\u2014went mad over that ridge, and when he got there, he said he felt\u2026 I don\u2019t know. Funny.\u201d\n\n\u201cFunny,\u201d said Cassidy, and tasted the word. The ground had that sucked at flavour of peat. \u201cIn what way?\u201d\n\nThe constable shrugged. \u201cHe said he was laughing. And he wasn\u2019t a laughing sort, from the sound of it.\u201d\n\nThe ridge sloped down to a shallow basin where the heather changed to a skin of cracked clay. You could see the water had sat here in the rains, and then gone away and forgotten to take something with it. In the middle of the basin, someone had laid out small circles in a larger circle, careful as a schoolkid\u2019s project. At the centre was a jam jar.\n\nCassidy approached. The circles were not stones or coins or paper rosettes. He bent, used the edge of a pencil to nudge one, and pulled the smile out of his face the way you remove a splinter.\n\n\u201cAnts,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re everywhere,\u201d the constable said, backing up. \u201cSorry. Makes my\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Cassidy. He knew the feeling. The ants themselves had been trapped in tiny plastic lids\u2014the kind you pop off milk bottles\u2014thin film over the top to keep them in. A hundred tiny, fuming prisons, set out with extraordinary neatness. The jar in the centre was full of water. In it, a scrap of paper floated like a drowned insect.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t touched anything,\u201d the constable offered, and Cassidy nodded. Good lad. He stepped carefully between two of the lids and took the jar with both hands as if it were an egg. He looked at the paper without disturbing it. A felt-tip had bled in water into a grey fog, but the letters were still legible.\n\nHe read it aloud. \u201c\u2018One of us has to laugh. One of us has to eat. One of us has to remember.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cWho writes that?\u201d the constable said, as if it were indecent. \u201cWho thinks of it?\u201d\n\nThe wind lifted and put his hair in his eyes. Cassidy put the jar back exactly where it had been. The note gave him a taste of metal. It was theatrical and yet not; no declarations, no name, no signature flourish. He thought of the radio interviewer asking about his method and wanted to go back and apologize to the air for having wasted it.\n\n\u201cGet Scenes of Crime,\u201d he said. \u201cNo prints, no shoe marks. Someone spent time here. Look at the spacing.\u201d He measured with his eyes. \u201cThis is deliberate. Not rage, not a tantrum.\u201d\n\n\u201cBoss, there\u2019s another bit.\u201d The constable had squatted, then jumped up as if he\u2019d been caught stealing. \u201cThere. The line. Is that\u2014?\u201d\n\nCassidy followed his gaze. Around the outside edge of the ring of lids, a faint trail had been drawn in something greasy. The late sun made it sheen. It could have been oil. It could have been something else. The ants who had escaped\u2014because of course a few had\u2014crawled over the line and then stopped as if surprised. Some turned back. Some walked in place, confused into a circle a few inches across. The closer he looked, the more wrongness he found.\n\nHe took out his phone. His hands looked ordinary and perhaps tired. He photographed the circle from three angles. He photographed the note in its jar. He photographed the footprints around, all of them the same size, the same tread; a single pair of boots pacing a careful circumference. He photographed the empty land beyond, which looked as if it had been waiting and would continue to wait, untroubled by ants, cops, men.\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s Mr. Peake?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cIn the car, keeping warm. He\u2019s shaken. And he thinks it\u2019s a message.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is a message,\u201d Cassidy said, and felt the warmth of how obvious that was sink into the cold wind. \u201cHe\u2019s right. It\u2019s a message to us, and to someone else.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo who?\u201d\n\n\u201cTo whoever knows the other half.\u201d\n\nThe constable bit his lip in the way young men do when they are trying not to do something else. \u201cBoss?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat line. What is it made of?\u201d\n\n\u201cSmell it,\u201d Cassidy said, and immediately regretted it. He\u2019d said it without thinking. The advice of an old man to a boy. He squatted and touched his glove to the sheen and held his fingers under his nose. The scent reached him: faint, sour, kitchen-sink. He knew it so well he couldn\u2019t place it. He had a moment of oddness\u2014as if his childhood kitchen had been tipped into that basin. Then he had it.\n\n\u201cSugar water,\u201d he said. \u201cOr something like it.\u201d He looked at the constable. \u201cA trail.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor the ants.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor the ants, and for us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho would\u2014?\u201d\n\nCassidy had an answer in his mouth. He didn\u2019t say it. He shook his head instead and turned away, his boot making a perfect print next to the nearest lid, then lifted carefully so as not to blur the edges.\n\n\u2014\n\nHe ate two on the lip of his cup, just to be sure he still knew how. He made sure to be seen eating them, because that was the right game to play. The woman at the next table twitched when she realized what he was chewing. He smiled and said, \u201cThey\u2019re very clean,\u201d and then laughed, which made her get up and leave. He didn\u2019t want her to leave. He wanted to tell her something. He couldn\u2019t name the something, and that unnameable thing was a shape that hung in front of him for the rest of his tea. Sometimes his wanting struck him as funny: two proper words sitting next to each other like kids in a school photograph, and him unable to introduce them.\n\nHe thought about the reservoir. He had done that carefully, he thought, good boy. He liked being a good boy. He touched the photograph in his pocket and felt the corner bite his thigh. \u201cOw,\u201d he said, and laughed, and then inhaled the laugh as if it were smoke to be kept. He would go home now and sit at the table and take the photograph out and not look at it. He would line up ten grains of sugar on the wood and crush each with the tip of his thumb. He would phone nobody. He would boil eggs and undercook them on purpose and eat the whites and throw away the yolks softly into the bin because he couldn\u2019t bear the sight of that dense yellow with its eye. When he did not bear things, he destroyed them gently, as a courtesy.\n\nHe paid with coins and left the receipt in the saucer, folded into a crane he had not learned to make, and felt a sudden radiant certainty that someone was watching him. He turned slowly. Nobody. The caf\u00e9 was empty save the girl who wiped the tables and let her hair curl over her face like vines hiding the side of a ruined house, and the bell that hung by the door and chimed when nobody touched it because of the passing bus. He thought: Not yet. Then he thought: Soon.\n\nAt home he laid the photograph flat on the table and did not look. He turned the radio up. The presenter spoke in a voice like a spoon stirring tea and then fell into a song that was mostly a humming. He put his head down and felt the wood. He made himself still, made himself vanish, the way he had learned in school when the teacher asked where the twenty pence had gone and he was the only child with a pocket big enough to hide it, even though he hadn\u2019t stolen it, not that time. The trick of vanishing, of being so still you cease to throw off reflection, served him better than honesty ever had.\n\nWhen he finally turned the photograph over he did it with ceremony, a flair of his hand, as if he were revealing a card. He saw the girl. He saw the weeds behind her as if they had been planted specifically for that purpose. He saw her mouth, a crease of carelessness he had loved, and he put his finger on it and then took his finger back as if it had been bitten.\n\n\u201cHi,\u201d he said. It was both too formal and too soft. He found a black dot near the corner of her smile with a smear trailing away and realized it was an ant that had gotten itself flattened under the lamination. He laughed. He would have cried if he had remembered how.\n\n\u2014\n\nHe should not have gone home. He should have stayed in a hotel. He should have put the map on the table at the station and made circles on it until the map looked like an overripe fruit. He should have said yes when his sergeant said we can handle this, go to the launch and wear the jacket. He did none of that. He went home because his mother had put stew on and would be offended if he didn\u2019t at least pretend to try it.\n\n\u201cYou look thin,\u201d she said, because this was her line and she loved it.\n\n\u201cI am thin,\u201d he said, and smiled a little because he could.\n\n\u201cWhat did you do this morning? Don\u2019t say nothing. And don\u2019t say \u2018cases\u2019 like you do.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was at the reservoir near Ladybower,\u201d he said, and felt her attention focus in that maternal way that lifted his shirt and pressed an ear to his chest. She had grown up on stories of bodies in water. He softened his tone. \u201cA thing. Odd. We\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot a suicide,\u201d she said, making it a statement that could be argued with.\n\n\u201cNot obviously.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot another girl,\u201d she said, softer.\n\nHe thought of the circle of lids, their mad precision. \u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201cEat your bread before it gets cold,\u201d she said, and there was such fierce love in it that he ate half the loaf and a bowl and a half of stew while promising to have friends, to sleep, to let the album he didn\u2019t like run because she liked the quiet bits. He lay on the sofa while she washed up and looked up at the ceiling where the early damp was bloating the paint like skin over a bruise. He told himself he would sleep and then he would write and then he would go back to the station and start the loops that investigations become. He closed his eyes. He saw a jam jar in a basin.\n\nWhen he woke it was night and the television was presenting him with a situation in which everybody was smiling and he could not find their eyes. His phone buzzed. He had never changed the settings; the default trill made him think of cheap offices. He ran a hand over his face and let the missed call be missed. He went outside to smoke even though he had given up, because this was habit rather than need. The cold took his breath away like a slap he felt he deserved.\n\n\u201cTom?\u201d his mother said behind him, a voice low and safe. \u201cYou\u2019re shaking.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d he said, and tried a joke he didn\u2019t have.\n\n\u201cGo to bed,\u201d she said. \u201cWrite in the morning.\u201d\n\nHe did not sleep. He stared at the patch of dark at the corner of the ceiling and watched it stretch a slow finger out. He thought, not of his book, but of the boy who had eaten ants for a dare and learned something peculiar about himself. There is something wrong with you, he told the boy, without malice. The boy shrugged. There is something wrong with all of us, Tom, but most of us have the decency to keep it under our tongues.\n\nAt four he opened his laptop and stared at the paragraph he had been carrying around for a month. He deleted it. He typed instead: It begins with a circle and a jar and many small lives. He typed: Sometimes a monster is a man too stubborn to stop. He typed: He laughs. You wonder what he\u2019s laughing at.\n\n\u2014\n\nHe had never been to that part of Chesterfield before, though he lived not far and had a map of the town in his head with the tidy print turned to smudges at the edges. The woman\u2019s house was the color of bread. He stood across the street and waited for the feeling of certainty to arrive. It took its time. When it did, it rolled over him like a badly thrown coat.\n\n\u201cBruce,\u201d the woman said, opening the door before he knocked, as if him being outside had pulled some sinew on the inside of her tight. \u201cYou\u2019re late.\u201d\n\nHe stepped in without looking at her hard enough to have to own it. He knew where the kitchen was. He put his hand on the back of one of her chairs as if bracing himself.\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing,\u201d she asked, \u201ctoday?\u201d\n\nHe smiled. She had always typed her questions in proper sentences. \u201cWorking.\u201d He let the word sit and cool. He put his fingers flat on the table. One of them had a small black stain near the nail. He made a fist and the stain disappeared.\n\n\u201cWorking at what?\u201d\n\nHe laughed, soft and absurd. \u201cAt not wanting anything I can\u2019t have.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you bring it?\u201d\n\nHe looked at her then. She had cut her hair to the top of her neck, and it made her look as if she had been boiled down to essence. He loved and feared essence. He reached into his pocket. He put the photograph on the table and slid it with two fingers so that she could flip it. She did not. She stood with her hands clasped in their own company. She did not want to look at the picture and he did not want to see her look, and so they stood in a perfect stalemate of tenderness.\n\n\u201cDid you\u2014\u201d she started, then stopped, then smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re laughing. Why do you laugh at me?\u201d\n\n\u201cI laugh because I don\u2019t know what else to do,\u201d he said, and because I\u2019m afraid that if I stop laughing I will speak.\n\n\u201cWhat will you say?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he offered, too quick.\n\n\u201cFor what?\u201d\n\nHe spread his hands and looked down at them. Ten fingers. Ten stories. None of them good. He had been born wrong. He wasn\u2019t born wrong. He had walked into wrongness like a church and lit a candle.\n\n\u201cFor the field,\u201d she said after a long time, and the word was a blade pressed flat against his tongue. He nodded. \u201cFor the field. For that morning. For,\u201d and she waved her hand at the air as if there were a flavor in it she could not name, \u201cthe laugh.\u201d\n\nHe waited until his smile felt natural and then he held it until it hurt. \u201cI\u2019ll do better,\u201d he said. It was a child\u2019s promise. She was too tired to call it that.\n\n\u201cI need you to go now,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI am going.\u201d\n\nHe went down her path with his hands in his pockets and his head tucked in like he could retract it into his shoulders. At the bottom of the road he turned left and walked until his legs had a pleasant, stupid ache. He stepped into the park and sat on the first bench that would have him. Children\u2019s voices rose and fell and collided like birds that hadn\u2019t yet learned each other\u2019s wingspan. He put his hand onto the worn slat and the warmth of it startled him. He had not expected warmth, and so he laughed where nobody could hear.\n\nNothing solved the field. Time did not. Eating did not. Laughter did not. He had in fact made the field larger, by drawing circles around it in every act of forgetting. He thought about the policeman with the white hair who would have seen the circles on the clay and understood that they were pretty, and had flinched anyway.\n\nHe took a sweet from his pocket. It was a boiled sweet, the kind his grandfather had sucked until it collapsed like a lung. He put it in his mouth and crunch-crunched it too soon and felt the shards prick his tongue. He swallowed the sensation. He stood, and the bench exhaled him.\n\n\u2014\n\nWhen the news broke that evening it was a small story on a slow day, and then it wasn\u2019t slow anymore. Reporters like to be given a shape; this had a shape, neat and practical and menacing. Nobody had died. Nobody had been hurt. And yet the hairs rose. The photographs looked like art and failure. The words were too few and thus too many.\n\nHe drove to the station and endured the press. He made a statement for both sides of himself, the procedural and the public. He did not say the word ants because it would turn the whole thing into a joke before they had time to decide whether or not it was one. He said pattern and an item and perimeter. He did not say laugh because that was a private domestic sound that did not belong to a town.\n\nWhen he got to his desk there was a letter. Nobody sent letters anymore unless they were dangerous or sweet. He looked at the envelope and put it aside and told himself he would get to it. He got to it at eleven at night when the building had that hollow quality of places that have had people in them too long. He slit the top and tipped the sheet onto the desk. It slid obediently.\n\nSometimes he left a case with the taste of iron in his mouth. Sometimes it was sugar.\n\nThe letter had been written in a neat school hand. There were no loops where there should have been loops and the t\u2019s were crossed in a hurry. He read it once, twice, three times, and on the third his hands did a small involuntary thing which he obeyed, a kind of tightening that made him aware of the cords of his wrists.\n\nIt said:\n\nI have been laughing for a very long time. It keeps things in. It keeps things out. I don\u2019t know which is kinder. Maybe neither. We are going to take a walk, you and I. A careful walk. I will make the maps. You will follow them. We will be so polite about it that nobody will get cross. It\u2019s a game. It\u2019s serious. Don\u2019t let anybody take it away from us. Put the jar back where it belongs.\n\nHe folded the letter along its creases and then folded it again and then again until the paper took on a stubborn thickness. He did not look to see if anyone was watching him. He put the letter in his pocket where it lay alongside his phone, which buzzed as soon as the paper touched it as if offended by the contact of a more patient medium.\n\nHe texted his sergeant: Been sent a letter. Bring gloves. Bring your brain. Bring tea.\n\nHe turned off his computer and sat at his desk by the thin lamp while the station hummed and clicked. He hadn\u2019t meant to write about any of this. He had meant to write something cleaner, something that made a person look good. He thought: That\u2019s never been my kind of truth.\n\nHe thought about a man, a boy, a monster. He thought about regret as a kind of chemical you can breathe in and find height on. He thought that the first thing he would do in the morning was call the woman who had been in each of his cases without being in any of them and ask her to remember something she had never told him, and he would take her silence as a form of precision, as he always did.\n\nThree floors below, in the station\u2019s tired lobby, a woman in a red coat stood looking at a noticeboard with her hands in her sleeves. She turned once, to the left, then to the right, and then she left without having learned what she came to learn. Such movements were made everywhere in the town, and together they traced a pattern only one man wanted to see.\n\nBy midnight, the jar had been stolen from the evidence room.\n\nBy morning, someone had put it back on the basin under the sky.\n\nIt sat there, patient as a promise, reflecting nothing. The ants had escaped their lids. The ants had gone home. Or maybe they had simply stopped being on the surface long enough for human eyes to bear it. The wind moved the heather\u2019s feathers. Not much else.\n\nA fox trotted and paused and snuffed and sneezed. Somewhere in the low scrub a laugh went on too long to be a joke, and then folded itself neatly the way a paper folds and did not belong to anyone at all.",

He stood with his hands in his pockets for half a minute because the idea of touching anything felt like complicity, and then he went forward because not touching felt worse. The jar sat where it had sat the day before, filled to the ring with water that had clouded slightly, as if it had learned a new word in the night and decided to keep it. The lids had been scuffed and overturned by nothing larger than the wind; their cargo had fled, if you believed in flight as a form of morality, and the pattern that had been a nursery or a cruelty\u2014depending on your perspective\u2014was now only litter with intention. He crouched, and his knees made a sound he minded, and he breathed through his mouth until the damp stopped smelling like something locked up. He could not escape the feeling that the land had shrugged and returned a toy to a child because it preferred quiet to truth.\n\nA car door popped and then a second, and DS Patel came over with her chin tucked into her scarf and a face set for bad news, which was to say neutral. She had the kind of eyes that clock everything and reveal nothing until you buy them a coffee and talk about the thing you really care about, and he appreciated that in her, because he had in recent years found the direct glare of competence hard to bear. She didn\u2019t say good morning. She looked, and when she was done looking she gave him the rectangular nod that meant she had confirmed the data her brain had already hypothesized. \u201cEvidence room,\u201d she said, only those two words, because the rest were either a lecture or a complaint and she preferred to be paid to do those. He nodded back and thought of the warder\u2019s bored mouth, the clipboard, the camera that had been installed in a ceiling tile and was probably now peering at a recorded absence like a blind eye. \u201cAny note?\u201d he asked, and she blew a breath into the air as if she could see it accrue on his question and fall to the ground in a shape they could both interpret. \u201cIf there was, it didn\u2019t get to me,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re doing a trace. We\u2019re doing a count. Everybody\u2019s voice is too loud in the corridors.\u201d\n\nHe touched the jar with a forefinger and the water dimpled politely. The paper inside had bloomed at the edges in feathery filaments and he felt an oddly filial dismay at the idea of words perishing. Patel put on gloves and lifted the glass with both hands and he watched her hands, thinking again that hands are the only honest part of most people. \u201cPut it in the boot,\u201d he said, then corrected himself, \u201cNo, leave it. That\u2019s what he asked. He asked us to leave it.\u201d It wasn\u2019t the instruction that bothered him, it was his own obedience to it, the way he found himself nodding to a man he hadn\u2019t met because the request had arrived in the right tone. Patel watched at an angle that kept judgment to a minimum. \u201cYou\u2019re taking his letters personally,\u201d she said, and he had the grace to laugh because she had cut off his excuse before it reached for the desk. \u201cHe wrote to me, not the team,\u201d he said, and it sounded like vanity even to him. \u201cHe wrote to your role,\u201d she said. \u201cHe wrote to the shape of you. It\u2019s not the same as being seen.\u201d\n\nThey walked the circle as if it might protest, keeping to the flattened grass where their own boots had made a clean path the day before, because there are courtesies even in trespass. He tasted iron then sugar then iron again, and realized hunger had become a language he spoke without thinking. \u201cWhat do you make of the line?\u201d he asked, and she bent and touched her finger to the sheen and sniffed and did not flinch. \u201cKitchen,\u201d she said. \u201cCheap sweetness. He wants movement. He wants to choreograph the least of things. He\u2019s auditioning us by how we step.\u201d The word audition struck him as both precise and indecent; he was not a stage he would willingly sell tickets to, but he knew he had been one before now, and that was what made the job turn in his hands like a tool he sometimes distrusted. He stared towards the far bank where the heather gave way to saplings, and as he stared there was a glint that did not belong, a wink of not-nature. \u201cThere,\u201d he said, and Patel was already walking, boots placing themselves in a polite up-down as if they were old guests of the hillside.\n\nThey found it on the third sapling in a line that had never grown as tall as their planners dreamed, a tiny twist of wire holding the corner of a sandwich bag to a branch at the height of a careful man\u2019s chest. The bag contained a scrap cut from a map, and Cassidy felt something inside him drop with the relief of being given a thing he could name. He took the bag down, and because he had already decided to lean into whatever this was, he opened it with the care of a boy unwrapping a present for a sister he liked. Ordnance Survey, one-inch squares like a cattle grid across the land; blue for water, a pale courteous green for the national park, the bones of old farm tracks like bruises. Someone had drawn a narrow line on the paper that crossed three grid squares and paused at the edge as if waiting to be invited into the next. The line was thin and confident and of a kind with the handwriting on the letter, though he knew that was him writing novels onto scratches. Patel held out her hand. \u201cMay I?\u201d she said, and he gave her the piece and watched her eyes do the small dart of a brain speeding up. \u201cHe wants you to meet him on the way or to discover he has already been,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t tell which.\u201d \u201cBoth,\u201d he said, because that felt true in his chest where truth sometimes sat like a bird with its hackles up. \u201cHe wants to be foreknown and he wants to remain a surprise. All men want that. Some don\u2019t have the nerve to write it down.\u201d\n\nHe had not slept properly, which meant his body had gone to work on his mind and shaken out whatever formal arrangement he had made of his thoughts and left them in a heap. He leaned on the bonnet of Patel\u2019s car and phoned the station and arranged for scenes to trample politely and asked that the acting DCI be told because there was an evidence breach and it would be worse to make him hear it from the grapevine. He hung up and found it hard to take his hand off the metal. Patel watched him for a moment that was almost maternal and then reset it to professional. \u201cWe\u2019re going to need to wear this carefully,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re about to be fed. Sometimes being fed is a way of being fattened.\u201d \u201cHe said walk,\u201d Cassidy said, because he had been raised to answer what was in front of him, and she nodded in a way that condensed two decades of experience into the thickness between one eyelid and another. \u201cThen we walk,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd we make sure we\u2019re the ones doing the map when he thinks he is.\u201d\n\nBruce woke to the sound of a neighbour\u2019s baby performing its first opera of the day and discovered he was unreasonably proud of it. The wail sawed the air and then softened to a learning, and he lay on his back and looked at the flake of paint that hung over his bed like a question he had decided not to answer. He had not dreamed, or he had dreamed the dream that was a corridor with doors and behind each only light. He felt lightless in a way he had learned to call clean because the other word he had for it was wrong, and he was trying to be good by himself. The photograph lay on the table where he had left it, which struck him as both naive and romantic, because objects rarely obey in his experience unless they are too small to argue. He went to it and put his finger on the girl\u2019s mouth in the picture and pressed until the lamination made an indignant creak, then withdrew his hand with chastened grace as if he had trespassed on ground that kept a polite fence. He boiled water and made tea and got the timing wrong on purpose because he wanted to drink it too soon and scald his tongue and be forgiven for it by nobody at all.\n\nHe had not learned good craft in his life, only knack, and he distrusted knack because it turns on you and says you never loved me when you try to keep it. Nevertheless he laid his things on the table with a ceremony that would have embarrassed him if anyone had been watching: the arcade of milk bottle lids he\u2019d cleaned and stacked, the jar with its mouth shining like a wound, the tiny shears that made him think of midwives, the roll of tape he had stolen from a job he\u2019d had for a week which he had left with a lie so polite it had been read as truth. He arranged these as a penitent arranges candles, then he ate one ant which he had trapped under a glass overnight on the rim of a saucer as if he were a monstrous child playing with a felt zoo. He closed his eyes and tasted the nothing that wasn\u2019t nothing at all, and was grateful because gratefulness had the same shape as prayer in his mouth and he did not have the habit of the latter. He told himself the map he had made of the far bank was correct, that the stream bed would hold even after the rain because the bed had been made by water older than his father. He told himself he had written the letter neatly enough that the man would understand it as an invitation and not a dare. His chest fluttered and he pressed a hand there as if to iron his breath flat.\n\nIn the kitchen he had to step around the ants, which was an outcome he had created and then resented as if it had happened to him by an unkind universe. He took the sugar out to the step because the woman had said not in the house and there were lines he would not cross even when he was role-playing a monster for a man he had not met. He laid a trail on the low brick wall that hemmed in his square of grass and watched the first scouts find it; he loved the way a decision made by a dot became a tide, the way motion turns into the idea of motion and then into instruction until everybody moves because a single body did. He thought of the field as if it were a square he could step around and found himself standing on it as if memory had had the bad manners to make itself immediate. When he laughed it was not at the field, though the woman would have thought so if she had been there; it was at his own ridiculous belief in geometry as a salvation. \u201cCircular thinking,\u201d he told the air, and there, that was a joke, so it was safe to let himself breathe again.\n\nHe wrote again, because the first letter had opened a gate in him he had half bricked up, and now there was an ugly satisfaction in pushing through. He wrote slowly, licking the tip of the pen because children do it in cartoons and it felt right, and he frowned without meaning to at the slope of his letters because neatness had once been a way to not be hit. He did not sign his name because he did not believe he had one that would be recognized by the man he was writing to, which felt both dangerously romantic and sensibly anonymous. On the fourth line he drew a small circle he did not need to draw and immediately went to the sink and washed his hands as if the ring had gotten somewhere you didn\u2019t want anything to get. He came back and blew on the paper and he folded it and he slid it into the sandwich bag and he sat and waited for conviction the way some men wait for the kettle to reach the shiver that tells you coffee will not be an insult. When it did not come he put his hands flat and took the photograph and put it in his pocket and went out because motion is a muscle and you have to work it or it refuses to work for you when you need it.\n\nCassidy had always distrusted the stretch of town between the petrol station that never took cash after eight and the district of houses that might have been built in a night by a man with a box of bricks. It wasn\u2019t the crime, he told himself, because crime is everywhere and wears the same shoes so you can hear it coming if you know your steps; it was the way the streets refused to learn their names, corners that insisted on anonymity as if language were a kind of surveillance. The map in his pocket told him to cross, then to cross back, then to take the alley behind the shops where broken glass turned into glitter if you stood where the sun wanted you to, and he did as he was told because not doing as he was told would constitute a different kind of obedience. Patel walked beside him, patient and square in the way of a person who had learned not to rush if you wanted to find what you were after. \u201cHe\u2019s making it public enough to be seen,\u201d she said. \u201cHe wants witnesses without having to suffer being watched.\u201d \u201cHe wants a chorus,\u201d he said, and that made her laugh, a brief unmusical breath that made him like her more. \u201cIf I find you writing this down as a metaphor,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019ll tell your mother.\u201d\n\nThey were not the only ones on the walk. A man pushing a pram at a slant that suggested he\u2019d not done it before and was trying to learn the wrist of it. Two boys with scooters like weapons they hadn\u2019t yet decided to use. A woman with a dog that looked like it had been made from spare parts that had turned out handsome. He took a photograph of the corner where the alley spat them out and looked at the image and flinched at the way the paint on the gable end had peeled in a pattern that looked like a map of lakes he had camped by with his father when he had been small enough to believe maps stayed still once you put them away. Patel took his phone and looked again and he did not object because she was looking at the wall not the camera roll. \u201cThere,\u201d she said, and he felt foolish for not having seen it sooner, because it was not cunning. It was tape, clear as a conscience, pinning another packet of paper to the back of the lamppost where the grey paint sucked light. Inside the bag, in a childish hand, because it took effort to write that adultly childish, a note said: Keep left where others go right. Don\u2019t be heroic. Don\u2019t be clever. Laugh if you need to.\n\nHe closed his eyes and the instruction crawled under his skin because it had the cadence of something kind his mother would say if she\u2019d learned to weaponize comfort, and he could not tell whether his flinch came from the tenderness or the fakery of it. He opened them and made himself smile because he had learned that a face, once it is asked to be public, needs to be told what to do. \u201cLeft,\u201d he said, and they went left. The path took them past the school that had been boarded while they put a new one up further away because somebody who liked diagrams had decided distances are warmer than familiarity. Children\u2019s drawings were pasted to the inside of the ground-floor windows, fat houses and thin trees and a sun that smiled because that is what suns do on paper, and taped to the glass with supermarket tape that hauled up the corners. He stopped and placed his hand against the pane on a smear of blue crayon that had wandered beyond its sky. He felt the particular cold of glass that has made up its mind to stop anything happening on both sides, and he took his hand away quickly as if he had been told off. \u201cYou going to tell me what the field was?\u201d Patel asked, not unkindly and not as a provocation but because you have to put your questions somewhere. He kept his eyes on the paper suns. \u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cNot yet.\u201d\n\nHe had chosen a charity shop as a staging post because he liked the idea of things that had belonged to other people making new shapes under new hands. He had brought a bag of clothes to drop at the door, which was the sort of camouflage that made him proud and ashamed in the same breath, because it worked and he wanted to be the kind of man who didn\u2019t need camouflage. The bell above the door made a sound like a laugh clearing its throat. He put the bag down and bent with it and he slid his packet under the table where those who don\u2019t look closely won\u2019t notice anything except the polite problem of storage. The woman behind the till looked at him with a kind of brave indifference that comes after too much practice at being watched. He smiled the smile that took the least muscle effort and had always been useful. He bought a mug without words on it and put a coin in the dish and took his change and kept his hands very still as he walked out because he trusted his hands least of everything he carried around with him. Outside he let himself breathe and then he broke the discipline of a day and ate two ants off his wrist the way other people lick salt before a drink because he needed to know he could still do it and still feel the small windy quiet in his head that came after.\n\nThe packet was found by a volunteer who wanted a second chair for the window display and reached for the wrong thing, and the wrong thing made her squeak and then laugh because that is what you do when there is nobody to see you be frightened. She brought it to the back and they argued for a moment about whether to ring the number that sits near the till and promises to bring men in blue to talk to you without judgment, and then they argued the other way and did it because arguing is a way to pretend you have made a decision rather than had one made about you by the day. Cassidy went because the map had told him to whether he had read that line or not, and as he walked he felt the town readying itself the way an audience coughs and settles the fabric of themselves. He thought again about the book he had promised to write which he had tried to keep separate from his work by erecting a wall he had painted very tastefully, and now he realized a wall is a kind of display if you put any labour into it. He found himself smiling at the notion that his failure to write was the only decent thing about his attempt, and then he did not smile because patting yourself for an absence is a child\u2019s way of trying to get a sweet after breaking a cup.\n\nInside, the volunteer with the beautiful soft cardigan and the face like a careful garden handed him the bag with relief so palpable he nearly apologized. He took the sandwich bag out and read the thin lines. On one, an X had been drawn in thick ink on the edge of a grid square that he recognized as the bottom of Moor View Terrace, and next to it in the same neat hand: Pause here and think about your hands. Do not put them in your pockets. Do not hold them up. Just look. He laughed then, not at the instruction but at the idea that someone thought he could be choreographed down to the angle of a wrist, and the laugh tasted wrong in his mouth because it had borrowed a tone from another man\u2019s laughter he had never heard in person. Patel had known he would do that and so had placed herself behind him so he couldn\u2019t pocket the paper and become a crime scene, and he loved her for it in the quiet way he reserved for people who saved him from being tiresome.\n\nMoor View Terrace was a row of houses that had had their front gardens paved into driveways in a burst of late-century practicality that had turned colours into surfaces. He stood at the corner where the X wanted him and he looked at his hands and felt the childishness of it and nodded anyway because childishness is not always a pejorative. His hands were his father\u2019s hands with the knuckles shaved down by a kinder life. They had learned long ago how to be still under someone else\u2019s shouting and how to move towards a person who had not asked for it without making them jump. He turned them over and the backs looked like maps of rivers he had never sailed, and he stared until the stinging edge of tears made a soft boundary. Patel let him have that, which is an art you do not get taught. \u201cWell?\u201d she said when he dropped them, and he said, \u201cThey\u2019re only hands,\u201d and she said, \u201cThat\u2019s a good and a frightening answer.\u201d\n\nBy mid-afternoon the walk had been a string threaded through the town on a level so domestic it would have been comic if it hadn\u2019t been precise. A packet inside a library book about edible plants that carried underlining that confessed to a different obsessive than the one they were courting. A chalk arrow brushed into a wall where the chalk had been all but blown away, rescued by the fact of a boy\u2019s sticky palm having pressed it there ten minutes earlier. A paper cup with HANDLE ME UNDER NOT OVER written on the rim and a pair of translucent gloves folded inside. Each instruction held a tiny, maddening kindness executed at knife-point, and the mixture made Cassidy feel a bit sick as if he\u2019d eaten a meal cooked by an ex who had gotten very good at pretending a clean slate. They walked and collected and put back what needed to be in place and let go of what would only make the story worse in a courtroom. By the time the light began to flatten with evening he had a map workaday folded into his pocket that showed him they were being steered not towards the field itself but towards the ring of ordinary streets that had learned to live around it.\n\nHe told himself he wouldn\u2019t knock at the woman\u2019s house when the route took him down her road, because knocking meant taking, and he was trying to be the man who left. His feet had other ideas and he let them because sometimes letting your feet make one decision saves you from making ten bad ones with your head. He saw the lamp in her window and knew the shade and knew how the light broke along the edge of the ceiling where the plaster always cracked first and he felt the old softness rise in him like a bruise you press because you think you deserve it. She opened the door before he reached the step and the look on her face lifted and then set like dough that had been overworked. \u201cTom,\u201d she said, and his name in her mouth was a small lesson in restraint. He held up both hands because the note had told him not to put them in his pockets and because his hands were honest, and she looked at them as if they were a pet he had brought home to show her for permission. \u201cHas he written?\u201d he asked, and her eyes did a calculation he did not try to solve. \u201cNot to me,\u201d she said. \u201cTo you always. To me always a silence that thinks it is elegant.\u201d He couldn\u2019t argue with that because arguing would mean claiming to be the man who could change it, and he had given up that role before it made him into something he didn\u2019t like.\n\nHe stood at the gate and told her he would leave her alone and then didn\u2019t for three more sentences because he needed to hear her voice to sleep. She listened as if it cost her money and then she tilted her head the way she had done when they were still in the business of wanting. \u201cIs this the book,\u201d she asked, and he felt heat up the back of his neck like a boy told to stand in front of the class and read the thing he had written in the ink that bled. \u201cI don\u2019t know what this is,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a man making a pattern out of something he did not finish. It\u2019s a man asking me to keep time while he hits the drum.\u201d \u201cYou will,\u201d she said, and did not say because it\u2019s what you do, and he nodded because refusing praise sometimes looks like you are shoving a present back into a hand that needs to give. They stood until standing made both their knees complain and then she said, \u201cDon\u2019t come back unless you are going to sit and shut your eyes,\u201d and he said, \u201cAll right,\u201d and both of them knew it was a promise he would not keep or break cleanly.\n\nHe built his next shape with such care that he made the act of it into a prayer and he let himself believe he was making a shrine rather than a trap, because this distinction mattered to him more than what the law would say later. Behind the old abattoir where the brick had bled and been painted clean and bled again, there was a loading bay that slanted like a jaw that had been broken and set improperly. He rolled the lids in his palm and laid them in the corners where spiders had made nets and abandoned the nets and the wind had put dust on threads until they looked like the hair of old women. He did not trap anything this time, and he thought that might grant him grace or a longer rope. He poured a circle with sugar that glinted as if it wanted to be snow and then didn\u2019t because snow is a lie of softness and sugar is honest about the teeth it makes rot. He put the jar in the middle and he didn\u2019t put paper in it, because not writing is sometimes writing. He stood and looked at his work and saw not art but effort, and effort visible is embarrassing, and so he laughed to break the embarrassment in two. The sound went up and hit the underside of the loading bay and came back wrong like a face you have only ever seen in reflection suddenly turning real.\n\nHe had the letter ready, the one that would go at the next turn and ask the man about the thing men don\u2019t talk about because we have been allowed to forget the right way to do it. He had written: Did you ever laugh in the wrong place, and did anyone forgive you, and did you forgive you. He had written: There is a thing in the ground and I don\u2019t know whether I am digging it up or putting it back. He had written: If you don\u2019t come soon I will teach myself to stop. Then he had crossed that bit out because that was a bluff and he didn\u2019t want to be the kind of bluffer who believed himself. He put the letter into a napkin he had taken from the caf\u00e9 with the bell that rang when the buses passed and then he took it out because stealing was ugly and he was already a thief so he should stop pretending there were lines that excused him. He used his own paper instead and he put it under a flake of paint that had pulled away from the wall with the kind of satisfaction skin takes in healing over a wound.\n\nAt eight, when the station radio got bored of repeating that there were no updates and no road closures and no threat to the public because if you say it often enough it might become true, the night shift constable on the desk looked up and saw a boy with a helmet under his arm and a letter in his hand and a face that had grown serious because faces grow serious when a letter is in them. He buzzed him in and offered him a seat and took the envelope as if it might break and he did not smell sugar because he did not have that word yet. Cassidy\u2019s phone did an angry little dance on his desk and Patel looked at him over the edge of her mug and he shrugged because there is only so much moving you can do in a day before you start to erode your edges. He put the phone on speaker because he couldn\u2019t bear to hold things right now and the new boy\u2019s voice came into the room with the treble of the tiled lobby. \u201cSir,\u201d he said, and that made Cassidy want to tell him to stop, \u201cthere\u2019s a letter for you. It\u2019s got your name on the front and it smells like\u2026 what\u2019s it smell like. Like pancakes.\u201d \u201cSugar,\u201d Patel mouthed, and he nodded because you take your joys where they come and being right is one of the smaller, easier pleasures. \u201cDon\u2019t open it,\u201d he said, and the boy said, \u201cI know,\u201d in a tone that made him think maybe this one would stay.\n\nHe waited until the boy brought it up, and in the ten minutes that took he looked again at the map he had built from other maps, and he placed the abattoir on it like a chess piece moving himself into a corner with a kind of terrible grace. He did not say the word field aloud because he had decided he would ration himself. He opened the letter with Patel watching because that had become their ritual in a day and the body is quick to grow fond of rituals that make you less alone with the worst bits of you. The note had only one line and it was not a line. It was a string of coordinates, grid references stepping like a hopscotch across the town in a shape so stupidly obvious he wanted to call himself names for having the reaction he had. He laid a bit of tracing paper over the map because he still knew how to do that with his hands despite every app making him lazy. He marked the points and then he connected them and then he didn\u2019t need to connect them because he could suddenly see it. The shape did not represent an arrow pointing anywhere useful or a heart or a cross or any of the god-baiting figures men draw when they want to be clever. It was a circle, of course it was, but not perfect; a circle that had been made by a man walking and letting the land knock his shoulder and bend his elbow and make the loop imperfect enough that it looked like a hand-drawn forgiveness.\n\nHe stood with both palms on the table in the room that had been his and would be another\u2019s and he said, only to the air because he had been taught not to grandstand in front of women who know better, \u201cHe\u2019s going to make us go round until we are dizzy.\u201d Patel said \u201cOr until he is,\u201d which cheered him more than it ought to. He took his hands off the table and put them where he could see them. He thought of the boy who ate ants because boys dare each other when they cannot articulate the thing that scares them and he felt the beginning of something he did not want to call pity. If the field had been a blank when he woke, it was now there all over again, a sullen fact under the skin of the town, and he could no longer tell whether the man with the laugh was trying to keep it buried or dig it out for them all to look at and call by its right name. He pushed his chair back and stood and Patel stood when he did and they went downstairs with the kind of polite haste you learn when you need to look like you are not running towards or away from anything.\n\nBecause he had asked for it, the jar had remained where it had been put, and because it had remained, nobody had knocked it, and because nobody had knocked it, a boy had passed in the morning with his dog and asked his father what it was and the father had said he did not know in a tone that had not been tried on that boy yet, and the boy had discovered new respect for his father\u2019s ability to admit ignorance. Because a fox had come in the night and sniffed and found nothing it wanted, the circle of sugar had only softened on one side and hardened on the other where the wind had packed it like a lip. Because men had come back with equipment in marked vans and put on gloves and put tape where tape goes to tell other people not to go where they want to, the jar had looked important enough to make a passer-by think thoughts too large for the place where he lived. There is a chance we call all of this accusation when we write it down later, and a chance we call it context, and the difference will be decided by whose lawyer polishes their vowels prettiest.\n\nWhen it was properly, entirely dark, and the sky had become the kind of bruise you cannot hide with a sleeve, a man stood at the basin where the jar sat and he did not touch anything with his hands. He stood the way a man stands in a church when he has slept with his friend\u2019s wife and is pretending to pray. He laughed once, very quietly, because the night had the courtesy to make sounds private, and he put his head on one side and listened to whether his laugh had hit the same point on the underside of heaven as it had earlier. He waited until his breathing had slowed to the hymn he knew, and then he turned away and walked the direction the map he had drawn would have sent him, and as he walked he counted his steps, not because the number mattered but because counting has always been a way to keep the wolves back. When he reached the gate at the field he did what he had not done for a long time; he put his hand on the post and he stood still, and he did not laugh, and in the cold, the small silence that rose in him felt like the first honest thing he had made in years. He took it into his mouth like a sweet and did not crunch it too soon.",

He woke before his alarm and lay measuring the edges of himself in the dark, that old police trick of taking stock without calling it fear, then sat up and let the cold find its usual doors. The map of the circle lay where he had left it, anchored under a cup with a chip that he could not bring himself to throw away, and he moved the cup and felt the small disloyalty of leaving coffee rings on a grid. He told himself he would not go back to the basin until daylight because there was nothing to be got in the night except a feeling, and those were cheaper than they looked, and then he pulled on his boots and went anyway, because he was no longer pretending to tell his body what to do. Out there the ground had taken frost like a veil and the jar wore it prettily on its rim, and his breath did the old dragon trick without making anyone laugh. He stood with his hands where he could see them and felt watched by nothing that was not him, and the quiet that rose in his chest had the decency to feel earned.\n\nPatel had seen the mark on the evidence ledger before he told her to look for it, and she brought it to him with the patience of someone who will let you arrive at your own conclusions and not charge you extra for taking the scenic route. The ledger had a neat line scored through a time in a hand nobody owned, and the witness camera had obliged by showing them the square of its ignorance at exactly the right minute. Lorna Haye from Scenes of Crime arrived half an hour into the day with a mouth already going because she had come from another job that had not been spicy enough to untie her tongue, and she swore quietly about the adhesive residue on the jar lip as if glue had personally offended her. \u201cCheapest tape,\u201d she said, holding up a strip to the light so its bubbles showed like fish. \u201cCorner shop. Half the town stocks it and half the men who stock it talk to each other about weather and never about why anyone might need tape at two in the morning.\u201d He liked Lorna because she did not pretend her evidence was a sword; it was a sieve and she told him so, and he respected people who loved their tools enough to disparage them. She sniffed where he had sniffed and said \u201cGolden syrup thinned and not very much,\u201d and he tried not to be sad at the idea that even a sweetness had been diluted to make it last.\n\nBruce had not expected the gate to make a sound like that under his hand, not quite a creak, more a settling, like bones clicking back into the place they were meant for. He had the urge to apologize to it, which was stupid even by his standards, and so he let the apology arrive and sit in his throat where nobody could call him on it. He breathed as if instructed by a calmer man and felt the ache that had nested in his sternum relocate by a fraction, which he counted as a win because small distances can be continents when you are being brave. He did not laugh, and the absence pleased and frightened him in equal measure because it left room around the edges and room is where the bad bits can get in if you\u2019re not tidy. The field did not behave, which was only fair; it presented itself not as an event but as someone\u2019s back garden the council had glanced at and then forgotten, all tufts and old wire and a half-remembered footpath the ramblers had traded rumors about and then stopped. He went to the stile and stepped up and down as if practicing the motion might prepare him for anything that came after, then took his hand off the post and wiped his palm on his jeans with a child\u2019s reflex that he could not teach out of himself. He thought of her saying not in the house, and for a second the line had the exact grammar of a blessing, and then the second was over and he was just a man in a coat on a morning with breath he could watch.\n\nMonty turned out to be Martin, and Martin turned out to be the sort of dog that sat because he had taught himself sitting was the trick that made people look at him kind. Darren Peake had the manner of a bloke who apologizes to appliances when they fail, which positioned him neatly in the middle of a Venn diagram of men Cassidy trusted and men he suspected would lie for the right reason. \u201cI don\u2019t come up here much,\u201d Darren said as they stood facing across the lip of the basin as if haggling with the land, \u201cnot for years, not since they started putting bins in the lay-by and the kids tipped them over for sport.\u201d Cassidy asked him to describe the laughing again and Darren did, carefully, as if the will itself sat on the tongue and might be too slippery to catch twice. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t mine,\u201d he said, and looked embarrassed at having made a line that dramatic by accident. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t someone else\u2019s either. It was as if the place had made the noise and I got caught under it. And then Marty went for it,\u201d he added, which made the dog lift his head with a hopefulness that broke the heart a little. Cassidy held out his hand and the dog did him the grace of not pretending to be charmed, and in return he did the dog the favor of not trying again too hard. He thanked Darren for coming out a second time and did not take his details again because the man was not a suspect, he was a witness to a feeling, and that is hard enough to live with without your postcode attached.\n\nBy noon the press had been fed just enough to make them string the right words into wrong shapes, and he watched the town\u2019s name march along the bottom of the news with its vowels in the wrong order, which is how news always looks when it is about where you live. He sat in the little room that had tried to be a canteen and become a cupboard for a microwave and a kettle and three mugs with their handles mended, and he let a voicemail from his publisher listen to itself. \u201cOnly if you\u2019ve time, Tom,\u201d it said in a cheery tone that had to have been written down first, \u201cand if this case is taking you away then that\u2019s a story in itself,\u201d and he wanted to text a photograph of a jam jar that reflected nothing and say: there is your story, you boil it until it clouds. Patel slid onto the chair opposite his without asking and put a biscuit on his napkin and told him about a kid she\u2019d once had to talk down from a roof by teaching him how to breathe backwards, and he was grateful for the way her stories arrived in a tone that invited you to stand beside them rather than under them. They agreed not to use the word manifesto in front of the cameras because it granted too much dignity to a set of notes that were, so far, no more than choreographies for a walk. He admitted he hated the nicknames the internet had already offered, because putting a picture on a monster makes him easier to swallow, and she admitted she had laughed at one of them and felt stupid after. They were both allowed to be human in the cupboard, and when they stood up they put it away in the place where you keep a spare jumper you hope you won\u2019t need.\n\nHe met the boy on his street when he went out to buy milk he would not drink, one of those lads who had learned to put their shoulders forward as if carrying a weight they hadn\u2019t been invited to lift. The boy had a plastic tub full of mouse-sized chocolates priced too high, and Bruce bought two because you always buy two, and he ate one in front of the boy in case the boy had been instructed not to trust the exchanges of men who keep sweets for later. \u201cYou the one with the ants,\u201d the boy asked with a scientist\u2019s curiosity, and Bruce laughed without meaning to and then stalled it as if putting a hand on a child\u2019s bicycle seat. \u201cI\u2019ve got a bit of a problem with the sugar,\u201d he said, which was almost true and therefore almost respectable. The boy nodded as if a sugar problem was a thing on a list that men had. \u201cMy mum says if you put cinnamon down they won\u2019t cross it,\u201d he offered, and Bruce said thank you with a sincere gratitude that surprised him because sincerity felt dangerous. He took the cinnamon to mean: there are lines you can draw that are gentle and work, and he tucked that away alongside the list of things he swore he would not use. When the boy left he put the second chocolate in his pocket and forgot it, and the brown wet circle it made on his thigh later felt like a small wound that had been nothing but a sweet a few hours before.\n\nLorna brought him a report that said nothing and managed to make that useful, the way good reports do when they refuse to plump themselves up with words. The sugar had been syrup cut with tap water and the tap water had been no particular tap; the lids had been handled with hands that had recently been washed and dried on a towel that had lint enough to assume a busy house. There were no prints that would hold up past the first mention of a glove, and the shoe marks were the same as yesterday\u2019s shoe marks, which meant he had been danced here and the step had been meant to sting as a repeat. \u201cHe\u2019s all kitchen,\u201d Lorna said with the fond malice of someone who will happily mock your palette while praising your knife work. \u201cAll domestic. If he goes big it will have to be by using smalls a lot.\u201d He heard a shape in that and put it aside because if he looked directly at it he might make a speech about men who graduate from a trick to a system and call it salvation, and he had promised himself he wouldn\u2019t get preachy on a Tuesday. He asked for a list of shops that sold that tape and she sighed the sigh of a woman who would make him his list and then need to watch him misread it, and for a second his chest hurt with love for his team which he would never say out loud to any of them unless they were hurt or drunk.\n\nThe woman at the charity shop took the mug he had bought and put it in the window next to a crocheted blanket the color of old parsnips and a clock that had stopped at a reasonable time of day. He did not like to imagine them touching his parcel after he left, not because of fingerprints or suspicion, but because he didn\u2019t want to be rude where people had already given things away. He crossed the street with the new lightness of a job done in plain sight and felt a brief dangerous happiness at how easily the town let you place one object near another without complaint. He turned the corner and made a right when the note would have made him left just to remind himself he could, then corrected because disobedience for its own sake is a kind of posing. The abattoir\u2019s side street had the smell you do not forget even years after the knives are put away, not blood exactly but iron and a kind of fat that never left the pores of the bricks, and he had the decency to stop and give a moment to the animals because the animals had had no use for his decency when they were alive. He placed the jar and he placed the circle and he placed the nothing, and when he walked away he did it without looking back, because the only thing worse than being a man who checks his work is being a man who enjoys the checking.\n\nThe map in his pocket told him they were being moved around the rim of the thing that mattered, and he resented it because he was susceptible to politeness and thus susceptible to patterns that disguised themselves as courtesy. On Moor View Terrace a woman watering a rectangle of gravel with a hose because muscle memory makes you commit to the wrong tool even when the job has changed, looked up and saw his hands turned over and gave him the nod of someone who has had to talk themselves through something ridiculous to keep themselves steady. He did the co-op and the alley and the lamppost as instructed and discovered the definite pleasure in following a rule that did not belong to the law, which frightened him enough that he began, silently, to add his own rule above each: if he says left, assume somebody is waiting behind right; if he says laugh, let the sound hit your teeth before your throat; if he says don\u2019t be clever, find the clever and lead it somewhere else. Patel matched his pace and whistled tunelessly through her teeth because there are only so many silences you can stand before you need to find a sound that doesn\u2019t belong to the town. They stopped by the chain-link fence that was sagging under the weight of ivy and read a note that said: Remember the field is a field, not a library, and he wanted very much to put his fist through something gentle and then did not, which was a better trick anyway.\n\nHe had decided to stop leaving anything that smelt like sugar on his kitchen counters, which meant he had moved the problem and not solved it, which, to be fair, was a tactic that served a lot of people very well. He took the cinnamon the boy had recommended and laid a thin line under the skirting board and watched the first ant hesitate and turn in the way that made his chest ache with low, weird pride. He had no right to pride in this, but if men only took pride in what they had rights to, the rooms would be quieter and his life had taught him that silence is not always benevolent. He boiled eggs and surrounded the pan with a fortress of teaspoons he did not need, and ate them with good behavior, which was to say he scraped the plate clean because leaving any yellow behind meant you would see it again later in the bin and he wanted mercy from his own eyes. He sat and looked at the photograph he had promised himself not to look at and said the word hello three times in the way you say it when a box is opened and a thing inside it that you did not order looks up and turns out not to be harmful. He wrote and crossed out and wrote and crossed out and in the crossings he saw the old schoolboy who had learned early that you can practice sincerity until it is indistinguishable from the real thing. When he folded the letter and slid it into its cheap plastic skin he did not think of any man, and then he did, and then he laughed softly because being made of contradictions is only ugly if you uncross your arms about it.\n\nThe jar at the abattoir sat and did nothing and had an audience, which is one of the few honest positions for an object in a town. A caretaker from the warehouse next door came out for a smoke and looked at it and made a face that was almost prayer without committing to a god, and two girls in school skirts that had been hemmed without maternal permission photographed it sideways as if the angle would explain anything. Cassidy parked two streets away because the habit of arriving without a flag had been beaten into him by a decade and a half of people who lied best when you told them you were a policeman too early. He walked the long route around the back because he refused to oblige anything that wanted him to be a straight line, and when he saw the circle and the jar he had the sick relief of a prediction that had come true. He told Scenes to do what Scenes does and he stood back and stared at the brick where the fat had leached and thought, unwillingly, of hands, and then he did as he had been told and looked at them again. He did not like what he felt, which was something curiously close to prayer without a subject, and he put that away quickly because it would unman him if he let it sit. He recognized the pattern beginning to evolve from gesture into grammar and he did what he always did when men got fluent at their sins; he pulled other people in and made their voices lay over his like gauze.\n\nHe did not knock at her door that evening because he had the mercy to believe her when she had told him not to, and he lied by omission to himself about not standing on the pavement opposite for a full minute adjusting his scarf until she came to the window and did not see him. His mother rang and he let her, which counts for something, and he stood in the tiny back yard that the estate agent had once called a garden and listened to the sound the bricks made when the cold started to set properly. \u201cYou eat,\u201d she said, without preamble and with love so naked it would have been obscene if it hadn\u2019t been so long-standing, and he told her about stew in a tone that was receipt not confession. She asked him a question about the book that sounded like a question about him, and he told her he would write in the morning and put as much truth into the sentence as it could hold, which was not very much but not nothing. When he went back inside he found the envelope under his door as if the town had practiced this move on other men and got the knack. The flap had been sealed with that cheap tape and his name had been written in a hand that knew exactly how hard you had to press to make ink look like insistence. He took it for granted that this was orchestrated and he loathed himself mildly for the thrill, which is as honest as he gets about these things.\n\nHe opened it with the carefulness he had developed in the years of not letting his curiosity damage his job, and found inside a thing that made the lines he had drawn on his map look like practice. It was not a letter in the way the other letters were letters; it was a timetable, with times that matched the rhythm of somebody\u2019s day who ate when the radio news spoke and walked when the town took its break and stopped when the school bell went twice quickly. There were small instructions that had the seduction of being practical\u2014bring a torch that won\u2019t mind rain; wear shoes that forgive mud; do not tell the boy on the desk your real smile\u2014and at the bottom a sentence he read twice because he wanted it to be written by somebody else. It said: We are not going to the field, not yet, we are going to its shadow, which is kinder and therefore worse. He folded the paper into his pocket and did not sit down because sitting would mean admitting that he was winding himself prettily to a man\u2019s tune, and he had not liked waltzes even at the wedding he had chosen not to drink at.\n\nHe had learned to walk between lamplight as a boy because his father had told him light is where you get counted, and he was very good at not being a number. He moved through the estate in a way that kept him one step ahead of easy descriptions and at each of the corners he had chosen to be a stage he set down a token that would be both a clue to one man and a kindness to nobody. At the precinct he put a circle of coins that added up to nothing under the bench where the old men played at not needing each other and sat until the cold turned his knees into instruments he did not read music for. At the underpass he chalked a laugh onto the wall and when a boy riding too fast asked him what it was he said \u201cA cloud,\u201d and the boy said \u201cLiar,\u201d with a bright friendliness he had not earned. At the garage he pressed his finger to the oil slick until it took his whorl and then wiped it on his jeans because you should never leave your pattern on something that belongs to a place like that. He liked the shape the evening was taking and this admission made him want to be punished, which was both an old hunger and a new one. When he got home he put the ant under the glass again because he had run out of saints to press between the pages of the book of his day and he needed the company of something small that obeyed.\n\nThe shadow of the field was not the alley that ran parallel to it or the old wall or the ditch that filled when the drains sulked; the shadow of the field was the people who did not say its name even in their heads. He knocked on a door he had known he would knock on since his second step that morning and the woman who opened it pressed her palms together because sometimes you pray not to God but to an incoming conversation. She was the one who had found the shoe that time and had not called it a shoe until a policeman told her it was, and she had kept her gaze on the laces the entire interview because looking at the leather would have made it true beyond the capacity of the body. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to say it,\u201d he told her now on her step with the expression he used for people who did not owe him anything, \u201cwe\u2019re going to measure it and then you can throw it away again,\u201d and she smiled with one side of her mouth because she had learned to regulate her kindness the way you regulate the oven when you have to bake and you know your cooker runs hot. She told him about the boys with their bottle rockets and the man with his drone and the woman who stood at the stile and did not climb it because standing was a climb that day, and he listened until he could lay her words on his map like a lace that made the paper feel less cheap. When he left she shut the door very gently and he loved her for not lending the day any more noise than it already got.\n\nNight put its hands on the town like a big brother who meant well and didn\u2019t know his own weight, and they set the van where the van goes when you are trying to be invisible and only manage to look like a van. The young ones took first watch because the young ones always do until their eyes learn to hurt, and Patel sat with them for an hour and told a story that had the common decency to be funny enough to be worth the third retelling. Cassidy walked the perimeter of a building he knew too well and tried to recognize the bits of himself that wanted to look good in a report and told them to go and take the night off. He thought, not for the first time, about a boy he had had in custody once who had cried because he had said I\u2019m sorry to the wrong person in the wrong tone and had not been forgiven, and he wondered if tone was the only thing between men and their worst selves. When the jar did not move and then did and then pretended it had not, he felt rather than saw the adjustment in his team, the shift of bodies that says somebody has written a line and we are going to try to read it out loud together without stammering. The hedge breathed and gave up nothing but a bird that would have been called a blackbird if anyone had carried that word in their pocket at that hour, and the cameras stared with their blank good nature at the path that no one would choose if they wanted to be seen.\n\nHe walked past his own door twice not because he was afraid of what would be behind it but because fear is an old game his body liked to play when the stakes were high. The envelope he had left on the table that morning had swaggered in his absence and made itself look important in a way letters will when they realize they are the only ones at home. He opened it and found inside a photocopy of a page from a book about laughter that he had once seen in a college library and not checked out because he had been busy building a self that didn\u2019t use citations. The margin had a note in a tidy hand: Laughter as anesthetic vs. laughter as incision, and he read the words aloud because hearing them made them stay. He did not sleep. He lay with the lights off and looked at the line where the ceiling met the wall and imagined his coordinates written up there and then, for no good reason, he burst out laughing in the tiniest laugh he had, a rabbit\u2019s laugh, and he put his fist over his mouth as if somebody could hear him in the next street. He was not forgiven. That was not the point.\n\nWhen the morning brought its mean little brightness to the edges of the window frame, the jar at the basin looked less like a trick and more like a decision, and that, he thought, was always going to be the danger: turning a man\u2019s ritual into an altar because you had looked at it too long. He met Patel at the van with tea that had been made too strong on purpose and told her about the timetable, and she blew on her cup and told him that people who invite you to be punctual at their madness always hope you will save them from themselves by being five minutes late. They plotted the day like a picnic no one would enjoy and he sent two rookies to hold the corner by the abattoir with orders to look like idiots and think like thieves. He reminded himself to call his mother and to use the tone that made her not worry until the tone wore off, which took exact minutes he could count. He checked the map and the dotted circle and the shadow, and he thought of a story he had been told once about a farmer who walked the perimeter of his field every morning and wore a track into the earth not because he liked the view but because he needed to know his fences were still his fences, and he wished to God the man they were following had the same smallness in him instead of this insistence on being understood.\n\nHe put on his coat and drew his breath in and moved, and the town did the thing towns do when you treat them like a page and write your name on them without asking, which is they hum a little through their bricks as if getting ready to forgive you after and then, if you\u2019re lucky, actually doing it. He walked until his knees reminded him he was not a young policeman anymore and walked after that because he was too stubborn to let his knees have the last line. He would admit it later in the part of his brain that wrote the book he wasn\u2019t writing, that he had been excited that day, and he would make it clean on paper so he could close the page and live, and he would hope no one he loved saw him do it. He had the shape of a circle and the shadow of the field and the twist of a mind like a wire in his pocket, and he had the laugh he was keeping in his throat because he was saving it for the right place. He told himself that right places exist on some days, even for men who use the wrong voice at the wrong time, and the lie was so good he nearly believed it long enough to be comforted. He did not look up. He did not look down. He put each foot in front of the other and trusted that if he fell, he would fall in a pattern he could live with.\n\nBruce had dreamed of a sink once years ago, and the sink had been as large as his mother\u2019s kitchen, and his father had been in it, a small figure trying to climb the side as the sugar water rose, and he had woken himself with a laugh and had not told anyone because it was not the kind of thing that wins you a nickname you can live under. He did not dream now. He sat awake and examined the air for the sound it made before he laughed and thought, not for the first time, that if he could meet the man with the white-down-the-middle hair he would ask him not about the field but about the way he managed to keep a job and a face on at the same time. He practiced saying I\u2019m sorry to an empty room and admired how well he did it as a piece of theatre and loathed himself as soon as the admiration crept in as if a mouse had made a nest in the lining of his coat. He stood and did the boots and the lace twice and then the extra loop that made him feel looked after by his own hands, and he went out into a morning the color of cigarette paper. He had a pocketful of things that meant nothing to ordinary eyes and too much to his own, and he had a schedule he intended to keep with the zeal of a convert who knows he is late to the religion. He smiled into a window that gave him back a man he had never intended to get to know and kept walking, and if the field rose to his right he did not look, and if the town breathed behind him he did not flinch, and if the day put its thumb on his throat he laughed and swallowed and went on, good boy.",

It had the steady politeness of bus times but without the anchoring comfort of a destination printed in fat letters on the front. Patel drove because she had the better patience for junctions, and when they stopped she made a note on a card rather than on the map to keep the act of writing from feeling like prophecy. They started at the bowling green that was no longer green but an ankle-twisting scab of hard mud where men still came to suck at cigarettes and complain about the council as if the council lived under their nails. A small paper bag had been tucked neatly under the lip of the old scoreboard and inside there was nothing more than a twist of thread and a fleck of white that might have been sugar or salt or flaked paint. \u201cHe\u2019s underfeeding us today,\u201d Patel said, and he agreed, because it was a day for small measures and the taste of denial was in the air like damp.\n\nThe woman in the red coat was on the far side of the fence and he recognized her not by the coat, which could be anyone\u2019s story, but by the way she arranged her hands as if asking them to behave. She was looking at the bowling shed, not at him, but when he turned to see if she would register him she smiled with enough restraint to signal that she was playing fair, and he found himself smiling back with an equally rationed honesty. \u201cYou\u2019ll make us famous,\u201d she said with no accusation in it, just the weary amusement of someone who had learned fame meant cameras where you buy your bread. He thought about telling her that fame came to towns at a cost they didn\u2019t get to set and then he didn\u2019t say it because he had promised himself to stop making speeches to strangers. \u201cWe\u2019re trying not to,\u201d he said instead, and she nodded, as if that was the answer she had hoped for, and turned away with a neatness that made him like her more.\n\nThey went from the green to the cut-through behind the parade of shops where last night\u2019s takeaway had oiled the pavement into treachery. A chalk arrow had been drawn at ankle height where anyone over ten would miss it, and the chalk had already taken on the grey fuzz of the day. It pointed not to the warren of garages where boys broke bikes into pieces and called it learning, but to the narrow wedge of grass between wall and kerb that had acquired the dignity of having been mown; in the middle of the wedge sat a jam jar with nothing in it but a single bubble, trapped like a thought too small to admit. Lorna arrived with her box before he could talk himself into reverence for the bubble. She crouched with a practical grunt and said something soft to the jar like a nurse coaxing a child to show a bruise, and he felt grateful for the way her attention unmagicked objects without disrespecting them. \u201cYou\u2019ll forgive me when I say this is beginning to be boring,\u201d she murmured, and he gave her the kind of look that meant he was counting on her to be bored enough to see what he had missed.\n\nAt the corner shop on Hathersage Road they bought tape without buying tape, which was to say Patel stood and listened to the owner tell them about the weather for four straight minutes and then, with the casual genius of a woman who had once survived two aunts and a church committee, slid a question under his story like a hand into a pocket. He told them about the man with the laugh that had been too loud for half-eight and the way he had held the banknotes by the very edges as if they were wet. \u201cHe had a cut on his hand,\u201d the owner said, gesturing to the soft part of his own palm, \u201ca little crescent, like he\u2019d argued with a tin and lost, and he said sorry before I\u2019d even looked to see if he\u2019d dropped anything.\u201d Cassidy thanked him and did not try to make the memory do more work than it wanted to. On the step of the shop a boy with a nose that had just decided to grow into his face was drawing an ant with a marker pen on the pavement, fat head, stick legs, a grin that was an accident. \u201cThey bite,\u201d the boy informed him, and then added, very seriously, \u201conly if you stand on their house,\u201d and he said, \u201cFair,\u201d and thought of circles and jars until his chest hurt.\n\nThe map sent them to the library, which gave him the kind of home-sadness he only ever admitted to when he smelled floor polish and old paper living together. The woman at the desk had a cardigan the color of rain clouds and a way of taking a breath that asked you to make your question worth the oxygen, and he showed her his warrant card not because he needed to but because he liked the way her mouth softened when she saw it. The book with the underlining about edible plants sat on a trolley as if it had refused to be reshelved; inside, where yesterday\u2019s hand had circled a picture of chickweed with scholar\u2019s fervor, a folded square of paper had been placed like a translation. It was a photocopy of a map section with nothing marked on it at all, but as he stared he realized the absence was the point; the field, a blank the color of the paper behind the ink, had been left unprinted by a machine that should have filled it, and he felt a silly little thrill at the idea that machines also knew how to let a space be a space. Patel tapped the margin where someone, in that fussy neat hand, had written: Resist filling.\n\nHe had to go to the station to do the thing he hated, which was to stand in front of cameras and say words about public safety that made sense and didn\u2019t give away the parts of a story that would sink the tale before it got legs. The internet had done its usual quick dirty job of naming the shape of the man he was being asked to read, and he needed to say he didn\u2019t like the names without looking like an old bloke scolding children. Patel stood next to him like a quiet metronome and he felt himself speaking to her instead of to the microphones, which was one of his better tricks when he remembered it. He said they were aware of the placements and that nobody had been harmed and that the objects were being handled appropriately and he did not say ants because he had worked out the word itself did a stupid thing to faces. A reporter with hair so glossy it could have been sent to a lab asked him whether he thought the perpetrator was trying to \u201ccommunicate a trauma,\u201d and he stood still instead of saying what he wanted to, which was, show me a person who isn\u2019t.\n\nHe pushed the timetable around the afternoon like peas on a plate and found himself late to a small appointment he had not admitted even to Patel. The woman in the house the color of bread opened before his knuckles could steal a second knock, and this time he did not perform his hands; he kept them at his sides like a pupil remembering himself. \u201cYou again,\u201d she said, with the little rise at the end that let him put his own tone in the gap. He told her about the timetable and the map that resisted being filled and the boy\u2019s ant and she listened the way she had always listened, even when she had told him she was done, and when he stopped she nodded as if to say not bad, and he had to fight down the appalling urge to ask if he was doing well. \u201cHe came here once,\u201d she said, and he did not ask who because they were done pretending there were multiple he\u2019s in this conversation, \u201cand he laughed in the corridor because he thought the echo was kind. I think he has always wanted sound to be kind. Kindness is not its job.\u201d He wanted to say I know, and he wanted to say I don\u2019t, and in the end he kissed the air between them with a thank you he did not speak.\n\nBruce had been to the corner shop and bought the cheap tape because he liked the thing it did to the skin of his hands, the way it pulled at him just enough to remind him of his edges without taking anything. He had left a coin on the counter that was slightly too big for the amount and had waited to be told off as if he were a boy seeking proof of borders, and when none came he laughed in a way that tried to be an apology. Back at the table the jars had taken on the serious aspect of instruments in an orchestra pit; he liked them in ranks though he distrusted what that said about him. He had tried the cinnamon, twice, and watched with an odd ache as the ants turned away with obedience that looked like grief if you squinted, and he had a moment of furious tenderness for a child he had never made. He left the cinnamon in a line on the doorstep as if it could keep the world out of his house while letting the air in, and when he stepped over it he did it with the respect of a man who had invented something he wished he\u2019d been taught.\n\nHe went to see Joel because he had decided it would count as penance, and because Joel had once been his friend at a time when friends are chosen for you by geography and a shortage of chairs. Joel ran a unit that fixed phones and sold glass screens you could satisfyingly peel a film off, and when Bruce stepped in he felt the judder in his chest he associated with nostalgia and guilt, which were cousins in his body. \u201cWell,\u201d Joel said, putting his palms on the counter like a man who had sworn to always touch wood before saying something that might break, \u201clook who still walks like he expects the place to tip.\u201d Bruce laughed softly because saying you\u2019re not wrong would have been crueler; he asked after Joel\u2019s wife and Joel used her maiden name like he always had, and in the gap Bruce felt as if someone had lifted a lid off his head and checked the contents. \u201cYou hear from her?\u201d Joel asked, a question tossed with the casual malice of old intimacy, and Bruce said he brought a photograph back and watched Joel\u2019s mouth do the small leap that meant he would not tease after all. \u201cYou doing your weird thing still?\u201d Joel said in a voice that tried to laugh before Bruce did, and for the first time in a long while Bruce did not rise to the stage. \u201cTrying not to,\u201d he said, and they both let that sit between the phone cases and the lanyards and the memory of the field without naming any of it.\n\nLorna\u2019s list of tape sellers narrowed things in that way that frustrates and comforts at once, because a narrower circle is still a circle until it isn\u2019t. They went to the second on the page because the first had already given them the laugh story and one story a morning was his measure. The man at the counter in the second had the consuming kind of beard that attempted to make a personality and he spoke like he believed he was himself a cautionary tale. Patel used a new tone, all praise and no threat, and he brought out a sheaf of receipts because men who stock things love an audience for their stockrooms even when the stock is stickers and string. They found a sale at nine-thirty the morning of the first jar, cash, a roll of tape, a packet of napkins printed with small leaves that Bruce would never have bought if anyone were watching, and golden syrup. \u201cHe asked if we had honey and when I said no he said, \u2018Not that sort of sweetness then,\u2019\u201d the man reported, his eyes satisfied at having been helpful, and Cassidy nodded and hoped the sentence would behave when he repeated it later to his own head.\n\nThe town had started to perform being watched, which meant people enacted their own decent version of themselves on corners and handed it to him, which was generous and odd and made him tired. A lad on a scooter slowed conspicuously when he saw tape and then sped up like he had only just remembered being a teenager; a man in a van put his arm out the window and waved at nobody because waving is contagious; a woman pushed a pram with one hand and held a phone to her ear with the other and said \u201cYeah, the ant thing,\u201d in a voice that could have been incredulous or hungry. He wished for the comfort of a fight and then caught himself wishing it and felt ashamed, because men like him are given too many fights for free. Patel watched a gull bully a smaller gull off a bin with the clean attention of a person who refuses to attribute morals to birds, and he thought, not for the first time, that she saved him from writing sins into everything.\n\nAt three they followed the timetable to the undercroft of the old college where the theatre students had once painted the walls black and learned to smoke in elegant arcs. There was a circle there\u2014of course there was\u2014made with flour this time, poor man\u2019s chalk, and the gusts had softened it into an edible fog. In the middle, a jar had its lid screwed tight for the first time and in it there hung a fishing float, red and white, not submerged because there was no water, just a trinket suspended as if in a bad dream version of buoyancy. A note on the underside of the lid, written with that insistent tidy hand, said: One of us had to learn the wrong tool. He felt the old itch to take offence at the pronoun and then breathed it out, because he had been a person\u2019s \u201cus\u201d when it had not been his to wear, and he would rather sit in that embarrassment than pretend none of this was touching him.\n\nHe brought the jar back very carefully and asked Lorna to see whether the glue residue on the lid was the same as the rest and she said she would and told him, by way of payment for making her do repetition, the story of her first boyfriend who had insisted they\u2019d never need more than three knives in a kitchen and how she had left him in the aisle of a shop because she had watched a woman come in to buy seven. He laughed, properly and entirely his own, and the relief of it made his eyes water, which made Patel pass him a tissue like a mother at a school play without remark. He made tea he knew nobody would love because he liked to practice being mediocre in private, and he took his mug to the little window that looked onto a wall and made himself look anyway as if the wall might unexpectedly offer a view. When the front desk called up to say there was a package addressed to him he did not sigh, which was the best he could manage.\n\nThe package was an ant farm of the cheap sort that made parents sigh even as they handed over the notes at Christmas. The plastic had been scoured clean and the sand had been dyed a disreputable blue that made him think of those drinks kids carry on buses. The colony inside it was real and moderately healthy and had a small smear of syrup pressed against one of the corners, and he felt his stomach turn at the thought of someone shepherding these in and out of a post office. There was a sticker on the back with a smiley face on it, the kind schools put on homework when the work had been close but not quite, and under it a note that read: Do not call this cruelty out loud, because that would be a lie, but do not call it mercy either. He put the box down and looked at Patel and she looked back and they did not talk for the length of time it takes a kettle to think about boiling. He carried the farm to Lorna with hands that he kept steady because he had done this before with other boxes and he wanted to give the ants the courtesy of a calm that had been denied to bigger suffering.\n\nIn the evening his mother fed him on a shoulder of pork that had been cooked so slowly he could have cried, and he did not tell her about jars or fields or maps but he told her a story about a gull that had bullied another gull and she told him she had always preferred pigeons because they seemed to be doing their best. He washed up and she dried like they had when his father had still been a door at the end of the hall and not a missing word at the end of a sentence, and he was almost happy because there are moments in most days where the body does you the kindness of forgetting you have another job. The envelope under his door when he got home was less of a surprise for having been inevitable, and he sat on the bottom step with his coat still on and opened it because he wanted, perversely, to do something thoughtless and make it good by the thought that followed. Inside was a polaroid of the jar at the basin under the sky, the rim of it furred with frost, and over the picture someone had written: Some of us are trying to be good. He stood and stood until his knees complained and then he folded the picture and put it into his wallet behind his warrant card and he told himself he would not interpret that act in any way at all.\n\nBruce had walked the shadow so long that day he felt he had worn his name into it, which would have made him ashamed if names were not the things he distrusted most after forgiveness. He had gone to the underpass and rubbed out his chalk cloud and drawn a different one and watched a girl with a pram nod at him like an adult nodding at a child pretending to be a shopkeeper, and the tenderness of it had nearly knocked him off his feet. He took the timetable he had made and scored through two times because he had let himself miss them, which meant he could punish himself with the neatness of the line and not the content of the day, and he laughed softly at his own thrift. At the abattoir he stood and said hello out loud to the bacteria because something in him insisted on manners where there had been none, and at the basin he stood with his hands behind his back like a schoolboy and did not move until he had had the thought he had come for. It was not a noble thought. It was this: if you teach a man to walk in circles, he will call it a pilgrimage if it keeps him from falling down.\n\nThe woman in the red coat came to the station again not because she had anything to add but because looking at the board of notices made her think of order and order had always been her hobby. She had the face of someone who could tell you how to sew a hem and where to stand in a church to avoid being photographed in the wrong light and she stared at the actors\u2019 call for extras for a panto as if it were an answer to a question she hadn\u2019t wanted to ask. The boy on the desk, the one with the inner calm that had made Cassidy briefly hopeful for the future of uniforms, offered her a chair and she thanked him and did not sit. When she left he wrote down her registration as if registering things made them safer and then rubbed it out because you should not write down the movements of people who are only trying to keep their heads above water by reading small words pinned to cork. He did not mention it to Cassidy, which was wise because Cassidy already carried too many harmless facts like pebbles in his pocket for luck.\n\nBy the time the dark had fully fallen, the jar under the abattoir\u2019s tilt had been replaced with another of the same width and shape and nothing inside at all, and Lorna swore because emptiness is harder to test than anything. \u201cHe\u2019s testing whether we\u2019re testing,\u201d she said, which sounded like a riddle that had lost its nerve, and Patel nodded and wrote a line on her card that consisted of an arrow and a circle and then a little square, which he knew meant stop trying to be a poet and get some sleep. He went home, because even men who are trying their best at being relentless go home at some point, and he put his coat over the back of a chair and it slid to the floor in a way that made him feel suddenly tired of objects that refused to hold on. He sat and meant to write one sentence that would at least be the first brick in the wall of the chapter he had promised and he wrote instead the name of a girl he had said he would not write and then he deleted it because he did not own any part of her and because naming is a violence when you are not sure of your right to the name.\n\nHe slept badly and woke early and would have made himself a list of the day if lists hadn\u2019t begun to feel like a man\u2019s idea of control rather than control itself. He checked his phone and ignored the paper that had wanted to put his picture next to a jar as if the pairing were a romance, and he ignored the message from the publisher that had learned how to be gently urgent, and he walked the map in his head one more time to make sure he could still buy milk without walking into a moment. At the basin the frost had lifted its fingers and the jar looked naked and ordinary, and for a second he felt such a mad, disloyal urge to kiss the glass for having behaved itself that he put both hands in his pockets and looked up at the sky and counted to twelve. Patel came up beside him without making the sound that boots usually make and stood and then left again because there are days when companionship is a kind of silence you take in shifts.\n\nOn the far side of the town, in a kitchen where the ants had learned the cinnamon line without being taught, Bruce boiled eggs and ate the yolks deliberately, which for him felt like the kind of heroism that goes unrewarded for obvious reasons. He stood at the sink and put his finger into the rim and then took it out and laughed very, very quietly at himself because there was nothing in the rim to find and not finding something had never stopped him pretending. The photograph lay on the table under a glass, not to protect it but to dignify it, and he lifted the glass and put it down again like a man practicing a trick he would never perform in front of anybody. He put on his boots and laced them and laced them again and then did not do the extra loop, and this, he told himself, was proof of nothing except that superstition can be moved and will move back if you let it. He touched the place on his thigh where the melted chocolate had made a dark petal the day before and found nothing but clean denim, and he felt a careful, ridiculous gladness at the smallness of that.\n\nHe stepped out into a town that had learned, over a week, the precise angle it liked to hold its head at when being watched, and he wondered whether it would ever put its head back the way it had been. The boy with the chocolates waved without the chocolates and said the cinnamon had worked for his mum and he took the gift with the gravity of a benediction. He passed the field without looking. He put his tongue against his teeth to hold in the first laugh of the day and managed to turn it into air that went out of his nose in what might in other men have been a sigh. He had the jar and the farmed ants and the thread and the float and the schedule and the shadow of a place where the ground had once made him into an echo, and he told himself that if he kept the route and the rules he could cross something like a river without getting wet at all. It was a childish lie and it lasted just long enough to get him to the first corner, which was all he had asked of it, and he was honest enough, with himself, to call that a victory of sorts, even if it tasted like syrup thinned so it would go further.",

He lay for a while in the bed that had learned the shape of his restlessness and watched the pale rectangle of the blind adjust degree by degree as if someone were lifting it with careful fingers. The timetable from the night before lay open on the chair where his trousers should have been, and he read it across the room as if distance would reduce its claim on him. He told himself he would not let today be choreographed, then admitted that the admission was itself a step, and smiled at his own defeat with the kind of gentleness he reserved for his younger, stupider selves. In the kitchen his mother had left bread out under a tea towel and the smell of it tugged on the part of him that was always a boy in a house that hugged back, so he ate two slices standing up and let the butter do its moral work.\n\nWhen he got to the station Patel had already been through the overnight reports and triaged them into piles that looked identical to anyone who did not know her system. She slid the smallest pile towards him and held it in place with the flat of her hand, and he felt absurdly grateful for the weight. \u201cNo jars moved,\u201d she said, and he nodded because the sentence contained both relief and promise. \u201cOne prank in Newbold, a plastic takeaway tub with \u2018Feed Me\u2019 written on it in eyeliner. The kid\u2019s mum brought him in and told him off in front of us, which was the nicest thing I\u2019ve watched all week.\u201d He laughed, and the laugh lifted something in him that had nothing to do with jars or notes. On the whiteboard in the briefing room he drew a circle without thinking and then rubbed it away because he refused to become the man who represented other men\u2019s obsessions without charging them rent.\n\nThey had Lorna for half the morning before the arson in Hasland yanked her away, and in that time she did what she did best, which was to turn shabby material into information without ever pretending at magic. She had taken apart the ant farm with a delicacy that would have made her a good burglar, and she showed him the burr on the edge of the plastic where someone had pried at it with a butter knife. \u201cHe\u2019s careful until he\u2019s bored,\u201d she said, tapping a fingernail against the seam and setting up a small, satisfying clatter. \u201cThe float? Sold at one of three tackle shops in a ten-mile radius. The thread is cheap cotton, the kind that pills if you think about it.\u201d She laid a strip of tape under the lamp so that the bubbles in it stood out like small, captured planets and raised an eyebrow. \u201cCorner shop glue, like we thought. I\u2019ll say this and then you can ignore it when it suits you: his materials are all made for kitchens and primary schools. If he escalates, it won\u2019t be because he found a new aisle.\u201d\n\nThe tackle shop on Chatsworth Road smelled exactly as it should, a respectable defeat of damp and feathers and oil, and he loved it on sight. The man behind the counter had the glazed cheerfulness of someone who had learned to enjoy repetitive explanations, and when Cassidy showed his card the man did not stop smiling, he simply tuned it to a frequency that said he would be helpful as a default rather than from fear. \u201cFloats like that? Bought two, week before last. He didn\u2019t know what he wanted, which is normal, but he asked questions like he was trying to guess the answers I wanted to give,\u201d the man said, and he demonstrated how a person who has spent a lifetime untangling line does not make a theatrical knot. \u201cPaid cash. Laughed when I told him we sell bait, said \u2018No more mouths in the house,\u2019 then laughed again. He had a neat way with his change, which is rare.\u201d Patel was already leaning to see the screen when he offered to check the cameras, and the angles, predictably, were a hymn to the ceiling, but one showed a pair of hands taking the goods and standing a moment too long at the card tree. Cassidy looked at the video twice, then looked away to let the information stack itself somewhere useful, and he thanked the man with a sincerity that he hoped would feel like payment.\n\nBruce had slept an hour at a time, little dozes that cracked off him like flaking paint, and when he swung his legs out of bed he discovered a gratitude he didn\u2019t trust. The line of cinnamon had held at the skirting and he found a tiny community of ants exploring its edge with what he interpreted as politeness. He stood for a time and did nothing, a practice he had found harder than any of his tricks, and when his body tried to laugh he put the feeling into a cough and felt immediately ridiculous, so he allowed himself a softer sound, a breath with a shape, and called that his medal for the morning. He boiled eggs and ate both yolks as if they were pills prescribed by a doctor he had decided to obey, and when the second stuck in his throat he swallowed around it with a discipline that made him proud in the unlovely way effort makes you. The photograph lay under its glass and he did not touch it, which felt like a kind of fidelity nobody would reward him for, and he left the house with his hands empty and his mouth behaving.\n\nHe went to the church because he had put it on his list of places he had never liked and decided to take things in order. The spire was still wrong in a way that made the whole of him itch, though he admired its refusal to be straight as if it were a man kind enough to make his weakness charming. Inside, a guide gave him a piece of laminated paper with facts on it and a smile that asked him not to run, and he walked the aisle with a seriousness he was trying on for size. He did not like the way his footsteps became other people\u2019s footsteps, and he did not like the smear of wax on the floor where a candle had gone soft in a draught, and he stood for longer than he needed to in front of a stone woman whose face had been rubbed soft by fingers and made himself think of nothing at all. He put a pound in the wooden box because he understood the economy of faith even if he had never been good at the practice, and he left with the peculiar feeling that the building had regarded him and found him too noisy even at his quietest.\n\nCassidy and Patel took the long way to the crooked spire because the map had started to make his feet go where it wanted without asking, and he would not give up small freedoms without charging them. In the square a woman in a high-vis jacket was instructing a line of children on how to be visible in the world, and the sight made him feel obscurely tender and then obscurely sad. He bought a cheap notebook at the newsagent because his pocket had begun to look surly with folded A4 and he wrote three phrases he did not want to forget: resist filling; wrong tool; not yet. Patel watched the page tilt in his hand as if words might leak off the edge, and when he looked up she was already looking away in that deliberate privacy she afforded people when they were doing small, vulnerable things. They stood under the spire and let their necks ache, and he tried, for the space of a minute, to imagine a structural flaw as a kind of public permission to be crooked, then put the thought away because he was not interested in being that indulgent today.\n\nThe woman in the red coat was back at the station before lunch, and this time she brought a jar wrapped in a tea towel like a child. She did not ask for Cassidy by name because she did not have to, and the boy at the desk made the right shape with his face when he saw what she had. \u201cIt was on my step,\u201d she said, and she put the jar down with the care of someone placing a hot dish on a table they do not own. Inside was a ring of water no higher than a fingernail and a scrap of paper pressed to the glass by static, and when he peeled it up with a gloved nail the words were neat and small and infuriatingly polite. Not in the house, it said, and then below it, in parentheses, please. He felt his mouth make a shape that would look like anger to someone across the room and tried to correct it, and the woman watched him with a softness that stopped short of pity. \u201cI know who it is,\u201d she said, and he took the sentence not as an admission but as a burden she had let him see.\n\nThey went to hers together, because there are moments when the containment of the station is a cruelty and you must show yourself in a room that knows a different truth about you. She made tea with the competence of a person who had been taught that hospitality is a muscle you must exercise even when the body is unfit, and he followed her into a kitchen that was a testimony to a woman continually preventing things. The cinnamon line under her back door made his throat hurt with its humble earnestness, and he did not say anything about it because praise would be an insult. She told him what he already knew in bones and did not know in words, a careful braid of memories tied at the top with the sentence I don\u2019t want him punished so much as stopped. He said that stopping did not always arrive without punishment attached, and she looked at him with the brilliant fury of a decent person who has been taught to be reasonable and would like her allowance increased. He left with the jar, empty now, and a sense that his job had to include the invention of softer endings even if the world was not built to hold them.\n\nBruce walked to the tackle shop again because he had liked the smell and because he did not like doing anything only once when he could ruin it with repetition. He stood at the rack of floats and pretended to make a decision he had already made, and when the man behind the counter asked if he wanted help he said no with gratitude that surprised them both. He bought thread he did not need and asked a stupid question about the weight of a thing so slight he barely felt it in his palm, and when the man laughed he laughed too, but he kept the sound below the counter as if a child were sleeping bound for the first time in months. Outside he leaned against the bus stop and watched a woman put coins in one of those charity collections that are designed to make you feel watched, and he envied the ease of her decision. He threw his receipt in the bin and took it out again and folded it into a small square and put it in his pocket like a man saving his own alibi.\n\nThe abattoir held nothing in the afternoon but a smell that had decided to live there whether anyone liked it or not, and he stood at the corner of the loading bay and scanned the neat square of shadow underneath for signs of his own mischief. The jar he had put there had gone, which made him feel bereaved in a way he did not think was allowable, and he was ashamed and then he was not, because shame had begun to feel like vanity. He took a napkin with leaves printed on it from his pocket and put it under a flake of ragged paint as if he were teaching the wall to read, and he walked away with his hands in plain view, which made him feel both chastened and proud. Someone had chalked a hopscotch grid into the road and he avoided it with the superstition of a man who does not want to step into a game he hasn\u2019t been invited to, then deliberately stepped into the last square because he wanted to feel, for half a second, like an eleven-year-old boy who could command a stone.\n\nIn the cupboard that pretended to be a canteen the kettle performed its slow anger and Patel read her messages with a stillness he envied. \u201cThe woman in the red coat?\u201d she said at last, and he nodded because they had agreed not to name her even between themselves. \u201cShe knows him,\u201d Patel said, and he said, \u201cShe knew him,\u201d because tense was a hill he would die on if it meant he could keep the past from dragging too much mud into the room. Patel slid him a biscuit because he had forgotten to bring his own, and he looked at it the way a child looks at a coin they have not earned. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to follow his timetable the next two days,\u201d she said without apology. \u201cThen we stop doing that at all and make our own, because otherwise we become applause.\u201d He agreed, not just because she was right but because the phrase gave him a smug little pleasure he would not voice for fear it ruined the sentence.\n\nIn the mid-afternoon lull when the day pretends to be shorter than it is, a small boy was brought into the station because he had taken a jar off a wall near the college and had decided it was treasure. He had the serene courage of a person whose mother had told him plainly that the world belonged to nobody and to everybody, and he held the jar in both hands like it contained a heat that did not burn. The note in it, folded once and then once again, had a single word on it in that same tidy insistence: Listen. Cassidy did, because he had grown used to being told to do simple things and finding himself crying halfway through, and he balanced the jar to his ear like a sea shell and felt the foolishness hit and pass, and then he realized the foolishness was his, not the object\u2019s. The jar had been left upright with a cheap dictaphone under it, the kind that clicks with an old-fashioned hunger, and when Lorna pressed play the room filled with the sound of a laugh that had learned how to be alone.\n\nHe carried the sound up the corridor as if it had weight and played it in the briefing room and let it bounce off the cheap vinyl chairs because he did not trust himself to hold it any closer. It was not cruel, which somehow made it worse; a bent laughter, an attempt at kindness executed by the wrong muscles, a body\u2019s attempt to screw a lid onto an emotion that had no jar to fit it. He watched Patel\u2019s face go through three precise changes: skepticism, concern, and then the most private look of all, the one she used when she found herself unexpectedly forgiving someone who had not asked. He stopped the recording and the silence afterward felt like the aftertaste of metal. \u201cHe\u2019s giving us himself at last,\u201d he said, and Patel shook her head, not to contradict him but to warn him that belief has its own gravity.\n\nJoel closed the shop early because his daughter had her school concert and because he had become a person who refused to miss that sort of thing even when money barked at him from the till. Bruce stood in the doorway after he had flipped the sign and said, without a proper hello, \u201cI think I\u2019m going to stop,\u201d and Joel looked at him with the tired care of a man who had loved someone in the wrong decade and not died of it. \u201cStop what,\u201d he said, because he would not give him the grace of speaking for him, and Bruce looked at his own hands, which had begun to interest him in a way he had not expected. \u201cStop laughing when I don\u2019t mean it,\u201d he said, and Joel leaned on the counter with both elbows and considered this terribly reasonable ambition. \u201cI hope you do,\u201d he said, and then because he could not help himself, he added, \u201cI hope you can.\u201d\n\nBy evening Cassidy had allowed himself to believe they were keeping pace, which is always when a case decides to quicken. A new circle appeared at the top of a flight of disused steps where the rail line had once thought about becoming a path, and inside it, instead of a jar, was a saucer, the kind your grandmother keeps even when the cup dies, and in the saucer a small dark moth lay with its wings together in the posture of an idea being given up. There was no note, only a dusting of cinnamon on the rim that looked exactly like an attempt to be kind to the invisible. Lorna stood with her hands on her hips and said nothing because sometimes objects deserve an unargument, and Patel took a breath and let it out slowly, and he thought, wildly and without evidence, that the cinnamon was a concession to the boy\u2019s mother and he loved and hated the man for it at the same time. He took the saucer as if removing a crown from a head and left the circle untroubled because it had the dignity of a thing that was trying not to do harm.\n\nHe stood again at his mother\u2019s sink that night and washed a plate he had not dirtied, that old trick of turning penances into tasks, and she watched him with her chin on her hand with a tenderness that sat plainly on her face like jewellery worn for a reason. \u201cYou look like your father when you\u2019re listening to yourself,\u201d she said, and he did not know what to do with the sentence, so he put the plate on the rack at a neat angle and dried his hands. She asked him if the boy on his desk was doing well and he said yes because the boy was, and she asked if he had written anything, and he said no because he still could not bear to describe what he was doing without adding sugar. She kissed the side of his head when he bent and told him to bring Patel round for tea any time she liked, and he made the right noise of assent and left with his pockets feeling indecently heavy.\n\nThe envelope under his door that evening had been folded with too much attention, the kind of care that makes an object look guilty, and he put it on the table and walked around it twice because he refused to look greedy. When he opened it he found three pieces of paper: a photocopy of a map that had been darkened until the field was nothing but a soft square, a photograph of a jam jar filled to the brim and reflecting only sky, and a note that said, in that reasonable child\u2019s hand, Some of us are trying to stop. He sat down because his knees had decided to give him up, and he stared at the words until they blurred, and then he laughed once, quietly, because his body had to do something and crying was not available. He put the note into the notebook with resist filling and wrong tool and not yet and felt that ridiculous, invincible human feeling that lists, if righteous enough, can change a life.\n\nBruce did not eat an ant that night. He trapped one under his glass and he watched it for the full length of a song on the radio that a happy person would have recognized and he let it go, and he did not make a performance of that mercy even to himself. He put sugar on the back step and then swept it off and then put it back on again and laughed in exasperation at his own indecision and then stopped because the laugh had caught on a metal edge somewhere in him. He wrote a note that he did not deliver and read it aloud in the voice he used in his head when he tried to be good, a bright, careful thing that embarrassed him as soon as it left his mouth. He stood at the sink and put his finger in the rim and then took it out and wiped it on his jeans and stood some more and was astonished at his own capacity for stillness. When he slept he did not, and in the morning he called it sleep because he had to give the night a name.\n\nAt nine the next morning a man in a delivery uniform put a box on the station desk and signed for it himself with a smile because he understood the pleasures of a good forgery. Inside was nothing theatrical, which frightened Cassidy more than it should have. There was a bag of cheap cinnamon, a roll of tape that had already lost its battle with its own adhesive, and a single lid from a supermarket milk bottle with a neat square of clingfilm stretched across it and secured with an elastic band. There was no ant, only the suggestion of a place where an ant could go and be cared for and then be let out again if someone remembered. The note said: Some lines I will not cross, and he looked at the line of powder and the lid and the shamed, slack tape and felt his own throat do a small, unlovely thing. Patel swore softly under her breath in a language he did not understand and then translated the swear into a breath that made him want to be better at his job.\n\nThey did the timetable until its edge, and on the edge there was the field. Not the field itself, which remained heavy in the way fields are when they do not have an audience, but the alley that refuses to call itself a path and the scratch of fence that had learned to sag where people step. At the mouth of that cut-through there was a circle that had been made without cruelty, a dusting of cinnamon as if someone had made a cake on the ground and decided at the last second not to bake it, and in the very middle, nothing at all. He stood looking at the emptiness and felt, not relief, but a complicated grief that had the shape of a man who had promised to stop and not quite managed it. He did not step into the circle because he liked the line better than the gesture, and he did not speak because there is a kind of quiet you do not interrupt with theory. Patel shifted beside him and not touching him managed to lay her steadiness alongside his.\n\nThe woman in the red coat cut across the bottom of the road then and gave them a look that said she knew where they were and was braced for it. She did not stop and they did not call to her because it would have turned the moment into something small and they were both trying not to be cheap with their courage. Behind them, in the ordinary street where people had their bins lined up for collection with the precise pride of men who polish their shoes on Sundays, a boy laughed too loudly for the joke he\u2019d been told and then looked around to see if anyone wanted to correct him. Cassidy closed his eyes and put a hand on the fence as if he were steadying someone else, and when he opened them he had decided one thing, which was that people who try to stop are entitled to an audience that does not boo.\n\nHe went home early by his standards, which meant before midnight, and he cooked something badly and ate it with care and put his plate in the sink with an awkward gratitude that surprised him. He took out his notebook and wrote down, not the case, but the way Patel had stood beside him without leaning, and the way Lorna had not laughed at the moth, and the way the cinnamon line had looked absurd and holy at once. He wrote the sentence He is trying to be good and trying not to be bad and failing in both directions, and then he crossed it out because he had taken enough from the man without taking the right to sentence him in his own drawer. He turned off the lamp and lay in the dark and laughed once, on purpose, and then he said sorry like a man saying grace and felt a bit of the day release him without letting him go.\n\nBruce woke without the usual startle because he had nothing new to be afraid of and found that to be the strangest sensation of all. He made tea with water that had not quite boiled because he did not want to be scalded by anything, even comfort, and he drank it standing up because the chair would have felt like a claim. He went to the table and put his finger on the edge of the glass over the photograph and then took it away and then put it back and then took it away, because repetition remained the only way he knew to make respect look like habit. He put on his boots and tied the laces twice and then, because he had promised himself he could, he undid the second knot and left it at one. When he stepped out of the door he did not look at the field, but he let the town look at him, and he thought, as the day put its cheap miracle of light on the brick of his street, that there are mornings you can forgive yourself for being a man who is only walking.",

The light was thin again, a sheet spread tight, and he watched it gather itself on the edge of his mother\u2019s crockery and the cheap metal of the kettle. He used the notebook he\u2019d bought because paper that was meant for shopping lists had a way of forbidding grandiosity, and he wrote three headings he had decided to live under for the day: What we refuse; What we accept; What we make. Under refuse he put the names the papers liked and crossed them out once, then again, until the page had that bruised feel of correction that satisfied him. Under accept he put: we are being watched; we are being led; we are allowed to step off the line. Under make he left a space, because leaving a space had become the only ambition he trusted not to turn into self-praise. When he got to the station Patel was already there with her hair tied back into the sort of knot that declares an intention. She slid him a stack of reports and the top one had a neat underline she\u2019d made that he had come to read as the opposite of panic. \u201cTwo imitations overnight, both schoolboys, both contrite the second you looked at them like a human. One dictaphone returned by a man who\u2019d put his shopping on it to reach his keys and realized he was part of a story. No jars moved without permission. Caf\u00e9s reporting shortages in jam because you\u2019ve turned the town into a metaphor.\u201d He laughed because he was proud and because pride is ridiculous when you claim it for a thing that isn\u2019t yours, and he promised to resolve the jam if he could resolve the man, and she said that was a fair bargain on a Wednesday.\n\nBruce had given himself a new rule, which was to wait until after nine before he did anything that made his heart skip, and it was a rule he knew he would break but he wanted the feeling of having made it. He boiled the eggs and ate the yolks slowly because he had decided that eating the part he disliked was a small apology that might be accepted by the day if not by any person. The cinnamon line at the baseboard had held, and he watched an ant go right up to it and then swing away without any complaint, and the politeness of that movement made his eyes sting in a way he would not be able to defend to anyone. He stood at the window and permitted himself an inventory of what he had not done: he had not laughed at the wrong time since the afternoon in the tackle shop when the man had made a joke about bait and he had swallowed the sound like a boy swallowing a sweet he had not paid for; he had not set a circle in a place a child could stumble on it and feel they had been made into a riddle; he had not written the girl\u2019s name down even once. He put on his boots without the extra loop for luck to prove to himself luck was not a god he answered to anymore, and then he put the loop in and took it out again because superstition and sincerity are cousins and neither of them likes to be snubbed in public.\n\nLorna brought in a little tray she had stolen from the kitchen and placed the elements on it like a teacher arranging a lesson. The dictaphone had given up its short song of laughter and a low hiss that might have been wind and might have been the mouth of a bottle, and she\u2019d saved the clips and slowed them until the spaces between the breath could be read. \u201cNo train noise, no roads close enough to make a simple guess, a fox in the middle if I had to put money on it, and that laugh,\u201d she said, tapping the tinny speaker with a nail, \u201chas had practice at being smaller than it wants to be. There\u2019s a pressure in the top of it where the sound gets pushed. You could get a read on a cough from it if we were lucky about pollen, but we\u2019re not. Timber says middle-aged man who has not exactly been quiet his whole life but has learned how to be.\u201d Cassidy didn\u2019t ask how she knew. He listened again and recognized the part of the sound that had tried to be kind and failed, and he hated how that made it worse. Patel stood in the doorway and chewed her thumbnail because she had decided not to bite down on her tongue after last year, and she said, \u201cIf he wants us to hear him, at least he\u2019s stopped using other people\u2019s voices,\u201d and he wrote that down without looking like he had.\n\nThe press had pressed. He stood in front of the familiar rectangle of microphones because people get frightened if you stop giving them a place to look, and he said the sentences about public reassurance in a tone he had tuned to manage both patience and steel. A child had coppered the day by holding a jar in a photograph, and he had felt his mouth pull tight at that, not because it implicated anything he could arrest but because it made the jar a toy, and he had spent a week trying to make it everything but. When the gloss-haired reporter asked him whether he believed the perpetrator was \u201copening dialogues,\u201d he said that talking can be a way to stop your hands doing what they want to do, and got himself in trouble with the men who wanted him to say madness because madness is comforting when you can tie it to someone else\u2019s ears. His publisher rang and left a cheery voicemail with a sorry about all that jar business at the end of it, and he put the phone face down because face down was a way of telling himself it wasn\u2019t real, which is a trick he had learned from people who had taught him what denial looks like in a neat suit.\n\nBruce bought a float he would never use because the man behind the counter had a way of talking that made you feel you were already forgiven. He carried the small thing in his pocket and let it knock against his thigh until it became something he thought with rather than an object. He walked past the crooked spire and resisted the pull to go inside again because penance done twice in a week was either devotion or obsession and he had at least decided which he disliked more in other men. He did not go to the woman\u2019s house though his feet bent towards it, because he had said he would not, and there are days when that kind of fidelity, to a boundary that only exists because someone spoke it, can feel like heroism without any of the applause. On his street a man was washing a car with dedication that looked theological, and the water left bright streaks like veins on the tarmac, and Bruce found himself stopping to watch, and stopping to watch without laughing felt so newly available to him he had to lean on the post to keep it.\n\nPatel had made a map of their own while he had been staring at the microphones, which is why you ask other people to stand on your left. She had taken the circles and the jars and the note drops and the cheap tape sales and the tack shop purchases and overlaid them with school run times and coffin routes and bin collection days, a domestic web that made his heart contract because all the routes that matter in a town are the ones that repeat whether men perform crimes or not. \u201cHe\u2019s keeping to kindness,\u201d she said, and when he flinched at the word, she added, \u201cI mean he\u2019s choosing places where an accident is unlikely. He knows where children drift, and he does not court them. His cruelty, if we\u2019re calling it that, is polite. There\u2019s a list of shops up here he has not used and two of them are the ones that would have kept receipts.\u201d He loved her for the ugliness she refused to gloss and he loved her for naming kindness even when he hated that it was the right word. He took her map and put it next to his notebook entry for what we make and drew a line not around the field but around the places men swear are not the field and wrote: shadow perimeter. Sometimes naming is a trap. Sometimes naming is a release. It would be too neat to pretend he knew which he was doing.\n\nThe boy on the desk had begun to learn how to say no in a way that invited people to accept it, and Cassidy took a mean, petty little joy in that because a station is made or broken at the front by the tone in a lad\u2019s voice when he tells someone they can\u2019t see the inspector. The woman in the red coat came again, a little earlier, and brought a jar wrapped in a towel with an embarrassment that touched him harder than the object. \u201cIt was on the wall by my gate,\u201d she said, and she stood there with her hands doing their own small ritual of keeping each other from saying too much. Inside was no sugar line or float or note, only a tracing of steam caught on the glass as if someone had held their mouth to it and breathed out gently. He looked and he knew the shape of that breath like he knew the shape of his own name in a room that didn\u2019t welcome it. \u201cHe is stopping,\u201d she said, and by the terrible mercy of English tenses she meant both that he was in the act and that perhaps he would, and he said, \u201cWe will help him,\u201d and knew he had said something that was neither a promise nor a lie but an intention, which is as close as most men get when they are not allowed to be priests.\n\nHe set a decoy because he had an old pride in the craft and he did not intend to let a week of having his steps counted turn him into someone who did not set his own problem. It was not elegant. It was a jam jar with a lid that had been handled with bare fingers and then wiped with a cloth so that a print would be likely but not a certainty, and inside it there was nothing but a small scrap of kitchen roll with a sentence copied from the man\u2019s first note, the one that had done its metal taste trick on him: One of us has to remember. He placed it under the eaves of the community hall between the hours when toddlers are sung to and decent men come to discuss allotments, and he set a camera that did not try to hide because he had learned that hiding makes people perform for you while being visible sometimes grants you the freedom of being ignored. Patel told him he was being theatrical and he said that sometimes the way you find people who love show is you put a small stage where they can step onto it without having to admit to themselves that they wanted to. He hated himself a little even as he said it and his contempt was a good, stingy discipline.\n\nBruce walked past the community hall on purpose and on accident because he had always liked the smell of its wood in the heat and because he had a sense that someone was trying to put a thing on a shelf for him to reach. He saw the jar and he registered the camera and he felt the chuckle rise like a burp he could not control. He put his knuckles to his mouth and he spoke into his hand as if his body were a microphone that might betray him. He did not touch the jar. He stood and looked at it and he let himself admire the honesty of the trap. He read the line inside and felt the muscles along his spine do that climbing thing like cats in cartoons, which is to say his body pulled away and leaned in both at once. He was furious at the insistence of the word remember because remembering was his field and he had been trying, for days now, to walk around the trampling. He left because you should always leave when you feel a door swing both ways and you cannot tell which way is the kinder.\n\nLorna called him into the lab with the sort of expression she used for news that would be useful but not satisfying. \u201cEvidence room breach wasn\u2019t clever,\u201d she said, blowing on a cup of tea that had been allowed to stew itself bitter, \u201cand I\u2019m not sure whether that makes it better or worse. We\u2019ve got a clean trail up to the door, a blur on the camera where there should be a man, which was achieved by a piece of tape with Vaseline on it, and then a blank because somebody left the camera pointing at the ceiling. I pulled the logs. A night cleaner\u2019s fob. The night cleaner does not have a nephew, and yet a nephew entered. I can build you a list of people who have nephews if you want a laugh, but it will not get us closer to your jar. If you\u2019re asking me whether the breach was an inside job, I\u2019d say it was inside the building but outside the team, and if you\u2019re asking me whether that\u2019s what the team wants to hear, I\u2019ll say you should buy biscuits.\u201d He bought biscuits because biscuit buying is a language that has saved more stations than policy ever did, and he told Patel to send flowers to the cleaner because being used is a special kind of hurt and flowers were the only apology he could sign off without involving a lawyer.\n\nHe watched the decoy jar for an hour that felt like practice at being still, and in that hour three different people noticed the camera and adjusted what they were carrying and two women performed complaint with that generous relish people have when they suspect they are protecting their babies from the world, and one man in a fluorescent vest paused and put his hand on the jar as if checking to see if it were warm. The man in the vest was not Bruce, and this knowledge did not comfort him because hope had begun to attach itself to what he could not plan for. At eleven a boy on a scooter came past and took out his phone and performed a video of the jar\u2019s existence for friends who would watch it and forget, and the word \u201clore\u201d got used in the comments because that is what children call the story of a thing when the adults have not given it a name yet. He pulled the jar back before lunch with the ignominy of the trick that fails without revealing anything but the shape of your vanity, and Patel did not say I told you because she had learned there are ways to be right that make your job harder.\n\nBruce went to see Joel with nothing in his hands because he had decided that if he was going to be forgiven by anyone it would have to be for the thing he had done, not for an exchange rate. Joel\u2019s shop smelled of plastic sweating under strip lights, and this mood is strangely companionable when you need to confess. \u201cI want to tell you something you will not be able to use,\u201d he said, and Joel put his elbows on the counter like a man prepared to hold up more than his share of weight. \u201cDon\u2019t say the field,\u201d Joel said, with an automatic kindness that made Bruce love him. \u201cNo,\u201d Bruce said, and it tasted good to keep one boundary where it belonged, \u201cI want to tell you that I am stopping. That if I laugh, I will swallow it. That if I put something down, I will pick it up again. That if I start to make a circle, I will draw a line through it and go home.\u201d Joel nodded and then had the decency to be honest. \u201cYou won\u2019t,\u201d he said, not cruelly and not without hope, \u201cyou\u2019ll do some of those some days. But you\u2019ve got the look of a man who wants to try, and trying is a thing I still give out scores for like a PE teacher.\u201d Bruce laughed even though he had not planned to, and they both looked at each other like they had shared an act of intimacy and had gotten away with it.\n\nA lunch hour passed in the station with the familiar mending of corners. A constable with a new baby showed photographs that had a way of softening the grip on rage that work sometimes turns into. Lorna told a story about a forensics conference at which men had used the word \u201cladies\u201d in a tone that suggested they had asked permission first, and Patel rolled her eyes with professional finesse and then ate a sandwich with the complacency of someone who had remembered to eat. Cassidy watched his mother\u2019s name light his phone and let himself answer not because he had time but because there is always time when the voice at the other end will be the one that was there when you learned to be less than you wanted to be and more than you thought. She told him she had seen a jar on the news and she had felt the urge to put a knitted cover on it to stop it coming to harm, and he loved her so much in that moment that he had to put the phone on speaker because his hand shook. She said, \u201cBring Patel for tea,\u201d again, and he said, \u201cI will,\u201d again, and the repetition healed something small in him that did not heal when he made grander promises.\n\nThe map in his pocket had begun to feel less like a prophecy and more like a suggestion, a difference he intended to live by. He and Patel took the afternoon as a space to insert three places not on any of the notes, and they did it with the courtesy of people choosing chairs in a busy caf\u00e9, aware that everyone is trying to sit somewhere without making a scene. The first place was the narrow triangle of grass by the sculpture of the miner with the too-clean hands, and he stood there and allowed himself a thought about what statues are for and how they regulate guilt, and then he let it go before he made himself insufferable. The second was the lay-by by the reservoir that had begun it, because you have to go back to the mouth of the story sometimes to remind it you are its author as much as its reader, and he watched the wind riffle the heather with the charity of a man who knew wind had no story. The third was the alley behind his mother\u2019s house because he wanted to test the superstition that says the story will not come where your childhood stood, and he was relieved and ashamed to find that superstition is as arbitrary and as right as it always is.\n\nBruce put a jar on his own step and did not put anything in it. He placed it like a test he could pass and he left it when he went out and he left it when he came back, and when he opened his door after dusk and saw the glass still there like an object that had chosen not to be a symbol, he had to sit on the mat for a moment and breathe because the relief hurt him all the way through. He put sugar under the jar and then swept it away and then put cinnamon there instead and stood and waited for his own judgment and, when it did not arrive, he applauded himself with the mean little claps of a boy who has learned to be his own teacher. He ate a slice of bread without butter because he had decided to make himself small, and then he put butter on a second slice because smallness had never made a man kinder to anyone but himself. As the radio blathered in the next room and the woman with the gentle voice asked a politician to be honest in a tone she knew would fail, Bruce laughed the size of a fingernail and felt forgiven. He did not know by whom.\n\nBy late afternoon the station had acquired that smell of men who have worn their jumpers too long inside the same four walls, and the air was ready for something, not dramatic, but decisive. The boy on the desk handed him an envelope as if it contained a live thing that could be calmed by a certain pressure, and for once, the envelope was dull and brown and had not been folded with an excess of care that made him feel manipulated. Inside was a timetable just like the first, a neat line of times you could set your pulse to, but across it the man had written in the unruffled hand of a boy who always gives himself full marks for neatness: we will go to the field only when neither of us is trying to be good. Cassidy sat with the sentence as if it were a badly behaved friend at a wake and he realized with a low, heavy certainty that the man had understood something criminal and true about him, which was that he had been using goodness as a bargaining chip with the day. Patel read it and made a sound that had no word, and then she folded the paper so that the sentence lay across itself and could not be read without effort, which was her form of editing when men got ideas.\n\nThey walked a route that had not been given to them and felt like their own because they had decided to claim it. It took them up past the school that smelled of dry pasta and small rushes, and along the row where the hedges had learned to tolerate lopsidedness, and down the steps the council had put in to admit their own failure at making slopes. At the corner where three roads tried and failed to become one, the woman in the red coat was waiting not for them but in the way you wait when you do not want to reach the place you are going at the speed your legs would get you there. She did not move to intercept and they did not stop, and the courtesy of that choreography made him feel oddly adult. A boy on a bike came too close and yelled comedy apologies with an exhilaration he would have liked more if he hadn\u2019t been allowing himself the luxury of feeling old. When they reached the alley that refused its own name, the smell of damp fence caught at the back of his throat like a word he could not yet recall, and he touched the wood with a hand he kept visible because his hands had become part of the conversation.\n\nHe cooked for himself because he had decided he would not rely on his mother to tidy the day for him just because she could. The stew took too long and not long enough and he ate it with the agitation of a man who wants there to be a task attached to swallowing. He took out the notebook and wrote under What we make: a way back, and then he turned to a fresh page and wrote a line that was not the first sentence of the book he had promised but the first sentence of any page that would let him keep living near work without becoming work. It said: I will not make a man into a story until he makes himself into one, and even then I will check for his permission in places that are not his mouth. He did not pretend he would keep it, because men like him promise lines to themselves the way other men promise each other favours, but he let the words sit on the kitchen table like a little barricade against the version of himself who would be tempted to be clever and paid for it with something soft.\n\nBruce did not put anything out that night. He did not lay a line or a float or a thin film. He did not press his nail into the soft blue of the ant farm because it was in the station now and he was in his house and there were things he had sent away from himself with a weird pride that he preferred, for the first time in a while, to keep. He stood in the dark and did not check the window to see if the street was empty, because the street had earned the right to be itself without his surveillance. He laughed once because laughing had become a thing his body did the way some people\u2019s bodies make a small noise when they stand up too fast, and he swallowed the sound into himself as if it were tea he had decided to sip rather than gulp. When he slept his dreams had the kind of narrative that is a mercy, a straightforward story about a bus that did and did not arrive, and he woke with the clean disappointment this yields. He placed his finger on the photograph\u2019s edge without flipping it, because there are days when turning something over is a violence even if it is a softness when you\u2019re finished.\n\nBy morning a circle had appeared that was not his and not Cassidy\u2019s, which embarrassed both of them because the town has the right to create meaning without being asked to sign for it. It was in chalk outside the library where the children\u2019s hour made adults pretend their nostalgia was wholesome, and in the middle of it a woman had written in a terrible looped hand that these sorts of hands prefer: Be kind. The circle was swept away by a man with a brush because chalk annoys men with responsibilities they take seriously, but the sentence remained because chalk is persistent, and he stood and watched as the curve of the B tried to hold onto the pavement a second longer than the other letters, and he felt grateful and stupid and ready all at once. Patel nodded at the sentiment and then insisted they ignore it for work purposes because you can\u2019t prosecute sentimental instructions even if they are rude enough to tell you how to do your job. He wrote Be kind in his notebook anyway and did not cross it out, which was a rebellion of the most pathetic kind and therefore the only one that did not pour poison back into the system.\n\nAround noon, when the town likes to pretend it can be a different town after lunch, another dictaphone arrived under a jar that had not been meant to sing. The voice that came out when Lorna pressed play had learned a new thing overnight; it was the same laugh, damped and willing to behave, but under it there was a word that had not gotten permission to be heard and had gotten out anyway. It was the girl\u2019s name. It came like a breath the body had tried to hold and failed. Cassidy did not write it down because paper is a kind of court, and he did not repeat it to Patel because repeating is a kind of ritual, and he did not let it loose in the briefing room because letting names loose is like telling a dog to go and run along the road. He pressed stop and he held the little machine in his palm with the careful disgust he reserved for things that carried grief that wasn\u2019t his, and he said aloud, only to the corners of the room that had listened to policemen practice speeches for thirty years, \u201cWe are almost done being polite.\u201d\n\nBruce had not meant for the name to be bought by the air. It had slipped out of the side of his laugh like a coin dropped by a man who does not keep change separate from his notes, and he had felt it go and had not reached out because reaching out to stop a name is the same as chasing it, and chasing is a kind of performance and he was trying to stop performing. He walked to the field and stood at the gate because it had become the only way to do the opposite of what he had been doing, and the gate made its small sound and he placed his hand where his hand had learned to go, and he did not step up or over. He did not think the word pilgrimage because pilgrimage romanticizes distance and he was practicing an uglier kind of honesty that day, the sort that refuses poetry. He laughed once and he stopped the laugh by biting down on the side of his mouth until he tasted salt that had not been put there by sugar, and he said out loud, to the soil that would not reward him for talk, \u201cI am not bringing you anything today,\u201d and he meant it with a sincerity that scared him because it felt like theft from his own only language.\n\nThey did not make a plan to go to the field that afternoon and so of course that was when the field made a plan to receive them. A boy with a dog whose name was Martin and could again be misheard as Monty, because this is how stories remind you that they repeat, came to the station with a face that had learned how to be important because someone had just told him the right thing would depend on what he said next. The dog had rolled in something that smelled like a dead story and the boy had gone down into the basin to shout and had found a circle of cinnamon so strong that he had sneezed three times like a cartoon, and in the middle of the circle there was no jar and no float and no paper and no nothing. Cassidy closed his eyes because the body has to signal its gratitude to bad news for its clarity, and then he stood and he called Patel and he called Lorna and he told himself that he would walk to the field and he would not count his steps and he would not look at his hands and he would not call what was about to happen anything until it had finished happening. This is a discipline. It is not one he had often kept.\n\nThe basin had accepted the cinnamon with the quiet one might grant a doctrine too mild to argue with. The wind had gathered it at the edges as if to stop anyone sneezing themselves sick, and the ants had performed an obedience that made the throat tight. There was no jar, which he found hysterically offensive after a week in which glass had been the god of small intentions. The circle was a line a man had drawn for himself and not crossed, and he stood with a sudden, wretched pride he could not defend or explain. Patel came to his side and did not step over because she had gotten good at not claiming a line even as she inspected it, and Lorna made an irritable sound because politeness makes crumbly evidence. \u201cHe\u2019s saying he can stop while showing us he can still draw,\u201d she said, which was the sort of sentence that would be quoted poorly later in the dark places where people like to make stories about men who hurt other people, and he nodded because she had earned that ugliness with a day of seeing too closely to be flattered by it.\n\nHe did not touch the cinnamon because it was not his to handle if this was a peace offering, and he did not photograph it straight away because sometimes the act of making a record is the thing that changes the fact in front of you more than the weather ever could. He stood and he let himself think a dangerous thought, which was that maybe the jar had been showing them a man teaching himself to be tidy in public, and maybe the field would not need to be refreshed with his grief if he could learn to make his circles at home where cinnamon lines held. He did not say it because thoughts like that end up signed in ink in places they shouldn\u2019t, and he liked his job enough to know what it can\u2019t hold. Patel, who could always smell when his brain went soft, put a hand near his arm without laying it on, and he understood the signal: be a policeman now, not a man who writes things down for soft reading later. He pulled on gloves and he asked for the tape and he measured the circle with his eyes in the old way and he told a constable where to stand so his boot made a friend for yesterday\u2019s tread.\n\nBruce sat on his own back step with the glass in his pocket and a walnut he could not crack with his teeth because he had never learned the trick, and he took a little proud pleasure in that lack because there are weaknesses you do not want to cure. Across the street a woman drew a chalk rainbow for a child who had already learned that chalk is a temporary claim, and the child coloured within the lines with an obedience that frightened him and moved him. He laughed, small and no bigger than a cough, and the child looked up at him with the clean suspicion children reserve for men who laugh on steps. He waved with a sincerity he almost got away with, and the child waved back because the child had not learned the rhythms of precaution yet, and the woman looked at him with a careful inattention because women have. He swallowed the next laugh before it thought to be born, and he went back inside and sat with his back to the sink and listened to the disgusting, beautiful steadiness of water going where it should in a house that was not yet broken by any of his tricks.\n\nBack at the station the envelope waited that would make the afternoon into what the afternoon had always intended to be. It was heavy in the way envelopes get heavy when someone has added weight to make you feel its seriousness, and inside there was a rough circle cut from a map with impatience, and a sentence that told him what time would be honest and what time would be theatre. Dawn, it said, and then it said: if you laugh you stop; if I laugh I stop. He showed it to Patel and she lifted one eyebrow in a way that meant she was finding him a way to keep his dignity while reminding him he had already lost a slice of it by believing in this fairness. They made a plan about bodies and cameras and routes they would not take and angles men don\u2019t think of because they have not learned to carry prams, and he sent a message to his mother that said simply, early, and she texted back, I know, like a woman who had always known when her son was going to go to a field and perform dignities. He put the note in his pocket and he said to himself and to whatever it is in a room that listens when you are not saying it aloud: do not ruin this by narrating.\n\nHe slept in the way police sleep before early things, which is to say he lay down and he let the body pretend to go dark and he allowed his brain to run its show behind a curtain and he got up twice and forgot he had gotten up at all. He put on his boots and he did the laces once because he had promised himself a minimal superstition, and he did not look at the notebook because the book had no right to the shape of what was about to happen. He met Patel at the van with the thermos she liked, too strong, and with a silence he hoped would count as professionalism, and they did not talk about where they would stand or not stand because these were movements they had already rehearsed in the unattractive ballet of necessary work. The sky above the basin was not honest about its plan and he found himself liking it for that, because honesty is not a virtue in a landscape, only a quality some men ask of other men so that they can feel right pronouncing them sinners. He walked and he did not count and he kept his hands where he could see them until he reached a place where keeping them in sight would itself be theatre, and then he put them in his pockets because warmth is allowed to trump symbolism on a cold morning.\n\nBruce had waited for dawn outside of sleep and found that his body could be more patient than he had quite allowed. He did not eat an ant. He did not eat anything. He had tea with the water a moment off boil, and then he poured it away because making will make you do stupid things like forget to drink. He took the jar and he did not take any implements because he had promised himself a clean day, and he walked the streets with the care of a man who knows which stones like to slide under your feet. He did not look for cameras because cameras are nerves and he had enough of his own, and he did not perform his hands because there would be nobody to read them, and he laughed once very softly at the thought that if a man laughs alone in the morning it might count as a prayer after all. He came to the gate and he placed his hand on the wood and it made its almost sound as if it were easing an old joint, and this was the courtesy he had been craving from the world all week. He did not step over. He stood. He waited.\n\nThe basin did not want a speech. The cinnamon line from the day before had been blurred by a wind that had not meant to take sides, and the ground held that sucked-light sheen that peat gives you when it would prefer not to have your boot. He stood at the edge with Patel in his periphery and the men he had begged for when he had needed muscle behind decency, and he looked down at the little theater he had let a man build in his case and he did not hate himself for that, because hating yourself at the edge of a decision is a child\u2019s way of asking to be forgiven before you act. The man was not there and then he was there, in the way that careful men appear when they decide to stop avoiding an appointment. He did not look like a monster because monsters are a theater costume and Bruce had never liked dressing up. He looked like a man trying not to knock over a thing he had just stopped himself wanting. Cassidy did not speak and neither did he, and this was the first good decision of the morning. The sound in the basin was not quite silence. It was the soft not-noise of a day not begun.\n\nThe agreement about laughing had been written because it had to be written, not because it would be kept. Cassidy felt the reflex in his throat and he shut it as if he had swallowed a too-hot thought. Bruce felt his laugh jitter in his jaw and he pressed his tongue to his teeth because he had decided to give himself that trick and it worked, impractically, as far as tricks do. They stood as men stand when the air wants to do a thing and you are considerate enough not to ask what thing that is. Patel placed herself as if she were the thought in his head that would keep him from winning by the wrong set of rules. Lorna was not there because you do not bring a woman who must touch things for a living to a place where touching is half the crime. A fox broke the small etiquette of the morning by making its way along the edge with the indifference that keeps animals moral, and Bruce watched it and then he looked at Cassidy and Cassidy allowed himself a small nod because consent, even between men, is a discipline.\n\nWhen he spoke, Bruce did not say sorry. He did not say the name that had escaped his laugh. He said, \u201cI am trying to stop,\u201d and it was the least dramatic sentence he\u2019d managed all week, and it had the correctness of a man who has practiced arranging his mouth around a truth he can carry. Cassidy let the air close over the words and then he answered with the sentence he had written to himself last night and then crossed out so it would not own him. \u201cWe are going to stop you,\u201d he said, and he found, as he said it, that he meant it in a way that allowed for more than one ending. Bruce nodded at the offer of a soft plural, and his mouth did the thing it had always done when it tried not to do the other thing, and the laugh flickered in the old way and then did not come. He put the jar down on the ground without crossing, which was both an act of deference and a kind of prayer to a fence, and he stepped back, and Cassidy put on his gloves, and behind them the town took a breath that did not belong to them and let it go.",
