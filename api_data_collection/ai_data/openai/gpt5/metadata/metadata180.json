     "novel_text": "She noticed the fear first as a slow tightening, like a belt cinching around her chest while she was only standing at the foot of the library steps. The steps weren\u2019t high, they barely rose above the cobbled square, but a sudden wash of air and space above them made her throat pinch and her eyes start their shivery flicker, the way they do when your body is about to invent a new rule for living. It was late March, sunlight bouncing off slick windows on the Headrow, buses dragging their weary chests through the city like beasts that have been ridden too hard for too long. Abby stood still and looked at the unremarkable flight of stone. A gull wheeled overhead. Something slipped.\n\nShe made herself climb. Nothing bad happened, and yet everything did, because she knew she\u2019d felt it. She pressed her palm to the cool pillar and breathed, slow in, slower out, trying to tether herself to the stone, to Leeds, to the map in her head of all the ways home.\n\nLater she laughed about it to Mel at the pub, only she was the only one laughing. \u201cYou\u2019re not serious,\u201d Mel said, blowing a fringe out of her eyes. Mel\u2019s a woman with a collection of enamel pins and an attitude that made editors flinch. Abby liked to believe they were similar. \u201cYou write about the world, Abby. Heights are part of the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t even a height,\u201d Abby said. They were in the Whitelocks, one of those places that smells like beer has prestige. Table by the window. Light catching the dust and making it seem like something soft and purposeful. \u201cIt was the thought of it. The hint. The idea of what it would be like if the ground decided to unhook itself, you know? If I looked over an edge and the city just, I don\u2019t know, tipped.\u201d\n\nMel made a face. \u201cYou need a pint. You need a holiday.\u201d\n\n\u201cI need a new nervous system. Where do you buy those?\u201d\n\n\u201cOn Kirkgate Market, stall forty-two. They do two for one on Tuesdays.\u201d Mel leaned in. \u201cYou sure you\u2019re not being dramatic? You\u2019re brilliant at being dramatic and it\u2019s part of your charm. But the pieces we\u2019ve talked about\u2014there are rooftops in those, Abby. Rooftops and cable cars and one ill-advised suggestion from my boss about a lighthouse. And you\u2019re always saying Leeds deserves to be seen from above, yeah?\u201d\n\nAbby smiled, because her face had been trained for years to do it on cue. Inside, the little belt around her chest tightened another notch. She used to clamber onto car parks just for the view, used to press up to hotel windows and paint the city with her finger in the air\u2014calls and cranes and the old clock towers. But when she tried to picture those now, she felt the suggestion of a missing railing. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m just tired. I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\n\nOn the walk home along Briggate, she detoured into the arcade and let herself be charmed by all those gilt ribs curving over her head. Nothing to fall from, unless the sky itself decided to turn inside out. She took the bus back up to Chapel Allerton and leaned against the window and watched rooftops trickle by like a memory she was trying to catch before it slid down the plug. The man in the seat opposite was watching a video loudly; she heard the tinny rise of a pop chorus, and then someone\u2019s voice telling him to \u201csort it out, pal,\u201d and then the no-voice of everyone else, looking at their laps. The bus puttered and bucked and braked just in time for nobody to fall.\n\nAt home she stood at the kitchen window and looked at the lean against of the sky. A roofline, a chimney. A little slope. She made tea and wrote. That is to say, she sat and tapped keys so quietly they might have been a mouse. She told herself that she would not go on Twitter, she would not google \u201cfear of heights, suddenly\u201d because she knew what would happen: she\u2019d end up on a forum where people with pseudonyms described how they\u2019d never left their own beds again. And she was not ready to be a pseudonym.\n\nIt was midnight when Callum rang. Not because he wanted to talk\u2014because he had somehow set his phone to dial her when he stuck it in his pocket, the way you do when your life is a chain of accidents. \u201cCal?\u201d she said, and then she heard a muffled chorus of voices and one that was undoubtedly his because he always sounded like a boy caught in a fence. \u201cCal, I can hear you.\u201d\n\nHe came on a second later, breathing into the line. \u201cAbby. Didn\u2019t mean to. Sorry.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo worries,\u201d she said, and it wasn\u2019t, not really, because their break had been the opposite of dramatic; it had been slow and lacked edges. But later he messaged: You OK? She typed: yeah, developed a new fear, look at me, growing. Then she deleted it. She typed nothing at all.\n\nIn the morning she walked to Meanwood Park, because trees are vertical and not frightening. She stood on the little slope where the ground rose to meet the canopy and tried to trick herself into believing the ground was above her and the sky below. It didn\u2019t work, but for a moment she felt a remembering of afternoon games with her father, when he\u2019d tell her the trick to golf was not to hit the ball but to let it go. She\u2019d never once let anything go in her whole life, not really. Golf had been an aberration, and it had been his. When he\u2019d died, she\u2019d put the clubs in a cupboard and said she was done. The cupboard had a keyhole and when she passed it sometimes, she could feel the cold eye of it on her.\n\nBack home she opened her email. Mel had sent a detailed list of how the next two months would go if Abby agreed to the city-above-city piece. Rooftop gardens, scaffolding tours, the bridge on the top of the library where nobody goes because it\u2019s \u201conly staff\u201d and a man with a key had promised he might let her up. \u201cImagine the photos,\u201d Mel wrote. \u201cIt\u2019ll be like sternum music. Your words + those lines. People will stop and breathe. If you let me, we\u2019ll do this.\u201d\n\nAbby said yes. She said yes because it was the only shape her mouth knew how to make when a door condensed in front of her. Then she sat and felt sick.\n\nShe told her mother in the way of a person dropping to their knees on a bus just to feel the grounding, which is to say, she did it at the end of a call about something else. \u201cI\u2019m writing about heights,\u201d she said, swallowing her voice like hot tea. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not, at this moment, brilliant at heights.\u201d\n\n\u201cSince when?\u201d Janet Sutcliffe\u2019s voice always came through like something neighbourly, a cardigan. \u201cYou were always clambering on things when you were a kid. Irresponsible. There might be a correlation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks, Mum.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just saying, if you are anxious now, why pick a subject that has \u2018fall\u2019 written into it? There are things you can write about without dangling yourself off them. Cake.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to dangle.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood, because who do you think you are, James Bond? You were scared of the steps up to the slide for a year when you were three. I had to go up and push you down. Do you remember? You howled the whole way back up. The man watching said, brave little soldier, isn\u2019t she. He knew nothing about you.\u201d\n\nAbby closed her eyes. The little belt found a new notch. \u201cIt\u2019s not like that. It\u2019s not that I want to\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThen don\u2019t,\u201d her mother said. \u201cYou have options. Take the easy ones for once and you\u2019ll live longer. There. You\u2019ll say I\u2019m negative, but I\u2019m a realist, Abigail. Don\u2019t get cross. I have to go; Brenda\u2019s at the door with a trifle, and if I stand here too long she\u2019ll catch cold through the glass like my mother used to say you get. Put on thicker skin. Or a thicker coat.\u201d\n\nAfter the call, Abby set her phone face down like that might stop the stream of the world coming at her. She thought about lies, and how they weren\u2019t always mean-spirited. She could say she had a cold. She could say the scaffolding man never found his key. She could deliver a smaller version of the thing she\u2019d promised and trust that nobody outside herself would notice. She could do what she had done too many times: make a careful story about not being brave and give it a word like careful, like wise.\n\nShe put on her boots and got on another bus. When in doubt, move. When in doubt, go to something that looks like the thing you\u2019re afraid of, but smaller. She went to the car park on The Calls, the one that had that view across to the dark boulders of the railway arches. She had taken photographs from the top level there, once. She had laughed into the wind. Now she went up only one flight, then the next. Her hands trembled with that peculiar mix of privacy and theatre humans live for; she thought of all the CCTV cameras tunnelling her like light. She reached the third level. Wind. She turned a corner and saw the slice of the gap. It was only a slice. Only a sliver where the city slipped under and stood back up somewhere else, perfectly normal and unremarkable, but she felt it like a cliff.\n\nA boy in a baseball cap threaded past her, chewing something, and rolled his eyes at his phone. A van coughed. Across the river, someone rattled a shutter. The past is always noisier than the present. Abby took a breath and moved closer to the low wall. There was gum on it, pale fossils too many to count. She lifted her phone to capture the arches. Her hands shook. The phone wobbled. She thought: what if I drop it. She thought: what if I can\u2019t stop, what if everything liquid in me rushes outward toward that edge, what if I pour.\n\nShe tried anyway. The photograph was poor. She took another and it was better, and then she did what her body wanted to do: she turned away and put the wall at her back so that the city could do what it wanted without her knowing about it. She walked back along the concrete lane, counted the bolts in the railings, forced herself to look down through the gaps because slow looking can trick panic into telling the truth. She made it back to the stairs. She made it down. The muscles in her shins buzzed like somebody had left lights on inside them.\n\nIn the afternoon, her writers\u2019 circle met at the Hyde Park Book Club and she almost didn\u2019t go, because everybody there is tenderly cruel in the way writers sometimes are. They they can map a wound, point to its address on your page with a pen and say, here, this is where you broke yourself, and in being so precise they can sometimes spell it as care. Abby loves them and hates them in proportions that shift with the light. She slipped into a chair and ordered a coffee so strong it could probably be seen from Otley.\n\n\u201cAbigail!\u201d said Nisha, who never called anyone by their short name. \u201cHave we got three extracts today? Mel said you were on fire.\u201d She made a sizzling noise and Abby pretended to be charred.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve said yes to the rooftop series,\u201d she told them, because she knew if she said it out loud enough times it would become a fact and not a dangerous verb. \u201cWe\u2019ll see Leeds from heights no one bothers with. We\u2019ll give them a map of all the lines. I\u2019ll probably grow gills.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you need a harness,\u201d said Toby, who wrote about industrial heritage and whose idea of a good time was pointing at a lever and telling you how it was made. \u201cBecause I have a man. He\u2019s worked on\u2026 everything.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need a harness.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust don\u2019t fall off anything,\u201d Nina said. Nina never told a joke that didn\u2019t sound like a dropped stitch. \u201cThat\u2019s my professional advice to you.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you, Nina, I\u2019ll try not to fall off anything.\u201d Abby said it lightly, because they all took their turns at being the one who needed an audience. Still, when they read her draft paragraph aloud\u2014the one about the arcade\u2019s bones and the sense that you could hear the city thinking when you climbed a little higher than anyone else\u2014Toby circled a sentence and crossed it out. \u201cSoft,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can do better. Don\u2019t cower.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not cowering,\u201d she said, and then looked at the line he\u2019d crossed out and wanted to hide inside it.\n\nAfter, she walked through the drizzle up to Woodhouse Ridge with Nina. The path was slick and smelled like leaf and smoke, that Novemberish smell that shouldn\u2019t belong to March, but Leeds does what it wants with its weather. \u201cYou\u2019re really anxious,\u201d Nina said, stating it simply as if naming a colour.\n\n\u201cJust a bit. It\u2019ll be fine.\u201d Abby shoved her hands in her jacket. \u201cI used to climb car parks for fun.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome of that was showing off.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to say.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome of all our things are showing off. You can love that part too.\u201d\n\nThey turned and looked back at the patchwork of the city, as seen at an angle where nothing had to be vertical. The skyline was a set of blunt teeth, cranes like hairpins. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s just my age,\u201d Abby said. \u201cMaybe your body decides someday that the whole earth is made of trousers without a belt. And you reach down, and they\u2019re not there.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood image,\u201d Nina said. \u201cPut it in.\u201d\n\nShe went home and opened her father\u2019s cupboard. The key turned in that satisfying way that keys have when they haven\u2019t been wriggled at a door in a while. The clubs were wrapped in a towel that had once been white and was now a chronology of grass. She lifted one. It felt like a limb you could pretend not to own. She swung it in the kitchen experimentally and nearly knocked the lampshade off, then swore, then laughed, because it was ridiculous, then cried because it wasn\u2019t.\n\nGolf had always been a way to explain systems to herself. Wind and angle, stubbornness and release. She had hated the men who owned the club in Moortown because they always called her sweetheart and then watched her like hunters, but she had loved the fairways when the light was low and the birds skittered out ahead like they were there just for her to chase them. She messaged Mel and said: mad idea. What if we did a piece from a different kind of height? The low kind. The ridge of a green. Light on a slope. She didn\u2019t send it. She saved it to drafts. She put the club back and it caught on the lip of the towel and fell, making a noise that sounded like a gulp. She steadied herself against the counter and laughed again, an ugly sound.\n\nHer father\u2019s old friend, Arthur, messaged the next day. He had a way of knowing when she\u2019d opened a door. maybe tea? haven\u2019t seen you long. fancy a knock round saturday? nothing serious. i\u2019ll carry your bag if you carry my awful conversation.\n\nShe typed: I don\u2019t have a membership. He typed back: guest. or we go municipal. Roundhay\u2019s cheap and cheerful. she typed: ok. And that was how she found herself at a tee on a Saturday morning with a jacket that didn\u2019t quite keep out the sharpness of the wind and a knot in her chest that had started to feel like a given. It wasn\u2019t a height, not exactly. But there were slopes, edges. And there were those tee boxes that looked out over something that was not exactly a drop but pretended well enough.\n\nArthur put a hand on her shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s only grass,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it tries to kill you, I\u2019ll tackle it to the ground. How are you, Abby?\u201d\n\n\u201cBetter if we don\u2019t talk,\u201d she said, and he laughed, and they did not talk much, and she was grateful. A boy with a fleece that had the club\u2019s logo on it came to take Arthur\u2019s bag, and she didn\u2019t mean to look at his face like that, like he was a code to be cracked, but she was a writer, and writing doesn\u2019t stop because your nerves have decided to go on strike. The boy was probably twenty. Dark hair, eyes that had a way of waiting for you to say the next thing. He kept glancing at his phone in his pocket and then apologising as if it were a personal failing.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t her caddy, not then, not for her, because she\u2019d never think to ask. But he was there, and he walked behind them, and when she looked back he gave her that curious smile that people give to other people when there\u2019s a story hovering above them like a weather system. He lifted Arthur\u2019s bag up as if it wasn\u2019t a sack of iron but something that thought itself light. \u201cKit,\u201d he said. \u201cLike the cat. Hi.\u201d\n\n\u201cHi,\u201d she said, telling herself she was a person who believes in coincidences without expecting them to behave. \u201cI\u2019m Abby. Sorry if we\u2019re slow.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like there\u2019s anywhere else more interesting.\u201d He looked up at the treeline and then at the next tee. \u201cUnless you like standing perfectly still in a car park and trying not to be watched by pigeons.\u201d\n\nShe grinned despite herself. \u201cI used to. I\u2019ve retired from that life.\u201d\n\n\u201cCongratulations,\u201d he said. \u201cI always thought pigeons were in MI5.\u201d\n\nThey played. Or rather, Arthur played and Abby remembered. How to breathe and swing and let her head stay still; how to watch the ball\u2019s white travel. On the sixth, where the ground ran down and then up again like it was practising being sea, she felt the wobble that meant her body thought this was height even when it wasn\u2019t. She held the club and looked at the flag, a simple thing flopping in a plain wind. She could walk down into that dip and up again just as ordinary as a person can, and yet.\n\n\u201cIt helps to look at the ground two steps in front,\u201d Kit said, not unkindly, as if he\u2019d handed her a sweet. \u201cNot ahead at the dip. You\u2019ll look ahead when you want to, not before. Steps. That\u2019s what my gran says, anyway. She says all the worst things are in the head and the head is stupid and has to be tricked.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am well aware my head is stupid,\u201d Abby said, and took two steps, then two more, and found that the world did not pull at her. She did not look up at the slice of drop; she looked at her own boots, and then at Arthur\u2019s hand as he pretended to swat a fly from the air and ended up swatting nothing. The grass hissed. She moved through the dip as if walking down a memory.\n\nAfter, in the clubhouse, Kit drank a Coke and chewed the straw and glanced at his phone again, that habitual twitch young people have when the world\u2019s telling them there\u2019s an instruction they haven\u2019t read yet. He didn\u2019t look at Abby but she felt the hum of his attention. She told herself she was imagining it. She eavesdropped on Arthur telling a story about a bunker that had been \u201cimpossible\u201d and how he\u2019d blasted out in one go like a man who knew how to kick luck\u2019s door in.\n\nThe rooftop piece loomed. Mel messaged her with a photo of the scaffolding guy holding a hard hat like a theatre prop. \u201cHe\u2019s keen,\u201d Mel wrote. \u201cHe says the view will make you write like you\u2019ve just learned the word for sky.\u201d Abby set the phone down and it glowed anyway, the way phones do, you can\u2019t make them stop. She breathed in, out, in, out, a song she\u2019d learned in yoga and never sang properly. It is only height. It is only space. It is only a story. She felt ridiculous and solemn at the same time.\n\nThat night she dreamed she was on the roof of Kirkgate Market and the stalls were set out like tiny empires below her. She had a pen the size of a broom and the wind was trying to steal it. When she woke she was gripping her duvet with both hands. She laughed, then pressed her palms to her chest, like you do when you don\u2019t know whose ribcage it is.\n\nOn Monday, she met the scaffolding man. He had a name like a historical novel\u2014Barclay\u2014and a handshake like old stone. They climbed three flights, then five, then Abby\u2019s body said no absolutely not and also never again, and she stopped. She was shaking and Barclay, bless him, was confused but not unkind. \u201cIt happens sometimes,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can go back. No shame. The view will hold.\u201d\n\nShe wanted to say, shame is the trick of all this. Instead she said, \u201cI have to do it.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you,\u201d he said, not a question.\n\nShe nodded and then shook her head, both. \u201cYes. But not this minute. Sorry.\u201d The belt tightened so much she thought her ribs might make a new song. They went down, step by step. It was easier to descend, which she thought was a mean joke.\n\nIn the afternoon she got coffee and sat in the square and watched people. A bus went by with an advert that told her to trust herself. The bus\u2019s exhaust coughed. She looked at it and thought, one day, I will cross that road and not think about it twice. Imagine that. She pulled out her notebook and wrote seven sentences that were not brilliant and that she did not hate. She wrote, I am standing on a low step and calling it high. I am calling this a practice for the larger altitude of love, which is also ridiculous, so forgive me. I am counting bolts.\n\nKit found her the next day because Arthur had told him she was a writer and that writers could be found in places where the chairs wobbled a bit and the cake was better than it looked. He came to sit beside her with the awkward grace of someone who has been taught not to intrude and then taught again that sometimes intruding is kind. \u201cYou look like you\u2019re reading a map,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m reading nothing. I\u2019m pretending to be useful. Do you not have a lecture to go to?\u201d\n\n\u201cDropped out,\u201d he said, then smiled, that distracted brightness. \u201cFor now. Maybe forever. Don\u2019t tell my mum. Are you writing about\u2026 this?\u201d He waved at the city. His hands were quick, like birds.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m writing about up,\u201d she said, \u201cand how my body would prefer left, right, forward, backward, any of the nice flat directions. Up feels rude.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs it a fear then.\u201d He said it like he wasn\u2019t sure whether to capitalise it.\n\nShe nodded. \u201cNew. Like an unsolicited parcel at the door. You think, I didn\u2019t order this. But it has your name on it, somehow.\u201d\n\nKit looked down at his drink. \u201cSometimes I get one on buses. Where you feel like you\u2019re going to float out through the window, like the bus is just\u2026 a tin. I googled once. It said hold something boring. Like a coin. Or someone\u2019s hand, if they\u2019re boring. Look at the coin\u2019s little scratches. Name them. It works.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou googled a fear,\u201d she said, and the words made a soft warmth in the back of her throat.\n\n\u201cI google everything. That\u2019s what the internet is for.\u201d He shrugged, and then said it more shyly. \u201cIf you want, I could ask my gran. She has advice for most things. She\u2019d say I give it out like sweets because I don\u2019t know better, but it\u2019s trained me. Or I could\u2014\u201d He hesitated. \u201cThere\u2019s a page. A guide. Doesn\u2019t fix you. But it says how to help. Do you want me to send it? I know I\u2019m a stranger. But so is everyone until you tell them a small thing and then you\u2019re stuck with them forever.\u201d\n\n\u201cA page,\u201d Abby said, and thought of her mother and her friends and Mel and all the sentences they\u2019d offered like ropes. She thought of a boy who carried bags for golfers and tuition fees and the way he watched the ground when it sloped, and she thought: yes, this is one of those small things. \u201cSend it.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d he said, and his grin was crooked and real. He fumbled with his phone, then paused. \u201cIt\u2019s not my place. Is it?\u201d\n\n\u201cEverything is your place if you step into it gently,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s the rule I\u2019m learning.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll step gently,\u201d he said, and he did, and she watched him, and she thought: my life keeps being complicated by people who are kind, and I don\u2019t know what to do with it.\n\nAt home, she clicked the link. It was simple. It said: do not force. It said: break the edge into edges smaller than your name for them. It said: breathe in the ugly way that makes you sound like you\u2019re blowing up a paddling pool. It said: approach what you fear sideways like a horse. It said: listen to yourself, and when yourself lies, answer back with something ordinary\u2014counting spoons, naming dogs. She laughed and cried like a person who\u2019s obvious. Then she printed the page, because paper is easier to carry. Even fear knows paper weighs less than expectation.\n\nShe went to the rooftop again, but not to the scaffolding. She found the car park and climbed one level. She stood and placed a coin on the wall and looked at its scratches and named them. She called one a river. She called one a scar. She breathed and did not look at the slice of drop until she wanted to. She wanted to, in a small, shaky way. She looked. She flinched. She didn\u2019t leave. She stood and felt her ribs loosen their mean metal. When the wobble came, she said hello to it out loud like a fool. A woman on the other side of the level lit a cigarette and looked at her with interest. Abby looked back and said nothing because you are allowed to keep some weirdness for yourself.\n\nThat night, she wrote. She wrote about the way the skyline repeats itself if you stare long enough, like a word. She wrote about steps and coins and the kind boy who had decided to be a person in her story without asking permission. She wrote and it came out not clever but almost true. She sent the draft to Mel and Mel wrote back at once: it\u2019s breathing, Abs. The piece is breathing. Are you?\n\nShe typed: trying. She typed: I\u2019m going to do the library bridge tomorrow. She closed her laptop. She stood up and felt the room tilt. She laughed and said, we\u2019ll see.\n\nOn the way to the library the next morning, she stopped at a charity shop and bought a scarf she didn\u2019t need and a silver teaspoon that had the word Leeds stamped in its handle. She put the spoon in her pocket and patted it like a pet. The security guard at the library frowned when she asked about the bridge; that kind of frown that means he enjoys saying no but he might enjoy yes more if you give him a reason to tell the story later. She gave him the story. \u201cIt\u2019s for a piece,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s about the city from above. I\u2019ll be quick.\u201d\n\nHe rang someone whose name was in his head as a code. He looked at her and then at the ceiling for a minute that lasted longer than a paragraph. Then he said, \u201cAlright.\u201d\n\nOn the bridge, it was quiet. The glass had that greenish bad-aquarium tint and the floor had scuffs from shoes that had not thought of themselves as brave. Abby went very slowly. She held the spoon. She named the scratches when she needed to. She answered her lies with coin-silver facts. She looked at the staircase that fell away on one side, a utilitarian trough of air. She reached the middle and put her hand on the glass just because. Her palm made a smear that looked like the ghosts were leaving messages. She stood and waited. She felt ridiculous and proud and then neither. Eventually, she had stood there long enough for it not to seem like a battle anymore. It was simply a place in a building. She went back. The guard looked at her as she left, and he didn\u2019t say anything, and she didn\u2019t either. There is dignity in not commenting.\n\nOutside, the sky was the colour of washing left too long in the machine. She walked to the bus stop and considered walking home just to name every step. But she had a meeting with Mel and Mel had a way of making her small triumphs sit up straight and do their work.\n\n\u201cI think the piece will hinge on this,\u201d Mel said, tapping the bridge paragraph as if it might wobble back. \u201cNot just the up, but your list of methods. You\u2019re not a self-help writer, and if you try to be one I\u2019ll cut your hands off and feed them to the pigeons, but you can point to the tinier things and make them shine. That\u2019s your trick.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a trick.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know.\u201d Mel smiled. \u201cHow\u2019s your head?\u201d\n\n\u201cStill stupid,\u201d Abby said. \u201cBut more obedient.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood. Keep it that way.\u201d\n\nOn the bus, she sat by the window, because she always had, because she always would. She felt the pleasant jolt of the wheels over the city\u2019s small bones. She thought of Kit, and whether he knew his online link had just written the next page of her book. She thought of her father\u2019s clubs and the sixth hole\u2019s dip, and the way steps are only frightening if you think of them as a ladder to a story you haven\u2019t learned how to tell yet.\n\nAt her stop, she got off and didn\u2019t look left or right, and then she remembered the spoon in her pocket and laughed because she\u2019d been carrying something boring in her fist the whole time and hadn\u2019t even needed it. On the street outside her flat, a man was arguing with his dog about the principles of walking. The dog sat down with all the gravity of a monk. Abby nodded at both of them, because sometimes the city is kind in minor ways, and those are the ways that count.\n\nShe went upstairs and put the spoon on her desk, a little talisman. She typed: This city is a book of slants and angles. I sit in it like a bookmark, trying to hold my place. She typed: Somewhere above me, someone is putting a ladder up a wall and someone else is refusing to climb. And both are fine. She typed until the daylight dimmed, and when she stopped, the silence was a kind of applause.\n\nWhen she looked up again, it was raining. Not the soft, apologetic kind, but the sort that beats the windows as if to say, I dare you. She thought of all the methods she was practicing, and of how people would read them and say, you make it sound easy. She wanted to write a warning in capitals at the top of the page: it is not. She turned the kettle on and stood in the steam. Her phone vibrated: a message from an unknown number, and then Kit\u2019s name at the end of it.\n\nhow did the bridge go? my gran says i can tell you you\u2019re brave if i put a question mark after it. brave?\n\nShe replied: brave. For a minute.\n\nHe texted a confetti emoji, then: it\u2019s always only a minute. then the next one. then the next. do you want to try the footbridge by the golf course tomorrow? the one over the brook? tiny height. very small trolls underneath.\n\nShe smiled at the phone like it was a person, which it was, in a way, and typed: yes. bring a coin.\n\nHe replied: i\u2019ll bring two. in case one runs off. Then he sent a picture of a coin with a face so worn it looked like a ghost. Abby laughed, that new odd sound of hers when she felt the world loosen itself from the rigid expectation she\u2019d punished it with.\n\nShe slept that night in a bed that felt more like a bed than a drama. When the rain woke her briefly\u2014spattering, insistent\u2014she turned over and thought of ladders. Being brave for one minute. The strange fact of being held up by a bridge you could prod with your boot. She dreamed of playing the sixth hole again and discovering, halfway down the dip, that a tiny bus was parked among the daisies like a toy. It honked a sound like a laugh and she picked it up and put it in her pocket with the coin. When she woke, she reached for her phone and thought: I\u2019m not ready for the top of the story. Not yet. But I\u2019ve made a paragraph of it. That counts.In the morning the city had rinsed itself clean, all the pavements slick with yesterday\u2019s temper and the brook at the edge of the golf course talking too fast, as water does when it\u2019s got gossip. Kit was already there, hood up, hair damp at the edges and a grin that arrived before his apology for being early. He held out two coins like offerings on a saucer, each more ordinary than a story ought to be. \u201cOne for each pocket,\u201d he said, as if pockets were reliquaries and the coins were saints. \u201cYou can name them now, or later, or not at all.\u201d\n\nShe took the heavier one and felt its dented rim as if touch could read. The bridge itself was a neat metal thing, four steps up and four steps down, a polite hump over a water that had been known to sulk its banks into brown. It had rails, and the rails had bolts, and every bolt knew its job better than most people do. The trolls under it\u2014by which Kit meant the clotted tangles of weed and a shopping trolley\u2014were sleepy, caught in a dream of rust. She could feel her body starting its little rehearsals, the flutter in her calves and the way her throat made its quiet case for retreat, but she made herself stand at the bottom step and shake her head like a horse swatting flies. \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d she said. \u201cLet\u2019s take them sideways.\u201d\n\nThey went up together and stopped halfway. She set a coin on the rail and named a scratch in her head\u2014river, again\u2014and then, in a new spirit of extravagant banality, named another scratch bus-stop, and another dog-ear because that was what had become of her courage: a folded-over page, not a loss but a marker. Kit didn\u2019t look directly at her, which was a gift; he looked at the brook and said, conversational, \u201cThere used to be ducklings here. My gran talks to them as if they\u2019re late for school.\u201d He tapped his coin twice, then slid it back into his pocket and stood with his hands crammed in as if to stop all his instincts falling out. \u201cYou can stay as long as you want. Or we can do laps until the trolls file a complaint.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s file first,\u201d she said, and they walked the hump once, twice, three times, until the steps and the slant and the spare air between her ribs felt less like an ancient enemy and more like a neighbour with a loud radio. On the fourth pass, she stopped in the middle and looked down through the mesh to where the water licked the concrete. She made herself look at the slim gleam of a can wedged under the trolley\u2019s crooked knee, at the filmy backs of leaves spinning toward an appointment. \u201cAll the worst things are in the head,\u201d she said, trying the words on as if they were a coat she could grow into. \u201cAnd mine is learning to sit.\u201d\n\n\u201cMine refuses,\u201d Kit said, and because they were both making peace with admission, they laughed. He bumped her shoulder with the kind of care that made contact feel like punctuation rather than emphasis. \u201cI liked your thing about the spoon,\u201d he added, and when she glanced up, startled, he looked briefly abashed. \u201cArthur showed me the draft. He said he wasn\u2019t supposed to, but he thought I might like the bit where the security guard pretended to be a bouncer to heaven.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe did, did he,\u201d Abby said, feeling for once not invaded so much as accompanied. \u201cI\u2019ll forgive you both because you were right. And because my editor has threatened to give me the pigeons\u2019 share if I start advising people, so I need witnesses that it isn\u2019t that.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t that,\u201d Kit said promptly, solemn as a declaration. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2014maps. My gran says maps are just apologies for not knowing everything, which is why they need legends.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour gran sounds like a woman I\u2019d follow into a storm,\u201d Abby said, and felt the quiet strength of the bridge underneath her feet as if the metal had shifted to muscle. They crossed to the other side and stood, unnecessary, as if waiting for a clapped-in curtain. Then they went back again, and it was the same and not the same, because repetition is the only magic that works quickly. When she stepped down at last, the ground had that surprising softness of a carpet you didn\u2019t notice until your shoes were off.\n\nThey walked the edge of the course and talked about almost nothing\u2014sand and how it gets everywhere, the rude grace of magpies, the way Leeds refuses to settle on who it is. Kit confessed he\u2019d tried to write songs for a year and ended up with four choruses and no verses, which felt like an admission of a different kind of height. Abby confided that once she\u2019d submitted the same article to two publications by mistake because she\u2019d renamed the file and imagined it would obediently become a different thing inside. They compared failures as if they were recipes, and it was a relief to treat them as useful, not currency. When they parted at the bus stop, it was with the exchange of numbers given permission by the bridge. \u201cIn case you get a sudden urge to walk over anything,\u201d Kit said. \u201cOr if you need someone to tell you a really boring fact. I have so many.\u201d\n\n\u201cKeep them sharp,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll need them blunt.\u201d\n\nMel\u2019s email arrived mid-morning as if timed to check whether her blood had steadied. It was a list again, but this one had breath between the bullet points. A rooftop garden on a low office block near the river, a gallery window that could be opened if she asked the right person with the right tone, the Millennium Square car park with a top level rumoured to have a view like a shrug\u2014that is to say, nothing it wasn\u2019t willing to own. \u201cWe\u2019ll stage this,\u201d Mel wrote, \u201clike steps. No grandstanding. If the scaffolding wants to be second- or third-act, let it. I want your ordinary miracles first.\u201d Abby wrote back quickly for once, that habit of delay untied for the moment. She said, yes to the garden, yes to the gallery, yes to the shrug. She resisted typing and maybe yes to something that is not strictly a height but is shaped like letting go, because it sounded like an invitation to metaphor when what she had was a teaspoon.\n\nShe took the number 36 into town and sat where she could see both the road and her reflection doubled in the glass like a rehearsal for being someone else. On the seat across the aisle, a woman murmured into a phone, her hand covering the mic in that futile way that never quite muffles a secret. At the Headrow again the sun did its old trick of bouncing from window to window like a child daring you to chase them, and Abby dared herself to count as she walked: slabs, kerbs, the way the paint of a zebra crossing flakes into islands. She didn\u2019t know whether this was healing or simply the only way to make her way across a city that had grown lines where she hadn\u2019t expected them, but the act of counting felt less like captivity when she chose it.\n\nThe gallery had that hush that always makes people whisper even when they\u2019re alone. A woman in a black cardigan with sleeves pushed up to her elbows came to meet her and introduced herself as Briony in a voice that didn\u2019t bother with capital letters. \u201cWe do open it sometimes,\u201d she said, tipping her head at the high window like it was occasionally a door. \u201cOn hot days we pretend we\u2019re continental and open everything. It\u2019s barely a height; it\u2019s just a different angle for the pigeons to judge us from. But come.\u201d She fetched a key from a drawer that had other keys in it and the promise of biscuits, and they climbed a set of stairs that creaked with honest complaint. At the top, the window did what all windows do when they decide to reveal that they\u2019re two-faced; it flapped a little and then held, and there was air, the cheap kind that comes free and makes you think of expensive things.\n\nAbby stood back first, then leaned in the way you lean into a conversation you didn\u2019t know you wanted. The street below was a ribbon without its bow, people dots, the traffic a teachable animal. Because it wasn\u2019t dramatic, because there was glass still between, the belt around her chest only tugged, it didn\u2019t cinch. She thought of the word cantilevered because it had always pleased her, that promise that something could jut into nothing and not be punished for its arrogance. Briony watched her with that kind of care that you pretend is casual, and when Abby said thank you, it sounded like something larger than manners.\n\nOn the pavement outside, she nearly ran into Callum. He was holding a paper cup and looking at a building as if trying to remember whether he\u2019d once lived in it, which he hadn\u2019t, although there were stories inside him that had taken rooms in worse places. \u201cAbs,\u201d he said, and the nickname felt like a postcard from an earlier holiday. \u201cI was going to message, and then I didn\u2019t, and then my phone somehow called you, and I\u2019ve been pretending it\u2019s haunted to save face. How are you?\u201d\n\n\u201cLearning to walk over bridges,\u201d she said before she could stop herself, because sometimes telling a person exactly what you\u2019re doing breaks the habit of telling yourself a prettier lie. His face did that ripple where pride and worry fight to a draw, and then settled into a softness she knew too well. He was a man who could be tender until tenderness asked for a task.\n\n\u201cYou always did like a view,\u201d he said, defaulting to a shared memory because it was safer than the present. \u201cThere was that time\u2014do you remember\u2014the car park on Neville Street, and you said the arches looked like the city had ribs. We lived on that one sentence for a week.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to live on less,\u201d she said, and when she wasn\u2019t sure whether that sounded mean or simply accurate, she picked a different sentence. \u201cI\u2019m fine. I mean, I\u2019m trying. You?\u201d\n\nHe rubbed the stubble on his jaw like it was a worry bead. \u201cJob\u2019s a job. I\u2019m doing a thing about bins at the moment that makes me think I should be more grateful for bins. My mother thinks I should be more grateful for women. She keeps telling me she has a friend\u2019s daughter who\u2019s \u2018your type\u2019. I keep saying I don\u2019t have a type. She says, \u2018women who will put up with you,\u2019 and she\u2019s not wrong.\u201d\n\nAbby smiled in the way you do when the old rhythm offers itself and you know better than to dance. \u201cBe grateful for bins,\u201d she said. \u201cDon\u2019t date the daughter. Or do. Give yourself tiny heights. We\u2019re all beginners.\u201d When they parted, it was like taking off a backpack you only remembered you were wearing once it was gone. She hadn\u2019t fancied him in months, but he had been a habit, and habits are their own architecture.\n\nHer mother rang in the late afternoon, which meant it had rained on Janet\u2019s street and the cul-de-sac\u2019s gossip had puddled under the sycamore. \u201cBrenda says the new supermarket is an eyesore, which means it probably isn\u2019t,\u201d she reported cheerfully, then paused, and in the pause Abby heard the kettle click. \u201cYou sounded not yourself when we spoke. I have been thinking about you. I\u2019ve decided not to offer advice. I will, however, say this: when your father left the ladder out against the back wall, your baby cousin climbed it to the third rung, and I nearly took the wall down with my noise. He was fine. He was fine and I wasn\u2019t. And I have been embarrassed about it for twenty years. There you are. Your inherited shame is intact.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m cataloguing mine,\u201d Abby said, sitting at the table because that was what this tone required. \u201cI\u2019m also writing a series where I climb things and call it art.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like that,\u201d Janet said reflexively, and then dented the reflex with a laugh. \u201cBut then I don\u2019t have to. When your father died I stopped going over the motorway bridge by the services. I went the long way round. I told nobody because I didn\u2019t want it to be a fact. After a year I went over it without noticing, because I was late for a funeral. There\u2019s your wisdom. Grief breaks what it likes and sometimes it mends without asking. And sometimes it doesn\u2019t. I\u2019m making a stew. Do you want some?\u201d\n\nAbby said yes, because food in Tupperware is a truce between generations. She thought of telling her mother about Kit, and then didn\u2019t, because naming a person to your mother is a test on an exam you didn\u2019t agree to sit. They arranged a time for stew handover and talked about the price of basil as if it were a heartbreaking opera they\u2019d both seen.\n\nAt the Hyde Park Book Club that evening, the writers\u2019 circle were already mid-spar when she slid onto her usual chair. Nisha was reading a sentence about a man who collected rain in jars, and Toby was insisting that jars are not historically accurate because \u201cif you were going to do it seriously you\u2019d need calibrated cylinders.\u201d Nina was drawing a map in the condensation on her glass that might have been a coastline or a bruise. \u201cWe\u2019ve been discussing precision and when it\u2019s an attack,\u201d Nina said, without lifting her head, as if that were a reasonable thing to be doing on a Tuesday. \u201cShow us your rooftops, Abigail.\u201d\n\nAbby read the paragraph about the bridge in the library and her hand shook only once. When she finished, there was a silence that felt surgical. Toby put his pen down like a surrender flag. \u201cYou\u2019ve got it,\u201d he said, surprising her as much with the generosity as with the language. \u201cYou didn\u2019t tell me what to feel and therefore I felt something. The bolts are good. Don\u2019t overdo the coins. One coin per page.\u201d\n\n\u201cTwo,\u201d Nisha said, and the rule was made cheerfully and broken in the same breath. \u201cI like the spoon. It\u2019s domestic, it resists grandeur. It\u2019s also very you, which is a compliment regardless of whether you accept it.\u201d\n\nNina looked up at last, her gaze inclined like a cat choosing a lap. \u201cYou write about fear the way people write about romance,\u201d she said. \u201cWhich is to say, you are nauseating in a way that I cannot avoid being moved by. Keep doing it. Stop apologising for it before it happens, though. That\u2019s a pre-emptive strike and it\u2019s ugly.\u201d\n\nAbby absorbed this with the grateful resentment that comes from being seen. They ordered more chips than anyone needed and distributed them in a way that felt like communism as imagined by a church bake sale. After, as she walked down Headingley Lane toward Woodhouse Moor, the sky doing that half-hearted midnight that March attempts and then rethinks, she felt steadier in her body than she had for weeks. It was not bravery. It was adjacency. It was the thing next to bravery that gets no credit but does all the carrying.\n\nBarclay rang the next morning to say he\u2019d be at the site by nine and if she wanted to try again, he had a thermos and a patience with people he liked to believe was inherited. She bought a packet of mints she didn\u2019t need and walked there with the kind of deliberation that makes a route feel taught. The scaffolding stood up like a decision. It wasn\u2019t high, not in the way of postcards, but it was air arranged as a question and her bones had always been keen to answer. Barclay lent her a hard hat that smelled of other heads and gave her the talk he gave to teenagers on work experience: don\u2019t be an idiot, don\u2019t look for problems you can\u2019t solve, tell me if you\u2019re going to do anything illegal so I can pretend I didn\u2019t see.\n\nThey climbed. She counted in twos and told lies about her breathing that she then corrected with the paddling pool method. At the place where she had stopped before, she stopped again, because repetition is not defeat but rehearsal. Barclay, who had the decency of silence, leaned against a pole and looked out across the city with eyes that had seen it be a different thing thirty times. \u201cWhen they built this,\u201d he said finally, \u201ceveryone wrote letters. Angry ones. \u2018You\u2019ve taken my skyline,\u2019 they said, as if anyone owns a line. Ten years later half of them want to get engaged up here. Humans. Can\u2019t fault us for consistency.\u201d\n\nAbby laughed because it was easier than crying, and because the word engaged hung in the air like something you toss and let fall on the safest patch of grass. She took another step up and felt the ghost-hand on her back that fear likes to be. She said hello to it, quietly, under the clank of her own footfall, and it didn\u2019t go away but it stopped pretending to be the only hand. A gust tugged at the hem of her jacket, and for a second the old script tried to run: what if you lean, what if you pour, what if you forget that you are a vessel and not a river. She set her palm flat on the metal and named the scratches again, which was becoming a litany; she called one streetlight, one cuff, one dog that refuses. The city opened in one of its smaller ways: chimney tops at the same height as her mouth, the curve of the canal like a polished spine, two gulls that had no intention of being symbolic and were anyway.\n\nShe came down before she had to, because leaving before panic has the last word is its own skill. At the bottom, on the pavement, she felt ridiculous and proud in equal measure, which she was learning to treat as a sign of correct dosing. Barclay unscrewed the thermos and poured her tea that tasted inevitable. \u201cYou\u2019ll come again,\u201d he said, less question than weather prediction, and she nodded because for once she could see the front moving across the sky.\n\nIn the afternoon she took her mother\u2019s stew and sat at Janet\u2019s table with a napkin under the bowl as if the stew might spill righteousness. Her mother watched her eat with the satisfied worry of someone who has ensured heating, food, and a criticism in reserve. They talked about Arthur\u2019s knee, which had begun to sulk, and Brenda\u2019s grandson, who had decided to move to Manchester in what was being treated as a betrayal of jurisdiction. After a while, Janet went to the airing cupboard with a look of noblesse oblige and brought out a box Abby hadn\u2019t seen in years. \u201cYour father\u2019s nonsense,\u201d she said, though her voice softened the word beyond recognition. \u201cScorecards and those pretend-prizes he called them. He used to write notes on the back. Don\u2019t read them if you don\u2019t want to find out he was worse than you thought.\u201d\n\nAbby opened the box as if it might leap. The scorecards were small violent stutters of pencil. On the reverse of one he had written, in his blocky all-caps, LEFT WRIST LIKE A SULKY CHILD; STOP IT. On another: WIND A LIAR. DON\u2019T TALK TO IT. She swallowed and didn\u2019t cry and then chose to, because choice was at the heart of the new map. \u201cHe was ridiculous,\u201d she said, and put a card in her pocket as if it were a receipt for something she didn\u2019t need to return. \u201cI\u2019m going to keep these until I can\u2019t bear it and then I\u2019ll put them back and make you hide them better.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d Janet said, and refilled Abby\u2019s bowl with the authority of a queen knighting a knight. \u201cAnd don\u2019t get clever and think a stew can cure a fear. Only practice can. And even then you\u2019ll look down one day and think, not today. That\u2019s life, not failure. Now eat.\u201d\n\nKit texted that evening to tell her he had successfully returned a pram to a woman who had accidentally rolled it two feet away from her and had afterwards apologised to the pram as if it were a person she had wronged. He added a photograph of a coin balanced on a lamppost on North Street and wrote: public art. She sent back a picture of the scorecard with her father\u2019s sulky wrist note and typed: heredity is a joke I keep laughing at. He replied with a voice note of his gran saying, in a voice that sounded like ironing linen, \u201cTell her she\u2019s not special, bless her, and that\u2019s a compliment. All brains are unruly and yours is only unusually articulate. Stroke it and send it to bed.\u201d\n\nThe rooftop garden was kinder than all the other roofs because it pretended to be ground. The woman who ran it had arms like twine and a smile that could tie things down without asking first. \u201cYou can hold the spade if that helps,\u201d she said, and it did help, ridiculous as it was, the weight in her hand a proof of gravity. The beds were rectangles of ambition, parsley and mint and a brave rosemary that had weathered a sharp frost and was now announcing its victory. From that height the city\u2019s edges softened; the traffic was a hiss, and the building across the way reflected them back in a way that made their outlines blur and improve. \u201cWe do lunch up here sometimes,\u201d the woman said, crouching to show Abby the shy beginnings of radish leaves. \u201cWe\u2019re not supposed to, but work is just life in the wrong shoes.\u201d\n\nAbby wrote in her notebook without flinching and remembered to look up between sentences. She made a note to ask Mel if she could include the woman\u2019s line because it was a sentence that carried its own chair with it. She wrote a description of the rosemary winning and crossed out two adjectives because they tried too hard. When she sat down on the bench by the corner and swung her feet a little, just to prove she was above and unbothered, she felt the belt ease one notch more. It was not progress that anyone would notice if they were measuring in floors, but she was measuring in breaths and bolts and spoons.\n\nThat night she woke at three, the hour when all the house\u2019s wooden decisions creaked, and the world offered up its old list of possible endings. She got up and did not look at her phone and took the spoon from her desk and held it in her palm as if it were a small cool animal. In the low light the silver looked like river, and she thought, everything is manageable until it isn\u2019t and then, sometimes, it is again. She put the spoon back, crawled into bed, and lay on her side so that her heart had room to kick its feet against her ribs. When morning came, grey and argumentative, she was so tired that she forgot to be afraid until she was standing on the little step into her kitchen and realised she had already climbed something.\n\nNina texted to say she had found an error in Abby\u2019s piece\u2014a place where she had called a cornice a lintel\u2014and Abby, who could have chosen to find this an attack, instead chose to learn and then complain about it theatrically. \u201cArchitectural pedantry is just flirting,\u201d Nina wrote back, and Abby laughed aloud and startled herself with the sound. Mel rang and said she\u2019d secured a fifteen-minute slot on a radio programme that wanted to talk about city height as if it were a movement, and Abby said yes without chewing it into panic because fifteen minutes is only fifteen minutes however large it feels from the patch of kitchen where you say yes.\n\nShe met Kit again at the brook because rituals make practice less lonely. He had brought a sandwich he couldn\u2019t afford and insisted on halving it with the kind of stubborn generosity that invalidates refusal. They walked the bridge twice, then took the path under the railway where the graffiti bloomed and the pigeons made their shadowy, stupid kingships. Kit told a story about his gran letting herself be talked into going on the big wheel by the docks on a holiday to Liverpool and loving it so much she went twice, then pretended afterward to have hated it so nobody would expect her to do it again. \u201cShe\u2019ll do anything once,\u201d he said, adoration plain. \u201cTwice if she thinks it\u2019ll get her a better anecdote.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe that\u2019s my solution,\u201d Abby said, thinking of the scaffolding, the garden, the window. \u201cDo everything twice and never announce you\u2019re doing it the second time. That way if you run away, only you have noticed.\u201d\n\n\u201cPrivate bravery,\u201d Kit said, and rolled the words around like mints. \u201cI think that\u2019s the only kind that sticks.\u201d\n\nThey parted near the bus route, and for once the bus came at once, as if the city approved of their timetable. On board, Abby sat and watched the roofs pass and counted only because she wanted to; she catalogued chimneys, listed trees that had decided city life was a fair bargain. She put her hand on the metal bar in front of her, felt the cold, and didn\u2019t have to name any scratches because there weren\u2019t any. At her stop she pressed the bell and stood before the bus had even slowed, reckless in the way that meant nothing and therefore could be enjoyed.\n\nOn her desk the draft lay with its corners starting to curl. She sat, picked up her pen instead of the keyboard, and drew a map that was not to scale: a spoon, a bridge, a small hump, a taller one, a set of stairs with a note beside them that read you can turn back here. She wrote under that: and here. And here too. She felt foolish and she felt safe, which was a novel alignment. She typed for an hour without looking at her word count and when she stopped, the paragraph she had arrived at ended with the sentence: The city doesn\u2019t test me; I test myself against the city and sometimes the city wins, which is fair. She blushed at it because it sounded earnest enough to wear a badge, but she let it stand because she was tired of cutting out her own sincerity to make herself easier to carry.\n\nAt dusk, when the air had that onion-skin thinness, she put on her coat and went out without a plan. She walked to the end of her road and took the turning she never took because it led to nothing but a small brick wall and the back of a row of garages. The wall was two feet high. She stepped up onto it and stood there, stupid with her genius, and looked at the backs of people\u2019s lives: wheelie bins, a bicycle with one flat tyre, a cat that had decided it had never seen a human before. She stood there for a minute that was also two and thought, brave? Then she stepped down and laughed at herself, out loud, because sometimes being a person is a prank the universe plays kindly, and she was grateful to be in on the joke.By the end of the week the first piece had gone live with a photograph of the library bridge that made the greenish glass look like a pond caught upright. Mel had cut every line that sounded like she was about to pat a reader on the head, and in doing so had kept in a line that surprised Abby when she saw it in the wild: the city will not cradle you; if it is kind, it will simply hold. Comments sprouted like hardy weeds under the article. A woman said, my dad fell and I haven\u2019t climbed a chair since; a man insisted fear was \u201cfor people without grit\u201d and then misspelled grit; a teenager left a string of emojis that might have been a translation for we are on your side if you are on ours. Abby tried to ration her glances, but her thumb found the scroll like a homing device and she felt the peculiar nausea of being visible without skin. She told herself she had chosen this and then corrected herself: she had chosen writing and the rest had freeloaded in the back of the van.\n\nThe radio studio was on a floor high enough to be an irony and low enough to be forgiven. A producer with a ponytail and a voice like oiled wood ushered her into the booth and indicated the microphone as if it were an animal that could smell hesitation. There was a window that looked over a small square where three pigeons were doing their aimless rehearsals for community theatre. The host did that warm-up talk where everyone pretends to be normal and fails beautifully. \u201cWe loved the piece,\u201d she said, her lipstick impeccable and her expression one of practised empathy that somehow didn\u2019t feel practised. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to end up doing free therapy for the city, mind.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have spoons and coins,\u201d Abby said, half-joking and half-praying to be let out if her voice did that narrowing trick it had when the belt pulled tight. They went on air and a red light came on, which always makes words feel like contraband. The questions were kinder than she\u2019d expected and trickier because of it. Why now? Did she know why the fear had arrived? Was Leeds a particularly vertical city? Was she showing off? Had she been accused of that? Abby said her bit about ways of seeing and the dignity of small practice and left out the part where, at night, she had started sleeping with her hand on a spoon as if it were a heart she could polish. A caller named Maureen said she had taken to kneeling on the landing to climb the stairs because her husband had taken the rails down to repaint them and never got around to putting them back up. Abby nearly said, I\u2019ll put them up, and then remembered radio is not a hardware shop. \u201cIf you can, put them back up,\u201d she said instead, which was either the most obvious advice ever given live or a small revolution depending on how you felt about rails. When the red light blinked off, she had the hot skin of somebody who had been brave for exactly fifteen minutes and deserved to be allowed to be ordinary again.\n\nKit met her outside because he happened to be passing in that way people do when they have made passing a craft. It was windy in the way that means Bridgewater Place had wrapped the city in one of its sulks and paper cups were doing races without permission. He was wearing a jacket that would be immediately soaked if it rained and had that boyish expression that always made Abby think of a gull deciding whether to risk your sandwich. \u201cYou were good,\u201d he said, as if good were a word that could be applied to radio the way it can to weather. \u201cGran says you made sense without trying to sell us all candles.\u201d\n\n\u201cI nearly told a woman I\u2019d nail in her banister,\u201d Abby said. \u201cI have never nailed in a banister.\u201d\n\n\u201cGran would have you practice with meat,\u201d Kit said gravely. \u201cShe thinks any domestic skill can be learned by doing something adjacent with food first. Chicken for hinges. Potatoes for floorboards. She always says, if it doesn\u2019t obey, salt it.\u201d He grinned because he knew he was making as little sense as she\u2019d just made on the radio, and it was an equaliser of the sort friendship is greedily built on.\n\nThey walked toward the Corn Exchange because the day demanded a place that was both grand and able to pretend it was only there to keep the roof off the stalls. Abby had been avoiding it because the balcony circled a hollow and the hollow felt like a mouth that might ask questions she wasn\u2019t prepared for. From outside, the building looked like a polite spaceship that had decided to pass as masonry. Inside, the light filtered down as if it had been sieved, and the walkway around the top gleamed and dared. Kit bought two coffees and didn\u2019t mention the balcony, which made her more likely to mention it. She suggested a lap. He tutted like a horse when he was pleased and said, \u201cWe\u2019ll do a slow one. We will be archaic signage.\u201d\n\nAt the first corner she felt the tug. She had expected the belt to tighten at the sight of the drop, but it was the sense of the curve that did it\u2014the way the floor wanted to take her somewhere she couldn\u2019t see. She took the coin from her pocket, the one with the smudged queen, and put it in her palm, then put her palm on the cold rail. She named a scratch lintel in Nina\u2019s honor, then corrected herself because she knew now which bit of architecture was which and pride is a legitimate grounding technique. They moved; they stopped by a shop that sold photographs of strangers and pretended not to; they moved again. A man in an overcoat strolled past and gave Abby the look of a person triggering their own memory of their own edge. She resisted the urge to offer him a coin. Kit talked to her not about fear but about a song he had been writing that had four choruses and no verses and how he felt insulted by his own inclination toward the part that asked to be sung along to immediately. \u201cI think verses are where you pretend to be clever,\u201d he said, \u201cand I am tired of pretending anything.\u201d\n\nAt the far curve she paused longer. The view down into the bowl was not a threat but a theatre, and the people below were gesturing props more than actors\u2014this girl twirling a tote bag, that boy walking as if his feet had rehearsed it overnight. Abby thought of her father\u2019s note about wind being a liar and decided the same could be said for drops. She took one breath that did the paddling pool thing and then another that didn\u2019t, and by the time they reached the place where they\u2019d started she was not triumphant, but she was annoyingly pleased, which in the new economy counted for more.\n\nKit\u2019s gran wanted to meet her on a day that pretended to be April and had not earned the right. Her name was Lorna and she opened her door in a cardigan that had seen wars with moths and won. Her house smelled like toast had moved in and insisted on cooking for everyone. She looked at Abby with the kind of scrutiny that isn\u2019t unkind but is nevertheless a test. \u201cSo,\u201d she said. \u201cYou are today\u2019s person.\u201d\n\n\u201cApparently,\u201d Abby said, and Lorna laughed, which told Abby she had passed the only exam that mattered. They sat at a table that had been properly wiped with a cloth and not in a way that performs wiping for guests. Lorna made tea in a pot and set down a plate of biscuits she announced were the cheap ones because honesty costs less to produce. \u201cI listened to your wireless thing,\u201d she said. \u201cYou didn\u2019t go in for that new fashion of sobbing into a microphone. Good. If you\u2019re going to cry, do it when nobody has to hold you up. Saves everyone\u2019s backs.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve done that too,\u201d Abby admitted, because there was no point lying to a woman who would find you out simply for lacking the sense to tell a story well. \u201cI\u2019m not noble about it.\u201d\n\n\u201cNor should you be.\u201d Lorna patted the table as if it were a person and it came alive under her palm. \u201cYou want a trick? If you want one, I have one. If you don\u2019t, I\u2019ll give you a miracle instead. Trick is this: when your head goes river, you put something stupid in your mouth. Raisin. Button. A word. The act of deciding not to swallow keeps you here. Miracle is this: you keep doing the thing in pieces until your body gets bored of alarming you. Bodies are lazy. Mine is the laziest. It will terrify me until I stop feeding it the spectacle.\u201d\n\nAbby nearly asked whether this had always been her creed, then remembered she was not here to write someone down. \u201cI like raisins,\u201d she said, because it was the most honest available sentence.\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d Lorna said. \u201cIf you die of a raisin I will come to your funeral and it will be the first piece of joy I\u2019ve had all week. Now tell me about this boy. Not my boy; he is a complication I own. You. Tell me something that would not impress me and therefore might be true.\u201d\n\nAbby told her about spoons and coins and the library guard who liked being a gate, about the rooftop rosemary that had outlived a frost because it didn\u2019t know better, about the stew that had made peace with her mother for a whole hour. Lorna listened as if she were storing the words in jam jars with labels. Kit hovered in the doorway once, was sent for milk he\u2019d forgotten to buy, returned sheepish and damp, and Lorna rolled her eyes as if the boy had been grown off an allotment and had gone a bit leggy. When Abby left, Lorna pressed a fifty-pence piece into her palm with a look that said she was not sentimental but had a sentimental streak she fed crumbs to. \u201cThis one\u2019s got character,\u201d she said. \u201cDon\u2019t waste it on a bus.\u201d\n\nThe Millennium Square car park had a top level that barely qualified as up, but it had no parapet to speak of, only that low wall with its gums of old gum and attitude. There was a brass band rehearsing in the square, not because a performance was about to happen but because someone had a key and music is a reason for weather not to matter. Mel came because she liked an excuse for a coffee that was officially fieldwork. She held two cups like she was auditioning for a juggling troupe and squinted up at the sky as if it were a set that had been thrown together in a rush. \u201cIf this goes flat on the page,\u201d she said, \u201cwe can legitimate it with a photograph of you not falling to your death.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am starting to suspect that not falling is the point,\u201d Abby said, and went up with the lightness that comes from pretending a story is only yours and not a commodity. The air up top had a different thickness, a municipal version of rarefied. She walked to the edge and placed Lorna\u2019s coin on the wall as if she were tipping the city and then changed her mind and slid it back into her pocket because private bravery had learned to like the dark. Mel didn\u2019t say anything, which was its own brilliant edit. They stood for a while and looked at the civic buildings pretending to be ancient when they were merely old, and the traffic drawing its white lines with new chalk. The brass band attempted a hymn and then, halfway through, decided to be a pop song, and the confusion was magnificent and exactly what the afternoon deserved.\n\nArthur took her back to Roundhay on a day so sharp you could have cut pastry with it. The lake was full of geese who had turned up to be admired and sworn. Abby had told herself the golf thing was separate, a parallel conversation with her body that the rooftops didn\u2019t need to hear, and then discovered that every time she set the ball on the tee and tried to look past the dip on the sixth, her heart rehearsed the library bridge. Kit joined them halfway round with his unthreatening laugh and his habit of complimenting grass. Arthur was limping harder and pretending to be insulting about everything to cover it. \u201cYour father would have told you to stop thinking,\u201d he said, which was as close as he ever came to criticising the dead. \u201cHe never had to. He was too busy arranging the universe to his liking. He used to shout at clouds. He\u2019d say, \u2018pick a shape and commit to it.\u2019\u201d Abby pictured her father shaking his head at a cumulonimbus and had to lean on her club to preserve herself from both laughter and the threatening nostalgia that wanted to knock her socks off like a sea.\n\nOn the sixth she did the steps, not literally but in her head, the two then two then two, and the dip was not deep, not dangerous, not the end of the story. Kit walked ahead and didn\u2019t look back, which had become a language between them. When she came up the other side she didn\u2019t feel like she\u2019d earned anything other than the right to breathe without commentary. Arthur hummed something that might have been a victory anthem and might have been his knee swearing in a different key. In the clubhouse afterward, they split a plate of chips and Kit told a story about a man who had fallen asleep in a golf cart and woken up on the ninth because his friends had decided the slope would be entertainment enough. \u201cThey got a telling off,\u201d Kit said, \u201cnot for the risk, but for the lack of imagination. The pro said, if you are going to be idiotic, at least be novel.\u201d\n\nAbby tried the Trinity footbridge on a mild afternoon when the river had decided to carry chocolate wrappers and rain promises. The bridge arched as if it had something to prove and then proved it without fuss. There were cyclists and men in suits who had loosened their necks. She walked it with Lorna\u2019s coin in her fist and didn\u2019t need it until the middle, where the curve made the river seem like it had been poured deliberately. She stopped because stopping had become a skill and watched a dog across the way pull its owner gently by the certainty of its desire. When she moved on, she felt the old instructions rise and then curl back like shy hair. The city, from there, looked balanced, and she thought of the word poise, which she had always considered a lie women told other women when posture was all that could be controlled. She didn\u2019t mind reclaiming it for steel.\n\nA pop-up fair arrived on Woodhouse Moor like a dream had been misdelivered. The big wheel was smaller than the stories people told about it and bigger than her day demanded; the waltzers were already flinging teenagers into evenings they would write about with dishonest nostalgia. Nina texted a photograph of a red-and-white helter-skelter that looked like an apology to childhood. \u201cI know better than to invite you,\u201d she wrote, \u201cbut this is me inviting you. We can stand on the grass and practice saying no to things we half want.\u201d Abby went because she had leaned into the habit of showing up and then choosing, and because the fair lit itself before the sky had remembered to dim and there was a mercy in seeing mechanics dressed as magic.\n\nThey stood by the doughnut van and ate the kind of food that makes you feel both healed and lightly betrayed. The big wheel turned slowly enough to be insulted for it and loudly enough to justify the bolts being nervous. Kit turned up as if summoned by the sound of coins changing hands and Lorna not long after, her cardigan upgraded but her opinions unchanged. \u201cI won\u2019t get on that,\u201d Lorna announced to no one and everyone. \u201cIf I wanted to see the city from above I\u2019d stand on a chair and be done with it.\u201d They laughed and didn\u2019t move forward in the queue. The invitation hung there like a lantern. Abby looked up at the cabins and imagined herself in one, the slow rising, the swing at the top that would be nothing and everything, the way your stomach sometimes tries to take a different exit to the rest of your body. She named three things in sight without moving her lips\u2014dog, slush, bolt\u2014and discovered that the naming did its work even when the thing named was desire. She shook her head like someone declining a dance. Nina nodded as if blessed; Kit raised his eyebrows in a question and accepted the answer without the question having been said out loud; Lorna bought another doughnut and declared it research.\n\nThey walked the perimeter, which had been planted with cheap grass and lights that blinked at no one. Abby stood on the small wooden ramp that led up to the bumper cars, the tiniest height disguised as transition, and felt nothing but amusement at her old script wanting to rehearse. She bounced gently because the wood had that satisfying give, and it struck her that some surfaces are designed to be forgiving and that she had spent so much time on unforgiving ones she\u2019d started to think that was the only material the world was made of. A boy tried to win a teddy the size of a small relationship and failed. A girl walked away with four goldfish and nerves that suggested the fish would outlive the plan. It was all ridiculous and earnest and so committed to itself that Abby felt her chest loosen in loyalty.\n\nBack home she found her mother had left a parcel on her step, because stealth kindness was Janet\u2019s version of a fight won. Inside was a little spirit level in a blister pack that had three bubbles that thought themselves comedy. There was a note: you are not allowed to use this on feelings. Abby put the spirit level on her desk beside the spoon and the coin and thought about how she was building a shrine to the boring and how reverent she felt toward it. She sat and wrote the paragraph about the fair without accusing anyone of cowardice, including herself. She wrote about private bravery again and almost cut it for repetition and then left it because repetition was the point. She wrote about Lorna\u2019s trick with the raisin and then stole it from the page because it had been a private gift and she would not buy herself a reputation with someone else\u2019s index cards.\n\nCallum messaged a photograph of the bins he had been writing about lined up like a choir and wrote: not all heroes wear lids. She gave him a polite laugh and did not enter the game of remembering their old alignment; she was tired and the world felt, that evening, both balanced and entirely not her job to improve. Mel sent a new list with three bullet points and an emoji that looked like a chrysanthemum pretending to be fireworks. A reader named Maureen left a second comment to say the banister had been put back up and to report that she had made it to the landing without kneeling. Abby sat very still in her chair and offered Maureen a silent standing ovation that was entirely made of sitting.\n\nThe next morning she went early to the footbridge with the trolls because she had begun to like the early hour\u2019s lack of witnesses. The brook gossiped, the shopping trolley dreamed, a dog did that serious sniffing dogs do when they suspect other dogs have been rude. She walked the hump twice and placed one coin on the rail and left it there, an offering to rust. On the way back along the path, she passed a runner who nodded with the camaraderie of two people doing the thing badly and on purpose. She allowed herself the smallest of grins, which looked like a person who had remembered a joke just in time to tell it to herself. She did not pick up the coin. It felt right that some days you keep what steadies you and some days you leave it where someone else might need it and the trolls can judge your generosity if they like; they are famous for their opinions and what have they ever built except stories.By the end of the next week she had learned to recognise the exact moment when her chest would consider the belt again. It happened on corners, on the second tread of any staircase that was open to the air, at the places where the pavement tipped into road with a small suggestion of stage. It happened most reliably at noon when she was hungry and apt to confuse sensation with instruction. She started to narrate this to herself like weather: belt, light southerly; belt, gusting; belt, easing. It wasn\u2019t control but it was inventory, and inventory had always felt to Abby like respect disguised as fussing. Mel, intoxicated by the response to the first piece and allergic to complacency, sent another list with three holes in it where surprises could be. \u201cWe have a yes from a man who calls himself caretaker of the Town Hall clock,\u201d she wrote, as if this were a title made up by a child and therefore unimpeachable. \u201cHe says there\u2019s a ledge and a bell and a view that will rearrange your teeth. If you hate it you can write about hating it. If you love it, congratulations, your brand will be obsolete and I will have to reinvent you as a woman who makes jam.\u201d\n\nThe caretaker met them in a corridor that smelled like wool that had decided to live forever. He had a jacket that had been brushed properly and a face that had been left out in all weather and liked it. \u201cIt\u2019s not dramatic,\u201d he promised with the solemnity of a man who has learned that everybody\u2019s dramatic lives in a different room. \u201cIt\u2019s just up where the pigeons can\u2019t be bothered, and the bell has better manners than it used to, now we don\u2019t let it bang on Sundays.\u201d The stair was narrow and spiralled like a disagreement; the walls had graffiti from a century of people who hadn\u2019t intended to become history and then had. Abby put Lorna\u2019s coin in her mouth, because it was a day for raisins and she had none, and immediately regretted how metallic honesty tasted. She took it out, wiped it on her sleeve, and held it instead, because bodies can be bargained with if you\u2019re polite.\n\nHalfway up the caretaker told them a story about a woman who had come on a school trip thirty years ago and written to him last month to say she had dreamed the clock for three decades and could he please let her come and make the dream a fact so she could have a nap from it. \u201cI told her no,\u201d he said with mischief layered under duty. \u201cI told her I can\u2019t cure dreams. Then I told her yes and brought her up here and she said, \u2018it\u2019s smaller,\u2019 and I said, \u2018so are we.\u2019 That seemed fair.\u201d Mel nodded the way editors do when they\u2019re already cutting the story into a better shape in their pockets. Abby smiled because the story went into a room in her head and sat down and refused to leave, which is the way the good ones behave.\n\nThe bell was a polite beast, dull with its own importance. The ledge was a breadth of stone that would have been a shelf if someone had put books on it. Beyond, the city lay out like laundry on a line: shirts of brick, trousers of glass, socks of field. The belt around her chest made an experimental tug and then let go, not out of kindness but because stone at this height felt like an old promise and her body still responded to those. She stepped out as far as the caretaker would let her and then half that again because fear enjoys arithmetic. The hands of the clock were larger than she had imagined because we always make symbols smaller out of respect; up close they were planks with delusions of measurement. The city was not fearsome, not from here. It was busy and childish and trying. She looked down and saw the square below doing its usual pantomime, and then she looked out and saw the land tilt into unfamiliar suburbs, and then she looked inward and saw the shape her thoughts made all day and was briefly bored by them. Boredom returned with the authority of a teacher she had laughed at and now, suddenly, loved.\n\nWhen the bell struck the hour she jumped like a person who had only ever seen a bell on television and then did that embarrassed laugh you do when you discover you possess a body. The caretaker grinned the way a man grins when he has seen this before and never quite grown tired of it. He told her the names of parts she would not remember\u2014the stays and the bearings and the hammer that is always both violence and affection. She ran her palm over the cold of the stone and named her own private vocabulary anyway: hinge, ankle, patience. When they climbed down the spiral she felt the heat in her legs and the pleasant irritation of having done something that would make stairs feel more obvious for hours. On the landing, she glanced at the graffiti again and found, among the declarations of love and football, a name she knew in a hand that could not have belonged to the person she knew now. It was her father\u2019s, written as if he had been reluctant and then committed. The year was a year when he\u2019d been young and she had not yet been anything. She pressed her thumb to it as if it could be a pulse. She did not tell Mel. She carried it down the stairs like a contraband warm thing that no one else could have wanted and that was the exact size of her pocket.\n\nOutside in the street the day had become more public. A busker with a guitar that had seen marriages was singing a song that thought it was defiant and sounded instead like a man asking forgiveness in a cheerful key. Kit phoned as if he had planned the timing, which he hadn\u2019t because he refused to plan anything that might then be asked to go to plan. \u201cGran says she has a spare tin of condensed milk if you know what to do with it,\u201d he announced, skipping hello. \u201cShe says it\u2019s for making fudge and for emergencies, which are indistinguishable.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know what to do with fear,\u201d Abby said. \u201cCondensed milk, less so.\u201d\n\n\u201cSame method,\u201d he said. \u201cYou heat it until it behaves.\u201d He paused, as if he\u2019d been given new software for his worry and was trying not to press too many buttons. \u201cHow\u2019s the up?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot hateful,\u201d she said, after a moment where she decided to be accurate, which is a kind of generosity that has to be practised. \u201cStone helps. I found my father\u2019s name scratched into a landing and did not collapse like a Victorian. I\u2019d like a medal, but I\u2019ll take fudge.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll bring the tin,\u201d he said, quietly delighted because she had given him a job. \u201cAlso my friend\u2019s band is playing in a place with a mezzanine that is definitely a hazard. Not a height. A hazard. You can stand under it and feel superior. Or you can stand on it and feel as if you\u2019ve climbed a bookshelf. Come. I\u2019ll carry your spoon. I\u2019ll be your shelf.\u201d\n\nThe place turned out to be above a shop that sold the idea of clothes rather than clothes. The mezzanine had a railing that had chosen aesthetics over comfort and a staircase that had decided to be a ruin in a previous life. The band were four boys and one woman who all looked as if they\u2019d been told not to enjoy themselves and were disobeying in minor ways. Kit stood with his back to the rail and watched her instead of the band and then, catching himself, watched the band like a boy who had remembered his role. Abby climbed the stairs very slowly and then at an ordinary pace, which was its own triumph. Up top, she leaned into the rail and felt its falsity and laughed, because she knew now that false things can hold you and true things can drop you, and knowledge doesn\u2019t stop fear but it makes it honest.\n\nThe music was untidy and persuasive. She let herself be persuaded. Someone brought around a tray of drinks as if this were a party, and she remembered the particular relief of being handed a glass in a place that expects you to perform sociability; objects are bridges too. Kit leaned in to tell her a fact about the guitar player\u2014he delivered bread at dawn, and it had ruined his relationship with sleep\u2014and she felt the press of his shoulder and thought about the shape of companionship and the ways it can be mistaken from a distance. She thought about age and the arrogance of naming it a gap. She thought about the relief of not wanting anything more than to be exactly here, not because she couldn\u2019t have anything else, but because choosing had begun to feel like breathing rather than refusing air. She touched the coin in her pocket and didn\u2019t take it out because you don\u2019t wave your talismans around when they\u2019re doing their quiet work.\n\nAt the writers\u2019 circle, the week after the clock, she brought a new segment where she tried to be both particular and generous and ended up being herself, which was a position she was beginning to consider respectable. Toby took out his pen like a sword and then put it away unused. \u201cYou\u2019re enjoying it,\u201d he said, suspicious. \u201cIt reads like somebody who has made a map and then decided to walk somewhere with no map because they trust the land not to eat them.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am enjoying,\u201d she admitted, then pulled a face because the word looked breakable in her mouth and she has always fancied herself specialist machinery. \u201cI am also bored of myself in the moments when I am bored of myself. There\u2019s a new sport for you.\u201d\n\nNisha, chewing on a pencil in a way that made Abby worry for her molars, said she had cried at the line about the city holding rather than cradling and wanted to fight her for that, which was how she gave compliments when she hadn\u2019t slept. Nina said very little and drew a gull on the table with condensation that looked as if it had opinions about everything. When she did speak, she said, \u201cYou are writing kindness without flattering us,\u201d which was as devastating and useful as anything Abby had ever been handed.\n\nCallum sent her a message after midnight to say he had pitched a piece on fear to an editor who had said, \u201cWe just ran one,\u201d and he had had to resist saying, \u201cWas it better than mine,\u201d because he hadn\u2019t written his yet. He added a photograph of a ladder leaning against a brick wall and wrote: thinking of jokes, deleting them. She wrote back: leave the ladder where it is, but tie a ribbon to it so people know you are whimsical. He sent a string of dots and then: I miss liking you without needing you. She stared at that longer than it deserved and named the scratches in it until they softened. She typed, I don\u2019t, and then deleted it and wrote, I like you, which was true and not cruel, and went to bed without waiting for his reply.\n\nBarclay messaged at seven the next morning with a photograph of the scaffolding shining like a man who has shaved. He wrote: when you want, the sky will still be on, and Abby loved him for his limited drama. She texted back that she would come at nine, then spent the hour after eight watching the kettle for no reason other than to practice being alive without rehearsal. On site, the air had that early opportunism that makes you believe in days as discrete units. She put on the hard hat and the belt that made everyone feel safe in the way that a seatbelt makes you feel virtuous, and climbed. At the second platform, where the last time she had folded, she paused and cursed herself softly for turning her heart into an athlete that needed managing. She moved again, in the way Kit\u2019s gran had taught her: sideways in her head, raisins in the pocket, coin ready to be less important than breath. At the next bend the wind shouldered her and she caught the instinct to lean into nothing with a calm hand and thought, I can choose to hold the rail in public and not apologise to the sky for it. When she reached the part where the view opened, she did the thing fearful people do that makes everyone else think we\u2019re brave: she looked outward and said, oh.\n\nFrom up there the city wasn\u2019t an argument but a diagram. The routes she took every day became lines she could draw without a ruler. The railway turned itself over and showed its belly\u2014greased and magnificent. She could see the river ribbing its way under the bridges and the people whose lives were happening without reference to her story, which comforted her in a way that was not unconnected to humility. Barclay, noble in his refusal to narrate, nodded at the horizon as if he had lent it to her for ten minutes and would like it back none the worse for wear. She stood for exactly as long as the belt inside her would permit and then one breath longer for practice, and then she came down and cried in the way of a person whose ducts have better instincts than their headlines. Barclay handed her the thermos and looked away and talked about cement and the peculiar politics of pigeons, and Abby loved him for his orthopedic kindness.\n\nShe wrote the scaffolding piece in one go and then put it down for two days and invented errands rather than look. When she did, she found that it required fewer cuts than usual because fear had already trimmed her extravagances on the way up. Mel phoned her and told her she\u2019d had to argue for leaving in the sentence that began, \u201cI am not conquering\u2014\u201d because someone in the comments\u2019 department thought the internet liked conquering and she had promised this one would be read by people who also liked not dying. \u201cWe\u2019re going to get a lot of men telling you to sack up,\u201d Mel said. \u201cI\u2019ll harvest them and plant them for compost.\u201d\n\nJanet turned up with a tin of biscuits that had been emptied and refilled with a sewing kit and announced that she had retired from offering advice but was willing to rent out a frown for special occasions. Abby made tea and admitted to more than she\u2019d planned because her mother had chosen a trivial prop and it turns out that we tell the truth around thread and buttons. She told her the thing about the clock and her father\u2019s name and the fact of not telling Mel; she told her about Kit and his gran and the mezzanine and the way she had started turning her pockets into museums. Janet listened and said, \u201cI think you have always liked a boy to fetch and carry for you,\u201d which in another mood would have been a jab and today was an observation the size of a scarf. \u201cDo not mistake his youth for a lack of seriousness,\u201d she added with a sternness that meant she had been thinking about this for longer than she pretended. \u201cAnd do not mistake your seriousness for an automatic permission to meddle. There. I have officiated. Eat a biscuit.\u201d\n\nArthur\u2019s knee gave out properly on a Wednesday and he texted a photograph from a waiting room that looked like a community centre\u2019s cousin. He wrote: stop climbing things and send me gossip. She sent him the smallest thing that would lift his spirits without pretending a miracle\u2014Lorna\u2019s instruction about salted hinges and the bell that had tried to teach her manners. He wrote: you\u2019re getting good at making inch-high things look like altars. She took it and pinned it to the part of herself that had decided to believe praise without arguing its credentials.\n\nKit\u2019s mother phoned him while he and Abby were standing on the bridge over the brook and proceeded to shout for twenty-seven seconds about the rent on a flat that had decided to be late. He answered with the patience of a saint being rung by a church that has forgotten his schedule and then said, when he hung up, \u201cI am not a man but I am a person and it is very confusing.\u201d Abby said, without thinking, \u201cYou can be a person with me,\u201d and then worried that the sentence sounded as if it wanted to be eaten and had forgotten how to be passed around. Kit nodded and took it properly, not as a romantic gesture but as the laying down of a piece of track that trains could share. \u201cMy gran says personhood is a hobby you have to keep picking up,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s stopped crocheting because it enrages her. She will never stop personhood.\u201d\n\nThey went to see the Holbeck viaduct with a man who had made it his cause to turn a disused track into a path you could walk like a new vein. He spoke in the language of planning consent and welly boots and hope. The viaduct stood there pretending to be uninterested in being anything again. Abby wanted to leap the fence and be intrepid and also wanted a licence and a guide and a handrail and a guarantee of boring success. She stood on the grass and looked up and looked down and made a note about how activism is a kind of height because it asks you to step into air and be held by something that hasn\u2019t been built yet. The man invited them onto the first span and then changed his mind out loud because he wanted, he said, to demonstrate good behaviour in case anyone was filming virtue for later. They drank tea from his flask instead and talked about the geometry of the city and the politics of benches and the fact that when people fall it is rarely a matter of one decision but a stair you don\u2019t remember climbing. Abby made a paragraph in her head that would not yet be written, because some things are better when the longing has had to do a week of work for them.\n\nThe comments rolled in and with them a phenomenon Abby had not missed and would have happily continued to miss: men who wanted to offer solutions disguised as seductions; women who wanted to mother and then punish her when she declined to be a child; teenagers who sent her small perfect sentences and then vanished because they had lives to live. She rationed again and failed again and learned a new trick, which was to forward the most irresistible bait to Nisha and Nina and let them turn it into a game that did not leave scars. Nisha would send back a single word like \u201cbanister\u201d and Abby would know she meant, fix the obvious things first and the rest won\u2019t feel like such a project. Nina would reply with a photograph of her own feet on a kerb, half up, half down, and Abby would feel rebuked and included in one movement.\n\nOne afternoon when the sky was the colour of peeled paint she ended up on Neville Street under the arches she had once loved without debate. The tunnel\u2019s lights were on like it was a nightclub that had done something embarrassing. The sound of traffic amplified itself and came back crooked. She stood at the mouth and felt the old impulse to climb the car park and mark herself against roofline, and then she stood and didn\u2019t go, and let that be a practice too. A boy on a BMX did a trick badly and nearly fell and swore softly at gravity and then apologised to himself. Abby realised that not doing is also an action, and she wrote it down in her head because she had started to collect these small reversals like stamps. She went home another way that took longer and felt like a plea and decided that slower was often a cure that didn\u2019t advertise itself as medicine.\n\nThe fair left the moor and took its small absurdities with it. In its wake the grass had scars that looked like they\u2019d been made by something that had loved you too hard. Kit found one of the coins she had left on the bridge and brought it back not because he thought she needed it but because he liked the idea of objects doing laps. He placed it on her desk among the spoon and the spirit level and the scorecard and said, \u201cThis is starting to look like a superstition that is embarrassing to explain at parties.\u201d She told him she had stopped going to parties where she needed to explain herself and he said, \u201cThen you have a better life than me,\u201d and then, quickly and without self-pity, \u201cYet.\u201d\n\nThey talked about money one evening, because you cannot write about height and not admit to the currency you are avoiding. He said he had picked up shifts in a caf\u00e9 that paid him in tips and stories and the stories were more reliable; she said she had once been paid in exposure and it had nearly undressed her in a way she had not found entertaining. He asked her how much a piece like this paid and she told him, and he flinched, and then he said, \u201cYou earned it,\u201d and she loved him in the way you love a stranger who believes in your invoice. Lorna, when told, sniffed and said, \u201cDon\u2019t tell boys what you earn until they have decided not to be offended by it,\u201d and Abby said, \u201cHe is already decided,\u201d and Lorna said, \u201cThen I will bake for him,\u201d which was a beatification in that house.\n\nOn a Saturday she went to the market because markets are flat and forgiving. She bought a bag of raisins because Lorna had made her laugh about dying of one and because it felt like an appeasement to carry simple sugar. She bought flowers and didn\u2019t give them to anyone because sometimes owning beauty without obligation is a skill you have to remind yourself about. She bought a secondhand plate with a chip that made it perfect and imagined serving her mother stew on it and wondered if she would get away with calling it rustic. Outside, on Kirkgate, a gull plotted to steal a sausage and succeeded, and a toddler wept because the gull had expressed a desire the toddler recognised.\n\nThe second rooftop garden Mel had secured permission for was less charming and more honest: planters stuttering with kale, a view of ductwork that refused to be beautiful, a wind that wanted to rearrange her hair and then write an essay on it. She stood with the woman who ran it and talked about volunteers and loneliness and the extent to which getting soil in your shoes breeds attachment. The woman said she had started counting her week in peppers and mood and that her life had improved by fourteen percent, which was the kind of statistic Abby adored because it declared itself whim and science. She asked if she could include the number and the woman said yes, and Abby felt the casual intimacy of permission that makes a story less of a theft.\n\nShe had not yet gone near Bridgewater Place since she\u2019d learned the wind there had killed a man. She had walked two streets away and felt her steps lengthen without her permission like a character in a fairy tale. One evening, because she had eaten the raisins and counted spoons and listened to bells, she walked deliberately along the street that would engage with the building and when the wind came, it came like a shoulder in a narrow bar. She planted her feet and let it happen and did not pretend she wasn\u2019t tempted to turn back. A man ahead of her did turn, dramatically and not in error, and she felt a flare of solidarity that did not tempt her into copying. She went on, small as anything, and reached the corner where it eased, and then she stood and thought of the man who had died, and she did not write a sentence in her head because some places ask you to shut up. She looked at the building the way you look at a cousin you wouldn\u2019t choose and then she went home and didn\u2019t tell anyone where she had been because private courage gets its protein from lack of applause.\n\nOn a damp Tuesday she found herself on a bus that filled all at once, as if each person had been instructed by their life to appear. The belt tugged, and the coin was in the wrong pocket, and the spoon was too far down in her bag to be a tactic. A boy in a school blazer sat beside her and swung his knees as if they were also a function of panic. She looked at the map above the seats and named stops and let her breath be ugly, and the boy reached into his pocket and handed her a rubber band and said, \u201cMy tutor says pinging it helps,\u201d and she took it and pinged it and felt like an idiot and smiled at him as if he had handed her a baton that meant she would now run faster. He got off after three stops and forgot the band and she kept it as if objects left on purpose were the city\u2019s way of telling her she wasn\u2019t special and was being cared for anyway.\n\nThe Holbeck man emailed to say the council would meet him on Thursday and would she like to come and pretend to be a citizen and ask a question about benches with conviction. She wrote back to say she would come and she did, and she watched the way power is negotiated among people who believe in chairs and in the need for more of them. She asked a question about safety that was really about fear and the man from Highways smiled like he had been waiting for an honest question all day. After, she stood in the car park and cried because she had been brave in a way she had not rehearsed\u2014out loud, in a room, for a thing that was not hers. Kit arrived late and offered her a doughnut and she took it and bit it and powdered sugar fell down her front like a decision. \u201cYou are going to become unbearable,\u201d he said, delighted. \u201cGood unbearable. The kind where people say, have you met Abby, and you say, not yet, and they say, oh, you will, and you do.\u201d\n\nAt home that evening she opened the box of her father\u2019s scorecards and read three she had not yet permitted herself. On one he had written, HATE IS TIRING; DON\u2019T PLAY IT. On another, PUT THE BALL DOWN LIKE IT\u2019S ALIVE. On the last, which had mud on it and the memory of his hand in the smudge, he had written, YOU DO NOT OWE THE SKY A FEAT. She put that one on the table and sat and looked at it and wondered whether he had meant it then or if it was a wisdom he had accidentally left behind for her to claim and pretend he\u2019d meant all along. She sent a photograph of that last one to Mel with no caption. Mel replied: we\u2019ll print it on a tote bag and then set the bags on fire and eat the ashes because we are not that magazine, and Abby laughed in a full, unflattering way she would have apologised for a month ago.\n\nIt rained for three days as if someone had dropped the city in a basin and decided to scrub it. Abby took to walking the stairs at home, simple domestic elevation that made no demands, and to practising her breathing on the landing where Maureen had once knelt. She thought of writing to Maureen to ask whether the banister had held, and then decided the dignity of not checking was a richer trick. Kit turned up once with two cartons of condensed milk and no idea what to do with either. They made fudge and burned it and ate the burn and declared it a style. Lorna sat at Abby\u2019s table and told a story about a ladder that had fallen in love with a gate and refused to do any more work until the gate said yes. Janet came with buttons and a frown to rent and left both and a kiss that she pretended not to have placed.\n\nOne morning when the sky had the decency to be blue, Abby woke and realised she did not immediately know the day\u2019s elevation. She made coffee and did not correct this gap. She put the spirit level on her palm and watched the bubbles make their case for righteousness and then put it down and went out and walked not toward an up but toward the canal. She walked the towpath until she could have named eight kinds of weed just by the posture they had chosen for their growth. She stopped on a little hump of bridge and did not get dizzy and did not name this a victory because sometimes a day is better because a day is better and not because you have performed goodness. She sat on a bench and watched a moorhen labour with its feet and a jogger who had decided to pretend to hate every minute and she felt something like love for all of them, and by all of them she meant her city, which insisted on being itself, and by itself she meant rude and kind and open and closed, and she didn\u2019t try to make a sentence out of it. She let the feeling be shapeless and heavy and enough.Mel\u2019s email arrived with the tone of someone announcing a disappointing party you will nevertheless attend. Her subject line refused to be coy: Coast? The body was all compromise and hope. The boss, she wrote, still fancied the lighthouse notion, not because it was sensible but because he\u2019d just come back from a weekend on the Northumberland coast and had the look of a man who believes in metaphors again. \u201cWe can call it out of bounds if you want,\u201d she wrote, \u201cbut I have to ask twice before I can tell him you said no. Spurn Point, Flamborough, Whitby\u2014pick a height that pretends it\u2019s horizontal. Think of it as a civic exchange programme between Leeds and the sea. I\u2019ll make sure nobody expects you to dangle.\u201d\n\nAbby read it twice and felt the belt do its duty. Lighthouses were ridiculous, she thought with a laugh that was half cough; they were the city\u2019s owls in a different costume, guardians of edges, complications pretending to be helpful. She got up from the desk, put the kettle on as if boiling water could adjudicate between inland and cliff, and looked out at the sloping terrace roofs that had always been her first horizon. The idea of the coast was a different category of up. Cliffs were honest about their drops in a way buildings rarely are; they do not flirt.\n\nShe didn\u2019t reply at once because she had learned the trick of cooling a decision on the windowsill of a day. Instead she walked to the hospital to visit Arthur, whose knee had gone from sulk to full strike and now demanded visitors as compensation. The hospital corridor had those long glazed walkways where a city pretends to be sky, and as she crossed one she felt the old script rise and, astonishingly, choose not to speak. She looked down and saw a delivery van that had decided it could reverse with panache and a nurse who had decided to tell it otherwise. She was on her way to someone in pain and it turned out that purpose was a neat solvent for the belt. In the waiting room Arthur was practicing being noble about the magazines and failing. \u201cThey have three copies of Angler\u2019s Times,\u201d he complained, as if abundance were an insult, \u201cand none of them explain how to fish without getting bored on page two.\u201d\n\nThey sat and shared grapes in the old theatrical way of patients and their audience. When she told him about the lighthouse suggestion he made a face like a man whose pint had been brewed with sincerity instead of hops. \u201cSea cliffs are an affliction,\u201d he said, then spoiled his own drama with a grin. \u201cBut also beautiful. Roundhay is just a pond that got ideas; the sea is an uncle. If you go, go with someone whose head you like to watch work. Don\u2019t go to be tested. Go because the light is rude in a way that forgives you.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou always make sentences look as if they\u2019ve done the ironing,\u201d she said, and he bowed in his chair like a man correctly accused. \u201cKit might drive. He has no fear of getting lost because he treats it as a hobby.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d Arthur said, and then, with the kindness that has to pass for permission when people love you, \u201cand ring me if you decide not to go, and I will come round and put a ladder up against your living room wall and we can look from there and tell the boss we have seen enough.\u201d\n\nShe rang Lorna from the hospital steps because the day had that brightness that pulls a phone out of a pocket, and Lorna, who never left a pot unattended, answered on the second ring. \u201cHe wants to put you on a cliff,\u201d Lorna translated without needing the preamble, and Abby could see her in her kitchen, cardigan cuffs pushed up as if about to arrest someone. \u201cGo. Or don\u2019t. If you go, take a sandwich and a secret. If you don\u2019t, take two secrets and tell one of them to nobody. Do not mistake the sea for a friend; it is a neighbour you keep peace with by nodding over the hedge.\u201d\n\n\u201cWill you come and nod at it for me,\u201d Abby asked, surprising herself by asking for company without apology, and Lorna surprised herself by saying yes. \u201cI will bring biscuits that resent the salt,\u201d she said, \u201cand I will complain about damp,\u201d which was her way of saying, I will be brave beside you while calling it something else.\n\nKit offered the car in his trademark style, which was to pretend to be unsure and then be certain if certainty would help. He turned up outside her flat with a thermos and a playlist that had been made by someone who believed in bridges between songs as well as rivers. He had not slept, which he forgot to mention until they were already on the A64 and the road was instructing them toward fields that held their green like a remembered joke. \u201cI can nap at services if you like,\u201d he suggested, solemn and incapable of hiding the mischief that always sat on top of his sense. \u201cGran says the car is for sleeping and arguments and neither should be done while the handbrake is off.\u201d\n\nLorna took the front seat like a queen choosing a throne that happens to be adjustable and delivered a running commentary on cows and pylons that kept fear busy. \u201cThat mast looks like a giant dropped his hairpin,\u201d she said, and then, as if catching herself being flippant, added, \u201cI\u2019m not being funny, Abigail. If we get there and you don\u2019t like it, we can get back into this ridiculous machine and go anywhere else. Whitby has steps that go up to a church. Steps I am willing to curse, but I prefer steps I can count.\u201d\n\nThe road gave way to that last stretch before sea, all scrub and suggestion, and Abby felt it in her chest the way a word wants a sentence. The first sight of water was not dramatic; it was a strip of pewter with daylight held in it going about its business. The wind, which is always a better storyteller than your brain, put an arm round her shoulders in a way that wanted to be rough and turned out to be straightforward. They parked in a car park that had decided not to bother with landscaping and followed the human desire-lines between gorse and the suggestion of dangerous romance. The lighthouse stood there like a certainty someone had painted. It was tall enough to be rude, but not so tall that the sky couldn\u2019t answer back.\n\nAbby stopped before the rail because she had learned to arrive twice, once at a distance and once at the thing itself. The edge dropped in that way only sea edges manage, where distance is all confession and no apology. Below, the water bunched itself over and over against the chalk and tried to say the same sentence in different moods. Birds stitched the air with the arrogance of creatures that find your vertigo amusing. She felt the belt tug its old tug, that little mean fist, and she breathed in the practical way and put her hand on the rail and counted bolts. The bolts here were not municipal; they had been persuaded with salt and insisted on being their own colour. She reached into her pocket for Lorna\u2019s coin and found it, then put it back, and picked up a pebble instead because today the weight of something from the place mattered more than the coin\u2019s history.\n\nThey walked along the path until the railing did that thing fences do when they want to pretend to be continuous but have gaps for faith. Kit kept a commentary going about the birds, names offered tentatively as if the gulls might write in and correct him later. \u201cKittiwake,\u201d he said, pleased with the coincidence when he looked it up and found he was right. \u201cWhat a name. It sounds like a toy that starts when you\u2019re trying to sleep.\u201d Lorna, who had stopped earlier than they had because she had seen a bench and sat on it with the conviction of one acknowledging the labour of glutes, waved her arm like semaphore. When they sat down beside her the bench gave a little grunt of old wood pretending to be steel. Lorna poured tea from a flask that had acquired the venerable tang of all the teas it had ever held and said, \u201cYou are doing that breathing that makes you look like you are blowing up an indoor paddling pool.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am,\u201d Abby said, not bothering to refuse the observation. \u201cIt is the worst music and the only tune I can remember on command. The edge is honest. I resent honesty almost as much as I admire it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe sea wants to eat you and it is not personal,\u201d Lorna said comfortably, as if discussing a cousin. \u201cThat is useful information. I do not fret about being eaten by the Post Office. Though it could try.\u201d She looked out, narrowed her eyes, and nodded as if awarding the day a grade. \u201cTwo gulls are plotting. I know this because one has the face of a boy who stole a sausage.\u201d\n\n\u201cI taught you well,\u201d Kit said, as if gulls were his subject and mischief his degree. He slouched in the way of people at ease and shifted in the way of people trying to disguise that they are not. He glanced at Abby and away again, learned in the choreography of not making a thing a thing. \u201cI can walk closer with you if you want. Or stay back. Or talk about gannets until you wish you were deaf.\u201d\n\n\u201cWalk,\u201d she said, and surprised herself with how clear the word was. They left Lorna to her bench and her notes on the human condition and made their way along the path to the bit where the cliffs make an amphitheatre of themselves and the birds throw themselves from the chalk as if rehearsal has never been a requirement of their species. Abby put her hand on the rail at three points and at each point refused to let the nothing pull at her. She looked out, not down; across, not through; and discovered that the width of the sea offers a different deal to the depth. As they turned back she caught sight of a sign that warned you not to be an idiot in six polite lines, and she loved it for its tone: firm, tired, hopeful. She read each line and took it as a benediction rather than a snub. By the time they returned to Lorna, who had found a biscuit at the bottom of her bag and was treating it as if it had applied for the job, Abby\u2019s breath had remembered how to be less theatrical. \u201cBrave,\u201d Lorna offered, with the question mark she had promised, and Abby nodded like a woman volunteering to read at a village f\u00eate.\n\nOn the drive back, Leeds felt as if it had been washed and hung on the line to dry. She said yes to Mel as they passed a sign for Tadcaster, because it is easier to say yes while things are in motion, and Mel replied with three exclamation points and a threat to buy her a fish if she started writing nautical metaphors. Back in the city the air closed in the way air does when streets know your name, and it felt like a hand in a pocket rather than a belt. She slept that night as if the underneath of the world had settled a fraction, and woke in the dark with her hand on the spirit level as if it were a quiet animal.\n\nThe next few days were eaten by what Mel called \u201cthe boring glamour,\u201d and Abby called, simply, the work: transcripts of conversations with a man who knew the age of every parapet in a three-mile radius; photographs of rails and their shadows that all insisted on being the same in the browser and were resurrected by the sentence beneath; emails with caretakers who had learned how to say no as a full-time profession. She wrote and crossed out and wrote again and found that she could pare the pieces closer to the bolt, as if practise had taught her which nerves could be spared and which had to be left intact for the sentence to live. The lighthouse page sat in the middle of the series like a measured confession, cheek by jowl with a paragraph about the Parkinson Building\u2019s white tower seen through rain, because the magazine wanted variety and she wanted truth, and for once those wants spoke to each other without sulking.\n\nIt was Mel who suggested Temple Works, casually, as if introducing a friend you assume everyone already knows. \u201cOf course,\u201d she said, \u201cif you want the most ludicrous roof in Leeds, you have to talk sheep,\u201d and Abby, who adored being made to feel like a tourist in her own home, said she wanted it so much it embarrassed her. It took three phone calls and a promise to wear sensible shoes for a man in a hi-vis vest to let them peer at the building through the fence while he listed the ways in which the nineteenth century had been both ostentatiously clever and criminally unconcerned with safety. \u201cThey kept grass up there,\u201d he said joyfully, pointing up at a roof that had once been a meadow. \u201cThey had sheep to keep it short. There was a boy\u2014there\u2019s always a boy\u2014whose job was to watch the sheep and it was fine until it wasn\u2019t. Don\u2019t look at me like that; he lived. The sheep took it badly.\u201d\n\nThe building hunched over its history like a proud old animal. Abby wrote notes that made no difference to the day and every difference to her sentences later: the smell of oil that wouldn\u2019t go home; the way Holbeck\u2019s sky always seemed a bit more available to conversation; the peculiar immunity to vertigo you find on ground that knows it used to be watched by a skylark. She liked that this was a height that had been inverted\u2014grass up there, machines below; a factory pretending to be a field. Later, at the caf\u00e9 near the Round Foundry where coffee insisted on being an event, she tried to explain this to Kit and ended up stealing the garnish from his cake and declaring it research. \u201cIt\u2019s not about the drop,\u201d she said, mouth full, liable to be quoted badly. \u201cIt\u2019s about the direction of attention. Temple Works is up in order for down to do its work. That feels\u2026 generous. It does not require you to pay for the view with your equilibrium.\u201d\n\n\u201cPut that in,\u201d he said, lightly bossy, like a boy who has watched you find your point and is pleased for you. \u201cSay Temple Works is a metaphor and then apologise for saying metaphor and then say it again because you meant it. People forgive us for repeating ourselves if we do it with feeling.\u201d\n\nCallum attended one of the live recordings Mel set up almost as a dare\u2014an audience in a long room with too much light where Abby sat on a stool and read about bolts to people who had found babysitters and decided to keep the evening. He clapped at the right times and afterwards came over with his shoulders rounded like a man protecting a heart from a draft. \u201cYou\u2019ve gotten sharper,\u201d he said, which on his tongue was a compliment he would not have been able to give six months ago. \u201cI liked the bit about the boy and the sheep. I always like it when history admits to its stupidities.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always liked that about you,\u201d she said, careful and warm and precise enough to keep the old habit from standing up and stretching. He asked for a drink and she said no because she had promised herself she would not dilute her victory with memory. On the way home she wrote in her head the sentence she hadn\u2019t said aloud: I miss liking you like a person and not an alibi. She did not text it because her life had started to prefer the part where she carried sentences around and let them get tired of themselves before she used them on anyone.\n\nHer mother came to the live recording\u2019s second night, against her own expectations and in shoes that suggested she\u2019d lost an argument with common sense. Janet sat at the back as if by doing so she could pretend she had come by accident and, when Abby read the line about not owing the sky a feat, took off her glasses, cleaned them, and put them back on as if the sentence had fogged them. Afterwards she hugged Abby as if they had not rubbed each other into new shapes for decades. In the car, on the way back to the house that now held no one who had written in block capitals on scorecards, Janet said, \u201cI am cross that you are better at this than I thought, and proud in a way that will give me indigestion. I don\u2019t want to talk about it. Do you want chips.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do,\u201d Abby said, and learned anew the trick of receiving a gift wrapped as an argument and not attempting to undress it any further.\n\nOnce the lighthouse piece went up, the emails changed register. Leeds loyalists wrote to tell her she had cheated on the city, to which she replied silently that the sea and Leeds were distant cousins and both owned their weather. People from Scarborough wrote to say their cliffs had been braver than her fear and she should try them next, and she put those in a folder called Later which she had learned was allowed to remain a folder rather than a promise. Teenagers kept sending her photographs of coins left on rails, and she imagined a small rash of metal offerings across the bridges of West Yorkshire and loved the secret congregation for its wit and its thrift. One woman wrote to say that she had watched her own father fall in a way no language has the dignity to describe and that she could not forgive gravity. Abby closed the laptop and went out and walked the length of the Meanwood Valley Trail until it became leaf and worry neither, and when she came back she wrote back the sentence her father had accidentally left her: You do not owe the sky a feat. The woman replied, hours later, with a single word\u2014thanks\u2014and three dots that were either patience or refusal or both, which Abby took as exactly as much as the exchange deserved.\n\nIt rained with intent one morning and the city smelt booted and muddy, and in that weather Mel phoned to say she had secured permission for something ridiculous. \u201cDon\u2019t shout,\u201d she said, and Abby sat down obediently on the one chair in her kitchen that didn\u2019t wobble like a moral. \u201cI think we can get you onto the roof of the Civic Hall with the owls, if you promise not to flirt with them. We\u2019ll put you in a harness; we\u2019ll dress you like bureaucracy; you\u2019ll feel like a clip-on angel at a municipal Christmas. Will you\u2026 try.\u201d\n\nAbby said yes and no at the same time and then, because it is impossible to be elegant with dissonance in your mouth, said, \u201cIf we do it, I want a day where nobody expects the sentence after. I want the climb to be an act and not a plot device. If I go up to the golden owls and cry, I would like to be permitted the kind of dignity normally reserved for men who do overruns on scaffolding.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will personally punch anyone who claps,\u201d Mel said cheerfully, then added, softer, \u201cThe harness man is kind. Barclay says he is. The owls don\u2019t care, which is helpful. We can walk back down any minute you want. There is no point to a height that insists on completion.\u201d\n\nKit made her tea the night before like a boy sabotaging his own youth with good habits. He didn\u2019t suggest coming because he knew that sometimes people are ballast even when they are wanted, and she loved him for that and told him so and watched him pretend not to flush. \u201cLorna wants to know if she can knit you a bag for your coin,\u201d he said, the way people use jokes to announce tenderness, and Abby said she would prefer an argument with a cardigan and they both laughed.\n\nThey went to the Civic Hall with the kind of foolish pomp that makes a morning feel like it has set out its clothes the night before. The harness man was indeed kind and insisted on telling her how everything worked in a way that had nothing to do with persuasion and everything to do with offering knowledge as furniture to sit on. The sky did not perform; it was that city grey that puts your attention back in your hands. Up close, the owls looked less like symbols and more like animals that had learned how to pose. Abby put her palm against the stone before she put it against the rail and said hello to the building as if it could hear a human greeting and decide to consider its pact with gravity anew.\n\nHalfway up, because repetition retains its power no matter how sensible you become, the belt made its fuss. She blew up the paddling pool and let herself look not at the drop but at a single brick, dark with rain, and then at another, until the wall became a thing she had walked alongside her whole life. On the roof, the city obliged with a view that rearranged familiar routes into an open hand. She did not step close to the edge because she did not need to; she stood with the owls like a person being granted a joke that had been told in the family for years and smiled and refused to apologise to nobody. The harness man told her about a time a student had asked to propose up here and he had said no because love should not rely on bureaucracy\u2019s timetable, and she fell in love with his ethics briefly and then put it down like a coat you cannot afford but have tried on for the trick of seeing yourself differently.\n\nLater, when Mel asked her what she had felt, she said, \u201cSmall, which was a relief,\u201d and Mel nodded, because hubris was the only enemy she would fire without notice. Abby didn\u2019t write that piece immediately. She let it be a private brave for a week and then wrote it in a morning with one coffee and the coin sitting on the desk between the spoon and the spirit level as if those three items could be arranged into an altar that would make sense to anyone but her. She wrote the line about the student and left it out because it belonged to the harness man and not to her. She wrote about the way the city, from up there, admitted its shyness, and kept that, because it felt true and because truth had started to feel like a houseplant she had learned to water without confiding in.\n\nOne night when sleep refused to present itself, she got the stepladder out of the cupboard and put it in the middle of the living room. The bulb in the main lamp had been dim for a week in the way some bulbs dim as a form of diplomacy. She could have asked someone to change it; she could have left it to the day. Instead she opened the ladder and climbed three steps and did not perform bravery at herself. She unscrewed the bulb and put a new one in, and when the light came on she said thank you out loud to the room, which was ridiculous and ordinary and felt as if she had passed an exam she had invented solely in order to ace it. She stood on the ladder for one breath longer than necessary and came down the way you come down from things you have chosen to mount: with an ungainly relief that improved the next step.\n\nThe morning after, she walked to the market and bought a single lemon and a punnet of raspberries she couldn\u2019t afford and a packet of batteries that all seemed to be pre-destined for remotes, and she felt, passing under the old iron ribs, that her body had remembered itself as a thing designed for ground. The writers\u2019 circle that week wanted something different from her, which was both irritating and correct. Nina brought in a page where pictures had been labelled with verbs and told Abby she was spending too much time naming bolts. \u201cWe get it,\u201d she said with her cat\u2019s grace. \u201cThe bolts hold. What does not. Write one sentence about something that does not hold and do not make it an aphorism.\u201d\n\nAbby tried. She wrote about a handrail at the back of a bus that had been polished to false confidence by the grip of humans and had nearly spun a pensioner to the floor. She resisted turning this into a call to arms or a joke about the council. She wrote the plain fact of the slipperiness and the way the bus driver had braked and thrown an apology down the aisle as if it were a blanket. The circle hummed their approval, which is the kindness you get only once in a good month, and she put the sentence in a pocket and let it badge the day without forcing it to do any more labour.\n\nWhen the Holbeck viaduct had its open day\u2014the kind where open meant a man in a lanyard would let you walk ten metres and then stop you and the stopping felt like theatre\u2014Abby turned up with Kit and Lorna and half her inbox present without introduction. The air smelled of rust and aspiration. The man with the lanyard had a patter that should have been irritating and wasn\u2019t; he spoke about benches with the zeal of an apostle. Abby stood with one foot on the old stone and one on the temporary metal and felt her insides take a photograph and file it under reasons to remain. Lorna, who had never met a project she could not encourage like an aunt, told the man that she wished him treacle for his efforts, which was a benediction in her country. Kit sketched the curve of the viaduct on the back of a flyer as if his hand knew how to steal the line and give it back improved.\n\nThat night a storm came in like gossip and she lay awake and listened to the way water makes arguments with windows and roofs and drainpipes. She thought of the scores her father had left her and the sentence about not owing feats and realised with a start that she had misread it for weeks. It was not an escape clause. It was, simply, a reprieve. It had the tone of someone loving you while insisting on your laziness not taking the lead. She got up, in the way of the insomniac who has learned not to fight, and sat at her desk and wrote a paragraph that was boring and honest and nothing like a conclusion. She wrote: I keep asking the city to cradle me and it keeps offering a handrail, and perhaps that is the same thing from a different decade. Then she crossed out decade and wrote distance, and then she crossed out handrail and wrote human, and laughed at herself, an indulgence that had begun not to make her suspicious.\n\nLorna had a day that frightened everyone by being fogged at the edges, the kind where names walked into the wrong rooms and appointments moved themselves around inside her head. Kit texted Abby from the hallway like a boy unsure how to hold a crisis without shaking it. \u201cShe\u2019s fine,\u201d he wrote, then in the same breath, \u201cI don\u2019t know what fine is.\u201d Abby went with batteries and biscuits and found Lorna sitting in a chair making eye contact with the clock as if it had offended. They drank tea and Lorna complained about her own brain with such style that the complaint had no claws. Abby changed a bulb here too and felt that same ridiculous pride, smaller than the terrace rooftops and exactly as warm. When she left, Lorna pressed a button into her hand with the slightly embarrassed air of someone who has caught herself being symbolic. It was large and green and belonged to a coat long gone. \u201cFor when you cannot find the clasp,\u201d she said, and Abby thanked her like a woman given armour and a permission slip.\n\nOn a Friday built of petty triumphs and small humiliations, Abby found herself walking past the multistorey on the Headrow where once she had knelt like a parody of ancient worship to force herself to accept a view. The light was behaving, which is to say it had no interest in helping anyone feel a particular way. She went up to the first level and put her palm to the gum-scarred wall and felt nothing but the cool and the urge to make a better metaphor. She laughed and left before she had to tell herself a story about it and went instead to the library, where the guard had a new haircut and the exact same stance. He let her onto the bridge with a shrug that could have meant I like you or I like rules that move. On the glass the mark of her last hand had been cleaned away, which was both rude and correct. She made a new smear with the care of a person rereading an old letter and deciding to write a better one. Halfway across she stopped and put the green button on the rail and looked at it and then out at the staircase falling away and told herself a lie she could live with: this is not up, it is through. The lie was useful. She crossed and crossed again until the words ladder and cliff and bell all made space for bridge, and only then did she go home and put the button between the coin and the spoon and the spirit level and accept that a shrine can grow by neglect as well as intention.The week after the button took its place on the desk between the spoon and the spirit level and the coin, Mel rang with something that wasn\u2019t quite a commission and wasn\u2019t quite a dare. She had a cough that made her sound glamorous because that was Mel\u2019s superpower, irritatingly, to make even illness look editorial. There was going to be a book fair at the Town Hall, all indie tables and tote bags with slogans, and someone had said, wouldn\u2019t it be nice if the woman who had been writing about heights took a handful of people for a walk and showed them the city\u2019s gentler edges. Mel didn\u2019t say guided tour because that was a phrase with the wrong temperature, but she described the route as if it had already happened. Library bridge because it had become a character, Millennium Square top for its sulk and its brass band dreams, the Corn Exchange balcony in a way that would make the management feel included rather than imposed upon, Trinity footbridge if the weather behaved, and then something that pretended to be elsewhere\u2014the golf course hump, or the low iron over Meanwood beck. \u201cYou can tell them about coins and spoons without telling them what to do with theirs,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ll call it a walk for people with lungs.\u201d Abby imagined herself at the front of a small flock, hands in her pockets to stop them being authority, and felt two kinds of nerves, the social and the old belt\u2019s insistence on being invited wherever she went. She said yes because she had learned to let decisions be decided by the part of her that wanted stories, and then she was sick for a minute in the quiet way, then laughed at herself, which had become a form of digestion.\n\nDesigning the route felt like laying out a table and making it look like it had set itself. She walked it twice, once alone with her mistakes and once with Nina, who had a way of pointing at a corner and saying, this will be where everyone tries to be good for you and fails. They stood on the library bridge while a school group with clipboards clattered past and debated whether a group could pass without tipping into theatre. \u201cYou stand not at the front,\u201d Nina said, \u201cbut at the edge, like a conductor with a grudge against ta-dah. If anyone claps I will bite them.\u201d At the Corn Exchange, Briony promised to pretend they were furniture and winked like a conspirator; at Trinity, a cyclist told them to \u201cmove then\u201d and Abby practised not apologising for existing. The day before the walk, it rained all afternoon with the concentration of a child painting the one colour they have, and Abby stared at the weather on her phone and decided to stop dreaming the forecast into obedience. Lorna rang to say she had a pocketful of raisins labelled like bullets and a coat that had arguments with zips, and Kit said he\u2019d come and keep to the edges, which was a thing he had learned to say when asked to be ballast.\n\nOn the morning, ten people turned up who were gulpably real. A woman in her sixties with a wedding ring that looked like it had grown there introduced herself as Maureen without fanfare and said the banister had been returned and her husband had had the gall to claim credit; she wanted to see the bridge because she had decided to be the kind of person who sees bridges with other people. A teenager in a hoodie with a logo that refused to say what it was hovered two feet away and only stepped closer when Abby said, \u201cWe will walk and we will stop and we will be boring in public and nobody will be fined.\u201d A man in a neat coat with the posture of a violin explained that his therapist had told him to find a thing that frightened him and do a version of it supervised; his laugh caught on the word supervised as if it were a splinter. Callum came because Leeds is small and exes turn up to things with the plausible deniability of coincidence; he gave Abby a crisp kiss on the cheek and took his place nowhere near the front and somewhere within her field of noise. Mel did not come because she refused to be a presence when she had asked for vulnerability from other people, which was one of the reasons Abby had let her be important.\n\nThey started at the library because beginnings should feel like continuations. The security guard had a new mug and the same frown; he let them onto the bridge with the resigned pleasure of a man permitting a secret to be repeated. Abby used the word map and the word attention and did not use the word fear because everyone had brought their own and she didn\u2019t intend to label it for them. She put the green button on the rail and told them why objects help in language that made it a story, not a prescription. Maureen put her palm on the glass and said, \u201cIt feels like the back of a clock,\u201d and the violin man laughed involuntarily and covered his mouth and then kept his hand there as if it could double as anchor. The teenager asked if he could run across, and Abby said yes and no in one breath\u2014yes to his legs, no to theatre\u2014and he nodded with a kind of indulgence teenagers can bestow when they decide not to be offended by your age. They went slowly anyway, which was the secret of the thing, and no one clapped when they reached the other side because Nina\u2019s spirit was alive and her threat had travelled.\n\nAt the Corn Exchange, a woman pushing a pram with a baby whose hair had yet to decide on a style looked up as they went round and looked relieved that someone else was doing something that wasn\u2019t shopping. At the far curve, a man in his forties with careful shoes and a face that had practised passing for fine froze so abruptly that his cup of takeaway coffee shivered. Abby recognised him for what he was by the shape of the stillness, which wasn\u2019t drama; it was refusal. She walked to his side without presenting herself as help, which was a behaviour she was trying to learn, and said, \u201cI have a button in my pocket that is so green it offends fabric. Will you hold it.\u201d He took it as if she had offered him a question. He didn\u2019t look down into the bowl because he didn\u2019t want to; he looked at the button until his breath did the slightly less ugly version of itself. \u201cIt is stupid,\u201d he said after a moment, apologising to the button, and Abby said, \u201cStupid things are faithful,\u201d and he laughed and kept the button because she told him to, and she felt a repetitive joy at the idea that her shrine could be plundered in this way and still be a shrine.\n\nOn the Millennium Square top they were joined by three latecomers who had misread the time and turned up with supermarket bags and devilish determination. The brass band were absent but somebody had left chalk hearts by the bins and a child was stamping them into democracy. The square had a tendency to make people feel watched, which is the most boring form of fear and therefore the most stubborn. Abby made them look at the gum on the wall, at the bolts, at the indifferent pigeons plotting their surgeries, and then she let them stand at the edge and feel ordinary and ashamed and proud and all the items on the stupid menu, and she narrated none of it because the relationship between a body and a wall is not improved by comment. Callum stood far behind and took a photograph of the view as if the proof of being a person worth keeping was held in pixels; he caught Abby\u2019s eye and raised his eyebrows in a question she had the new habit of not answering.\n\nThe Trinity footbridge was its usual, pretending to be modest and overengineering its modesty. A cyclist rang a bell as if trying out a personality and a boy on a scooter decided geometry could be improved. The teenager in the hoodie stood in the middle and said, almost sulkily, \u201cI didn\u2019t think it would feel like this,\u201d and Abby, careful, asked what this was. \u201cLike everyone else exists,\u201d he said, and she said, \u201cYes.\u201d The violin man told the bridge, quietly, that he had missed being allowed to look at other people without thinking it was the prelude to harm, and Abby thought about the shape of the sentence and set it aside for later, because some language deserves to be left to cool properly before you pick it up.\n\nThey finished by the Civic Hall steps because the owls had decided to bless good weather by sitting there and being the kind of gilded that always looks smug inadvertently. Abby asked if anyone wanted to go higher and nobody did, which felt like a success rather than a failure. People thanked her in the listy way citizens do when they\u2019ve been soft with each other in public, and she batted back the gratitude like a person batting away a fly that has decided it can fetch its own chair. Maureen pressed her hand, exultant but not evangelical. The careful-shoes man gave her back the green button and said, \u201cNo, I\u2019m grown,\u201d and she loved him for his formality and refused to take it, and so he pocketed it like a child with a stone and looked briefly startled by his own capacity to keep. The teenager offered her an elastic band and refused to be thanked for it, and she accepted and added it to the museum of the day with the odd ceremony all these little additions had begun to demand. When they dispersed, the square returned to not caring and Leeds carried on without her in exactly the way that made her want to stay inside it.\n\nAfter the walk she and Kit leaned against the low wall and drank coffee that had been bought out of habit rather than necessity. He had done that thing he did where he stood a fraction behind and to the side like a bodyguard for a kind of leadership that didn\u2019t want guards, and she loved him for the precision of that stance. \u201cYou didn\u2019t therapise anyone,\u201d he said as if delivering a weather report, and she said, \u201cI didn\u2019t, and I want a certificate.\u201d He told her Lorna had threatened to petition the council to rename all the railings in the city after their functions because she was tired of the way landmarks hog the nouns. He looked tired in the eyes and bright around the edges, which was his version of not sleeping but trying to keep his promise to life anyway. On the way back to hers, somewhere near the line where shops stop pretending to have anything for you and start to tell the truth about what people need, he told her that his mother wanted to move to Scarborough to be with someone who made her laugh like old cutlery. He didn\u2019t say he would go with her because he wasn\u2019t a man yet and men don\u2019t describe themselves as going with; he said he might like to see the sea for more than a day and had already looked up rents he could only afford if he also learned a trade. \u201cI am not for boats,\u201d he added, in case she pictured him in stripes. \u201cBut I could fetch, and I could carry.\u201d She felt the little tilt in her stomach that wasn\u2019t height but might as well have been, and told him that if he left, she would have to learn to carry things without showing off, and he pointed at her shrine of metal and said, \u201cYou already are.\u201d\n\nArthur sent a photograph of his knee in a stocking that had the indecency to be beige, with a caption that read, glamour. He\u2019d had the surgery and was now making a study of the physiotherapy schedule with an intensity he usually reserved for sandwiches. He said the exercises had names that turned out to be lies because clamshells did not resemble clams and bridges did not resemble bridges and he felt he had been tricked into trusting metaphors by a profession that had no right to play such games. She went to see him and he told her, as if breaking good news, that he\u2019d been given permission to swear when it hurt, and they both pretended this had previously required permission. On the way out she took the long glazed walkway and met her fear at the corner and nodded at it as if greeting an old neighbour whose dog you know by name and whose gossip you will never share, and the fear, polite for once, nodded back.\n\nThe night she didn\u2019t expect anything to go wrong, it did, and in a petty place. She took the glass lift in the shopping centre because she had forgotten she could choose the stairs and because she was carrying a plant in a pot and it looked like an optimism that might not survive steps. The lift filled at the last minute with a family, two children humming and a father who smelled like work and a mother who had the wide eyes of a deer that has learned to use the self-checkout. The doors closed and something misaligned in Abby\u2019s chest in a way that didn\u2019t belong to any of the strategies. It was not the sight of the floors slipping by; it was the fact of the enclosure pretending to move her without her consent being consulted beyond the press of a button. She had no coin within reach because her hands were full of green and soil. She couldn\u2019t put a button in her mouth because she had nothing but the elastic band around her wrist and the plant telling the truth about how much earth it needed. She did the thing Lorna had said that she hadn\u2019t yet tried in a lift; she said a stupid word into her own mouth and didn\u2019t swallow it. She said parsley, which made no sense and therefore worked, and she stared at the tiny scratch in the mirrored panel that someone had deliberated too long over and then made anyway. The lift juddered once in a way that was entirely within its rights, and the child nearest her said, we go up, and the other said, we go down, and the father said, we stop here, and the doors opened and they all spilled out into a space that pretended not to have just contained strangers. Abby leaned on a bin for a minute and then laughed so hard she scared herself because fear and relief are identical twins that refuse to wear different clothes.\n\nThe email about her father arrived on a Sunday afternoon that had arranged itself to look unthreatening. It was from a man at the council with a surname she had last heard attached to a boy in her primary school who had eaten glue and become a statistic. He said he had been reading her pieces with disapproval and admiration in rotating sequence and had mentioned her name to his brother, who worked in archives and knew how to find small facts without bruising them. The brother, it turned out, had found a list of men who had worked on repairs at the Civic Hall when they had had to scrape and re-gild and generally behave like people who believed in owls. Her father\u2019s name was on it with a date that made sense of the inscription on the stair. There was a photograph too, not of her father because the camera had been pointed at hierarchy, but of a line of men at a window with their backs to the city, one of whom had the slope of shoulder that meant work had been done and would be done again. She forwarded the email to her mother with no commentary because she didn\u2019t trust herself to add dignity to the fact by manufacturing sentiment. Janet rang five minutes later with the sound of onion hitting oil behind her and she said, \u201cI always told him to keep his feet on something that wouldn\u2019t move,\u201d and then, because love and irritation are rarely separated for long in that house, she added, \u201cand of course he ignored me in the way that has built our city,\u201d and they both breathed and set the fact down between them like a warm loaf.\n\nShe went back to the sixth at Roundhay on purpose at dusk because it was the dip that had taught her the shape of her new faith. The light was that generous northern light that doesn\u2019t perform and therefore feels earned. A dog ran ahead with the arrogant generosity of dogs, and somebody\u2019s Bluetooth speaker was trying to infiltrate the evening with happiness in a key Abby didn\u2019t accept. She put the ball down because she had promised herself she would sometimes obey her father\u2019s more useful notes. She walked down the dip and up again without thinking of it as a drop because it wasn\u2019t; it was a practice for the part of her that wanted to run toward edges with a plan and then refuse once the edge arrived. Kit arrived halfway down because he had decided to be exactly late, and he matched her without looking and told her a story about a ferris wheel on Scarborough seafront that wasn\u2019t a ferris wheel at all but a round of lights that made promises and then delivered glow instead. They stood at the flag and stared at the hole as if the ground had come up to meet them and not the other way round, and she reached into her pocket for Lorna\u2019s coin and didn\u2019t find it because it had been adopted, and instead put the elastic band on the lip of the cup and watched it sit there like a lazy HALO. Then she flicked it with a finger so it jumped into the hole and laughed in the way of a person who had just given a gift to the smallest church in West Yorkshire.\n\nIn the days that followed she wrote a sentence that she cut and then restored because she was tired of denying herself the permission to be simple; it said that the city had been asking her all along not to levitate but to lean. She visited Lorna and found the fog had gone and the wit had been left folded on the sofa and was being re-worn with pride; they ate stew and complained about politicians like it would keep the pipes warm. Kit\u2019s mother decided not to move because the cutlery man had a boat, which Kit refused to pretend could be sat on without committing to a narrative, and Abby did not call this a reprieve out loud. Mel sent back the draft with fewer cuts than usual and a margin note that said, you are letting yourself be unfashionable and it is generating fashion, and Abby sighed and allowed herself an unbecoming grin.\n\nOne evening, when the city had elected to smell like rain even though it wasn\u2019t raining, she walked under Neville Street\u2019s arches and looked at the light installation which was less and more than everyone had promised her. A boy was perched higher than was sensible with a marker pen, etching a neat signature that would be wiped tomorrow like a child\u2019s muddy handprint on a clean door. He glanced down at her with the casual cruelty of youth and said, you writing about us then, and she said, I am writing about me and you are getting in the way, and he laughed because he recognised himself in any refusal to flatter. She offered him a coin on the miracle chance that he might know what to do with it and he said he preferred plastic because it lasted longer and threw his pen to his friend like a prophecy. She left him where he was and went home by the long route and named the scratches on the evening until it behaved.\n\nMel called with a suggestion that felt less like a challenge and more like a confession. A brand wanted to sponsor the last piece, they wanted their logo to kiss the bottom of the page, and Mel wanted to say no because she was sick of making everything pay for itself but also yes because she was tired and the roof at Temple Works wasn\u2019t going to become a meadow of integrity simply because Abby had a line about it. Abby listened and pictured the owl and the rail and the boy with the pen and the elastic band at the lip of the cup, and said, \u201cLet them in if they promise to sit quietly in the back,\u201d and Mel laughed and promised to make them sit on folding chairs with their knees together. They were allowed to keep being principled and still go out for dinner sometimes; this was a relief so profound it felt like a sin.\n\nJanet, in the way she had developed of providing care disguised as a nuisance, rang to say that Brenda had demanded a reading list for \u201cgetting over it\u201d and she would prefer not to have to use the internet because it made her sound rude in public; could Abby oblige. Abby said she could supply Brenda with her hard-won methods if Brenda would agree not to return them with red pen on the margins. The next day a piece of paper was pushed through her letterbox with a stew recipe on one side and three words on the other in Janet\u2019s handwriting: spoons, bolts, friends. Abby stuck it to the fridge with a magnet shaped like a pear and considered that as summaries went, it could be stitched on a sampler and not betray too much.\n\nThe walk gave birth to more, because that is the trouble with success; it multiplies your chores. A school wrote to ask if she would take ten teenagers on the short route and make it not boring, and Abby said she would only do it if they were allowed to be bored, and the teacher laughed with relief because she had already failed at entertaining them out of the abyss. A charity asked if she would come and talk to people who had fallen and were not ready to climb stairs for any reason, and Abby agreed in a way that made it a conversation rather than her standing at the front pretending to be better. She learned, at a rate that felt like learning, to hold space without holding herself up for judgement, and she did it badly and then she did it better, which is the only arc anyone should trust.\n\nAt the Holbeck open day\u2019s second hour, the man in the lanyard said benches like a prayer and Abby stayed silent and let him have his religion. She stood with a woman who wore her grief like a coat and they looked out over land that wanted to be gentle and would have to fight for it, and the woman said, \u201cThank you for making an altar out of a railing,\u201d and Abby, who had been told by men with opinions that she had commodified courage, felt the clean click of a judgment she did trust and took it home and put it on the desk where the coin and the spoon and the spirit level had started to look less like props and more like a family photograph.\n\nWhen the series finally went to print as a small book that smelled like glue and dared you to love it despite the photographs being slightly greener than they had been on her screen, they held a launch in a low room and put crisps in bowls and asked people to borrow their own chairs back from other rooms. Abby read the paragraph about the bell and the part about not owing the sky anything, and she didn\u2019t read the lift, because lifts were for parsley and private modernity. Callum clapped and didn\u2019t try to talk to her after because he had learned too, and her mother joined a queue to buy a copy as if she were a stranger, and Kit hid at the back and then pushed through and presented her with a lump of fudge that had been salted to within an inch of its life, and Lorna signed the inside of Abby\u2019s book as if it had been dedicated to her by a universe that knew both of them by name. Mel made a speech that accused Abby of being both work and relief and threatened to make jam of her if she took it for granted. They finished the night by standing in the street and being cold and sure, and Abby felt the city lay its usual rough hand on her shoulder and leave it there, which was the form of tenderness she had always understood best.\n\nLater, alone in the flat that had seen her kneel and stand, she took the ladders out of the cupboard and put them back because they had become tools and no longer symbols, which for a writer is a sacrilege and a healing. She cleaned the smear off the library bridge with the corner of a sleeve in a daydream and then made a new smear, which was how stories were being told now: not to erase, but to reapply. She put the button and the coin and the elastic band and the spirit level in a shallow bowl that had once been a Christmas present from a cousin who failed to understand her and turned out to know everything, and she sat down and wrote three sentences about something that didn\u2019t hold and resisted the temptation to make them mean more than that. When she went to bed she lay on her side to give her heart room to beat its ridiculous beat against the rib that had donated its metaphor to a hundred pages, and she slept, if not like a child then like a person who was allowed to count themselves present without apology.",

                              "content": "She noticed the fear first as a slow tightening, like a belt cinching around her chest while she was only standing at the foot of the library steps. The steps weren\u2019t high, they barely rose above the cobbled square, but a sudden wash of air and space above them made her throat pinch and her eyes start their shivery flicker, the way they do when your body is about to invent a new rule for living. It was late March, sunlight bouncing off slick windows on the Headrow, buses dragging their weary chests through the city like beasts that have been ridden too hard for too long. Abby stood still and looked at the unremarkable flight of stone. A gull wheeled overhead. Something slipped.\n\nShe made herself climb. Nothing bad happened, and yet everything did, because she knew she\u2019d felt it. She pressed her palm to the cool pillar and breathed, slow in, slower out, trying to tether herself to the stone, to Leeds, to the map in her head of all the ways home.\n\nLater she laughed about it to Mel at the pub, only she was the only one laughing. \u201cYou\u2019re not serious,\u201d Mel said, blowing a fringe out of her eyes. Mel\u2019s a woman with a collection of enamel pins and an attitude that made editors flinch. Abby liked to believe they were similar. \u201cYou write about the world, Abby. Heights are part of the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t even a height,\u201d Abby said. They were in the Whitelocks, one of those places that smells like beer has prestige. Table by the window. Light catching the dust and making it seem like something soft and purposeful. \u201cIt was the thought of it. The hint. The idea of what it would be like if the ground decided to unhook itself, you know? If I looked over an edge and the city just, I don\u2019t know, tipped.\u201d\n\nMel made a face. \u201cYou need a pint. You need a holiday.\u201d\n\n\u201cI need a new nervous system. Where do you buy those?\u201d\n\n\u201cOn Kirkgate Market, stall forty-two. They do two for one on Tuesdays.\u201d Mel leaned in. \u201cYou sure you\u2019re not being dramatic? You\u2019re brilliant at being dramatic and it\u2019s part of your charm. But the pieces we\u2019ve talked about\u2014there are rooftops in those, Abby. Rooftops and cable cars and one ill-advised suggestion from my boss about a lighthouse. And you\u2019re always saying Leeds deserves to be seen from above, yeah?\u201d\n\nAbby smiled, because her face had been trained for years to do it on cue. Inside, the little belt around her chest tightened another notch. She used to clamber onto car parks just for the view, used to press up to hotel windows and paint the city with her finger in the air\u2014calls and cranes and the old clock towers. But when she tried to picture those now, she felt the suggestion of a missing railing. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m just tired. I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\n\nOn the walk home along Briggate, she detoured into the arcade and let herself be charmed by all those gilt ribs curving over her head. Nothing to fall from, unless the sky itself decided to turn inside out. She took the bus back up to Chapel Allerton and leaned against the window and watched rooftops trickle by like a memory she was trying to catch before it slid down the plug. The man in the seat opposite was watching a video loudly; she heard the tinny rise of a pop chorus, and then someone\u2019s voice telling him to \u201csort it out, pal,\u201d and then the no-voice of everyone else, looking at their laps. The bus puttered and bucked and braked just in time for nobody to fall.\n\nAt home she stood at the kitchen window and looked at the lean against of the sky. A roofline, a chimney. A little slope. She made tea and wrote. That is to say, she sat and tapped keys so quietly they might have been a mouse. She told herself that she would not go on Twitter, she would not google \u201cfear of heights, suddenly\u201d because she knew what would happen: she\u2019d end up on a forum where people with pseudonyms described how they\u2019d never left their own beds again. And she was not ready to be a pseudonym.\n\nIt was midnight when Callum rang. Not because he wanted to talk\u2014because he had somehow set his phone to dial her when he stuck it in his pocket, the way you do when your life is a chain of accidents. \u201cCal?\u201d she said, and then she heard a muffled chorus of voices and one that was undoubtedly his because he always sounded like a boy caught in a fence. \u201cCal, I can hear you.\u201d\n\nHe came on a second later, breathing into the line. \u201cAbby. Didn\u2019t mean to. Sorry.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo worries,\u201d she said, and it wasn\u2019t, not really, because their break had been the opposite of dramatic; it had been slow and lacked edges. But later he messaged: You OK? She typed: yeah, developed a new fear, look at me, growing. Then she deleted it. She typed nothing at all.\n\nIn the morning she walked to Meanwood Park, because trees are vertical and not frightening. She stood on the little slope where the ground rose to meet the canopy and tried to trick herself into believing the ground was above her and the sky below. It didn\u2019t work, but for a moment she felt a remembering of afternoon games with her father, when he\u2019d tell her the trick to golf was not to hit the ball but to let it go. She\u2019d never once let anything go in her whole life, not really. Golf had been an aberration, and it had been his. When he\u2019d died, she\u2019d put the clubs in a cupboard and said she was done. The cupboard had a keyhole and when she passed it sometimes, she could feel the cold eye of it on her.\n\nBack home she opened her email. Mel had sent a detailed list of how the next two months would go if Abby agreed to the city-above-city piece. Rooftop gardens, scaffolding tours, the bridge on the top of the library where nobody goes because it\u2019s \u201conly staff\u201d and a man with a key had promised he might let her up. \u201cImagine the photos,\u201d Mel wrote. \u201cIt\u2019ll be like sternum music. Your words + those lines. People will stop and breathe. If you let me, we\u2019ll do this.\u201d\n\nAbby said yes. She said yes because it was the only shape her mouth knew how to make when a door condensed in front of her. Then she sat and felt sick.\n\nShe told her mother in the way of a person dropping to their knees on a bus just to feel the grounding, which is to say, she did it at the end of a call about something else. \u201cI\u2019m writing about heights,\u201d she said, swallowing her voice like hot tea. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not, at this moment, brilliant at heights.\u201d\n\n\u201cSince when?\u201d Janet Sutcliffe\u2019s voice always came through like something neighbourly, a cardigan. \u201cYou were always clambering on things when you were a kid. Irresponsible. There might be a correlation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks, Mum.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just saying, if you are anxious now, why pick a subject that has \u2018fall\u2019 written into it? There are things you can write about without dangling yourself off them. Cake.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to dangle.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood, because who do you think you are, James Bond? You were scared of the steps up to the slide for a year when you were three. I had to go up and push you down. Do you remember? You howled the whole way back up. The man watching said, brave little soldier, isn\u2019t she. He knew nothing about you.\u201d\n\nAbby closed her eyes. The little belt found a new notch. \u201cIt\u2019s not like that. It\u2019s not that I want to\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThen don\u2019t,\u201d her mother said. \u201cYou have options. Take the easy ones for once and you\u2019ll live longer. There. You\u2019ll say I\u2019m negative, but I\u2019m a realist, Abigail. Don\u2019t get cross. I have to go; Brenda\u2019s at the door with a trifle, and if I stand here too long she\u2019ll catch cold through the glass like my mother used to say you get. Put on thicker skin. Or a thicker coat.\u201d\n\nAfter the call, Abby set her phone face down like that might stop the stream of the world coming at her. She thought about lies, and how they weren\u2019t always mean-spirited. She could say she had a cold. She could say the scaffolding man never found his key. She could deliver a smaller version of the thing she\u2019d promised and trust that nobody outside herself would notice. She could do what she had done too many times: make a careful story about not being brave and give it a word like careful, like wise.\n\nShe put on her boots and got on another bus. When in doubt, move. When in doubt, go to something that looks like the thing you\u2019re afraid of, but smaller. She went to the car park on The Calls, the one that had that view across to the dark boulders of the railway arches. She had taken photographs from the top level there, once. She had laughed into the wind. Now she went up only one flight, then the next. Her hands trembled with that peculiar mix of privacy and theatre humans live for; she thought of all the CCTV cameras tunnelling her like light. She reached the third level. Wind. She turned a corner and saw the slice of the gap. It was only a slice. Only a sliver where the city slipped under and stood back up somewhere else, perfectly normal and unremarkable, but she felt it like a cliff.\n\nA boy in a baseball cap threaded past her, chewing something, and rolled his eyes at his phone. A van coughed. Across the river, someone rattled a shutter. The past is always noisier than the present. Abby took a breath and moved closer to the low wall. There was gum on it, pale fossils too many to count. She lifted her phone to capture the arches. Her hands shook. The phone wobbled. She thought: what if I drop it. She thought: what if I can\u2019t stop, what if everything liquid in me rushes outward toward that edge, what if I pour.\n\nShe tried anyway. The photograph was poor. She took another and it was better, and then she did what her body wanted to do: she turned away and put the wall at her back so that the city could do what it wanted without her knowing about it. She walked back along the concrete lane, counted the bolts in the railings, forced herself to look down through the gaps because slow looking can trick panic into telling the truth. She made it back to the stairs. She made it down. The muscles in her shins buzzed like somebody had left lights on inside them.\n\nIn the afternoon, her writers\u2019 circle met at the Hyde Park Book Club and she almost didn\u2019t go, because everybody there is tenderly cruel in the way writers sometimes are. They they can map a wound, point to its address on your page with a pen and say, here, this is where you broke yourself, and in being so precise they can sometimes spell it as care. Abby loves them and hates them in proportions that shift with the light. She slipped into a chair and ordered a coffee so strong it could probably be seen from Otley.\n\n\u201cAbigail!\u201d said Nisha, who never called anyone by their short name. \u201cHave we got three extracts today? Mel said you were on fire.\u201d She made a sizzling noise and Abby pretended to be charred.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve said yes to the rooftop series,\u201d she told them, because she knew if she said it out loud enough times it would become a fact and not a dangerous verb. \u201cWe\u2019ll see Leeds from heights no one bothers with. We\u2019ll give them a map of all the lines. I\u2019ll probably grow gills.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you need a harness,\u201d said Toby, who wrote about industrial heritage and whose idea of a good time was pointing at a lever and telling you how it was made. \u201cBecause I have a man. He\u2019s worked on\u2026 everything.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need a harness.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust don\u2019t fall off anything,\u201d Nina said. Nina never told a joke that didn\u2019t sound like a dropped stitch. \u201cThat\u2019s my professional advice to you.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you, Nina, I\u2019ll try not to fall off anything.\u201d Abby said it lightly, because they all took their turns at being the one who needed an audience. Still, when they read her draft paragraph aloud\u2014the one about the arcade\u2019s bones and the sense that you could hear the city thinking when you climbed a little higher than anyone else\u2014Toby circled a sentence and crossed it out. \u201cSoft,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can do better. Don\u2019t cower.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not cowering,\u201d she said, and then looked at the line he\u2019d crossed out and wanted to hide inside it.\n\nAfter, she walked through the drizzle up to Woodhouse Ridge with Nina. The path was slick and smelled like leaf and smoke, that Novemberish smell that shouldn\u2019t belong to March, but Leeds does what it wants with its weather. \u201cYou\u2019re really anxious,\u201d Nina said, stating it simply as if naming a colour.\n\n\u201cJust a bit. It\u2019ll be fine.\u201d Abby shoved her hands in her jacket. \u201cI used to climb car parks for fun.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome of that was showing off.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to say.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome of all our things are showing off. You can love that part too.\u201d\n\nThey turned and looked back at the patchwork of the city, as seen at an angle where nothing had to be vertical. The skyline was a set of blunt teeth, cranes like hairpins. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s just my age,\u201d Abby said. \u201cMaybe your body decides someday that the whole earth is made of trousers without a belt. And you reach down, and they\u2019re not there.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood image,\u201d Nina said. \u201cPut it in.\u201d\n\nShe went home and opened her father\u2019s cupboard. The key turned in that satisfying way that keys have when they haven\u2019t been wriggled at a door in a while. The clubs were wrapped in a towel that had once been white and was now a chronology of grass. She lifted one. It felt like a limb you could pretend not to own. She swung it in the kitchen experimentally and nearly knocked the lampshade off, then swore, then laughed, because it was ridiculous, then cried because it wasn\u2019t.\n\nGolf had always been a way to explain systems to herself. Wind and angle, stubbornness and release. She had hated the men who owned the club in Moortown because they always called her sweetheart and then watched her like hunters, but she had loved the fairways when the light was low and the birds skittered out ahead like they were there just for her to chase them. She messaged Mel and said: mad idea. What if we did a piece from a different kind of height? The low kind. The ridge of a green. Light on a slope. She didn\u2019t send it. She saved it to drafts. She put the club back and it caught on the lip of the towel and fell, making a noise that sounded like a gulp. She steadied herself against the counter and laughed again, an ugly sound.\n\nHer father\u2019s old friend, Arthur, messaged the next day. He had a way of knowing when she\u2019d opened a door. maybe tea? haven\u2019t seen you long. fancy a knock round saturday? nothing serious. i\u2019ll carry your bag if you carry my awful conversation.\n\nShe typed: I don\u2019t have a membership. He typed back: guest. or we go municipal. Roundhay\u2019s cheap and cheerful. she typed: ok. And that was how she found herself at a tee on a Saturday morning with a jacket that didn\u2019t quite keep out the sharpness of the wind and a knot in her chest that had started to feel like a given. It wasn\u2019t a height, not exactly. But there were slopes, edges. And there were those tee boxes that looked out over something that was not exactly a drop but pretended well enough.\n\nArthur put a hand on her shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s only grass,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it tries to kill you, I\u2019ll tackle it to the ground. How are you, Abby?\u201d\n\n\u201cBetter if we don\u2019t talk,\u201d she said, and he laughed, and they did not talk much, and she was grateful. A boy with a fleece that had the club\u2019s logo on it came to take Arthur\u2019s bag, and she didn\u2019t mean to look at his face like that, like he was a code to be cracked, but she was a writer, and writing doesn\u2019t stop because your nerves have decided to go on strike. The boy was probably twenty. Dark hair, eyes that had a way of waiting for you to say the next thing. He kept glancing at his phone in his pocket and then apologising as if it were a personal failing.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t her caddy, not then, not for her, because she\u2019d never think to ask. But he was there, and he walked behind them, and when she looked back he gave her that curious smile that people give to other people when there\u2019s a story hovering above them like a weather system. He lifted Arthur\u2019s bag up as if it wasn\u2019t a sack of iron but something that thought itself light. \u201cKit,\u201d he said. \u201cLike the cat. Hi.\u201d\n\n\u201cHi,\u201d she said, telling herself she was a person who believes in coincidences without expecting them to behave. \u201cI\u2019m Abby. Sorry if we\u2019re slow.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like there\u2019s anywhere else more interesting.\u201d He looked up at the treeline and then at the next tee. \u201cUnless you like standing perfectly still in a car park and trying not to be watched by pigeons.\u201d\n\nShe grinned despite herself. \u201cI used to. I\u2019ve retired from that life.\u201d\n\n\u201cCongratulations,\u201d he said. \u201cI always thought pigeons were in MI5.\u201d\n\nThey played. Or rather, Arthur played and Abby remembered. How to breathe and swing and let her head stay still; how to watch the ball\u2019s white travel. On the sixth, where the ground ran down and then up again like it was practising being sea, she felt the wobble that meant her body thought this was height even when it wasn\u2019t. She held the club and looked at the flag, a simple thing flopping in a plain wind. She could walk down into that dip and up again just as ordinary as a person can, and yet.\n\n\u201cIt helps to look at the ground two steps in front,\u201d Kit said, not unkindly, as if he\u2019d handed her a sweet. \u201cNot ahead at the dip. You\u2019ll look ahead when you want to, not before. Steps. That\u2019s what my gran says, anyway. She says all the worst things are in the head and the head is stupid and has to be tricked.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am well aware my head is stupid,\u201d Abby said, and took two steps, then two more, and found that the world did not pull at her. She did not look up at the slice of drop; she looked at her own boots, and then at Arthur\u2019s hand as he pretended to swat a fly from the air and ended up swatting nothing. The grass hissed. She moved through the dip as if walking down a memory.\n\nAfter, in the clubhouse, Kit drank a Coke and chewed the straw and glanced at his phone again, that habitual twitch young people have when the world\u2019s telling them there\u2019s an instruction they haven\u2019t read yet. He didn\u2019t look at Abby but she felt the hum of his attention. She told herself she was imagining it. She eavesdropped on Arthur telling a story about a bunker that had been \u201cimpossible\u201d and how he\u2019d blasted out in one go like a man who knew how to kick luck\u2019s door in.\n\nThe rooftop piece loomed. Mel messaged her with a photo of the scaffolding guy holding a hard hat like a theatre prop. \u201cHe\u2019s keen,\u201d Mel wrote. \u201cHe says the view will make you write like you\u2019ve just learned the word for sky.\u201d Abby set the phone down and it glowed anyway, the way phones do, you can\u2019t make them stop. She breathed in, out, in, out, a song she\u2019d learned in yoga and never sang properly. It is only height. It is only space. It is only a story. She felt ridiculous and solemn at the same time.\n\nThat night she dreamed she was on the roof of Kirkgate Market and the stalls were set out like tiny empires below her. She had a pen the size of a broom and the wind was trying to steal it. When she woke she was gripping her duvet with both hands. She laughed, then pressed her palms to her chest, like you do when you don\u2019t know whose ribcage it is.\n\nOn Monday, she met the scaffolding man. He had a name like a historical novel\u2014Barclay\u2014and a handshake like old stone. They climbed three flights, then five, then Abby\u2019s body said no absolutely not and also never again, and she stopped. She was shaking and Barclay, bless him, was confused but not unkind. \u201cIt happens sometimes,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can go back. No shame. The view will hold.\u201d\n\nShe wanted to say, shame is the trick of all this. Instead she said, \u201cI have to do it.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you,\u201d he said, not a question.\n\nShe nodded and then shook her head, both. \u201cYes. But not this minute. Sorry.\u201d The belt tightened so much she thought her ribs might make a new song. They went down, step by step. It was easier to descend, which she thought was a mean joke.\n\nIn the afternoon she got coffee and sat in the square and watched people. A bus went by with an advert that told her to trust herself. The bus\u2019s exhaust coughed. She looked at it and thought, one day, I will cross that road and not think about it twice. Imagine that. She pulled out her notebook and wrote seven sentences that were not brilliant and that she did not hate. She wrote, I am standing on a low step and calling it high. I am calling this a practice for the larger altitude of love, which is also ridiculous, so forgive me. I am counting bolts.\n\nKit found her the next day because Arthur had told him she was a writer and that writers could be found in places where the chairs wobbled a bit and the cake was better than it looked. He came to sit beside her with the awkward grace of someone who has been taught not to intrude and then taught again that sometimes intruding is kind. \u201cYou look like you\u2019re reading a map,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m reading nothing. I\u2019m pretending to be useful. Do you not have a lecture to go to?\u201d\n\n\u201cDropped out,\u201d he said, then smiled, that distracted brightness. \u201cFor now. Maybe forever. Don\u2019t tell my mum. Are you writing about\u2026 this?\u201d He waved at the city. His hands were quick, like birds.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m writing about up,\u201d she said, \u201cand how my body would prefer left, right, forward, backward, any of the nice flat directions. Up feels rude.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs it a fear then.\u201d He said it like he wasn\u2019t sure whether to capitalise it.\n\nShe nodded. \u201cNew. Like an unsolicited parcel at the door. You think, I didn\u2019t order this. But it has your name on it, somehow.\u201d\n\nKit looked down at his drink. \u201cSometimes I get one on buses. Where you feel like you\u2019re going to float out through the window, like the bus is just\u2026 a tin. I googled once. It said hold something boring. Like a coin. Or someone\u2019s hand, if they\u2019re boring. Look at the coin\u2019s little scratches. Name them. It works.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou googled a fear,\u201d she said, and the words made a soft warmth in the back of her throat.\n\n\u201cI google everything. That\u2019s what the internet is for.\u201d He shrugged, and then said it more shyly. \u201cIf you want, I could ask my gran. She has advice for most things. She\u2019d say I give it out like sweets because I don\u2019t know better, but it\u2019s trained me. Or I could\u2014\u201d He hesitated. \u201cThere\u2019s a page. A guide. Doesn\u2019t fix you. But it says how to help. Do you want me to send it? I know I\u2019m a stranger. But so is everyone until you tell them a small thing and then you\u2019re stuck with them forever.\u201d\n\n\u201cA page,\u201d Abby said, and thought of her mother and her friends and Mel and all the sentences they\u2019d offered like ropes. She thought of a boy who carried bags for golfers and tuition fees and the way he watched the ground when it sloped, and she thought: yes, this is one of those small things. \u201cSend it.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d he said, and his grin was crooked and real. He fumbled with his phone, then paused. \u201cIt\u2019s not my place. Is it?\u201d\n\n\u201cEverything is your place if you step into it gently,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s the rule I\u2019m learning.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll step gently,\u201d he said, and he did, and she watched him, and she thought: my life keeps being complicated by people who are kind, and I don\u2019t know what to do with it.\n\nAt home, she clicked the link. It was simple. It said: do not force. It said: break the edge into edges smaller than your name for them. It said: breathe in the ugly way that makes you sound like you\u2019re blowing up a paddling pool. It said: approach what you fear sideways like a horse. It said: listen to yourself, and when yourself lies, answer back with something ordinary\u2014counting spoons, naming dogs. She laughed and cried like a person who\u2019s obvious. Then she printed the page, because paper is easier to carry. Even fear knows paper weighs less than expectation.\n\nShe went to the rooftop again, but not to the scaffolding. She found the car park and climbed one level. She stood and placed a coin on the wall and looked at its scratches and named them. She called one a river. She called one a scar. She breathed and did not look at the slice of drop until she wanted to. She wanted to, in a small, shaky way. She looked. She flinched. She didn\u2019t leave. She stood and felt her ribs loosen their mean metal. When the wobble came, she said hello to it out loud like a fool. A woman on the other side of the level lit a cigarette and looked at her with interest. Abby looked back and said nothing because you are allowed to keep some weirdness for yourself.\n\nThat night, she wrote. She wrote about the way the skyline repeats itself if you stare long enough, like a word. She wrote about steps and coins and the kind boy who had decided to be a person in her story without asking permission. She wrote and it came out not clever but almost true. She sent the draft to Mel and Mel wrote back at once: it\u2019s breathing, Abs. The piece is breathing. Are you?\n\nShe typed: trying. She typed: I\u2019m going to do the library bridge tomorrow. She closed her laptop. She stood up and felt the room tilt. She laughed and said, we\u2019ll see.\n\nOn the way to the library the next morning, she stopped at a charity shop and bought a scarf she didn\u2019t need and a silver teaspoon that had the word Leeds stamped in its handle. She put the spoon in her pocket and patted it like a pet. The security guard at the library frowned when she asked about the bridge; that kind of frown that means he enjoys saying no but he might enjoy yes more if you give him a reason to tell the story later. She gave him the story. \u201cIt\u2019s for a piece,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s about the city from above. I\u2019ll be quick.\u201d\n\nHe rang someone whose name was in his head as a code. He looked at her and then at the ceiling for a minute that lasted longer than a paragraph. Then he said, \u201cAlright.\u201d\n\nOn the bridge, it was quiet. The glass had that greenish bad-aquarium tint and the floor had scuffs from shoes that had not thought of themselves as brave. Abby went very slowly. She held the spoon. She named the scratches when she needed to. She answered her lies with coin-silver facts. She looked at the staircase that fell away on one side, a utilitarian trough of air. She reached the middle and put her hand on the glass just because. Her palm made a smear that looked like the ghosts were leaving messages. She stood and waited. She felt ridiculous and proud and then neither. Eventually, she had stood there long enough for it not to seem like a battle anymore. It was simply a place in a building. She went back. The guard looked at her as she left, and he didn\u2019t say anything, and she didn\u2019t either. There is dignity in not commenting.\n\nOutside, the sky was the colour of washing left too long in the machine. She walked to the bus stop and considered walking home just to name every step. But she had a meeting with Mel and Mel had a way of making her small triumphs sit up straight and do their work.\n\n\u201cI think the piece will hinge on this,\u201d Mel said, tapping the bridge paragraph as if it might wobble back. \u201cNot just the up, but your list of methods. You\u2019re not a self-help writer, and if you try to be one I\u2019ll cut your hands off and feed them to the pigeons, but you can point to the tinier things and make them shine. That\u2019s your trick.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a trick.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know.\u201d Mel smiled. \u201cHow\u2019s your head?\u201d\n\n\u201cStill stupid,\u201d Abby said. \u201cBut more obedient.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood. Keep it that way.\u201d\n\nOn the bus, she sat by the window, because she always had, because she always would. She felt the pleasant jolt of the wheels over the city\u2019s small bones. She thought of Kit, and whether he knew his online link had just written the next page of her book. She thought of her father\u2019s clubs and the sixth hole\u2019s dip, and the way steps are only frightening if you think of them as a ladder to a story you haven\u2019t learned how to tell yet.\n\nAt her stop, she got off and didn\u2019t look left or right, and then she remembered the spoon in her pocket and laughed because she\u2019d been carrying something boring in her fist the whole time and hadn\u2019t even needed it. On the street outside her flat, a man was arguing with his dog about the principles of walking. The dog sat down with all the gravity of a monk. Abby nodded at both of them, because sometimes the city is kind in minor ways, and those are the ways that count.\n\nShe went upstairs and put the spoon on her desk, a little talisman. She typed: This city is a book of slants and angles. I sit in it like a bookmark, trying to hold my place. She typed: Somewhere above me, someone is putting a ladder up a wall and someone else is refusing to climb. And both are fine. She typed until the daylight dimmed, and when she stopped, the silence was a kind of applause.\n\nWhen she looked up again, it was raining. Not the soft, apologetic kind, but the sort that beats the windows as if to say, I dare you. She thought of all the methods she was practicing, and of how people would read them and say, you make it sound easy. She wanted to write a warning in capitals at the top of the page: it is not. She turned the kettle on and stood in the steam. Her phone vibrated: a message from an unknown number, and then Kit\u2019s name at the end of it.\n\nhow did the bridge go? my gran says i can tell you you\u2019re brave if i put a question mark after it. brave?\n\nShe replied: brave. For a minute.\n\nHe texted a confetti emoji, then: it\u2019s always only a minute. then the next one. then the next. do you want to try the footbridge by the golf course tomorrow? the one over the brook? tiny height. very small trolls underneath.\n\nShe smiled at the phone like it was a person, which it was, in a way, and typed: yes. bring a coin.\n\nHe replied: i\u2019ll bring two. in case one runs off. Then he sent a picture of a coin with a face so worn it looked like a ghost. Abby laughed, that new odd sound of hers when she felt the world loosen itself from the rigid expectation she\u2019d punished it with.\n\nShe slept that night in a bed that felt more like a bed than a drama. When the rain woke her briefly\u2014spattering, insistent\u2014she turned over and thought of ladders. Being brave for one minute. The strange fact of being held up by a bridge you could prod with your boot. She dreamed of playing the sixth hole again and discovering, halfway down the dip, that a tiny bus was parked among the daisies like a toy. It honked a sound like a laugh and she picked it up and put it in her pocket with the coin. When she woke, she reached for her phone and thought: I\u2019m not ready for the top of the story. Not yet. But I\u2019ve made a paragraph of it. That counts.",

                              "content": "In the morning the city had rinsed itself clean, all the pavements slick with yesterday\u2019s temper and the brook at the edge of the golf course talking too fast, as water does when it\u2019s got gossip. Kit was already there, hood up, hair damp at the edges and a grin that arrived before his apology for being early. He held out two coins like offerings on a saucer, each more ordinary than a story ought to be. \u201cOne for each pocket,\u201d he said, as if pockets were reliquaries and the coins were saints. \u201cYou can name them now, or later, or not at all.\u201d\n\nShe took the heavier one and felt its dented rim as if touch could read. The bridge itself was a neat metal thing, four steps up and four steps down, a polite hump over a water that had been known to sulk its banks into brown. It had rails, and the rails had bolts, and every bolt knew its job better than most people do. The trolls under it\u2014by which Kit meant the clotted tangles of weed and a shopping trolley\u2014were sleepy, caught in a dream of rust. She could feel her body starting its little rehearsals, the flutter in her calves and the way her throat made its quiet case for retreat, but she made herself stand at the bottom step and shake her head like a horse swatting flies. \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d she said. \u201cLet\u2019s take them sideways.\u201d\n\nThey went up together and stopped halfway. She set a coin on the rail and named a scratch in her head\u2014river, again\u2014and then, in a new spirit of extravagant banality, named another scratch bus-stop, and another dog-ear because that was what had become of her courage: a folded-over page, not a loss but a marker. Kit didn\u2019t look directly at her, which was a gift; he looked at the brook and said, conversational, \u201cThere used to be ducklings here. My gran talks to them as if they\u2019re late for school.\u201d He tapped his coin twice, then slid it back into his pocket and stood with his hands crammed in as if to stop all his instincts falling out. \u201cYou can stay as long as you want. Or we can do laps until the trolls file a complaint.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s file first,\u201d she said, and they walked the hump once, twice, three times, until the steps and the slant and the spare air between her ribs felt less like an ancient enemy and more like a neighbour with a loud radio. On the fourth pass, she stopped in the middle and looked down through the mesh to where the water licked the concrete. She made herself look at the slim gleam of a can wedged under the trolley\u2019s crooked knee, at the filmy backs of leaves spinning toward an appointment. \u201cAll the worst things are in the head,\u201d she said, trying the words on as if they were a coat she could grow into. \u201cAnd mine is learning to sit.\u201d\n\n\u201cMine refuses,\u201d Kit said, and because they were both making peace with admission, they laughed. He bumped her shoulder with the kind of care that made contact feel like punctuation rather than emphasis. \u201cI liked your thing about the spoon,\u201d he added, and when she glanced up, startled, he looked briefly abashed. \u201cArthur showed me the draft. He said he wasn\u2019t supposed to, but he thought I might like the bit where the security guard pretended to be a bouncer to heaven.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe did, did he,\u201d Abby said, feeling for once not invaded so much as accompanied. \u201cI\u2019ll forgive you both because you were right. And because my editor has threatened to give me the pigeons\u2019 share if I start advising people, so I need witnesses that it isn\u2019t that.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t that,\u201d Kit said promptly, solemn as a declaration. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2014maps. My gran says maps are just apologies for not knowing everything, which is why they need legends.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour gran sounds like a woman I\u2019d follow into a storm,\u201d Abby said, and felt the quiet strength of the bridge underneath her feet as if the metal had shifted to muscle. They crossed to the other side and stood, unnecessary, as if waiting for a clapped-in curtain. Then they went back again, and it was the same and not the same, because repetition is the only magic that works quickly. When she stepped down at last, the ground had that surprising softness of a carpet you didn\u2019t notice until your shoes were off.\n\nThey walked the edge of the course and talked about almost nothing\u2014sand and how it gets everywhere, the rude grace of magpies, the way Leeds refuses to settle on who it is. Kit confessed he\u2019d tried to write songs for a year and ended up with four choruses and no verses, which felt like an admission of a different kind of height. Abby confided that once she\u2019d submitted the same article to two publications by mistake because she\u2019d renamed the file and imagined it would obediently become a different thing inside. They compared failures as if they were recipes, and it was a relief to treat them as useful, not currency. When they parted at the bus stop, it was with the exchange of numbers given permission by the bridge. \u201cIn case you get a sudden urge to walk over anything,\u201d Kit said. \u201cOr if you need someone to tell you a really boring fact. I have so many.\u201d\n\n\u201cKeep them sharp,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll need them blunt.\u201d\n\nMel\u2019s email arrived mid-morning as if timed to check whether her blood had steadied. It was a list again, but this one had breath between the bullet points. A rooftop garden on a low office block near the river, a gallery window that could be opened if she asked the right person with the right tone, the Millennium Square car park with a top level rumoured to have a view like a shrug\u2014that is to say, nothing it wasn\u2019t willing to own. \u201cWe\u2019ll stage this,\u201d Mel wrote, \u201clike steps. No grandstanding. If the scaffolding wants to be second- or third-act, let it. I want your ordinary miracles first.\u201d Abby wrote back quickly for once, that habit of delay untied for the moment. She said, yes to the garden, yes to the gallery, yes to the shrug. She resisted typing and maybe yes to something that is not strictly a height but is shaped like letting go, because it sounded like an invitation to metaphor when what she had was a teaspoon.\n\nShe took the number 36 into town and sat where she could see both the road and her reflection doubled in the glass like a rehearsal for being someone else. On the seat across the aisle, a woman murmured into a phone, her hand covering the mic in that futile way that never quite muffles a secret. At the Headrow again the sun did its old trick of bouncing from window to window like a child daring you to chase them, and Abby dared herself to count as she walked: slabs, kerbs, the way the paint of a zebra crossing flakes into islands. She didn\u2019t know whether this was healing or simply the only way to make her way across a city that had grown lines where she hadn\u2019t expected them, but the act of counting felt less like captivity when she chose it.\n\nThe gallery had that hush that always makes people whisper even when they\u2019re alone. A woman in a black cardigan with sleeves pushed up to her elbows came to meet her and introduced herself as Briony in a voice that didn\u2019t bother with capital letters. \u201cWe do open it sometimes,\u201d she said, tipping her head at the high window like it was occasionally a door. \u201cOn hot days we pretend we\u2019re continental and open everything. It\u2019s barely a height; it\u2019s just a different angle for the pigeons to judge us from. But come.\u201d She fetched a key from a drawer that had other keys in it and the promise of biscuits, and they climbed a set of stairs that creaked with honest complaint. At the top, the window did what all windows do when they decide to reveal that they\u2019re two-faced; it flapped a little and then held, and there was air, the cheap kind that comes free and makes you think of expensive things.\n\nAbby stood back first, then leaned in the way you lean into a conversation you didn\u2019t know you wanted. The street below was a ribbon without its bow, people dots, the traffic a teachable animal. Because it wasn\u2019t dramatic, because there was glass still between, the belt around her chest only tugged, it didn\u2019t cinch. She thought of the word cantilevered because it had always pleased her, that promise that something could jut into nothing and not be punished for its arrogance. Briony watched her with that kind of care that you pretend is casual, and when Abby said thank you, it sounded like something larger than manners.\n\nOn the pavement outside, she nearly ran into Callum. He was holding a paper cup and looking at a building as if trying to remember whether he\u2019d once lived in it, which he hadn\u2019t, although there were stories inside him that had taken rooms in worse places. \u201cAbs,\u201d he said, and the nickname felt like a postcard from an earlier holiday. \u201cI was going to message, and then I didn\u2019t, and then my phone somehow called you, and I\u2019ve been pretending it\u2019s haunted to save face. How are you?\u201d\n\n\u201cLearning to walk over bridges,\u201d she said before she could stop herself, because sometimes telling a person exactly what you\u2019re doing breaks the habit of telling yourself a prettier lie. His face did that ripple where pride and worry fight to a draw, and then settled into a softness she knew too well. He was a man who could be tender until tenderness asked for a task.\n\n\u201cYou always did like a view,\u201d he said, defaulting to a shared memory because it was safer than the present. \u201cThere was that time\u2014do you remember\u2014the car park on Neville Street, and you said the arches looked like the city had ribs. We lived on that one sentence for a week.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to live on less,\u201d she said, and when she wasn\u2019t sure whether that sounded mean or simply accurate, she picked a different sentence. \u201cI\u2019m fine. I mean, I\u2019m trying. You?\u201d\n\nHe rubbed the stubble on his jaw like it was a worry bead. \u201cJob\u2019s a job. I\u2019m doing a thing about bins at the moment that makes me think I should be more grateful for bins. My mother thinks I should be more grateful for women. She keeps telling me she has a friend\u2019s daughter who\u2019s \u2018your type\u2019. I keep saying I don\u2019t have a type. She says, \u2018women who will put up with you,\u2019 and she\u2019s not wrong.\u201d\n\nAbby smiled in the way you do when the old rhythm offers itself and you know better than to dance. \u201cBe grateful for bins,\u201d she said. \u201cDon\u2019t date the daughter. Or do. Give yourself tiny heights. We\u2019re all beginners.\u201d When they parted, it was like taking off a backpack you only remembered you were wearing once it was gone. She hadn\u2019t fancied him in months, but he had been a habit, and habits are their own architecture.\n\nHer mother rang in the late afternoon, which meant it had rained on Janet\u2019s street and the cul-de-sac\u2019s gossip had puddled under the sycamore. \u201cBrenda says the new supermarket is an eyesore, which means it probably isn\u2019t,\u201d she reported cheerfully, then paused, and in the pause Abby heard the kettle click. \u201cYou sounded not yourself when we spoke. I have been thinking about you. I\u2019ve decided not to offer advice. I will, however, say this: when your father left the ladder out against the back wall, your baby cousin climbed it to the third rung, and I nearly took the wall down with my noise. He was fine. He was fine and I wasn\u2019t. And I have been embarrassed about it for twenty years. There you are. Your inherited shame is intact.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m cataloguing mine,\u201d Abby said, sitting at the table because that was what this tone required. \u201cI\u2019m also writing a series where I climb things and call it art.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like that,\u201d Janet said reflexively, and then dented the reflex with a laugh. \u201cBut then I don\u2019t have to. When your father died I stopped going over the motorway bridge by the services. I went the long way round. I told nobody because I didn\u2019t want it to be a fact. After a year I went over it without noticing, because I was late for a funeral. There\u2019s your wisdom. Grief breaks what it likes and sometimes it mends without asking. And sometimes it doesn\u2019t. I\u2019m making a stew. Do you want some?\u201d\n\nAbby said yes, because food in Tupperware is a truce between generations. She thought of telling her mother about Kit, and then didn\u2019t, because naming a person to your mother is a test on an exam you didn\u2019t agree to sit. They arranged a time for stew handover and talked about the price of basil as if it were a heartbreaking opera they\u2019d both seen.\n\nAt the Hyde Park Book Club that evening, the writers\u2019 circle were already mid-spar when she slid onto her usual chair. Nisha was reading a sentence about a man who collected rain in jars, and Toby was insisting that jars are not historically accurate because \u201cif you were going to do it seriously you\u2019d need calibrated cylinders.\u201d Nina was drawing a map in the condensation on her glass that might have been a coastline or a bruise. \u201cWe\u2019ve been discussing precision and when it\u2019s an attack,\u201d Nina said, without lifting her head, as if that were a reasonable thing to be doing on a Tuesday. \u201cShow us your rooftops, Abigail.\u201d\n\nAbby read the paragraph about the bridge in the library and her hand shook only once. When she finished, there was a silence that felt surgical. Toby put his pen down like a surrender flag. \u201cYou\u2019ve got it,\u201d he said, surprising her as much with the generosity as with the language. \u201cYou didn\u2019t tell me what to feel and therefore I felt something. The bolts are good. Don\u2019t overdo the coins. One coin per page.\u201d\n\n\u201cTwo,\u201d Nisha said, and the rule was made cheerfully and broken in the same breath. \u201cI like the spoon. It\u2019s domestic, it resists grandeur. It\u2019s also very you, which is a compliment regardless of whether you accept it.\u201d\n\nNina looked up at last, her gaze inclined like a cat choosing a lap. \u201cYou write about fear the way people write about romance,\u201d she said. \u201cWhich is to say, you are nauseating in a way that I cannot avoid being moved by. Keep doing it. Stop apologising for it before it happens, though. That\u2019s a pre-emptive strike and it\u2019s ugly.\u201d\n\nAbby absorbed this with the grateful resentment that comes from being seen. They ordered more chips than anyone needed and distributed them in a way that felt like communism as imagined by a church bake sale. After, as she walked down Headingley Lane toward Woodhouse Moor, the sky doing that half-hearted midnight that March attempts and then rethinks, she felt steadier in her body than she had for weeks. It was not bravery. It was adjacency. It was the thing next to bravery that gets no credit but does all the carrying.\n\nBarclay rang the next morning to say he\u2019d be at the site by nine and if she wanted to try again, he had a thermos and a patience with people he liked to believe was inherited. She bought a packet of mints she didn\u2019t need and walked there with the kind of deliberation that makes a route feel taught. The scaffolding stood up like a decision. It wasn\u2019t high, not in the way of postcards, but it was air arranged as a question and her bones had always been keen to answer. Barclay lent her a hard hat that smelled of other heads and gave her the talk he gave to teenagers on work experience: don\u2019t be an idiot, don\u2019t look for problems you can\u2019t solve, tell me if you\u2019re going to do anything illegal so I can pretend I didn\u2019t see.\n\nThey climbed. She counted in twos and told lies about her breathing that she then corrected with the paddling pool method. At the place where she had stopped before, she stopped again, because repetition is not defeat but rehearsal. Barclay, who had the decency of silence, leaned against a pole and looked out across the city with eyes that had seen it be a different thing thirty times. \u201cWhen they built this,\u201d he said finally, \u201ceveryone wrote letters. Angry ones. \u2018You\u2019ve taken my skyline,\u2019 they said, as if anyone owns a line. Ten years later half of them want to get engaged up here. Humans. Can\u2019t fault us for consistency.\u201d\n\nAbby laughed because it was easier than crying, and because the word engaged hung in the air like something you toss and let fall on the safest patch of grass. She took another step up and felt the ghost-hand on her back that fear likes to be. She said hello to it, quietly, under the clank of her own footfall, and it didn\u2019t go away but it stopped pretending to be the only hand. A gust tugged at the hem of her jacket, and for a second the old script tried to run: what if you lean, what if you pour, what if you forget that you are a vessel and not a river. She set her palm flat on the metal and named the scratches again, which was becoming a litany; she called one streetlight, one cuff, one dog that refuses. The city opened in one of its smaller ways: chimney tops at the same height as her mouth, the curve of the canal like a polished spine, two gulls that had no intention of being symbolic and were anyway.\n\nShe came down before she had to, because leaving before panic has the last word is its own skill. At the bottom, on the pavement, she felt ridiculous and proud in equal measure, which she was learning to treat as a sign of correct dosing. Barclay unscrewed the thermos and poured her tea that tasted inevitable. \u201cYou\u2019ll come again,\u201d he said, less question than weather prediction, and she nodded because for once she could see the front moving across the sky.\n\nIn the afternoon she took her mother\u2019s stew and sat at Janet\u2019s table with a napkin under the bowl as if the stew might spill righteousness. Her mother watched her eat with the satisfied worry of someone who has ensured heating, food, and a criticism in reserve. They talked about Arthur\u2019s knee, which had begun to sulk, and Brenda\u2019s grandson, who had decided to move to Manchester in what was being treated as a betrayal of jurisdiction. After a while, Janet went to the airing cupboard with a look of noblesse oblige and brought out a box Abby hadn\u2019t seen in years. \u201cYour father\u2019s nonsense,\u201d she said, though her voice softened the word beyond recognition. \u201cScorecards and those pretend-prizes he called them. He used to write notes on the back. Don\u2019t read them if you don\u2019t want to find out he was worse than you thought.\u201d\n\nAbby opened the box as if it might leap. The scorecards were small violent stutters of pencil. On the reverse of one he had written, in his blocky all-caps, LEFT WRIST LIKE A SULKY CHILD; STOP IT. On another: WIND A LIAR. DON\u2019T TALK TO IT. She swallowed and didn\u2019t cry and then chose to, because choice was at the heart of the new map. \u201cHe was ridiculous,\u201d she said, and put a card in her pocket as if it were a receipt for something she didn\u2019t need to return. \u201cI\u2019m going to keep these until I can\u2019t bear it and then I\u2019ll put them back and make you hide them better.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d Janet said, and refilled Abby\u2019s bowl with the authority of a queen knighting a knight. \u201cAnd don\u2019t get clever and think a stew can cure a fear. Only practice can. And even then you\u2019ll look down one day and think, not today. That\u2019s life, not failure. Now eat.\u201d\n\nKit texted that evening to tell her he had successfully returned a pram to a woman who had accidentally rolled it two feet away from her and had afterwards apologised to the pram as if it were a person she had wronged. He added a photograph of a coin balanced on a lamppost on North Street and wrote: public art. She sent back a picture of the scorecard with her father\u2019s sulky wrist note and typed: heredity is a joke I keep laughing at. He replied with a voice note of his gran saying, in a voice that sounded like ironing linen, \u201cTell her she\u2019s not special, bless her, and that\u2019s a compliment. All brains are unruly and yours is only unusually articulate. Stroke it and send it to bed.\u201d\n\nThe rooftop garden was kinder than all the other roofs because it pretended to be ground. The woman who ran it had arms like twine and a smile that could tie things down without asking first. \u201cYou can hold the spade if that helps,\u201d she said, and it did help, ridiculous as it was, the weight in her hand a proof of gravity. The beds were rectangles of ambition, parsley and mint and a brave rosemary that had weathered a sharp frost and was now announcing its victory. From that height the city\u2019s edges softened; the traffic was a hiss, and the building across the way reflected them back in a way that made their outlines blur and improve. \u201cWe do lunch up here sometimes,\u201d the woman said, crouching to show Abby the shy beginnings of radish leaves. \u201cWe\u2019re not supposed to, but work is just life in the wrong shoes.\u201d\n\nAbby wrote in her notebook without flinching and remembered to look up between sentences. She made a note to ask Mel if she could include the woman\u2019s line because it was a sentence that carried its own chair with it. She wrote a description of the rosemary winning and crossed out two adjectives because they tried too hard. When she sat down on the bench by the corner and swung her feet a little, just to prove she was above and unbothered, she felt the belt ease one notch more. It was not progress that anyone would notice if they were measuring in floors, but she was measuring in breaths and bolts and spoons.\n\nThat night she woke at three, the hour when all the house\u2019s wooden decisions creaked, and the world offered up its old list of possible endings. She got up and did not look at her phone and took the spoon from her desk and held it in her palm as if it were a small cool animal. In the low light the silver looked like river, and she thought, everything is manageable until it isn\u2019t and then, sometimes, it is again. She put the spoon back, crawled into bed, and lay on her side so that her heart had room to kick its feet against her ribs. When morning came, grey and argumentative, she was so tired that she forgot to be afraid until she was standing on the little step into her kitchen and realised she had already climbed something.\n\nNina texted to say she had found an error in Abby\u2019s piece\u2014a place where she had called a cornice a lintel\u2014and Abby, who could have chosen to find this an attack, instead chose to learn and then complain about it theatrically. \u201cArchitectural pedantry is just flirting,\u201d Nina wrote back, and Abby laughed aloud and startled herself with the sound. Mel rang and said she\u2019d secured a fifteen-minute slot on a radio programme that wanted to talk about city height as if it were a movement, and Abby said yes without chewing it into panic because fifteen minutes is only fifteen minutes however large it feels from the patch of kitchen where you say yes.\n\nShe met Kit again at the brook because rituals make practice less lonely. He had brought a sandwich he couldn\u2019t afford and insisted on halving it with the kind of stubborn generosity that invalidates refusal. They walked the bridge twice, then took the path under the railway where the graffiti bloomed and the pigeons made their shadowy, stupid kingships. Kit told a story about his gran letting herself be talked into going on the big wheel by the docks on a holiday to Liverpool and loving it so much she went twice, then pretended afterward to have hated it so nobody would expect her to do it again. \u201cShe\u2019ll do anything once,\u201d he said, adoration plain. \u201cTwice if she thinks it\u2019ll get her a better anecdote.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe that\u2019s my solution,\u201d Abby said, thinking of the scaffolding, the garden, the window. \u201cDo everything twice and never announce you\u2019re doing it the second time. That way if you run away, only you have noticed.\u201d\n\n\u201cPrivate bravery,\u201d Kit said, and rolled the words around like mints. \u201cI think that\u2019s the only kind that sticks.\u201d\n\nThey parted near the bus route, and for once the bus came at once, as if the city approved of their timetable. On board, Abby sat and watched the roofs pass and counted only because she wanted to; she catalogued chimneys, listed trees that had decided city life was a fair bargain. She put her hand on the metal bar in front of her, felt the cold, and didn\u2019t have to name any scratches because there weren\u2019t any. At her stop she pressed the bell and stood before the bus had even slowed, reckless in the way that meant nothing and therefore could be enjoyed.\n\nOn her desk the draft lay with its corners starting to curl. She sat, picked up her pen instead of the keyboard, and drew a map that was not to scale: a spoon, a bridge, a small hump, a taller one, a set of stairs with a note beside them that read you can turn back here. She wrote under that: and here. And here too. She felt foolish and she felt safe, which was a novel alignment. She typed for an hour without looking at her word count and when she stopped, the paragraph she had arrived at ended with the sentence: The city doesn\u2019t test me; I test myself against the city and sometimes the city wins, which is fair. She blushed at it because it sounded earnest enough to wear a badge, but she let it stand because she was tired of cutting out her own sincerity to make herself easier to carry.\n\nAt dusk, when the air had that onion-skin thinness, she put on her coat and went out without a plan. She walked to the end of her road and took the turning she never took because it led to nothing but a small brick wall and the back of a row of garages. The wall was two feet high. She stepped up onto it and stood there, stupid with her genius, and looked at the backs of people\u2019s lives: wheelie bins, a bicycle with one flat tyre, a cat that had decided it had never seen a human before. She stood there for a minute that was also two and thought, brave? Then she stepped down and laughed at herself, out loud, because sometimes being a person is a prank the universe plays kindly, and she was grateful to be in on the joke.",

                              "content": "By the end of the week the first piece had gone live with a photograph of the library bridge that made the greenish glass look like a pond caught upright. Mel had cut every line that sounded like she was about to pat a reader on the head, and in doing so had kept in a line that surprised Abby when she saw it in the wild: the city will not cradle you; if it is kind, it will simply hold. Comments sprouted like hardy weeds under the article. A woman said, my dad fell and I haven\u2019t climbed a chair since; a man insisted fear was \u201cfor people without grit\u201d and then misspelled grit; a teenager left a string of emojis that might have been a translation for we are on your side if you are on ours. Abby tried to ration her glances, but her thumb found the scroll like a homing device and she felt the peculiar nausea of being visible without skin. She told herself she had chosen this and then corrected herself: she had chosen writing and the rest had freeloaded in the back of the van.\n\nThe radio studio was on a floor high enough to be an irony and low enough to be forgiven. A producer with a ponytail and a voice like oiled wood ushered her into the booth and indicated the microphone as if it were an animal that could smell hesitation. There was a window that looked over a small square where three pigeons were doing their aimless rehearsals for community theatre. The host did that warm-up talk where everyone pretends to be normal and fails beautifully. \u201cWe loved the piece,\u201d she said, her lipstick impeccable and her expression one of practised empathy that somehow didn\u2019t feel practised. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to end up doing free therapy for the city, mind.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have spoons and coins,\u201d Abby said, half-joking and half-praying to be let out if her voice did that narrowing trick it had when the belt pulled tight. They went on air and a red light came on, which always makes words feel like contraband. The questions were kinder than she\u2019d expected and trickier because of it. Why now? Did she know why the fear had arrived? Was Leeds a particularly vertical city? Was she showing off? Had she been accused of that? Abby said her bit about ways of seeing and the dignity of small practice and left out the part where, at night, she had started sleeping with her hand on a spoon as if it were a heart she could polish. A caller named Maureen said she had taken to kneeling on the landing to climb the stairs because her husband had taken the rails down to repaint them and never got around to putting them back up. Abby nearly said, I\u2019ll put them up, and then remembered radio is not a hardware shop. \u201cIf you can, put them back up,\u201d she said instead, which was either the most obvious advice ever given live or a small revolution depending on how you felt about rails. When the red light blinked off, she had the hot skin of somebody who had been brave for exactly fifteen minutes and deserved to be allowed to be ordinary again.\n\nKit met her outside because he happened to be passing in that way people do when they have made passing a craft. It was windy in the way that means Bridgewater Place had wrapped the city in one of its sulks and paper cups were doing races without permission. He was wearing a jacket that would be immediately soaked if it rained and had that boyish expression that always made Abby think of a gull deciding whether to risk your sandwich. \u201cYou were good,\u201d he said, as if good were a word that could be applied to radio the way it can to weather. \u201cGran says you made sense without trying to sell us all candles.\u201d\n\n\u201cI nearly told a woman I\u2019d nail in her banister,\u201d Abby said. \u201cI have never nailed in a banister.\u201d\n\n\u201cGran would have you practice with meat,\u201d Kit said gravely. \u201cShe thinks any domestic skill can be learned by doing something adjacent with food first. Chicken for hinges. Potatoes for floorboards. She always says, if it doesn\u2019t obey, salt it.\u201d He grinned because he knew he was making as little sense as she\u2019d just made on the radio, and it was an equaliser of the sort friendship is greedily built on.\n\nThey walked toward the Corn Exchange because the day demanded a place that was both grand and able to pretend it was only there to keep the roof off the stalls. Abby had been avoiding it because the balcony circled a hollow and the hollow felt like a mouth that might ask questions she wasn\u2019t prepared for. From outside, the building looked like a polite spaceship that had decided to pass as masonry. Inside, the light filtered down as if it had been sieved, and the walkway around the top gleamed and dared. Kit bought two coffees and didn\u2019t mention the balcony, which made her more likely to mention it. She suggested a lap. He tutted like a horse when he was pleased and said, \u201cWe\u2019ll do a slow one. We will be archaic signage.\u201d\n\nAt the first corner she felt the tug. She had expected the belt to tighten at the sight of the drop, but it was the sense of the curve that did it\u2014the way the floor wanted to take her somewhere she couldn\u2019t see. She took the coin from her pocket, the one with the smudged queen, and put it in her palm, then put her palm on the cold rail. She named a scratch lintel in Nina\u2019s honor, then corrected herself because she knew now which bit of architecture was which and pride is a legitimate grounding technique. They moved; they stopped by a shop that sold photographs of strangers and pretended not to; they moved again. A man in an overcoat strolled past and gave Abby the look of a person triggering their own memory of their own edge. She resisted the urge to offer him a coin. Kit talked to her not about fear but about a song he had been writing that had four choruses and no verses and how he felt insulted by his own inclination toward the part that asked to be sung along to immediately. \u201cI think verses are where you pretend to be clever,\u201d he said, \u201cand I am tired of pretending anything.\u201d\n\nAt the far curve she paused longer. The view down into the bowl was not a threat but a theatre, and the people below were gesturing props more than actors\u2014this girl twirling a tote bag, that boy walking as if his feet had rehearsed it overnight. Abby thought of her father\u2019s note about wind being a liar and decided the same could be said for drops. She took one breath that did the paddling pool thing and then another that didn\u2019t, and by the time they reached the place where they\u2019d started she was not triumphant, but she was annoyingly pleased, which in the new economy counted for more.\n\nKit\u2019s gran wanted to meet her on a day that pretended to be April and had not earned the right. Her name was Lorna and she opened her door in a cardigan that had seen wars with moths and won. Her house smelled like toast had moved in and insisted on cooking for everyone. She looked at Abby with the kind of scrutiny that isn\u2019t unkind but is nevertheless a test. \u201cSo,\u201d she said. \u201cYou are today\u2019s person.\u201d\n\n\u201cApparently,\u201d Abby said, and Lorna laughed, which told Abby she had passed the only exam that mattered. They sat at a table that had been properly wiped with a cloth and not in a way that performs wiping for guests. Lorna made tea in a pot and set down a plate of biscuits she announced were the cheap ones because honesty costs less to produce. \u201cI listened to your wireless thing,\u201d she said. \u201cYou didn\u2019t go in for that new fashion of sobbing into a microphone. Good. If you\u2019re going to cry, do it when nobody has to hold you up. Saves everyone\u2019s backs.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve done that too,\u201d Abby admitted, because there was no point lying to a woman who would find you out simply for lacking the sense to tell a story well. \u201cI\u2019m not noble about it.\u201d\n\n\u201cNor should you be.\u201d Lorna patted the table as if it were a person and it came alive under her palm. \u201cYou want a trick? If you want one, I have one. If you don\u2019t, I\u2019ll give you a miracle instead. Trick is this: when your head goes river, you put something stupid in your mouth. Raisin. Button. A word. The act of deciding not to swallow keeps you here. Miracle is this: you keep doing the thing in pieces until your body gets bored of alarming you. Bodies are lazy. Mine is the laziest. It will terrify me until I stop feeding it the spectacle.\u201d\n\nAbby nearly asked whether this had always been her creed, then remembered she was not here to write someone down. \u201cI like raisins,\u201d she said, because it was the most honest available sentence.\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d Lorna said. \u201cIf you die of a raisin I will come to your funeral and it will be the first piece of joy I\u2019ve had all week. Now tell me about this boy. Not my boy; he is a complication I own. You. Tell me something that would not impress me and therefore might be true.\u201d\n\nAbby told her about spoons and coins and the library guard who liked being a gate, about the rooftop rosemary that had outlived a frost because it didn\u2019t know better, about the stew that had made peace with her mother for a whole hour. Lorna listened as if she were storing the words in jam jars with labels. Kit hovered in the doorway once, was sent for milk he\u2019d forgotten to buy, returned sheepish and damp, and Lorna rolled her eyes as if the boy had been grown off an allotment and had gone a bit leggy. When Abby left, Lorna pressed a fifty-pence piece into her palm with a look that said she was not sentimental but had a sentimental streak she fed crumbs to. \u201cThis one\u2019s got character,\u201d she said. \u201cDon\u2019t waste it on a bus.\u201d\n\nThe Millennium Square car park had a top level that barely qualified as up, but it had no parapet to speak of, only that low wall with its gums of old gum and attitude. There was a brass band rehearsing in the square, not because a performance was about to happen but because someone had a key and music is a reason for weather not to matter. Mel came because she liked an excuse for a coffee that was officially fieldwork. She held two cups like she was auditioning for a juggling troupe and squinted up at the sky as if it were a set that had been thrown together in a rush. \u201cIf this goes flat on the page,\u201d she said, \u201cwe can legitimate it with a photograph of you not falling to your death.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am starting to suspect that not falling is the point,\u201d Abby said, and went up with the lightness that comes from pretending a story is only yours and not a commodity. The air up top had a different thickness, a municipal version of rarefied. She walked to the edge and placed Lorna\u2019s coin on the wall as if she were tipping the city and then changed her mind and slid it back into her pocket because private bravery had learned to like the dark. Mel didn\u2019t say anything, which was its own brilliant edit. They stood for a while and looked at the civic buildings pretending to be ancient when they were merely old, and the traffic drawing its white lines with new chalk. The brass band attempted a hymn and then, halfway through, decided to be a pop song, and the confusion was magnificent and exactly what the afternoon deserved.\n\nArthur took her back to Roundhay on a day so sharp you could have cut pastry with it. The lake was full of geese who had turned up to be admired and sworn. Abby had told herself the golf thing was separate, a parallel conversation with her body that the rooftops didn\u2019t need to hear, and then discovered that every time she set the ball on the tee and tried to look past the dip on the sixth, her heart rehearsed the library bridge. Kit joined them halfway round with his unthreatening laugh and his habit of complimenting grass. Arthur was limping harder and pretending to be insulting about everything to cover it. \u201cYour father would have told you to stop thinking,\u201d he said, which was as close as he ever came to criticising the dead. \u201cHe never had to. He was too busy arranging the universe to his liking. He used to shout at clouds. He\u2019d say, \u2018pick a shape and commit to it.\u2019\u201d Abby pictured her father shaking his head at a cumulonimbus and had to lean on her club to preserve herself from both laughter and the threatening nostalgia that wanted to knock her socks off like a sea.\n\nOn the sixth she did the steps, not literally but in her head, the two then two then two, and the dip was not deep, not dangerous, not the end of the story. Kit walked ahead and didn\u2019t look back, which had become a language between them. When she came up the other side she didn\u2019t feel like she\u2019d earned anything other than the right to breathe without commentary. Arthur hummed something that might have been a victory anthem and might have been his knee swearing in a different key. In the clubhouse afterward, they split a plate of chips and Kit told a story about a man who had fallen asleep in a golf cart and woken up on the ninth because his friends had decided the slope would be entertainment enough. \u201cThey got a telling off,\u201d Kit said, \u201cnot for the risk, but for the lack of imagination. The pro said, if you are going to be idiotic, at least be novel.\u201d\n\nAbby tried the Trinity footbridge on a mild afternoon when the river had decided to carry chocolate wrappers and rain promises. The bridge arched as if it had something to prove and then proved it without fuss. There were cyclists and men in suits who had loosened their necks. She walked it with Lorna\u2019s coin in her fist and didn\u2019t need it until the middle, where the curve made the river seem like it had been poured deliberately. She stopped because stopping had become a skill and watched a dog across the way pull its owner gently by the certainty of its desire. When she moved on, she felt the old instructions rise and then curl back like shy hair. The city, from there, looked balanced, and she thought of the word poise, which she had always considered a lie women told other women when posture was all that could be controlled. She didn\u2019t mind reclaiming it for steel.\n\nA pop-up fair arrived on Woodhouse Moor like a dream had been misdelivered. The big wheel was smaller than the stories people told about it and bigger than her day demanded; the waltzers were already flinging teenagers into evenings they would write about with dishonest nostalgia. Nina texted a photograph of a red-and-white helter-skelter that looked like an apology to childhood. \u201cI know better than to invite you,\u201d she wrote, \u201cbut this is me inviting you. We can stand on the grass and practice saying no to things we half want.\u201d Abby went because she had leaned into the habit of showing up and then choosing, and because the fair lit itself before the sky had remembered to dim and there was a mercy in seeing mechanics dressed as magic.\n\nThey stood by the doughnut van and ate the kind of food that makes you feel both healed and lightly betrayed. The big wheel turned slowly enough to be insulted for it and loudly enough to justify the bolts being nervous. Kit turned up as if summoned by the sound of coins changing hands and Lorna not long after, her cardigan upgraded but her opinions unchanged. \u201cI won\u2019t get on that,\u201d Lorna announced to no one and everyone. \u201cIf I wanted to see the city from above I\u2019d stand on a chair and be done with it.\u201d They laughed and didn\u2019t move forward in the queue. The invitation hung there like a lantern. Abby looked up at the cabins and imagined herself in one, the slow rising, the swing at the top that would be nothing and everything, the way your stomach sometimes tries to take a different exit to the rest of your body. She named three things in sight without moving her lips\u2014dog, slush, bolt\u2014and discovered that the naming did its work even when the thing named was desire. She shook her head like someone declining a dance. Nina nodded as if blessed; Kit raised his eyebrows in a question and accepted the answer without the question having been said out loud; Lorna bought another doughnut and declared it research.\n\nThey walked the perimeter, which had been planted with cheap grass and lights that blinked at no one. Abby stood on the small wooden ramp that led up to the bumper cars, the tiniest height disguised as transition, and felt nothing but amusement at her old script wanting to rehearse. She bounced gently because the wood had that satisfying give, and it struck her that some surfaces are designed to be forgiving and that she had spent so much time on unforgiving ones she\u2019d started to think that was the only material the world was made of. A boy tried to win a teddy the size of a small relationship and failed. A girl walked away with four goldfish and nerves that suggested the fish would outlive the plan. It was all ridiculous and earnest and so committed to itself that Abby felt her chest loosen in loyalty.\n\nBack home she found her mother had left a parcel on her step, because stealth kindness was Janet\u2019s version of a fight won. Inside was a little spirit level in a blister pack that had three bubbles that thought themselves comedy. There was a note: you are not allowed to use this on feelings. Abby put the spirit level on her desk beside the spoon and the coin and thought about how she was building a shrine to the boring and how reverent she felt toward it. She sat and wrote the paragraph about the fair without accusing anyone of cowardice, including herself. She wrote about private bravery again and almost cut it for repetition and then left it because repetition was the point. She wrote about Lorna\u2019s trick with the raisin and then stole it from the page because it had been a private gift and she would not buy herself a reputation with someone else\u2019s index cards.\n\nCallum messaged a photograph of the bins he had been writing about lined up like a choir and wrote: not all heroes wear lids. She gave him a polite laugh and did not enter the game of remembering their old alignment; she was tired and the world felt, that evening, both balanced and entirely not her job to improve. Mel sent a new list with three bullet points and an emoji that looked like a chrysanthemum pretending to be fireworks. A reader named Maureen left a second comment to say the banister had been put back up and to report that she had made it to the landing without kneeling. Abby sat very still in her chair and offered Maureen a silent standing ovation that was entirely made of sitting.\n\nThe next morning she went early to the footbridge with the trolls because she had begun to like the early hour\u2019s lack of witnesses. The brook gossiped, the shopping trolley dreamed, a dog did that serious sniffing dogs do when they suspect other dogs have been rude. She walked the hump twice and placed one coin on the rail and left it there, an offering to rust. On the way back along the path, she passed a runner who nodded with the camaraderie of two people doing the thing badly and on purpose. She allowed herself the smallest of grins, which looked like a person who had remembered a joke just in time to tell it to herself. She did not pick up the coin. It felt right that some days you keep what steadies you and some days you leave it where someone else might need it and the trolls can judge your generosity if they like; they are famous for their opinions and what have they ever built except stories.",

                              "content": "By the end of the next week she had learned to recognise the exact moment when her chest would consider the belt again. It happened on corners, on the second tread of any staircase that was open to the air, at the places where the pavement tipped into road with a small suggestion of stage. It happened most reliably at noon when she was hungry and apt to confuse sensation with instruction. She started to narrate this to herself like weather: belt, light southerly; belt, gusting; belt, easing. It wasn\u2019t control but it was inventory, and inventory had always felt to Abby like respect disguised as fussing. Mel, intoxicated by the response to the first piece and allergic to complacency, sent another list with three holes in it where surprises could be. \u201cWe have a yes from a man who calls himself caretaker of the Town Hall clock,\u201d she wrote, as if this were a title made up by a child and therefore unimpeachable. \u201cHe says there\u2019s a ledge and a bell and a view that will rearrange your teeth. If you hate it you can write about hating it. If you love it, congratulations, your brand will be obsolete and I will have to reinvent you as a woman who makes jam.\u201d\n\nThe caretaker met them in a corridor that smelled like wool that had decided to live forever. He had a jacket that had been brushed properly and a face that had been left out in all weather and liked it. \u201cIt\u2019s not dramatic,\u201d he promised with the solemnity of a man who has learned that everybody\u2019s dramatic lives in a different room. \u201cIt\u2019s just up where the pigeons can\u2019t be bothered, and the bell has better manners than it used to, now we don\u2019t let it bang on Sundays.\u201d The stair was narrow and spiralled like a disagreement; the walls had graffiti from a century of people who hadn\u2019t intended to become history and then had. Abby put Lorna\u2019s coin in her mouth, because it was a day for raisins and she had none, and immediately regretted how metallic honesty tasted. She took it out, wiped it on her sleeve, and held it instead, because bodies can be bargained with if you\u2019re polite.\n\nHalfway up the caretaker told them a story about a woman who had come on a school trip thirty years ago and written to him last month to say she had dreamed the clock for three decades and could he please let her come and make the dream a fact so she could have a nap from it. \u201cI told her no,\u201d he said with mischief layered under duty. \u201cI told her I can\u2019t cure dreams. Then I told her yes and brought her up here and she said, \u2018it\u2019s smaller,\u2019 and I said, \u2018so are we.\u2019 That seemed fair.\u201d Mel nodded the way editors do when they\u2019re already cutting the story into a better shape in their pockets. Abby smiled because the story went into a room in her head and sat down and refused to leave, which is the way the good ones behave.\n\nThe bell was a polite beast, dull with its own importance. The ledge was a breadth of stone that would have been a shelf if someone had put books on it. Beyond, the city lay out like laundry on a line: shirts of brick, trousers of glass, socks of field. The belt around her chest made an experimental tug and then let go, not out of kindness but because stone at this height felt like an old promise and her body still responded to those. She stepped out as far as the caretaker would let her and then half that again because fear enjoys arithmetic. The hands of the clock were larger than she had imagined because we always make symbols smaller out of respect; up close they were planks with delusions of measurement. The city was not fearsome, not from here. It was busy and childish and trying. She looked down and saw the square below doing its usual pantomime, and then she looked out and saw the land tilt into unfamiliar suburbs, and then she looked inward and saw the shape her thoughts made all day and was briefly bored by them. Boredom returned with the authority of a teacher she had laughed at and now, suddenly, loved.\n\nWhen the bell struck the hour she jumped like a person who had only ever seen a bell on television and then did that embarrassed laugh you do when you discover you possess a body. The caretaker grinned the way a man grins when he has seen this before and never quite grown tired of it. He told her the names of parts she would not remember\u2014the stays and the bearings and the hammer that is always both violence and affection. She ran her palm over the cold of the stone and named her own private vocabulary anyway: hinge, ankle, patience. When they climbed down the spiral she felt the heat in her legs and the pleasant irritation of having done something that would make stairs feel more obvious for hours. On the landing, she glanced at the graffiti again and found, among the declarations of love and football, a name she knew in a hand that could not have belonged to the person she knew now. It was her father\u2019s, written as if he had been reluctant and then committed. The year was a year when he\u2019d been young and she had not yet been anything. She pressed her thumb to it as if it could be a pulse. She did not tell Mel. She carried it down the stairs like a contraband warm thing that no one else could have wanted and that was the exact size of her pocket.\n\nOutside in the street the day had become more public. A busker with a guitar that had seen marriages was singing a song that thought it was defiant and sounded instead like a man asking forgiveness in a cheerful key. Kit phoned as if he had planned the timing, which he hadn\u2019t because he refused to plan anything that might then be asked to go to plan. \u201cGran says she has a spare tin of condensed milk if you know what to do with it,\u201d he announced, skipping hello. \u201cShe says it\u2019s for making fudge and for emergencies, which are indistinguishable.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know what to do with fear,\u201d Abby said. \u201cCondensed milk, less so.\u201d\n\n\u201cSame method,\u201d he said. \u201cYou heat it until it behaves.\u201d He paused, as if he\u2019d been given new software for his worry and was trying not to press too many buttons. \u201cHow\u2019s the up?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot hateful,\u201d she said, after a moment where she decided to be accurate, which is a kind of generosity that has to be practised. \u201cStone helps. I found my father\u2019s name scratched into a landing and did not collapse like a Victorian. I\u2019d like a medal, but I\u2019ll take fudge.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll bring the tin,\u201d he said, quietly delighted because she had given him a job. \u201cAlso my friend\u2019s band is playing in a place with a mezzanine that is definitely a hazard. Not a height. A hazard. You can stand under it and feel superior. Or you can stand on it and feel as if you\u2019ve climbed a bookshelf. Come. I\u2019ll carry your spoon. I\u2019ll be your shelf.\u201d\n\nThe place turned out to be above a shop that sold the idea of clothes rather than clothes. The mezzanine had a railing that had chosen aesthetics over comfort and a staircase that had decided to be a ruin in a previous life. The band were four boys and one woman who all looked as if they\u2019d been told not to enjoy themselves and were disobeying in minor ways. Kit stood with his back to the rail and watched her instead of the band and then, catching himself, watched the band like a boy who had remembered his role. Abby climbed the stairs very slowly and then at an ordinary pace, which was its own triumph. Up top, she leaned into the rail and felt its falsity and laughed, because she knew now that false things can hold you and true things can drop you, and knowledge doesn\u2019t stop fear but it makes it honest.\n\nThe music was untidy and persuasive. She let herself be persuaded. Someone brought around a tray of drinks as if this were a party, and she remembered the particular relief of being handed a glass in a place that expects you to perform sociability; objects are bridges too. Kit leaned in to tell her a fact about the guitar player\u2014he delivered bread at dawn, and it had ruined his relationship with sleep\u2014and she felt the press of his shoulder and thought about the shape of companionship and the ways it can be mistaken from a distance. She thought about age and the arrogance of naming it a gap. She thought about the relief of not wanting anything more than to be exactly here, not because she couldn\u2019t have anything else, but because choosing had begun to feel like breathing rather than refusing air. She touched the coin in her pocket and didn\u2019t take it out because you don\u2019t wave your talismans around when they\u2019re doing their quiet work.\n\nAt the writers\u2019 circle, the week after the clock, she brought a new segment where she tried to be both particular and generous and ended up being herself, which was a position she was beginning to consider respectable. Toby took out his pen like a sword and then put it away unused. \u201cYou\u2019re enjoying it,\u201d he said, suspicious. \u201cIt reads like somebody who has made a map and then decided to walk somewhere with no map because they trust the land not to eat them.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am enjoying,\u201d she admitted, then pulled a face because the word looked breakable in her mouth and she has always fancied herself specialist machinery. \u201cI am also bored of myself in the moments when I am bored of myself. There\u2019s a new sport for you.\u201d\n\nNisha, chewing on a pencil in a way that made Abby worry for her molars, said she had cried at the line about the city holding rather than cradling and wanted to fight her for that, which was how she gave compliments when she hadn\u2019t slept. Nina said very little and drew a gull on the table with condensation that looked as if it had opinions about everything. When she did speak, she said, \u201cYou are writing kindness without flattering us,\u201d which was as devastating and useful as anything Abby had ever been handed.\n\nCallum sent her a message after midnight to say he had pitched a piece on fear to an editor who had said, \u201cWe just ran one,\u201d and he had had to resist saying, \u201cWas it better than mine,\u201d because he hadn\u2019t written his yet. He added a photograph of a ladder leaning against a brick wall and wrote: thinking of jokes, deleting them. She wrote back: leave the ladder where it is, but tie a ribbon to it so people know you are whimsical. He sent a string of dots and then: I miss liking you without needing you. She stared at that longer than it deserved and named the scratches in it until they softened. She typed, I don\u2019t, and then deleted it and wrote, I like you, which was true and not cruel, and went to bed without waiting for his reply.\n\nBarclay messaged at seven the next morning with a photograph of the scaffolding shining like a man who has shaved. He wrote: when you want, the sky will still be on, and Abby loved him for his limited drama. She texted back that she would come at nine, then spent the hour after eight watching the kettle for no reason other than to practice being alive without rehearsal. On site, the air had that early opportunism that makes you believe in days as discrete units. She put on the hard hat and the belt that made everyone feel safe in the way that a seatbelt makes you feel virtuous, and climbed. At the second platform, where the last time she had folded, she paused and cursed herself softly for turning her heart into an athlete that needed managing. She moved again, in the way Kit\u2019s gran had taught her: sideways in her head, raisins in the pocket, coin ready to be less important than breath. At the next bend the wind shouldered her and she caught the instinct to lean into nothing with a calm hand and thought, I can choose to hold the rail in public and not apologise to the sky for it. When she reached the part where the view opened, she did the thing fearful people do that makes everyone else think we\u2019re brave: she looked outward and said, oh.\n\nFrom up there the city wasn\u2019t an argument but a diagram. The routes she took every day became lines she could draw without a ruler. The railway turned itself over and showed its belly\u2014greased and magnificent. She could see the river ribbing its way under the bridges and the people whose lives were happening without reference to her story, which comforted her in a way that was not unconnected to humility. Barclay, noble in his refusal to narrate, nodded at the horizon as if he had lent it to her for ten minutes and would like it back none the worse for wear. She stood for exactly as long as the belt inside her would permit and then one breath longer for practice, and then she came down and cried in the way of a person whose ducts have better instincts than their headlines. Barclay handed her the thermos and looked away and talked about cement and the peculiar politics of pigeons, and Abby loved him for his orthopedic kindness.\n\nShe wrote the scaffolding piece in one go and then put it down for two days and invented errands rather than look. When she did, she found that it required fewer cuts than usual because fear had already trimmed her extravagances on the way up. Mel phoned her and told her she\u2019d had to argue for leaving in the sentence that began, \u201cI am not conquering\u2014\u201d because someone in the comments\u2019 department thought the internet liked conquering and she had promised this one would be read by people who also liked not dying. \u201cWe\u2019re going to get a lot of men telling you to sack up,\u201d Mel said. \u201cI\u2019ll harvest them and plant them for compost.\u201d\n\nJanet turned up with a tin of biscuits that had been emptied and refilled with a sewing kit and announced that she had retired from offering advice but was willing to rent out a frown for special occasions. Abby made tea and admitted to more than she\u2019d planned because her mother had chosen a trivial prop and it turns out that we tell the truth around thread and buttons. She told her the thing about the clock and her father\u2019s name and the fact of not telling Mel; she told her about Kit and his gran and the mezzanine and the way she had started turning her pockets into museums. Janet listened and said, \u201cI think you have always liked a boy to fetch and carry for you,\u201d which in another mood would have been a jab and today was an observation the size of a scarf. \u201cDo not mistake his youth for a lack of seriousness,\u201d she added with a sternness that meant she had been thinking about this for longer than she pretended. \u201cAnd do not mistake your seriousness for an automatic permission to meddle. There. I have officiated. Eat a biscuit.\u201d\n\nArthur\u2019s knee gave out properly on a Wednesday and he texted a photograph from a waiting room that looked like a community centre\u2019s cousin. He wrote: stop climbing things and send me gossip. She sent him the smallest thing that would lift his spirits without pretending a miracle\u2014Lorna\u2019s instruction about salted hinges and the bell that had tried to teach her manners. He wrote: you\u2019re getting good at making inch-high things look like altars. She took it and pinned it to the part of herself that had decided to believe praise without arguing its credentials.\n\nKit\u2019s mother phoned him while he and Abby were standing on the bridge over the brook and proceeded to shout for twenty-seven seconds about the rent on a flat that had decided to be late. He answered with the patience of a saint being rung by a church that has forgotten his schedule and then said, when he hung up, \u201cI am not a man but I am a person and it is very confusing.\u201d Abby said, without thinking, \u201cYou can be a person with me,\u201d and then worried that the sentence sounded as if it wanted to be eaten and had forgotten how to be passed around. Kit nodded and took it properly, not as a romantic gesture but as the laying down of a piece of track that trains could share. \u201cMy gran says personhood is a hobby you have to keep picking up,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s stopped crocheting because it enrages her. She will never stop personhood.\u201d\n\nThey went to see the Holbeck viaduct with a man who had made it his cause to turn a disused track into a path you could walk like a new vein. He spoke in the language of planning consent and welly boots and hope. The viaduct stood there pretending to be uninterested in being anything again. Abby wanted to leap the fence and be intrepid and also wanted a licence and a guide and a handrail and a guarantee of boring success. She stood on the grass and looked up and looked down and made a note about how activism is a kind of height because it asks you to step into air and be held by something that hasn\u2019t been built yet. The man invited them onto the first span and then changed his mind out loud because he wanted, he said, to demonstrate good behaviour in case anyone was filming virtue for later. They drank tea from his flask instead and talked about the geometry of the city and the politics of benches and the fact that when people fall it is rarely a matter of one decision but a stair you don\u2019t remember climbing. Abby made a paragraph in her head that would not yet be written, because some things are better when the longing has had to do a week of work for them.\n\nThe comments rolled in and with them a phenomenon Abby had not missed and would have happily continued to miss: men who wanted to offer solutions disguised as seductions; women who wanted to mother and then punish her when she declined to be a child; teenagers who sent her small perfect sentences and then vanished because they had lives to live. She rationed again and failed again and learned a new trick, which was to forward the most irresistible bait to Nisha and Nina and let them turn it into a game that did not leave scars. Nisha would send back a single word like \u201cbanister\u201d and Abby would know she meant, fix the obvious things first and the rest won\u2019t feel like such a project. Nina would reply with a photograph of her own feet on a kerb, half up, half down, and Abby would feel rebuked and included in one movement.\n\nOne afternoon when the sky was the colour of peeled paint she ended up on Neville Street under the arches she had once loved without debate. The tunnel\u2019s lights were on like it was a nightclub that had done something embarrassing. The sound of traffic amplified itself and came back crooked. She stood at the mouth and felt the old impulse to climb the car park and mark herself against roofline, and then she stood and didn\u2019t go, and let that be a practice too. A boy on a BMX did a trick badly and nearly fell and swore softly at gravity and then apologised to himself. Abby realised that not doing is also an action, and she wrote it down in her head because she had started to collect these small reversals like stamps. She went home another way that took longer and felt like a plea and decided that slower was often a cure that didn\u2019t advertise itself as medicine.\n\nThe fair left the moor and took its small absurdities with it. In its wake the grass had scars that looked like they\u2019d been made by something that had loved you too hard. Kit found one of the coins she had left on the bridge and brought it back not because he thought she needed it but because he liked the idea of objects doing laps. He placed it on her desk among the spoon and the spirit level and the scorecard and said, \u201cThis is starting to look like a superstition that is embarrassing to explain at parties.\u201d She told him she had stopped going to parties where she needed to explain herself and he said, \u201cThen you have a better life than me,\u201d and then, quickly and without self-pity, \u201cYet.\u201d\n\nThey talked about money one evening, because you cannot write about height and not admit to the currency you are avoiding. He said he had picked up shifts in a caf\u00e9 that paid him in tips and stories and the stories were more reliable; she said she had once been paid in exposure and it had nearly undressed her in a way she had not found entertaining. He asked her how much a piece like this paid and she told him, and he flinched, and then he said, \u201cYou earned it,\u201d and she loved him in the way you love a stranger who believes in your invoice. Lorna, when told, sniffed and said, \u201cDon\u2019t tell boys what you earn until they have decided not to be offended by it,\u201d and Abby said, \u201cHe is already decided,\u201d and Lorna said, \u201cThen I will bake for him,\u201d which was a beatification in that house.\n\nOn a Saturday she went to the market because markets are flat and forgiving. She bought a bag of raisins because Lorna had made her laugh about dying of one and because it felt like an appeasement to carry simple sugar. She bought flowers and didn\u2019t give them to anyone because sometimes owning beauty without obligation is a skill you have to remind yourself about. She bought a secondhand plate with a chip that made it perfect and imagined serving her mother stew on it and wondered if she would get away with calling it rustic. Outside, on Kirkgate, a gull plotted to steal a sausage and succeeded, and a toddler wept because the gull had expressed a desire the toddler recognised.\n\nThe second rooftop garden Mel had secured permission for was less charming and more honest: planters stuttering with kale, a view of ductwork that refused to be beautiful, a wind that wanted to rearrange her hair and then write an essay on it. She stood with the woman who ran it and talked about volunteers and loneliness and the extent to which getting soil in your shoes breeds attachment. The woman said she had started counting her week in peppers and mood and that her life had improved by fourteen percent, which was the kind of statistic Abby adored because it declared itself whim and science. She asked if she could include the number and the woman said yes, and Abby felt the casual intimacy of permission that makes a story less of a theft.\n\nShe had not yet gone near Bridgewater Place since she\u2019d learned the wind there had killed a man. She had walked two streets away and felt her steps lengthen without her permission like a character in a fairy tale. One evening, because she had eaten the raisins and counted spoons and listened to bells, she walked deliberately along the street that would engage with the building and when the wind came, it came like a shoulder in a narrow bar. She planted her feet and let it happen and did not pretend she wasn\u2019t tempted to turn back. A man ahead of her did turn, dramatically and not in error, and she felt a flare of solidarity that did not tempt her into copying. She went on, small as anything, and reached the corner where it eased, and then she stood and thought of the man who had died, and she did not write a sentence in her head because some places ask you to shut up. She looked at the building the way you look at a cousin you wouldn\u2019t choose and then she went home and didn\u2019t tell anyone where she had been because private courage gets its protein from lack of applause.\n\nOn a damp Tuesday she found herself on a bus that filled all at once, as if each person had been instructed by their life to appear. The belt tugged, and the coin was in the wrong pocket, and the spoon was too far down in her bag to be a tactic. A boy in a school blazer sat beside her and swung his knees as if they were also a function of panic. She looked at the map above the seats and named stops and let her breath be ugly, and the boy reached into his pocket and handed her a rubber band and said, \u201cMy tutor says pinging it helps,\u201d and she took it and pinged it and felt like an idiot and smiled at him as if he had handed her a baton that meant she would now run faster. He got off after three stops and forgot the band and she kept it as if objects left on purpose were the city\u2019s way of telling her she wasn\u2019t special and was being cared for anyway.\n\nThe Holbeck man emailed to say the council would meet him on Thursday and would she like to come and pretend to be a citizen and ask a question about benches with conviction. She wrote back to say she would come and she did, and she watched the way power is negotiated among people who believe in chairs and in the need for more of them. She asked a question about safety that was really about fear and the man from Highways smiled like he had been waiting for an honest question all day. After, she stood in the car park and cried because she had been brave in a way she had not rehearsed\u2014out loud, in a room, for a thing that was not hers. Kit arrived late and offered her a doughnut and she took it and bit it and powdered sugar fell down her front like a decision. \u201cYou are going to become unbearable,\u201d he said, delighted. \u201cGood unbearable. The kind where people say, have you met Abby, and you say, not yet, and they say, oh, you will, and you do.\u201d\n\nAt home that evening she opened the box of her father\u2019s scorecards and read three she had not yet permitted herself. On one he had written, HATE IS TIRING; DON\u2019T PLAY IT. On another, PUT THE BALL DOWN LIKE IT\u2019S ALIVE. On the last, which had mud on it and the memory of his hand in the smudge, he had written, YOU DO NOT OWE THE SKY A FEAT. She put that one on the table and sat and looked at it and wondered whether he had meant it then or if it was a wisdom he had accidentally left behind for her to claim and pretend he\u2019d meant all along. She sent a photograph of that last one to Mel with no caption. Mel replied: we\u2019ll print it on a tote bag and then set the bags on fire and eat the ashes because we are not that magazine, and Abby laughed in a full, unflattering way she would have apologised for a month ago.\n\nIt rained for three days as if someone had dropped the city in a basin and decided to scrub it. Abby took to walking the stairs at home, simple domestic elevation that made no demands, and to practising her breathing on the landing where Maureen had once knelt. She thought of writing to Maureen to ask whether the banister had held, and then decided the dignity of not checking was a richer trick. Kit turned up once with two cartons of condensed milk and no idea what to do with either. They made fudge and burned it and ate the burn and declared it a style. Lorna sat at Abby\u2019s table and told a story about a ladder that had fallen in love with a gate and refused to do any more work until the gate said yes. Janet came with buttons and a frown to rent and left both and a kiss that she pretended not to have placed.\n\nOne morning when the sky had the decency to be blue, Abby woke and realised she did not immediately know the day\u2019s elevation. She made coffee and did not correct this gap. She put the spirit level on her palm and watched the bubbles make their case for righteousness and then put it down and went out and walked not toward an up but toward the canal. She walked the towpath until she could have named eight kinds of weed just by the posture they had chosen for their growth. She stopped on a little hump of bridge and did not get dizzy and did not name this a victory because sometimes a day is better because a day is better and not because you have performed goodness. She sat on a bench and watched a moorhen labour with its feet and a jogger who had decided to pretend to hate every minute and she felt something like love for all of them, and by all of them she meant her city, which insisted on being itself, and by itself she meant rude and kind and open and closed, and she didn\u2019t try to make a sentence out of it. She let the feeling be shapeless and heavy and enough.",

                              "content": "Mel\u2019s email arrived with the tone of someone announcing a disappointing party you will nevertheless attend. Her subject line refused to be coy: Coast? The body was all compromise and hope. The boss, she wrote, still fancied the lighthouse notion, not because it was sensible but because he\u2019d just come back from a weekend on the Northumberland coast and had the look of a man who believes in metaphors again. \u201cWe can call it out of bounds if you want,\u201d she wrote, \u201cbut I have to ask twice before I can tell him you said no. Spurn Point, Flamborough, Whitby\u2014pick a height that pretends it\u2019s horizontal. Think of it as a civic exchange programme between Leeds and the sea. I\u2019ll make sure nobody expects you to dangle.\u201d\n\nAbby read it twice and felt the belt do its duty. Lighthouses were ridiculous, she thought with a laugh that was half cough; they were the city\u2019s owls in a different costume, guardians of edges, complications pretending to be helpful. She got up from the desk, put the kettle on as if boiling water could adjudicate between inland and cliff, and looked out at the sloping terrace roofs that had always been her first horizon. The idea of the coast was a different category of up. Cliffs were honest about their drops in a way buildings rarely are; they do not flirt.\n\nShe didn\u2019t reply at once because she had learned the trick of cooling a decision on the windowsill of a day. Instead she walked to the hospital to visit Arthur, whose knee had gone from sulk to full strike and now demanded visitors as compensation. The hospital corridor had those long glazed walkways where a city pretends to be sky, and as she crossed one she felt the old script rise and, astonishingly, choose not to speak. She looked down and saw a delivery van that had decided it could reverse with panache and a nurse who had decided to tell it otherwise. She was on her way to someone in pain and it turned out that purpose was a neat solvent for the belt. In the waiting room Arthur was practicing being noble about the magazines and failing. \u201cThey have three copies of Angler\u2019s Times,\u201d he complained, as if abundance were an insult, \u201cand none of them explain how to fish without getting bored on page two.\u201d\n\nThey sat and shared grapes in the old theatrical way of patients and their audience. When she told him about the lighthouse suggestion he made a face like a man whose pint had been brewed with sincerity instead of hops. \u201cSea cliffs are an affliction,\u201d he said, then spoiled his own drama with a grin. \u201cBut also beautiful. Roundhay is just a pond that got ideas; the sea is an uncle. If you go, go with someone whose head you like to watch work. Don\u2019t go to be tested. Go because the light is rude in a way that forgives you.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou always make sentences look as if they\u2019ve done the ironing,\u201d she said, and he bowed in his chair like a man correctly accused. \u201cKit might drive. He has no fear of getting lost because he treats it as a hobby.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d Arthur said, and then, with the kindness that has to pass for permission when people love you, \u201cand ring me if you decide not to go, and I will come round and put a ladder up against your living room wall and we can look from there and tell the boss we have seen enough.\u201d\n\nShe rang Lorna from the hospital steps because the day had that brightness that pulls a phone out of a pocket, and Lorna, who never left a pot unattended, answered on the second ring. \u201cHe wants to put you on a cliff,\u201d Lorna translated without needing the preamble, and Abby could see her in her kitchen, cardigan cuffs pushed up as if about to arrest someone. \u201cGo. Or don\u2019t. If you go, take a sandwich and a secret. If you don\u2019t, take two secrets and tell one of them to nobody. Do not mistake the sea for a friend; it is a neighbour you keep peace with by nodding over the hedge.\u201d\n\n\u201cWill you come and nod at it for me,\u201d Abby asked, surprising herself by asking for company without apology, and Lorna surprised herself by saying yes. \u201cI will bring biscuits that resent the salt,\u201d she said, \u201cand I will complain about damp,\u201d which was her way of saying, I will be brave beside you while calling it something else.\n\nKit offered the car in his trademark style, which was to pretend to be unsure and then be certain if certainty would help. He turned up outside her flat with a thermos and a playlist that had been made by someone who believed in bridges between songs as well as rivers. He had not slept, which he forgot to mention until they were already on the A64 and the road was instructing them toward fields that held their green like a remembered joke. \u201cI can nap at services if you like,\u201d he suggested, solemn and incapable of hiding the mischief that always sat on top of his sense. \u201cGran says the car is for sleeping and arguments and neither should be done while the handbrake is off.\u201d\n\nLorna took the front seat like a queen choosing a throne that happens to be adjustable and delivered a running commentary on cows and pylons that kept fear busy. \u201cThat mast looks like a giant dropped his hairpin,\u201d she said, and then, as if catching herself being flippant, added, \u201cI\u2019m not being funny, Abigail. If we get there and you don\u2019t like it, we can get back into this ridiculous machine and go anywhere else. Whitby has steps that go up to a church. Steps I am willing to curse, but I prefer steps I can count.\u201d\n\nThe road gave way to that last stretch before sea, all scrub and suggestion, and Abby felt it in her chest the way a word wants a sentence. The first sight of water was not dramatic; it was a strip of pewter with daylight held in it going about its business. The wind, which is always a better storyteller than your brain, put an arm round her shoulders in a way that wanted to be rough and turned out to be straightforward. They parked in a car park that had decided not to bother with landscaping and followed the human desire-lines between gorse and the suggestion of dangerous romance. The lighthouse stood there like a certainty someone had painted. It was tall enough to be rude, but not so tall that the sky couldn\u2019t answer back.\n\nAbby stopped before the rail because she had learned to arrive twice, once at a distance and once at the thing itself. The edge dropped in that way only sea edges manage, where distance is all confession and no apology. Below, the water bunched itself over and over against the chalk and tried to say the same sentence in different moods. Birds stitched the air with the arrogance of creatures that find your vertigo amusing. She felt the belt tug its old tug, that little mean fist, and she breathed in the practical way and put her hand on the rail and counted bolts. The bolts here were not municipal; they had been persuaded with salt and insisted on being their own colour. She reached into her pocket for Lorna\u2019s coin and found it, then put it back, and picked up a pebble instead because today the weight of something from the place mattered more than the coin\u2019s history.\n\nThey walked along the path until the railing did that thing fences do when they want to pretend to be continuous but have gaps for faith. Kit kept a commentary going about the birds, names offered tentatively as if the gulls might write in and correct him later. \u201cKittiwake,\u201d he said, pleased with the coincidence when he looked it up and found he was right. \u201cWhat a name. It sounds like a toy that starts when you\u2019re trying to sleep.\u201d Lorna, who had stopped earlier than they had because she had seen a bench and sat on it with the conviction of one acknowledging the labour of glutes, waved her arm like semaphore. When they sat down beside her the bench gave a little grunt of old wood pretending to be steel. Lorna poured tea from a flask that had acquired the venerable tang of all the teas it had ever held and said, \u201cYou are doing that breathing that makes you look like you are blowing up an indoor paddling pool.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am,\u201d Abby said, not bothering to refuse the observation. \u201cIt is the worst music and the only tune I can remember on command. The edge is honest. I resent honesty almost as much as I admire it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe sea wants to eat you and it is not personal,\u201d Lorna said comfortably, as if discussing a cousin. \u201cThat is useful information. I do not fret about being eaten by the Post Office. Though it could try.\u201d She looked out, narrowed her eyes, and nodded as if awarding the day a grade. \u201cTwo gulls are plotting. I know this because one has the face of a boy who stole a sausage.\u201d\n\n\u201cI taught you well,\u201d Kit said, as if gulls were his subject and mischief his degree. He slouched in the way of people at ease and shifted in the way of people trying to disguise that they are not. He glanced at Abby and away again, learned in the choreography of not making a thing a thing. \u201cI can walk closer with you if you want. Or stay back. Or talk about gannets until you wish you were deaf.\u201d\n\n\u201cWalk,\u201d she said, and surprised herself with how clear the word was. They left Lorna to her bench and her notes on the human condition and made their way along the path to the bit where the cliffs make an amphitheatre of themselves and the birds throw themselves from the chalk as if rehearsal has never been a requirement of their species. Abby put her hand on the rail at three points and at each point refused to let the nothing pull at her. She looked out, not down; across, not through; and discovered that the width of the sea offers a different deal to the depth. As they turned back she caught sight of a sign that warned you not to be an idiot in six polite lines, and she loved it for its tone: firm, tired, hopeful. She read each line and took it as a benediction rather than a snub. By the time they returned to Lorna, who had found a biscuit at the bottom of her bag and was treating it as if it had applied for the job, Abby\u2019s breath had remembered how to be less theatrical. \u201cBrave,\u201d Lorna offered, with the question mark she had promised, and Abby nodded like a woman volunteering to read at a village f\u00eate.\n\nOn the drive back, Leeds felt as if it had been washed and hung on the line to dry. She said yes to Mel as they passed a sign for Tadcaster, because it is easier to say yes while things are in motion, and Mel replied with three exclamation points and a threat to buy her a fish if she started writing nautical metaphors. Back in the city the air closed in the way air does when streets know your name, and it felt like a hand in a pocket rather than a belt. She slept that night as if the underneath of the world had settled a fraction, and woke in the dark with her hand on the spirit level as if it were a quiet animal.\n\nThe next few days were eaten by what Mel called \u201cthe boring glamour,\u201d and Abby called, simply, the work: transcripts of conversations with a man who knew the age of every parapet in a three-mile radius; photographs of rails and their shadows that all insisted on being the same in the browser and were resurrected by the sentence beneath; emails with caretakers who had learned how to say no as a full-time profession. She wrote and crossed out and wrote again and found that she could pare the pieces closer to the bolt, as if practise had taught her which nerves could be spared and which had to be left intact for the sentence to live. The lighthouse page sat in the middle of the series like a measured confession, cheek by jowl with a paragraph about the Parkinson Building\u2019s white tower seen through rain, because the magazine wanted variety and she wanted truth, and for once those wants spoke to each other without sulking.\n\nIt was Mel who suggested Temple Works, casually, as if introducing a friend you assume everyone already knows. \u201cOf course,\u201d she said, \u201cif you want the most ludicrous roof in Leeds, you have to talk sheep,\u201d and Abby, who adored being made to feel like a tourist in her own home, said she wanted it so much it embarrassed her. It took three phone calls and a promise to wear sensible shoes for a man in a hi-vis vest to let them peer at the building through the fence while he listed the ways in which the nineteenth century had been both ostentatiously clever and criminally unconcerned with safety. \u201cThey kept grass up there,\u201d he said joyfully, pointing up at a roof that had once been a meadow. \u201cThey had sheep to keep it short. There was a boy\u2014there\u2019s always a boy\u2014whose job was to watch the sheep and it was fine until it wasn\u2019t. Don\u2019t look at me like that; he lived. The sheep took it badly.\u201d\n\nThe building hunched over its history like a proud old animal. Abby wrote notes that made no difference to the day and every difference to her sentences later: the smell of oil that wouldn\u2019t go home; the way Holbeck\u2019s sky always seemed a bit more available to conversation; the peculiar immunity to vertigo you find on ground that knows it used to be watched by a skylark. She liked that this was a height that had been inverted\u2014grass up there, machines below; a factory pretending to be a field. Later, at the caf\u00e9 near the Round Foundry where coffee insisted on being an event, she tried to explain this to Kit and ended up stealing the garnish from his cake and declaring it research. \u201cIt\u2019s not about the drop,\u201d she said, mouth full, liable to be quoted badly. \u201cIt\u2019s about the direction of attention. Temple Works is up in order for down to do its work. That feels\u2026 generous. It does not require you to pay for the view with your equilibrium.\u201d\n\n\u201cPut that in,\u201d he said, lightly bossy, like a boy who has watched you find your point and is pleased for you. \u201cSay Temple Works is a metaphor and then apologise for saying metaphor and then say it again because you meant it. People forgive us for repeating ourselves if we do it with feeling.\u201d\n\nCallum attended one of the live recordings Mel set up almost as a dare\u2014an audience in a long room with too much light where Abby sat on a stool and read about bolts to people who had found babysitters and decided to keep the evening. He clapped at the right times and afterwards came over with his shoulders rounded like a man protecting a heart from a draft. \u201cYou\u2019ve gotten sharper,\u201d he said, which on his tongue was a compliment he would not have been able to give six months ago. \u201cI liked the bit about the boy and the sheep. I always like it when history admits to its stupidities.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always liked that about you,\u201d she said, careful and warm and precise enough to keep the old habit from standing up and stretching. He asked for a drink and she said no because she had promised herself she would not dilute her victory with memory. On the way home she wrote in her head the sentence she hadn\u2019t said aloud: I miss liking you like a person and not an alibi. She did not text it because her life had started to prefer the part where she carried sentences around and let them get tired of themselves before she used them on anyone.\n\nHer mother came to the live recording\u2019s second night, against her own expectations and in shoes that suggested she\u2019d lost an argument with common sense. Janet sat at the back as if by doing so she could pretend she had come by accident and, when Abby read the line about not owing the sky a feat, took off her glasses, cleaned them, and put them back on as if the sentence had fogged them. Afterwards she hugged Abby as if they had not rubbed each other into new shapes for decades. In the car, on the way back to the house that now held no one who had written in block capitals on scorecards, Janet said, \u201cI am cross that you are better at this than I thought, and proud in a way that will give me indigestion. I don\u2019t want to talk about it. Do you want chips.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do,\u201d Abby said, and learned anew the trick of receiving a gift wrapped as an argument and not attempting to undress it any further.\n\nOnce the lighthouse piece went up, the emails changed register. Leeds loyalists wrote to tell her she had cheated on the city, to which she replied silently that the sea and Leeds were distant cousins and both owned their weather. People from Scarborough wrote to say their cliffs had been braver than her fear and she should try them next, and she put those in a folder called Later which she had learned was allowed to remain a folder rather than a promise. Teenagers kept sending her photographs of coins left on rails, and she imagined a small rash of metal offerings across the bridges of West Yorkshire and loved the secret congregation for its wit and its thrift. One woman wrote to say that she had watched her own father fall in a way no language has the dignity to describe and that she could not forgive gravity. Abby closed the laptop and went out and walked the length of the Meanwood Valley Trail until it became leaf and worry neither, and when she came back she wrote back the sentence her father had accidentally left her: You do not owe the sky a feat. The woman replied, hours later, with a single word\u2014thanks\u2014and three dots that were either patience or refusal or both, which Abby took as exactly as much as the exchange deserved.\n\nIt rained with intent one morning and the city smelt booted and muddy, and in that weather Mel phoned to say she had secured permission for something ridiculous. \u201cDon\u2019t shout,\u201d she said, and Abby sat down obediently on the one chair in her kitchen that didn\u2019t wobble like a moral. \u201cI think we can get you onto the roof of the Civic Hall with the owls, if you promise not to flirt with them. We\u2019ll put you in a harness; we\u2019ll dress you like bureaucracy; you\u2019ll feel like a clip-on angel at a municipal Christmas. Will you\u2026 try.\u201d\n\nAbby said yes and no at the same time and then, because it is impossible to be elegant with dissonance in your mouth, said, \u201cIf we do it, I want a day where nobody expects the sentence after. I want the climb to be an act and not a plot device. If I go up to the golden owls and cry, I would like to be permitted the kind of dignity normally reserved for men who do overruns on scaffolding.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will personally punch anyone who claps,\u201d Mel said cheerfully, then added, softer, \u201cThe harness man is kind. Barclay says he is. The owls don\u2019t care, which is helpful. We can walk back down any minute you want. There is no point to a height that insists on completion.\u201d\n\nKit made her tea the night before like a boy sabotaging his own youth with good habits. He didn\u2019t suggest coming because he knew that sometimes people are ballast even when they are wanted, and she loved him for that and told him so and watched him pretend not to flush. \u201cLorna wants to know if she can knit you a bag for your coin,\u201d he said, the way people use jokes to announce tenderness, and Abby said she would prefer an argument with a cardigan and they both laughed.\n\nThey went to the Civic Hall with the kind of foolish pomp that makes a morning feel like it has set out its clothes the night before. The harness man was indeed kind and insisted on telling her how everything worked in a way that had nothing to do with persuasion and everything to do with offering knowledge as furniture to sit on. The sky did not perform; it was that city grey that puts your attention back in your hands. Up close, the owls looked less like symbols and more like animals that had learned how to pose. Abby put her palm against the stone before she put it against the rail and said hello to the building as if it could hear a human greeting and decide to consider its pact with gravity anew.\n\nHalfway up, because repetition retains its power no matter how sensible you become, the belt made its fuss. She blew up the paddling pool and let herself look not at the drop but at a single brick, dark with rain, and then at another, until the wall became a thing she had walked alongside her whole life. On the roof, the city obliged with a view that rearranged familiar routes into an open hand. She did not step close to the edge because she did not need to; she stood with the owls like a person being granted a joke that had been told in the family for years and smiled and refused to apologise to nobody. The harness man told her about a time a student had asked to propose up here and he had said no because love should not rely on bureaucracy\u2019s timetable, and she fell in love with his ethics briefly and then put it down like a coat you cannot afford but have tried on for the trick of seeing yourself differently.\n\nLater, when Mel asked her what she had felt, she said, \u201cSmall, which was a relief,\u201d and Mel nodded, because hubris was the only enemy she would fire without notice. Abby didn\u2019t write that piece immediately. She let it be a private brave for a week and then wrote it in a morning with one coffee and the coin sitting on the desk between the spoon and the spirit level as if those three items could be arranged into an altar that would make sense to anyone but her. She wrote the line about the student and left it out because it belonged to the harness man and not to her. She wrote about the way the city, from up there, admitted its shyness, and kept that, because it felt true and because truth had started to feel like a houseplant she had learned to water without confiding in.\n\nOne night when sleep refused to present itself, she got the stepladder out of the cupboard and put it in the middle of the living room. The bulb in the main lamp had been dim for a week in the way some bulbs dim as a form of diplomacy. She could have asked someone to change it; she could have left it to the day. Instead she opened the ladder and climbed three steps and did not perform bravery at herself. She unscrewed the bulb and put a new one in, and when the light came on she said thank you out loud to the room, which was ridiculous and ordinary and felt as if she had passed an exam she had invented solely in order to ace it. She stood on the ladder for one breath longer than necessary and came down the way you come down from things you have chosen to mount: with an ungainly relief that improved the next step.\n\nThe morning after, she walked to the market and bought a single lemon and a punnet of raspberries she couldn\u2019t afford and a packet of batteries that all seemed to be pre-destined for remotes, and she felt, passing under the old iron ribs, that her body had remembered itself as a thing designed for ground. The writers\u2019 circle that week wanted something different from her, which was both irritating and correct. Nina brought in a page where pictures had been labelled with verbs and told Abby she was spending too much time naming bolts. \u201cWe get it,\u201d she said with her cat\u2019s grace. \u201cThe bolts hold. What does not. Write one sentence about something that does not hold and do not make it an aphorism.\u201d\n\nAbby tried. She wrote about a handrail at the back of a bus that had been polished to false confidence by the grip of humans and had nearly spun a pensioner to the floor. She resisted turning this into a call to arms or a joke about the council. She wrote the plain fact of the slipperiness and the way the bus driver had braked and thrown an apology down the aisle as if it were a blanket. The circle hummed their approval, which is the kindness you get only once in a good month, and she put the sentence in a pocket and let it badge the day without forcing it to do any more labour.\n\nWhen the Holbeck viaduct had its open day\u2014the kind where open meant a man in a lanyard would let you walk ten metres and then stop you and the stopping felt like theatre\u2014Abby turned up with Kit and Lorna and half her inbox present without introduction. The air smelled of rust and aspiration. The man with the lanyard had a patter that should have been irritating and wasn\u2019t; he spoke about benches with the zeal of an apostle. Abby stood with one foot on the old stone and one on the temporary metal and felt her insides take a photograph and file it under reasons to remain. Lorna, who had never met a project she could not encourage like an aunt, told the man that she wished him treacle for his efforts, which was a benediction in her country. Kit sketched the curve of the viaduct on the back of a flyer as if his hand knew how to steal the line and give it back improved.\n\nThat night a storm came in like gossip and she lay awake and listened to the way water makes arguments with windows and roofs and drainpipes. She thought of the scores her father had left her and the sentence about not owing feats and realised with a start that she had misread it for weeks. It was not an escape clause. It was, simply, a reprieve. It had the tone of someone loving you while insisting on your laziness not taking the lead. She got up, in the way of the insomniac who has learned not to fight, and sat at her desk and wrote a paragraph that was boring and honest and nothing like a conclusion. She wrote: I keep asking the city to cradle me and it keeps offering a handrail, and perhaps that is the same thing from a different decade. Then she crossed out decade and wrote distance, and then she crossed out handrail and wrote human, and laughed at herself, an indulgence that had begun not to make her suspicious.\n\nLorna had a day that frightened everyone by being fogged at the edges, the kind where names walked into the wrong rooms and appointments moved themselves around inside her head. Kit texted Abby from the hallway like a boy unsure how to hold a crisis without shaking it. \u201cShe\u2019s fine,\u201d he wrote, then in the same breath, \u201cI don\u2019t know what fine is.\u201d Abby went with batteries and biscuits and found Lorna sitting in a chair making eye contact with the clock as if it had offended. They drank tea and Lorna complained about her own brain with such style that the complaint had no claws. Abby changed a bulb here too and felt that same ridiculous pride, smaller than the terrace rooftops and exactly as warm. When she left, Lorna pressed a button into her hand with the slightly embarrassed air of someone who has caught herself being symbolic. It was large and green and belonged to a coat long gone. \u201cFor when you cannot find the clasp,\u201d she said, and Abby thanked her like a woman given armour and a permission slip.\n\nOn a Friday built of petty triumphs and small humiliations, Abby found herself walking past the multistorey on the Headrow where once she had knelt like a parody of ancient worship to force herself to accept a view. The light was behaving, which is to say it had no interest in helping anyone feel a particular way. She went up to the first level and put her palm to the gum-scarred wall and felt nothing but the cool and the urge to make a better metaphor. She laughed and left before she had to tell herself a story about it and went instead to the library, where the guard had a new haircut and the exact same stance. He let her onto the bridge with a shrug that could have meant I like you or I like rules that move. On the glass the mark of her last hand had been cleaned away, which was both rude and correct. She made a new smear with the care of a person rereading an old letter and deciding to write a better one. Halfway across she stopped and put the green button on the rail and looked at it and then out at the staircase falling away and told herself a lie she could live with: this is not up, it is through. The lie was useful. She crossed and crossed again until the words ladder and cliff and bell all made space for bridge, and only then did she go home and put the button between the coin and the spoon and the spirit level and accept that a shrine can grow by neglect as well as intention.",

                              "content": "The week after the button took its place on the desk between the spoon and the spirit level and the coin, Mel rang with something that wasn\u2019t quite a commission and wasn\u2019t quite a dare. She had a cough that made her sound glamorous because that was Mel\u2019s superpower, irritatingly, to make even illness look editorial. There was going to be a book fair at the Town Hall, all indie tables and tote bags with slogans, and someone had said, wouldn\u2019t it be nice if the woman who had been writing about heights took a handful of people for a walk and showed them the city\u2019s gentler edges. Mel didn\u2019t say guided tour because that was a phrase with the wrong temperature, but she described the route as if it had already happened. Library bridge because it had become a character, Millennium Square top for its sulk and its brass band dreams, the Corn Exchange balcony in a way that would make the management feel included rather than imposed upon, Trinity footbridge if the weather behaved, and then something that pretended to be elsewhere\u2014the golf course hump, or the low iron over Meanwood beck. \u201cYou can tell them about coins and spoons without telling them what to do with theirs,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ll call it a walk for people with lungs.\u201d Abby imagined herself at the front of a small flock, hands in her pockets to stop them being authority, and felt two kinds of nerves, the social and the old belt\u2019s insistence on being invited wherever she went. She said yes because she had learned to let decisions be decided by the part of her that wanted stories, and then she was sick for a minute in the quiet way, then laughed at herself, which had become a form of digestion.\n\nDesigning the route felt like laying out a table and making it look like it had set itself. She walked it twice, once alone with her mistakes and once with Nina, who had a way of pointing at a corner and saying, this will be where everyone tries to be good for you and fails. They stood on the library bridge while a school group with clipboards clattered past and debated whether a group could pass without tipping into theatre. \u201cYou stand not at the front,\u201d Nina said, \u201cbut at the edge, like a conductor with a grudge against ta-dah. If anyone claps I will bite them.\u201d At the Corn Exchange, Briony promised to pretend they were furniture and winked like a conspirator; at Trinity, a cyclist told them to \u201cmove then\u201d and Abby practised not apologising for existing. The day before the walk, it rained all afternoon with the concentration of a child painting the one colour they have, and Abby stared at the weather on her phone and decided to stop dreaming the forecast into obedience. Lorna rang to say she had a pocketful of raisins labelled like bullets and a coat that had arguments with zips, and Kit said he\u2019d come and keep to the edges, which was a thing he had learned to say when asked to be ballast.\n\nOn the morning, ten people turned up who were gulpably real. A woman in her sixties with a wedding ring that looked like it had grown there introduced herself as Maureen without fanfare and said the banister had been returned and her husband had had the gall to claim credit; she wanted to see the bridge because she had decided to be the kind of person who sees bridges with other people. A teenager in a hoodie with a logo that refused to say what it was hovered two feet away and only stepped closer when Abby said, \u201cWe will walk and we will stop and we will be boring in public and nobody will be fined.\u201d A man in a neat coat with the posture of a violin explained that his therapist had told him to find a thing that frightened him and do a version of it supervised; his laugh caught on the word supervised as if it were a splinter. Callum came because Leeds is small and exes turn up to things with the plausible deniability of coincidence; he gave Abby a crisp kiss on the cheek and took his place nowhere near the front and somewhere within her field of noise. Mel did not come because she refused to be a presence when she had asked for vulnerability from other people, which was one of the reasons Abby had let her be important.\n\nThey started at the library because beginnings should feel like continuations. The security guard had a new mug and the same frown; he let them onto the bridge with the resigned pleasure of a man permitting a secret to be repeated. Abby used the word map and the word attention and did not use the word fear because everyone had brought their own and she didn\u2019t intend to label it for them. She put the green button on the rail and told them why objects help in language that made it a story, not a prescription. Maureen put her palm on the glass and said, \u201cIt feels like the back of a clock,\u201d and the violin man laughed involuntarily and covered his mouth and then kept his hand there as if it could double as anchor. The teenager asked if he could run across, and Abby said yes and no in one breath\u2014yes to his legs, no to theatre\u2014and he nodded with a kind of indulgence teenagers can bestow when they decide not to be offended by your age. They went slowly anyway, which was the secret of the thing, and no one clapped when they reached the other side because Nina\u2019s spirit was alive and her threat had travelled.\n\nAt the Corn Exchange, a woman pushing a pram with a baby whose hair had yet to decide on a style looked up as they went round and looked relieved that someone else was doing something that wasn\u2019t shopping. At the far curve, a man in his forties with careful shoes and a face that had practised passing for fine froze so abruptly that his cup of takeaway coffee shivered. Abby recognised him for what he was by the shape of the stillness, which wasn\u2019t drama; it was refusal. She walked to his side without presenting herself as help, which was a behaviour she was trying to learn, and said, \u201cI have a button in my pocket that is so green it offends fabric. Will you hold it.\u201d He took it as if she had offered him a question. He didn\u2019t look down into the bowl because he didn\u2019t want to; he looked at the button until his breath did the slightly less ugly version of itself. \u201cIt is stupid,\u201d he said after a moment, apologising to the button, and Abby said, \u201cStupid things are faithful,\u201d and he laughed and kept the button because she told him to, and she felt a repetitive joy at the idea that her shrine could be plundered in this way and still be a shrine.\n\nOn the Millennium Square top they were joined by three latecomers who had misread the time and turned up with supermarket bags and devilish determination. The brass band were absent but somebody had left chalk hearts by the bins and a child was stamping them into democracy. The square had a tendency to make people feel watched, which is the most boring form of fear and therefore the most stubborn. Abby made them look at the gum on the wall, at the bolts, at the indifferent pigeons plotting their surgeries, and then she let them stand at the edge and feel ordinary and ashamed and proud and all the items on the stupid menu, and she narrated none of it because the relationship between a body and a wall is not improved by comment. Callum stood far behind and took a photograph of the view as if the proof of being a person worth keeping was held in pixels; he caught Abby\u2019s eye and raised his eyebrows in a question she had the new habit of not answering.\n\nThe Trinity footbridge was its usual, pretending to be modest and overengineering its modesty. A cyclist rang a bell as if trying out a personality and a boy on a scooter decided geometry could be improved. The teenager in the hoodie stood in the middle and said, almost sulkily, \u201cI didn\u2019t think it would feel like this,\u201d and Abby, careful, asked what this was. \u201cLike everyone else exists,\u201d he said, and she said, \u201cYes.\u201d The violin man told the bridge, quietly, that he had missed being allowed to look at other people without thinking it was the prelude to harm, and Abby thought about the shape of the sentence and set it aside for later, because some language deserves to be left to cool properly before you pick it up.\n\nThey finished by the Civic Hall steps because the owls had decided to bless good weather by sitting there and being the kind of gilded that always looks smug inadvertently. Abby asked if anyone wanted to go higher and nobody did, which felt like a success rather than a failure. People thanked her in the listy way citizens do when they\u2019ve been soft with each other in public, and she batted back the gratitude like a person batting away a fly that has decided it can fetch its own chair. Maureen pressed her hand, exultant but not evangelical. The careful-shoes man gave her back the green button and said, \u201cNo, I\u2019m grown,\u201d and she loved him for his formality and refused to take it, and so he pocketed it like a child with a stone and looked briefly startled by his own capacity to keep. The teenager offered her an elastic band and refused to be thanked for it, and she accepted and added it to the museum of the day with the odd ceremony all these little additions had begun to demand. When they dispersed, the square returned to not caring and Leeds carried on without her in exactly the way that made her want to stay inside it.\n\nAfter the walk she and Kit leaned against the low wall and drank coffee that had been bought out of habit rather than necessity. He had done that thing he did where he stood a fraction behind and to the side like a bodyguard for a kind of leadership that didn\u2019t want guards, and she loved him for the precision of that stance. \u201cYou didn\u2019t therapise anyone,\u201d he said as if delivering a weather report, and she said, \u201cI didn\u2019t, and I want a certificate.\u201d He told her Lorna had threatened to petition the council to rename all the railings in the city after their functions because she was tired of the way landmarks hog the nouns. He looked tired in the eyes and bright around the edges, which was his version of not sleeping but trying to keep his promise to life anyway. On the way back to hers, somewhere near the line where shops stop pretending to have anything for you and start to tell the truth about what people need, he told her that his mother wanted to move to Scarborough to be with someone who made her laugh like old cutlery. He didn\u2019t say he would go with her because he wasn\u2019t a man yet and men don\u2019t describe themselves as going with; he said he might like to see the sea for more than a day and had already looked up rents he could only afford if he also learned a trade. \u201cI am not for boats,\u201d he added, in case she pictured him in stripes. \u201cBut I could fetch, and I could carry.\u201d She felt the little tilt in her stomach that wasn\u2019t height but might as well have been, and told him that if he left, she would have to learn to carry things without showing off, and he pointed at her shrine of metal and said, \u201cYou already are.\u201d\n\nArthur sent a photograph of his knee in a stocking that had the indecency to be beige, with a caption that read, glamour. He\u2019d had the surgery and was now making a study of the physiotherapy schedule with an intensity he usually reserved for sandwiches. He said the exercises had names that turned out to be lies because clamshells did not resemble clams and bridges did not resemble bridges and he felt he had been tricked into trusting metaphors by a profession that had no right to play such games. She went to see him and he told her, as if breaking good news, that he\u2019d been given permission to swear when it hurt, and they both pretended this had previously required permission. On the way out she took the long glazed walkway and met her fear at the corner and nodded at it as if greeting an old neighbour whose dog you know by name and whose gossip you will never share, and the fear, polite for once, nodded back.\n\nThe night she didn\u2019t expect anything to go wrong, it did, and in a petty place. She took the glass lift in the shopping centre because she had forgotten she could choose the stairs and because she was carrying a plant in a pot and it looked like an optimism that might not survive steps. The lift filled at the last minute with a family, two children humming and a father who smelled like work and a mother who had the wide eyes of a deer that has learned to use the self-checkout. The doors closed and something misaligned in Abby\u2019s chest in a way that didn\u2019t belong to any of the strategies. It was not the sight of the floors slipping by; it was the fact of the enclosure pretending to move her without her consent being consulted beyond the press of a button. She had no coin within reach because her hands were full of green and soil. She couldn\u2019t put a button in her mouth because she had nothing but the elastic band around her wrist and the plant telling the truth about how much earth it needed. She did the thing Lorna had said that she hadn\u2019t yet tried in a lift; she said a stupid word into her own mouth and didn\u2019t swallow it. She said parsley, which made no sense and therefore worked, and she stared at the tiny scratch in the mirrored panel that someone had deliberated too long over and then made anyway. The lift juddered once in a way that was entirely within its rights, and the child nearest her said, we go up, and the other said, we go down, and the father said, we stop here, and the doors opened and they all spilled out into a space that pretended not to have just contained strangers. Abby leaned on a bin for a minute and then laughed so hard she scared herself because fear and relief are identical twins that refuse to wear different clothes.\n\nThe email about her father arrived on a Sunday afternoon that had arranged itself to look unthreatening. It was from a man at the council with a surname she had last heard attached to a boy in her primary school who had eaten glue and become a statistic. He said he had been reading her pieces with disapproval and admiration in rotating sequence and had mentioned her name to his brother, who worked in archives and knew how to find small facts without bruising them. The brother, it turned out, had found a list of men who had worked on repairs at the Civic Hall when they had had to scrape and re-gild and generally behave like people who believed in owls. Her father\u2019s name was on it with a date that made sense of the inscription on the stair. There was a photograph too, not of her father because the camera had been pointed at hierarchy, but of a line of men at a window with their backs to the city, one of whom had the slope of shoulder that meant work had been done and would be done again. She forwarded the email to her mother with no commentary because she didn\u2019t trust herself to add dignity to the fact by manufacturing sentiment. Janet rang five minutes later with the sound of onion hitting oil behind her and she said, \u201cI always told him to keep his feet on something that wouldn\u2019t move,\u201d and then, because love and irritation are rarely separated for long in that house, she added, \u201cand of course he ignored me in the way that has built our city,\u201d and they both breathed and set the fact down between them like a warm loaf.\n\nShe went back to the sixth at Roundhay on purpose at dusk because it was the dip that had taught her the shape of her new faith. The light was that generous northern light that doesn\u2019t perform and therefore feels earned. A dog ran ahead with the arrogant generosity of dogs, and somebody\u2019s Bluetooth speaker was trying to infiltrate the evening with happiness in a key Abby didn\u2019t accept. She put the ball down because she had promised herself she would sometimes obey her father\u2019s more useful notes. She walked down the dip and up again without thinking of it as a drop because it wasn\u2019t; it was a practice for the part of her that wanted to run toward edges with a plan and then refuse once the edge arrived. Kit arrived halfway down because he had decided to be exactly late, and he matched her without looking and told her a story about a ferris wheel on Scarborough seafront that wasn\u2019t a ferris wheel at all but a round of lights that made promises and then delivered glow instead. They stood at the flag and stared at the hole as if the ground had come up to meet them and not the other way round, and she reached into her pocket for Lorna\u2019s coin and didn\u2019t find it because it had been adopted, and instead put the elastic band on the lip of the cup and watched it sit there like a lazy HALO. Then she flicked it with a finger so it jumped into the hole and laughed in the way of a person who had just given a gift to the smallest church in West Yorkshire.\n\nIn the days that followed she wrote a sentence that she cut and then restored because she was tired of denying herself the permission to be simple; it said that the city had been asking her all along not to levitate but to lean. She visited Lorna and found the fog had gone and the wit had been left folded on the sofa and was being re-worn with pride; they ate stew and complained about politicians like it would keep the pipes warm. Kit\u2019s mother decided not to move because the cutlery man had a boat, which Kit refused to pretend could be sat on without committing to a narrative, and Abby did not call this a reprieve out loud. Mel sent back the draft with fewer cuts than usual and a margin note that said, you are letting yourself be unfashionable and it is generating fashion, and Abby sighed and allowed herself an unbecoming grin.\n\nOne evening, when the city had elected to smell like rain even though it wasn\u2019t raining, she walked under Neville Street\u2019s arches and looked at the light installation which was less and more than everyone had promised her. A boy was perched higher than was sensible with a marker pen, etching a neat signature that would be wiped tomorrow like a child\u2019s muddy handprint on a clean door. He glanced down at her with the casual cruelty of youth and said, you writing about us then, and she said, I am writing about me and you are getting in the way, and he laughed because he recognised himself in any refusal to flatter. She offered him a coin on the miracle chance that he might know what to do with it and he said he preferred plastic because it lasted longer and threw his pen to his friend like a prophecy. She left him where he was and went home by the long route and named the scratches on the evening until it behaved.\n\nMel called with a suggestion that felt less like a challenge and more like a confession. A brand wanted to sponsor the last piece, they wanted their logo to kiss the bottom of the page, and Mel wanted to say no because she was sick of making everything pay for itself but also yes because she was tired and the roof at Temple Works wasn\u2019t going to become a meadow of integrity simply because Abby had a line about it. Abby listened and pictured the owl and the rail and the boy with the pen and the elastic band at the lip of the cup, and said, \u201cLet them in if they promise to sit quietly in the back,\u201d and Mel laughed and promised to make them sit on folding chairs with their knees together. They were allowed to keep being principled and still go out for dinner sometimes; this was a relief so profound it felt like a sin.\n\nJanet, in the way she had developed of providing care disguised as a nuisance, rang to say that Brenda had demanded a reading list for \u201cgetting over it\u201d and she would prefer not to have to use the internet because it made her sound rude in public; could Abby oblige. Abby said she could supply Brenda with her hard-won methods if Brenda would agree not to return them with red pen on the margins. The next day a piece of paper was pushed through her letterbox with a stew recipe on one side and three words on the other in Janet\u2019s handwriting: spoons, bolts, friends. Abby stuck it to the fridge with a magnet shaped like a pear and considered that as summaries went, it could be stitched on a sampler and not betray too much.\n\nThe walk gave birth to more, because that is the trouble with success; it multiplies your chores. A school wrote to ask if she would take ten teenagers on the short route and make it not boring, and Abby said she would only do it if they were allowed to be bored, and the teacher laughed with relief because she had already failed at entertaining them out of the abyss. A charity asked if she would come and talk to people who had fallen and were not ready to climb stairs for any reason, and Abby agreed in a way that made it a conversation rather than her standing at the front pretending to be better. She learned, at a rate that felt like learning, to hold space without holding herself up for judgement, and she did it badly and then she did it better, which is the only arc anyone should trust.\n\nAt the Holbeck open day\u2019s second hour, the man in the lanyard said benches like a prayer and Abby stayed silent and let him have his religion. She stood with a woman who wore her grief like a coat and they looked out over land that wanted to be gentle and would have to fight for it, and the woman said, \u201cThank you for making an altar out of a railing,\u201d and Abby, who had been told by men with opinions that she had commodified courage, felt the clean click of a judgment she did trust and took it home and put it on the desk where the coin and the spoon and the spirit level had started to look less like props and more like a family photograph.\n\nWhen the series finally went to print as a small book that smelled like glue and dared you to love it despite the photographs being slightly greener than they had been on her screen, they held a launch in a low room and put crisps in bowls and asked people to borrow their own chairs back from other rooms. Abby read the paragraph about the bell and the part about not owing the sky anything, and she didn\u2019t read the lift, because lifts were for parsley and private modernity. Callum clapped and didn\u2019t try to talk to her after because he had learned too, and her mother joined a queue to buy a copy as if she were a stranger, and Kit hid at the back and then pushed through and presented her with a lump of fudge that had been salted to within an inch of its life, and Lorna signed the inside of Abby\u2019s book as if it had been dedicated to her by a universe that knew both of them by name. Mel made a speech that accused Abby of being both work and relief and threatened to make jam of her if she took it for granted. They finished the night by standing in the street and being cold and sure, and Abby felt the city lay its usual rough hand on her shoulder and leave it there, which was the form of tenderness she had always understood best.\n\nLater, alone in the flat that had seen her kneel and stand, she took the ladders out of the cupboard and put them back because they had become tools and no longer symbols, which for a writer is a sacrilege and a healing. She cleaned the smear off the library bridge with the corner of a sleeve in a daydream and then made a new smear, which was how stories were being told now: not to erase, but to reapply. She put the button and the coin and the elastic band and the spirit level in a shallow bowl that had once been a Christmas present from a cousin who failed to understand her and turned out to know everything, and she sat down and wrote three sentences about something that didn\u2019t hold and resisted the temptation to make them mean more than that. When she went to bed she lay on her side to give her heart room to beat its ridiculous beat against the rib that had donated its metaphor to a hundred pages, and she slept, if not like a child then like a person who was allowed to count themselves present without apology.",
