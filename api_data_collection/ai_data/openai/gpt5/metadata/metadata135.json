     "novel_text": "Rain came down like beads on wire, a fine gray chain curtain between lights and shadow. Roseville\u2019s river breathed a silver mist across the old brick warehouses by the tracks and stitched everything with a quiet that wasn\u2019t peace. Detective Poin kept her hood up and her hands in her coat, the left thumb worrying the rubber cap of a blue pen she didn\u2019t remember pocketing. Another body, she thought, but didn\u2019t say. The alley had that skittish look, trash in a jitter down the edges, a dented dumpster tilted a few degrees into shame.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re here before me,\u201d said Sergeant Caswell, stamping his boots. His beard was wet, darkening to a color that made his face look more serious than usual. \u201cOur Jedi knows when a disturbance hits the Force.\u201d\n\nHe was trying to make a joke; she gave him half of one. She didn\u2019t like the nickname\u2014Jedi\u2014from the Chronicle reporter who\u2019d watched her two years ago roll a confession out of a man everyone else said was clean. It stuck. People liked to pretend that her hunches came from somewhere out beyond the visible map. Poin preferred the word attention.\n\n\u201cWhat do we have?\u201d she said. The alley was guarded at each end with yellow tape. Their techs had parked a van in a puddle and were arguing about boots.\n\nCaswell glanced at his notes. \u201cMale, early twenties. ID says Carter Long, but you know.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll know when we know,\u201d she said.\n\nHe lifted his chin toward the tarp. \u201cVisible ligature marks. You\u2019ll want to see this.\u201d\n\nPoin let the hood fall back and watched her breath fog as she crouched. The smell under the tarp was rain and the particular sharp calm of coined blood, it never really left you. Carter Long had clear eyes in the old way, even though they had no more business seeing. A wiry body, a scar like a question mark near the wrist, a thin cotton hoodie with a university crest. The marks on his neck were faint banded kisses under the skin. Whoever had done it had been careful.\n\n\u201cYoung men,\u201d Caswell muttered. \u201cAlways the same. She\u2019s got a type.\u201d\n\nNo she, not officially yet; the blog was an idea, a rumor with a mouth. Poin nodded anyway. The posts had started two months ago, at first so vague no one would have tied them to anything. A voice calling itself Giselle, writing about pruning, about discipline and order. About the city\u2019s soft places and how to harden them. People read. People read everything.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s enjoying it,\u201d Caswell said, as if Poin and he were in a room with someone else, as if the rain and the river were listening.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not in her head,\u201d Poin said, and felt a slick little slide of dislike at her own voice. Because she didn\u2019t like attention directed at the wrong things. Because the word head made hers thrum. A low thunder started behind her eyes, slow, like early engines.\n\nCaswell cleared his throat. \u201cThe ADA is going to want you at the presser. The Chronicle is already circling. They want to call you the Jedi again.\u201d\n\n\u201cTell them to call me Detective,\u201d she said. It came out sharper than intended. The pen in her palm dug a small crescent into the line below her thumb.\n\nShe backed away from the body and looked overhead. Fire escape ladders rusted into place, a window left cracked, a plant dying on the sill. The alley opened onto the side of Kunstler Hall, Roseville\u2019s old music building, its gutters sighing. The pattern of the scuffs in the damp told her a story: knees on brick, hands on cold, the print of a shoe pivoting and then weight. Not much of a struggle. That part crawled under her coat and sat there.\n\nA light went on in the apartment across the alley, then off. She said these things without words to herself and to the part of her that listened: He knew her. He trusted the new friend. Or he didn\u2019t have time to be afraid.\n\nCaswell followed her angle gaze. \u201cYou think she brought him here from the silver bars by the river, the Monday night ninety-nine cent wing dens. Takes them out for a long walk like a dog with new boots.\u201d\n\n\u201cOr they walked together,\u201d Poin said. \u201cOr he wanted to be seen with her and it didn\u2019t matter where.\u201d\n\nCaswell made a sound like he\u2019d stepped on a tack. \u201cThat blog. They\u2019re going to ask about that blog.\u201d\n\nHe meant the one that had posted the words last night:\n\nI watch the way the boys cut through the storm like they own it. They believe the city will step aside for them the way doors go soft around a body. This isn\u2019t hate. This is correction. Someone has to keep a ledger, and I have always loved neat lines.\n\nNo names. No slurs. The voice was careful, precise. Amateur criminologists said it sounded like a woman imitating a man imitating a woman. Poin had read each line twice and then again on her phone in bed as the radiator clanged and the trains rolled six blocks away toward ice. She had tried to imagine that voice out loud. She had come up with a blank space where the face should be.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s more,\u201d Caswell said. \u201cWe found a bag behind the dumpster. Clean rope. Disposable gloves. Like, the kind that come in boxes you\u2019d keep in your kitchen if you were the kind of person who kept boxes in your kitchen.\u201d\n\n\u201cFingerprints?\u201d Poin said.\n\nHe spread his hands. \u201cNone. She\u2019s reading all the blogs about herself and sitting in one of those ergonomic chairs letting herself feel superior.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe,\u201d Poin said. She watched the trembling black mirror of the nearest puddle. A train horn bowed. The puddle shook and shivered open to the rain.\n\nBy noon she had spoken to Carter\u2019s mother, who held a mug she never drank from and looked at Poin\u2019s eyes as if the truth might be printed in those rings. There was a fat ginger cat that examined Poin\u2019s notebook with an offended tail and an outline of a Christmas tree in the corner where a thing had been and then taken away. Mother said: He never hurt a soul. Mother said: He never left without asking if we needed anything. Mother said: He loved to stand by the river even when it was cold, that dumb boy, he said the cold told you a story about what you\u2019re made of.\n\nPoin listened with her spine. She watched the mother\u2019s hands. One finger had a pale band where a ring had lived and had been taken off and placed in a dish and looked at and returned and taken off again. The house had a faint smell of lemon cleaning products, applied with devotion and urgency. Poin put a card on the table without looking down, because it felt better not to break eye contact. She told the mother nothing because there was nothing to tell, and left feeling like she had stolen something from the room after all.\n\nThe Chronicle\u2019s headline in the lobby newsstand that afternoon was half a question and half a song: JEDI V. GISELLE: WHO OWNS ROSEVILLE NIGHTS? She didn\u2019t buy a paper. In the elevator up to her floor she caught a glimpse of herself in the beveled mirror: hair that couldn\u2019t decide if it wanted to curl, eyebrows too expressive, a small scar under the lip that she couldn\u2019t remember receiving.\n\n\u201cPoin,\u201d called Noah from the lab as soon as she stepped out. He looked like he hadn\u2019t slept, or like he\u2019d enjoyed the not sleeping. He was the intern they kept in a hoodie with drawstrings like antennae. \u201cI got something. Maybe. You ready for maybe?\u201d\n\n\u201cAlways,\u201d she said, and followed the throb of monitors into his nest. Screens glowed with code like fast rain. News tabs bloomed over the corner of one screen\u2014speculative essays, fake composite portraits of Giselle, a cartoon with a cape. Noah pushed them aside with the flicks of a hand.\n\n\u201cThe blog\u2019s on Greylog,\u201d he said. \u201cWhich is...you know, basically a cave with a password. It\u2019s decentralized, they\u2019re proud of that, the forums are peanut butter messy. Good for people who think they\u2019re smarter than they are. She writes the posts in a hidden module then fires them out with a burst ID so it\u2019s hard to trace. But she left a crumb.\u201d\n\n\u201cCrumb,\u201d Poin said, liking the word. Liking the smell in here, which was old coffee and the sour edge of adrenalin.\n\n\u201cA timestamp of a draft,\u201d Noah said. \u201cNot the post itself. A draft saved to a local device. Which, if you do it right, never happens. But she clicked Save Draft instead of Save To Local then fired and overwrote. I went looking after your scribble on the board about the pattern of her errors. If you\u2019ve ever heard me say I\u2019m not a genius, it was a lie. Here.\u201d He pointed.\n\nDisplayed was a block of unseen things, then a string that wasn\u2019t random. Poin read, then read again. \u201cWhat am I looking at?\u201d\n\n\u201cIP stub,\u201d Noah said. \u201cPartial.\u201d He spun his chair to face her, elbow on desk, chin in hand. \u201cRoseville PD net. Someone piggybacked on our guest Wi-Fi for authenticated devices. Either she was inside the building last Tuesday or she has Creds for someone who was inside. Or we\u2019re being played by a fourteen-year-old with a flair for drama.\u201d\n\nThe thunder behind her eyes had begun as a suggestion, now it boomed, distant storm deciding to come closer. \u201cWhich Tuesday,\u201d Poin said.\n\nHe checked. \u201cThe one where you did the presser. Everyone was in and out. The lobby was a circus.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho accessed guest on that day?\u201d said Poin.\n\n\u201cYou know me, I could tell you, but then I\u2019d have to be fired,\u201d Noah said, too quickly. He shook his head. \u201cI can build you a list.\u201d\n\nPoin leaned on the desk and looked at the timestamp again. Last Tuesday, the hour of the press conference, the moment the Chronicle\u2019s camera light blew out and Poin had felt the press of bodies like hands on a wall. She could feel the heat of the room as if she were in it. There had been a water bottle. There had been a plastic sword next to the lobby Christmas tree that someone had hung there as a gag. Someone had dared her to pick it up. She had. Idiot.\n\nIn her head, a voice as small as a string snapped: You enjoyed it.\n\nHer notebook vibrated with a text. Caswell: Another post went up. You saw?\n\nShe didn\u2019t type. She nodded as if he were in the room. \u201cNoah,\u201d she said, \u201cwhat if the blog is scheduled? What if she writes one and seeds it when a thing happens?\u201d\n\n\u201cThen it wouldn\u2019t explain the draft,\u201d he said, fingers blur on the keys. \u201cBut yes. She could run macros. Except the tone changes. Sometimes she writes clipped and clean. Sometimes, look here, a little messy, a typo or two to make the true crime nerds fight about whether she\u2019s human or saint.\u201d\n\nPoin felt the left side of her mouth twitch. Typo or two. Her own text never sat straight unless she labored it. Words slid. She sometimes wrote letters like pools.\n\nNoah said, \u201cYou\u2019re spacing out. Does your Force whisper?\u201d\n\n\u201cShow me the latest,\u201d she said.\n\nHe slapped another window onto the screen. The post was titled Keeping the Ledger, too plain to mean anything.\n\nShe had written:\n\nIt isn\u2019t the skin that tells me what a boy believes. It\u2019s the way he laughs at the edge of the river like the wind adores him. How he says, lady, like his mouth invented the word. They say I hate and love the wrong things. Whatever lets them sleep. I learned about rot in old houses\u2014the way it looks like nothing from the outside and eats everything behind the paint. My city pretends not to know rot. I know it by smell.\n\nPoin read it twice, then a third time backward and then slow. She could taste the copper of her own tongue. The voice was precise and ornamental without ornaments. She could hear a hum inside the words like someone standing fluorescent close to her skin.\n\n\u201cRacist buzzwords in the earlier posts,\u201d Noah said, \u201clike code, like dog whistles\u2014the genealogy nonsense, the ancestry chest-beating\u2014but here it\u2019s cleaned, like she knows we\u2019re looking. She made sure this one could go on TV without a bar of sound.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs there an image?\u201d Poin said.\n\n\u201cOne,\u201d Noah said. \u201cA tree by the river. She posted it last week too. Reused content. Lazy or deliberate.\u201d\n\nThe tree stood in the picture like it had decided to die and changed its mind at the last second. There was a bench. There was the shadow of whoever took the photo, blurred. The coordinates embedded in the original image data had been stripped, someone had bothered to go through that trouble. Poin traced the shadow\u2019s shoulder. Not much to it.\n\n\u201cWhen is she going to make a mistake,\u201d Noah said, to the room, to the world, to the inverted shrine of LEDs around him.\n\n\u201cShe did,\u201d Poin said. She tapped where the IP stub lived as if it were a bullseye waiting. \u201cShe already did.\u201d\n\nShe left the lab with a file under her arm and realized half a flight down the stairs that there was no file under her arm. She had left it on a chair in the lab next to a cup with her lip print on it. She stood on the landing and closed her eyes for two full seconds, then five, then eight. She counted the breath in and the breath out, four counts each, to give the thunder in her head something to ride. The trick worked or didn\u2019t; who could say. On the second-floor landing a man with a cart of old case files said, \u201cDetective? You okay?\u201d and Poin smiled and held up a thumb without opening her eyes.\n\nThe apartment\u2019s radiator had decided to impersonate a ship\u2019s engine that evening, and the trains decided to be generous with their horns. Poin leaned against the window and kept her phone away from her face. She had asked Noah to set alerts for any change to the blog\u2019s source. She knew she\u2019d get no sleep if he did what she asked, and she asked anyway. The city below her window looked almost kind; that was what lights did. She had the plastic toy sword in the corner, a joke from a precinct party, green blade cloudy and bent towards the floor under its own cheap weight. Next to it, a plant came back from the dead with admirable stubbornness. Next to that, a stack of notebooks.\n\nShe opened a random one and found the staggering prints of a day she\u2019d wanted to forget. She had written with her left hand. The letters were tall and naive. She was right-handed. She stared at her own strokes and felt a bruise in the brain. She turned the page and it was her right hand again, marching. On the center of the page, a line burned: Don\u2019t let them give you a name you didn\u2019t ask for.\n\nHer phone danced on the sill. A ping. Noah: I know it\u2019s late, but we\u2019ve got a ping from the same guest network, different stub. She\u2019s (it?) is inside or near and maybe laughing at us. Sorry for the 10pm.\n\nPoin pulled a sweater over the cotton shirt she\u2019d fallen asleep half in and shoved her feet into shoes. The streets had iced with thin dark glass; the sky was a lid. She walked fast because it felt like if she stood still someone would pour concrete around her ankles. The building\u2019s security guard lifted his eyebrows and then shrugged, because they had all stopped asking why she was places already.\n\nNoah met her at the door to the lab with a grin like a lightning stripe. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t celebrate, but look.\u201d\n\nHe showed her the server logs. \u201cAccess came in on the guest then hopped to a secure channel and then out. That is not something you can do unless you know how to do it. And this time, the person was lazy for a second, or cocky. We caught enough of a time stamp to tie to a camera.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhich camera?\u201d Poin\u2019s voice had gone lower, or else the room had.\n\n\u201cLobby,\u201d Noah said. \u201cThis is where it gets weird.\u201d\n\nHe turned one screen into a bank of four and rolled the video. People in winter coats as a river flows through a pipe, the flash of a badge, a child with an armload of flyers, Caswell with a coffee he didn\u2019t drink. Then there: a person in a coat that did not want to make a statement. Gray, unmemorable. A scarf over the lower face because January demanded it. A hand slipped through the frame, hand on a phone. The posture was somehow disguised and not. The person paused near the tree where someone had hung the plastic sword like an ornament. The person\u2019s head turned. Poin watched the small tilt of it. Then the person moved on.\n\n\u201cStill frame?\u201d Poin said. Her mouth was dry. She saw the moment the phone\u2019s screen lit the scarf from below with the sick blue that made everyone look like ghosts.\n\nNoah froze the frame and zoomed without apology to physics. Pixels fought back. It didn\u2019t matter. Poin had the sensation of standing in front of a mirror with someone else\u2019s breath on the glass. She recognized nothing. She recognized the way the hand held the phone. Thumb over the lower corner, index along the top edge. The old pinch from a broken finger never set right. She lifted her hand without meaning to and her own index lined along the top edge of a phone that wasn\u2019t there.\n\n\u201cCould be anybody,\u201d Noah said. \u201cCould be the Queen of Holland.\u201d\n\n\u201cOr me,\u201d she said, and swallowed it almost before it existed, because you do not feed a stupid thought you do not want to keep.\n\nNoah kept talking because his job was to break fear into smaller chewable cubes. \u201cWe can run the coat color through the feed. There are only sixteen gray coats in that hour. We can track each to a face. We can loose the bloodhounds. We can\u2014\u201d\n\nPoin put her hand on his shoulder. \u201cDo it in the morning. Go home.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou sound like my mother,\u201d he grinned. \u201cShe\u2019s going to like you.\u201d\n\nShe spent the rest of the night in her apartment counting the shudders between train horns, a ritual born from years trying to outpace the darker seizures of the mind that would come over her like a shadow thrown by a plane. Sometimes it was better to ride them. Sometimes it was better to lie still and pretend to be a coastline. The plastic sword in the corner leaned harder toward the floor. At two a.m. she woke on the couch with the notebook on her chest and a black smudge on her thumb she couldn\u2019t explain. No memory of where in the apartment she\u2019d left her keys. No memory of standing up.\n\nAt six a.m., she went to the river because the blog had taught her that quiet places were where noisy things started. The bench in the photo cradled a terrible ordinary quiet. An old man with two dogs walked a line like a stitch. A couple in matching coats posed for a selfie. Poin sat where she shouldn\u2019t, closed her eyes for a dare, and listened to the city move through itself.\n\nThe voice inside her had a thin accent it didn\u2019t used to. It said, You won\u2019t find her because that\u2019s not what you\u2019re actually doing.\n\nShe opened her eyes to frost on the edge of the bench again. She knew the voice. She called it the second thought and tried not to give it the floor. She had been told, once, by a woman with the calmest hands, that there were old names for the way her mind built rooms. The woman had said it in a tone like she was laying down a napkin in a lap: dissociation, personality states, old categories of survival. Poin had nodded the nod of a soldier who\u2019d seen an artillery map and then folded it into a paper bird. You could learn to hold multitudes and not be stunned by the chorus.\n\nHer phone trilled. Caswell: Media wants you at the podium. You\u2019re the knight with the glow sword. You ready to sound boring and true?\n\nShe typed: Always.\n\nThe Chronicle\u2019s lights were cruel but Poin had learned to stand in the curl of them and never flinch. She delivered into the microphones a careful stack of words: We are following comprehensive leads. We ask the community for patience. We will not be sharing speculative details. The sound on TV later made her mouth seem steadier than it had been. A commenter on the Chronicle\u2019s live feed typed, The Jedi sounds like she might actually break, and a second user typed, She sounds like weather.\n\nAfter, a woman cornered her in the hall and said, \u201cIs it true she targets men? What\u2019s the city supposed to do?\u201d\n\nPoin said, \u201cNobody is a target until someone decides to make them that. The city is supposed to see each other. And call us when anything is wrong.\u201d She said it even though what she wanted to say was that you could do everything right and still be chosen.\n\nAt her desk a printed page lay under a paperweight: an anonymous letter. She recognized the brand of perfume on the envelope\u2014something from a drugstore, floral and too earnest. The letter said:\n\nI read her blog and I recognize things. Not the killing. But the order. I wish I could draw a room around the whole city and arrange us until we fit. Does that make me a villain. Please don\u2019t respond. There\u2019s a church on Ryal where the floorboards cry. I sit there sometimes. You can sit there too.\n\nShe slipped the letter into her bag because it made a shape in her head that felt important. The church on Ryal had a boat hull ceiling, she remembered, and benches that made you swear you had long legs. She hadn\u2019t been inside since her father\u2019s trade school graduation party fifteen years ago. Outside the window a white truck drove by with a ladder belted to the top like a long sharp hope. For a second her brain translated the image as a cross carried by a man too small to lift it. She shook the translation away.\n\nNoah promised her a matrix by noon, faces of the sixteen gray coats laid out like a deck of cards. Poin went to the church because the letter was a vein and she knew to tap veins while they still pulsed. The floorboards did cry, which made a noise like the word no in a child\u2019s mouth. She picked an empty pew and sat like a tourist. An old woman two rows up lit a candle in a small stubbed bowl. Someone had left a crocheted shawl over the back of a seat. The Jesus at the front looked as if he had been patched from other Jesus parts. She didn\u2019t find the letter-writer. She found a sense that the room remembered every person who had put their head in their hands here. It was almost too much to hold.\n\nHer phone buzzed. Not Noah. A number she didn\u2019t know.\n\nThe text said, You\u2019re late.\n\nShe turned in the pew and looked at the doorway. Nobody. She typed, For what?\n\nFor what, came the text back, ridiculous. For understanding the shape of what I\u2019m doing.\n\nShe had the sudden unhelpful sensation of being underwater while someone spoke from a boat. Her reply fingers hovered. She typed, Who is this.\n\nGiselle, came back. Then, in a second message, No, the person who plays her. You too can be more than one thing. Come on. All of Roseville thinks so.\n\nPoin\u2019s mouth did a thing she would later remember in exact detail. The tremor at the corner, the breath that didn\u2019t arrive. She almost called the number. Almost pinged it to Noah with the sound of a siren. Instead she typed, You\u2019re sloppy.\n\nThe reply came with a hesitation she could measure in heartbeats. Am I? Or are you very tired and forgetting the part where you agreed to dance.\n\nShe stood up enough to move to the shadow of a pillar. The light made grids on the floor. The old woman up front moved her candle to another slot as if she were playing chess.\n\nPoin typed, You want to be caught. This is a script and you\u2019re bored by it.\n\nThe answer felt close enough to be breathed into her hair. Maybe. The work is the work, and I am not a liar. But the stagehands like their cues. Look to the river tonight.\n\nShe closed her eyes. The trains three blocks away sounded like whales.\n\nWhen she opened them there was a man at the end of the pew, maybe thirty, a blandly handsome that certain men had when they shaved too close. He didn\u2019t look at her. He knelt. He checked his phone while he knelt. There was a thin white line on the side of his neck like a healed paper cut. He felt like nothing. A piece of furniture. She didn\u2019t know why she noticed him.\n\nAt her desk that afternoon, Noah handed her a grid of sixteen faces and a seventeenth that wasn\u2019t a face, just a blur. He had circled four with a red marker. \u201cThese are the ones with no IDs in system and no hits on the quick facial match. We can go longer-form. This guy,\u201d he tapped a square, \u201cturns his head away every single time like he studied where the cameras were. Either he\u2019s deeply bored or he\u2019s...not bored.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019d you get a red marker,\u201d Poin said, because saying the other things out loud might let them in.\n\n\u201cYou left it on the floor near the printer,\u201d he said. \u201cYou drop things, did you know, Detective?\u201d\n\nShe took the sheet. The blurred face occupied the center. She tried to read the man who turned his head without seeing him. She put her finger over him like a game and heard herself say, \u201cThis one.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can run that,\u201d Noah said. \u201cBut what if we\u2019re wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen we\u2019re wrong,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been wrong before and the world didn\u2019t stop.\u201d\n\nAt five, another post went up. It said:\n\nThe river stills me. People think water stands still when it freezes; it moves under. Boys love to run their hands along the skin and pretend they can\u2019t feel the two bodies arguing. I am not a ghost. I stand on the bank. I put my palms on the air between us. I ask, Will you be better. Tonight I will ask again.\n\nCaswell swore, the good Irish old man swear. \u201cShe\u2019s inviting an audience. We need eyes.\u201d\n\nThey sent two units to the north river bend and two to the south and Poin took the central bridge herself. Frost flared in the beams. Breath rose like small storms. She leaned on the rail and watched the black slow muscle of the water.\n\n\u201cCity\u2019s spine,\u201d said a voice at her left. The blandly handsome man from the church stood there, hands open on the cold metal. A polite tourist. His hair slicked. A softer coat now, tan. \u201cYou ever feel like we\u2019re insects on a sleeping dog.\u201d\n\n\u201cI feel like we\u2019re insects,\u201d she said, and let the rest go. \u201cYou should head home. It\u2019s not safe.\u201d\n\n\u201cDetective Poin,\u201d he said, saying her name like a weather report. \u201cI liked your little speech. You looked bored.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou like everything?\u201d she said, not moving the weight of her body.\n\n\u201cNot everything,\u201d he said. He stretched his neck and the white healed line tugged and she thought: not a paper cut, a rope burn touched and removed. He didn\u2019t touch the line. He looked at her with that polite surface that you use with people you intend to leave immediately. Then he turned and walked down the bridge as if he had someplace he needed to be. He did not look back.\n\nFrom the north came a shout. From the south came a hand signal light to her left, two pulses. She spoke into the radio clipped to her coat and felt her mouth dry out further. The wind went through her coat like a needle. The river said nothing.\n\nShe stayed on the bridge until her toes went the numb that presaged later agony. Then she stayed another five minutes. When she finally moved, because her body insisted, because the human machine calls the shots no matter how much you think you are mind, her phone buzzed again.\n\nNice to see you in church, said the text.\n\nShe didn\u2019t answer. She walked, watched, stopped, breathed. She felt the far click-click of her jaw, which meant she needed to eat something that wasn\u2019t coffee or a regret. She found herself around the corner from the newsroom and kept moving past. The multi-plex lot threw a bruise of light across the sidewalk.\n\nShe unlocked her apartment door by muscle memory and felt a drift of cool air that murmured Not empty. Her hand went to nothing on her hip\u2014she was in a coat, no sidearm at home\u2014and then to the plastic toy sword in the corner, absurd, ridiculous. She held it anyway. It whined a tiny child\u2019s whine when she mashed the on button. The cheap green lit the room and made the plants look ill.\n\n\u201cCute,\u201d said a voice in the kitchen.\n\nShe lifted the toy. \u201cIf you move, this will not do anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d said the voice. \u201cI\u2019m tired of things working.\u201d\n\nShe took three steps and saw her reflection in the window. She saw a figure opposite it, someone wearing her coat. She saw her own coat on a stranger\u2019s shoulders. Then she blinked and the figure was her reflection only. Then she blinked again and noticed the sink light had been left on.\n\nThe note on the counter said:\n\nYou haven\u2019t noticed yet. That\u2019s okay.\n\nHer hands shook. The toy sword was nothing, a child\u2019s laugh. She moved through the rooms, checked the closets, the bathroom with its row of old hotel soaps she kept as if they were talismans. Nobody. She studied the note because the only thing to do with an object is to study it. The plastic of the cheap pen used, the tilt of the letters. They leaned left. The lowercase g had a curious hook.\n\nShe looked at her notebooks on the shelf. She pulled one out. Left-leaning letters in half the pages, right-hand script steady in the other half. The g was hers. The g was also not hers. She sat down hard in the chair like someone had removed the floor.\n\nThe phone chimed. Noah: I know, it\u2019s late again. We ran the movement patterns. Your pick is on six cameras, then none. He disappears behind two pillars in the library and then never exists. Ghost country. I don\u2019t like it.\n\nShe typed to him: Sleep. We\u2019ll just get worse if we don\u2019t.\n\nHe sent a thumbs up and a sticker of a cartoon ghost trying to hold a laptop.\n\nAt ten past midnight, the blog posted again. The entry was four sentences long.\n\nShe wrote:\n\nHe reached out like he wanted a blessing and I saw that he had no idea what a blessing was. I only take what is already offered. I only write what someone else has taught me to write. I learn. I learned from inside your walls. That made me laugh.\n\nPoin sat with her back to the room and her eyes on the window where the city rearranged itself like a slow-congealing dream. She thought of the scarf in the lobby, the hand on the phone, the way her own index finger followed the top edge. She thought of the voice in the church like a boat calling down to her. Of the doctor with the calm hands and the old names that were supposed to help.\n\nShe told herself, out loud, because sometimes the only thing that made the room real was sound: \u201cI know who you are.\u201d\n\nIn the window, in the faint reflection, something like a second pair of eyes blinked. Or she did. Or both. The radiator banged once, twice, then went soft, as if embarrassed. Pieces clicked behind her temples in a pattern like rain.\n\nShe turned off the toy sword and set it against the wall. She picked up a pen she didn\u2019t remember pocketing, the blue cap warm from her skin, and wrote on a fresh page in a fresh book: We are not going to let her keep the ledger. We are going to write another book.\n\nHer hand shook at the end. The g hooked in that curious way, then corrected itself, the hook straightened on the next line. In the hallway outside her door a neighbor coughed very softly, a human cough, like an apology for existing at this hour. The trains, at last, fell quiet. The city waited for the ice to make up its mind. Poin sat very still, and somewhere in a room behind a wall, somebody else did too. Or it was only her, pretending to be more than one thing, because that is what survival had taught her to do. She put the cap on the pen and did not look at the clock because she knew it would fail to be kind. She listened. She practiced attention. She let the thunder step back just enough, not gone, never gone, just to the edge of the field.\n\nOut there, in the black seam of the river, a thing moved that was not water. Or maybe it was water pretending to be someone else. She would go in the morning. She would go before it remembered her face. She would go and touch the rail and wait and watch and be boring and true.\n\nAnd somewhere, a voice made itself ready to tell a story about what she was, and what she wasn\u2019t, and how one could be a monster and a ledger and a detective and a myth. The city hummed. A draft lifted a corner of the note on the counter. The plastic sword leaned a little more towards its own surrender.\n\nPoin curled herself around the center of her body and breathed, counted, up to four, down to four, like she was building a small bridge over a very cold part of a river. She slept. Or she didn\u2019t. The page didn\u2019t care. The night kept going. The ledger waited for a new hand. The chapter line, if there were a chapter line printed in air, would have looked like a horizon nobody would recognize until it was too late.The river came on like it had slept in a bad bed. Poin went there before the frost had decided whether it would commit; the breath of the water met the breath of the city and they argued in low voices, white against white. She wore a hat she found by the door that didn\u2019t belong to her and let it be a mystery for later. The bench from the photo had kept its appointment with dawn. The slatted seat was a ledger in miniature, wet lines and wet lines and the tiny math of melting ice between. She stood and let the pulse in her left temple ease against the metal rail, the cold a correction that didn\u2019t feel punitive. Something tapped under the bridge with a patient metronomic insistence. She thought for a moment it was a damaged pipe. Then the tick came again, not a pipe\u2019s language but the one musicians used when they promised to be better.\n\nShe saw it because she had trained for things that would prefer not to be seen. Four feet out from the bend of the railing, a plastic-wrapped block bobbed and resisted the current the way an animal will to show it understands it can\u2019t win. It had been tethered to the undergrid with black cord and a fisherman\u2019s knot, neat and prideful. The wrap had fogged from within, a poor choice of bag for someone who liked order, or a choice made because the look of the thing was more important than the preservation. She watched it tick and thought of the old music building a block off, its gutters sighing at her earlier in the week like a tired aunt. She looked for an easy way to reach, found a fallen branch with a fork like a crooked hand, and lay herself down on the slick concrete in a way that would make Caswell call her a saint or a fool. She hooked the fork under the cord and drew the package across without letting it bang against the concrete wall. It came up like a captured thought. The tick did not apologize for being obvious.\n\n\u201cWhat do you say,\u201d she murmured to the morning because nobody else was brought to listen, and only then did she think to text for a unit. The bag had a seam of dissolving tape at the top and the condensation inside had written its own fog script on the walls. She didn\u2019t open it with her teeth the way an ignorant person might because muscle memory had been trained out of that than by a dozen lectures with slides. A patrolman who looked too new for his boots stepped up behind her and said her title with that hesitant make-sure-you\u2019re-a-person-and-not-something-I-invented tone that rookies wore like a starched collar. She had him call for evidence while she touched nothing and everything with her eyes. The metronome inside was wood, not plastic, triangular and dignified even under its saran shroud, the way old things are when they have survived flood and neglect. There was a number burned into the base where the varnish had gone thin from fingers: KH-213. Her mouth did a thing that was both a smile and a flinch. Kunstler Hall, probably; two hundred-level room, likely the practice suites along the north corridor. The killer had not gone to the trouble of purchasing an anonymous metronome from a chain store. The killer had borrowed. The killer had taken something that would be missed.\n\nCaswell arrived with coffee that had been brave once. He made a noise he made when he saw a thing that felt like an insult. \u201cThis is theater,\u201d he said, and then he put the coffee on the ground like he was laying it in state so he could use his hands to point at the world. \u201cShe\u2019s staging these beats. She wants us to hear a tick. She thinks we can\u2019t hear our own.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe wants us in the right room,\u201d Poin said. She watched condensation coalesce and run like teardrops then laughed a little at herself for the metaphor. She had rules for what to believe in, and one was that objects don\u2019t cry for you unless you tell them how. She angled her head at the hall up the hill. \u201cLet\u2019s go see who missed their timekeeper.\u201d\n\nThe Kunstler building had been built in a year when legislators had loved ships; the ceiling in the lobby had ribs like a hull and if you lay down on the tile, which Poin had once done after an alumni party as a dare, you could imagine yourself pinned under a boat that had decided to stop floating. The receptionist\u2019s desk held a jar of earplugs and a bowl of peppermint candies and a little sign that said Please assume a class is going on. The woman behind the desk wore her hair in a bun so tight it read as professionalism and not punishment. Poin showed a badge and the burned number. The woman\u2019s eyes sharpened and then softened and then sharpened again, the way people\u2019s did when their job collided with a larger story. \u201cWe log everything,\u201d she said, and Poin already liked her. \u201cYou think it\u2019s one of ours?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it was meant to tell me it\u2019s one of yours,\u201d Poin said. She kept neutral pronouns in place because language could talk people into seeing things they hadn\u2019t. The woman, whose lanyard said ARMITAGE and who liked peppermint because her breath smelled faintly of it, pulled out a binder old enough to have known rain.\n\n\u201cWe had a theft,\u201d Armitage said. \u201cLast week, day after your thing with the cameras. Someone posted a review of our noon program and then someone else mentioned, as an aside, that the third-floor bathrooms had no hand soap, and then our night manager noticed a metronome gone from 213. I wrote the report out of habit; they told me don\u2019t bother the police with a forty-dollar object when the whole world is on fire. I sometimes like to pretend that my job counts, so I wrote the report anyway.\u201d\n\nPoin liked her more than was professional. She smoothed the page Armitage handed her. The report had neat lines and block print and a stamp that meant nothing legal and everything important inside an institution: documented. Poin noted the time, the staff signature, the name of a student who had been last on the room schedule before the loss: J. REY. She told herself not to get romantic about an initial that could belong to any of a thousand people. The room itself felt like most practice rooms felt: a padded coffin with a window. She let herself sit on the piano bench because sitting teaches the room something about you and she preferred to tell rooms that she wouldn\u2019t break them if they didn\u2019t break her. The metronome had left a dust-free triangle on the shelf, a ghost of a ghost. The wall above the piano had the usual rash of tacked things: a poster for a string quartet series that had started three Tuesdays ago, a flyer for a winter formal with a drawing of a snowflake that had been too optimistically complex, a comic in which a conductor yelled at a cat. There was also, at the edge, a piece of grid paper with a practice chart: Monday Scales, Tuesday Etudes, Wednesday Repertoire, neat lines made by a student who wanted a life to be a ledger that wanted her back.\n\nShe asked Armitage to print the room log for 213 for the last two weeks and to not tell anyone that the police had asked for it until Poin could be out of the building. Armitage said \u201cI can do discretion, detective,\u201d in a tone that made Poin think about choir directors she had known who could silence an auditorium with a hand. A custodian wheeled a cart past and nodded at Poin as if they had seen each other at the river. She watched his hands without making it weird. He had a small scar by the knuckle where a splinter had gotten uppity. He said, \u201cWe had a woman in that day with a scarf and an attitude. Said she was here to see if we were ADA compliant. I tried to help and she made a face like I\u2019d given her a plate of hair.\u201d\n\n\u201cDay,\u201d Poin said, because she would take any scrap and ask it for its coat. \u201cTuesday?\u201d\n\n\u201cTuesday,\u201d he said, and added, \u201cThe one with all the press.\u201d He looked as if he had laughed in the privacy of his own throat at least once that day, at something he would not tell. Poin asked him gently to describe scarf woman, and he did: average height in a coat the color of sidewalk, scarf blue because he had a thirteen-year-old daughter who knew blues, shoes flat like a kindergarten teacher\u2019s shoes. He made a rectangle with his hands when she asked him about phones, because we all do that gesture now, and she thought of a scarf lit from below by a dim aquarium glow in a lobby camera.\n\nOn the way out of Kunstler a small pair of bass notes leaked from a room like an apology for the noise that would follow later, and at the end of the hall an open door breathed out a smell of rosin. Poin kept a hand loose in her pocket over the blue pen she didn\u2019t remember pocketing, a small self-intervention. She wanted to talk to J. Rey because the name on the practice log felt like a needle threading through separate cloth. Armitage put a fingertip to a faculty roster and found a student: Juliana Rey, sophomore, cello, River Program scholarship. Poin decided to call later because saying the wrong sentence to a nineteen-year-old with a scholarship could feel like dropping a weight onto a web. She left Armitage with a peppermint thank-you that she didn\u2019t suck because some childish superstition insisted that if you put a candy in your mouth before noon you were telling the day how it could go.\n\nInternal Affairs wanted her back at the building and they wanted her yesterday. They had built a conference room tableau in neutral blue: screen, pitcher of water that would not taste like water, two men who had practiced their expressions in college and groups since. Captain Lott had a jaw that had been fed the right kind of fight and another guy\u2014Stills, with hair that wanted to leave the party but hadn\u2019t found its coat yet\u2014did the kind head tilt of someone who had, somewhere in his house, a book about microexpressions and their uses. They did not ask her to sit but they had put a chair in such a way that to stand was to make a point and she had already made enough points to last a lifetime, so she sat.\n\nLott pointed to the paused lobby footage like God pointing to a fresco if God had grown tired. He tapped a finger on the blur that could be anyone. He said what he had to say; he said it slow because slowness is an interrogation technique. \u201cWe are required to notify you that a device inside this building was used to access what we\u2019re calling the Giselle content portal. We are required to tell you that the time stamps intersect with the presser last week, at which you were present. We are required to tell you that because the access was through the guest network, the device could have been anywhere in the building, and because of the way the routes were rear-ended into the secure network, we don\u2019t know more. We are required to say that you are not a suspect. We are also required to ask you where you were when your face wasn\u2019t on all the screens.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was standing in the lobby being told I looked like weather,\u201d Poin said. She did not mention the plastic sword. She did not mention the feeling she had of being a house with one room she didn\u2019t go into after dark. Stills asked her to describe the scarf a person had been wearing, as if she were the one who had picked it out, and she reminded him that the scarf in the video had been a smear and that colors aren\u2019t colors in LED memory. Lott asked her if she had let anyone use her credentials; she said no. He asked her if she ever used the guest network; she said she didn\u2019t even use her own network unless Noah told her a story about what would happen if she didn\u2019t. He asked to look at her phone and she said yes, because it was either that or walk out and make a fight she\u2019d know how to win only after it was over.\n\nThey kept her phone long enough that she felt both nude and ridiculous for feeling nude. She watched the two men watching her, the way an actor watches an audience through a scrim. Lott had the grace to admit this was performance with real consequences. \u201cWe are doing this with everyone in the building,\u201d he said, not even pretending that she would believe him without evidence. \u201cWe are also sending you nowhere alone until I tell you different. Pair up or shout. I\u2019ve got half the city council wanting me to stand at the next podium and say we have everything under control. I have the other half wanting me to apologize for existing. You are in the middle and so am I. Congratulations.\u201d\n\nShe took her phone back and felt its weight with a careful part of her mind. She could have told him about the text in the church. She could have told him the careful truth that there were parts of her day she didn\u2019t always remember in crisp lines. She could have told him that there was a letter in her bag that smelled like a drugstore aisle where someone had once chosen hope. She told him she had found a metronome with a burn mark, because that was solvable. His eyebrows did a small remark when she said the initials KH. He said, \u201cYou think it\u2019s a game,\u201d and she said, \u201cI think the playing is the point,\u201d and then Stills, who had been pretending to be a fern, said, \u201cGiselle is a ballet about a dead girl who dances men to their deaths,\u201d and Poin wanted, with an ugly suddenness, to tell him to shut all the way up. She added a quiet \u201cthank you\u201d instead because not every unhelpful fact should be punished.\n\nNoah found her in the copy room pretending to need copies like everybody else in there actually needed copies. He held a stack of printouts in one hand and a bag of peanuts in the other and looked like an owl who had stayed up too late at a rave. He had energy nobody owned. He pushed the peanuts at her like they were medicine and she took them and didn\u2019t argue with that logic. He showed her the grid he had promised and a second grid he had not promised, one for the library that had swallowed the man with the polite face and had not returned him. \u201cWatch,\u201d he said, in the tone of a magician who recognizes that he can\u2019t control the lighting but will make do. He scrubbed through the library\u2019s interior cameras around the hour when their non-face had vanished. There were two pillars and a lot of stacks. People moved in patterns that looked almost musical, loops and breaks. Their man slid behind pillar one, and the angle to pillar two should have caught him as he crossed and it did not. Noah flipped to a feed for the opposite corner and the man did not arrive. He flipped to the staff door around the corner and nothing. He flipped again to an overhead that was only there because Noah had convinced a budget committee that sometimes birds\u2019 eyes were worth paying for. There, a staff cart had been parked in a way that made a blind wedge when the two camera cones intersected. The man stepped into the wedge and then the wedge remained but contained no man. The staff door never opened. The vent grate two feet off the floor had been unscrewed and then screwed back, which Noah would not have noticed and Poin would have noticed only if her head had been a quieter place that day. In the feed\u2019s flat light the screws shone like wet eyes going to sleep.\n\n\u201cHow big is that vent,\u201d Poin said, because sometimes the answer is as stupid and unsatisfying as math.\n\n\u201cNot big enough if you live on a planet with gravity,\u201d Noah said. He rubbed his knuckles and added, \u201cUnless you are somebody who practiced being a ghost. There\u2019s crawlspace; there\u2019s duct, there\u2019s an exit into a ladder alcove that they built in the seventies when everyone was afraid of fire and not as afraid of surveillance. The blueprint suggests a dead end, except the blueprint is wrong or out of date. I went there; I\u2019m not supposed to go there. The paint is new on the vent, which means someone touched it recently and wanted it to be invisible and failed because new paint is a kind of spotlight from a certain angle.\u201d\n\n\u201cI like you,\u201d Poin said, and meant it the way you say to a person who has just taken a job with you into a room where the floor will sometimes move. He put the peanut bag in her hand when she hesitated and said, \u201cEat, or I tell Caswell you were driving a low blood sugar rocket into crime scenes.\u201d\n\nShe went to the library with a toddler\u2019s backpack because a bright yellow thing made people see a person differently, and even though she felt foolish for gaming that, she did it anyway. The reference desk woman, Halladay, had carved cheekbones and a haircut that said give me practical or get out of my face. Poin recognized a kindred religion: attention as a gift, rules as a kindness. Halladay knew her by name because every city has the same thirty people who know and be known. \u201cDetective,\u201d she said. \u201cWe used to check out detectives in books. Now we get to check them out in real life, which I can\u2019t recommend.\u201d\n\nPoin let her laugh like a cough and asked about the pillars and the carts. Halladay did not say don\u2019t be ridiculous because she had learned by profession that what looks ridiculous at the front desk often gets practical in the stacks. She said, \u201cWe had a maintenance request the day after the big presser. The ladder alcove had a burnt-out fixture. It\u2019s a nothing door. Staff only so that the students don\u2019t climb a ladder and discover gravity. But maintenance was late and the light was out and somebody could have felt very good about not being seen. Also, I found this this morning.\u201d She handed Poin a bookmark. It was one of the library\u2019s normal ones, inspirational quote on one side about the democracy of reading, on the other a grid of ledger lines drawn over the quote in pencil, numbers in the boxes like a child\u2019s pretend accounting. Some of the numbers were circled with care. Halladay said, \u201cWe keep pencils at the desk and the kids are terrible with them, but this pencil was strange. It made a squeak on the paper like a violin that forgot where to put its fingers. I threw the pencil out, so if you need me to redo my mistake in a less helpful way, I can\u2019t.\u201d\n\nPoin held the bookmark like a fossil. The numbers had a date pattern logic if you squinted, the way lawyers in shows squint at things until they are the shape of victory. She saw 11, 23, 17, 4, 213. She saw an initial clipped on one axis: R. She saw the alphabet counted like pennies. She told herself she was not a cryptographer. She told herself that the brain will bend numbers until they say what you want. She also told herself to keep it. Halladay added, \u201cThere are ledgers downstairs in the city records, if ledgers are your kink. The old tax books are bound like bibles. People come on Tuesdays and turn the pages to make sure the dead still owe them. It\u2019s good Tuesday sport.\u201d\n\nDownstairs, the city\u2019s paper skeleton slept behind glass. Poin asked an assistant with sweater fuzz under his nails if she could look at the 1970s volume for municipal improvements and he looked both proud and afraid to be asked. He brought her a book that weighed the same as a cinderblock made by saints. She spread it on the table and thought of her father\u2019s hands at that metal high school podium, rough from work and gentle in ways he never knew how to measure. In the 1972 column for the renovation of that very library, a line mentioned a ladder alcove created for maintenance, with a small appendix note that the ventilation access had been \u201ctemporarily extended\u201d pending funding. The funding had not come. The temporary had lived long enough to eat through three marriages and four mayors. Someone had drawn a small square in the margin decades ago and initialed it R.E.H., which Poin knew stood for Richard E. Halliday because the basement loved to know the names of its own former gods. She thought about how spaces make their own quiet treaties with time and with the people who learn those treaties and exploit them. She thought about the man who had put his neck into a rope once and won the argument. She thought about the text in the church that had come out of nowhere and smelled like someone watching.\n\nHer phone lived under her hand like a sleeping animal. It woke with the polite shudder of a message because phones had learned to apologize for their own intrusions. Caswell had written: We\u2019re sending unis to Kunstler rooms in rotation. I told them if they see a woman with a scarf to ask her to knit us all hats. He had added a wry face because he was a man of his time. Noah had sent: The metronome is from a batch ordered by the school in 2004. They engraved numbers because people like to keep track of their few honest tools. He added: I like that someone taught you to eat peanuts again. The text that wasn\u2019t from either of them came to her without a name but with the confidence of someone who believed, with some reason, that they could rent space in her head for free. It said, I was early. You were late. The river is different when no one is singing to it.\n\nShe typed the first thing that came, which was not the smartest thing and not the dumbest. She wrote, You can stop now. The answer came as if it had been written in advance and set to a timer to make her feel small. It read, That sentence never stops being funny when it comes from people like you.\n\nShe left the ledgers open because closing them felt like erasing something. She set the bookmark down like a small promise. She moved back through the library and the pillars and did not, because she was trying very hard to act like a person others would not need to rescue, go into the alcove. She would go later, with Noah, with a light and a rope and an agreement about how long to wait. The thing she could do today was go to J. Rey\u2019s dorm and not ruin a college student because some adult had decided to make a story that pleased them.\n\nJuliana Rey opened her door with reluctance and hair in rebellion. Her room had a cello case leaning in the corner like an older sister. Her roommate had had the good sense to go elsewhere. Poin showed badge and hands-not-a-threat and asked if the student had lost a metronome. The girl, who had the face that people invent when they think of serious young women, said, \u201cThey said not to bother. Ms. Armitage said it would show up in a closet with the old stands.\u201d She half-grinned, the kind of grin people deploy when they are aware of adults\u2019 propensity to minimize their losses. \u201cWhy do you care about forty dollars.\u201d\n\nPoin told her the truth and then the bigger, lonelier truth. She said, \u201cBecause someone who wants attention wants you to see the path they made. If I ignore the metronome, I let them think they can make any path and we\u2019ll pretend they didn\u2019t. If I follow it, I make them decide whether they really wanted me to be right behind them.\u201d Juliana considered that and then said, \u201cThere was a woman here last week. Ten minutes after my practice slot, she was in the hall, or the hall refused to be empty and she was the shape it made. I thought she was a parent. She watched me sign out. She asked me if anyone knew my schedule. It made me mad; then it made me feel like a kid. I told her to ask the office. She said she already had.\u201d\n\nPoin stayed in the doorway until she had a sense of the girl that would make her useful later but not so much that she\u2019d become a figure in Poin\u2019s own ledger. The cello case\u2019s latches had been polished by long use. On the desk a diary sat open because the young sometimes trust the world to be better than it is. Poin didn\u2019t read words that weren\u2019t her business. She noted the handwriting: left tilt, right tilt, the way adolescent alphabets learn to switch masks. She thanked Juliana and did not use her first name because it would have been an intimacy she could not afford. In the hall she listened to distant practice and of course someone was playing a melody that wanted to be ballet, but it wasn\u2019t Giselle, it was something more obvious, and so she let herself unclench for half a breath.\n\nNight decided to arrive early like a guest who had nowhere else to be. The ADA, all careful hair and careful speech wrapped around a human who had chosen a difficult job for reasons Poin could respect on certain days, cornered her by the elevator and repeated the chosen phrases of the week: community, patience, trust. Poin nodded and said, \u201cWe are not here to turn this into a duel,\u201d in a tone that suggested that she had already heard the headline where someone chose to treat the city like a boxing ring. The ADA put a hand on her forearm in a way that would have been solidarity in a different world. \u201cCareful,\u201d the ADA said. \u201cPeople like to throw rope to heroes and then tighten it.\u201d\n\nAt home, the apartment met her with the stale breath of a place that had held a stranger. She stood outside her own door for long enough to count to twelve and then made another decision. She called her neighbor, Mrs. Liu, ninety-three and sharper than her knives, and asked if she would like to come stand in Poin\u2019s kitchen and tell Poin if anything had been moved. Mrs. Liu arrived in slippers that had seen more of the world than their fabric advertised and a cardigan with pearls that had decided to stay with it out of love, not duty. She sniffed and frowned and went to the window and tapped the toy sword with a finger as if to make it announce itself. \u201cYou left your bowl wrong,\u201d Mrs. Liu said. \u201cYou always leave it inside the sink. Today it\u2019s on the counter like you want to pretend you didn\u2019t dirty it. Very silly.\u201d She pointed at a chair. \u201cAnd you left the chair not how you leave your chair. You like the scrape. Today there is no scrape. You were not alone or you were not you. Have soup. You look like a person who would believe anything if they thought it would stop a headache.\u201d\n\nPoin ladled soup from a container because saying no to Mrs. Liu once had felt like she was slapping a statue of a saint. She ate it and felt her jaw stop clicking for three minutes. She showed Mrs. Liu the note on the counter and Mrs. Liu said, \u201cChildish handwriting of an adult. Or the other way around. We can find out which if you give me a pen and a person.\u201d That made Poin bark a laugh that hurt and helped. After Mrs. Liu left, carrying half her own soup back up to the land of plants and radio programs, Poin stood in the middle of the room and said her own first and last name out loud to see if it felt like a thing someone else could wear. It did and it didn\u2019t. Her phone made the whale noise she had set for Noah because a joke had to live somewhere.\n\nHe had something that prickled and soothed at once. \u201cRan your coat guy,\u201d he said over a connection that turned his voice into an older radio. \u201cThe balsa-wood handsome? He is a man who does not exist and nevertheless owed a library late fee in 2009. Name attached to the card: Evan Jeffer, which sounds fake. The address attached was a building they knocked down in 2013 to make a dog park. His face refuses to settle itself for the software. Looks like a person who studied how to be not seen and then had the courage to be boring about it. He is on six cameras and then he isn\u2019t. I took apart the vent cover and got yelled at by a person whose job is to yell when you take apart vent covers. There is dust inside that has stories, and in the dust we have a smear that wants to be glove latex. He is glove careful. He is exactly as careful as someone who reads blogs about himself and thinks everyone else is the audience.\u201d\n\n\u201cGlove latex says he bleeds or expects to touch something that does,\u201d Poin said, and she could hear Noah nod through the static. She told him not to go back alone and he lied politely, which meant he understood her and would ignore her. She planned in the back of her head to go break into the library after three a.m. and be a hypocrite in the service of something larger. She put this plan on the mental shelf where plans sit and hum until the body permits them to be carried out. The blog posted again at nine thirty, because of course it did, because the blog had learned from a city\u2019s hunger how to feed it without ever using a spoon. The post was short and contemptuous of shortness at the same time. It read:\n\nOrder is an invention. Everyone pretends it existed first. My house had rules because it didn\u2019t, and your house does too. I am patient with your panic. I have tried on your names for me and they do not fit. When I say ledger I mean a story that remembers. When I say boy I mean a person who was allowed a map and told the town was his field. When I say inside your walls I mean the place where your masks sleep.\n\nCaswell sent, simply, \u201cChrist,\u201d because curses sometimes were prayers where there had been no room for prayer. The ADA texted, \u201cWe need to say something,\u201d and then immediately texted again, \u201cWe need to say less,\u201d which was funny if you were the kind of person who let things be funny. Poin typed nothing. She turned the toy sword on and let its pathetic glow be the only light in the room for the count of twelve. The radiators in the building woke as if they had been given a second shift without warning. Someone below her put on a record, and of course it was a violin and of course it was not quite in tune and of course it was perfect for a night that didn\u2019t know what to call itself. She wrote three lines in a notebook, her right hand steady, her left hand curious. She noticed, with that clean attention she liked to remember to use on herself, that she wanted to hook her g again and that she could choose not to. She chose not to on purpose once and then chose to again because she didn\u2019t like the feeling of erasure that came with correcting.\n\nThe river before dawn the next day had teeth. Poin stood on the bridge again because she had decided she did not like being told where to stand, and sometimes the only way to reassert ownership of your body was to put it in a place someone thinks they own. A shadow moved and it was not hers; she felt it and then she saw it, a person in a tan coat like the bridge had given birth to him. He did that easy posture thing again, hands visible, as if he had been taught once the way to not frighten horses. His mouth made the show of an almost-smile a man will use to ask for sugar in a diner. \u201cDetective Poin,\u201d he said, and his voice sat in the air without hurrying its own end. \u201cDid you sleep. You don\u2019t look like you slept.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou remind me of a lesson,\u201d she said, and she didn't even try to cut the weird out of her words. \u201cAbout how ghosts are just people who learned not to cast a shadow where the light wants one. Tell me your name and we can stop pretending we aren\u2019t both playing a part.\u201d\n\nHe looked at the water as if it might answer for him. He lifted his hand as if to touch the railing and then did not, and she saw the rope scar again ghost under skin, the white thin of it like a seam. He said, \u201cI can tell you something true and it will not be useful. I am here because the river makes nonsense behave for a minute. I am also here because you are predictable and so am I.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou were at the church,\u201d she said, because leaving the obvious unsaid was a strategy for people who wanted to be in love with their own cleverness. \u201cYou check your phone while kneeling. Your head tilts like you learned it from a mirror. You hide from cameras like you wrote a guide.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hide from cameras because they don\u2019t love me,\u201d he said, and there was something childish and offensive in it at once. \u201cIf you catch me, Detective, it will be because I decide to set down the rope the same minute you decide to pick it up. I hope when we get there neither of us is bored.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome of us would like to prevent a murder,\u201d she said. She realized her hand had reached for a thing that wasn\u2019t on her hip because certain movements are drills that the body rehearses without permission. He noticed her noticing and his mouth did something that had probably once charmed someone. He said, \u201cThen prevent it,\u201d and by the time she said, \u201cDon\u2019t leave,\u201d he had obeyed physics and not her, and his back was already committing to the walk that took you off the bridge and into the city\u2019s harder rooms.\n\nShe did not chase him because there were six ways to die on a bridge if you let your anger be in charge. She went to the south bend because the blog had liked the word tonight and she wanted to preemptively hate whatever it had planned. The water carried a dusting of broken mirror where the thin ice fractured and reknit. She leaned out too far and let herself be afraid with her whole body for one second so that the fear would be a thing she could swallow. The metronome\u2019s tick had stopped because they had taken it away. The silence didn\u2019t fill the space so much as keep it; that was a lesson she had learned from rooms where people pray and rooms where people confess and rooms where people die.\n\nNoah met her at the south bend with a wool hat that had been his sister\u2019s and a grin that belonged to a different hour. \u201cYou\u2019re going to love this,\u201d he said, because his joy in the work was made of some material that did not degrade under pressure. \u201cYou asked about the stub in the blog draft. I assumed she only made that mistake once. She made it twice. It\u2019s like the part of her that is neat has a cousin that gets bored and chews curtains. We have a second partial, same network bounce, different time. I cross-checked with the building\u2019s badge swipes because I like being fired, and I promise you I will get fired later for this in a spectacular fashion, and we have a cluster of three that make sense. Three people in the building who used guest wi-fi while here with their badge on the day of the presser. People forget their own rules when the room is loud. I can show you a list. You will hate one name.\u201d\n\n\u201cGive me the list,\u201d she said, and he gave it to her and she hated a name on it that belonged to her, because she had in fact hopped off the secure network when the lobby jammed, because she had in fact told herself it was simpler than wrangling with the department\u2019s own fussy gate, because she had in fact allowed convenience to be louder than paranoia for half a minute. She saw another name that belonged to Stills because the fern had been checking football scores in between playing good cop and plant. She saw another that belonged to Armitage because Armitage had posted a flier to the school board forum in a moment between running the office and something else. Noah put a thumb on the page by a fourth name that had no corresponding badge but had logged into the guest network long enough to be counted: Jermain Park, a temp who had been brought in to help with crowd control, whose temp agency address was a P.O. box in a building that hadn\u2019t existed since the last mayor had promised to get serious about rats. Noah said, \u201cYou like that I learned to love boring things.\u201d\n\nShe put a finger to her own name on the sheet, because you name your own guilt or it names you. \u201cThis,\u201d she said, gently, like the time in high school when she had spoken to the child of a drunk teacher and told him a truth in a hallway and watched it land like an egg that would hatch later. Noah said, \u201cI know. You were on guest because it\u2019s faster and your phone stops nagging you. I can read your soul like a system log.\u201d He tapped the \u201ctemp\u201d name. \u201cThis is the index card I want to follow under the door with a string attached.\u201d\n\nThey followed it. It took them to a warehouse of cheap offices papered in signs that said words like solutions and synergy in fonts that had made bad men rich. The receptionist had the enviable lack of interest of someone who has learned that secrets are only of value to the people who don\u2019t deserve them. The temp company\u2019s owner had a ring whose stone would have knocked a person out if deployed correctly. He insisted his staff were not criminals until Poin told him she was not saying they were, and then he insisted that if they were, it was only because the city had forced them to be. They found the name on a roster. They found a photo attached to it that was not Evan Jeffer and not their bridge man and not any man Poin had ever seen. They found that Jermain Park had been on assignment somewhere else the day of the presser and that his timesheet had been signed by a person whose signature had been practiced by someone using their left hand on a moving bus. The owner tried to sell Poin a staffing plan. Noah smiled at him like a boy playing with a knife and watched the older man\u2019s eyes clock the thing he could not figure out how to fear.\n\nAt dusk, the church on Ryal made a sound like wood trying not to remember fire. Poin went there not because the letter had asked but because the letter had offered a room where she could hear how her own feet hit the floor. The old woman with the candle had returned as if assigned to the place by a god who likes symmetry. Poin sat in the pew where she had sat before and made herself sit without calculation for the time it takes to boil an egg. She held the phone where she couldn\u2019t read it and waited for the idea to stop roaring. A man in the back coughed twice and then stopped because of shame. Outside, the river remembered ice. Inside, the statue of Jesus continued to be assembled from other Jesuses and be unbothered by it. When she stood, a small scrap of paper slid off the hymnal shelf as if it had been saved for her by a mischievous altar boy long since dead. It said, in a hand that leaned left, Bring the sword.\n\nShe took the plastic toy to the library because it was absurd and therefore exactly the right instrument for a night like that. Noah rolled his eyes at her until she explained and then he rolled them differently, the way someone does when they have to admit your weirdness and their respect have become one thing. They went into the staff hallway after hours because Halladay had blessed them with a look that said if you die here I will be annoyed but not surprised. They brought a light and a real rope and a second person waiting at the door with the same name as Caswell but a different shape. The vent had the fresh metal tang of new paint and she could see fingerprints in the brushstrokes at the exact height of a person teaching themselves to hide. Noah unscrewed the cover because he claimed to have small hands, and he did, and the second person with Caswell\u2019s responsibility but not his tongue watched the hall with the half-sleeping attention of a parent at a playground. The duct was a throat and a lie. It let them crawl a yard and then it let them crawl three and then it let them choose left or right. The draft came from right, which meant that left had a secret or a dead end.\n\nShe went left because she had promised herself once in a room with calm hands that she would occasionally decline the obvious. The left ended in a small pocket the size of a confession with a flattened paper coffee cup and a pencil stub and a scrap of a schedule torn from a bulletin sheet. The schedule had the practice rooms listed. The pencil had teeth marks on it. She thought of Halladay\u2019s squeaking lead. She took the pencil without touching the teeth-mark end because some hygienic habits will finally take. She looked at the wall inside the pocket and saw someone had drawn a grid, small and precise, with enough lines to comfort themselves, enough columns to suggest a science. In a corner of the grid a word had been written and then erased and then written again in a different hand: attention. She did not pretend not to be moved.\n\nWhen she backed out of the duct she put the plastic sword in first as a joke to herself and also to have something to shove at a person if a person appeared. The sword whined and made its hideous child noise as it scraped and she thought, a person inside here would not be frightened by that sound because the joke would be obvious to them too. She came out dusty and sweating and Caswell\u2019s deputy gave her a look like she had committed a small crime against common sense. Noah came out and lifted a hand like a taxi. He said, \u201cI found the glove,\u201d and he had, a wadded thing tucked into the crease where dust turned to fur. It was blue, kitchen-grade, the kind a person would keep in a box under their sink if they were the kind of person who kept boxes under their sink. He held it in a bag that made a tiny crinkle like an indignity. He said, \u201cThere will be nothing on it. Or there will be a thing on it we will think is everything and later decide was nothing. I\u2019m showing it to you because you like objects to tell you when they lie.\u201d\n\nShe wanted to kiss him on the forehead like a saint and then punch herself for the thought. She handed him the pencil. He looked at the teeth marks, frowned in that slow serious way he had when the stupid world demanded a brilliant man use his full brain on something a squirrel would have solved, and said, \u201cOkay. This is a thing we can measure. Teeth marks are like snowflakes you can touch.\u201d He made a noise like someone apologizing to his own excitement and then he took the bag away like a person carrying a newborn with a criminal record.\n\nOn the way out of the library a group of students with midterms on their faces brushed past. One wore a scarf the exact blue Armitage had named. Poin did not flinch; she was training herself to not turn every color into a weapon. Outside, the night had decided on cold. The river took that decision and made it doctrine. Her phone had saved a message for when she returned aboveground. It said: It bothers you that you like the sword. It bothers you that you like your own name in other people\u2019s mouths. It bothers you that you can make yourself charming when you want to and that sometimes you do. It does not bother me. I do not need to lie to myself about what I am.\n\nShe typed, You are a person, which is the only category I care about, and the answer came with almost mechanical speed, which meant it had been sitting there, heavy on some finger, waiting. It said, I am a chorus. You know the feeling.\n\nShe did not answer because the thing you starve sometimes dies. She walked the long way home, past the warehouse mural where a woman with a wrench had been painted bigger than the sky, past the lot where the dog park had erased the temp agency\u2019s mailbox, past three windows in which televisions had made different rooms the same. She let herself in and checked the bowl and the chair like a woman devoted to ritual. The bowl was in the sink; the chair had its scrape. She put the toy sword on the table and thought it looked like a spine that had made bad choices. She set the pencil beside it in its small bag and the glove in its bigger bag and she wrote on a clean sheet in large letters with a pen she knew for a fact was hers: Who is us. She underlined the us because multiple is a word that disciplines itself better when kept on a leash. She ate bread dry and stood at the window and counted the lights of passing trains like a person counting their own bones. Somewhere under the river skin, a thing moved that was not merely water again, and she told herself that if she went out now she would be serving an appetite and not a need. She did not go.\n\nIn the morning the Chronicle put her face next to an artist\u2019s rendering of a faceless woman in a scarf, and the headline used the word ledger twice, which made something old and weary in Poin put its head on a desk. In the lab, Noah had set up a small shrine to teeth. He had taken photographs of bite patterns in gum he had made interns chew when they were bored and had printed out a cross-section of the pencil\u2019s little wounds. He played the radio too loud because it kept his brain from climbing out of his skull. He said, \u201cIf I ask you for a bite, that will be weird in a way that will later get me sent to training, right,\u201d and Poin said, \u201cAbsolutely. Let me go find a citizen we hate.\u201d They compromised by asking three officers and one janitor and a volunteer from the records department who loved science, then thrown what they learned against the grooves on the pencil and watched what stuck. Science would tell them later if the person who had chewed had been a woman who took her anger out on harmless wood or a man who did the same; science would tell them later they were bigots for asking that question. For now, Noah loved the data, even if later he would have to confess to the data that he had used it like a drunk uses a lamppost, for support and not illumination.\n\nA body surfaced at the north bend at dusk. It was not a boy from the river bars and it was not a boy at all. It was a man who had been dead long enough to make days a joke. The river had tucked him in and then changed its mind. His pockets had receipts from 2019 and a movie stub for a film that had been in love with its own meanness. His neck had nothing to tell the report. Caswell said, \u201cIt\u2019s a decoy,\u201d and then hated himself for saying decoy about a person who had once had a breakfast routine. The blog did not post. The silence felt like a loving hand holding the mouth. Poin looked at the dead and looked at the city and made herself say, in her head and then out loud to the quietest wall she owned, that she would not let the ledger be only one person\u2019s math. She went to her desk and found that the anonymous letter-writer from Ryal had sent another page, this one without perfume, which for some reason moved her more. It said, The floorboards know the names. If you bring chalk, they will tell you where to stand. It added, Does this make me an accessory, and then, with a small unfunny smile drawn by the word, I am not joking, and then, Please.\n\nShe bought chalk as if she were a child walking to recess. She put it in her pocket and felt it grind into a line of dust under her knuckles. She didn\u2019t tell anyone. She shouldn\u2019t have gone alone. She went anyway. The church was empty of candles and heavy with wood. The floorboards in front of the fourth pew from the back had scratches not made by furniture. She took the chalk out and felt that stupid sense you get when you know you are playing by somebody else\u2019s rules and you hate them and you want to see them anyway. She drew a line where the scratches had suggested. She stood on it. The way sound traveled through the room changed. The air had a weakness there, a patch. She knelt and pressed her cheek to the wood the way a child will when listening for trains. Under the floor, the soft sound of paper was not a metaphor. She went to get a crowbar because some wrongs deserve violence. She told herself there would be a note and that she should not read it if it existed. She told herself she would.\n\nIt took two men and a whisper to get the board up because you don\u2019t hurt a church without apologizing to someone, even if that someone is you. Under the board there was a small wrapped package, no bigger than a hand. Ms. Liu would have had a word about the choice of paper and about the way the tape had been folded. Poin held it like an egg and opened it like a bomb. Inside were pages torn from a spiral notebook, blue lines tight as ribs. On the top page, in a handwriting that leaned left and then corrected itself without self-hate, a list of names lived. The first three were the boys they had already found. The fourth was a man whose name she did not know yet and would learn in thirty minutes when the call came from Fernley Street about a young man who had been expected home and was not. The fifth was not a boy at all. It was a woman\u2019s name. It was hers. She felt her face do the thing an animal\u2019s does when it stands too close to a fence built by a person who likes animals in theory. She turned the next page and saw the ledger drawn in pencil with the sweetness of a child\u2019s fantasies: date, time, balance. In the corner, a word written and erased and written again as if someone had stood here asking themselves permission. The word was attention.\n\nHer phone rang with someone else\u2019s panic and then with her own, a second later. She put the chalk in her pocket because if you don\u2019t collect the pieces it looks like you meant to drop them. She said to the room like a person who has decided to stop asking for consent, \u201cEnough,\u201d and the room did not answer because rooms don\u2019t owe you anything. She went to get her coat that the stranger had worn and hung up exactly the way she would have hung it and she put it on and she went to work to be boring and true, and the city, because it could not help itself, rearranged its shadows to suit.The call from Fernley Street arrived while the chalk dust still pressed its pale thumb into the seam of her pocket and the ledger pages she had lifted from under the church floorboards lay facedown in an evidence sleeve she\u2019d sealed with her own shaking hands. Caswell\u2019s voice was thin with the effort of making itself smaller for a grieving house. A young man, last seen near the bus stop by the laundromat, shoes left by the mat as if he planned to put them on again in an hour, phone unanswered since dusk. His mother said his name three different ways as if one of them might draw him back. Poin told Internal Affairs about the find at Ryal because that was the line she would not cross; she gave Lott the pages under a camera and said the word church without apology, and she did not explain why she had chalk on her sleeve because sometimes explaining is just a way to invite someone else\u2019s version of you to take root. She texted Caswell that she was on her way and then texted Noah with a single word, ledger, because everything had begun to feel like a dare and she trusted him not to waste the fat under the dare with the wrong kind of excitement.\n\nFernley Street had that Roseville posture she knew by heart, two-story rows with porches that had looked at better winters without flinching, Christmas lights left up in January because you have to let the glow be stubborn a little longer when your hands are tired. The missing boy\u2019s mother had scrubbed her kitchen into a church, lemon and hot water, a scent so clean it almost made Poin suspicious of what else had lived there all day. The boy\u2019s name was Ezra Morales and on the fridge was a scholarship letter with a magnet that said YOU GOT THIS with the kind of optimism Poin had not owned at eighteen and tried not to resent in others now. Ezra\u2019s sister sat on the stairs with her face in a book she wasn\u2019t reading. There was a cat who pretended not to care and cared like a barn on fire. Caswell stood by the sink and made himself small, the trick he did when the room needed to believe the police were a pair of hands and not a fist. Poin bent to the calendar because calendars tell truths houses forget they told, and saw his work schedule with shifts at a smoothie place that paid in smoothies and disappointment, and a practice note for Kunstler Hall scrawled two days back with a smiley face after it because there are still places in the world where practice makes anyone smile.\n\n\u201cHe left for the bus,\u201d Ezra\u2019s mother said, gripping the back of a chair the way a person grips the edges of a dream to keep from sliding out. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t cut. He doesn\u2019t avoid. He doesn\u2019t have time to be bad. He\u2019s a good boy, Detective. He helps his aunt with her stairs because her knees won\u2019t listen. He called me from the river once to say the ice sounded like whales and I told him, mijo, don\u2019t be silly, and I wish I had said, yes, whales, and listened longer.\u201d\n\nPoin asked the small questions because the small questions are the only ones that let the big ones breathe. Which coat. Which shoes. Which friend. Which bus. She watched the mother\u2019s hands, the way the fingers paused when they touched the chair where the varnish had worn down to memory, and she watched the sister\u2019s eyes in the guard of her bangs and saw something like anger that had been taught to behave. Caswell took notes low, not because he needed them low but because it made his pen seem less like a needle and more like a bandage. The phone on the counter lit green and dark, green and dark, with messages from classmates stacking into a building of worry. Poin felt the ledger pages against her ribs like a nervous heartbeat and wished they were not touching her at all.\n\nNoah sent a ping at the same hour the mother said the word scarf as if she had never cared about a scarf in her life until now. The blog had moved again; the backend showed a draft saved and overwritten from a device that had danced the same idiot dance through the guest network as before. He had a timestamp and a block of footage to check. He wrote, The draft says balance tonight and the word reconcile, which is a nothing word and a everything word. He added, You should eat the rest of those peanuts or I will invent an allergy for you and make you carry an EpiPen just to give your day a new anxiety. She smiled at the kitchen tile like a person who has been told a joke during a wake and needs to put it somewhere safe.\n\nEzra\u2019s girlfriend arrived half-breathless with a coat tied around her waist and a face that looked like she had been trying not to cry in public and had failed. She said he had been practicing something hard and that he had put his phone away on purpose because he had a rule about paying attention with his whole body. She said a woman had asked him once, in the lobby of Kunstler, if he thought order was a made thing or a found thing, and he had said made, because he had learned that the only beautiful things he had in his hands were the ones he put there. She said the woman\u2019s voice had sounded like a textbook read in a warm room. Poin asked without looking at Caswell whether anyone had reported a stranger in the building in a gray coat and a blue scarf; Caswell looked back without looking like he was looking and lifted his chin a millimeter. Armitage had called to say the scarf woman had returned twice this week and stood by the bulletin board as if waiting for a clock to tell her when she was real.\n\nThe bus stop camera gave them a slosh of strangers and the small confessions of winter: hands inside sleeves, shoulders wearing their most stubborn angles. Ezra got on a bus he always got on and got off two stops later where a shortcut cut behind the old bakery and spat you out by the river if you weren\u2019t careful. He walked with the slightly theatrical gait of a person with earbuds in, except he did not have earbuds. He turned his head once like he\u2019d heard his name even though nobody near him had a mouth open. Behind him, a tan coat drifted into frame, and then the camera did its blameless blink because a snowflake hit the lens and the world became a beautiful circle and then a normal rectangle again and the tan coat had learned a lesson about physics and vanished to the left.\n\nPoin went looking because attention is a muscle and hers needed to be used while it still believed in her. She took Caswell and two uniforms and Noah because Noah didn\u2019t know how to make himself stay, and she told herself that bringing them was both protection for them and for her, which was a lie with a grain of salt in it to make it more human. Kunstler Hall\u2019s evening staff had the wary gait of people who have become unwilling curators of a museum the city has decided is haunted. Armitage handed over the sign-in logs with the pleasure of a woman whose system had been proven worth its ink. Room 213 was booked to a J. REY at noon and an E. MORALES at six, and there was a blank where six had been signed out, a small absent square that made Poin think of teeth in an old man\u2019s smile. The custodian with the splinter scar said, \u201cThe third-floor bathrooms have soap again,\u201d in a tone that made the room want to applaud. Poin put her ear to the door of 213 without touching it and heard the old triangle of a metronome because rhythm will insist on itself in all the worst moments. The sound ticked like someone making a joke in a language you resent knowing.\n\nShe used her body like a lens. The door had fresh paint around the knob that did not match the rest\u2014a lazy patch that meant someone had filled a hole with putty and pretended the world wouldn\u2019t notice. There was a smudge at knee height that could have been a shoe or a life. The air under the threshold had a cold seam like a room had been breathing that didn\u2019t expect to be caught at it. She put her palm flat on the wood and felt a slickness that was not her own sweat. \u201cTrap,\u201d she said, and Noah, to his credit, did not push forward to see the trap, he only tipped his chin and asked, \u201cWhere,\u201d like he was ordering lunch. She crouched, looked again at the patch. The hinges sang a tired song, the kind hinges sing when they have been asked to be subtle for once and hate it. She nodded at the uniforms to back off a hair; Caswell did his saint-or-fool look again and stayed where he could be both a wall and a floor mat, whatever the room required. She touched the knob with a glove and turned without pushing. The latch gave with the softness of a person telling you a secret they don\u2019t intend to keep. She set the plastic sword\u2019s green worse-than-light on the floor because a different light changes how traps decide to behave. The green spilled under the door\u2019s belly and painted the room a sick hue that made even the dust consider its options.\n\nShe didn\u2019t open. She put her shoulder to the jamb at the hinge side and inhaled. A rope doesn\u2019t have to be visible to be true; it has to be felt in the way a door resists and yields. She pushed a fraction harder than was polite. The door pulled back as if it had a thought about pulling forward. Somewhere at the top edge a line tightened and hummed. Somewhere in the room a chair scraped, the soft wood scream of a furniture leg dragged by a purpose. She looked up and traced where a rope would live if she were the person who wanted the drama without the mess, a loop over the top corner to a hook that probably used to hold a plant when the room was briefly a lounge in 1983. The rope would have gone to the chair. The chair would have gone to a body. She could see the shadow of it in the green. She took the narrow pry bar Noah had brought with the duct kit because he knows how to love her in ways he will never understand and she slid it under the base and lifted a whisper. The rope tensed like a held breath. She hit the jamb with her palm twice and let the door swing, and the rope took all the stupid theater\u2019s weight in one dramatic cough and snapped its knot where she had hoped it would, where the plant hook had rusted on the inside of its threads. The chair moved and did not fall. The metronome fell and did not break because some things refuse to perform for you in the ways you think you deserve.\n\nEzra Morales was in the chair with the rope looped around his neck not tight enough to injure and so tight it made a liar out of every parent who says the world will be kind to you if you are kind to it. His hands were bound in front the way one binds a person you intend to untie yourself while saying something poetic about mercy. His eyes were open and they did the thing that eyes do when they have seen the ocean come up over them and then go back. Poin put her palm on his cheek because touch is a technology the city cannot regulate, and she said his name like she was taking his attendance and he was not late. Caswell did a careful ugly dance with the rope at the back, undoing a knot that had been tied with a good scout\u2019s pride, and Noah took the metronome and clicked it off and then looked at his own hand like he had struck a beloved animal and now had to deal with the feeling. The rope had left a pink half-moon under Ezra\u2019s jaw; Poin had to do the work not to see it on every boy she had ever watched walk by the river like they owned it because living requires that you let people own their walking.\n\n\u201cThere was a woman,\u201d Ezra said, and everybody\u2019s lungs exhaled a theatrical amount of relief they would deny later. He said the word woman with the broadness of someone who has not been given vocabulary to discuss the space between costume and person. \u201cShe said she needed me to sit because she wanted to show me something and she said it was a trick, not a hurt. She smelled like peppermint and something like old paper. She called me by my first and last name. She was not angry. She was so not angry she made me angry.\u201d\n\n\u201cFace,\u201d Caswell said, gentle like a man talking to a witness and a person in pain at once, and Ezra made an apologetic gesture with his bound hands the way people do when their brain is trying to be good at its own story. Scarf, blue. Coat, gray. Hands, gloved. Voice like something recited and loved. Eyes? He said he couldn\u2019t say because he hadn\u2019t wanted to look long; the human animal knows when an animal wants to be watched. She had said, \u201cNot yet,\u201d when he asked her what the point was, and then she had tied him with a competence that was nurse or sailor or mother. She had stepped back and looked at him the way a person looks at a painting they\u2019ve decided to hang. Then she had left, and the metronome had ticked like a scolding grandmother until Noah clicked it quiet. Ezra began to cry only when Poin asked him the smallest question, whether he had had dinner, and he said \u201cno\u201d the way people say \u201cforgive me.\u201d\n\nThey got him to the EMTs and kept the ledger pages off the kitchen tables and the television cameras. Lott showed up at Kunstler because he lives in his car when the city does not behave, and his jaw did that unfortunate thing again when he saw the rope mark and the hook and the way the room had been dressed for a play it did not consent to perform. \u201cGrandstanding,\u201d he said in a voice that wanted to be tired and decided to be grim instead. \u201cShe wants the room to remember her like an alumni donor.\u201d He looked at Poin as if he wanted to ask her if she felt personally moved by the theater and then had the good sense to decide that was a question he didn\u2019t deserve to ask.\n\nNoah brought her the toy sword as if he were handing a surgeon her lucky ring. \u201cYour text,\u201d he said, tapping her phone\u2019s dark screen where there was nothing and everything, \u201cabout balance? She had a draft open again. She typed reconcile and then deleted it. She wrote ledger three times and erased two. She wrote \u2018not a ghost\u2019 and kept it. She is writing in the city\u2019s voice and it is making her drunk. Also, please note that the peppermint smell could be Ms. Armitage or every grandmother we\u2019ve ever loved.\u201d\n\nArmitage stood in the hall with her lanyard like a medal and her hair like a promise and said, \u201cIt\u2019s not me,\u201d in a tone so articulate with professional insult and love for her building that it could have been framed. She told Poin that the word reconcile has lived in her office longer than most freshmen and it did no harm there. She asked Ezra quietly, privately, if he wanted a candy and waited for him to decide. Poin watched the boy take a peppermint and place it under his tongue like a sacrament and she had to walk into the stairwell and let herself choose not to cry.\n\nThe blog did not post for an hour, and then it did, and the city inhaled like a crowd at a magic show the second before the trap door opens and the dove is either alive or not. It read:\n\nYou do not understand what mercy is. Mercy is not the absence of action; it is the precise application of the minimum required to teach the lesson. He will remember the rope like a signature and that is enough. The net result is improved. I am not hiding. I am inside the places you say are yours. I am copying from your books. Some of you will learn. The rest of you will be reconciled by other means.\n\nPoin read it twice without leaning on any words and then a third time tracing only the verbs as if they were tracks through light snow. Teach, remember, improve, hiding, copying, learn, reconciled. She could hear Stills in the next room trying to say something about pathology without sounding like he had learned it from television. Lott\u2019s radio burped the names of three city council members who had decided to make mercy a political football before dawn. Caswell said, \u201cShe\u2019s going to escalate,\u201d in the tone of a man saying the stove is hot while watching someone else put their hand on it anyway.\n\nNoah put the pencil photographs in front of her like flowers a child brings that he knows are weeds but loves anyway. He had his bite overlay, his little armory of comparisons, his hypothesis that the teeth belonged to a jaw that had been set tightly by someone who learned to wear their anger like a retainer. He said the marks were small and deep; he said the pattern suggested a person who smiled without showing upper incisors, which is a silly thing to claim, which made it feel truer. He said they could narrow it and then he shrugged the shrug of a priest who knows the gods have their own appointments. He added, as if he were embarrassed by his own competence, that the guest network at the building had recorded another ghost, a device that had appeared long enough to be counted and then gone, a pattern that was becoming the shape of their week.\n\nPoin went home because she had promised Lott she would let someone walk her places that were not murder rooms and also because her body needed to be held up by walls it knew. Mrs. Liu met her in the hallway with a dish towel in one hand and a disdain for the entire concept of killers in the other. \u201cYou look like a rug,\u201d Mrs. Liu said, which somehow meant that Poin was invited to sit and be scolded with soup. The apartment had been cleaned by nobody but her own tired hands; the bowl was in the sink where it belonged; the chair had its scrape like a signature; the toy sword lay on the table where she had left it as a dare to herself. On the counter, where the note had been the night before, was only a square of clean where paper had rested long enough to keep dust away. She put the ledger copy on the table and read her own name again, written in a hand that belonged to either someone she did not know or someone she knew too well. She wrote \u201cNo\u201d next to it because you are allowed small rituals of defiance in the privacy of your own kitchen, and then she wrote \u201cAttention\u201d under it because she needed to see the word she had built her life on, an anchor that would hold her against the current of somebody else\u2019s story.\n\nSleep came in slices and not the good kind. In the piece where she stood at the bridge the tan coat man put his hands in the air and they turned into gulls; in the piece where she sat in church the floor whispered a different word than attention and she woke before she could hear it. She dreamed she had two mouths and one of them kept eating the other\u2019s words. At three in the morning she woke with the idiot certainty that she had left the door undone and got up to check the deadbolt, which was unhelpfully, perfectly locked. She found a hat she did not own on the hook with her scarf again and told the hat, out loud, that she would discuss it later. When she slept the last time before the alarm, the river did not come; there was only a dry creek bed with coins in it and a sign that said LEDGER in black marker leaning against a rock. She woke laughing once, a bark that hurt her throat, and decided to be grateful that her body remembered how to make any joy at all.\n\nThe morning punched her with headlines. The Chronicle had placed a quote of hers next to a silhouette of a woman holding a ledger like a prayer book; a blogger had made a collage of her plastic sword and three separate murder instruments and called it a comment on American policing; a city radio host had decided the week\u2019s theme was mercy and punishment and had called in a theologian who said you cannot make mercy into arithmetic without murdering the word. She let the words pass by like trains she was not obligated to board. Noah had left her a voicemail because he, too, occasionally believed in old technologies. He said, \u201cThe bite marks aren\u2019t Armitage\u2019s and they aren\u2019t yours and they aren\u2019t mine even though I was prepared to be accused, and when I tried to match them to our library ghost man we did not get a match because that is not how matching works, but also because we do not have his teeth. I found a partial on a coffee cup abandoned in the duct that I will now go to hell for picking up with my hands, and it is different in exactly the way that makes stories live too long. Be careful. I do not like how close the vents are to anything you would call a person.\u201d He paused, as if his own mouth had to make a decision before it said the next thing, and then added, \u201cI had a dream you taught me scales until my hands stopped shaking. I don\u2019t even play anything. Interpret that however creates the fewest problems.\u201d\n\nShe went to Internal Affairs because she had promised to be boring and true, and she told Lott about the ledger in the church and everything except the way the word attention had made her feel like a person given their own name for the first time after a long sentence. Stills tried to be outraged about the floorboard until Lott gave him a look that suggested perhaps his priorities could be rearranged. Lott said, \u201cShe put your name under glass,\u201d which was not a thing Poin needed put into words by anyone but her and yet here it was, a phrase taking up chair space in the conference room. He offered her, of all things, a peppermint, and she took it because refusing a peppermint in front of a person who believes in the law of small helps felt like a sin she couldn\u2019t afford. He told her she would not be walking around alone and looked like he wanted her to argue so he could feel useful when she inevitably lost. She did not give him the argument. She asked for the list of graveyards nobody had touched in a decade and he laughed without humor and gave it to her because the strangest requests are often the least dangerous.\n\nThe river made its own weather that afternoon and buried three sirens at once without effort. Ezra\u2019s girlfriend texted to say he had eaten and slept and then cried again because relief is rude to the body. Armitage sent a photograph of the plant hook dated by some office camera that ran when the building was otherwise unobserved, the hook old and untouched last month and polished by a hand this week. Halladay from the library forwarded an email from a patron complaining about squeaky pencils, CC-ing Poin with a wink. Mrs. Liu knocked once on Poin\u2019s door with a walking stick and told her that people who hang their coats the way Poin hangs her coats cannot be trusted to kill anyone good, which was an imperfect comfort and thus perfect.\n\nAt dusk, the blog turned sly again, shorter this time, the sentences clipped the way someone clipper-cuts their hair to feel in control. It read:\n\nLedger entry: one boy corrected without loss. Ledger entry: one metronome returned. Ledger entry: one detective slowed down by courtesy. Balance: still too far in the red. If you want to find me, you will have to admit how many of your walls have doors you do not lock.\n\nNoah wrote, Doors, and sent a flood of lock images until her phone gave up trying to display them at once. Caswell called just to breathe in her ear like a brother and say, \u201cYou\u2019re not allowed to be a line item,\u201d and hang up because sometimes friendship is as stupid as rope and twice as useful. Poin went to the bridge not because she thought the river would finally tell her a story that made sense but because there are only so many rooms a body can do its waiting in before the walls start to insist you are the wrong shape.\n\nThe tan coat man was there again like a bad decision that insists on being charming. He stood with his hands on the rail in the approved position of men who want to look like they have nothing to hide and maybe even believe it. His mouth shaped her name as if he were tasting weather. He said, \u201cDo you like how she lets boys go?\u201d in a voice that could have sold towels. She said, \u201cI like boys living,\u201d and watched the small flicker he didn\u2019t intend to show, that almost-grief that lives under contempt in certain men. He said, \u201cYou found the church,\u201d and she said, \u201cYou were there,\u201d because they had both given up pretending to be spectral. He did that neck-stretch again and the white line made itself known in the last of the light, and for one reckless second she imagined laying her index finger along that seam and feeling whether the skin remembered hurt or only the shape of a lesson. She put her hand on the rail instead. He said, \u201cIt\u2019s almost the end of the first act,\u201d like a person who had paid too much attention to a lecture once and never got over it. She let him walk away because whatever she could do to him on a bridge in the twilight would be more about her than him, and she had decided the ledger needed different math.\n\nThat night she laid out her notebooks on the floor like lures. She wrote three lines on each, alternating her hands without hiding it from herself, a practice instead of a feint. She wrote the word attention until it felt like it could be said in a courtroom without becoming a farce. She set the toy sword on the windowsill for the childish bravery of it and because the green made the glass look like the river had come up to watch her sleep. She put the pencil with the small angry teeth marks in the center of the circle like a totem. She told the ceiling the plan she did not yet have because some things need to be said out loud before they will let themselves exist. When the trains rolled past like whales remembering salt, she curled around the smallest part of her and tried not to let her own name feel like a threat. She woke with the answer plastered against her teeth like a word she\u2019d been trying not to say. She would stop trying to catch a ghost in her own walls. She would set a table in the one room she knew the ghost loved, and she would invite her with the only invitation that made sense to a person who lived on order and staging: an appointment, written in a hand both familiar and unbearable, at a place that had learned to love metronomes and rules. She would take the thing that wanted attention and give it an audience she could control. She would bring the sword only if she was feeling unkind, and she would not be unkind. She would be boring. She would be true. And if a door she did not lock opened, she would be standing in its frame with both hands visible and all her names in her mouth.She did not write the appointment down where anyone official would see it. She wrote it on a small grid card with a pencil that didn\u2019t squeak, and she leaned left on purpose so the slant would be a confession only to those who knew her well enough to misunderstand. She left that card under the floorboard at Ryal where the chalk had told her to stand, a square of paper slid into a seam of wood the way a letter slides into a life. She didn\u2019t address it, because some messages already know their recipient. She wrote the room number and the hour and a word that had grown dangerous in her mouth: attention.\n\nArmitage, when Poin asked, did not ask why. She pulled ledger after ledger from behind the desk with the efficiency of a woman who understood that writing down names in the right place kept the world stitched. She booked 213 under a staff maintenance hold, which was the kind of lie the building would forgive. She walked Poin through the paneled belly of Kunstler like a docent guiding someone to a reliquary and then stopped in front of a closet that owed the city stories. \u201cWe can kill the hallway camera for fifteen minutes and call it a reboot,\u201d Armitage said without blinking. \u201cThe door to 213 sticks. If this goes wrong, no, it\u2019s already wrong, but if it goes loud, you bang here and the hinge will lie for you.\u201d\n\nNoah set his saints in a ring. He hated calling them that and loved it anyway. He brought three analog tape recorders that had cost twelve dollars each from a thrift shop run by Episcopal women who labeled every plug with masking tape and a date. He ran fresh cassettes and wound them with a pencil he refused to chew. He set a small film camera on a shelf because glass in light sees different lies than sensors. He checked the outlet for a kiss of current and then shook his head as he mated the recorder with a battery anyway, because he had learned the shape of the ghost\u2019s hand inside their walls. \u201cNo feeds,\u201d he said. \u201cNo network. If I see you try to text me, I throw your phone in the river and write an apology to your future biographer.\u201d\n\nCaswell did the job of worrying in a circle while pretending to straighten a poster about a winter choral concert. He tried to make her promise to keep the door open, and she said she would, and he looked at her like he loved her enough not to believe her. \u201cYou\u2019re not bait,\u201d he said, and she made the face she made when someone misnamed her. He looked at his boots, which had known bleachers and three wakes, and added, \u201cDon\u2019t make me tell your neighbor on you. She scares me.\u201d\n\nThey placed the toy sword on the piano\u2019s closed lid like a childish relic, not hidden and not entirely center, an object that someone who knew her would know she had placed there to say a thing words would make ugly. In that green the metronome\u2019s wood looked sick and somehow forgiven. Noah laughed under his breath once at the staging, and she elbowed him, and he took the blow like a benediction. He had slipped a small dictaphone under the bench with its little red eye held shut by tape, an old trick he\u2019d learned somewhere he liked to pretend he hadn\u2019t. He put the glove they found in the duct inside a clear box on the bookcase like a diorama in a child\u2019s museum. \u201cShe won\u2019t be able to keep her hands off her own outline,\u201d he said. \u201cAsk any stagehand what draws them.\u201d\n\nThe text from the unknown number did not come, and she hadn\u2019t decided what she\u2019d have done if it had. She didn\u2019t send one. She turned her phone off and put it in her bag and slipped the bag into Armitage\u2019s desk drawer under the peppermint bowl with the other polite contraband. The lobby sighed; the gutter outside found a rhythm; the train went from complaint to lullaby and back again in the space of a verse. Armitage said she would walk by on a loop that sounded natural, which was a lie equal to mercy. Noah stationed himself in the stairwell where the dead plant kept its faith and gave her a look like a boy whose mother had handed him a torch in a cave and said, \u201cStay.\u201d Caswell positioned a uniform down the hall and one at the back exit and a plainclothes by the elevator who looked like a faculty member if you didn\u2019t care about faculty.\n\nPoin went into the room alone because that was the point and not the point. She closed the door until it caught but left the latch floating, and she tested the hinge the way Armitage had showed her, the hinge giving its small betrayed whine. She sat on the piano bench with her knees where the varnish had been rubbed pale by a hundred other knees and let the metronome claim the air with a tick that had made a sermon out of patience for a century. She did not turn it on. She listened to its silence and how it still somehow made a cage of time in the room. She put her hands flat where a student would put them and did not move them because muscles have their own habits of invention. She waited.\n\nWaiting was a room she had built long ago. She had furnished it poorly at thirteen and then better at nineteen and then made it almost comfortable at thirty. She could wait now without popping and without biting and without running the alphabet in order. She thought about how many doors in her life had not had locks not because she had neglected them but because the architect hadn\u2019t believed in the existence of nights. She thought about the blue cap of the pen in her coat pocket and how her thumb had worn a crescent into the rubber without her permission. She thought about the voice that had said you\u2019re late and she thought about being early and how early was a lie you told yourself before you learned to keep your own time.\n\nShe heard the hallway before she heard the hand on the room. Her body knew the small stitches in air when another human brings their weather through a narrow space. The hinge gave its hint and then its confession. The door opened without a show and then it did not open more, as if the person on the other side respected the physics of polite entries more than most. A figure slid into the shape of the doorway the way a letter slides into a slot. Gray coat, not making a fuss. Blue scarf, the blue you picked if you had once learned the names of the colors and kept them as pets. Gloves, thin enough to feel piano keys through. The face had a shape and then it changed and then it went back to its original shape because the light chose a different story each second and the scarf ate the lower portion as it had on camera. The shoulders were smaller than the tan coat\u2019s and the posture was less charming. The person closed the door the way you close a book you intend to reopen.\n\n\u201cDetective,\u201d said the person, and the voice had that warm textbook quality that had stuck in Ezra\u2019s throat. It sat in the air and tried to behave. It wasn\u2019t disguised. It was controlled. She could hear, behind the control, the hum of a person who rehearsed sentences in empty rooms to see how they landed. The person\u2019s eyes were careful in the way of people who had been taught young that faces were weapons.\n\nPoin did not stand because standing would have made the space lie. She kept her hands visible. She said, \u201cYou asked for attention. I\u2019m excellent at it,\u201d and watched the small change at the corner of the person\u2019s eye that meant flattery had been recognized and assigned and refused.\n\n\u201cI asked for order,\u201d the person said. \u201cAttention is what you slap on things when you need to feel like a soldier. I prefer a desk and a pen and the time to avoid mistakes.\u201d\n\nA small, stupid part of Poin\u2019s body wanted to reach and adjust the ticking block to the notch marked 60. She didn\u2019t. The person\u2019s gaze went to the metronome anyway, that magnetic trick objects possess when they have been part of a rehearsal longer than anyone will admit. The glance slid to the toy sword and paused there just long enough to make the room know it had been seen. The person didn\u2019t smile. That would have broken the stage.\n\n\u201cYou took rope into my city and put it on boys,\u201d Poin said. \u201cYou laid our rooms out like exhibits. You used our walls. Did the ledger feel grand in your hand.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt felt correct,\u201d the person said. \u201cGrand is what the Chronicle calls your face. You don\u2019t believe in grand. I like that about you.\u201d\n\nNoah\u2019s recorder made no sound because that was its discipline. Outside in the hall a foot scraped and then Armitage coughed with the theatricality of someone performing the part of a person who was not listening. The person in the scarf did not look at the door, and Poin liked that, too, because it meant the person had rehearsed this moment enough to know where not to spend their eyes.\n\n\u201cYou wrote from our lobby,\u201d Poin said, because an accusation\u2019s power lives in the place it admits its own uncertainty. \u201cYou wrote from under our cameras. Guests in our house.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe all borrow roofs,\u201d the person said. \u201cYou tell yourself your house is a thing you chose. You live with a woman who knows where you put your bowl and you let her correct you. The rope was borrowed, too. Did that make it wrong. Did borrowing it make it worse than owning it. You will ask me about killing. You will ask me about my boys. You will try to make me a category so you can file me and sleep.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou put my name on your list,\u201d Poin said. She said it without moving anything in her face she didn\u2019t need to move. \u201cTell me what that category is.\u201d\n\nFor a half second the careful face slipped and the blinding ordinary self underneath it looked out. It was not a monster. It was a person who had sat in waiting rooms and stood in liquor aisles and watched neighbors on stoops and read signs about the schedule of trash days and noticed which corners of a room collected dust when everyone forgot to care. The person made a small hand movement that would have been a shrug if it had been given permission. \u201cYou are a ledger,\u201d the person said. \u201cYou are the only other ledger I\u2019ve seen in this place that isn\u2019t a joke. I wondered whether two books could sit on the same desk. Names can be offerings. Names can be threats. You know that better than the men who give you them.\u201d\n\n\u201cWere you going to kill me with rope,\u201d Poin said, and she didn\u2019t know whether she wanted yes or no. \u201cWere you going to teach me in my own room.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a room,\u201d the person said, and then laughed\u2014a small, surprised ruin of a sound that made the smile lines around their eyes validate themselves as human. \u201cThat is not true. I have rooms. They just don\u2019t have my name on their mailboxes. I would not kill you with rope. Rope is for boys who can still learn. You and I are too late for rope.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen what is for us,\u201d Poin said.\n\n\u201cPaper,\u201d the person said. \u201cA trial. A book. A column inches wide and television long. A podium. A note under a floor so good church ladies will have to forgive me because the boards will tell them what I did.\u201d\n\nThe scarf smelled like peppermint and printer ink. It wasn\u2019t a scent you wore to seduce. It was a scent you wore to obscure. The person walked a foot into the room and let the door fall shut very softly as if air were a thing you could lay down. The glove reached to the toy sword and touched its cheap hilt with a finger the way a person taps a child\u2019s forehead. The toy whined a little at the contact and the person\u2019s eyes shifted, finally, to Poin\u2019s. \u201cYou kept it,\u201d the person said, not quite a question.\n\n\u201cYou know about it,\u201d Poin said, and the person\u2019s mouth did that childless almost-smile again at the fact that she answered questions with their own questions. The glove slid over the plastic and Poin watched the latex pull a small green streak into dullness. A tiny bit of roughness at the glove\u2019s fingertip whispered over the toy\u2019s seam, a burr on a nail, a nick in a ring. A detail added itself to a drawer in Poin\u2019s head where it would live until she needed it more than she wanted to forget it.\n\n\u201cYou could have kept killing,\u201d Poin said, and tested the way the room held the word. \u201cYou did not. You chose theater. Why.\u201d\n\n\u201cWires,\u201d the person said. \u201cI disagree with yours. I have been trying on my version and wanted you to see it. It matters to me that you see it. It does not matter to me that you approve.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou learned in our house,\u201d Poin said, and now she let a little anger spend itself in her mouth because the body demands to be given coins or it makes its own. \u201cYou learned our schedule and our holes and our terrible passwords. You chewed our pencils and you wrote inside our walls. You think that makes you immune to us. It just makes you a part we have to stop. City is not your room to arrange.\u201d\n\n\u201cCity is everybody\u2019s room to arrange,\u201d the person said. \u201cYou arrange it. You do it with posture. With whether you let the men in strings of suits use your name like a charm. With whether you talk on camera. With whether you forgive the boys who steal five dollars from the register or whether you arrest them so some statistic will have a number that looks more like success than like love.\u201d The voice stayed warm, but there was a new crispness at the edge, like a page dog-eared hard enough to become a knife. \u201cI\u2019m bored,\u201d the person added, and the way they said it sounded like the truest thing anyone had let the air carry all week.\n\n\u201cThen leave,\u201d Poin said, and knew that wasn\u2019t the sentence that would save anybody in the room. \u201cLeave the city. Leave the boys. Leave the rope. If you\u2019re bored, find something else to make into a mirror.\u201d\n\nThe person tilted their head the way a dancer marks a beat in their body so a thing will happen on time. \u201cYou\u2019re tired,\u201d they said, and the sentence felt like a hand on her jaw checking whether she clenched in her sleep. \u201cYour neighbor worries over your bowls. Your doctor taught you vocabulary. Your department uses you and puts your name on a sandwich board. Your boy Caswell loves you and will break in half if something happens to you because his heart was not built for theater. You have a small green joke you keep around as if it can be a hinge for the day. Your g hooks when you stop pretending to be ergonomic. You picked this room because sound behaves, and because you once lay down on the lobby floor and saw the ribs and thought about boats. You and I have the same affliction: we think rooms are maps. If you catch me, it will be in a room you mapped first.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I catch you,\u201d Poin said, and she didn\u2019t try to sand the word. \u201cThere will be no rope. There will be mercy and a mouth that says what you did into a microphone so the city can decide if it wants to be better than you think it is.\u201d\n\nThe person flicked the sword off with a gesture that would have looked rude if it had been done to a candle and was only funny because it was done to a toy. They put their hand flat on the metronome, not moving it, just laying skin on wood, and Poin saw the glove\u2019s cuff ride up half an inch and reveal wrist. The wrist had a scar, but not the rope\u2019s pale half moon; this one was a straight line from the base of the palm down two inches, neat and old, the kind you get when a piece of glass refuses to be furniture. On the index finger a ring sat that was less jewelry than hardware, stainless something with a nick so small you wouldn\u2019t notice it until you tried to turn a cheap green toy on in the dark. Her head did its work and then her body held still like a predator that doesn\u2019t want the grass to know.\n\n\u201cBalance,\u201d the person said. \u201cYou like the word better than I do. Keep it. We\u2019ll share custody.\u201d They looked at her for a long beat, the kind that metronomes can count, and then they moved backwards with more promise than threat. The door moved without Clemson or any god to bless it and opened into Armitage\u2019s cough again. The scarf moved; the gray coat made its own shadow; and then the hall took both back as if swallowing a coin.\n\nPoin stood because she was allowed to again. She waited three more ticks she hadn\u2019t turned on and then four because when your brain wants three, four is safer. She opened the door so hard the hinge made an apology it didn\u2019t believe, and the hallway gave her Armitage\u2019s calm hair and Noah\u2019s too-wide eyes and the uniform at the bend of the corridor with his hand on a nothing he couldn\u2019t use. The stairwell door swung once, twice, like a thing that had just been used for something it didn\u2019t approve. She ran.\n\nHer body remembered ladders faster than it remembered lovers. She took the first flight and the second like a problem with its own solution. The landing held the smell of a heated coil somewhere being asked to pretend it was a fire. The door to the roof had been unlocked because Armitage had let a maintenance man fix a vent last week and had not had time to fix his fixing. Poin hit the door with her shoulder and let the night\u2019s cold tell her she was still under a sky. The roof had gravel and lint and a little crown of pigeon crime. To her right a figure moved, gray turned smoke, scarf turned night sea. Noah\u2019s voice shouted \u201cleft\u201d in her ear as if direction could be granted like a gift, and she obeyed without seeing the left yet, a new trick she would thank him for later and scold him for sooner.\n\nThe person did not run like a runner. They ran like someone using a run as a way to move between two poses. They crossed the gravel with their hands out a fraction from their sides as if balancing on a board and not a city. They reached the parapet and turned without putting their weight in their heels and dropped over with a small professional care that suggested a ladder on the far side, not air. Poin reached the wall and leaned and saw the ladder, old, wooden, memorial to a law that had been revised three times and never enforced. It slid down to a brick outcrop that would get you to the old gutter\u2019s spine, get you three feet over to a window older than her career with a sash that had always been half in love with open. The person below had made this trip enough times to love it. They put a gloved hand on the sash and coaxed it up like a doctor opening a child\u2019s mouth. She could have dropped after them, and she would have made the reach, and she would have split her shin and her pride on the gutter and she would have been in a room she did not control. She reached for the ladder anyway because the human machine is bad at reward at the end of long waits.\n\nNoah\u2019s hand on her belt was the only reason she didn\u2019t go. He dug his fingers into canvas like a person pulling back a dog from a fight it would win and regret. She looked at him and hated him and loved him and noted through the hateful love that his eyes had learned something in the last month that made him older than his hoodie intended. Caswell\u2019s voice rose from the stairwell naming her the same way he said his prayers, and she let the name be a leash until she could breathe without her muscles trying to spend themselves.\n\nThey lost her in the library again, which was not a surprise. The window opened into a stair that looked decorative on building maps and lived in the mouth of the duct. The wedge of camera blind spots existed not because the city had been stupid but because the city had been itself, and the person had learned it the way you learn your own floor not to creak. Halladay watched them blow through the reading room with her mouth set to librarian\u2019s medium, and she did not feign shock or perform fear because she had decided an hour ago that would be a waste of performance. She pointed to the corner the wedge loved and said, \u201cDo not step there, you will break your ankle,\u201d and they did not, and she was pleased to have saved something.\n\nWhat they had, afterward, was not satisfaction but the kind of cloth a dressmaker can turn into a garment if you give her time and someone patient to hold the pins. Noah lifted the toy sword in the glove bag and squinted into the scratch near the switch. Fibers glinted like gods at the edge of the wound, a color not unlike the scarf\u2019s when seen under worse light, a blend that cheap cloths pick when cheap manufacturers are trying to make a dye look expensive. He teased a single filament into a microscope\u2019s mouth like a man feeding a snake. He talked to it the way some men talk to cars. He said, \u201cPoly and something with a metallic twist. Do you know who buys this thread because I do.\u201d He said, \u201cThis is the kind they use for municipal uniforms when they want to pretend someone is important because their scarf has a sheen.\u201d\n\nArmitage produced a box with a municipal inspector\u2019s spare scarf because she had run a building long enough to own everyone\u2019s wardrobe in miniature. It did not match. Halladay, who seemed to enjoy the sorcery of being asked for things she could produce, brought a drawer of lost-and-found fabric and laid out four scarves like a tarot. Noah shook his head over each like he was exorcising a mood. The thread in the scratch wanted to be from a particular kind of store that made the same scarf for three years and then stopped when they learned better. Poin took the fiber\u2019s photograph on the little film camera because she liked trusting a thing she couldn\u2019t argue with through an app. She put the ring nick into her pocket without touching it because her eye had measured the metal with its habit of loving minutiae.\n\nLott remarked, when they told him, that rings were gifts and punishments both, and then ruined it by adding something about marriage that made Caswell perform a cough loud enough to qualify as a joke. Stills asked if the person was a woman and then gave a speech about the danger of calling anyone a woman when your brain only meant scarf, and Poin let him tie himself in that knot because she was too tired to untie him and too awake to leave him in it. The ADA watched the tape recorder turn and said out loud that analog made her feel like a kid again when magic tricks seemed possible, and Poin looked at her ring without meaning to. It was smooth and unhelpful, the polite gold you give yourself when you decide that visible promises have cuteness to them and not just weight.\n\nEzra\u2019s mother brought a bag of warm tamales to the station that evening like she was dropping medicine on the doorstep of an illness she could not diagnose. She hugged Poin because nobody stopped her and because Poin had been the person who put a hand on her boy\u2019s face and said his name when a rope had tried to live there. \u201cThank you,\u201d she said in a voice that had known a thousand versions of those words, and Poin had to muscle a swallow past something stupid and hard in her throat. Ezra texted a photograph of his peppermint wrapper crumpled into a shape like a flower, and a single word after it: practice. She told him to play scales until numbers made sense again and to leave his door open, and she hid that message under a different one because privacy should sometimes be a gift and not a right.\n\nAt home, the hat on the hook still did not belong to her and it was beginning to feel like a small domestic haunting she could live with. Mrs. Liu had left a note on the door in a hand that could have passed for a cardinal\u2019s: Soup in your fridge. If you do not eat, your face will become a moral lesson to strangers, and I refuse to let my hallway be used like that. She ate the soup as if compliance could be a weapon. She put the ledger copy in a folder and labeled the folder with an uglier word than ledger so she would be less tempted to look at it when she shouldn\u2019t. She placed the toy sword on the windowsill again and noticed the scratch the ring had made like a scar the room would carry now no matter how many times she moved the furniture.\n\nThe blog did not crow about the meeting. It posted something that felt like a rehearsal\u2019s notes, tight and mean and almost an apology and then not at all. It read about balance without saying balance and about rooms without saying rooms. It used the word reconcile again and then deleted it and then used it again as if admitting to a tic could become a virtue. It wrote about a ledger learning to share a desk. It wrote, in a line that made her heart stop for half a second and then go again with undue force, about the sword\u2019s ridiculous dignity. It was the smallest thing, the kind of sentence a person writes when they are tired and honest, and it placed the person in that room beyond any network stub\u2019s shadow.\n\nShe wrote three sentences in her book before she slept. They were not good and they were not false. She wrote about the ring and the nick and the way the glove had ridden up. She wrote about scars: rope\u2019s and glass\u2019s and the kind that live in the way you turn a doorknob after an evening that went wrong. She wrote one on the last line with her left hand because she wanted to see it with its hook before she decided she trusted herself, and she let it hook and she did not correct it, and she let the shame come and go like a tide. She turned off the lights and the trains did their whales and the radiator did its ship, and she dreamed about a room full of metronomes set to different beats and how, if you listened long enough, the room shook until they all found each other and settled on one tick. She woke with her jaw unclenched and the answer rephrased instead of rewritten. She would ask Halladay for the sign-out logs for every staff inspector who had visited Kunstler in the last six months and for the receipts for scarves. She would take the fiber to a woman Noah swore by who could tell you which mill had woven a thread by the way it refused to burn. She would ask Ms. Armitage for the photo of any staff rings that looked like hardware, which would be an odd request, and she would endure the look because she had earned the right to be odd. She would call the Office of Municipal Systems and ask who had done the last vent audit in the library and the city hall and the PD and she would use their names until they told her the truth or woke up in a cold sweat with the feeling that a name had been misused.\n\nShe made herself stand by the window for the time it took for the first train to cut the frost from the rails and the last overnight party to limp home. In the glass she saw herself and a second self and the hat she didn\u2019t own and the sword she hadn\u2019t deserved, and she said her own name twice and it improved the room by the smallest fraction. She breathed, four down and four up, and she turned toward the door because it was time to go make the city make a noise on purpose instead of only when someone shook it. The ledger would get a new hand. She would decide how to be boring in a way that still cut. And somewhere, under the surface, a person would put their glove back on and wonder for the first time whether what they wanted was a trial or a stage, and that wondering would be the first honest trouble they had gotten all week.Chapter 9\n\nCity Stores sat on a block that had once been proud of its bricks and now wore them like a shirt you keep because it still fits. The loading bays yawned like mouths that had learned not to complain. Inside, aisles ran like cornfields, bins labeled in handwriting that had outlasted three label makers and a vow to modernize. Poin liked it immediately. Rooms where people kept track of small, boring things aroused her affection and suspicion in equal measure, because order is honest until it isn\u2019t and the seam where it lies usually looks like a shelf.\n\nThe quartermaster was a woman who introduced herself with her last name first. O\u2019Hara had a braid like a rope she trusted and a ledger bound in red canvas that could have doubled as a weapon. \u201cScarves,\u201d she said, after Poin had asked and flashed. \u201cYou want the fancy ones or the ones they pretend are fancy. We got a winter lot in three seasons ago for the Office of Civic Interaction because someone on the council decided visibility would be warmth. They went with a poly blend with a metallic tooth in the thread because pictures like to bite light. I told them it would itch, and they told me to be nice. I was nice. It still itches.\u201d\n\nPoin asked to see the inventory like a person asking to hold a baby whose mother rarely lets anyone touch it. O\u2019Hara led her through smell of cardboard and dust that had learned the names of years. A bin marked CIVIC WINTER held scarves in plastic bags that tried to sound expensive when you shook them. She slit one open and let the fabric air itself like a truth. Under the store\u2019s light the blue read as night dragged to daylight and the metallic strand did its cheap shimmer. She turned a corner of the scarf and found a tag printed with an order number and a vendor name she did not recognize, KERRIGAN THREADWORKS LTD., with an address that had once been the river\u2019s edge and was now a block of new glass pretending to be river. O\u2019Hara watched her the way a woman watches a customer who might steal something for a good cause. \u201cNot a lot of departments signed for these,\u201d she said, tapping her ledger with a nail that had made peace with dirt. \u201cCivic Interaction, obviously. City Collections for the tour docents when they go out to explain to schoolkids that a lamppost can be a friend. Three to the ADA\u2019s outreach team because someone thought a matching scarf was what an apology looked like. Four to Code Compliance because a certain manager thinks a scarf can be a badge.\u201d\n\n\u201cNames,\u201d Poin said, and O\u2019Hara flipped pages as if she were turning a life into a song. She didn\u2019t give her the names because she wasn\u2019t a fool, but she let Poin read them without pretending she didn\u2019t. A George D. with a signature that looked like it had borrowed a suit, a Flavia R. who penciled a smiley into the tail of her F out of reflex, a D. Stills who had no business needing any scarf from any warehouse and had signed and underlined his own name like a man practicing saying it under oath. Poin smiled without teeth. O\u2019Hara raised one eyebrow and said, \u201cPeople will come for a paperclip if the paperclip makes them feel official. There are three left. The rest are out living their best lives, itching necks.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho took the last batch,\u201d Poin said, and O\u2019Hara pointed at a line with yesterday\u2019s date. The order had been small, two scarves and a lectern cover made of the same cheap sheen, signed for by C. LOTT because a captain sometimes decides a piece of cloth can make a podium behave. Poin touched the tag again and let the weave tell her its small lie. Metallic thread is obsessed with being noticed; it leaves a taste.\n\nKerrigan Threadworks, the address said, and Poin followed the address up the river\u2019s flank because it felt right to make the thread go home. The building that had lived there before had been a place where men hit things with hammers and called it love. Now glass looked at water and tried to remember how not to be smug. Kerrigan had taken three floors of the south edge. A receptionist in a black sweater and an old-fashioned pin that said WE MEND answered her badge with, \u201cWe do mostly theater now,\u201d and Poin saw the universe in the sentence and had to put her hand in her pocket to keep from laughing at the joke only she had been told. The studio beyond was all bolts and tables and a woman with a magnifier looped around her head like a crown for saints whose work required strain.\n\n\u201cThis,\u201d said the woman with the loop when Poin laid the fiber in a dish like it was a moth\u2019s wing. \u201cAh. This is ours, or if not ours then somebody who steals from us with excellent taste in theft. Municipal blend, order two winters ago, rush job, special finish because they insisted on a glitter that wouldn\u2019t leave the cameras blind. We taught them that camera blind is sometimes a mercy. It didn\u2019t take. The metallic in this strand is not even metal. It\u2019s a polyester with a delusion. You want sample reference.\u201d She laid out swatches with the affection of a mother lining up school pictures. \u201cAnd thread dye lot number, and invoice, and the name of the person who signed, which we don\u2019t normally give, but you look like the person who will come back with a warrant if we ask you to be patient.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am very patient,\u201d Poin said, and watched the looped woman\u2019s mouth twitch. \u201cThe person who signed.\u201d\n\n\u201cRuiz,\u201d said the woman. \u201cFlavia, from Civic Interaction. Sweet, furious, young enough to believe in laminators. She complained about itch on behalf of her people, which made me like her.\u201d She blew the fiber into a bag with a breath that wanted to be a science and added, \u201cWe sell to Code sometimes when they remember we exist. The rest go to theater. It\u2019s funny and not funny that the people who lie on purpose are better at telling you what their lying fabric needs.\u201d\n\nOn the way down the glass stairs, Poin saw herself reflected in the curve of the river and a shadow on the opposite pane that was not hers. The tan coat man existed as a persistence, a figure at the edge of things, speaking to no one and yet constantly speaking to the part of her brain that disliked holes. He looked at the water like a man who had told it secrets. He turned his head a fraction, not enough to acknowledge and enough to count. He had no scarf. He had the neck line, the white that had learned to be less loud. He had a ring that was not, and when he tucked his hands into his pockets she caught the flash of plain metal that might have had a nick or might have had a gleam. He drifted toward a set of doors that pretended to belong to a gym. She let him go because the ribbon in her pocket was more ready to be pulled and because chasing a man into a place where bodies sweat for vanity always made her feel like the joke was on the wrong audience.\n\nNoah met her at the curb like a messenger in a painting, hair doing its storm, a bag with the saintly recorders hanging off his arm like a set of bells. \u201cTextile saint says yes,\u201d he said, and she lifted the corner of the scarf with a fingertip to show him the tag. He made a noise reserved for children presented with their favorite machine. \u201cProcurement we can subpoena. O\u2019Hara we can bribe with respect. Kerrigan we can bribe with stories. I like this train.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like the way Stills signs for scarves,\u201d Poin said, and Noah did not dignify Stills with a sentence. He held up a clear box and inside was the plastic toy sword, the scratch near the switch magnified by his own new trick with light. Fibers lay there like tiny nestlings, one blue with its fake metal thread, a second hair-thin, clear, like plastic that had been thinned to transparency. \u201cNot glove,\u201d Noah said, before she could ask. \u201cFishing line. Or the memory of it. I don\u2019t like that it\u2019s here. It means someone spent their time in your apartment making a string show and then decided to take the string with them. Or it means you bought bad fruit. I choose the worst interpretation because my therapist says I have earned it.\u201d\n\n\u201cFishing line,\u201d she said, and thought of the package under the bridge, the proud knot, the way the bag had fogged. The city is full of windows for sale; it is also full of places where a person can buy line and pretend that it\u2019s for a fish. \u201cBrand?\u201d\n\nNoah looked at her with the love of a man given permission to nerd. \u201cIf you think I won\u2019t go to the store and buy every line labeled \u2018invisible\u2019 and give them all a microscope date, you are new to my personality. I need a day. I need a person to stand behind me telling me to eat peanuts.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll loan you Mrs. Liu,\u201d Poin said. \u201cShe\u2019ll tell you to eat soup and to move your chairs so they scrape. Works better.\u201d\n\nAt the Office of Municipal Systems, a man greeted her with an expression she had seen on the faces of conductors forced to stop midpiece. He called his office a department but it was a desk with a plant trying to find a window and a calendar that had seen oil stains and starlings. He had a box of rings sitting on the cabinet behind him like a shop. The rings were not jewelry; they were band cutters, key rings, cheap safety bands that contractors wore when they wanted to look like their metal had a job. \u201cWe do vents,\u201d he said, when she asked and flashed again. \u201cWe do them badly because everyone hates vents until vents stop working and then they love them with a passion that dies by spring. We do ladder audits every five years and then pretend we did them last year when a reporter calls. We issued safety rings to six field inspectors two winters ago because a lawyer told us if we didn\u2019t a hand would get caught and a suit would get rich.\u201d\n\nHe let her handle the rings. One had a nick where a door had introduced itself too enthusiastically, a bright bite on dull steel the size of nothing that nevertheless read like a signature once you knew what kind of paper it lived on. He watched her watch and said, as if he were the kind of man who could be led to poetry by accident, \u201cMetal remembers where it met other metal. My wife says that about faces. She does not like our dinner parties.\u201d Poin turned the ring until the nick caught the overhead light and did its tiny shine. She felt her left hand want to hook and set it on the table so her right could remember its own steadiness.\n\n\u201cNames,\u201d she said, the ritual demanded by the room, and the man gave them with the sigh of a person who had gotten over his affection for secrecy. Field inspectors, six, two on disability, one on paternity leave, one on leave-leave because the city had temporarily mislaid his file and his good temper. Corrine Lafferty, who had been first to file a form called Non-Compliance of Ladder Rails and whose ring had a scratch from a door hinge. Dorothea Ng, whose email had an out-of-office message that had been on for three weeks longer than a vacation ought to be. A list of men whose faces she knew from rooms where men apologize to a woman with a badge for the inconvenience of her gender. Her eye snagged on the scratch on the sample ring again and then slid to a photograph on the desk of five people wearing their municipal scarves like a dare at a holiday social. Blue. Cheap. Metal thread pretending to be snow. A face she recognized and had tried not to: Stills, on the edge of the picture, borrowing someone\u2019s scarf and looking like a man who had discovered the joy of uniforms. It was almost enough to make her laugh into the plant.\n\nShe asked the Municipal man for a list of buildings with vent access unusual enough to accommodate a person who had learned the city\u2019s throat. He loved that question the way old men love being asked about trains. He leaned over a map with grease at the edges and tapped at points with a pencil stub that had chew marks similar to the ones Noah had made into a science. The library, of course, part of the old expansion when ventilation had been a romance. Kunstler, yes, because music and air require each other, and someone in 1972 had been generous with their schematics. City Hall had a duct run like a rumor that started nowhere and ended in two closets. The PD had something else, a run abandoned when they\u2019d built the new evidence vault but never sealed because the budget had stopped at the part where you put locks on doors. \u201cYou could crawl it if you hated yourself,\u201d he said. \u201cYou would come out into the room where nobody keeps anything and then you would discover that everybody keeps something there because that is how humans treat unclaimed space.\u201d\n\nHe gave her a ring, not as a gift but as a loan that felt personal. It was not the ring with the nick; he did not offer that and she did not ask. It was identical in make, cheap, proud of being stainless in a world that rusts. She slipped it on her index finger and felt how it tugged against her skin, the weight choosing her hand\u2019s old aches with insulting accuracy. She placed it back on the desk before it decided to be sentimental.\n\nThe blog did not wait until night. It posted at two in the afternoon, which made office workers tilt their screens and students pretend to check the weather. It said:\n\nYou think fabric and pins and thread will let you stitch a person onto a bulletin board. You think a ring with a scratch is a face. I, too, like objects to tell the truth. That is why my rooms are better teachers than your talking. If you would like a list, here is your list: attention, rope, ledger, mercy, reconcile, door. If you would like another list, write your own. If you would like me to stop, you will have to stop asking the wrong questions.\n\nNoah forwarded it with the comment thread from the crime nerds underlined twice. Someone had noticed the repetition of reconcile and built an entire personality out of it in five fervent paragraphs. Someone else had suggested that the grammar shifted in a way that suggested the writer had spent time in two regions where the word soda meant different drinks. Someone had created a fake photograph of Poin wearing a blue scarf and holding a real sword and captioned it: BETRAYAL, which made her laugh by accident because at a certain point the city becomes a dog chasing its own tail and you can either bark along or crawl under a table.\n\nIn the lab, Noah had built a small altar to fishing line. He had six brands wound like prayers and a seventh he was pretending not to like. He had discovered under the microscope that the line on her toy carried a microscopic nick and that the nick had a shape that matched an economy cutter used by janitorial staff in buildings older than grammar. \u201cI am inventing a new field,\u201d he said, half proud and half appalled. \u201cForensic budget analysis via microplastics. Please don\u2019t alert the academy.\u201d\n\nShe thought of the custodian at Kunstler with the splinter scar and the solemnity of a man who found hand soap a matter of moral gravity. She refused to let her brain turn him into a villain because he had a face like a man who had decided to love a building and could not be talked out of it. She made herself say his name anyway, quietly, and Noah made himself say, just as quietly, \u201cHe doesn\u2019t smell like peppermint and paper. He smells like citrus solvent and quiet.\u201d He was right. Her body remembered smell and stored it in places her mouth couldn\u2019t reach.\n\nEvening found her sitting on Mrs. Liu\u2019s couch because Mrs. Liu had knocked and said, \u201cYou will sit,\u201d in a tone that makes the body obey. The widow had a radio with a knob that was more accurate than most men, and she tuned it to a public station where a woman with a velvet voice was making the city feel like someone was reading it a bedtime story. Poin ate the soup and felt her jaw unhook, and Mrs. Liu told her about a cousin who had made a ledger for the family in the old country and how the ledger had saved them from hunger because it remembered who owed whom their lives. \u201cYou cannot hate the book,\u201d Mrs. Liu said. \u201cYou can hate the hand. You can correct the hand. You can make a nicer hand take the pen. The book is a tool. Don\u2019t be silly.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy name in it,\u201d Poin said, because the soup had made her brave enough to say the hard quiet. \u201cMy name is in it as a threat or a prayer.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour name sticks to things,\u201d Mrs. Liu said, pleased to be the kind of neighbor who knew such a thing. \u201cThat is why they like to say it. That is why you must not hide. Also, that hat is mine and you will return it to my hook when you are done stealing it for your drama.\u201d\n\nShe returned the hat and laughed and it hurt and helped again. On her way back to her apartment she caught sight of herself in the hallway\u2019s dark frame and saw for a half breath the second pair of eyes she had been training herself to expect and not fear. She said her first and last name out loud twice and the eyes stayed hers the second time. This, too, was practice.\n\nShe woke with texts that said meeting. Lott had decided that the city should see itself at a podium and apologize for the rope as if the rope had asked to be included. The council had gathered under a large photograph of a river they had printed years ago and kept dragging behind them to make every room feel like there was water in it. The ADA had her careful words wrapped in careful hair; Stills stood at a potted plant because a potted plant made him feel like nature had blessed his role; citizens stood in the back and held their coats shut like moral arguments. Poin had a piece of paper that said: comprehensive leads, community patience, boring truth. She had a scarf in her bag she had borrowed from O\u2019Hara for the joy of returning it, and she had the ring of the municipal man not on her finger.\n\nThe tan coat man sat three rows back with the posture of a man who had learned to look like a person who listens. His hands were plain and his face was plain and his ring was plain. Poin said her sentences in an order that made calm sound like a weapon. She looked up once and saw the tan coat man not looking at her but at the exit sign, as if he were counting the letters. She saw, in the third row left, a woman with a blue scarf making a tight bow at the base of her throat and a face that had chosen not to bring its expression to the room. The bow looked like a choice made in a mirror by a hand that understood elegance in cheap cloth. The ring, when she saw it flash as the woman adjusted the scarf\u2019s lie, had a nick like a story.\n\nShe did not break the meeting for an arrest because she was a person who had learned to punish her impulses by giving them better times to exist. She finished her sentences. She let Stills say mercy the way a man in a good suit says dessert. She let the ADA talk about reconcile in a way that made her want to put her head on a table and yell and also made her admire the woman\u2019s commitment to geometry. She went to the hall afterward and made her body look casual in the way people do when they want their gravity to rearrange the crowd. The woman with the blue scarf stood by the donation box counting the pamphlets as if they were sins. Up close, the peppermint lived in her scarf and in her breath, and the paper smell belonged to her bag.\n\n\u201cYou look better on screens,\u201d Corrine Lafferty said, because names do not always surprise you. Her eyes were the color induced by rooms that love fluorescent lights more than people. \u201cIn person you look like a person who needs new chairs at home.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou look like someone who is tired of ladders,\u201d Poin said, because she had decided to gamble two truths at once. \u201cHow\u2019s your ring.\u201d\n\nLafferty\u2019s mouth twitched in that narrow space where truth and fight do a small dance. \u201cIt\u2019s stainless,\u201d she said. \u201cIt won\u2019t rust when people hold onto it and spill their coffee. You\u2019re not wrong about the ladders. The city builds nonsense and we climb it and then someone falls and we get sued. It makes you love paper.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou were in Kunstler,\u201d Poin said, watching the breath move under the scarf and the way the bow sat slightly off to the left like a person whose hips never learned straight lines. \u201cYou were in the library. You sign out your scarves. Do you sign out your hallways too.\u201d\n\n\u201cEveryone signs out their hallways,\u201d Lafferty said. \u201cYou just do it with your mouth.\u201d She adjusted the scarf and the ring flashed and showed the nick. It made a tiny confession and then pretended it had never met a crime. \u201cIf I wanted to bind boys, Detective, I\u2019d buy nicer rope. If I wanted to bind you, I\u2019d write a grant that paid for your name to be on every flyer and then I would sit in the back and watch you try to save a city with a pronoun. I don\u2019t like the way she uses rope. I like the way she uses rooms.\u201d\n\n\u201cHave you met her,\u201d Poin said, and Lafferty did the little head tilt that meant ask me that again in a room without microphones. The ADA drifted and took Lafferty\u2019s elbow and did the introductions people do when they have committed to professionalism as a way to pad a day. Lafferty shook hands and her glove breathed peppermint. Poin cataloged the pressure of her fingers, light and practiced, the way of a person who avoids letting touch become a commitment. The ADA\u2019s ring was gold and said nothing. Lafferty\u2019s was stainless and said maybe. The tan coat man had gone. He had a way of making absence as informative as his presence.\n\nThey got a search under paper, because sometimes paper grants courage to rooms. Municipal Systems had the courtesy to look stung when asked for Lafferty\u2019s itinerary and vent entries. Her logs were neat and could have been honest; neatness and honesty are not cousins. Three nights that matched draft times. One afternoon that did not. Six hallways that gave her a story. The vent run under the PD that led to the room where everyone kept nothing. The after-hours visit to Kunstler to check on a complaint about damp air. A signature at the library burned onto a sheet with a pen that had sputtered and then decided to behave. In the margin of one of the sheets, Lafferty had written the word reconcile and crossed it out and then written coordinate above it like she had taught herself what she wanted to look like on a different day.\n\nIn a conference room with glass like an aquarium, Stills argued, gently and with an eagerness that made Poin want to put a hand on his shoulder and then remove it, that an inspector is a city\u2019s immune system and sometimes immune systems attack the body they mean to guard. Lott showed them the photograph of Lafferty\u2019s holiday scarf and face and ring and said nothing for a long minute because saying things too soon makes them turn silly. Noah put down the fiber, the line, the photograph of the scratch, the recording where the metronome made a sound that had learned to be louder inside his head. Armitage sent a text with a single word: yes. Halladay sent a photograph of a lost-and-found scarf with a stain in the same place where hands obsessively adjust bows. Mrs. Liu asked if Poin needed more soup. Ezra\u2019s mother sent a picture of hands on a cello string, pressure where it belongs.\n\nThey took a warrant to Lafferty\u2019s house because the ADA understood that some rooms required the law to perform its rituals on their thresholds. Lafferty lived in a third-floor walk-up with a window that had learned to love rust because it brought color to a neighborhood that liked to pretend it had none. The apartment had the kind of order that comes from a person who is tired of being touched by other people\u2019s mess. The books stood like soldiers. The towels were folded with a precision that made Poin feel both judged and only mildly judged. Peppermint waited in a jar next to the sink under a sign that said RINSE YOUR CUP in lettering that wanted to be nicer than it was. On the table a stack of forms lived under a paperweight in the shape of a fish. On the mantel, if you could call the ledge over the radiator a mantel, a metronome sat where a photograph might have wanted to live. It matched the Kunstler make but its number had been sanded off with care and not enough skill.\n\nThe closet held a gray coat that did not want to make a statement and a tan coat with threads at the cuff that had caught on something rough once and remembered. The scarf drawer held three, all municipal blue, one with a pulled thread that glinted metallic under kitchen light. On the dresser a ring lay as if it had been put down to say, you be me for a minute. It was stainless and it had a nick that had met a certain toy in a certain room. The bathroom mirror had a crack like a line of thought someone had tried to tape back together. The medicine cabinet had the normal human humiliations, aspirin and a tile of old blush a friend had given her as a joke a decade ago. She had no rope. She had an empty box under the sink that had once held gloves and had been flattened with a neat heel.\n\nLafferty stood by the kitchen counter and watched them watch her life. She didn\u2019t fidget. She had given up fidgeting when the city took her first month\u2019s patience and never returned it. She did not deny the scarf or the ring. She did not claim the rope or the chair. She looked at the metronome and Poin thought she saw, under the careful face, a grief so mild it barely qualified the word, and she wondered who had given Lafferty the first tick she fell in love with.\n\n\u201cYou can arrest me,\u201d Lafferty said, when the ADA lifted a brow that had practiced its calm. \u201cYou can put me in a room and count me. It will bore me and I will talk in a way that makes Stills forget his microexpression book. But it will be honest. You will call me Giselle and I will say nothing and you will make a program out of my head and people will line up to ask you where I bought my scarf. It will make you feel like you ended something. It will not end anything you want to end.\u201d\n\n\u201cOthers,\u201d Poin said, because there it was, the word the blog had taught her to fear and believe. \u201cChorus.\u201d\n\nLafferty did not pretend not to know what dumb little word she meant. She shook her head once. \u201cI don\u2019t like choirs. I like quartets where everyone lets everyone else be a voice and doesn\u2019t pretend it is God. There are no others. There are rooms. There are men who like to watch. There are boys you can save by teaching them to be afraid. There is a city that thinks it can reconcile bad math with a photo on the front of the Chronicle. There is you. And me. That is enough chorus to make a song that will break some windows.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou were in my apartment,\u201d Poin said, because the closet held a hat that did not belong to Lafferty but to Mrs. Liu, which meant the city was starting to play jokes on her through unrelated doors. Lafferty\u2019s mouth did the small move again and then stopped moving because she had decided not to answer. Her silence said, I will not give you the satisfaction of learning which doors in your building do not lock.\n\nThey took her in. They took her ring. They took the scarf with the pulled thread. The fiber matched. The nick matched. The monologue matched and then didn\u2019t when they wanted it to be shallow. She did not confess to rope. She did not confess to water. She confessed to rooms. She confessed to the part where she had stood at the church with a peppermint in her cheek and watched Poin come in late and sit as if she had been saving the spot all week. She confessed, in a tone that made the room lean in because it allowed a woman to say a thing that was not self-defense, that she had written ledger because she liked neat lines and had disliked them as a child and had decided at thirty-one to change sides.\n\nNoah stood behind glass and wrote ATTENTION in block letters as if he could see through the mirror. Caswell stood in the doorway and tried not to throw a chair because he believed, with great sincerity, that everything would be fine if he threw a chair the right way. Lott sat and said reconcile in a voice that made the word vulgar and then tried again and made it almost tender. Stills asked if she had a partner and Lafferty looked at him with pity, which made him swallow and write down a fact anyway.\n\nWhen Poin asked her about the tan coat man, Lafferty looked at the wall. \u201cHe likes bridges,\u201d she said, and the way she said like made the roof change shape by an inch. \u201cHe likes watching. He thinks watching is innocence. He left a ring in a bowl once in a bar that I know the smell of. He will not get in your duct because he could get stuck and he knows it.\u201d\n\n\u201cName,\u201d Poin said, because names could be levers or lint. Lafferty put her hand flat on the table and did not make a fist. \u201cHe has three,\u201d she said. \u201cHe is not a chorus. He is a man who wants to sit in a room and feel like a choir. If you put him on a stage he will die. He would prefer to die on a bridge.\u201d\n\nThe Chronicle ran an extra with Lafferty\u2019s face, which made Poin want to break several small appliances. The blog posted after midnight. It said:\n\nLedgers hate being closed. You have closed one. You will write a book about it and claim you invented grammar. I do not mind. I used your rooms. You found your ring. I am bored. The river is bored. There is a boy who will put his hand on a rail tomorrow and think that makes him safe and you will tell him he is right because you need your mouth to be a lighthouse. We are done with rope. We are not done.\n\nNoah texted a photograph of a scar on a wrist next to a few new maps of vents. Armitage sent a peppermint emoji because she had learned to communicate that way to students and it seemed to be habit by now. Halladay sent a blank email with the subject line doors and nothing in the body and Poin laughed and then went to the window and put her forehead against the cold as if the glass could be a saint. Mrs. Liu knocked twice and told her to go to bed and not write in the kitchen because the table wanted to feel like a table in the morning.\n\nShe slept and dreamed a room full of metronomes again and watched them click into each other\u2019s time until the room was a single heartbeat, and in the dream she could not tell whether the beat belonged to a person or a city or a ledger stamping a number on the corner of a page. She woke before dawn and put on her wrong hat and went to the river and stood on a bridge because sometimes the only way to keep a place from becoming a stage is to walk across it like a person who is going somewhere. She kept her hands open on the rail. The water moved under the ice like two bodies arguing and agreeing without anyone above taking sides. The city breathed. The trains confessed. The day decided to be boring and then did not keep its promise.\n\nBy eight, the tan coat man had decided to keep his appointment with himself. He came up the east ramp like a man entering a church late, polite with his feet. He stood at the rail with her without touching anything she was touching. His eyes were not extraordinary and therefore she trusted them less. His ring had been replaced by skin. The white seam at his throat had decided to be subtle. He said her name with a care that made it sound as if he were setting it down on a shelf.\n\n\u201cYou missed the show,\u201d he said, and she heard the outrage of a child who had arrived at the fair after the fireworks. \u201cYou let them take a woman who likes ledgers and you think you have balanced anything. That\u2019s cute.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou should get a better insult,\u201d she said, and did not look at his hands because that would have made them both feel like they had started something. \u201cShe confessed to rooms. She did not confess to rope. Would you like to confess to rope.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou would like a partner,\u201d he said. \u201cYou would like to tell the city that a man had his hands on it. That will make the boys sleep better. I didn\u2019t touch your boys. I don\u2019t like rope. Rope likes to write its own story. I like watching. I like saying words like reconcile and seeing you not flinch. I like that you keep a toy in your corner that says you are a person and also a story. I like this bridge. I will leave on it when you ask me to leave enough times to make it feel like you did a thing.\u201d\n\nShe had learned to be very tired without letting any tiredness touch her mouth. She said, \u201cTell me your name,\u201d and he said, \u201cDo you think she knows my name,\u201d with a flatness that made her believe he was telling one honest thing. He put his palms on the rail and leaned like a person who has practiced not falling and did not test the city\u2019s patience by pushing further. \u201cYou can write down my face,\u201d he said, as if he were giving her a party favor that had rolled behind a couch. \u201cIt looks like anyone\u2019s. You can call me the wrong thing if it helps your paperwork. You can say\u2014I want to be careful how I say this\u2014you can say I am a ledger, too. But I am not. I am an audience. I am what keeps a city honest. You arrest her and you let me stand here. That is your bargain with yourself. That is your reconcile.\u201d\n\n\u201cNext time,\u201d Poin said, because sometimes you must say a promise to make a muscle remember. \u201cThere won\u2019t be a rail.\u201d\n\n\u201cNext time,\u201d he said, and the grin was small and made of nothing and she wanted, briefly, to push him with a finger just to witness gravity acting on a man who believed he was immune. He did not grant her the satisfaction of walking away fast. He drifted off as if the city had a current for how men like him traveled. He did not look back. The river did not make a sound that anyone else would have noticed. She put her hands back on the rail the way Ms. Liu put her bowl in the sink and scraped the chair. She counted four and breathed and counted four and breathed. The toy sword in her apartment leaned on its windowsill and pretended to be a talisman. Lafferty sat in a room and thought about rooms. Noah ate peanuts because she had told him to and also because he had forgotten to buy anything else. The ledger did not close. It turned a page and waited to see if anyone would write in a better hand.",

                              "content": "Rain came down like beads on wire, a fine gray chain curtain between lights and shadow. Roseville\u2019s river breathed a silver mist across the old brick warehouses by the tracks and stitched everything with a quiet that wasn\u2019t peace. Detective Poin kept her hood up and her hands in her coat, the left thumb worrying the rubber cap of a blue pen she didn\u2019t remember pocketing. Another body, she thought, but didn\u2019t say. The alley had that skittish look, trash in a jitter down the edges, a dented dumpster tilted a few degrees into shame.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re here before me,\u201d said Sergeant Caswell, stamping his boots. His beard was wet, darkening to a color that made his face look more serious than usual. \u201cOur Jedi knows when a disturbance hits the Force.\u201d\n\nHe was trying to make a joke; she gave him half of one. She didn\u2019t like the nickname\u2014Jedi\u2014from the Chronicle reporter who\u2019d watched her two years ago roll a confession out of a man everyone else said was clean. It stuck. People liked to pretend that her hunches came from somewhere out beyond the visible map. Poin preferred the word attention.\n\n\u201cWhat do we have?\u201d she said. The alley was guarded at each end with yellow tape. Their techs had parked a van in a puddle and were arguing about boots.\n\nCaswell glanced at his notes. \u201cMale, early twenties. ID says Carter Long, but you know.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll know when we know,\u201d she said.\n\nHe lifted his chin toward the tarp. \u201cVisible ligature marks. You\u2019ll want to see this.\u201d\n\nPoin let the hood fall back and watched her breath fog as she crouched. The smell under the tarp was rain and the particular sharp calm of coined blood, it never really left you. Carter Long had clear eyes in the old way, even though they had no more business seeing. A wiry body, a scar like a question mark near the wrist, a thin cotton hoodie with a university crest. The marks on his neck were faint banded kisses under the skin. Whoever had done it had been careful.\n\n\u201cYoung men,\u201d Caswell muttered. \u201cAlways the same. She\u2019s got a type.\u201d\n\nNo she, not officially yet; the blog was an idea, a rumor with a mouth. Poin nodded anyway. The posts had started two months ago, at first so vague no one would have tied them to anything. A voice calling itself Giselle, writing about pruning, about discipline and order. About the city\u2019s soft places and how to harden them. People read. People read everything.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s enjoying it,\u201d Caswell said, as if Poin and he were in a room with someone else, as if the rain and the river were listening.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not in her head,\u201d Poin said, and felt a slick little slide of dislike at her own voice. Because she didn\u2019t like attention directed at the wrong things. Because the word head made hers thrum. A low thunder started behind her eyes, slow, like early engines.\n\nCaswell cleared his throat. \u201cThe ADA is going to want you at the presser. The Chronicle is already circling. They want to call you the Jedi again.\u201d\n\n\u201cTell them to call me Detective,\u201d she said. It came out sharper than intended. The pen in her palm dug a small crescent into the line below her thumb.\n\nShe backed away from the body and looked overhead. Fire escape ladders rusted into place, a window left cracked, a plant dying on the sill. The alley opened onto the side of Kunstler Hall, Roseville\u2019s old music building, its gutters sighing. The pattern of the scuffs in the damp told her a story: knees on brick, hands on cold, the print of a shoe pivoting and then weight. Not much of a struggle. That part crawled under her coat and sat there.\n\nA light went on in the apartment across the alley, then off. She said these things without words to herself and to the part of her that listened: He knew her. He trusted the new friend. Or he didn\u2019t have time to be afraid.\n\nCaswell followed her angle gaze. \u201cYou think she brought him here from the silver bars by the river, the Monday night ninety-nine cent wing dens. Takes them out for a long walk like a dog with new boots.\u201d\n\n\u201cOr they walked together,\u201d Poin said. \u201cOr he wanted to be seen with her and it didn\u2019t matter where.\u201d\n\nCaswell made a sound like he\u2019d stepped on a tack. \u201cThat blog. They\u2019re going to ask about that blog.\u201d\n\nHe meant the one that had posted the words last night:\n\nI watch the way the boys cut through the storm like they own it. They believe the city will step aside for them the way doors go soft around a body. This isn\u2019t hate. This is correction. Someone has to keep a ledger, and I have always loved neat lines.\n\nNo names. No slurs. The voice was careful, precise. Amateur criminologists said it sounded like a woman imitating a man imitating a woman. Poin had read each line twice and then again on her phone in bed as the radiator clanged and the trains rolled six blocks away toward ice. She had tried to imagine that voice out loud. She had come up with a blank space where the face should be.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s more,\u201d Caswell said. \u201cWe found a bag behind the dumpster. Clean rope. Disposable gloves. Like, the kind that come in boxes you\u2019d keep in your kitchen if you were the kind of person who kept boxes in your kitchen.\u201d\n\n\u201cFingerprints?\u201d Poin said.\n\nHe spread his hands. \u201cNone. She\u2019s reading all the blogs about herself and sitting in one of those ergonomic chairs letting herself feel superior.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe,\u201d Poin said. She watched the trembling black mirror of the nearest puddle. A train horn bowed. The puddle shook and shivered open to the rain.\n\nBy noon she had spoken to Carter\u2019s mother, who held a mug she never drank from and looked at Poin\u2019s eyes as if the truth might be printed in those rings. There was a fat ginger cat that examined Poin\u2019s notebook with an offended tail and an outline of a Christmas tree in the corner where a thing had been and then taken away. Mother said: He never hurt a soul. Mother said: He never left without asking if we needed anything. Mother said: He loved to stand by the river even when it was cold, that dumb boy, he said the cold told you a story about what you\u2019re made of.\n\nPoin listened with her spine. She watched the mother\u2019s hands. One finger had a pale band where a ring had lived and had been taken off and placed in a dish and looked at and returned and taken off again. The house had a faint smell of lemon cleaning products, applied with devotion and urgency. Poin put a card on the table without looking down, because it felt better not to break eye contact. She told the mother nothing because there was nothing to tell, and left feeling like she had stolen something from the room after all.\n\nThe Chronicle\u2019s headline in the lobby newsstand that afternoon was half a question and half a song: JEDI V. GISELLE: WHO OWNS ROSEVILLE NIGHTS? She didn\u2019t buy a paper. In the elevator up to her floor she caught a glimpse of herself in the beveled mirror: hair that couldn\u2019t decide if it wanted to curl, eyebrows too expressive, a small scar under the lip that she couldn\u2019t remember receiving.\n\n\u201cPoin,\u201d called Noah from the lab as soon as she stepped out. He looked like he hadn\u2019t slept, or like he\u2019d enjoyed the not sleeping. He was the intern they kept in a hoodie with drawstrings like antennae. \u201cI got something. Maybe. You ready for maybe?\u201d\n\n\u201cAlways,\u201d she said, and followed the throb of monitors into his nest. Screens glowed with code like fast rain. News tabs bloomed over the corner of one screen\u2014speculative essays, fake composite portraits of Giselle, a cartoon with a cape. Noah pushed them aside with the flicks of a hand.\n\n\u201cThe blog\u2019s on Greylog,\u201d he said. \u201cWhich is...you know, basically a cave with a password. It\u2019s decentralized, they\u2019re proud of that, the forums are peanut butter messy. Good for people who think they\u2019re smarter than they are. She writes the posts in a hidden module then fires them out with a burst ID so it\u2019s hard to trace. But she left a crumb.\u201d\n\n\u201cCrumb,\u201d Poin said, liking the word. Liking the smell in here, which was old coffee and the sour edge of adrenalin.\n\n\u201cA timestamp of a draft,\u201d Noah said. \u201cNot the post itself. A draft saved to a local device. Which, if you do it right, never happens. But she clicked Save Draft instead of Save To Local then fired and overwrote. I went looking after your scribble on the board about the pattern of her errors. If you\u2019ve ever heard me say I\u2019m not a genius, it was a lie. Here.\u201d He pointed.\n\nDisplayed was a block of unseen things, then a string that wasn\u2019t random. Poin read, then read again. \u201cWhat am I looking at?\u201d\n\n\u201cIP stub,\u201d Noah said. \u201cPartial.\u201d He spun his chair to face her, elbow on desk, chin in hand. \u201cRoseville PD net. Someone piggybacked on our guest Wi-Fi for authenticated devices. Either she was inside the building last Tuesday or she has Creds for someone who was inside. Or we\u2019re being played by a fourteen-year-old with a flair for drama.\u201d\n\nThe thunder behind her eyes had begun as a suggestion, now it boomed, distant storm deciding to come closer. \u201cWhich Tuesday,\u201d Poin said.\n\nHe checked. \u201cThe one where you did the presser. Everyone was in and out. The lobby was a circus.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho accessed guest on that day?\u201d said Poin.\n\n\u201cYou know me, I could tell you, but then I\u2019d have to be fired,\u201d Noah said, too quickly. He shook his head. \u201cI can build you a list.\u201d\n\nPoin leaned on the desk and looked at the timestamp again. Last Tuesday, the hour of the press conference, the moment the Chronicle\u2019s camera light blew out and Poin had felt the press of bodies like hands on a wall. She could feel the heat of the room as if she were in it. There had been a water bottle. There had been a plastic sword next to the lobby Christmas tree that someone had hung there as a gag. Someone had dared her to pick it up. She had. Idiot.\n\nIn her head, a voice as small as a string snapped: You enjoyed it.\n\nHer notebook vibrated with a text. Caswell: Another post went up. You saw?\n\nShe didn\u2019t type. She nodded as if he were in the room. \u201cNoah,\u201d she said, \u201cwhat if the blog is scheduled? What if she writes one and seeds it when a thing happens?\u201d\n\n\u201cThen it wouldn\u2019t explain the draft,\u201d he said, fingers blur on the keys. \u201cBut yes. She could run macros. Except the tone changes. Sometimes she writes clipped and clean. Sometimes, look here, a little messy, a typo or two to make the true crime nerds fight about whether she\u2019s human or saint.\u201d\n\nPoin felt the left side of her mouth twitch. Typo or two. Her own text never sat straight unless she labored it. Words slid. She sometimes wrote letters like pools.\n\nNoah said, \u201cYou\u2019re spacing out. Does your Force whisper?\u201d\n\n\u201cShow me the latest,\u201d she said.\n\nHe slapped another window onto the screen. The post was titled Keeping the Ledger, too plain to mean anything.\n\nShe had written:\n\nIt isn\u2019t the skin that tells me what a boy believes. It\u2019s the way he laughs at the edge of the river like the wind adores him. How he says, lady, like his mouth invented the word. They say I hate and love the wrong things. Whatever lets them sleep. I learned about rot in old houses\u2014the way it looks like nothing from the outside and eats everything behind the paint. My city pretends not to know rot. I know it by smell.\n\nPoin read it twice, then a third time backward and then slow. She could taste the copper of her own tongue. The voice was precise and ornamental without ornaments. She could hear a hum inside the words like someone standing fluorescent close to her skin.\n\n\u201cRacist buzzwords in the earlier posts,\u201d Noah said, \u201clike code, like dog whistles\u2014the genealogy nonsense, the ancestry chest-beating\u2014but here it\u2019s cleaned, like she knows we\u2019re looking. She made sure this one could go on TV without a bar of sound.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs there an image?\u201d Poin said.\n\n\u201cOne,\u201d Noah said. \u201cA tree by the river. She posted it last week too. Reused content. Lazy or deliberate.\u201d\n\nThe tree stood in the picture like it had decided to die and changed its mind at the last second. There was a bench. There was the shadow of whoever took the photo, blurred. The coordinates embedded in the original image data had been stripped, someone had bothered to go through that trouble. Poin traced the shadow\u2019s shoulder. Not much to it.\n\n\u201cWhen is she going to make a mistake,\u201d Noah said, to the room, to the world, to the inverted shrine of LEDs around him.\n\n\u201cShe did,\u201d Poin said. She tapped where the IP stub lived as if it were a bullseye waiting. \u201cShe already did.\u201d\n\nShe left the lab with a file under her arm and realized half a flight down the stairs that there was no file under her arm. She had left it on a chair in the lab next to a cup with her lip print on it. She stood on the landing and closed her eyes for two full seconds, then five, then eight. She counted the breath in and the breath out, four counts each, to give the thunder in her head something to ride. The trick worked or didn\u2019t; who could say. On the second-floor landing a man with a cart of old case files said, \u201cDetective? You okay?\u201d and Poin smiled and held up a thumb without opening her eyes.\n\nThe apartment\u2019s radiator had decided to impersonate a ship\u2019s engine that evening, and the trains decided to be generous with their horns. Poin leaned against the window and kept her phone away from her face. She had asked Noah to set alerts for any change to the blog\u2019s source. She knew she\u2019d get no sleep if he did what she asked, and she asked anyway. The city below her window looked almost kind; that was what lights did. She had the plastic toy sword in the corner, a joke from a precinct party, green blade cloudy and bent towards the floor under its own cheap weight. Next to it, a plant came back from the dead with admirable stubbornness. Next to that, a stack of notebooks.\n\nShe opened a random one and found the staggering prints of a day she\u2019d wanted to forget. She had written with her left hand. The letters were tall and naive. She was right-handed. She stared at her own strokes and felt a bruise in the brain. She turned the page and it was her right hand again, marching. On the center of the page, a line burned: Don\u2019t let them give you a name you didn\u2019t ask for.\n\nHer phone danced on the sill. A ping. Noah: I know it\u2019s late, but we\u2019ve got a ping from the same guest network, different stub. She\u2019s (it?) is inside or near and maybe laughing at us. Sorry for the 10pm.\n\nPoin pulled a sweater over the cotton shirt she\u2019d fallen asleep half in and shoved her feet into shoes. The streets had iced with thin dark glass; the sky was a lid. She walked fast because it felt like if she stood still someone would pour concrete around her ankles. The building\u2019s security guard lifted his eyebrows and then shrugged, because they had all stopped asking why she was places already.\n\nNoah met her at the door to the lab with a grin like a lightning stripe. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t celebrate, but look.\u201d\n\nHe showed her the server logs. \u201cAccess came in on the guest then hopped to a secure channel and then out. That is not something you can do unless you know how to do it. And this time, the person was lazy for a second, or cocky. We caught enough of a time stamp to tie to a camera.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhich camera?\u201d Poin\u2019s voice had gone lower, or else the room had.\n\n\u201cLobby,\u201d Noah said. \u201cThis is where it gets weird.\u201d\n\nHe turned one screen into a bank of four and rolled the video. People in winter coats as a river flows through a pipe, the flash of a badge, a child with an armload of flyers, Caswell with a coffee he didn\u2019t drink. Then there: a person in a coat that did not want to make a statement. Gray, unmemorable. A scarf over the lower face because January demanded it. A hand slipped through the frame, hand on a phone. The posture was somehow disguised and not. The person paused near the tree where someone had hung the plastic sword like an ornament. The person\u2019s head turned. Poin watched the small tilt of it. Then the person moved on.\n\n\u201cStill frame?\u201d Poin said. Her mouth was dry. She saw the moment the phone\u2019s screen lit the scarf from below with the sick blue that made everyone look like ghosts.\n\nNoah froze the frame and zoomed without apology to physics. Pixels fought back. It didn\u2019t matter. Poin had the sensation of standing in front of a mirror with someone else\u2019s breath on the glass. She recognized nothing. She recognized the way the hand held the phone. Thumb over the lower corner, index along the top edge. The old pinch from a broken finger never set right. She lifted her hand without meaning to and her own index lined along the top edge of a phone that wasn\u2019t there.\n\n\u201cCould be anybody,\u201d Noah said. \u201cCould be the Queen of Holland.\u201d\n\n\u201cOr me,\u201d she said, and swallowed it almost before it existed, because you do not feed a stupid thought you do not want to keep.\n\nNoah kept talking because his job was to break fear into smaller chewable cubes. \u201cWe can run the coat color through the feed. There are only sixteen gray coats in that hour. We can track each to a face. We can loose the bloodhounds. We can\u2014\u201d\n\nPoin put her hand on his shoulder. \u201cDo it in the morning. Go home.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou sound like my mother,\u201d he grinned. \u201cShe\u2019s going to like you.\u201d\n\nShe spent the rest of the night in her apartment counting the shudders between train horns, a ritual born from years trying to outpace the darker seizures of the mind that would come over her like a shadow thrown by a plane. Sometimes it was better to ride them. Sometimes it was better to lie still and pretend to be a coastline. The plastic sword in the corner leaned harder toward the floor. At two a.m. she woke on the couch with the notebook on her chest and a black smudge on her thumb she couldn\u2019t explain. No memory of where in the apartment she\u2019d left her keys. No memory of standing up.\n\nAt six a.m., she went to the river because the blog had taught her that quiet places were where noisy things started. The bench in the photo cradled a terrible ordinary quiet. An old man with two dogs walked a line like a stitch. A couple in matching coats posed for a selfie. Poin sat where she shouldn\u2019t, closed her eyes for a dare, and listened to the city move through itself.\n\nThe voice inside her had a thin accent it didn\u2019t used to. It said, You won\u2019t find her because that\u2019s not what you\u2019re actually doing.\n\nShe opened her eyes to frost on the edge of the bench again. She knew the voice. She called it the second thought and tried not to give it the floor. She had been told, once, by a woman with the calmest hands, that there were old names for the way her mind built rooms. The woman had said it in a tone like she was laying down a napkin in a lap: dissociation, personality states, old categories of survival. Poin had nodded the nod of a soldier who\u2019d seen an artillery map and then folded it into a paper bird. You could learn to hold multitudes and not be stunned by the chorus.\n\nHer phone trilled. Caswell: Media wants you at the podium. You\u2019re the knight with the glow sword. You ready to sound boring and true?\n\nShe typed: Always.\n\nThe Chronicle\u2019s lights were cruel but Poin had learned to stand in the curl of them and never flinch. She delivered into the microphones a careful stack of words: We are following comprehensive leads. We ask the community for patience. We will not be sharing speculative details. The sound on TV later made her mouth seem steadier than it had been. A commenter on the Chronicle\u2019s live feed typed, The Jedi sounds like she might actually break, and a second user typed, She sounds like weather.\n\nAfter, a woman cornered her in the hall and said, \u201cIs it true she targets men? What\u2019s the city supposed to do?\u201d\n\nPoin said, \u201cNobody is a target until someone decides to make them that. The city is supposed to see each other. And call us when anything is wrong.\u201d She said it even though what she wanted to say was that you could do everything right and still be chosen.\n\nAt her desk a printed page lay under a paperweight: an anonymous letter. She recognized the brand of perfume on the envelope\u2014something from a drugstore, floral and too earnest. The letter said:\n\nI read her blog and I recognize things. Not the killing. But the order. I wish I could draw a room around the whole city and arrange us until we fit. Does that make me a villain. Please don\u2019t respond. There\u2019s a church on Ryal where the floorboards cry. I sit there sometimes. You can sit there too.\n\nShe slipped the letter into her bag because it made a shape in her head that felt important. The church on Ryal had a boat hull ceiling, she remembered, and benches that made you swear you had long legs. She hadn\u2019t been inside since her father\u2019s trade school graduation party fifteen years ago. Outside the window a white truck drove by with a ladder belted to the top like a long sharp hope. For a second her brain translated the image as a cross carried by a man too small to lift it. She shook the translation away.\n\nNoah promised her a matrix by noon, faces of the sixteen gray coats laid out like a deck of cards. Poin went to the church because the letter was a vein and she knew to tap veins while they still pulsed. The floorboards did cry, which made a noise like the word no in a child\u2019s mouth. She picked an empty pew and sat like a tourist. An old woman two rows up lit a candle in a small stubbed bowl. Someone had left a crocheted shawl over the back of a seat. The Jesus at the front looked as if he had been patched from other Jesus parts. She didn\u2019t find the letter-writer. She found a sense that the room remembered every person who had put their head in their hands here. It was almost too much to hold.\n\nHer phone buzzed. Not Noah. A number she didn\u2019t know.\n\nThe text said, You\u2019re late.\n\nShe turned in the pew and looked at the doorway. Nobody. She typed, For what?\n\nFor what, came the text back, ridiculous. For understanding the shape of what I\u2019m doing.\n\nShe had the sudden unhelpful sensation of being underwater while someone spoke from a boat. Her reply fingers hovered. She typed, Who is this.\n\nGiselle, came back. Then, in a second message, No, the person who plays her. You too can be more than one thing. Come on. All of Roseville thinks so.\n\nPoin\u2019s mouth did a thing she would later remember in exact detail. The tremor at the corner, the breath that didn\u2019t arrive. She almost called the number. Almost pinged it to Noah with the sound of a siren. Instead she typed, You\u2019re sloppy.\n\nThe reply came with a hesitation she could measure in heartbeats. Am I? Or are you very tired and forgetting the part where you agreed to dance.\n\nShe stood up enough to move to the shadow of a pillar. The light made grids on the floor. The old woman up front moved her candle to another slot as if she were playing chess.\n\nPoin typed, You want to be caught. This is a script and you\u2019re bored by it.\n\nThe answer felt close enough to be breathed into her hair. Maybe. The work is the work, and I am not a liar. But the stagehands like their cues. Look to the river tonight.\n\nShe closed her eyes. The trains three blocks away sounded like whales.\n\nWhen she opened them there was a man at the end of the pew, maybe thirty, a blandly handsome that certain men had when they shaved too close. He didn\u2019t look at her. He knelt. He checked his phone while he knelt. There was a thin white line on the side of his neck like a healed paper cut. He felt like nothing. A piece of furniture. She didn\u2019t know why she noticed him.\n\nAt her desk that afternoon, Noah handed her a grid of sixteen faces and a seventeenth that wasn\u2019t a face, just a blur. He had circled four with a red marker. \u201cThese are the ones with no IDs in system and no hits on the quick facial match. We can go longer-form. This guy,\u201d he tapped a square, \u201cturns his head away every single time like he studied where the cameras were. Either he\u2019s deeply bored or he\u2019s...not bored.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019d you get a red marker,\u201d Poin said, because saying the other things out loud might let them in.\n\n\u201cYou left it on the floor near the printer,\u201d he said. \u201cYou drop things, did you know, Detective?\u201d\n\nShe took the sheet. The blurred face occupied the center. She tried to read the man who turned his head without seeing him. She put her finger over him like a game and heard herself say, \u201cThis one.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can run that,\u201d Noah said. \u201cBut what if we\u2019re wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen we\u2019re wrong,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been wrong before and the world didn\u2019t stop.\u201d\n\nAt five, another post went up. It said:\n\nThe river stills me. People think water stands still when it freezes; it moves under. Boys love to run their hands along the skin and pretend they can\u2019t feel the two bodies arguing. I am not a ghost. I stand on the bank. I put my palms on the air between us. I ask, Will you be better. Tonight I will ask again.\n\nCaswell swore, the good Irish old man swear. \u201cShe\u2019s inviting an audience. We need eyes.\u201d\n\nThey sent two units to the north river bend and two to the south and Poin took the central bridge herself. Frost flared in the beams. Breath rose like small storms. She leaned on the rail and watched the black slow muscle of the water.\n\n\u201cCity\u2019s spine,\u201d said a voice at her left. The blandly handsome man from the church stood there, hands open on the cold metal. A polite tourist. His hair slicked. A softer coat now, tan. \u201cYou ever feel like we\u2019re insects on a sleeping dog.\u201d\n\n\u201cI feel like we\u2019re insects,\u201d she said, and let the rest go. \u201cYou should head home. It\u2019s not safe.\u201d\n\n\u201cDetective Poin,\u201d he said, saying her name like a weather report. \u201cI liked your little speech. You looked bored.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou like everything?\u201d she said, not moving the weight of her body.\n\n\u201cNot everything,\u201d he said. He stretched his neck and the white healed line tugged and she thought: not a paper cut, a rope burn touched and removed. He didn\u2019t touch the line. He looked at her with that polite surface that you use with people you intend to leave immediately. Then he turned and walked down the bridge as if he had someplace he needed to be. He did not look back.\n\nFrom the north came a shout. From the south came a hand signal light to her left, two pulses. She spoke into the radio clipped to her coat and felt her mouth dry out further. The wind went through her coat like a needle. The river said nothing.\n\nShe stayed on the bridge until her toes went the numb that presaged later agony. Then she stayed another five minutes. When she finally moved, because her body insisted, because the human machine calls the shots no matter how much you think you are mind, her phone buzzed again.\n\nNice to see you in church, said the text.\n\nShe didn\u2019t answer. She walked, watched, stopped, breathed. She felt the far click-click of her jaw, which meant she needed to eat something that wasn\u2019t coffee or a regret. She found herself around the corner from the newsroom and kept moving past. The multi-plex lot threw a bruise of light across the sidewalk.\n\nShe unlocked her apartment door by muscle memory and felt a drift of cool air that murmured Not empty. Her hand went to nothing on her hip\u2014she was in a coat, no sidearm at home\u2014and then to the plastic toy sword in the corner, absurd, ridiculous. She held it anyway. It whined a tiny child\u2019s whine when she mashed the on button. The cheap green lit the room and made the plants look ill.\n\n\u201cCute,\u201d said a voice in the kitchen.\n\nShe lifted the toy. \u201cIf you move, this will not do anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d said the voice. \u201cI\u2019m tired of things working.\u201d\n\nShe took three steps and saw her reflection in the window. She saw a figure opposite it, someone wearing her coat. She saw her own coat on a stranger\u2019s shoulders. Then she blinked and the figure was her reflection only. Then she blinked again and noticed the sink light had been left on.\n\nThe note on the counter said:\n\nYou haven\u2019t noticed yet. That\u2019s okay.\n\nHer hands shook. The toy sword was nothing, a child\u2019s laugh. She moved through the rooms, checked the closets, the bathroom with its row of old hotel soaps she kept as if they were talismans. Nobody. She studied the note because the only thing to do with an object is to study it. The plastic of the cheap pen used, the tilt of the letters. They leaned left. The lowercase g had a curious hook.\n\nShe looked at her notebooks on the shelf. She pulled one out. Left-leaning letters in half the pages, right-hand script steady in the other half. The g was hers. The g was also not hers. She sat down hard in the chair like someone had removed the floor.\n\nThe phone chimed. Noah: I know, it\u2019s late again. We ran the movement patterns. Your pick is on six cameras, then none. He disappears behind two pillars in the library and then never exists. Ghost country. I don\u2019t like it.\n\nShe typed to him: Sleep. We\u2019ll just get worse if we don\u2019t.\n\nHe sent a thumbs up and a sticker of a cartoon ghost trying to hold a laptop.\n\nAt ten past midnight, the blog posted again. The entry was four sentences long.\n\nShe wrote:\n\nHe reached out like he wanted a blessing and I saw that he had no idea what a blessing was. I only take what is already offered. I only write what someone else has taught me to write. I learn. I learned from inside your walls. That made me laugh.\n\nPoin sat with her back to the room and her eyes on the window where the city rearranged itself like a slow-congealing dream. She thought of the scarf in the lobby, the hand on the phone, the way her own index finger followed the top edge. She thought of the voice in the church like a boat calling down to her. Of the doctor with the calm hands and the old names that were supposed to help.\n\nShe told herself, out loud, because sometimes the only thing that made the room real was sound: \u201cI know who you are.\u201d\n\nIn the window, in the faint reflection, something like a second pair of eyes blinked. Or she did. Or both. The radiator banged once, twice, then went soft, as if embarrassed. Pieces clicked behind her temples in a pattern like rain.\n\nShe turned off the toy sword and set it against the wall. She picked up a pen she didn\u2019t remember pocketing, the blue cap warm from her skin, and wrote on a fresh page in a fresh book: We are not going to let her keep the ledger. We are going to write another book.\n\nHer hand shook at the end. The g hooked in that curious way, then corrected itself, the hook straightened on the next line. In the hallway outside her door a neighbor coughed very softly, a human cough, like an apology for existing at this hour. The trains, at last, fell quiet. The city waited for the ice to make up its mind. Poin sat very still, and somewhere in a room behind a wall, somebody else did too. Or it was only her, pretending to be more than one thing, because that is what survival had taught her to do. She put the cap on the pen and did not look at the clock because she knew it would fail to be kind. She listened. She practiced attention. She let the thunder step back just enough, not gone, never gone, just to the edge of the field.\n\nOut there, in the black seam of the river, a thing moved that was not water. Or maybe it was water pretending to be someone else. She would go in the morning. She would go before it remembered her face. She would go and touch the rail and wait and watch and be boring and true.\n\nAnd somewhere, a voice made itself ready to tell a story about what she was, and what she wasn\u2019t, and how one could be a monster and a ledger and a detective and a myth. The city hummed. A draft lifted a corner of the note on the counter. The plastic sword leaned a little more towards its own surrender.\n\nPoin curled herself around the center of her body and breathed, counted, up to four, down to four, like she was building a small bridge over a very cold part of a river. She slept. Or she didn\u2019t. The page didn\u2019t care. The night kept going. The ledger waited for a new hand. The chapter line, if there were a chapter line printed in air, would have looked like a horizon nobody would recognize until it was too late.",

Poin went there before the frost had decided whether it would commit; the breath of the water met the breath of the city and they argued in low voices, white against white. She wore a hat she found by the door that didn\u2019t belong to her and let it be a mystery for later. The bench from the photo had kept its appointment with dawn. The slatted seat was a ledger in miniature, wet lines and wet lines and the tiny math of melting ice between. She stood and let the pulse in her left temple ease against the metal rail, the cold a correction that didn\u2019t feel punitive. Something tapped under the bridge with a patient metronomic insistence. She thought for a moment it was a damaged pipe. Then the tick came again, not a pipe\u2019s language but the one musicians used when they promised to be better.\n\nShe saw it because she had trained for things that would prefer not to be seen. Four feet out from the bend of the railing, a plastic-wrapped block bobbed and resisted the current the way an animal will to show it understands it can\u2019t win. It had been tethered to the undergrid with black cord and a fisherman\u2019s knot, neat and prideful. The wrap had fogged from within, a poor choice of bag for someone who liked order, or a choice made because the look of the thing was more important than the preservation. She watched it tick and thought of the old music building a block off, its gutters sighing at her earlier in the week like a tired aunt. She looked for an easy way to reach, found a fallen branch with a fork like a crooked hand, and lay herself down on the slick concrete in a way that would make Caswell call her a saint or a fool. She hooked the fork under the cord and drew the package across without letting it bang against the concrete wall. It came up like a captured thought. The tick did not apologize for being obvious.\n\n\u201cWhat do you say,\u201d she murmured to the morning because nobody else was brought to listen, and only then did she think to text for a unit. The bag had a seam of dissolving tape at the top and the condensation inside had written its own fog script on the walls. She didn\u2019t open it with her teeth the way an ignorant person might because muscle memory had been trained out of that than by a dozen lectures with slides. A patrolman who looked too new for his boots stepped up behind her and said her title with that hesitant make-sure-you\u2019re-a-person-and-not-something-I-invented tone that rookies wore like a starched collar. She had him call for evidence while she touched nothing and everything with her eyes. The metronome inside was wood, not plastic, triangular and dignified even under its saran shroud, the way old things are when they have survived flood and neglect. There was a number burned into the base where the varnish had gone thin from fingers: KH-213. Her mouth did a thing that was both a smile and a flinch. Kunstler Hall, probably; two hundred-level room, likely the practice suites along the north corridor. The killer had not gone to the trouble of purchasing an anonymous metronome from a chain store. The killer had borrowed. The killer had taken something that would be missed.\n\nCaswell arrived with coffee that had been brave once. He made a noise he made when he saw a thing that felt like an insult. \u201cThis is theater,\u201d he said, and then he put the coffee on the ground like he was laying it in state so he could use his hands to point at the world. \u201cShe\u2019s staging these beats. She wants us to hear a tick. She thinks we can\u2019t hear our own.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe wants us in the right room,\u201d Poin said. She watched condensation coalesce and run like teardrops then laughed a little at herself for the metaphor. She had rules for what to believe in, and one was that objects don\u2019t cry for you unless you tell them how. She angled her head at the hall up the hill. \u201cLet\u2019s go see who missed their timekeeper.\u201d\n\nThe Kunstler building had been built in a year when legislators had loved ships; the ceiling in the lobby had ribs like a hull and if you lay down on the tile, which Poin had once done after an alumni party as a dare, you could imagine yourself pinned under a boat that had decided to stop floating. The receptionist\u2019s desk held a jar of earplugs and a bowl of peppermint candies and a little sign that said Please assume a class is going on. The woman behind the desk wore her hair in a bun so tight it read as professionalism and not punishment. Poin showed a badge and the burned number. The woman\u2019s eyes sharpened and then softened and then sharpened again, the way people\u2019s did when their job collided with a larger story. \u201cWe log everything,\u201d she said, and Poin already liked her. \u201cYou think it\u2019s one of ours?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it was meant to tell me it\u2019s one of yours,\u201d Poin said. She kept neutral pronouns in place because language could talk people into seeing things they hadn\u2019t. The woman, whose lanyard said ARMITAGE and who liked peppermint because her breath smelled faintly of it, pulled out a binder old enough to have known rain.\n\n\u201cWe had a theft,\u201d Armitage said. \u201cLast week, day after your thing with the cameras. Someone posted a review of our noon program and then someone else mentioned, as an aside, that the third-floor bathrooms had no hand soap, and then our night manager noticed a metronome gone from 213. I wrote the report out of habit; they told me don\u2019t bother the police with a forty-dollar object when the whole world is on fire. I sometimes like to pretend that my job counts, so I wrote the report anyway.\u201d\n\nPoin liked her more than was professional. She smoothed the page Armitage handed her. The report had neat lines and block print and a stamp that meant nothing legal and everything important inside an institution: documented. Poin noted the time, the staff signature, the name of a student who had been last on the room schedule before the loss: J. REY. She told herself not to get romantic about an initial that could belong to any of a thousand people. The room itself felt like most practice rooms felt: a padded coffin with a window. She let herself sit on the piano bench because sitting teaches the room something about you and she preferred to tell rooms that she wouldn\u2019t break them if they didn\u2019t break her. The metronome had left a dust-free triangle on the shelf, a ghost of a ghost. The wall above the piano had the usual rash of tacked things: a poster for a string quartet series that had started three Tuesdays ago, a flyer for a winter formal with a drawing of a snowflake that had been too optimistically complex, a comic in which a conductor yelled at a cat. There was also, at the edge, a piece of grid paper with a practice chart: Monday Scales, Tuesday Etudes, Wednesday Repertoire, neat lines made by a student who wanted a life to be a ledger that wanted her back.\n\nShe asked Armitage to print the room log for 213 for the last two weeks and to not tell anyone that the police had asked for it until Poin could be out of the building. Armitage said \u201cI can do discretion, detective,\u201d in a tone that made Poin think about choir directors she had known who could silence an auditorium with a hand. A custodian wheeled a cart past and nodded at Poin as if they had seen each other at the river. She watched his hands without making it weird. He had a small scar by the knuckle where a splinter had gotten uppity. He said, \u201cWe had a woman in that day with a scarf and an attitude. Said she was here to see if we were ADA compliant. I tried to help and she made a face like I\u2019d given her a plate of hair.\u201d\n\n\u201cDay,\u201d Poin said, because she would take any scrap and ask it for its coat. \u201cTuesday?\u201d\n\n\u201cTuesday,\u201d he said, and added, \u201cThe one with all the press.\u201d He looked as if he had laughed in the privacy of his own throat at least once that day, at something he would not tell. Poin asked him gently to describe scarf woman, and he did: average height in a coat the color of sidewalk, scarf blue because he had a thirteen-year-old daughter who knew blues, shoes flat like a kindergarten teacher\u2019s shoes. He made a rectangle with his hands when she asked him about phones, because we all do that gesture now, and she thought of a scarf lit from below by a dim aquarium glow in a lobby camera.\n\nOn the way out of Kunstler a small pair of bass notes leaked from a room like an apology for the noise that would follow later, and at the end of the hall an open door breathed out a smell of rosin. Poin kept a hand loose in her pocket over the blue pen she didn\u2019t remember pocketing, a small self-intervention. She wanted to talk to J. Rey because the name on the practice log felt like a needle threading through separate cloth. Armitage put a fingertip to a faculty roster and found a student: Juliana Rey, sophomore, cello, River Program scholarship. Poin decided to call later because saying the wrong sentence to a nineteen-year-old with a scholarship could feel like dropping a weight onto a web. She left Armitage with a peppermint thank-you that she didn\u2019t suck because some childish superstition insisted that if you put a candy in your mouth before noon you were telling the day how it could go.\n\nInternal Affairs wanted her back at the building and they wanted her yesterday. They had built a conference room tableau in neutral blue: screen, pitcher of water that would not taste like water, two men who had practiced their expressions in college and groups since. Captain Lott had a jaw that had been fed the right kind of fight and another guy\u2014Stills, with hair that wanted to leave the party but hadn\u2019t found its coat yet\u2014did the kind head tilt of someone who had, somewhere in his house, a book about microexpressions and their uses. They did not ask her to sit but they had put a chair in such a way that to stand was to make a point and she had already made enough points to last a lifetime, so she sat.\n\nLott pointed to the paused lobby footage like God pointing to a fresco if God had grown tired. He tapped a finger on the blur that could be anyone. He said what he had to say; he said it slow because slowness is an interrogation technique. \u201cWe are required to notify you that a device inside this building was used to access what we\u2019re calling the Giselle content portal. We are required to tell you that the time stamps intersect with the presser last week, at which you were present. We are required to tell you that because the access was through the guest network, the device could have been anywhere in the building, and because of the way the routes were rear-ended into the secure network, we don\u2019t know more. We are required to say that you are not a suspect. We are also required to ask you where you were when your face wasn\u2019t on all the screens.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was standing in the lobby being told I looked like weather,\u201d Poin said. She did not mention the plastic sword. She did not mention the feeling she had of being a house with one room she didn\u2019t go into after dark. Stills asked her to describe the scarf a person had been wearing, as if she were the one who had picked it out, and she reminded him that the scarf in the video had been a smear and that colors aren\u2019t colors in LED memory. Lott asked her if she had let anyone use her credentials; she said no. He asked her if she ever used the guest network; she said she didn\u2019t even use her own network unless Noah told her a story about what would happen if she didn\u2019t. He asked to look at her phone and she said yes, because it was either that or walk out and make a fight she\u2019d know how to win only after it was over.\n\nThey kept her phone long enough that she felt both nude and ridiculous for feeling nude. She watched the two men watching her, the way an actor watches an audience through a scrim. Lott had the grace to admit this was performance with real consequences. \u201cWe are doing this with everyone in the building,\u201d he said, not even pretending that she would believe him without evidence. \u201cWe are also sending you nowhere alone until I tell you different. Pair up or shout. I\u2019ve got half the city council wanting me to stand at the next podium and say we have everything under control. I have the other half wanting me to apologize for existing. You are in the middle and so am I. Congratulations.\u201d\n\nShe took her phone back and felt its weight with a careful part of her mind. She could have told him about the text in the church. She could have told him the careful truth that there were parts of her day she didn\u2019t always remember in crisp lines. She could have told him that there was a letter in her bag that smelled like a drugstore aisle where someone had once chosen hope. She told him she had found a metronome with a burn mark, because that was solvable. His eyebrows did a small remark when she said the initials KH. He said, \u201cYou think it\u2019s a game,\u201d and she said, \u201cI think the playing is the point,\u201d and then Stills, who had been pretending to be a fern, said, \u201cGiselle is a ballet about a dead girl who dances men to their deaths,\u201d and Poin wanted, with an ugly suddenness, to tell him to shut all the way up. She added a quiet \u201cthank you\u201d instead because not every unhelpful fact should be punished.\n\nNoah found her in the copy room pretending to need copies like everybody else in there actually needed copies. He held a stack of printouts in one hand and a bag of peanuts in the other and looked like an owl who had stayed up too late at a rave. He had energy nobody owned. He pushed the peanuts at her like they were medicine and she took them and didn\u2019t argue with that logic. He showed her the grid he had promised and a second grid he had not promised, one for the library that had swallowed the man with the polite face and had not returned him. \u201cWatch,\u201d he said, in the tone of a magician who recognizes that he can\u2019t control the lighting but will make do. He scrubbed through the library\u2019s interior cameras around the hour when their non-face had vanished. There were two pillars and a lot of stacks. People moved in patterns that looked almost musical, loops and breaks. Their man slid behind pillar one, and the angle to pillar two should have caught him as he crossed and it did not. Noah flipped to a feed for the opposite corner and the man did not arrive. He flipped to the staff door around the corner and nothing. He flipped again to an overhead that was only there because Noah had convinced a budget committee that sometimes birds\u2019 eyes were worth paying for. There, a staff cart had been parked in a way that made a blind wedge when the two camera cones intersected. The man stepped into the wedge and then the wedge remained but contained no man. The staff door never opened. The vent grate two feet off the floor had been unscrewed and then screwed back, which Noah would not have noticed and Poin would have noticed only if her head had been a quieter place that day. In the feed\u2019s flat light the screws shone like wet eyes going to sleep.\n\n\u201cHow big is that vent,\u201d Poin said, because sometimes the answer is as stupid and unsatisfying as math.\n\n\u201cNot big enough if you live on a planet with gravity,\u201d Noah said. He rubbed his knuckles and added, \u201cUnless you are somebody who practiced being a ghost. There\u2019s crawlspace; there\u2019s duct, there\u2019s an exit into a ladder alcove that they built in the seventies when everyone was afraid of fire and not as afraid of surveillance. The blueprint suggests a dead end, except the blueprint is wrong or out of date. I went there; I\u2019m not supposed to go there. The paint is new on the vent, which means someone touched it recently and wanted it to be invisible and failed because new paint is a kind of spotlight from a certain angle.\u201d\n\n\u201cI like you,\u201d Poin said, and meant it the way you say to a person who has just taken a job with you into a room where the floor will sometimes move. He put the peanut bag in her hand when she hesitated and said, \u201cEat, or I tell Caswell you were driving a low blood sugar rocket into crime scenes.\u201d\n\nShe went to the library with a toddler\u2019s backpack because a bright yellow thing made people see a person differently, and even though she felt foolish for gaming that, she did it anyway. The reference desk woman, Halladay, had carved cheekbones and a haircut that said give me practical or get out of my face. Poin recognized a kindred religion: attention as a gift, rules as a kindness. Halladay knew her by name because every city has the same thirty people who know and be known. \u201cDetective,\u201d she said. \u201cWe used to check out detectives in books. Now we get to check them out in real life, which I can\u2019t recommend.\u201d\n\nPoin let her laugh like a cough and asked about the pillars and the carts. Halladay did not say don\u2019t be ridiculous because she had learned by profession that what looks ridiculous at the front desk often gets practical in the stacks. She said, \u201cWe had a maintenance request the day after the big presser. The ladder alcove had a burnt-out fixture. It\u2019s a nothing door. Staff only so that the students don\u2019t climb a ladder and discover gravity. But maintenance was late and the light was out and somebody could have felt very good about not being seen. Also, I found this this morning.\u201d She handed Poin a bookmark. It was one of the library\u2019s normal ones, inspirational quote on one side about the democracy of reading, on the other a grid of ledger lines drawn over the quote in pencil, numbers in the boxes like a child\u2019s pretend accounting. Some of the numbers were circled with care. Halladay said, \u201cWe keep pencils at the desk and the kids are terrible with them, but this pencil was strange. It made a squeak on the paper like a violin that forgot where to put its fingers. I threw the pencil out, so if you need me to redo my mistake in a less helpful way, I can\u2019t.\u201d\n\nPoin held the bookmark like a fossil. The numbers had a date pattern logic if you squinted, the way lawyers in shows squint at things until they are the shape of victory. She saw 11, 23, 17, 4, 213. She saw an initial clipped on one axis: R. She saw the alphabet counted like pennies. She told herself she was not a cryptographer. She told herself that the brain will bend numbers until they say what you want. She also told herself to keep it. Halladay added, \u201cThere are ledgers downstairs in the city records, if ledgers are your kink. The old tax books are bound like bibles. People come on Tuesdays and turn the pages to make sure the dead still owe them. It\u2019s good Tuesday sport.\u201d\n\nDownstairs, the city\u2019s paper skeleton slept behind glass. Poin asked an assistant with sweater fuzz under his nails if she could look at the 1970s volume for municipal improvements and he looked both proud and afraid to be asked. He brought her a book that weighed the same as a cinderblock made by saints. She spread it on the table and thought of her father\u2019s hands at that metal high school podium, rough from work and gentle in ways he never knew how to measure. In the 1972 column for the renovation of that very library, a line mentioned a ladder alcove created for maintenance, with a small appendix note that the ventilation access had been \u201ctemporarily extended\u201d pending funding. The funding had not come. The temporary had lived long enough to eat through three marriages and four mayors. Someone had drawn a small square in the margin decades ago and initialed it R.E.H., which Poin knew stood for Richard E. Halliday because the basement loved to know the names of its own former gods. She thought about how spaces make their own quiet treaties with time and with the people who learn those treaties and exploit them. She thought about the man who had put his neck into a rope once and won the argument. She thought about the text in the church that had come out of nowhere and smelled like someone watching.\n\nHer phone lived under her hand like a sleeping animal. It woke with the polite shudder of a message because phones had learned to apologize for their own intrusions. Caswell had written: We\u2019re sending unis to Kunstler rooms in rotation. I told them if they see a woman with a scarf to ask her to knit us all hats. He had added a wry face because he was a man of his time. Noah had sent: The metronome is from a batch ordered by the school in 2004. They engraved numbers because people like to keep track of their few honest tools. He added: I like that someone taught you to eat peanuts again. The text that wasn\u2019t from either of them came to her without a name but with the confidence of someone who believed, with some reason, that they could rent space in her head for free. It said, I was early. You were late. The river is different when no one is singing to it.\n\nShe typed the first thing that came, which was not the smartest thing and not the dumbest. She wrote, You can stop now. The answer came as if it had been written in advance and set to a timer to make her feel small. It read, That sentence never stops being funny when it comes from people like you.\n\nShe left the ledgers open because closing them felt like erasing something. She set the bookmark down like a small promise. She moved back through the library and the pillars and did not, because she was trying very hard to act like a person others would not need to rescue, go into the alcove. She would go later, with Noah, with a light and a rope and an agreement about how long to wait. The thing she could do today was go to J. Rey\u2019s dorm and not ruin a college student because some adult had decided to make a story that pleased them.\n\nJuliana Rey opened her door with reluctance and hair in rebellion. Her room had a cello case leaning in the corner like an older sister. Her roommate had had the good sense to go elsewhere. Poin showed badge and hands-not-a-threat and asked if the student had lost a metronome. The girl, who had the face that people invent when they think of serious young women, said, \u201cThey said not to bother. Ms. Armitage said it would show up in a closet with the old stands.\u201d She half-grinned, the kind of grin people deploy when they are aware of adults\u2019 propensity to minimize their losses. \u201cWhy do you care about forty dollars.\u201d\n\nPoin told her the truth and then the bigger, lonelier truth. She said, \u201cBecause someone who wants attention wants you to see the path they made. If I ignore the metronome, I let them think they can make any path and we\u2019ll pretend they didn\u2019t. If I follow it, I make them decide whether they really wanted me to be right behind them.\u201d Juliana considered that and then said, \u201cThere was a woman here last week. Ten minutes after my practice slot, she was in the hall, or the hall refused to be empty and she was the shape it made. I thought she was a parent. She watched me sign out. She asked me if anyone knew my schedule. It made me mad; then it made me feel like a kid. I told her to ask the office. She said she already had.\u201d\n\nPoin stayed in the doorway until she had a sense of the girl that would make her useful later but not so much that she\u2019d become a figure in Poin\u2019s own ledger. The cello case\u2019s latches had been polished by long use. On the desk a diary sat open because the young sometimes trust the world to be better than it is. Poin didn\u2019t read words that weren\u2019t her business. She noted the handwriting: left tilt, right tilt, the way adolescent alphabets learn to switch masks. She thanked Juliana and did not use her first name because it would have been an intimacy she could not afford. In the hall she listened to distant practice and of course someone was playing a melody that wanted to be ballet, but it wasn\u2019t Giselle, it was something more obvious, and so she let herself unclench for half a breath.\n\nNight decided to arrive early like a guest who had nowhere else to be. The ADA, all careful hair and careful speech wrapped around a human who had chosen a difficult job for reasons Poin could respect on certain days, cornered her by the elevator and repeated the chosen phrases of the week: community, patience, trust. Poin nodded and said, \u201cWe are not here to turn this into a duel,\u201d in a tone that suggested that she had already heard the headline where someone chose to treat the city like a boxing ring. The ADA put a hand on her forearm in a way that would have been solidarity in a different world. \u201cCareful,\u201d the ADA said. \u201cPeople like to throw rope to heroes and then tighten it.\u201d\n\nAt home, the apartment met her with the stale breath of a place that had held a stranger. She stood outside her own door for long enough to count to twelve and then made another decision. She called her neighbor, Mrs. Liu, ninety-three and sharper than her knives, and asked if she would like to come stand in Poin\u2019s kitchen and tell Poin if anything had been moved. Mrs. Liu arrived in slippers that had seen more of the world than their fabric advertised and a cardigan with pearls that had decided to stay with it out of love, not duty. She sniffed and frowned and went to the window and tapped the toy sword with a finger as if to make it announce itself. \u201cYou left your bowl wrong,\u201d Mrs. Liu said. \u201cYou always leave it inside the sink. Today it\u2019s on the counter like you want to pretend you didn\u2019t dirty it. Very silly.\u201d She pointed at a chair. \u201cAnd you left the chair not how you leave your chair. You like the scrape. Today there is no scrape. You were not alone or you were not you. Have soup. You look like a person who would believe anything if they thought it would stop a headache.\u201d\n\nPoin ladled soup from a container because saying no to Mrs. Liu once had felt like she was slapping a statue of a saint. She ate it and felt her jaw stop clicking for three minutes. She showed Mrs. Liu the note on the counter and Mrs. Liu said, \u201cChildish handwriting of an adult. Or the other way around. We can find out which if you give me a pen and a person.\u201d That made Poin bark a laugh that hurt and helped. After Mrs. Liu left, carrying half her own soup back up to the land of plants and radio programs, Poin stood in the middle of the room and said her own first and last name out loud to see if it felt like a thing someone else could wear. It did and it didn\u2019t. Her phone made the whale noise she had set for Noah because a joke had to live somewhere.\n\nHe had something that prickled and soothed at once. \u201cRan your coat guy,\u201d he said over a connection that turned his voice into an older radio. \u201cThe balsa-wood handsome? He is a man who does not exist and nevertheless owed a library late fee in 2009. Name attached to the card: Evan Jeffer, which sounds fake. The address attached was a building they knocked down in 2013 to make a dog park. His face refuses to settle itself for the software. Looks like a person who studied how to be not seen and then had the courage to be boring about it. He is on six cameras and then he isn\u2019t. I took apart the vent cover and got yelled at by a person whose job is to yell when you take apart vent covers. There is dust inside that has stories, and in the dust we have a smear that wants to be glove latex. He is glove careful. He is exactly as careful as someone who reads blogs about himself and thinks everyone else is the audience.\u201d\n\n\u201cGlove latex says he bleeds or expects to touch something that does,\u201d Poin said, and she could hear Noah nod through the static. She told him not to go back alone and he lied politely, which meant he understood her and would ignore her. She planned in the back of her head to go break into the library after three a.m. and be a hypocrite in the service of something larger. She put this plan on the mental shelf where plans sit and hum until the body permits them to be carried out. The blog posted again at nine thirty, because of course it did, because the blog had learned from a city\u2019s hunger how to feed it without ever using a spoon. The post was short and contemptuous of shortness at the same time. It read:\n\nOrder is an invention. Everyone pretends it existed first. My house had rules because it didn\u2019t, and your house does too. I am patient with your panic. I have tried on your names for me and they do not fit. When I say ledger I mean a story that remembers. When I say boy I mean a person who was allowed a map and told the town was his field. When I say inside your walls I mean the place where your masks sleep.\n\nCaswell sent, simply, \u201cChrist,\u201d because curses sometimes were prayers where there had been no room for prayer. The ADA texted, \u201cWe need to say something,\u201d and then immediately texted again, \u201cWe need to say less,\u201d which was funny if you were the kind of person who let things be funny. Poin typed nothing. She turned the toy sword on and let its pathetic glow be the only light in the room for the count of twelve. The radiators in the building woke as if they had been given a second shift without warning. Someone below her put on a record, and of course it was a violin and of course it was not quite in tune and of course it was perfect for a night that didn\u2019t know what to call itself. She wrote three lines in a notebook, her right hand steady, her left hand curious. She noticed, with that clean attention she liked to remember to use on herself, that she wanted to hook her g again and that she could choose not to. She chose not to on purpose once and then chose to again because she didn\u2019t like the feeling of erasure that came with correcting.\n\nThe river before dawn the next day had teeth. Poin stood on the bridge again because she had decided she did not like being told where to stand, and sometimes the only way to reassert ownership of your body was to put it in a place someone thinks they own. A shadow moved and it was not hers; she felt it and then she saw it, a person in a tan coat like the bridge had given birth to him. He did that easy posture thing again, hands visible, as if he had been taught once the way to not frighten horses. His mouth made the show of an almost-smile a man will use to ask for sugar in a diner. \u201cDetective Poin,\u201d he said, and his voice sat in the air without hurrying its own end. \u201cDid you sleep. You don\u2019t look like you slept.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou remind me of a lesson,\u201d she said, and she didn't even try to cut the weird out of her words. \u201cAbout how ghosts are just people who learned not to cast a shadow where the light wants one. Tell me your name and we can stop pretending we aren\u2019t both playing a part.\u201d\n\nHe looked at the water as if it might answer for him. He lifted his hand as if to touch the railing and then did not, and she saw the rope scar again ghost under skin, the white thin of it like a seam. He said, \u201cI can tell you something true and it will not be useful. I am here because the river makes nonsense behave for a minute. I am also here because you are predictable and so am I.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou were at the church,\u201d she said, because leaving the obvious unsaid was a strategy for people who wanted to be in love with their own cleverness. \u201cYou check your phone while kneeling. Your head tilts like you learned it from a mirror. You hide from cameras like you wrote a guide.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hide from cameras because they don\u2019t love me,\u201d he said, and there was something childish and offensive in it at once. \u201cIf you catch me, Detective, it will be because I decide to set down the rope the same minute you decide to pick it up. I hope when we get there neither of us is bored.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome of us would like to prevent a murder,\u201d she said. She realized her hand had reached for a thing that wasn\u2019t on her hip because certain movements are drills that the body rehearses without permission. He noticed her noticing and his mouth did something that had probably once charmed someone. He said, \u201cThen prevent it,\u201d and by the time she said, \u201cDon\u2019t leave,\u201d he had obeyed physics and not her, and his back was already committing to the walk that took you off the bridge and into the city\u2019s harder rooms.\n\nShe did not chase him because there were six ways to die on a bridge if you let your anger be in charge. She went to the south bend because the blog had liked the word tonight and she wanted to preemptively hate whatever it had planned. The water carried a dusting of broken mirror where the thin ice fractured and reknit. She leaned out too far and let herself be afraid with her whole body for one second so that the fear would be a thing she could swallow. The metronome\u2019s tick had stopped because they had taken it away. The silence didn\u2019t fill the space so much as keep it; that was a lesson she had learned from rooms where people pray and rooms where people confess and rooms where people die.\n\nNoah met her at the south bend with a wool hat that had been his sister\u2019s and a grin that belonged to a different hour. \u201cYou\u2019re going to love this,\u201d he said, because his joy in the work was made of some material that did not degrade under pressure. \u201cYou asked about the stub in the blog draft. I assumed she only made that mistake once. She made it twice. It\u2019s like the part of her that is neat has a cousin that gets bored and chews curtains. We have a second partial, same network bounce, different time. I cross-checked with the building\u2019s badge swipes because I like being fired, and I promise you I will get fired later for this in a spectacular fashion, and we have a cluster of three that make sense. Three people in the building who used guest wi-fi while here with their badge on the day of the presser. People forget their own rules when the room is loud. I can show you a list. You will hate one name.\u201d\n\n\u201cGive me the list,\u201d she said, and he gave it to her and she hated a name on it that belonged to her, because she had in fact hopped off the secure network when the lobby jammed, because she had in fact told herself it was simpler than wrangling with the department\u2019s own fussy gate, because she had in fact allowed convenience to be louder than paranoia for half a minute. She saw another name that belonged to Stills because the fern had been checking football scores in between playing good cop and plant. She saw another that belonged to Armitage because Armitage had posted a flier to the school board forum in a moment between running the office and something else. Noah put a thumb on the page by a fourth name that had no corresponding badge but had logged into the guest network long enough to be counted: Jermain Park, a temp who had been brought in to help with crowd control, whose temp agency address was a P.O. box in a building that hadn\u2019t existed since the last mayor had promised to get serious about rats. Noah said, \u201cYou like that I learned to love boring things.\u201d\n\nShe put a finger to her own name on the sheet, because you name your own guilt or it names you. \u201cThis,\u201d she said, gently, like the time in high school when she had spoken to the child of a drunk teacher and told him a truth in a hallway and watched it land like an egg that would hatch later. Noah said, \u201cI know. You were on guest because it\u2019s faster and your phone stops nagging you. I can read your soul like a system log.\u201d He tapped the \u201ctemp\u201d name. \u201cThis is the index card I want to follow under the door with a string attached.\u201d\n\nThey followed it. It took them to a warehouse of cheap offices papered in signs that said words like solutions and synergy in fonts that had made bad men rich. The receptionist had the enviable lack of interest of someone who has learned that secrets are only of value to the people who don\u2019t deserve them. The temp company\u2019s owner had a ring whose stone would have knocked a person out if deployed correctly. He insisted his staff were not criminals until Poin told him she was not saying they were, and then he insisted that if they were, it was only because the city had forced them to be. They found the name on a roster. They found a photo attached to it that was not Evan Jeffer and not their bridge man and not any man Poin had ever seen. They found that Jermain Park had been on assignment somewhere else the day of the presser and that his timesheet had been signed by a person whose signature had been practiced by someone using their left hand on a moving bus. The owner tried to sell Poin a staffing plan. Noah smiled at him like a boy playing with a knife and watched the older man\u2019s eyes clock the thing he could not figure out how to fear.\n\nAt dusk, the church on Ryal made a sound like wood trying not to remember fire. Poin went there not because the letter had asked but because the letter had offered a room where she could hear how her own feet hit the floor. The old woman with the candle had returned as if assigned to the place by a god who likes symmetry. Poin sat in the pew where she had sat before and made herself sit without calculation for the time it takes to boil an egg. She held the phone where she couldn\u2019t read it and waited for the idea to stop roaring. A man in the back coughed twice and then stopped because of shame. Outside, the river remembered ice. Inside, the statue of Jesus continued to be assembled from other Jesuses and be unbothered by it. When she stood, a small scrap of paper slid off the hymnal shelf as if it had been saved for her by a mischievous altar boy long since dead. It said, in a hand that leaned left, Bring the sword.\n\nShe took the plastic toy to the library because it was absurd and therefore exactly the right instrument for a night like that. Noah rolled his eyes at her until she explained and then he rolled them differently, the way someone does when they have to admit your weirdness and their respect have become one thing. They went into the staff hallway after hours because Halladay had blessed them with a look that said if you die here I will be annoyed but not surprised. They brought a light and a real rope and a second person waiting at the door with the same name as Caswell but a different shape. The vent had the fresh metal tang of new paint and she could see fingerprints in the brushstrokes at the exact height of a person teaching themselves to hide. Noah unscrewed the cover because he claimed to have small hands, and he did, and the second person with Caswell\u2019s responsibility but not his tongue watched the hall with the half-sleeping attention of a parent at a playground. The duct was a throat and a lie. It let them crawl a yard and then it let them crawl three and then it let them choose left or right. The draft came from right, which meant that left had a secret or a dead end.\n\nShe went left because she had promised herself once in a room with calm hands that she would occasionally decline the obvious. The left ended in a small pocket the size of a confession with a flattened paper coffee cup and a pencil stub and a scrap of a schedule torn from a bulletin sheet. The schedule had the practice rooms listed. The pencil had teeth marks on it. She thought of Halladay\u2019s squeaking lead. She took the pencil without touching the teeth-mark end because some hygienic habits will finally take. She looked at the wall inside the pocket and saw someone had drawn a grid, small and precise, with enough lines to comfort themselves, enough columns to suggest a science. In a corner of the grid a word had been written and then erased and then written again in a different hand: attention. She did not pretend not to be moved.\n\nWhen she backed out of the duct she put the plastic sword in first as a joke to herself and also to have something to shove at a person if a person appeared. The sword whined and made its hideous child noise as it scraped and she thought, a person inside here would not be frightened by that sound because the joke would be obvious to them too. She came out dusty and sweating and Caswell\u2019s deputy gave her a look like she had committed a small crime against common sense. Noah came out and lifted a hand like a taxi. He said, \u201cI found the glove,\u201d and he had, a wadded thing tucked into the crease where dust turned to fur. It was blue, kitchen-grade, the kind a person would keep in a box under their sink if they were the kind of person who kept boxes under their sink. He held it in a bag that made a tiny crinkle like an indignity. He said, \u201cThere will be nothing on it. Or there will be a thing on it we will think is everything and later decide was nothing. I\u2019m showing it to you because you like objects to tell you when they lie.\u201d\n\nShe wanted to kiss him on the forehead like a saint and then punch herself for the thought. She handed him the pencil. He looked at the teeth marks, frowned in that slow serious way he had when the stupid world demanded a brilliant man use his full brain on something a squirrel would have solved, and said, \u201cOkay. This is a thing we can measure. Teeth marks are like snowflakes you can touch.\u201d He made a noise like someone apologizing to his own excitement and then he took the bag away like a person carrying a newborn with a criminal record.\n\nOn the way out of the library a group of students with midterms on their faces brushed past. One wore a scarf the exact blue Armitage had named. Poin did not flinch; she was training herself to not turn every color into a weapon. Outside, the night had decided on cold. The river took that decision and made it doctrine. Her phone had saved a message for when she returned aboveground. It said: It bothers you that you like the sword. It bothers you that you like your own name in other people\u2019s mouths. It bothers you that you can make yourself charming when you want to and that sometimes you do. It does not bother me. I do not need to lie to myself about what I am.\n\nShe typed, You are a person, which is the only category I care about, and the answer came with almost mechanical speed, which meant it had been sitting there, heavy on some finger, waiting. It said, I am a chorus. You know the feeling.\n\nShe did not answer because the thing you starve sometimes dies. She walked the long way home, past the warehouse mural where a woman with a wrench had been painted bigger than the sky, past the lot where the dog park had erased the temp agency\u2019s mailbox, past three windows in which televisions had made different rooms the same. She let herself in and checked the bowl and the chair like a woman devoted to ritual. The bowl was in the sink; the chair had its scrape. She put the toy sword on the table and thought it looked like a spine that had made bad choices. She set the pencil beside it in its small bag and the glove in its bigger bag and she wrote on a clean sheet in large letters with a pen she knew for a fact was hers: Who is us. She underlined the us because multiple is a word that disciplines itself better when kept on a leash. She ate bread dry and stood at the window and counted the lights of passing trains like a person counting their own bones. Somewhere under the river skin, a thing moved that was not merely water again, and she told herself that if she went out now she would be serving an appetite and not a need. She did not go.\n\nIn the morning the Chronicle put her face next to an artist\u2019s rendering of a faceless woman in a scarf, and the headline used the word ledger twice, which made something old and weary in Poin put its head on a desk. In the lab, Noah had set up a small shrine to teeth. He had taken photographs of bite patterns in gum he had made interns chew when they were bored and had printed out a cross-section of the pencil\u2019s little wounds. He played the radio too loud because it kept his brain from climbing out of his skull. He said, \u201cIf I ask you for a bite, that will be weird in a way that will later get me sent to training, right,\u201d and Poin said, \u201cAbsolutely. Let me go find a citizen we hate.\u201d They compromised by asking three officers and one janitor and a volunteer from the records department who loved science, then thrown what they learned against the grooves on the pencil and watched what stuck. Science would tell them later if the person who had chewed had been a woman who took her anger out on harmless wood or a man who did the same; science would tell them later they were bigots for asking that question. For now, Noah loved the data, even if later he would have to confess to the data that he had used it like a drunk uses a lamppost, for support and not illumination.\n\nA body surfaced at the north bend at dusk. It was not a boy from the river bars and it was not a boy at all. It was a man who had been dead long enough to make days a joke. The river had tucked him in and then changed its mind. His pockets had receipts from 2019 and a movie stub for a film that had been in love with its own meanness. His neck had nothing to tell the report. Caswell said, \u201cIt\u2019s a decoy,\u201d and then hated himself for saying decoy about a person who had once had a breakfast routine. The blog did not post. The silence felt like a loving hand holding the mouth. Poin looked at the dead and looked at the city and made herself say, in her head and then out loud to the quietest wall she owned, that she would not let the ledger be only one person\u2019s math. She went to her desk and found that the anonymous letter-writer from Ryal had sent another page, this one without perfume, which for some reason moved her more. It said, The floorboards know the names. If you bring chalk, they will tell you where to stand. It added, Does this make me an accessory, and then, with a small unfunny smile drawn by the word, I am not joking, and then, Please.\n\nShe bought chalk as if she were a child walking to recess. She put it in her pocket and felt it grind into a line of dust under her knuckles. She didn\u2019t tell anyone. She shouldn\u2019t have gone alone. She went anyway. The church was empty of candles and heavy with wood. The floorboards in front of the fourth pew from the back had scratches not made by furniture. She took the chalk out and felt that stupid sense you get when you know you are playing by somebody else\u2019s rules and you hate them and you want to see them anyway. She drew a line where the scratches had suggested. She stood on it. The way sound traveled through the room changed. The air had a weakness there, a patch. She knelt and pressed her cheek to the wood the way a child will when listening for trains. Under the floor, the soft sound of paper was not a metaphor. She went to get a crowbar because some wrongs deserve violence. She told herself there would be a note and that she should not read it if it existed. She told herself she would.\n\nIt took two men and a whisper to get the board up because you don\u2019t hurt a church without apologizing to someone, even if that someone is you. Under the board there was a small wrapped package, no bigger than a hand. Ms. Liu would have had a word about the choice of paper and about the way the tape had been folded. Poin held it like an egg and opened it like a bomb. Inside were pages torn from a spiral notebook, blue lines tight as ribs. On the top page, in a handwriting that leaned left and then corrected itself without self-hate, a list of names lived. The first three were the boys they had already found. The fourth was a man whose name she did not know yet and would learn in thirty minutes when the call came from Fernley Street about a young man who had been expected home and was not. The fifth was not a boy at all. It was a woman\u2019s name. It was hers. She felt her face do the thing an animal\u2019s does when it stands too close to a fence built by a person who likes animals in theory. She turned the next page and saw the ledger drawn in pencil with the sweetness of a child\u2019s fantasies: date, time, balance. In the corner, a word written and erased and written again as if someone had stood here asking themselves permission. The word was attention.\n\nHer phone rang with someone else\u2019s panic and then with her own, a second later. She put the chalk in her pocket because if you don\u2019t collect the pieces it looks like you meant to drop them. She said to the room like a person who has decided to stop asking for consent, \u201cEnough,\u201d and the room did not answer because rooms don\u2019t owe you anything. She went to get her coat that the stranger had worn and hung up exactly the way she would have hung it and she put it on and she went to work to be boring and true, and the city, because it could not help itself, rearranged its shadows to suit.",

                              "content": "The call from Fernley Street arrived while the chalk dust still pressed its pale thumb into the seam of her pocket and the ledger pages she had lifted from under the church floorboards lay facedown in an evidence sleeve she\u2019d sealed with her own shaking hands. Caswell\u2019s voice was thin with the effort of making itself smaller for a grieving house. A young man, last seen near the bus stop by the laundromat, shoes left by the mat as if he planned to put them on again in an hour, phone unanswered since dusk. His mother said his name three different ways as if one of them might draw him back. Poin told Internal Affairs about the find at Ryal because that was the line she would not cross; she gave Lott the pages under a camera and said the word church without apology, and she did not explain why she had chalk on her sleeve because sometimes explaining is just a way to invite someone else\u2019s version of you to take root. She texted Caswell that she was on her way and then texted Noah with a single word, ledger, because everything had begun to feel like a dare and she trusted him not to waste the fat under the dare with the wrong kind of excitement.\n\nFernley Street had that Roseville posture she knew by heart, two-story rows with porches that had looked at better winters without flinching, Christmas lights left up in January because you have to let the glow be stubborn a little longer when your hands are tired. The missing boy\u2019s mother had scrubbed her kitchen into a church, lemon and hot water, a scent so clean it almost made Poin suspicious of what else had lived there all day. The boy\u2019s name was Ezra Morales and on the fridge was a scholarship letter with a magnet that said YOU GOT THIS with the kind of optimism Poin had not owned at eighteen and tried not to resent in others now. Ezra\u2019s sister sat on the stairs with her face in a book she wasn\u2019t reading. There was a cat who pretended not to care and cared like a barn on fire. Caswell stood by the sink and made himself small, the trick he did when the room needed to believe the police were a pair of hands and not a fist. Poin bent to the calendar because calendars tell truths houses forget they told, and saw his work schedule with shifts at a smoothie place that paid in smoothies and disappointment, and a practice note for Kunstler Hall scrawled two days back with a smiley face after it because there are still places in the world where practice makes anyone smile.\n\n\u201cHe left for the bus,\u201d Ezra\u2019s mother said, gripping the back of a chair the way a person grips the edges of a dream to keep from sliding out. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t cut. He doesn\u2019t avoid. He doesn\u2019t have time to be bad. He\u2019s a good boy, Detective. He helps his aunt with her stairs because her knees won\u2019t listen. He called me from the river once to say the ice sounded like whales and I told him, mijo, don\u2019t be silly, and I wish I had said, yes, whales, and listened longer.\u201d\n\nPoin asked the small questions because the small questions are the only ones that let the big ones breathe. Which coat. Which shoes. Which friend. Which bus. She watched the mother\u2019s hands, the way the fingers paused when they touched the chair where the varnish had worn down to memory, and she watched the sister\u2019s eyes in the guard of her bangs and saw something like anger that had been taught to behave. Caswell took notes low, not because he needed them low but because it made his pen seem less like a needle and more like a bandage. The phone on the counter lit green and dark, green and dark, with messages from classmates stacking into a building of worry. Poin felt the ledger pages against her ribs like a nervous heartbeat and wished they were not touching her at all.\n\nNoah sent a ping at the same hour the mother said the word scarf as if she had never cared about a scarf in her life until now. The blog had moved again; the backend showed a draft saved and overwritten from a device that had danced the same idiot dance through the guest network as before. He had a timestamp and a block of footage to check. He wrote, The draft says balance tonight and the word reconcile, which is a nothing word and a everything word. He added, You should eat the rest of those peanuts or I will invent an allergy for you and make you carry an EpiPen just to give your day a new anxiety. She smiled at the kitchen tile like a person who has been told a joke during a wake and needs to put it somewhere safe.\n\nEzra\u2019s girlfriend arrived half-breathless with a coat tied around her waist and a face that looked like she had been trying not to cry in public and had failed. She said he had been practicing something hard and that he had put his phone away on purpose because he had a rule about paying attention with his whole body. She said a woman had asked him once, in the lobby of Kunstler, if he thought order was a made thing or a found thing, and he had said made, because he had learned that the only beautiful things he had in his hands were the ones he put there. She said the woman\u2019s voice had sounded like a textbook read in a warm room. Poin asked without looking at Caswell whether anyone had reported a stranger in the building in a gray coat and a blue scarf; Caswell looked back without looking like he was looking and lifted his chin a millimeter. Armitage had called to say the scarf woman had returned twice this week and stood by the bulletin board as if waiting for a clock to tell her when she was real.\n\nThe bus stop camera gave them a slosh of strangers and the small confessions of winter: hands inside sleeves, shoulders wearing their most stubborn angles. Ezra got on a bus he always got on and got off two stops later where a shortcut cut behind the old bakery and spat you out by the river if you weren\u2019t careful. He walked with the slightly theatrical gait of a person with earbuds in, except he did not have earbuds. He turned his head once like he\u2019d heard his name even though nobody near him had a mouth open. Behind him, a tan coat drifted into frame, and then the camera did its blameless blink because a snowflake hit the lens and the world became a beautiful circle and then a normal rectangle again and the tan coat had learned a lesson about physics and vanished to the left.\n\nPoin went looking because attention is a muscle and hers needed to be used while it still believed in her. She took Caswell and two uniforms and Noah because Noah didn\u2019t know how to make himself stay, and she told herself that bringing them was both protection for them and for her, which was a lie with a grain of salt in it to make it more human. Kunstler Hall\u2019s evening staff had the wary gait of people who have become unwilling curators of a museum the city has decided is haunted. Armitage handed over the sign-in logs with the pleasure of a woman whose system had been proven worth its ink. Room 213 was booked to a J. REY at noon and an E. MORALES at six, and there was a blank where six had been signed out, a small absent square that made Poin think of teeth in an old man\u2019s smile. The custodian with the splinter scar said, \u201cThe third-floor bathrooms have soap again,\u201d in a tone that made the room want to applaud. Poin put her ear to the door of 213 without touching it and heard the old triangle of a metronome because rhythm will insist on itself in all the worst moments. The sound ticked like someone making a joke in a language you resent knowing.\n\nShe used her body like a lens. The door had fresh paint around the knob that did not match the rest\u2014a lazy patch that meant someone had filled a hole with putty and pretended the world wouldn\u2019t notice. There was a smudge at knee height that could have been a shoe or a life. The air under the threshold had a cold seam like a room had been breathing that didn\u2019t expect to be caught at it. She put her palm flat on the wood and felt a slickness that was not her own sweat. \u201cTrap,\u201d she said, and Noah, to his credit, did not push forward to see the trap, he only tipped his chin and asked, \u201cWhere,\u201d like he was ordering lunch. She crouched, looked again at the patch. The hinges sang a tired song, the kind hinges sing when they have been asked to be subtle for once and hate it. She nodded at the uniforms to back off a hair; Caswell did his saint-or-fool look again and stayed where he could be both a wall and a floor mat, whatever the room required. She touched the knob with a glove and turned without pushing. The latch gave with the softness of a person telling you a secret they don\u2019t intend to keep. She set the plastic sword\u2019s green worse-than-light on the floor because a different light changes how traps decide to behave. The green spilled under the door\u2019s belly and painted the room a sick hue that made even the dust consider its options.\n\nShe didn\u2019t open. She put her shoulder to the jamb at the hinge side and inhaled. A rope doesn\u2019t have to be visible to be true; it has to be felt in the way a door resists and yields. She pushed a fraction harder than was polite. The door pulled back as if it had a thought about pulling forward. Somewhere at the top edge a line tightened and hummed. Somewhere in the room a chair scraped, the soft wood scream of a furniture leg dragged by a purpose. She looked up and traced where a rope would live if she were the person who wanted the drama without the mess, a loop over the top corner to a hook that probably used to hold a plant when the room was briefly a lounge in 1983. The rope would have gone to the chair. The chair would have gone to a body. She could see the shadow of it in the green. She took the narrow pry bar Noah had brought with the duct kit because he knows how to love her in ways he will never understand and she slid it under the base and lifted a whisper. The rope tensed like a held breath. She hit the jamb with her palm twice and let the door swing, and the rope took all the stupid theater\u2019s weight in one dramatic cough and snapped its knot where she had hoped it would, where the plant hook had rusted on the inside of its threads. The chair moved and did not fall. The metronome fell and did not break because some things refuse to perform for you in the ways you think you deserve.\n\nEzra Morales was in the chair with the rope looped around his neck not tight enough to injure and so tight it made a liar out of every parent who says the world will be kind to you if you are kind to it. His hands were bound in front the way one binds a person you intend to untie yourself while saying something poetic about mercy. His eyes were open and they did the thing that eyes do when they have seen the ocean come up over them and then go back. Poin put her palm on his cheek because touch is a technology the city cannot regulate, and she said his name like she was taking his attendance and he was not late. Caswell did a careful ugly dance with the rope at the back, undoing a knot that had been tied with a good scout\u2019s pride, and Noah took the metronome and clicked it off and then looked at his own hand like he had struck a beloved animal and now had to deal with the feeling. The rope had left a pink half-moon under Ezra\u2019s jaw; Poin had to do the work not to see it on every boy she had ever watched walk by the river like they owned it because living requires that you let people own their walking.\n\n\u201cThere was a woman,\u201d Ezra said, and everybody\u2019s lungs exhaled a theatrical amount of relief they would deny later. He said the word woman with the broadness of someone who has not been given vocabulary to discuss the space between costume and person. \u201cShe said she needed me to sit because she wanted to show me something and she said it was a trick, not a hurt. She smelled like peppermint and something like old paper. She called me by my first and last name. She was not angry. She was so not angry she made me angry.\u201d\n\n\u201cFace,\u201d Caswell said, gentle like a man talking to a witness and a person in pain at once, and Ezra made an apologetic gesture with his bound hands the way people do when their brain is trying to be good at its own story. Scarf, blue. Coat, gray. Hands, gloved. Voice like something recited and loved. Eyes? He said he couldn\u2019t say because he hadn\u2019t wanted to look long; the human animal knows when an animal wants to be watched. She had said, \u201cNot yet,\u201d when he asked her what the point was, and then she had tied him with a competence that was nurse or sailor or mother. She had stepped back and looked at him the way a person looks at a painting they\u2019ve decided to hang. Then she had left, and the metronome had ticked like a scolding grandmother until Noah clicked it quiet. Ezra began to cry only when Poin asked him the smallest question, whether he had had dinner, and he said \u201cno\u201d the way people say \u201cforgive me.\u201d\n\nThey got him to the EMTs and kept the ledger pages off the kitchen tables and the television cameras. Lott showed up at Kunstler because he lives in his car when the city does not behave, and his jaw did that unfortunate thing again when he saw the rope mark and the hook and the way the room had been dressed for a play it did not consent to perform. \u201cGrandstanding,\u201d he said in a voice that wanted to be tired and decided to be grim instead. \u201cShe wants the room to remember her like an alumni donor.\u201d He looked at Poin as if he wanted to ask her if she felt personally moved by the theater and then had the good sense to decide that was a question he didn\u2019t deserve to ask.\n\nNoah brought her the toy sword as if he were handing a surgeon her lucky ring. \u201cYour text,\u201d he said, tapping her phone\u2019s dark screen where there was nothing and everything, \u201cabout balance? She had a draft open again. She typed reconcile and then deleted it. She wrote ledger three times and erased two. She wrote \u2018not a ghost\u2019 and kept it. She is writing in the city\u2019s voice and it is making her drunk. Also, please note that the peppermint smell could be Ms. Armitage or every grandmother we\u2019ve ever loved.\u201d\n\nArmitage stood in the hall with her lanyard like a medal and her hair like a promise and said, \u201cIt\u2019s not me,\u201d in a tone so articulate with professional insult and love for her building that it could have been framed. She told Poin that the word reconcile has lived in her office longer than most freshmen and it did no harm there. She asked Ezra quietly, privately, if he wanted a candy and waited for him to decide. Poin watched the boy take a peppermint and place it under his tongue like a sacrament and she had to walk into the stairwell and let herself choose not to cry.\n\nThe blog did not post for an hour, and then it did, and the city inhaled like a crowd at a magic show the second before the trap door opens and the dove is either alive or not. It read:\n\nYou do not understand what mercy is. Mercy is not the absence of action; it is the precise application of the minimum required to teach the lesson. He will remember the rope like a signature and that is enough. The net result is improved. I am not hiding. I am inside the places you say are yours. I am copying from your books. Some of you will learn. The rest of you will be reconciled by other means.\n\nPoin read it twice without leaning on any words and then a third time tracing only the verbs as if they were tracks through light snow. Teach, remember, improve, hiding, copying, learn, reconciled. She could hear Stills in the next room trying to say something about pathology without sounding like he had learned it from television. Lott\u2019s radio burped the names of three city council members who had decided to make mercy a political football before dawn. Caswell said, \u201cShe\u2019s going to escalate,\u201d in the tone of a man saying the stove is hot while watching someone else put their hand on it anyway.\n\nNoah put the pencil photographs in front of her like flowers a child brings that he knows are weeds but loves anyway. He had his bite overlay, his little armory of comparisons, his hypothesis that the teeth belonged to a jaw that had been set tightly by someone who learned to wear their anger like a retainer. He said the marks were small and deep; he said the pattern suggested a person who smiled without showing upper incisors, which is a silly thing to claim, which made it feel truer. He said they could narrow it and then he shrugged the shrug of a priest who knows the gods have their own appointments. He added, as if he were embarrassed by his own competence, that the guest network at the building had recorded another ghost, a device that had appeared long enough to be counted and then gone, a pattern that was becoming the shape of their week.\n\nPoin went home because she had promised Lott she would let someone walk her places that were not murder rooms and also because her body needed to be held up by walls it knew. Mrs. Liu met her in the hallway with a dish towel in one hand and a disdain for the entire concept of killers in the other. \u201cYou look like a rug,\u201d Mrs. Liu said, which somehow meant that Poin was invited to sit and be scolded with soup. The apartment had been cleaned by nobody but her own tired hands; the bowl was in the sink where it belonged; the chair had its scrape like a signature; the toy sword lay on the table where she had left it as a dare to herself. On the counter, where the note had been the night before, was only a square of clean where paper had rested long enough to keep dust away. She put the ledger copy on the table and read her own name again, written in a hand that belonged to either someone she did not know or someone she knew too well. She wrote \u201cNo\u201d next to it because you are allowed small rituals of defiance in the privacy of your own kitchen, and then she wrote \u201cAttention\u201d under it because she needed to see the word she had built her life on, an anchor that would hold her against the current of somebody else\u2019s story.\n\nSleep came in slices and not the good kind. In the piece where she stood at the bridge the tan coat man put his hands in the air and they turned into gulls; in the piece where she sat in church the floor whispered a different word than attention and she woke before she could hear it. She dreamed she had two mouths and one of them kept eating the other\u2019s words. At three in the morning she woke with the idiot certainty that she had left the door undone and got up to check the deadbolt, which was unhelpfully, perfectly locked. She found a hat she did not own on the hook with her scarf again and told the hat, out loud, that she would discuss it later. When she slept the last time before the alarm, the river did not come; there was only a dry creek bed with coins in it and a sign that said LEDGER in black marker leaning against a rock. She woke laughing once, a bark that hurt her throat, and decided to be grateful that her body remembered how to make any joy at all.\n\nThe morning punched her with headlines. The Chronicle had placed a quote of hers next to a silhouette of a woman holding a ledger like a prayer book; a blogger had made a collage of her plastic sword and three separate murder instruments and called it a comment on American policing; a city radio host had decided the week\u2019s theme was mercy and punishment and had called in a theologian who said you cannot make mercy into arithmetic without murdering the word. She let the words pass by like trains she was not obligated to board. Noah had left her a voicemail because he, too, occasionally believed in old technologies. He said, \u201cThe bite marks aren\u2019t Armitage\u2019s and they aren\u2019t yours and they aren\u2019t mine even though I was prepared to be accused, and when I tried to match them to our library ghost man we did not get a match because that is not how matching works, but also because we do not have his teeth. I found a partial on a coffee cup abandoned in the duct that I will now go to hell for picking up with my hands, and it is different in exactly the way that makes stories live too long. Be careful. I do not like how close the vents are to anything you would call a person.\u201d He paused, as if his own mouth had to make a decision before it said the next thing, and then added, \u201cI had a dream you taught me scales until my hands stopped shaking. I don\u2019t even play anything. Interpret that however creates the fewest problems.\u201d\n\nShe went to Internal Affairs because she had promised to be boring and true, and she told Lott about the ledger in the church and everything except the way the word attention had made her feel like a person given their own name for the first time after a long sentence. Stills tried to be outraged about the floorboard until Lott gave him a look that suggested perhaps his priorities could be rearranged. Lott said, \u201cShe put your name under glass,\u201d which was not a thing Poin needed put into words by anyone but her and yet here it was, a phrase taking up chair space in the conference room. He offered her, of all things, a peppermint, and she took it because refusing a peppermint in front of a person who believes in the law of small helps felt like a sin she couldn\u2019t afford. He told her she would not be walking around alone and looked like he wanted her to argue so he could feel useful when she inevitably lost. She did not give him the argument. She asked for the list of graveyards nobody had touched in a decade and he laughed without humor and gave it to her because the strangest requests are often the least dangerous.\n\nThe river made its own weather that afternoon and buried three sirens at once without effort. Ezra\u2019s girlfriend texted to say he had eaten and slept and then cried again because relief is rude to the body. Armitage sent a photograph of the plant hook dated by some office camera that ran when the building was otherwise unobserved, the hook old and untouched last month and polished by a hand this week. Halladay from the library forwarded an email from a patron complaining about squeaky pencils, CC-ing Poin with a wink. Mrs. Liu knocked once on Poin\u2019s door with a walking stick and told her that people who hang their coats the way Poin hangs her coats cannot be trusted to kill anyone good, which was an imperfect comfort and thus perfect.\n\nAt dusk, the blog turned sly again, shorter this time, the sentences clipped the way someone clipper-cuts their hair to feel in control. It read:\n\nLedger entry: one boy corrected without loss. Ledger entry: one metronome returned. Ledger entry: one detective slowed down by courtesy. Balance: still too far in the red. If you want to find me, you will have to admit how many of your walls have doors you do not lock.\n\nNoah wrote, Doors, and sent a flood of lock images until her phone gave up trying to display them at once. Caswell called just to breathe in her ear like a brother and say, \u201cYou\u2019re not allowed to be a line item,\u201d and hang up because sometimes friendship is as stupid as rope and twice as useful. Poin went to the bridge not because she thought the river would finally tell her a story that made sense but because there are only so many rooms a body can do its waiting in before the walls start to insist you are the wrong shape.\n\nThe tan coat man was there again like a bad decision that insists on being charming. He stood with his hands on the rail in the approved position of men who want to look like they have nothing to hide and maybe even believe it. His mouth shaped her name as if he were tasting weather. He said, \u201cDo you like how she lets boys go?\u201d in a voice that could have sold towels. She said, \u201cI like boys living,\u201d and watched the small flicker he didn\u2019t intend to show, that almost-grief that lives under contempt in certain men. He said, \u201cYou found the church,\u201d and she said, \u201cYou were there,\u201d because they had both given up pretending to be spectral. He did that neck-stretch again and the white line made itself known in the last of the light, and for one reckless second she imagined laying her index finger along that seam and feeling whether the skin remembered hurt or only the shape of a lesson. She put her hand on the rail instead. He said, \u201cIt\u2019s almost the end of the first act,\u201d like a person who had paid too much attention to a lecture once and never got over it. She let him walk away because whatever she could do to him on a bridge in the twilight would be more about her than him, and she had decided the ledger needed different math.\n\nThat night she laid out her notebooks on the floor like lures. She wrote three lines on each, alternating her hands without hiding it from herself, a practice instead of a feint. She wrote the word attention until it felt like it could be said in a courtroom without becoming a farce. She set the toy sword on the windowsill for the childish bravery of it and because the green made the glass look like the river had come up to watch her sleep. She put the pencil with the small angry teeth marks in the center of the circle like a totem. She told the ceiling the plan she did not yet have because some things need to be said out loud before they will let themselves exist. When the trains rolled past like whales remembering salt, she curled around the smallest part of her and tried not to let her own name feel like a threat. She woke with the answer plastered against her teeth like a word she\u2019d been trying not to say. She would stop trying to catch a ghost in her own walls. She would set a table in the one room she knew the ghost loved, and she would invite her with the only invitation that made sense to a person who lived on order and staging: an appointment, written in a hand both familiar and unbearable, at a place that had learned to love metronomes and rules. She would take the thing that wanted attention and give it an audience she could control. She would bring the sword only if she was feeling unkind, and she would not be unkind. She would be boring. She would be true. And if a door she did not lock opened, she would be standing in its frame with both hands visible and all her names in her mouth.",

                              "content": "She did not write the appointment down where anyone official would see it. She wrote it on a small grid card with a pencil that didn\u2019t squeak, and she leaned left on purpose so the slant would be a confession only to those who knew her well enough to misunderstand. She left that card under the floorboard at Ryal where the chalk had told her to stand, a square of paper slid into a seam of wood the way a letter slides into a life. She didn\u2019t address it, because some messages already know their recipient. She wrote the room number and the hour and a word that had grown dangerous in her mouth: attention.\n\nArmitage, when Poin asked, did not ask why. She pulled ledger after ledger from behind the desk with the efficiency of a woman who understood that writing down names in the right place kept the world stitched. She booked 213 under a staff maintenance hold, which was the kind of lie the building would forgive. She walked Poin through the paneled belly of Kunstler like a docent guiding someone to a reliquary and then stopped in front of a closet that owed the city stories. \u201cWe can kill the hallway camera for fifteen minutes and call it a reboot,\u201d Armitage said without blinking. \u201cThe door to 213 sticks. If this goes wrong, no, it\u2019s already wrong, but if it goes loud, you bang here and the hinge will lie for you.\u201d\n\nNoah set his saints in a ring. He hated calling them that and loved it anyway. He brought three analog tape recorders that had cost twelve dollars each from a thrift shop run by Episcopal women who labeled every plug with masking tape and a date. He ran fresh cassettes and wound them with a pencil he refused to chew. He set a small film camera on a shelf because glass in light sees different lies than sensors. He checked the outlet for a kiss of current and then shook his head as he mated the recorder with a battery anyway, because he had learned the shape of the ghost\u2019s hand inside their walls. \u201cNo feeds,\u201d he said. \u201cNo network. If I see you try to text me, I throw your phone in the river and write an apology to your future biographer.\u201d\n\nCaswell did the job of worrying in a circle while pretending to straighten a poster about a winter choral concert. He tried to make her promise to keep the door open, and she said she would, and he looked at her like he loved her enough not to believe her. \u201cYou\u2019re not bait,\u201d he said, and she made the face she made when someone misnamed her. He looked at his boots, which had known bleachers and three wakes, and added, \u201cDon\u2019t make me tell your neighbor on you. She scares me.\u201d\n\nThey placed the toy sword on the piano\u2019s closed lid like a childish relic, not hidden and not entirely center, an object that someone who knew her would know she had placed there to say a thing words would make ugly. In that green the metronome\u2019s wood looked sick and somehow forgiven. Noah laughed under his breath once at the staging, and she elbowed him, and he took the blow like a benediction. He had slipped a small dictaphone under the bench with its little red eye held shut by tape, an old trick he\u2019d learned somewhere he liked to pretend he hadn\u2019t. He put the glove they found in the duct inside a clear box on the bookcase like a diorama in a child\u2019s museum. \u201cShe won\u2019t be able to keep her hands off her own outline,\u201d he said. \u201cAsk any stagehand what draws them.\u201d\n\nThe text from the unknown number did not come, and she hadn\u2019t decided what she\u2019d have done if it had. She didn\u2019t send one. She turned her phone off and put it in her bag and slipped the bag into Armitage\u2019s desk drawer under the peppermint bowl with the other polite contraband. The lobby sighed; the gutter outside found a rhythm; the train went from complaint to lullaby and back again in the space of a verse. Armitage said she would walk by on a loop that sounded natural, which was a lie equal to mercy. Noah stationed himself in the stairwell where the dead plant kept its faith and gave her a look like a boy whose mother had handed him a torch in a cave and said, \u201cStay.\u201d Caswell positioned a uniform down the hall and one at the back exit and a plainclothes by the elevator who looked like a faculty member if you didn\u2019t care about faculty.\n\nPoin went into the room alone because that was the point and not the point. She closed the door until it caught but left the latch floating, and she tested the hinge the way Armitage had showed her, the hinge giving its small betrayed whine. She sat on the piano bench with her knees where the varnish had been rubbed pale by a hundred other knees and let the metronome claim the air with a tick that had made a sermon out of patience for a century. She did not turn it on. She listened to its silence and how it still somehow made a cage of time in the room. She put her hands flat where a student would put them and did not move them because muscles have their own habits of invention. She waited.\n\nWaiting was a room she had built long ago. She had furnished it poorly at thirteen and then better at nineteen and then made it almost comfortable at thirty. She could wait now without popping and without biting and without running the alphabet in order. She thought about how many doors in her life had not had locks not because she had neglected them but because the architect hadn\u2019t believed in the existence of nights. She thought about the blue cap of the pen in her coat pocket and how her thumb had worn a crescent into the rubber without her permission. She thought about the voice that had said you\u2019re late and she thought about being early and how early was a lie you told yourself before you learned to keep your own time.\n\nShe heard the hallway before she heard the hand on the room. Her body knew the small stitches in air when another human brings their weather through a narrow space. The hinge gave its hint and then its confession. The door opened without a show and then it did not open more, as if the person on the other side respected the physics of polite entries more than most. A figure slid into the shape of the doorway the way a letter slides into a slot. Gray coat, not making a fuss. Blue scarf, the blue you picked if you had once learned the names of the colors and kept them as pets. Gloves, thin enough to feel piano keys through. The face had a shape and then it changed and then it went back to its original shape because the light chose a different story each second and the scarf ate the lower portion as it had on camera. The shoulders were smaller than the tan coat\u2019s and the posture was less charming. The person closed the door the way you close a book you intend to reopen.\n\n\u201cDetective,\u201d said the person, and the voice had that warm textbook quality that had stuck in Ezra\u2019s throat. It sat in the air and tried to behave. It wasn\u2019t disguised. It was controlled. She could hear, behind the control, the hum of a person who rehearsed sentences in empty rooms to see how they landed. The person\u2019s eyes were careful in the way of people who had been taught young that faces were weapons.\n\nPoin did not stand because standing would have made the space lie. She kept her hands visible. She said, \u201cYou asked for attention. I\u2019m excellent at it,\u201d and watched the small change at the corner of the person\u2019s eye that meant flattery had been recognized and assigned and refused.\n\n\u201cI asked for order,\u201d the person said. \u201cAttention is what you slap on things when you need to feel like a soldier. I prefer a desk and a pen and the time to avoid mistakes.\u201d\n\nA small, stupid part of Poin\u2019s body wanted to reach and adjust the ticking block to the notch marked 60. She didn\u2019t. The person\u2019s gaze went to the metronome anyway, that magnetic trick objects possess when they have been part of a rehearsal longer than anyone will admit. The glance slid to the toy sword and paused there just long enough to make the room know it had been seen. The person didn\u2019t smile. That would have broken the stage.\n\n\u201cYou took rope into my city and put it on boys,\u201d Poin said. \u201cYou laid our rooms out like exhibits. You used our walls. Did the ledger feel grand in your hand.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt felt correct,\u201d the person said. \u201cGrand is what the Chronicle calls your face. You don\u2019t believe in grand. I like that about you.\u201d\n\nNoah\u2019s recorder made no sound because that was its discipline. Outside in the hall a foot scraped and then Armitage coughed with the theatricality of someone performing the part of a person who was not listening. The person in the scarf did not look at the door, and Poin liked that, too, because it meant the person had rehearsed this moment enough to know where not to spend their eyes.\n\n\u201cYou wrote from our lobby,\u201d Poin said, because an accusation\u2019s power lives in the place it admits its own uncertainty. \u201cYou wrote from under our cameras. Guests in our house.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe all borrow roofs,\u201d the person said. \u201cYou tell yourself your house is a thing you chose. You live with a woman who knows where you put your bowl and you let her correct you. The rope was borrowed, too. Did that make it wrong. Did borrowing it make it worse than owning it. You will ask me about killing. You will ask me about my boys. You will try to make me a category so you can file me and sleep.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou put my name on your list,\u201d Poin said. She said it without moving anything in her face she didn\u2019t need to move. \u201cTell me what that category is.\u201d\n\nFor a half second the careful face slipped and the blinding ordinary self underneath it looked out. It was not a monster. It was a person who had sat in waiting rooms and stood in liquor aisles and watched neighbors on stoops and read signs about the schedule of trash days and noticed which corners of a room collected dust when everyone forgot to care. The person made a small hand movement that would have been a shrug if it had been given permission. \u201cYou are a ledger,\u201d the person said. \u201cYou are the only other ledger I\u2019ve seen in this place that isn\u2019t a joke. I wondered whether two books could sit on the same desk. Names can be offerings. Names can be threats. You know that better than the men who give you them.\u201d\n\n\u201cWere you going to kill me with rope,\u201d Poin said, and she didn\u2019t know whether she wanted yes or no. \u201cWere you going to teach me in my own room.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a room,\u201d the person said, and then laughed\u2014a small, surprised ruin of a sound that made the smile lines around their eyes validate themselves as human. \u201cThat is not true. I have rooms. They just don\u2019t have my name on their mailboxes. I would not kill you with rope. Rope is for boys who can still learn. You and I are too late for rope.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen what is for us,\u201d Poin said.\n\n\u201cPaper,\u201d the person said. \u201cA trial. A book. A column inches wide and television long. A podium. A note under a floor so good church ladies will have to forgive me because the boards will tell them what I did.\u201d\n\nThe scarf smelled like peppermint and printer ink. It wasn\u2019t a scent you wore to seduce. It was a scent you wore to obscure. The person walked a foot into the room and let the door fall shut very softly as if air were a thing you could lay down. The glove reached to the toy sword and touched its cheap hilt with a finger the way a person taps a child\u2019s forehead. The toy whined a little at the contact and the person\u2019s eyes shifted, finally, to Poin\u2019s. \u201cYou kept it,\u201d the person said, not quite a question.\n\n\u201cYou know about it,\u201d Poin said, and the person\u2019s mouth did that childless almost-smile again at the fact that she answered questions with their own questions. The glove slid over the plastic and Poin watched the latex pull a small green streak into dullness. A tiny bit of roughness at the glove\u2019s fingertip whispered over the toy\u2019s seam, a burr on a nail, a nick in a ring. A detail added itself to a drawer in Poin\u2019s head where it would live until she needed it more than she wanted to forget it.\n\n\u201cYou could have kept killing,\u201d Poin said, and tested the way the room held the word. \u201cYou did not. You chose theater. Why.\u201d\n\n\u201cWires,\u201d the person said. \u201cI disagree with yours. I have been trying on my version and wanted you to see it. It matters to me that you see it. It does not matter to me that you approve.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou learned in our house,\u201d Poin said, and now she let a little anger spend itself in her mouth because the body demands to be given coins or it makes its own. \u201cYou learned our schedule and our holes and our terrible passwords. You chewed our pencils and you wrote inside our walls. You think that makes you immune to us. It just makes you a part we have to stop. City is not your room to arrange.\u201d\n\n\u201cCity is everybody\u2019s room to arrange,\u201d the person said. \u201cYou arrange it. You do it with posture. With whether you let the men in strings of suits use your name like a charm. With whether you talk on camera. With whether you forgive the boys who steal five dollars from the register or whether you arrest them so some statistic will have a number that looks more like success than like love.\u201d The voice stayed warm, but there was a new crispness at the edge, like a page dog-eared hard enough to become a knife. \u201cI\u2019m bored,\u201d the person added, and the way they said it sounded like the truest thing anyone had let the air carry all week.\n\n\u201cThen leave,\u201d Poin said, and knew that wasn\u2019t the sentence that would save anybody in the room. \u201cLeave the city. Leave the boys. Leave the rope. If you\u2019re bored, find something else to make into a mirror.\u201d\n\nThe person tilted their head the way a dancer marks a beat in their body so a thing will happen on time. \u201cYou\u2019re tired,\u201d they said, and the sentence felt like a hand on her jaw checking whether she clenched in her sleep. \u201cYour neighbor worries over your bowls. Your doctor taught you vocabulary. Your department uses you and puts your name on a sandwich board. Your boy Caswell loves you and will break in half if something happens to you because his heart was not built for theater. You have a small green joke you keep around as if it can be a hinge for the day. Your g hooks when you stop pretending to be ergonomic. You picked this room because sound behaves, and because you once lay down on the lobby floor and saw the ribs and thought about boats. You and I have the same affliction: we think rooms are maps. If you catch me, it will be in a room you mapped first.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I catch you,\u201d Poin said, and she didn\u2019t try to sand the word. \u201cThere will be no rope. There will be mercy and a mouth that says what you did into a microphone so the city can decide if it wants to be better than you think it is.\u201d\n\nThe person flicked the sword off with a gesture that would have looked rude if it had been done to a candle and was only funny because it was done to a toy. They put their hand flat on the metronome, not moving it, just laying skin on wood, and Poin saw the glove\u2019s cuff ride up half an inch and reveal wrist. The wrist had a scar, but not the rope\u2019s pale half moon; this one was a straight line from the base of the palm down two inches, neat and old, the kind you get when a piece of glass refuses to be furniture. On the index finger a ring sat that was less jewelry than hardware, stainless something with a nick so small you wouldn\u2019t notice it until you tried to turn a cheap green toy on in the dark. Her head did its work and then her body held still like a predator that doesn\u2019t want the grass to know.\n\n\u201cBalance,\u201d the person said. \u201cYou like the word better than I do. Keep it. We\u2019ll share custody.\u201d They looked at her for a long beat, the kind that metronomes can count, and then they moved backwards with more promise than threat. The door moved without Clemson or any god to bless it and opened into Armitage\u2019s cough again. The scarf moved; the gray coat made its own shadow; and then the hall took both back as if swallowing a coin.\n\nPoin stood because she was allowed to again. She waited three more ticks she hadn\u2019t turned on and then four because when your brain wants three, four is safer. She opened the door so hard the hinge made an apology it didn\u2019t believe, and the hallway gave her Armitage\u2019s calm hair and Noah\u2019s too-wide eyes and the uniform at the bend of the corridor with his hand on a nothing he couldn\u2019t use. The stairwell door swung once, twice, like a thing that had just been used for something it didn\u2019t approve. She ran.\n\nHer body remembered ladders faster than it remembered lovers. She took the first flight and the second like a problem with its own solution. The landing held the smell of a heated coil somewhere being asked to pretend it was a fire. The door to the roof had been unlocked because Armitage had let a maintenance man fix a vent last week and had not had time to fix his fixing. Poin hit the door with her shoulder and let the night\u2019s cold tell her she was still under a sky. The roof had gravel and lint and a little crown of pigeon crime. To her right a figure moved, gray turned smoke, scarf turned night sea. Noah\u2019s voice shouted \u201cleft\u201d in her ear as if direction could be granted like a gift, and she obeyed without seeing the left yet, a new trick she would thank him for later and scold him for sooner.\n\nThe person did not run like a runner. They ran like someone using a run as a way to move between two poses. They crossed the gravel with their hands out a fraction from their sides as if balancing on a board and not a city. They reached the parapet and turned without putting their weight in their heels and dropped over with a small professional care that suggested a ladder on the far side, not air. Poin reached the wall and leaned and saw the ladder, old, wooden, memorial to a law that had been revised three times and never enforced. It slid down to a brick outcrop that would get you to the old gutter\u2019s spine, get you three feet over to a window older than her career with a sash that had always been half in love with open. The person below had made this trip enough times to love it. They put a gloved hand on the sash and coaxed it up like a doctor opening a child\u2019s mouth. She could have dropped after them, and she would have made the reach, and she would have split her shin and her pride on the gutter and she would have been in a room she did not control. She reached for the ladder anyway because the human machine is bad at reward at the end of long waits.\n\nNoah\u2019s hand on her belt was the only reason she didn\u2019t go. He dug his fingers into canvas like a person pulling back a dog from a fight it would win and regret. She looked at him and hated him and loved him and noted through the hateful love that his eyes had learned something in the last month that made him older than his hoodie intended. Caswell\u2019s voice rose from the stairwell naming her the same way he said his prayers, and she let the name be a leash until she could breathe without her muscles trying to spend themselves.\n\nThey lost her in the library again, which was not a surprise. The window opened into a stair that looked decorative on building maps and lived in the mouth of the duct. The wedge of camera blind spots existed not because the city had been stupid but because the city had been itself, and the person had learned it the way you learn your own floor not to creak. Halladay watched them blow through the reading room with her mouth set to librarian\u2019s medium, and she did not feign shock or perform fear because she had decided an hour ago that would be a waste of performance. She pointed to the corner the wedge loved and said, \u201cDo not step there, you will break your ankle,\u201d and they did not, and she was pleased to have saved something.\n\nWhat they had, afterward, was not satisfaction but the kind of cloth a dressmaker can turn into a garment if you give her time and someone patient to hold the pins. Noah lifted the toy sword in the glove bag and squinted into the scratch near the switch. Fibers glinted like gods at the edge of the wound, a color not unlike the scarf\u2019s when seen under worse light, a blend that cheap cloths pick when cheap manufacturers are trying to make a dye look expensive. He teased a single filament into a microscope\u2019s mouth like a man feeding a snake. He talked to it the way some men talk to cars. He said, \u201cPoly and something with a metallic twist. Do you know who buys this thread because I do.\u201d He said, \u201cThis is the kind they use for municipal uniforms when they want to pretend someone is important because their scarf has a sheen.\u201d\n\nArmitage produced a box with a municipal inspector\u2019s spare scarf because she had run a building long enough to own everyone\u2019s wardrobe in miniature. It did not match. Halladay, who seemed to enjoy the sorcery of being asked for things she could produce, brought a drawer of lost-and-found fabric and laid out four scarves like a tarot. Noah shook his head over each like he was exorcising a mood. The thread in the scratch wanted to be from a particular kind of store that made the same scarf for three years and then stopped when they learned better. Poin took the fiber\u2019s photograph on the little film camera because she liked trusting a thing she couldn\u2019t argue with through an app. She put the ring nick into her pocket without touching it because her eye had measured the metal with its habit of loving minutiae.\n\nLott remarked, when they told him, that rings were gifts and punishments both, and then ruined it by adding something about marriage that made Caswell perform a cough loud enough to qualify as a joke. Stills asked if the person was a woman and then gave a speech about the danger of calling anyone a woman when your brain only meant scarf, and Poin let him tie himself in that knot because she was too tired to untie him and too awake to leave him in it. The ADA watched the tape recorder turn and said out loud that analog made her feel like a kid again when magic tricks seemed possible, and Poin looked at her ring without meaning to. It was smooth and unhelpful, the polite gold you give yourself when you decide that visible promises have cuteness to them and not just weight.\n\nEzra\u2019s mother brought a bag of warm tamales to the station that evening like she was dropping medicine on the doorstep of an illness she could not diagnose. She hugged Poin because nobody stopped her and because Poin had been the person who put a hand on her boy\u2019s face and said his name when a rope had tried to live there. \u201cThank you,\u201d she said in a voice that had known a thousand versions of those words, and Poin had to muscle a swallow past something stupid and hard in her throat. Ezra texted a photograph of his peppermint wrapper crumpled into a shape like a flower, and a single word after it: practice. She told him to play scales until numbers made sense again and to leave his door open, and she hid that message under a different one because privacy should sometimes be a gift and not a right.\n\nAt home, the hat on the hook still did not belong to her and it was beginning to feel like a small domestic haunting she could live with. Mrs. Liu had left a note on the door in a hand that could have passed for a cardinal\u2019s: Soup in your fridge. If you do not eat, your face will become a moral lesson to strangers, and I refuse to let my hallway be used like that. She ate the soup as if compliance could be a weapon. She put the ledger copy in a folder and labeled the folder with an uglier word than ledger so she would be less tempted to look at it when she shouldn\u2019t. She placed the toy sword on the windowsill again and noticed the scratch the ring had made like a scar the room would carry now no matter how many times she moved the furniture.\n\nThe blog did not crow about the meeting. It posted something that felt like a rehearsal\u2019s notes, tight and mean and almost an apology and then not at all. It read about balance without saying balance and about rooms without saying rooms. It used the word reconcile again and then deleted it and then used it again as if admitting to a tic could become a virtue. It wrote about a ledger learning to share a desk. It wrote, in a line that made her heart stop for half a second and then go again with undue force, about the sword\u2019s ridiculous dignity. It was the smallest thing, the kind of sentence a person writes when they are tired and honest, and it placed the person in that room beyond any network stub\u2019s shadow.\n\nShe wrote three sentences in her book before she slept. They were not good and they were not false. She wrote about the ring and the nick and the way the glove had ridden up. She wrote about scars: rope\u2019s and glass\u2019s and the kind that live in the way you turn a doorknob after an evening that went wrong. She wrote one on the last line with her left hand because she wanted to see it with its hook before she decided she trusted herself, and she let it hook and she did not correct it, and she let the shame come and go like a tide. She turned off the lights and the trains did their whales and the radiator did its ship, and she dreamed about a room full of metronomes set to different beats and how, if you listened long enough, the room shook until they all found each other and settled on one tick. She woke with her jaw unclenched and the answer rephrased instead of rewritten. She would ask Halladay for the sign-out logs for every staff inspector who had visited Kunstler in the last six months and for the receipts for scarves. She would take the fiber to a woman Noah swore by who could tell you which mill had woven a thread by the way it refused to burn. She would ask Ms. Armitage for the photo of any staff rings that looked like hardware, which would be an odd request, and she would endure the look because she had earned the right to be odd. She would call the Office of Municipal Systems and ask who had done the last vent audit in the library and the city hall and the PD and she would use their names until they told her the truth or woke up in a cold sweat with the feeling that a name had been misused.\n\nShe made herself stand by the window for the time it took for the first train to cut the frost from the rails and the last overnight party to limp home. In the glass she saw herself and a second self and the hat she didn\u2019t own and the sword she hadn\u2019t deserved, and she said her own name twice and it improved the room by the smallest fraction. She breathed, four down and four up, and she turned toward the door because it was time to go make the city make a noise on purpose instead of only when someone shook it. The ledger would get a new hand. She would decide how to be boring in a way that still cut. And somewhere, under the surface, a person would put their glove back on and wonder for the first time whether what they wanted was a trial or a stage, and that wondering would be the first honest trouble they had gotten all week.",

                              "content": "Chapter 9\n\nCity Stores sat on a block that had once been proud of its bricks and now wore them like a shirt you keep because it still fits. The loading bays yawned like mouths that had learned not to complain. Inside, aisles ran like cornfields, bins labeled in handwriting that had outlasted three label makers and a vow to modernize. Poin liked it immediately. Rooms where people kept track of small, boring things aroused her affection and suspicion in equal measure, because order is honest until it isn\u2019t and the seam where it lies usually looks like a shelf.\n\nThe quartermaster was a woman who introduced herself with her last name first. O\u2019Hara had a braid like a rope she trusted and a ledger bound in red canvas that could have doubled as a weapon. \u201cScarves,\u201d she said, after Poin had asked and flashed. \u201cYou want the fancy ones or the ones they pretend are fancy. We got a winter lot in three seasons ago for the Office of Civic Interaction because someone on the council decided visibility would be warmth. They went with a poly blend with a metallic tooth in the thread because pictures like to bite light. I told them it would itch, and they told me to be nice. I was nice. It still itches.\u201d\n\nPoin asked to see the inventory like a person asking to hold a baby whose mother rarely lets anyone touch it. O\u2019Hara led her through smell of cardboard and dust that had learned the names of years. A bin marked CIVIC WINTER held scarves in plastic bags that tried to sound expensive when you shook them. She slit one open and let the fabric air itself like a truth. Under the store\u2019s light the blue read as night dragged to daylight and the metallic strand did its cheap shimmer. She turned a corner of the scarf and found a tag printed with an order number and a vendor name she did not recognize, KERRIGAN THREADWORKS LTD., with an address that had once been the river\u2019s edge and was now a block of new glass pretending to be river. O\u2019Hara watched her the way a woman watches a customer who might steal something for a good cause. \u201cNot a lot of departments signed for these,\u201d she said, tapping her ledger with a nail that had made peace with dirt. \u201cCivic Interaction, obviously. City Collections for the tour docents when they go out to explain to schoolkids that a lamppost can be a friend. Three to the ADA\u2019s outreach team because someone thought a matching scarf was what an apology looked like. Four to Code Compliance because a certain manager thinks a scarf can be a badge.\u201d\n\n\u201cNames,\u201d Poin said, and O\u2019Hara flipped pages as if she were turning a life into a song. She didn\u2019t give her the names because she wasn\u2019t a fool, but she let Poin read them without pretending she didn\u2019t. A George D. with a signature that looked like it had borrowed a suit, a Flavia R. who penciled a smiley into the tail of her F out of reflex, a D. Stills who had no business needing any scarf from any warehouse and had signed and underlined his own name like a man practicing saying it under oath. Poin smiled without teeth. O\u2019Hara raised one eyebrow and said, \u201cPeople will come for a paperclip if the paperclip makes them feel official. There are three left. The rest are out living their best lives, itching necks.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho took the last batch,\u201d Poin said, and O\u2019Hara pointed at a line with yesterday\u2019s date. The order had been small, two scarves and a lectern cover made of the same cheap sheen, signed for by C. LOTT because a captain sometimes decides a piece of cloth can make a podium behave. Poin touched the tag again and let the weave tell her its small lie. Metallic thread is obsessed with being noticed; it leaves a taste.\n\nKerrigan Threadworks, the address said, and Poin followed the address up the river\u2019s flank because it felt right to make the thread go home. The building that had lived there before had been a place where men hit things with hammers and called it love. Now glass looked at water and tried to remember how not to be smug. Kerrigan had taken three floors of the south edge. A receptionist in a black sweater and an old-fashioned pin that said WE MEND answered her badge with, \u201cWe do mostly theater now,\u201d and Poin saw the universe in the sentence and had to put her hand in her pocket to keep from laughing at the joke only she had been told. The studio beyond was all bolts and tables and a woman with a magnifier looped around her head like a crown for saints whose work required strain.\n\n\u201cThis,\u201d said the woman with the loop when Poin laid the fiber in a dish like it was a moth\u2019s wing. \u201cAh. This is ours, or if not ours then somebody who steals from us with excellent taste in theft. Municipal blend, order two winters ago, rush job, special finish because they insisted on a glitter that wouldn\u2019t leave the cameras blind. We taught them that camera blind is sometimes a mercy. It didn\u2019t take. The metallic in this strand is not even metal. It\u2019s a polyester with a delusion. You want sample reference.\u201d She laid out swatches with the affection of a mother lining up school pictures. \u201cAnd thread dye lot number, and invoice, and the name of the person who signed, which we don\u2019t normally give, but you look like the person who will come back with a warrant if we ask you to be patient.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am very patient,\u201d Poin said, and watched the looped woman\u2019s mouth twitch. \u201cThe person who signed.\u201d\n\n\u201cRuiz,\u201d said the woman. \u201cFlavia, from Civic Interaction. Sweet, furious, young enough to believe in laminators. She complained about itch on behalf of her people, which made me like her.\u201d She blew the fiber into a bag with a breath that wanted to be a science and added, \u201cWe sell to Code sometimes when they remember we exist. The rest go to theater. It\u2019s funny and not funny that the people who lie on purpose are better at telling you what their lying fabric needs.\u201d\n\nOn the way down the glass stairs, Poin saw herself reflected in the curve of the river and a shadow on the opposite pane that was not hers. The tan coat man existed as a persistence, a figure at the edge of things, speaking to no one and yet constantly speaking to the part of her brain that disliked holes. He looked at the water like a man who had told it secrets. He turned his head a fraction, not enough to acknowledge and enough to count. He had no scarf. He had the neck line, the white that had learned to be less loud. He had a ring that was not, and when he tucked his hands into his pockets she caught the flash of plain metal that might have had a nick or might have had a gleam. He drifted toward a set of doors that pretended to belong to a gym. She let him go because the ribbon in her pocket was more ready to be pulled and because chasing a man into a place where bodies sweat for vanity always made her feel like the joke was on the wrong audience.\n\nNoah met her at the curb like a messenger in a painting, hair doing its storm, a bag with the saintly recorders hanging off his arm like a set of bells. \u201cTextile saint says yes,\u201d he said, and she lifted the corner of the scarf with a fingertip to show him the tag. He made a noise reserved for children presented with their favorite machine. \u201cProcurement we can subpoena. O\u2019Hara we can bribe with respect. Kerrigan we can bribe with stories. I like this train.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like the way Stills signs for scarves,\u201d Poin said, and Noah did not dignify Stills with a sentence. He held up a clear box and inside was the plastic toy sword, the scratch near the switch magnified by his own new trick with light. Fibers lay there like tiny nestlings, one blue with its fake metal thread, a second hair-thin, clear, like plastic that had been thinned to transparency. \u201cNot glove,\u201d Noah said, before she could ask. \u201cFishing line. Or the memory of it. I don\u2019t like that it\u2019s here. It means someone spent their time in your apartment making a string show and then decided to take the string with them. Or it means you bought bad fruit. I choose the worst interpretation because my therapist says I have earned it.\u201d\n\n\u201cFishing line,\u201d she said, and thought of the package under the bridge, the proud knot, the way the bag had fogged. The city is full of windows for sale; it is also full of places where a person can buy line and pretend that it\u2019s for a fish. \u201cBrand?\u201d\n\nNoah looked at her with the love of a man given permission to nerd. \u201cIf you think I won\u2019t go to the store and buy every line labeled \u2018invisible\u2019 and give them all a microscope date, you are new to my personality. I need a day. I need a person to stand behind me telling me to eat peanuts.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll loan you Mrs. Liu,\u201d Poin said. \u201cShe\u2019ll tell you to eat soup and to move your chairs so they scrape. Works better.\u201d\n\nAt the Office of Municipal Systems, a man greeted her with an expression she had seen on the faces of conductors forced to stop midpiece. He called his office a department but it was a desk with a plant trying to find a window and a calendar that had seen oil stains and starlings. He had a box of rings sitting on the cabinet behind him like a shop. The rings were not jewelry; they were band cutters, key rings, cheap safety bands that contractors wore when they wanted to look like their metal had a job. \u201cWe do vents,\u201d he said, when she asked and flashed again. \u201cWe do them badly because everyone hates vents until vents stop working and then they love them with a passion that dies by spring. We do ladder audits every five years and then pretend we did them last year when a reporter calls. We issued safety rings to six field inspectors two winters ago because a lawyer told us if we didn\u2019t a hand would get caught and a suit would get rich.\u201d\n\nHe let her handle the rings. One had a nick where a door had introduced itself too enthusiastically, a bright bite on dull steel the size of nothing that nevertheless read like a signature once you knew what kind of paper it lived on. He watched her watch and said, as if he were the kind of man who could be led to poetry by accident, \u201cMetal remembers where it met other metal. My wife says that about faces. She does not like our dinner parties.\u201d Poin turned the ring until the nick caught the overhead light and did its tiny shine. She felt her left hand want to hook and set it on the table so her right could remember its own steadiness.\n\n\u201cNames,\u201d she said, the ritual demanded by the room, and the man gave them with the sigh of a person who had gotten over his affection for secrecy. Field inspectors, six, two on disability, one on paternity leave, one on leave-leave because the city had temporarily mislaid his file and his good temper. Corrine Lafferty, who had been first to file a form called Non-Compliance of Ladder Rails and whose ring had a scratch from a door hinge. Dorothea Ng, whose email had an out-of-office message that had been on for three weeks longer than a vacation ought to be. A list of men whose faces she knew from rooms where men apologize to a woman with a badge for the inconvenience of her gender. Her eye snagged on the scratch on the sample ring again and then slid to a photograph on the desk of five people wearing their municipal scarves like a dare at a holiday social. Blue. Cheap. Metal thread pretending to be snow. A face she recognized and had tried not to: Stills, on the edge of the picture, borrowing someone\u2019s scarf and looking like a man who had discovered the joy of uniforms. It was almost enough to make her laugh into the plant.\n\nShe asked the Municipal man for a list of buildings with vent access unusual enough to accommodate a person who had learned the city\u2019s throat. He loved that question the way old men love being asked about trains. He leaned over a map with grease at the edges and tapped at points with a pencil stub that had chew marks similar to the ones Noah had made into a science. The library, of course, part of the old expansion when ventilation had been a romance. Kunstler, yes, because music and air require each other, and someone in 1972 had been generous with their schematics. City Hall had a duct run like a rumor that started nowhere and ended in two closets. The PD had something else, a run abandoned when they\u2019d built the new evidence vault but never sealed because the budget had stopped at the part where you put locks on doors. \u201cYou could crawl it if you hated yourself,\u201d he said. \u201cYou would come out into the room where nobody keeps anything and then you would discover that everybody keeps something there because that is how humans treat unclaimed space.\u201d\n\nHe gave her a ring, not as a gift but as a loan that felt personal. It was not the ring with the nick; he did not offer that and she did not ask. It was identical in make, cheap, proud of being stainless in a world that rusts. She slipped it on her index finger and felt how it tugged against her skin, the weight choosing her hand\u2019s old aches with insulting accuracy. She placed it back on the desk before it decided to be sentimental.\n\nThe blog did not wait until night. It posted at two in the afternoon, which made office workers tilt their screens and students pretend to check the weather. It said:\n\nYou think fabric and pins and thread will let you stitch a person onto a bulletin board. You think a ring with a scratch is a face. I, too, like objects to tell the truth. That is why my rooms are better teachers than your talking. If you would like a list, here is your list: attention, rope, ledger, mercy, reconcile, door. If you would like another list, write your own. If you would like me to stop, you will have to stop asking the wrong questions.\n\nNoah forwarded it with the comment thread from the crime nerds underlined twice. Someone had noticed the repetition of reconcile and built an entire personality out of it in five fervent paragraphs. Someone else had suggested that the grammar shifted in a way that suggested the writer had spent time in two regions where the word soda meant different drinks. Someone had created a fake photograph of Poin wearing a blue scarf and holding a real sword and captioned it: BETRAYAL, which made her laugh by accident because at a certain point the city becomes a dog chasing its own tail and you can either bark along or crawl under a table.\n\nIn the lab, Noah had built a small altar to fishing line. He had six brands wound like prayers and a seventh he was pretending not to like. He had discovered under the microscope that the line on her toy carried a microscopic nick and that the nick had a shape that matched an economy cutter used by janitorial staff in buildings older than grammar. \u201cI am inventing a new field,\u201d he said, half proud and half appalled. \u201cForensic budget analysis via microplastics. Please don\u2019t alert the academy.\u201d\n\nShe thought of the custodian at Kunstler with the splinter scar and the solemnity of a man who found hand soap a matter of moral gravity. She refused to let her brain turn him into a villain because he had a face like a man who had decided to love a building and could not be talked out of it. She made herself say his name anyway, quietly, and Noah made himself say, just as quietly, \u201cHe doesn\u2019t smell like peppermint and paper. He smells like citrus solvent and quiet.\u201d He was right. Her body remembered smell and stored it in places her mouth couldn\u2019t reach.\n\nEvening found her sitting on Mrs. Liu\u2019s couch because Mrs. Liu had knocked and said, \u201cYou will sit,\u201d in a tone that makes the body obey. The widow had a radio with a knob that was more accurate than most men, and she tuned it to a public station where a woman with a velvet voice was making the city feel like someone was reading it a bedtime story. Poin ate the soup and felt her jaw unhook, and Mrs. Liu told her about a cousin who had made a ledger for the family in the old country and how the ledger had saved them from hunger because it remembered who owed whom their lives. \u201cYou cannot hate the book,\u201d Mrs. Liu said. \u201cYou can hate the hand. You can correct the hand. You can make a nicer hand take the pen. The book is a tool. Don\u2019t be silly.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy name in it,\u201d Poin said, because the soup had made her brave enough to say the hard quiet. \u201cMy name is in it as a threat or a prayer.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour name sticks to things,\u201d Mrs. Liu said, pleased to be the kind of neighbor who knew such a thing. \u201cThat is why they like to say it. That is why you must not hide. Also, that hat is mine and you will return it to my hook when you are done stealing it for your drama.\u201d\n\nShe returned the hat and laughed and it hurt and helped again. On her way back to her apartment she caught sight of herself in the hallway\u2019s dark frame and saw for a half breath the second pair of eyes she had been training herself to expect and not fear. She said her first and last name out loud twice and the eyes stayed hers the second time. This, too, was practice.\n\nShe woke with texts that said meeting. Lott had decided that the city should see itself at a podium and apologize for the rope as if the rope had asked to be included. The council had gathered under a large photograph of a river they had printed years ago and kept dragging behind them to make every room feel like there was water in it. The ADA had her careful words wrapped in careful hair; Stills stood at a potted plant because a potted plant made him feel like nature had blessed his role; citizens stood in the back and held their coats shut like moral arguments. Poin had a piece of paper that said: comprehensive leads, community patience, boring truth. She had a scarf in her bag she had borrowed from O\u2019Hara for the joy of returning it, and she had the ring of the municipal man not on her finger.\n\nThe tan coat man sat three rows back with the posture of a man who had learned to look like a person who listens. His hands were plain and his face was plain and his ring was plain. Poin said her sentences in an order that made calm sound like a weapon. She looked up once and saw the tan coat man not looking at her but at the exit sign, as if he were counting the letters. She saw, in the third row left, a woman with a blue scarf making a tight bow at the base of her throat and a face that had chosen not to bring its expression to the room. The bow looked like a choice made in a mirror by a hand that understood elegance in cheap cloth. The ring, when she saw it flash as the woman adjusted the scarf\u2019s lie, had a nick like a story.\n\nShe did not break the meeting for an arrest because she was a person who had learned to punish her impulses by giving them better times to exist. She finished her sentences. She let Stills say mercy the way a man in a good suit says dessert. She let the ADA talk about reconcile in a way that made her want to put her head on a table and yell and also made her admire the woman\u2019s commitment to geometry. She went to the hall afterward and made her body look casual in the way people do when they want their gravity to rearrange the crowd. The woman with the blue scarf stood by the donation box counting the pamphlets as if they were sins. Up close, the peppermint lived in her scarf and in her breath, and the paper smell belonged to her bag.\n\n\u201cYou look better on screens,\u201d Corrine Lafferty said, because names do not always surprise you. Her eyes were the color induced by rooms that love fluorescent lights more than people. \u201cIn person you look like a person who needs new chairs at home.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou look like someone who is tired of ladders,\u201d Poin said, because she had decided to gamble two truths at once. \u201cHow\u2019s your ring.\u201d\n\nLafferty\u2019s mouth twitched in that narrow space where truth and fight do a small dance. \u201cIt\u2019s stainless,\u201d she said. \u201cIt won\u2019t rust when people hold onto it and spill their coffee. You\u2019re not wrong about the ladders. The city builds nonsense and we climb it and then someone falls and we get sued. It makes you love paper.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou were in Kunstler,\u201d Poin said, watching the breath move under the scarf and the way the bow sat slightly off to the left like a person whose hips never learned straight lines. \u201cYou were in the library. You sign out your scarves. Do you sign out your hallways too.\u201d\n\n\u201cEveryone signs out their hallways,\u201d Lafferty said. \u201cYou just do it with your mouth.\u201d She adjusted the scarf and the ring flashed and showed the nick. It made a tiny confession and then pretended it had never met a crime. \u201cIf I wanted to bind boys, Detective, I\u2019d buy nicer rope. If I wanted to bind you, I\u2019d write a grant that paid for your name to be on every flyer and then I would sit in the back and watch you try to save a city with a pronoun. I don\u2019t like the way she uses rope. I like the way she uses rooms.\u201d\n\n\u201cHave you met her,\u201d Poin said, and Lafferty did the little head tilt that meant ask me that again in a room without microphones. The ADA drifted and took Lafferty\u2019s elbow and did the introductions people do when they have committed to professionalism as a way to pad a day. Lafferty shook hands and her glove breathed peppermint. Poin cataloged the pressure of her fingers, light and practiced, the way of a person who avoids letting touch become a commitment. The ADA\u2019s ring was gold and said nothing. Lafferty\u2019s was stainless and said maybe. The tan coat man had gone. He had a way of making absence as informative as his presence.\n\nThey got a search under paper, because sometimes paper grants courage to rooms. Municipal Systems had the courtesy to look stung when asked for Lafferty\u2019s itinerary and vent entries. Her logs were neat and could have been honest; neatness and honesty are not cousins. Three nights that matched draft times. One afternoon that did not. Six hallways that gave her a story. The vent run under the PD that led to the room where everyone kept nothing. The after-hours visit to Kunstler to check on a complaint about damp air. A signature at the library burned onto a sheet with a pen that had sputtered and then decided to behave. In the margin of one of the sheets, Lafferty had written the word reconcile and crossed it out and then written coordinate above it like she had taught herself what she wanted to look like on a different day.\n\nIn a conference room with glass like an aquarium, Stills argued, gently and with an eagerness that made Poin want to put a hand on his shoulder and then remove it, that an inspector is a city\u2019s immune system and sometimes immune systems attack the body they mean to guard. Lott showed them the photograph of Lafferty\u2019s holiday scarf and face and ring and said nothing for a long minute because saying things too soon makes them turn silly. Noah put down the fiber, the line, the photograph of the scratch, the recording where the metronome made a sound that had learned to be louder inside his head. Armitage sent a text with a single word: yes. Halladay sent a photograph of a lost-and-found scarf with a stain in the same place where hands obsessively adjust bows. Mrs. Liu asked if Poin needed more soup. Ezra\u2019s mother sent a picture of hands on a cello string, pressure where it belongs.\n\nThey took a warrant to Lafferty\u2019s house because the ADA understood that some rooms required the law to perform its rituals on their thresholds. Lafferty lived in a third-floor walk-up with a window that had learned to love rust because it brought color to a neighborhood that liked to pretend it had none. The apartment had the kind of order that comes from a person who is tired of being touched by other people\u2019s mess. The books stood like soldiers. The towels were folded with a precision that made Poin feel both judged and only mildly judged. Peppermint waited in a jar next to the sink under a sign that said RINSE YOUR CUP in lettering that wanted to be nicer than it was. On the table a stack of forms lived under a paperweight in the shape of a fish. On the mantel, if you could call the ledge over the radiator a mantel, a metronome sat where a photograph might have wanted to live. It matched the Kunstler make but its number had been sanded off with care and not enough skill.\n\nThe closet held a gray coat that did not want to make a statement and a tan coat with threads at the cuff that had caught on something rough once and remembered. The scarf drawer held three, all municipal blue, one with a pulled thread that glinted metallic under kitchen light. On the dresser a ring lay as if it had been put down to say, you be me for a minute. It was stainless and it had a nick that had met a certain toy in a certain room. The bathroom mirror had a crack like a line of thought someone had tried to tape back together. The medicine cabinet had the normal human humiliations, aspirin and a tile of old blush a friend had given her as a joke a decade ago. She had no rope. She had an empty box under the sink that had once held gloves and had been flattened with a neat heel.\n\nLafferty stood by the kitchen counter and watched them watch her life. She didn\u2019t fidget. She had given up fidgeting when the city took her first month\u2019s patience and never returned it. She did not deny the scarf or the ring. She did not claim the rope or the chair. She looked at the metronome and Poin thought she saw, under the careful face, a grief so mild it barely qualified the word, and she wondered who had given Lafferty the first tick she fell in love with.\n\n\u201cYou can arrest me,\u201d Lafferty said, when the ADA lifted a brow that had practiced its calm. \u201cYou can put me in a room and count me. It will bore me and I will talk in a way that makes Stills forget his microexpression book. But it will be honest. You will call me Giselle and I will say nothing and you will make a program out of my head and people will line up to ask you where I bought my scarf. It will make you feel like you ended something. It will not end anything you want to end.\u201d\n\n\u201cOthers,\u201d Poin said, because there it was, the word the blog had taught her to fear and believe. \u201cChorus.\u201d\n\nLafferty did not pretend not to know what dumb little word she meant. She shook her head once. \u201cI don\u2019t like choirs. I like quartets where everyone lets everyone else be a voice and doesn\u2019t pretend it is God. There are no others. There are rooms. There are men who like to watch. There are boys you can save by teaching them to be afraid. There is a city that thinks it can reconcile bad math with a photo on the front of the Chronicle. There is you. And me. That is enough chorus to make a song that will break some windows.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou were in my apartment,\u201d Poin said, because the closet held a hat that did not belong to Lafferty but to Mrs. Liu, which meant the city was starting to play jokes on her through unrelated doors. Lafferty\u2019s mouth did the small move again and then stopped moving because she had decided not to answer. Her silence said, I will not give you the satisfaction of learning which doors in your building do not lock.\n\nThey took her in. They took her ring. They took the scarf with the pulled thread. The fiber matched. The nick matched. The monologue matched and then didn\u2019t when they wanted it to be shallow. She did not confess to rope. She did not confess to water. She confessed to rooms. She confessed to the part where she had stood at the church with a peppermint in her cheek and watched Poin come in late and sit as if she had been saving the spot all week. She confessed, in a tone that made the room lean in because it allowed a woman to say a thing that was not self-defense, that she had written ledger because she liked neat lines and had disliked them as a child and had decided at thirty-one to change sides.\n\nNoah stood behind glass and wrote ATTENTION in block letters as if he could see through the mirror. Caswell stood in the doorway and tried not to throw a chair because he believed, with great sincerity, that everything would be fine if he threw a chair the right way. Lott sat and said reconcile in a voice that made the word vulgar and then tried again and made it almost tender. Stills asked if she had a partner and Lafferty looked at him with pity, which made him swallow and write down a fact anyway.\n\nWhen Poin asked her about the tan coat man, Lafferty looked at the wall. \u201cHe likes bridges,\u201d she said, and the way she said like made the roof change shape by an inch. \u201cHe likes watching. He thinks watching is innocence. He left a ring in a bowl once in a bar that I know the smell of. He will not get in your duct because he could get stuck and he knows it.\u201d\n\n\u201cName,\u201d Poin said, because names could be levers or lint. Lafferty put her hand flat on the table and did not make a fist. \u201cHe has three,\u201d she said. \u201cHe is not a chorus. He is a man who wants to sit in a room and feel like a choir. If you put him on a stage he will die. He would prefer to die on a bridge.\u201d\n\nThe Chronicle ran an extra with Lafferty\u2019s face, which made Poin want to break several small appliances. The blog posted after midnight. It said:\n\nLedgers hate being closed. You have closed one. You will write a book about it and claim you invented grammar. I do not mind. I used your rooms. You found your ring. I am bored. The river is bored. There is a boy who will put his hand on a rail tomorrow and think that makes him safe and you will tell him he is right because you need your mouth to be a lighthouse. We are done with rope. We are not done.\n\nNoah texted a photograph of a scar on a wrist next to a few new maps of vents. Armitage sent a peppermint emoji because she had learned to communicate that way to students and it seemed to be habit by now. Halladay sent a blank email with the subject line doors and nothing in the body and Poin laughed and then went to the window and put her forehead against the cold as if the glass could be a saint. Mrs. Liu knocked twice and told her to go to bed and not write in the kitchen because the table wanted to feel like a table in the morning.\n\nShe slept and dreamed a room full of metronomes again and watched them click into each other\u2019s time until the room was a single heartbeat, and in the dream she could not tell whether the beat belonged to a person or a city or a ledger stamping a number on the corner of a page. She woke before dawn and put on her wrong hat and went to the river and stood on a bridge because sometimes the only way to keep a place from becoming a stage is to walk across it like a person who is going somewhere. She kept her hands open on the rail. The water moved under the ice like two bodies arguing and agreeing without anyone above taking sides. The city breathed. The trains confessed. The day decided to be boring and then did not keep its promise.\n\nBy eight, the tan coat man had decided to keep his appointment with himself. He came up the east ramp like a man entering a church late, polite with his feet. He stood at the rail with her without touching anything she was touching. His eyes were not extraordinary and therefore she trusted them less. His ring had been replaced by skin. The white seam at his throat had decided to be subtle. He said her name with a care that made it sound as if he were setting it down on a shelf.\n\n\u201cYou missed the show,\u201d he said, and she heard the outrage of a child who had arrived at the fair after the fireworks. \u201cYou let them take a woman who likes ledgers and you think you have balanced anything. That\u2019s cute.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou should get a better insult,\u201d she said, and did not look at his hands because that would have made them both feel like they had started something. \u201cShe confessed to rooms. She did not confess to rope. Would you like to confess to rope.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou would like a partner,\u201d he said. \u201cYou would like to tell the city that a man had his hands on it. That will make the boys sleep better. I didn\u2019t touch your boys. I don\u2019t like rope. Rope likes to write its own story. I like watching. I like saying words like reconcile and seeing you not flinch. I like that you keep a toy in your corner that says you are a person and also a story. I like this bridge. I will leave on it when you ask me to leave enough times to make it feel like you did a thing.\u201d\n\nShe had learned to be very tired without letting any tiredness touch her mouth. She said, \u201cTell me your name,\u201d and he said, \u201cDo you think she knows my name,\u201d with a flatness that made her believe he was telling one honest thing. He put his palms on the rail and leaned like a person who has practiced not falling and did not test the city\u2019s patience by pushing further. \u201cYou can write down my face,\u201d he said, as if he were giving her a party favor that had rolled behind a couch. \u201cIt looks like anyone\u2019s. You can call me the wrong thing if it helps your paperwork. You can say\u2014I want to be careful how I say this\u2014you can say I am a ledger, too. But I am not. I am an audience. I am what keeps a city honest. You arrest her and you let me stand here. That is your bargain with yourself. That is your reconcile.\u201d\n\n\u201cNext time,\u201d Poin said, because sometimes you must say a promise to make a muscle remember. \u201cThere won\u2019t be a rail.\u201d\n\n\u201cNext time,\u201d he said, and the grin was small and made of nothing and she wanted, briefly, to push him with a finger just to witness gravity acting on a man who believed he was immune. He did not grant her the satisfaction of walking away fast. He drifted off as if the city had a current for how men like him traveled. He did not look back. The river did not make a sound that anyone else would have noticed. She put her hands back on the rail the way Ms. Liu put her bowl in the sink and scraped the chair. She counted four and breathed and counted four and breathed. The toy sword in her apartment leaned on its windowsill and pretended to be a talisman. Lafferty sat in a room and thought about rooms. Noah ate peanuts because she had told him to and also because he had forgotten to buy anything else. The ledger did not close. It turned a page and waited to see if anyone would write in a better hand.",
