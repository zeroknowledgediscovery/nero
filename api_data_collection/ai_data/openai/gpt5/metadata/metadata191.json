     "novel_text": "There are ring roads in Basingstoke that never end. They peel around the town like loosened belts\u2014one, two, three\u2014bearing caravans and delivery lorries and the same bus that always smells faintly of oranges. In the wet, the white lines float on the shin of the tarmac and the cars hiss like snakes. In the wet, I would rather vanish.\n\nI kept to the shopfronts that morning, dodging the gutters because the gutters gurgled. A loose downpour had come in off the chalk, and even the pigeons under the eaves looked like they were thinking it over. My name is Orrin Pell. I am a worlock, by blood and by the stubborn habit of staying alive. I am afraid of water.\n\nThe fear is not poetry. It has no shape but the shape of me at six years old, swallowing river, bemused by the cold, bewildered by how long a breath can seem if it is the last. It\u2019s ridiculous and intractable. I can bind cinders into a bird and send it across half a town, I can fold a whisper into a pocket and trade it for a favor, and I cannot cross a footbridge without counting the boards and measuring the distance between my soles and the water and wishing the river would forget I exist.\n\nThere is the River Loddon, which loops like a quiet idea to the east. A scrap of canal, a garden fountain clogged by leaves in October. Rain. The worst of it is the rain, because it laughs at roofs and coats and drops inside your collar with a cold finger and touches your spine like an old friend.\n\nAunt Bet said, \u201cYou\u2019ll be late for graves if you keep dancing along like that,\u201d when I came in to her shop, wet to the edges but not at the middle. I have tricks for that. You make a little thread-thin wall around yourself and the rain splits, uncertain of your body. It\u2019s not much, and it makes the air taste of iron filings, but it keeps the collarbone dry. Aunt Bet pulled a pin from her bun and set it in the jar labeled THISTLES, as if it were a thistle and not a pin.\n\n\u201cWhat graves?\u201d I asked. I peeled my hood back but kept close to the door, where the draft knew me.\n\n\u201cThe boy from Popley you promised to find, or have you forgotten?\u201d She took a broom to a spill of dried herbs on the floor. The labels all had hand-written capitals that leaned to the left, like they were going somewhere without you. Eglantine, rue, skullcap, a whisper of deadly nightshade that we had no license to sell and also sold to no one with a beating heart.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t promise, I was subtly coerced,\u201d I said, because she had put her hand on my head and said, There, now you\u2019re promising. I keep my promises like people keep dogs. A look says: you belong.\n\n\u201cHis mother came twice,\u201d Bet said. \u201cShe left biscuits and a photograph and a story about a gnome that walks the lines at night.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople will do that,\u201d I muttered. I am not a finder of children. I am a mover of luck. When your shop goes cold, I can bring heat to it; when your name turns sour in mouths, I can sweeten it; when you cannot sleep, I can kill the dreams you do not want and leave the ones you do. There are others of us who search\u2014sleek men with rods, women with clear eyes and dogs\u2014but Aunt Bet had accepted the biscuits like contracts and set the picture by my seat.\n\nThe picture was a cropped bit of world in which a boy of nine wore a school jumper and a smile that wasn\u2019t sure of itself. He stood on the edge of Bloswood Lane, it looked like, where the hedges punch up from the earth like fists in summer. On his left wrist, a plaited thread bracelet you could buy from a girl with a cardboard sign outside the Anvil. Leah makes them, the sign might have said. Or maybe Maya. I should have known.\n\n\u201cWhere?\u201d I was already looking for the map inside my head.\n\n\u201cDown by Mill Field. Near the river,\u201d Bet said, and her eyes slid to my collar. They were cloudy in one corner where an old spell had taken root and then died. \u201cBring salt.\u201d\n\n\u201cSalt for what?\u201d\n\n\u201cFor the water,\u201d she said, like one says: Do not forget to bring your lungs.\n\n\u2014 \u2014 \u2014\n\nThere are fields on the east side of the town where the grass leans like it is under an old, slow wind that never quite arrives. We call them Mill Field though the mill\u2019s long gone to photographs and tea towels. The path squelches in winter. In spring there are little flowers that pretend to be brave. A dog barks somewhere you can\u2019t see it. There are always dogs. They know everything and will trade you all of it for a biscuit.\n\nI brought salt; a bright paper packet from the shop and a little tin of rock-salt I use when I make circles I can stand inside and breathe better.\n\nNear the bend where the willows start to throw their hair down over the water, the air was cold in that way that isn\u2019t weather, that is departure. I crouched by the board that said NO SWIMMING A CHILD DROWNED HERE 1973 and traced the wood with a dry finger. I will not touch the water if I can help it. The river was running high and brown and I thought it looked like tea with too much milk, which is to say: like something gentle that will kill you if it likes.\n\n\u201cLeah?\u201d I said, because names are the first line on the page and sometimes if you say them the rest of the story prints itself.\n\n\u201cLeah\u2019s a girl\u2019s name,\u201d said a voice behind me. I started and the salt packet burst in my pocket. I left it there. It felt like carrying a tiny white sky.\n\nThe voice belonged to a man holding a cheap umbrella with a logo for a kitchen company. He wore a coat that had once belonged to someone with money. He had the look that persists in our town, the look of someone who knows the back path to the bypass. He did not show me his hands.\n\n\u201cThat true?\u201d I said. \u201cThen tell me his name.\u201d\n\nHe tilted the umbrella so a foot of rain poured off it and clapped onto the path, a roar I wanted to run from. \u201cDaniel. Dan. He liked boats.\u201d\n\nI swallowed; it was reflexive, it was a swallow at the sound of a word tearing silk inside my head. \u201cAnd who are you?\u201d\n\n\u201cSomebody who doesn\u2019t fancy you putting your nose where an older nose was put and bitten off,\u201d he said, and smiled.\n\n\u201cSay it with your chest,\u201d I suggested, though I kept my eyes at his feet, at the edge of the path, at the place where the mud turned slick and the earth shrugged like a shoulder. I am not a fighter in the way the movies want us to fight, which is to say: always and with knives. I am a worlock. A fist does not obey me. A shadow does. If you can name the wind in a room, you can turn it. If you can sketch the idea of a blade in the air, you can cut paper with it\u2014but not skin, not unless you mean to bleed.\n\nHe bent and picked up a twig and snapped it with theatrical care. \u201cSay it with your chest,\u201d he echoed, and the twig made a sound like my name.\n\n\u201cI have work,\u201d I said. \u201cMove along.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat if I don\u2019t?\u201d\n\n\u201cThen you stand too long and you start to grow moss,\u201d I said levelly, and he snorted and went, because he had been sent to delay, not to fight, and it is a particular man who throws himself into a river of words when he knows he cannot swim.\n\nWhen he was gone, I took the tin of rock-salt out and poured a circle as if I were drawing a halo on the earth for myself. I set my feet inside it. My breath slowed. I counted in a language my grandmother taught me. I counted and with each number spread in my mouth like a leaf. I am a worlock with a fear, not a fear with a brain. Sometimes you say it. Sometimes it listens.\n\n\u201cDan,\u201d I said to the river, \u201cthis is Orrin Pell, I\u2019m a worlock by trade. I am not here to take anything. I\u2019m returning the right to be found.\u201d\n\nRiver water does not answer because it cannot be bothered. But the willows shook their arms a little and the reeds made a dry sound and a fish somewhere turned a thought over. That\u2019s enough. I reached into my coat and drew out the boy\u2019s picture and the plaited bracelet, soaked now, slate-dark. I held them in my palm. I would have given one finger to be wearing gloves but you don\u2019t pass a thread while you\u2019re gloved, it slips.\n\n\u201cWalk with me,\u201d I said. \u201cWalk with me and show me where you walked.\u201d\n\nThe picture grew colder in my hand. The wet has a voice; you have to agree it\u2019s a voice or you\u2019ll miss the words. Shhh, shhh, it went, and there was a bit of laughter, just in the marrow. Something pulled. My right heel lifted and my blood became aware of gravity and the same old iron hook snagged the meat of my lungs as the river\u2019s breath blew over the skin of my face.\n\nI stepped back. The salt circle smudged and closed behind me like a curtain. You don\u2019t know how close your body can come to leaving you until you are called by the thing that made you afraid. The tin slipped from my hand and went into the mud with a sound like a last word.\n\n\u201cNot today,\u201d I said out loud. I had the taste of pennies in my mouth. \u201cNot your way.\u201d\n\nAnother voice said, \u201cHe can\u2019t hear you from where he is, you know.\u201d A woman\u2019s voice, dry. She had stood behind the alder tree perhaps since dawn, very still, waiting. She does that kind of waiting, the kind that reads as patience and is actually economy. She wore a coat the color of rain and hair that moved only if she decided to breathe.\n\n\u201cPeople keep appearing,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost as if we are in a story set in a popular place.\u201d\n\nShe smiled, very little. \u201cDo you want help? It\u2019s too much for you.\u201d\n\nI looked at her and saw the thing only we see; the twist at the edge of her left eye where a lesser binding had been tied for a long time and then scooped off by a rough hand. Worlock. Not mine. Not my family or the next of them. Not the sort who brings luck to a shop. The kind that reads in the raw. She had a glint in her thumb for slicing, for cutting what is tangled quickly.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d I lied. \u201cThank you.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re the Pell boy,\u201d she said, ignoring my lie.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the Pell man. It\u2019s different and it isn\u2019t.\u201d I stooped and picked up my tin from the mud, knocked it against my boot, which was pretending to be leather.\n\n\u201cYou should come away from there. He\u2019s tied to something that breathes,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWho is?\u201d I said, though I knew who.\n\n\u201cAurelian Crowl,\u201d she said, and she watched my mouth when I said the name with her, as if timing our breath. \u201cHe\u2019s got his clever hands on whatever Dan touched last. It widens his reach.\u201d\n\nThe name went through me like a wick catching. I had heard it, in other mouths and other places; whispered and spat and written with biro in a bus shelter that had been scrubbed of every other ink. He belonged to stories that do not end well.\n\n\u201cYou know Crowl?\u201d I tried to make the word a pebble, something to spit out.\n\n\u201cI know the people who are standing in his shade,\u201d she said. \u201cMy name is Elna. I think you should not go further into the mud. I think you\u2019ll die trying, and I don\u2019t have the energy to drag your body out and make the police like me about it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to,\u201d I said and I was not sure until the breath after it whether I had been going to or not. \u201cHow did he take him?\u201d\n\n\u201cA phone game, a test in maths, a poem in his ear that went on and on until he stepped into the long tide and didn\u2019t find the cuff of his mother\u2019s voice. They are all the same story. He is practicing on the small ones because the small ones answer quickest.\u201d Elna\u2019s eyes were flat like slate. \u201cHe has found a way to bind the wet.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood for him,\u201d I said, and heard the shake in my little words. \u201cI\u2019ll\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll bring salt,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019ll wrap the wet. You\u2019ll tie it to the dry.\u201d She glanced at the bracelet in my barred hand. \u201cYou\u2019ll make it speak.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hate it,\u201d I said. It slipped out of my mouth with the easy gait of truth.\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d she said. \u201cCome away. Let me buy you a cup of coffee so you can feel better for five minutes and then worse for a day.\u201d\n\nWe walked back along the path. On the bridge I counted: one, two, three, board, board, six. She did not ask why. She didn\u2019t say my fear out loud the way some people do, as if naming the dog will stop it barking. In the distance the A33 carried its river of metal and smoke.\n\n\u201cDo you work for him?\u201d I asked, as we reached the sign where someone had corrected a spelling mistake with permanent marker and then someone else had added an unnecessary apostrophe because such is civilization.\n\nElna laughed, and the laugh had glass in its edges. \u201cNo. He doesn\u2019t hire people like me. He collects people like me if he wants, and otherwise he points and flames. You\u2019ll hear him before you see him. If you see him he has chosen you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t plan to see him,\u201d I said, but I saw him then as he has been drawn in our circles, by men who forget what restraint is once a quill touches skin: tall and unbent, with the look that comes from a thousand eyes on your back, with hair like the underside of a rooks\u2019 wing and teeth that are not unusual, and a castle behind him of green and soot and glass. It is a castle that stands where castles do not stand: in a place that smells of loam and wet bread and the wind through apple trees. I saw his green. Not the green of growth, which is hungry and warm. The green of velvet that has not been sat on, the green of expensive books you cannot touch, the green of envy, an old coin.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve met him and you lived,\u201d I said. It came out in wonder. I was a little ashamed of that.\n\nElna touched the alder trunk with a reluctant palm. \u201cFor a value of lived. For a value of met. He visits in drafts. He leans in from wherever he is and blows. Somewhere there are trees grown to his height, food that never degrades, a bed with sheets like the backs of swans. He collects life and stacks it so it looks like a mercy. Do you know what men like him hate? Hunger. Not their own. The idea of it. His castle is fed.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe lush,\u201d I said, and thought of water sliding down the inside of a jug.\n\nShe looked at me once, sharply. \u201cYou are afraid of water.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot afraid. I\u2019m\u2014\u201d I stopped, because I will not sip from a lie long enough to forget the taste. \u201cYes,\u201d I said. \u201cWorse than afraid.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have never bred for the right fears,\u201d Elna said. \u201cWe think a worlock should be free of the things that bite the rest, but then we make ourselves into something else, and we fall in love with stupid risks, and the wrong fear is the one that keeps us from dying the clever way. Be grateful, Pell. It will keep you from the river a little while longer.\u201d\n\nWe reached the cafe near the car park where the rain never ends because there is always someone coming out and shaking their coat. Inside smelled of burned milk and new bread. Elna ordered black and I ordered something that would pretend to warm me. We stood under the heater and the man behind the counter leaned on the till and asked, \u201cBusy out?\u201d in the tone people use when they suspect you of being the sort of busy they cannot hold in their hands.\n\n\u201cFrogs on the road,\u201d Elna said, and the man nodded, satisfied.\n\n\u201cWhy tell me?\u201d I said, around the edge of my cup, to Elna. \u201cWhy warn me of someone I will avoid until the bones of me are gone?\u201d\n\nShe stirred her coffee with the end of a packet of sugar and did not open it. \u201cBecause your aunt has traded favors with three different lines for you. Because you are what you are and you look like the sort of quiet someone like him sees as a challenge. Because I dreamed you on a yellow morning with a dog at your heel and a house burning behind you, and I\u2019ve learned to respect the unkindness of certain dreams.\u201d She said it like the weather; this is happening, whether you would prefer it or not.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a dog,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cYou will,\u201d she said, and touched her throat with two fingers, absent, thoughtful. \u201cI have to go. I have\u2014\u201d She stopped and for the first time looked not like a controlled storm but like a person. She touched her pocket with a thumb. \u201cHe\u2019s in there. Sometimes. He speaks through things. Today he found the boiler.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe boiler,\u201d I repeated.\n\n\u201cAt the place I\u2019m staying,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s an old starved villa near the underpass with windows like blinking. He spoke through the boiler in the night; I woke up and the pipes were a throat. The radiator teeth chattered. His voice was so amused. He said, Hello, mouse. He said, Are you ready to come to the green?\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you,\u201d I asked, sick with the right sort of curiosity, \u201ca mouse?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot the way he means,\u201d she said, and put her empty cup down. \u201cDon\u2019t go without calling me. You won\u2019t, but I\u2019m saying it so that later I can think I saved you the same way I\u2019ve failed to save all the others.\u201d\n\n\u201cElna,\u201d I said, \u201cif there\u2019s something that can be done\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s always something that can be done. That\u2019s the trick. Choose wrong and it will look the same as choosing right for seven minutes, sometimes longer.\u201d She brushed her hands and the coffee smell sighed up from her sleeves. \u201cWatch your phone.\u201d\n\nI nodded. She left. The barista looked at me and I looked at the sleeve of my coat and noted a bedraggled feather stuck to the fabric. It moved when I breathed. I plucked it out and put it in my pocket. From outside, the rain finally changed its mind and became drizzle, which to Basingstoke is the same thing only with more local pride.\n\nI would have gone home and wrapped myself in absolute silence if the screen of my phone had not turned a deliberate black and then a slow, unpleasant green, as if touched by algae. The word hello wrote itself across it in lower-case letters as if it were an intimate. It wasn\u2019t, but it pretended. The font had that expensive, quiet look.\n\nMy throat obeyed the old hook again. I set my cup down carefully. The barista said, \u201cNew app?\u201d and I said, \u201cYes.\u201d\n\nhello, wrote the phone, and then, o.\n\n\u201cO,\u201d I said, before I could shut my mouth, and then, \u201cNot today.\u201d\n\no rr in, wrote the phone. i would like to borrow your mouth.\n\n\u201cYou cannot,\u201d I said, and then remembered the man behind the till and added, \u201cI\u2019m practicing for a play.\u201d He said, \u201cGood on you,\u201d which was not a thing men like him usually said to men like me but it was the sort of day when everything pressed its face to the glass.\n\ni am very good at this, wrote the phone.\n\n\u201cGo away,\u201d I said. \u201cGo and harvest frogs.\u201d I have a bad habit of making jokes when something wants to eat me. It\u2019s a talent and it\u2019s going to get me into a coffin.\n\ni could be, wrote the phone, a friend. i could be the man who keeps the rain from the throat of your mother when she forgets her umbrella. i could be the man who promises there will never be another little boy held under, mouth stuffed with brown, heart unhooked. i could be the man who takes you by the hand, o rr in, and says: here is the green. it does not bite. it does not drown. it drinks.\n\n\u201cCrowl,\u201d I breathed, because nobody else would grade me for the error of saying the name.\n\na cilice is for the obedient, wrote the phone, prettily. i do not require obedience from men like you. i require only acknowledgment. i am near. i am nearer. you will come to me when you are ready because we are the same shape in the shadow. be grateful, boy. your life is about to be excellent.\n\nThe screen went still. The green faded back to black, then to my own face in the reflection, rulined by a frown like a bruise. The barista said, under his breath, \u201cWe don\u2019t get much theatre in here, to be honest.\u201d\n\nI made a shape in the air with my fingers that tasted like tin. It is a small thing, this shape; one of the first we are taught. Keep a lock on your breath. It closed my lungs just enough to make me feel like I was holding myself from falling.\n\nAt the doorway, as I went out, Aunt Bet texted: come back. there\u2019s a woman here with a boat ticket and a very bad idea.\n\nI typed, not me not me not me. Then: on my way.\n\n\u2014 \u2014 \u2014\n\nMy flat exists above a charity shop that prioritizes bagged costume jewelry and lamps with histories. You climb two flights and find yourself in a room that seems to be nothing but watches. I have pulled a string across the ceiling and threaded it with onion skins to keep moths from the curtains; I live as if I did not live long enough to bother. But the loophole of comfort: the kettle, the chair. Of course there are books. We are not saints of the word; we are bugs who like to eat pages.\n\nI was not home long enough to admire the damp creeping in the left-hand corner before the bell downstairs clanged. Aunt Bet does not use the bell if she can help it; she sends thought, she yells, she waggles a broom up the stairs. This clang was the insistent hand of someone who thinks time is a table they have set.\n\nI went down and a woman stood on the shop\u2019s brown carpet, shaking her umbrella into a bucket with the sort of vigor that would upset a smaller god. Her hair was cut blunt at her jaw and her mouth was a line she had nursed for years. She held out the ticket like a talisman.\n\n\u201cI need to cross,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cNo boats here,\u201d Aunt Bet said from behind the counter. \u201cWhat you need is a\u2013\u201d\n\n\u201cCrossing,\u201d the woman said, and the word sat in the room like a full stop. \u201cI\u2019ve heard you\u2019re a crossroads place. I brought you payment.\u201d She shook the ticket. It was from the ferry to the Isle of Wight, dated two days from now.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not a crossroads,\u201d Bet said, \u201cwe are a haberdashery with dreams. Also mine. We sell dreams if they can be worn as a hat.\u201d\n\n\u201cI need my son,\u201d the woman said, and looked at me in a way that made me examine my hands. \u201cYou\u2019re the finder.\u201d\n\nI glanced at Bet. \u201cI am,\u201d I said, which was a small theft from myself. \u201cTell me your son\u2019s name.\u201d\n\n\u201cDaniel,\u201d she said. Her mouth loosened. And then, sheepish, \u201cDan.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d I said softly. \u201cI was at the field this morning.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen why isn\u2019t he behind you?\u201d she asked, and then put a hand over her mouth, with the slow horror of someone who has just slapped a stranger in a church. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ve not slept. I would sell the bed he sleeps in, I would sell everything and anything. He liked boats. He did not like water. You know children. He would stand in the garden in the rain and he\u2019d say, Mum, the sky\u2019s spitting on me, and I\u2019d laugh. Why did I laugh?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good line,\u201d I said, and the anger she was carrying turned half a degree and did not point at me anymore.\n\n\u201cShe says she\u2019s going to the island,\u201d Bet put in. \u201cAs if you and I can forbid it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have a room in Shanklin,\u201d the woman said. \u201cMy sister keeps it for me. He\u2019ll go to the beach, he\u2019ll go where it is easy, he\u2019ll walk along the cliffs on those silly little legs that go too fast and then he\u2019ll be gone. Do you know what it is to see your own boy as a blur and not be able to call him back?\u201d\n\n\u201cEvery day,\u201d I said. I am not a father. I remembered instead being a son, that blur of me that my mother chased with bread or scolding, and I felt suddenly cut open by how much she\u2019d run.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d Bet asked the woman.\n\n\u201cKara,\u201d she said. \u201cWith a K. My husband would be here but he is very busy pretending it\u2019ll all be fine. He was always better at that bit.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t deal in boats,\u201d Bet said again as if the repetition would make the river recoil.\n\n\u201cYou deal in other things,\u201d Kara said. \u201cYou wear the word \u2018worlock\u2019 in your bones. You look at me and you see the lines that run from me to the boy to the thing that took him, and you think, If I tug it will drag me skin-first through a hedge. I cannot take your fear away from you. But you can take mine away in pieces. Fifty pounds per piece.\u201d\n\nShe took an envelope from inside her coat. It was thick, not with money but with the sense of money: the smell of it, the memory of it in the paper. People rarely bring me cash in envelopes. They bring me jam sometimes. They bring me family recipes, a pair of earrings, photographs, words in bundles. I work for these. I am not poor the way I might be. I do not know what to do with an envelope fat with notes except take it and feel vulgar.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll do this,\u201d I said, looking at the line Bet\u2019s mouth had become. \u201cNow. Not with boats. With rules.\u201d\n\nKara pressed her hands together. \u201cTell me.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t go to the island,\u201d I said. \u201cIf he pulls you anywhere, you go the opposite way. If your phone goes green, you turn it off. If the boiler in your house starts talking, throw a sheet over it and go outside to laugh very loudly. You do not say his name. You do not give any water in your house the right to speak. You drink from a bottle.\u201d I took a pen and wrote on the back of the ferry ticket. \u201cYou draw this on the inside of your front door with your left hand and you do it twice for luck. You put this salt in a bowl by the sink. You leave your shoes on the mat and you speak to them when you put them back on.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do I say to my shoes?\u201d Kara asked, with an exhaustion that made her voice velvet.\n\n\u201cSay, Thank you for bringing me home,\u201d I said. \u201cIt matters.\u201d I looked up, away from the comfort of instructions. \u201cI will go back to the field. I will go at dusk. I will not let him be unloved there.\u201d\n\nKara cried as if her face had been forced to learn the shape. She clutched the envelope as if it were a baby and then put it, blushing, on the counter and pushed it towards Bet with two fingers. \u201cFifty,\u201d she said. \u201cPer piece.\u201d\n\n\u201cThree pieces,\u201d Bet said briskly, because she has the heart of an anchor in a rag-and-bone ship. \u201cWe will not run you dry.\u201d\n\nKara nodded and wiped her nose and the ticket with her thumb and said, \u201cHe loved trains. I am saying this so you know he will come home to us and then run away from home to be at the station. He would have done that anyway. If I can get him home I will let him do anything he wants.\u201d She looked at me, ferocious. \u201cI will chain him to the couch. Say it into your magic so it knows I meant it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll put it in,\u201d I said, and scribbled on the back of the ticket again: let him run and let him be caught.\n\n\u201cGo,\u201d Bet said to me, low. \u201cBring Elna if you can. She looked dangerous enough to be useful.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not collecting knives,\u201d I said. But my pocket buzzed and the message glowed from a number I had not given my hands permission to recognize: tonight.\n\nIt was signed: E.\n\n\u2014 \u2014 \u2014\n\nAt dusk, the willows were all arms and the river tried to look tired. I brought my circle and a jar with a paper label that said HONEY and held something else, a thick, clear, viscous thing that is made when you take the wet and tell it not to be wet. It\u2019s a charlatan, a performance. It takes practice. The jar felt heavy and smug.\n\nElna came out of the shadow like she had been built there. \u201cHe\u2019s excited,\u201d she said, not greeting and who would need to? Her hair had been tied back with a red cord. It looked like a pulse.\n\n\u201cI brought rules,\u201d I said. \u201cFor the mother. She is brave enough.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe is exactly brave enough,\u201d Elna agreed. \u201cThe way soft animals are brave when the fox enters the field.\u201d\n\n\u201cTell me you brought something to chew on when we are scared,\u201d I said. \u201cI forgot.\u201d\n\nShe handed me a packet of peanuts like a benediction. We stood and the path made its half-moon and the kingfishers refused to be seen. There are also deer in those fields sometimes and once, a year ago, a fox stood in the open and showed me his ribcage. He didn\u2019t run. He didn\u2019t need to.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to put this near the bend,\u201d I said, holding up the jar.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t slip,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI have boots,\u201d I said, which is a sentence that should be placed on my headstone if I ever have one: He had boots. \u201cTalk to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cAbout what?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnything that requires me to be more interested in it than the river.\u201d\n\nShe slid a look at me, and then said, \u201cDo you know how my grandmother used to make cider? She would threaten the apples. She would stand under the tree and she would say, I will not eat you if you are sour. I will grind you and you will be sauce. And then she would whisper to them when they fell\u2014not loud, mind, we are not savages\u2014she would whisper, Thank you. The cider took the fear. It was never sour.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour grandmother was a worlock,\u201d I said, crouching and tilting the jar. The river made its sound in my teeth. I poured a line of clear onto the mud just shy of the water and then drew it across with a bone spoon. The stuff is sticky; it holds. The smell of it is like a thunderstorm trapped in a cupboard and told not to come out.\n\n\u201cMy grandmother was an expert in making bargains with things that could not read. It is the same magic, done sideways,\u201d Elna said. \u201cShe would have liked you if you had arrived with a pie. You did not.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am trying to tell a river to keep its voice down,\u201d I said, hearing the tremor again.\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d she said, and very lightly put her hand to the back of my neck, firm and human. \u201cYou are embarrassing it with your jar, in case you were wondering.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am content to do so,\u201d I said. \u201cI was told to humiliate the wet in front of its friends early in the term.\u201d\n\nThe jar\u2019s line grew under my fingers, made a quiet that the river could not swallow. For a moment the sound around us changed and the air was dry in a way that made my tongue curious. We had made a small room between the bank and the water where a boy might stand and a name might be said without being sucked from his mouth.\n\n\u201cDan,\u201d I said, and the name sat down. \u201cDan. We\u2019re here in the name of the person you loved best and the person you loved second and all the people who gave you biscuits when you weren\u2019t supposed to have them. We\u2019re here to say: Come sideways, not through. Come to the edge of the word you went past. Come to this little dry. You are allowed to be found.\u201d\n\nThe willows did a little gossip. The reeds did a little threat. The river made itself heavy, like a body in a bed that refuses to crack its spine and get up. The world scrolled. Something tugged again, hard, at my heel, and if not for Elna\u2019s hand at my neck\u2014ridiculous, how much a human hand weighs against a river\u2014I might have stumbled.\n\n\u201cShow-off,\u201d she murmured, and I didn\u2019t know if she meant me or the Loddon.\n\nThere was a shape to my left where there had not been a shape. It stood in the little dry between the jar-line and the rushes. He was small because he was small. He had the bones of his face the way boys do just before they change into somebody else. He looked at my jar like he was going to poke a finger in it and then he looked at my face, briskly.\n\n\u201cMum?\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cComing,\u201d I said, and it was a relief that made all my old fears moor somewhere quiet for a second, a breath. \u201cDo you fancy peanuts? It\u2019s a very adult snack.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d the boy said gravely. \u201cI do.\u201d\n\nElna made a sound like a chord. \u201cTell him to stand,\u201d she said. \u201cTell him to think about dryness.\u201d\n\n\u201cStand, Dan,\u201d I said. \u201cThink about the driest thing. Think about toast. Think about a towel in the sun. Think about the chalk in a classroom nobody goes to in August.\u201d\n\nHe wrinkled his nose. \u201cBoring.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d I said. \u201cYou love it.\u201d\n\nHe looked at his feet, and then lifted his left foot, made a show of placing it down just inside the line, put all his weight there, took a breath, moved the other. He crossed, which is a trick that looks like walking but is a bargain with the earth.\n\nWhen he was in the grass, Elna put the peanuts in his hand, which is how it should always be when you return a child: something sweet and salt and for now. I felt the river make a short, furious intake of breath and then I heard the voice of the man I had been asked to fear. He spoke from the reeds like a child who cannot bear to lose alone.\n\noh, he said. how charming.\n\nI set my jaw. It clicked in a way the dentist would disapprove of. \u201cTake your snack and run,\u201d I said to Dan. \u201cRun in exactly the direction you most want to go. Then turn left. Then stop.\u201d\n\nHe nodded. He had a face that would be a heart-breaker if he was given the chance to live to heartbreaks. He ran. He ran as if a fox chased him and his feet knew the map and the grass liked him.\n\nElna held up her hand and the river stopped. It tried, at least, to climb her wrist. Her thumb and forefinger pressed as if on invisible skin. She isn\u2019t stronger than he is; none of us are, I suspect. She is clever in the moment moments arrive. She uses the seconds like knives.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d she said, and the reeds obliged her by stiffening like offended men. We walked back along the path very fast and in no way like running, because we would not give the river the show. Behind us, the wet stepped forward and then back and then forward again. Aurelian Crowl laughed the way people laugh when you have, briefly, been amusing. He had found us and he let us go, because power arranges the luxury of savoring.\n\n\u201cHe saw you,\u201d Elna said, once the car park was in sight and the bins were sitting with their lids up like yawns. \u201cHe will not forget the way your voice sounds.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do not like being hunted,\u201d I said, because understatement is English and I can\u2019t be bothered to be anything else.\n\n\u201cWe hunt,\u201d she said, reminding me, gently. \u201cIt\u2019s what we are.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe hunt our own,\u201d I said. \u201cNo. We hunt what our own hunts.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can argue doctrine another day,\u201d Elna said, with the air of someone who will tell me everything and nothing and can be won with a single right sentence. \u201cI am going to sleep now, if he lets me.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou think he will,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s busy,\u201d she said, and tilted her head to the sky where a low, thick cloud had the shape of a dome, of a ceiling, of a hand. \u201cHe\u2019s building something. He thinks he\u2019s the only one who knows he\u2019s building it, but at least three women in town have felt it in their old hips and three men have written it on the back of their betting slips and thrown them away. He is gathering his green.\u201d\n\nI thought of Kara and her envelope and the ticket with my little lines on it and the baby man who had already wanted to be older and faster and gone. I thought of Aunt Bet\u2019s pin in the thistles jar. I thought of a castle that is not on any map, whose walls are fed by what it takes. In my little flat the onion skins would be restless. I would not sleep, but men like me lie in their beds and practice considering the shape of sleep until it deigns to come by and be seen at the door.\n\n\u201cElna,\u201d I said, and she paused. \u201cThank you.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll have to pay me,\u201d she said. \u201cWith something you don\u2019t mind missing.\u201d\n\nI nodded, because I have something, everyone does, and because I have not yet decided what it is.\n\nAs I climbed my stairs, my phone hummed again. The screen lit not with words but with a little window on a world that had the feel of elsewhere. There were curtains in the frame, heavy and green, and the floor beyond them was layered in rugs, and the air had the stillness of places where men are served. A man passed in front of the lens\u2014no, not a man, something shaped like one, wearing a robe that thought highly of itself. He paused and turned, just enough that I saw the line of his jaw and the pale of his eye. He lifted a hand and some invisible servant brought him a glass. He toasted me, this was for me, he toasted me from the place where he lives and we do not.\n\ni will send for you, wrote Aurelian Crowl, across the picture, as if it were a shag carpet he could write in with his finger. not today. you were brave today. i would like that not to go to waste.\n\nHe let me watch him drink. He let me see him set the glass down on a table that had once been a tree that had once been a forest. Behind him, the window was not a window at all but a wall of leaves, lit softly from within, as if every leaf were a pocket holding a living light and he was stealing it, gently and forever. The rain had stopped. Down on the ring road the cars hissed with old water. I locked my door and leaned my head back against it like a man listening for the sea.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nowhere to ferry,\u201d I said to the empty room. \u201cNot really.\u201d\n\nThe window on the phone went black. My reflection blinked back at me, a little wavery, like I was a man seen through water. I went to the kettle and boiled it, and when the steam rose, I stepped aside. I didn\u2019t let it touch my face. I am not reckless. Not exactly. Not yet. I have boots. I have jars. I have a woman who will hand me peanuts and tell me the right lies. I have a boy who might be sleeping now with his shoes by the door.\n\nAbove the kettle an onion skin trembled. There are omens everywhere, if you like to be toyed with by your own eyes. I made the kind of tea that cannot hurt you and I drank it and it hurt, which is not the tea\u2019s fault. Downstairs, the shop\u2019s door bell chimed for no one. The salt I had spilled in my pocket left a pale, sea-crusted crescent on the wood desk by the window. I decided to leave it there. In the morning I would pretend to be a man with no yearning, who wanted only what was near. In the night, in Basingstoke, the wet didn\u2019t sleep.\n\nIn the night, Aurelian Crowl lay on a bed so soft I could feel it in my spine through the glass of the phone I had turned face down under a book. There was a wind where he was because there is always a wind where things grow. It carried someone\u2019s laughter. He smiled with half his mouth, like a man with a knife in it. He said, because he could, \u201cSoon,\u201d and somewhere, not far enough, three taps like a spoon on a saucer echoed from inside the pipes. I curled on my side and pulled the duvet up like a barricade and swallowed hard and thought of chalk. In my dream I walked on dry land. It mocked me. It moved. I ran. I ran and did not sink, not yet, and behind me a castle whose walls were leaves rose and rose and rose.Morning made a brittle sound in the pipes as if the building had been drinking in its sleep and now regretted it, and for a heartbeat I thought it was him, helloing through the copper. It wasn\u2019t; it was the ordinary misery of an old flat that asks to be forgiven each time you ask it for hot water. I boiled the kettle anyway and watched the steam rope itself toward the ceiling where the onion skins trembled like a line of saints too thin to keep their haloes. Aunt Bet knocked with her knuckles in a rhythm that said I am trying not to worry; I let her in, and she took in the cup, the salt crescent on the desk, the phone facedown on a book about fungi I had meant to give back to the library a month ago, and she said, \u201cDo you want toast?\u201d which in our language meant, Tell me if the green got into your lungs, tell me if your hands are steady, tell me if you think you\u2019re clever or lucky or already dead. I said, \u201cYes,\u201d because we do not make speeches to the person who will give you bread and stand between you and a gust.\n\nKara texted me two words at almost the same time as Bet buttered, The first: here. The second: breathing. She did not add exclamation marks; she was a woman who kept punctuation for bills and notices. I didn\u2019t breathe until the picture came through, a crooked image of a boy under a blanket on a couch I did not know, face turned toward a television that showed a cartoon fox caught in a perpetual stew of cats\u2019 eyes and a saucepan. His feet were dirty in the way that says I have touched the real outside world and come back regardless. His wrist was bare; the plaited thread had come off in my pocket the night before and now sat on my desk like a small caught snake that had decided to be a bracelet. I sent a dot in reply because I do not say congratulations to a mother whose boy has come home wet and sharp with fear; I say, I have more work and it is already under the doors.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll take her money,\u201d Bet said, mouth full, which means she was on my side and against me in the way only family can be. \u201cBut we will not spend it. We will put it in the jar labeled A RAIN FOR ANOTHER DAY and we will wait to know what it was for.\u201d She spread marmalade like a glossy deceit and then stopped, looking at my face, entirely unmagical, entirely aunt. \u201cHe looked you through a window?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe toasted me,\u201d I said, and made a sound like I was laughing because otherwise I might have spat. \u201cWith something pressed from a fruit he coerces. He wrote on the picture as if it were carpet. He told me I was brave.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh dear,\u201d she said, quietly. \u201cHe would enjoy you. He would enjoy you the way a person enjoys a complicated board game on a Sunday, when there is nowhere else to be.\u201d She reached out and pinched my sleeve and I didn\u2019t flinch the way I sometimes do because I knew the pinching wasn\u2019t a spell, it was an old habit from when I was fourteen and slipping like a cup from hands. \u201cYou don\u2019t go alone to things which echo,\u201d she added, as if she were telling me not to forget a scarf.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d I lied, and immediately hated the taste of it. \u201cElna will go in front. She likes the part of the dance where the floor is already moving. She told me he\u2019s building. The old women feel it in their hips, the men on losing streaks write it on slips of paper and throw it away for the pigeons to read.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will feel it when the jars won\u2019t seal,\u201d Bet said, eyes going to the shelf where THISTLES sat between COCKLE and SEAM. \u201cWe will know it when somebody we didn\u2019t invite begins to hum in the refrigerator and the milk sours in hours. The last time I felt a big build I was in bed with your Uncle Dol, and the spring bed sang the middle part of a hymn for three nights. I thought it was romance. It was just a mill being raised without permission two towns over. We went and leaned pepper at it until it went quiet.\u201d\n\nI asked her to hand me the bracelet and the envelope Kara had pushed over the counter, and we settled the question of money the way you settle a cat, by making a place that looked like it wanted it and then not moving when it tried to leave. I wrote a receipt that said, For returning a boy to a mother, paid in fears. I have a file of such things, little lies with my signature that might be needed when my own fears grow teeth and come looking for transactions to nibble. At the bottom of the page I wrote a second line in a language that tastes like old coins and cloves, Elna\u2019s payment clamoring behind my ears like a kettle: Orrin Pell owes. Owing is a string; sometimes it keeps you on the bank.\n\nKara insisted on me coming to hers to return the bracelet, which was not necessary, and completely necessary, and I went because it meant I would see whether the green had put its thumb on their taps. It was a terrace on the north side, a warren of halls that smelled of bleach and biscuits, a hallway where three coats hung like two living people and a coat shaped like the ghost of a larger you. Dan opened the door to me before Kara could, which is usually wrong, and he stood very straight because he saw me as a person who had returned him to himself and a person to be measured. \u201cYou came,\u201d he said, and in that voice was a thing I recognized and wish I didn\u2019t: a boy who has touched a wolf and now walks carefully around all dogs.\n\n\u201cI come when I can be useful,\u201d I said, and he looked at me sideways, amused as only nine can be. The couch had been conquered by his blanket and the television\u2019s fox had fled, a weatherman now describing rain as if it were an inheritance you didn\u2019t know you had. I saw, in the corner by the skirting board, a words-worth of water gathering itself where the plaster had flaked, not quite a leak, more a suggestion. Crowl has a way of pointing at a corner of your life and saying, There, that texture, let us encourage it.\n\nKara made tea she did not drink. She put a bowl of cereal in front of Dan and he ignored it in favor of a packet of crisps and I did not tell her to say anything; when a body comes back from the water you give it salt like a map and sugar like forgiveness. \u201cHe says a man sang him to the river,\u201d she said, matter-of-factly, because she had slept and crying had rearranged her into a person who could speak and listen simultaneously. \u201cNot a song that rhymes. The kind of song that is a counting that never ends. He says it tasted like mint on the first bit and then like old pennies on the second and then like nothing at all. He says\u2014\u201d and here she faltered and put her palm flat on the counter like she was checking if it still existed, \u201che says when he closed his eyes he saw a room full of leaves and a man who was not in the room but everywhere else in the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cI saw the room,\u201d I said. I pushed the bracelet across the table. It had dried and taken on a brown-green. \u201cHe writes in leaves the way you and I write in ink. He builds his words like hedges in winter. Did Dan hear the name for him in the counting?\u201d\n\nKara and Dan both shook their heads, the sort of choreography that happens when you live in the same house long enough to share a set of muscles. \u201cHe didn\u2019t use his name,\u201d Dan said around crisp, crumbs sticking to the corner of his mouth like confetti from a party he did not attend. \u201cHe called me little boatman and little mackerel and once he called me little frog and then he laughed about it.\u201d He frowned at the bracelet and was very brave. \u201cHe said if I knew how much of me was water I wouldn\u2019t pretend to be dry. He said everything gets thirsty in the end. He said\u2014\u201d Here his throat did a reluctant bounce, the sort boys don\u2019t let you see, \u201che said I could go to the green and never be told to brush my teeth again.\u201d\n\n\u201cBrushing your teeth is one of the few magics we allow to be boring,\u201d I said, because there are times you say the least useful, truest thing and watch the body in front of you seize it like a branch. I did not say, We will teach you how to stand where the wet speaks without listening, because he was nine and his mother had a line through her chest, invisible and heavy. I asked to use the bathroom and Kara nodded like she was handing me a shovel for a grave; in houses like this the pipes are the spine and if you touch them wrong your hands come back with someone else\u2019s fingerprints on them.\n\nI tied the bracelet to the tap, thoughtfully, a joke the pipe did not appreciate. I spoke to the drains not as if they were persons but as if they were old horses in winter, and I poured a smear from my second jar, thinner than last night\u2019s, along the inside lip of the sink where the wet licks. The smell rose up like a modest ghost and rested its hand on my shoulder like a relative. The mirror watched me do something I should not be able to do in property that has a mortgage and water rates. In the corner of the mirror my face was a man who would throw himself in front of a tap if it started coughing a name. I cut a hair-thin thread of green from the space just above the plughole, where it was clinging like a cobweb in a house that doesn\u2019t admit to spiders. It came away slow and sly and stuck to the bone of my thumb like it had opinions; I burned it on the hot part of the kettle and it made a noise like air being slapped. The kettle did not know what it had done, which is true of many kettles and men faced with use.\n\nI went back into the kitchen and told Dan to let me see his wrists. He held them out obediently, and because he is what he is and we are what we are, there was a rime of not-water on his left wrist, invisible if you didn\u2019t pay for certain spectacles with a year of your luck. I blew on it and it ran away in the shape of a small, offended fish. \u201cHe left you a gate,\u201d I said to the boy while Kara looked in alarm at nothing at all that she could see. \u201cHe will not be allowed to use it. I have put a stopper in the pipe. It won\u2019t come out unless you pull on it from both sides. Don\u2019t pull on it. If something in the house speaks and you think it is him, make an ugly face with your mouth and stick your tongue out and say, \u2018My name is my mother\u2019s name cut in half and stuck back together by a schoolboy with glue.\u2019 Don\u2019t worry if the grammar is wrong. The wet doesn\u2019t mark papers.\u201d\n\nDan practiced the face, which was miraculous in its unintended rudeness, and then practiced a second time, more miraculous. Kara put her hand to her mouth again and looked simultaneously appalled and very briefly saved; in some houses the first ugly face a child is taught is entirely practical. I left them with a packet of salt and a bad drawing of a window that isn\u2019t a window, taped on the inside of their kitchen door. On the way out I touched the shoes on the mat and said, Thank you for bringing him home, and I felt old for the first time that day, old in the way of someone who has to tell doors to behave.\n\nOn the pavement the rain had dressed down to a sulk and the ring road down the hill made a noise like a man mumbling to himself with a sandwich in his mouth. I took a route that avoided seeing the lake and failed without meaning to; the town\u2019s layout does that to you. Eastrop Park sits like a coin in a palm, the paths lifting toward it without asking anyone\u2019s opinion. The lake has drawn its share of grief and geese, and in summer the family boats go out like little teeth. Today the boats were empty and moored, each hull collecting a thin layer of green. Somebody had given the swans bread shaped like hope and the swans were doing their outrageous best to be cruel about it. I stopped because the fountain in the middle, a sham pillar that coughs water out of its fake mouth, made a new sound. Before, it had only ever been a throat. Now it was practicing vowels.\n\nA small boy with a red coat and a father in a bright jacket were making a ritual of chucking crusts and not looking at one another. The water around the fountain had an oil-slick sheen the color of expensive tea, and every now and then it flashed a sort of velvet at me, which I am fool enough to recognize. I leaned on the rail, ostensibly to look like a man who cannot resist damp masonry, and hummed under my breath an old pub song my grandmother used to hum when she poured vinegar on a burn, an ugly song about a girl who fell in love with a horse and lost a shoe, that to this day I cannot sing around decent people. The fountain faltered in its vowels and went back to coughing like before, as if embarrassed to have been heard, and a pigeon on the rail next to me laughed in the rusty way pigeons do when they approve of magic done by someone else.\n\nThe father glanced over his shoulder and said, \u201cThey\u2019ll bite,\u201d and I said, \u201cThey don\u2019t have teeth,\u201d and he said, \u201cYou haven\u2019t met our one; he\u2019s got a set he borrowed from a dentist.\u201d We smiled at each other in the way two men who are responsible for very different things will smile at a common public space, and I moved on because I do not take boys in red coats from their fathers unless the river is already calling them by pet names.\n\nUnder the underpass the town keeps its second weather. It smells like coins and ghosts in trainers, and the walls bloom in winter with paint that says FURY and LUKE and sometimes a phone number for a woman named D who will change your life for twenty and a walk. It is beautiful in its cruelty, and it is the sort of place that makes men like Crowl lick a finger and hold it up and say, Here. Elna\u2019s borrowed villa had the sort of name that a softened real estate agent would give: The Oaks, The Cedars, a hedge where all the trees have already gone to cupboards. It sat behind a grille like teeth, and the windows blinked in a tired way in the thin afternoon, and when I put my hand on the door it knew me as Not Him and opened with the slow humiliation of a lock that would much rather be paying attention to someone important.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re late to my fear,\u201d Elna called from the kitchen, and when I stepped into the narrow corridor I saw the walls were sweating. Not in a human way; in that way an atmosphere can decide it is bigger than a room. She stood at the sink with the cupboard doors open beneath it and the trap exposed and the pipes making a sound that you should only ever hear in a throat when it is making a plea. She had a loop of copper wire between her teeth. \u201cIf you\u2019ve brought anything that pretends to be dry,\u201d she added conversationally, \u201cnow would be a good time to give me it and go into the garden and look at somebody\u2019s miraculous astroturf for five minutes.\u201d\n\nI went to the sink because there is a part of me that has been engineered to disobey instructions that are meant to save me, and I put my jar next to the soap. \u201cHe thinks this house is his mouth,\u201d I said, which was accurate and not useful, and she hissed around the wire and spat it out into her hand like a coin. \u201cNo, he thinks my sleep is his mouth,\u201d she said, and punched the wire through itself with her thumb as if making a tiny crown. \u201cHe dreamed me last night using the boiler as his ear because he doesn\u2019t understand that a woman can sleep without offering him a story.\u201d\n\nThere are women who I would not touch in the middle of a working, not with a hand, not with a thought. I touched Elna and the room steadied, not because my touch is worth more than hers but because sometimes a body next to your body returns you to what bodies can do. She was cold along the wrist; she did not notice I was holding her until a noise deep in the pipe dropped two octaves and tried to imitate a voice. Crowl has a voice you would laugh at over drinks at a wedding because it is a clich\u00e9 of power, and I am frightened of it and will call it names anyway. He spoke a syllable like a ring dropped in water, and then he told Elna to hiss. She did not. She exhaled in a way I recognized, the exhale that says, I have waited tables and told men to look with their eyes and not their fingers, and nothing in me is going to squeeze for you.\n\n\u201cThis will pinch,\u201d she warned, and slid the copper crown around the pipe\u2019s throat. When it pinched, the house shook, and if you have not been in a place that has shaken with a name rather than a motion, you have not been inside a body when it chooses not to die. She leaned her forehead against the cupboard door like a penitent for two breaths and then straightened. \u201cI will have a cup of something heavy, please,\u201d she said, \u201cheavy with the smell of forever,\u201d and I made tea the way I do when I know exactly how a person takes it and can pretend I do not care if I am wrong. We stood in the kitchen with the pipes and the cheap cupboards and the laminate pretending to be wood. The shape of the room altered. It became hospitable again by degrees, the way a dog will come and put its chin on your knee after it has made you believe it could bite your throat.\n\n\u201cI owe you,\u201d I said, handing her the mug, and the debt sat in my red mouth and looked attractive. \u201cYou asked me for something I didn\u2019t mind missing. I have something. Two somethings, if you will take the first and leave the second for when I have made you a meal that breaks your back with comfort.\u201d\n\nShe took the tea and didn\u2019t drink, just held it between her palms in that way of hers which says I am the sort of person who believes in reheating. \u201cSay them both,\u201d she said, and she was tired and the tired was the sort of tired I respect: not self-pity, but the sort that knows exactly where your body ends and is bored of being forced to go on anyway.\n\n\u201cThe first is a rhyme for stepping over little waters,\u201d I said. \u201cIt is not a powerful rhyme. It is not ancient. I made it when I was twelve and a teacher told me off for being late and I wanted to walk over the gutter that had been a river to me for stiff ten minutes. I say it in my head and my feet do not feel the pull. It goes like a counting trick and it ends on a word that is the name of a sandwich. If I give it to you, it will become yours. My mouth will not know the path of it anymore. My feet will have to find a new way or wait.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will take that,\u201d she said, and did not pretend not to be thrilled. \u201cI will take it because it will help me cross the small. I am arrogant about the big things and they do not always punish me. The small ones hate my arrogance. Possibly because they are small.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe second is\u2014\u201d and here I looked at the ceiling because the words were not smooth, they were bricked, \u201ca thing I say between the numbers, the bit of language my grandmother gave me on a bus when she was knitting and the bus went over a bridge she hadn\u2019t prepared for. It binds the numbers together so that they can be eaten by the next number. I have said it since, and it keeps my lungs from inventing alarms. If I gave you that, I would become worse. I would give him a mapping of my breath in the minutes I am crossing a footbridge with teenagers laughing ahead of me and I am trying not to run. So you cannot have that. But I am telling you it exists, so that when I give you the first thing you will know you are not taking the only rope out of my hands.\u201d\n\nShe drank half the cup in one swallow and set it down like an argument concluded. \u201cGive me the sandwich rhyme,\u201d she said, and I did, speaking it in my mouth like I was tasting a dumb sweet from a tuck shop the school never should have allowed to open. The words left me with that exact cheap sugar ache. My feet felt immediate, bare and ambitious, and I was mildly delighted to be annoyed by them. \u201cOh, that is ugly,\u201d Elna said, pleased. \u201cThat is exactly ugly enough to be useful. It goes nowhere and takes you with. Thank you.\u201d She picked up her mug again and did a little dance you would not have noticed if you weren\u2019t watching the way I was; it was the dance of a person crossing the smallest stream and refusing to be seen doing it.\n\nThe dog came later, after she'd slept under the crown and woken with her hair in new arguments. I had gone outside to look at the square of grass that belonged to no one and everyone, the patch that the council had once given a name to, a name with Park in it, and then changed its mind. It had a bench that had been dedicated to a man named Ted who liked to sit at 3 p.m. and pretend to be unimpressed by schoolchildren. Under the bench there was a heap of old leaf matter and a mouth that breathed. When I sat down, the mouth shuffled and became a dog, medium in every way except eyes. His ears were not matched, and one of them looked like it had been the subject of a conversation with something that had teeth and too little to say. He considered me with the intensity of a person deciding whether to take a job that would require weekends.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be mine later,\u201d I told him, because Elna has her dreams and I have had my share of mornings that begin with a sentence arriving like a telegram. He put his chin on my boot and exhaled in a way that said, Yes, but you will be mine, which is the correct order of things for dogs and men who know their limits. I scratched the place behind his odd ear and he looked at me like I was a poor student learning a trick slowly and he would be paid regardless. \u201cYou have a name you won\u2019t tell me,\u201d I said, and he blinked, which means, yes, I have a name, but it is not the one the woman shouted from the back step. \u201cYou can tell me later,\u201d I said. \u201cYou can tell me when the rain is behaving and the pipes are not full of men.\u201d\n\nAt the end of the afternoon the town put on its orange coat and the ring road again became a belt being tightened; people wanted their dinners, they wanted their screens, they wanted to lie down without thinking of rivers. I went back to the shop to give Aunt Bet the receipt and to sit in the corner under the shelf that holds the old jam jars we don\u2019t put anything in because they remember. She was making a list on a brown paper bag because she had given all the good paper to children who come in and ask for two pages because they are making a zine and what is a zine and will you be in it if we make you a character. \u201cPure caraway, another spool of black the weight of an apple, that man from the Fair Mile wants a bark as sour as his face, he can have hawthorn if he promises to keep his lungs in,\u201d she muttered, and when she looked up her eyes did the old cloudy slide toward my collarbone. \u201cHe is busy,\u201d she said unnecessarily, and I nodded and told her that the fountain had been making a mouth on top of a mouth and that I had insulted it in time.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll need to put something in the park,\u201d she said, and she was already opening a drawer that has no label because it refuses them. \u201cSomething glass they will think is about art. Something that makes the water feel as if it\u2019s already fulfilled. A promise it can sleep beside and forget to keep. I have a bottle that my grandmother saved a lightning in and never let out.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou told me that bottle broke when you were fourteen and dared it into the garden,\u201d I said, because part of my job is to remind her when she is asking the dead to do living work.\n\nShe sniffed. \u201cI said \u2018a bottle,\u2019 not that bottle,\u201d she said, which is the sort of lie old women tell because they know better ways of telling the truth are bad for business. \u201cGo to the train bridge,\u201d she added, as if the thought had lain down flat and been stepped on by another thought and so become practical. \u201cThe boy told his mother about a gnome who walks the lines, and the gnome does, some nights, but tonight I think the gnome will have a friend. You will go and stand under the bridge with a pocket of salt and the name of the gnome in your mouth, and you will ask him if he has been offered a job in a place where the pay is green.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know the gnome\u2019s name,\u201d I said, and she smiled like a knife. \u201cYou do,\u201d she said. \u201cWe all do. We call him by his job. Try that and see who looks down.\u201d\n\nThe Fairfields bridge has a hum that isn\u2019t just trains. All bridges do, but this one remembers being built by men who sang without wanting to sing, and their songs got in the concrete. The underside smells like cigarettes and once, before it was painted over, somebody had drawn a woman with a swan\u2019s neck and a man\u2019s teeth and written under it in marker, MY EX. When I stepped into the space the evening poured itself down my back; it was cold and it had that clean edge it gets in November when the leaves are indecisive and the hedges are honest. I put my hand on the central pillar because there are times when you touch the big thing that holds things up and wait for it to touch you back.\n\n\u201cLinesman,\u201d I said, and my voice sounded like a threat and a plea and a tired joke, all correctly, because I am all three. \u201cTrack-walker. Checker. Man with a lamp. Man with a bag. Long-legged person of the half-warm night. Come and speak to a worse light.\u201d\n\nHe was there before the last word had left my lips, because it isn\u2019t that hard to fetch a man whose name is an occupation and whose occupation is to never be late. He looked like every storybook drawing of a gnome the town had ever produced, which is to say nothing at all like a gnome and exactly like an old man with a back that had been promised an apology and never collected it. He wore hi-vis and a cap that had once been a better cap and boots that were his children and his enemies. His hands remembered a spanner when they were empty. He did not glow until he needed to. He looked down because that is what men like him do. \u201cIf you\u2019re after the boy,\u201d he said without preface, \u201che is home eating crisps and annoying a cartoon.\n\n\u201cI had the honor,\u201d I said, trying not to be polite to a creature that likes to be asked to help and dislikes being told it has already done so. \u201cIf you\u2019ve come to warn me off, you should know I\u2019m not paid by wage.\u201d\n\nHe leaned his hip against a bit of bridge that had been smoothed by a thousand legs in a thousand afternoons. \u201cHe offered me a different lamp,\u201d the linesman said. \u201cHe sent a draft to lie along the tracks and it smelled like apples that have never had a bruise. He sent a woman\u2019s voice to say the kind of thing that makes men think they\u2019re not stupid at all. He offered me a bed against a wall that is all leaves, where no woman would ever turn her back and pretend to sleep because she is not ready to forgive. He told me I would not have to walk alone, because the gnomes would keep time together.\u201d He used the old word himself, with fond insult, because that is how we survive names meant to make us smaller. He pulled a can from his pocket, opened it without asking if I wanted one, and drank. \u201cI told him I cannot walk on a floor that is a lie. He told me he had a real floor, a floor made of forest. I told him, You\u2019ve never fallen on one the way I have if you think that\u2019s soft.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe will ask again,\u201d I said, thinking of green velvet and cups lifted toward my mouth. \u201cHe\u2019ll ask you for a small thing you can afford to give, and you will give it because he will make it look decent to give it. The second time he will ask for something you cannot afford. You will be too polite to point out the change in price.\u201d\n\nThe linesman nodded as if I had quoted a training manual he had written. \u201cHe already asked for my whistle,\u201d he said. \u201cHe said I would not need it where we were going, because we would not use such ugly warnings, because nothing about the moving parts would be surprised.\u201d He took his whistle from his pocket and put it in my hand. It was dented and a bit resentful. \u201cKeep that for me tonight,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you hear a train when the time is wrong, blow it, and I will turn around and come back for whoever\u2019s got their foot stuck in a thought.\u201d He looked me up and down with that cataloging glance old men reserve for young men they do not quite approve of but love anyway. \u201cHe will try you next,\u201d he said simply. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a head that wants to go under an idea and the legs to carry you up to it. Don\u2019t let him tell you you\u2019re joining a union when really he wants the badge on your coat.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am already in a union,\u201d I said, feeling the whistle against my palm like a keystone. \u201cWe are the small union that meets under beds and in back rooms and in the heart of people who haven\u2019t been paid for three months and can still afford to share a sandwich. It is the union of poor planning and good luck. We bring thermoses. We clap when a person is brave even if they are stupid.\u201d\n\nA train went over then, all metal and scream, and we looked at our feet like men look at their own foolishness when it is very loud. When it had gone, the linesman struck a match for no reason and then shook it out. \u201cThere is a culvert at Black Dam,\u201d he said, without prelude. \u201cThere is a mouth in it. He is going to open that mouth. Not all the way. He is not that greedy in public. Just enough to let a boy as high as my spanner walk into it without bending. He will open it at eleven because he respects the clock on the wall, even if he spares none of us elsewise. Put your jar there. Put your salt there. Put your body there if you have to. Make the mouth forget it is a mouth.\u201d He tapped his cap brim in the sort of courtesy that survived three wars and three more endings, and then he was gone because someone up the line had sent him a word, and that word had the shape of a front door.\n\nI took myself to Black Dam after dark with a dog who had decided he loved me enough to supervise but not enough to be seen sitting when I said sit. He trotted ahead of me like a man with a full bladder. The water there is tamed in the way municipal water is tamed, which is to say given clothes and expected to eat with a fork and knife. It lies flat so people can reflect themselves and feel wise. The culvert lives at the edge like the part of the tablecloth you use to wipe a stain pretending nobody will notice. It has a metal grille that has saved more lives than there are names to write down in registers, and it has graffiti that says JAMIE LOVES JAMIE and then a date. The wind off it was wrong; it had that smell of pears in winter, the smell nobody likes because it is too much like a promise.\n\nElna met me there with a coil of red cord in her pocket and her hair tucked up under a hat that had once been a laugh and was now dignity. \u201cHe will pretend to be the other side of polite tonight,\u201d she said, making marks in the air with her hands as if she were knitting with the dark. \u201cHe will say we have mistaken him for a villain. He will say he saves. He will say he offers continuity. He will say he treats hunger like a sin, not a condition. We will not believe him because we have had to be hungry in ways he cannot smell.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo we have time to be clever?\u201d I asked, and she looked at my jar and then at the grille and then at the dog, who was sniffing the bollard as if it were in love with him. \u201cWe have time to be ugly,\u201d she said. \u201cClever takes patience; ugly takes force. Put your line down. Make a scab.\u201d\n\nWe made a scab. I poured and the clear lay along the lip of the culvert and the smell made the hairs on my wrist remember thunderstorms and cousins. There was a moment when the mouth forgot how to be a mouth and became, instead, a notion. You can walk past a notion. You can put up a sign that says nothing in this direction and people will have the decency to believe it if they are not ordered to do otherwise by something with a title. The dog leaned into my thigh so hard it would have been an insult if it wasn\u2019t grace. We whispered names of boys into the cold while the jar set, and the wind did that thing wind does when it wants to be an ally and remembers it has never been invited to dinner. At ten-fifty-nine something put its tongue behind the grille and said, ah. We were ready enough.\n\nHe liked to make an entrance even when he had agreed to pretend he wasn\u2019t there. The first hint was the light from the path lamps bowing toward the water the way men bow to other men when money has come up in conversation at a funeral. The second was the sound of Elna\u2019s hat making a decision to stay on her head regardless. The third was the smell, the velvet again, the library where the books are bound in things that used to be alive and the seating is for men with papers. He did not come in person. He brought a corridor. It ran along the culvert and along the air and along the fence and along the line of my jaw. It was as wide as my fear and as thin as the coin you throw in a charity fountain to pretend you are kind. It had wallpaper you can drink, if your mouth is shrewd. He said my name again and made it sound like a pill.\n\n\u201cNot tonight,\u201d I said, because we had done the work and all that mattered was not making it pretty. \u201cNot through there. Not in your green long hall. Not in any hall at all.\u201d\n\nHe was amused, and his amusement pressed into my chest in the place people call the heart because we have not found a better word yet. oh, he said, and the sound of the word made the grill lean forward. you brought glue. how sweet. there are adult ways to negotiate rivers, little man. there are handshakes. you have brought me a paperweight.\n\n\u201cI have brought you a law,\u201d Elna said, and I have never loved a person more than I loved her then because she said it like she was asking a dog to sit and then praising it when it did. \u201cI have brought you a boundary. I have brought you a child back from the shape of your mouth. You may sit and watch if you like. You may take notes. You may be bored. I will not be performing beyond my contract.\u201d\n\nHe made a door in the corridor as if to prove a point to himself. We did not look at it. The dog did, and then he sneezed and put his head under my hand in a way that said, You can be loved even when you are trying to catch a fish. The water pulled, angry and childish. The scab held. A girl with a phone came along with a boy in a jacket and they saw nothing but two adults with a dog looking at a fence, which is one of the oldest and safest English pastimes. We nodded, because you always nod to the people who are doing their best not to fall in love with each other too hard at twenty-two, and when they had gone the wind changed its mind and the corridor thinned.\n\nHe does not like being told no in public. He is not used to being told no in rooms where he has kept everything damp. He went, and the sudden emptiness he left is a thing you cannot put in a sentence without embarrassing yourself. The air was colder in the way cold can be after a fever. The dog licked my hand and caught the taste of the jar and sneezed again and looked at me like he was going to report me to someone for mild cruelty. Elna laid the last of the cord and tied it off in a sailor\u2019s knot that had refused to be named by sailors, and she said, \u201cHe will come to your house now. He will knock on nothing. He will wait until you brush your teeth and tell you that you don\u2019t have to if you don\u2019t want to. He will make being ten feel like it lasted too long, and being thirty like a coat you had to put on to go into the rain. He will flatter you with the thought that you can be powerful and unhurt. He will make you think you made a mistake not going to him when he asked.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t know how many mistakes I\u2019ve made already,\u201d I said, and the dog leaned on me in agreement. \u201cHe thinks he is the first. He thinks he is the only one with a table and a chair. He thinks he eats alone. He thinks the green belongs to him because he can pronounce the word. He thinks he made luck. He thinks\u2014\u201d and here I faltered in the way a throat does when a promise arrives to be signed, \u201c\u2014he thinks he can make me spend a day without counting planks and then call it freedom.\u201d\n\nWe stood until the eleven-fifteen had gone over and the sound had shaken every coin in my pocket into the same corner as if they had been gathered for counting. We stood until the jar had stopped being itself and become a part of the place that could be left, a friendly lie with a skin and a price. We stood because sometimes the only spell is to not go home yet. Only when the dog had yawned and sat down without me having to say anything too humiliating did we move. Elna put her hand on my shoulder and said, \u201cWe are required to eat something greasy and judgmental now,\u201d and we went and found chips that had been waiting for a night exactly like this.\n\nAt my flat the door had been polite. The onion skins did not rattle and the kettle did not aspire. The phone slept under the book like a small beast in a winter den. When I lifted the book the screen did not go green. It stayed black and showed me a narrow, honest version of my face. I got as far as brushing my teeth and the dog lay in the doorway on the exact line where I trip on days I am too full of myself. He watched me with that old soul expression dogs pick up in houses where men have thought too hard and too wrong for too long. \u201cI won\u2019t go,\u201d I told him, because sometimes you tell a creature with no stake in your nobility the part you can\u2019t tell your own aunt, and he stretched and put his paw over his nose and huffed once as if to say, You\u2019re a slow learner and I like that in men.\n\nThe pipes did their old, tired morning sound at midnight because houses do not respect musicals, and then the room changed pressure. It was subtle, the way the air changes when a person important to you has entered a bar and you cannot see them yet. I felt him, which is not an admission, it is a measurement. He did not speak. He is not a fool. He changed the temperature of the water in the cistern by three degrees and waited for me to go to the toilet so that my body would learn to find him pleasant in a place where it does not generally find anything. I held it like a saint and counted, and the dog snored like an honest man. I did not say the secret between the numbers because I had it and I was saving it. I said the sandwich rhyme and it did nothing because I was not crossing anything, and I grinned for the first time since the bridge because if I do not consider him funny for trying, then the part of me that still imagines a castle and a bed will win. Somewhere else in the building somebody showered, and their water hit their skin, and if he was going to seduce anyone that night it would be them, not me. If I am to be hunted\u2014and dear, I am\u2014I would like to pick the field.\n\nBefore I lay down I wrote a list because lists make the part of me that could otherwise drown look up and swallow. It said: find a better jar. Remember that gifs of cats are not a magic; do not expect them to be. Get the linesman\u2019s whistle back to him before he invents a second and hates the sound of it. Tell Kara to put a bowl of water on the front step with a spoon beside it and a note that says Not for you. Ask Aunt Bet about the bottle that isn\u2019t the bottle. Ask Elna if she has ever seen a man\u2019s shadow leave him and walk into a different room. Buy dog biscuits and pretend you always had them in the house. Practice not touching the water when you want to. Practice touching the dry.\n\nWhen I slept, I slept like a person with a dog within arm\u2019s reach and a whistle near my head and a man in green telling me I would enjoy myself more if I gave him my mouth for a bit. I dreamed a pond with a bottom like a thumb. I dreamed a house made of leaves where every leaf held a little light the size of a coin and he had arranged them by denomination. I dreamed Aunt Bet sitting on the till with a pin in her mouth and saying, \u201cMen like him forget about lint,\u201d and laughing until the whole shop shook and the jars chimed like a morgue for bees. I dreamed Elna in a dress that was paper and scissors both and a boy named Dan running along a platform not because he was leaving but because the trains looked like they might appreciate the respect of somebody trying to be faster than them. In every dream I had my boots, and in one of them, finally, I took them off and my feet did not feel like betrayal. It didn\u2019t last, but the body remembers these things. It will be useful, even if only for seven minutes, which is a lifetime if what you are currently doing is not drowning.",

They peel around the town like loosened belts\u2014one, two, three\u2014bearing caravans and delivery lorries and the same bus that always smells faintly of oranges. In the wet, the white lines float on the shin of the tarmac and the cars hiss like snakes. In the wet, I would rather vanish.\n\nI kept to the shopfronts that morning, dodging the gutters because the gutters gurgled. A loose downpour had come in off the chalk, and even the pigeons under the eaves looked like they were thinking it over. My name is Orrin Pell. I am a worlock, by blood and by the stubborn habit of staying alive. I am afraid of water.\n\nThe fear is not poetry. It has no shape but the shape of me at six years old, swallowing river, bemused by the cold, bewildered by how long a breath can seem if it is the last. It\u2019s ridiculous and intractable. I can bind cinders into a bird and send it across half a town, I can fold a whisper into a pocket and trade it for a favor, and I cannot cross a footbridge without counting the boards and measuring the distance between my soles and the water and wishing the river would forget I exist.\n\nThere is the River Loddon, which loops like a quiet idea to the east. A scrap of canal, a garden fountain clogged by leaves in October. Rain. The worst of it is the rain, because it laughs at roofs and coats and drops inside your collar with a cold finger and touches your spine like an old friend.\n\nAunt Bet said, \u201cYou\u2019ll be late for graves if you keep dancing along like that,\u201d when I came in to her shop, wet to the edges but not at the middle. I have tricks for that. You make a little thread-thin wall around yourself and the rain splits, uncertain of your body. It\u2019s not much, and it makes the air taste of iron filings, but it keeps the collarbone dry. Aunt Bet pulled a pin from her bun and set it in the jar labeled THISTLES, as if it were a thistle and not a pin.\n\n\u201cWhat graves?\u201d I asked. I peeled my hood back but kept close to the door, where the draft knew me.\n\n\u201cThe boy from Popley you promised to find, or have you forgotten?\u201d She took a broom to a spill of dried herbs on the floor. The labels all had hand-written capitals that leaned to the left, like they were going somewhere without you. Eglantine, rue, skullcap, a whisper of deadly nightshade that we had no license to sell and also sold to no one with a beating heart.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t promise, I was subtly coerced,\u201d I said, because she had put her hand on my head and said, There, now you\u2019re promising. I keep my promises like people keep dogs. A look says: you belong.\n\n\u201cHis mother came twice,\u201d Bet said. \u201cShe left biscuits and a photograph and a story about a gnome that walks the lines at night.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople will do that,\u201d I muttered. I am not a finder of children. I am a mover of luck. When your shop goes cold, I can bring heat to it; when your name turns sour in mouths, I can sweeten it; when you cannot sleep, I can kill the dreams you do not want and leave the ones you do. There are others of us who search\u2014sleek men with rods, women with clear eyes and dogs\u2014but Aunt Bet had accepted the biscuits like contracts and set the picture by my seat.\n\nThe picture was a cropped bit of world in which a boy of nine wore a school jumper and a smile that wasn\u2019t sure of itself. He stood on the edge of Bloswood Lane, it looked like, where the hedges punch up from the earth like fists in summer. On his left wrist, a plaited thread bracelet you could buy from a girl with a cardboard sign outside the Anvil. Leah makes them, the sign might have said. Or maybe Maya. I should have known.\n\n\u201cWhere?\u201d I was already looking for the map inside my head.\n\n\u201cDown by Mill Field. Near the river,\u201d Bet said, and her eyes slid to my collar. They were cloudy in one corner where an old spell had taken root and then died. \u201cBring salt.\u201d\n\n\u201cSalt for what?\u201d\n\n\u201cFor the water,\u201d she said, like one says: Do not forget to bring your lungs.\n\n\u2014 \u2014 \u2014\n\nThere are fields on the east side of the town where the grass leans like it is under an old, slow wind that never quite arrives. We call them Mill Field though the mill\u2019s long gone to photographs and tea towels. The path squelches in winter. In spring there are little flowers that pretend to be brave. A dog barks somewhere you can\u2019t see it. There are always dogs. They know everything and will trade you all of it for a biscuit.\n\nI brought salt; a bright paper packet from the shop and a little tin of rock-salt I use when I make circles I can stand inside and breathe better.\n\nNear the bend where the willows start to throw their hair down over the water, the air was cold in that way that isn\u2019t weather, that is departure. I crouched by the board that said NO SWIMMING A CHILD DROWNED HERE 1973 and traced the wood with a dry finger. I will not touch the water if I can help it. The river was running high and brown and I thought it looked like tea with too much milk, which is to say: like something gentle that will kill you if it likes.\n\n\u201cLeah?\u201d I said, because names are the first line on the page and sometimes if you say them the rest of the story prints itself.\n\n\u201cLeah\u2019s a girl\u2019s name,\u201d said a voice behind me. I started and the salt packet burst in my pocket. I left it there. It felt like carrying a tiny white sky.\n\nThe voice belonged to a man holding a cheap umbrella with a logo for a kitchen company. He wore a coat that had once belonged to someone with money. He had the look that persists in our town, the look of someone who knows the back path to the bypass. He did not show me his hands.\n\n\u201cThat true?\u201d I said. \u201cThen tell me his name.\u201d\n\nHe tilted the umbrella so a foot of rain poured off it and clapped onto the path, a roar I wanted to run from. \u201cDaniel. Dan. He liked boats.\u201d\n\nI swallowed; it was reflexive, it was a swallow at the sound of a word tearing silk inside my head. \u201cAnd who are you?\u201d\n\n\u201cSomebody who doesn\u2019t fancy you putting your nose where an older nose was put and bitten off,\u201d he said, and smiled.\n\n\u201cSay it with your chest,\u201d I suggested, though I kept my eyes at his feet, at the edge of the path, at the place where the mud turned slick and the earth shrugged like a shoulder. I am not a fighter in the way the movies want us to fight, which is to say: always and with knives. I am a worlock. A fist does not obey me. A shadow does. If you can name the wind in a room, you can turn it. If you can sketch the idea of a blade in the air, you can cut paper with it\u2014but not skin, not unless you mean to bleed.\n\nHe bent and picked up a twig and snapped it with theatrical care. \u201cSay it with your chest,\u201d he echoed, and the twig made a sound like my name.\n\n\u201cI have work,\u201d I said. \u201cMove along.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat if I don\u2019t?\u201d\n\n\u201cThen you stand too long and you start to grow moss,\u201d I said levelly, and he snorted and went, because he had been sent to delay, not to fight, and it is a particular man who throws himself into a river of words when he knows he cannot swim.\n\nWhen he was gone, I took the tin of rock-salt out and poured a circle as if I were drawing a halo on the earth for myself. I set my feet inside it. My breath slowed. I counted in a language my grandmother taught me. I counted and with each number spread in my mouth like a leaf. I am a worlock with a fear, not a fear with a brain. Sometimes you say it. Sometimes it listens.\n\n\u201cDan,\u201d I said to the river, \u201cthis is Orrin Pell, I\u2019m a worlock by trade. I am not here to take anything. I\u2019m returning the right to be found.\u201d\n\nRiver water does not answer because it cannot be bothered. But the willows shook their arms a little and the reeds made a dry sound and a fish somewhere turned a thought over. That\u2019s enough. I reached into my coat and drew out the boy\u2019s picture and the plaited bracelet, soaked now, slate-dark. I held them in my palm. I would have given one finger to be wearing gloves but you don\u2019t pass a thread while you\u2019re gloved, it slips.\n\n\u201cWalk with me,\u201d I said. \u201cWalk with me and show me where you walked.\u201d\n\nThe picture grew colder in my hand. The wet has a voice; you have to agree it\u2019s a voice or you\u2019ll miss the words. Shhh, shhh, it went, and there was a bit of laughter, just in the marrow. Something pulled. My right heel lifted and my blood became aware of gravity and the same old iron hook snagged the meat of my lungs as the river\u2019s breath blew over the skin of my face.\n\nI stepped back. The salt circle smudged and closed behind me like a curtain. You don\u2019t know how close your body can come to leaving you until you are called by the thing that made you afraid. The tin slipped from my hand and went into the mud with a sound like a last word.\n\n\u201cNot today,\u201d I said out loud. I had the taste of pennies in my mouth. \u201cNot your way.\u201d\n\nAnother voice said, \u201cHe can\u2019t hear you from where he is, you know.\u201d A woman\u2019s voice, dry. She had stood behind the alder tree perhaps since dawn, very still, waiting. She does that kind of waiting, the kind that reads as patience and is actually economy. She wore a coat the color of rain and hair that moved only if she decided to breathe.\n\n\u201cPeople keep appearing,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost as if we are in a story set in a popular place.\u201d\n\nShe smiled, very little. \u201cDo you want help? It\u2019s too much for you.\u201d\n\nI looked at her and saw the thing only we see; the twist at the edge of her left eye where a lesser binding had been tied for a long time and then scooped off by a rough hand. Worlock. Not mine. Not my family or the next of them. Not the sort who brings luck to a shop. The kind that reads in the raw. She had a glint in her thumb for slicing, for cutting what is tangled quickly.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d I lied. \u201cThank you.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re the Pell boy,\u201d she said, ignoring my lie.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the Pell man. It\u2019s different and it isn\u2019t.\u201d I stooped and picked up my tin from the mud, knocked it against my boot, which was pretending to be leather.\n\n\u201cYou should come away from there. He\u2019s tied to something that breathes,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWho is?\u201d I said, though I knew who.\n\n\u201cAurelian Crowl,\u201d she said, and she watched my mouth when I said the name with her, as if timing our breath. \u201cHe\u2019s got his clever hands on whatever Dan touched last. It widens his reach.\u201d\n\nThe name went through me like a wick catching. I had heard it, in other mouths and other places; whispered and spat and written with biro in a bus shelter that had been scrubbed of every other ink. He belonged to stories that do not end well.\n\n\u201cYou know Crowl?\u201d I tried to make the word a pebble, something to spit out.\n\n\u201cI know the people who are standing in his shade,\u201d she said. \u201cMy name is Elna. I think you should not go further into the mud. I think you\u2019ll die trying, and I don\u2019t have the energy to drag your body out and make the police like me about it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to,\u201d I said and I was not sure until the breath after it whether I had been going to or not. \u201cHow did he take him?\u201d\n\n\u201cA phone game, a test in maths, a poem in his ear that went on and on until he stepped into the long tide and didn\u2019t find the cuff of his mother\u2019s voice. They are all the same story. He is practicing on the small ones because the small ones answer quickest.\u201d Elna\u2019s eyes were flat like slate. \u201cHe has found a way to bind the wet.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood for him,\u201d I said, and heard the shake in my little words. \u201cI\u2019ll\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll bring salt,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019ll wrap the wet. You\u2019ll tie it to the dry.\u201d She glanced at the bracelet in my barred hand. \u201cYou\u2019ll make it speak.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hate it,\u201d I said. It slipped out of my mouth with the easy gait of truth.\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d she said. \u201cCome away. Let me buy you a cup of coffee so you can feel better for five minutes and then worse for a day.\u201d\n\nWe walked back along the path. On the bridge I counted: one, two, three, board, board, six. She did not ask why. She didn\u2019t say my fear out loud the way some people do, as if naming the dog will stop it barking. In the distance the A33 carried its river of metal and smoke.\n\n\u201cDo you work for him?\u201d I asked, as we reached the sign where someone had corrected a spelling mistake with permanent marker and then someone else had added an unnecessary apostrophe because such is civilization.\n\nElna laughed, and the laugh had glass in its edges. \u201cNo. He doesn\u2019t hire people like me. He collects people like me if he wants, and otherwise he points and flames. You\u2019ll hear him before you see him. If you see him he has chosen you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t plan to see him,\u201d I said, but I saw him then as he has been drawn in our circles, by men who forget what restraint is once a quill touches skin: tall and unbent, with the look that comes from a thousand eyes on your back, with hair like the underside of a rooks\u2019 wing and teeth that are not unusual, and a castle behind him of green and soot and glass. It is a castle that stands where castles do not stand: in a place that smells of loam and wet bread and the wind through apple trees. I saw his green. Not the green of growth, which is hungry and warm. The green of velvet that has not been sat on, the green of expensive books you cannot touch, the green of envy, an old coin.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve met him and you lived,\u201d I said. It came out in wonder. I was a little ashamed of that.\n\nElna touched the alder trunk with a reluctant palm. \u201cFor a value of lived. For a value of met. He visits in drafts. He leans in from wherever he is and blows. Somewhere there are trees grown to his height, food that never degrades, a bed with sheets like the backs of swans. He collects life and stacks it so it looks like a mercy. Do you know what men like him hate? Hunger. Not their own. The idea of it. His castle is fed.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe lush,\u201d I said, and thought of water sliding down the inside of a jug.\n\nShe looked at me once, sharply. \u201cYou are afraid of water.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot afraid. I\u2019m\u2014\u201d I stopped, because I will not sip from a lie long enough to forget the taste. \u201cYes,\u201d I said. \u201cWorse than afraid.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have never bred for the right fears,\u201d Elna said. \u201cWe think a worlock should be free of the things that bite the rest, but then we make ourselves into something else, and we fall in love with stupid risks, and the wrong fear is the one that keeps us from dying the clever way. Be grateful, Pell. It will keep you from the river a little while longer.\u201d\n\nWe reached the cafe near the car park where the rain never ends because there is always someone coming out and shaking their coat. Inside smelled of burned milk and new bread. Elna ordered black and I ordered something that would pretend to warm me. We stood under the heater and the man behind the counter leaned on the till and asked, \u201cBusy out?\u201d in the tone people use when they suspect you of being the sort of busy they cannot hold in their hands.\n\n\u201cFrogs on the road,\u201d Elna said, and the man nodded, satisfied.\n\n\u201cWhy tell me?\u201d I said, around the edge of my cup, to Elna. \u201cWhy warn me of someone I will avoid until the bones of me are gone?\u201d\n\nShe stirred her coffee with the end of a packet of sugar and did not open it. \u201cBecause your aunt has traded favors with three different lines for you. Because you are what you are and you look like the sort of quiet someone like him sees as a challenge. Because I dreamed you on a yellow morning with a dog at your heel and a house burning behind you, and I\u2019ve learned to respect the unkindness of certain dreams.\u201d She said it like the weather; this is happening, whether you would prefer it or not.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a dog,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cYou will,\u201d she said, and touched her throat with two fingers, absent, thoughtful. \u201cI have to go. I have\u2014\u201d She stopped and for the first time looked not like a controlled storm but like a person. She touched her pocket with a thumb. \u201cHe\u2019s in there. Sometimes. He speaks through things. Today he found the boiler.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe boiler,\u201d I repeated.\n\n\u201cAt the place I\u2019m staying,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s an old starved villa near the underpass with windows like blinking. He spoke through the boiler in the night; I woke up and the pipes were a throat. The radiator teeth chattered. His voice was so amused. He said, Hello, mouse. He said, Are you ready to come to the green?\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you,\u201d I asked, sick with the right sort of curiosity, \u201ca mouse?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot the way he means,\u201d she said, and put her empty cup down. \u201cDon\u2019t go without calling me. You won\u2019t, but I\u2019m saying it so that later I can think I saved you the same way I\u2019ve failed to save all the others.\u201d\n\n\u201cElna,\u201d I said, \u201cif there\u2019s something that can be done\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s always something that can be done. That\u2019s the trick. Choose wrong and it will look the same as choosing right for seven minutes, sometimes longer.\u201d She brushed her hands and the coffee smell sighed up from her sleeves. \u201cWatch your phone.\u201d\n\nI nodded. She left. The barista looked at me and I looked at the sleeve of my coat and noted a bedraggled feather stuck to the fabric. It moved when I breathed. I plucked it out and put it in my pocket. From outside, the rain finally changed its mind and became drizzle, which to Basingstoke is the same thing only with more local pride.\n\nI would have gone home and wrapped myself in absolute silence if the screen of my phone had not turned a deliberate black and then a slow, unpleasant green, as if touched by algae. The word hello wrote itself across it in lower-case letters as if it were an intimate. It wasn\u2019t, but it pretended. The font had that expensive, quiet look.\n\nMy throat obeyed the old hook again. I set my cup down carefully. The barista said, \u201cNew app?\u201d and I said, \u201cYes.\u201d\n\nhello, wrote the phone, and then, o.\n\n\u201cO,\u201d I said, before I could shut my mouth, and then, \u201cNot today.\u201d\n\no rr in, wrote the phone. i would like to borrow your mouth.\n\n\u201cYou cannot,\u201d I said, and then remembered the man behind the till and added, \u201cI\u2019m practicing for a play.\u201d He said, \u201cGood on you,\u201d which was not a thing men like him usually said to men like me but it was the sort of day when everything pressed its face to the glass.\n\ni am very good at this, wrote the phone.\n\n\u201cGo away,\u201d I said. \u201cGo and harvest frogs.\u201d I have a bad habit of making jokes when something wants to eat me. It\u2019s a talent and it\u2019s going to get me into a coffin.\n\ni could be, wrote the phone, a friend. i could be the man who keeps the rain from the throat of your mother when she forgets her umbrella. i could be the man who promises there will never be another little boy held under, mouth stuffed with brown, heart unhooked. i could be the man who takes you by the hand, o rr in, and says: here is the green. it does not bite. it does not drown. it drinks.\n\n\u201cCrowl,\u201d I breathed, because nobody else would grade me for the error of saying the name.\n\na cilice is for the obedient, wrote the phone, prettily. i do not require obedience from men like you. i require only acknowledgment. i am near. i am nearer. you will come to me when you are ready because we are the same shape in the shadow. be grateful, boy. your life is about to be excellent.\n\nThe screen went still. The green faded back to black, then to my own face in the reflection, rulined by a frown like a bruise. The barista said, under his breath, \u201cWe don\u2019t get much theatre in here, to be honest.\u201d\n\nI made a shape in the air with my fingers that tasted like tin. It is a small thing, this shape; one of the first we are taught. Keep a lock on your breath. It closed my lungs just enough to make me feel like I was holding myself from falling.\n\nAt the doorway, as I went out, Aunt Bet texted: come back. there\u2019s a woman here with a boat ticket and a very bad idea.\n\nI typed, not me not me not me. Then: on my way.\n\n\u2014 \u2014 \u2014\n\nMy flat exists above a charity shop that prioritizes bagged costume jewelry and lamps with histories. You climb two flights and find yourself in a room that seems to be nothing but watches. I have pulled a string across the ceiling and threaded it with onion skins to keep moths from the curtains; I live as if I did not live long enough to bother. But the loophole of comfort: the kettle, the chair. Of course there are books. We are not saints of the word; we are bugs who like to eat pages.\n\nI was not home long enough to admire the damp creeping in the left-hand corner before the bell downstairs clanged. Aunt Bet does not use the bell if she can help it; she sends thought, she yells, she waggles a broom up the stairs. This clang was the insistent hand of someone who thinks time is a table they have set.\n\nI went down and a woman stood on the shop\u2019s brown carpet, shaking her umbrella into a bucket with the sort of vigor that would upset a smaller god. Her hair was cut blunt at her jaw and her mouth was a line she had nursed for years. She held out the ticket like a talisman.\n\n\u201cI need to cross,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cNo boats here,\u201d Aunt Bet said from behind the counter. \u201cWhat you need is a\u2013\u201d\n\n\u201cCrossing,\u201d the woman said, and the word sat in the room like a full stop. \u201cI\u2019ve heard you\u2019re a crossroads place. I brought you payment.\u201d She shook the ticket. It was from the ferry to the Isle of Wight, dated two days from now.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not a crossroads,\u201d Bet said, \u201cwe are a haberdashery with dreams. Also mine. We sell dreams if they can be worn as a hat.\u201d\n\n\u201cI need my son,\u201d the woman said, and looked at me in a way that made me examine my hands. \u201cYou\u2019re the finder.\u201d\n\nI glanced at Bet. \u201cI am,\u201d I said, which was a small theft from myself. \u201cTell me your son\u2019s name.\u201d\n\n\u201cDaniel,\u201d she said. Her mouth loosened. And then, sheepish, \u201cDan.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d I said softly. \u201cI was at the field this morning.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen why isn\u2019t he behind you?\u201d she asked, and then put a hand over her mouth, with the slow horror of someone who has just slapped a stranger in a church. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ve not slept. I would sell the bed he sleeps in, I would sell everything and anything. He liked boats. He did not like water. You know children. He would stand in the garden in the rain and he\u2019d say, Mum, the sky\u2019s spitting on me, and I\u2019d laugh. Why did I laugh?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good line,\u201d I said, and the anger she was carrying turned half a degree and did not point at me anymore.\n\n\u201cShe says she\u2019s going to the island,\u201d Bet put in. \u201cAs if you and I can forbid it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have a room in Shanklin,\u201d the woman said. \u201cMy sister keeps it for me. He\u2019ll go to the beach, he\u2019ll go where it is easy, he\u2019ll walk along the cliffs on those silly little legs that go too fast and then he\u2019ll be gone. Do you know what it is to see your own boy as a blur and not be able to call him back?\u201d\n\n\u201cEvery day,\u201d I said. I am not a father. I remembered instead being a son, that blur of me that my mother chased with bread or scolding, and I felt suddenly cut open by how much she\u2019d run.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d Bet asked the woman.\n\n\u201cKara,\u201d she said. \u201cWith a K. My husband would be here but he is very busy pretending it\u2019ll all be fine. He was always better at that bit.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t deal in boats,\u201d Bet said again as if the repetition would make the river recoil.\n\n\u201cYou deal in other things,\u201d Kara said. \u201cYou wear the word \u2018worlock\u2019 in your bones. You look at me and you see the lines that run from me to the boy to the thing that took him, and you think, If I tug it will drag me skin-first through a hedge. I cannot take your fear away from you. But you can take mine away in pieces. Fifty pounds per piece.\u201d\n\nShe took an envelope from inside her coat. It was thick, not with money but with the sense of money: the smell of it, the memory of it in the paper. People rarely bring me cash in envelopes. They bring me jam sometimes. They bring me family recipes, a pair of earrings, photographs, words in bundles. I work for these. I am not poor the way I might be. I do not know what to do with an envelope fat with notes except take it and feel vulgar.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll do this,\u201d I said, looking at the line Bet\u2019s mouth had become. \u201cNow. Not with boats. With rules.\u201d\n\nKara pressed her hands together. \u201cTell me.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t go to the island,\u201d I said. \u201cIf he pulls you anywhere, you go the opposite way. If your phone goes green, you turn it off. If the boiler in your house starts talking, throw a sheet over it and go outside to laugh very loudly. You do not say his name. You do not give any water in your house the right to speak. You drink from a bottle.\u201d I took a pen and wrote on the back of the ferry ticket. \u201cYou draw this on the inside of your front door with your left hand and you do it twice for luck. You put this salt in a bowl by the sink. You leave your shoes on the mat and you speak to them when you put them back on.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do I say to my shoes?\u201d Kara asked, with an exhaustion that made her voice velvet.\n\n\u201cSay, Thank you for bringing me home,\u201d I said. \u201cIt matters.\u201d I looked up, away from the comfort of instructions. \u201cI will go back to the field. I will go at dusk. I will not let him be unloved there.\u201d\n\nKara cried as if her face had been forced to learn the shape. She clutched the envelope as if it were a baby and then put it, blushing, on the counter and pushed it towards Bet with two fingers. \u201cFifty,\u201d she said. \u201cPer piece.\u201d\n\n\u201cThree pieces,\u201d Bet said briskly, because she has the heart of an anchor in a rag-and-bone ship. \u201cWe will not run you dry.\u201d\n\nKara nodded and wiped her nose and the ticket with her thumb and said, \u201cHe loved trains. I am saying this so you know he will come home to us and then run away from home to be at the station. He would have done that anyway. If I can get him home I will let him do anything he wants.\u201d She looked at me, ferocious. \u201cI will chain him to the couch. Say it into your magic so it knows I meant it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll put it in,\u201d I said, and scribbled on the back of the ticket again: let him run and let him be caught.\n\n\u201cGo,\u201d Bet said to me, low. \u201cBring Elna if you can. She looked dangerous enough to be useful.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not collecting knives,\u201d I said. But my pocket buzzed and the message glowed from a number I had not given my hands permission to recognize: tonight.\n\nIt was signed: E.\n\n\u2014 \u2014 \u2014\n\nAt dusk, the willows were all arms and the river tried to look tired. I brought my circle and a jar with a paper label that said HONEY and held something else, a thick, clear, viscous thing that is made when you take the wet and tell it not to be wet. It\u2019s a charlatan, a performance. It takes practice. The jar felt heavy and smug.\n\nElna came out of the shadow like she had been built there. \u201cHe\u2019s excited,\u201d she said, not greeting and who would need to? Her hair had been tied back with a red cord. It looked like a pulse.\n\n\u201cI brought rules,\u201d I said. \u201cFor the mother. She is brave enough.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe is exactly brave enough,\u201d Elna agreed. \u201cThe way soft animals are brave when the fox enters the field.\u201d\n\n\u201cTell me you brought something to chew on when we are scared,\u201d I said. \u201cI forgot.\u201d\n\nShe handed me a packet of peanuts like a benediction. We stood and the path made its half-moon and the kingfishers refused to be seen. There are also deer in those fields sometimes and once, a year ago, a fox stood in the open and showed me his ribcage. He didn\u2019t run. He didn\u2019t need to.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to put this near the bend,\u201d I said, holding up the jar.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t slip,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI have boots,\u201d I said, which is a sentence that should be placed on my headstone if I ever have one: He had boots. \u201cTalk to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cAbout what?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnything that requires me to be more interested in it than the river.\u201d\n\nShe slid a look at me, and then said, \u201cDo you know how my grandmother used to make cider? She would threaten the apples. She would stand under the tree and she would say, I will not eat you if you are sour. I will grind you and you will be sauce. And then she would whisper to them when they fell\u2014not loud, mind, we are not savages\u2014she would whisper, Thank you. The cider took the fear. It was never sour.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour grandmother was a worlock,\u201d I said, crouching and tilting the jar. The river made its sound in my teeth. I poured a line of clear onto the mud just shy of the water and then drew it across with a bone spoon. The stuff is sticky; it holds. The smell of it is like a thunderstorm trapped in a cupboard and told not to come out.\n\n\u201cMy grandmother was an expert in making bargains with things that could not read. It is the same magic, done sideways,\u201d Elna said. \u201cShe would have liked you if you had arrived with a pie. You did not.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am trying to tell a river to keep its voice down,\u201d I said, hearing the tremor again.\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d she said, and very lightly put her hand to the back of my neck, firm and human. \u201cYou are embarrassing it with your jar, in case you were wondering.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am content to do so,\u201d I said. \u201cI was told to humiliate the wet in front of its friends early in the term.\u201d\n\nThe jar\u2019s line grew under my fingers, made a quiet that the river could not swallow. For a moment the sound around us changed and the air was dry in a way that made my tongue curious. We had made a small room between the bank and the water where a boy might stand and a name might be said without being sucked from his mouth.\n\n\u201cDan,\u201d I said, and the name sat down. \u201cDan. We\u2019re here in the name of the person you loved best and the person you loved second and all the people who gave you biscuits when you weren\u2019t supposed to have them. We\u2019re here to say: Come sideways, not through. Come to the edge of the word you went past. Come to this little dry. You are allowed to be found.\u201d\n\nThe willows did a little gossip. The reeds did a little threat. The river made itself heavy, like a body in a bed that refuses to crack its spine and get up. The world scrolled. Something tugged again, hard, at my heel, and if not for Elna\u2019s hand at my neck\u2014ridiculous, how much a human hand weighs against a river\u2014I might have stumbled.\n\n\u201cShow-off,\u201d she murmured, and I didn\u2019t know if she meant me or the Loddon.\n\nThere was a shape to my left where there had not been a shape. It stood in the little dry between the jar-line and the rushes. He was small because he was small. He had the bones of his face the way boys do just before they change into somebody else. He looked at my jar like he was going to poke a finger in it and then he looked at my face, briskly.\n\n\u201cMum?\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cComing,\u201d I said, and it was a relief that made all my old fears moor somewhere quiet for a second, a breath. \u201cDo you fancy peanuts? It\u2019s a very adult snack.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d the boy said gravely. \u201cI do.\u201d\n\nElna made a sound like a chord. \u201cTell him to stand,\u201d she said. \u201cTell him to think about dryness.\u201d\n\n\u201cStand, Dan,\u201d I said. \u201cThink about the driest thing. Think about toast. Think about a towel in the sun. Think about the chalk in a classroom nobody goes to in August.\u201d\n\nHe wrinkled his nose. \u201cBoring.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d I said. \u201cYou love it.\u201d\n\nHe looked at his feet, and then lifted his left foot, made a show of placing it down just inside the line, put all his weight there, took a breath, moved the other. He crossed, which is a trick that looks like walking but is a bargain with the earth.\n\nWhen he was in the grass, Elna put the peanuts in his hand, which is how it should always be when you return a child: something sweet and salt and for now. I felt the river make a short, furious intake of breath and then I heard the voice of the man I had been asked to fear. He spoke from the reeds like a child who cannot bear to lose alone.\n\noh, he said. how charming.\n\nI set my jaw. It clicked in a way the dentist would disapprove of. \u201cTake your snack and run,\u201d I said to Dan. \u201cRun in exactly the direction you most want to go. Then turn left. Then stop.\u201d\n\nHe nodded. He had a face that would be a heart-breaker if he was given the chance to live to heartbreaks. He ran. He ran as if a fox chased him and his feet knew the map and the grass liked him.\n\nElna held up her hand and the river stopped. It tried, at least, to climb her wrist. Her thumb and forefinger pressed as if on invisible skin. She isn\u2019t stronger than he is; none of us are, I suspect. She is clever in the moment moments arrive. She uses the seconds like knives.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d she said, and the reeds obliged her by stiffening like offended men. We walked back along the path very fast and in no way like running, because we would not give the river the show. Behind us, the wet stepped forward and then back and then forward again. Aurelian Crowl laughed the way people laugh when you have, briefly, been amusing. He had found us and he let us go, because power arranges the luxury of savoring.\n\n\u201cHe saw you,\u201d Elna said, once the car park was in sight and the bins were sitting with their lids up like yawns. \u201cHe will not forget the way your voice sounds.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do not like being hunted,\u201d I said, because understatement is English and I can\u2019t be bothered to be anything else.\n\n\u201cWe hunt,\u201d she said, reminding me, gently. \u201cIt\u2019s what we are.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe hunt our own,\u201d I said. \u201cNo. We hunt what our own hunts.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can argue doctrine another day,\u201d Elna said, with the air of someone who will tell me everything and nothing and can be won with a single right sentence. \u201cI am going to sleep now, if he lets me.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou think he will,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s busy,\u201d she said, and tilted her head to the sky where a low, thick cloud had the shape of a dome, of a ceiling, of a hand. \u201cHe\u2019s building something. He thinks he\u2019s the only one who knows he\u2019s building it, but at least three women in town have felt it in their old hips and three men have written it on the back of their betting slips and thrown them away. He is gathering his green.\u201d\n\nI thought of Kara and her envelope and the ticket with my little lines on it and the baby man who had already wanted to be older and faster and gone. I thought of Aunt Bet\u2019s pin in the thistles jar. I thought of a castle that is not on any map, whose walls are fed by what it takes. In my little flat the onion skins would be restless. I would not sleep, but men like me lie in their beds and practice considering the shape of sleep until it deigns to come by and be seen at the door.\n\n\u201cElna,\u201d I said, and she paused. \u201cThank you.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll have to pay me,\u201d she said. \u201cWith something you don\u2019t mind missing.\u201d\n\nI nodded, because I have something, everyone does, and because I have not yet decided what it is.\n\nAs I climbed my stairs, my phone hummed again. The screen lit not with words but with a little window on a world that had the feel of elsewhere. There were curtains in the frame, heavy and green, and the floor beyond them was layered in rugs, and the air had the stillness of places where men are served. A man passed in front of the lens\u2014no, not a man, something shaped like one, wearing a robe that thought highly of itself. He paused and turned, just enough that I saw the line of his jaw and the pale of his eye. He lifted a hand and some invisible servant brought him a glass. He toasted me, this was for me, he toasted me from the place where he lives and we do not.\n\ni will send for you, wrote Aurelian Crowl, across the picture, as if it were a shag carpet he could write in with his finger. not today. you were brave today. i would like that not to go to waste.\n\nHe let me watch him drink. He let me see him set the glass down on a table that had once been a tree that had once been a forest. Behind him, the window was not a window at all but a wall of leaves, lit softly from within, as if every leaf were a pocket holding a living light and he was stealing it, gently and forever. The rain had stopped. Down on the ring road the cars hissed with old water. I locked my door and leaned my head back against it like a man listening for the sea.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nowhere to ferry,\u201d I said to the empty room. \u201cNot really.\u201d\n\nThe window on the phone went black. My reflection blinked back at me, a little wavery, like I was a man seen through water. I went to the kettle and boiled it, and when the steam rose, I stepped aside. I didn\u2019t let it touch my face. I am not reckless. Not exactly. Not yet. I have boots. I have jars. I have a woman who will hand me peanuts and tell me the right lies. I have a boy who might be sleeping now with his shoes by the door.\n\nAbove the kettle an onion skin trembled. There are omens everywhere, if you like to be toyed with by your own eyes. I made the kind of tea that cannot hurt you and I drank it and it hurt, which is not the tea\u2019s fault. Downstairs, the shop\u2019s door bell chimed for no one. The salt I had spilled in my pocket left a pale, sea-crusted crescent on the wood desk by the window. I decided to leave it there. In the morning I would pretend to be a man with no yearning, who wanted only what was near. In the night, in Basingstoke, the wet didn\u2019t sleep.\n\nIn the night, Aurelian Crowl lay on a bed so soft I could feel it in my spine through the glass of the phone I had turned face down under a book. There was a wind where he was because there is always a wind where things grow. It carried someone\u2019s laughter. He smiled with half his mouth, like a man with a knife in it. He said, because he could, \u201cSoon,\u201d and somewhere, not far enough, three taps like a spoon on a saucer echoed from inside the pipes. I curled on my side and pulled the duvet up like a barricade and swallowed hard and thought of chalk. In my dream I walked on dry land. It mocked me. It moved. I ran. I ran and did not sink, not yet, and behind me a castle whose walls were leaves rose and rose and rose.",

                              "content": "Morning made a brittle sound in the pipes as if the building had been drinking in its sleep and now regretted it, and for a heartbeat I thought it was him, helloing through the copper. It wasn\u2019t; it was the ordinary misery of an old flat that asks to be forgiven each time you ask it for hot water. I boiled the kettle anyway and watched the steam rope itself toward the ceiling where the onion skins trembled like a line of saints too thin to keep their haloes. Aunt Bet knocked with her knuckles in a rhythm that said I am trying not to worry; I let her in, and she took in the cup, the salt crescent on the desk, the phone facedown on a book about fungi I had meant to give back to the library a month ago, and she said, \u201cDo you want toast?\u201d which in our language meant, Tell me if the green got into your lungs, tell me if your hands are steady, tell me if you think you\u2019re clever or lucky or already dead. I said, \u201cYes,\u201d because we do not make speeches to the person who will give you bread and stand between you and a gust.\n\nKara texted me two words at almost the same time as Bet buttered, The first: here. The second: breathing. She did not add exclamation marks; she was a woman who kept punctuation for bills and notices. I didn\u2019t breathe until the picture came through, a crooked image of a boy under a blanket on a couch I did not know, face turned toward a television that showed a cartoon fox caught in a perpetual stew of cats\u2019 eyes and a saucepan. His feet were dirty in the way that says I have touched the real outside world and come back regardless. His wrist was bare; the plaited thread had come off in my pocket the night before and now sat on my desk like a small caught snake that had decided to be a bracelet. I sent a dot in reply because I do not say congratulations to a mother whose boy has come home wet and sharp with fear; I say, I have more work and it is already under the doors.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll take her money,\u201d Bet said, mouth full, which means she was on my side and against me in the way only family can be. \u201cBut we will not spend it. We will put it in the jar labeled A RAIN FOR ANOTHER DAY and we will wait to know what it was for.\u201d She spread marmalade like a glossy deceit and then stopped, looking at my face, entirely unmagical, entirely aunt. \u201cHe looked you through a window?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe toasted me,\u201d I said, and made a sound like I was laughing because otherwise I might have spat. \u201cWith something pressed from a fruit he coerces. He wrote on the picture as if it were carpet. He told me I was brave.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh dear,\u201d she said, quietly. \u201cHe would enjoy you. He would enjoy you the way a person enjoys a complicated board game on a Sunday, when there is nowhere else to be.\u201d She reached out and pinched my sleeve and I didn\u2019t flinch the way I sometimes do because I knew the pinching wasn\u2019t a spell, it was an old habit from when I was fourteen and slipping like a cup from hands. \u201cYou don\u2019t go alone to things which echo,\u201d she added, as if she were telling me not to forget a scarf.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d I lied, and immediately hated the taste of it. \u201cElna will go in front. She likes the part of the dance where the floor is already moving. She told me he\u2019s building. The old women feel it in their hips, the men on losing streaks write it on slips of paper and throw it away for the pigeons to read.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will feel it when the jars won\u2019t seal,\u201d Bet said, eyes going to the shelf where THISTLES sat between COCKLE and SEAM. \u201cWe will know it when somebody we didn\u2019t invite begins to hum in the refrigerator and the milk sours in hours. The last time I felt a big build I was in bed with your Uncle Dol, and the spring bed sang the middle part of a hymn for three nights. I thought it was romance. It was just a mill being raised without permission two towns over. We went and leaned pepper at it until it went quiet.\u201d\n\nI asked her to hand me the bracelet and the envelope Kara had pushed over the counter, and we settled the question of money the way you settle a cat, by making a place that looked like it wanted it and then not moving when it tried to leave. I wrote a receipt that said, For returning a boy to a mother, paid in fears. I have a file of such things, little lies with my signature that might be needed when my own fears grow teeth and come looking for transactions to nibble. At the bottom of the page I wrote a second line in a language that tastes like old coins and cloves, Elna\u2019s payment clamoring behind my ears like a kettle: Orrin Pell owes. Owing is a string; sometimes it keeps you on the bank.\n\nKara insisted on me coming to hers to return the bracelet, which was not necessary, and completely necessary, and I went because it meant I would see whether the green had put its thumb on their taps. It was a terrace on the north side, a warren of halls that smelled of bleach and biscuits, a hallway where three coats hung like two living people and a coat shaped like the ghost of a larger you. Dan opened the door to me before Kara could, which is usually wrong, and he stood very straight because he saw me as a person who had returned him to himself and a person to be measured. \u201cYou came,\u201d he said, and in that voice was a thing I recognized and wish I didn\u2019t: a boy who has touched a wolf and now walks carefully around all dogs.\n\n\u201cI come when I can be useful,\u201d I said, and he looked at me sideways, amused as only nine can be. The couch had been conquered by his blanket and the television\u2019s fox had fled, a weatherman now describing rain as if it were an inheritance you didn\u2019t know you had. I saw, in the corner by the skirting board, a words-worth of water gathering itself where the plaster had flaked, not quite a leak, more a suggestion. Crowl has a way of pointing at a corner of your life and saying, There, that texture, let us encourage it.\n\nKara made tea she did not drink. She put a bowl of cereal in front of Dan and he ignored it in favor of a packet of crisps and I did not tell her to say anything; when a body comes back from the water you give it salt like a map and sugar like forgiveness. \u201cHe says a man sang him to the river,\u201d she said, matter-of-factly, because she had slept and crying had rearranged her into a person who could speak and listen simultaneously. \u201cNot a song that rhymes. The kind of song that is a counting that never ends. He says it tasted like mint on the first bit and then like old pennies on the second and then like nothing at all. He says\u2014\u201d and here she faltered and put her palm flat on the counter like she was checking if it still existed, \u201che says when he closed his eyes he saw a room full of leaves and a man who was not in the room but everywhere else in the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cI saw the room,\u201d I said. I pushed the bracelet across the table. It had dried and taken on a brown-green. \u201cHe writes in leaves the way you and I write in ink. He builds his words like hedges in winter. Did Dan hear the name for him in the counting?\u201d\n\nKara and Dan both shook their heads, the sort of choreography that happens when you live in the same house long enough to share a set of muscles. \u201cHe didn\u2019t use his name,\u201d Dan said around crisp, crumbs sticking to the corner of his mouth like confetti from a party he did not attend. \u201cHe called me little boatman and little mackerel and once he called me little frog and then he laughed about it.\u201d He frowned at the bracelet and was very brave. \u201cHe said if I knew how much of me was water I wouldn\u2019t pretend to be dry. He said everything gets thirsty in the end. He said\u2014\u201d Here his throat did a reluctant bounce, the sort boys don\u2019t let you see, \u201che said I could go to the green and never be told to brush my teeth again.\u201d\n\n\u201cBrushing your teeth is one of the few magics we allow to be boring,\u201d I said, because there are times you say the least useful, truest thing and watch the body in front of you seize it like a branch. I did not say, We will teach you how to stand where the wet speaks without listening, because he was nine and his mother had a line through her chest, invisible and heavy. I asked to use the bathroom and Kara nodded like she was handing me a shovel for a grave; in houses like this the pipes are the spine and if you touch them wrong your hands come back with someone else\u2019s fingerprints on them.\n\nI tied the bracelet to the tap, thoughtfully, a joke the pipe did not appreciate. I spoke to the drains not as if they were persons but as if they were old horses in winter, and I poured a smear from my second jar, thinner than last night\u2019s, along the inside lip of the sink where the wet licks. The smell rose up like a modest ghost and rested its hand on my shoulder like a relative. The mirror watched me do something I should not be able to do in property that has a mortgage and water rates. In the corner of the mirror my face was a man who would throw himself in front of a tap if it started coughing a name. I cut a hair-thin thread of green from the space just above the plughole, where it was clinging like a cobweb in a house that doesn\u2019t admit to spiders. It came away slow and sly and stuck to the bone of my thumb like it had opinions; I burned it on the hot part of the kettle and it made a noise like air being slapped. The kettle did not know what it had done, which is true of many kettles and men faced with use.\n\nI went back into the kitchen and told Dan to let me see his wrists. He held them out obediently, and because he is what he is and we are what we are, there was a rime of not-water on his left wrist, invisible if you didn\u2019t pay for certain spectacles with a year of your luck. I blew on it and it ran away in the shape of a small, offended fish. \u201cHe left you a gate,\u201d I said to the boy while Kara looked in alarm at nothing at all that she could see. \u201cHe will not be allowed to use it. I have put a stopper in the pipe. It won\u2019t come out unless you pull on it from both sides. Don\u2019t pull on it. If something in the house speaks and you think it is him, make an ugly face with your mouth and stick your tongue out and say, \u2018My name is my mother\u2019s name cut in half and stuck back together by a schoolboy with glue.\u2019 Don\u2019t worry if the grammar is wrong. The wet doesn\u2019t mark papers.\u201d\n\nDan practiced the face, which was miraculous in its unintended rudeness, and then practiced a second time, more miraculous. Kara put her hand to her mouth again and looked simultaneously appalled and very briefly saved; in some houses the first ugly face a child is taught is entirely practical. I left them with a packet of salt and a bad drawing of a window that isn\u2019t a window, taped on the inside of their kitchen door. On the way out I touched the shoes on the mat and said, Thank you for bringing him home, and I felt old for the first time that day, old in the way of someone who has to tell doors to behave.\n\nOn the pavement the rain had dressed down to a sulk and the ring road down the hill made a noise like a man mumbling to himself with a sandwich in his mouth. I took a route that avoided seeing the lake and failed without meaning to; the town\u2019s layout does that to you. Eastrop Park sits like a coin in a palm, the paths lifting toward it without asking anyone\u2019s opinion. The lake has drawn its share of grief and geese, and in summer the family boats go out like little teeth. Today the boats were empty and moored, each hull collecting a thin layer of green. Somebody had given the swans bread shaped like hope and the swans were doing their outrageous best to be cruel about it. I stopped because the fountain in the middle, a sham pillar that coughs water out of its fake mouth, made a new sound. Before, it had only ever been a throat. Now it was practicing vowels.\n\nA small boy with a red coat and a father in a bright jacket were making a ritual of chucking crusts and not looking at one another. The water around the fountain had an oil-slick sheen the color of expensive tea, and every now and then it flashed a sort of velvet at me, which I am fool enough to recognize. I leaned on the rail, ostensibly to look like a man who cannot resist damp masonry, and hummed under my breath an old pub song my grandmother used to hum when she poured vinegar on a burn, an ugly song about a girl who fell in love with a horse and lost a shoe, that to this day I cannot sing around decent people. The fountain faltered in its vowels and went back to coughing like before, as if embarrassed to have been heard, and a pigeon on the rail next to me laughed in the rusty way pigeons do when they approve of magic done by someone else.\n\nThe father glanced over his shoulder and said, \u201cThey\u2019ll bite,\u201d and I said, \u201cThey don\u2019t have teeth,\u201d and he said, \u201cYou haven\u2019t met our one; he\u2019s got a set he borrowed from a dentist.\u201d We smiled at each other in the way two men who are responsible for very different things will smile at a common public space, and I moved on because I do not take boys in red coats from their fathers unless the river is already calling them by pet names.\n\nUnder the underpass the town keeps its second weather. It smells like coins and ghosts in trainers, and the walls bloom in winter with paint that says FURY and LUKE and sometimes a phone number for a woman named D who will change your life for twenty and a walk. It is beautiful in its cruelty, and it is the sort of place that makes men like Crowl lick a finger and hold it up and say, Here. Elna\u2019s borrowed villa had the sort of name that a softened real estate agent would give: The Oaks, The Cedars, a hedge where all the trees have already gone to cupboards. It sat behind a grille like teeth, and the windows blinked in a tired way in the thin afternoon, and when I put my hand on the door it knew me as Not Him and opened with the slow humiliation of a lock that would much rather be paying attention to someone important.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re late to my fear,\u201d Elna called from the kitchen, and when I stepped into the narrow corridor I saw the walls were sweating. Not in a human way; in that way an atmosphere can decide it is bigger than a room. She stood at the sink with the cupboard doors open beneath it and the trap exposed and the pipes making a sound that you should only ever hear in a throat when it is making a plea. She had a loop of copper wire between her teeth. \u201cIf you\u2019ve brought anything that pretends to be dry,\u201d she added conversationally, \u201cnow would be a good time to give me it and go into the garden and look at somebody\u2019s miraculous astroturf for five minutes.\u201d\n\nI went to the sink because there is a part of me that has been engineered to disobey instructions that are meant to save me, and I put my jar next to the soap. \u201cHe thinks this house is his mouth,\u201d I said, which was accurate and not useful, and she hissed around the wire and spat it out into her hand like a coin. \u201cNo, he thinks my sleep is his mouth,\u201d she said, and punched the wire through itself with her thumb as if making a tiny crown. \u201cHe dreamed me last night using the boiler as his ear because he doesn\u2019t understand that a woman can sleep without offering him a story.\u201d\n\nThere are women who I would not touch in the middle of a working, not with a hand, not with a thought. I touched Elna and the room steadied, not because my touch is worth more than hers but because sometimes a body next to your body returns you to what bodies can do. She was cold along the wrist; she did not notice I was holding her until a noise deep in the pipe dropped two octaves and tried to imitate a voice. Crowl has a voice you would laugh at over drinks at a wedding because it is a clich\u00e9 of power, and I am frightened of it and will call it names anyway. He spoke a syllable like a ring dropped in water, and then he told Elna to hiss. She did not. She exhaled in a way I recognized, the exhale that says, I have waited tables and told men to look with their eyes and not their fingers, and nothing in me is going to squeeze for you.\n\n\u201cThis will pinch,\u201d she warned, and slid the copper crown around the pipe\u2019s throat. When it pinched, the house shook, and if you have not been in a place that has shaken with a name rather than a motion, you have not been inside a body when it chooses not to die. She leaned her forehead against the cupboard door like a penitent for two breaths and then straightened. \u201cI will have a cup of something heavy, please,\u201d she said, \u201cheavy with the smell of forever,\u201d and I made tea the way I do when I know exactly how a person takes it and can pretend I do not care if I am wrong. We stood in the kitchen with the pipes and the cheap cupboards and the laminate pretending to be wood. The shape of the room altered. It became hospitable again by degrees, the way a dog will come and put its chin on your knee after it has made you believe it could bite your throat.\n\n\u201cI owe you,\u201d I said, handing her the mug, and the debt sat in my red mouth and looked attractive. \u201cYou asked me for something I didn\u2019t mind missing. I have something. Two somethings, if you will take the first and leave the second for when I have made you a meal that breaks your back with comfort.\u201d\n\nShe took the tea and didn\u2019t drink, just held it between her palms in that way of hers which says I am the sort of person who believes in reheating. \u201cSay them both,\u201d she said, and she was tired and the tired was the sort of tired I respect: not self-pity, but the sort that knows exactly where your body ends and is bored of being forced to go on anyway.\n\n\u201cThe first is a rhyme for stepping over little waters,\u201d I said. \u201cIt is not a powerful rhyme. It is not ancient. I made it when I was twelve and a teacher told me off for being late and I wanted to walk over the gutter that had been a river to me for stiff ten minutes. I say it in my head and my feet do not feel the pull. It goes like a counting trick and it ends on a word that is the name of a sandwich. If I give it to you, it will become yours. My mouth will not know the path of it anymore. My feet will have to find a new way or wait.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will take that,\u201d she said, and did not pretend not to be thrilled. \u201cI will take it because it will help me cross the small. I am arrogant about the big things and they do not always punish me. The small ones hate my arrogance. Possibly because they are small.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe second is\u2014\u201d and here I looked at the ceiling because the words were not smooth, they were bricked, \u201ca thing I say between the numbers, the bit of language my grandmother gave me on a bus when she was knitting and the bus went over a bridge she hadn\u2019t prepared for. It binds the numbers together so that they can be eaten by the next number. I have said it since, and it keeps my lungs from inventing alarms. If I gave you that, I would become worse. I would give him a mapping of my breath in the minutes I am crossing a footbridge with teenagers laughing ahead of me and I am trying not to run. So you cannot have that. But I am telling you it exists, so that when I give you the first thing you will know you are not taking the only rope out of my hands.\u201d\n\nShe drank half the cup in one swallow and set it down like an argument concluded. \u201cGive me the sandwich rhyme,\u201d she said, and I did, speaking it in my mouth like I was tasting a dumb sweet from a tuck shop the school never should have allowed to open. The words left me with that exact cheap sugar ache. My feet felt immediate, bare and ambitious, and I was mildly delighted to be annoyed by them. \u201cOh, that is ugly,\u201d Elna said, pleased. \u201cThat is exactly ugly enough to be useful. It goes nowhere and takes you with. Thank you.\u201d She picked up her mug again and did a little dance you would not have noticed if you weren\u2019t watching the way I was; it was the dance of a person crossing the smallest stream and refusing to be seen doing it.\n\nThe dog came later, after she'd slept under the crown and woken with her hair in new arguments. I had gone outside to look at the square of grass that belonged to no one and everyone, the patch that the council had once given a name to, a name with Park in it, and then changed its mind. It had a bench that had been dedicated to a man named Ted who liked to sit at 3 p.m. and pretend to be unimpressed by schoolchildren. Under the bench there was a heap of old leaf matter and a mouth that breathed. When I sat down, the mouth shuffled and became a dog, medium in every way except eyes. His ears were not matched, and one of them looked like it had been the subject of a conversation with something that had teeth and too little to say. He considered me with the intensity of a person deciding whether to take a job that would require weekends.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be mine later,\u201d I told him, because Elna has her dreams and I have had my share of mornings that begin with a sentence arriving like a telegram. He put his chin on my boot and exhaled in a way that said, Yes, but you will be mine, which is the correct order of things for dogs and men who know their limits. I scratched the place behind his odd ear and he looked at me like I was a poor student learning a trick slowly and he would be paid regardless. \u201cYou have a name you won\u2019t tell me,\u201d I said, and he blinked, which means, yes, I have a name, but it is not the one the woman shouted from the back step. \u201cYou can tell me later,\u201d I said. \u201cYou can tell me when the rain is behaving and the pipes are not full of men.\u201d\n\nAt the end of the afternoon the town put on its orange coat and the ring road again became a belt being tightened; people wanted their dinners, they wanted their screens, they wanted to lie down without thinking of rivers. I went back to the shop to give Aunt Bet the receipt and to sit in the corner under the shelf that holds the old jam jars we don\u2019t put anything in because they remember. She was making a list on a brown paper bag because she had given all the good paper to children who come in and ask for two pages because they are making a zine and what is a zine and will you be in it if we make you a character. \u201cPure caraway, another spool of black the weight of an apple, that man from the Fair Mile wants a bark as sour as his face, he can have hawthorn if he promises to keep his lungs in,\u201d she muttered, and when she looked up her eyes did the old cloudy slide toward my collarbone. \u201cHe is busy,\u201d she said unnecessarily, and I nodded and told her that the fountain had been making a mouth on top of a mouth and that I had insulted it in time.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll need to put something in the park,\u201d she said, and she was already opening a drawer that has no label because it refuses them. \u201cSomething glass they will think is about art. Something that makes the water feel as if it\u2019s already fulfilled. A promise it can sleep beside and forget to keep. I have a bottle that my grandmother saved a lightning in and never let out.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou told me that bottle broke when you were fourteen and dared it into the garden,\u201d I said, because part of my job is to remind her when she is asking the dead to do living work.\n\nShe sniffed. \u201cI said \u2018a bottle,\u2019 not that bottle,\u201d she said, which is the sort of lie old women tell because they know better ways of telling the truth are bad for business. \u201cGo to the train bridge,\u201d she added, as if the thought had lain down flat and been stepped on by another thought and so become practical. \u201cThe boy told his mother about a gnome who walks the lines, and the gnome does, some nights, but tonight I think the gnome will have a friend. You will go and stand under the bridge with a pocket of salt and the name of the gnome in your mouth, and you will ask him if he has been offered a job in a place where the pay is green.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know the gnome\u2019s name,\u201d I said, and she smiled like a knife. \u201cYou do,\u201d she said. \u201cWe all do. We call him by his job. Try that and see who looks down.\u201d\n\nThe Fairfields bridge has a hum that isn\u2019t just trains. All bridges do, but this one remembers being built by men who sang without wanting to sing, and their songs got in the concrete. The underside smells like cigarettes and once, before it was painted over, somebody had drawn a woman with a swan\u2019s neck and a man\u2019s teeth and written under it in marker, MY EX. When I stepped into the space the evening poured itself down my back; it was cold and it had that clean edge it gets in November when the leaves are indecisive and the hedges are honest. I put my hand on the central pillar because there are times when you touch the big thing that holds things up and wait for it to touch you back.\n\n\u201cLinesman,\u201d I said, and my voice sounded like a threat and a plea and a tired joke, all correctly, because I am all three. \u201cTrack-walker. Checker. Man with a lamp. Man with a bag. Long-legged person of the half-warm night. Come and speak to a worse light.\u201d\n\nHe was there before the last word had left my lips, because it isn\u2019t that hard to fetch a man whose name is an occupation and whose occupation is to never be late. He looked like every storybook drawing of a gnome the town had ever produced, which is to say nothing at all like a gnome and exactly like an old man with a back that had been promised an apology and never collected it. He wore hi-vis and a cap that had once been a better cap and boots that were his children and his enemies. His hands remembered a spanner when they were empty. He did not glow until he needed to. He looked down because that is what men like him do. \u201cIf you\u2019re after the boy,\u201d he said without preface, \u201che is home eating crisps and annoying a cartoon.\n\n\u201cI had the honor,\u201d I said, trying not to be polite to a creature that likes to be asked to help and dislikes being told it has already done so. \u201cIf you\u2019ve come to warn me off, you should know I\u2019m not paid by wage.\u201d\n\nHe leaned his hip against a bit of bridge that had been smoothed by a thousand legs in a thousand afternoons. \u201cHe offered me a different lamp,\u201d the linesman said. \u201cHe sent a draft to lie along the tracks and it smelled like apples that have never had a bruise. He sent a woman\u2019s voice to say the kind of thing that makes men think they\u2019re not stupid at all. He offered me a bed against a wall that is all leaves, where no woman would ever turn her back and pretend to sleep because she is not ready to forgive. He told me I would not have to walk alone, because the gnomes would keep time together.\u201d He used the old word himself, with fond insult, because that is how we survive names meant to make us smaller. He pulled a can from his pocket, opened it without asking if I wanted one, and drank. \u201cI told him I cannot walk on a floor that is a lie. He told me he had a real floor, a floor made of forest. I told him, You\u2019ve never fallen on one the way I have if you think that\u2019s soft.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe will ask again,\u201d I said, thinking of green velvet and cups lifted toward my mouth. \u201cHe\u2019ll ask you for a small thing you can afford to give, and you will give it because he will make it look decent to give it. The second time he will ask for something you cannot afford. You will be too polite to point out the change in price.\u201d\n\nThe linesman nodded as if I had quoted a training manual he had written. \u201cHe already asked for my whistle,\u201d he said. \u201cHe said I would not need it where we were going, because we would not use such ugly warnings, because nothing about the moving parts would be surprised.\u201d He took his whistle from his pocket and put it in my hand. It was dented and a bit resentful. \u201cKeep that for me tonight,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you hear a train when the time is wrong, blow it, and I will turn around and come back for whoever\u2019s got their foot stuck in a thought.\u201d He looked me up and down with that cataloging glance old men reserve for young men they do not quite approve of but love anyway. \u201cHe will try you next,\u201d he said simply. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a head that wants to go under an idea and the legs to carry you up to it. Don\u2019t let him tell you you\u2019re joining a union when really he wants the badge on your coat.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am already in a union,\u201d I said, feeling the whistle against my palm like a keystone. \u201cWe are the small union that meets under beds and in back rooms and in the heart of people who haven\u2019t been paid for three months and can still afford to share a sandwich. It is the union of poor planning and good luck. We bring thermoses. We clap when a person is brave even if they are stupid.\u201d\n\nA train went over then, all metal and scream, and we looked at our feet like men look at their own foolishness when it is very loud. When it had gone, the linesman struck a match for no reason and then shook it out. \u201cThere is a culvert at Black Dam,\u201d he said, without prelude. \u201cThere is a mouth in it. He is going to open that mouth. Not all the way. He is not that greedy in public. Just enough to let a boy as high as my spanner walk into it without bending. He will open it at eleven because he respects the clock on the wall, even if he spares none of us elsewise. Put your jar there. Put your salt there. Put your body there if you have to. Make the mouth forget it is a mouth.\u201d He tapped his cap brim in the sort of courtesy that survived three wars and three more endings, and then he was gone because someone up the line had sent him a word, and that word had the shape of a front door.\n\nI took myself to Black Dam after dark with a dog who had decided he loved me enough to supervise but not enough to be seen sitting when I said sit. He trotted ahead of me like a man with a full bladder. The water there is tamed in the way municipal water is tamed, which is to say given clothes and expected to eat with a fork and knife. It lies flat so people can reflect themselves and feel wise. The culvert lives at the edge like the part of the tablecloth you use to wipe a stain pretending nobody will notice. It has a metal grille that has saved more lives than there are names to write down in registers, and it has graffiti that says JAMIE LOVES JAMIE and then a date. The wind off it was wrong; it had that smell of pears in winter, the smell nobody likes because it is too much like a promise.\n\nElna met me there with a coil of red cord in her pocket and her hair tucked up under a hat that had once been a laugh and was now dignity. \u201cHe will pretend to be the other side of polite tonight,\u201d she said, making marks in the air with her hands as if she were knitting with the dark. \u201cHe will say we have mistaken him for a villain. He will say he saves. He will say he offers continuity. He will say he treats hunger like a sin, not a condition. We will not believe him because we have had to be hungry in ways he cannot smell.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo we have time to be clever?\u201d I asked, and she looked at my jar and then at the grille and then at the dog, who was sniffing the bollard as if it were in love with him. \u201cWe have time to be ugly,\u201d she said. \u201cClever takes patience; ugly takes force. Put your line down. Make a scab.\u201d\n\nWe made a scab. I poured and the clear lay along the lip of the culvert and the smell made the hairs on my wrist remember thunderstorms and cousins. There was a moment when the mouth forgot how to be a mouth and became, instead, a notion. You can walk past a notion. You can put up a sign that says nothing in this direction and people will have the decency to believe it if they are not ordered to do otherwise by something with a title. The dog leaned into my thigh so hard it would have been an insult if it wasn\u2019t grace. We whispered names of boys into the cold while the jar set, and the wind did that thing wind does when it wants to be an ally and remembers it has never been invited to dinner. At ten-fifty-nine something put its tongue behind the grille and said, ah. We were ready enough.\n\nHe liked to make an entrance even when he had agreed to pretend he wasn\u2019t there. The first hint was the light from the path lamps bowing toward the water the way men bow to other men when money has come up in conversation at a funeral. The second was the sound of Elna\u2019s hat making a decision to stay on her head regardless. The third was the smell, the velvet again, the library where the books are bound in things that used to be alive and the seating is for men with papers. He did not come in person. He brought a corridor. It ran along the culvert and along the air and along the fence and along the line of my jaw. It was as wide as my fear and as thin as the coin you throw in a charity fountain to pretend you are kind. It had wallpaper you can drink, if your mouth is shrewd. He said my name again and made it sound like a pill.\n\n\u201cNot tonight,\u201d I said, because we had done the work and all that mattered was not making it pretty. \u201cNot through there. Not in your green long hall. Not in any hall at all.\u201d\n\nHe was amused, and his amusement pressed into my chest in the place people call the heart because we have not found a better word yet. oh, he said, and the sound of the word made the grill lean forward. you brought glue. how sweet. there are adult ways to negotiate rivers, little man. there are handshakes. you have brought me a paperweight.\n\n\u201cI have brought you a law,\u201d Elna said, and I have never loved a person more than I loved her then because she said it like she was asking a dog to sit and then praising it when it did. \u201cI have brought you a boundary. I have brought you a child back from the shape of your mouth. You may sit and watch if you like. You may take notes. You may be bored. I will not be performing beyond my contract.\u201d\n\nHe made a door in the corridor as if to prove a point to himself. We did not look at it. The dog did, and then he sneezed and put his head under my hand in a way that said, You can be loved even when you are trying to catch a fish. The water pulled, angry and childish. The scab held. A girl with a phone came along with a boy in a jacket and they saw nothing but two adults with a dog looking at a fence, which is one of the oldest and safest English pastimes. We nodded, because you always nod to the people who are doing their best not to fall in love with each other too hard at twenty-two, and when they had gone the wind changed its mind and the corridor thinned.\n\nHe does not like being told no in public. He is not used to being told no in rooms where he has kept everything damp. He went, and the sudden emptiness he left is a thing you cannot put in a sentence without embarrassing yourself. The air was colder in the way cold can be after a fever. The dog licked my hand and caught the taste of the jar and sneezed again and looked at me like he was going to report me to someone for mild cruelty. Elna laid the last of the cord and tied it off in a sailor\u2019s knot that had refused to be named by sailors, and she said, \u201cHe will come to your house now. He will knock on nothing. He will wait until you brush your teeth and tell you that you don\u2019t have to if you don\u2019t want to. He will make being ten feel like it lasted too long, and being thirty like a coat you had to put on to go into the rain. He will flatter you with the thought that you can be powerful and unhurt. He will make you think you made a mistake not going to him when he asked.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t know how many mistakes I\u2019ve made already,\u201d I said, and the dog leaned on me in agreement. \u201cHe thinks he is the first. He thinks he is the only one with a table and a chair. He thinks he eats alone. He thinks the green belongs to him because he can pronounce the word. He thinks he made luck. He thinks\u2014\u201d and here I faltered in the way a throat does when a promise arrives to be signed, \u201c\u2014he thinks he can make me spend a day without counting planks and then call it freedom.\u201d\n\nWe stood until the eleven-fifteen had gone over and the sound had shaken every coin in my pocket into the same corner as if they had been gathered for counting. We stood until the jar had stopped being itself and become a part of the place that could be left, a friendly lie with a skin and a price. We stood because sometimes the only spell is to not go home yet. Only when the dog had yawned and sat down without me having to say anything too humiliating did we move. Elna put her hand on my shoulder and said, \u201cWe are required to eat something greasy and judgmental now,\u201d and we went and found chips that had been waiting for a night exactly like this.\n\nAt my flat the door had been polite. The onion skins did not rattle and the kettle did not aspire. The phone slept under the book like a small beast in a winter den. When I lifted the book the screen did not go green. It stayed black and showed me a narrow, honest version of my face. I got as far as brushing my teeth and the dog lay in the doorway on the exact line where I trip on days I am too full of myself. He watched me with that old soul expression dogs pick up in houses where men have thought too hard and too wrong for too long. \u201cI won\u2019t go,\u201d I told him, because sometimes you tell a creature with no stake in your nobility the part you can\u2019t tell your own aunt, and he stretched and put his paw over his nose and huffed once as if to say, You\u2019re a slow learner and I like that in men.\n\nThe pipes did their old, tired morning sound at midnight because houses do not respect musicals, and then the room changed pressure. It was subtle, the way the air changes when a person important to you has entered a bar and you cannot see them yet. I felt him, which is not an admission, it is a measurement. He did not speak. He is not a fool. He changed the temperature of the water in the cistern by three degrees and waited for me to go to the toilet so that my body would learn to find him pleasant in a place where it does not generally find anything. I held it like a saint and counted, and the dog snored like an honest man. I did not say the secret between the numbers because I had it and I was saving it. I said the sandwich rhyme and it did nothing because I was not crossing anything, and I grinned for the first time since the bridge because if I do not consider him funny for trying, then the part of me that still imagines a castle and a bed will win. Somewhere else in the building somebody showered, and their water hit their skin, and if he was going to seduce anyone that night it would be them, not me. If I am to be hunted\u2014and dear, I am\u2014I would like to pick the field.\n\nBefore I lay down I wrote a list because lists make the part of me that could otherwise drown look up and swallow. It said: find a better jar. Remember that gifs of cats are not a magic; do not expect them to be. Get the linesman\u2019s whistle back to him before he invents a second and hates the sound of it. Tell Kara to put a bowl of water on the front step with a spoon beside it and a note that says Not for you. Ask Aunt Bet about the bottle that isn\u2019t the bottle. Ask Elna if she has ever seen a man\u2019s shadow leave him and walk into a different room. Buy dog biscuits and pretend you always had them in the house. Practice not touching the water when you want to. Practice touching the dry.\n\nWhen I slept, I slept like a person with a dog within arm\u2019s reach and a whistle near my head and a man in green telling me I would enjoy myself more if I gave him my mouth for a bit. I dreamed a pond with a bottom like a thumb. I dreamed a house made of leaves where every leaf held a little light the size of a coin and he had arranged them by denomination. I dreamed Aunt Bet sitting on the till with a pin in her mouth and saying, \u201cMen like him forget about lint,\u201d and laughing until the whole shop shook and the jars chimed like a morgue for bees. I dreamed Elna in a dress that was paper and scissors both and a boy named Dan running along a platform not because he was leaving but because the trains looked like they might appreciate the respect of somebody trying to be faster than them. In every dream I had my boots, and in one of them, finally, I took them off and my feet did not feel like betrayal. It didn\u2019t last, but the body remembers these things. It will be useful, even if only for seven minutes, which is a lifetime if what you are currently doing is not drowning.",
