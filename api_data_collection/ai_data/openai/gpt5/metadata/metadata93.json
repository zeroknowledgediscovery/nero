     "novel_text": "The first story about the giant wasn\u2019t told in newspapers but in a drizzle of whispers in line at the food trucks, under porch lights, on the bleachers at the ballfields in Railroad Square, where the grown-ups pretend not to stare at the sky when it goes slate-blue. A child on a tricycle said she heard steps that made the pavement hiccup. A teenager working the kettle-corn stand swore he saw a woman taller than streetlamps but thinner than a storm, cross the lot without moving her knees. A valet outside the refurbed synagogue told his cousin\u2019s roommate that he felt a breath, just one enormous breath, over his shoulder as he counted tips.\n\nOn the night Maybelle Jarvis disappeared, no one heard any scream. There were just the fair noises\u2014laughter spread thin, a band failing a cover of a song that should never be covered, someone shouting bingo though it wasn\u2019t that kind of night. There was a pause in the long chain of neon letters that spelled out FRESH LEMONADE, and then a little more pause, and two boys arguing about the rules of tag took half a step backward and bumped into no one. Maybelle\u2019s father tipped his paper cup to finish the ice, frowned at the bitterness, looked down and saw her shoe. It was unscuffed, two Velcro straps, the glitter already flaking off like fish scales. And there were the photographs later, but the photographs came after the whispering had built a mouth of its own.\n\nThe photographs were of lips. Not eyes or faces or the way hair falls when you\u2019re not knowing it\u2019s being watched. The lips, only the lips, pursed or parted, some blown up until they became their own landscapes. They were found in a neat fan near the back of the library. The library stayed open late on fair nights because of air conditioning and safety, and because the woman at the reference desk believed in books like you believe in lint you can never quite get off your jacket. The photographs were smudged in the corners as if someone had moved them with hands too large to do delicate work.\n\nPeople in Tallahassee talk small-town, long-road, quick to think they know the whole of anything. Within two days the giant had a name. They called her Abigail.\n\nShe was jealous, the whispers went. That\u2019s why she squished the little ones. Jealous of what, exactly, no one agreed on. Some said of innocence, some said of attention, some said of the shrinking of the country into screens small enough to tuck into a palm. Jealousy was the one word everyone could hold.\n\nOn Sundays, Zante preached about envy without naming it. She wore her collar, thin like a ribbon you could cut with your teeth, and stood in the clear-hewn light of the high windows. She was not tall, but there was something in her posture that made people sit straighter. She had the look of somebody who remembers what the backs of stations smell like. In the whispers she had two titles, one of them true, the other more of a shadow that stuck and would not let go: vicar and DCI. She\u2019d been the latter across an ocean, once. The collar had come after the badge, and Tallhassee\u2014she pronounced it correctly most days\u2014embraced her as something rare, a woman who could officiate a wedding and diagram a crime scene and bring casseroles in foil pans that never found their way back.\n\nOn the Sunday after the fair, she climbed the three wooden steps to the pulpit and paused, as if listening to the building breathe.\n\n\u201cCoveting,\u201d she said. \u201cWe like to save that word for lists. We like to keep it in stone. Thou shalt not. But the hollows in us have better handwriting than stone.\u201d\n\nAbigail sat in the front pew, a smile tucked into her cheek like a coin you don\u2019t want to spend. She had a wide forehead that would gleam when she laughed, and she laughed often, and her hands were always moving. She ran a studio in a small brick unit just off Gaines Street. She photographed mouths precisely because everyone else wanted eyes. She called it honest work, close work. She kept the old cameras on shelves and in glass cases; the digital ones sat in a drawer that stuck. Her prints hung on the walls in the church hall, lips painted, lips chapped, lips child-soft, lips grandmother wise. People said the photographs made them uneasy. People also bought them, because that\u2019s what unease will do when it meets a credit card and a blank spot on a wall.\n\nSome parishioners shifted when Zante leaned into the sermon. She spoke about a neighbor in London who had painted his fence a color that could only be called radioactive apricot. \u201cAnd I loved my faded fence until I saw his,\u201d she said. \u201cI confess I wanted his fence to peel.\u201d She wore her hair pulled back, no stray piece allowed, the soft drawl she\u2019d learned in Tallahassee braided with a sharper music from other rains. \u201cJealousy,\u201d she said, \u201cis the crowded feeling. The feeling that says there\u2019s not enough room left for your soul. We do not become bigger by stepping on someone else\u2019s breath, but oh, how we try.\u201d\n\nAbigail\u2019s smile thinned on the word breath. It was subtle, a little thing, and then it was gone.\n\nAfter the service, the hall turned to coffee and polite noise. Children darted between folding chairs; two slid on their socks along the varnished strip of floor that wasn\u2019t as sticky as the rest. Abigail stood by the window and watched the kids, watched their mouths, watched the words begin and slip and break. She tilted her head. She said to no one in particular: \u201cWe promise with our mouths first. We make vows before we learn to write.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re sermonizing now,\u201d Zante said, warm behind her. She brushed a crumb off the dark sleeve of Abigail\u2019s dress. Abigail tipped her chin, a little defensively.\n\n\u201cYou were good,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe too good. They\u2019re going to want you to save them from a fable.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to want me to visit a fairground,\u201d Zante replied. \u201cAnd I will.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou? Or the other you?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe both me,\u201d Zante said, and smiled. She meant the collar and the old badge, the title everyone loved to whisper. DCI. It had followed her like a stray cat across customs, through a courthouse, into a church.\n\nBy afternoon, the fair was mostly gone, the temporary lights snapped down and trucked away, the asphalt unrolled again into its usual blank. A few chalk drawings persisted\u2014crooked houses with windows square as teeth. Zante walked the path between the palms, wearing ordinary shoes, the hem of her skirt catching on the weeds that poke where the maintenance budget lets them. Sergeant Boone trailed a few paces behind, big-shouldered, unsure where to put his hands when he was with a woman who wouldn\u2019t take his hat and wouldn\u2019t fit into his ideas of categories.\n\n\u201cAppreciate you coming,\u201d he said for the fourth time, and the fourth time Zante nodded. He\u2019d been the one to call her, late, his voice thick with heat and something he wouldn\u2019t name.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not technically my parishioner,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd you\u2019re not technically my officer.\u201d She crouched near a puddle, peered at the ripples the wind made. \u201cBut technically is thin ice. We stand on thicker things.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe found these,\u201d Boone said, and opened a paper bag that had grease shadows from the lemon doughnuts people had been choking down with beer. Photographs slid into Zante\u2019s palm. Lips. So close-farmed that you could see the powdery coat of sugar on one mouth, the cracked dentist-candy stripe on another. One set that looked bruised but might only have been painted purple in the way children paint. No teeth show. That fact bothered Zante in a way she did not explain even to herself.\n\n\u201cThese were left in the playhouse by the swings,\u201d Boone said. He was gentle with the words, like they could break into panic in his throat. \u201cKids go in there all the time. Moms sit outside and scroll through. It\u2019s not their fault. I keep telling anyone who tries to say that.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is no one\u2019s fault to trust a soft afternoon,\u201d Zante said. \u201cIs it a single photographer?\u201d She tilted the stack so that the light passed again over the glossy prints, saw the same slight misalignment in the grain of the paper. The same font on the back, a series number. Each print signed with a single initial\u2014A.\n\n\u201cThe rumor,\u201d Boone said. He flushed. \u201cThe rumor is stupid.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat rumor isn\u2019t?\u201d Zante looked at the puddle again, then at the footprints hardening into nothing. \u201cSay it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe rumor says she\u2019s huge. Like folklore huge. Like she stepped straight out of some old bedtime tale and got mad because no one tells bedtime. Like she\u2019s jealous that everything you could ever want to watch is in your phone, and nobody leaves milk or coins on the windowsill anymore. I know. But\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cShe?\u201d\n\n\u201cEverybody says she. They call her Abigail. Don\u2019t know why. The name\u2019s just there now. Like a... hitchhiker you can\u2019t not see.\u201d\n\nZante said nothing for a moment. Abigail. She rolled the name slowly through her mind, as if it had grown spines overnight. Her Abigail was probably arranging prints on a studio wall, glass of water sweating a ring onto the old table she refused to refinish. Her Abigail would say I told you, with no smugness, just the frankness that had seduced Zante\u2019s caution into sleep.\n\n\u201cYou have the parents somewhere quiet?\u201d Zante asked finally.\n\n\u201cAt home,\u201d Boone said. \u201cThe girl\u2019s father\u2019s a baker. He\u2019s been bringing loaves to the station since my first day. I want to bring him something. Past the mail, you know? But what do you bring. There\u2019s no\u2014\u201d He cut off. In the shallow shade of the live oaks, his eyes were soft and useless.\n\n\u201cYou bring your listening,\u201d Zante said. \u201cAnd polite water. And you bring the truth, gently. And if you pray, you pray first and again later.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou think it\u2019s the same as the Killearn case?\u201d Boone asked. \u201cThe one with the three Polaroids left in the park band shell?\u201d\n\nZante turned the photographs over in her gloved hand. The edges of the images had the faintly warm feel of instant film, but the stock was modern. Someone was pretending at nostalgia. Someone wanted to be myth and was willing to buy the supplies.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s the same, it\u2019s the same person finding a new height,\u201d she said, not answering the biggest question. \u201cOr pretending to be bigger. You like the word giant because it lets you stop making small choices.\u201d\n\nBoone frowned. \u201cYou think somebody\u2019s staging the footprints?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat footprints?\u201d Zante hadn\u2019t looked for prints yet. It wasn\u2019t as if there would be prints, big or otherwise. But at his face, she straightened and followed his gesture.\n\nHe led her to a long shallow mark along the grass. It hadn\u2019t rained, but the sprinklers had done their midnight work. The imprint of something long and flat had pushed the blades down in an oval. Another, twenty feet away. No toes, no heel. As if a rowboat had taken a stroll, skidding on its underside in slow arcs.\n\n\u201cKids tried to stand in them,\u201d Boone said, a little fierce. \u201cWe sent them home. Ground\u2019s already springing up, see? The earth forgets quickly.\u201d\n\nZante went on one knee and placed her palm on the crushed grass as if feeling a pulse. The day-long heat rose into her skin.\n\n\u201cIf you had a huge foot, you\u2019d leave more than this,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you had a cart on skids and a telephone pole, you might mimic it with some practice and whiskey.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut why?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause someone wants us to look up. Because someone wants us to tell a story about big things.\u201d\n\nBoone swallowed, his throat working visibly. \u201cWe\u2019re missing a girl. I don\u2019t want to look clever on the news. I want\u2014the obvious.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have never once found the obvious to be anything but rude,\u201d Zante said. Her voice softened. \u201cI know what you want. I want the same. And I want a world where no one whispers children\u2019s names in the wrong past tense.\u201d\n\nThat night, Abigail came home late, smelling faintly of developer and something sweet and a little too coppery. Zante was at the table with three notebooks and a bowl of cherries. She wrote with a pencil. She always had liked the impermanence of lead.\n\n\u201cYou came home,\u201d Abigail said, in a tone that made it sound as if the choice were surprising every time.\n\n\u201cI do that,\u201d Zante said, not looking up yet. She finished the sentence she was coaxing, placed the pencil carefully on the open page.\n\n\u201cEveryone asked me if I\u2019m okay,\u201d Abigail went on. \u201cAt the studio. As if the weirdness is a smoke only some lungs deserve.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you?\u201d Zante\u2019s eyes met hers. Abigail\u2019s pupils were bigger than the light warranted; they tended to be that way at night.\n\n\u201cI am the okay that everyone else can stand,\u201d Abigail said. She walked to the sink, ran the tap, let the glass fill and overflow into her hand. \u201cYou were at the fairground?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a parking lot now.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey found pictures again.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d Zante tapped the edge of her notebook. Her days were built of facts and fissures. \u201cMouths,\u201d she said.\n\nAbigail hoisted herself onto the counter, her bare feet swinging slightly, touching the cabinet doors like metronomes. \u201cPeople don\u2019t like mouths,\u201d she said. \u201cThey like the idea of the eye, the soul-window, whatever. But the mouth is the errand-runner of the soul. It\u2019s where the promise goes from thought to thing. That scares them.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt scares them because it betrays them,\u201d Zante said evenly, and Abigail smiled, because Zante understood the work even when she wasn\u2019t trying.\n\nAbigail\u2019s hair smelled like rain and metal and something else. Zante lifted her own glass, took a sip, and waited for the part of the evening where the quiet unclenched enough to be named. Abigail let the faucet keep running and then remembered and turned it off with an apology to no one.\n\n\u201cI heard it again today,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cHeard what?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe name. Abigail. The giant. It\u2019s almost funny until it puts its hands on your back.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a name like any other.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s mine.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can share it,\u201d Zante said, but there was a small press in her chest she refused to call dread.\n\n\u201cDo you think she\u2019s real?\u201d Abigail asked. She was watching Zante\u2019s mouth. She did that when she wanted to borrow a truth.\n\n\u201cI think people are missing,\u201d Zante said. She got up to rinse the cherries. She did not say that the story of big feet is easier to hold than the story of a hand that fits inside a doorjamb.\n\n\u201cWhen you were a detective,\u201d Abigail said, \u201cdid you ever have to consider a suspect twice because you loved them?\u201d She said it like a thought you\u2019d throw away if it didn\u2019t catch air.\n\nZante turned, slowly. \u201cWhat is this.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m asking.\u201d Abigail slid down from the counter, her feet soft on the floor. \u201cHypothetically. You know how people are. They gossip. They say. They\u2019ll look at my cameras, my lips. They\u2019ll pick at names. And you\u2019ll have to talk to me like I might be a person who...\u201d\n\n\u201cWho what?\u201d Zante\u2019s voice sharpened, then softened again. \u201cYou are not the rumor. You know what I think of rumors.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou think they\u2019re lazy.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think they\u2019re hungry and have terrible table manners.\u201d\n\nAbigail lifted her shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s a good line.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s also true,\u201d Zante said. \u201cDo you want to tell me something, Abi?\u201d\n\nAbigail\u2019s mouth tightened, then loosened. She had a beautiful mouth. People had told her that all her life. It had made her practice closing it.\n\n\u201cOnly,\u201d she said, \u201cthat I\u2019m colder when I should be warm. It\u2019s August and I keep getting cold.\u201d\n\nZante crossed to her and touched her arm, felt the fine cool sweat there. \u201cHot then cold,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s Florida. The AC everywhere is a sin and a kindness.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m jealous,\u201d Abigail said suddenly, the word leaving her almost by accident, like a hiccup you\u2019d hoped to swallow. \u201cOf all the little people who know how to be just that. Little. Quiet. Loved for it.\u201d\n\nZante felt her eyebrows lift.\n\n\u201cI should have been born a bird with a long shadow,\u201d Abigail said. She laughed, but it was a brittle thing. \u201cForget I said that.\u201d\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d Zante said softly. She put her palm on the back of Abigail\u2019s neck. She could feel the muscle, the slow tension. She could never quite tell where Abigail ended and performance began. Maybe that was true of everyone. Maybe that was why Abigail\u2019s photographs unsettled, because mouths forget to perform when they\u2019re close enough to the lens to feel embarrassed.\n\nOutside, a truck downshifted and groaned like old bones. The house took the sound and held it in the eaves. Zante went back to her notebooks when Abigail slipped into the bath. She could hear the water running again. She ran her finger along a line she\u2019d written and wasn\u2019t sure she agreed with herself. Sometimes the pencil seemed to have its own notion of truth, and she let it.\n\nAt midnight, the phone in the hallway rang once, twice, a little too fast. Zante lifted it and said hello in a voice that apologized for being awake.\n\nBoone\u2019s voice came back, almost a whisper. \u201cWe got something. You\u2019ll want to see.\u201d He gave her the address of a park at the edge of town, where the lakes smelt like their own summers, where the boardwalk creaked under tourists and joggers and children throwing bread that wasn\u2019t for birds.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be there,\u201d Zante said.\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t ask what.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have stopped asking that on the phone,\u201d she said, which was true. The answer was always someone\u2019s breathing or the lack of it.\n\nShe wrote a note for Abigail and placed it on the kitchen tile because the counter was still damp. Gone to help Boone. Back before the light grows. Love you. She stared at the Love you, turned the pencil to the eraser, then didn\u2019t. She left it alone. They had an agreement to make statements and not undo them in the small hours.\n\nThe park was empty except for the kind of empty that is actually a chorus. The insects stuttered and sang, the water moved its small shoulders under the stars, someone in a house across the way told an unhappy dog that everything was fine. Zante pulled into grass and killed the lights. She saw Boone\u2019s silhouette near the boardwalk rail and another smaller shape crouched in the waiting posture of those who have learned not to move until asked.\n\n\u201cDetect\u2014\u201d the smaller shape said automatically, then stumbled. \u201cVicar. Sorry.\u201d\n\n\u201cZante works,\u201d she said. She recognized Lyle, the forensic tech whose hair looked always recently cut by a friend. He handed her a flashlight, its heft like something old-fashioned and comforting. Better than those too-bright LEDs that erase shadows. She liked shadows to speak before she forced them into confession.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not blood,\u201d Lyle said quickly. \u201cJust paint. On the boards. It\u2019s washed where the sprinklers hit, but you can see where they... paced it out.\u201d\n\nPaced. There were marks\u2014dark, slightly sticky still, in big ovals. Someone had lifted a bucket and set it down in a pattern that implied strides. Farther apart than a human\u2019s could be, unless the human was running hurdles with a freakish efficiency. The ovals were not perfect. They were overwhelmed by their own attempt at hugeness.\n\n\u201cHow many?\u201d Zante asked.\n\n\u201cFourteen,\u201d Lyle said. \u201cIt ends by that bench, and the last two go off into the grass, where everything\u2019s too messy to talk back.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd here,\u201d Boone said, lowering his voice further, as if the lake might eavesdrop and repeat him to trees, \u201chere we found this.\u201d\n\nIt was a picture, of course. Lips, of course. This one smaller, printed on thinner paper, not instant film. A child\u2019s mouth, a missing tooth. The kind of raw gap that makes a smile look new-made and hopeful. There was a ring of sticky red around the edges as if someone had colored outside the line. But the red was nothing that belonged to a body. It was the same paint that had made the walking ovals.\n\nThe picture had been propped against a pair of flip-flops. Blue, with a cartoon fish embossed where a big toe would rest. Size small enough to break your heart.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re Maybelle\u2019s,\u201d Boone said. \u201cShe got them yesterday.\u201d\n\nZante put a hand on the back of the bench so she could feel something that had not been moved. The night pushed softly into her lungs. She kept her eyes on the lake, because sometimes if you did not stare at the thing that frightened you, it would walk into your peripheral and reveal itself as a smaller thing.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a pattern,\u201d Lyle said, because that is what forensic techs like best. \u201cThree days between this and Killearn. Two weeks between Killearn and the one at Levy Park. And\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to stop the pattern,\u201d Boone said. He said it like a spell he wanted to believe in. He looked at Zante. \u201cRight?\u201d\n\nZante felt something old shift inside her. The thing that made her cruel when she needed to be, and kind when it cost her. The thing that had gotten her out of high-visibility jackets and into a collar she had truly chosen. The thing that could flip between interrogating and absolving without moving her feet.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to interrupt it,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to make it trip on itself.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow?\u201d Lyle asked, breathless, young.\n\n\u201cBy refusing to play big,\u201d Zante said. \u201cBy letting small see us.\u201d\n\nThey worked the scene until the sky forgot its dark. Zante watched the sprinklers come on and glitter the paint into lesser ovals. She watched the mist hover around Boone\u2019s shoulders like ghosts of possibilities, then fall. She watched a heron decide that the day was coming and would not be argued with, and she admired it for the indifference.\n\nAt home, the house smelled of shampoo and sleeping. Abigail lay on her side, one arm flung above her head like a flag. Zante\u2019s note was at the edge of the rug where a shoe could catch it. The pencil mark of Love you looked stodgy in the early light, and for a second Zante thought about writing the words again, soon, in a way that didn\u2019t look like a homework answer. She brushed hair from Abigail\u2019s cheek and saw a faint smudge along the jawline, the color of the paint in the park when it had been thinned by dew.\n\n\u201cCamera smudge,\u201d Abigail murmured, half-awake. \u201cDon\u2019t interrogate me in bed, Zan.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t,\u201d Zante said, even though she had been, with her eyes.\n\n\u201cYou smell like grass.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been in it.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverything is a sermon,\u201d Abigail sighed. \u201cEven your being in the grass.\u201d\n\nZante undressed and stood a minute at the window. The neighbors\u2019 cat.\nThe slow dawn. The city stretching off its small aches. She thought about feet. She thought about jealousy. She thought about vows made with mouths, and about how some people used cameras, and how some people used stories. She thought about the name Abigail, and about how names can be so light and so heavy at once, like a balloon tied to a stone. She thought about the bench by the lake and the flip-flops and the gap in the missing tooth, that little square of truth, and she prayed without words, because words had taken the night off.\n\nShe slept then, a little, and dreamt of walking ovals. In the dream, the ovals lengthened and shortened depending on how fast you believed. In the dream, someone very tall stooped to enter a doorway that insisted on being ordinary, and the stoop was the saddest part, not the height.\n\nThe week moved. The heat drew everything sticky. People came in to talk to Zante and left again leaning against the doorframe for an extra second, as if touching wood would rub off a blessing. Middle-schoolers traded dares at bus stops about keeping a coin on their tongues for an hour to confuse the giant. Someone made a T-shirt with a crude drawing of a woman stepping on a line of faceless stick figures and the caption Don\u2019t Be Little. The T-shirt sold out fast. People wore irony as a kind of sunscreen.\n\n\u201cCome tonight,\u201d Abigail said one evening, shoving a postcard toward Zante. \u201cOpening at the studio. Lips and Lies. I figured if they\u2019re going to make me the villain, I may as well curate the exhibit.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bad time to invite eyes,\u201d Zante said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a worse time to hide,\u201d Abigail said. She had written the title on the card herself in a hand that looked like it had never been taught to compromise on loops. \u201cPeople are going to put me in your rumor whether I ask them to or not. Let me choose the frame.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have to meet Boone,\u201d Zante said, and saw the small jealous flare in Abigail\u2019s face like a match that wanted to be a torch and knew better. \u201cI\u2019ll come after,\u201d she amended. \u201cI\u2019ll be late, but I\u2019ll come.\u201d\n\n\u201cBring your collar,\u201d Abigail said, half a joke, half a dare.\n\n\u201cI always have it,\u201d Zante said, which was usually true. The white strip of faith in a world that would try to tear it from her, or tuck it in her pocket. She liked how it made people remember their own sentences.\n\nThat night, a storm bruised the north, then decided to make up and took its lightning elsewhere. Zante and Boone sat in a patrol car outside a park that had not yet been blessed by rumor. They watched the emptiness, and they waited to interrupt a pattern. It was boring, and Zante loved it. Patience was a cathedral.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re baying for a giant in my inbox,\u201d Boone said, tapping his phone and then turning it face-down as if that could hush it. \u201cParents. Reporters. Strangers. They want one big story they can fold into a headline, one big villain to feed and chase.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe greatest kindness you can give people,\u201d Zante said, \u201cis a smaller story.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou talk like a vicar.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause it\u2019s true,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd because you want me to say I don\u2019t believe in giants. And I don\u2019t. And because I know that sometimes the small person inside someone very ordinary learns to make their shadow big.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe or he,\u201d Boone said, careful.\n\n\u201cShe,\u201d Zante said, and even the word felt complicated in her throat.\n\nWhen the night was far along and the crickets were exhausted with their own insisting, Zante\u2019s phone buzzed. Abigail: the opening is a circus. Wish you were here to bless it and also curse it.\n\nZante: I\u2019ll come in an hour.\n\nAbigail: Promise with your mouth?\n\nZante smiled in the glow. She typed, Yes. She put the phone away and peered out at the line of cattails doing their careful dance.\n\nThe trap they had set was not clever. They had left nothing obvious to tempt anyone. They had simply been present where a pattern said someone might come. Twice, a raccoon considered them. Once, a boy on a bike stopped and stared and then pedaled away, singing under his breath to prove that he was fearless. Zante watched the path and the dark and the places where the dark was lighter, and she thought of the opening with its wine and its lips on walls, and of Abigail in her dress with pockets, joking about being a myth in comfortable shoes.\n\nAt almost midnight, across the way, something moved. Something that could have been a person but felt like a mistake the landscape was trying out. The motion had a slow deliberation. Zante leaned forward. The figure paused by the bench. It was wrong in the scaling\u2014too tall and too thin, as if legs that didn\u2019t belong to the torso had decided to attend the event and make the torso catch up. The head turned toward them. The face was a blur of shadow.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t switch on the headlights,\u201d Zante said, in a voice that contained a steel buckle. \u201cDon\u2019t. Let it think we\u2019re just talking. Let it try to be a legend.\u201d\n\nBoone\u2019s hands were white on the wheel. Lyle, in the back, held his breath like it owed him money. The figure took a step\u2014long, improbable. It carried something in both hands, held out and low, as if serving a tray of pieces of night.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that,\u201d Boone whispered.\n\n\u201cPhotographs,\u201d Zante said. \u201cOr the opposite of.\u201d\n\nThe figure reached the bench and arranged its objects there, tender as a nurse with a sleeping child. Then it straightened and did the thing that made Zante\u2019s heart misstep: it lifted one foot high, too high, held it, and brought it down slowly, deliberately, like an actor hitting a mark that had been taped to a floor no one else could see. The sound it made was not the sound a true giant would make. It was hollow and a little ridiculous and precisely what the rumor had ordered.\n\n\u201cNow,\u201d Zante said, and Boone flicked the headlights and the siren yipped to life, once, twice. In the sudden glare, the figure panicked. It turned half-sideways. For a heartbeat, Zante saw the long shadow of it peel from the ground and curl back. She saw the contraption that graced its legs\u2014stilts strapped to thighs with smart leather, the kind used in the circus and in protest marches, the kind you could rent from a place in the warehouse district if you gave a good reason. She saw a mask that was in fact a hood pulled low, and the glint of a lens hanging at the throat like a small, rude heart.\n\nIt ran. Or tried to run, but stilts aren\u2019t good for running, and stories aren\u2019t good for fleeing when the truth has put on its boots. Boone and Lyle were out and moving, and Zante was out too, not trusting her own knees and trusting them anyway. The figure kicked and faltered, and in three fast seconds they were on it, and the figure was on the ground, and the stilts lay akimbo like arguments that had never been persuasive.\n\n\u201cHands,\u201d Boone said, and the figure lifted them.\n\nThin fingers. Black gloves. A ring on the fourth finger left hand, scratched.\n\nZante felt the world do a peculiar slide then, as if the angle of the ground had shifted by a degree.\n\n\u201cTake off the hood,\u201d she said. \u201cSlowly.\u201d\n\nThe figure hesitated. Then obeyed. The hood fell away. Hair, damp with sweat, and a face that had learned how to be two things at once, and a mouth Zante knew well enough to name.\n\n\u201cAbi,\u201d she said, impossibly calm, impossibly not calm. \u201cGet up.\u201d\n\nAbigail looked up at her wife. The eyes were dark, the pupils bigger than any night required. Her face held no surprise. It held a weariness, a relief, a defiance, all slipping surfaces.\n\n\u201cI walked too big,\u201d Abigail said, voice raw like rope-burn. \u201cYou wanted small.\u201d\n\nBehind them, the lake sighed. In the bench\u2019s shadow, under the hard blankness of the headlights, a fan of photographs shone. Lips, lips, lips. Little ink notes on the backs in Abigail\u2019s precise hand. Names. Dates. No graphic cruelty, nothing you could hold up to a court and say Look, look what she did. But every image a trespass, a taking.\n\nBoone made a noise like swallowing a nail. Lyle whispered what people whisper when any magic turns into an ordinary mess.\n\nZante said nothing. She held her collar with one hand, felt its edge. She tried to make the world stop its slide and stand still enough for her to meet it. She looked at Abigail\u2014the woman from the front pew, the woman who had caught a bird with her bare hands once and set it free without leaving a feather behind, the woman whose jealousy had always been beautiful when it was about little things, sweaters at thrift stores, bruised peaches, other people\u2019s fences.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re doing this here?\u201d Abigail said, and smiled, small and crooked. \u201cWith the mouth you told me to trust?\u201d\n\nZante looked at the stilts in the grass, at the ring on Abigail\u2019s finger, at the way the truth had decided to dance just out of time. She wanted to say a thousand things, each weighted, each a vow or a curse or a prayer. She wanted to say: There is a big story. She wanted to say: You are not a giant. She wanted to say: Stop being the weather in other people\u2019s skies. She wanted to say: I love you. She wanted to say: My love is smaller now. Or bigger. Or sideways.\n\nIn the end, she said only: \u201cTake a breath.\u201d\n\nAbigail did. It sounded, for a brief, aching second, like the first breath any child ever takes when it decides to be here. Then the siren yipped again, as if to remind the air of its other uses, and the night went on being night, in the way it does, even as all the names inside it shift.By morning the city had learned to pronounce what happened at the lake in three different ways. In the first version, the police caught the giant, easy as catching a frog in a coffee can if you have the timing. In the second, a woman on stilts proved that everyone was stupid for believing anything larger than a shoe. In the third, the vicar\u2019s wife was an artist who confused the size of her feelings with the size of her body, and the vicar had the look of someone who had mistaken love for a reliable witness. Radio hosts chewed the facts until they were flavorless and then spit them between jokes. The meteorologist used phrases like unstable air mass and everyone heard unstable and wished they didn\u2019t.\n\nThey put Abigail in a room with a camera and a table so clean the light invented fingerprints to feel useful. Boone would have preferred to hand her to strangers in suits, but Tallahassee doesn\u2019t have as many of those as a bigger city, and besides, every stranger in a suit eventually wants to talk to a vicar. Zante stood in the hallway with her collar in her pocket because she did not trust what it would remind people of, and also because the plastic chair there made wearing holiness feel theatrical. She could see Abigail through the slat of the blinds. It felt indecent, the way watching your own house from the sidewalk feels indecent even when you have a key.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t be in there,\u201d Boone said for the fourth time, and the fourth time Zante said, \u201cI am not in there, Sergeant. I am in the hall, being furniture.\u201d He ran a hand over his jaw and made a sound that was part apology and part relief. The two of them were learning the choreography of impossible days. Don\u2019t call it a dance. No one was wearing the right shoes.\n\nThey sent in a woman from Records who knew how to ask stupid questions that get smart answers. \u201cName?\u201d she said, and Abigail, thin shoulders set, enunciated each syllable like a bead on a rosary. \u201cOccupation?\u201d \u201cPhotographer.\u201d \u201cDo you enjoy your work?\u201d \u201cEnjoy is a fragile word.\u201d It was theater, and it wasn\u2019t. Every interrogation is a performance, but the good ones allow the actor to forget she is acting for three minutes and in those three minutes she tells you where the doorway is.\n\nZante did not watch when they read the rights. She did not have a taste for the sound of law being recited like weather. She looked instead at her own thumbnail and saw a crescent of blue paint she had missed in the early kitchen light. It wasn\u2019t a sign; it was contact. She had touched the bench, touched the photographs, touched a night that had touched everything and everyone. She rubbed the paint away against the seam of her trousers and felt like a magician with no tricks left but misdirection.\n\nAbigail did not ask for a lawyer for precisely twenty-seven minutes. Then she did, and the room halted like a toy train, and all the adults in the hallway remembered they were in a building where the vending machine was always empty of Dr Pepper. Boone cursed softly at the air, and the air didn\u2019t change its mind. They set it up for morning, a lawyer from a firm with a name like a polite cough. Until then, nothing big could be said, only small questions with answers that were shaped like fog.\n\n\u201cIs she going to tell us where the girl is?\u201d Boone asked, and Zante realized the pronoun had proven too cumbersome for him to adjust. She did not correct him. You spend all your corrections on the things you can move.\n\n\u201cShe will tell you what she has made,\u201d Zante said. \u201cShe will not tell you what she hasn\u2019t. Not because she won\u2019t, but because she can\u2019t. She doesn\u2019t have it in her mouth.\u201d It was an odd phrase, but it felt right. There are truths you can hold easily in your hands and others that you can hold only with the tongue, tasting their shape until the taste becomes a word.\n\nThe statement they were allowed to take was small. Abigail admitted to the stilts. She admitted to buying paint in three colors because art school had taught her that the eye wants variation even when the lie is monochrome. She admitted to placing photographs \u201cas a conversation,\u201d which is the kind of phrase that makes a detective rearrange his expression so his face doesn\u2019t blurt his opinion. She admitted to moving Maybelle\u2019s flip-flops because \u201cthey were sad by themselves.\u201d She did not admit to taking Maybelle. She said the name carefully each time, as if it might shatter if any syllable grazed a tooth. When asked where she found the flip-flops, she said near the edge of the boardwalk, \u201ccaught on a knot the city has never sanded,\u201d and Boone wrote that wording down because exact phrases sometimes point to places the body misses.\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t call anyone when you saw them,\u201d the woman from Records said, not with accusation, but with a steady kind of disappointment, like a grandmother who has found beer in the garage and wanted craft and found cheap.\n\n\u201cI left them where the city would look,\u201d Abigail said, and then closed her eyes as if hearing herself from somewhere slightly to the left. \u201cI wanted them found by a story. I should have wanted them found by a person.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou made the giant,\u201d the woman said. \u201cOr helped it be made.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople were hungry and I brought spoons,\u201d Abigail said, and something like shame passed through the room and briefly wrung it out.\n\nThey booked Abigail on anything they could book her on without pretending the justice system was a vending machine. Tampering. False reporting. Trespass. The phrases didn\u2019t sit well on the desk. They were technicalities trying on moral suits. Boone filled out forms because his hands needed the ritual. He called the man with the stilt rental, who said yes, that girl, she had cash and a face made of daring, and he had asked her what she intended and she said \u201cheight,\u201d and he had told her to be careful, because height is a thing you fall from.\n\nWhen Zante stepped outside, the humidity sat up and asked her what she was doing. The parking lot\u2019s glare was church-bright; everything honest looked guilty in it. She thought of going home and decided that home wasn\u2019t a place she could put her body without her mind starting a fire there. She drove instead toward Gaines Street, the part of town that had rehearsed being a different city and then decided to keep its old name. The studio\u2019s windows were still crowded with last night\u2019s faces, framed and lit so that mouths took on the reckless power of eyes.\n\nThe key under the third potted fern worked. She had it because Abigail had made the concept of spare keys feel like a trust exercise she liked winning. Inside, the air smelled like chemicals and the ghosts of fruit, the way a candy store might smell after it had decided to get serious. The floor had paint on it that had been there long enough to form its own opinions. On the big worktable, a fan of contact prints; the panes of small pictures felt like a child\u2019s game that had become something else when no one was watching. Names on the back of some, just descriptors on others. Tooth. Sneeze. Summer. Promise. There was a system and it offended Zante that she couldn\u2019t see it at a glance.\n\nShe didn\u2019t touch anything she couldn\u2019t justify later. She walked to the back room and found the drawer that stuck and opened it anyway with a patience Abigail rarely used. The digital things nested there like insects that knew they were useful but pretended not to be proud of it. One camera was on and shouldn\u2019t have been. Zante picked it up and cooed the way you coo to something you suspect will bite. The screen showed thumbnails of mouths, yes, and between them, three photographs that were not mouths: a boardwalk knot close-up, the kind that catches a strap; a child\u2019s glove, the cheap stretchy kind, balled in the angle where a bench meets shadow; and a paper cup from a lemonade stand, crushed, with the word FRESH interrupted by a thumb.\n\nShe did not take the card. She did not even scroll. She put the camera back where it would look like indifference. She stepped to the sink. On the lip there was a dotted line of something that looked black and was, when she rubbed it, a deep purple. Lipstick, the kind chosen by people who want to look like a bruise is a decision. Abigail didn\u2019t own that shade. Abigail said colors were better when they asked for forgiveness before they suggested sin. Someone else had been in the studio, or someone in the studio had borrowed a mouth.\n\nOn the drive to the Jarvis house, the road\u2019s heat shimmered like an afterthought the sky had already regretted. The street had the kind of trees that make you think cities forgive more than they do. Maybelle\u2019s father opened the door with the expression of a man who has been taught for years how to greet, and woke to find he had forgotten his manners. He was not wearing his apron; he was wearing an old T-shirt that said HOLE FOODS because bakers make puns or endure them. The living room had a couch that had taught generations of naps how to behave. The shoe from the fair sat on a chair by itself, as if time-out might staunch the bleeding of absence.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not the police,\u201d Zante said, and felt the lie in the second syllable. She was the police in a way that couldn\u2019t be turned off. She introduced Boone because manners are a rope you can hold even when the bridge has fallen. She did not apologize for breathing their air.\n\n\u201cMy daughter won\u2019t even know she\u2019s missing,\u201d the father said. \u201cShe\u2019ll think she\u2019s in a line for something fun and she\u2019ll be so patient. The patience will kill me.\u201d He rubbed the back of his neck. His hand stopped at the crest of muscle again and again like a wave that didn\u2019t believe in the shore. \u201cThey said you caught\u2026\u201d He didn\u2019t finish the sentence. You don\u2019t put a wife\u2019s name on a hook in a house where photographs of field-day ribbons hang.\n\n\u201cWe caught a theater,\u201d Zante said gently. \u201cWe did not catch what we need.\u201d\n\nHe nodded and led them to Maybelle\u2019s room because people do that, as if rooms can offer the kind of answers people won\u2019t. It was small and intentional. A poster of a whale with its rib lines drawn like the bars on a musical staff. A book on the bed open to a page where someone had underlined the word lighthouse because Maybelle had liked how solid the H looked. The second flip-flop was not there. Zante had not expected it to be. On the dresser, pennies in a dish. Boone looked at them like they were a test. He and pennies had history; every cop has at least one useless object he has sworn allegiance to because on one day years ago it felt like a talisman.\n\n\u201cWas Maybelle at the library a lot?\u201d Zante asked, watching the father\u2019s eyes, because eyes are where homes speak when they think they are being polite.\n\n\u201cAir conditioning,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd because the woman at the desk told her she had the best questions. Didn\u2019t answer them. Just told her the questions were heavy in a good way.\u201d He breathed out and his breath stumbled on a word that wouldn\u2019t form. \u201cWe were there that night, before the fair. Not long. She wanted to show me how the printer makes everything smell hot.\u201d\n\nThe library held onto cool like a principle. The reference desk woman wore her hair in a bun that had graduated from experiments to policy. She remembered Zante by name because people in this city remembered in a way that felt like a habit you could lean against. \u201cI know you\u2019ll ask what I saw,\u201d she said, and then paused to slide a returned book under the scanner like a priest laying a wafer on a tongue. \u201cI saw mouths. Or rather, I saw not seeing mouths. People always talk with their hands when they\u2019re being quiet. When that fan of photographs was lying there, the hands in this room got loud.\u201d\n\nShe told them, and it was mostly absence. Someone had placed the lips by the stacks, someone with hands that didn\u2019t want to be careful and tried to be anyway. She had put them in a folder because that felt less like touching and more like respect. A girl with a gap in her teeth had laughed when she saw the pictures because losing a tooth is the only time that the body\u2019s losses look like wins. A woman with purple on her mouth the color of night flowers had leaned too close to the prints, left a smudge that refused to be only ink. \u201cWe don\u2019t get a lot of lipstick here,\u201d the reference woman said with quiet scorn. \u201cMouths here are mostly practical.\u201d\n\n\u201cNight flowers,\u201d Zante repeated. The phrase fit the color she had found on the sink. She asked for camera feeds she knew wouldn\u2019t exist in any way that would help. The library has cameras the way museums have cameras: to prove they cared after the fact and to offer grainy ghosts that cannot be forced to testify. She watched Maybelle and her father move through a frame like a lesson in how to be small and still be the center of something. She watched a woman with a wide forehead pass behind them, caught for a second and then gone. She watched herself watch and felt the day shift again, slow and mean as molasses.\n\nIn the afternoon, the press conference tasted like pennies. Boone stood and said the words that would stop other words from eating him alive. \u201cWe have a person of interest,\u201d he said, because that phrase allows everyone to hate without a name tag. \u201cWe are pursuing all leads.\u201d \u201cWe ask the public to refrain from speculation,\u201d he said, which is like asking rain to refrain from wetness. He did not say Abigail\u2019s name, and the name got said anyway. It threaded through the crowd, softened, sharpened, lifted like a kite, got stuck in a tree.\n\nAfter, in a corner where the paint had decided to peel, Zante stood with a woman whose child had been found once, a different year, a different park. \u201cThey made this city a monster,\u201d the woman said, and then caught herself and said, \u201cNo, that\u2019s wrong. The city has a monster. That\u2019s the way to give the sidewalks a chance.\u201d She squeezed Zante\u2019s arm and left, walking with the stride of someone who refuses to be late for anything anymore.\n\nThe lawyer arrived with a briefcase nothing important would fit into and a voice that had learned how to sound like a fence. Abigail met him with relief and annoyance. \u201cYou\u2019ll tell me not to tell them everything,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019ll hide me in words like possibly and allegedly until I can\u2019t find my own hands.\u201d He raised an eyebrow, and it was a better answer than a rebuke. Abby listened with her shoulders but not with her eyes.\n\nWhen they sat again, the room hummed with the kind of quiet that checks wristwatches. The lawyer said no questions about the child and Abigail said I will answer anything that is a sentence I have written. Boone nodded as if that were reasonable and then asked three unreasonable questions, because that\u2019s the way they teach you. The last one made something in Abigail flinch like a deer remembering the geometry of a road.\n\n\u201cWho else has a key to your studio?\u201d he said. \u201cWho else has been in and out this past week?\u201d\n\n\u201cLots of people were there,\u201d she said. \u201cOpening.\u201d She counted on her fingers without looking. \u201cConstance with the red scarf and the opinions. The student who told me I had too much ego and then bought a print. The man who said his wife wouldn\u2019t let him hang my work in their house but he could hide it in his office. The night flowers woman. She said she cared about mouths because her lips were the only part of her face she could afford to change.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe night flowers woman,\u201d Zante said softly, because the word had sat too comfortably in the slot. \u201cPurple lipstick. Did you know her name?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe told me three different ones and I liked all of them,\u201d Abigail said. \u201cShe said lies have the best phonetics.\u201d\n\nAfterward, in the hallway where the air struggled to be neutral, Boone pulled Zante aside. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to be able to hold her on anything very useful,\u201d he said, and the word useful felt ugly even in a place that turned ugliness into procedure. \u201cWe can get her for theater. We can\u2019t get her for the child. If she\u2019s not where the child is, keeping her here leaves us with our hands around a ladder while the fire climbs.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet her go,\u201d Zante said, and she didn\u2019t know whether she was speaking as a vicar or a detective or a wife or a selfish human who wanted to not have her home emptied of a shape. \u201cFollow her with every shadow we can afford. And take me with you when you go small. Big has wasted us.\u201d\n\nThey went small. They went to the fairground lot again, not to step in the long ovals, but to put their faces close to gum and bolts and the way gravel remembers. They talked to teenagers who had learned how to withhold because adults treat their rooms as crime scenes. They talked to the kettle-corn boy who gestured with a scoop like a conductor forced to use a ladle. He said he saw a woman that night who wasn\u2019t tall enough to be a giant and wasn\u2019t trying. She wore a denim jacket in heat that had no business tolerating denim, and she spoke to children in a voice that made the word buddy sound like a contract. She had nails painted a flat pink that made Zante think of erasers.\n\n\u201cCould you smell anything?\u201d Zante asked, expecting the answer no, because smell is the first sense that gives up when faced with popcorn. But the boy, surprised by his own yes, said that the woman smelled like eucalyptus and something else he couldn\u2019t name until he blurted \u201ccoins.\u201d Zante felt the shape of that in her ribs, a memory of walking toward a subway once in a city where the air tastes like pennies and rain. Eucalyptus and coins. Mouthwash and blood wouldn\u2019t be too dramatic if you stretched. She put the picture in a book in her head that she keeps by feeling.\n\nThey knocked at a door two blocks from the library where a woman with night flowers on her mouth would have liked the rent if you believed in stories that tidy. The woman who answered wore chapstick and a stare that had no patience for metaphor. She was not the person they were looking for. But she knew someone who loved purple without irony and she wrote a name on a receipt and the name was the kind that shows up in friends lists like a thorn. Constance with the red scarf, who had argued with Abigail at openings and then moved into her light like a plant.\n\nConstance\u2019s apartment was full of books that had decided to live in stacks instead of shelves. She opened the door with the irritated kindness of someone interrupted in the middle of a page and therefore in the middle of a life. She admitted to loving lipstick. She admitted to hating that love mattered. She denied moving flip-flops. She said that if she were the kind of person to take a child she would take one from another city because she hated hurting her own reflection. It was a terrible joke and the kind that signals a person who uses humor like bleach. Zante watched her hands. She didn\u2019t see the telltale paint in the cuticles. She saw something else: the nervous habit of touching a front tooth with the tip of the tongue, as if checking for a hole that had never existed.\n\nWhen Abigail returned to the house\u2014released on a cloud of conditions that sounded less like mercy than like homework\u2014she paused on the threshold the way a person does when a familiar room has been repainted in their absence. Zante stood at the table with her notebooks open as if she had never left them. They looked as if they had been accused. The bowl of cherries had gone sad. Abigail\u2019s shoulders were high enough that her ears could rest on them if they wanted.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to watch me,\u201d she said, and her mouth shaped the word watch like a child shaping the word monster after checking under the bed and finding an old shoe. \u201cAre you going to watch me?\u201d\n\n\u201cI watched you before,\u201d Zante said. \u201cWatching is what I call love when I\u2019m feeling noble.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou could have left the collar on when you came to the hall,\u201d Abigail said, pretending to be casual and failing in a way that made the truth more handsome. \u201cMight have made you immune to seeing me the way they want you to.\u201d\n\n\u201cI took it off so I wouldn\u2019t use it as a shield,\u201d Zante said. \u201cI don\u2019t believe in shields unless they are made of quieter things. Like bread.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey went to see Maybelle\u2019s father,\u201d Abigail said. She was very bad at hiding that she knew. Some part of her had always studied networks like other people study weather. \u201cDid he bake for them?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe let us into his house,\u201d Zante said. \u201cHe let us into the room where the whale poster is. He has the good kind of patience.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t take her,\u201d Abigail said, and this time there was no theater in it. It arrived in the room with its shoes untied and its hair sticking up and asked for toast. \u201cI wanted to be taller than I was and I took that where it could be applauded. I left props. I hated how the town talked like a chorus that never learned the melody. But my hands are not where that girl is.\u201d\n\nZante believed her the way you believe a sky: not because you are an expert on atmospheres but because you have spent enough time under one to recognize the difference between a threat and a promise. It wasn\u2019t exoneration. It was weather for one day. She crossed to Abigail and put a hand on her cheek and felt a faint grain, as if a fine sand had blown in off a beach that had no business being this far inland. Makeup, cheap powder, too pale, somebody else\u2019s face rehearsed on hers.\n\n\u201cWho touched you?\u201d she asked, and in another room in another decade that question would have been different.\n\n\u201cEveryone likes to touch a photograph,\u201d Abigail said. \u201cLast night they touched me instead. It made me feel like a stair.\u201d Her laugh was small and unconvincing. \u201cOne woman told me her mother used to press her mouth to the bathroom mirror so hard it squeaked. I don\u2019t know what that means, but I can\u2019t stop thinking it.\u201d\n\nThey slept badly. Zante woke at three to a siren in the distance that meant nothing she could fix. She padded to the window and watched the square of yard that had not decided between being grass and being sand. Under the streetlight\u2019s unkindness, a cat considered its body an adequate argument. Zante thought of jealousy and breath and how people make vows with mouths and then use them to invent emergencies. She thought of the park bench and the knot in the wood and the idea of a woman who would put on a denim jacket in August out of habit, the way you wear an old sorrow because it fits.\n\nIn the morning, the message on her phone was from the person you want messages from and dread anyway. Lyle: We ran the paint. It\u2019s theater paint. The kind the university buys by the gallon. We also found fibers on the flip-flops. Carpet, synthetic, low-pile, the color of dust. Not from a house I\u2019d like to live in.\n\nCampus connected the dots if you looked at it with the kind of eyes that had been trained to connect dots even when dots refused. Constance taught two adjunct classes there when the department remembered to send emails. The man with the stilt rentals had once sent flyers for a circus workshop that no one attended because it was held at noon on a Wednesday. The library\u2019s purple-lip woman had a student ID with a name that no longer matched her face and she had taken out books about stagecraft and about reptiles because every person\u2019s curiosity is more interesting than their guilt.\n\nThey went to the theater building and walked past set pieces that look handsome only under light that no one brought. The shop smelled like sawdust and paint and the kind of ambition that never makes it to a marquee. A student with a ponytail that looked like a rope pointed them to a shelf where open gallons allowed their skins to form. The purple was there. A list on the wall in dry erase marker said: Please, for the love of god, relid your paint. A person named JESS had drawn a flower in the corner and the flower looked tired of being petals.\n\n\u201cDo you know a woman who wears denim in August?\u201d Zante asked the rope-ponytail, and the girl smiled because that is not a useful question and yet it is, sometimes. \u201cSandra,\u201d she said, and pointed with her chin. \u201cCostumes. She\u2019s got opinions about temperature and hasn\u2019t lost to it yet.\u201d Sandra had opinions about everything, including who should be allowed to borrow shoes. She had a line of cheap flip-flops under a table, sizes for quick panic fixes onstage. One pair was blue with a cartoon fish, but not the same as Maybelle\u2019s; the fish\u2019s eye was lazy where the fair pair had been alert. \u201cWe get donations,\u201d Sandra said. \u201cPeople bring us their castoffs and blessedly have no idea what actors will do to them.\u201d\n\nIn the costume office, a cup sat abandoned that had the ghost of eucalyptus across its rim. The smell of coins was less polite. A roll of Velcro lay open on the table, its hooks mean and wanting fabric. Zante stood still long enough to feel the building admit it knew the rumors and that rumors are a kind of lighting cue. Boone lifted the roll, set it down, lifted it again because his hand needed to move because his heart was deciding whether to run.\n\n\u201cSmall,\u201d Zante said, and he nodded and went to find Sandra, who turned out to wear denim in defiance and also because her office has air-conditioning issues that no one in Facilities has bothered to fix since 2009. She had the purple on her mouth, yes, but it was the wrong purple, a berry, a forgiveness. She had a smile that looked like she had forgotten to be careful with it.\n\n\u201cChildren?\u201d she said, when they asked their too-careful questions, and her face rearranged itself into something older and knotted. \u201cNo. God, no. I sew for middle-school matinees. I know their noise. I am ruined for evil.\u201d Zante believed her and collected a thread from her cuff anyway because belief is not the same as proof and because sometimes it\u2019s good to have a cup you won\u2019t drink from.\n\nThat afternoon, the river of whispers funnelled through the church regardless of whether the doors were open. People came in and offered Zante casseroles made of beige and their opinions made of bolder colors. Somebody asked whether she would still counsel couples given the circumstances. Somebody else offered to pray for her in a tone that suggested prayer as a weapon. She stood long enough that the skin between her toes remembered sandals as instruments of patience. When the building was as empty as it could manage, she went to the hall and looked at Abigail\u2019s portraits. Mouths, yes. Lines at the edge where words have worn at the skin like tide. A child\u2019s mouth dressed in careful chapstick because a parent had decided that stage had rules.\n\nUnder one frame was a card that had fallen, or been placed. It was not Abigail\u2019s handwriting. The loop was closed where Abigail\u2019s would have risked an opening. The card read: We take from where the talk is. If you want quiet, teach your town to swallow. It was ugly and it was the most honest thing Zante had read all day. She pocketed it not because it was evidence yet, but because it was a map.\n\nThat evening, when the sky had stopped pretending blue and admitted to bruise, Zante sat at the small table and lined up the small things. The paint. The knot in the wood. The smell of eucalyptus and coins. The denim jacket in August, a detail stupid enough to be a signature. The mouths. The way Abigail made big as a form of self-defense and someone else used big as camouflage. The idea that jealousy is not the sin here but hunger is, and that hunger will dress itself in whatever will get it fed.\n\nAbigail came in late again, slower than her usual late. She had been followed by a car that did not signal turns and then did, as if confused by its own choices. She put her keys in a bowl as if putting keys in a bowl could be an apology. She watched Zante watching the table and smiled with a mouth that had practiced bravery and found it heavy to hold.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re putting it together,\u201d she said, and the admission was a blessing or a curse.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m making a small story,\u201d Zante said. \u201cThe kind that can go to the door and ask to be let in.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd if the door doesn\u2019t open?\u201d\n\n\u201cI will learn its hinge by heart,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd then I will choose whether to pick the lock or ask the carpenter to come preach to it.\u201d\n\nAbigail crossed the room to the sink and ran the tap too long and then turned it off like renunciation. She was shivering in a way that wasn\u2019t theatrical. \u201cI wished for a giant so that people would look up and find their own height,\u201d she said. \u201cI forgot that looking up is a way to avoid looking down.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe all forget that,\u201d Zante said. \u201cWhich is why pulpits have steps.\u201d\n\nThey sat in the dark awhile without making a metaphor of it. The house breathed around them, the polite exhale of an air conditioner trying to keep up. Outside, a boy on a bike sang too fast for lyrics to take hold. The night was not a villain. It was a stage. And somewhere, a child with a gap where a tooth should be had been taught patience so well she might be using it against herself. Zante closed her eyes and counted the steps to the park bench and back, as if faith were a pedometer that could award her points for distance.\n\nThe next morning, Boone called before the light rose to say that a maintenance worker at the boardwalk had found something that wasn\u2019t trash pretending to be trash. In the weeds by the last post, tucked where sprinklers would wet but not wash, a foam cooler sat as if it had learned the trick of stillness. Inside, two cans of off-brand soda, a stack of napkins with a taco truck\u2019s logo, a little animal keychain you buy with tickets and regret. A smell that made the worker step back and then lean forward again because the body needs proof. The smell of eucalyptus, heavy and cheap and angry about being found.\n\nZante dressed like a person going to a trial she believed in. She put on the collar because sometimes you wear a sign to remind yourself before it reminds anyone else. She tucked her pencil behind her ear because she trusted it to say no when her mouth had not learned how. At the boardwalk she crouched and asked the cooler to be honest. It wasn\u2019t blood. It wasn\u2019t even frightening in a way that would satisfy a headline. It was a kit for pretending to be someone a child will follow. She felt something in her chest that had been pretending to be a stone admit it had been an egg all along.\n\n\u201cThere,\u201d Lyle said, pointing with the kind of reverence he reserves for clues that don\u2019t mind being touched. A hair caught under the cooler\u2019s handle tape, pale, blunt at the end, cut by a cheap pair of scissors. They would send it for the kind of test people trust too much. They would get a color and a shape and maybe a name. Or they would get noise. It didn\u2019t matter yet. What mattered was the map the small things made and the way it pointed not to giants, but to hands.\n\nZante stood and looked out at the water and made herself count fish she could not see. She thought of a woman in a denim jacket and the sound the word buddy makes when you sand it wrong. She thought of a building where the air conditioner still owed favors to 2009. She thought of mouths and the way they promise us and betray us in the same sugar breath. She thought of love and its lousy timing and its excellent precision when it wants to break you kindly. She thought: small. She thought: hinge. She thought: I am coming, Maybelle, with a pocket full of tiny tools and a mouth that knows how to keep a vow in pieces until it\u2019s safe to be whole.Chapter Five\n\nThe cooler made a kind of sense once they laid its guts out on the bench and called each thing by its name. The sodas were a brand that pretended to be famous if you squinted at the font\u2014NovaFizz, citrus and cola, the bargain store\u2019s way of being generous. The napkins were from El Rey, the taco truck that parked by different waters on different nights, its crowned avocado logo smug in a way Zante almost admired. The keychain was a neon cat with a bell that would make adults twitch and children smile as if they were hearing destiny in cheap metal. The tape had caught that pale hair under its fold, the blunt end announcing scissors rather than a bathroom drain. The smell of eucalyptus was the loudest thing, shouting in a register usually reserved for dental waiting rooms, and under it was the heavier breath of coins, that copper insistence that the world keeps score.\n\n\u201cSmall hinges,\u201d Zante said more to the air than to Boone. \u201cThis is a door with a lot of them.\u201d He nodded in a way that meant he would hold one end if she would hold the other. Lyle bagged the bell, the napkins, the hair, doing that neat-handed routine that made him look like he was folding a shirt he was going to give to someone he loved.\n\nEl Rey set up on the cul-de-sac by the park on Tuesdays and then moved along the lakeshore on Thursdays where joggers pretended tacos were a recovery food. The owner had a towel over one shoulder and the posture of a man who had invented his own rhythm and would not submit to anyone else\u2019s. He remembered the denim jacket because it made him angry at the heat on principle, and he remembered the mouth because of the purple, the kind of color that warns you toward and away at the same time. \u201cShe wanted extra napkins like she was planning to be generous with condiments,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd she smelled like my dentist but cheaper. She asked directions to Neptune\u2019s, the little arcade by the laundromat. I told her the laundromat is better than the arcade because at least the laundromat gets you somewhere.\u201d\n\nThe laundromat had windows that sweated from the inside no matter what the season decided. Neptune\u2019s had carpet that tried to be an underwater scene and failed, the low-pile dust-gray ocean printed with fluorescent fish that had gone tired from pretending to swim. The redemption counter\u2019s bell was the same bell on the neon cat, and the girl behind it\u2014AMBER in a name sticker that had done a tour of duty on at least two shirts\u2014pushed her hair behind her ear with fingers that had learned to count tickets faster than anyone expected. She had eucalyptus breath mints in a fishbowl because she was trying to quit gum and respected the sanctity of the carpet. She had a denim jacket on a hook because the air conditioner was schizophrenic and liked to freeze shoulders.\n\n\u201cYou sell those cats?\u201d Boone asked, pointing to the neon herd staring at them with optimism. Amber nodded and flirted her eyes toward the chart that translated tickets into prizes and promises. Zante let the hum of the place file away the noise in her head. Kids shouted at screens and learned early about machines that almost give you what you want. In the back, a door held a strip of light the way a mouth holds a breath. There was a smell from behind it that belonged to a break room that pretended to be a living room and couldn\u2019t afford it: coffee that forgot itself, eucalyptus, a carpet that resigned itself to footprints. The manager was a man whose T-shirt had lost its battle with a logo long ago. He did not want them to look because managers of small empires never want anyone to look. Amber wanted them to look because truth makes teenagers generous sometimes.\n\n\u201cJess worked last night,\u201d Amber said, when they had spoken about nothing for long enough to qualify as polite. \u201cShe thinks a jacket makes an outfit, so she\u2019ll wear it even if it\u2019s a hundred degrees. Purple lipstick because she says if you\u2019re going to be an extra you might as well do it right. She does theater at the college. She makes tall things out of short things and gets mad if anyone notices. She walks in here with a pocket full of quarters like a magician no one hired.\u201d\n\n\u201cJess,\u201d Zante said, letting the name sit on her tongue long enough to match it to the dry-erase flower the paint room had grown. \u201cDoes Jess have more name than that?\u201d Amber half-smiled, because this was a city that likes to give you the first name and make you earn the rest. \u201cJessamine on her direct deposit. Her email\u2019s got a number and a curse word in it. She says names are mouth-choreography anyway.\u201d The manager muttered that they shouldn\u2019t be talking names with police and Zante said she appreciated his concern and Amber rolled her eyes in a way that means here, take this, we live because we give each other small rebellions.\n\nThe locker smelled like eucalyptus the way a glove remembers a hand. Inside, a tube of lipstick called Night Shade 17 had split its black casing and left a smear like a bruise rehearsing. There was a little bottle of mouthwash with leaves on the label advertising eucalyptus as a virtue rather than a sin. The denim jacket had one of those enamel pins on the collar, a whale with lines on its belly like a music staff, and the pin made Zante\u2019s skin say, whale poster, whale in a girl\u2019s room, whales in the ocean of a carpet. She could have built a church on how the world likes to place echoes where we can trip on them.\n\n\u201cShe crash at the Lakeway?\u201d Amber offered, without being asked, because gossip is a public service if you aim it right. \u201cHalf the adjuncts and half the kids do when their air goes out. Cheap rooms and a pool that no one pretends to use. The manager makes you pay in cash if your ID looks like it has regrets.\u201d Boone didn\u2019t like a teenager knowing what he hadn\u2019t asked yet, and he liked it enough to write it down without letting his hand show its relief. The neon cat on the counter winked because its wire had come loose. Or because the city, for once, was helping itself.\n\nLakeway Lodge had a sign that believed in cursive long after everyone else had defected to block letters. A plastic banner under the main sign promised weekly rates and cable as if cable were still a promise. The carpet in the lobby was the color of dust. The desk clerk had the plum-colored nails of a person who funds three older sisters\u2019 beauty habits and one younger brother\u2019s phone bill. She looked at Zante\u2019s collar and decided to treat her as a representative of a trust she had never bought into but liked to try on.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re here to save somebody, I\u2019ll try to speed you,\u201d she said, which was the most honest customer service line Zante had heard in a year. \u201cJess is in 213, sometimes, when 117 is taken. She pays with quarters when her cards pretend to be shy. She is polite in the way that keeps you from kicking her out but not polite enough to make you write home about it. Are we going to do a television version of events, or are we going to knock like neighbors?\u201d\n\n\u201cNeighbors first,\u201d Zante said. They took the outside stairs carefully, because stairs at places like this dislike drama and announce it with their creak. The sun had convinced the railing to burn what touched it, so Zante held her palms up like a supplicant caught in a lesson. A child in the pool counted the tiles like rosary beads and ignored a sign that told him not to play with divinity. Boone posted Lyle at the bottom of the stairs because someone had to be the person who turns a corner into a perimeter.\n\nThey knocked on 213 with the patience a hinge understands. The chain was on because this was a city where habits were a form of superstition. The denim jacket hung over the back of a chair, and the jacket told more truth than the room knew it was keeping. The purple on the edge of the cheap bathroom mirror shouted from under the polite fluorescent. The eucalyptus announced itself like a sermon you hadn\u2019t wanted to attend but found yourself humming afterward. A voice from inside said \u201cJust a second,\u201d and then again with a different vowel because the first second had not agreed.\n\n\u201cJessamine,\u201d Zante said through the gap, not a question and not a command. \u201cI\u2019m Zante. I\u2019m the vicar, and I\u2019m the other thing, and I\u2019m the person who knows the color of your mouth from two different buildings.\u201d There was a pause that had the shape of a swallow. The chain slid back. The door opened to the width of a palm. Jess had the kind of face that makes you think of stories you were told when you were little about people who live in towers against their will and their better judgment. Purple on her mouth but botched on the left where she had been interrupted. Denim, yes, but short sleeves today, stubbornness compromised by temperature.\n\n\u201cI never took your wife\u2019s prints,\u201d Jess said first, which was the kind of defensive that announces itself as strategy more than honesty. \u201cShe photographs mouths like a thief. I steal, but not the way she does.\u201d She stepped back from the door and the room opened in that motel way, a small stage given a single set. The bed had the posture of a thing that had been sat on by a decision. On the side farthest from the window, a child sat cross-legged with more dignity than the bedding deserved. She had a gap where a tooth should be and she was working a knot out of a piece of Velcro as if the world depended on neatness. She looked at Zante with that solemn friendliness children are born with until we train it out of them. She said, \u201cAre you the one with the whale songs?\u201d and relief tried to detonate in Zante\u2019s chest and she held it with both hands.\n\n\u201cHi, Maybelle,\u201d Zante said, making her voice walk slowly as if it were stepping through long grass. \u201cI\u2019m Zante. I brought no whales but I have a friend who is better than whales at getting you a donut later. We are going to take a walk. Does that suit you?\u201d Maybelle nodded because being asked is a kindness children notice even when they are practicing patience as a weapon. She had a keychain looped twice around her finger, the neon cat trying to be brave with her.\n\nJess had the wrong kind of shoulders for a villain. They were the shoulders of a slender animal that would prefer to bolt but had learned to stand very still and hope the world can\u2019t count. \u201cI was returning her,\u201d she said to Boone, who had remained in the hallway but had widened the door the way cops widen doors when they want to fit in the law without scaring the paint. \u201cI was going to leave her at the bench again with the little sodas that look like they come from a party and the napkins because children spill and the keychain because children like bells. She wasn\u2019t scared. She\u2019s a serious person. We talked about how paper has a smell.\u201d She swallowed and her throat moved like it was being taught something it didn\u2019t want to learn. \u201cYou leave your phones everywhere and I can see the shape of your voices without hearing them. I wanted a room where there were only two voices and they belonged to faces I could keep in my eyes.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou took her,\u201d Boone said, gentle as a man can be when the sentence he is obligated to deliver tastes like acid. \u201cYou took her from a fair and from a father and you let the city chew itself to keep your mouth busy. That\u2019s not returning.\u201d\n\nJess had the dignity to accept the word took as the word it was. \u201cI made big because nobody listens to small,\u201d she said, and the purple on her mouth sudden looked like a bruise she had chosen, and then regretted. \u201cIt worked as a trick and failed as a life. I didn\u2019t hurt her. I don\u2019t hurt small things. I just wanted the quiet you get when a child decides you aren\u2019t going to fail them for five minutes.\u201d She looked at Zante, not as a supplicant would look at a priest, but as one performance would look at another across a stage. \u201cYour wife\u2019s mouths make people feel seen, but only if they give her their money. I wanted to make a seeing that didn\u2019t need a credit card.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is a father who would sell the sun to get five minutes back from you,\u201d Zante said, not unkindly and not like a sermon. \u201cYou wanted a vow to stand still. You used another human to make it. You can\u2019t build a quiet room out of someone else\u2019s breath.\u201d\n\nMaybelle slid off the bed and came to stand with a deliberateness that put her in a different category of human than the adults were managing. She took Zante\u2019s hand like a person signs a document\u2014carefully, with intention, without flinch. \u201cMy dad says not to go with anyone who says buddy,\u201d she said. \u201cShe didn\u2019t say buddy. She said helper. Helpers are tricky.\u201d She announced this as if she were a judge delivering precedent. Zante could have fallen in love with that sentence the way you fall in love with a window on a day when the light is doing what it remembers.\n\nBoone radioed, used codes that make emotions sound tidy, and the room held its breath around the words. Lyle\u2019s face arrived in the doorway like an apology because somebody had to be that today. Jess sat down without being told, as if her bones had been waiting for permission to remember that we invented furniture for a reason. She put her hands flat on her knees. The purple on her lips looked shaky close up, as if the hand that drew it had been more faithful to thought than to mirror.\n\nThe walk down the stairs was a procession that refused myth. Maybelle counted again because counting is how we make ourselves a bridge when the river is rude. The man at the pool said, \u201cHey, little buddy,\u201d and then blushed and looked at his feet as if language had tripped him. A woman watering a plant too thirsty for its pot called to them that she had been praying all week without specifying to whom, and Zante nodded because faith makes more sense on stairwells than anywhere else. In the parking lot the air did that thing it does in Florida where it tries to convince you it is a substance more than a condition. The sky was the insistent blank of a hospital wall.\n\nBoone\u2019s patrol car had the good sense to be itself. He opened the back door and then closed it again because Maybelle didn\u2019t like the look of a cage even when it wore seatbelts. He put her in the front with Zante and gave her the radio microphone to hold because trust is a thing we can put in hands and have it work. Jess went in the back, and even then she looked less like a captured thing than like someone who had finally allowed gravity to speak. Amber would find out because a city is a room with a thousand ears, and she would sit on the counter and tell someone all about how the police were nicer than television and worse than a song, and someone would make the story about sirens and someone would make it about a vicar and someone would file it in their chest as a reason to be kinder to people in denim whether the day was hot or not.\n\nAt the station, the rooms performed their roles again. Jess admitted to painting ovals because she liked choreography. She admitted to borrowing flip-flops because they looked lonely in a photograph and she was sentimental in exactly the wrong places. She admitted to meeting Maybelle at the knot in the wood and saying helper and not buddy because she had been a child once too and had learned the scripts. She did not admit to malice. The law does not know what to do with hunger that does its worst damage by pretending it isn\u2019t hungry. A lawyer would arrive, and the lawyer would wear a suit that made Jess look like something that had shrunk in the wash.\n\nZante took Maybelle home because there are tasks you do with your own hands or you don\u2019t ask somebody else to be the city you want to live in. The baker father opened the door and did the automatic things your body does when your life returns: he exhaled something older than words, he reached, he checked for all the old evidence of a child, the weight, the heat, the readiness to forgive. He said thank you to everyone and it sounded like a bakery could sound if gratitude rose like bread. He looked at Zante and found in her face the answer to a question he had not been brave enough to ask himself about God and police and whether either could be forgiven for being useful so slowly.\n\nThey left them against the whale poster, the rib lines like staff lines a song had finally decided to read. Maybelle held up the neon cat and the bell made a noise you would forgive in any house. She showed her father the knot in the Velcro and he listened like a man who had learned what listening buys you.\n\nOn the way back, Boone drove without needing the road to remind him how. He was making and unmaking an expression that had been practicing on him in the rearview mirror for years. \u201cYou going to tell the city your giant is a small person with purple lipstick and a jacket habit?\u201d he asked. He didn\u2019t say Abigail\u2019s name. He didn\u2019t say it because he is a man who loves to not step where the ice sounds thin. Zante looked at the way the sunlight made designs on the dashboard that no one would claim credit for, and she decided to practice her own honesty where it was cheapest.\n\n\u201cWe built the giant,\u201d she said. \u201cMy wife built a piece of her. Jess stood on it because the view is better from up there. If we tell a big story today, it should be that we stopped to count napkins.\u201d Boone grunted and let himself, just for a stretch of road, like the way that sounded. Then he returned to the business of inventorying which words he would have to let reporters steal and which he could keep until they needed to be old news.\n\nAbigail was awake at the table when Zante walked in, as if the house had written a play and assigned them their marks. She had two cups in front of her and both had water in them that had quit sweating once the kitchen decided that humidity was an attitude and not a law. Her face was bare of purple. Her mouth looked like itself, not holy and not guilty, just an instrument that had to be tuned daily. She watched Zante the way divers watch weather, and she stood when Zante did because wives have choreography too.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s alive?\u201d Abigail asked, and Zante nodded because she could give that much without scuffing anything. \u201cAnd the person is not me?\u201d Abigail tried for lightness and tripped, then steadied because the body remembers how to walk even when the mind is inventing ice.\n\n\u201cHer name is Jessamine,\u201d Zante said. \u201cShe uses paint and Velcro and props. She likes to make tall things out of short things. She borrowed the city\u2019s patience and it didn\u2019t belong to her. She wanted quiet and she took it the way people take anything in this century\u2014publicly enough to be myth, privately enough to be a sin that only shows its ankles.\u201d Zante sat, then stood again, because sitting made the words perform and she wanted them to pray. \u201cYou did not take that child.\u201d She watched Abigail\u2019s face absorb the statement with more caution than joy. \u201cYou did make the room where the word giant could sleep.\u201d\n\nAbigail flinched and then rearranged the flinch into something that looked like an intellectual shrug. \u201cIf I had built a smaller room,\u201d she said, \u201csomeone would have broken it to make it larger. That\u2019s what this town does with art.\u201d She smiled a little and the smile failed, and she let it fail in the way only brave people let expressions fail. \u201cDo I get to be forgiven for wanting height?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou get to be forgiven for wanting,\u201d Zante said. \u201cWe will have a longer argument about what you did when your mouth wanted and your hands joined in. I will make you angry by bringing bread to that argument and you will make me angrier by being interesting. Today, I am going to eat something red and sweet that is not a metaphor, and I am going to say that I am tired of hunger making us invent giants.\u201d She reached for a cherry, found one that had resisted the house air, and bit it with the clean emotion of an animal and not a priest.\n\nThe city decided to be many cities about it, as cities do. Some mornings radio hosts said the word cult and meant church and artist and fan and all the other congregations that give people reasons to leave their houses. Some afternoons a woman standing in the produce aisle would look at a purple eggplant and feel disloyal to lipsticks she had loved. At the library, the reference woman polished the spot on the desk where the fan of photographs had once lay and she did it like penance, the kind that makes you feel useful and therefore less guilty for being complicit in a rumor. At the arcade, Amber put the neon cats on a high shelf for a week as if putting an object up where children couldn\u2019t reach would teach adults any lesson. At church, a child wrote a thank-you with more consonants than necessary, and at the bottom of the letter drew a mouth and labeled it MY PROMISER, and Zante put it on the refrigerator as if paper could make cold useful.\n\nThere were still interviews in rooms where light has ambitions. There were still forms to pound with pens that have learned to be patient. There was a court date in a month and then another in a season, because justice believes in time as if time were a reliable actor. Abigail had images to take down from the fellowship hall walls before someone decided to be brave and ask her to. She took them down herself, and she packed them as if wrapping were a prayer. She left one up by accident or design: a small mouth saying a letter b, the shape more promise than sound. Zante left it because when she took it down at home later, alone, it made a noise that felt like the right kind of loss.\n\nOn Thursday, the university sent an email reminding people not to take supplies off campus and also reminding them about a lecture on Ethics in Public Art scheduled before the budget would cut such things. Constance with the red scarf came to church without a scarf and without a desire to be seen, and she lit a candle with a force that said she was ashamed of having wanted the gossip to keep being interesting. Sandra in costumes fixed the air conditioner in a way the Facilities men had never thought to try and didn\u2019t tell anyone until it started working. Jess\u2019s lawyer filed motions that saved no one and did not intend to.\n\nAt the baker\u2019s shop, a sign went up that said CLOSED FOR A DAY. Under it, in handwriting that had decided to be consistent for an hour, another line: THANK YOU. WE WILL BE BACK WITH HONEY BREAD AND PATIENCE. People read it and felt like they had been given a recipe without measurements, and some of them went home and made a mess that tasted good anyway.\n\nBy Sunday, Zante had a sermon and the sermon did not contain the word giant. It did not contain the word envy though she tasted it as she practiced. It had story in it because all the true things do. It had the line about fences and colors because there are jokes you can run like a thread through a cloth when the pattern threatens to forget itself. It had the sentence she had been saving without knowing she had been saving it: \u201cThe devil doesn\u2019t need to be big when our hunger is obedient.\u201d She underlined obedient in her notes and then erased the underline because underlines make text look like it owes a debt.\n\nAbigail sat in the front pew as if she had never been anywhere else and made herself a place in the room with her shoulders down and her mouth unpainted. She had learned how to smile without using it as a coin. When the peace passed like a contagion, she took people\u2019s hands and not their eyes. After, she poured coffee and did not give anyone the gift of absolving her early. People came and told Zante small truths: I said buddy yesterday to a child and heard myself; I threw away my purple and felt vain; my husband wants to know if you can bless a boat; my sister asked if God is a rumor and I said only on days when people need him to be. Zante listened until listening made a shape big enough to step into, and then she stepped into it and found that the room inside fit.\n\nIn the afternoon, when the heat had remembered to be brief, she walked down to the boardwalk. The knot that had caught a flip-flop strap was still smug in the wood. Someone had sanded it finally, late, like people do the right thing when the story includes a bench because benches remind us of saying yes to sitting. She stood very still and counted the steps a child would take from here to the end where the water looked like it had been ironed by an aunt. She thought of Jess going through her tallness like a ritual and getting tired. She thought of Abigail under glass and then not under glass and how love has never learned moderation. She thought of how mouths get all the blame for promises they did not invent.\n\nBehind her, a boy skidded on his shoes, not his socks, because his mother wasn\u2019t there and he was auditioning for autonomy. He looked up. He saw the sky for once and didn\u2019t pretend it was bigger than it was. He said to whoever was following him, \u201cWe are not small. We are just next to very big things.\u201d Zante smiled because sermons sometimes write themselves and you just have to get out of the way. She took the collar from her pocket and slid it into place and felt it click against her throat like a hinge that had remembered which door it belonged to. Then she went home, and when she opened the door, the house made the sound houses make when they are finally full enough to stop performing.Chapter Six\n\nCourthouses smell like old polish and new fear. The walls are the color of laws that looked good on paper, the benches not quite comfortable enough to tempt sleep. The ceiling lights hum in a way that tells you electricity has its own calendar. Zante sat near the back in a patch of air that forgot to move. She had taken the collar off for that morning because the room already had too many uniforms and she didn\u2019t want her white strip to become another badge in a place where everyone was inventorying symbols instead of promises. Abigail took a seat two rows ahead with a kind of practiced poise that made strangers decide she must be either blameless or very good at being not; there is a way a body holds itself that confuses the jury before any sworn word enters the room. Jessamine came in cuffed, her denim jacket folded under her arm like an argument she wasn\u2019t ready to make. She had no purple on her mouth; jailhouse mirrors are honest enough to put makeup in its correct bin: performance.\n\nThe judge was a man who looked like an old piano sounds, all felt and memory. He called the case numbers, and the syllables lined up and marched across the room with the seriousness of soldiers who suspect the war was misfiled. When the clerk asked for names, human names came back and made the air thinner. There was a line in the docket about \u201cinterference with custody,\u201d and it sounded like a term for weather, not a trespass of love and fear and loneliness dressed as civic intent. Boone sat next to a State Attorney who had to keep marking his place with his thumb because he had learned law in a room where hunger interrupted more sentences than the bell did. Maybelle\u2019s father came and stood when they asked if he had anything to say, and he did not make a speech; he said only, \u201cShe likes the way paper smells when it\u2019s warm,\u201d and the judge nodded because we are allowed, sometimes, to let small facts do the work of large speeches.\n\nJess\u2019s lawyer spoke about community ties and cars that can be found and jobs that pay by deposit on Tuesdays. He said returning over taking is a mitigating shape. He said there was no bruising, no harm, no exploitation, and the room did a collective flinch because harm has learned to dress politely in this century. He asked for a bond that would not bankrupt somebody already building a life on coupons and the library\u2019s notion of stability. The State Attorney did that reluctant shake of the head that people do when they would like to be kind but have been given a script that flattens kindness wherever it occurs. The judge set a number that would require three aunts and a co-worker and one neighbor who has always liked getting to be the neighbor in a story, and he set conditions like a parent sets table rules\u2014no giant, no props, no children not attached to you by blood or law, check in with a man whose desk is haunted by the ghost of his predecessor\u2019s coffee.\n\nZante watched Jess watch the floor. She had the look of someone who knows how to be punished but not how to be forgiven. Forgiveness requires more muscles than you expect. Abigail felt the room as a lens; she made herself small without shrinking because she had finally learned that height can be a weapon at the wrong table. When it ended, everyone stood at once because courthouses produce that reflex in bodies; people rise to cover their own discomfort. Boone touched Zante\u2019s elbow in that way he has, a question without a mark, and she gave him a nod that said later, I have to go turn my face back into a thing I can use.\n\nIn the corridor, reporters had gathered to make straw into bricks. They had learned the town\u2019s posture, the way Tallahassee leans when it is making up its mind, and they tried to mimic it the way children mimic accents they think will buy them candy. Microphones glinted like lures. The one from the station with a sunrise in its logo asked, \u201cReverend, will you be stepping down?\u201d and Zante smiled in that specific way that belongs to the guilty and the innocent both; the way that says I intend to answer a different question with the same words. She said, \u201cI will be stepping up to the pulpit on Sunday as usual,\u201d and that was the truth even if it offended the arithmetic of shame. A woman with careful hair said, \u201cDo you feel responsible for the myth?\u201d and Zante said, \u201cWe all feel responsible for the myths we feed,\u201d and watched the sentence make itself into three different headlines depending on the edit.\n\nOutside, heat arranged its chairs. The magnolias refused to perform for cameras. In the parking lot, a man with a sign that wanted to be a petition hovered, unsure whether he was here to cheer or scold. Abigail slipped through bodies the way a slim fish does, just enough motion to not be netted. When they reached the far end of the lot, the part with the tree that seems older than everyone\u2019s rage, she stopped and leaned her back against the bark like it might arrest her and was temperamentally opposed. \u201cIf I apologize,\u201d she said to Zante without looking up, \u201cwill it be heard, or will it just be another photograph of a mouth?\u201d Her hands were in her pockets, and she was terrible at pockets because she always wanted to fill them with the exact thing they were not designed to carry.\n\n\u201cYou can offer one,\u201d Zante said. \u201cYou can\u2019t decide what it becomes on the other end. That is the most annoying part of mouths.\u201d She wanted to touch her, and she wanted to put distance down between them like a placemat under a sweating glass. She did neither, because both are theater, and theater had complicated their house too much lately.\n\nThey closed the studio. Not forever, but into a posture that looked like humility from the street. They took the show down in the afternoon, when passersby were busy assigning their children summer tasks like camps and learning to be disappointed gently. Abigail wrapped prints in brown paper as if brown were a moral. She wrote titles on the back not with names this time, but with numbers, as if she could demote the mouths to inventory and therefore strip them of their power to accuse. In the quiet, the building made a sound it had not let them hear before, a small tick in the back wall where water thought about becoming a stain. \u201cI thought this room was mine,\u201d she said, lighting catching the arc of a nail. \u201cIt turns out I had left the door open and the city walked in wearing my jacket and then left without leaving a note.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou left notes,\u201d Zante said gently, thinking of the card in the church hall, the closed loop where Abigail would have made an opening. She had it in her desk with the lies people tell themselves about donations and the truth about which casserole pans belonged to which grandmothers. She did not say that she suspected that card belonged to Jess or Constance or someone in their chorus. There are some things you keep in your own pocket until the hinge lines up.\n\nThey visited Jess in the county jail because Zante still believed you go to people when their breath is borrowed by institutions and you do not wait for an appointment to make you brave. The jail air had been disinfected into a theology of surface. They sat across glass on phones that multiply pauses and make them obvious. Jess had been given a T-shirt that made everything feel temporary. She smiled when she saw Zante and frowned when she saw the look on her face that said I am undecided between absolution and the kind of love that refuses to be staff.\n\n\u201cYou made up the Killearn thing?\u201d Zante asked after the small jokes were tried on and removed for being too obvious. \u201cThe band shell Polaroids. Were they you?\u201d Jess shook her head with an impatience that suggested she would correct the whole town's footnotes if they\u2019d let her. \u201cNo. That\u2019s how I knew there was an ear for it. Someone else put the first mouths down\u2014three, then five, then the library fan, like someone testing a room\u2019s acoustics. I saw the drift and I joined it, because drift is a current you can surf if you don\u2019t mind swallowing water. I told myself it was art, and then I told myself it was a sermon, and then I told myself it was a mirror, and then I stopped telling myself anything and did the thing I\u2019m booked for.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho started,\u201d Zante said, not because she wanted a name that would let her fold the map, but because names relieve the world of having to carry too much pronoun. Jess shifted, the chain on her ankle conducting impatience the way lightning uses a tree. \u201cI don\u2019t have their face,\u201d she said. \u201cI just have the feeling of hands that don\u2019t like being seen trying to be delicate and failing. You can tell when a big person\u2019s fingers are trying to go small; they smudge corners. The backs of the first ones\u2014old stock, not college lab, a little curl like they weren\u2019t dried under anything weighted. The edges warm. Your wife\u2019s touches are respectful; the first one\u2019s weren\u2019t. She wanted to be myth but she still signed her prints. A different appetite. If I had to guess, the starter wasn\u2019t a photographer. They were a collector making a path back to a shelf they shouldn\u2019t have built.\u201d She said it with that frustrating poet\u2019s authority that turns into fog as soon as you try to pour it into a form.\n\nWhen Zante left, Boone was in the lobby rotating a paper cup between his palms like a prayer wheel he didn\u2019t believe in. \u201cWe\u2019re clearing Abigail off the heavier chatter,\u201d he said, because he had learned to deliver this kind of information directly and without salt. \u201cThe city will keep it on the grill until it\u2019s charred, but the file will sit down. Jess is going to get what the book says, minus anything the book has the decency to subtract when a child doesn\u2019t have new scars. I hate how tidy that sounds. You hear anything we can go small with?\u201d\n\n\u201cSomeone else started,\u201d Zante said. \u201cJess says the first mouths weren\u2019t hers. She may be lying. She may also be the only honest person in a week of honest types trying on lies to see if the fit flatters.\u201d\n\n\u201cSomebody brought a spoon,\u201d Boone said, remembering Jess\u2019s phrase, and the words made him shake his head like a dog who walked into the river expecting depth he didn\u2019t get. \u201cWe\u2019ll go back to Levy. We\u2019ll go back to Killearn. We\u2019ll go talk to security cameras who forgot what they were born for.\u201d\n\nThe bishop called, or rather her assistant called, and the assistant\u2019s voice had the polished courtesy of people who are constantly asked to be the throat for someone else\u2019s mind. \u201cThe bishop would like to see you,\u201d she said, and Zante could hear the capital letters in would like the way you hear a key on a ring that is not yours. The office had carpet that forgave sins both doctrinal and practical; the furniture was old in the way that asks for mercy. The bishop herself wore a linen jacket the color of cream and had the posture of a person who lifts heavy things without announcing it, and who has decided that collar and chain can talk to one another without either losing jurisdiction.\n\n\u201cYou have been asked for,\u201d she said after the tea and the polite weather. \u201cAsked for and asked about. The diocese believes in your work. The diocese is also aware that newspapers are a kind of sacrament for people who need their absolution delivered on pulp. I will not ask you to stop being what you are. I will ask you to remember that your parishioners love you best when you are at table, not on television.\u201d Zante nodded because this was the shape of the truth and because she loved the bishop for calling television the thing her generation calls it, like the set is still furniture and not a pocket. \u201cAnd your wife,\u201d the bishop said, with a care that meant she had practiced in her head first. \u201cHow is she?\u201d\n\n\u201cLarge,\u201d Zante said, and both of them laughed in the careful way women laugh when they have remembered all the ways the world insists on making them smaller. \u201cShe is trying to learn to be one size at a time.\u201d\n\nThat evening, rain made a decision twelve blocks north and then changed its mind before it reached them. The air remained undecided and therefore punishing. Couples came to the vicarage to talk about ceremonies and vows and whether the phrase I promise is heavier than the phrase I do. Zante made tea she never used to drink before Florida taught her that hot things have mercy when the world is humid and uninterested. She listened, and she offered words like hinges: this is how the door might move without squealing, these are the places that will need oil. When they left, she stood in the door a moment longer than necessary and watched the street like a nurse watches a sleeping patient\u2014not because she expects catastrophe, but because expecting quiet feels like hubris.\n\nAbigail found her at the sink with her sleeves rolled, that domestic pantomime that never worked on either of them as disguise because they were both too well-trained in outsized gestures to pretend to be small without being cute about it. \u201cConstance wrote me an op-ed,\u201d she said, holding up her phone like a carapace. \u201cShe called me a mouth-thief and then she praised my craft, and then she said the city had made me its scapegoat and she refused to let me be that. Then she pivoted into calling for more public funding for art and less for police and somehow she made me into both cause and cautionary tale. I should probably knit her a scarf big enough to run for office.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can thank her,\u201d Zante said. \u201cYou can also decide not to put your mouth anywhere she has laid traps.\u201d She dried her hands and noticed, not for the first time, that the towel smelled like the dryer sheet of a neighbor with opinions. You become part of a neighborhood by consenting to share the air.\n\nThey ate in the lateness, bread and sweet peppers and cheese that had forgiven the refrigerator for being inconsistent. Abigail told stories about past openings in other towns, the way audience members treat art like a blood sport, the time a woman threw wine on a canvas because she recognized her ex-husband\u2019s mouth and the artist said thank you without flinching because the stain improved his point. Zante listened and thought of other rooms, rooms with tape on the floors and a smell of felt-tip pens and shouting, rooms where suspects tell the truth in the middle of a sentence by accident and you can hear it because you have trained your ear to tilt. She told Abigail a story about London, finally, because there are histories you give as gifts to prove that a house is a house and not a storage unit.\n\n\u201cThere was a man,\u201d she said, \u201cwho carried a ladder in Shepherd\u2019s Bush and he brought it to crime scenes before the police did and placed it outside buildings and everyone would look up and look for windows and balcony doors and they would forget to look at the ground. He put height everywhere. He haunted us for six months. He didn\u2019t commit the crimes. He committed the rumor. He made us bad at small. We stopped him by giving ladders to everyone. We put three ladders at every scene and then ladders became furniture and people stopped hearing the word up. Then we found the person who was doing the harm, and he was tall, yes, but that was the least interesting thing about him. Jess reminds me of him in the way that wanting attention is a cheaper desire than wanting mercy, but both can be dressed the same.\u201d\n\nAbigail smiled over her glass. \u201cYou\u2019re going to turn into a book of sermons,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople will buy it and then not read it and then tell you they loved the chapter on envy because it made them feel seen without making them do anything.\u201d She reached across the table and took Zante\u2019s hand and, for a long breath\u2019s worth, neither of them moved it away.\n\nTwo mornings later, at Levy Park, a groundskeeper found three more photographs under a band shell seat where gum had mapped amateurs\u2019 patience. Lips again. Not Abigail\u2019s stock\u2014no signature, blank backs, edges cut with the imprecision of someone using a pair of scissors that had duty elsewhere. One mouth with a chipped incisor, not a child\u2019s, a mark of adulthood carried like a story you tell only when drunk. One glossed thick, a shine the color of cheap cherries. One bare, cracked, the kind of mouth that talks too much outdoors. And this time, under the stack, a coin taped to the wood with painter\u2019s tape, a penny face up and rubbing blue where the copper had argued with the air. Boone sent a picture. The penny looked obscenely earnest.\n\nA note with the photographs, in handwriting that was impatient and therefore beautiful: You took my tall away. I can love small, too. The letters leaned forward as if eager to be caught. Boone called before the message finished sending. \u201cWe had eyes on Jess,\u201d he said without greeting. \u201cShe didn\u2019t do it. She was with her mother giving intake forms to a clerk who wishes his job had less ink. Abigail was at home, because I know that even if you don\u2019t think I do. So unless we\u2019ve got a third in the choir who decided to start humming now that the other two have solos, this is something old asking for attention again.\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing is older than wanting to be big,\u201d Zante said. She put on her shoes without looking at them and realized in the car that she was wearing the pair with the sole that thinks gravel is a conversation. At the band shell, the morning had not warmed yet into rudeness. Children were already negotiating rights of way with scooters and chalk. The groundskeeper stood with his hands on his hips like a person who has seen too much rain and not enough roof. The photographs were where Boone had left them, in little numbered tents like campers that had pitched themselves. The penny waited to be made into a metaphor.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re daring you,\u201d Lyle said, sounding frightened and pleased, because he is still young enough to enjoy being in the presence of a good puzzle even when the puzzle punctures a child\u2019s peace in the next county. \u201cThey\u2019re saying they can do flat as well as tall.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve always been able to,\u201d Zante said quietly. \u201cTall was sound. Flat is touch.\u201d She held her breath for a second to see if she could make the world hush. The world declined her offer. She leaned on the back of the bench and felt the wood give a little the way wood does when it remembers that trees move in wind and only furniture pretends to be still.\n\nThe photographs smelled like the bottom drawer of a kitchen, where rubber bands go to make a nest. The gloss was cheap and tacky at the edges in that way that announces a printer from a drugstore. The scissor line took a hair of image off one edge. Whoever had cut them had not minded amputating that much truth. The penny tape was the same blue that had ringed the ovals at the park. The copper was rubbed, yes, but not by fingers\u2014by cloth, rough, full of grit.\n\n\u201cYou remember the coin smell,\u201d Boone said, half a question; he had trained himself to notice which metaphors stuck to Zante\u2019s thinking. \u201cFrom the taco truck. From the cooler. Whoever loves eucalyptus also loves pennies. Or thinks pennies smell like health.\u201d\n\n\u201cOr thinks the rest of us won\u2019t notice if they put two smells in the same box,\u201d she said, and then, because she can\u2019t help herself, \u201cMy father used to put a coin on the table when he wanted me to say something brave. He said if I picked it up, I had to speak. It was a little game. Something about the metal gave my mouth permission. It\u2019s stupid, and it worked.\u201d She touched the edge of the tape with a gloved knuckle and then let it go, because ritual matters even as we find it ridiculous, and because evidence is a sacristy of its own kind.\n\nThey canvassed the edges in the way that word has always sounded like a polite storm. A woman running in a shirt that told the world she was a survivor, with nothing specified, said she\u2019d seen a person sitting on the bench like a pen intent on the end of a sentence. Denim jacket again, because Tallahassee doesn\u2019t let go of its own clich\u00e9s easily. No purple this time. A hat, a flat cap like a costume designer would call a choice. Thin wrists. Long fingers that wanted to argue with tape but had learned compliance. A man unloading cases of bottled water for the community center said he\u2019d noticed the shoes\u2014white, not quite white, gray where the toes meet the idea of walking. Nobody saw the face and everybody saw the shape of the intention.\n\nBack at the church, Zante found an envelope pushed under the office door, the linen kind you save for resumes and condolences. Inside, a photograph\u2014not a mouth this time. A hinge. An old iron hinge bolted to a beam, the metal pitted and proud, the wood furred where fingers check for splinters. On the back, in that same forward-leaning hand: If you name a thing, you give it teeth. Let the door be a door. Under it, a letter A, drawn in a way that was not Abigail\u2019s. Abigail\u2019s A always left the crossbar understated, a whisper. This A had made the crossbar heavy, as if it were building scaffolding. Anonymous is a lazy god. Initials are better stories than letters. Zante sat with the hinge in her lap and stared at the window until the trees began to sway, and then she realized she had been seeing not movement but heat.\n\nShe showed the hinge to Abigail and watched her face perform a refusal. \u201cNot me,\u201d Abigail said, and she said it like a person correcting a child\u2019s manners, gentle and without permission for argument. \u201cIf I were to harass you with metaphors, I would not get the weight of the crossbar wrong.\u201d She held the card closer, and the pupils widened, the hunter\u2019s dark even inside the prey. \u201cJess?\u201d she asked, already deciding no. \u201cConstance?\u201d Maybe. \u201cSomeone who wants in on the poem.\u201d She put the card on the table like it had to rest.\n\nThey did the small responsible things while the city rehearsed larger gestures. They visited the Jarvis bakery; there was honey bread and patience like the sign had promised, and there was a woman at the counter telling Maybelle that she was brave like adults tell children they like their shoes, and Maybelle nodded as if she recognized the currency and was willing to accept it this once. They stopped at Neptune\u2019s to give Amber a thank-you, and Amber made a noise that suggested growing up and kept the neon cats on the high shelf because habit makes you superstitious. They bought a whale pin because pins understand the language of grief and self-protection both. They drove the canopy road where the trees in their tunnel state remind drivers that space is a thing granted, not guaranteed. They did not talk about the letter in the linen envelope because sometimes you let a hinge go unnamed for an afternoon to see if the door behaves itself out of loyalty.\n\nAt Levy again that week, a man playing chess on a board he carried everywhere like a hymn told Boone that he had given a woman directions to a workshop about stilt walking at the warehouse space off Railroad, that she had looked disappointed when he told her the workshop had been canceled because the man who runs it had decided to go to New Orleans. The man saw so much because he spends his days moving sixteen pieces on sixty-four squares and everyone believes he is looking only at kings. He had a coin in his pocket, and when he was nervous he spun it on the bench; copper blurred. Lyle watched the spin with the crush of a new religion. The chess man gave the coin away at the end of the conversation and looked relieved, like he had solved a game nobody else had seen.\n\nZante went to the warehouse and stood in its echo. Stilts leaned against a wall like a congregation that had lost its sermon. The rental man\u2019s ledger had hands drawn in the margins, fingers exaggerated, as if he could not stop thinking about how we hold ourselves up. A sheet of paper thumbtacked and curling said: TALL CLASS CANCELED UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE, and someone had written underneath, in pencil, in a handwriting that refused to be seen, or couldn\u2019t help being seen, depending on your view: short forever. She took the paper because vandalism is a form of donation sometimes.\n\nThat night, Zante woke to the house making a sound she did not like\u2014a small, soft knock that wasn\u2019t at the door, a kind of request from inside the architecture. Abigail slept on, breath even, a faithful machine. Zante walked the perimeter like a captain does\u2014hand on the back of the couch, fingers on the window locks, the cat outside in the neighbor\u2019s yard a bright triangle passing through shadow. In the kitchen, under the bowl that always held too many keys because keys reproduce when unattended, lay another envelope from the linen store, a quality that made the hair on her arms stand beautifully. The same greedy A on the back flap. Inside, a picture of a mouth, yes, but not in any of the styles she knew. It was a mouth open not to speak but to sing, the shape of a vowel that lifts the soft palate and changes the shape of the head. The caption on the back said: vow, and under it: the hollows in us have better handwriting than stone. It was her line, from the Sunday after the fair. It had been written cleanly, respectfully copied, and then the A again, scaffold strong.\n\nShe did not wake Abigail. She sat at the table with the vow in her hand and thought about trespass that isn\u2019t about breaking doors but about stepping into the words a person uses to make a home. She thought about the ladder man in London and how he never touched a body, and how bodies touched themselves differently because of him. She thought about breath again, and how we all love to hear a person inhale when something surprises them because it means the world got in. She put the card back in its envelope and wrote on the front in her own hand, loop open, crossbar light: do not oblige this. She tucked it at the bottom of her stack of sermons because sermons are the only place in her life where she gets to be in charge of the order of things.\n\nMorning gave her no time for rumination. A call from the hospital asked for a priest for a child who had not been harmed but had learned how harm sounds; a family wanted a blessing for a room because the air had been taught to be suspicious. She went, and she stood by a bed where a television in the corner was arguing gently with cartoons, and she put oil on the lintel because oil behaves like language does\u2014moving into places it has no right to be. She could not make any promises that mattered. She could make sentences. She did that until the room felt less like a secret kept badly and more like a stopping place on a road nobody had chosen.\n\nWhen she came out onto the sidewalk, Abigail was there in the heat as if she had been drawn, her dress stuck to her in ways that evidence would, if called upon, find familiar. \u201cHe called me today,\u201d she said without preface, and Zante knew the he, because every city keeps a short list of men with radio shows who believe their job is to tie ropes around the big story and drag it into the studio for public processing. \u201cHe wants me on a panel about forgiveness. He paired me with a man who yells on Facebook and a woman who thinks lipstick is a political party. For balance.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou said no,\u201d Zante said.\n\n\u201cI said I would think,\u201d Abigail said, and Zante felt that old slide in her chest, the one that happens when someone you love puts a foot on ice and looks back at you like maybe you\u2019ll call it water. \u201cI thought maybe I could be useful. I thought maybe, if I made small there\u2014if I made the giant joke into a story about hunger instead\u2014maybe people would forget to be harmful on their way home. Maybe I could plant shame in a way that makes flowers, not knives.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can,\u201d Zante said, and it hurt. \u201cYou can also be used. Tools don\u2019t get a say in who holds them.\u201d She reached and put a hand on Abigail\u2019s elbow and was brave enough to leave it there. \u201cIf you go, go with a rule that you will not break in a chair under bright lights. Write it on your arm. Make it be your bread.\u201d\n\nAbigail smiled, and it looked like how a person looks when she has made a great decision and is perfectly aware it is also a poor one. \u201cI will not perform for absolution. I will not sell tickets to my own penance.\u201d She said it aloud, and the street caught it like a coin and spun it once and then let it drop.\n\nThat evening, she went, of course. The station made free lemonade with too much ice and a young producer with a haircut like a manifesto greeted them as if their RSVP had cured his insomnia. The host loved his microphone in a way that made Zante worry for the people in his life. The panel set was three chairs and a table with a plant that had not been told it was a prop and was therefore trying to photosynthesize honestly. The yelling Facebook man wore a shirt that wanted to be an argument. The lipstick-is-politics woman had opinions that would have been difficult to manage even if they had been ten percent less shiny. Abigail wore nothing on her mouth. She wore a dress with sleeves because she had learned something about the intimacy of bare elbows. She wrote her rule on her arm in sharpie, and the young producer asked if he could take a picture and she said yes, because she is generous to a fault with the small ways people ask permission.\n\nThey asked her to repent on air. She said, \u201cI am sorry for the size of my choices.\u201d The man said, \u201cDo you believe in evil,\u201d and she said, \u201cOnly like I believe in weather. It will pass. It will also come again.\u201d The woman said, \u201cDon\u2019t you see that your lips made all of us\u2014\u201d and Abigail, gentle and dangerous and a person Zante recognized and wanted to applaud and arrest and kiss\u2014said, \u201cMy lips didn\u2019t make you do anything. Your mouth did. We are responsible for the tools we pick up when the rumor asks us to build.\u201d The crowd of listeners on the other side of the glass clapped because people love to clap when they have been told a sentence that sounds like wisdom even if it makes them uncomfortable. The host broke for commercials with the air of someone who believes in his own ability to steer humanities.\n\nWhen it was over and the plant resumed its quiet work without an audience, a woman came up to the glass with a child on her hip and held her hand against the barrier as if blessing a window were a reasonable ask. She had a cap pulled low, a flat cap that belonged to a photograph of a grandfather. She turned her hand over so that the palm faced in, and written there, in blue marker, in a hand that leaned forward into its verbs: If you name a thing, you give it teeth. She smiled in a way that looked less like friendliness and more like the beginning of a negotiation. Then she was gone into the parking lot\u2019s permission and the station\u2019s security guard called after her that she couldn\u2019t smoke within twenty feet of the entrance and she laughed and said she wasn\u2019t smoking and left the smell of eucalyptus anyway.\n\nZante and Abigail stood under the awning long enough for rain to begin and fail again. The asphalt took the drops and turned them into dark currency, circles that pleaded for greater economics. \u201cThe A,\u201d Abigail said, watching the woman\u2019s receding back as if the curve of a human could provide a clue a camera would miss. \u201cShe wants to be the author. She wants us all to write around her. She wants to be essential. She wants the hinge to know her name.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe will give us something we can use,\u201d Zante said. \u201cPeople like her always do. They cannot resist the urge to be helpful to their own myth.\u201d She was tired, and the kind of tired that isn\u2019t solved by sleep, and she found herself humming one of the whale-song tracks that had come in a CD with a children\u2019s magazine years before and had gotten stuck in the church\u2019s collection of weird donations. The sound was not accurate; she was not a whale, she was a human, and yet the low moan settled something in her because it was too silly to be holy and too primal to be a lie.\n\nIn the days that followed, the hinge notes continued. One under the mat at the vicarage door, a photograph of a chapel door\u2019s hardware with a caption: absolve means loosen. One in the choir loft, tucked under a hymnal whose list of favorites had turned into a ranking and then into a faction, this one a picture of a mouth that was not a mouth at all, but the carved squinch of a grotesque at the roofline of a library across the ocean, the shape of gape changed by weather into meaning. One left on Boone\u2019s desk, without envelope, brazen, a drawing this time, pencil, good pencil, the graphite smudged and then polished by a sleeve, of a penny with a hinge for a face.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like being fed,\u201d Boone said, finally, putting both hands on his desk and addressing the wood, because addressing the intangible makes you look dramatic and he had decided drama was hers to provide. \u201cI want to catch the hand on the tray. I want to sit her in a chair and ask her why coins, why eucalyptus, why acting like we didn\u2019t get the child back, why acting like anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe wants me to preach,\u201d Zante said. \u201cShe wants me to build her into a lesson. She wants to be written on. She will not like the font I choose.\u201d She offered the bishop\u2019s courtesy level of smile and then went to sit in the chapel by herself for a half hour because alone is a sacrament when done intentionally. She did not cry because crying is sometimes too uncomplicated for the weather of a week. She did not pray with words because she had used too many lately. She breathed, which is both the smallest and the largest thing she knows how to do.\n\nOn Friday night, Railroad Square filled up because art and beer like to be near one another; their fumes make people believe in the possibility of both. Food trucks lined up like friendly animals. A band played a cover of a song that should never be covered and then apologized and then did it again because mistakes become style if repeated with confidence. Children ran a feral school under the tables and invented rules that had everything to do with touch and nothing to do with law. Someone, that someone, managed to put a photograph under each plastic chair at the listening station where the vicar had once danced badly because Abigail had insisted and where the vicar would never dance again unless someone insulted one of the saints personally, in which case she would invent jubilation as a weapon. The chairs creaked and the photographs crinkled and one of the children, of course, noticed first and held the picture up like proof of life.\n\nThis time: not lips. Knees. Close knees, turned inward slightly, the posture of the shy and the guilty and the child whose mom keeps saying sit like a person. Knobby, bruised, skinned. Knees with bandages. Knees with dirt. Knees with chalk on them, chalk in the pattern of that day\u2019s hopscotch. On the back of one, a word: kneel. On the back of another, a word: knock. On the back of another, a phrase: do not wash the proof. The handwriting had been the same, the forward-leaning eagerness, the crossbar that knew it was labor.\n\nThe air changed. It does, sometimes. It wasn\u2019t fear; fear is sharper. It was attention turning from pleasure to posture, the way a dog turns when it hears its name on a voice that was not speaking to it. Zante handed a photograph to Boone and said, \u201cShe\u2019s moving up the body.\u201d He said, \u201cShe wants to see how many people will take their hats off because the weather changed.\u201d People bend to pick things up and feel religious. They stood together in the soft noise and watched the city swallow new stories, and neither of them said the words pattern or escalation because they had spent a week teaching those words to sit, and they would not reward them with treats.\n\nWhen they went home, a package sat on the front step, the kind that announces itself with branded tape and then pretends to be innocent of its own insistence. Abigail\u2019s name. Inside, no note, just a stilt strap, new, leather that had not yet made its decision about the shape of the thigh it would partner, and a jar of eucalyptus ointment you could buy at any CVS within a dash of good intentions. Under them, wrapped in tissue as if a gift, a book of hymns with the title rubbed off the cover by years of fingers. Between pages twenty-two and twenty-three, another envelope, linen, too much money for a person of sense to spend on paper, and inside, an image of a small door in a wall too thick for a house, the kind that makes cities out of pockets. The caption on the back, in that irritating, compelling hand: small does not mean safe. Then, below: meet me where the rowboats walk. It didn\u2019t say when. It didn\u2019t need to. When someone writes you a note like that, they are anticipating you right now, or they don\u2019t know you at all.\n\nThey went because of course they did. You go not because you want to play the game but because you want to end it on your own page. Boone insisted on being there because he had a gun and a vest and a refusal to let women he respects walk toward trouble without a person who can be blamed if a report demands it. Lyle came because he would have chewed his own hand off before he let them leave him behind when puzzles are being solved. They did it at dawn because dawn is the hour where the city\u2019s tired lets you see the underpainting. The boardwalk remembered the oval prints; the grass remembered being scolded for lying down. The bench stood and offered its good wood like testimony.\n\nShe was there. Denim jacket in heat because her trope had announced itself and she had committed to the bit. Hat low. Mouth bare, which meant she wanted to be believed. She stood with one hand on the back of the bench and the other holding a card she did not relax. They stood a pace away, and Boone rehearsed his hands on his belt, and Lyle looked at the horizon because he didn\u2019t know where else to put his eyes yet. Zante spoke first because that is what you do when you are wearing kindness as armor.\n\n\u201cYou came because you needed to finish a sentence,\u201d she said, and the woman laughed, and it was a good laugh, a pleasurable sound, the kind that would make you forgive an interruption in a movie theater if it came at the right scene. \u201cYou all came,\u201d the woman said. \u201cLike a choir.\u201d Her voice had the rasp that comes from arguing with air conditioning and then smoking anyway. She handed the card to Zante because she had to give something away to prove she had been here. On the front, the mouth, again, but this one was hers\u2014Zante realized it slowly, as if the recognition had been made to walk. Her mouth, the way it looks when she is about to say coveting or when she is about to say go in peace. On the back, the words: we make vows with our mouths first. The trap was lovely. The trap said: you said this, you started this, you own this.\n\n\u201cI am not your hinge,\u201d Zante said, and it was more tender than she meant it. \u201cYou do not get to swing on me.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are every hinge,\u201d the woman said, impatient. \u201cYou speak and people lift their hands. You and she made a city that listens to mouths again. Before, they were all eyes. Staring at their phones. I brought pennies. You brought promises. Between us, we made a faith.\u201d She took off the hat and revealed a face that belonged to no one Zante had been saving as a suspect to crush. Ordinary in the way the extraordinary always is once it steps into a correct light. Cheekbones like any, a nose that belonged to its family, a mouth that had been practicing since childhood and was tired. The purple lipstick would have suited her and she had left it off. She wore nails painted the color of erasers.\n\n\u201cWhat do you want,\u201d Boone said, because he believes in asking that ugly question first so the person can\u2019t pretend not to have rehearsed it. She looked at him briefly like he was a prop she respected. \u201cI wanted to be studied,\u201d she said, and the honesty was not admirable, but it was refreshing like pouring cold water on your own head after mowing a lawn. \u201cWhen I could not be, I wanted to study you. I want to be in your sermons. I want to be in her photographs. I want the giant to belong to me because you made it soft and I know how to make it sharp.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou do not get to hurt anyone,\u201d Zante said, and the woman\u2019s eyes flashed, that quick animal look that proclaims: I know the rule, but I resent the person who recites it. \u201cI didn\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2014that is, whatever you think of as a he, the man who walked a ladder around London in your story\u2014he hurt no one and made all of you worse. That fascinated me. Hurt is so boring. You can measure it. What I am interested in is the way a city picks a word and then carries it like a saint.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou brought a child to a motel,\u201d Boone said, gentle, because gentleness makes people tell on themselves. She shook her head as if scolding the wrong parent. \u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cThat was your tall girl who lives on her feelings. I\u2019m flat. I have always been flat. I like tape. I like paper. I like the way a penny looks when the light makes it worth more than it is. My job at the laundromat is to clean the distillate tray in the dryer that no one knows exists; I get the lint that is the little, little of everyone. I wanted to make something out of it. So I did. Did it hurt? No. Did it disturb you? Yes. Good. You were all standing around pretending not to notice your mouths anymore.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour name,\u201d Zante said, not because she would arrest her with it, but because without it, the woman would keep building herself taller. The woman shrugged because she knew that refusing to say your name gives you a longer runway. \u201cA is fine,\u201d she said, and smiled. \u201cIt belongs to all of us.\u201d\n\nThere are moments when you can feel the city decide. The birds don\u2019t stop; the wind doesn\u2019t lean; but a hundred people somewhere mention a topic at the same time and the word crosses a street without getting hit. Zante felt it then. It would have been easy to lunge, to turn this into a scene with bodies and cuffs and commands. It would have been easy to let the woman write the last card. It would have been easy to be big and hope small forgave them later. She did something ruder and more precise.\n\n\u201cYou like coins,\u201d she said. \u201cSo here\u2019s a trade. You give me something true, not metaphor, not handed to a photograph to make it into an altar. You give me one place we need to look for a child who isn\u2019t home yet. You know a name. You know a knot. And I will let you keep your A until noon tomorrow.\u201d She held the woman with her eyes in that priest way that only works when the other person has already half-decided to confess and needs a place to put the proper noun.\n\nThe woman swallowed. It changed the shape of her face just enough to make her temporarily ugly, which is to say human. Her mouth opened, and for once it was not mythology or mischief that came out. \u201cLake Ella,\u201d she said. \u201cThe canoe rental shed. There\u2019s a space under the steps. There\u2019s a boy who sleeps there sometimes because his mother\u2019s boyfriend\u2019s car has a seat with a spring that makes his back cry. He didn\u2019t come last night. He said he was going to. He smells like cigarettes and detergent. His name is Trey. He plays the game with the pennies at the edge of the boardwalk sometimes. He is the right size for your city to ignore and the right size for me to pity. Go check, and if he isn\u2019t there, look behind the shed where the workmen leave the bags of mulch and think no one knows where they\u2014\u201d\n\nBoone was already on his radio, his voice turning into dispatch shapes. Lyle ran like he had been given a word and told to carry it to the person who says yes. The woman smiled, small and unfaithful. \u201cWe are not so different,\u201d she said to Zante. \u201cWe both love the satisfaction of a good clue.\u201d Zante allowed herself the cruelty of not answering. She had been practicing.\n\nThey found the boy. He had a sock for a pillow and a backpack for a wall and a picture of a dog in the pocket of his shorts and a mouth that had decided to be quiet because quiet kept bruises off his arms. He was not gone; he was missing only in the way the world loses track of people without receipts. They did the small things\u2014water first, not questions. Sit on the step, not the grass because ants make everything worse. Ask in tone, not in filing language. Trey had that bravado used by children who have memorized the names of football teams but not the names of the muscles that ache when they carry groceries for a woman who loves the wrong man. He came with them because Boone had learned to make the front seat of a patrol car more farm dog than squad, and because Lyle had a voice that says you will not be harmed by my applause if you do not deserve it. Zante rode along for nothing more than to do the ancient priest job of bearing witness to an ordinary salvation.\n\nWhen they returned, the woman in the denim was gone. The bench remembered her the way wood remembers every hand. On the seat, a penny, face up, the copper warmed by the sun that had finally decided to do its job. Under the penny, a small neat card with a mouth drawn rather than photographed, a line of graphite for lips, a soft smudge for breath, and the letter A heavy and sure as scaffolding. On the back: noon tomorrow. The time was a dare, and an invitation, and a promise, and a threat, and Zante laughed without sound because of course the city had produced a villain precise enough to schedule her own climax.\n\nThey went home and ate fruit like it was a sacrament, not a symbol. Abigail took photographs of nothing\u2014in the kitchen, the curve of the sink where water decides to go to ground, the shadow that a bowl makes when the light is stupid, the specific way Zante\u2019s left hand holds a fork when she has chosen mercy over anger. They made a list of things they would not do. They would not be baited into spectacle. They would not write her into their vows. They would not let the city\u2019s appetite draft them as caterers. They pinned the list on the refrigerator with a magnet in the shape of a whale because you have to laugh. Then Zante washed her face and practiced saying the word no in three registers\u2014the pastoral, the investigative, the spousal\u2014and found that the spousal one hurt her throat least.\n\nAt noon tomorrow, the city would perform for itself. It always does. Zante decided to let it. Meanwhile, there was a boy with a backpack to be delivered to a person who would not turn his back into a map of another man\u2019s temper. Meanwhile, there was a sermon to write that did not contain the word giant and would still be heard as if it did. Meanwhile, there was a hinge in her pocket, linen envelope and all, and it bothered her like a pebble in a shoe because she had not yet decided whether to throw it at a pigeon or keep it under glass. She went to her desk and opened her notebook and wrote in pencil because pencils forgive, and she wrote the unheadline she wanted: We were hungry and we brought bread and not knives, and some idiot turned it into a performance anyway, and we loved them enough to make the stage small. It was not good prose. It was a good promise. She underlined nothing and closed the book on the line and went to find Abigail, who was in the other room, practicing being exactly her own size on purpose.Chapter Nine\n\nNoon came into the house like a person who had misread the invitation and dressed grander than the host intended. The heat put its hands flat on the windows, the kind of humid insistence that makes even air-conditioned faith feel like it is sweating into its shoes. Zante woke early and let herself be ordinary for an hour, coffee from a chipped mug, the collar set on the counter instead of around her throat, the pencil making short work of a list that was not about strategy so much as manners. She called three people who could be trusted to resist spectacle even when spectacle winked at them, and she asked them to bring bread as if they were going to after-school care and not to a place where a rumor had decided to stage itself. She texted Boone and asked for a quiet perimeter, not the bright kind that looks like a lesson plan. He answered with a thumbs-up she pretended not to find adorable, because some men are allowed the occasional emoji if they have carried other people\u2019s emergencies with their faces too long. She left a note on the refrigerator under the whale magnet reminding herself to say no out loud if her body forgot what her mind had decided, and she laughed once at the absurdity and the necessity of leaving instructions in your own house.\n\nPeople had chosen to gather whether they had been invited or not; that is the nature of a town that believes in its stories like exercise. The boardwalk smelled of lake and sunscreen and gossip that had been left in sunlight too long. A freckled teenager wore a T-shirt that said LOCAL MYTH ENTHUSIAST and had crossed out MYTH with a thick marker so that anyone reading had to do a little work to decide how funny they found it. Two women in straw hats tried to look like they were here to walk and found themselves checking for cameras without meaning to. An old man with a dog built like a question mark kept his gaze on the water as if to create the illusion of privacy for everyone else. Zante stood by the bench because the bench is where the city had decided to pin its hope and its complaint. She had a bag of coins she had emptied from a jar at the church where people leave offerings that are too small to be formal and too specific to be random; she would not let one woman\u2019s tape make pennies into omens without a fight. She welcomed anyone who approached with the kind of nod you give a neighbor you have not yet decided if you like, and she gave a child two coins and said the lemonade stand that wasn\u2019t there today would be back tomorrow, and in the meantime he could make a wish quietly and then find something else to spend the wish on. He shrugged as if this made sense to him and made the coin spin until it looked like an argument and then he let it fall flat in the shade where even copper tires quickly.\n\nBoone drifted at the edge of things like a rock you forget is in the river until you stub your shin and curse and then apologize for cursing. He had put two officers in plain clothes into chairs with styrofoam cups and a posture that suggested divorce more than stakeout; he was learning how to hide from a city that had been eating uniforms for breakfast. Lyle carried a cooler like any civilian trying to be helpful and kept finding reasons to be at the periphery of clusters of conversation, where the best overheard sentences live. Abigail came late on purpose because she had an instinct for timing and for making timing look like accident; she wore a dress with sleeves and no lipstick and a pair of sandals that made her walk sound like a person, not an entrance. She stood on the other side of the bench and did not catch Zante\u2019s eye until bystanders had satisfied themselves that someone would recognize if the vicar\u2019s wife and the vicar intending to be a person were both here. When they finally met, they did not stage a greeting. They let their mouths do the work of small and their shoulders stay down.\n\nThe woman in the denim arrived as if she had been waiting inside the day all morning and had only now decided to present her silhouette. She had chosen a hat that cast her face into a sensible kind of anonymity, a flat cap that a grandfather might have rehearsed being extravagantly ordinary in. Her jacket looked less like defiance and more like habit, and her hands were busy from the moment she stepped onto the boards, the fingers arranging something that resisted arrangement. She brought a stack of photographs tucked under her arm in a manner that made them look like mail she had been entrusted with and not like bait. She moved to the bench in a line that wasn\u2019t straight and therefore human. She did not look at Zante at first; it impressed Zante that the woman knew she was not the only pair of eyes worth courting.\n\nZante had decided beforehand that she would not let questions be called down into a microphone whose job had only ever been amplification; she would let verbs lead. She turned to the nearest clutch of people and said, \u201cWe are going to feed each other,\u201d and she said it in the kind of soft that compels rather than invites. A woman took bread, the good kind from the Jarvis bakery, the crust that had made Maybelle consider growing up in a single afternoon, and then that woman tore it and gave it to a boy whose mother had not remembered cash because the rumor had taught her to leave the house nervous and unpocketed. The boy said thank you without being told, and the rumor had to accommodate good manners, which does not suit it. Zante gave coins to a father and watched him hand them to his child and watched that child keep one and give one back, and in that simple math there was dignity that legends cannot digest without gagging.\n\nThe woman in denim produced her photographs and it was always going to be new content. Shoulders this time, the slope of them, the way some take weight like a stone shelf and some take nothing like a promise and some have learned to curve inward in a shape you could call humble and you could call shy and you could call self-protection and you might be right all three times. Scars across one where sun had decided to write and then regretted its handwriting. A white strap line on another that was the opposite of bruise and somehow meaner. A shoulder with glitter stuck to it because small girls like to make their molecules visible. On the back of one, in that forward-handed writing that wanted to be caught in the act: should. On another: shelter. On another: shoulder someone else\u2019s and you forget your own. She did not hold the photographs high. She let people find them. She let discovery give a child the feeling that they had been allowed to interrupt grown-ups with proof.\n\nAbigail watched with her mouth in that line the world had learned to read as either complicity or critique, depending on what it needed. She wrinkled her nose once because somebody\u2019s cologne had overestimated its importance and because the mention of eucalyptus in her head had trained her to sniff, unfairly, for that particular leaf. She saw the woman hand a card to a boy who had the good kind of skepticism in his shoulders, and she saw the boy use his skepticism and take the card anyway and bring it to his mother, who read it and then tucked it into her bag as if evidence should be kept next to wet wipes. Abigail leaned closer to Zante and said, without moving her lips enough to become a quotation, that the woman had a new perfume today that was less dentist and more bee balm, and Zante said that of course she had adjusted; any good actor adjusts with the room.\n\nWhat Zante did next was not dramatic and therefore had the kind of power that keeps chairs from scooting. In a voice that was not for the microphones because the microphones were busy being turned off by a pair of volunteers who had a way with cables, she said, \u201cWe are not going to say her letter at noon today. We are going to say names of things we will not let hunger resize. We are going to make sentences that are small enough to carry home in our pockets and that will not break when they hit the kitchen table.\u201d People looked at her because the collar has that effect and because authority can be made and also has to be believed in a given square of sky. She went first because that is the burden and the privilege of the person who starts the list. \u201cI will keep the shape of water cups holy,\u201d she said, and it would have been ridiculous if not for the cooler and the heat and the knowledge that the first thing people weaponize when panic becomes policy is thirst. A woman said, \u201cI will shoulder my sister\u2019s lease for two months,\u201d and the kid with the T-shirt said, \u201cI will close the tabs on my phone that keep me angry when I could be useful,\u201d and a man with tattoos that looked like they told the truth even when he did not said, \u201cI will stop calling my bad memory selective and call it bad and apologize like it\u2019s unpaid rent.\u201d They went on like that for too long to be interesting and long enough to be honest, and by the end of it the rumor had been made to sit with its hands folded, at least for that hour.\n\nThe woman in denim stood and watched and let her mouth become thin the way a person who had planned a party and found another party had brought better snacks lets a disappointment be visible. She put a photograph down on the bench without flourish and the photograph was a mouth again but not a stranger\u2019s, not even Zante\u2019s again; this was Abigail\u2019s, in a frame so tight the viewer could see the unretouched pores at the border where color and flesh dispute territory. On the back, the sentence Zante had used three days earlier and had put back into her notebook like a bird she was not yet ready to release. It was an act of flattery and theft and argument in one, and the woman stood very far away and did not enjoy how she had been written into smallness. Zante picked up the card and put it in her bag because sometimes you refuse to be curated.\n\nBoone let the moment be what it was meant to be and then he did three things so boring they were radical. He walked a slow loop that required people to shift aside and consider that their elbows exist in a world with other elbows. He asked a man wearing a camera neck strap whether the camera had a memory card in it or just a sense of its own importance, and when the man said both, Boone smiled and told him to keep photographing children\u2019s shoes and leave their faces alone. He asked the woman in denim if she would like a drink and then let her say no three times because the third no is where people often put the truth. She declined without offense and he could smell eucalyptus despite her best efforts, less sharp today because hubris had been rinsed off by the crowd\u2019s refusal to behave like an audience.\n\nThe card on the bench was not the only offering. Under the boards, in the long shadow that late morning insists on, a paper bag tucked itself into a corner like it had learned the posture of guilt. Lyle\u2019 s foot found it because he has a foot that belongs to clues, always landing a half inch to the left of showy. They did not pull at it with gloved fingers like a television would have had them do. They asked a child to bring his father because children will tell a person everything about a bag if they believe the bag contains nothing they are guilty of. The father bent and retrieved it and when he opened it there were pennies inside, taped together in pairs with the same blue painter\u2019s tape, as if someone had decided that the way to get two mouths to meet was to force copper to kiss. There was also a tube of lipstick, purple ugly as a bruise reheated, with the label filed off like a thief learns to do on his first day of commerce. There was a stub of a pencil of the expensive sort that artists buy to believe in their own lines. No note. The woman had upped the tone and then left it to get sour.\n\nIt should have been a crescendo, and it was not, which infuriated the part of the day that had gotten dressed for drama. People left in clumps to go do errands because groceries do not buy themselves and children do not love you more for staying at a scene of adult staging. A handful of teenagers tried to take the painter\u2019s tape and tape their wrists together in the way of kids who are always looking for a permission that feels like rebellion, and a volunteer in a shirt that said USHER and meant it in all the forms of the verb smiled and said no kindly because a kind no, when delivered correctly, can act like the opposite of a dare. The woman in denim stood very still and then very slowly, like a person asking a body she knew too well to perform a trick it had not warmed up for, she rolled one shoulder back and then the other and wiped her face with the inside of her wrist where no one wears perfume. She put two fingers to the brim of her cap in a gesture that was not ownership and not farewell and not, thank God, saluting, and then she walked away without looking back to see who had counted her steps.\n\nZante sat on the bench when the crowded hour had forgotten itself and the lake went back to whispering and the boards went back to the work of holding the weight of people who do not write myth. Abigail joined her and did not speak in the way of two women who know that their contribution for that minute is not to further sculpt language. Boone came and let himself look like a man at lunch. Lyle went to throw something away not because he needed to but because sometimes a body needs to carry trash to a can to decide it did a job. Zante took the photograph with her own mouth on it out of her bag and looked at it for longer than was civilized. She put her thumb over the image and felt the slick surface resist. She did not like being collected, even when the curator swore she was building a museum to mercy. Abigail watched her do it and did not offer to take the card away, although the offer laid itself on her tongue and rolled back like a tide that knew to leave the shore alone when the shore was doing its own thinking.\n\nIn the aftermath hours, the city remembered that it had to be a city and not a single rumor. The bishop called to ask whether they had need of casseroles for nobody in particular, and Zante thanked her the way you thank a person offering a blanket when you are only chilly and not in danger. Amber at the arcade texted a picture of a new sign on the redemption counter that read BELLS TEMPORARILY UNAVAILABLE and made a face in emoji because some humor can only be expressed as punctuation. Maybelle\u2019s father sent a bag of rolls with Lyle to the station because bread has never stopped being a form of currency in households where people take the time to knead. Jess called from a phone somewhere in the system and left a voice message that said only, \u201cShe hates not being allowed to write the end,\u201d and then a click that was not a hang-up so much as a permission for silence to start again.\n\nThe letter that came that night did not travel by envelope; it arrived under the ashtray that had no cigarettes in it because the house refused to become a place for that particular smoke. Someone had put the ashtray there during a party years ago because it felt grown-up and then had never used it. Under it was a folded piece of thick paper that had been cut hastily from a larger sheet, the edge rough as if the blade had needed help and the hand had provided encouragement. Inside, a photograph of a hinge again, not a door this time but a toy chest\u2019s, the brass dulled perfectly by small fingers that had learned how to open and close and be proud. On the back, in that same forward press of letters: you made quiet into a crowd. The compliment was sincere and useless. Underneath, with the crossbar on the A drawn as if she were building scaffolding with impatience: noon did not keep my promise. There was no time set for the next act, which made it worse in the way empty spaces on calendars can be worse than solid blocks.\n\nAbigail sat at the table and pushed her glass into a ring of water and then pushed it again to make the ring larger; she had always liked to watch circles argue with stipulations. \u201cShe\u2019s going to go stranger,\u201d she said, because escalation is not always size; sometimes it is novelty. Zante said that the city had not yet recovered from the sound of its own smallness and that might give them more time than they deserved. Abigail said that time in this town is a rumor with a calendar, and then they both let the conversation sit until it forgot to be important. Later, when they were in bed with the fan doing that kind of noise that pretends to do more work than it does, Abigail said, not like a possible confession but like a weather report, that she had thought about calling the radio man back to tell him she had more to say about forgiveness, and that she had not done it because forgiveness is too glamorous a noun for her to be trusted with on Thursdays.\n\nBoone\u2019s text in the morning was the kind that announces small and wins big. He\u2019d sent a photo of a boy sitting on a station bench coloring in a picture of a whale with a blue crayon that had been snapped in two and was therefore twice as useful. Trey had a new shirt because somebody somewhere had decided to keep a closet for such kids stocked not by principle but by habit. The boy had opinions about pancakes that Lyle wrote down because nobody ever gets asked the right questions in rooms like that and Lyle had decided that he would change the intake form to include a space for favorite breakfast foods. Boone wrote, in a sentence longer than his usual patience: Laundromat called. The woman who cleans the distillate tray hasn\u2019t come in. Name on the timecard is Alva. It\u2019s close to an A somebody would choose if she wanted to be biblical while pretending to be anonymous. We\u2019re going to go small at the lint trap.\n\nThe laundromat did not mind being a place for theology; it was used to revelations done in hot air and in the quiet between cycles. Alva existed in the log in the particular way that people exist when they are paid in cash and in the relief other people feel when a dirty thing becomes briefly clean. She had a schedule that overlaid like tracing paper with Jess\u2019s old shifts at Neptune\u2019s and with the nights the taco truck had parked itself like a mirage at the lake. The manager, who had the soft look of a person whose day consists predominantly of apologizing to machines and to some lovely extent to people who are machines about their own rituals, said that Alva talked in complete sentences to the washers and not to anyone else. He showed them a crate where she kept her things and it was exactly what you would expect from a person whose handwriting leaned forward: a notebook with pages torn out carefully and pages torn out violently, a stack of photographs of hinges and mouths and child shoulders printed on paper that could not weather a season, a handful of pennies that had been polished with a rag until the date could be read like a hope, a tube of ointment still scented and not cheap. There was a cap that smelled of scalp and lake. There were no receipts, because some people live on receipts and some people avoid them like metronomes because they do not want to hear what they already know.\n\n\u201cAlva,\u201d Abigail said, tasting the name like a vowel she had held longer than is polite. \u201cThat\u2019s a grandmother\u2019s name that got lost on the way to a child.\u201d Zante said that names like that teach you to bend into their shape and that sometimes the bending gets mistaken for humility. Boone did the practical things, entered the name into the modest chorus of databases that the department pretended was an orchestra, ran the time compared to Trey\u2019s disappearances and the park\u2019s play of rumor, made himself a small map on a piece of paper because sometimes paper allows you to lie to yourself less successfully than screens do. He circled the laundromat and Neptune\u2019s and the bench with a pen that had leaked in his pocket and had blessed his thigh with a blue he would carry all week.\n\nWhat they could not do was arrest a hinge, not when it had not been attached to violence. What they could do was refuse to hold it up in the square and let people worship. Zante told the bishop she was going to preach a series of verbs instead of nouns until the town bored itself of language and fell back in love with doing. The bishop said that verbs were always a safer bet and then reminded her to drink water because bishops are allowed, in their broad vocation, to mother the clergy whether they ask for it or not. Abigail planned a show of objects that could not be sold, a room of small things\u2014cracked cups and tape dispensers and cards with grocery lists\u2014photographed so close that even the people who prefer being sentimental about eyes would have to engage with the mouth-equivalents of daily life. She said that if she could trick the city into being bored by scale, she would call it a success. She said it in the tone of a woman who has not yet decided whether she believes in mercy for herself but is willing to impersonate someone who does, in case it teaches her something.\n\nThe call came from the library not from the reference desk but from the children\u2019s room, where a volunteer with a voice like felt announced that someone had left coins under four chairs and a ring of blue around the mouth of the turtle statue the city had bought years ago as a reminder that some kinds of slowness are heroic. They went in a cluster because you do not send one person to a place where a turtle has been made into a message. The coins were taped to the underside of chairs like a schoolboy\u2019s stash; the tape was blue but not the same brand as before, and Zante put that into the file in her head labeled improvisation because when a rumor runs low on supplies it becomes interesting. The turtle wore the ring of painter\u2019s tape like a child would wear a ribbon meant for an adult, not quite right and therefore adorable and therefore dangerous. A note, always the note, tucked in the mouth of a stuffed dragon that had lost one button eye, read: the hinge on a book is a spine. You read and I open. The A was barbed now; the crossbar looked like an act of self-congratulation.\n\nThe librarian with the bun who had opted out of drama from the beginning set down her scanner and said, in the tone of a woman who has been patient, that the city was doing the thing it always does when it is bored and afraid at the same time, which is to attend to esoteric stationery and leave the person in need standing ten feet away asking for a bathroom. Zante loved her for it, not least because it allowed her to feel vindicated in her campaign against nouns. She gathered the coins, threw the tape in the bin, patted the turtle\u2019s head with the kind of respect you give a public object that has held thousands of children without complaint, and told the volunteer to read something about whales to the group that had wandered over because the vowel is an honest noise and the letter W has always been a hinge in disguise.\n\nThat night, under their own roof, Abigail pulled out a photograph she had not shown anyone, not because it incriminated and not because it absolved, but because it embarrassed her. It was a picture she had taken months ago, sloppy and precisely what she loves\u2014an image of Zante\u2019s hand on a page, pencil against paper, a thumbnail with a chip in it, the faint shadow of the ring that had been removed five minutes earlier to have lotion applied. The mouth was not in frame, which made it, for once, about a promise that had been handed to a tool and not to a face. Abigail said that looking at it made her feel braver about her own scale, and Zante said that if bravery could be outsourced to images she would take a subscription and stop speaking for a week. They laughed in the manner of the exhausted, which is to say with more air than sound. The letter under the ashtray glowered politely, and they left it there because some things you do not file and you do not burn; you let them decide what they are by failing to do their worst in your presence.\n\nMorning brought a rain that did not apologize. It hit the city like a plan that had been drawn up by someone who knew everyone\u2019s best excuses and had invited them anyway. The boardwalk went dark and clean and uninterested in carrying anyone\u2019s theater. The turtle under its ring of tape felt less like a prop; you can bathe anything in rain and it becomes briefly its own. The laundromat rattled happily. Neptune\u2019s carpet smelled like it forgave children for being damp. The station phones rang with the usual wrong numbers and two right ones and Boone assigned the right calls to men who pretend to mind being asked to do kindness that cannot be logged on a sheet as crime prevention.\n\nAt midday, while the rain did that thing of being noisy and therefore comforting, a package arrived at the church addressed to no one and everyone. It was light in a way that packages rarely are when they have something to prove inside them. Inside, hinges again, a mobile of them, cheap brass and good iron and one that had been rescued from a door that had forgiven many teenagers their curfew. They had been tied together with blue tape, not as an insult but as a sea, and when Zante lifted the thing from its bed of reused tissue, it turned and clicked and produced a music that wanted to be taken seriously. A card fell out, of course it did. The handwriting was the same, the crossbar on the A incredibly proud of itself. On the back: if you refuse to be big I will attach you to everything. It was not a threat and it was not a promise; it was a confession. Zante hung the mobile in the fellowship hall where it would ring every time somebody\u2019s back door opened to let in a casserole. She did it on purpose, and when people commented on how it made them feel clever and also like they were being watched by grammar, she said nothing that would turn it into a sermon because sometimes mothers teach babies to soothe themselves.\n\nIn the evening, because even weeks like this must submit to the tyranny of supper, they ate on the porch, and a neighbor\u2019s cat performed murder in the yard with the shamelessness of a creature that has never been taught to be guilty about its own appetite. Abigail told Zante about a call she had gotten from a student who wanted to argue that art is not responsible for the uses to which idiots put it, and Zante said that while this was technically true it was morally lazy; then she softened and said that love is like that most hours of the day as well. Abigail said she had been tempted to develop a series of non-images\u2014white squares with the word MOUTH handwritten at the bottom, the kind of audacity that would make the city snap photos of nothing and congratulate itself on insight\u2014and Zante said she should do it just to get it out of her system, and then admitted that even she would be tempted to buy one because austerity has always looked aristocratic until you have to live with it.\n\nAfter the plates were put in the sink and the neighbor\u2019s cat had gone somewhere to be terrible in private, Zante sat with the notebook that contained her verbs and she drew a small box on the page and wrote in it: knock. She wrote next to it: kneel. She wrote under it: vow. She drew a tiny hinge under vow because the only way she has ever understood belief is as a series of moving parts that pretend to be whole. She wrote under the hinge: open, and then she closed the notebook because you have to close a notebook on a word like that or it will become presumptuous and invite itself to everything. In the quiet that followed, a drop of rain fell from the gutter long after it had any right to still be there, and in the sound there was a possibility that a rumor would move on and find another town hungry enough to swallow it without chewing. She did not trust possibilities. She accepted them the way you accept a loaf with an uneven crust: with gratitude for its existence and with a knife ready to correct its manners.\n\nClose to midnight, the phone rang, and Boone\u2019s voice arrived at its volume that signals an admission that matters. He said that a custodian at the museum had found a stack of photographs shoved into the mouth of a plaster statue of a woman with an urn because this city will insist on staging its metaphors generously. He said the photographs were throats this time, throats swallowing, throats singing, throats yelling across ballfields, throats with necklaces cheap and inherited and stolen and loved. He said the backs read: call, and under it: answer, and under it, on one: confess. He said there was also a photograph of a hinge mounted to a pedestal with the card that described it like art, and that the card used the word ecclesiastical because Alva had decided to give herself a word she could hide in. He asked if she wanted to come, and she wanted to say no and she wanted to say yes, and because free will is not an on/off switch she told him she would come if he promised to make the museum lights speak softly and not like a courtroom. He said he would try; he is a man who makes promises like that seriously, and that is why she trusts him in the dark.\n\nThey went because of course they did. The museum liked being open for the wrong reasons because it was tired of being open only for the right ones. The custodian, whose name had a vowel the city mispronounced and who did not mind because he had decided to put his pride in other words, showed them the statue and then left them alone because he understood that the room did not need another mouth for ten minutes. The photographs were beautiful in a way that made you want to bite something. Throats lifting, throats relaxed, throats with the soft dip where a pulse makes a map and a promise and a threat all in one. On the back of one, in Alva\u2019s hand: I will not use your town up. The letter A\u2019s crossbar bravely announced its own restraint. On another: I will leave you alone if you admit you needed me, and Zante felt actual anger in her lower back, the kind of anger that you do not allow into your shoulders because it would make them speak violently. She said to Boone, steady, that they would not admit that, not into a microphone and not into hands and not into any room that allowed tape to feel important.\n\nThe museum\u2019s back hallway led to a door that led to a little courtyard with a fountain that had decided decades ago what its sound would be and had never had cause to change its mind. In a corner, a blue cap lay on its side as if someone had apologized to it for the weather. A penny sat on the lip of the fountain and had gone dull because water refuses to let anyone keep their shine very long. Zante put the penny in her pocket without asking permission and told herself it was because metaphors do not get to be left where birds can choke. She looked up because the stars were relevant; they are always relevant when humans are performing, because they refuse to attend and that is a bracing form of criticism.\n\nShe did not sleep much that night and she did not perform not sleeping as a chapel. In the morning, she wore the collar and the dress with the pocket and she wrote in her notebook without making it into a stage. She wrote: open. She wrote under it: I will not build her into a sermon. She wrote under that: I will not forget that coins are money and promises are not currency even if they buy time. She left the house and went to check on the bread for the Saturday feed because people have to eat even when art is staging a revolution, and on the way she passed a boy on a bike and the boy sang the same nonsense song he had sung last week and it made her glad in a way that had nothing to do with language.\n\nAt the church, a package waited that looked like every other package and was not. Inside, a hinge\u2014of course\u2014and a photograph of a mouth that was hers\u2014again\u2014and a second photograph of a mouth that was not hers and that she recognized anyway, not from a mirror but from a life. It was Alva\u2019s mouth, bare and chapped and ordinary and therefore exceptional. On the back, in a steadier hand that had decided not to lean forward today, a sentence without metaphor, and therefore, finally, a gift: I am tired. It is hard to not be named. I work at night on the days your town makes the most laundry. I think you would have liked me if we had met at a dryer and not at a bench. I will leave the rest where it can go to ground. Say a small thing for me that is not about God. It was the first time the letter had been lowercased. Zante read it twice and then again, and then she said the smallest thing she could find, the kind of thing that could not be made into a column or a defense. She said, \u201cThank you for not hurting anyone,\u201d and then she said, \u201cI will not write you any taller,\u201d and then she folded the photograph and put it where she keeps good napkins, because that is where grace belongs in a house that hosts more meals than arguments.\n\nLate in the afternoon, Boone called to say a woman named Alva had come to the station and had asked for him specifically and had sat in the chair like she was the first person to ever do it correctly. He said she had said her name and had said she was done and had placed a stack of photographs on the desk and had looked at him the way a person looks at a doctor with a diagnosis they do not want and will nevertheless memorize. He said she had requested no audience and no panel and no performance, and that he had given her exactly that, and that when she stood up and left she had taken the pennies out of her pocket and put them in the dish by the door we keep for people who believe in exact change. He said there was no arrest to be made, and there was no speech to write, and that he was going to go home and stand under his shower and try to decide whether his body worshipped water or worshipped the idea of washing away a week.\n\nThat night, the house was cooler. The city had collapsed into its summer fatigue the way a person collapses into a couch they inherited and didn\u2019t like at first and then found their own curve in. Zante and Abigail sat on the porch and did the thing couples do who have survived a week of being asked to be more than they are; they guessed the neighbors\u2019 dinners and graded themselves on accuracy. A cardinal made the noise cardinals make when they have imagined themselves more important than other birds and then remembered that air does not care. A car passed with the music loud enough to make the air hold its breath, and then the car went on and the air sighed. Abigail touched the place on Zante\u2019s hand where the pencil always leaves a smudge and asked whether it had a plan to be permanent, and Zante said that smudges are how paper forgives us for trying to be precise.\n\nSomewhere else, a woman in denim took off a jacket she did not need and folded it as if it had a memory she respected. She taped the last of her coins together and then took them apart again and then threw the tape out and then took the tape back because waste makes her feel weak. She put a letter with a crossbar that had softened on a table and under it she put a ring she had not worn because tape and rings want the same fingers. She lay down without making her bed think any particular thoughts about her day. She said nothing about God and nothing about art and nothing about cities and nothing about fists and nothing about mouths. She said a small thing for herself: my feet hurt. Sometimes the body will save your life by forcing you to be literal.\n\nOn Sunday, Zante preached and did not say giant and did not say rumor and did not say hinge as a metaphor. She said, \u201cWe are made of verbs,\u201d and she said, \u201cYou do not owe a performance to people who will eat you,\u201d and she said, \u201cIf you want to stop saying sorry like a hymn, say thank you like a table blessing instead,\u201d and she left space at the end for quiet, the kind of quiet that is not an emptiness but a bowl. Abigail sat in the front and did not photograph; she let her own mouth be the mouth that listens. After, a woman with purple lipstick that was the right shade this time and a denim jacket she had chosen because the air conditioner in her office was a bully asked if there was a potluck and whether she could bring deviled eggs to something, anything, later, and Zante said yes, bring them on Thursday, we will invent a reason.\n\nThat night, under the whale magnet, the list that said no had been nudged by air until its corners curled and it looked like a page that had learned humility. They left it. In the morning someone would open the door and it would lift and fall and someone would say a small thing and someone would say a larger thing and the city would do what cities do, which is to wake up and decide where to put their attention like people decide where to put their hands. Somewhere a hinge would be oiled and somewhere a door would be left to squeal, and in between those sounds there would be a child with a penny and a game and a father who will never again let a giant buy his grief a ticket.",

A child on a tricycle said she heard steps that made the pavement hiccup. A teenager working the kettle-corn stand swore he saw a woman taller than streetlamps but thinner than a storm, cross the lot without moving her knees. A valet outside the refurbed synagogue told his cousin\u2019s roommate that he felt a breath, just one enormous breath, over his shoulder as he counted tips.\n\nOn the night Maybelle Jarvis disappeared, no one heard any scream. There were just the fair noises\u2014laughter spread thin, a band failing a cover of a song that should never be covered, someone shouting bingo though it wasn\u2019t that kind of night. There was a pause in the long chain of neon letters that spelled out FRESH LEMONADE, and then a little more pause, and two boys arguing about the rules of tag took half a step backward and bumped into no one. Maybelle\u2019s father tipped his paper cup to finish the ice, frowned at the bitterness, looked down and saw her shoe. It was unscuffed, two Velcro straps, the glitter already flaking off like fish scales. And there were the photographs later, but the photographs came after the whispering had built a mouth of its own.\n\nThe photographs were of lips. Not eyes or faces or the way hair falls when you\u2019re not knowing it\u2019s being watched. The lips, only the lips, pursed or parted, some blown up until they became their own landscapes. They were found in a neat fan near the back of the library. The library stayed open late on fair nights because of air conditioning and safety, and because the woman at the reference desk believed in books like you believe in lint you can never quite get off your jacket. The photographs were smudged in the corners as if someone had moved them with hands too large to do delicate work.\n\nPeople in Tallahassee talk small-town, long-road, quick to think they know the whole of anything. Within two days the giant had a name. They called her Abigail.\n\nShe was jealous, the whispers went. That\u2019s why she squished the little ones. Jealous of what, exactly, no one agreed on. Some said of innocence, some said of attention, some said of the shrinking of the country into screens small enough to tuck into a palm. Jealousy was the one word everyone could hold.\n\nOn Sundays, Zante preached about envy without naming it. She wore her collar, thin like a ribbon you could cut with your teeth, and stood in the clear-hewn light of the high windows. She was not tall, but there was something in her posture that made people sit straighter. She had the look of somebody who remembers what the backs of stations smell like. In the whispers she had two titles, one of them true, the other more of a shadow that stuck and would not let go: vicar and DCI. She\u2019d been the latter across an ocean, once. The collar had come after the badge, and Tallhassee\u2014she pronounced it correctly most days\u2014embraced her as something rare, a woman who could officiate a wedding and diagram a crime scene and bring casseroles in foil pans that never found their way back.\n\nOn the Sunday after the fair, she climbed the three wooden steps to the pulpit and paused, as if listening to the building breathe.\n\n\u201cCoveting,\u201d she said. \u201cWe like to save that word for lists. We like to keep it in stone. Thou shalt not. But the hollows in us have better handwriting than stone.\u201d\n\nAbigail sat in the front pew, a smile tucked into her cheek like a coin you don\u2019t want to spend. She had a wide forehead that would gleam when she laughed, and she laughed often, and her hands were always moving. She ran a studio in a small brick unit just off Gaines Street. She photographed mouths precisely because everyone else wanted eyes. She called it honest work, close work. She kept the old cameras on shelves and in glass cases; the digital ones sat in a drawer that stuck. Her prints hung on the walls in the church hall, lips painted, lips chapped, lips child-soft, lips grandmother wise. People said the photographs made them uneasy. People also bought them, because that\u2019s what unease will do when it meets a credit card and a blank spot on a wall.\n\nSome parishioners shifted when Zante leaned into the sermon. She spoke about a neighbor in London who had painted his fence a color that could only be called radioactive apricot. \u201cAnd I loved my faded fence until I saw his,\u201d she said. \u201cI confess I wanted his fence to peel.\u201d She wore her hair pulled back, no stray piece allowed, the soft drawl she\u2019d learned in Tallahassee braided with a sharper music from other rains. \u201cJealousy,\u201d she said, \u201cis the crowded feeling. The feeling that says there\u2019s not enough room left for your soul. We do not become bigger by stepping on someone else\u2019s breath, but oh, how we try.\u201d\n\nAbigail\u2019s smile thinned on the word breath. It was subtle, a little thing, and then it was gone.\n\nAfter the service, the hall turned to coffee and polite noise. Children darted between folding chairs; two slid on their socks along the varnished strip of floor that wasn\u2019t as sticky as the rest. Abigail stood by the window and watched the kids, watched their mouths, watched the words begin and slip and break. She tilted her head. She said to no one in particular: \u201cWe promise with our mouths first. We make vows before we learn to write.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re sermonizing now,\u201d Zante said, warm behind her. She brushed a crumb off the dark sleeve of Abigail\u2019s dress. Abigail tipped her chin, a little defensively.\n\n\u201cYou were good,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe too good. They\u2019re going to want you to save them from a fable.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to want me to visit a fairground,\u201d Zante replied. \u201cAnd I will.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou? Or the other you?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe both me,\u201d Zante said, and smiled. She meant the collar and the old badge, the title everyone loved to whisper. DCI. It had followed her like a stray cat across customs, through a courthouse, into a church.\n\nBy afternoon, the fair was mostly gone, the temporary lights snapped down and trucked away, the asphalt unrolled again into its usual blank. A few chalk drawings persisted\u2014crooked houses with windows square as teeth. Zante walked the path between the palms, wearing ordinary shoes, the hem of her skirt catching on the weeds that poke where the maintenance budget lets them. Sergeant Boone trailed a few paces behind, big-shouldered, unsure where to put his hands when he was with a woman who wouldn\u2019t take his hat and wouldn\u2019t fit into his ideas of categories.\n\n\u201cAppreciate you coming,\u201d he said for the fourth time, and the fourth time Zante nodded. He\u2019d been the one to call her, late, his voice thick with heat and something he wouldn\u2019t name.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not technically my parishioner,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd you\u2019re not technically my officer.\u201d She crouched near a puddle, peered at the ripples the wind made. \u201cBut technically is thin ice. We stand on thicker things.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe found these,\u201d Boone said, and opened a paper bag that had grease shadows from the lemon doughnuts people had been choking down with beer. Photographs slid into Zante\u2019s palm. Lips. So close-farmed that you could see the powdery coat of sugar on one mouth, the cracked dentist-candy stripe on another. One set that looked bruised but might only have been painted purple in the way children paint. No teeth show. That fact bothered Zante in a way she did not explain even to herself.\n\n\u201cThese were left in the playhouse by the swings,\u201d Boone said. He was gentle with the words, like they could break into panic in his throat. \u201cKids go in there all the time. Moms sit outside and scroll through. It\u2019s not their fault. I keep telling anyone who tries to say that.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is no one\u2019s fault to trust a soft afternoon,\u201d Zante said. \u201cIs it a single photographer?\u201d She tilted the stack so that the light passed again over the glossy prints, saw the same slight misalignment in the grain of the paper. The same font on the back, a series number. Each print signed with a single initial\u2014A.\n\n\u201cThe rumor,\u201d Boone said. He flushed. \u201cThe rumor is stupid.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat rumor isn\u2019t?\u201d Zante looked at the puddle again, then at the footprints hardening into nothing. \u201cSay it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe rumor says she\u2019s huge. Like folklore huge. Like she stepped straight out of some old bedtime tale and got mad because no one tells bedtime. Like she\u2019s jealous that everything you could ever want to watch is in your phone, and nobody leaves milk or coins on the windowsill anymore. I know. But\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cShe?\u201d\n\n\u201cEverybody says she. They call her Abigail. Don\u2019t know why. The name\u2019s just there now. Like a... hitchhiker you can\u2019t not see.\u201d\n\nZante said nothing for a moment. Abigail. She rolled the name slowly through her mind, as if it had grown spines overnight. Her Abigail was probably arranging prints on a studio wall, glass of water sweating a ring onto the old table she refused to refinish. Her Abigail would say I told you, with no smugness, just the frankness that had seduced Zante\u2019s caution into sleep.\n\n\u201cYou have the parents somewhere quiet?\u201d Zante asked finally.\n\n\u201cAt home,\u201d Boone said. \u201cThe girl\u2019s father\u2019s a baker. He\u2019s been bringing loaves to the station since my first day. I want to bring him something. Past the mail, you know? But what do you bring. There\u2019s no\u2014\u201d He cut off. In the shallow shade of the live oaks, his eyes were soft and useless.\n\n\u201cYou bring your listening,\u201d Zante said. \u201cAnd polite water. And you bring the truth, gently. And if you pray, you pray first and again later.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou think it\u2019s the same as the Killearn case?\u201d Boone asked. \u201cThe one with the three Polaroids left in the park band shell?\u201d\n\nZante turned the photographs over in her gloved hand. The edges of the images had the faintly warm feel of instant film, but the stock was modern. Someone was pretending at nostalgia. Someone wanted to be myth and was willing to buy the supplies.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s the same, it\u2019s the same person finding a new height,\u201d she said, not answering the biggest question. \u201cOr pretending to be bigger. You like the word giant because it lets you stop making small choices.\u201d\n\nBoone frowned. \u201cYou think somebody\u2019s staging the footprints?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat footprints?\u201d Zante hadn\u2019t looked for prints yet. It wasn\u2019t as if there would be prints, big or otherwise. But at his face, she straightened and followed his gesture.\n\nHe led her to a long shallow mark along the grass. It hadn\u2019t rained, but the sprinklers had done their midnight work. The imprint of something long and flat had pushed the blades down in an oval. Another, twenty feet away. No toes, no heel. As if a rowboat had taken a stroll, skidding on its underside in slow arcs.\n\n\u201cKids tried to stand in them,\u201d Boone said, a little fierce. \u201cWe sent them home. Ground\u2019s already springing up, see? The earth forgets quickly.\u201d\n\nZante went on one knee and placed her palm on the crushed grass as if feeling a pulse. The day-long heat rose into her skin.\n\n\u201cIf you had a huge foot, you\u2019d leave more than this,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you had a cart on skids and a telephone pole, you might mimic it with some practice and whiskey.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut why?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause someone wants us to look up. Because someone wants us to tell a story about big things.\u201d\n\nBoone swallowed, his throat working visibly. \u201cWe\u2019re missing a girl. I don\u2019t want to look clever on the news. I want\u2014the obvious.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have never once found the obvious to be anything but rude,\u201d Zante said. Her voice softened. \u201cI know what you want. I want the same. And I want a world where no one whispers children\u2019s names in the wrong past tense.\u201d\n\nThat night, Abigail came home late, smelling faintly of developer and something sweet and a little too coppery. Zante was at the table with three notebooks and a bowl of cherries. She wrote with a pencil. She always had liked the impermanence of lead.\n\n\u201cYou came home,\u201d Abigail said, in a tone that made it sound as if the choice were surprising every time.\n\n\u201cI do that,\u201d Zante said, not looking up yet. She finished the sentence she was coaxing, placed the pencil carefully on the open page.\n\n\u201cEveryone asked me if I\u2019m okay,\u201d Abigail went on. \u201cAt the studio. As if the weirdness is a smoke only some lungs deserve.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you?\u201d Zante\u2019s eyes met hers. Abigail\u2019s pupils were bigger than the light warranted; they tended to be that way at night.\n\n\u201cI am the okay that everyone else can stand,\u201d Abigail said. She walked to the sink, ran the tap, let the glass fill and overflow into her hand. \u201cYou were at the fairground?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a parking lot now.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey found pictures again.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d Zante tapped the edge of her notebook. Her days were built of facts and fissures. \u201cMouths,\u201d she said.\n\nAbigail hoisted herself onto the counter, her bare feet swinging slightly, touching the cabinet doors like metronomes. \u201cPeople don\u2019t like mouths,\u201d she said. \u201cThey like the idea of the eye, the soul-window, whatever. But the mouth is the errand-runner of the soul. It\u2019s where the promise goes from thought to thing. That scares them.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt scares them because it betrays them,\u201d Zante said evenly, and Abigail smiled, because Zante understood the work even when she wasn\u2019t trying.\n\nAbigail\u2019s hair smelled like rain and metal and something else. Zante lifted her own glass, took a sip, and waited for the part of the evening where the quiet unclenched enough to be named. Abigail let the faucet keep running and then remembered and turned it off with an apology to no one.\n\n\u201cI heard it again today,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cHeard what?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe name. Abigail. The giant. It\u2019s almost funny until it puts its hands on your back.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a name like any other.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s mine.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can share it,\u201d Zante said, but there was a small press in her chest she refused to call dread.\n\n\u201cDo you think she\u2019s real?\u201d Abigail asked. She was watching Zante\u2019s mouth. She did that when she wanted to borrow a truth.\n\n\u201cI think people are missing,\u201d Zante said. She got up to rinse the cherries. She did not say that the story of big feet is easier to hold than the story of a hand that fits inside a doorjamb.\n\n\u201cWhen you were a detective,\u201d Abigail said, \u201cdid you ever have to consider a suspect twice because you loved them?\u201d She said it like a thought you\u2019d throw away if it didn\u2019t catch air.\n\nZante turned, slowly. \u201cWhat is this.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m asking.\u201d Abigail slid down from the counter, her feet soft on the floor. \u201cHypothetically. You know how people are. They gossip. They say. They\u2019ll look at my cameras, my lips. They\u2019ll pick at names. And you\u2019ll have to talk to me like I might be a person who...\u201d\n\n\u201cWho what?\u201d Zante\u2019s voice sharpened, then softened again. \u201cYou are not the rumor. You know what I think of rumors.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou think they\u2019re lazy.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think they\u2019re hungry and have terrible table manners.\u201d\n\nAbigail lifted her shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s a good line.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s also true,\u201d Zante said. \u201cDo you want to tell me something, Abi?\u201d\n\nAbigail\u2019s mouth tightened, then loosened. She had a beautiful mouth. People had told her that all her life. It had made her practice closing it.\n\n\u201cOnly,\u201d she said, \u201cthat I\u2019m colder when I should be warm. It\u2019s August and I keep getting cold.\u201d\n\nZante crossed to her and touched her arm, felt the fine cool sweat there. \u201cHot then cold,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s Florida. The AC everywhere is a sin and a kindness.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m jealous,\u201d Abigail said suddenly, the word leaving her almost by accident, like a hiccup you\u2019d hoped to swallow. \u201cOf all the little people who know how to be just that. Little. Quiet. Loved for it.\u201d\n\nZante felt her eyebrows lift.\n\n\u201cI should have been born a bird with a long shadow,\u201d Abigail said. She laughed, but it was a brittle thing. \u201cForget I said that.\u201d\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d Zante said softly. She put her palm on the back of Abigail\u2019s neck. She could feel the muscle, the slow tension. She could never quite tell where Abigail ended and performance began. Maybe that was true of everyone. Maybe that was why Abigail\u2019s photographs unsettled, because mouths forget to perform when they\u2019re close enough to the lens to feel embarrassed.\n\nOutside, a truck downshifted and groaned like old bones. The house took the sound and held it in the eaves. Zante went back to her notebooks when Abigail slipped into the bath. She could hear the water running again. She ran her finger along a line she\u2019d written and wasn\u2019t sure she agreed with herself. Sometimes the pencil seemed to have its own notion of truth, and she let it.\n\nAt midnight, the phone in the hallway rang once, twice, a little too fast. Zante lifted it and said hello in a voice that apologized for being awake.\n\nBoone\u2019s voice came back, almost a whisper. \u201cWe got something. You\u2019ll want to see.\u201d He gave her the address of a park at the edge of town, where the lakes smelt like their own summers, where the boardwalk creaked under tourists and joggers and children throwing bread that wasn\u2019t for birds.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be there,\u201d Zante said.\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t ask what.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have stopped asking that on the phone,\u201d she said, which was true. The answer was always someone\u2019s breathing or the lack of it.\n\nShe wrote a note for Abigail and placed it on the kitchen tile because the counter was still damp. Gone to help Boone. Back before the light grows. Love you. She stared at the Love you, turned the pencil to the eraser, then didn\u2019t. She left it alone. They had an agreement to make statements and not undo them in the small hours.\n\nThe park was empty except for the kind of empty that is actually a chorus. The insects stuttered and sang, the water moved its small shoulders under the stars, someone in a house across the way told an unhappy dog that everything was fine. Zante pulled into grass and killed the lights. She saw Boone\u2019s silhouette near the boardwalk rail and another smaller shape crouched in the waiting posture of those who have learned not to move until asked.\n\n\u201cDetect\u2014\u201d the smaller shape said automatically, then stumbled. \u201cVicar. Sorry.\u201d\n\n\u201cZante works,\u201d she said. She recognized Lyle, the forensic tech whose hair looked always recently cut by a friend. He handed her a flashlight, its heft like something old-fashioned and comforting. Better than those too-bright LEDs that erase shadows. She liked shadows to speak before she forced them into confession.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not blood,\u201d Lyle said quickly. \u201cJust paint. On the boards. It\u2019s washed where the sprinklers hit, but you can see where they... paced it out.\u201d\n\nPaced. There were marks\u2014dark, slightly sticky still, in big ovals. Someone had lifted a bucket and set it down in a pattern that implied strides. Farther apart than a human\u2019s could be, unless the human was running hurdles with a freakish efficiency. The ovals were not perfect. They were overwhelmed by their own attempt at hugeness.\n\n\u201cHow many?\u201d Zante asked.\n\n\u201cFourteen,\u201d Lyle said. \u201cIt ends by that bench, and the last two go off into the grass, where everything\u2019s too messy to talk back.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd here,\u201d Boone said, lowering his voice further, as if the lake might eavesdrop and repeat him to trees, \u201chere we found this.\u201d\n\nIt was a picture, of course. Lips, of course. This one smaller, printed on thinner paper, not instant film. A child\u2019s mouth, a missing tooth. The kind of raw gap that makes a smile look new-made and hopeful. There was a ring of sticky red around the edges as if someone had colored outside the line. But the red was nothing that belonged to a body. It was the same paint that had made the walking ovals.\n\nThe picture had been propped against a pair of flip-flops. Blue, with a cartoon fish embossed where a big toe would rest. Size small enough to break your heart.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re Maybelle\u2019s,\u201d Boone said. \u201cShe got them yesterday.\u201d\n\nZante put a hand on the back of the bench so she could feel something that had not been moved. The night pushed softly into her lungs. She kept her eyes on the lake, because sometimes if you did not stare at the thing that frightened you, it would walk into your peripheral and reveal itself as a smaller thing.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a pattern,\u201d Lyle said, because that is what forensic techs like best. \u201cThree days between this and Killearn. Two weeks between Killearn and the one at Levy Park. And\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to stop the pattern,\u201d Boone said. He said it like a spell he wanted to believe in. He looked at Zante. \u201cRight?\u201d\n\nZante felt something old shift inside her. The thing that made her cruel when she needed to be, and kind when it cost her. The thing that had gotten her out of high-visibility jackets and into a collar she had truly chosen. The thing that could flip between interrogating and absolving without moving her feet.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to interrupt it,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to make it trip on itself.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow?\u201d Lyle asked, breathless, young.\n\n\u201cBy refusing to play big,\u201d Zante said. \u201cBy letting small see us.\u201d\n\nThey worked the scene until the sky forgot its dark. Zante watched the sprinklers come on and glitter the paint into lesser ovals. She watched the mist hover around Boone\u2019s shoulders like ghosts of possibilities, then fall. She watched a heron decide that the day was coming and would not be argued with, and she admired it for the indifference.\n\nAt home, the house smelled of shampoo and sleeping. Abigail lay on her side, one arm flung above her head like a flag. Zante\u2019s note was at the edge of the rug where a shoe could catch it. The pencil mark of Love you looked stodgy in the early light, and for a second Zante thought about writing the words again, soon, in a way that didn\u2019t look like a homework answer. She brushed hair from Abigail\u2019s cheek and saw a faint smudge along the jawline, the color of the paint in the park when it had been thinned by dew.\n\n\u201cCamera smudge,\u201d Abigail murmured, half-awake. \u201cDon\u2019t interrogate me in bed, Zan.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t,\u201d Zante said, even though she had been, with her eyes.\n\n\u201cYou smell like grass.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been in it.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverything is a sermon,\u201d Abigail sighed. \u201cEven your being in the grass.\u201d\n\nZante undressed and stood a minute at the window. The neighbors\u2019 cat.\nThe slow dawn. The city stretching off its small aches. She thought about feet. She thought about jealousy. She thought about vows made with mouths, and about how some people used cameras, and how some people used stories. She thought about the name Abigail, and about how names can be so light and so heavy at once, like a balloon tied to a stone. She thought about the bench by the lake and the flip-flops and the gap in the missing tooth, that little square of truth, and she prayed without words, because words had taken the night off.\n\nShe slept then, a little, and dreamt of walking ovals. In the dream, the ovals lengthened and shortened depending on how fast you believed. In the dream, someone very tall stooped to enter a doorway that insisted on being ordinary, and the stoop was the saddest part, not the height.\n\nThe week moved. The heat drew everything sticky. People came in to talk to Zante and left again leaning against the doorframe for an extra second, as if touching wood would rub off a blessing. Middle-schoolers traded dares at bus stops about keeping a coin on their tongues for an hour to confuse the giant. Someone made a T-shirt with a crude drawing of a woman stepping on a line of faceless stick figures and the caption Don\u2019t Be Little. The T-shirt sold out fast. People wore irony as a kind of sunscreen.\n\n\u201cCome tonight,\u201d Abigail said one evening, shoving a postcard toward Zante. \u201cOpening at the studio. Lips and Lies. I figured if they\u2019re going to make me the villain, I may as well curate the exhibit.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bad time to invite eyes,\u201d Zante said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a worse time to hide,\u201d Abigail said. She had written the title on the card herself in a hand that looked like it had never been taught to compromise on loops. \u201cPeople are going to put me in your rumor whether I ask them to or not. Let me choose the frame.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have to meet Boone,\u201d Zante said, and saw the small jealous flare in Abigail\u2019s face like a match that wanted to be a torch and knew better. \u201cI\u2019ll come after,\u201d she amended. \u201cI\u2019ll be late, but I\u2019ll come.\u201d\n\n\u201cBring your collar,\u201d Abigail said, half a joke, half a dare.\n\n\u201cI always have it,\u201d Zante said, which was usually true. The white strip of faith in a world that would try to tear it from her, or tuck it in her pocket. She liked how it made people remember their own sentences.\n\nThat night, a storm bruised the north, then decided to make up and took its lightning elsewhere. Zante and Boone sat in a patrol car outside a park that had not yet been blessed by rumor. They watched the emptiness, and they waited to interrupt a pattern. It was boring, and Zante loved it. Patience was a cathedral.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re baying for a giant in my inbox,\u201d Boone said, tapping his phone and then turning it face-down as if that could hush it. \u201cParents. Reporters. Strangers. They want one big story they can fold into a headline, one big villain to feed and chase.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe greatest kindness you can give people,\u201d Zante said, \u201cis a smaller story.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou talk like a vicar.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause it\u2019s true,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd because you want me to say I don\u2019t believe in giants. And I don\u2019t. And because I know that sometimes the small person inside someone very ordinary learns to make their shadow big.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe or he,\u201d Boone said, careful.\n\n\u201cShe,\u201d Zante said, and even the word felt complicated in her throat.\n\nWhen the night was far along and the crickets were exhausted with their own insisting, Zante\u2019s phone buzzed. Abigail: the opening is a circus. Wish you were here to bless it and also curse it.\n\nZante: I\u2019ll come in an hour.\n\nAbigail: Promise with your mouth?\n\nZante smiled in the glow. She typed, Yes. She put the phone away and peered out at the line of cattails doing their careful dance.\n\nThe trap they had set was not clever. They had left nothing obvious to tempt anyone. They had simply been present where a pattern said someone might come. Twice, a raccoon considered them. Once, a boy on a bike stopped and stared and then pedaled away, singing under his breath to prove that he was fearless. Zante watched the path and the dark and the places where the dark was lighter, and she thought of the opening with its wine and its lips on walls, and of Abigail in her dress with pockets, joking about being a myth in comfortable shoes.\n\nAt almost midnight, across the way, something moved. Something that could have been a person but felt like a mistake the landscape was trying out. The motion had a slow deliberation. Zante leaned forward. The figure paused by the bench. It was wrong in the scaling\u2014too tall and too thin, as if legs that didn\u2019t belong to the torso had decided to attend the event and make the torso catch up. The head turned toward them. The face was a blur of shadow.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t switch on the headlights,\u201d Zante said, in a voice that contained a steel buckle. \u201cDon\u2019t. Let it think we\u2019re just talking. Let it try to be a legend.\u201d\n\nBoone\u2019s hands were white on the wheel. Lyle, in the back, held his breath like it owed him money. The figure took a step\u2014long, improbable. It carried something in both hands, held out and low, as if serving a tray of pieces of night.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that,\u201d Boone whispered.\n\n\u201cPhotographs,\u201d Zante said. \u201cOr the opposite of.\u201d\n\nThe figure reached the bench and arranged its objects there, tender as a nurse with a sleeping child. Then it straightened and did the thing that made Zante\u2019s heart misstep: it lifted one foot high, too high, held it, and brought it down slowly, deliberately, like an actor hitting a mark that had been taped to a floor no one else could see. The sound it made was not the sound a true giant would make. It was hollow and a little ridiculous and precisely what the rumor had ordered.\n\n\u201cNow,\u201d Zante said, and Boone flicked the headlights and the siren yipped to life, once, twice. In the sudden glare, the figure panicked. It turned half-sideways. For a heartbeat, Zante saw the long shadow of it peel from the ground and curl back. She saw the contraption that graced its legs\u2014stilts strapped to thighs with smart leather, the kind used in the circus and in protest marches, the kind you could rent from a place in the warehouse district if you gave a good reason. She saw a mask that was in fact a hood pulled low, and the glint of a lens hanging at the throat like a small, rude heart.\n\nIt ran. Or tried to run, but stilts aren\u2019t good for running, and stories aren\u2019t good for fleeing when the truth has put on its boots. Boone and Lyle were out and moving, and Zante was out too, not trusting her own knees and trusting them anyway. The figure kicked and faltered, and in three fast seconds they were on it, and the figure was on the ground, and the stilts lay akimbo like arguments that had never been persuasive.\n\n\u201cHands,\u201d Boone said, and the figure lifted them.\n\nThin fingers. Black gloves. A ring on the fourth finger left hand, scratched.\n\nZante felt the world do a peculiar slide then, as if the angle of the ground had shifted by a degree.\n\n\u201cTake off the hood,\u201d she said. \u201cSlowly.\u201d\n\nThe figure hesitated. Then obeyed. The hood fell away. Hair, damp with sweat, and a face that had learned how to be two things at once, and a mouth Zante knew well enough to name.\n\n\u201cAbi,\u201d she said, impossibly calm, impossibly not calm. \u201cGet up.\u201d\n\nAbigail looked up at her wife. The eyes were dark, the pupils bigger than any night required. Her face held no surprise. It held a weariness, a relief, a defiance, all slipping surfaces.\n\n\u201cI walked too big,\u201d Abigail said, voice raw like rope-burn. \u201cYou wanted small.\u201d\n\nBehind them, the lake sighed. In the bench\u2019s shadow, under the hard blankness of the headlights, a fan of photographs shone. Lips, lips, lips. Little ink notes on the backs in Abigail\u2019s precise hand. Names. Dates. No graphic cruelty, nothing you could hold up to a court and say Look, look what she did. But every image a trespass, a taking.\n\nBoone made a noise like swallowing a nail. Lyle whispered what people whisper when any magic turns into an ordinary mess.\n\nZante said nothing. She held her collar with one hand, felt its edge. She tried to make the world stop its slide and stand still enough for her to meet it. She looked at Abigail\u2014the woman from the front pew, the woman who had caught a bird with her bare hands once and set it free without leaving a feather behind, the woman whose jealousy had always been beautiful when it was about little things, sweaters at thrift stores, bruised peaches, other people\u2019s fences.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re doing this here?\u201d Abigail said, and smiled, small and crooked. \u201cWith the mouth you told me to trust?\u201d\n\nZante looked at the stilts in the grass, at the ring on Abigail\u2019s finger, at the way the truth had decided to dance just out of time. She wanted to say a thousand things, each weighted, each a vow or a curse or a prayer. She wanted to say: There is a big story. She wanted to say: You are not a giant. She wanted to say: Stop being the weather in other people\u2019s skies. She wanted to say: I love you. She wanted to say: My love is smaller now. Or bigger. Or sideways.\n\nIn the end, she said only: \u201cTake a breath.\u201d\n\nAbigail did. It sounded, for a brief, aching second, like the first breath any child ever takes when it decides to be here. Then the siren yipped again, as if to remind the air of its other uses, and the night went on being night, in the way it does, even as all the names inside it shift.",

                              "content": "By morning the city had learned to pronounce what happened at the lake in three different ways. In the first version, the police caught the giant, easy as catching a frog in a coffee can if you have the timing. In the second, a woman on stilts proved that everyone was stupid for believing anything larger than a shoe. In the third, the vicar\u2019s wife was an artist who confused the size of her feelings with the size of her body, and the vicar had the look of someone who had mistaken love for a reliable witness. Radio hosts chewed the facts until they were flavorless and then spit them between jokes. The meteorologist used phrases like unstable air mass and everyone heard unstable and wished they didn\u2019t.\n\nThey put Abigail in a room with a camera and a table so clean the light invented fingerprints to feel useful. Boone would have preferred to hand her to strangers in suits, but Tallahassee doesn\u2019t have as many of those as a bigger city, and besides, every stranger in a suit eventually wants to talk to a vicar. Zante stood in the hallway with her collar in her pocket because she did not trust what it would remind people of, and also because the plastic chair there made wearing holiness feel theatrical. She could see Abigail through the slat of the blinds. It felt indecent, the way watching your own house from the sidewalk feels indecent even when you have a key.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t be in there,\u201d Boone said for the fourth time, and the fourth time Zante said, \u201cI am not in there, Sergeant. I am in the hall, being furniture.\u201d He ran a hand over his jaw and made a sound that was part apology and part relief. The two of them were learning the choreography of impossible days. Don\u2019t call it a dance. No one was wearing the right shoes.\n\nThey sent in a woman from Records who knew how to ask stupid questions that get smart answers. \u201cName?\u201d she said, and Abigail, thin shoulders set, enunciated each syllable like a bead on a rosary. \u201cOccupation?\u201d \u201cPhotographer.\u201d \u201cDo you enjoy your work?\u201d \u201cEnjoy is a fragile word.\u201d It was theater, and it wasn\u2019t. Every interrogation is a performance, but the good ones allow the actor to forget she is acting for three minutes and in those three minutes she tells you where the doorway is.\n\nZante did not watch when they read the rights. She did not have a taste for the sound of law being recited like weather. She looked instead at her own thumbnail and saw a crescent of blue paint she had missed in the early kitchen light. It wasn\u2019t a sign; it was contact. She had touched the bench, touched the photographs, touched a night that had touched everything and everyone. She rubbed the paint away against the seam of her trousers and felt like a magician with no tricks left but misdirection.\n\nAbigail did not ask for a lawyer for precisely twenty-seven minutes. Then she did, and the room halted like a toy train, and all the adults in the hallway remembered they were in a building where the vending machine was always empty of Dr Pepper. Boone cursed softly at the air, and the air didn\u2019t change its mind. They set it up for morning, a lawyer from a firm with a name like a polite cough. Until then, nothing big could be said, only small questions with answers that were shaped like fog.\n\n\u201cIs she going to tell us where the girl is?\u201d Boone asked, and Zante realized the pronoun had proven too cumbersome for him to adjust. She did not correct him. You spend all your corrections on the things you can move.\n\n\u201cShe will tell you what she has made,\u201d Zante said. \u201cShe will not tell you what she hasn\u2019t. Not because she won\u2019t, but because she can\u2019t. She doesn\u2019t have it in her mouth.\u201d It was an odd phrase, but it felt right. There are truths you can hold easily in your hands and others that you can hold only with the tongue, tasting their shape until the taste becomes a word.\n\nThe statement they were allowed to take was small. Abigail admitted to the stilts. She admitted to buying paint in three colors because art school had taught her that the eye wants variation even when the lie is monochrome. She admitted to placing photographs \u201cas a conversation,\u201d which is the kind of phrase that makes a detective rearrange his expression so his face doesn\u2019t blurt his opinion. She admitted to moving Maybelle\u2019s flip-flops because \u201cthey were sad by themselves.\u201d She did not admit to taking Maybelle. She said the name carefully each time, as if it might shatter if any syllable grazed a tooth. When asked where she found the flip-flops, she said near the edge of the boardwalk, \u201ccaught on a knot the city has never sanded,\u201d and Boone wrote that wording down because exact phrases sometimes point to places the body misses.\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t call anyone when you saw them,\u201d the woman from Records said, not with accusation, but with a steady kind of disappointment, like a grandmother who has found beer in the garage and wanted craft and found cheap.\n\n\u201cI left them where the city would look,\u201d Abigail said, and then closed her eyes as if hearing herself from somewhere slightly to the left. \u201cI wanted them found by a story. I should have wanted them found by a person.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou made the giant,\u201d the woman said. \u201cOr helped it be made.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople were hungry and I brought spoons,\u201d Abigail said, and something like shame passed through the room and briefly wrung it out.\n\nThey booked Abigail on anything they could book her on without pretending the justice system was a vending machine. Tampering. False reporting. Trespass. The phrases didn\u2019t sit well on the desk. They were technicalities trying on moral suits. Boone filled out forms because his hands needed the ritual. He called the man with the stilt rental, who said yes, that girl, she had cash and a face made of daring, and he had asked her what she intended and she said \u201cheight,\u201d and he had told her to be careful, because height is a thing you fall from.\n\nWhen Zante stepped outside, the humidity sat up and asked her what she was doing. The parking lot\u2019s glare was church-bright; everything honest looked guilty in it. She thought of going home and decided that home wasn\u2019t a place she could put her body without her mind starting a fire there. She drove instead toward Gaines Street, the part of town that had rehearsed being a different city and then decided to keep its old name. The studio\u2019s windows were still crowded with last night\u2019s faces, framed and lit so that mouths took on the reckless power of eyes.\n\nThe key under the third potted fern worked. She had it because Abigail had made the concept of spare keys feel like a trust exercise she liked winning. Inside, the air smelled like chemicals and the ghosts of fruit, the way a candy store might smell after it had decided to get serious. The floor had paint on it that had been there long enough to form its own opinions. On the big worktable, a fan of contact prints; the panes of small pictures felt like a child\u2019s game that had become something else when no one was watching. Names on the back of some, just descriptors on others. Tooth. Sneeze. Summer. Promise. There was a system and it offended Zante that she couldn\u2019t see it at a glance.\n\nShe didn\u2019t touch anything she couldn\u2019t justify later. She walked to the back room and found the drawer that stuck and opened it anyway with a patience Abigail rarely used. The digital things nested there like insects that knew they were useful but pretended not to be proud of it. One camera was on and shouldn\u2019t have been. Zante picked it up and cooed the way you coo to something you suspect will bite. The screen showed thumbnails of mouths, yes, and between them, three photographs that were not mouths: a boardwalk knot close-up, the kind that catches a strap; a child\u2019s glove, the cheap stretchy kind, balled in the angle where a bench meets shadow; and a paper cup from a lemonade stand, crushed, with the word FRESH interrupted by a thumb.\n\nShe did not take the card. She did not even scroll. She put the camera back where it would look like indifference. She stepped to the sink. On the lip there was a dotted line of something that looked black and was, when she rubbed it, a deep purple. Lipstick, the kind chosen by people who want to look like a bruise is a decision. Abigail didn\u2019t own that shade. Abigail said colors were better when they asked for forgiveness before they suggested sin. Someone else had been in the studio, or someone in the studio had borrowed a mouth.\n\nOn the drive to the Jarvis house, the road\u2019s heat shimmered like an afterthought the sky had already regretted. The street had the kind of trees that make you think cities forgive more than they do. Maybelle\u2019s father opened the door with the expression of a man who has been taught for years how to greet, and woke to find he had forgotten his manners. He was not wearing his apron; he was wearing an old T-shirt that said HOLE FOODS because bakers make puns or endure them. The living room had a couch that had taught generations of naps how to behave. The shoe from the fair sat on a chair by itself, as if time-out might staunch the bleeding of absence.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not the police,\u201d Zante said, and felt the lie in the second syllable. She was the police in a way that couldn\u2019t be turned off. She introduced Boone because manners are a rope you can hold even when the bridge has fallen. She did not apologize for breathing their air.\n\n\u201cMy daughter won\u2019t even know she\u2019s missing,\u201d the father said. \u201cShe\u2019ll think she\u2019s in a line for something fun and she\u2019ll be so patient. The patience will kill me.\u201d He rubbed the back of his neck. His hand stopped at the crest of muscle again and again like a wave that didn\u2019t believe in the shore. \u201cThey said you caught\u2026\u201d He didn\u2019t finish the sentence. You don\u2019t put a wife\u2019s name on a hook in a house where photographs of field-day ribbons hang.\n\n\u201cWe caught a theater,\u201d Zante said gently. \u201cWe did not catch what we need.\u201d\n\nHe nodded and led them to Maybelle\u2019s room because people do that, as if rooms can offer the kind of answers people won\u2019t. It was small and intentional. A poster of a whale with its rib lines drawn like the bars on a musical staff. A book on the bed open to a page where someone had underlined the word lighthouse because Maybelle had liked how solid the H looked. The second flip-flop was not there. Zante had not expected it to be. On the dresser, pennies in a dish. Boone looked at them like they were a test. He and pennies had history; every cop has at least one useless object he has sworn allegiance to because on one day years ago it felt like a talisman.\n\n\u201cWas Maybelle at the library a lot?\u201d Zante asked, watching the father\u2019s eyes, because eyes are where homes speak when they think they are being polite.\n\n\u201cAir conditioning,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd because the woman at the desk told her she had the best questions. Didn\u2019t answer them. Just told her the questions were heavy in a good way.\u201d He breathed out and his breath stumbled on a word that wouldn\u2019t form. \u201cWe were there that night, before the fair. Not long. She wanted to show me how the printer makes everything smell hot.\u201d\n\nThe library held onto cool like a principle. The reference desk woman wore her hair in a bun that had graduated from experiments to policy. She remembered Zante by name because people in this city remembered in a way that felt like a habit you could lean against. \u201cI know you\u2019ll ask what I saw,\u201d she said, and then paused to slide a returned book under the scanner like a priest laying a wafer on a tongue. \u201cI saw mouths. Or rather, I saw not seeing mouths. People always talk with their hands when they\u2019re being quiet. When that fan of photographs was lying there, the hands in this room got loud.\u201d\n\nShe told them, and it was mostly absence. Someone had placed the lips by the stacks, someone with hands that didn\u2019t want to be careful and tried to be anyway. She had put them in a folder because that felt less like touching and more like respect. A girl with a gap in her teeth had laughed when she saw the pictures because losing a tooth is the only time that the body\u2019s losses look like wins. A woman with purple on her mouth the color of night flowers had leaned too close to the prints, left a smudge that refused to be only ink. \u201cWe don\u2019t get a lot of lipstick here,\u201d the reference woman said with quiet scorn. \u201cMouths here are mostly practical.\u201d\n\n\u201cNight flowers,\u201d Zante repeated. The phrase fit the color she had found on the sink. She asked for camera feeds she knew wouldn\u2019t exist in any way that would help. The library has cameras the way museums have cameras: to prove they cared after the fact and to offer grainy ghosts that cannot be forced to testify. She watched Maybelle and her father move through a frame like a lesson in how to be small and still be the center of something. She watched a woman with a wide forehead pass behind them, caught for a second and then gone. She watched herself watch and felt the day shift again, slow and mean as molasses.\n\nIn the afternoon, the press conference tasted like pennies. Boone stood and said the words that would stop other words from eating him alive. \u201cWe have a person of interest,\u201d he said, because that phrase allows everyone to hate without a name tag. \u201cWe are pursuing all leads.\u201d \u201cWe ask the public to refrain from speculation,\u201d he said, which is like asking rain to refrain from wetness. He did not say Abigail\u2019s name, and the name got said anyway. It threaded through the crowd, softened, sharpened, lifted like a kite, got stuck in a tree.\n\nAfter, in a corner where the paint had decided to peel, Zante stood with a woman whose child had been found once, a different year, a different park. \u201cThey made this city a monster,\u201d the woman said, and then caught herself and said, \u201cNo, that\u2019s wrong. The city has a monster. That\u2019s the way to give the sidewalks a chance.\u201d She squeezed Zante\u2019s arm and left, walking with the stride of someone who refuses to be late for anything anymore.\n\nThe lawyer arrived with a briefcase nothing important would fit into and a voice that had learned how to sound like a fence. Abigail met him with relief and annoyance. \u201cYou\u2019ll tell me not to tell them everything,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019ll hide me in words like possibly and allegedly until I can\u2019t find my own hands.\u201d He raised an eyebrow, and it was a better answer than a rebuke. Abby listened with her shoulders but not with her eyes.\n\nWhen they sat again, the room hummed with the kind of quiet that checks wristwatches. The lawyer said no questions about the child and Abigail said I will answer anything that is a sentence I have written. Boone nodded as if that were reasonable and then asked three unreasonable questions, because that\u2019s the way they teach you. The last one made something in Abigail flinch like a deer remembering the geometry of a road.\n\n\u201cWho else has a key to your studio?\u201d he said. \u201cWho else has been in and out this past week?\u201d\n\n\u201cLots of people were there,\u201d she said. \u201cOpening.\u201d She counted on her fingers without looking. \u201cConstance with the red scarf and the opinions. The student who told me I had too much ego and then bought a print. The man who said his wife wouldn\u2019t let him hang my work in their house but he could hide it in his office. The night flowers woman. She said she cared about mouths because her lips were the only part of her face she could afford to change.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe night flowers woman,\u201d Zante said softly, because the word had sat too comfortably in the slot. \u201cPurple lipstick. Did you know her name?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe told me three different ones and I liked all of them,\u201d Abigail said. \u201cShe said lies have the best phonetics.\u201d\n\nAfterward, in the hallway where the air struggled to be neutral, Boone pulled Zante aside. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to be able to hold her on anything very useful,\u201d he said, and the word useful felt ugly even in a place that turned ugliness into procedure. \u201cWe can get her for theater. We can\u2019t get her for the child. If she\u2019s not where the child is, keeping her here leaves us with our hands around a ladder while the fire climbs.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet her go,\u201d Zante said, and she didn\u2019t know whether she was speaking as a vicar or a detective or a wife or a selfish human who wanted to not have her home emptied of a shape. \u201cFollow her with every shadow we can afford. And take me with you when you go small. Big has wasted us.\u201d\n\nThey went small. They went to the fairground lot again, not to step in the long ovals, but to put their faces close to gum and bolts and the way gravel remembers. They talked to teenagers who had learned how to withhold because adults treat their rooms as crime scenes. They talked to the kettle-corn boy who gestured with a scoop like a conductor forced to use a ladle. He said he saw a woman that night who wasn\u2019t tall enough to be a giant and wasn\u2019t trying. She wore a denim jacket in heat that had no business tolerating denim, and she spoke to children in a voice that made the word buddy sound like a contract. She had nails painted a flat pink that made Zante think of erasers.\n\n\u201cCould you smell anything?\u201d Zante asked, expecting the answer no, because smell is the first sense that gives up when faced with popcorn. But the boy, surprised by his own yes, said that the woman smelled like eucalyptus and something else he couldn\u2019t name until he blurted \u201ccoins.\u201d Zante felt the shape of that in her ribs, a memory of walking toward a subway once in a city where the air tastes like pennies and rain. Eucalyptus and coins. Mouthwash and blood wouldn\u2019t be too dramatic if you stretched. She put the picture in a book in her head that she keeps by feeling.\n\nThey knocked at a door two blocks from the library where a woman with night flowers on her mouth would have liked the rent if you believed in stories that tidy. The woman who answered wore chapstick and a stare that had no patience for metaphor. She was not the person they were looking for. But she knew someone who loved purple without irony and she wrote a name on a receipt and the name was the kind that shows up in friends lists like a thorn. Constance with the red scarf, who had argued with Abigail at openings and then moved into her light like a plant.\n\nConstance\u2019s apartment was full of books that had decided to live in stacks instead of shelves. She opened the door with the irritated kindness of someone interrupted in the middle of a page and therefore in the middle of a life. She admitted to loving lipstick. She admitted to hating that love mattered. She denied moving flip-flops. She said that if she were the kind of person to take a child she would take one from another city because she hated hurting her own reflection. It was a terrible joke and the kind that signals a person who uses humor like bleach. Zante watched her hands. She didn\u2019t see the telltale paint in the cuticles. She saw something else: the nervous habit of touching a front tooth with the tip of the tongue, as if checking for a hole that had never existed.\n\nWhen Abigail returned to the house\u2014released on a cloud of conditions that sounded less like mercy than like homework\u2014she paused on the threshold the way a person does when a familiar room has been repainted in their absence. Zante stood at the table with her notebooks open as if she had never left them. They looked as if they had been accused. The bowl of cherries had gone sad. Abigail\u2019s shoulders were high enough that her ears could rest on them if they wanted.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to watch me,\u201d she said, and her mouth shaped the word watch like a child shaping the word monster after checking under the bed and finding an old shoe. \u201cAre you going to watch me?\u201d\n\n\u201cI watched you before,\u201d Zante said. \u201cWatching is what I call love when I\u2019m feeling noble.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou could have left the collar on when you came to the hall,\u201d Abigail said, pretending to be casual and failing in a way that made the truth more handsome. \u201cMight have made you immune to seeing me the way they want you to.\u201d\n\n\u201cI took it off so I wouldn\u2019t use it as a shield,\u201d Zante said. \u201cI don\u2019t believe in shields unless they are made of quieter things. Like bread.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey went to see Maybelle\u2019s father,\u201d Abigail said. She was very bad at hiding that she knew. Some part of her had always studied networks like other people study weather. \u201cDid he bake for them?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe let us into his house,\u201d Zante said. \u201cHe let us into the room where the whale poster is. He has the good kind of patience.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t take her,\u201d Abigail said, and this time there was no theater in it. It arrived in the room with its shoes untied and its hair sticking up and asked for toast. \u201cI wanted to be taller than I was and I took that where it could be applauded. I left props. I hated how the town talked like a chorus that never learned the melody. But my hands are not where that girl is.\u201d\n\nZante believed her the way you believe a sky: not because you are an expert on atmospheres but because you have spent enough time under one to recognize the difference between a threat and a promise. It wasn\u2019t exoneration. It was weather for one day. She crossed to Abigail and put a hand on her cheek and felt a faint grain, as if a fine sand had blown in off a beach that had no business being this far inland. Makeup, cheap powder, too pale, somebody else\u2019s face rehearsed on hers.\n\n\u201cWho touched you?\u201d she asked, and in another room in another decade that question would have been different.\n\n\u201cEveryone likes to touch a photograph,\u201d Abigail said. \u201cLast night they touched me instead. It made me feel like a stair.\u201d Her laugh was small and unconvincing. \u201cOne woman told me her mother used to press her mouth to the bathroom mirror so hard it squeaked. I don\u2019t know what that means, but I can\u2019t stop thinking it.\u201d\n\nThey slept badly. Zante woke at three to a siren in the distance that meant nothing she could fix. She padded to the window and watched the square of yard that had not decided between being grass and being sand. Under the streetlight\u2019s unkindness, a cat considered its body an adequate argument. Zante thought of jealousy and breath and how people make vows with mouths and then use them to invent emergencies. She thought of the park bench and the knot in the wood and the idea of a woman who would put on a denim jacket in August out of habit, the way you wear an old sorrow because it fits.\n\nIn the morning, the message on her phone was from the person you want messages from and dread anyway. Lyle: We ran the paint. It\u2019s theater paint. The kind the university buys by the gallon. We also found fibers on the flip-flops. Carpet, synthetic, low-pile, the color of dust. Not from a house I\u2019d like to live in.\n\nCampus connected the dots if you looked at it with the kind of eyes that had been trained to connect dots even when dots refused. Constance taught two adjunct classes there when the department remembered to send emails. The man with the stilt rentals had once sent flyers for a circus workshop that no one attended because it was held at noon on a Wednesday. The library\u2019s purple-lip woman had a student ID with a name that no longer matched her face and she had taken out books about stagecraft and about reptiles because every person\u2019s curiosity is more interesting than their guilt.\n\nThey went to the theater building and walked past set pieces that look handsome only under light that no one brought. The shop smelled like sawdust and paint and the kind of ambition that never makes it to a marquee. A student with a ponytail that looked like a rope pointed them to a shelf where open gallons allowed their skins to form. The purple was there. A list on the wall in dry erase marker said: Please, for the love of god, relid your paint. A person named JESS had drawn a flower in the corner and the flower looked tired of being petals.\n\n\u201cDo you know a woman who wears denim in August?\u201d Zante asked the rope-ponytail, and the girl smiled because that is not a useful question and yet it is, sometimes. \u201cSandra,\u201d she said, and pointed with her chin. \u201cCostumes. She\u2019s got opinions about temperature and hasn\u2019t lost to it yet.\u201d Sandra had opinions about everything, including who should be allowed to borrow shoes. She had a line of cheap flip-flops under a table, sizes for quick panic fixes onstage. One pair was blue with a cartoon fish, but not the same as Maybelle\u2019s; the fish\u2019s eye was lazy where the fair pair had been alert. \u201cWe get donations,\u201d Sandra said. \u201cPeople bring us their castoffs and blessedly have no idea what actors will do to them.\u201d\n\nIn the costume office, a cup sat abandoned that had the ghost of eucalyptus across its rim. The smell of coins was less polite. A roll of Velcro lay open on the table, its hooks mean and wanting fabric. Zante stood still long enough to feel the building admit it knew the rumors and that rumors are a kind of lighting cue. Boone lifted the roll, set it down, lifted it again because his hand needed to move because his heart was deciding whether to run.\n\n\u201cSmall,\u201d Zante said, and he nodded and went to find Sandra, who turned out to wear denim in defiance and also because her office has air-conditioning issues that no one in Facilities has bothered to fix since 2009. She had the purple on her mouth, yes, but it was the wrong purple, a berry, a forgiveness. She had a smile that looked like she had forgotten to be careful with it.\n\n\u201cChildren?\u201d she said, when they asked their too-careful questions, and her face rearranged itself into something older and knotted. \u201cNo. God, no. I sew for middle-school matinees. I know their noise. I am ruined for evil.\u201d Zante believed her and collected a thread from her cuff anyway because belief is not the same as proof and because sometimes it\u2019s good to have a cup you won\u2019t drink from.\n\nThat afternoon, the river of whispers funnelled through the church regardless of whether the doors were open. People came in and offered Zante casseroles made of beige and their opinions made of bolder colors. Somebody asked whether she would still counsel couples given the circumstances. Somebody else offered to pray for her in a tone that suggested prayer as a weapon. She stood long enough that the skin between her toes remembered sandals as instruments of patience. When the building was as empty as it could manage, she went to the hall and looked at Abigail\u2019s portraits. Mouths, yes. Lines at the edge where words have worn at the skin like tide. A child\u2019s mouth dressed in careful chapstick because a parent had decided that stage had rules.\n\nUnder one frame was a card that had fallen, or been placed. It was not Abigail\u2019s handwriting. The loop was closed where Abigail\u2019s would have risked an opening. The card read: We take from where the talk is. If you want quiet, teach your town to swallow. It was ugly and it was the most honest thing Zante had read all day. She pocketed it not because it was evidence yet, but because it was a map.\n\nThat evening, when the sky had stopped pretending blue and admitted to bruise, Zante sat at the small table and lined up the small things. The paint. The knot in the wood. The smell of eucalyptus and coins. The denim jacket in August, a detail stupid enough to be a signature. The mouths. The way Abigail made big as a form of self-defense and someone else used big as camouflage. The idea that jealousy is not the sin here but hunger is, and that hunger will dress itself in whatever will get it fed.\n\nAbigail came in late again, slower than her usual late. She had been followed by a car that did not signal turns and then did, as if confused by its own choices. She put her keys in a bowl as if putting keys in a bowl could be an apology. She watched Zante watching the table and smiled with a mouth that had practiced bravery and found it heavy to hold.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re putting it together,\u201d she said, and the admission was a blessing or a curse.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m making a small story,\u201d Zante said. \u201cThe kind that can go to the door and ask to be let in.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd if the door doesn\u2019t open?\u201d\n\n\u201cI will learn its hinge by heart,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd then I will choose whether to pick the lock or ask the carpenter to come preach to it.\u201d\n\nAbigail crossed the room to the sink and ran the tap too long and then turned it off like renunciation. She was shivering in a way that wasn\u2019t theatrical. \u201cI wished for a giant so that people would look up and find their own height,\u201d she said. \u201cI forgot that looking up is a way to avoid looking down.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe all forget that,\u201d Zante said. \u201cWhich is why pulpits have steps.\u201d\n\nThey sat in the dark awhile without making a metaphor of it. The house breathed around them, the polite exhale of an air conditioner trying to keep up. Outside, a boy on a bike sang too fast for lyrics to take hold. The night was not a villain. It was a stage. And somewhere, a child with a gap where a tooth should be had been taught patience so well she might be using it against herself. Zante closed her eyes and counted the steps to the park bench and back, as if faith were a pedometer that could award her points for distance.\n\nThe next morning, Boone called before the light rose to say that a maintenance worker at the boardwalk had found something that wasn\u2019t trash pretending to be trash. In the weeds by the last post, tucked where sprinklers would wet but not wash, a foam cooler sat as if it had learned the trick of stillness. Inside, two cans of off-brand soda, a stack of napkins with a taco truck\u2019s logo, a little animal keychain you buy with tickets and regret. A smell that made the worker step back and then lean forward again because the body needs proof. The smell of eucalyptus, heavy and cheap and angry about being found.\n\nZante dressed like a person going to a trial she believed in. She put on the collar because sometimes you wear a sign to remind yourself before it reminds anyone else. She tucked her pencil behind her ear because she trusted it to say no when her mouth had not learned how. At the boardwalk she crouched and asked the cooler to be honest. It wasn\u2019t blood. It wasn\u2019t even frightening in a way that would satisfy a headline. It was a kit for pretending to be someone a child will follow. She felt something in her chest that had been pretending to be a stone admit it had been an egg all along.\n\n\u201cThere,\u201d Lyle said, pointing with the kind of reverence he reserves for clues that don\u2019t mind being touched. A hair caught under the cooler\u2019s handle tape, pale, blunt at the end, cut by a cheap pair of scissors. They would send it for the kind of test people trust too much. They would get a color and a shape and maybe a name. Or they would get noise. It didn\u2019t matter yet. What mattered was the map the small things made and the way it pointed not to giants, but to hands.\n\nZante stood and looked out at the water and made herself count fish she could not see. She thought of a woman in a denim jacket and the sound the word buddy makes when you sand it wrong. She thought of a building where the air conditioner still owed favors to 2009. She thought of mouths and the way they promise us and betray us in the same sugar breath. She thought of love and its lousy timing and its excellent precision when it wants to break you kindly. She thought: small. She thought: hinge. She thought: I am coming, Maybelle, with a pocket full of tiny tools and a mouth that knows how to keep a vow in pieces until it\u2019s safe to be whole.",

                              "content": "Chapter Five\n\nThe cooler made a kind of sense once they laid its guts out on the bench and called each thing by its name. The sodas were a brand that pretended to be famous if you squinted at the font\u2014NovaFizz, citrus and cola, the bargain store\u2019s way of being generous. The napkins were from El Rey, the taco truck that parked by different waters on different nights, its crowned avocado logo smug in a way Zante almost admired. The keychain was a neon cat with a bell that would make adults twitch and children smile as if they were hearing destiny in cheap metal. The tape had caught that pale hair under its fold, the blunt end announcing scissors rather than a bathroom drain. The smell of eucalyptus was the loudest thing, shouting in a register usually reserved for dental waiting rooms, and under it was the heavier breath of coins, that copper insistence that the world keeps score.\n\n\u201cSmall hinges,\u201d Zante said more to the air than to Boone. \u201cThis is a door with a lot of them.\u201d He nodded in a way that meant he would hold one end if she would hold the other. Lyle bagged the bell, the napkins, the hair, doing that neat-handed routine that made him look like he was folding a shirt he was going to give to someone he loved.\n\nEl Rey set up on the cul-de-sac by the park on Tuesdays and then moved along the lakeshore on Thursdays where joggers pretended tacos were a recovery food. The owner had a towel over one shoulder and the posture of a man who had invented his own rhythm and would not submit to anyone else\u2019s. He remembered the denim jacket because it made him angry at the heat on principle, and he remembered the mouth because of the purple, the kind of color that warns you toward and away at the same time. \u201cShe wanted extra napkins like she was planning to be generous with condiments,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd she smelled like my dentist but cheaper. She asked directions to Neptune\u2019s, the little arcade by the laundromat. I told her the laundromat is better than the arcade because at least the laundromat gets you somewhere.\u201d\n\nThe laundromat had windows that sweated from the inside no matter what the season decided. Neptune\u2019s had carpet that tried to be an underwater scene and failed, the low-pile dust-gray ocean printed with fluorescent fish that had gone tired from pretending to swim. The redemption counter\u2019s bell was the same bell on the neon cat, and the girl behind it\u2014AMBER in a name sticker that had done a tour of duty on at least two shirts\u2014pushed her hair behind her ear with fingers that had learned to count tickets faster than anyone expected. She had eucalyptus breath mints in a fishbowl because she was trying to quit gum and respected the sanctity of the carpet. She had a denim jacket on a hook because the air conditioner was schizophrenic and liked to freeze shoulders.\n\n\u201cYou sell those cats?\u201d Boone asked, pointing to the neon herd staring at them with optimism. Amber nodded and flirted her eyes toward the chart that translated tickets into prizes and promises. Zante let the hum of the place file away the noise in her head. Kids shouted at screens and learned early about machines that almost give you what you want. In the back, a door held a strip of light the way a mouth holds a breath. There was a smell from behind it that belonged to a break room that pretended to be a living room and couldn\u2019t afford it: coffee that forgot itself, eucalyptus, a carpet that resigned itself to footprints. The manager was a man whose T-shirt had lost its battle with a logo long ago. He did not want them to look because managers of small empires never want anyone to look. Amber wanted them to look because truth makes teenagers generous sometimes.\n\n\u201cJess worked last night,\u201d Amber said, when they had spoken about nothing for long enough to qualify as polite. \u201cShe thinks a jacket makes an outfit, so she\u2019ll wear it even if it\u2019s a hundred degrees. Purple lipstick because she says if you\u2019re going to be an extra you might as well do it right. She does theater at the college. She makes tall things out of short things and gets mad if anyone notices. She walks in here with a pocket full of quarters like a magician no one hired.\u201d\n\n\u201cJess,\u201d Zante said, letting the name sit on her tongue long enough to match it to the dry-erase flower the paint room had grown. \u201cDoes Jess have more name than that?\u201d Amber half-smiled, because this was a city that likes to give you the first name and make you earn the rest. \u201cJessamine on her direct deposit. Her email\u2019s got a number and a curse word in it. She says names are mouth-choreography anyway.\u201d The manager muttered that they shouldn\u2019t be talking names with police and Zante said she appreciated his concern and Amber rolled her eyes in a way that means here, take this, we live because we give each other small rebellions.\n\nThe locker smelled like eucalyptus the way a glove remembers a hand. Inside, a tube of lipstick called Night Shade 17 had split its black casing and left a smear like a bruise rehearsing. There was a little bottle of mouthwash with leaves on the label advertising eucalyptus as a virtue rather than a sin. The denim jacket had one of those enamel pins on the collar, a whale with lines on its belly like a music staff, and the pin made Zante\u2019s skin say, whale poster, whale in a girl\u2019s room, whales in the ocean of a carpet. She could have built a church on how the world likes to place echoes where we can trip on them.\n\n\u201cShe crash at the Lakeway?\u201d Amber offered, without being asked, because gossip is a public service if you aim it right. \u201cHalf the adjuncts and half the kids do when their air goes out. Cheap rooms and a pool that no one pretends to use. The manager makes you pay in cash if your ID looks like it has regrets.\u201d Boone didn\u2019t like a teenager knowing what he hadn\u2019t asked yet, and he liked it enough to write it down without letting his hand show its relief. The neon cat on the counter winked because its wire had come loose. Or because the city, for once, was helping itself.\n\nLakeway Lodge had a sign that believed in cursive long after everyone else had defected to block letters. A plastic banner under the main sign promised weekly rates and cable as if cable were still a promise. The carpet in the lobby was the color of dust. The desk clerk had the plum-colored nails of a person who funds three older sisters\u2019 beauty habits and one younger brother\u2019s phone bill. She looked at Zante\u2019s collar and decided to treat her as a representative of a trust she had never bought into but liked to try on.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re here to save somebody, I\u2019ll try to speed you,\u201d she said, which was the most honest customer service line Zante had heard in a year. \u201cJess is in 213, sometimes, when 117 is taken. She pays with quarters when her cards pretend to be shy. She is polite in the way that keeps you from kicking her out but not polite enough to make you write home about it. Are we going to do a television version of events, or are we going to knock like neighbors?\u201d\n\n\u201cNeighbors first,\u201d Zante said. They took the outside stairs carefully, because stairs at places like this dislike drama and announce it with their creak. The sun had convinced the railing to burn what touched it, so Zante held her palms up like a supplicant caught in a lesson. A child in the pool counted the tiles like rosary beads and ignored a sign that told him not to play with divinity. Boone posted Lyle at the bottom of the stairs because someone had to be the person who turns a corner into a perimeter.\n\nThey knocked on 213 with the patience a hinge understands. The chain was on because this was a city where habits were a form of superstition. The denim jacket hung over the back of a chair, and the jacket told more truth than the room knew it was keeping. The purple on the edge of the cheap bathroom mirror shouted from under the polite fluorescent. The eucalyptus announced itself like a sermon you hadn\u2019t wanted to attend but found yourself humming afterward. A voice from inside said \u201cJust a second,\u201d and then again with a different vowel because the first second had not agreed.\n\n\u201cJessamine,\u201d Zante said through the gap, not a question and not a command. \u201cI\u2019m Zante. I\u2019m the vicar, and I\u2019m the other thing, and I\u2019m the person who knows the color of your mouth from two different buildings.\u201d There was a pause that had the shape of a swallow. The chain slid back. The door opened to the width of a palm. Jess had the kind of face that makes you think of stories you were told when you were little about people who live in towers against their will and their better judgment. Purple on her mouth but botched on the left where she had been interrupted. Denim, yes, but short sleeves today, stubbornness compromised by temperature.\n\n\u201cI never took your wife\u2019s prints,\u201d Jess said first, which was the kind of defensive that announces itself as strategy more than honesty. \u201cShe photographs mouths like a thief. I steal, but not the way she does.\u201d She stepped back from the door and the room opened in that motel way, a small stage given a single set. The bed had the posture of a thing that had been sat on by a decision. On the side farthest from the window, a child sat cross-legged with more dignity than the bedding deserved. She had a gap where a tooth should be and she was working a knot out of a piece of Velcro as if the world depended on neatness. She looked at Zante with that solemn friendliness children are born with until we train it out of them. She said, \u201cAre you the one with the whale songs?\u201d and relief tried to detonate in Zante\u2019s chest and she held it with both hands.\n\n\u201cHi, Maybelle,\u201d Zante said, making her voice walk slowly as if it were stepping through long grass. \u201cI\u2019m Zante. I brought no whales but I have a friend who is better than whales at getting you a donut later. We are going to take a walk. Does that suit you?\u201d Maybelle nodded because being asked is a kindness children notice even when they are practicing patience as a weapon. She had a keychain looped twice around her finger, the neon cat trying to be brave with her.\n\nJess had the wrong kind of shoulders for a villain. They were the shoulders of a slender animal that would prefer to bolt but had learned to stand very still and hope the world can\u2019t count. \u201cI was returning her,\u201d she said to Boone, who had remained in the hallway but had widened the door the way cops widen doors when they want to fit in the law without scaring the paint. \u201cI was going to leave her at the bench again with the little sodas that look like they come from a party and the napkins because children spill and the keychain because children like bells. She wasn\u2019t scared. She\u2019s a serious person. We talked about how paper has a smell.\u201d She swallowed and her throat moved like it was being taught something it didn\u2019t want to learn. \u201cYou leave your phones everywhere and I can see the shape of your voices without hearing them. I wanted a room where there were only two voices and they belonged to faces I could keep in my eyes.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou took her,\u201d Boone said, gentle as a man can be when the sentence he is obligated to deliver tastes like acid. \u201cYou took her from a fair and from a father and you let the city chew itself to keep your mouth busy. That\u2019s not returning.\u201d\n\nJess had the dignity to accept the word took as the word it was. \u201cI made big because nobody listens to small,\u201d she said, and the purple on her mouth sudden looked like a bruise she had chosen, and then regretted. \u201cIt worked as a trick and failed as a life. I didn\u2019t hurt her. I don\u2019t hurt small things. I just wanted the quiet you get when a child decides you aren\u2019t going to fail them for five minutes.\u201d She looked at Zante, not as a supplicant would look at a priest, but as one performance would look at another across a stage. \u201cYour wife\u2019s mouths make people feel seen, but only if they give her their money. I wanted to make a seeing that didn\u2019t need a credit card.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is a father who would sell the sun to get five minutes back from you,\u201d Zante said, not unkindly and not like a sermon. \u201cYou wanted a vow to stand still. You used another human to make it. You can\u2019t build a quiet room out of someone else\u2019s breath.\u201d\n\nMaybelle slid off the bed and came to stand with a deliberateness that put her in a different category of human than the adults were managing. She took Zante\u2019s hand like a person signs a document\u2014carefully, with intention, without flinch. \u201cMy dad says not to go with anyone who says buddy,\u201d she said. \u201cShe didn\u2019t say buddy. She said helper. Helpers are tricky.\u201d She announced this as if she were a judge delivering precedent. Zante could have fallen in love with that sentence the way you fall in love with a window on a day when the light is doing what it remembers.\n\nBoone radioed, used codes that make emotions sound tidy, and the room held its breath around the words. Lyle\u2019s face arrived in the doorway like an apology because somebody had to be that today. Jess sat down without being told, as if her bones had been waiting for permission to remember that we invented furniture for a reason. She put her hands flat on her knees. The purple on her lips looked shaky close up, as if the hand that drew it had been more faithful to thought than to mirror.\n\nThe walk down the stairs was a procession that refused myth. Maybelle counted again because counting is how we make ourselves a bridge when the river is rude. The man at the pool said, \u201cHey, little buddy,\u201d and then blushed and looked at his feet as if language had tripped him. A woman watering a plant too thirsty for its pot called to them that she had been praying all week without specifying to whom, and Zante nodded because faith makes more sense on stairwells than anywhere else. In the parking lot the air did that thing it does in Florida where it tries to convince you it is a substance more than a condition. The sky was the insistent blank of a hospital wall.\n\nBoone\u2019s patrol car had the good sense to be itself. He opened the back door and then closed it again because Maybelle didn\u2019t like the look of a cage even when it wore seatbelts. He put her in the front with Zante and gave her the radio microphone to hold because trust is a thing we can put in hands and have it work. Jess went in the back, and even then she looked less like a captured thing than like someone who had finally allowed gravity to speak. Amber would find out because a city is a room with a thousand ears, and she would sit on the counter and tell someone all about how the police were nicer than television and worse than a song, and someone would make the story about sirens and someone would make it about a vicar and someone would file it in their chest as a reason to be kinder to people in denim whether the day was hot or not.\n\nAt the station, the rooms performed their roles again. Jess admitted to painting ovals because she liked choreography. She admitted to borrowing flip-flops because they looked lonely in a photograph and she was sentimental in exactly the wrong places. She admitted to meeting Maybelle at the knot in the wood and saying helper and not buddy because she had been a child once too and had learned the scripts. She did not admit to malice. The law does not know what to do with hunger that does its worst damage by pretending it isn\u2019t hungry. A lawyer would arrive, and the lawyer would wear a suit that made Jess look like something that had shrunk in the wash.\n\nZante took Maybelle home because there are tasks you do with your own hands or you don\u2019t ask somebody else to be the city you want to live in. The baker father opened the door and did the automatic things your body does when your life returns: he exhaled something older than words, he reached, he checked for all the old evidence of a child, the weight, the heat, the readiness to forgive. He said thank you to everyone and it sounded like a bakery could sound if gratitude rose like bread. He looked at Zante and found in her face the answer to a question he had not been brave enough to ask himself about God and police and whether either could be forgiven for being useful so slowly.\n\nThey left them against the whale poster, the rib lines like staff lines a song had finally decided to read. Maybelle held up the neon cat and the bell made a noise you would forgive in any house. She showed her father the knot in the Velcro and he listened like a man who had learned what listening buys you.\n\nOn the way back, Boone drove without needing the road to remind him how. He was making and unmaking an expression that had been practicing on him in the rearview mirror for years. \u201cYou going to tell the city your giant is a small person with purple lipstick and a jacket habit?\u201d he asked. He didn\u2019t say Abigail\u2019s name. He didn\u2019t say it because he is a man who loves to not step where the ice sounds thin. Zante looked at the way the sunlight made designs on the dashboard that no one would claim credit for, and she decided to practice her own honesty where it was cheapest.\n\n\u201cWe built the giant,\u201d she said. \u201cMy wife built a piece of her. Jess stood on it because the view is better from up there. If we tell a big story today, it should be that we stopped to count napkins.\u201d Boone grunted and let himself, just for a stretch of road, like the way that sounded. Then he returned to the business of inventorying which words he would have to let reporters steal and which he could keep until they needed to be old news.\n\nAbigail was awake at the table when Zante walked in, as if the house had written a play and assigned them their marks. She had two cups in front of her and both had water in them that had quit sweating once the kitchen decided that humidity was an attitude and not a law. Her face was bare of purple. Her mouth looked like itself, not holy and not guilty, just an instrument that had to be tuned daily. She watched Zante the way divers watch weather, and she stood when Zante did because wives have choreography too.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s alive?\u201d Abigail asked, and Zante nodded because she could give that much without scuffing anything. \u201cAnd the person is not me?\u201d Abigail tried for lightness and tripped, then steadied because the body remembers how to walk even when the mind is inventing ice.\n\n\u201cHer name is Jessamine,\u201d Zante said. \u201cShe uses paint and Velcro and props. She likes to make tall things out of short things. She borrowed the city\u2019s patience and it didn\u2019t belong to her. She wanted quiet and she took it the way people take anything in this century\u2014publicly enough to be myth, privately enough to be a sin that only shows its ankles.\u201d Zante sat, then stood again, because sitting made the words perform and she wanted them to pray. \u201cYou did not take that child.\u201d She watched Abigail\u2019s face absorb the statement with more caution than joy. \u201cYou did make the room where the word giant could sleep.\u201d\n\nAbigail flinched and then rearranged the flinch into something that looked like an intellectual shrug. \u201cIf I had built a smaller room,\u201d she said, \u201csomeone would have broken it to make it larger. That\u2019s what this town does with art.\u201d She smiled a little and the smile failed, and she let it fail in the way only brave people let expressions fail. \u201cDo I get to be forgiven for wanting height?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou get to be forgiven for wanting,\u201d Zante said. \u201cWe will have a longer argument about what you did when your mouth wanted and your hands joined in. I will make you angry by bringing bread to that argument and you will make me angrier by being interesting. Today, I am going to eat something red and sweet that is not a metaphor, and I am going to say that I am tired of hunger making us invent giants.\u201d She reached for a cherry, found one that had resisted the house air, and bit it with the clean emotion of an animal and not a priest.\n\nThe city decided to be many cities about it, as cities do. Some mornings radio hosts said the word cult and meant church and artist and fan and all the other congregations that give people reasons to leave their houses. Some afternoons a woman standing in the produce aisle would look at a purple eggplant and feel disloyal to lipsticks she had loved. At the library, the reference woman polished the spot on the desk where the fan of photographs had once lay and she did it like penance, the kind that makes you feel useful and therefore less guilty for being complicit in a rumor. At the arcade, Amber put the neon cats on a high shelf for a week as if putting an object up where children couldn\u2019t reach would teach adults any lesson. At church, a child wrote a thank-you with more consonants than necessary, and at the bottom of the letter drew a mouth and labeled it MY PROMISER, and Zante put it on the refrigerator as if paper could make cold useful.\n\nThere were still interviews in rooms where light has ambitions. There were still forms to pound with pens that have learned to be patient. There was a court date in a month and then another in a season, because justice believes in time as if time were a reliable actor. Abigail had images to take down from the fellowship hall walls before someone decided to be brave and ask her to. She took them down herself, and she packed them as if wrapping were a prayer. She left one up by accident or design: a small mouth saying a letter b, the shape more promise than sound. Zante left it because when she took it down at home later, alone, it made a noise that felt like the right kind of loss.\n\nOn Thursday, the university sent an email reminding people not to take supplies off campus and also reminding them about a lecture on Ethics in Public Art scheduled before the budget would cut such things. Constance with the red scarf came to church without a scarf and without a desire to be seen, and she lit a candle with a force that said she was ashamed of having wanted the gossip to keep being interesting. Sandra in costumes fixed the air conditioner in a way the Facilities men had never thought to try and didn\u2019t tell anyone until it started working. Jess\u2019s lawyer filed motions that saved no one and did not intend to.\n\nAt the baker\u2019s shop, a sign went up that said CLOSED FOR A DAY. Under it, in handwriting that had decided to be consistent for an hour, another line: THANK YOU. WE WILL BE BACK WITH HONEY BREAD AND PATIENCE. People read it and felt like they had been given a recipe without measurements, and some of them went home and made a mess that tasted good anyway.\n\nBy Sunday, Zante had a sermon and the sermon did not contain the word giant. It did not contain the word envy though she tasted it as she practiced. It had story in it because all the true things do. It had the line about fences and colors because there are jokes you can run like a thread through a cloth when the pattern threatens to forget itself. It had the sentence she had been saving without knowing she had been saving it: \u201cThe devil doesn\u2019t need to be big when our hunger is obedient.\u201d She underlined obedient in her notes and then erased the underline because underlines make text look like it owes a debt.\n\nAbigail sat in the front pew as if she had never been anywhere else and made herself a place in the room with her shoulders down and her mouth unpainted. She had learned how to smile without using it as a coin. When the peace passed like a contagion, she took people\u2019s hands and not their eyes. After, she poured coffee and did not give anyone the gift of absolving her early. People came and told Zante small truths: I said buddy yesterday to a child and heard myself; I threw away my purple and felt vain; my husband wants to know if you can bless a boat; my sister asked if God is a rumor and I said only on days when people need him to be. Zante listened until listening made a shape big enough to step into, and then she stepped into it and found that the room inside fit.\n\nIn the afternoon, when the heat had remembered to be brief, she walked down to the boardwalk. The knot that had caught a flip-flop strap was still smug in the wood. Someone had sanded it finally, late, like people do the right thing when the story includes a bench because benches remind us of saying yes to sitting. She stood very still and counted the steps a child would take from here to the end where the water looked like it had been ironed by an aunt. She thought of Jess going through her tallness like a ritual and getting tired. She thought of Abigail under glass and then not under glass and how love has never learned moderation. She thought of how mouths get all the blame for promises they did not invent.\n\nBehind her, a boy skidded on his shoes, not his socks, because his mother wasn\u2019t there and he was auditioning for autonomy. He looked up. He saw the sky for once and didn\u2019t pretend it was bigger than it was. He said to whoever was following him, \u201cWe are not small. We are just next to very big things.\u201d Zante smiled because sermons sometimes write themselves and you just have to get out of the way. She took the collar from her pocket and slid it into place and felt it click against her throat like a hinge that had remembered which door it belonged to. Then she went home, and when she opened the door, the house made the sound houses make when they are finally full enough to stop performing.",

The walls are the color of laws that looked good on paper, the benches not quite comfortable enough to tempt sleep. The ceiling lights hum in a way that tells you electricity has its own calendar. Zante sat near the back in a patch of air that forgot to move. She had taken the collar off for that morning because the room already had too many uniforms and she didn\u2019t want her white strip to become another badge in a place where everyone was inventorying symbols instead of promises. Abigail took a seat two rows ahead with a kind of practiced poise that made strangers decide she must be either blameless or very good at being not; there is a way a body holds itself that confuses the jury before any sworn word enters the room. Jessamine came in cuffed, her denim jacket folded under her arm like an argument she wasn\u2019t ready to make. She had no purple on her mouth; jailhouse mirrors are honest enough to put makeup in its correct bin: performance.\n\nThe judge was a man who looked like an old piano sounds, all felt and memory. He called the case numbers, and the syllables lined up and marched across the room with the seriousness of soldiers who suspect the war was misfiled. When the clerk asked for names, human names came back and made the air thinner. There was a line in the docket about \u201cinterference with custody,\u201d and it sounded like a term for weather, not a trespass of love and fear and loneliness dressed as civic intent. Boone sat next to a State Attorney who had to keep marking his place with his thumb because he had learned law in a room where hunger interrupted more sentences than the bell did. Maybelle\u2019s father came and stood when they asked if he had anything to say, and he did not make a speech; he said only, \u201cShe likes the way paper smells when it\u2019s warm,\u201d and the judge nodded because we are allowed, sometimes, to let small facts do the work of large speeches.\n\nJess\u2019s lawyer spoke about community ties and cars that can be found and jobs that pay by deposit on Tuesdays. He said returning over taking is a mitigating shape. He said there was no bruising, no harm, no exploitation, and the room did a collective flinch because harm has learned to dress politely in this century. He asked for a bond that would not bankrupt somebody already building a life on coupons and the library\u2019s notion of stability. The State Attorney did that reluctant shake of the head that people do when they would like to be kind but have been given a script that flattens kindness wherever it occurs. The judge set a number that would require three aunts and a co-worker and one neighbor who has always liked getting to be the neighbor in a story, and he set conditions like a parent sets table rules\u2014no giant, no props, no children not attached to you by blood or law, check in with a man whose desk is haunted by the ghost of his predecessor\u2019s coffee.\n\nZante watched Jess watch the floor. She had the look of someone who knows how to be punished but not how to be forgiven. Forgiveness requires more muscles than you expect. Abigail felt the room as a lens; she made herself small without shrinking because she had finally learned that height can be a weapon at the wrong table. When it ended, everyone stood at once because courthouses produce that reflex in bodies; people rise to cover their own discomfort. Boone touched Zante\u2019s elbow in that way he has, a question without a mark, and she gave him a nod that said later, I have to go turn my face back into a thing I can use.\n\nIn the corridor, reporters had gathered to make straw into bricks. They had learned the town\u2019s posture, the way Tallahassee leans when it is making up its mind, and they tried to mimic it the way children mimic accents they think will buy them candy. Microphones glinted like lures. The one from the station with a sunrise in its logo asked, \u201cReverend, will you be stepping down?\u201d and Zante smiled in that specific way that belongs to the guilty and the innocent both; the way that says I intend to answer a different question with the same words. She said, \u201cI will be stepping up to the pulpit on Sunday as usual,\u201d and that was the truth even if it offended the arithmetic of shame. A woman with careful hair said, \u201cDo you feel responsible for the myth?\u201d and Zante said, \u201cWe all feel responsible for the myths we feed,\u201d and watched the sentence make itself into three different headlines depending on the edit.\n\nOutside, heat arranged its chairs. The magnolias refused to perform for cameras. In the parking lot, a man with a sign that wanted to be a petition hovered, unsure whether he was here to cheer or scold. Abigail slipped through bodies the way a slim fish does, just enough motion to not be netted. When they reached the far end of the lot, the part with the tree that seems older than everyone\u2019s rage, she stopped and leaned her back against the bark like it might arrest her and was temperamentally opposed. \u201cIf I apologize,\u201d she said to Zante without looking up, \u201cwill it be heard, or will it just be another photograph of a mouth?\u201d Her hands were in her pockets, and she was terrible at pockets because she always wanted to fill them with the exact thing they were not designed to carry.\n\n\u201cYou can offer one,\u201d Zante said. \u201cYou can\u2019t decide what it becomes on the other end. That is the most annoying part of mouths.\u201d She wanted to touch her, and she wanted to put distance down between them like a placemat under a sweating glass. She did neither, because both are theater, and theater had complicated their house too much lately.\n\nThey closed the studio. Not forever, but into a posture that looked like humility from the street. They took the show down in the afternoon, when passersby were busy assigning their children summer tasks like camps and learning to be disappointed gently. Abigail wrapped prints in brown paper as if brown were a moral. She wrote titles on the back not with names this time, but with numbers, as if she could demote the mouths to inventory and therefore strip them of their power to accuse. In the quiet, the building made a sound it had not let them hear before, a small tick in the back wall where water thought about becoming a stain. \u201cI thought this room was mine,\u201d she said, lighting catching the arc of a nail. \u201cIt turns out I had left the door open and the city walked in wearing my jacket and then left without leaving a note.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou left notes,\u201d Zante said gently, thinking of the card in the church hall, the closed loop where Abigail would have made an opening. She had it in her desk with the lies people tell themselves about donations and the truth about which casserole pans belonged to which grandmothers. She did not say that she suspected that card belonged to Jess or Constance or someone in their chorus. There are some things you keep in your own pocket until the hinge lines up.\n\nThey visited Jess in the county jail because Zante still believed you go to people when their breath is borrowed by institutions and you do not wait for an appointment to make you brave. The jail air had been disinfected into a theology of surface. They sat across glass on phones that multiply pauses and make them obvious. Jess had been given a T-shirt that made everything feel temporary. She smiled when she saw Zante and frowned when she saw the look on her face that said I am undecided between absolution and the kind of love that refuses to be staff.\n\n\u201cYou made up the Killearn thing?\u201d Zante asked after the small jokes were tried on and removed for being too obvious. \u201cThe band shell Polaroids. Were they you?\u201d Jess shook her head with an impatience that suggested she would correct the whole town's footnotes if they\u2019d let her. \u201cNo. That\u2019s how I knew there was an ear for it. Someone else put the first mouths down\u2014three, then five, then the library fan, like someone testing a room\u2019s acoustics. I saw the drift and I joined it, because drift is a current you can surf if you don\u2019t mind swallowing water. I told myself it was art, and then I told myself it was a sermon, and then I told myself it was a mirror, and then I stopped telling myself anything and did the thing I\u2019m booked for.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho started,\u201d Zante said, not because she wanted a name that would let her fold the map, but because names relieve the world of having to carry too much pronoun. Jess shifted, the chain on her ankle conducting impatience the way lightning uses a tree. \u201cI don\u2019t have their face,\u201d she said. \u201cI just have the feeling of hands that don\u2019t like being seen trying to be delicate and failing. You can tell when a big person\u2019s fingers are trying to go small; they smudge corners. The backs of the first ones\u2014old stock, not college lab, a little curl like they weren\u2019t dried under anything weighted. The edges warm. Your wife\u2019s touches are respectful; the first one\u2019s weren\u2019t. She wanted to be myth but she still signed her prints. A different appetite. If I had to guess, the starter wasn\u2019t a photographer. They were a collector making a path back to a shelf they shouldn\u2019t have built.\u201d She said it with that frustrating poet\u2019s authority that turns into fog as soon as you try to pour it into a form.\n\nWhen Zante left, Boone was in the lobby rotating a paper cup between his palms like a prayer wheel he didn\u2019t believe in. \u201cWe\u2019re clearing Abigail off the heavier chatter,\u201d he said, because he had learned to deliver this kind of information directly and without salt. \u201cThe city will keep it on the grill until it\u2019s charred, but the file will sit down. Jess is going to get what the book says, minus anything the book has the decency to subtract when a child doesn\u2019t have new scars. I hate how tidy that sounds. You hear anything we can go small with?\u201d\n\n\u201cSomeone else started,\u201d Zante said. \u201cJess says the first mouths weren\u2019t hers. She may be lying. She may also be the only honest person in a week of honest types trying on lies to see if the fit flatters.\u201d\n\n\u201cSomebody brought a spoon,\u201d Boone said, remembering Jess\u2019s phrase, and the words made him shake his head like a dog who walked into the river expecting depth he didn\u2019t get. \u201cWe\u2019ll go back to Levy. We\u2019ll go back to Killearn. We\u2019ll go talk to security cameras who forgot what they were born for.\u201d\n\nThe bishop called, or rather her assistant called, and the assistant\u2019s voice had the polished courtesy of people who are constantly asked to be the throat for someone else\u2019s mind. \u201cThe bishop would like to see you,\u201d she said, and Zante could hear the capital letters in would like the way you hear a key on a ring that is not yours. The office had carpet that forgave sins both doctrinal and practical; the furniture was old in the way that asks for mercy. The bishop herself wore a linen jacket the color of cream and had the posture of a person who lifts heavy things without announcing it, and who has decided that collar and chain can talk to one another without either losing jurisdiction.\n\n\u201cYou have been asked for,\u201d she said after the tea and the polite weather. \u201cAsked for and asked about. The diocese believes in your work. The diocese is also aware that newspapers are a kind of sacrament for people who need their absolution delivered on pulp. I will not ask you to stop being what you are. I will ask you to remember that your parishioners love you best when you are at table, not on television.\u201d Zante nodded because this was the shape of the truth and because she loved the bishop for calling television the thing her generation calls it, like the set is still furniture and not a pocket. \u201cAnd your wife,\u201d the bishop said, with a care that meant she had practiced in her head first. \u201cHow is she?\u201d\n\n\u201cLarge,\u201d Zante said, and both of them laughed in the careful way women laugh when they have remembered all the ways the world insists on making them smaller. \u201cShe is trying to learn to be one size at a time.\u201d\n\nThat evening, rain made a decision twelve blocks north and then changed its mind before it reached them. The air remained undecided and therefore punishing. Couples came to the vicarage to talk about ceremonies and vows and whether the phrase I promise is heavier than the phrase I do. Zante made tea she never used to drink before Florida taught her that hot things have mercy when the world is humid and uninterested. She listened, and she offered words like hinges: this is how the door might move without squealing, these are the places that will need oil. When they left, she stood in the door a moment longer than necessary and watched the street like a nurse watches a sleeping patient\u2014not because she expects catastrophe, but because expecting quiet feels like hubris.\n\nAbigail found her at the sink with her sleeves rolled, that domestic pantomime that never worked on either of them as disguise because they were both too well-trained in outsized gestures to pretend to be small without being cute about it. \u201cConstance wrote me an op-ed,\u201d she said, holding up her phone like a carapace. \u201cShe called me a mouth-thief and then she praised my craft, and then she said the city had made me its scapegoat and she refused to let me be that. Then she pivoted into calling for more public funding for art and less for police and somehow she made me into both cause and cautionary tale. I should probably knit her a scarf big enough to run for office.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can thank her,\u201d Zante said. \u201cYou can also decide not to put your mouth anywhere she has laid traps.\u201d She dried her hands and noticed, not for the first time, that the towel smelled like the dryer sheet of a neighbor with opinions. You become part of a neighborhood by consenting to share the air.\n\nThey ate in the lateness, bread and sweet peppers and cheese that had forgiven the refrigerator for being inconsistent. Abigail told stories about past openings in other towns, the way audience members treat art like a blood sport, the time a woman threw wine on a canvas because she recognized her ex-husband\u2019s mouth and the artist said thank you without flinching because the stain improved his point. Zante listened and thought of other rooms, rooms with tape on the floors and a smell of felt-tip pens and shouting, rooms where suspects tell the truth in the middle of a sentence by accident and you can hear it because you have trained your ear to tilt. She told Abigail a story about London, finally, because there are histories you give as gifts to prove that a house is a house and not a storage unit.\n\n\u201cThere was a man,\u201d she said, \u201cwho carried a ladder in Shepherd\u2019s Bush and he brought it to crime scenes before the police did and placed it outside buildings and everyone would look up and look for windows and balcony doors and they would forget to look at the ground. He put height everywhere. He haunted us for six months. He didn\u2019t commit the crimes. He committed the rumor. He made us bad at small. We stopped him by giving ladders to everyone. We put three ladders at every scene and then ladders became furniture and people stopped hearing the word up. Then we found the person who was doing the harm, and he was tall, yes, but that was the least interesting thing about him. Jess reminds me of him in the way that wanting attention is a cheaper desire than wanting mercy, but both can be dressed the same.\u201d\n\nAbigail smiled over her glass. \u201cYou\u2019re going to turn into a book of sermons,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople will buy it and then not read it and then tell you they loved the chapter on envy because it made them feel seen without making them do anything.\u201d She reached across the table and took Zante\u2019s hand and, for a long breath\u2019s worth, neither of them moved it away.\n\nTwo mornings later, at Levy Park, a groundskeeper found three more photographs under a band shell seat where gum had mapped amateurs\u2019 patience. Lips again. Not Abigail\u2019s stock\u2014no signature, blank backs, edges cut with the imprecision of someone using a pair of scissors that had duty elsewhere. One mouth with a chipped incisor, not a child\u2019s, a mark of adulthood carried like a story you tell only when drunk. One glossed thick, a shine the color of cheap cherries. One bare, cracked, the kind of mouth that talks too much outdoors. And this time, under the stack, a coin taped to the wood with painter\u2019s tape, a penny face up and rubbing blue where the copper had argued with the air. Boone sent a picture. The penny looked obscenely earnest.\n\nA note with the photographs, in handwriting that was impatient and therefore beautiful: You took my tall away. I can love small, too. The letters leaned forward as if eager to be caught. Boone called before the message finished sending. \u201cWe had eyes on Jess,\u201d he said without greeting. \u201cShe didn\u2019t do it. She was with her mother giving intake forms to a clerk who wishes his job had less ink. Abigail was at home, because I know that even if you don\u2019t think I do. So unless we\u2019ve got a third in the choir who decided to start humming now that the other two have solos, this is something old asking for attention again.\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing is older than wanting to be big,\u201d Zante said. She put on her shoes without looking at them and realized in the car that she was wearing the pair with the sole that thinks gravel is a conversation. At the band shell, the morning had not warmed yet into rudeness. Children were already negotiating rights of way with scooters and chalk. The groundskeeper stood with his hands on his hips like a person who has seen too much rain and not enough roof. The photographs were where Boone had left them, in little numbered tents like campers that had pitched themselves. The penny waited to be made into a metaphor.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re daring you,\u201d Lyle said, sounding frightened and pleased, because he is still young enough to enjoy being in the presence of a good puzzle even when the puzzle punctures a child\u2019s peace in the next county. \u201cThey\u2019re saying they can do flat as well as tall.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve always been able to,\u201d Zante said quietly. \u201cTall was sound. Flat is touch.\u201d She held her breath for a second to see if she could make the world hush. The world declined her offer. She leaned on the back of the bench and felt the wood give a little the way wood does when it remembers that trees move in wind and only furniture pretends to be still.\n\nThe photographs smelled like the bottom drawer of a kitchen, where rubber bands go to make a nest. The gloss was cheap and tacky at the edges in that way that announces a printer from a drugstore. The scissor line took a hair of image off one edge. Whoever had cut them had not minded amputating that much truth. The penny tape was the same blue that had ringed the ovals at the park. The copper was rubbed, yes, but not by fingers\u2014by cloth, rough, full of grit.\n\n\u201cYou remember the coin smell,\u201d Boone said, half a question; he had trained himself to notice which metaphors stuck to Zante\u2019s thinking. \u201cFrom the taco truck. From the cooler. Whoever loves eucalyptus also loves pennies. Or thinks pennies smell like health.\u201d\n\n\u201cOr thinks the rest of us won\u2019t notice if they put two smells in the same box,\u201d she said, and then, because she can\u2019t help herself, \u201cMy father used to put a coin on the table when he wanted me to say something brave. He said if I picked it up, I had to speak. It was a little game. Something about the metal gave my mouth permission. It\u2019s stupid, and it worked.\u201d She touched the edge of the tape with a gloved knuckle and then let it go, because ritual matters even as we find it ridiculous, and because evidence is a sacristy of its own kind.\n\nThey canvassed the edges in the way that word has always sounded like a polite storm. A woman running in a shirt that told the world she was a survivor, with nothing specified, said she\u2019d seen a person sitting on the bench like a pen intent on the end of a sentence. Denim jacket again, because Tallahassee doesn\u2019t let go of its own clich\u00e9s easily. No purple this time. A hat, a flat cap like a costume designer would call a choice. Thin wrists. Long fingers that wanted to argue with tape but had learned compliance. A man unloading cases of bottled water for the community center said he\u2019d noticed the shoes\u2014white, not quite white, gray where the toes meet the idea of walking. Nobody saw the face and everybody saw the shape of the intention.\n\nBack at the church, Zante found an envelope pushed under the office door, the linen kind you save for resumes and condolences. Inside, a photograph\u2014not a mouth this time. A hinge. An old iron hinge bolted to a beam, the metal pitted and proud, the wood furred where fingers check for splinters. On the back, in that same forward-leaning hand: If you name a thing, you give it teeth. Let the door be a door. Under it, a letter A, drawn in a way that was not Abigail\u2019s. Abigail\u2019s A always left the crossbar understated, a whisper. This A had made the crossbar heavy, as if it were building scaffolding. Anonymous is a lazy god. Initials are better stories than letters. Zante sat with the hinge in her lap and stared at the window until the trees began to sway, and then she realized she had been seeing not movement but heat.\n\nShe showed the hinge to Abigail and watched her face perform a refusal. \u201cNot me,\u201d Abigail said, and she said it like a person correcting a child\u2019s manners, gentle and without permission for argument. \u201cIf I were to harass you with metaphors, I would not get the weight of the crossbar wrong.\u201d She held the card closer, and the pupils widened, the hunter\u2019s dark even inside the prey. \u201cJess?\u201d she asked, already deciding no. \u201cConstance?\u201d Maybe. \u201cSomeone who wants in on the poem.\u201d She put the card on the table like it had to rest.\n\nThey did the small responsible things while the city rehearsed larger gestures. They visited the Jarvis bakery; there was honey bread and patience like the sign had promised, and there was a woman at the counter telling Maybelle that she was brave like adults tell children they like their shoes, and Maybelle nodded as if she recognized the currency and was willing to accept it this once. They stopped at Neptune\u2019s to give Amber a thank-you, and Amber made a noise that suggested growing up and kept the neon cats on the high shelf because habit makes you superstitious. They bought a whale pin because pins understand the language of grief and self-protection both. They drove the canopy road where the trees in their tunnel state remind drivers that space is a thing granted, not guaranteed. They did not talk about the letter in the linen envelope because sometimes you let a hinge go unnamed for an afternoon to see if the door behaves itself out of loyalty.\n\nAt Levy again that week, a man playing chess on a board he carried everywhere like a hymn told Boone that he had given a woman directions to a workshop about stilt walking at the warehouse space off Railroad, that she had looked disappointed when he told her the workshop had been canceled because the man who runs it had decided to go to New Orleans. The man saw so much because he spends his days moving sixteen pieces on sixty-four squares and everyone believes he is looking only at kings. He had a coin in his pocket, and when he was nervous he spun it on the bench; copper blurred. Lyle watched the spin with the crush of a new religion. The chess man gave the coin away at the end of the conversation and looked relieved, like he had solved a game nobody else had seen.\n\nZante went to the warehouse and stood in its echo. Stilts leaned against a wall like a congregation that had lost its sermon. The rental man\u2019s ledger had hands drawn in the margins, fingers exaggerated, as if he could not stop thinking about how we hold ourselves up. A sheet of paper thumbtacked and curling said: TALL CLASS CANCELED UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE, and someone had written underneath, in pencil, in a handwriting that refused to be seen, or couldn\u2019t help being seen, depending on your view: short forever. She took the paper because vandalism is a form of donation sometimes.\n\nThat night, Zante woke to the house making a sound she did not like\u2014a small, soft knock that wasn\u2019t at the door, a kind of request from inside the architecture. Abigail slept on, breath even, a faithful machine. Zante walked the perimeter like a captain does\u2014hand on the back of the couch, fingers on the window locks, the cat outside in the neighbor\u2019s yard a bright triangle passing through shadow. In the kitchen, under the bowl that always held too many keys because keys reproduce when unattended, lay another envelope from the linen store, a quality that made the hair on her arms stand beautifully. The same greedy A on the back flap. Inside, a picture of a mouth, yes, but not in any of the styles she knew. It was a mouth open not to speak but to sing, the shape of a vowel that lifts the soft palate and changes the shape of the head. The caption on the back said: vow, and under it: the hollows in us have better handwriting than stone. It was her line, from the Sunday after the fair. It had been written cleanly, respectfully copied, and then the A again, scaffold strong.\n\nShe did not wake Abigail. She sat at the table with the vow in her hand and thought about trespass that isn\u2019t about breaking doors but about stepping into the words a person uses to make a home. She thought about the ladder man in London and how he never touched a body, and how bodies touched themselves differently because of him. She thought about breath again, and how we all love to hear a person inhale when something surprises them because it means the world got in. She put the card back in its envelope and wrote on the front in her own hand, loop open, crossbar light: do not oblige this. She tucked it at the bottom of her stack of sermons because sermons are the only place in her life where she gets to be in charge of the order of things.\n\nMorning gave her no time for rumination. A call from the hospital asked for a priest for a child who had not been harmed but had learned how harm sounds; a family wanted a blessing for a room because the air had been taught to be suspicious. She went, and she stood by a bed where a television in the corner was arguing gently with cartoons, and she put oil on the lintel because oil behaves like language does\u2014moving into places it has no right to be. She could not make any promises that mattered. She could make sentences. She did that until the room felt less like a secret kept badly and more like a stopping place on a road nobody had chosen.\n\nWhen she came out onto the sidewalk, Abigail was there in the heat as if she had been drawn, her dress stuck to her in ways that evidence would, if called upon, find familiar. \u201cHe called me today,\u201d she said without preface, and Zante knew the he, because every city keeps a short list of men with radio shows who believe their job is to tie ropes around the big story and drag it into the studio for public processing. \u201cHe wants me on a panel about forgiveness. He paired me with a man who yells on Facebook and a woman who thinks lipstick is a political party. For balance.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou said no,\u201d Zante said.\n\n\u201cI said I would think,\u201d Abigail said, and Zante felt that old slide in her chest, the one that happens when someone you love puts a foot on ice and looks back at you like maybe you\u2019ll call it water. \u201cI thought maybe I could be useful. I thought maybe, if I made small there\u2014if I made the giant joke into a story about hunger instead\u2014maybe people would forget to be harmful on their way home. Maybe I could plant shame in a way that makes flowers, not knives.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can,\u201d Zante said, and it hurt. \u201cYou can also be used. Tools don\u2019t get a say in who holds them.\u201d She reached and put a hand on Abigail\u2019s elbow and was brave enough to leave it there. \u201cIf you go, go with a rule that you will not break in a chair under bright lights. Write it on your arm. Make it be your bread.\u201d\n\nAbigail smiled, and it looked like how a person looks when she has made a great decision and is perfectly aware it is also a poor one. \u201cI will not perform for absolution. I will not sell tickets to my own penance.\u201d She said it aloud, and the street caught it like a coin and spun it once and then let it drop.\n\nThat evening, she went, of course. The station made free lemonade with too much ice and a young producer with a haircut like a manifesto greeted them as if their RSVP had cured his insomnia. The host loved his microphone in a way that made Zante worry for the people in his life. The panel set was three chairs and a table with a plant that had not been told it was a prop and was therefore trying to photosynthesize honestly. The yelling Facebook man wore a shirt that wanted to be an argument. The lipstick-is-politics woman had opinions that would have been difficult to manage even if they had been ten percent less shiny. Abigail wore nothing on her mouth. She wore a dress with sleeves because she had learned something about the intimacy of bare elbows. She wrote her rule on her arm in sharpie, and the young producer asked if he could take a picture and she said yes, because she is generous to a fault with the small ways people ask permission.\n\nThey asked her to repent on air. She said, \u201cI am sorry for the size of my choices.\u201d The man said, \u201cDo you believe in evil,\u201d and she said, \u201cOnly like I believe in weather. It will pass. It will also come again.\u201d The woman said, \u201cDon\u2019t you see that your lips made all of us\u2014\u201d and Abigail, gentle and dangerous and a person Zante recognized and wanted to applaud and arrest and kiss\u2014said, \u201cMy lips didn\u2019t make you do anything. Your mouth did. We are responsible for the tools we pick up when the rumor asks us to build.\u201d The crowd of listeners on the other side of the glass clapped because people love to clap when they have been told a sentence that sounds like wisdom even if it makes them uncomfortable. The host broke for commercials with the air of someone who believes in his own ability to steer humanities.\n\nWhen it was over and the plant resumed its quiet work without an audience, a woman came up to the glass with a child on her hip and held her hand against the barrier as if blessing a window were a reasonable ask. She had a cap pulled low, a flat cap that belonged to a photograph of a grandfather. She turned her hand over so that the palm faced in, and written there, in blue marker, in a hand that leaned forward into its verbs: If you name a thing, you give it teeth. She smiled in a way that looked less like friendliness and more like the beginning of a negotiation. Then she was gone into the parking lot\u2019s permission and the station\u2019s security guard called after her that she couldn\u2019t smoke within twenty feet of the entrance and she laughed and said she wasn\u2019t smoking and left the smell of eucalyptus anyway.\n\nZante and Abigail stood under the awning long enough for rain to begin and fail again. The asphalt took the drops and turned them into dark currency, circles that pleaded for greater economics. \u201cThe A,\u201d Abigail said, watching the woman\u2019s receding back as if the curve of a human could provide a clue a camera would miss. \u201cShe wants to be the author. She wants us all to write around her. She wants to be essential. She wants the hinge to know her name.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe will give us something we can use,\u201d Zante said. \u201cPeople like her always do. They cannot resist the urge to be helpful to their own myth.\u201d She was tired, and the kind of tired that isn\u2019t solved by sleep, and she found herself humming one of the whale-song tracks that had come in a CD with a children\u2019s magazine years before and had gotten stuck in the church\u2019s collection of weird donations. The sound was not accurate; she was not a whale, she was a human, and yet the low moan settled something in her because it was too silly to be holy and too primal to be a lie.\n\nIn the days that followed, the hinge notes continued. One under the mat at the vicarage door, a photograph of a chapel door\u2019s hardware with a caption: absolve means loosen. One in the choir loft, tucked under a hymnal whose list of favorites had turned into a ranking and then into a faction, this one a picture of a mouth that was not a mouth at all, but the carved squinch of a grotesque at the roofline of a library across the ocean, the shape of gape changed by weather into meaning. One left on Boone\u2019s desk, without envelope, brazen, a drawing this time, pencil, good pencil, the graphite smudged and then polished by a sleeve, of a penny with a hinge for a face.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like being fed,\u201d Boone said, finally, putting both hands on his desk and addressing the wood, because addressing the intangible makes you look dramatic and he had decided drama was hers to provide. \u201cI want to catch the hand on the tray. I want to sit her in a chair and ask her why coins, why eucalyptus, why acting like we didn\u2019t get the child back, why acting like anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe wants me to preach,\u201d Zante said. \u201cShe wants me to build her into a lesson. She wants to be written on. She will not like the font I choose.\u201d She offered the bishop\u2019s courtesy level of smile and then went to sit in the chapel by herself for a half hour because alone is a sacrament when done intentionally. She did not cry because crying is sometimes too uncomplicated for the weather of a week. She did not pray with words because she had used too many lately. She breathed, which is both the smallest and the largest thing she knows how to do.\n\nOn Friday night, Railroad Square filled up because art and beer like to be near one another; their fumes make people believe in the possibility of both. Food trucks lined up like friendly animals. A band played a cover of a song that should never be covered and then apologized and then did it again because mistakes become style if repeated with confidence. Children ran a feral school under the tables and invented rules that had everything to do with touch and nothing to do with law. Someone, that someone, managed to put a photograph under each plastic chair at the listening station where the vicar had once danced badly because Abigail had insisted and where the vicar would never dance again unless someone insulted one of the saints personally, in which case she would invent jubilation as a weapon. The chairs creaked and the photographs crinkled and one of the children, of course, noticed first and held the picture up like proof of life.\n\nThis time: not lips. Knees. Close knees, turned inward slightly, the posture of the shy and the guilty and the child whose mom keeps saying sit like a person. Knobby, bruised, skinned. Knees with bandages. Knees with dirt. Knees with chalk on them, chalk in the pattern of that day\u2019s hopscotch. On the back of one, a word: kneel. On the back of another, a word: knock. On the back of another, a phrase: do not wash the proof. The handwriting had been the same, the forward-leaning eagerness, the crossbar that knew it was labor.\n\nThe air changed. It does, sometimes. It wasn\u2019t fear; fear is sharper. It was attention turning from pleasure to posture, the way a dog turns when it hears its name on a voice that was not speaking to it. Zante handed a photograph to Boone and said, \u201cShe\u2019s moving up the body.\u201d He said, \u201cShe wants to see how many people will take their hats off because the weather changed.\u201d People bend to pick things up and feel religious. They stood together in the soft noise and watched the city swallow new stories, and neither of them said the words pattern or escalation because they had spent a week teaching those words to sit, and they would not reward them with treats.\n\nWhen they went home, a package sat on the front step, the kind that announces itself with branded tape and then pretends to be innocent of its own insistence. Abigail\u2019s name. Inside, no note, just a stilt strap, new, leather that had not yet made its decision about the shape of the thigh it would partner, and a jar of eucalyptus ointment you could buy at any CVS within a dash of good intentions. Under them, wrapped in tissue as if a gift, a book of hymns with the title rubbed off the cover by years of fingers. Between pages twenty-two and twenty-three, another envelope, linen, too much money for a person of sense to spend on paper, and inside, an image of a small door in a wall too thick for a house, the kind that makes cities out of pockets. The caption on the back, in that irritating, compelling hand: small does not mean safe. Then, below: meet me where the rowboats walk. It didn\u2019t say when. It didn\u2019t need to. When someone writes you a note like that, they are anticipating you right now, or they don\u2019t know you at all.\n\nThey went because of course they did. You go not because you want to play the game but because you want to end it on your own page. Boone insisted on being there because he had a gun and a vest and a refusal to let women he respects walk toward trouble without a person who can be blamed if a report demands it. Lyle came because he would have chewed his own hand off before he let them leave him behind when puzzles are being solved. They did it at dawn because dawn is the hour where the city\u2019s tired lets you see the underpainting. The boardwalk remembered the oval prints; the grass remembered being scolded for lying down. The bench stood and offered its good wood like testimony.\n\nShe was there. Denim jacket in heat because her trope had announced itself and she had committed to the bit. Hat low. Mouth bare, which meant she wanted to be believed. She stood with one hand on the back of the bench and the other holding a card she did not relax. They stood a pace away, and Boone rehearsed his hands on his belt, and Lyle looked at the horizon because he didn\u2019t know where else to put his eyes yet. Zante spoke first because that is what you do when you are wearing kindness as armor.\n\n\u201cYou came because you needed to finish a sentence,\u201d she said, and the woman laughed, and it was a good laugh, a pleasurable sound, the kind that would make you forgive an interruption in a movie theater if it came at the right scene. \u201cYou all came,\u201d the woman said. \u201cLike a choir.\u201d Her voice had the rasp that comes from arguing with air conditioning and then smoking anyway. She handed the card to Zante because she had to give something away to prove she had been here. On the front, the mouth, again, but this one was hers\u2014Zante realized it slowly, as if the recognition had been made to walk. Her mouth, the way it looks when she is about to say coveting or when she is about to say go in peace. On the back, the words: we make vows with our mouths first. The trap was lovely. The trap said: you said this, you started this, you own this.\n\n\u201cI am not your hinge,\u201d Zante said, and it was more tender than she meant it. \u201cYou do not get to swing on me.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are every hinge,\u201d the woman said, impatient. \u201cYou speak and people lift their hands. You and she made a city that listens to mouths again. Before, they were all eyes. Staring at their phones. I brought pennies. You brought promises. Between us, we made a faith.\u201d She took off the hat and revealed a face that belonged to no one Zante had been saving as a suspect to crush. Ordinary in the way the extraordinary always is once it steps into a correct light. Cheekbones like any, a nose that belonged to its family, a mouth that had been practicing since childhood and was tired. The purple lipstick would have suited her and she had left it off. She wore nails painted the color of erasers.\n\n\u201cWhat do you want,\u201d Boone said, because he believes in asking that ugly question first so the person can\u2019t pretend not to have rehearsed it. She looked at him briefly like he was a prop she respected. \u201cI wanted to be studied,\u201d she said, and the honesty was not admirable, but it was refreshing like pouring cold water on your own head after mowing a lawn. \u201cWhen I could not be, I wanted to study you. I want to be in your sermons. I want to be in her photographs. I want the giant to belong to me because you made it soft and I know how to make it sharp.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou do not get to hurt anyone,\u201d Zante said, and the woman\u2019s eyes flashed, that quick animal look that proclaims: I know the rule, but I resent the person who recites it. \u201cI didn\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2014that is, whatever you think of as a he, the man who walked a ladder around London in your story\u2014he hurt no one and made all of you worse. That fascinated me. Hurt is so boring. You can measure it. What I am interested in is the way a city picks a word and then carries it like a saint.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou brought a child to a motel,\u201d Boone said, gentle, because gentleness makes people tell on themselves. She shook her head as if scolding the wrong parent. \u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cThat was your tall girl who lives on her feelings. I\u2019m flat. I have always been flat. I like tape. I like paper. I like the way a penny looks when the light makes it worth more than it is. My job at the laundromat is to clean the distillate tray in the dryer that no one knows exists; I get the lint that is the little, little of everyone. I wanted to make something out of it. So I did. Did it hurt? No. Did it disturb you? Yes. Good. You were all standing around pretending not to notice your mouths anymore.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour name,\u201d Zante said, not because she would arrest her with it, but because without it, the woman would keep building herself taller. The woman shrugged because she knew that refusing to say your name gives you a longer runway. \u201cA is fine,\u201d she said, and smiled. \u201cIt belongs to all of us.\u201d\n\nThere are moments when you can feel the city decide. The birds don\u2019t stop; the wind doesn\u2019t lean; but a hundred people somewhere mention a topic at the same time and the word crosses a street without getting hit. Zante felt it then. It would have been easy to lunge, to turn this into a scene with bodies and cuffs and commands. It would have been easy to let the woman write the last card. It would have been easy to be big and hope small forgave them later. She did something ruder and more precise.\n\n\u201cYou like coins,\u201d she said. \u201cSo here\u2019s a trade. You give me something true, not metaphor, not handed to a photograph to make it into an altar. You give me one place we need to look for a child who isn\u2019t home yet. You know a name. You know a knot. And I will let you keep your A until noon tomorrow.\u201d She held the woman with her eyes in that priest way that only works when the other person has already half-decided to confess and needs a place to put the proper noun.\n\nThe woman swallowed. It changed the shape of her face just enough to make her temporarily ugly, which is to say human. Her mouth opened, and for once it was not mythology or mischief that came out. \u201cLake Ella,\u201d she said. \u201cThe canoe rental shed. There\u2019s a space under the steps. There\u2019s a boy who sleeps there sometimes because his mother\u2019s boyfriend\u2019s car has a seat with a spring that makes his back cry. He didn\u2019t come last night. He said he was going to. He smells like cigarettes and detergent. His name is Trey. He plays the game with the pennies at the edge of the boardwalk sometimes. He is the right size for your city to ignore and the right size for me to pity. Go check, and if he isn\u2019t there, look behind the shed where the workmen leave the bags of mulch and think no one knows where they\u2014\u201d\n\nBoone was already on his radio, his voice turning into dispatch shapes. Lyle ran like he had been given a word and told to carry it to the person who says yes. The woman smiled, small and unfaithful. \u201cWe are not so different,\u201d she said to Zante. \u201cWe both love the satisfaction of a good clue.\u201d Zante allowed herself the cruelty of not answering. She had been practicing.\n\nThey found the boy. He had a sock for a pillow and a backpack for a wall and a picture of a dog in the pocket of his shorts and a mouth that had decided to be quiet because quiet kept bruises off his arms. He was not gone; he was missing only in the way the world loses track of people without receipts. They did the small things\u2014water first, not questions. Sit on the step, not the grass because ants make everything worse. Ask in tone, not in filing language. Trey had that bravado used by children who have memorized the names of football teams but not the names of the muscles that ache when they carry groceries for a woman who loves the wrong man. He came with them because Boone had learned to make the front seat of a patrol car more farm dog than squad, and because Lyle had a voice that says you will not be harmed by my applause if you do not deserve it. Zante rode along for nothing more than to do the ancient priest job of bearing witness to an ordinary salvation.\n\nWhen they returned, the woman in the denim was gone. The bench remembered her the way wood remembers every hand. On the seat, a penny, face up, the copper warmed by the sun that had finally decided to do its job. Under the penny, a small neat card with a mouth drawn rather than photographed, a line of graphite for lips, a soft smudge for breath, and the letter A heavy and sure as scaffolding. On the back: noon tomorrow. The time was a dare, and an invitation, and a promise, and a threat, and Zante laughed without sound because of course the city had produced a villain precise enough to schedule her own climax.\n\nThey went home and ate fruit like it was a sacrament, not a symbol. Abigail took photographs of nothing\u2014in the kitchen, the curve of the sink where water decides to go to ground, the shadow that a bowl makes when the light is stupid, the specific way Zante\u2019s left hand holds a fork when she has chosen mercy over anger. They made a list of things they would not do. They would not be baited into spectacle. They would not write her into their vows. They would not let the city\u2019s appetite draft them as caterers. They pinned the list on the refrigerator with a magnet in the shape of a whale because you have to laugh. Then Zante washed her face and practiced saying the word no in three registers\u2014the pastoral, the investigative, the spousal\u2014and found that the spousal one hurt her throat least.\n\nAt noon tomorrow, the city would perform for itself. It always does. Zante decided to let it. Meanwhile, there was a boy with a backpack to be delivered to a person who would not turn his back into a map of another man\u2019s temper. Meanwhile, there was a sermon to write that did not contain the word giant and would still be heard as if it did. Meanwhile, there was a hinge in her pocket, linen envelope and all, and it bothered her like a pebble in a shoe because she had not yet decided whether to throw it at a pigeon or keep it under glass. She went to her desk and opened her notebook and wrote in pencil because pencils forgive, and she wrote the unheadline she wanted: We were hungry and we brought bread and not knives, and some idiot turned it into a performance anyway, and we loved them enough to make the stage small. It was not good prose. It was a good promise. She underlined nothing and closed the book on the line and went to find Abigail, who was in the other room, practicing being exactly her own size on purpose.",

The heat put its hands flat on the windows, the kind of humid insistence that makes even air-conditioned faith feel like it is sweating into its shoes. Zante woke early and let herself be ordinary for an hour, coffee from a chipped mug, the collar set on the counter instead of around her throat, the pencil making short work of a list that was not about strategy so much as manners. She called three people who could be trusted to resist spectacle even when spectacle winked at them, and she asked them to bring bread as if they were going to after-school care and not to a place where a rumor had decided to stage itself. She texted Boone and asked for a quiet perimeter, not the bright kind that looks like a lesson plan. He answered with a thumbs-up she pretended not to find adorable, because some men are allowed the occasional emoji if they have carried other people\u2019s emergencies with their faces too long. She left a note on the refrigerator under the whale magnet reminding herself to say no out loud if her body forgot what her mind had decided, and she laughed once at the absurdity and the necessity of leaving instructions in your own house.\n\nPeople had chosen to gather whether they had been invited or not; that is the nature of a town that believes in its stories like exercise. The boardwalk smelled of lake and sunscreen and gossip that had been left in sunlight too long. A freckled teenager wore a T-shirt that said LOCAL MYTH ENTHUSIAST and had crossed out MYTH with a thick marker so that anyone reading had to do a little work to decide how funny they found it. Two women in straw hats tried to look like they were here to walk and found themselves checking for cameras without meaning to. An old man with a dog built like a question mark kept his gaze on the water as if to create the illusion of privacy for everyone else. Zante stood by the bench because the bench is where the city had decided to pin its hope and its complaint. She had a bag of coins she had emptied from a jar at the church where people leave offerings that are too small to be formal and too specific to be random; she would not let one woman\u2019s tape make pennies into omens without a fight. She welcomed anyone who approached with the kind of nod you give a neighbor you have not yet decided if you like, and she gave a child two coins and said the lemonade stand that wasn\u2019t there today would be back tomorrow, and in the meantime he could make a wish quietly and then find something else to spend the wish on. He shrugged as if this made sense to him and made the coin spin until it looked like an argument and then he let it fall flat in the shade where even copper tires quickly.\n\nBoone drifted at the edge of things like a rock you forget is in the river until you stub your shin and curse and then apologize for cursing. He had put two officers in plain clothes into chairs with styrofoam cups and a posture that suggested divorce more than stakeout; he was learning how to hide from a city that had been eating uniforms for breakfast. Lyle carried a cooler like any civilian trying to be helpful and kept finding reasons to be at the periphery of clusters of conversation, where the best overheard sentences live. Abigail came late on purpose because she had an instinct for timing and for making timing look like accident; she wore a dress with sleeves and no lipstick and a pair of sandals that made her walk sound like a person, not an entrance. She stood on the other side of the bench and did not catch Zante\u2019s eye until bystanders had satisfied themselves that someone would recognize if the vicar\u2019s wife and the vicar intending to be a person were both here. When they finally met, they did not stage a greeting. They let their mouths do the work of small and their shoulders stay down.\n\nThe woman in the denim arrived as if she had been waiting inside the day all morning and had only now decided to present her silhouette. She had chosen a hat that cast her face into a sensible kind of anonymity, a flat cap that a grandfather might have rehearsed being extravagantly ordinary in. Her jacket looked less like defiance and more like habit, and her hands were busy from the moment she stepped onto the boards, the fingers arranging something that resisted arrangement. She brought a stack of photographs tucked under her arm in a manner that made them look like mail she had been entrusted with and not like bait. She moved to the bench in a line that wasn\u2019t straight and therefore human. She did not look at Zante at first; it impressed Zante that the woman knew she was not the only pair of eyes worth courting.\n\nZante had decided beforehand that she would not let questions be called down into a microphone whose job had only ever been amplification; she would let verbs lead. She turned to the nearest clutch of people and said, \u201cWe are going to feed each other,\u201d and she said it in the kind of soft that compels rather than invites. A woman took bread, the good kind from the Jarvis bakery, the crust that had made Maybelle consider growing up in a single afternoon, and then that woman tore it and gave it to a boy whose mother had not remembered cash because the rumor had taught her to leave the house nervous and unpocketed. The boy said thank you without being told, and the rumor had to accommodate good manners, which does not suit it. Zante gave coins to a father and watched him hand them to his child and watched that child keep one and give one back, and in that simple math there was dignity that legends cannot digest without gagging.\n\nThe woman in denim produced her photographs and it was always going to be new content. Shoulders this time, the slope of them, the way some take weight like a stone shelf and some take nothing like a promise and some have learned to curve inward in a shape you could call humble and you could call shy and you could call self-protection and you might be right all three times. Scars across one where sun had decided to write and then regretted its handwriting. A white strap line on another that was the opposite of bruise and somehow meaner. A shoulder with glitter stuck to it because small girls like to make their molecules visible. On the back of one, in that forward-handed writing that wanted to be caught in the act: should. On another: shelter. On another: shoulder someone else\u2019s and you forget your own. She did not hold the photographs high. She let people find them. She let discovery give a child the feeling that they had been allowed to interrupt grown-ups with proof.\n\nAbigail watched with her mouth in that line the world had learned to read as either complicity or critique, depending on what it needed. She wrinkled her nose once because somebody\u2019s cologne had overestimated its importance and because the mention of eucalyptus in her head had trained her to sniff, unfairly, for that particular leaf. She saw the woman hand a card to a boy who had the good kind of skepticism in his shoulders, and she saw the boy use his skepticism and take the card anyway and bring it to his mother, who read it and then tucked it into her bag as if evidence should be kept next to wet wipes. Abigail leaned closer to Zante and said, without moving her lips enough to become a quotation, that the woman had a new perfume today that was less dentist and more bee balm, and Zante said that of course she had adjusted; any good actor adjusts with the room.\n\nWhat Zante did next was not dramatic and therefore had the kind of power that keeps chairs from scooting. In a voice that was not for the microphones because the microphones were busy being turned off by a pair of volunteers who had a way with cables, she said, \u201cWe are not going to say her letter at noon today. We are going to say names of things we will not let hunger resize. We are going to make sentences that are small enough to carry home in our pockets and that will not break when they hit the kitchen table.\u201d People looked at her because the collar has that effect and because authority can be made and also has to be believed in a given square of sky. She went first because that is the burden and the privilege of the person who starts the list. \u201cI will keep the shape of water cups holy,\u201d she said, and it would have been ridiculous if not for the cooler and the heat and the knowledge that the first thing people weaponize when panic becomes policy is thirst. A woman said, \u201cI will shoulder my sister\u2019s lease for two months,\u201d and the kid with the T-shirt said, \u201cI will close the tabs on my phone that keep me angry when I could be useful,\u201d and a man with tattoos that looked like they told the truth even when he did not said, \u201cI will stop calling my bad memory selective and call it bad and apologize like it\u2019s unpaid rent.\u201d They went on like that for too long to be interesting and long enough to be honest, and by the end of it the rumor had been made to sit with its hands folded, at least for that hour.\n\nThe woman in denim stood and watched and let her mouth become thin the way a person who had planned a party and found another party had brought better snacks lets a disappointment be visible. She put a photograph down on the bench without flourish and the photograph was a mouth again but not a stranger\u2019s, not even Zante\u2019s again; this was Abigail\u2019s, in a frame so tight the viewer could see the unretouched pores at the border where color and flesh dispute territory. On the back, the sentence Zante had used three days earlier and had put back into her notebook like a bird she was not yet ready to release. It was an act of flattery and theft and argument in one, and the woman stood very far away and did not enjoy how she had been written into smallness. Zante picked up the card and put it in her bag because sometimes you refuse to be curated.\n\nBoone let the moment be what it was meant to be and then he did three things so boring they were radical. He walked a slow loop that required people to shift aside and consider that their elbows exist in a world with other elbows. He asked a man wearing a camera neck strap whether the camera had a memory card in it or just a sense of its own importance, and when the man said both, Boone smiled and told him to keep photographing children\u2019s shoes and leave their faces alone. He asked the woman in denim if she would like a drink and then let her say no three times because the third no is where people often put the truth. She declined without offense and he could smell eucalyptus despite her best efforts, less sharp today because hubris had been rinsed off by the crowd\u2019s refusal to behave like an audience.\n\nThe card on the bench was not the only offering. Under the boards, in the long shadow that late morning insists on, a paper bag tucked itself into a corner like it had learned the posture of guilt. Lyle\u2019 s foot found it because he has a foot that belongs to clues, always landing a half inch to the left of showy. They did not pull at it with gloved fingers like a television would have had them do. They asked a child to bring his father because children will tell a person everything about a bag if they believe the bag contains nothing they are guilty of. The father bent and retrieved it and when he opened it there were pennies inside, taped together in pairs with the same blue painter\u2019s tape, as if someone had decided that the way to get two mouths to meet was to force copper to kiss. There was also a tube of lipstick, purple ugly as a bruise reheated, with the label filed off like a thief learns to do on his first day of commerce. There was a stub of a pencil of the expensive sort that artists buy to believe in their own lines. No note. The woman had upped the tone and then left it to get sour.\n\nIt should have been a crescendo, and it was not, which infuriated the part of the day that had gotten dressed for drama. People left in clumps to go do errands because groceries do not buy themselves and children do not love you more for staying at a scene of adult staging. A handful of teenagers tried to take the painter\u2019s tape and tape their wrists together in the way of kids who are always looking for a permission that feels like rebellion, and a volunteer in a shirt that said USHER and meant it in all the forms of the verb smiled and said no kindly because a kind no, when delivered correctly, can act like the opposite of a dare. The woman in denim stood very still and then very slowly, like a person asking a body she knew too well to perform a trick it had not warmed up for, she rolled one shoulder back and then the other and wiped her face with the inside of her wrist where no one wears perfume. She put two fingers to the brim of her cap in a gesture that was not ownership and not farewell and not, thank God, saluting, and then she walked away without looking back to see who had counted her steps.\n\nZante sat on the bench when the crowded hour had forgotten itself and the lake went back to whispering and the boards went back to the work of holding the weight of people who do not write myth. Abigail joined her and did not speak in the way of two women who know that their contribution for that minute is not to further sculpt language. Boone came and let himself look like a man at lunch. Lyle went to throw something away not because he needed to but because sometimes a body needs to carry trash to a can to decide it did a job. Zante took the photograph with her own mouth on it out of her bag and looked at it for longer than was civilized. She put her thumb over the image and felt the slick surface resist. She did not like being collected, even when the curator swore she was building a museum to mercy. Abigail watched her do it and did not offer to take the card away, although the offer laid itself on her tongue and rolled back like a tide that knew to leave the shore alone when the shore was doing its own thinking.\n\nIn the aftermath hours, the city remembered that it had to be a city and not a single rumor. The bishop called to ask whether they had need of casseroles for nobody in particular, and Zante thanked her the way you thank a person offering a blanket when you are only chilly and not in danger. Amber at the arcade texted a picture of a new sign on the redemption counter that read BELLS TEMPORARILY UNAVAILABLE and made a face in emoji because some humor can only be expressed as punctuation. Maybelle\u2019s father sent a bag of rolls with Lyle to the station because bread has never stopped being a form of currency in households where people take the time to knead. Jess called from a phone somewhere in the system and left a voice message that said only, \u201cShe hates not being allowed to write the end,\u201d and then a click that was not a hang-up so much as a permission for silence to start again.\n\nThe letter that came that night did not travel by envelope; it arrived under the ashtray that had no cigarettes in it because the house refused to become a place for that particular smoke. Someone had put the ashtray there during a party years ago because it felt grown-up and then had never used it. Under it was a folded piece of thick paper that had been cut hastily from a larger sheet, the edge rough as if the blade had needed help and the hand had provided encouragement. Inside, a photograph of a hinge again, not a door this time but a toy chest\u2019s, the brass dulled perfectly by small fingers that had learned how to open and close and be proud. On the back, in that same forward press of letters: you made quiet into a crowd. The compliment was sincere and useless. Underneath, with the crossbar on the A drawn as if she were building scaffolding with impatience: noon did not keep my promise. There was no time set for the next act, which made it worse in the way empty spaces on calendars can be worse than solid blocks.\n\nAbigail sat at the table and pushed her glass into a ring of water and then pushed it again to make the ring larger; she had always liked to watch circles argue with stipulations. \u201cShe\u2019s going to go stranger,\u201d she said, because escalation is not always size; sometimes it is novelty. Zante said that the city had not yet recovered from the sound of its own smallness and that might give them more time than they deserved. Abigail said that time in this town is a rumor with a calendar, and then they both let the conversation sit until it forgot to be important. Later, when they were in bed with the fan doing that kind of noise that pretends to do more work than it does, Abigail said, not like a possible confession but like a weather report, that she had thought about calling the radio man back to tell him she had more to say about forgiveness, and that she had not done it because forgiveness is too glamorous a noun for her to be trusted with on Thursdays.\n\nBoone\u2019s text in the morning was the kind that announces small and wins big. He\u2019d sent a photo of a boy sitting on a station bench coloring in a picture of a whale with a blue crayon that had been snapped in two and was therefore twice as useful. Trey had a new shirt because somebody somewhere had decided to keep a closet for such kids stocked not by principle but by habit. The boy had opinions about pancakes that Lyle wrote down because nobody ever gets asked the right questions in rooms like that and Lyle had decided that he would change the intake form to include a space for favorite breakfast foods. Boone wrote, in a sentence longer than his usual patience: Laundromat called. The woman who cleans the distillate tray hasn\u2019t come in. Name on the timecard is Alva. It\u2019s close to an A somebody would choose if she wanted to be biblical while pretending to be anonymous. We\u2019re going to go small at the lint trap.\n\nThe laundromat did not mind being a place for theology; it was used to revelations done in hot air and in the quiet between cycles. Alva existed in the log in the particular way that people exist when they are paid in cash and in the relief other people feel when a dirty thing becomes briefly clean. She had a schedule that overlaid like tracing paper with Jess\u2019s old shifts at Neptune\u2019s and with the nights the taco truck had parked itself like a mirage at the lake. The manager, who had the soft look of a person whose day consists predominantly of apologizing to machines and to some lovely extent to people who are machines about their own rituals, said that Alva talked in complete sentences to the washers and not to anyone else. He showed them a crate where she kept her things and it was exactly what you would expect from a person whose handwriting leaned forward: a notebook with pages torn out carefully and pages torn out violently, a stack of photographs of hinges and mouths and child shoulders printed on paper that could not weather a season, a handful of pennies that had been polished with a rag until the date could be read like a hope, a tube of ointment still scented and not cheap. There was a cap that smelled of scalp and lake. There were no receipts, because some people live on receipts and some people avoid them like metronomes because they do not want to hear what they already know.\n\n\u201cAlva,\u201d Abigail said, tasting the name like a vowel she had held longer than is polite. \u201cThat\u2019s a grandmother\u2019s name that got lost on the way to a child.\u201d Zante said that names like that teach you to bend into their shape and that sometimes the bending gets mistaken for humility. Boone did the practical things, entered the name into the modest chorus of databases that the department pretended was an orchestra, ran the time compared to Trey\u2019s disappearances and the park\u2019s play of rumor, made himself a small map on a piece of paper because sometimes paper allows you to lie to yourself less successfully than screens do. He circled the laundromat and Neptune\u2019s and the bench with a pen that had leaked in his pocket and had blessed his thigh with a blue he would carry all week.\n\nWhat they could not do was arrest a hinge, not when it had not been attached to violence. What they could do was refuse to hold it up in the square and let people worship. Zante told the bishop she was going to preach a series of verbs instead of nouns until the town bored itself of language and fell back in love with doing. The bishop said that verbs were always a safer bet and then reminded her to drink water because bishops are allowed, in their broad vocation, to mother the clergy whether they ask for it or not. Abigail planned a show of objects that could not be sold, a room of small things\u2014cracked cups and tape dispensers and cards with grocery lists\u2014photographed so close that even the people who prefer being sentimental about eyes would have to engage with the mouth-equivalents of daily life. She said that if she could trick the city into being bored by scale, she would call it a success. She said it in the tone of a woman who has not yet decided whether she believes in mercy for herself but is willing to impersonate someone who does, in case it teaches her something.\n\nThe call came from the library not from the reference desk but from the children\u2019s room, where a volunteer with a voice like felt announced that someone had left coins under four chairs and a ring of blue around the mouth of the turtle statue the city had bought years ago as a reminder that some kinds of slowness are heroic. They went in a cluster because you do not send one person to a place where a turtle has been made into a message. The coins were taped to the underside of chairs like a schoolboy\u2019s stash; the tape was blue but not the same brand as before, and Zante put that into the file in her head labeled improvisation because when a rumor runs low on supplies it becomes interesting. The turtle wore the ring of painter\u2019s tape like a child would wear a ribbon meant for an adult, not quite right and therefore adorable and therefore dangerous. A note, always the note, tucked in the mouth of a stuffed dragon that had lost one button eye, read: the hinge on a book is a spine. You read and I open. The A was barbed now; the crossbar looked like an act of self-congratulation.\n\nThe librarian with the bun who had opted out of drama from the beginning set down her scanner and said, in the tone of a woman who has been patient, that the city was doing the thing it always does when it is bored and afraid at the same time, which is to attend to esoteric stationery and leave the person in need standing ten feet away asking for a bathroom. Zante loved her for it, not least because it allowed her to feel vindicated in her campaign against nouns. She gathered the coins, threw the tape in the bin, patted the turtle\u2019s head with the kind of respect you give a public object that has held thousands of children without complaint, and told the volunteer to read something about whales to the group that had wandered over because the vowel is an honest noise and the letter W has always been a hinge in disguise.\n\nThat night, under their own roof, Abigail pulled out a photograph she had not shown anyone, not because it incriminated and not because it absolved, but because it embarrassed her. It was a picture she had taken months ago, sloppy and precisely what she loves\u2014an image of Zante\u2019s hand on a page, pencil against paper, a thumbnail with a chip in it, the faint shadow of the ring that had been removed five minutes earlier to have lotion applied. The mouth was not in frame, which made it, for once, about a promise that had been handed to a tool and not to a face. Abigail said that looking at it made her feel braver about her own scale, and Zante said that if bravery could be outsourced to images she would take a subscription and stop speaking for a week. They laughed in the manner of the exhausted, which is to say with more air than sound. The letter under the ashtray glowered politely, and they left it there because some things you do not file and you do not burn; you let them decide what they are by failing to do their worst in your presence.\n\nMorning brought a rain that did not apologize. It hit the city like a plan that had been drawn up by someone who knew everyone\u2019s best excuses and had invited them anyway. The boardwalk went dark and clean and uninterested in carrying anyone\u2019s theater. The turtle under its ring of tape felt less like a prop; you can bathe anything in rain and it becomes briefly its own. The laundromat rattled happily. Neptune\u2019s carpet smelled like it forgave children for being damp. The station phones rang with the usual wrong numbers and two right ones and Boone assigned the right calls to men who pretend to mind being asked to do kindness that cannot be logged on a sheet as crime prevention.\n\nAt midday, while the rain did that thing of being noisy and therefore comforting, a package arrived at the church addressed to no one and everyone. It was light in a way that packages rarely are when they have something to prove inside them. Inside, hinges again, a mobile of them, cheap brass and good iron and one that had been rescued from a door that had forgiven many teenagers their curfew. They had been tied together with blue tape, not as an insult but as a sea, and when Zante lifted the thing from its bed of reused tissue, it turned and clicked and produced a music that wanted to be taken seriously. A card fell out, of course it did. The handwriting was the same, the crossbar on the A incredibly proud of itself. On the back: if you refuse to be big I will attach you to everything. It was not a threat and it was not a promise; it was a confession. Zante hung the mobile in the fellowship hall where it would ring every time somebody\u2019s back door opened to let in a casserole. She did it on purpose, and when people commented on how it made them feel clever and also like they were being watched by grammar, she said nothing that would turn it into a sermon because sometimes mothers teach babies to soothe themselves.\n\nIn the evening, because even weeks like this must submit to the tyranny of supper, they ate on the porch, and a neighbor\u2019s cat performed murder in the yard with the shamelessness of a creature that has never been taught to be guilty about its own appetite. Abigail told Zante about a call she had gotten from a student who wanted to argue that art is not responsible for the uses to which idiots put it, and Zante said that while this was technically true it was morally lazy; then she softened and said that love is like that most hours of the day as well. Abigail said she had been tempted to develop a series of non-images\u2014white squares with the word MOUTH handwritten at the bottom, the kind of audacity that would make the city snap photos of nothing and congratulate itself on insight\u2014and Zante said she should do it just to get it out of her system, and then admitted that even she would be tempted to buy one because austerity has always looked aristocratic until you have to live with it.\n\nAfter the plates were put in the sink and the neighbor\u2019s cat had gone somewhere to be terrible in private, Zante sat with the notebook that contained her verbs and she drew a small box on the page and wrote in it: knock. She wrote next to it: kneel. She wrote under it: vow. She drew a tiny hinge under vow because the only way she has ever understood belief is as a series of moving parts that pretend to be whole. She wrote under the hinge: open, and then she closed the notebook because you have to close a notebook on a word like that or it will become presumptuous and invite itself to everything. In the quiet that followed, a drop of rain fell from the gutter long after it had any right to still be there, and in the sound there was a possibility that a rumor would move on and find another town hungry enough to swallow it without chewing. She did not trust possibilities. She accepted them the way you accept a loaf with an uneven crust: with gratitude for its existence and with a knife ready to correct its manners.\n\nClose to midnight, the phone rang, and Boone\u2019s voice arrived at its volume that signals an admission that matters. He said that a custodian at the museum had found a stack of photographs shoved into the mouth of a plaster statue of a woman with an urn because this city will insist on staging its metaphors generously. He said the photographs were throats this time, throats swallowing, throats singing, throats yelling across ballfields, throats with necklaces cheap and inherited and stolen and loved. He said the backs read: call, and under it: answer, and under it, on one: confess. He said there was also a photograph of a hinge mounted to a pedestal with the card that described it like art, and that the card used the word ecclesiastical because Alva had decided to give herself a word she could hide in. He asked if she wanted to come, and she wanted to say no and she wanted to say yes, and because free will is not an on/off switch she told him she would come if he promised to make the museum lights speak softly and not like a courtroom. He said he would try; he is a man who makes promises like that seriously, and that is why she trusts him in the dark.\n\nThey went because of course they did. The museum liked being open for the wrong reasons because it was tired of being open only for the right ones. The custodian, whose name had a vowel the city mispronounced and who did not mind because he had decided to put his pride in other words, showed them the statue and then left them alone because he understood that the room did not need another mouth for ten minutes. The photographs were beautiful in a way that made you want to bite something. Throats lifting, throats relaxed, throats with the soft dip where a pulse makes a map and a promise and a threat all in one. On the back of one, in Alva\u2019s hand: I will not use your town up. The letter A\u2019s crossbar bravely announced its own restraint. On another: I will leave you alone if you admit you needed me, and Zante felt actual anger in her lower back, the kind of anger that you do not allow into your shoulders because it would make them speak violently. She said to Boone, steady, that they would not admit that, not into a microphone and not into hands and not into any room that allowed tape to feel important.\n\nThe museum\u2019s back hallway led to a door that led to a little courtyard with a fountain that had decided decades ago what its sound would be and had never had cause to change its mind. In a corner, a blue cap lay on its side as if someone had apologized to it for the weather. A penny sat on the lip of the fountain and had gone dull because water refuses to let anyone keep their shine very long. Zante put the penny in her pocket without asking permission and told herself it was because metaphors do not get to be left where birds can choke. She looked up because the stars were relevant; they are always relevant when humans are performing, because they refuse to attend and that is a bracing form of criticism.\n\nShe did not sleep much that night and she did not perform not sleeping as a chapel. In the morning, she wore the collar and the dress with the pocket and she wrote in her notebook without making it into a stage. She wrote: open. She wrote under it: I will not build her into a sermon. She wrote under that: I will not forget that coins are money and promises are not currency even if they buy time. She left the house and went to check on the bread for the Saturday feed because people have to eat even when art is staging a revolution, and on the way she passed a boy on a bike and the boy sang the same nonsense song he had sung last week and it made her glad in a way that had nothing to do with language.\n\nAt the church, a package waited that looked like every other package and was not. Inside, a hinge\u2014of course\u2014and a photograph of a mouth that was hers\u2014again\u2014and a second photograph of a mouth that was not hers and that she recognized anyway, not from a mirror but from a life. It was Alva\u2019s mouth, bare and chapped and ordinary and therefore exceptional. On the back, in a steadier hand that had decided not to lean forward today, a sentence without metaphor, and therefore, finally, a gift: I am tired. It is hard to not be named. I work at night on the days your town makes the most laundry. I think you would have liked me if we had met at a dryer and not at a bench. I will leave the rest where it can go to ground. Say a small thing for me that is not about God. It was the first time the letter had been lowercased. Zante read it twice and then again, and then she said the smallest thing she could find, the kind of thing that could not be made into a column or a defense. She said, \u201cThank you for not hurting anyone,\u201d and then she said, \u201cI will not write you any taller,\u201d and then she folded the photograph and put it where she keeps good napkins, because that is where grace belongs in a house that hosts more meals than arguments.\n\nLate in the afternoon, Boone called to say a woman named Alva had come to the station and had asked for him specifically and had sat in the chair like she was the first person to ever do it correctly. He said she had said her name and had said she was done and had placed a stack of photographs on the desk and had looked at him the way a person looks at a doctor with a diagnosis they do not want and will nevertheless memorize. He said she had requested no audience and no panel and no performance, and that he had given her exactly that, and that when she stood up and left she had taken the pennies out of her pocket and put them in the dish by the door we keep for people who believe in exact change. He said there was no arrest to be made, and there was no speech to write, and that he was going to go home and stand under his shower and try to decide whether his body worshipped water or worshipped the idea of washing away a week.\n\nThat night, the house was cooler. The city had collapsed into its summer fatigue the way a person collapses into a couch they inherited and didn\u2019t like at first and then found their own curve in. Zante and Abigail sat on the porch and did the thing couples do who have survived a week of being asked to be more than they are; they guessed the neighbors\u2019 dinners and graded themselves on accuracy. A cardinal made the noise cardinals make when they have imagined themselves more important than other birds and then remembered that air does not care. A car passed with the music loud enough to make the air hold its breath, and then the car went on and the air sighed. Abigail touched the place on Zante\u2019s hand where the pencil always leaves a smudge and asked whether it had a plan to be permanent, and Zante said that smudges are how paper forgives us for trying to be precise.\n\nSomewhere else, a woman in denim took off a jacket she did not need and folded it as if it had a memory she respected. She taped the last of her coins together and then took them apart again and then threw the tape out and then took the tape back because waste makes her feel weak. She put a letter with a crossbar that had softened on a table and under it she put a ring she had not worn because tape and rings want the same fingers. She lay down without making her bed think any particular thoughts about her day. She said nothing about God and nothing about art and nothing about cities and nothing about fists and nothing about mouths. She said a small thing for herself: my feet hurt. Sometimes the body will save your life by forcing you to be literal.\n\nOn Sunday, Zante preached and did not say giant and did not say rumor and did not say hinge as a metaphor. She said, \u201cWe are made of verbs,\u201d and she said, \u201cYou do not owe a performance to people who will eat you,\u201d and she said, \u201cIf you want to stop saying sorry like a hymn, say thank you like a table blessing instead,\u201d and she left space at the end for quiet, the kind of quiet that is not an emptiness but a bowl. Abigail sat in the front and did not photograph; she let her own mouth be the mouth that listens. After, a woman with purple lipstick that was the right shade this time and a denim jacket she had chosen because the air conditioner in her office was a bully asked if there was a potluck and whether she could bring deviled eggs to something, anything, later, and Zante said yes, bring them on Thursday, we will invent a reason.\n\nThat night, under the whale magnet, the list that said no had been nudged by air until its corners curled and it looked like a page that had learned humility. They left it. In the morning someone would open the door and it would lift and fall and someone would say a small thing and someone would say a larger thing and the city would do what cities do, which is to wake up and decide where to put their attention like people decide where to put their hands. Somewhere a hinge would be oiled and somewhere a door would be left to squeal, and in between those sounds there would be a child with a penny and a game and a father who will never again let a giant buy his grief a ticket.",
