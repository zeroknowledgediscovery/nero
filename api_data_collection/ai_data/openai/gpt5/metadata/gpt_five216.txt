The morning tram rang its little bell and the sound threaded through the small flats on Cherry Orchard Road like a child tugging on sleeves. Verity Blake had already been awake half an hour, because that was what living by the line meant – alarms that didn't need a snooze button because glass vibrates at 5:52. She put her kettle on. She glanced into the cupboard. Coffee. Always coffee. She often told people she liked it strong enough to stand a spoon in. Really she liked it because it covered, like a good black coat, everything frayed underneath.

She leaned on the counter and stared at the peeling bit of paint she never got round to sorting. Croydon clouds were low, like someone pressed their hand over the town. You could see the Whitgift Centre’s grey face from her kitchen window if you squinted between the blocks, the boxy geometry of the old place and the cranes which had stopped and started so much it looked as if indecision had been built into the plans. Beyond, a bus sighed. Someone had dropped a kebab on the pavement in the night. She watched a fox inspect it, laugh? no, foxes don’t laugh, then move on.

Work would be the usual. Emails. Meetings. A spreadsheet that was already out of date. She'd open up time-tracking software and think about lying. She never did. It felt the same as standing at a microphone: everyone would see her. She didn't know why singing had become the thing she couldn't stop imagining, except she knew exactly: three weeks ago at East Croydon station a busker had turned four chords into a little piece of prayer and people slowed down. Verity had stood with a paper cup and a paper bag and she had not moved for a whole song while the Tuesday tide passed round her ankles. The girl with the guitar had a voice that cracked on the end of lines and stitched itself right back, like it wasn't a mistake at all. It had put a summer she didn't live through in her mouth.

“Right,” Verity told the kettle when it clicked off. “We’re not going to be ridiculous.”

On the landing she met her neighbour, carrying a laptop bag as if it were a tray of drinks that might tilt. He lived opposite and they’d learned to nod on the third week after she moved in. The first week they'd pretended the other wasn't real; it was Croydon. You don't impose yourself. You let people be the ghost they want to be.

“Morning,” he said, looking up from under hair that always looked like it had been pushed back with his own hand five seconds ago. “You hear them again?”

He meant the family upstairs. Three children who treated their laminate floor like a drum kit. The parents argued in another language and in a rhythm that Verity had come to find comforting. At least the house was lived in, not one of those places where silence gathered in corners like damp.

“Conga line at six,” said Verity. “They’ll be ready for carnival.”

He grinned by pulling one side of his mouth up. She realised she didn't know his name. The sounds of his life came through the wall sometimes – the scrape of something heavy, laughter that started late even for Croydon. He worked irregular hours. Either a paramedic or in IT. Impossible to tell from hair.

“Anyway,” he said, already fidgeting with his key. “Good luck. With Monday.”

“Thanks,” she said, because it was true Mondays needed luck. She told herself she’d ask his name next time. People could live in a eyes-avoidance corridor for years. Then one day something happens and you need them to know how to use your kettle, phone your sister, fetch you a blanket. She would ask next time.

The office was out on the Purley Way, where warehouses tried to look like other things. Verity managed procurement for a packaging company that supplied plastic and paper to other companies that supplied other companies with bubble wrap. In Croydon the economy felt like a chain-link fence. Her desk had a plant that flourished in spite of her, a little succulenty thing she called Basil and never watered enough. The windows faced the IKEA flags that danced wildly when storms came and hung there dull as dishrags the rest of the time. Her boss liked football analogies. He said things like let's play a blinder on this tender and gave a thumbs-up that meant the opposite. She wore a navy suit. Her hair was tied back because it would get in the way and because, recently, the idea of letting it down felt theatrical, like she would have to bow afterwards.

At eleven thirty she stood by the kitchen kettle with Kemi, who could make a packet soup look like a good life choice.

“Heard you were at Boxpark,” Kemi said, stirring in a way that made all the powder disappear from the rim and fold back into heat.

Verity blinked. “What?”

“Or was that another Verity with your shoes,” Kemi teased, glancing down. “With the yellow straps. Saw you Friday, didn't I? Some new craft gin and a bloke with a hat singing Ed Sheeran.”

Verity had, in fact, walked through Boxpark like a woman on a mission who had forgotten what it was. The music had skittered under the containers and people had leaned on railings grinning as if they were at someone’s house. She’d watched a man sing a song she thought she hated, and then the chorus made her throat prickle anyway. She’d stood under a string of lights and read a poster about community choirs like it was a classified ad for a lost dog. Sing For Wellbeing. Monday nights, Fairfield Halls rehearsal room. All welcome, absolutely no audition. She’d taken a photo. She had not told anyone. The poster was still on her phone, as if a photograph made it more private.

“You watch a lot,” said Kemi, not unkind. “You should do a thing. What would your thing be? Don't tell me Excel. You do that here. Not allowed to be your thing.”

Verity surprised herself by saying, “Singing?”

Kemi wrinkled her nose like hot coffee had gone up it. “You? Get out.”

“Why not me?” She made it a joke. She put on Verity the Professional, who could take banter and slice out the sting with two fingers. “I can hum on two notes if I concentrate.”

“Serious?” Kemi tilted her head. “I mean, do it. But you’re brave.”

“Brave,” echoed Martin from Sales as he slid his mug in under the hot tap. “Brave is putting on Crocs to go to your mother-in-law's. Singing is… people will film you if you’re bad. You know that, right?”

Verity turned away before Kemi could jab him with her spoon. She didn't mind being teased if she was already laughing. It was when people said You know that, right? like they were doing you a favour by being cruel with a smile, that her bones went cold.

At lunch she went out along the Purley Way with the vans and found herself at the edge of Wandle Park even though it was in the other direction, because Croydon can fold if you let it, it can give you river where you thought there was only road. She sat with her back on a bench and let a dog tie its lead round her ankles twice and then unwind itself as if by magic. She opened her phone. She opened her photos. The poster's blue and yellow popped on the screen.

No audition.

Absolutely.

She returned to her desk and typed "singing lessons Croydon" into a search bar. She deleted it. She typed "is it too late to learn to sing at 43" and every result was a bright, earnest face telling her never, never too late, at all. She watched an American woman saying You've just got to relax the larynx, honey. Her throat tightened on cue.

In the evening the light fell down Grenaby Road like coins and Verity pushed her unlocked front door open with her shoulder and shuffled inside. The flat was small, everything within arms’ reach from everything else. She took her shoes off and kicked them under the hall table and they skittered out in opposite directions like guilty crabs. She stood in her kitchen and opened a drawer and closed it again. There were nights when cooking felt like somebody dared her to run a marathon with a spoon. There were nights when toast was an ambition.

Her phone pinged: her sister, Eden. Eden had moved to Bromley and told everyone it was Kent. They'd had the conversation about where is London countless times like a particularly dull tennis match.

"You alive? Mum says you didn't call this week," the text said. "Also, if you're around Saturday, the twins have their dance thing. It's a lot of tapping. Bring earplugs and enthusiasm x"

Verity typed: "Work mental. Saturday yes. Earplugs yes. x" Then she added and deleted and added again: "Thinking of doing a choir thing."

The dots blinked. Disappeared. Came back. Eden finally sent: "Since when do you sing?" and then, immediately, "No shade. Honestly. Just didn't know."

She stared at the screen until the words felt like magnets lying north to south, pulling and pushing at the same time.

Someone knocked on the adjoining wall. A light knock, not the kind that says noise complaint. Her neighbour's knock. She suddenly remembered she was humming. Not a song. Just the idea of one.

She went to the door anyway and opened it. He was standing there with his laptop under his arm, the door to his flat still ajar behind him. She could see a pair of trainers and a plant that looked like an out-of-work palm tree. He raised his eyebrows in an apology that didn't yet know what it was apologising for.

“Sorry,” he said. “We haven't properly – I’m Noah.”

Noah. Of course. She tried it on. “Verity.”

“Right. I was going to say, the hot water’s playing up. In my flat. I didn't know if yours…?” He made a face like hot water in Croydon was a philosophical question. “Also, you sing.”

“I don’t,” said Verity, too quickly. “I mean. I might have made a noise similar to the alleged activity.”

He laughed. It was a hand over the mouth laugh, like he’d learned to keep it tidy; then he let it out properly and the corridor warmed. “Cool. Good noise. Hot water?”

She ran the kitchen tap and they both leaned in to watch as if the temperature would be visible. It coughed, spat, ran and then steadied. It was lukewarm. “Use my shower if you need,” she heard herself say, and then wished she had added, obviously not right now. He didn't look like a murderer, but then neither does anyone.

“Thanks,” he said, pushing his hair back again. She noticed he had a scab on his knuckle. People’s hands told on them; she knew this from looking at spreadsheets that metaphorically cut you. “I’m out again in a bit,” he added. “Night shift. At the hospital.”

“Paramedic?”

“Porter,” he said, not sheepish exactly, but something like ready for you to be unimpressed. “It’s good. It’s hard. It makes me forget my own thoughts, for a bit. That’s useful.”

“I like mine too,” she lied. He smiled in a way that said he heard the lie but didn't mind. “Anyway. Good luck with the hot water.”

He pointed at her throat, hovering finger in the general direction. “And that. Good luck with that.”

She shut the door and let her head have a quiet bump against wood. Then she pulled herself back upright and opened her phone and tapped on the photo again and then clicked the tiny blue link. Her thumb hovered over the "Book Now."

No audition. No one would look at her and say you know that, right? because everybody would know nothing. Nobody would. It was a choir that let people like her come in with their gratitude up front.

She completed the online form. She typed her name wrong the first time (Verit). She changed it. She put in her postcode and ticked the box about if she had any medical conditions. She paused on that as if disappointment counted. She put in her card details. The money left her bank. The email came in with a friendly hello and a map attached. Fairfield Halls, the smaller rehearsal room, side entrance, you'll see the sign. Bring water. Everything else is a bonus.

The next day she was a machine. She processed orders. She had opinions on corrugated board. She said yes and no in the right places. She noticed the way the new guy in Accounts watched her like everyone else had a manual and he didn’t. In her lunch break she walked down to Surrey Street Market and let oranges and shouts and a woman selling socks take her mind sideways. She pressed her palm to a mango like it could tell her a secret. She bought cheese without needing it. She whispered lines under her breath that weren't lines, just the nerve that you drag across a note. She went back to the office smelling faintly of other people's spices.

At five she stayed later than she meant to stay because that's what she did, and then the tram lights were prettily ridiculous for a civic vehicle and she put her face to the glass and watched herself distort into a watercolour. The beating thing in her that had been awake since she clicked "Book Now" beat harder. It was all right to want, she told herself. It was all right to be bad at something and still love the doing. Plenty of people had hobbies that made no sense to anyone else. Men in cycling gear, women queuing outside Hobbycraft as if their lives depended on felt. Her thing could be her thing.

Fairfield Halls smelled as if the carpet knew all the plays ever put upon it. The foyer had been done up and was clean, which meant it had lost some of the ghosts and gained some more efficient ones. A cheerful man in a T-shirt that said "Sing For Wellbeing" pointed her down a corridor where voices were already being organised. It had the feeling of a first day of school, but with better shoes. People of all ages. One of those women who always wear scarves. Two teenagers with hair as bright as traffic signals. An elderly gentleman with a tie pinned just off centre. One or two men would get enthusiastic and sing louder than the women for about half an hour, is what her brain predicted. It was rude. She told her brain to shut up.

“Hello!” said the choir leader, clapping her hands once. She was small and blonde and her voice answered to her before anyone else did. “I’m Iris. You are all already good, because you’ve come. If you think you can’t sing, you’re wrong. You can sing. Your shower is not a liar.”

People laughed. Verity breathed out. She hadn't known she was holding a breath large enough to make her ribs ache.

“We’re going to do some warm-ups that might feel silly,” continued Iris, roaming her gaze across them like light. “We’re going to do things that remind your body to work with your voice, not against it. If I see anyone being unkind to themselves in here, I will make them stand in a circle of chairs while I take turns telling them how wonderful they are. That has been a promise and it will be kept. Ready?”

Verity nodded, even though she didn’t feel ready so much as braced. Iris made them shake their hands and flop like fish. She made them sigh. She talked about yawning as if it was holy. The sound in the room changed from an anxious hive of human muttering to actual notes, actual humming. People found themselves.

“Lips,” said Iris, “vibrate them. Motor boat. Pbbbbb.” The room rippled with laughter. “Now, straw. Imagine drinking your note through a straw. Don’t push. Let it rise. We are not soldiers.”

Verity felt something in her chest uncurl and then panic and curl again. When Iris played a simple arpeggio on the keyboard, and the room answered in thirds, Verity opened her mouth and what came out was thin, but it was not wrong. It was a thread. She didn’t know what to do with her hands and put them by her sides like a shop dummy. She looked at the floor, because looking at people while you sang felt like a violation, of them or her, she couldn't tell which.

“Yes,” Iris said, sometime later. To her? To someone next to her? Verity felt greedy, half-hoping the yes was hers. “Slower. Don’t rush the end of the line.”

They sang a song about afternoon light on brick. They sang a hymn that she knew and, somehow, that made it worse. Knowing there was a right way to do a thing and not being quite able to do it. A woman on her left with a cardigan the colour of rain leaned a tiny bit towards her and then away again, like two boats testing the tug of rope.

“First time?” whispered the cardigan woman when they paused for water.

Verity nodded. Her bottle had the price sticker still on. She peeled it off with her thumbnail and a sliver of glue stayed under her nail like skin.

“Me too,” cardigan said. “I’m Farah.”

“Verity.” Her cheeks were hot. “Am I doing it wrong?”

Farah shrugged, the kind of shrug that says we are kinder now that our backs are not teenage and bent under other people’s opinions. “There’s no test. That’s the point. If you want a test, go to church, I guess.”

“People get failed in church?” Verity said. That felt about right.

In the corner a bass line formed, three men doing their best not to show off. Iris introduced a round and made them call and answer, high voices here, lower there, and the music braided. It was easier when she was a bit lost. When she knew exactly where she was, she got in her own way. She noticed how Iris’s eyebrows were their own language: a lift that meant breathe, a tilt that meant be brave, love.

When the hour and a half had done its clever thing and vanished, Iris tapped the keyboard shut, the exit sign hummed a note at a pitch her bones recognised, and applause fluttered the air. People packed away their mouths. Some signed up, some hung back as if they had come on a dare and the dare was over. Verity went to the table and wrote her name for half-term fun. Farah asked if she wanted to get tea. She said yes and meant it. Then she left the building into a Croydon night that had decided to be crisp and forgiving.

On her walk home, under the tram wires and a sky that still hadn't made up its mind about rain, she rang her mother. That automatic call, the thing you do when you've done something you can't name, and you want to hand it to someone who knew you when you were eight and always singing jingle adverts in the back seat of a Vauxhall.

“Hello, love,” said her mother. “Hang on. The oven—hang on.” A clatter, a noise of setting something down, a little swear, then: “Right. You all right?”

“I went to a choir,” said Verity, in one breath. Then she waited.

Her mother made a considering noise. “A church one?”

“No. Sort of. In that we sang a hymn. But no sermons. I did this thing with my lips… pbbbb.” She tried and laughed, which could have been anything down the line to someone who hadn't been in the room.

“Oh,” her mother said, which could have been anything back. “Well, if it makes you happy.”

It was meant kindly and landed like the lid on a Tupperware you couldn't open. Verity took a breath to explain the point was not happy exactly, more like pressure equalised. She didn't have the words. Her mother hurried on. “Your aunt June says her Amy’s boy has a recording studio now. In his garage, would you believe. They do all sorts. Could help with things like that.”

“Like what?”

“Like singing. Making it better.”

“Let's not get carried away,” said Verity, and out of the corner of her eyes she saw herself at ten years old, singing in the school hall, mouth wide, and someone saying good lungs on that one and her mother patting her shoulder like it was time to go home.

When she got back to her building, Noah was sitting on the stairs outside in his jacket, smoking the edge of a cigarette like it was a pencil. He jumped up when he saw her as if he hadn't been sitting, as if he had just been considering the sky from a crouch.

“Hot water's a liar,” he said, nodding towards the flats. “I think it's fixed but it’s fixed in a way that wants me to be cautious.”

“How do you make small talk so dramatic,” said Verity, unlocking. The hallway smelled of someone's toast and somebody else's damp bicycle. “I sang at a thing.”

“Was it good?”

“No one made me stop.” She shrugged. He gave her a half smile that looked like he had it on approval, could give it back if she didn't want it. “Are you ever,” she added before her nerve withered, “a singer?”

“Me?” He seemed honestly startled, which relieved her. It wasn't Hollywood. “I fail to hold a note, I believe. But I like listening. I used to go to gigs. You know, before... anyway.” He gestured at something that tapped at the air and then faded. “We all had a Before.”

“I have several,” she said, and they stood there with their keys in their hands like a ritual.

That week she hummed in the kitchen. It had a tinny echo, the kind you have to grow into. On Wednesday, when she was drying her hair in the morning, she tried to sing along to a song on the radio while the hairdryer roared. She could not hear herself. It was both freeing and terrifying. On Thursday in a meeting, Martin cracked a joke about "our resident songbird" and several people groaned, not at her, but at the laziness of it, or so she told herself. On Friday, Kemi sent her a link to a video of a woman who was seventy and just started lessons; the woman admitted she liked singing because you can't answer email while you breathe like that.

On Saturday at Eden’s, she sat on the edge of the floor watching her twin nieces in tap shoes, and each tiny metal click was another way of keeping time. She clapped. She cheered. Her sister asked about the choir and she told her it was odd and good. Their mother brought up the garage studio again and Eden said, “God, Mum, let her just sing in a hall with some nice OAPs, why does everything have to become a project?”

On Sunday, the light was clean and the street sounded domestic and she stood in the doorway of the room she called the spare bedroom but which had nothing spare about it. Boxes. Clothes. The ex-radiator clunking like it was full of stones. She wanted to sing in it. She couldn't bear to sing in it. She sang in the bathroom instead, which felt safer because tiles lie. Two lines into a folk song she’d never finish and somebody banged on the wall. Her heart went sprinting like a cartoon character leaving dust clouds.

“Sorry,” she called. Her voice lost courage in the hallway. The banging came again. She shut her mouth and pressed her eyebrows with her fingers until the impulse to cry went quiet. It's silly, she told herself. Nobody died. You can be considerate. The family upstairs sometimes dropped shoes like bombs. You forgave them without thinking. Noise is a currency.

Later, Noah texted her. She hadn't even known he’d had her number. He must have got it when she had offered the shower and they'd swapped just in case. He wrote: "Wasn't me. I like it. You can, you know." She smiled at the phone like a teenager and typed “thanks” and then sat there watching her own breath fog the screen.

At the second choir session, Iris made them stand in a circle and sing a vowel around the room, which felt like being hooked onto a ferris wheel and taking turns with the view. Verity managed to forget about herself for a whole minute. Then a woman on the far side sang so beautifully for a fraction of a second that the room inhaled as one. You could see the thing happening; she knew exactly what she was doing, her body was a column, and the note had a shine on it, as if polished by care. There were a few murmured "wow"s and one tiny clap squashed inside someone's hands where they hoped no one would notice.

Iris clapped too, once. “Lovely,” she said. “Now be careful. We’re not here to sit in judgment of each other. We can notice, and admire, and still not let that make us small. Verity?”

The sound of her name like that - thrown gently into the air, caught. Verity looked up. Iris had a way of moving that made you think of hopping from stone to stone.

“Yes?” Verity's body did that thing children's bodies do in class where they scratch their own heads as if a hand puppet had taken over.

“Would you like to lead this next bit? Just the da-da-da. No words, just that. Everyone follows you.”

Verity's brain tried to exit through her ear. Farah whisper-said, You got this, which made everything both worse and better. She nodded. She made her mouth stop being a monologue and set it to da. Da-da-da. And there it was, that thin line turned rope, and for a minute or less the room did what she asked, and she wasn't a manager of packaging who had lost and found herself in emails, she was a person making a thing move with other people. It was so small and so enormous she could have laughed and cried both.

Afterwards, a tall woman with a green coat way too glamorous for practical Croydon came over in the foyer and said, “You’ve got a lovely timbre.” Verity made a face like the word was pepper on her tongue.

“Sorry,” the woman added, laugh like glass. “I used to teach. I can't help it.”

“What does it mean?”

“Colour,” said the woman. “Character. The way wood sounds like wood. Your voice does that. Whatever the note.”

Verity walked home crooked with a smile that wouldn't settle. She stopped at the corner shop. She bought Milk Tray for no reason except the thrill of it and the hope of finding a purple one. She wore her joy like a coat she didn't deserve and looked up in case it got caught on branches.

On Monday morning the joy had turned sour like milk left out. She opened her inbox and it was as if the emails had multiplied on their own, mice in a bin. Her boss had a meeting with a meeting about meetings. Kemi’s laugh couldn't lift the dead weight. Martin said, “Our songbird!” and she rolled her eyes and made the room safe with her irony. On the tram home someone elbowed her and didn't say sorry. She turned her face to the glass and saw herself in the dark. Home was a relief you had to work at.

Just inside her hallway there was a flyer on the doormat. Somebody must have pushed it under from the corridor. It was one of those community newsletter things, except this one didn't look like the usual slick local councillor achievements. It was typed. Actual typed. A wonky header. The sort of thing somebody makes when they're excited and imagine fonts are their friend.

Sing Smart: A Practical Guide for Beginners and the People Who Live With Them.

She blinked, crouched. There was a smiley face drawn in biro just off centre, and the bottom right corner had been folded as if someone had tried to use it as a bookmark. At the side, a phone number and a line: Seen online, printed offline for the real world. The author's name was someone ridiculously internet-sounding: "Voicable.io." She laughed despite herself.

“You dropped this?” she said, when Noah opened his door on the second knock and squinted at paper.

“Is that mine?” He took it, turned it over, let it sit in his hand like a bird. “Maybe. Might be. The internet spat it at me and then my printer did the rest. I didn’t mean to–”

“It was under my door.”

“Oh.” His hair was damp. Shower had worked. He waved the paper like a flag in a country no one else could see. “Sorry. I've been trying not to be… You know. A neighbour.”

“You are a neighbour,” she said. “That’s literally the name of the thing that you are.”

He grinned. “True. Anyway. I… I was curious. About singing. There’s this blog that says you can make a wall of a flat into a collaborator, not an enemy. Tips. It's silly. I shouldn't tell you this. I shouldn't have printed it. I was just – I like knowing how things work, I guess.”

She looked at the header again. Sing Smart. The idea of Grown Man Printing Off Blog Posts made something in her soften twice. “I went back,” she said. “To the choir.”

“You enjoyed it?”

“It was like having access to my own ribcage.” She frowned, embarrassed at her poetic moment. “That’s not a sentence anyone should have to hear.”

“You're allowed,” he said. Then, tentative, like stepping onto ice: “I… If you need someone to hear you practice. I can, you know, put headphones in if it’s terrible. Or say if you’re too quiet to annoy anyone."

She almost said yes. The word hovered, a hummingbird. She remembered the bang on the wall, the sting of it. She said, instead, “I’ll bear that in mind.” She folded the flyer, unfolded it, fussed it into her pocket. “Is your hot water all right?”

“I think we’re at wary peace.”

She shut her door and leaned on it. The thing about doing something other than work was how much it asked. It asked your body and your time and your nerve. It asked you to be rubbish and not quit. There was a reason she had not done this for twenty years. Being good at your job and bad at everything else was comfortable; you knew where you stood. She put the flyer on the kitchen table and sat down. She read: “Tip One: If you’re the one learning, drink water. If you’re the one listening, drink patience.” She smiled and felt foolish and, briefly, unfixed.

That night, because the wind made the building whistle and her bones felt less fragile, she sang again. Half a song. Not much. A ribbon of melody that stuck to the ceiling and then slid off. She imagined it like the smell of baked bread, lingering, making the space kinder to return to. No banging. Someone upstairs dropped something heavy and then laughed, and the sound gave permission. She filled a glass and drank and sang and then stopped, because you should leave wanting more, even when it’s your self you’re trying to sell on the idea.

On her way to bed she looked at the boxes in the spare room and thought of unstacking them, laying a carpet, making a place to stand without apology. She thought of Iris’s eyebrows and the moment the yes had landed in the room. She thought of her mother saying if it makes you happy. She thought of the girl at East Croydon with the cracked-not-cracked voice. She brushed her teeth and spat the sudden taste of metal out.

In the morning, the tram rang and her alarm app chimed like a polite friend, and Verity stretched and listened to the world arranging itself. She put on a blouse that had felt wrong for months and it felt fine. She made coffee. She texted Kemi that she would be in at nine-thirty because she'd wake early and then wander, maybe, through a little of Surrey Street first, look at vegetables she could name and some she couldn't. The day stood in front of her like a door she might push. She hummed. She wouldn't call it singing. Not yet. But hello was there, just under her tongue, waiting its turn.Chapter 3

By Tuesday the air had given up pretending it was spring and resumed its usual Croydon grey. Verity watched condensation sketch faint fern patterns on her kitchen window and tried to decide whether nerves were the same thing as excitement wearing a different coat. She had slept in fits, the sort where your brain conducts meetings you don’t remember calling, and woke with mouth dry and throat tight and the sudden panic that she had dream-sung loudly at three in the morning and the whole building had heard. It was just pipes settling. The family upstairs had done their six a.m. parade as advertised. Noah had texted a photograph of a kettle with the caption ceasefire, which made no sense unless you were both thinking of boilers as war criminals, and she found herself smiling in a way that felt oddly disloyal to the version of herself who had spent the last year keeping emotions flat to avoid disappointment.

Work rushed in the way water finds every crack. A supplier in Leicester had missed a drop. A client in Mitcham had decided that the correct dimensions for their boxes were the dimensions of their dreams rather than the realities of pallet sizes. Her boss stuck his head round her pod and said let’s put our heads on this and then delivered a metaphor about nailing it top bins that made Kemi mime a red card when he left. By eleven, Verity had typed the same phrase three times and was unpicking a sentence from the middle like knitting, tugging until it fell into its own lap. Her inbox insisted that the world was on fire and wanted cardboard, and everything she did to fix one small blaze made two small blazes elsewhere feel newly offended.

At lunch, Kemi spun in an office chair the way no adult should who wants to keep their dignity and said, “The choir’s doing something at the Whitgift on Saturday. Iris emailed, didn’t she? Community wellbeing day. Do you get a badge? Can I get a badge? I love a badge. Tell me you’re going. I’ll come and clap. I clap for free.”

“I don’t know if I can stand still in a shopping centre and not think about how much of my life that is,” said Verity, torn between horror and thrill. “But yes. I think I have to do it because my body has decided that I do.”

“Your body is welcome,” said Kemi, pointing with a teaspoon like an officiant. “Also, Martin says he’s bringing his girlfriend because she loves choirs but hates him, so you’ll get one out of two friendly faces.”

“I don’t want Martin’s girlfriend to be my audience proxy,” said Verity, but she wrote the time into her phone calendar anyway. The act of typing the numbers steadied her. 12:00–12:30, Whitgift Atrium, Sing For Wellbeing. Bring water, self, patience.

On the tram home that evening she saw the busker at East Croydon again. She was perched on her fold-out stool like she had learned to fold herself too, guitar case open with coins like small suns winking up. The four-chord prayer returned, not the same song but the same trick of making the space turn its head and listen. This time the girl’s hair was under a beanie and her cheeks were chapped, and she had a sticker on the body of the guitar that said THIS MACHINE BUILDS COMMUNITIES. Verity stood in the shadow of the timetable board pretending she was checking connections. When the song ended, she went up because she had felt the brush of that afternoon three weeks ago for long enough, and if she didn’t say something now she would re-run this moment until it spoiled.

“I like the bit where your voice cracks and then doesn’t,” she said, holding a coin like a peace offering and sounding exactly like a person who hadn’t spoken this sentence out loud before.

The busker squinted as if calibrating the compliment. “That’s because I can’t seem to stop doing that,” she said, grin quick and unbothered. “People always think it’s trauma or technique. Sometimes it’s just a throat being a throat. You sing?”

“Barely,” said Verity, to under-promise to the gods. “A choir. Monday nights. Fairfield.”

“Good,” said the busker. She had chipped nail polish the colour of petrol. “Oval Tavern does an open mic Sundays. You don’t have to sign up. You can just sit and drink a Guinness and pretend you’re not going to and then, you know, possibly do one anyway. If you want to. If you don’t, fine. Keep singing in whatever room is kind to you.”

“Thank you,” said Verity, which wasn’t exactly about the open mic. The busker nodded like she'd issued a receipt and returned to her chords, and the station resumed its churn. Verity tucked the option of the Oval Tavern somewhere between terror and a future self she didn’t know well enough to trust.

Noah was at his door when she got in, keys on a lanyard he whirled on one finger like a trick he didn’t want to own. There were fines for that much swagger in a shared hallway, probably written on a laminated sheet in a cupboard somewhere. His scrub top was half tucked, half not, which made him look like a nurse played by a handsome actor in a show that got hospital procedure wrong on purpose. He leaned as if the doorframe had opinions.

“How’s your wall,” he said, as if everyone had a relationship status with plasterboard.

“I’m making friends,” said Verity. She lifted the Sing Smart flyer that she had folded into quarters and unfolded again until the crease had its own personality. “Tip Four was alarming. ‘Ensure breath isn’t just panic in a tuxedo.’ I didn’t know advice was allowed to be rude.”

“They’re trying to be cool,” he said, which suggested the kind of patience that had been battered into him by the internet. “I printed out Tip Seven for my mate who lives next to a drummer. It said, ‘If you’re the neighbour, remember you chose a building full of humans, not a monastery. Humans make things.’ He stuck it to his microwave.”

“I’m going to make my spare room into a place my voice is allowed to exist,” said Verity, because if she said it she might do it. “Not a studio. But a bit less hard surfaces. Another neighbour-friendly zone. Do you want to stand about while I drag a rug from Ikea and swear?”

“I finish at nine,” he said, glancing at his phone as if time could be coaxed. “I’ll help after. I’m good at moving things that are objectively not heavy but somehow feel like you are asking them to betray their families.”

At choir that week, Iris came in with a tote bag that said THERE IS NO PLAN B, ONLY QUIET PRACTICE and a thermos that made Farah whisper bet it’s soup. Iris set them off on a round that went wrong so beautifully the first time you would have thought she did it on purpose to loosen them. She introduced the Whitgift set as if it had always been obvious: two songs warm and simple, one a bit of a stretch, all with the kind of harmonies you could learn with your hands as much as your head. Verity dreaded and adored the moment she had to hold a line that wasn’t the tune; it was like walking on a low wall with people jeering gently on the pavement, except the people were you and the jeering was just your fear of falling into melody.

“Inner voices,” Iris said, pointing at the Alto II cluster as if she could see the would-be self-saboteurs. “You are the glue. You are the ribbon. You think we can live without you because we often don’t know your names. You’re wrong. If you go, everything is suddenly too obvious and too clean. I need your doubt to become stubbornness. Imagine your line like a path only you can see and make us walk it by walking it.”

The line Iris gave them was three notes and a step down like a sigh, then a surprising leap that made a little square in the air. Verity’s mouth wanted to resolve to the tune. Her jaw ached with the effort of not doing the expected thing. Farah caught her eye and lifted a shoulder as if to say we’re in this silly boat and we will make the river anyway, and on the third run, Verity’s body learned enough to not betray her. The sound braided and she felt the tiny click everyone felt when alignment happens, like a zip engaged without snag.

At the break the woman in the green coat reappeared in a more sensible cardigan and told Verity her name was Marianne. Up close, she had a face that had smiled a lot out of habit and sometimes also because it felt right, a difference Verity recognised in herself these days.

“I taught for years,” said Marianne, tugging at a loose thread on her sleeve, “but I prefer this. The bit before anyone decides they deserve it or not. Will you tell your mother?”

“I told her,” said Verity, thinking of Tupperware lids that don’t sit. “She said, ‘If it makes you happy.’ Which is fine, but also turns me into a mood ring.”

“My mother used to say ‘don’t show off’ when I hummed,” Marianne said, laughing without malice. “It was the seventies. We considered joy a finite resource.”

After choir, Verity and Farah sat on the low wall outside Fairfield with paper cups of tea and let the night be its own song. Farah told a story about coming to Croydon ten years earlier because her ex-husband had got a contract and then leaving two years later but forgetting to take herself with her. She gestured with her cup and said that returning to music felt like finding a library card in a coat you thought you’d given away. Verity didn’t quite tell her why she had avoided noise for most of adulthood, which was not a story but a sequence of small choices piled like bricks until they made a wall you called a personality. She did not say that sometimes she had experienced desire as a door marked do not enter in her own flat, and that singing felt like she’d finally ignored a sign.

Noah arrived at nine-twenty because lives never occur exactly when he says. He took his jacket off and over his arm there was a roll of something soft and ridiculous that turned out to be spare moving blankets pilfered from a store cupboard at the hospital. He held them up like a magician and said, “We wrap patients’ furniture in these when we move wards. I figured if we can make a cabinet quiet we can make your wall behave.”

They set to it. The spare room was an annex of postponed decisions. Boxes labeled winter and do not open and one labeled nothing that made Verity suspicious of her past self’s sense of humour. She pushed the bedframe against the wall and laid a rug that had lived rolled up since her last flat, and Noah erected a makeshift curtain rail from a broom handle and two chair backs like a man who had been a child with dens. He draped a blanket, another, a third, until the corner looked as if someone had put a tent up for gossiping under. They tested the difference by clapping, by humming, by speaking, and the echo dulled obediently.

“This is so silly,” she said, stepping into her new soft corner and feeling her voice touch different parts of her face. “I love it.”

“Good,” he said, and perched on the former spare bed like a guest at a ceremony. “Say something to it that you wouldn’t have said yesterday.”

“Hello,” she said, because the day had been storing it on her tongue. Then, catching his eye, she sang it half under her breath on three notes she’d been made to drill, the sigh-step and the square that Iris had embedded into her bones. It came out not pretty but true enough, and the room held it like cupped hands.

After he left, she stood in the doorway with the light off and felt the weight of the day rearrange itself. She made a list on her phone not because she was the kind of person who loved lists but because lists sometimes kept you from dissolving. It said: water, breathe, glue not tune, Whitgift Saturday, invite Kemi, ask Eden, leave Mum alone, say thank you to the busker if you see her, do not apologise for existing. The last item felt like the kind of thing Instagram would tell you in pastel, but she typed it anyway, because the opposite message had arrived in her life in proper ink over many years and never asked permission.

Saturday came sideways, wearing the tired finery of a long week’s end. She had ironed the choir’s suggested colour scheme top, which was teal, a colour she owned because one year every woman of a certain age in Croydon had decided teal was flattering. On the tram she felt herself absurd and wanted to laugh, and then she decided to let the absurdity be a door rather than a wall. Surrey Street was alive with the kind of shouting that is not anger but a way to persuade aubergines to sell themselves, and she took a moment to buy apples she didn’t need and ask the man two stalls down about the enormous squash shaped like a Victorian cushion. He called it a crown prince and told her it was good roasted with patience and oil. She smiled and thought of patience and oil as if they might also help with choir.

Whitgift was like a ship permanently moored, a place designed to make money whisper and then change hands. The atrium had the acoustics of a tiled bathroom with a job, better than a car park worse than a church. Iris stood on the second step of the grand stair and made short declarative gestures at the choir until they corkscrewed into some sort of formation. Verity’s eye found Kemi near the smoothie bar in a yellow hoodie like a warning flag. She raised both arms overhead and did a ridiculous wiggle, and Verity felt rescued by the image of skeletons dancing. She couldn’t see Eden yet and assumed that meant she had brought the twins and they were in a toilet applying too much pink to their mouths.

They warmed up by pretending to yawn and strangers looked at them like a flash mob had malfunctioned. A man paused with a trolley and let the toddler inside it bang a wooden spoon on the handle in time with nothing at all. Iris turned to face them, her eyebrows set to careful optimism, and lifted a hand that said remember the bit where you decided you wanted to turn up. The first song was a simple one about being in a place together and not needing to be more than that. The inner line went under and around, like tide, and Verity felt her voice find its lane. There were voices around her that were clearer, bolder, more sure of where to place their mouths on a vowel, but she could feel the way her sound filled someone else's gap and someone else’s sound propped her up where she would otherwise sag, and it was like carrying a sofa with six strangers and getting it through a door.

They finished the first song and a handful of people clapped and one person who had intended to clap forgot because their hands were full of shopping, and Verity found that the thin thing inside her that had always measured her worth by the response of strangers had nothing to say because her body had gone busy doing breath. The second song was the stretch one, and she bent with it and nearly cracked when she let her throat tighten on the leap, then remembered Iris saying drop your affections into your belly and felt the lift happen like a trick she didn’t own yet. Out of the corner of her eye she saw two small girls in sequins attempting to mirror the mouth shapes, and when she checked directly she found Eden perched with a pram handle in both hands like reins and the twins doing an exaggerated opera vibrato that made the man next to them snort.

On the last song, there was a moment that she might file away under Not Yours Forever But Today. The sound was not grand or perfect, but there was a shading in it, a collective decision that the line would carry a little more meaning than it did on paper, and Verity felt the hair on her arms stand as if her skin had heard all this before and was grateful. Iris dropped her hand with an abruptness that made laughter catch in the applause and then the applause made itself bigger to compensate. A woman filming from the balcony above did that thing where she moved the phone as if it were a torch and the choir some kind of deer. Verity felt ridiculous and beloved and fully in a public place, and she remembered the busker and the station and the sensation of time thinning, and for once the day didn’t slide off her like a brochure’s promise.

They were released back into the building that sold watches and shoes and noodle soups. Kemi descended on her, two smoothies swinging like church bells and a grin that could have been used for lighting. “You were not terrible,” she pronounced, which was Kemi for I am proud. “Also your sister’s children have pitched you at Wembley and are demanding a tour bus.”

“They have a future as managers,” said Verity, catching a straw and tasting banana too ripe to pretend. “Thank you for coming. I know you had better things to do than stand next to a frozen yogurt franchise and clap.”

“No,” said Kemi, tilting her head, considering something serious for once. “I had worse things to do, like hoover, and also you’ve looked thinner for weeks, and not in the way you want a person to look thinner, and now you look like your organs have names again. So forgive me if I keep showing up near your voice.”

She did not cry because crying in the Whitgift felt like something featured on the Croydon Guardian under a headline starting with Outrage. She hugged Kemi instead and let the twins take her hand and show her a fountain and demand she jump in with them even though it would mean wet shoes and a telling off from security. Eden kissed her cheek and said Mum keeps sending me links to microphones and I keep ignoring her and also, for what it’s worth, you looked like you were telling the right kind of secret.

When she got home, she found a square of paper propped under her door. It was the Sing Smart guide again, but a different page, in Noah’s now recognisable printout font, with his scribble in pen on the margin: Tip Nine: Harmonising in Community. The printed paragraph said something about the courage of the middle parts and the gift of not being the melody, and in the space he had written, Hope the moment felt like yours even though it belonged to everyone. If you need help unboxing the life you packed away, knock.

She knocked. He opened in socks and an old gig T-shirt and a face that had spent a day moving other people’s broken things and needed a place to put his own. She told him about the fountain and the boy in the trolley and the way the third bar wouldn’t sit, and he told her about a woman who had sung quietly to her father in a corridor because there hadn’t been time to get him a bed, and how the song had made the fluorescent light hum a friendlier pitch for thirty seconds. He said before he had worked in a hospital he had thought music was an extra, the sort of thing life had on at the weekend, and now he thought if you took it away your bones might forget what to do.

They went into her spare room because it had been waiting to be used for something other than apology. The blankets held the air without making it coffin-like. She picked up the paperback she had used to weight the corner and found between pages a photograph of herself at ten, mouth wide, hair fiercely plaited by a hand you could not see and stance like someone had put roots in her trainers. On the back a teacher had written in green pen, Good projection, could listen more when others read. The note made her laugh in a way that nudged against tears and refused them with kindness. She would take good projection now and she would also listen more, but she wanted, very much, the part where the mouth opened and nothing in the room told it not to.

She sang then, not a full song, not list-making or note-getting, but the progression Iris had given them, the sigh and the square, and then a run of vowel that belonged to the hymn and the pop song and all the useless singing she had done into kettles and bike locks and late-night windows. Noah closed his eyes like a man in a cinema and sat carelessly back on his hands, and when she stopped he didn’t clap because clapping felt wrong in a kitchen, so he nodded instead, once, with a seriousness that gave the moment its due.

On Sunday she did not go to the open mic at the Oval Tavern because she wasn’t that person yet and also because she had promised to help Eden sew sequins back on two costumes that had decided commitment was for other people. She made tea at Eden’s and tried not to stab herself with the needle, and when the twins showed her a routine that was really stomping with personality, she whooped as if inventiveness could be rewarded the same as accuracy. On the way back, she got off the tram two stops early and walked past the Minster where the bells sometimes practised and let the sound fill the street in a way that made cars look apologetic. She thought of Marianne, of Farah, of Iris and those eyebrows like punctuation that saved sentences, and of the busker who had told her to pick a room and claim it. The room didn’t always have to be a room. Sometimes it was a corner of a shopping centre or a landing with a neighbour laughing into his sleeve.

When she unlocked her door, the building had that Sunday quiet where everyone made soup at once. She put a pan on the hob because she had been told to drink water and eat something green. Her phone buzzed and it was her mother with a photograph of a microphone on sale at a supermarket, the caption, Thought of you, and an emoji that meant pride if you wanted it to and also meant I am unsure how much you want me involved. Verity looked at it and thought yes and no at the same time, and then she typed, Not yet, and added a heart because hearts sometimes help the part of a message that says please wait.

Later, in the tented corner, she unpacked one of the boxes labeled nothing. Inside was a jumble of paper and receipts and a tape with a label that said V Blake Yr 6 Solo, which she didn’t own a player for anymore. She sat on the floor with her back against the bed and let her throat be a throat. The tram rang in the distance like someone tugging the day along. The tips from the printout lay face down, and she did not need to read them to remember the one that mattered. If you’re the one learning, drink water. If you’re the one listening, drink patience. She had both at hand, and the simple enormity of that felt like progress.Chapter 4

Tuesday put its head down and rained properly. Croydon rain isn’t romantic; it’s the kind that takes up space like a person on a packed tram with a rucksack. Verity watched it herd itself along the sill while the kettle got on with being itself. The new soft corner in the spare room had made the flat feel like it had a throat. In the morning her voice lived lower than she expected; she had not known until this week that you could wake up and have a different instrument. She hummed something like a staircase and listened to the way her sound blurred and then sharpened as the tea softened her. The family upstairs let a football roll end to end and you could hear the stickered patches where the floor caught and stuttered.

There was a flyer under her door again when she opened for the post: Sing Smart, another page, damp around the edges like it had tried on the weather and decided against it. Tip Ten: Morning voice is innocent. Don’t ask it to do adult work yet. In the margin, Noah’s pencil said, Mine sounds like a bee stuck in a bottle until eleven. Don’t panic. She could see him leaning on his kitchen counter writing that and felt absurdly steadied, as if someone had adjusted the dial of her day to not quite manic.

Work arrived, as it did, with the grace of a tide that thinks it’s a god. A supplier had been taken over by a supplier and the new owner had ideas about the word partnership that meant tell us everything for less. Her boss attempted a rugby metaphor that involved scrums and then realised halfway through that none of them had consented to sport entering their day and backed out with hand signals. Martin looked pale in a way that might have been a hangover or might have been the realisation that he would be an adult for fifty more years. Kemi had found a tea that tasted like a flowerbed but insisted it made her kind, and the office air con did its usual impression of being either a desert or a meat locker, no middle.

At eleven, an email arrived from Iris. Subject: Little singing, big hearts. The message was simple: the hospital—Croydon University Hospital, which people still called Mayday if they wanted to sound like they’d been round long enough to remember Woolworths—had asked if a small group could come at lunch on Thursday and sing by the staff canteen. No microphone, no fuss. If you can, excellent. If not, also excellent. No auditions because we don’t do that here. She promised to choose gentle songs and bring the keyboard that only sometimes played B flat like it meant it. The reply-to list started filling with yes, yes, sorry can’t this week, yes but late, yes if I can stand at the back where my anxiety can’t see me. Verity read it three times and then closed her browser because action gives anxiety fewer windows to knock at.

She thought of Noah on a corridor, the blue-edged scrubs, the way his hands had a scab she watched without trying to. She thought of fluorescent lighting and how it gets into your mood like dust. She typed yes and pressed send before she could refine the tone until it didn’t sound like her.

At lunch, Kemi rolled over on her chair like a person at sea and read the email over her shoulder because boundaries in their office were theoretical. “That’s wholesome,” she said. “Do they give you a sandwich?”

“Witness statements suggest some form of tray,” said Verity. “Want to come and clap like a lunatic again? You can call it outreach.”

“I’m flirting with a man on the deli counter,” said Kemi, dignified. “Thursday lunch is when I ask intelligent questions about coleslaw. But yes, I’ll nip over. I will be the coleslaw queen of applause. Are you all right? You look like you’ve been dared.”

“I have been dared,” said Verity, not entirely joking. “By myself. I accepted on my own behalf. I want to throw up but in a nice way.”

On her way home she detoured without thinking past East Croydon, the flurry of pigeons doing their impression of importance by proximity to movement. The busker was there, hair out from under beanie this time, a scarf that tried to look warm and failed. The guitar case was emptier than she wanted it to be. Verity stood two songs and put two pounds in and said nothing. It wasn’t a rule that you had to narrate the places where strangers walked your brain into a new room. Sometimes your gratitude could be as quiet as coins.

Noah’s door was cracked in a way that meant he was home between things. She could see a stack of blue paper towels on the radiator that he’d declared an airing shelf and a mug that said It’s not brain surgery and a line drawn through the not. He looked up as if he’d been expecting this exact knock and smiled with one side because the other side had been at work.

“Hospital,” he said, when she told him. “Which bit?”

“Canteen,” she said. “Which is worse than a ward because people are still pretending to be normal. Do you know the bit?”

“I know all the bits,” he said, not showing off, just inventory. “Don’t stand under the TV if you can help it. It buzzes at a note you won’t like. And stand so that if a trolley goes by no one has to wedge their hips between a lyric and a baguette. There’ll be someone who’s having the worst day of their life on a plastic chair with their coat still on. There’ll be someone glued to their phone who will cry afterwards and tell you your singing made the ceiling less cruel. There’ll be one person who hates you because they hate anything that isn’t control. And someone will drop a fork. All of these things are real. None of them mean don’t sing.”

“I wish I had a handbrake for how fast my heart is,” she said, and he pointed at the printout on her table like a conjuror reminding you where the dove had been hiding.

Tip Eleven: Stage fright is just love dressed as alarm.

“You always give me the ridiculous ones,” she said, amused.

“They all sound ridiculous until you’ve survived them,” he said, and there was a look in his eye like he had a list of his own. He hesitated, as if he had more he could make into words and had decided to spend the day’s last ones on her instead of saving them. “If you sing near where I am, I’ll come and pretend to do stock checks on the water cooler. We have clipboards. Very official.”

It rained until Wednesday and then it didn’t. That’s how Croydon did kindness: abruptly, so you felt you had done something to deserve it. The choir met in the Fairfield again and practised songs that had been designed to behave. Iris said the point wasn’t to fix anything; the point was to make oxygen out of noise.

“We will be standing in a rectangle,” Iris said, as if that had philosophical weight. “Hospitals are full of rectangles. We respect that. Shoulders back. Not because posture is moral but because breath likes a shelf to sit on. We will sing with our faces. Remember. No one needs your heroics. They need your timing. Don’t rush. And if someone walks past with a tray of chips, you don’t get to be jealous out loud.”

There were nine of them for Thursday, enough to be a presence but not enough to get in the way of the sandwiches. Iris handed out parts without fanfare. Verity ended up on the inner line again because someone had to be glue. At the end of rehearsal, as they were putting music into folders and pretending the word folder wasn’t funny if you said it enough times, Iris stopped her with a hand on her elbow. The touch was brief and practical and suddenly Verity wanted to cry in the way of people who have been brave for slightly too long.

“I’m going to ask you to do a thing,” Iris said. “At the hospital. There’s a call-and-response in the second song. It’s low, it sits where you like to live. Can you call? It’s not a solo in the sense that you’re alone, it’s you asking a question the others answer. Which, arguably, is more terrifying. But when you did the da-da-da you made the room move with you. I noticed. Say no if no.”

The word no queued up with its excuses. It put on a coat. It picked up its bag. Something equally impertinent got to the doorway first. “Yes,” said Verity, and the no had to sit down again and wait its turn. The yes made a little space under her ribs where air found it could stay a bit.

That night her mother called her first, a rare thing. “Saw Eden’s video,” her mother said. “Of you in that place, the shopping. You looked nice. I liked the blouse. You always suit greeny-blue.”

“Teal,” said Verity, dutiful child of the church of women who know the names of colours. “We’re singing at the hospital tomorrow.”

“Oh, love,” her mother said, meaning a number of things at once. “If you catch anything, will you tell me. Wear a scarf.”

“It’s not a nineteenth–” Verity began, then stopped because facts weren’t the point. “I’ll be in a corner. We won’t breathe on anyone. That isn’t the kind of singing we do.”

Her mother was silent for a second, in the way of people deciding whether to try their older person trick of telling you something you already know. “Your Aunt June says Amy’s boy can put reverb on things. Makes them sound richer.”

“That’s wonderful for Amy’s boy,” said Verity, and put the kettle on as if the sound of boiling might break the weirdness of being alive together. “This is different.”

“You sound alive,” her mother said, and then hurried on because she had said something too naked without intending to. “Oh—Margery from number nineteen fell, but she’s fine, she says, the steps are a menace, and we’re thinking of a handrail, your father says he’ll do it and I said I will buy one that isn’t an embarrassment. Right, I’ll let you get on.”

On Thursday she put on clothes that could pass for ordinary and shoes that understood standing. She met the little choir by the main entrance, where volunteers with lanyards sat at a table of leaflets that promised wellbeing as if it were a product you could buy in a specific shade. The hospital smelled precise: disinfectant and gravy, breath and printing ink. The tannoy coughed and said something only staff would understand. The ceiling tiles were the same ones that watch every crisis, patient as clouds. Iris did her eyebrow trick and handed out pep like it was free.

They stood by the canteen entrance, away from the draught of the automatic doors that liked to show off by opening without being asked. A woman in a consultant’s badge walked past fast, like she was drilling holes in time, and winked at Iris as if to say thank you for trying. A cleaner leaned on her mop and looked blessedly bored. The keyboard made its tiny tinny intro and then stopped because someone had kicked its plug and Farah fixed it with a competence that made Verity want to buy her something useful and red.

They sang a song about a road that wanted you to be brave and not foolish. They sang a song that stole its bones from a lullaby and dressed it in fairground lights. The first call-and-response came and Iris cut her off from safety with a glance. Verity stepped forward a fraction, a movement none but the choir would notice, and let her mouth do the small square Iris had taught into it. She called a question that wasn’t a question, just a line that needed answering. The answer came back rich from eleven voices that had nothing in common but breath. A light somewhere flickered and then gave up the effort. A kid in a wheelchair looked up from a tablet and stared, not with gratitude but with curiosity, which was better. Next to him, a woman in a puffer jacket was crying in the way that meant she had been for a while already and this was just the drumroll. A man in scrubs put his head against a vending machine like it might hold a solution. There was a fork drop at the exact wrong moment and it became exactly right because they were exactly here.

She saw Noah in the doorway, half hidden by a trolley he didn’t need to move, a clipboard like a prop. He didn’t wave. He put the pen to the paper as if ticking this off some list made it real. His face wore its work-day, which was not kindness exactly but the thing you needed to let kindness happen without breaking you. His eye met hers for a second that had the quality of a window; you could see through to the next part.

In the second verse, the fluorescent buzz managed to land on the exact frequency that made everyone’s teeth hate them. Iris tilted the keyboard and swore softly in a language made of eyebrows and looked at the security guard who had come to check no one was planning to wheel out cutlery. He shrugged permission at the socket. Farah caught the plug with the curly wire and twisted so it sat like it meant to. The buzz dropped a note. Someone cheered because small victories are popular.

At the end there was the usual elastic applause, thin in places and loud in one corner where someone was relieved to have anything to do with their hands. A man in a cardigan with a sandwich in clingfilm came up and said my wife loved that song and I hated it but now I think I don’t hate it, which was the kind of review you only got in buildings where death visited in the afternoons. A nurse with sleeves rolled up to her strong elbows wiped her eyes and said sorry, it’s been, and didn’t finish the sentence because the sentence was the corridor. The cleaner gave them all a look like she was measuring their nonsense and found it sufficient.

Noah edged nearer with the trolley like a timid whale and said, to Verity, with the tone of a man asking about a comma in a report, “That was a good decision with your jaw on the leap.” He had watched, then. He knew where the hard bit was because he knew her face as well as what she sounded like now. “We were in old AAU earlier,” he added, as if continuing a conversation they had not had. “The family had a hymn. Not the one you sang. A different one. Nobody knows the words past the first verse of any of them. It didn’t matter. You made two people breathe who hadn’t remembered how since nine this morning. I’m counting.”

“It felt rude,” she said, and he nodded. “To sing in a place where… this… happens. And also rude not to.”

“Everything good feels rude until we get used to it,” he said. “Come and drink something terrible.”

They sat on plastic chairs in the canteen that smelt of chip fat and milk steamer, and Iris distributed thanks like biscuits. Marianne, cardigan precise, appeared with a tray that contained tea, tea, tea and one coffee for the keyboard because it had done a lot of emotional labour. Farah put her head on Verity’s shoulder for a second in a way that would have been too intimate anywhere else and fit perfectly here.

“Don’t make this your identity,” Iris murmured, once the others had been harvested by their belongings. “The hospital thing. Let it be a thing you did and do. Your voice is a person who gets to travel, not a volunteer’s badge.”

“I was going to put ‘saviour’ on my LinkedIn,” said Verity, dry, and Iris threw her a look that said I know people who have.

Back at the office, Kemi pushed her way in around two and mouthed sorry at a cluster of elderly printers before swanning up to Verity’s desk. “I cried,” she announced. “If one more person cries at me in the Whitgift I’m charging. But this was free. One of your eyebrows did a brave thing I intend to copy. I waited for a solo.”

“Not a solo,” said Verity, a reflex now. “A call.”

“Fine,” said Kemi, relenting as if definitions mattered. “A call. I called back.”

That evening, the sky tried for pink at the edges and ended up more like the inside of a tin. Verity stood in her doorway longer than she needed, the hallway smell of toast and damp bicycle a comfort. There was no new printout under her door. She missed it and found that sweet and faintly ludicrous. She went into the tented corner and sang the call once, under her breath, because things that have worked in public become monsters at home until you say their name.

On Friday, the office had biscuits and the particular mania that comes before a weekend. Martin sent round a calendar invite to an internal “talent at lunch” thing because HR had decided that humans doing human things could reduce attrition in Q3. Kemi fired her a glance that meant we are both absolutely not doing this and also we absolutely will. Verity pressed decline and then wrote Iris’s phrase—your voice gets to travel—on a sticky note and stuck it inside a folder so it would surprise her later.

On Saturday morning, she cleaned the kitchen in a precise, efficient way that meant she was avoiding something. She took the tape labelled V Blake Yr 6 Solo out of the box labeled nothing and put it in a drawer where she couldn’t see its accusation. She put on the radio and turned it down low so she could sing with and not at. She recorded herself on her phone, once, just the way she had been taught to record: phone propped on a mug, back straight, mouth not trying too hard. She listened back and felt the first jolt of who is that and I hate her, and then the second jolt of but there, in the middle, you can hear something you own. Her voice sounded older than she imagined, which was to say it sounded like her. It was less pretty than her brain’s version and much kinder. She messaged Marianne a thank you for the word timbre and Marianne sent back a thumb and a photo of a cat on sheet music like a visual pun.

On Sunday she went past the Oval Tavern at four o’clock as if she had always arranged to be in the area. The sign outside said Open Mic from 7, all welcome, kindly audience, one song minimum, and someone had drawn stars round the word kindly. She went in because the sun had dared to be out and the doorway made sense. It smelled of carpet and old jokes. A man with hair like a record executive in the eighties stood by a list on a clipboard and said, “Name?” without pressure. She put a finger on the paper as if checking it was real. She wrote V Blake and immediately regretted it because names on paper are public; then she added a tiny tilde on the e as if to make herself unfindable. The man said, “Just one? Everyone does one to start. You can leave before you do the second. It’s in the contract.” She said maybe and meant not yet and went home with the knowledge in her pocket like contraband. She didn’t tell anyone. She didn’t even tell the soft corner.

The busker was at the station again in the evening under the departure boards that lied less on Sundays. Verity stopped because rituals only turn into burdens if you make them. The sticker on the guitar about building communities had developed a peel at one corner, and the busker was picking it without noticing. “Oval’s good,” she said to Verity between songs, as if she had been inside Verity’s head all week. “Nobody dies if you’re flat. The landlady is a soprano and will love you even if she looks like she will steal your wallet for the thrill. Come not tonight. Come next week. Practice in your bathroom. Bathrooms forgive. Sing to the tile.”

“I made a tent,” said Verity, too proud of the blankets and their ridiculous kindness. “In my spare room. For corners to happen in.”

“Look at you,” said the busker, grinning. “Engineer of air.” She played a chord like a shrug and sang a line about walking past windows and not stopping and about stopping and what that does to your day, and Verity thought, if words were weather she would pack a coat for this.

That night the family upstairs had friends. Shoes in and out. Laughter like glass dropped on carpet. A child cried once and was comforted immediately, the way that teaches your tissue something even if you’re not listening. Noah texted her a photo of a packet of biscuits balanced on a patient monitor with the caption incentives and the next text had a hospital door half open and the words today broke my wrist and he sent a third message, which said, metaphorically, I mean, so don’t worry, and a fourth, which said stop worrying and I will come and steal your kettle if you keep on. She typed, we sang, someone dropped a fork and he wrote, perfect, which was the best review she had ever got.

On Monday, Iris began rehearsal with a stretch that looked like a group of people trying to be trees and failing with dignity. She made them sing a line on mmm like contentment and then ask it a question without changing the notes. Music as body language was new, and Verity liked the way it made sense in places where words had been bossy. Iris announced an end-of-term thing, a small summer concert in a church that had acoustics like forgiveness and asked for volunteers to read poems, or bake, or be good at moving chairs. Verity did not volunteer because the part of her that had recently said yes sat under the table picking at a sticker. Farah did and made a face like she’d just eaten bravery and it tasted like something you could get used to.

Afterwards, Marianne found her by the water cooler that believed it was a fountain and said, “I heard the hospital went.” When Verity said what it had felt like, Marianne nodded in a slow way that meant she was filing it against her own archive. “I once sang in a hospice,” she said. “Everything was sharp. By which I mean metal corners. Light. Words. We were told not to be sad for anyone in a way they could see. It felt like being told not to sneeze. We managed a verse and the woman’s daughter coughed and we all laughed and then it turned into a thing that wasn’t standing in a room worrying. So. These places have their own gravity. You did well to stand. Doing well sometimes is only that.”

By Thursday the rain had had another go, then gone. Noah knocked, and when she opened, he had one of those awkward bundles that turned into a thing when you saw it laid out: foam tiles, the kind babies roll on, in primary colours that made her room look like a playgroup and also absorbed sound like saints. “Hospital skip had them,” he said, and then, seeing her eyebrow, added, “Officially for disposal. Unofficially for art.” He helped her lay them on the floor in a carpet of children’s jigsaws and she sang a single line and the room said yes, that will do. He leaned in the doorframe with a competence he wore like your favourite cardigan and said, “Oval Sunday?”

“Next week,” she said, which had become an incantation she believed because it had been repeated enough to be true.

“Invite me,” he said, then quickly, “only if that doesn’t ruin it. I can also pretend I don’t know you and clap as a plant.”

“I want you there,” she said, surprising herself with how simple it was. His smile did that awkward, careful unfolding like it had hinges and a manual.

On the tram to work the next morning, a teenager across the aisle had a violin case and a face like the city owed him quiet. He took out the instrument and did not play it, just held it and stared at the landscape of suburban roofs as if he was following a line. Verity watched the boy’s jaw and thought of her own and of Iris’s instructions like scaffolding that can later be taken down. She thought of her mother buying microphones with loyalty points and of the tape in the drawer with her name on it in a child’s scrawl. She thought of the hospital and the fork, the cleaner’s bored blessing and the way Noah’ s pen ticked a box on nothing.

She turned her face to the window and saw the town again, the cranes that start and stop like breathing, the scaffolding around a future that keeps being postponed until one day it’s just there and you have to walk past it like you didn’t spend months imagining you’d hate it. The tram dinged its bell as if tugging at the sleeve of a Monday that had already decided its mood. She hummed quietly and the man next to her glanced over and then glanced away, British courtesy wrapped round curiosity, and she felt for the first time that the noise she made was not a trespass but a breadcrumb trail to where she had left herself.

On Sunday she took the bus to the Oval in daylight, which made it less of a secret and more of an appointment. The list on the clipboard had names on it with hearts next to two. She put her name down again, with her full truth because the tilde felt silly, and then she went home and ate pasta because carbohydrates seem to sit nearest to courage. She stood in the tented corner before she left and sang the call she would not sing tonight, just to tell the room thank you. She put on a dress that didn’t need ironing and a jacket that did not look like she was going to apologise with her shoulders and she texted Noah a time. He replied with a thumb and the word there. She took her keys and checked the tap and the gas and the way her breath sat like a small dog. The tram rang, the building hummed like good plumbing, and she stepped out into the corridor that had become the sort of stage where names are learned by accident and you can share the weight of a rug and call it intimacy. She shut the door and didn’t flinch at the sound because she was the one who’d made it.Chapter 6

The morning wore the colour of dishwater and the air had the flat taste of the inside of a Tupperware you’ve used for onions. Verity lay and watched the condensation on the window arrange itself in a diagram the day found easy to understand. She wasn’t hungover in the dramatic sense; she was dried out, the kind of after that comes not from gin but from taking yourself out of the box and standing on a small stage pretending you’d always known what to do with your hands. The Open Mic Night occupied her body like a polite guest who helped with the washing up and then, when you thought you’d finished, found one more plate under the suds.

She remembered the lights first, not theatrical, just bulbs in cages that insisted on being noticed. The room at the Oval had offered its suspicion and then, when she hadn’t tried to be clever, its approval. The landlady had indeed been a soprano; she had clapped as if keeping time for herself. The list on the clipboard had moved like a queue at the bank, with occasional miracles and a man who arrived late wanting to be first. There had been a guitarist with fingers like spiders, a young woman who apologised so often Verity wanted to put a coat round her apologies and lead them outside for fresh air, two friends who shared a microphone as if it were a hot drink, and a white-haired man whose voice came out like a coat you had forgotten still fit. Verity had stood, and the room had tilted a fraction and then righted, and somewhere behind the taste of metal the word finally had turned up and sat on the lip of her glass.

What she sang didn’t matter as much as the fact that she did; she had chosen a song with more ground than mountain and her voice had trembled on the first step, steadied on the second, and on the third found the shelf Iris always spoke of. Noah had been there by the fruit machine, hands in pockets, doing that careful smile he reserved for moments he suspected might be holy to someone else. He had not waved. He had looked like a man timing his breath to hers so she could borrow some when she ran short. When she finished, the room had applauded with the generosity of people relieved not to have witnessed a disaster and surprised to have been given a small, accurate gift. An older woman in a red cardigan had shouted bravo in the way of people who don’t waste words on whether they are out of fashion. The landlady had nodded and pointed her chin towards the list as if to say, go on then, become a person who does two. Verity had not. She had left the second song in the book where it could learn patience. She had written her name for the following Sunday and done it without the tilde because in the end you can only hide your initials for so long.

Work did its ordinary impression of a theatre with too many props and not enough actors. The cardboard world had drama that was, under the layers, about people more than packaging. A client in Bromley claimed a delivery date had been a suggestion as casual as a wink and would now like to pretend to be surprised. Kemi brought in a cake she had bought and put on a plate as if it were home-made, and when challenged said the icing had been emotionally laboured over by her just now with a knife and a cupboard door as a shield. Martin told a story in three acts about a subcontractor with a van that was fine when it left and held together with faith when it arrived. Through it all, Verity carried in her chest the sensation of a room that had allowed her sound to sit in the air and not be treated as a trespass. It was ridiculous and, like most ridiculous things, true.

There was a Sing Smart page under her door in the evening with the rain bruised into its edges. Tip Twelve: Record, but listen the way you would to a friend. Phones make everything tinny. Forgive the tin. In Noah’s slanted pencil: If you want my not-tin ears, I have them. He’d drawn a small rectangle in the corner with waves coming off it and labelled it Not A Judgement Machine. She smiled and did not feel foolish about it. She took her phone into the soft corner and sang the call from the hospital under her breath and a verse of the pub song before her nerve fled. She listened back sitting on the floor with her knees up like a punctuation mark and, for the first time, did not wince at her own mouth before she heard what it had done. The woman on the recording wasn’t someone you would hire to sing you out of a war, but she had a way with a vowel that made the line feel inhabited rather than rented.

Her mother rung and the first thing she said was, “I watched that video three times and then I told Aunt June to stop sending it to people because she kept putting heart emojis as if she’d birthed you herself.” There was a pause as if the next part had been practicing. “You sounded nice. You sounded like yourself.”

“Thank you,” said Verity, finding that the compliment hung around her neck like a medal that didn’t quite know where to sit. “We’re doing a thing at Wandle Park next weekend, apparently. A community day. There will be face paint and someone dressed as a bee for environmental reasons. That sort of day.”

“Your father might come if there’s a burger van,” her mother said. “He won’t clap in a way you’ll see. He’ll do that clapping men do where only their fingers move because their palms are on strike.”

“Tell him he’s allowed the extravagant sort,” said Verity. “Tell him it won’t cause a flood.”

The next morning, by the bins, she met the busker, which felt wrong because the busker belonged to stations and windswept places, not the rectangle of tarmac where residents negotiated whose recycling was the more moral. She was leaning on a bicycle with two mismatched panniers and the particular air of someone who could release tension by re-tuning the world. Up close, she had the high colouring of people who spend more time outside than their mother told them was sensible. She smiled in the direction of Verity’s shoes first, as if that’s where a person’s story began, then looked up and clicked recognition.

“Hello,” said the busker, as if they had been passing each other on a bridge for years. “You did the Oval.”

“Not elegantly, but I did,” said Verity. “I’m trying not to make my timidness the main event.”

“You were balanced on your toes for half the first verse and then you remembered your legs,” the busker said, kind in a way that never looked down. “I’m Maya, by the way. I always forget people think we buskers don’t have names.”

“Verity,” said Verity, adding, because she couldn’t help herself, “my mother is called Brenda and wanted something that sounded like it had spine.”

“That’s an excellent reason to name a person. I’m called Maya because my parents liked a poet and also because the word is a trick in some languages and they found that funny until I had to explain it. You’ll come again, yeah? The Oval. The kind of audience that doesn’t drink to forget is a miracle. You can hear them deciding not to check their phone.”

“Yes,” said Verity. “I wrote it down. Writing helps.”

“Music helps more,” said Maya, wheeling off with a nod like this was a part of town where nouns could be trusted. “See you in the future.”

The charity shop on the corner smelt of old wool, talc and stories nobody had thought of as stories yet. Verity hadn’t gone in intending to find a tape player; then she saw it on a low shelf between a menagerie of chipped figurines and a stack of cookbooks promising salvation via aubergine. It was the boxy kind from the years when televisions had backs. There was a sticker on it that said £5 and Someone’s Youth in spidery biro. She picked it up and thought of the cassette in her drawer with her name and a label in green pen. She took the player to the counter and the man with the till gave it the sort of look you give a dog you might adopt. He tested the plug on a long socket strip with other appliances waiting politely like they were at a charging station for spaceships. The player hummed like a friendly fridge. She handed over a five-pound note with the sense that she was paying admission to a museum that only she would attend.

At home, she put the tape in with the careful matter-of-factness of someone changing a dressing and pressed play. The machine whirred and the tape wheels turned and the room altered its posture the way rooms do when they recognise the kind of time they’re about to hold. The hiss came first, then the clatter of a school hall, then laughter with the echo of varnished wood. A teacher’s voice said next up, Verity Blake, which made her stomach drop like a lift. The girl’s voice hadn’t lowered yet, it had that brave, shouty gleam children have when they’ve been told their mouth is useful. She sang something clean and bald and meant, and there was a moment in the second line where she nearly lost her place and then found it like a coin under a chair and the room made a small sound of relief. Someone near the tape recorder said Aww in a way that was not diminishing but is always branded painful later. At the end there was the short, urgent clatter of recorded applause. The tape clicked, rattled, and then held its breath.

In the doorway, Noah leaned his head against the frame and said nothing for long enough that it counted as tenderness. He must have heard it through the wall and come because sometimes you do that without meaning to; you are in the middle of your act and then you’re in the room of someone else’s beginning. She pressed stop and looked toward him in a way she hoped did not feel like a request.

“She knew where to put her mouth,” he said finally. “That kid. She wasn’t trying to pass an exam about being acceptable. She put her voice right up to people and trusted that they wouldn’t take it away.”

“Someone took it anyway,” said Verity, not accusing him but someone, and the word someone did its ductile trick and became fate, years, culture, fear, a man with a joke at the wrong time, a sequence of boxes labelled nothing. “Or I handed it over. It’s the same in the end.”

“They handed you a room with sharp edges and said don’t bleed and you did your best,” he said, his voice rougher than on days when all he’d lifted were cardboard metaphors. He stepped in, sat on the edge of the spare bed with the deliberate care you use on furniture that has developed secrets, and let her sit next to him without arranging it. Close up, tiredness had given his features the grain of a photograph, and there was a mark on his wrist where a watch had lived all day. “There was a patient today who sang to herself. Barely above her breath, a thread. I thought oh good, something is working, biology or prayer or habit. Then she stopped and the room felt abandoned. A nurse went back in after and couldn’t explain why she was crying. So I’m adding a rule to your list. Never apologise for the thread.”

“They’ve all been ridiculous rules,” she said, softer, “and they’ve all worked.”

He grinned, which told her he had heard and stored that. Then he said, “What’s Wandle Park when it’s at home?” in the tone he used when he wanted to bring her outside when she’d been inside too long.

“A day out for people who enjoy eating falafel outdoors and also being told to hydrate by cheerful teenagers,” she said. “Iris wants us to do a warm-up tent. I’ve been given the job of making people hum in public, which is a crime in some counties.”

He made a face as if bravado had just burnt his tongue. “I have a break at one. If I appear among your humming, will I be arrested?”

“You’ll be let off with a caution,” she said, and then, because she could, “come.”

Thursday at choir, Iris asked them to make the sound of a kettle in three parts. It was silly and, like most silly tasks handed to adults, revealed who in the room would volunteer to be foolish first. Verity put her hand up before anyone else could, and there was a murmur in her own body like a town spreading out. Marianne brought biscuits that appeared with the exact timing of a relief package when morale fails. Farah told an elaborate joke that had the architecture of a story and the punchline of an observation, and Iris’s eyebrows wrote a tiny essay on gratitude. They went through the set for Wandle Park and Iris had them practice talking to strangers because sometimes your throat tightens more over introductions than notes. “If anyone says they can’t sing,” she instructed, pointing at a pretend visitor in the corner where the coats were, “you say, that’s fine, you can do it anyway. We’re allergic to can’t here. We break out in rhythm.”

On Friday, HR sent round the email about Talent Lunch again, this time with the passive aggressive subject line Response has been low, and the promise of sandwiches that translated as Maybe show us you’re a person. Kemi elbowed Verity in the kidney and said, “We are going to go and stand near the back so we can escape if Ricky from Accounts begins his card tricks. If you sing, I will heckle in praise.”

“I’ll come,” said Verity, which she found funny because she’d spent ten years avoiding any event that leaned into the idea of human beings being together on purpose. “I’ll clap. I’ll be your muscle if Ricky starts.”

The Talent Lunch turned out to be mercifully short and strangely moving. A quiet woman from HR made a joke you could feel had been rehearsed in a mirror and didn’t crack when nobody laughed; she then sang a folk song in a voice that had her whole childhood still living in it. A man from IT juggled three apples and then dropped two and kept going with one in a way that made the room forgive the performance and adore the persistence. Martin stood up with a ukulele that he’d pretended in three separate meetings not to own and played a cheery, rude number about invoices that had the exact metric of a hit and, when he finished, looked ten years younger without the pretend swagger. Verity stayed where she was. She felt relief that her body offered its no without apology and also a particular eager want that made her elbows itch. She had done the Oval; she did not need to turn her workplace into an annex of the pub. Not today.

Wandle Park showed off because May had remembered how to be British about sunshine. Children dragged parents towards face painters with the momentum of water, dogs made decisions based solely on smell, boys with drums tried to recruit anyone with knees. The river showed itself coyly, parting grass like someone lifting a curtain. Verity stood by a small sign that said Feel Better in Bold With Us and tried to look like noise wasn’t a con. Iris wore a T-shirt with an arrow pointing up and the words Breathing Starts Here. Farah’s cardigan was replaced by a denim jacket that belonged to the decade you reach for when you want to declare that time forgives fashion if you keep it kind. Marianne had a clipboard, which made people take her seriously until she asked them to meow in harmony.

Noah appeared at ten past one, walking like someone who’d spent the morning listening for alarms even in sentences. He had a paper tray with coffees and a muffin that had swelled against its wrapper as if trying to look brave. He hovered at the edge of the warm-up tent in the way of men who suspect they will be asked to abandon dignity. Iris caught his eye and ruined his plan by being charming.

“Hello,” she said. “We are in the business of glue. Would you like to stick?”

“I’m more of a man who fetches pins,” he said, but he put his coffee down and did the jaw wobble and then the sigh and then, when Iris made them pretend to blow up a balloon with the back of their ribs, he committed. He hummed on a pitch he had no contract with and it turned out to be good enough to build a tent out of. Verity watched him out of the corner of her eye and felt a particular gratitude for men who surrender on purpose.

By the time they were due on, there was a line of people with the polite curiosity of the British in the presence of one of their own trying. The songs behaved. Children joining in did not. A toddler batoned in triple time, which was nobody’s fault. A woman filmed with tears standing in her eyes as if she were practising for a different kind of event. The inner line—Verity’s lane—had a moment where it could have turned to obvious and didn’t because she dug her heel in at the corner of a note and refused to be pulled into the melody like a wave. Noah took a photo from the edge that caught Iris in mid-gesture and Verity with her mouth slightly open and Farah’s eyebrows like they’d just asked the world not to be silly for a second, and later he sent it to her with a message that said, this is the exact opposite of a team-building away day, thank god.

After, they sat in the grass on the downwind side of a falafel van that had confused cumin with enthusiasm. Children shrieked in the sort of joy that wakes geese. Iris lay back with a bottle of water across her forehead like a person halfway through a medieval cure and said, “This is the point. People asking who they are out loud without anyone in a uniform making them sign something.” Marianne told a story about the time she’d sung in a band at a street party on a road in Addiscombe and been handed a baby halfway through a chorus because the woman holding it had started to laugh too hard to keep hold. Farah dug her heel into the earth and made a mark like a promise. Verity felt the tick of her phone and pretended she’d forgotten it under her thigh until the impulse to check stopped being a demand and became an offer.

Her mother and father came in the late part of the afternoon when the light is best for photographs and the queue at the coffee van has given up believing in itself. Her father clapped with his fingers only, as predicted; he also blinked too fast for a line and brought out of his pocket a handkerchief that had been ironed to within an inch of a sermon. Her mother asked if she was going to wear a scarf because there was a breeze and also whether the girl in the front row with purple hair was too young to be without an adult. Then, abruptly, she reached out and touched Verity’s face the way you do when you’re checking the temperature of someone who has never told you how to read them. “You look like you’ve let yourself in,” she said, as if the phrase had been living under her tongue for weeks and had finally managed to roll its R. “I like this.”

They went for ice cream because rituals only become boring if you quit on them. On the way back, Aunt June texted a series of microphones and the words studio this afternoon if you want and an address in a cul-de-sac in Beckenham. Eden would have rolled her eyes at the thought of a garage calling itself a studio; Verity, perhaps because of the tape and the child on it with the shining mouth, found herself texting yes without planning it. She took the tram and then a bus and then walked down a street that smelled of barbecues and jobs left until tomorrow, and Amy’s boy opened the chained-up garage with a flourish he’d clearly practised.

He was the sort of earnest that wears its hair like the idea of rock and runs its extension leads correctly. The garage had been wrapped in foam like a present you don’t want to drop. There were fairy lights that made it look like Christmas had got the wrong end of the genre and a microphone that looked expensive the way watches do. The man (his name was Drew, which felt correct for a person who uses his hands and also makes playlists for people he hasn’t met) invited her to stand in front of the mic and, with admirable restraint, did not say give us a line. He showed her how to wear headphones without feeling you were at a dentist. He talked about proximity effect in a voice so gentle even her defensiveness sat down to listen. He said, “Don’t worry about the red light. It’s a liar,” and he had the decency to not be surprised when she flinched anyway. He pressed record and she sang one verse and then insisted that the world had to change before there was a second verse to be had.

On playback, her voice was suddenly not in her chest but in the room, and it startled her like seeing a mirror in a foreign house. On the second try, he turned a knob that made it sound like she was standing in a church and she felt the wrongness like a tart taste; she asked him to turn it back. He did, and then he added nothing else and smiled a small, proud smile when she sang the call from the hospital and the answer from the choir came back in her head on time. He sent her a file like a promise and wouldn’t take money because he said the favour was in the direction of his aunt and also because the currency he was currently interested in was people deviating from scripts.

On the way home, the streets did their twilight thing of showing faces you’d missed at midday. Verity could have texted the file to ten people and heard it back with versions of proud that chafed. She sent it to one: Noah, with no pride attached, just the two words tell me. He wrote back a single sentence that had no fancy in it: you sound like you kept the baby and the city. She read it under a lamppost that had decided to be merciful and, for a moment, everything wasn’t manageable exactly, but it felt accommodated.

That week the hospital asked for singers again but at a different time, early evening, and for a different mood. Iris chose a set that had no hymns and no surprises. The canteen had been a holding pattern; the corridor near palliative was a goodbye dressed as an in-between. Verity’s mouth did the right thing in the wrong place once and she looked up and saw a woman take another woman’s hand in a grip furious with love. She carried that picture home like you carry a bowl with a crack in it, tender and certain of its strength.

There was a Sing Smart page under the door with the word lopsided spelled wrong and underlined twice. Tip Thirteen: Volume is not proof. No one ever saved a feeling by shouting it. Noah had put a star by it and written, for me as much as you. She pinned it to the blanket with a safety pin like a camp counsellor who had decided to take this job seriously. She sang quietly that night and it mattered more.

The Oval the following Sunday felt like a place you go when you’ve decided to keep Sweet Sundays, for yourself and those who wash up accidentally in your life. Maya was there, this time with a boy whose hair had lost and found a comb several times over the day and who harmonised badly in a redemptive way. The landlady had a brooch shaped like a cat and a gaze that missed nothing. A woman with an infant did the thing where she bounced her softly in time and sang louder than she otherwise would. Verity put her name down and then forgot about it for long enough that her stomach didn’t have time to riot. She sang and this time the first line didn’t grab at her ankles; it laid itself down like a stepping stone. Noah was there, in the same place, a superstition she didn’t plan to challenge. He had his hands in his pockets again because some rituals feel sturdier with a resting place. Afterwards, a man with a face that suggested he’d laughed at several presidents said, “I like the bit where you didn’t go up when everyone thought you would,” which was the best lesson she’d taken from Iris delivered back at her with a pint.

She still hadn’t told her mother about the pub because there are timings to be respected if you want love without tinsel. She did tell Marianne, who nodded like a headmistress told that a student had stolen a test and then handed it back with corrections. Farah said she wanted to come next time and promised to bring someone who looked like confidence but wasn’t. Kemi threatened to stand on a table and shout more, which was her way of registering admiration and of making demands on fate. She might have laughed it all off a month earlier; now she put their words in a pocket and planned to take them out like receipts when she next felt she’d imagined everything.

On a Tuesday where the rain tried to petition for a bank holiday by sheer persistence, the boiler in the building finally decided to do the dramatic break it had been rehearsing for months. The shower ran cold like a scolding, and the corridors were full of adults in towels making tactical plans. Noah turned into a man with a list as long as a bingo card, knocking, texting, arranging, phoning a plumber with the patience of a saint and the social skills of a wet match. Verity made tea in what felt like an industrial quantity and added biscuits to it like exclamation marks. The family upstairs created a water feature in their bathroom and apologised down the stairwell in at least two languages. It was chaotic, and for once the chaos in their building was funny first and annoying two hours later.

When the heat came back with an indignant cough, a cheer went up like on a playground when someone finally got to the top of the rope. Verity and Noah stood on the landing with mugs and the words you okay? passed between them like a torch. She felt as ordinary as you can feel when you have just sung in a hospital corridor and a pub and also taken delivery of a six-pack of toilet rolls in the rain. It was good, she realised, to be exhausted by plumbing rather than self-invention for an evening.

Later, they sat in her spare room because the rest of the flat had most of the rubble of her week in it and the corner had learned the trick of being kind by design. He told her a story about when he was young and learned the names of bones the way other boys learned car parts; how he had thought music was an accessory until he’d seen what breath did when people forgot how to speak. She told him she had kept the tape player’s price sticker on because she loved the idea of paying a fiver for a door to the past. He put his head back and closed his eyes and the sound he made was not laughter but its cousin, the one that arrives when you let something be simple.

Her mother sent a photo late, which is late for a woman whose day goes to bed at ten. It was of her father with a pillow on his lap embroidering something that might turn out to be a pheasant, his face furious with concentration and love. The caption said he says don’t tell anyone and I said we shall see. Verity wrote back, tell him I’m putting it on a billboard, and then, because hearts sometimes do the useful work of adding warmth without words, added one. In an after-text, her mother said, that tape, the one with your voice, keep it safe, and Verity thought she meant the file on her phone and then realised no, she meant the sound in her throat.

Towards the end of the week, Iris asked if any of the altos wanted to lead a warm-up at the start of choir. Nobody moved for five seconds out of Britishness, then Farah’s hand crept up and then, to her surprise, Verity’s went up too. Iris looked more delighted than a person is usually allowed to be on a weekday in Croydon. “Take two minutes,” she said. “No more. Teach us something your body likes.”

Farah had them shake like dogs who have just discovered rain. Verity made them scoop air from behind themselves like they were collecting a memory. It was absurd and it worked and the room went from a place where people were waiting to be told to a place where they took what they were given and turned it into air and then sound. After, Iris leaned close and said, “See? We did not die. We will do it again.” There was a tune in her voice that said, this is how I get people to realise they know things.

In the soft corner that night Verity sang the good parts and the wobbly parts and the part where she had to negotiate with her jaw. The tape player sat on the shelf with the dignity of a thing doing the job it had always been meant to do. Outside, Croydon did that thing where it sounded like a city pretending to be a seaside town; somewhere someone had a radio on and a television off and the tram chimed its small, faithful bell. On the last note she let herself hear her own sound the way she listened to other people now: for colour, for story, for the exact point where air turned into something useful. She thought of the small girl at the front of Wandle Park with the purple hair who had looked at her as if her mouth might be a permission slip. She thought of the woman at the hospital who had not been ready to speak and had let them say something on her behalf. She thought of the pub, of Maya’s sticker, of Noah’s pencil stars in the margins of a silly guide, and of her mother’s first It sounds like you. She sat on the floor and let her head touch the blanket gently and decided that the next time she saw Maya she would ask if she could stand near and hold a second line to her song. Not to be right, not to be impressive, but to learn how to live in the middle of a thing without needing to own it. That, she thought, might be the whole project.

On Sunday, before the pub, she took the tape recorder to Eden’s because children love ancient tech the way they love dinosaurs: with awe and practicality. The twins stared at it like it was a spaceship and then tried to wrap it in sequins. Eden rolled her eyes when the sound came out as if history had left a voice message, and then looked at Verity and did that sister nod that means I remember you when you weren’t guarding yourself. On the way back, the sun bothered the tops of buildings in a kind way and the pigeons behaved as if they owned the place, which, arguably, they did. She passed Surrey Street where a man was selling mangoes as if each one were a ticket to a better climate. She bought one, not for climate but for the joke.

At the Oval, Maya let Verity take a harmony on a song about trains and wanting and the kind of choices that only appear once you’ve already made them. It was too low for her in the verse and too tempting to leap in the chorus and she did both anyway and nobody died. The landlady sang along under her breath in a way that would always be kinder than a microphone. Noah stood by the fruit machine again, smiling like he owned none of it and was glad it was happening anyway. When the verse that belonged to Verity came, she let the line be what Iris promised it could: not an argument, not an announcement, a note set down carefully in a place where people could find it later and say, oh yes, that’s where we put that feeing. And afterwards the applause was the same soft, human sort as before, and if anybody filmed her she didn’t notice because she was busy living in the exact five seconds when air becomes hers.Chapter 8

By Wednesday the sky had decided to be a lid again and the tram bell came through the glass like a teaspoon against a cup. Verity lay in the half-warm where your body negotiates with the duvet about adulthood and made a small experimental noise in her throat. It sounded like a cupboard door that needed oil. She wasn’t ill; she was used. Oval, hospital, park, choir; the week had stretched her voice until it knew more about where it lived. She swallowed and felt the tight, dry catch that tea pretends to cure. The kettle moaned obligingly and she filled a mug and added a slice of lemon her sister would judge as being for show. Steam lifted the kitchen into a safer shape.

There was a page under her door again, part of the paper ritual that had started being as reliable as the post. Sing Smart: Tip Fourteen, the font cheerfully incompetent. Morning is a baby deer. Don’t ask it to join a sprint. In pencil, Noah’s edit: I will never ask you to sprint. Also: deer bite. He’d drawn something that might have been antlers or the tramline wires; his drawings often looked like a child had taken accuracy out for a drink. She took the page into the spare room with its blankets and foam tiles and did ten minutes of humming on nothing much, like sweeping a floor you wanted to walk on later.

Work appeared in her inbox as if she had ordered it. The company had decided to call their monthly meeting a town hall which made Croydon seem like a place with hay bales and a man in a hat voting on cows. Her boss said synergies out loud and didn’t blush. Kemi slid onto the edge of her desk like a cat that had learned to sit on keyboards and murmured, “There’s a rumour of restructuring, which is HR for maybe put your favourite mug in a drawer. Also Iris sent an email. Summer concert at St Michael’s. She wants someone to do a little talking bit between songs about why we stand there making shapes with our faces. She says the word ‘someone’ is a trap. You’re the mouse.”

Verity stared at her screen as if the answer to all of this were hidden under a filter. “Talking is worse,” she said. “When you sing you can pretend to be doing something useful with the air. When you talk you have to use words that will stay in the room and accuse you later.”

“Then be vague,” said Kemi. “Say ‘community’ and ‘lungs’ and ‘my life is different since’ and nod at an old person. They’ll love you.”

Iris’s email was waiting, viewpoint precise and kind. We don’t need a speech, she wrote. We need a mouth to admit what we’re doing. Two minutes. Tell them why the middle parts matter. Or tell them about your morning kettle. Everything is allowed if it’s true. Verity clicked reply and typed I will try this and then deleted try and left I will. It did not feel like arrogance; it felt like writing a date in a diary and trusting the paper not to laugh.

On the tram, a boy played something furious into his phone and the sound leaked like gossip. Croydon wore a colour between wet concrete and memory. She passed the corner where Reeves Corner had burned and rebuilt itself as if that were a hobby. A woman on the opposite seat had a bag of oranges that kept trying to escape, and every time one managed to roll to the aisle she trapped it with the side of her shoe like football was something you did kindly. Verity watched and thought about roundness and about letting things go and the way they sometimes come back of their own accord.

Choir that evening had the feel of a rehearsal where people had to hold on to themselves a bit harder. Iris came in with a scarf looped twice against the building’s temper and that thermos that might be stew. “Half of you will think you’re ill,” she announced, clapping once. “Half of you are tired. There is also a third half, which is maths for choir, who are fine but think they might be ill if they sit down for too long. We will be gentle and we will do the work.”

A new woman sat among the sopranos, posture like a mast. Her voice arrived bright and decided, and it was the kind of sound people turn their heads for. She shook hands with modest confidence and apologised to the room silently on behalf of all her previous choirs. Iris introduced her as Lila, and the name fit like a note on a line. In the first run-through the melody made itself the main event more than usual, right there in the soprano, and the inner parts wobbled like jelly pretending it wasn’t. Verity felt her line being tempted towards a gleam that wasn’t her job. She glanced across at Farah who did the tiniest head tilt known to woman, the one that meant hold your course, captain, and they both dug in like sensible boots in wet grass.

After they had sung a piece enough times to make its edges visible, Iris stopped the room with a small lift of the left eyebrow. “We do not compete,” she said, looking specifically nowhere and everywhere. “That is for sports day. We braid. Lila, you are welcome. You shine. Please keep shining. Inner voices, imagine your notes like steps built of good wood. Without you, we all float and then fall. With you, everyone gets to somewhere instead of only thinking they might. Again.”

They sang it again, and this time Lila leaned back from the line, the way certain singers can do that isn’t about volume but about generosity. The whole thing settled, like a tablecloth finally centred. After the break, when tea was poured and the biscuits were the sandy sort your grandmother kept in a tin that smelled of four decades, Lila wandered over to the instrument table where Verity was pretending to dust her courage. “I came from a choir where the altos were conscripts,” Lila said, tone apologetic at the universe. “I’m trying to relearn how to be with humans.”

“Welcome to our anarchism,” said Verity. “We’re glue. It’s messy. It holds.”

On Thursday, instead of the hospital canteen, Iris had them stand under the canopy by the entrance by the car park, where ambulances breathed like heavy animals. The air was wet and metallic with the smell of weather on metal. A man sat on a low wall under the No Smoking sign bustling out a quiet smoke anyway and nodded as if they were a clever joke he knew to be earnest. The set was short; the point was to be a punctuation mark, not a paragraph. Halfway through the second song, a woman with her coat still on but her bag dropped at her feet stopped and put her hand to her mouth. There was a look her face made before tears that wasn’t grief exactly, more like her muscles had remembered how to have a feeling. Noah stood a polite distance away with the trolley of fresh linen he didn’t need to move like a stage prop he had a professional relationship with. When they finished, he flicked his eye upward at the bank of windows as if ticking off some quiet pilgrimage.

After, a man in a tie too tight for his day came up and said, “I’m afraid you can’t sing here,” and pointed vaguely at a noticeboard with Health and Safety in capital letters. Iris nodded and performed her favourite trick of being both contrite and immovable. “Five minutes more and then we are gone,” she said. “Like weather.” The man with the tie hesitated as if wondering whether to argue with the sky. Noah angled his body so the man could see his name badge and the word Porter, and then used the tone that says I live here and also I know the cleaners. “It helps,” he said, concise as a note. The man’s mouth did the calculation of power and softened by three percent. “Carry on,” he muttered, which was what they were doing anyway.

On Addiscombe Road that evening, the wind fussed the trees until they all said yes at once. Verity stopped under the bridge near East Croydon and watched Maya uncase her guitar with the patience of removing a bandage. A small sign propped inside the case said It’s fine to cry but make it useful, and someone had drawn tears you could tell were drawn by a person who had cried recently. When Maya saw her, she grinned with the speed of a person who can get away with grinning often. “Harmony?” she said. “You can have second line on the old train one or the one about rats learning to dance.”

“Train,” said Verity, thinking of boys with violins with jaws that wanted to run. They did the first verse sensible, like laying tracks straight. By the chorus she found the second path that had looked invisible when she wasn’t moving, stepping into the space above and along in the way her body had learned could be claimed. For a second the station made the noise of a hundred people telling time to sit down and behave, and then her sound found its place and sat. A man in a suit slowed and did the thing with his mouth people do when they aren’t sure whether to smile because they have forgotten it’s allowed. A teenager across the way filmed them and forgot to be bored. A woman who could have been from Verity’s school days did a double take, then did the look over like she was rummaging through a box marked names in a charity shop. “Verity Blake?” she said, sounding as if she had been put in charge of a quiz and this was the final. “From Mr Hooper’s class? I’m Shannon. Shannon with the hair.”

Shannon had hair like a victory then and hair like a trademark now. They hugged awkwardly around guitar headstocks and public space and the fact that they had no shared recent nouns. “You went quiet,” Shannon said, half-accusation, half-fascinated. “You always did the Harvest Festival song like it owed you money. We thought you went drama school and then you didn’t. What happened?”

“I learned spreadsheets,” said Verity lightly, which was true without being the point. “I forgot. Then… I remembered?” She let the question mark sit there like a stool for Shannon to perch on. Shannon nodded as if she had tried forgetting too and found it wasn’t a permanent solution. A train bellowed its arrival and the moment moved on, as they do in places designed to dislodge.

At home, the Sing Smart page under the door had been crumpled by the damp. Tip Fifteen: Rest is practice. Whispering is a liar. If you’re hoarse, be silent. Noah’s addition read, You’re allowed to say no and still be someone. He’d underlined still as if it were doing a lot of work, which it was.

On Saturday morning, Verity went to Centrale without wanting to, because that was where batteries were. The shopping centre smelt of decisions you regret in five minutes. She bought a pack of AAs for the tape player and a pack of panic for her speech, accidentally, by walking past a shop that sold sequins and being ambushed by the memory of the twins with their fierce tapping. She texted Eden the three words want to lunch as a peace offering to her own brain and they met at Matthews Yard where the coffee tries to be better than the world and mostly is. Eden brought one of the twins and apologised for the other being at a party that involved slime. “Mum says she might come to your church thing,” Eden said, opening a cheese toastie the way surgeons open anything. “She will want to be told where to sit that is not under a draft.”

“She told me she has a scarf,” said Verity, and the twin reached across the table like a frog’s tongue and stole a chip and mouthed a jubilant sorry. “I have to talk. A bit. Iris said two minutes. Two minutes feels less than a song and somehow more exposing.”

“You talk all the time,” said Eden. “To kettles and strangers and your phone. Tell them about the bit you like. The river bit. The thing about your line going under and everyone pretending the sea is about the surface.”

“That is an image,” said Verity, impressed as she could allow and not escalate Eden into smugness. “Are you sure you don’t secretly want to do this instead. You’re better at… audiences.”

“I’m better at pretending I like them,” said Eden. “You’re better at actually liking them, which people can tell. Tell them that you weren’t allowed to sing for a while because you told yourself you weren’t, and then you stopped telling yourself that like a person taking a hand off their own mouth. They won’t hate it. If they do, they’ll do it politely.”

The church was St Michael and All Angels because Croydon likes to put all the options in one name. Verity did a recce on Sunday afternoon because she was the kind of person who had learned that seeing the room first meant it was less likely to attack. It had nave and aisle and all the here-we-are arrangements of wood worn by decades of intelligent backsides. The glass put colour on the floor like a child starting a painting and giving up to go outside. She stood in the aisle and said hello out loud to test the echo. It came back with a height she wasn’t used to, which made her laugh at her own smallness. She imagined Iris standing there with eyebrows uplifted like someone negotiating with weather and felt better about the whole thing.

Her mother texted a picture of a scarf and then another of a person in a choir robe with the caption this was me and I dropped out when the dog died and kept saying I would go back and didn’t. Verity stared at the photograph. The girl in it—her mother as a someone who had not yet met her—was all cheekbone and eagerness, and the dog she didn’t know yet to lose had his paw on her knee as if claiming her. “You said ‘don’t show off’,” Verity texted back and then deleted, because what was the point. She typed, you look beautiful, and her mother replied, we were allowed to then, and then nothing for a while, and then, bring me tissues.

The day of the concert, Croydon scrubbed up. It happens sometimes, the light catching on concrete in a way that forgives it. Verity’s stomach felt like the top of a hill on a bicycle with questionable brakes. She made a proper breakfast because hunger is drama’s accomplice. Her phone buzzed with Kemi’s message: We’re coming. I’ve gathered three bored men and a woman who will cry. Also Martin says he will do a flower arrangement after in the spirit of support. She texted back, no flowers, and he replied, the flowers are metaphorical, and she decided their office was happier these days for the ways in which they had started to dare nonsense at each other.

Before the doors opened, Iris stood them in the aisle and made them hum into the wood, which did the thing good wood does and took the sound and gave it back with interest. “We won’t save anyone,” Iris said, practical. “We aren’t here for that. We are here to make this space brave for the people sitting in it for forty minutes. If you wobble, breathe. If you breathe, you’re already winning. If you panic, look at a person you like. If you can’t see a person you like, look at me. My face can take it.”

Verity’s job was to speak after the third song. She had written nothing down because words on paper felt like a verb she would never finish. She had, instead, rehearsed the feeling of speaking as if telling a friend about something she had found in a drawer. The third song ended and Iris looked at her with the subtlest of glances that contained an entire grammar of yes. Verity stepped forward. The microphone stood there like a firefighter waiting for orders. She didn’t pick it up. She didn’t want amplification to bully her mouth into something not hers. She placed her hands where the wood of the lectern had collected complaints and gratitude and she said, “There’s a bit of the music that doesn’t belong to tune. It lives underneath. It looks dull on paper. It’s the bit that makes it possible to listen without noticing why. I forgot for a long time that being that bit is allowed. I thought if I wasn’t the note everyone knew then I didn’t belong. This choir taught me that doing the thing that lets other people do the thing is a job as important as having the shiny note. So if you are here and you think you can’t because you’re not… something… you probably can. You can hum and you can hold the line and you can breathe. We’ll hear you. We might not notice you first but we will need you. Also I sing in my bathroom and my neighbour knocks to say it’s good, which is the best review, and I recommend neighbours to everyone.”

There was a small sound in the room, mostly laughter with a bit of oh. Iris did a tiny, private clap with one hand against her own hip. Verity stepped back into the inner line that had become a place to stand. The next song had a leap she had feared three weeks ago; it came and she dropped her affection into her belly and the note did what it was told. Out of the corner of her eye she saw her father clapping with his fingers after each piece despite the rules about not clapping between movements that nobody outside of certain concerts knows exist. Her mother dabbed in an organised way so as not to waste tissue. Kemi sat with her shoulders up by her ears like a child delighted to be where something possibly embarrassing and definitely lovely was happening. Martin had his metaphorical flowers ready, which turned out to be a Tesco bouquet in reality.

At the end, the applause had the quality of permission being given. People had that expression you get after haircuts and good news. Verity stood and took the sound into her spine as if it was calcium. Maya turned up at the back halfway through the chaos of greetings and waved an arm like a flag. “You did the square!” she yelled across an aisle at a volume that made the vicar blink, which felt like a benediction. Marianne squeezed Verity’s elbow with deliberate precision. Farah said, “Your face is becoming bold,” and laughed because she meant it a compliment and it came out like art criticism.

In the churchyard afterwards, among yews that had seen too much and learned to mind their own business, Noah stood with his coffee and the look he wore when he had let other people be the main event for a day and was relieved. “Two minutes,” he said. “You didn’t faint.”

“I considered,” she said. “But then I remembered how ugly I look when I go green.” He snorted in a rare, unguarded way that made a robin on a headstone hop like a cliché.

“My mother sang in a choir for a bit,” he said, watching the robin like the universe had staged it. “Before … the rest. She said she liked it because she could arrive after a day of fixing other people’s muck and nobody required her to be clever. Just true. She went quiet after my dad left. Not so much out of grief as out of efficiency. It’s weird what quiet stands in for.”

“You have a lot of befores,” said Verity and then winced because it sounded like she’d been making a list. He didn’t look offended. He looked like someone considering the shape of his life from a vantage point he hadn’t used in a while.

“I do,” he said. “This is a nice during.”

Her mother approached with the stride of a woman on a mission that involved both approval and interference. “You spoke,” she said, as if this were a shocking deviation from the record. “You made… sense. Your father says well done, which is his top tier. Also I have made sausage rolls in case there is an after where food is required. Do people want sausage rolls after church concerts? They do at funerals.”

“Not the same event,” said Eden, appearing with the twins like a trio act. “But yes, bring them. The buskers will thank you. This is Noah,” she added to their mother, hooking him in like a dollop of cream on a scone. “He is in charge of not letting her voice die in a foam corner.”

Brenda looked at Noah with the mother look that estimated both bank balance and ability to lift furniture and then, to Verity’s surprise, gave him a nod that meant I can work with you. “Thank you,” she said simply. “She is a lot softer round the edges these days. I mean that nicely.”

“Edges are for mugs,” said Noah, which won Brenda over more than flattery. “You brought sausage rolls to a field, which speaks of character.”

Back home, after the awkward hugging where everybody wants to leave first for politeness points, there was a page under the door as if the day had needed a full stop. Sing Smart: Tip Sixteen. Applause is a mirror. Don’t look too long. In the margin, Noah had written, Keep some for Tuesday, and drawn a rectangle with a dot in the middle that might have been a stage or might have been a biscuit. She pinned it next to the one about shouting and they made sense together like two neighbours learning to share a cupboard.

Work on Monday was the kind where the office carpet gradually gave you permission to cry and then didn’t honour it. The restructure turned out to be a move of seating plans and a new set of job titles that put words like Partner into places where they didn’t apply. Kemi sat on Verity’s desk and said, “If I get made a Senior Advocate for Boxes I will ask for a cape. Also Martin sent me a recording of him playing at the talent thing and he’s made it his ringtone. If I hear it in the toilet I will unplug the building.” Verity forwarded Iris a thank you that was mostly adjectives and Iris sent back a photograph of her thermos with the caption soup for bravery, which was exactly her kind of doctrine.

On Wednesday, Maya texted: come stand with me at the station. I have a stupid idea. Which was the kind of sentence that made Verity put her shoes on. Maya’s stupid idea was a song that wasn’t yet a song, more a list of Croydon nouns she had been collecting on her phone: Reeves Corner and the Whitgift cranes, Boxpark as a fancy Lego mistake, West Croydon where the trains go sigh in both directions, the Minster bells and the kebab boxes foxes rifled like minutes. She strummed and sang with an exaggerated care, the way you play Jenga with language. “Rhymes?” she asked, and Verity offered none because she refused to accuse Croydon of that. Instead she sang a second line that approached the places from underneath, stacked them with their proper weight, and for a second the station hummed like a thing that had always been a song but needed someone to tell it.

A man in a high-vis vest came over like a professional boundary. “Permission?” he asked, because this was the question you had to ask to prove you were doing your job. Maya looked at him like a woman who had learned there are situations where pestering can be rebranded as charm. “We are in possession of a guitar and a minor sense of our own place,” she said. “We will stop if you say.” The man made a face that meant I will not die on this hill and gestured at a line on the floor that probably meant legal and walked away with a shrug that felt like a civic compromise.

That night, Verity took the tape out again because something about singing where trains breathe makes you want to call versions of yourself who chose other platforms. She played the child her voice and the child gave it back faithfully. She considered whether to record over the tape with her now in a cheap, effective sacrilege, and decided no. It mattered that the old noise remained unchanged. She pressed save on the file from Drew’s garage and labelled it in a way that would tell no one what it was if they stumbled upon her phone: kettle song. She sent it to nobody. Not even Noah. Keeping a thing in your pocket sometimes is the only way to keep it alive for a bit.

In the soft corner, under the blanket roof, she sang without audience and that was still the version that taught her the most. She did the minute things, the jaw relax, the vowel that feels like lazy but is precision, the step down like a sigh, the square made without falling. Someone upstairs laughed too hard and then stopped as if remembering walls and she resisted the impulse to make herself quiet in solidarity; she let the note be what it was and finished it properly. The building breathed and the tram dinged and somewhere a kettle called the day to order and Verity put her mouth where her life was and didn’t apologise for the sound it made.Chapter 9

The week opened its mouth and breathed hot air straight from a boiler cupboard. Croydon did humidity like it did everything else: with more practicality than romance. The sky pretended to be a soft grey shawl and was, in fact, a lid. Verity watched the damp climb the inside of her window like optimism and wiped a circle with the cuff of her dressing gown to give herself a view she could manage. Somewhere below, a bin lorry made decisions about dignity. The kettle yelped itself into steam and she cupped her hands round the mug to convince her fingers of their job. Under the door there was paper. The ritual had become as ordinary and private as brushing her teeth, and it made her grin in a way she would deny if asked. Sing Smart was back with Tip Seventeen, printed wonky, smug. Practice is not penance. You are not paying off a debt. In pencil, Noah’s note said, If you start flagellating I’m confiscating your metronome you don’t own, and he’d drawn what might be a tiny drum or a biscuit with lines.

The office had a meeting called Town Hall as if hay bales were being prepared in the breakout area. A presentation clicked through slides with colours designed to conceal the absence of news and the presence of words like streamline and align. They were to be restructured but in a way that kept the structure. Verity’s boss wore his football metaphors like medals and announced he was becoming Head of Partnerships, which meant he would be allowed to drink coffee with vendors and call it work. Kemi mouthed the word cape and then did a small mime of a flourish with a stapler. Verity’s role would be “elevated laterally” which was HR for more weight, same height. Her desk would move to a different pod, further from the window she pretended not to need. She watched the map of desks like it was a battlefield, arrows replacing chairs, and felt a small, childish panic, the one that once came with unfamiliar assemblies and new classrooms where no one knew she could smile.

“You all right?” Kemi whispered, because she knew the face Verity made when the ground shuffled two inches to the left.

“I don’t like sitting somewhere that doesn’t know me,” she whispered back, and felt silly at once, and then unapologetic. “Also I am allergic to the hot desk ideology. It feels like hotel bedding. It doesn’t know my head.”

“You can pin a picture of your mug to the wall like an absence made fancy,” Kemi said. “We can practise looking off into the mid-distance like people in aspirational office posters. Also, talent lunch next month again. If HR pushes it one more time I’m bringing a ventriloquist’s dummy to force the issue.”

On the tram after, she found herself looking at wrists. Everyone had one, stacked with watches, hair ties, thin bracelets, the occasional little tattoo with a secret. She imagined putting her voice there, like a thing you flick, check, trust. The conductor dinged the bell and a toddler clapped and then looked surprised at his own approval. At East Croydon, Maya was not there and the absences of people you’ve accidentally built routines around have a shape. The busker’s corner became just a corner again. Verity ended up walking slower past the spot, as if doing a favour to the ghost of a song.

Choir that week arrived with Iris’s scarf tied twice against an aircon that had never accepted a ceasefire. “The term is getting ready to end,” Iris said, eyebrows making shapes about endings and beginnings that didn’t frighten. “We will do a summer concert and then I will let you go to the seaside in your head. You’ll forget how to breathe and then remember. We will be fine.” Lila stood beside the sopranos like a promise, her voice sweet without being syrup, and Verity found she liked her more now that the first gleam had settled into the actual practice of being one voice among many. Iris tried them on a new piece that had a trick of rhythm in it, a syncopation you felt in a place your brain didn’t own. The inner line was a series of handrails set at different heights; miss one and you would fall into tune and think it was safety. Verity missed twice and found them again, the way you find a step in the dark by feeling the air with the side of your foot.

In the break, Marianne produced an apple cake with an apology about sugar and Farah told a story about the day she nearly joined a samba band by accident. Lila slid over with her mug and her competent apology face and said, “I did too much top for too long, I can’t help it. You lot make it safer to be less obvious.” That was a compliment that sounded like a confession, which Verity trusted. “We had a soloist who held notes like he was stealing them,” Lila added, rolling her eyes. “I hope he is happy somewhere, loudly.”

“Iris will never let any of us be the entire song,” Verity said, and they both looked over at Iris, who was at the keyboard tapping the middle C like it owed her rent while her eyebrows did a fast waltz. It was impossible to imagine her tolerating show-offs without instituting a gentle coup.

Brenda called on Wednesday with a tone that suggested gossip held inside her cheeks. “Your Aunt June’s Amy’s boy sent me a thing,” she said. “Of you. From his garage. It’s clever. It sounds like you and also like a person who has done this for ages. He says it’s raw. That’s his word. I don’t like raw unless it’s carrots.”

Verity froze, then thawed through annoyance quick enough to laugh. “He wasn’t supposed to,” she said. “I mean, it isn’t the end of the world. It’s a verse. It’s mine. He shouldn’t have sent it. It’s fine.”

“I didn’t send it to anyone,” Brenda said, prim as a vicar. “I put the mouse on it and couldn’t figure how to make it smaller and that felt like a sign. Don’t worry. I just wanted to say I liked the bit where your voice does that honest thing. It sounds like when you were little but without the shouting.”

The apology that had once lived at the top of her throat snuck up and then sat back down. “Thanks,” she said. “We’re doing the church thing on Saturday. The end-of-term one. If you want to bring sausage rolls again, we won’t turn you away.”

“The tin is ready,” said Brenda, pleased. “Your father has been practising clapping with his palms. He says it feels extravagant, which he likes. Also, does your neighbour like sausage rolls? He looks like a man who has learned to accept provisions.”

“He is rinsing mugs as we speak,” Verity said, because she could hear the swish through the wall, and then she hung up and laughed to herself because this was what being alive did; it gave you connections where you thought you needed privacy, and it made privacy a luxury you only sometimes wanted.

The re-desk at work happened with the sound of furniture remembering it had legs. Verity watched her plant (Basil, who had always been more stoic than green) wobble on a trolley like a brave passenger. She followed the migration to a pod nearer the printer and further from the window with the view of IKEA’s flags, and she sat down and found that she could do her job without the particular patch of London that had been her anchor. Kemi appeared like a cat under a different table and settled on the edge of the new desk as if testing it for kindness.

“You look like your furniture has been insulted,” Kemi observed, peeling the label off a bottle of juice in long satisfying strips. “Martin says his new desk is haunted by the last guy’s secrets and he’s started blessing his stapler. Do you require incense?”

“I require certainty,” Verity said, installing her mug on its coaster like a small ceremony. “Failing that, cake.”

“Cake has become your only ideology,” Kemi said approvingly. “I respect that. Also, HR are asking for volunteers for their mental health champion thing and I have never been more tempted to stand up and say I will if we stop calling it champion like we’re giving out sashes.”

Noah’s printout came the next morning with the corner of the page damp and two small circles where a cup had stood. Tip Eighteen: Don’t practise crisis. Practise easy, then take easy somewhere harder. In pencil: Come stand near the pianos at Centrale at lunch. There’s a charity thing with a keyboard where nobody tunes anything. It will make you brave in a useful way. Verity took her sandwich-that-was-mostly an excuse to leave the building and found the little stage near the escalators where a charity she knew only by the look of its buckets had set up. A teenage boy with hair like he distrusted scissors was serenading the food court with a version of a pop song that sounded like rain on aluminium siding. A woman with a small badge that said Please Donate looked delighted and bewildered. Maya stood off to the side with her guitar case, which was news and also not; of course she had connections to every ad hoc stage within the tram zone.

“We need glue,” Maya said from the side of her mouth as if somebody might tell them off for speaking before they had donated. “He keeps going to the tune and the keyboard has decided to be mordant. Give me a second line so the escalator doesn’t cry.”

Verity slid in next to the boy’s melody like a person pulling into a lane in traffic, and the sound made a little table between them that the food court didn’t fall off. “Thanks,” the boy said afterwards, not meeting her eye because gratitude was new to his face. “I panic when the lights are like this. The floor makes me think of swimming pools. I can’t explain it.”

“It’s all right,” she said, because authority you don’t have is useful when someone else needs it. “Sing to the woman with the bucket. She has the kind of face that will give you back what you sent.”

He looked, nodded, found that she was right, and squared his shoulders like a person putting on a sensible shirt. Noah watched from near the sunglasses kiosk pretending to be interested in polarized lenses, and when it was done he did a small salute with two fingers like a man who had been forced into the army of feelings and was making the best of it. They walked out together under the sky’s lid, and he asked the kind of questions that make conversation look like a relaxed animal: how are you sleeping, what are you feeding yourself, do you own a chair that doesn’t hurt you.

“Tell me your thing,” she said, because reciprocity isn’t virtue so much as a way to stop talking to yourself. “Your next thing. You have that look like you’re thinking of learning a new word.”

He made a face like he’d been found out by a dog. “There’s a course,” he said, as if that were unlikely. “Operating Department Practitioner. Hands and breath and theatres. A step up. A step in. I don’t know. I’m late for new starts, is the thing.”

“You’re not,” she said, and for a second she could hear Iris in her voice, the eyebrows in punctuation. “Your age has nothing to do with this except that it gives you a neck. I’m singing in front of people at forty-three. We are on the same train. It doesn’t matter where we boarded.”

“They say personal statements,” he said, grimacing. “They want a narrative where I am plucky. I am not yet ready to be plucky in a font.”

“Tell them the thing you told me in my kitchen,” she said. “About bones and boys who learn car parts. Tell them you’re good at moving heavy things that don’t want to be told they’re heavy. Tell them about the woman who sang to herself. Make it true enough they forgive your punctuation.”

Back at the flats, a note had appeared on the building’s noticeboard printed, cut with scissors that had gone blunt on carpet, and fixed with four different kinds of tape. Could Residents Be Mindful of Noise Late at Night, Especially Singing, Thank You, The Management. There was no management, only Mr De Souza in 2B, and he did not write like that. Verity stared at the capitalised singing like it was a person she knew being told off in public. For a second the old shame leapt up like a badly trained dog. Noah stood with his hands in his back pockets and read it like an x-ray.

“Passive-aggro as a genre,” he said. “We can put something next to it. Sing Smart For Neighbours. Tip One: if you hear joy and it isn’t for you, remember you are allowed to be annoyed in a private way and still not be the main character.”

Verity laughed even as some treacherous part of her tried to smooth her breath for the rest of the evening. “We’ll bake Mr De Souza a cake,” she said. “Or we’ll talk to the family upstairs and see if it was about them. Or none of the above. I don’t want to stop. That’s the headline.”

“We can put time limits on your corner,” he said, practical offering dressed as tenderness. “Nine p.m. curfew. That way your rebel has boundaries and your neighbour has a bedtime.”

She liked that: rebel with a bedtime. It made her feel like she could hold both grown-up and child in the same set of ribs. That night she obeyed the curfew like it was holy and found that the hour before nine obliged with more attention than the hours after had ever done, like hunger being not an enemy but a collaborator.

The tape player, being an artefact rather than a servant, chose the next evening to throw a tantrum. She fed it the cassette like a horse a sugar cube, and it clacked its teeth and wound and then caught and began to munch. She pressed eject in that useless, surgical way people do when panic wants it both quick and gentle. The tape ribbon vomited half out like intestines in a schoolbook Greek myth. She stood with the mess in her hands and felt herself nine, over a craft project, ruined. The part of her that once said everything precious will be broken if you hold it looked triumphant. Noah’s knock came with the uncanny timing of a man whose job relied on entering chaos politely.

“Stationery,” he announced, and held up a pencil, ominously. They sat at the little kitchen table like conspirators in the smallest of kidnappings and wound the brown ribbon back with the pencil like it was 1993 and homework for a different subject. He held the cassette tape like a sparrow while she turned the rubbery spools, and the steadying of it worked on her chest as if your body learned from your fingers.

“Why are our hearts attached to such ridiculous machines,” she said, only half joking.

“Because they’re honest,” he said. “You can see what went wrong. You can wind it back. The red light in a studio tells you nothing except that someone thinks it matters. This tells you exactly where the snag is and makes you be slow.” He smiled into the tape player’s open mouth like he had forgiven it personally, and she felt the ridiculous urge to kiss the side of his head like a friend, which meant she needed to look at the kettle and practise not conflating warmth with any of the other weather systems that could sweep a life.

Saturday was unforgivingly union of sky and skin. The choir arrived at St Michael’s with cardigans for faith, which they draped on pews when the nave stored heat like a secret. The vicar gave them the proper smile of a man who finds the presence of art heartening as long as it does not interfere with the biscuits. Iris ran them through the set as if pressing a crisp uniform and implored the tenors to act as if they were not eagles on cliffs but sensible men with neighbours. The church filled with that pre-event murmur that a body recognises as safety even in buildings built to make you bow. Verity’s two minutes loomed again on the page of her day like a small, polite mountain. She stood at the lectern and loved it, and was a bit sick about it, and then did it anyway, and the room agreed to hold her words as something other than a performance.

Maya came late and left a bag of cherries on a pew like a person who has learned to tithe. Lila sang a line that was so clean people looked up and then, crucially, looked down again and kept breathing. The inner line held, stubborn and kind. At the edge of the last echo, the door at the back opened and three paramedics came in quiet as cats and wheeled a man to a seat. He sat and listened as if he had planned it, which he probably hadn’t, and his face, which had been in pain recently, practiced what it might look like to be bored again, and Verity thought if this is all we get to do, it will do.

Afterwards, there was too much lemonade and an assortment of baking that told you which Christian had a grudge with another. Brenda pressed sausage rolls into the palms of people whose palms had not planned ahead. Her father clapped full-handed with boyish delight and then looked around as if someone might take his joy away for reallocation, and Verity put her arm through his and said, “It’s all right,” because sometimes adulthood runs backwards with purpose. In the churchyard, under blackbirds who were overexcited about the theology of worms, Noah arrived with a face that had been used all day and said, “We moved the beds round in AAU because a light was making a room a bad place to be. It felt like sculpture with bodies. I got into an argument with a surgeon who thinks he is God, and then your singing was on someone’s phone and now I’m embarrassed by the idea of having an argument with anyone ever.”

“You’d be unbearable as a monk,” she said, and he watered the grass with some laughter he had clearly been saving.

The following week at work, the restructure found its teeth. An email arrived with her name in the subject line and the kind of grammar that makes you wish to die. They were redistributing responsibilities. She would keep procurement but be responsible for onboarding three clients her boss had collected with a handshake and a promise that they were easy. The clients were not easy; they had opinions about cardboard and existentialism. She wrote a list and then burned it electronically and then wrote another list and asked Kemi to sit on it. Kemi coloured in the list’s bullet points with a highlighter in alternating shades and said, “You can do it but only if you continue to be less perfect than your adolescence ordained. Also, I put your name down for the Talent Lunch as a member of the audience who sits conspicuously. That is the only volunteering I will ever do at this company.”

There was a page under the door that night with Tip Nineteen: Jealousy is a key. It tells you what you want. Do not swallow it whole; unlock something. In pencil, Noah had added, I was jealous of surgeons for years and then I saw their socks. You’re fine. He’d drawn a sock with an angry argyle. She pinned the page above the kettle, which felt like an appropriate shrine, and tried to be honest about her own flares of envy when Lila’s line got a little press in the pews, when Maya’s sticker on her guitar looked cooler than truth, when Kemi could flirt with a sandwich and get the better end of the conversation. Her jealousy was dull; it turned out, unsurprisingly, that what she wanted was more of what she already had begun, not someone else’s shape in miniature.

Maya messaged on Thursday at two in the morning because musicians are timed differently. Do you want to put a verse on the Croydon song? I made one about cranes that sounded like I wanted to marry a building. Help. Verity saw it at seven like a normal human and replied at seven-oh-five like someone excited, with four options that approached cranes as birds and as machines and as the posture a human has when watching something grow. Maya sent back a voice note of herself laughing and pretending to applaud and a new verse that made room for Verity’s and did not flatten it. It felt like literacy to write that way with another person, to share not only nouns but the service of making them sing.

At the Oval on Sunday, the list had more new names than usual. At least three of them had hearts drawn next to them by other hands, which meant enthusiasm unaccountably persisted. The landlady had put a sign on the bar that said No Wonderwall unless you are brilliant and yes, we can tell, which made Verity like her more than was necessary. When her turn came, she did the smart thing and did the precise one, not the impressive one, the song that behaved. She let Maya take the shiny line and she built the steps. It worked in the way chairs work; you notice them mostly by their absence. A man with a hearing aid she’d seen before came up at the interval and said, “It is a relief sometimes to have someone in a room doing the second thing very well,” and she could have kissed his useful old face, but she settled for the near-clap you do when you want to turn somebody into a medal.

On the tram home, she sat with her mouth comfortably unused and her mind making the kind of plans that felt less like maps and more like postcards from a sensible future. Do the course, she wanted to text Noah without preamble. He had sent nothing for a couple of days, which meant he was in a ward that ate time. When she got in, she found a page under the door turned face down, as if advice had got shy. She turned it. Tip Twenty: Every chorus waited. No one walks in belonging. In pencil, Noah had written, I asked for the application. I need three references. I’m pretending that’s not three confessions. Will you be one. She made a sound that surprised the hallway into echoing back like a yes from a cave. She wrote back in real pen on the margin, yes, I will tell them you know the names of bones and biscuits, and she folded the paper in half and pushed it under his door like a person who trusted the correct floor to take her weight.

The family upstairs had a late one that Friday. Feet like drama, laughter like weather, cutlery like percussion. Someone put a pan down hard on a hob, and someone else apologised in a language that kissed its consonants different. Verity lay awake and didn’t mind. Noise didn’t feel like theft anymore; it was finance. The next morning, in the soft corner that had become a place to ride out forecasts, she found the note her Year 6 teacher had written in green on the back of that old photograph—Good projection, could listen more when others read—and laughed until she made a noise that wasn’t singing and wasn’t a cry and did exactly the job. She could listen more now. She could. She had built a life in which her projection didn’t knock anyone else off their line.

On Monday someone stuck up a new notice in the lobby in an entirely different font and tone. Thank you to whoever is singing. It’s made my plant grow, no word of a lie. Please invite me to your concert, unless you are terrible, in which case keep your secrets. Apartment 4C. It was signed with a drawing of a plant that looked like Basil might if he had a cousin. Verity took her phone out and took a photograph and sent it to Kemi, who replied with thirty-seven heart emojis and the words consider this legal permission to be yourself. Noah added, unofficially, an addendum to the Sing Smart pamphlet and taped it under the thank-you. Tip For Neighbours: If you want quiet, ask. If you want silence, move. All of our bodies are social. He had drawn a tram dinging what could only be considered applause.

The sky finally, abruptly, remembered summer. The town shifted its shoulders and revealed white arms at last. At lunch, the sun hit the IKEA flags and made them look like they were going to do something useful for once. Verity and Kemi sat on the low wall outside as if it were an amphitheatre and ate supermarket sushi and debated the ethics of hummus. Kemi asked about the course Noah wanted and Verity told her the bones and the biscuits and the references and Kemi said, “Ah, so we’ll have to raise a glass to institutions being wise, will we,” and Verity said yes, and the word felt like a button she could press that did not break anything.

Choir was smaller that week because life is like that. Iris had them stand in a close oval so that even those who would have backed away were held by geometry. “We’ll do the Croydon song,” Iris said, surprising Verity until she realised Maya must have been in Iris’s ear like a happy bee. “Everything in this town becomes liturgy eventually. Why not this.” They sang cranes and kebab boxes and Boxpark and the river that bargains, and Verity’s second lines went under and through like hands carrying plates to the table and nobody dropped anything. Lila, to her credit, backed away from a solo instinct as if taught by a patient dog. Iris’s eyebrows said yes in a perfectly legible script.

After, in the foyer, the vicar from St Michael’s appeared like a handsome apology and asked if they would bring their noise to a wedding with the caveat that they would be paid in prosecco and thanks. Iris did her maths aloud and accepted with the kind of grace that meant the couple would get the good version of anything that day. “You can do the call,” Iris said to Verity like there had never been a time when she wouldn’t. “There will be a live aunt. There is always a live aunt. Be brave in a way that makes her love you.”

There were messages on her phone from Eden about Saturday, which would contain the twins doing a routine to a number creatively described as contemporary about climate change that was mostly stomping and grace. Brenda had sent a photograph of a new scarf in the kind of green that says I have entered a garden centre and given myself to it. Drew had sent a thumbs-up and a link to a thing called reverb plugins that she ignored like a person dodging a survey in a shopping centre. Maya had sent a voice note from a bus that said, in a sleepy grin, I like your underbits, which sounds worse than I mean it but is the foundation of my appreciation. Noah had sent nothing and that was fine because sometimes lack of result meant that action was finally doing its work somewhere useful where phones could not reach.

Verity went home on the tram with her mouth closed and a feeling in her chest that didn’t have a word but did not need one. The building breathed her up the stairs. There wasn’t a piece of paper under the door and she missed it and decided to be the person who put one there instead. She sat at the table, wrote Tip For Singers Twenty-One in biro on lined paper and stuck it under his with a piece of tape that was running out but trying its best. Don’t apologise to the air for using it. If anyone asks you to, invite them to join and give them a part. She added in pencil, You will be accepted because you have always been the sort of person who carried sofas with strangers without needing to be the one who picked the colour.

In the soft corner she sang for exactly as long as her curfew allowed and then some, and when she stopped she found she had not bitten the inside of her mouth while making noises, which she took as a sign of something that could be called health, if we were generous. Outside, the tram suggested the hour. Upstairs, someone muttered and then laughed, and the laugh went through the concrete the way thaw goes through ground. She turned off the big light, left the small one on, and sat on the floor with her back to her bed in the ridiculous den like a person who had learned how to play in a way the neighbours could stand. She thought of the cranes. She thought of wrists. She thought of a course application sitting in someone’s inbox because all the right electrons had pushed. She thought of sausages in a tin and apples in a cake and tape wound back with pencil. She thought of the word glue and did not resent it. She let the night arrive without being entertained, which is one definition of peace, the affordable kind, the one you can make at home without a licence.
