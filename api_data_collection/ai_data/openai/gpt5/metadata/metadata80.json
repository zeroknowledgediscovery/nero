     "novel_text": "On most nights the river looks like a belt of slate. It holds the late sun in its buckle; the city collects itself in the reflection, old stone and new glass smudged into soft moving lines. I cut across St George\u2019s Quay with a tray tucked under my arm and the smell of chips in my sleeves. The Blue Otter\u2019s sign squeaks when the wind wobbles it\u2014someone\u2019s meant to oil the hook; someone always forgets. Everything is always on a list. I push open the heavy door with my hip, and the place breathes at me: frying oil, spilled cider, lemon slices drying to pale husks in the metal pots.\n\n\u201cJacob,\u201d yells Shaz from behind the bar. \u201cYour table\u2019s moaning for their mains.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Jake,\u201d I say reflexively, but Shaz is already turning away, balancing three pints in one hand. Everyone calls me Jacob but I like the bookshop-soft vowels of Jake. When I was a kid in Skerton, my mother put her hand around the word as if to warm it. Jaaake. I tie on my apron, knot it twice, and go to collect the plates.\n\nThere\u2019s a rhythm to the place\u2014bell, shout, scrape of chairs, laughter, that moment where everything thins to a sharp line and then thickens back into chatter. I slide plates beside elbows and smile until the muscles in my face twitch with their own odd life. I remember you from last week. You had calamari. Did we sort your extra lemon?\n\nA group of women at the corner table are out for a birthday and they are stretched tight with jokes and Prosecco. One has a sash that says THIRTY, FLIRTY &... some other word I can't make out because the ribbon has fallen into her chips. She winks at me. There\u2019s confetti in the near-dark; it will get into the carpet and glitter for months. Outside, someone whips a motorbike along the quay; its sound rattles the windows. I set bowls on the table: the fish stew, the schnitzel that looks like a toasted map of some lost country, the vegan burger that always leaks beet juice like a wound.\n\n\u201cLove,\u201d says the sash woman, \u201care you still doing the early bird deal?\u201d\n\nI give the answer she wants to hear and then the answer that exists on paper and make a joke that lands well enough. My jokes are serviceable. Above us, the ceiling is brown from a leak that was fixed but not painted. I look at it sometimes and feel like it is an organ with a scab.\n\n\u201cYou heard?\u201d says Morris, fishing chef, as I duck into the kitchen. He is big in the way of men who have stopped apologizing for it, with soft eyes that never look squarely at your mouth when you talk. He flips a piece of cod like it\u2019s light, like air.\n\n\u201cHeard what?\u201d\n\n\u201cFinalists are being confirmed today. My niece\u2019s got a mate who does tech for that show. Britain\u2019s Talent. Got one of the kids from Preston in. The magician with the cards. Ridiculous fingers.\u201d He wiggles his own. \u201cYou\u2019ll get a call.\u201d\n\nHe says it like weather. I laugh because I don\u2019t know what else to do with my mouth. He doesn\u2019t know that when I tie my apron I loop the knot the way my mother taught me and say\u2014to myself, in a whisper\u2014let them see you, let them see you, three times. He doesn\u2019t know that the knot is the only thing keeping my stomach from flying off in some odd balloon.\n\n\u201cMaybe,\u201d I say. \u201cIf they want a waiter messing up \u2018Bridge over Troubled Water\u2019 for the nation.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour voice could butter toast,\u201d Morris says, and he turns back to his grill.\n\nI sang on my break the first time, because Laura, who does coffees and knows a bit about everything, was learning the ukulele, and the chord shapes made my hands itch. Bring it here, I said, and we went out by the bins, and she played some clumsy Gs and Cs under my voice and I opened my chest and watched steam leave me. Three trickling pigeons watched us as if we were the most interesting bins in Lancashire. Then we went back in and I dropped three forks and knocked over a glass and Shaz called me a hazard but with a half-smile. It was Laura who sent the video to the show, late at night, giggling, making shushing motions with a finger. A week later\u2014I mean three months; memory makes the pacing wrong\u2014it turned out that the video had its own life, bobbing around Facebook like a paper boat that somehow doesn't get soggy. A producer with a soft phone voice called. We did prelims. I stood in front of judges with faces like statues cheered up for TV and sang a song my mother used to clean to, and the clapping came like rain. Stuff happens like it\u2019s always happens. And then you go back to carrying cutlery.\n\n\u201cOrder up,\u201d says Morris. I carry messages from his mouth to the mouths of other people.\n\nAt half-nine I take a tray to the beer garden, which is really just a yard with fairy lights that someone pulled from a Poundland box and wove into loops. Labrador flopping under a table. The Lune is a smear of silver. The customers\u2019 faces are all angles and glow. There\u2019s a breeze that I feel in my hair but not on my cheeks, which is strange. My cheeks are too hot. I blink. The fairy lights flicker. For a second the labrador looks at me and then looks at a point slightly to the right of me, ears pricked, and I feel in my throat that peculiar drop\u2014like a lift starting before your body\u2019s agreed. I shake it off. Someone whistles the first bar of \u201cHey Jude\u201d and everything goes on.\n\nAfter close, I sit on the back steps with a cup of water and a single cigarette that I keep telling myself is the last one. The alley stinks of steady bin. Laura nudges the door open with her hip and sits beside me.\n\n\u201cGot a message?\u201d she says. She always sounds as if you should have had one, and you\u2019re being unreasonable by not yet having had it.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d I say. \u201cBut Morris says it\u2019s today.\u201d\n\nShe blows her hair off her forehead. \u201cMorris says lots of things,\u201d she says. \u201cHe says he once saw Robbie Williams buying ham at nine in the morning. Like, good for Robbie.\u201d\n\n\u201cEveryone needs ham,\u201d I say.\n\n\u201cYou,\u201d she pokes me in the forearm, \u201cneed to stop pretending it hasn\u2019t already happened. We\u2019ve done all this. Audition. Standing ovation. You cried in the toilets and pretended you hadn\u2019t. My mum texted me full caps. At some point you\u2019re going to have to admit that you\u2019re not just a waiter, and the world\u2019s weird enough to make room for your big old ballad heart.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou call my heart a ball,\u201d I say, \u201cand yet claim to be my friend.\u201d\n\nShe leans her shoulder into mine. \u201cI\u2019ll be offended later.\u201d She stares out into the alley. The light from the little motion sensor flares and dims, like the alley is a creature taking slow breaths. \u201cYou feel that?\u201d\n\n\u201cFeel what?\u201d\n\nShe shivers and rubs the skin of her forearm briskly. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Like the air\u2019s off. I\u2019m being daft.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou and your second sight,\u201d I say, but someone else\u2019s laughter\u2014one of the early leavers walking down Bulk Road\u2014rolls into our alley and feels like a tide after a ferry has passed. Displaced. Late. I stub my cigarette and push myself up. The night is long and my bed is short.\n\nOn my way home, I walk by the Priory. The castle sits heavy and black, a shape that the sky forgot to fill in. My trainers scuff on the pebbled walkway. I hum to myself. I should be saving my voice, but if I keep it in too tight I get wired and things buzz at the edges of my eyes. An ambulance hisses past up the hill and turns off its siren as it rounds the corner. There are shadows that gnaw at corners you didn\u2019t know the day had carved. I think of my mother\u2019s flat up on Ridge. Think of her calendar\u2014twelve pictures of cats in odd hats\u2014and the way she circles things she\u2019s looking forward to and things she\u2019s dreading, the same circle, same pen. She puts a little face beside each. Happy if it\u2019s a hair appointment. Sad if it\u2019s the dentist. On the day with my audition she\u2019d drawn a little rocket.\n\nI knew she would get distracted on the day of the prelim by something she couldn\u2019t explain. My mother has a mind like a crooked drawer; things slide forward or back. She watched my first audition on catch-up with a blanket on her lap and sent me a voice note with a lot of sniffing that said, proud of you, proud of your face, proud of your heart. Also when are you coming round for tea. It is always pride and tea with my mother.\n\nMy phone is a rectangle of cold in my pocket. When I take it out it makes a shape of light on my palm that feels like holding someone else\u2019s hand. No messages. No missed calls. I put it back and then take it out again and then put it back, as if I\u2019m trying to teach it a routine. There\u2019s a fox on the pavement outside the old bookshop, ragged and fine. It looks at me a long time. There are many jokes about foxes and bins. We nod at each other like men on their way to different boats.\n\nThe flat smells of washing powder and the garlic I burned yesterday morning because I was making pasta while half-thinking about the run-through. I rinse a bowl that I didn\u2019t finish my cereal in. I pour it again, because I am sure the universe had meant for me to finish that first bowl and it feels rude to it not to. I eat sitting on the arm of the sofa, which is silly and safer than it feels. The television throws faces at the wall, none of them mine. A laugh track laughs. I turn it off and the silence rushes and fills the room like water coming back into something you had been holding under.\n\nIt is late when the call comes and it doesn\u2019t come. It is earlier when the call comes and it does. I will tell you both because that\u2019s how it felt.\n\nThere\u2019s a good kind of dread where everything in you is awake. At half eleven my phone screen blooms: Number withheld. It\u2019s such a pompous way to say no. I let it ring once, twice. I consider letting it go just to feel the drama of it. I don\u2019t. I answer and say hello in the careful tone you use when you might be speaking to somebody who will change your life (again).\n\n\u201cHello, is that Jacob Hargreaves?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2026 is. Hi.\u201d\n\n\u201cHi Jacob,\u201d says the voice. It is a woman\u2019s voice, pills of white sound on her words like she\u2019s in a big room. \u201cIt\u2019s Gemma from the Britain\u2019s Got Talent team. Are you well?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m good,\u201d I say, and then I say, like a man who has seen too many dramas where they talk about receipts and budgets, \u201cI\u2019m well, thank you.\u201d\n\n\u201cLovely,\u201d she says. She is smiling. I can hear a smile like I can hear rain starting on a car roof I\u2019m not in. \u201cJust calling with some exciting news. We\u2019d be delighted for you to perform in the live final.\u201d\n\nThere is a moment\u2014there is always a moment\u2014where the words roll toward you and you think they\u2019ll bounce off your chest and scatter on the floor and you\u2019ll have to sheepishly pick them up and put them into some other sentence. But they don\u2019t. They land. They go in. To be precise, they drop like a small stone into a very deep well.\n\n\u201cI\u2026\u201d I say, and then I push my breath out and it takes some words with it. \u201cYes,\u201d I say. \u201cI mean, oh my God, yes.\u201d I find myself pacing the rug in two steps and then back two steps. There is a version of me on other days who would have acted cooler. He has better hair. He is in a shirt. \u201cThank you. That\u2019s\u2014thank you so much.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re thrilled,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s been a joy to watch your journey.\u201d She makes it sound like a train. \u201cWe\u2019ll send over your call sheet and some details. You\u2019ll need to be in London for rehearsals on Thursday. How are you getting here?\u201d\n\n\u201cI can drive,\u201d I say, because I\u2019ve already worked it out and it\u2019s been the same every way I tried it\u2014train too expensive, coach too long, hold onto the dented little car Laura\u2019s cousin wants to sell me for a hundred quid until Friday. \u201cI can be there.\u201d\n\n\u201cPerfect,\u201d she says. And then there\u2019s a lot of confirming that I will be me when I get there, and talk of wardrobe and press, and an email follows the call like a dog follows runners.\n\nWhen the call doesn\u2019t come, I go to bed with my hands clenched. At three a.m. I scroll through videos of people I don\u2019t know making pancakes, or building sheds, or playing with dogs that make snorting pig sounds. I pat my phone and say to it, quietly, don\u2019t forget me, which is ridiculous because it is glass and metal and will do what it does without my tenderness. At four I dream about a corridor and a door that opens only from the other side, and a voice saying dear, straight through me. When I wake, it is with the taste of salt, though I haven\u2019t been to the sea in weeks.\n\nWhen the call has come\u2014when it has done its delicate tumble into my day\u2014I make a sound in my empty flat that is not music and is not not. I am grinning. I am suddenly close to tears. I sit down on the floor and then stand back up. There is a point where joy and terror are so close that you can\u2019t tell them apart. It seems cheap to say that. It\u2019s still true. I call my mother. The call connects and then doesn\u2019t, then does. Her voice answers\u2014my mother\u2019s voicemail. She has never figured out how to make it say her name. The automated woman tells me that she is not here. I talk to the not-here woman as if she is my mum. I make a joke that my mother would laugh at and the woman says, sorry, please leave your message after the tone, and the tone happens like a bird hitting a window.\n\n\u201cMum,\u201d I say. \u201cWe did it. We proper did it. They want me in the final.\u201d I tell her the times and the place. \u201cI\u2019ll come round tomorrow. I\u2019ll pick up those plastic containers you want back.\u201d I am making lists now because sometimes lists are bridges between you and the place you\u2019re going to. I hang up. I call Laura and she picks up after one ring.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you dare tell me you didn\u2019t get it,\u201d she says without hello.\n\n\u201cI got it,\u201d I say, and then I am listening to my friend screaming across town, the sound scudding past chimney pots and the castle and the place where the KFC used to be before it became a vape shop.\n\n\u201cGet in,\u201d she says. \u201cGet absolutely in. We\u2019re going to\u2014what do you want us to do? Do you want confetti? I have some somewhere. No I don\u2019t. Shaz will have confetti. She\u2019s got the soul of a christening. We\u2019re going to make you a banner. We\u2019re going to\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to take my Thursday shift,\u201d I say. I can hear the grin in her answer.\n\n\u201cRude,\u201d she says. \u201cYes.\u201d\n\nI go to the window. The street below is thin and blue. My breath does a strange thing, makes a cloud and then folds itself back into me. Someone is walking their dog in a big circle around nothing, letting it sniff at last night. The dog pauses, turns its head like it has heard my window, and looks up. For a second, I think it\u2019s making eye contact with me, and then it tilts, peering to one side, like I am a wind chime it can hear but not see. It whines, half-hearted, and the owner tugs. Come on then, come on. I watch them until they turn the corner.\n\nOn Wednesday, word has gotten ahead of me. I walk into The Blue Otter and there\u2019s a cardboard glitter cut-out of a star taped to the espresso machine, with JAKE written across it in a handwriting that I recognize as Shaz\u2019s\u2014too neat for a person who wears as many rings as she does. Someone\u2019s hung a pair of tights from the chalkboard sign and written Knock \u2018em dead underneath, then crossed out dead and replaced it with silly in smaller letters. Laura gives me a hug with her arms wrapped too tight and then too loose. Morris gives me a bag of throat sweets wrapped in cellophane, like a present for a child who\u2019s got through a sorely bearable operation. A man I do not recognize, bald, with a smile like a line drawn quickly, claps my shoulder.\n\n\u201cProud of you, lad,\u201d he says, as if he has known me since I was in nappies. \u201cDon\u2019t forget us when you\u2019re famous.\u201d\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t if I tried,\u201d I say, and it comes out too earnest, and I feel the flush burn my neck. He laughs kindly and returns to his Guinness. They are all kind, today, even the woman who once told me, after I dropped the cutlery on her lap, that she had known my sort, with our stupid hair and our stupid dreams. She pushes a plate of chips toward the edge of the table so I won\u2019t have to stretch as far.\n\nAt three in the afternoon, after the lunch rush, I stand in the alley again with Laura and sing under my breath. The alley sounds different when you sing in it. The sound bounces around like sympathetic birds. I warm up gently\u2014lip trills, me-me-me mes that feel ridiculous and necessary\u2014and then I try the first verse of the song I\u2019ve chosen. It is a song my mother played on a CD in the car while we crossed the Bay Bridge on Sundays when she still drove just because it was a thing to do. The words sit in my mouth and don\u2019t fight me. When I finish the verse, the air feels warmer. Someone from the kitchen throws out a bag of peelings and they thump against the bin lid. For a flicker moment I think I see myself reflected in the dull metal, but it\u2019s the sky and a pigeon, and the shape of a thing you expect to be there.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve nailed it,\u201d Laura says. \u201cDon\u2019t overthink. You always overthink and then you miss the easy note.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not overthinking,\u201d I say, which is not true, but I\u2019ve learnt that if you say a lie quietly enough it hopes itself into being brave.\n\nThe rest of the day stretches into a long, strange cloth. A man in a pink shirt leaves me a tenner tip and a drawing of a fish on the receipt, with eyes that look like a little pair of question marks. A woman with a soft black cardigan gives me a napkin folded around a St Christopher medal and says, \u201cMy Tony wore this when he was on the radio,\u201d and I say thank you and then he died anyway hangs there and I want to fill it with the appropriate words, and I do not know what the appropriate words are. I touch the metal. It is warm. It keeps its warmth for longer than I expect.\n\nAt closing time, a kid\u2014he can\u2019t be eighteen\u2014comes in and asks for a glass of water. His face is too old with tired. Shaz gives him a glass and a packet of crisps and doesn\u2019t say anything until he has eaten, and then she gives him a name of a place down the road that can help you if you\u2019re between lucks and he says thank you as if he is practicing gratitude for his future. The world is full of people doing the best they can with hands that are a little too small. God, listen to me. I\u2019m becoming one of those blokes who makes metaphors out of sandwiches.\n\nWhen I get home I sit on the floor again because the floor feels honest. The email from the show is long and exact. There are call times that are very early. There are rules about social media and about what I can wear and what I cannot. There is a polite request\u2014no logos, no slogans, no political statements. There\u2019s a line that says travel at your own risk and then a line that says we will do everything we can to assist. It is a lot and not enough. I skim and then go back and this is how it goes when your brain is busy; it puts a bookmark in everything and then loses the book. I put the kettle on and forget and then it boils and makes that high steam scream like a very small train. I don\u2019t know what to do with my arms. I make a list, handwritten, because that makes it more unbreakable.\n\n\u2013 call Mum, again\n\u2013 pack shirts (white, grey, the blue one if the buttons don\u2019t look cheap)\n\u2013 trousers (don\u2019t wear the chinos that make your knees look like boiled eggs)\n\u2013 shoes (polish them, don\u2019t pretend it doesn\u2019t matter)\n\u2013 charger / spare\n\u2013 throat spray / water / honey\n\u2013 St Christopher medal? (if she won\u2019t miss it)\n\nI stare at the question mark. The medal sits on the counter like it would melt if I looked away. I drape it over a mug. The mug is from a charity shop and says BEST DAD in blue letters. I bought it because it made me laugh like swallowing a hiccup. My dad left when I was eight, taking half a sofa\u2019s worth of clothes and a toolbox in a shopping bag, and left his wedding ring in the soap dish like it had become the wrong size. He lives near Leeds now with a woman named Mandy and a dog named Soup. He sends me money on Christmas Eve every year, no message. Once he sent it on the twenty-third and I thought perhaps he\u2019d changed and then I realised it was a bank thing with weekends. I don\u2019t know what I would say if he phoned me. I don\u2019t know what he would say. There is a lot people don\u2019t say on purpose, because they are worried it will make a thing worse, and then the not-saying is what makes a thing hard.\n\nI try Mum again. The voicemail is there again, like a small black pool you can send words into. I send them. I tell her I\u2019ll set out early. I lean my forehead against the windowpane for a cool second, and watch the street. The street watches back with a little tattoo of reflections.\n\nI sleep badly. I dream of ladders and a hand I cannot see, and a kettle placed over the wrong ring of a cooker, and a line of children in angel costumes, and my own voice wrong in my mouth. I wake with my heart in my throat and it takes me a minute to swallow it back. The morning makes everything silly anyway. I tug on my jeans and make toast and burn the first slice and scrape it anyway because that\u2019s what you do if you\u2019ve lived here long enough and your mother taught you not to waste things even when the economy is a face you do not recognize.\n\nHalfway through my second tea, the phone rings again. I think, what else can they need to tell me, and then it is my mother. Actually my mother, not the woman who makes her absence into an automated courtesy.\n\n\u201cJacob,\u201d she says. She never calls me Jake. She hasn\u2019t since she caught me kissing my elbow in a mirror and laughing as a toddler. Somehow the name got cemented there and she won\u2019t scrape it off. \u201cThey\u2019ve been talking about you on the radio.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey have?\u201d\n\n\u201cOn Radio Lancashire,\u201d she says. \u201cI phoned in. I told them you used to sing to the cats.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, Mum,\u201d I say, sitting down because this is both the best and the worst thing. \u201cWhat did they say?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey said, \u2018He sounds a right one, your son,\u2019 and I said, \u2018He\u2019s a delight,\u2019 and they said, \u2018Good luck to him,\u2019 and I said, \u2018He doesn\u2019t need luck, he\u2019s got flair.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cFlair,\u201d I say. \u201cThat\u2019s me.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re doing a quiz next,\u201d she says, as if this is important too. \u201cDo you need chips? I could make you a package. I don\u2019t know how that works with the motorway but we could try.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d I say. \u201cCome with me? To London?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh love,\u201d she says, and her no sits on the line like a cushion. \u201cYou know trains. Me and trains. And your Auntie Lila\u2019s coming round because she wants to see what I\u2019ve done with the pelargoniums. You\u2019ll send me a picture.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can watch it live,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019ll wave.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got the Freeview now,\u201d she says, and I can hear the pride in her voice, as if she personally invented it. \u201cI love you, pet.\u201d\n\n\u201cLove you too,\u201d I say, and I want to say, will you be all right, truly, will you be all right in a house that sometimes does all its own weird noises at once, will you be all right if the kettle breaks again, and I don\u2019t, because she will be all right and she will not be all right whether I say it or not. I promise to come Sunday. We will eat freezer pizza with extra toppings and she will pick bits of ham off and give them to the cat. The cat is called Rachel. There is no reason for this.\n\nAfter I hang up, I sit very still until the kettle clicks just to let me know it is alive. I look around my flat. I see, as if through someone else\u2019s eyes, the places where I have not tidied. The sweater on the chair like a person is wearing it on the wrong day. The mug ring on the table. The shoes by the door, one lying on its side as if exhausted. I tell myself it will be good to leave it like this and then come back, because then I can clean, and it will feel like fixing a section of a week that otherwise got away with itself. I strip the bed and then change my mind and put the same sheets back on because I\u2019m too jittery to find the clean set in the airing cupboard. If I try to fold anything right now I will end up with a swan or a mess.\n\nAt noon I go back into town because they insisted on buying me a lunch send-off, which is silly, because I will be back. But you don\u2019t say no to people when they are insisting on showering you with those small kindnesses that keep a person upright. The air over the river is the kind that smells like iron. The sky is built like a poorly mixed paint. A man is busking outside the Market Hall, though he isn\u2019t playing anything I can hear. His guitar hangs like a spare rib. He makes a face at me. Not nasty. Just\u2014curious. Hard to explain. It is easy to think people are looking at you because you have been told you are about to be looked at, and then you get to London and you are one in a pile.\n\nWe eat ham and cheese toasties and a giant crumble that Shaz brought in a foil tray that is, I think, the lid of a large Christmas tin. Laura keeps trying to press money into my hand, as if I might somehow get to the M6 and suddenly find myself at a toll booth demanding exact cash or a song. At one point, someone\u2014Morris\u2014puts on my audition on his phone and sets it on the bar. The video is a square. I am a square in the square. There is a moment where I start the song and my eyes flick to the left and I remember, when I see it again, looking for my mum in the audience even though I knew she wasn\u2019t there, which is ridiculous and probably a clich\u00e9 and still true. I watch my own mouth open. I watch my hands hold the mic like a thing that makes a sound you could catch. People around me watch me watching me, which is bizarre. Laura wipes her eyes with her wrist as if pretending she is wiping flour.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t make me cry,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019ll make my mascara run and I\u2019m going to a thing tonight.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat thing?\u201d\n\n\u201cBingo,\u201d she says solemnly, and we both laugh.\n\nI leave with a hug from ten people and a bag of sandwiches that will sweat in their clingfilm because I will forget they are there and then remember them at the wrong time. I promise to text when I get to my mum\u2019s and then again when I set out in the morning and then again when I arrive. Shaz, whose rings flash like fish scales, presses something into my hand.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2014?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a little saint I carry when my daughter\u2019s got an exam,\u201d she says. \u201cLaugh if you must.\u201d\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d I say. I look down. It is a small laminated card with a picture of a man holding a ship that is much too big. The expression on his face suggests that he believes everything will be all right even though he is about to drop it. I put the card in my wallet next to the bus pass I no longer use and the receipt for a coat I decided I couldn\u2019t afford and then didn\u2019t take back anyway because it made me look like I had shoulders.\n\nOn the walk home, a marching band that is not there plays in some alley in my head. I keep time on my leg with my hand. I think of the stage. The lights as hot as the sun. The clipboard girls with their precise smiles, the man in the headset who will nod you into your fate one step at a time. I think of my father, listening perhaps, or flicking past. I think of the boy with the water and the crisps. I think of my mother, sitting on the edge of her sofa, telling the cat she is not to step on the telly because Jacob is in it.\n\nThe evening curls around me and I sit on my sofa and do nothing the way a cat does: purposefully. I put my phone on charge. The screen glows in the corner like a lighthouse for moths. I try to read but the words make a soft carpet and I can\u2019t find the thread. I watch a clip of a man in a suit jumping rope very fast and then a woman making a pork pie and then a toddler saying the word dinosaur with increasing frustration that no one is understanding the science of what he is trying to communicate. My chest feels like it does when I\u2019m a step away from a cold and my head feels echoes. It\u2019s fine, it\u2019s fine.\n\nJust before I sleep, the light from the street peels itself off the wall and makes a white mark near the ceiling that looks for a second like a long face looking down at me. I squint. The mark dissolves into two planes of car light. My heart settles. I put my hand out and imagine another hand taking it, because that is what bodies that have evolved to live in groups sometimes need to be told will happen, even if it is not happening right then.\n\nI dream that I am crossing the Bay Bridge with my mother and the water below us is made of glass and under it are people, lots of, lots of people like fallen stars, and each star is a face I could name if I had more time, and my mother says, breathe now, love, because we\u2019re going over, and I hold my breath and then I wake and the sun is at the right angle to put a stripe across my knee. I lie there for a minute and let everything line up.\n\nMorning. The air has a bite. My suitcase\u2014the one my cousin gave me when she moved to Spain and said, bring it back when I come home, and then she didn\u2019t\u2014sits by the door like a dog waiting to be taken for a walk it doesn\u2019t know whether it will enjoy. I go down the stairs and there\u2019s a new flyer pinned up on the board by the front door: lost cat, Lunt. Answers to Stacey. Reward. The photo is of a cat with an expression of deep suspicion. I touch the paper. It crinkles. There\u2019s a whiff of wheat from the bakery downstairs; I will miss this when I go. Someone says my name as I step into the street, and I turn, but the street is doing its own bright ordinary thing. A bus heaves itself around the corner. A kid kicks a can and it skitters, lively as a mouse.\n\nI have promised to go to Mum\u2019s before I go south, because that is what the calendar in my head says is proper. I load the suitcase into the back of the car. The car is blue and aspirational, which is to say I aspire for it to start each time. It is Laura\u2019s cousin\u2019s, on loan, the kind of car that has a cassette player and a smell of old apple cores. The seat warms quick from the sun on the driveway. I put my hand on the wheel and it is not a metaphor for controlling my destiny; it is a wheel. I drive out. The streets of Lancaster fold around me like hands. I take the left past the water, past the low brick buildings and the sudden fancy flats, past the corner where the cyclist broke his front teeth and still waved at me as if he was the apologizing party.\n\nAt my mother\u2019s, the pelargoniums are doing very well, actually. She has arranged them in pots of mismatched sizes all along the front step. She hears the car and opens the door as if she has been standing behind it, listening for the exact note of my engine. She stands there, and for a second she is so exactly my mother\u2014hair done with the brush that makes it a little too round, cardigan even though it\u2019s too warm, eyes that want to check three things at once\u2014that I feel something pull in my chest. As if all my breath has decided to be a kid again.\n\n\u201cThere he is,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s my star.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m your son,\u201d I say, \u201cwho sometimes sings.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t contradict your mother,\u201d she says, stepping aside. The hallway smells like polish and bacon. Rachel the cat stands in the doorway to the sitting room and looks like she is about to sue.\n\nMum fusses. She has a list of fusses. Tea first and then the sandwiches I made because you won\u2019t have time, and make sure you don\u2019t leave that sweatshirt because it\u2019s getting cooler in the evenings, and what time do you think you\u2019ll get there. I answer. I let the tea burn then cool then burn again. On the sideboard is a photo from the audition\u2014cropped off a screenshot, you can see the play icon at the bottom. My face has an expression like it is surprised its owner could have made that sound. Mum has put it in a frame that once held a picture of me with a cow at a school fair and hasn\u2019t got all of the cow out of the corners.\n\n\u201cDo you remember,\u201d I say, \u201cwhen I sang in the school assembly and Mr Carter said I shouldn't wail?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat man,\u201d says Mum, \u201chad the soul of a wet sock. I wish him all the contentment in the world and never to cross my path again.\u201d\n\nI laugh. It\u2019s a short laugh, like a cough, just because everything in me is so tied to this moment it cannot bear to be distracted. The cat jumps onto my lap as if she has something to tell me and then sits facing away with the air of someone who has decided you will do.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re pale,\u201d Mum says. \u201cEat a biscuit.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had three.\u201d\n\n\u201cEat another,\u201d she says. \u201cFor luck.\u201d\n\nShe gives me a plastic container of lentil soup. \u201cFor the hotel,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019ll be a kettle.\u201d I do not tell her that I do not know if the kettle is kosher for soup. I put it in my bag and the bag looks back at me as if to say, we will leak now, see how you like it. She gives me a scarf that is not mine. She puts a hand on my cheek, cold and small. Her palm is a map of the years she has done washing without a dishwasher.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be scared,\u201d she says. \u201cYou belong to you. Do it how you do it\u2014not how they think you do it. You always did that. As a baby you refused to be born on a Tuesday because you didn\u2019t like the rhyme. Wednesday\u2019s child is full of woe, my bum. You waited til Saturday. After the football.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot true,\u201d I say.\n\n\u201cYou can prove nothing,\u201d she says, and we both grin.\n\nI stand in the hallway with my coat half on and look at her, and I mean to say, when I come back, Sunday roast, and watch old films, and I don\u2019t. I say, \u201cI\u2019ll call when I get to the hotel,\u201d and she says okay and then adds, \u201cbe careful\u2014there\u2019s always idiots,\u201d and I say, \u201cI will,\u201d and then I am on the path going down past the pelargoniums that are, still, very well indeed.\n\nIn the car, for a second I sit with the engine off and my hands on my knees. The street is quiet. A woman across the road is trying to get her toddler into a pushchair and the toddler is doing that boneless thing that makes children suddenly weigh as much as regret. A gull makes a noise like a squeaky gate. I turn the key. The engine catches. The radio does that jumpy click and then sets itself to some station that plays the same four songs. I turn it off. The silence again. I say out loud, like a fool, \u201cHere we go then,\u201d and the car doesn\u2019t answer because cars don\u2019t. I pull out. At the end of the street, a boy on a bike cuts across me and I brake with more abruptness than I mean to, and the boy flips me a V, and his mouth is making the beginning of a laugh. We\u2019re all in our own shows.\n\nIt will be fine. It will be more than fine. It will be exactly what it will be. The motorway will be a long ribbon and my nerves will be a different kind of road and I will follow both and they will take me there. I breathe the way Laura told me\u2014four in, hold, four out, hold\u2014and the breath catches somewhere unclear and then unsticks, and I go.\n\nThere\u2019s a van with a weird sticker\u2014a picture of a baby in sunglasses next to a skull\u2014that hasses me halfway to the junction, and then there isn\u2019t. The sky is a soft white, with the suggestion of blue if you squint. The road hums. I think, absurdly, that I forgot to lock my flat, and then I remember I did, and then I think well, if you didn\u2019t, then perhaps some decent burglar will tidy it in exchange for your DVDs, and then I remember that no one has DVDs anymore. I touch the St Christopher medal where it sits heavy and wrong at my throat. The metal warms against my skin. A feeling sweeps up my arms, like I have scraped them on something and the sting is only an idea.\n\nI wish, suddenly, that I had asked Mum one more time to come. But then she would be anxious on the train, and would forget to bring her reading glasses, and would pretend she is not frightened when she is, and I would be split between two worries like butter on too much toast. Perhaps it is better this way. I can call her after. I can tell her it went well and it went as it did and she will say, I knew that, I told the cat.\n\nOutside Galgate, a smell swirls into the car from nowhere, or the fields\u2014burned sugar and hot tar and the clean wet hay smell you get sometimes even when you know it\u2019s not rained. I wind my window up and down and the air is the same either way. I laugh at myself because it is surely just the sugar factory, nowhere near here, something drifting. It\u2019s a nice smell. It reminds me of my first job at the ice cream parlor, the film that would slick your arms after a shift. The woman who ran it wore a badge that said THERESA and a pin that said IF YOU LIKE ME, LEAVE A TIP.\n\nAt the traffic lights just before the bridge, a man in a fluorescent jacket walks halfway across, looking into the road like it might tell him something. He looks up at me then\u2014or, this is what it feels like\u2014looks past me. His face goes very still, like someone has just slapped him without touching him. He lifts his hand half an inch and then lets it fall. The light goes green. I go.\n\nThis is how it starts and this is not the start. There were starts before. Me as a kid standing on the back of a chair in our living room singing along to a tape of U2 because my mother had a moment for Bono. Me at fourteen realizing that the choir could make smoke come out of your lungs like a train does. Me at seventeen, getting the job at The Blue Otter because I had a smile that made people order puddings they did not want. Me two winters ago, watching the telly glow with other people\u2019s luck, and saying out loud, daft, I could do that, then admitting the daft is sometimes the point.\n\nLondon is a direction. The car eats up the miles like crumbs. A playlist I\u2019ve listened to so often it\u2019s become a landscape. I tell myself not to over-sing on the way and then, at the services, go into the toilets and quietly hum, because you cannot keep a river behind a door. In the mirror above the sinks, my face looks washed out neon. A man two urinals down stares at my side as if I have said his name. I smile, automatic, and then stop because you don\u2019t smile in toilets. Outside, a woman argues on her phone about whether a spaniel should be allowed on the sofa and it\u2019s all I can do not to lean in and say, let the dog on the sofa, people are too precious. I drink water like it will teach my cells something.\n\nBack in the car, a lorry pulls in behind me, its engine making a sound like deep bees. The road opens. The sky darkens then lifts again. I think of the stage. I see it like a rectangle in my mind and I step into it and the audience is an inhale and I am a note before it is sung. My phone vibrates on the passenger seat with a text from Laura: You ok? And then another one, seconds later: Sorry, stupid question. You\u2019ve got this. And then a third: Send me a pic when you get to the toll of the city. I text back a picture of a sign for Stoke-on-Trent because I am a rat and she replies with thirteen crying-laughing faces and a skull and a hand clapping.\n\nSomewhere just south of Stafford, the car makes a noise like a shaken rainstick. It is soft, at first. Something incidental. The road hums, the playlist continues, a man sings about a lost thing he is pretending is a woman. The noise is there when I listen for it and not when I don\u2019t. Then, a minute later, the car coughs. My whole body goes into a hot-cold. I pat the dashboard. I am not that person, but I am. \u201cCome on,\u201d I say. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare.\u201d The car chugs. The acceleration slips like a bar of soap in your hand.\n\nI indicate. I pull onto the hard shoulder. The car dies as if it\u2019s doing me a favour. The world goes very quiet except for a truck that moves past slow and then fast. The wind buffets. The smell is hot plastic and a sweetness like fruit left too long in a bowl. I sit for a second with my hands still on the wheel. It feels like a joke made by a god who enjoys their work too much. That\u2019s unfair. Machines are not malice. They are themselves. The hazard lights tick-tick, a brave little metronome.\n\nI say, out loud, to the empty car, \u201cNo.\u201d\n\nI pull my phone in close, as if it will hear me better if I put my mouth near it. Signal is a polite ghost. One bar. Then none. Then one. I call Laura. It goes to voicemail because she is in bingo\u2019s embrace. I hang up. I call the number on the breakdown card that I put in my wallet because Morris told me to, and the number rings and rings and then a woman answers and asks me to tell her where I am as if she and I both exist in the same frame. I look at the blue signs at the side of the road and the numbers on them could be a code for a lock I will never open. I tell her what I can. She tells me to wait inside the car. I want to argue and say they say don\u2019t sit in the car, sit behind the barrier, that man on the advert always says you\u2019ll die if you sit in the car, but the words go tangled, and she says, \u201cAre you with anyone,\u201d and I say, \u201cNo,\u201d and she says, \u201cKeep your hazards on,\u201d and I say, \u201cOkay,\u201d and then we hang up.\n\nThe air outside the car when I open the door is bigger than air in the car. It shoves at me, or I have not eaten enough. I stand behind the barrier because that is what anyone who loves me would tell me to do. The grass is long. There is a plastic bag caught in it like a little flag of white. The noise of the road is a sizzle and a roar and I think, stupidly and with great clarity, that I have never felt more intensely that I am here. I am here. I am a thing that breathes. I text my mother\u2014Car trouble. Don\u2019t panic. Will sort then get on my way\u2014and I don\u2019t know if it sends. The bar comes and goes like a fish.\n\nCars pass. They are tin animals. I watch the people inside them not because I need to but because my eyes are magnets for faces. A child looks at me long and then opens his mouth wide as if trying to swallow a fly, and his mother swats his hand down without looking. A couple argue, their faces in profile making a hinge. A man taps his fingers on the wheel to a tune I cannot hear and makes a face that might be joy or might be indigestion. I stand and I feel my heart beating in my wrists. It beats in my teeth. It beats everywhere as if it cannot decide where to be.\n\nThe lorry that has been in the middle lane moves in. It becomes a wall. It passes. The wall leaves. The sky is the pale grey of a set of towels you washed with a black sock. The wind licks at the grass at my feet. I think of my song and the way the note in the bridge sits like a swallow on a line. I think of my mother and whether she is making a sandwich and if she will look out at the square of the garden and see the robin that thinks it owns the fence. I think of Laura and the way she will swear kindly when she gets my message. I think of the stage, like a promise written on a long piece of paper.\n\nI put my hand to my throat and my fingers touch the St Christopher. It is warm. It is warmer than the air. A car horn blares somewhere that is not where I am. The road makes its own gutsy music. A smell like hot pennies lifts, then passes. The breakdown truck will come. It is on its way. I am on my way. It will all be in time. There is a quiet at the centre of me where a note waits, calm as a stone in a river. I hold onto that and nothing else. I look at the cars and I cannot tell if, in their windows, they are looking at me or through me. It\u2019s only wind. It\u2019s only noise. It\u2019s only the world taking a deep breath. I take one too, and let it out slowly, very slowly, as if doing it right might teach the day how to behave.Chapter 3\n\nThe van that finally pulls in behind me has orange lights that blink in an unbothered rhythm, as if nothing urgent has ever happened and nothing ever will. The man who climbs out is tall and weathered, wearing a jacket with reflective strips that look like someone stuck puzzle pieces to him in a hurry. He moves with the efficient calm of people who spend their days rescuing bad luck and therefore cannot afford panic. He lifts a hand in a hello that is more of a hello to the whole situation than to me. When he speaks, his voice has the flattened music of the Midlands.\n\n\u201cAll right, mate?\u201d he says. \u201cYou done the right thing, standing back.\u201d He looks at the car like a farmer looks at a calf with a limp, not cruel, just resigned. \u201cShe cough on you?\u201d\n\n\u201cShuddered,\u201d I say. \u201cThen died like a Victorian heroine. It\u2019s a loaner. I did nothing to deserve her.\u201d\n\nHe smiles, quick and small. \u201cThey always say that,\u201d he says. \u201cName\u2019s Manu. Let\u2019s see what we can do.\u201d\n\nFrom the other side of the barrier, I watch him pop the bonnet and lean in. He is one of those people who becomes briefly intimate with whatever he touches, and I am weirdly comforted by the way his hands cradle the engine as if it might confid e in him if he gives it room. Traffic slides by in gusts. A crisp packet lifts and settles, lifts and settles. Manu peers, fiddles, taps. He speaks to the car in a voice both chastising and encouraging. The hazard lights tick-tick in their brave rhythm. I imagine them as the click of a metronome before a song I haven\u2019t practised enough, and my throat does its little pre-performance tighten and then release because there is no stage here and no audience, just a man and a machine and a morning that has veered slightly left of plan.\n\n\u201cFuel?\u201d he asks without looking up.\n\n\u201cEnough,\u201d I say. \u201cI topped up at Forton. The man at the counter tried to sell me a loyalty card. I told him I was committed to nothing.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d he says, and I get the sense he appreciates a customer who makes him laugh at least in theory. \u201cCoil pack,\u201d he says after another thirty seconds. \u201cMaybe. Could be the HT leads. Old ones go like liquorice. I can get you as far as the services and do a swap. Not a full fix, but it\u2019ll give you a run.\u201d\n\nRelief sweeps up so suddenly I feel slightly light-headed with it. \u201cI\u2019m meant to be in London by this evening,\u201d I say, and I hear how futile that sounds, as if London is a person I\u2019m standing up and needs a reason.\n\n\u201cAren\u2019t we all,\u201d he says gently. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. We\u2019ll get you moving.\u201d\n\nHe hitches the car, guides me into the cab. It smells of coffee and damp maps. There\u2019s a pink stuffed pig hanging from the rearview with a faded ribbon tied around its neck. He notices me noticing and says, \u201cMy daughter. Hates pigs, oddly. Leaves me this to remind me of that. Love\u2019s a funny old thing.\u201d\n\nWe rumble to the services, big lit letters promising burgers and clean toilets and a place to stretch a back that didn\u2019t used to ache. He finds a space near the far fence and slides out. The wind here is less of a slap and more of a constant bicker. In the minuscule lull between gusts, the sounds of other people trying to keep their lives on track fill in: laughter that isn\u2019t for you, a clatter of a tray on a table, the squeak of a trainer sole. Mammon, modern. Manu opens his boot and reveals an ordered array of tools and boxes I would not know what to do with even if someone pointed them at me and said, go on then. He moves with the ease of someone who has lifted the same lid a hundred times and still takes a second to like the way the hinges sound.\n\nWhile he works, I phone Laura, who this time picks up on the second ring like I\u2019ve interrupted her mid-shout.\n\n\u201cTell me you\u2019re not phoning to say you\u2019re turning back,\u201d she says, and then, before I can answer, \u201cTell me where you are and tell me your exact blood sugar.\u201d\n\n\u201cServices,\u201d I say. \u201cManu is being a saint with better tools. My blood sugar is fine and also composed of crisps. Don\u2019t tell Shaz.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re getting a pie,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd a bottle of water that costs eight quid and a woman in a fleece who calls you sweetheart without quite meaning it. And you are texting me a picture of your actual face in five minutes so I can assess whether your smile is lying.\u201d\n\n\u201cBossy,\u201d I say.\n\n\u201cEffective,\u201d she says. \u201cGo on.\u201d\n\nI hang up and think about my face and whether it is telling the truth. When I catch my reflection in the dark window of Manu\u2019s truck, it shows me a version of myself that looks like the one on telly but also like the boy who\u2019s tried to charm free puddings with a smile and has only learned the art in the places where it didn\u2019t work. My eyes look a shade lighter in this light. Perhaps that\u2019s hope. Perhaps it\u2019s the weird services neon.\n\nBy the time I\u2019ve bought a pie and water\u2014served by a woman in a fleece who does call me sweetheart with the complicated warmth of someone who has no more warmth to spare\u2014Manu has the coil pack in his hand. He shows it to me as if I might like to admire its wrongness. The rubber has gone soft in a way that makes my fingertips itch to not touch it.\n\n\u201cSee,\u201d he says. \u201cBit perished. Life, eh? Give me fifteen minutes and you\u2019ll be singing again.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not singing in the car,\u201d I say.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re lying to me,\u201d he says without malice.\n\nHe works, quick but not sloppy, and while he does, a child stops three paces from us and stares at me as if I am a good joke he has forgotten the punchline to. He\u2019s maybe seven, with hair cut square by someone who loves him enough to be brave. He tugs at his mother\u2019s sleeve. The mother looks, then looks harder, and a face I know too well blooms on hers\u2014the careful expression of someone trying to decide if they recognize a person they\u2019ve only ever seen contained in a glowing frame. The boy saves her the awkwardness.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re the telly man,\u201d he says, voice clear, generous. \u201cThe singing waiter.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am,\u201d I say, and watch how this pronoun nudges my day into a slightly different lane. \u201cI\u2019m off-duty at the minute. Letting him do the heavy lifting.\u201d\n\nThe boy nods, taking this as fair. \u201cMy dad says if you learn to sing proper you get free puddings.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour dad knows,\u201d I say solemnly. \u201cIt\u2019s a documented phenomenon.\u201d\n\nThe mother smiles, apologetic for her son\u2019s lack of boundaries without really being sorry. \u201cGood luck,\u201d she says. \u201cWe were shouting. My husband cried.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll deny it,\u201d I say.\n\n\u201cHe already does,\u201d she says. \u201cHe says it was hay fever. In March.\u201d\n\nWe grin at each other in that complicated way that strangers do when they\u2019ve shared nothing and somehow something. The boy waves like a windmill, then is whooshed away by the onwardness of their day, and for a second the services feels like a nice place to be marooned: humanity at its least curated, all these people unpeeling the sticky film from pastries as if that is the hardest thing they\u2019ve done all week.\n\nManu straightens and wipes his hands on a rag that looks like it was once a t-shirt someone loved. \u201cRight then,\u201d he says. \u201cTry her.\u201d\n\nShe catches. There is a relieved purr that sounds like a sigh being put into gear. Manu listens, head tilted. \u201cShe\u2019ll do,\u201d he says. \u201cTake it easy, don\u2019t thrash her, she\u2019s an old lady. Keep it at sixty-five and she won\u2019t sulk.\u201d\n\n\u201cBless you,\u201d I say, and I mean it enough that my voice goes a little weird around the blessing. \u201cWhat do I owe you?\u201d\n\nHe gives me a number that doesn\u2019t make me die and I give him a thanks that probably makes him uncomfortable, and he shrugs it off like a man used to people being a bit too grateful because otherwise they\u2019d be screaming. He taps the St Christopher at my throat with a knuckle, quick as a second hand. \u201cHe\u2019s got work to do today,\u201d he says, and I cannot tell if he\u2019s joking.\n\nBack on the motorway, every sound is suspect for a while. A rattle is a harbinger. A hum is a hymn. I pull into the left lane like it\u2019s my rightful home and the car, sainted for the moment, behaves itself as if flattered by the attention. I text Laura the requested photo of my face looking smug with a background of a sign that says Welcome Break as if I am advertising the concept. She replies with a string of thumbs and then a voice note of her singing an off-key fanfare that makes me laugh so hard my chest loosens. I text Mum a more measured update\u2014On my way\u2014 and she replies with five rocket emojis and a frying pan, which I choose to read as her trying to say go, and also eat.\n\nThe miles roll under me and London is not yet a city but a suggestion, an increase in lane numbers, a tone shift in the way the adverts shout. I hit the ring road. The traffic becomes more of a conversation and less of a queue. The skyline arranges itself like someone very carefully placing shiniest rocks at the edge of a pond. I feel that little sideways pull you get when you\u2019ve spent a long time in a place and are now entering the territory where you once only had pretend versions of yourself. It\u2019s not quite jealousy. It\u2019s not quite fear. It\u2019s a nudge that says: are you ready to be the person you have told stories about.\n\nThe hotel is a rectangle with opinions about glass. It is near enough to the studios that I could, if I had to, run and arrive sweating, which feels like a lifesaver and also a threat. In the lobby, everything is beige in a way that signals expense. A woman behind the desk wears a smile like good cutlery. She has the patient eyes of someone who has seen a lot of people arrive who think the hotel is an answer to a question that is nothing to do with beds.\n\n\u201cWelcome,\u201d she says, looking at her screen more than at me. \u201cName?\u201d\n\n\u201cJacob Hargreaves,\u201d I say, and she reads the list like it might spoil if she opens it too long. A small pause, then a nod.\n\n\u201cAh,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019re with the show. We\u2019ve got you on the fourth floor. Breakfast is until ten. There\u2019s a spa but it\u2019s being painted. Don\u2019t wear your badges past the bistro. Some guests get\u2026 overenthusiastic.\u201d\n\nShe hands me a key card with a smile that acknowledges the world on the other side of this door and does not engage with it. I take the lift up, my suitcase making a noise like a bored child over the carpet. In the room the air is conditioned to rich people\u2019s preferences. The window looks out over a slice of city that includes scaffolding and a church spire and a patch of trees that manage to look both valiant and a bit put-upon. I put the St Christopher on the bedside table and it looks too bright there, so I put it back on, because I am ridiculous. I make tea in a tiny kettle that would struggle to boil a thought. I pour Mum\u2019s lentil soup into the mug that says BEST DAD and it makes a dark honest smell that tugs at somewhere behind my ribs.\n\nThe email itinerary crinkles every time I touch it as if trying to warn me that my future time is not my own. Call sheet says: Thursday, sign-in at nine, wardrobe consult, vocal warm-up, band call, staging, tech, press. Don\u2019t be late, is written twice in different fonts, which is either professionalism or a cry for help. There is a map to a door marked Stage Door that will in real life be no such thing, but you have to call something something.\n\nSleep lurks. It lurks in the corner of the room like a friend you owe a drink to and are pretending not to see because you have too much to do. I shower instead and the water makes that small thin roar that hotel showers do, as if they are taking this personally. When I get out, a message from Gemma is sitting in my phone like a neat parcel: Hope the drive was manageable. See you bright and early. Let us know if you need anything. Evidence suggests this means let us know if you need to show up in two places at once and we\u2019ll tell you to pick one. I reply with a polite thank you and nothing else because I cannot ask it for anything that matters.\n\nNight in a new bed is a funny animal. It sniffs your edges and decides how to lie on you. I turn the pillow over and over as if there\u2019s a right way up. The window hums. Somewhere in the wall a pipe makes a click like a nervous throat. I close my eyes and instantly open them, because my head does that thing where it reminds me, cleverly, of every single thing that could go wrong. Forget the words. Drop your breath. Catch your breath and don\u2019t be able to let it out. The mic cut. The band speeding up while you slow down. Your mother missing the beginning because Freeview decides to update at the exact moment the show starts. I breathe and count and the numbers aren\u2019t big enough, and eventually I take Laura\u2019s text out again\u2014You\u2019ve got this, you idiot\u2014and hold it against my chest as if it can do the job of both a hot water bottle and a mantra.\n\nIn the morning, the city is different. The light makes dust honest. The air coming through the small gap in the window tastes like tyre and ambition. I put on a shirt and then another shirt and settle on the white one because it is honest even when it is lying. In the lift, a man with very white teeth and a small dog that looks like it could be digitally erased if needed says, \u201cBig day?\u201d as if he knows all days are big to someone. I make agreeable noises. The dog looks over my shoulder and then at my knees, interested in neither.\n\nOutside the studio, there is a bustle that is its own weather. People with headsets are communicating with invisible gods. A man carries an armful of fake flowers like he\u2019s bribing a meadow. A kid in an enormous hoodie is juggling because he can, because why not, because juggling is the sort of show-off skill that looks better in car parks. I stand for a second and watch the doors gulp people in, swallow them, and then belch out more people who look exactly the same but are different. I pin my pass to my shirt and it feels like putting on a name I have to earn.\n\n\u201cJake!\u201d calls a voice, bright as aluminium. It is Gemma, in black jeans and a black t-shirt that will never attract attention, by design. She has the glow of someone who, immediately before this moment, was in six other moments. \u201cYou made it. Good. Follow me, love.\u201d\n\nShe pours me through corridors the way you pour batter into a tin\u2014neat, efficient, confident someone else will handle the heat. We pass a wall of framed posters of shows that involve a lot of clapping. We pass a table with bowls of fruit that look too clean to be eaten by humans. We pass a man in a headset muttering, \u201cNo, I said the blue drape, I said the blue,\u201d and a woman in a floaty dress practicing looking surprised in a mirror, over and over, in a way that is either craft or prophecy.\n\nWardrobe is a room with too much mirror. The light makes a pleasant enemy of everyone. A woman with tape around her wrist like a bracelet and pins in her mouth smiles with her eyes. \u201cJacob,\u201d she says through the pins. \u201cRight. We\u2019ve got two options for you. Shirt you in or shirt you out. You\u2019re a shirt-in man, I think. We\u2019ll try both anyway. Arms up.\u201d\n\nArms up. The ritual. I do what I\u2019m told, and there is a comfort in it. The shirt they give me is nicer than my nicest. It has that weight that says it will sanction your behaviour. I stand still and let them tuck me into a version of myself that will read better in harsh light. They talk around me and over me and occasionally to me, and it is not unkind, it\u2019s just the way it is when the outfit is the thing and the body is the hanger. They ask me about jewellery and I say St Christopher and they say we can tuck that under, sweetheart, if it flashes we\u2019ll get letters. I nod and tuck. He warms against my skin, indignant.\n\nVocal warm-up happens in a room that once was a rehearsal studio and is now a room where people try not to be sick. The walls are a forgiving grey. There are bottles of lukewarm water lined up like a small army. The vocal coach is a woman with a perfect bun and the sort of gaze that could keep boats off rocks. She makes us do the exercises that make everyone sound ridiculous in a way that has a logic that\u2019s older than embarrassed. I lip trill enough to make my face hum. I do the sirens, I do the me-me-mes, I do the yawns that remind your throat it is a flexible creature, and the room softens around all of it like a hand around a fruit you do not want to bruise.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t oversing in rehearsal,\u201d she says, as if she\u2019s known me all my life. \u201cGuard the instrument. Give me seventy percent now, a hundred tomorrow. Stand tall. You drop your shoulder when you hit the swell. Let the breath sit low. All right?\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right,\u201d I say, and the words feel like a promise to someone else and to myself.\n\nBand call is a different animal. The MD is thin and intense, like the first line of a poem. He has a pencil behind his ear and a precision that makes you want to stand up straighter before you even make a sound. We run the first verse and he nods like a metronome. We hit the bridge and he lifts a hand like a conductor and says, \u201cThere, sit back. Let it float a bar longer. We\u2019re with you if you don\u2019t panic.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t panic,\u201d I say, and of course I do, and he knows, and we both pretend that\u2019s not true for the next ten minutes and then it sort of becomes true.\n\nOn a break, I end up leaning against a wall with a man who has a deck of cards in his hands like it\u2019s an animal he\u2019s tamed and could go wild at any second. He is perhaps twenty-two and has the kind of face that looks smooth at a distance and complicated up close. His fingers are indeed ridiculous. They eat cards and produce them and shuffle them into thin air and back. He glances at me with a little half-smirk that says he is used to people being impressed and has learned to act as if he is not.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re the guy from Lancaster,\u201d he says. \u201cThe waiter who isn\u2019t a waiter.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am a waiter,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019m many things. You\u2019re the Preston kid with fingers that are not following the rules.\u201d\n\nHe grins. \u201cKai,\u201d he says, and I tell him my name, and for a second we are two lads from not-London who are about to be made into content. He does a thing with three cards that makes no sense to me and then palms a coin behind my ear only to produce it again from the sleeve of my jacket, and I feel like a child, delighted and furious and wanting the trick and not the explanation.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in the same show,\u201d he says, twiddling. \u201cGood to have a northerner in the last half. We reduce the vowels.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe do,\u201d I say. \u201cWe also lower the temperature of the room by three degrees by standing in it.\u201d\n\n\u201cFair,\u201d he says. He glances past me, then at me, and for a moment that off feeling does a small dance at the back of my neck. The air flickers around the overhead lights. Kai frowns and shakes his head as if trying to get water out of his ear. \u201cIt\u2019s always like this in here,\u201d he mutters. \u201cLike the building remembers other shows and is trying to run them at the same time.\u201d\n\nStaging is a polite way of saying: here is the rectangle you will be allowed to be in; try not to do anything you do in your kitchen at 2 a.m. There are marks on the floor in tape of different colours, and my name written on one in a black felt pen that has bled a little. It occurs to me that this is the first time I have seen my name on a floor that wasn\u2019t to do with spillages. The stage manager, Del, is the man with the headset I imagined, with a voice like a safety briefing delivered by a friend. He calls, \u201cPlaces, please,\u201d in a tone that makes you want to impress him. He talks us through our bits like we are complicated machines he\u2019s been given five minutes to learn. When I step onto my mark, the lights lift just enough that I can see the negative space where an audience will be. It is always the strangest feeling: singing into the idea of people before the people are there. Like a promise, or a dare.\n\nWe run my entrance. We run the first verse. We run the bridge. The band swells and the room swells and then, just as I go to sit back into the space the MD gave me, the right-most light flickers, the sound in the monitor cuts, returns, and the tiniest shimmer of that corridor-from-a-dream feeling washes over me. It is gone before I can hold it. It leaves behind the ghost of the goosebumps I had about it. Del\u2019s voice is already on it, pragmatic, unruffled.\n\n\u201cLight four just threw a strop,\u201d he says into his mic. \u201cIt\u2019s all right, keep going, keep it moving, love. We\u2019ll fix that. Electricians, you\u2019re on it.\u201d\n\nWe keep going. We always keep going. The swallow of the note sits on the line where it should. I trust that the floor will continue to be floor beneath me. The MD nods once. It is ridiculous how much a single nod can make you feel like you belong in your own body.\n\nPress is the bit I dread and it turns out to be like being fed biscuits by three aunts who all say they only want a nibble. A kind girl with a tablet asks me questions that are variations of how does it feel and what would you say to your younger self and who would you like to collaborate with, and I answer them in sentences that are honest and a little rehearsed. I think of my mother, tuning in to a clip later perhaps, hearing my voice doing its best to not make a fool of us both, and I smile in a way that is not completely put on. At the end, the girl says, \u201cMy nan loves you,\u201d and I don\u2019t know what to say that isn\u2019t weird, so I say, \u201cYour nan has excellent taste,\u201d and hope her nan has a sense of humour.\n\nAt lunch\u2014which is rice in a compostable box and chicken that has been made decent by a sauce that tastes like someone thought about it\u2014Kai sits across from me and shows me the edge of a trick. He explains the falseness of one move in a way that makes me ache in a place that words don\u2019t help. He says, \u201cYou know, it\u2019s all angles. You don\u2019t hide it, not really. You just show something else with your shoulders while your hands tell a lie. People want to believe the story they\u2019ve already chosen.\u201d\n\n\u201cI sing a note like it\u2019s harder than it is,\u201d I say. \u201cIt\u2019s not the same, but it is.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is the same,\u201d he says, and then he licks sauce off his thumb in a way that is so childlike it makes me want to remind us both to stay. His phone buzzes and he looks at it as if it has said his name in an accusatory tone. \u201cMum,\u201d he says fondly, then grimaces. \u201cShe wants me to wear a different jacket. She thinks the one I brought makes me look like a small-time gangster.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat does the other one make you look like?\u201d\n\n\u201cA bigger time gangster,\u201d he says, and we both laugh and somehow in that moment I feel less alone.\n\nThe afternoon is long in the way afternoons are when they are full of things you love that also make you want to throw up. We run it again. We tweak a word. The MD moves a bar line. A woman with nails like tiny shields writes my name on a clipboard three times. I am fed three more bottles of water than a person deserves and pee so often I begin to suspect it\u2019s a hobby. Every now and then, that thin ripple in the air slides around the edges of my vision and I blink and it\u2019s gone. Once, near the end of the day, I\u2019m walking past a door marked NO ENTRY and it opens an inch with a sigh on no hinge. I see into a darkness that is full of the shapes of chairs. It looks, for a second, like a row of people have stood to leave and left their shadows sitting. I close it with my foot because I do not have the energy for metaphor.\n\nBack at the hotel, the hallway carpet smells like new glue and something enveloping. My room is exactly as I left it and, for an embarrassing second, that makes me emotional. It is a relief when nothing moves when you\u2019ve been pulled through a day like beads on someone else\u2019s string. I sit on the edge of the bed and put my head in my hands not because anything is wrong but because it is heavy. After a minute, my phone makes the small polite noise that means text and I look.\n\nFrom Mum: I have moved the blue vase onto the other table and it looks wrong but right. Your Auntie Lila says if you go on last she will be in bed. We love you. Eat your soup.\n\nI send her a picture of the soup halfway eaten, steam still lifting, the mug ridiculous and perfect. I call her and she answers on the second ring, a small triumph in a day of bigger ones. She tells me the quiz on the radio was about flags and she knew more than she thought. I tell her about the MD\u2019s pencil. She tells me Rachel the cat knocked over the tv remote and turned the sound up to thirty and sat there like a queen. I tell her the lights misbehaved and she says, \u201cSometimes they do that. Tell them to stop it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be all right,\u201d she adds, voice sudden in its quiet sincerity. \u201cYou\u2019re good at being you in a room. They can\u2019t stop you doing that.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks,\u201d I say. \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 that\u2019s the best job description I\u2019ve ever had.\u201d\n\nI call Laura and she is on a bus, her voice chest-high, laughing because a man has just tripped over nothing and then gotten so offended at the nothing he swore at it. \u201cI knew you\u2019d make it through a day of being handled,\u201d she says. \u201cYou were always good with a busy Christmas. Now, when they make you sing it half a tone lower because telly panics, you tell them to do one.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey only tried a quarter tone,\u201d I say. \u201cI fought it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere he is,\u201d she says. \u201cOur tiny rebel. Get some sleep. Dream of good things. Dream of us all at The Otter watching you and pretending not to cry, because if Shaz starts she\u2019ll never stop.\u201d\n\nWe say good night and I stand for a bit at the window. The city is lit like a diagram. In a narrow office opposite, a woman sits at a desk with her head on her arms and the light on. For a long minute, she doesn\u2019t move, and I watch her as if we\u2019ve agreed this is a fair exchange. When she finally lifts her head, she rubs her eyes, switches the light off, and the rectangle goes dark. The church spire is a point against a low cloud. Somewhere, a siren wails and then decides against it. I go to bed. I do not tell my heart it\u2019s allowed to be excited, but I stop telling it to behave.\n\nI wake at three with the feeling that someone has said my name. It sits in the air like breath you can see. The street lights make two parallel lines on the ceiling and for a second, in their shape, I see a face, a long one, looking down, as if the light itself is curious. I think of that dog on the quay and the boy in the car and the woman crossing the road who looked past me like I was a gap. I put my palm flat on my chest. My heart answers back: present. I don\u2019t sleep for a while. I have a small conversation with myself about how ridiculous I am being. Eventually the conversation becomes a dream where I am walking down a corridor with many doors and each one has a different version of my name written on it and none of them are Jake. When I wake, the white stripe on my knee is back and the morning makes everything believably ordinary again.\n\nCall time. Coffee I don\u2019t need and toast I misjudge. The hotel lifts are full of people who smell faintly of hairspray and determination. I check my bag seventeen times and then a twentieth. On my way out, the woman at the desk gives me a nod that says: I don\u2019t know you, but tonight I will say that I did. Outside, the air is sharp with a number I associate with early maths. The studios swallow me with the practised ease of a whale. Inside there is a buzz that has edges. People are speaking faster than yesterday. The man in the headset is holding two clipboards and the same amount of professionalism. Gemma appears, a small whirlwind. She puts a hand on my shoulder and squeezes in a way that feels like permission.\n\n\u201cMorning,\u201d she says. \u201cYou look well. How\u2019s the car?\u201d\n\n\u201cAlive,\u201d I say. \u201cI owe a man my life and a coil pack.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe all owe a man our life and a coil pack,\u201d she says, and for a second she isn\u2019t a person whose job is to hold a day together but just a person, and I like her more.\n\nThey move us like chess pieces. The run is tighter today, the pauses filled with warmth that is not warmth but can be used as such. Photographers bloom out of corners like mushrooms after rain. I answer a question I\u2019ve answered eight times with a slightly different cadence. A woman with a spray bottle mists me with something that smells like cucumber and triumph. I find Del and he winks at me in a way that is dad and mate and sea captain. He points at my chest, where the St Christopher sits under the shirt like a small impatience.\n\n\u201cKeep it tucked,\u201d he says. \u201cNot because I\u2019m worried about letters. Because if you ever lose it, you\u2019ll blame me, and I cannot carry that kind of narrative.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would never blame you,\u201d I say, and then make a face to indicate this is a lie. He cackles respectfully.\n\nBackstage in the wings there is a feeling like standing on a cliff edge you have chosen. The audience is a dark body made of individual lights. A man is telling jokes into a microphone in the sort of voice that makes jokes behave. A stagehand in black nods to me once, very seriously, the way you nod to someone you are handing a parachute to. Kai passes by, touches my elbow, does not break his own concentration bubble. I watch him disappear and then reappear in a square of light like a fish crossing a patch of sun in a pond. He flourishes. The roar tells me the room is willing.\n\nFive minutes. Two. One. This is the part where fear and love hold hands. I tie my shoelace for no reason. I make the knot the way my mother taught me and whisper, let them see you, let them see you, let them see you, and the third one turns into, let me see me. Del is at my shoulder with the half-second nod that means go, and the air changes temperature as I step forward. The light picks me up and the room does the thing rooms do where they become one eye. I take my breath and I let it out, and the first note sits where it should, not because I force it there but because it wants to. The world narrows and expands at once. The band is a living thing behind me. The words that have been living in my mouth all these years come out and do their neat little dances.\n\nIn the bridge, the one the MD told me to float, I feel that shimmer again\u2014a flicker at the edge of the light, a cool on the back of my neck, like a corridor opening for a second and then closing. I hold on to the note not tighter but truer. I let it pass through and it does, like a weather front, and then is gone. The light settles. The sound is sound again and not just electricity pretending to be it. I think of the river back home and the way the sun sits in its buckle and how everything is a reflection and a real thing at once. The last note blooms. The room stands up. They stand up.\n\nAfter, in the few seconds where you are still inside the rectangle but the rectangle has stopped being a secret, I taste salt in my mouth and do not know if it\u2019s sweat or the way joy has a taste when it\u2019s honest. The applause is a storm and I am somehow both inside it and not. I see, in the second row, a woman who looks almost like my mother\u2014but is not, of course not\u2014and she has her hand over her mouth like people do in old films when the train pulls in. Somewhere in the noise, I can hear one person\u2019s laugh that sounds like Laura\u2019s and I know she\u2019s not here, she\u2019s at The Otter, shouting and pretending not to, and the thought lands so squarely I almost tilt. I bow in the way they told me, not too low, not too long, respectful of everyone including myself.\n\nOffstage, Gemma grabs my arm and says some words that my ears will only catch in ten minutes. Del squeezes my shoulder in a way that registers as the thing my dad might have done in a universe where he knew how. Kai yelps something delighted as he is being interviewed and sends a thumbs up with his eyes at me. A runner presses a bottle of water into my hand and I drink and it tastes like water always has when it is doing its job.\n\nBack in the corridor, where the carpet is pretending to be a grander carpet, I find a corner of wall and lean on it. I breathe the four in, four hold, four out, four hold with the fierce devotion of the newly religious. My phone is waiting in the little tray with my name on it like a pet that wants your attention the very second you\u2019re home. There is a message from Mum that simply says, Oh my heart, and another that says, the cat walked in front of the telly during the last bit and I told her you were busy, and a final one that says, are you having a biscuit and if not why not. There is a photo from Laura of the pub, full, the cardboard star on the espresso machine tilted, Shaz with hands over her face, Morris looking like a man pretending he isn\u2019t wiping his eye with his wrist. My name is written in lipstick on someone\u2019s arm.\n\nI stand there and the building hums around me and I think, absurdly and correctly, that this is one of those little shelves in a life you stand and look at for a second and then carry on. I tuck the St Christopher back under my shirt because he has climbed out on his own. I wipe my face with my sleeve. I try to think of what comes next and that is the strange part: you cannot. It comes next anyway.\n\nAnd then, just as I\u2019m about to go back to the dressing room and let other people worry about whether the shirt creased, a man I don\u2019t know, wearing a lanyard that gives him permission to be everywhere, walks past, stops, frowns at the air to the left of me in a way I recognize now, that peculiar double-take as if someone has just said his name from a cupboard. He blinks, shakes himself, and carries on. The fluorescent light above us does a small discreet quiver. In the far-off, a kettle clicks. I am very present. I am the opposite of a ghost. I am a note that has found the room it was waiting for. I stand up straight. I go.Chapter 6\n\nThe river is itself again, which is to say it looks like someone has pulled a thumb along slate and left it shining. There\u2019s a breeze fat with damp and iron, the sort that wets your lips without asking. I stand on the quay and hold a paper cup of coffee that is too hot at the rim and too tepid at the middle and feel the post-city hum loosen in me. London hangs in your ears for a bit after you leave it. It makes small beeps in your head for a lift that isn\u2019t there, it gives you phantom footsteps, it makes you stand a little wider as if you\u2019re expecting to be jostled. Here, gulls heckle and a bus misjudges its own tiredness and huffs past and an old man in a cap I\u2019ve seen on him since I was twelve lifts two fingers in greeting and then forgets he\u2019s done it and does it again. Home sits down right beside you without asking who you think you are.\n\nI have been away and I have not. I have gone and sung under a light that could have cooked a small casserole and I have returned with my own face, which seems unfairly the same. The show threw me like a stone and the splash was big and then the ripples kept going and then, weirdly, there was still me and a kitchen and a bin that needed taking out. I am both sick to death and starving for the subject of what happened, because telling and not telling are the two appetites we keep feeding and neither is ever full. People stop me and do that face\u2014radiant and cautious\u2014with questions that begin with \u201cso\u2026\u201d and I answer them with the measured joy of a person very aware that his life could at any moment slip on a wet aisle and land on its arse.\n\nThe Blue Otter put out a chalkboard that says WELCOME HOME, JAKE in a hand that looks like Shaz told a child to go wild and then tidied it after. There are balloons that should not be balloons at all\u2014one is a football that has been repurposed with a Sharpie and love\u2014and someone has taped a paper star to the hand dryer in the gents that says PLEASE DO NOT SING INTO THIS. Inside, the lights do their fuggy afternoon thing where everything has a peel of gold on it even though outside is grey. The regulars move their bodies out of my way like the river shifts round boats. Shaz pretends I don\u2019t exist for a whole minute, lining up pint glasses like soldiers on inspection, and then she looks up and says, \u201cAll right, you\u2019ve had your fun,\u201d and the hug she gives me is full-armed and perfumed and her bangles knock against my back like little cymbals.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been on television,\u201d says Morris, as if I might not have noticed. \u201cI watched you on me phone after my niece texted me four crying faces and a fish.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou watch everything on your phone,\u201d I say. He grips my shoulders in his big hands and examines me like I might have cracked in transit. He has a tea towel over his shoulder that says KISS THE COOK and he looks like he could bite a cloud and get nutrients.\n\nLaura comes at me sideways, because she\u2019s on a tray run, and breasts me like a friendly sheep and says, \u201cTry to be normal,\u201d into my ear with such ferocity that it makes me laugh, which is what she was aiming for. She looks tired in a way that makes her eyes brighter. There are small glitter dots at her hairline, unexplained. She winks, which means there\u2019s a story and I\u2019m going to have to pry it out with a butter knife later.\n\nBy the coffee machine, someone has propped up a photo that is the unflattering freeze-frame of my mouth mid-bridge. Underneath, in a pen that is trying to be brave against the laminated sign about allergens, someone has written: WE KNEW HIM WHEN HE COULDN\u2019T REACH THE TOP SHELF. Customers do the exaggerated glances that constitute respect for a person who is picking up cutlery while being a small bit famous. I carry a stack of plates to table seven and the woman in the cardigan with the soft bob\u2014she gave me the St Christopher\u2014touches her own throat reflexively when she sees me and says, \u201cWe screamed until the cat left the room,\u201d and I say, \u201cI\u2019m sorry for your cat,\u201d and she says, \u201cHe\u2019ll return to us in time,\u201d and we share that little piece of church where we decide things will work out because we have agreed they will.\n\nNews finds you even if you pretend you\u2019re a hedgehog. There are emails that say words like opportunity and synergy and a phone that rings with numbers that start with 020 and smile at you in an expensive way. A man called Conrad leaves a message with a voice so smooth it could butter bread, offering management services and a belief in me that sounds portable. A woman from a morning show wants me to come and look pleasantly surprised on a sofa. There\u2019s a message from Gemma about the possibility of a charity gala, black tie if I have it and they can lend if I don\u2019t. I thumb each thing and feel the reality of it the way you feel the weight of coins through your pocket lining. The temptation to just say yes to everything because it is the proof that something happened is loud. The part of me that ties knots and says let them see you says, keep a shape, love, don\u2019t thin yourself to water.\n\nWhat keeps belling inside all this is the small off-notes, like a dangling fork in a drawer you can\u2019t quite push closed. It isn\u2019t only lights. It isn\u2019t only that corridor feeling that sits on the corner of my eye and then behaves. People still do that tiny double-take that looks like a draft. The dog outside the chemist this morning tilted its head and whined at a point exactly to the left of me and then wagged its tail as if put at ease by some silent assurance. A woman I know only by the set of her shoulders passed me at the market and whispered \u201cthere you are\u201d with relief, but her gaze was pointed at my pocket. When I caught her eye to return the courtesy, she startled, apologised to nothing, and hurried on. It would be easy to pack this all up into the box labelled You Are Overtired and slap the lid on, and perhaps that is what I\u2019m doing when I choose not to tell anyone because curiosity is sometimes just wanting your weird to be shared.\n\nIt\u2019s early evening at The Otter when my phone goes with the kind of ring I have mentally shelved as family. The screen shows Dad, which is a ridiculous name for the contact because the contact is a number, not a person, and yet there it is: DAD. Laura\u2019s eyebrows climb into her fringe when she clocks the name. I take the call outside, because there is a dignity to be had in having a conversation under a sky rather than under a sign that says PLEASE ASK AT THE BAR FOR KETCHUP.\n\n\u201cHello,\u201d I say, and I sound like a person calling a doctor.\n\nThere\u2019s a breath, a small cough, a masculine clearing that isn\u2019t unkind so much as habitual. \u201cJacob,\u201d he says, and the sound of his voice empties a drawer I didn\u2019t know I\u2019d crammed full. \u201cAll right, lad?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m all right,\u201d I say. \u201cAre you\u2014?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not dead,\u201d he says, which is the sort of joke a man makes when he means to be tender and can\u2019t find the shoelace end. There\u2019s a dog bark, big-chested, and a woman\u2019s voice in the background saying, \u201cSoup, leave it,\u201d which is such a dumb name for an animal it makes my eyes prickle because it is ours. \u201cWe saw you,\u201d he says. \u201cOn the telly.\u201d\n\n\u201cEveryone did,\u201d I say, and I hear the sulk in it and fold it away quick. \u201cI mean\u2014thank you.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou were good,\u201d he says, blunt as a spade hitting the ground. \u201cYou looked like you knew what you were about. Mandy cried. I\u2014didn\u2019t. Got a bit of\u2026 hay fever.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn March,\u201d I say. I can feel the grin even as I hear the ache behind it.\n\n\u201cAye,\u201d he says. \u201cWeather\u2019s mad. Your mother\u2019ll be made up.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe was proud,\u201d I say, and, because the door\u2019s ajar, because sometimes you can be brave for four seconds, I add, \u201cShe\u2019d like it if you phoned her.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a little quiet. I can hear the sort of quiet that contains furniture. He clears his throat again. \u201cWe don\u2019t\u2014\u201d he begins, and leaves it. \u201cI\u2019ll send you something,\u201d he says instead, which is his language for love, for sorry, for the afternoon he forgot to pick me up from football and turned his phone off for five hours and then looked like a broken candlestick when he arrived. \u201cFor shoes or whatever it is you lot wear in London.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got shoes,\u201d I say. \u201cI could do with a decent microphone. For maybe\u2026 later. If I do this properly.\u201d\n\nHe makes a noise that could be approval or could be a door squeak. \u201cRight,\u201d he says. \u201cDo it properly. Don\u2019t let \u2018em make you daft. If they tell you to fall over, stand up.\u201d Soup barks again, a nonsense comment. \u201cI\u2019ll, ah, I\u2019ll not keep you. You\u2019re popular.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot here,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019m mostly in charge of cutlery.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s honest work,\u201d he says. There is a shuffle like he is going to hang up and then he doesn\u2019t. \u201cJacob,\u201d he says, and I can hear him chewing something that isn\u2019t food. \u201cProud.\u201d\n\nIt lands. It doesn\u2019t capsize me. It does a rearranging at the level of bone. \u201cThanks,\u201d I say, and there are a hundred small Mean things I could do with the word and I don\u2019t. We say goodbye with the awkwardness of two people exiting a corridor in opposite directions at the same time. When I go back in, the smell of salt and vinegar hits me like a century, and Laura looks at my face and then offers me a cigarette without comment, which I don\u2019t take, which is a small victory, which she celebrates by lighting it herself and swearing at the extractor fan.\n\nMum, bless her, is busy making the national conversation into a local one. She has been to the post office and has told Margaret behind the counter that she has never been prouder of a parcel. She has phoned Radio Lancashire again and a man named Craig has given her five minutes to talk about the merits of lentil soup in a world gone strange. When I call her and say, \u201cHe phoned,\u201d she says, \u201cWho,\u201d and then immediately, \u201cOh,\u201d and then, after a second that sounds like a kettle beginning, \u201cGood,\u201d in a tone that is mainly relief patted flat by decades. We talk about the pelargoniums and about whether she should risk Bakewell when the pastry makes her teeth feel like an idea, and she says, \u201cCome Sunday,\u201d and I say, \u201cOf course,\u201d and the universe nods because it likes scheduled love.\n\nThe email that I cannot ignore arrives while I am carrying a tray of four gins and a plate of olives that are pretending to be generous and are not. It\u2019s from the production office of a touring company of a musical that my mother would describe as the one with all the people in coats. They are offering me an audition for a featured role and for the ensemble, and the dates look like a dot-to-dot of cities I have only ever visited for two hours on a bus with a broken air-con. There is rehearsal in London and then two months in places where my accent gets warmer. There\u2019s money that would mean my rent does not have to be a question. There is, hiding under all that, the fact of leaving, which is not a single thing but a flake of everything.\n\nI print the email because my hands understand paper better than they understand screens. The printer in the corner wheezes like a pensioner getting out of a warm bath and spits out the sheet with a curl. I read it standing in the kitchen by the little freezer where someone has put a joke magnet that says I ONLY DRINK PROSECCO ON DAYS THAT END IN Y and taped over it WITH: NOT THIS ONE. Morris clocks the top line as he flips a haddock.\n\n\u201cGo on then,\u201d he says without looking round. \u201cWhat\u2019s the big ask. What do they want you to wear. Don\u2019t wear leather. You\u2019ll sweat like a saint.\u201d\n\nI tell him in a paragraph that ends up longer than I mean. He turns, tongs in hand, and squints at me as if reading tiny writing on my forehead. \u201cYou want it?\u201d he says, simple as a knife.\n\n\u201cI want to want it,\u201d I say, and that\u2019s the truth before I have time to tidy it.\n\n\u201cThen that\u2019s wanting it,\u201d he says, and he drops chips into oil like a blessing.\n\nThere are practicalities that are actually feelings knocking on with clipboards. I tell Laura and she says, \u201cGo,\u201d so fast it\u2019s like she has been waiting to say it since we met. She goes bright-eyed and then bored-eyed in a breath. \u201cWe\u2019ll cope,\u201d she adds, which stings because it\u2019s true and because it\u2019s very them to make my leaving not a drama to throw at me like a net. Shaz, who does melodrama with the same skill she does receipts, says she will print me and put me on the wall and make customers throw beer mats at my cardboard face to win a free shot. I tell Mum and she says, \u201cWe\u2019ll work it,\u201d without a comma, as if the words are a single long plank we can walk across and not fall off.\n\nThe shimmer works itself into the corners of this new possibility like a draft. It\u2019s subtle. It\u2019s in how the street near my flat seems a shade narrower for a second and then remembers its width. It\u2019s in the way the light in my kitchen slides across the tiles and then catches on a bit of air where nothing is. It\u2019s in the pause before the shop door opens when the bell does a tring without the handle moving and then does it again to overcompensate. I start paying attention to it and I tell myself I shouldn\u2019t because attention feeds it, then I tell myself that ignoring things is how they trip you. On Thursday, taking my washing down at the launderette because my machine has decided to be performative such as: today, no, I watch a little girl point at a patch of empty floor with a grin like she\u2019s spotted a rabbit. She keeps looking, then frowns, then tears up without any drama. Her mother lifts her, bounces her, says, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing there, poppet,\u201d and the girl stops bright-crying and does the kind of sob that sounds like a miniature scratch on glass. When they leave, the air where she pointed feels colder, and then it doesn\u2019t.\n\nI go to the Priory the next afternoon because it has the sort of quiet that is not an absence but a presence that has decided to lower its voice. The castle squats an undangerous black and the path to the church is full of small choices you don\u2019t have to remember afterwards. I sit on the stone wall and look at the gravestones and their sturdy names and think about permanence and about the theatre of it, because we do not inscribe our deaths to remind the dead. The wind comes up the hill with a silly insistence that makes my hair do a thing it thinks is flirtatious. A tour group shuffles past me and the guide says dates whose syllables have been rounded by use. I hum, because it is the thing I do that makes me feel like I might be a tuning fork for my own life.\n\nIn the church porch, there is a notice pinned up about bellringers wanted. It has a phone number that has been corrected twice in biro. Inside, the air is predictably cool and smells like stone and beeswax and sensible patience. A woman at the back is arranging flowers with the ferocity of someone determined to make softness behave. I light a candle for my own daft reasons and when the flame catches, there\u2019s that tickle in the skin between my shoulder blades and I think, not here, not this, and then let the thought be small. As I turn to go, a man in a very tidy raincoat steps into the nave and stops. He looks around with the eyes of someone who has come to see something specific and has found a lot of things that are not that thing. He frowns into the air to my right. He lifts his hand a little, as if hailing a taxi that none of us can see. He drops it again, embarrassed by a thought that didn\u2019t work. He meets my gaze and smiles the British apology for occupying volume. He says, \u201cSorry,\u201d to nothing, and shuffles away.\n\nI tell Laura about the email and the Priory and the man and I dress it all like a joke because telling it any other way makes me feel like one of those men who smell vaguely of old smoke and tell you about a cold spot in their kitchen. We are on her sofa in a living room that has three misbehaving plants and a poster of a film with a kiss that is better than the film. She listens with her ankles crossed and a pen in her hair that she forgot was there. She doesn\u2019t laugh. She doesn\u2019t not laugh. She pours me wine into a mug because she has never owned a wine glass that survived August.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re tired,\u201d she says, which is both true and useful and boring.\n\n\u201cI am,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019m also\u2026 I don\u2019t know. Like someone remembered me twice.\u201d\n\nShe bites the side of her lip the way she does when she\u2019s about to call me an idiot in the kindest way. \u201cYou are very rememberable,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople are probably rearranging where to put you in their head and throwing their house off. The Priory has drafts because it\u2019s older than your granddad\u2019s socks. As for the job\u2014say yes, and then we\u2019ll learn the next bit later. You can\u2019t keep returning to the same sentence and expecting a different ending.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an ensemble,\u201d I say, because I have learned, apparently, to give myself the slight wound I need someone to kiss better.\n\n\u201cAnd?\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019ll be part of a whole that works because of parts. It\u2019ll make you strong in your corners. You can be a solo later. Or never. I like you in harmony. Also, selfishly, I would like to come and see you in a coat in Sheffield.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not convinced there are coats in Sheffield,\u201d I say.\n\n\u201cThere are only coats in Sheffield,\u201d she says. \u201cThey issue you one at the station.\u201d\n\nWhen I get back to my flat, the hallway smells like someone has tried to cover a smell with toast. There\u2019s a new flyer on the corkboard for a yoga class that uses chairs and forgiveness. The BEST DAD mug is on the draining board where I left it to air after soup. The St Christopher sits against my chest and is a little warmer than he has any right to be. I take the medal off and put it on the windowsill and it looks immediately like a small lost coin. I stand for a minute, looking at it, and then the light from a passing car lifts across the room and puts a long face on the ceiling and the face is not a face and I say out loud, \u201cEnough,\u201d and laugh at myself and the room, which is to say I make the air agree that this is daft.\n\nIt is late when the call comes and it is very reasonable. It is the production manager from the tour, and her voice is a friendly spreadsheet. She thanks me for my interest which is a funny sentence to be on the end of when you\u2019ve done nothing yet but breathe. She asks if I can be in London for a workshop next Thursday and says it will be gentle and there will be biscuits and no one will shout unless the fire alarm does. I say yes. I say yes like a person who knows he\u2019s relied on other people\u2019s yeses for too long to be shy now. When I hang up, I put my hands on the back of the sofa and look at the clock and for a second the numbers move in a way that makes my stomach do the small lift in the lift. It\u2019s a trick of the eyes. The clock stops behaving. The room sits down around me again.\n\nI go to Mum\u2019s on Sunday with a bag that is heavier than it needs to be because I have put in bread that she already owns and fruit she will not eat until it is soup. The pelargoniums are triumphant, and Rachel the cat slinks along the top of the sofa like a lady avoiding puddles. Mum has put up a picture of me in the kitchen where the calendar used to go and has taped the calendar over the boiler instead. The rocket that she drew for the audition day is now next to a note that says CHECK GAS MAN and a smiley face that looks a little like a man who has just lost his hat. She has made a crumble and the custard is the right thickness and we eat it with the sort of seriousness that should be reserved for treaties.\n\nI tell her about the offer. She lifts an eyebrow and then both eyebrows and then one again, a choreography that could be a language if codified. \u201cYou\u2019ll go,\u201d she says, not question and not permission. \u201cYou\u2019ll look after your throat and your feet and you\u2019ll come back on Sundays and you\u2019ll tell me if you need me to send up ham.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you if I need ham,\u201d I say. \u201cAnd soup. And your opinion on coats.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t wear leather,\u201d she says, and I laugh because Morris did that one already and it is unfair that the universe shares notes about me behind my back.\n\nThe shimmer tries it on in her house, because why should it not. It stands in the corner for a second like someone waiting to be told where to put a chair. Mum catches me not looking at it and goes, \u201cWhat,\u201d in the way that says she has noticed me noticing something I have decided to carry alone. I tell myself to say nothing and then I say something because she put me together and she has a right to be consulted when parts go odd.\n\n\u201cDo you ever feel the air\u2019s off,\u201d I say, very breezy, very I\u2019m-not-daft.\n\nShe doesn\u2019t go mystical and she doesn\u2019t go mocking. She puts her fork down and considers. \u201cSometimes,\u201d she says. \u201cYou mean like the house has moved but you haven\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d I say, and the relief is a silly kind\u2014like someone else admitting they go to the toilet after their bath.\n\n\u201cAge,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd lack of salt. And ghosts. Take your pick.\u201d She reaches and squeezes my wrist as if sounding it. \u201cDon\u2019t build it a room. Only guests that pay rent get a room. Make it stand outside if it gives you cheek.\u201d\n\nWhen I leave, she presses the St Christopher in my hand, because I\u2019d left him on her shelf without thinking and she has been dusting him like a small errand. \u201cKeep him,\u201d she says. \u201cHe\u2019s working overtime.\u201d I tuck him back on. The metal sits on my skin and a thought I will not dignify with words crosses my mind and then goes away because it has no manners.\n\nThe workshop in London is a plain room with a piano and a lot of people pretending this is normal. It\u2019s me and six others who all look like they are better at yoga than I am and a director who has the air of a kind headteacher. There\u2019s an ensemble number where we have to move like we are one person with a lot of limbs and an intimacy exercise that makes me nearly laugh because no one has ever made me lean backwards into a colleague on purpose before. The MD is different but also somehow the same, because there is a species of musical director that grows in certain soils. He has a small way of counting that makes the space in between numbers useful. At break, a girl named Naima offers me half her banana bread and asks me about Lancashire like it\u2019s a spice she has not cooked with. We talk about trains and vowels and the value of a pub that knows your drink without asking.\n\nIt happens again, this offness, during a run of a section where we all have to hum under someone else\u2019s line. The hum is easy and gorgeous and I am busy being part of it when, for the space of a breath, the room tilts. The MD\u2019s pencil falls off the piano with a clatter that is too loud for the minute it occupies. Everyone blinks. No one says anything, because we are professionals pretending to be chairs. The director says, \u201cOnce again from F,\u201d as if she can restart not only the song but the air. Naima glances at me with an inquiry that does not want to pry. After, when we are filling paper cups from a jug that insists on glugs at the worst moments, she says, \u201cDoes London make you feel like you\u2019re being watched by your old house,\u201d and I say, \u201cYes,\u201d and we grin because some metaphors choose you.\n\nWalking back to the hotel that evening, the city does what it does with itself\u2014scrubs up, lights up, shows off. A busker with a voice like well-used denim sings a tune that is a cousin of my own. A man in a peacoat stops in the middle of the pavement and frowns at a space above my shoulder and then says, \u201cExcuse me,\u201d to nothing, and I step aside with him out of politeness because even his nothing looks urgent. When I pass a shop window and catch my reflection, the lights in the shop strobe once, twice, like a wink, and it is very easy at that point to believe that the trick is me.\n\nBack in the hotel, there\u2019s a card under my door with a logo that looks like a golden pretzel and a note in handwriting that thinks very well of itself. Conrad has left it, or one of Conrad\u2019s Conrads, and it says he\u2019d love to talk strategy and that the window is now, which makes me snort because, according to men like Conrad, windows are always now and doors are always closing and roofs are always about to fall in. I put the card on the table next to the tiny kettle and the sachets of tea that taste vaguely of regret and I look at it and I feel how easy it would be to say yes to what is shiny because it is shiny. I think of Morris and his tongs and Laura\u2019s eyebrows and Mum\u2019s fork and the St Christopher. I think of the Blue Otter sign squeaking in the wind. I think of the man at the Priory hailing what wasn\u2019t. I think of me, in a coat, humming a line that holds other people up.\n\nIn the night, the corridor outside my room makes the small rude noises that hotel corridors make\u2014the trolley that bangs into something, the whisper-shout of someone who has lost their key, the sudden run of a child whose parents didn\u2019t manage bedtime. At three, because of course it is three, I wake with that particular knowledge that someone has said my name. It is not frightening, not in the film way. It\u2019s more like a roll call. I lie there and I say, without moving my mouth, present, and it quiets. The ceiling has its parallel bars of light. I keep my breathing even because if I don\u2019t, my heart will take it as a dare. I must sleep again because when my alarm murmurs at seven, the room is where I left it and the world is the right size. When I pick up the St Christopher to put him back on, he is warm and I have no proof of anything.\n\nWhat there is proof of is the way this could all spin. The workshop goes on. I learn to stand on a taped mark that is not mine because it looks like it is mine and then learn to forgive myself for thinking I can claim anything that has chalk on it. I learn the harmony line that sits nicely under my throat and makes me feel like a chair supporting someone else\u2019s back. We break for lunch and I sit on a step in the sun with Naima and a boy named Kit who pretends to disdain everything and then remembers to eat like a runner and we talk about whether football is a musical and Kit gets so excited he nearly falls into the street. My phone buzzes with a text from Gemma about a small spot on the morning show next week and I feel that small hot pinch behind my eyes that says, careful, love, keep room for the quiet.\n\nAfter, when I go to cross the road, a cyclist whips past me so close I could count the stitches in the knee of his jeans. He shouts, \u201cSorry, mate,\u201d and then adds, to the air half a foot behind me, \u201cThought you were stepping,\u201d and for a second the pavement moves under my foot and then doesn\u2019t. I stand there with my hand on the pole like a man waiting for news from a doctor, and the news comes in the form of a Green Man light and I go because that\u2019s what you do when lights tell you to.\n\nOn the train back north that evening, there is the warm clag of people who have earned their sit. Across from me, a woman eats crisps very thoughtfully. In the seats behind, two lads argue about whether it is acceptable to go to a wedding in trainers if they are clean. A man further down the carriage dozes and wakes and dozes and the part of me that wants everything to make story notices that, each time he wakes, his eyes flick to the aisle and then to the window, as if he expects someone to be sitting in the seat he left as a child. When the sun slips behind a cloud and the carriage gets the flat, ungenerous light of a tunnel without being in one, I look at my reflection in the window and, for a breath, there are two of me, layered wrong. One has his head tilted a fraction, listening. The train lurches. The images click together again. I say, quietly, \u201cNo,\u201d and the crisp-eating woman looks up and smiles like we have agreed to discipline the universe and then gone back to our snacks.\n\nLancaster Station is human again. The platform coughs up familiar coats. The smell of chips in the air is either real or memory doing a very good job of itself. I stand on the concourse and watch a man with a violin case argue gently with a woman about whose turn it is to be gracious. The sky has been pinked by someone overeager. I walk down past the Priory and the Castle and the river sits like a sentence at the bottom of the town and I read it without moving my lips. When I reach my flat, there\u2019s a parcel propped against my door that contains a pair of shoes I forgot I ordered in a moment of optimism. They are a little too shiny but I put them on and they make me stand slightly taller than I am, which is perhaps the point and perhaps a warning. On the corkboard outside, the lost cat Stacey has been returned, as evidenced by a new little note added at the bottom in all caps that says THANK YOU, FOUND HER UNDER THE BED. The picture of Stacey has a biro smile drawn on now, which seems unfair to Stacey but probably helps the child in the house believe in endings.\n\nI sit on my sofa and I say yes to the ensemble audition because you cannot only say yes to ideas; you must say yes to the bits that make your throat work and your feet sore. I text Laura and she replies with a sticker of someone collapsing on a chaise longue. I text Mum and she sends back a single word\u2014COATS\u2014and three hearts that are not quite the right colour but are somehow better for it. I put my phone face down and the room behaves. The St Christopher lies on my collarbone like a coin on a magician\u2019s knuckle. I think about tricks and about angles and about how much of our lives is choosing which story to show with our shoulders while our hands are doing something honest. I think about the feeling like a corridor and I decide, for tonight, that it belongs to somewhere else that is not my sofa.\n\nThere\u2019s a knock at my door that is not a knock so much as a cautious inquiry with knuckles. When I open it, it\u2019s the woman from the second floor who I only know as Mrs T because she signs for parcels and writes variations of deliver to Mrs T on our communal nonsense. She is tiny and upright and sees through things in a way that could be vicious but never has been, at least not to me. She holds out a foil-wrapped parcel as if it might misbehave.\n\n\u201cI made too much,\u201d she says, which is one of those universal languages. \u201cIt\u2019s lasagne, but I\u2019ve done it my way.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know your way,\u201d I say, taking it, suddenly breathless with gratitude.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t either,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s different every time. You were on the television. Very good. You didn\u2019t shout.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d I say, and she nods once, curtly, the way people do when they have decided to like you and would die before admitting it in the language of people who overuse their adjectives. As she turns to go, she pauses and looks not at me but to my left. She frowns. \u201cDo you have a friend in there,\u201d she says, and I feel every hair on my arms stand because it\u2019s nothing and because it\u2019s something.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d I say, as lightly as a person can who has decided his lasagne is an amulet. \u201cJust me.\u201d\n\nShe looks like she could call me an idiot or a liar or a man who needs to be told to buy thicker curtains. Instead she looks down at her sensible shoes and says, \u201cWell. Don\u2019t be long,\u201d in the tone of a person whose children were late for tea and learned the price. She goes. The corridor is suddenly itself with great dedication. I close my door and lean my forehead against it and laugh once, because I am not going to give fear the dignity of a speech.\n\nThat night, I sleep with the window cracked and the street comes in like a neighbour through a side gate. Somewhere, a fox makes a noise like someone trying not to cough. Somewhere else, laughter jumps a fence and runs into the next garden. I dream I am on a stage and I can hear the audience breathing and when I open my mouth to sing, I sing my name and the room sings it back not as Jake or Jacob but as two notes that mean the same thing. When I wake, morning is incremental and my ceiling has no faces and I, inconveniently, want both breakfast and to tell someone everything and to keep it all in a small jar marked Not Yet. I take the lid off slowly. The day sits there like a cat in sun, pretending it chose me.Chapter 8\n\nThe morning after Mrs T\u2019s lasagne, I wake with the taste of oregano and a small sense of being looked after that I am trying not to hoard. The flats across the street have their curtains at the half-mast that means weekdays, and the bakery below throws up that yeasty breath that makes you think your life is more wholesome than it is. I make tea and drink it standing up, an old habit from the years when sitting felt like an invitation to not get up again, and I hum into the steam because it\u2019s easier than thinking in straight lines. The email from the touring company sits starred in my inbox, not because I don\u2019t know what to say, but because I\u2019m greedy for the moment when the saying will still be saying and not said. The St Christopher has left a faint circular dint on my chest that looks like a punctuation mark. I touch it and tell myself to stop being dramatic and then give myself permission to be dramatic for exactly five minutes because even saints get breakfast.\n\nOn the way to The Otter I take the long cut along the river because it\u2019s good to let the water tell you what kind of person you are that day and today it says you are reachable. A man is throwing a ball for a dog that is a dog in the way that makes you want to apologize to it for not owning it. When I pass, he says, \u201cMorning,\u201d in the tone of a person who has decided the day needs greeting to behave. The dog pauses, ball soft in its mouth, and looks at my shoulder with interest, then shifts its gaze one thumb-width to the left. I say, \u201cAll right, mate,\u201d and it does that little sideways wag that means thank you for acknowledging my work and, also, you\u2019ve got something following you. It is ridiculous how easily a dog\u2019s glance can move your temperature, and yet there I am, warmer for it and colder where the air presses oddly at the edge of my jaw.\n\nThe pub smells like the nap between lunch and tea\u2014lemon in the mop water, a suggestion of gravy still lingering, the faint damp of beer mats that were too brave last night. Shaz is polishing cutlery with the concentration of a surgeon and the earrings of a woman who has never met a hoop she didn\u2019t immediately respect. She looks me up and down and says, \u201cYou look like you\u2019ve had an idea,\u201d which is the sort of thing that makes you feel both seen and accused. I tell her about the workshop offer in a paragraph that keeps trying to turn into a list. She listens and nods and doesn\u2019t say anything until I run out of words like a kid runs out of trampoline.\n\n\u201cSay yes,\u201d she says, as if the word itself is a seasoning and she\u2019s added it to a stew she\u2019s been waiting to finish. \u201cWe\u2019ll buy a cake. We\u2019ll say goodbye and we\u2019ll say see you and we\u2019ll say bring the coat back in one piece. If it\u2019s awful, we\u2019ll say we told you to try. If it\u2019s good, we\u2019ll say we told you to go. That way, we\u2019re right twice.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s how right works,\u201d I say, and she winks because of course it is.\n\nAt table three, a man with shoulders like two grievances and a scarf too light for his throat says, \u201cYou served us on the quay, didn\u2019t you? Yesterday. With the pink prosecco? You were quick.\u201d I open my mouth to disagree and then close it because his wife is already nodding, eyes kind, and I find it easier to say, \u201cGlad you were looked after,\u201d and take the compliment from whatever air offered it up. After they leave, Laura sidles over with the sort of step you use on a stage when you\u2019re pretending to be a tree.\n\n\u201cThought I saw you at the bus stop this morning,\u201d she says, casual as a cat. \u201cBut then you were inside, behind me, ringing in your tips, so unless you\u2019ve learned to split yourself\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d I say, half a plea and half a laugh. \u201cI\u2019m already being haunted by my better timekeeping. Don\u2019t involve buses.\u201d\n\nShe bumps my shoulder with her shoulder and eyes me properly. \u201cYou\u2019re not going weird about it, are you? Because if you go weird, I\u2019ll have to slap you, and HR will write me up.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I say, and I give the word enough ballast that it feels true while I\u2019m saying it. \u201cTired. Unused to being looked at even when I am and not being looked at even when I\u2019m not.\u201d\n\n\u201cClassic existential crisis,\u201d she says, delighted by the phrase as if she could put it on a t-shirt. \u201cHave a crisp.\u201d\n\nThe afternoon slides by with that melodramatic sigh it gets when a storm is considering Lancashire and then decides, very well, another hour. I take delivery of a box of lemons that thinks it is the size of a man\u2019s regrets and sign the slip like a person who understands citrus. Morris hums and does not notice he is humming until he stops to listen to his own tune and forgets it instantly. At four, I find a quiet five minutes in the store cupboard that smells like pepper and last winter and I send the email that says yes, I\u2019d be honoured, and I check it twice for spelling because there is something deeply humiliating about misplacing an L in honoured at the very moment you\u2019re telling the universe you mean it. When the whoosh goes and the email is a past tense, I lean my head against the shelf and grin into the dark like a teenager telling secrets to a nice wall.\n\nThe rehearsal room the following week is an uglier version of the kind of space that pretends to be neutral. There are scuffs on the floor that map out other people\u2019s ambitions and a stack of chairs that looks, as ever, faintly judgmental. The director\u2014Marta, brisk without being sharp\u2014claps her hands once for gentleness and once for authority. \u201cLet\u2019s warm bodies, then voices,\u201d she says, and makes us all do very silly shapes while our hearts decide if they\u2019re in on this. The other lads are different combinations of me in other decades and not me at all. Naima is there, cool in a way that isn\u2019t cold, and Kit is working very hard at looking like he isn\u2019t working very hard. We do a movement pattern that seems designed to discover what your knees think about pressure and, halfway through, I catch myself in the mirror and, for a long blink, there are two me\u2019s offset by a smidge, like someone forgot one layer when printing. The man I am in the second version is in a darker shirt, or perhaps it\u2019s the shadow of that, and his mouth is a beat behind my mouth. I do not flinch because I will not feed it the flinch, and the image clicks, and what remains is me looking slightly too serious for a person sliding diagonally across a floor.\n\nMarta gives notes in a way that makes you want to be better because she believes you can be, not because she will be cross if you aren\u2019t. \u201cYou lead with your left shoulder,\u201d she says to me without looking up from her notebook. \u201cStop apologizing to your right. The audience will forgive you everything if they think you meant it. Again from the lift.\u201d We go again. The MD\u2014this one called Tim\u2014clicks his tongue and claps a cross-rhythm and looks at me over his glasses like we have a pact. I remember the breath Laura taught me and I fill it and, for a little while, the world behaves because I have convinced it to with lung and attention.\n\nOn the break, I stand at the window and watch London do its very best impression of itself. Down on the pavement, a school group is being gathered by a teacher with the posture of someone born with highlighter pens. The last boy in the line\u2014tall, coltish, hoodie with a logo that means something if you\u2019re fourteen and fluent\u2014pauses, frowns, looks up in that exact way I am learning too many people do, and then says something to the air that looks like, \u201cWait.\u201d His mate huffs at him and tugs, and he goes, and I touch the St Christopher the way you check your pocket for your keys, which is to say I do not need to, and I do. Naima comes to lean beside me, holds out half a satsuma in the palm of her hand like an offering.\n\n\u201cYou all right?\u201d she says, and she might be talking about the chorus or about whatever it is I\u2019m wearing like a perfume you can only smell if you once owned it.\n\n\u201cI keep feeling like someone is about to join me,\u201d I say, making it a joke because the alternative is that I become the sort of man who corners a woman during a break and gives her a tour of his interior weather.\n\n\u201cThey probably are,\u201d she says, pragmatic. \u201cRooms are greedy. They want to be full. It\u2019s why we clap when people leave them.\u201d\n\nThe call from Dad comes while I\u2019m buying plasters for a blister that has just expressed itself like a wrong footnote. It\u2019s less of a call and more of a message that looks like an apology before I press play. There\u2019s not much in it beyond a picture of a microphone on a website put into my inbox by a man who can just about work WhatsApp. He has captioned it, If this is the right sort, I\u2019ll get it. The model number is impressive in a way my bank balance would prefer not to know. I reply with a thank you so warm it makes me flinch and he sends back a thumbs up that could mean anything, and then a second later a second thumbs up, because sometimes a man doesn\u2019t trust the first one to have told the truth. It occurs to me that the men in my family might be thumbs up people forever and perhaps it\u2019s fine, perhaps love is better for arriving like small signs you could ignore if you were trying.\n\nMum, when I phone her that night from the mosquito buzz of the hotel\u2019s bedside lamp, is watching some crime drama where everyone whispers in rooms that are too blue. She turns the TV down and I can hear Rachel purring like an overfull radiator. \u201cHow\u2019s your knees,\u201d she says by way of hello, and then, \u201cYour Auntie Lila says there\u2019s a lady at Slimming who swears blind she saw you in Morrison\u2019s on Greaves Road today arguing with the scales, and I told her you\u2019re in London arguing with people who tell you to raise your eyebrows at the second eight.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t argue,\u201d I say. \u201cI discuss loudly.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou argue,\u201d she says, with satisfaction. \u201cListen, love, there\u2019s a thing I should tell you, because you\u2019ll only go and find your own head about it and I\u2019d rather it be mine. When you were little, you did this before.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid what?\u201d I say, sitting up as if it\u2019ll make the phone hear better.\n\n\u201cShowed up twice,\u201d she says, so calmly that I check the line to make sure it hasn\u2019t doubled. \u201cNot to everyone. To me. And to Mrs Paterson at number twenty-one, God rest her. There were days I\u2019d be washing up and you\u2019d be in front of the telly with your tractor and then you\u2019d come in behind me and ask for a biscuit and I\u2019d say you\u2019ve just had one and you\u2019d say no and I\u2019d say well, who\u2019s that then, and you\u2019d say, that\u2019s me watching the tractors. I never told you because what good would it do, and then you stopped. Six? Seven? I thought maybe it was just the sort of thing that children bring home from other places and put down like leaves and then forget.\u201d\n\nI sit there with the phone warm against my cheek and the world doing that slow tilt it gets when you realize you are not the first person to live in your life. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause,\u201d she says, brisk affection buckling on its sensible shoes, \u201cif your child brings two of themselves into a kitchen, and both of them want tea, you don\u2019t call a priest, you make two teas and you tell them to keep it down because Neighbours is on. And you don\u2019t want to frighten them into feeling wrong. And because I thought maybe it was me. An extra you because I was a tired woman who wanted very much there to be someone changing the channel while I did the washing. It didn\u2019t feel bad. It felt like when you catch sight of yourself in a window and remember your face belongs to you.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do I do with it?\u201d I say, and I am ashamed instantly of the way the pronoun has turned into it and not him, not me.\n\n\u201cYou sing,\u201d she says, as if I\u2019ve asked what weather coat I should wear. \u201cYou go to work. You kiss your friends when they will let you. You don\u2019t stand in the middle of the road because you\u2019re thinking about air. And if you feel frightened, you send it out of the room with a firm voice. Things respond to firmness. That\u2019s how I got Rachel to stop sleeping on the cooker. Also pepper. Pepper keeps cats off everything.\u201d\n\nI laugh, because it\u2019s either laugh or explain to the hotel curtains that I have accidentally stepped into a folktale and I could do with a committee. \u201cDo you ever think\u2014\u201d I begin, and stop, because adulthood affords you this brief lucidity where you understand that some questions have no teeth in them.\n\n\u201cI think lots,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t tell most of it to anyone because people are tired and it\u2019s rude to wake them. Come Sunday.\u201d\n\nThe day we find out about the tour is a Friday, damp and obliging. I\u2019ve barely sat my bag down before Gemma texts a picture of a clipboard with the word cast above a list that looks like a family tree. My name is there, not in bold but not faint. Ensemble, with a cover for a man who sings a duet in act two and has a hat that I could learn to make look sympathetic. I stare at the phone until the letters are not letters anymore. Naima calls and whoops into my ear with such sincerity I think my hearing might carry the shape of it for a week. Kit texts, The coat is so good, with seventeen coat emojis, which are not exactly accurate, but we are not in the business of accuracy, we are in the business of making shapes stand for other shapes.\n\nI tell The Otter by simply not being able to stop smiling while carrying four plates at once, which leads to Shaz deciding it\u2019s not fair to make me hold news in as well as food. She taps a knife against a glass with the authority of a woman who has brokered peace treaties over chips. \u201cOur Jacob,\u201d she says, not caring that I like Jake because she likes the biblical weight of the long name when she\u2019s being ceremonial, \u201chas been invited to pretend to be other people in good shoes. He will be leaving us for a bit. Try not to break anything while he\u2019s gone. We will take up a collection for the trouser press he will inevitably buy with his first wage packet.\u201d The cheer is bigger than the room. The regular with the scarf pats my arm like we\u2019re a team that just scored, and Mrs St Christopher puts her hand to her chest with a little theatrical gasp and I want to hug the whole place and also run away because the human heart, even when surrounded by the beer taps of its youth, is only so big and mine is at capacity.\n\nThat evening, because one must, I walk down to the Priory to tell the castle because it has as much right to know as anyone else and because the stone has a way of sorting your news into piles: this is the part that matters; this is the part you have invented so you can pretend the part that matters is dignified. The church is shutting and the woman with the flowers is counting stems like a general tallying his troops. On the path, a man and a woman are taking wedding photos in a wind that has decided to be in all their hair at once. The photographer makes soothing noises at the sky. I skirt them and lean on the low wall where you can see the river and the line of houses that think they are in a painting and the clump of trees that looks like it\u2019s eavesdropping. My breath goes in and out in the way that only gets earlier in the day if you\u2019re careful with it. When I turn to go, there\u2019s a lad about my age standing by the gate, frowning at the space a foot to my right in that now-familiar way. We do that British dance of pretend deference\u2014after you, no after you\u2014and as we pass he says, \u201cIs your brother\u2014\u201d and then shakes his head like he\u2019s dropped a biscuit and won\u2019t stoop for it, and adds, \u201cSorry, weird question,\u201d and I say, \u201cI don\u2019t have a brother,\u201d and he says, \u201cOh,\u201d in a way that is both apology and proof, and the gate clicks behind me with the sound of a full stop.\n\nThe thing with the double stops being a whisper and becomes a done fact the night Laura rings me from outside the chemist opposite the bus station and says, very calmly, very Laura when she\u2019s driving a situation with both hands, \u201cI am going to say something and you\u2019re going to breathe and then we are going to decide to laugh and then we are not going to stop laughing until it\u2019s not frightening.\u201d I say, \u201cOkay,\u201d because there\u2019s not much else you can say to such a well-ordered threat, and she says, \u201cI just watched you walk past me, go into the shop, buy plasters, and come out again. You nodded at me. Your hair was stupid and you had your coat on but not done up like a free man. You were you. And I am on the phone with you and I can hear the kettle boiling behind you and I can hear the oven fan that I keep telling you is on its last legs. So there are two of you, and one of them needs socks. I am holding it together because I went to Brownies and learned to cope. Tell me you are making tea.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m making tea,\u201d I say, because I am, because that\u2019s a thing that renders you real even if your molecules are trying out other careers. \u201cAnd I have plasters, so at least the other one knows what\u2019s good for his shoes.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d she says, in that clipped register she has when she\u2019s rearranging the filing cabinet inside her mind and finding the file is missing. \u201cHe walked like you. He didn\u2019t look translucent. I didn\u2019t feel a chill. He had the little frown like you have when you\u2019re calculating how much tip to draw out of someone with nice nails. He looked at me and he said, \u2018All right,\u2019 and he did your voice in your mouth. It was you. And then he was gone because he\u2019d turned the corner because that\u2019s what people do when corners are there.\u201d\n\nI sit down because if I do not sit, my legs will do an impression of sitting without me. \u201cOkay,\u201d I say, grateful to the syllables for their shape. \u201cOkay. It\u2019s happened to Mum, when I was a kid. She said I stopped and then here it is again. It\u2019s probably brain. It\u2019s probably grief-adjacent. It\u2019s probably me being looked at too much and the world\u2019s weirdness backwashing into us. It\u2019s probably none of that. I don\u2019t feel frightened. Or at least, I feel the kind of frightened that\u2019s useful, like the bit where you stand in the wing and then step three inches forward because otherwise you\u2019ll drink your whole body into a knot.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m coming over,\u201d she says, and I can hear her feet turn in the sound of the phone and the bus engine sighing its disappointment. \u201cI will bring biscuits. And something heavy to hit you with in case you are an imposter and also a test, like, how many questions can only my real Jake answer.\u201d\n\n\u201cNone,\u201d I say. \u201cYour friendship is so shallow it requires no specific knowledge,\u201d and she snorts, and I hear her decision to be unafraid flatten itself like pastry.\n\nShe arrives with a tin of shortbread that she calls medicinal and a bottle of wine that she calls for the saint. We sit at my kitchen table and do the kind of talking that feels like circling a pond with a torch, agreeing not to panic if two ducks become four. We make jokes about a rota for my selves and we make a plan that involves her taking pictures of any me she sees, at a respectful angle, like I am a rare bird at the feeder. When she goes to the loo, I watch the door like a child who has remembered that mirrors exist and thinks perhaps he should apologize for them. When she comes back, she stands in the doorway, looks to my left, and swears under her breath in a way that would have made our headteacher fail to hide a smile.\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d she says, and the word is an SOS and a spell. \u201cHe\u2019s there. He\u2019s there. I am not, at this precise second, hysterical. He\u2019s there and he\u2019s not a breeze. He is a person, he is\u2014\u201d She looks at me properly then, not at the air, and her eyes do the glass-bright thing you get when the body decides it needs to lubricate its panic. \u201cHe\u2019s older,\u201d she says, very small. \u201cBy a minute. He looks like you after you\u2019ve realized you can\u2019t afford a certain brand of cheese and you\u2019re going to get it anyway.\u201d\n\nI stand up slowly, because a slow man is less likely to break what he is walking toward. The air to my left is the air it always was and then it is the air it might be and then it is occupied by a sensation like I have stepped into a tune that I usually hear only on Wednesdays. I do not see him because seeing implies eyes and light and there is none of that. I feel him in that way you feel someone in a room with your eyes shut, in the shift of space and the voltage of attention. I say, as politely as a man who is about to cry because his friend looks like she\u2019s watching him evaporate can say, \u201cHello,\u201d and the floor stays the floor and the kettle clicks because it was going to anyway and then the room loosens. Laura sags against the doorframe and wipes her face with the sleeve of her cardigan and laughs once, rude and righteous.\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a flatmate. He better be tidy.\u201d\n\nThat night, I do not sleep so much as keep company with myself. The faces on the ceiling do their brief theatre and then respect my request for calm. Mum sends a text at eleven that says, Don\u2019t be a wally, and it\u2019s so perfectly on brand I let my face go soft with it. I dream that I am standing on the quay looking into the river and the river is glass again and under it this time there are not people but rooms, fifty of them, each with a version of me in it at a table, writing to someone I love. When I wake, afternoon has decided to start the day, and there\u2019s a message from the production saying they\u2019d like me to pop in for a costume fitting Friday and also would I mind a quick chat with marketing about whether I have any photographs of myself that make me look like I am having an experience. I say yes to all of it and put the kettle on and it boils in the way it always has, on the same hob, in the same kitchen, for a man who is feeling two degrees more companioned than he\u2019s used to.\n\nOn Friday, the costume department is a heaven of order that lives under the polite tyranny of rails. There are coats, obviously, and hats that have seen more arguments than most people, and a woman named Trish who can tell what decade you belong to by the angle you hold your elbows. She measures me with a tape that seems to be made of both cloth and gossip. \u201cYou\u2019re a thirty-eight on a day you haven\u2019t had a sandwich,\u201d she says, and pins something near my hip with a sound that could be a tut and could be a blessing. Naima emerges from behind a screen in a dress that looks like it was angry at first and then decided to be graceful; she does a small turn for me and I clap because sometimes the job is simply to witness and approve. Kit puts on a hat and becomes so handsome even he notices and takes it off quickly like the hat might be catching.\n\nWhen the fitting is done and I\u2019m released back into the city, I walk with my head one notch higher because the coat has taught my shoulders how to sit. Near the theatre, Kai appears like the answer to a question I hadn\u2019t asked out loud. He is on his way to a gig, deck of cards in his hand as if his fingers would get lonely without them. He grins when he sees me and tips a queen into existence from behind his ear as if he\u2019s rehearsed the trick on my head and been waiting for me to show up to pull it. We stand and talk in the traffic noise, two boys from the north pretending very successfully not to be fourteen.\n\n\u201cYou all right?\u201d he says, and I say, \u201cDefine,\u201d and he nods like I\u2019ve passed. He flips a double lift with the ease of someone who eats breakfast with sleight of hand. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking,\u201d he says, which is how men of our age say, I have been frightened for half an hour and don\u2019t know where to put it. \u201cAbout mirrors. How they take what you are and give it back and sometimes the glass goes lazy and doesn\u2019t bother to be exactly glass. You sing and it makes a room full of people feel reflected. You ever think sometimes reflection is like a drunk friend, showing up too many times at once.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think lots of things,\u201d I say. \u201cAnd then I fold them and put them in a drawer and sit on it.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d he says. \u201cKeep your drawers shut.\u201d He looks past me then, that same left-of-centre look everyone has been doing, and his face does two things at once\u2014entertained and very, very still. \u201cWell,\u201d he says, to the air that is holding its nerve. \u201cThat\u2019s a trick I can\u2019t explain.\u201d He sniff-laughs, like a magician who admires a rival\u2019s audacity, and his hand goes briefly to the back of his neck as if he could scratch off a shiver. \u201cYou\u2019ll be grand,\u201d he adds, and means both the song and the science.\n\nBy the time I get back to Lancaster that night, the train has rubbed off all my edges and I am briefly the shape of everyone. The station caf\u00e9 is closed but smells like something sugared has been arguing with something fried, which is its own comfort. I check my phone and there\u2019s a photo from Laura that makes my scalp itch and my heart want to write a letter. It is a picture of me\u2014jeans, white shirt, coat open\u2014walking past the window of the chemist again. The photo is taken at that distance where familiarity does the heavy lifting; the posture, the jaw, the stupid hair that needs arguing with. In the reflection in the glass, I think for a second that I can see me twice, me in the window man and me in the photographer\u2019s angle, making three, and then the train squeals, and a gull barks at a crisp packet, and I decide that for tonight I will eat toast and make notes on act two, scene four where the chorus moves like rain.\n\nBack in my flat, I press the St Christopher to my lips like a man who has learned how to be superstitious on weekdays. I email the production my measurements and a photograph of me in a coat where I look like a man about to apologize for being late to a revolution. I text Mum to say that I have been measured by a woman with a tape that knew my past and she replies with a sticker of a tape measure that has a face, and the face is patient. I text Dad a link to the microphone that won\u2019t break if you look at it wrong, and he sends back a short sentence\u2014Ordered\u2014without any punctuation, which is how our family does it when there\u2019s no room for the extra bits. The room is itself. The window does no tricks except the trick glass does when it shows you that you are there when you think you might not be. I go to the sink and wash a cup for the sake of it and put it on the rack and watch the water run from it like a thin sheet that moves itself, and I stand, not because anything has asked me to, but because it feels useful to demonstrate to the room that I can.\n\nOn Sunday, I carry ham and cake to Mum\u2019s because the pilgrimage needs a sacrifice and Mum\u2019s god is thinly sliced and appropriately salty. She has set new pelargoniums at jaunty angles, like they\u2019re trying to overhear the street, and Rachel does an elaborate ignore before allowing me to scratch the precise place where her spine becomes tail. We eat and we gossip and we inventory our worries like sensible women. I tell her about the coat, about Kai, about Laura\u2019s photo, and she listens like she\u2019s sitting a test she expects to pass. When I finish, she says, \u201cWell,\u201d in a tone that makes a cul-de-sac into a through road. \u201cThat\u2019s interesting. The thing is, love, if you\u2019re going to be more than one person, you\u2019re going to have to be very good at rest. Bodies don\u2019t do well when the occupants are greedy. And if there is more than one of you, tell the other one to take the bins out. He can pay rent in black bags.\u201d\n\nWe watch a quiz show that asks you to remember the names of capital cities and then tries to trick you with fun facts and neither of us falls for it. On the way out, she gives me a Tupperware box of stew that leaks immediately in protest at its own design and we laugh and then we double-wrap it, as if we can outwit physics. In the doorway, she looks to my left, not dramatically, not as if she is looking into a sudden corridor of light, just eyes flicked in the way you do when you hear a name from another room, and she nods once, approval granted to a thing that has not asked for it. \u201cAll right,\u201d she says, as if to me and to anyone I might have brought.\n\nOn my way home, the river looks more like steel than slate and a boy on a scooter takes the corner too hard and doesn\u2019t fall and his face splits into a grin so wide it could catch rain. The Blue Otter sign squeaks even though the wind is not trying very hard. I am here, in this, and also not only. The feeling sits with me on the bench like a good joke that can\u2019t be told yet because the person it\u2019s about just walked in. I breathe in a way that suggests I have learned one useful thing about being alive, and then I take my phone out and type, slowly and without drama, a message to Shaz that says we need to talk schedules, and a message to Laura that says he can have Wednesdays if he wants but the bins are both of ours, and a message to me, which stays unsent, saying, let them see you, let you see you, let him see you too. The air behaves. The light behaves. Night comes on like a room meaning you no harm.Chapter 10\n\nThe week between saying yes and leaving stretched and shrank like a jumper under a tap. Every time I thought I had found its shape it went off and did a different impression of itself. There were very practical tasks that could be done with lists and bags and the satisfying click of a lid on a plastic box, and there were the other tasks that come disguised as duties and turn out, once you\u2019ve taken their coat, to be feelings. I wrote down everything that looked like it wanted being written: socks, spare charger, throat spray, coat, scripts, St Christopher, the good pen, biscuits, spare biscuits for the future, a spare future for the biscuits. I opened cupboards and looked at tinned tomatoes like we were in a long-distance relationship. I put my name down for the rota at The Otter for two more shifts and then crossed it out and then wrote it back again because I couldn\u2019t bear the idea of them imagining me gone and I couldn\u2019t bear the idea of them having to imagine me at all.\n\nShaz\u2019s way of coping with departure was to run the kind of military operation a more fanciful woman would describe as a hen-do for the heart. She drew up a schedule that had my last week annotated like a map of a complicated city. Monday was cake tasting which in her case meant a plate of three slices from three separate bakeries and the pronouncement that none of them were quite right, which was code for I have decided to bake it myself. Tuesday we would practice not crying by watching a sad film and not crying at it, which lasted thirteen minutes until a dog did the thing dogs do in sad films and both of us had to look out of the window and say harsh things about the scenery in order to survive. Wednesday she would pretend to forget my name and Thursday she would call me by my full name like she was the announcements at a station and then Friday would be the party and we would all congratulate each other on not making a fuss while making such a fuss that the fuss had to ask us to take our shoes off. Morris pretended to be cross in a way that involved putting an extra pie in the oven every half hour and then baffling us all by claiming no knowledge of how they got there.\n\nThe phenomenon\u2014we had stopped calling it anything with a capital letter\u2014kept turning up to put its finger on my shoulder and remind me that being singular was a hobby, not a law. There were days when it was a rumour at the edge of a room, when the only evidence that anything odd was happening was the fact that the air would breathe before me and after me and sometimes on behalf of me. There were other moments when its presence was the cleanest fact I had. Twice, coming home in the early dark, I found the bins already out at the kerb, lined up like good little soldiers. Once, the bathroom light was off when I was sure I\u2019d left it on, and the towel folded into that apologetic rectangle I do when I\u2019m trying to impress no one. A note appeared on my kitchen table that said buy milk in my handwriting and I refused, on principle, to give this any currency, even as I went and bought the milk and put it in the fridge of a flat that contained the ghosts of all the milk I hadn\u2019t bought on time.\n\nLaura dealt with it by making it part of the routine as if we were feeding a lodger we couldn\u2019t see. \u201cHe gets Wednesdays,\u201d she said, writing it on the wall calendar in her kitchen in a thick pen that bled through the paper and marked the plaster. \u201cHe can have Wednesdays and any day that begins with an S where you\u2019re not doing anything important. He can pay rent by doing the bins and the big clean before you let a man with a deposit form see this place. He better not drink my wine because if he does I will find the metaphysics necessary to slap him.\u201d In the way of a person who has known you since your hair thought it could get away with anything, she gathered my fear in her two hands the way a person gathers a goose\u2014firmly, efficiently, with a degree of swearing\u2014and moved it from one side of the room to the other where it could honk quietly without getting under our feet.\n\nOn Wednesday, the doorbell rang at a time of day when doorbells mean either post or bad news and I braced for both. It was a parcel that had travelled south to north in a way that looked like it had cost someone an effort he would refuse to call an effort. Inside was the microphone I had sent Dad the link to, and a little note folded the way men fold things when they don\u2019t trust their own handwriting, written on a slip of paper that had once been around a pack of screws. It said, Big enough? and then the second line said, Don\u2019t rinse it under the tap, which made me laugh and then blink much more fiercely than one ought to blink under a kitchen light. I set it up on the table like a guest at a small ordination and spoke into it as if I was saying grace for a roast I could not afford. The sound it made of me was both me and something I could learn to grow into. I sent him a voice note and the back of my neck tingled as it went, not with woo-woo, not with corridors, just with the way a man sometimes knows he is sending a message into a room that has been empty too long.\n\nMum took three days to ask whether he\u2014her word for him was he, not it\u2014had made himself useful and when I told her about the bins she made a satisfied noise and said, \u201cGood. If you\u2019re going to be two, you\u2019re going to be twice as useful. That\u2019s all I\u2019m saying.\u201d She had decided, in that way she had of turning a thing inside out and making it fit, that she had been given a second son without having to go through childbirth, which she had always maintained was greatly overrated as an activity, and if there was a polite haunting in the house at the far end of the quay then the polite thing to do was to put out a saucer of milk and let it be. When I mentioned I was leaving just after Sunday lunch, she did her face that is a practised balance between brave and I will die if you do not text me before Preston, and then she said, \u201cI\u2019ve bought you a new scarf. It\u2019ll look better with a coat that isn\u2019t yours,\u201d and we both laughed from the middle, because it is a relief when someone loves you enough to tease you where you are fragile.\n\nThe farewell at The Otter was the sort of thing that would look tacky if it wasn\u2019t made with so much sincerity it could have powered the lights. The chalkboard had MY FIRST TOUR on it and someone had drawn a coat that made me look like an admiral. The balloons were either the wrong colours or exactly the right ones, depending on whether you were a person who owns a spreadsheet. There were paper stars with my name in lipstick and a banner that was clearly a bed-sheet, the flowers still ghosted in its weave. Shaz, who had sworn last week that there would be no speeches, got up on a chair with the authority of a chair\u2019s natural predator and delivered an address that made a man at table six cry into his gin and a woman at the bar say, \u201cYou\u2019ll make me smudge,\u201d in a voice that betrayed the fact she had been softened into kindness by a long afternoon on her feet. I was told to say a few words and the few words multiplied like rabbits and I found myself talking about the first day I\u2019d carried four plates without dropping any, about the strange religion of regulars and how they will convert you without asking, about the fact that there is a kind of family whose breaking is still a family and that this was it, this room with its sticky tables and clean glasses and the sound of laughter that could lift a dead horse. When I finished, Shaz handed me a present wrapped in tin foil because she had lost the paper and inside was a Tupperware box of stew and a small printed photo of me at the age of nineteen with hair like a promise none of us could keep. On the back she had written: Don\u2019t forget who bought you your first throat sweets, and a phone number I already had, and a PS that said: ignore Conrad, we don\u2019t like his name.\n\nA man I didn\u2019t know put a tenner in my hand and told me to get myself a sandwich at the services, like I was going to war, and Mrs St Christopher fastened the medal more securely round my neck with a clumsy little knot that felt like something a church would teach you if it was kind. Morris promised to stay open late on nights when I finished late if I texted and said I was passing, which is how men say I will always have a chair for you. Laura pressed a pack of biscuits into my back pocket and said, \u201cEmergency,\u201d like she was a small god of sensible advice and sugar. We ate too much and drank exactly as much as you\u2019re allowed to when you will be driving in the morning and sang not at all until the very end when someone put on my audition on the telly and everyone watched it with the intensity of a group looking for proof they\u2019d known before it happened. I caught my own eye on the screen, that second where I always look left as if my mother could have arrived in the wrong place by accident and then made it right by looking, and I raised my bottle at the boy on the telly and he raised his literal mic at me, and if that isn\u2019t a trick then nothing is.\n\nI slept at Mum\u2019s the last night because not to would have been a small treason. We ate stew that tasted like my childhood and yesterday and if that sounds unlikely you have not had stew made by a woman who has been feeding a family on not-quite-enough for a lifetime. We watched the quiz where the man with the haircut like an apology tries to make us forget capitals we once knew by telling us about the bread they bake there, and we were so rude to him from the sofa that the cat left the room in protest. Mum put my overnight bag by the door at nine-thirty in a gesture that said I am very sensible about this and then stood in the kitchen looking into the space to my left for a longer beat than politeness demands. \u201cAll right, love,\u201d she said, and I did not ask whether she meant me or the air that has lately been telling us truths we already knew and were pretending not to. Before bed she put the scarf round my neck and stepped back with the satisfaction of a woman seeing a curtain hang correctly for the first time, then took it off because I\u2019d suffocate in my sleep under such carefulness. Upstairs, the bed smelled of the laundry detergent she buys because it has the word spring in the name even in December. Downstairs, the St Christopher hung from the bedpost because I didn\u2019t trust my own neck not to forget him.\n\nNight in my mother\u2019s house is loud in small ways. The boiler is proud of itself and needs us to know it has been working. The fridge adores humming and stops only to test if we are listening. The street outside refuses to be quiet even when the town has agreed to be, because there is always one fox and one boy with a scooter and one woman laughing on a phone. I woke at three with my heart near my mouth, not because I was frightened but because it had come to tell me that I was leaving and that the child part of me who thinks leaving means loss and loss means punishment had sat up to ask whether the biscuit situation would be maintained. I lay there and did the four counts. I listened for the corridor feeling and what I got instead was the warm-decided quiet of a house that knows me. At some point, I slept again and in my dream I was in the theatre, on the wing, and Del\u2014the man whose job it is to nod you into your fate\u2014was there with his headset and he said, not yet, not yet, and then he looked to my left and said, both, and when I stepped on the stage the light did not burn, it bathed.\n\nMorning had its way with us and we let it. Mum fussed in a register that would have made other people insane and made me calmer, because it was what the day was for. She told me three times to text at Preston and twice to stop for a wee whether I wanted to or not and once not to pick up hitchhikers unless they looked delicate and in need of soup. We put the pelargoniums into a position where they could spy on the wicket gate and we locked and unlocked the front door to make sure the ritual had been acknowledged by whatever part of the universe makes note of small diligence. When I hugged her for the last time in that hallway before I would be someone else\u2019s person for weeks, I felt the bones of her in that way that has nothing to do with frailty and everything to do with the fact that there is a framework that has held you up before you knew you were a weight. She looked to my left one more time and gave the same nod as she had given to me two minutes before and said \u201cbe good\u201d to both of us, and I wanted to say\u2014ridiculously, tenderly\u2014mum, we are, and instead I said, \u201cSee you Sunday,\u201d because a promise disguised as a plan is often the only honest thing you can offer.\n\nThe motorway south felt like an old song whose chords you could play in the dark. The road was generous for once, the big white vans didn\u2019t behave like men who were in love with the idea of being square, and the car, sainted with her new coil pack, made a purr that sounded like promise rather than threat. I put on the playlist that is too embarrassed to show itself to anyone else and sang to the bits that do not ask for me to be brave. At the services near Stafford I stopped for a tea that tasted like the memory of tea and texted Laura a picture of a sign that said Keep Left Except to Overtake and she wrote back, politics. Past the point where the fields start to pretend to be suburbs, the sky did that city trick of becoming bigger because the buildings were trying so hard to own it, and I felt the tilt, the little pull in the chest that you get when you are near your capital even if your capital has never been yours. The studios flickered across the windscreen like a place you glimpse in a film and think, oh there you are. The hotel, beige on beige, swallowed me and spat me into a room that knew exactly how much hot water to give a man before he praised it on an online form.\n\nRehearsals are a discipline like baking or prayer; they make your day into shapes you can predict and then they throw flour everywhere and hope you learned something from the mess last time. Marta stood at the front like a fulcrum and made us into levers. Tim tapped out a rhythm on the side of the piano and made our lungs coin-operate. Naima made a joke about communion when we all drank from the same jug and made the youngest lads laugh and then blush. We did the beginning until it didn\u2019t look like the beginning any more. We did the bit in the middle that everyone forgets and found it was the bit that makes the rest make sense. I learned to move like I had room for other people, which sounds like a therapy note and is also a fact on a stage. In the middle of a morning where we had to stand very close together and pretend that closeness was the room itself, the air did that slip, that sly sideways shuffle, like someone had moved a mirror and not told me. I felt him\u2014the other, the brother I would not call brother in case he decided to move in with his furniture\u2014standing where an understudy stands when he is not understudying a position but a feeling. The back of my neck cooled. The note in the harmony line tucked itself under my tongue and waited. \u201cAgain,\u201d said Marta, and we were all again, and if you want a definition of magic you could do worse.\n\nOn Thursday, they put the coat on me for the first time and it did that ridiculous thing clothes do sometimes where they make you into the person they thought you were when they were bits of fabric on a table. The shoulders said stand up. The hem said here is your gravity. The cut said yes you are allowed to own a body. Tim laughed at my face because I had that expression men get in shops when a garment does not betray them, and he said, \u201cDon\u2019t get used to it, we are only borrowing handsome,\u201d and I wanted to tell him about all the times I had lived on borrowed handsome and how this felt like the first time it was going to pay us back, but there isn\u2019t time in a day like that for a monologue.\n\nThat afternoon, during a run that was more like a stagger but had moments of flight, Marta called a break and pulled me aside with two fingers. \u201cWhen you sing the second line of the second verse,\u201d she said, \u201cyou leave yourself. I want you in it. I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s better without you, I want you at the centre of your own noise.\u201d It was the sort of note that made me want to take her home in my pocket and feed her stew. I nodded and said, \u201cYes,\u201d and she said, \u201cNo, say I will do that,\u201d which is different and is what an adult is for. I will do that, I said, and in the next run I did the opposite of leaving myself. I planted my breath and I watched my mouth shape the words and I felt the St Christopher on my skin like the small coin that proves you did the laundry. There was a slice of mischief at the edge of the light, a little shimmer like a hand waving from a carriage, and I ignored it in the way you ignore a good dog begging for a chip because you know someone who doesn\u2019t have as good a dog will give them one. The note stayed. The room agreed to be mine for the bar.\n\nThe going-away turned out to be two goings-away. There was leaving Lancaster, which felt like moving out of a coat you were still wearing. There was leaving the part of me that used to think he would get found out if he spoke too loudly. Both were messy and neither was dignified and I have no intention of providing a cleaner version for posterity. I kissed the lintel of my flat like a drunk Catholic and I put my key on the hook like a man who will borrow his own house back at Christmas. I sent Mum seventeen texts in an hour and then deleted five for being silly. I told Laura I would send her a picture every time I saw a kettle that wasn\u2019t mine and she told me to stop being soppy and then sent me three pictures of kettles she had found on Google with faces drawn on them. I took Soup a packet of dog treats I had no right to buy and left them with a note at my dad\u2019s because he was at work and I was feeling brave in tiny ways he might not notice.\n\nThe first city on the tour was Newcastle and it greeted us like an aunt who had run down the path in her slippers. The river lay like a lazy blade and the bridges acted like they had been put there for no other reason but to make us cry about human ingenuity. The theatre smelled of dust and lemon and someone else\u2019s nerves. We signed in with a felt pen that didn\u2019t quite want to, we were shown to dressing rooms that had seen more admissions and less denial than most churches, and I stood in front of my mirror and arranged my face into the sort of expression you give yourself when you are not yet the person you need to be and you are making an appointment to meet him. Naima hummed a run that told me a joke in a key I wanted to learn. Kit spun his hat on his finger and pretended it was the plot. Marta did the rounds like a vicar who knows the names of all your sins and still wants you in her congregation. Tim grinned at me like the man who lets you off detention because he saw you not do the thing you shouldn\u2019t have done.\n\nOn the second night a flu, upper-case F, took the man whose hat I am allowed to wear if his head won\u2019t, and the call came down the corridor in that very specific tone that means we all get to find out whether our boast about learning our lines in the bath was a boast or a prophecy. I had my shirt on and my trousers half on and the St Christopher in my mouth because I was using my teeth to fix the clasp without unhooking my brain, and Del put his hand on my shoulder and said, \u201cIt\u2019s you, mate,\u201d as if he was asking me to hold his ladder. The body has a setting for this and mine found it. I did the quiet panic, which is a very efficient thing once you have taught it not to spill. I let my hands do all the things they had practised in rooms with better air-conditioning. I said the little prayer you say to the floorboards\u2014be there\u2014and then I walked into a light that was not as cruel as it looked.\n\nWhat they forget to tell you about going on for someone else is that the audience can smell it. They get a whiff of change and their instincts stand up in their seats like dogs at a window. The company can smell it too and most of them love you for it\u2014most of them, most nights. I sang my first line and the room agreed as if we had all shaken hands before and forgotten. In verse two, the place where Marta had told me I tend to leave myself, I made a strong decision to be present to the level of irritating. I did not allow my head to run at the speed it fancies. I watched my breath like a kinder ghost. At the end of the bar, the shimmer came and went like a man at a bus stop who thinks each bus is his and then remembers he is on the wrong side of the road. A light did a small flutter which probably only three people in the stalls noticed and I think all three of them were men who have a favourite screwdriver. I finished the verse inside my ribs. There was the briefest sensation\u2014like the ones I had around the Priory and on the motorway\u2014of something moving past me with both kindness and intent. \u201cHello,\u201d I thought, stupidly, kindly, to the ether, and if it answered it did it in a language my ears will learn later.\n\nAfter, in the sort of corridor where girls with better hair than me have cried into tissues, Naima pressed her forehead into the side of my head in a gesture that would look unromantic in a photograph and is the most intimacy I have ever felt in a busy building. \u201cYou did it,\u201d she said, not whispering because she respects a room, and Kit said, \u201cNever do it again so well because then they\u2019ll make you do it on purpose,\u201d and Tim slapped the top of the piano with his two hands like a man who is pleased with his own children. Marta took my face in both her hands and looked at me with the relief a woman permits herself when she has backed a horse and it has crossed a line she had the patience to define. \u201cYou stayed,\u201d she said, and that is a love letter in any language.\n\nThe stage door afterwards had the usual small crowd of people who think perhaps that if they can catch you between two versions of yourself they will find the one who will give them a better story to take home. I signed three programmes and one piece of a bus ticket and a woman asked me to write To Louise, you are my reason, and I laughed a tiny bit and said, \u201cYou sure,\u201d and she said, \u201cWrite it,\u201d as if I was arguing against gravity. A man said, \u201cI saw you on the telly,\u201d and I said, \u201cI saw me on the telly too,\u201d and we both grinned in that watery way of men who aren\u2019t going to discuss their actual feelings at a back door. Then the air did its thing, because of course it did, in a place that is a corridor on purpose, and the security light clicked in the way security lights click when they are trying to figure out whether a moth is a person. A lad from the scene dock looked up and over my shoulder and frowned, the now-familiar check of the eye. \u201cMate,\u201d he said, to nothing and everything, \u201cyou can\u2019t come through this way,\u201d and then he laughed to himself because of course he was talking to a draft. I touched the St Christopher. I felt my own neck under my hand. I went to the pub with the two people who, by the end of the week, would know how I like my tea and when to tell me to shut up.\n\nNews got back to Lancashire faster than a rumour in a smoking shelter. Morris texted a photo of The Otter\u2019s telly with a grainy picture of me in the coat under a caption that said: OUR LAD in chalk letters too big for the board. Mum rang and didn\u2019t ring because she was squealing and we both agreed that breathing would be a good plan for the next three minutes and then we could attempt syllables again. Dad sent a message that said, Saw you. Good. which is Shakespeare in our language. Laura sent a video of her and Shaz and half the pub jumping up and down like people in an advert for lager and then a second video of herself alone in the kitchen, whispering into her phone, \u201cProud, now go to bed,\u201d because she knew the adrenaline would try to put me on a train to the moon.\n\nBy the end of Newcastle I had learned a few things about being plural in public that you can\u2019t teach yourself in a small city. I learned that walking through a city where you have not yet made yourself known will always feel different to walking through one where your voice has already bounced off its walls. I learned that talking to strangers at a stage door uses up the same bit of your music as singing and must be rationed like good bread. I learned that, if you feel him at your shoulder and you stand up straighter rather than turning to see, he will stay polite. And I learned that there are cities where the shimmer rides you like a second coat and cities where it refuses to get off the train.\n\nSheffield was coats and chips and a hill that assumed we would get over it. The theatre there had the kind of backstage that is made of corridors that disagree with each other, and in three different ones I felt that peculiar moment of double occupancy, like a bench halfway through a park trying to decide whether to be damp. Naima told me, in a tone like telling the weather, that when she was a kid in Tower Hamlets she used to hear her nan call her when her nan was still in the bath, and she had just assumed everyone who loved you had two voices in order to double their chances of being obeyed. Kit told me swears in Polish taught him by a drummer that were so effective they made a light bulb in the dressing room flicker, and then we had to stand on chairs and coax it back into good behaviour by pretending to know about fuses. In a caf\u00e9 where the coffee tasted like effort and kindness, a woman with hands that looked like she had lifted three children with each one leaned over and told me to eat more bread and I did, which felt like listening to God.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t all theatre. In Leeds, on my day off, I took the microphone my father had bought me to the little studio behind the shop that sells records even in the year of our lord where records are a metaphor, and I tried it with someone else\u2019s gear. The sound of me came back and I didn\u2019t hate him. I sent Dad a clip, holding my phone slightly away like a man bringing a baby to a bar. He sent back another thumbs up which in our vocabulary was a hug in a bad suit. I nearly called him then because we were already in the city of his current couch and nothing bad would happen if I made two men eat chips and talk about football while making very sure never to say the thing we were there to say. In the end I didn\u2019t because the day did that sprint where it shows you all the things you could do and then makes you do the one you usually do, which in my case was roaming a market to see what my mouth fell in love with and what my hands could afford.\n\nThe shimmer sometimes made itself into small acts of kindness that were either magic or other people being better than we deserve. In a caf\u00e9 in a city I was still getting the prepositions for, I went to pay and the woman behind the counter said, \u201cIt\u2019s on the house,\u201d and when I said why she said, \u201cBecause you look like a man who is carrying his other self in his pocket,\u201d and I laughed in a way that made her laugh and then I paid anyway because I am my mother\u2019s son. In a chemist that smelled of both clean and sadness, a boy at the till double-charged me and then blushed while correcting it, and when he gave me the refund he said, \u201cI thought there were two of you and now there is one,\u201d and then looked mortified as if he had just announced that he had swallowed a bee. In my hotel room in Sunderland the bedside lamp clicked on at three-oh-eight and I said, \u201cNo,\u201d and it clicked off, and I lay there and practised the sort of authority that doesn\u2019t get given back.\n\nThe thing about tour is that days learn to look like each other and then you put a different name at the top of them and pretend. We travelled with a little silent animal of exhaustion that asks for nothing and takes what it needs. We learnt to sleep in chairs and we learnt to sleep in twenty-minute bites and we learnt to make jokes that would be unacceptable under normal oxygen. We took turns being the person who cared about breakfast. We took turns being the person who cried in the shower because he missed a river that was doing the right kind of brown. In Nottingham, Naima lost her voice and then found it again half an hour before curtains in the bottom of a mug of disgusting tea that Tim made in the way only a man who has no respect for plants can. In Birmingham, Kit went on a date with a boy who had a laugh like a broken trampoline and we all debriefed him as if it had been a mission to Mars. In Manchester, a light over the second wing hummed in a way that made the stage manager throw his clipboard at it and then pretend he hadn\u2019t. In Liverpool, I swear that a woman in the second row who had my mother\u2019s hands had come in for the last number and sat down just long enough to hear me and then left, and when I told Mum she said, \u201cI didn\u2019t leave the house, love. My slippers held me hostage,\u201d and then sent a picture of Rachel looking smug and the pelargoniums looking like they were practising for their show.\n\nBy week four, the feeling of him with me stopped making my skin pretend to be a bird and became the sort of weight your coat has in winter when you\u2019re glad of it. It didn\u2019t make me lazy and it didn\u2019t make me brave; it made me careful, which is sometimes what bravery is wearing when it goes out in daylight. I learned when to ask him politely to take the bins out. I learned when to say, this is my verse. I learned to say, not here, when the wing felt crowded and my knees were already doing their little interpretation of an old man\u2019s day. I learned to text Laura even when I had nothing to say because the act of sending a message to a person who will read it when you are on a train you do not recognize is one of the little versions of faith that keep the world correct.\n\nWe came back to London for a week in a theatre that is older than half the arguments I have had with myself. Conrad was there in the foyer with his good suit and his good teeth pretending to make conversation with a man who looked at him like a catalogue. \u201cJacob,\u201d he said, and I said, \u201cMr Conrad,\u201d because I am not above using a title to remind a man of his own name. He offered me concepts and windows and I offered him a schedule and a throat and we both smiled like we were talking about weather. He said he could make this be more and I said more what and he did that important little laugh that means nothing and everything. Naima nodded at me from down the corridor with eyebrows that said don\u2019t. Tim made a noise in his throat like a piano stool being moved. I took the card again and put it in the pocket with the saint and the lip balm and the little laminated picture of a man trying to hold up too large a ship, and I thought, you can be the man who takes me somewhere one day if you say please in a language I speak.\n\nOn the Wednesday of that week, after a matinee where an entire school had decided to practise their future cheering, I walked out of the stage door into a patch of sun and felt, clearly, not frighteningly, like someone had walked out with me at the exact same pace. It wasn\u2019t a shadow because shadows are obedient even when the light isn\u2019t. It wasn\u2019t a trick of a window because there weren\u2019t any. It wasn\u2019t tiredness because tiredness is heavy and this was light. The door clicked. The street did its people. A woman pushing a buggy glanced up in that way that has become our punchline and then, very simply, because she was herself, she smiled and said, \u201cAll right, lads,\u201d and pushed on. I laughed, which is to say I refused to invent a shape that wasn\u2019t there, and I tucked the medal back under my shirt, because tucking is ritual and ritual is how a man who needs to know which parts of himself he can put on and take off learns to be present in the bit where he lives.\n\nWhen we got our first week off, a space opened that felt like the inside of a mussel shell. The tour wore off me and the town wore back on. The river did its slate thing and the bus misjudged its huff and the man with the cap lifted two fingers twice and then three times because he forgot the math of greeting. The Priory sat in the weather like a good dog. The Blue Otter smelled right. Stacey the cat was back on the board as FOUND even though she was in fact making a nuisance of herself under the bench. Mrs T knocked with lasagne that had elected to be vegetarian this week because she had read something about arteries and made it sound like a thing you could bargain with. Mum\u2019s pelargoniums were gossiping in new voices. We sat with stew and I told her about Tim and Marta and coats and the way theatres in different cities ask for different vowels. She told me about Margaret at the post office and her new habit of making everyone sign for things twice to keep her handwriting strong. She told me Rachel had learned to sit on the telly at the exact spot where the weather appears so that we would not be tempted to be glum about rain. We watched a crime show where everyone hissed and then spoke louder and then whispered again. She looked, three times in the space of an hour, to my left not because she had decided anything but because the body learns where to put its courtesy.\n\nBefore I left again, she got out the calendar and circled three dates that were not the ones I had told her about because she thinks some days need to be noticed more than others regardless of their plans. \u201cPut your rocket here,\u201d she said, pencil poised, and I did, obedient to the language of our kitchen. In the doorway she straightened my coat like the coat was a concept that could be improved by love. \u201cOne more thing,\u201d she said, as if we hadn\u2019t been doing nothing but things since I was born. \u201cIf he is there when you sing\u2014and I think sometimes he is\u2014let him sing with you. Not because you need him to but because he might need to. Kindness costs you nothing. And make sure you eat. You go thin when you\u2019re being two people.\u201d I left with a bag that was heavier by two Tupperware, one scarf, and an instruction about compassion I had no right to ask for and every intention of practising.\n\nOn the platform at Lancaster Station, the train did its shudder and the speakers did their apology. A boy with a scooter held it like a girlfriend. There was a fox on the embankment with the kind of mean gorgeous face that makes you think he has a schedule that doesn\u2019t include you. I stood with my bag at my feet like a dog that pretended not to understand language and I said, as modestly as a man who is about to ask the air to behave can say anything, \u201cPresent.\u201d The feeling that came wasn\u2019t the corridor. It wasn\u2019t the off. It was the simple pressure of being held by the world exactly where I stood, no more and no less, which is all you can ask for whether you are one person or two. When the train arrived, I got on. I turned and waved because that is what you do. Mum waved back, her hand small and brave in the cold March light. For a heartbeat and a half, there were two hands, one to the left of the line of glass and one to the right, both of them hers, both of them mine, and then the carriage moved and we all leaned into the fact of it like smart people. The river slid and kept sliding. The pelargoniums, back on their steps, listened to the street like old women. I sat down. I put my hand over the St Christopher. I breathed like a person who had been taught. I let the day do its part.",

                              "content": "On most nights the river looks like a belt of slate. It holds the late sun in its buckle; the city collects itself in the reflection, old stone and new glass smudged into soft moving lines. I cut across St George\u2019s Quay with a tray tucked under my arm and the smell of chips in my sleeves. The Blue Otter\u2019s sign squeaks when the wind wobbles it\u2014someone\u2019s meant to oil the hook; someone always forgets. Everything is always on a list. I push open the heavy door with my hip, and the place breathes at me: frying oil, spilled cider, lemon slices drying to pale husks in the metal pots.\n\n\u201cJacob,\u201d yells Shaz from behind the bar. \u201cYour table\u2019s moaning for their mains.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Jake,\u201d I say reflexively, but Shaz is already turning away, balancing three pints in one hand. Everyone calls me Jacob but I like the bookshop-soft vowels of Jake. When I was a kid in Skerton, my mother put her hand around the word as if to warm it. Jaaake. I tie on my apron, knot it twice, and go to collect the plates.\n\nThere\u2019s a rhythm to the place\u2014bell, shout, scrape of chairs, laughter, that moment where everything thins to a sharp line and then thickens back into chatter. I slide plates beside elbows and smile until the muscles in my face twitch with their own odd life. I remember you from last week. You had calamari. Did we sort your extra lemon?\n\nA group of women at the corner table are out for a birthday and they are stretched tight with jokes and Prosecco. One has a sash that says THIRTY, FLIRTY &... some other word I can't make out because the ribbon has fallen into her chips. She winks at me. There\u2019s confetti in the near-dark; it will get into the carpet and glitter for months. Outside, someone whips a motorbike along the quay; its sound rattles the windows. I set bowls on the table: the fish stew, the schnitzel that looks like a toasted map of some lost country, the vegan burger that always leaks beet juice like a wound.\n\n\u201cLove,\u201d says the sash woman, \u201care you still doing the early bird deal?\u201d\n\nI give the answer she wants to hear and then the answer that exists on paper and make a joke that lands well enough. My jokes are serviceable. Above us, the ceiling is brown from a leak that was fixed but not painted. I look at it sometimes and feel like it is an organ with a scab.\n\n\u201cYou heard?\u201d says Morris, fishing chef, as I duck into the kitchen. He is big in the way of men who have stopped apologizing for it, with soft eyes that never look squarely at your mouth when you talk. He flips a piece of cod like it\u2019s light, like air.\n\n\u201cHeard what?\u201d\n\n\u201cFinalists are being confirmed today. My niece\u2019s got a mate who does tech for that show. Britain\u2019s Talent. Got one of the kids from Preston in. The magician with the cards. Ridiculous fingers.\u201d He wiggles his own. \u201cYou\u2019ll get a call.\u201d\n\nHe says it like weather. I laugh because I don\u2019t know what else to do with my mouth. He doesn\u2019t know that when I tie my apron I loop the knot the way my mother taught me and say\u2014to myself, in a whisper\u2014let them see you, let them see you, three times. He doesn\u2019t know that the knot is the only thing keeping my stomach from flying off in some odd balloon.\n\n\u201cMaybe,\u201d I say. \u201cIf they want a waiter messing up \u2018Bridge over Troubled Water\u2019 for the nation.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour voice could butter toast,\u201d Morris says, and he turns back to his grill.\n\nI sang on my break the first time, because Laura, who does coffees and knows a bit about everything, was learning the ukulele, and the chord shapes made my hands itch. Bring it here, I said, and we went out by the bins, and she played some clumsy Gs and Cs under my voice and I opened my chest and watched steam leave me. Three trickling pigeons watched us as if we were the most interesting bins in Lancashire. Then we went back in and I dropped three forks and knocked over a glass and Shaz called me a hazard but with a half-smile. It was Laura who sent the video to the show, late at night, giggling, making shushing motions with a finger. A week later\u2014I mean three months; memory makes the pacing wrong\u2014it turned out that the video had its own life, bobbing around Facebook like a paper boat that somehow doesn't get soggy. A producer with a soft phone voice called. We did prelims. I stood in front of judges with faces like statues cheered up for TV and sang a song my mother used to clean to, and the clapping came like rain. Stuff happens like it\u2019s always happens. And then you go back to carrying cutlery.\n\n\u201cOrder up,\u201d says Morris. I carry messages from his mouth to the mouths of other people.\n\nAt half-nine I take a tray to the beer garden, which is really just a yard with fairy lights that someone pulled from a Poundland box and wove into loops. Labrador flopping under a table. The Lune is a smear of silver. The customers\u2019 faces are all angles and glow. There\u2019s a breeze that I feel in my hair but not on my cheeks, which is strange. My cheeks are too hot. I blink. The fairy lights flicker. For a second the labrador looks at me and then looks at a point slightly to the right of me, ears pricked, and I feel in my throat that peculiar drop\u2014like a lift starting before your body\u2019s agreed. I shake it off. Someone whistles the first bar of \u201cHey Jude\u201d and everything goes on.\n\nAfter close, I sit on the back steps with a cup of water and a single cigarette that I keep telling myself is the last one. The alley stinks of steady bin. Laura nudges the door open with her hip and sits beside me.\n\n\u201cGot a message?\u201d she says. She always sounds as if you should have had one, and you\u2019re being unreasonable by not yet having had it.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d I say. \u201cBut Morris says it\u2019s today.\u201d\n\nShe blows her hair off her forehead. \u201cMorris says lots of things,\u201d she says. \u201cHe says he once saw Robbie Williams buying ham at nine in the morning. Like, good for Robbie.\u201d\n\n\u201cEveryone needs ham,\u201d I say.\n\n\u201cYou,\u201d she pokes me in the forearm, \u201cneed to stop pretending it hasn\u2019t already happened. We\u2019ve done all this. Audition. Standing ovation. You cried in the toilets and pretended you hadn\u2019t. My mum texted me full caps. At some point you\u2019re going to have to admit that you\u2019re not just a waiter, and the world\u2019s weird enough to make room for your big old ballad heart.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou call my heart a ball,\u201d I say, \u201cand yet claim to be my friend.\u201d\n\nShe leans her shoulder into mine. \u201cI\u2019ll be offended later.\u201d She stares out into the alley. The light from the little motion sensor flares and dims, like the alley is a creature taking slow breaths. \u201cYou feel that?\u201d\n\n\u201cFeel what?\u201d\n\nShe shivers and rubs the skin of her forearm briskly. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Like the air\u2019s off. I\u2019m being daft.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou and your second sight,\u201d I say, but someone else\u2019s laughter\u2014one of the early leavers walking down Bulk Road\u2014rolls into our alley and feels like a tide after a ferry has passed. Displaced. Late. I stub my cigarette and push myself up. The night is long and my bed is short.\n\nOn my way home, I walk by the Priory. The castle sits heavy and black, a shape that the sky forgot to fill in. My trainers scuff on the pebbled walkway. I hum to myself. I should be saving my voice, but if I keep it in too tight I get wired and things buzz at the edges of my eyes. An ambulance hisses past up the hill and turns off its siren as it rounds the corner. There are shadows that gnaw at corners you didn\u2019t know the day had carved. I think of my mother\u2019s flat up on Ridge. Think of her calendar\u2014twelve pictures of cats in odd hats\u2014and the way she circles things she\u2019s looking forward to and things she\u2019s dreading, the same circle, same pen. She puts a little face beside each. Happy if it\u2019s a hair appointment. Sad if it\u2019s the dentist. On the day with my audition she\u2019d drawn a little rocket.\n\nI knew she would get distracted on the day of the prelim by something she couldn\u2019t explain. My mother has a mind like a crooked drawer; things slide forward or back. She watched my first audition on catch-up with a blanket on her lap and sent me a voice note with a lot of sniffing that said, proud of you, proud of your face, proud of your heart. Also when are you coming round for tea. It is always pride and tea with my mother.\n\nMy phone is a rectangle of cold in my pocket. When I take it out it makes a shape of light on my palm that feels like holding someone else\u2019s hand. No messages. No missed calls. I put it back and then take it out again and then put it back, as if I\u2019m trying to teach it a routine. There\u2019s a fox on the pavement outside the old bookshop, ragged and fine. It looks at me a long time. There are many jokes about foxes and bins. We nod at each other like men on their way to different boats.\n\nThe flat smells of washing powder and the garlic I burned yesterday morning because I was making pasta while half-thinking about the run-through. I rinse a bowl that I didn\u2019t finish my cereal in. I pour it again, because I am sure the universe had meant for me to finish that first bowl and it feels rude to it not to. I eat sitting on the arm of the sofa, which is silly and safer than it feels. The television throws faces at the wall, none of them mine. A laugh track laughs. I turn it off and the silence rushes and fills the room like water coming back into something you had been holding under.\n\nIt is late when the call comes and it doesn\u2019t come. It is earlier when the call comes and it does. I will tell you both because that\u2019s how it felt.\n\nThere\u2019s a good kind of dread where everything in you is awake. At half eleven my phone screen blooms: Number withheld. It\u2019s such a pompous way to say no. I let it ring once, twice. I consider letting it go just to feel the drama of it. I don\u2019t. I answer and say hello in the careful tone you use when you might be speaking to somebody who will change your life (again).\n\n\u201cHello, is that Jacob Hargreaves?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2026 is. Hi.\u201d\n\n\u201cHi Jacob,\u201d says the voice. It is a woman\u2019s voice, pills of white sound on her words like she\u2019s in a big room. \u201cIt\u2019s Gemma from the Britain\u2019s Got Talent team. Are you well?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m good,\u201d I say, and then I say, like a man who has seen too many dramas where they talk about receipts and budgets, \u201cI\u2019m well, thank you.\u201d\n\n\u201cLovely,\u201d she says. She is smiling. I can hear a smile like I can hear rain starting on a car roof I\u2019m not in. \u201cJust calling with some exciting news. We\u2019d be delighted for you to perform in the live final.\u201d\n\nThere is a moment\u2014there is always a moment\u2014where the words roll toward you and you think they\u2019ll bounce off your chest and scatter on the floor and you\u2019ll have to sheepishly pick them up and put them into some other sentence. But they don\u2019t. They land. They go in. To be precise, they drop like a small stone into a very deep well.\n\n\u201cI\u2026\u201d I say, and then I push my breath out and it takes some words with it. \u201cYes,\u201d I say. \u201cI mean, oh my God, yes.\u201d I find myself pacing the rug in two steps and then back two steps. There is a version of me on other days who would have acted cooler. He has better hair. He is in a shirt. \u201cThank you. That\u2019s\u2014thank you so much.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re thrilled,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s been a joy to watch your journey.\u201d She makes it sound like a train. \u201cWe\u2019ll send over your call sheet and some details. You\u2019ll need to be in London for rehearsals on Thursday. How are you getting here?\u201d\n\n\u201cI can drive,\u201d I say, because I\u2019ve already worked it out and it\u2019s been the same every way I tried it\u2014train too expensive, coach too long, hold onto the dented little car Laura\u2019s cousin wants to sell me for a hundred quid until Friday. \u201cI can be there.\u201d\n\n\u201cPerfect,\u201d she says. And then there\u2019s a lot of confirming that I will be me when I get there, and talk of wardrobe and press, and an email follows the call like a dog follows runners.\n\nWhen the call doesn\u2019t come, I go to bed with my hands clenched. At three a.m. I scroll through videos of people I don\u2019t know making pancakes, or building sheds, or playing with dogs that make snorting pig sounds. I pat my phone and say to it, quietly, don\u2019t forget me, which is ridiculous because it is glass and metal and will do what it does without my tenderness. At four I dream about a corridor and a door that opens only from the other side, and a voice saying dear, straight through me. When I wake, it is with the taste of salt, though I haven\u2019t been to the sea in weeks.\n\nWhen the call has come\u2014when it has done its delicate tumble into my day\u2014I make a sound in my empty flat that is not music and is not not. I am grinning. I am suddenly close to tears. I sit down on the floor and then stand back up. There is a point where joy and terror are so close that you can\u2019t tell them apart. It seems cheap to say that. It\u2019s still true. I call my mother. The call connects and then doesn\u2019t, then does. Her voice answers\u2014my mother\u2019s voicemail. She has never figured out how to make it say her name. The automated woman tells me that she is not here. I talk to the not-here woman as if she is my mum. I make a joke that my mother would laugh at and the woman says, sorry, please leave your message after the tone, and the tone happens like a bird hitting a window.\n\n\u201cMum,\u201d I say. \u201cWe did it. We proper did it. They want me in the final.\u201d I tell her the times and the place. \u201cI\u2019ll come round tomorrow. I\u2019ll pick up those plastic containers you want back.\u201d I am making lists now because sometimes lists are bridges between you and the place you\u2019re going to. I hang up. I call Laura and she picks up after one ring.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you dare tell me you didn\u2019t get it,\u201d she says without hello.\n\n\u201cI got it,\u201d I say, and then I am listening to my friend screaming across town, the sound scudding past chimney pots and the castle and the place where the KFC used to be before it became a vape shop.\n\n\u201cGet in,\u201d she says. \u201cGet absolutely in. We\u2019re going to\u2014what do you want us to do? Do you want confetti? I have some somewhere. No I don\u2019t. Shaz will have confetti. She\u2019s got the soul of a christening. We\u2019re going to make you a banner. We\u2019re going to\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to take my Thursday shift,\u201d I say. I can hear the grin in her answer.\n\n\u201cRude,\u201d she says. \u201cYes.\u201d\n\nI go to the window. The street below is thin and blue. My breath does a strange thing, makes a cloud and then folds itself back into me. Someone is walking their dog in a big circle around nothing, letting it sniff at last night. The dog pauses, turns its head like it has heard my window, and looks up. For a second, I think it\u2019s making eye contact with me, and then it tilts, peering to one side, like I am a wind chime it can hear but not see. It whines, half-hearted, and the owner tugs. Come on then, come on. I watch them until they turn the corner.\n\nOn Wednesday, word has gotten ahead of me. I walk into The Blue Otter and there\u2019s a cardboard glitter cut-out of a star taped to the espresso machine, with JAKE written across it in a handwriting that I recognize as Shaz\u2019s\u2014too neat for a person who wears as many rings as she does. Someone\u2019s hung a pair of tights from the chalkboard sign and written Knock \u2018em dead underneath, then crossed out dead and replaced it with silly in smaller letters. Laura gives me a hug with her arms wrapped too tight and then too loose. Morris gives me a bag of throat sweets wrapped in cellophane, like a present for a child who\u2019s got through a sorely bearable operation. A man I do not recognize, bald, with a smile like a line drawn quickly, claps my shoulder.\n\n\u201cProud of you, lad,\u201d he says, as if he has known me since I was in nappies. \u201cDon\u2019t forget us when you\u2019re famous.\u201d\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t if I tried,\u201d I say, and it comes out too earnest, and I feel the flush burn my neck. He laughs kindly and returns to his Guinness. They are all kind, today, even the woman who once told me, after I dropped the cutlery on her lap, that she had known my sort, with our stupid hair and our stupid dreams. She pushes a plate of chips toward the edge of the table so I won\u2019t have to stretch as far.\n\nAt three in the afternoon, after the lunch rush, I stand in the alley again with Laura and sing under my breath. The alley sounds different when you sing in it. The sound bounces around like sympathetic birds. I warm up gently\u2014lip trills, me-me-me mes that feel ridiculous and necessary\u2014and then I try the first verse of the song I\u2019ve chosen. It is a song my mother played on a CD in the car while we crossed the Bay Bridge on Sundays when she still drove just because it was a thing to do. The words sit in my mouth and don\u2019t fight me. When I finish the verse, the air feels warmer. Someone from the kitchen throws out a bag of peelings and they thump against the bin lid. For a flicker moment I think I see myself reflected in the dull metal, but it\u2019s the sky and a pigeon, and the shape of a thing you expect to be there.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve nailed it,\u201d Laura says. \u201cDon\u2019t overthink. You always overthink and then you miss the easy note.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not overthinking,\u201d I say, which is not true, but I\u2019ve learnt that if you say a lie quietly enough it hopes itself into being brave.\n\nThe rest of the day stretches into a long, strange cloth. A man in a pink shirt leaves me a tenner tip and a drawing of a fish on the receipt, with eyes that look like a little pair of question marks. A woman with a soft black cardigan gives me a napkin folded around a St Christopher medal and says, \u201cMy Tony wore this when he was on the radio,\u201d and I say thank you and then he died anyway hangs there and I want to fill it with the appropriate words, and I do not know what the appropriate words are. I touch the metal. It is warm. It keeps its warmth for longer than I expect.\n\nAt closing time, a kid\u2014he can\u2019t be eighteen\u2014comes in and asks for a glass of water. His face is too old with tired. Shaz gives him a glass and a packet of crisps and doesn\u2019t say anything until he has eaten, and then she gives him a name of a place down the road that can help you if you\u2019re between lucks and he says thank you as if he is practicing gratitude for his future. The world is full of people doing the best they can with hands that are a little too small. God, listen to me. I\u2019m becoming one of those blokes who makes metaphors out of sandwiches.\n\nWhen I get home I sit on the floor again because the floor feels honest. The email from the show is long and exact. There are call times that are very early. There are rules about social media and about what I can wear and what I cannot. There is a polite request\u2014no logos, no slogans, no political statements. There\u2019s a line that says travel at your own risk and then a line that says we will do everything we can to assist. It is a lot and not enough. I skim and then go back and this is how it goes when your brain is busy; it puts a bookmark in everything and then loses the book. I put the kettle on and forget and then it boils and makes that high steam scream like a very small train. I don\u2019t know what to do with my arms. I make a list, handwritten, because that makes it more unbreakable.\n\n\u2013 call Mum, again\n\u2013 pack shirts (white, grey, the blue one if the buttons don\u2019t look cheap)\n\u2013 trousers (don\u2019t wear the chinos that make your knees look like boiled eggs)\n\u2013 shoes (polish them, don\u2019t pretend it doesn\u2019t matter)\n\u2013 charger / spare\n\u2013 throat spray / water / honey\n\u2013 St Christopher medal? (if she won\u2019t miss it)\n\nI stare at the question mark. The medal sits on the counter like it would melt if I looked away. I drape it over a mug. The mug is from a charity shop and says BEST DAD in blue letters. I bought it because it made me laugh like swallowing a hiccup. My dad left when I was eight, taking half a sofa\u2019s worth of clothes and a toolbox in a shopping bag, and left his wedding ring in the soap dish like it had become the wrong size. He lives near Leeds now with a woman named Mandy and a dog named Soup. He sends me money on Christmas Eve every year, no message. Once he sent it on the twenty-third and I thought perhaps he\u2019d changed and then I realised it was a bank thing with weekends. I don\u2019t know what I would say if he phoned me. I don\u2019t know what he would say. There is a lot people don\u2019t say on purpose, because they are worried it will make a thing worse, and then the not-saying is what makes a thing hard.\n\nI try Mum again. The voicemail is there again, like a small black pool you can send words into. I send them. I tell her I\u2019ll set out early. I lean my forehead against the windowpane for a cool second, and watch the street. The street watches back with a little tattoo of reflections.\n\nI sleep badly. I dream of ladders and a hand I cannot see, and a kettle placed over the wrong ring of a cooker, and a line of children in angel costumes, and my own voice wrong in my mouth. I wake with my heart in my throat and it takes me a minute to swallow it back. The morning makes everything silly anyway. I tug on my jeans and make toast and burn the first slice and scrape it anyway because that\u2019s what you do if you\u2019ve lived here long enough and your mother taught you not to waste things even when the economy is a face you do not recognize.\n\nHalfway through my second tea, the phone rings again. I think, what else can they need to tell me, and then it is my mother. Actually my mother, not the woman who makes her absence into an automated courtesy.\n\n\u201cJacob,\u201d she says. She never calls me Jake. She hasn\u2019t since she caught me kissing my elbow in a mirror and laughing as a toddler. Somehow the name got cemented there and she won\u2019t scrape it off. \u201cThey\u2019ve been talking about you on the radio.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey have?\u201d\n\n\u201cOn Radio Lancashire,\u201d she says. \u201cI phoned in. I told them you used to sing to the cats.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, Mum,\u201d I say, sitting down because this is both the best and the worst thing. \u201cWhat did they say?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey said, \u2018He sounds a right one, your son,\u2019 and I said, \u2018He\u2019s a delight,\u2019 and they said, \u2018Good luck to him,\u2019 and I said, \u2018He doesn\u2019t need luck, he\u2019s got flair.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cFlair,\u201d I say. \u201cThat\u2019s me.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re doing a quiz next,\u201d she says, as if this is important too. \u201cDo you need chips? I could make you a package. I don\u2019t know how that works with the motorway but we could try.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d I say. \u201cCome with me? To London?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh love,\u201d she says, and her no sits on the line like a cushion. \u201cYou know trains. Me and trains. And your Auntie Lila\u2019s coming round because she wants to see what I\u2019ve done with the pelargoniums. You\u2019ll send me a picture.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can watch it live,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019ll wave.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got the Freeview now,\u201d she says, and I can hear the pride in her voice, as if she personally invented it. \u201cI love you, pet.\u201d\n\n\u201cLove you too,\u201d I say, and I want to say, will you be all right, truly, will you be all right in a house that sometimes does all its own weird noises at once, will you be all right if the kettle breaks again, and I don\u2019t, because she will be all right and she will not be all right whether I say it or not. I promise to come Sunday. We will eat freezer pizza with extra toppings and she will pick bits of ham off and give them to the cat. The cat is called Rachel. There is no reason for this.\n\nAfter I hang up, I sit very still until the kettle clicks just to let me know it is alive. I look around my flat. I see, as if through someone else\u2019s eyes, the places where I have not tidied. The sweater on the chair like a person is wearing it on the wrong day. The mug ring on the table. The shoes by the door, one lying on its side as if exhausted. I tell myself it will be good to leave it like this and then come back, because then I can clean, and it will feel like fixing a section of a week that otherwise got away with itself. I strip the bed and then change my mind and put the same sheets back on because I\u2019m too jittery to find the clean set in the airing cupboard. If I try to fold anything right now I will end up with a swan or a mess.\n\nAt noon I go back into town because they insisted on buying me a lunch send-off, which is silly, because I will be back. But you don\u2019t say no to people when they are insisting on showering you with those small kindnesses that keep a person upright. The air over the river is the kind that smells like iron. The sky is built like a poorly mixed paint. A man is busking outside the Market Hall, though he isn\u2019t playing anything I can hear. His guitar hangs like a spare rib. He makes a face at me. Not nasty. Just\u2014curious. Hard to explain. It is easy to think people are looking at you because you have been told you are about to be looked at, and then you get to London and you are one in a pile.\n\nWe eat ham and cheese toasties and a giant crumble that Shaz brought in a foil tray that is, I think, the lid of a large Christmas tin. Laura keeps trying to press money into my hand, as if I might somehow get to the M6 and suddenly find myself at a toll booth demanding exact cash or a song. At one point, someone\u2014Morris\u2014puts on my audition on his phone and sets it on the bar. The video is a square. I am a square in the square. There is a moment where I start the song and my eyes flick to the left and I remember, when I see it again, looking for my mum in the audience even though I knew she wasn\u2019t there, which is ridiculous and probably a clich\u00e9 and still true. I watch my own mouth open. I watch my hands hold the mic like a thing that makes a sound you could catch. People around me watch me watching me, which is bizarre. Laura wipes her eyes with her wrist as if pretending she is wiping flour.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t make me cry,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019ll make my mascara run and I\u2019m going to a thing tonight.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat thing?\u201d\n\n\u201cBingo,\u201d she says solemnly, and we both laugh.\n\nI leave with a hug from ten people and a bag of sandwiches that will sweat in their clingfilm because I will forget they are there and then remember them at the wrong time. I promise to text when I get to my mum\u2019s and then again when I set out in the morning and then again when I arrive. Shaz, whose rings flash like fish scales, presses something into my hand.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2014?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a little saint I carry when my daughter\u2019s got an exam,\u201d she says. \u201cLaugh if you must.\u201d\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d I say. I look down. It is a small laminated card with a picture of a man holding a ship that is much too big. The expression on his face suggests that he believes everything will be all right even though he is about to drop it. I put the card in my wallet next to the bus pass I no longer use and the receipt for a coat I decided I couldn\u2019t afford and then didn\u2019t take back anyway because it made me look like I had shoulders.\n\nOn the walk home, a marching band that is not there plays in some alley in my head. I keep time on my leg with my hand. I think of the stage. The lights as hot as the sun. The clipboard girls with their precise smiles, the man in the headset who will nod you into your fate one step at a time. I think of my father, listening perhaps, or flicking past. I think of the boy with the water and the crisps. I think of my mother, sitting on the edge of her sofa, telling the cat she is not to step on the telly because Jacob is in it.\n\nThe evening curls around me and I sit on my sofa and do nothing the way a cat does: purposefully. I put my phone on charge. The screen glows in the corner like a lighthouse for moths. I try to read but the words make a soft carpet and I can\u2019t find the thread. I watch a clip of a man in a suit jumping rope very fast and then a woman making a pork pie and then a toddler saying the word dinosaur with increasing frustration that no one is understanding the science of what he is trying to communicate. My chest feels like it does when I\u2019m a step away from a cold and my head feels echoes. It\u2019s fine, it\u2019s fine.\n\nJust before I sleep, the light from the street peels itself off the wall and makes a white mark near the ceiling that looks for a second like a long face looking down at me. I squint. The mark dissolves into two planes of car light. My heart settles. I put my hand out and imagine another hand taking it, because that is what bodies that have evolved to live in groups sometimes need to be told will happen, even if it is not happening right then.\n\nI dream that I am crossing the Bay Bridge with my mother and the water below us is made of glass and under it are people, lots of, lots of people like fallen stars, and each star is a face I could name if I had more time, and my mother says, breathe now, love, because we\u2019re going over, and I hold my breath and then I wake and the sun is at the right angle to put a stripe across my knee. I lie there for a minute and let everything line up.\n\nMorning. The air has a bite. My suitcase\u2014the one my cousin gave me when she moved to Spain and said, bring it back when I come home, and then she didn\u2019t\u2014sits by the door like a dog waiting to be taken for a walk it doesn\u2019t know whether it will enjoy. I go down the stairs and there\u2019s a new flyer pinned up on the board by the front door: lost cat, Lunt. Answers to Stacey. Reward. The photo is of a cat with an expression of deep suspicion. I touch the paper. It crinkles. There\u2019s a whiff of wheat from the bakery downstairs; I will miss this when I go. Someone says my name as I step into the street, and I turn, but the street is doing its own bright ordinary thing. A bus heaves itself around the corner. A kid kicks a can and it skitters, lively as a mouse.\n\nI have promised to go to Mum\u2019s before I go south, because that is what the calendar in my head says is proper. I load the suitcase into the back of the car. The car is blue and aspirational, which is to say I aspire for it to start each time. It is Laura\u2019s cousin\u2019s, on loan, the kind of car that has a cassette player and a smell of old apple cores. The seat warms quick from the sun on the driveway. I put my hand on the wheel and it is not a metaphor for controlling my destiny; it is a wheel. I drive out. The streets of Lancaster fold around me like hands. I take the left past the water, past the low brick buildings and the sudden fancy flats, past the corner where the cyclist broke his front teeth and still waved at me as if he was the apologizing party.\n\nAt my mother\u2019s, the pelargoniums are doing very well, actually. She has arranged them in pots of mismatched sizes all along the front step. She hears the car and opens the door as if she has been standing behind it, listening for the exact note of my engine. She stands there, and for a second she is so exactly my mother\u2014hair done with the brush that makes it a little too round, cardigan even though it\u2019s too warm, eyes that want to check three things at once\u2014that I feel something pull in my chest. As if all my breath has decided to be a kid again.\n\n\u201cThere he is,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s my star.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m your son,\u201d I say, \u201cwho sometimes sings.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t contradict your mother,\u201d she says, stepping aside. The hallway smells like polish and bacon. Rachel the cat stands in the doorway to the sitting room and looks like she is about to sue.\n\nMum fusses. She has a list of fusses. Tea first and then the sandwiches I made because you won\u2019t have time, and make sure you don\u2019t leave that sweatshirt because it\u2019s getting cooler in the evenings, and what time do you think you\u2019ll get there. I answer. I let the tea burn then cool then burn again. On the sideboard is a photo from the audition\u2014cropped off a screenshot, you can see the play icon at the bottom. My face has an expression like it is surprised its owner could have made that sound. Mum has put it in a frame that once held a picture of me with a cow at a school fair and hasn\u2019t got all of the cow out of the corners.\n\n\u201cDo you remember,\u201d I say, \u201cwhen I sang in the school assembly and Mr Carter said I shouldn't wail?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat man,\u201d says Mum, \u201chad the soul of a wet sock. I wish him all the contentment in the world and never to cross my path again.\u201d\n\nI laugh. It\u2019s a short laugh, like a cough, just because everything in me is so tied to this moment it cannot bear to be distracted. The cat jumps onto my lap as if she has something to tell me and then sits facing away with the air of someone who has decided you will do.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re pale,\u201d Mum says. \u201cEat a biscuit.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had three.\u201d\n\n\u201cEat another,\u201d she says. \u201cFor luck.\u201d\n\nShe gives me a plastic container of lentil soup. \u201cFor the hotel,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019ll be a kettle.\u201d I do not tell her that I do not know if the kettle is kosher for soup. I put it in my bag and the bag looks back at me as if to say, we will leak now, see how you like it. She gives me a scarf that is not mine. She puts a hand on my cheek, cold and small. Her palm is a map of the years she has done washing without a dishwasher.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be scared,\u201d she says. \u201cYou belong to you. Do it how you do it\u2014not how they think you do it. You always did that. As a baby you refused to be born on a Tuesday because you didn\u2019t like the rhyme. Wednesday\u2019s child is full of woe, my bum. You waited til Saturday. After the football.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot true,\u201d I say.\n\n\u201cYou can prove nothing,\u201d she says, and we both grin.\n\nI stand in the hallway with my coat half on and look at her, and I mean to say, when I come back, Sunday roast, and watch old films, and I don\u2019t. I say, \u201cI\u2019ll call when I get to the hotel,\u201d and she says okay and then adds, \u201cbe careful\u2014there\u2019s always idiots,\u201d and I say, \u201cI will,\u201d and then I am on the path going down past the pelargoniums that are, still, very well indeed.\n\nIn the car, for a second I sit with the engine off and my hands on my knees. The street is quiet. A woman across the road is trying to get her toddler into a pushchair and the toddler is doing that boneless thing that makes children suddenly weigh as much as regret. A gull makes a noise like a squeaky gate. I turn the key. The engine catches. The radio does that jumpy click and then sets itself to some station that plays the same four songs. I turn it off. The silence again. I say out loud, like a fool, \u201cHere we go then,\u201d and the car doesn\u2019t answer because cars don\u2019t. I pull out. At the end of the street, a boy on a bike cuts across me and I brake with more abruptness than I mean to, and the boy flips me a V, and his mouth is making the beginning of a laugh. We\u2019re all in our own shows.\n\nIt will be fine. It will be more than fine. It will be exactly what it will be. The motorway will be a long ribbon and my nerves will be a different kind of road and I will follow both and they will take me there. I breathe the way Laura told me\u2014four in, hold, four out, hold\u2014and the breath catches somewhere unclear and then unsticks, and I go.\n\nThere\u2019s a van with a weird sticker\u2014a picture of a baby in sunglasses next to a skull\u2014that hasses me halfway to the junction, and then there isn\u2019t. The sky is a soft white, with the suggestion of blue if you squint. The road hums. I think, absurdly, that I forgot to lock my flat, and then I remember I did, and then I think well, if you didn\u2019t, then perhaps some decent burglar will tidy it in exchange for your DVDs, and then I remember that no one has DVDs anymore. I touch the St Christopher medal where it sits heavy and wrong at my throat. The metal warms against my skin. A feeling sweeps up my arms, like I have scraped them on something and the sting is only an idea.\n\nI wish, suddenly, that I had asked Mum one more time to come. But then she would be anxious on the train, and would forget to bring her reading glasses, and would pretend she is not frightened when she is, and I would be split between two worries like butter on too much toast. Perhaps it is better this way. I can call her after. I can tell her it went well and it went as it did and she will say, I knew that, I told the cat.\n\nOutside Galgate, a smell swirls into the car from nowhere, or the fields\u2014burned sugar and hot tar and the clean wet hay smell you get sometimes even when you know it\u2019s not rained. I wind my window up and down and the air is the same either way. I laugh at myself because it is surely just the sugar factory, nowhere near here, something drifting. It\u2019s a nice smell. It reminds me of my first job at the ice cream parlor, the film that would slick your arms after a shift. The woman who ran it wore a badge that said THERESA and a pin that said IF YOU LIKE ME, LEAVE A TIP.\n\nAt the traffic lights just before the bridge, a man in a fluorescent jacket walks halfway across, looking into the road like it might tell him something. He looks up at me then\u2014or, this is what it feels like\u2014looks past me. His face goes very still, like someone has just slapped him without touching him. He lifts his hand half an inch and then lets it fall. The light goes green. I go.\n\nThis is how it starts and this is not the start. There were starts before. Me as a kid standing on the back of a chair in our living room singing along to a tape of U2 because my mother had a moment for Bono. Me at fourteen realizing that the choir could make smoke come out of your lungs like a train does. Me at seventeen, getting the job at The Blue Otter because I had a smile that made people order puddings they did not want. Me two winters ago, watching the telly glow with other people\u2019s luck, and saying out loud, daft, I could do that, then admitting the daft is sometimes the point.\n\nLondon is a direction. The car eats up the miles like crumbs. A playlist I\u2019ve listened to so often it\u2019s become a landscape. I tell myself not to over-sing on the way and then, at the services, go into the toilets and quietly hum, because you cannot keep a river behind a door. In the mirror above the sinks, my face looks washed out neon. A man two urinals down stares at my side as if I have said his name. I smile, automatic, and then stop because you don\u2019t smile in toilets. Outside, a woman argues on her phone about whether a spaniel should be allowed on the sofa and it\u2019s all I can do not to lean in and say, let the dog on the sofa, people are too precious. I drink water like it will teach my cells something.\n\nBack in the car, a lorry pulls in behind me, its engine making a sound like deep bees. The road opens. The sky darkens then lifts again. I think of the stage. I see it like a rectangle in my mind and I step into it and the audience is an inhale and I am a note before it is sung. My phone vibrates on the passenger seat with a text from Laura: You ok? And then another one, seconds later: Sorry, stupid question. You\u2019ve got this. And then a third: Send me a pic when you get to the toll of the city. I text back a picture of a sign for Stoke-on-Trent because I am a rat and she replies with thirteen crying-laughing faces and a skull and a hand clapping.\n\nSomewhere just south of Stafford, the car makes a noise like a shaken rainstick. It is soft, at first. Something incidental. The road hums, the playlist continues, a man sings about a lost thing he is pretending is a woman. The noise is there when I listen for it and not when I don\u2019t. Then, a minute later, the car coughs. My whole body goes into a hot-cold. I pat the dashboard. I am not that person, but I am. \u201cCome on,\u201d I say. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare.\u201d The car chugs. The acceleration slips like a bar of soap in your hand.\n\nI indicate. I pull onto the hard shoulder. The car dies as if it\u2019s doing me a favour. The world goes very quiet except for a truck that moves past slow and then fast. The wind buffets. The smell is hot plastic and a sweetness like fruit left too long in a bowl. I sit for a second with my hands still on the wheel. It feels like a joke made by a god who enjoys their work too much. That\u2019s unfair. Machines are not malice. They are themselves. The hazard lights tick-tick, a brave little metronome.\n\nI say, out loud, to the empty car, \u201cNo.\u201d\n\nI pull my phone in close, as if it will hear me better if I put my mouth near it. Signal is a polite ghost. One bar. Then none. Then one. I call Laura. It goes to voicemail because she is in bingo\u2019s embrace. I hang up. I call the number on the breakdown card that I put in my wallet because Morris told me to, and the number rings and rings and then a woman answers and asks me to tell her where I am as if she and I both exist in the same frame. I look at the blue signs at the side of the road and the numbers on them could be a code for a lock I will never open. I tell her what I can. She tells me to wait inside the car. I want to argue and say they say don\u2019t sit in the car, sit behind the barrier, that man on the advert always says you\u2019ll die if you sit in the car, but the words go tangled, and she says, \u201cAre you with anyone,\u201d and I say, \u201cNo,\u201d and she says, \u201cKeep your hazards on,\u201d and I say, \u201cOkay,\u201d and then we hang up.\n\nThe air outside the car when I open the door is bigger than air in the car. It shoves at me, or I have not eaten enough. I stand behind the barrier because that is what anyone who loves me would tell me to do. The grass is long. There is a plastic bag caught in it like a little flag of white. The noise of the road is a sizzle and a roar and I think, stupidly and with great clarity, that I have never felt more intensely that I am here. I am here. I am a thing that breathes. I text my mother\u2014Car trouble. Don\u2019t panic. Will sort then get on my way\u2014and I don\u2019t know if it sends. The bar comes and goes like a fish.\n\nCars pass. They are tin animals. I watch the people inside them not because I need to but because my eyes are magnets for faces. A child looks at me long and then opens his mouth wide as if trying to swallow a fly, and his mother swats his hand down without looking. A couple argue, their faces in profile making a hinge. A man taps his fingers on the wheel to a tune I cannot hear and makes a face that might be joy or might be indigestion. I stand and I feel my heart beating in my wrists. It beats in my teeth. It beats everywhere as if it cannot decide where to be.\n\nThe lorry that has been in the middle lane moves in. It becomes a wall. It passes. The wall leaves. The sky is the pale grey of a set of towels you washed with a black sock. The wind licks at the grass at my feet. I think of my song and the way the note in the bridge sits like a swallow on a line. I think of my mother and whether she is making a sandwich and if she will look out at the square of the garden and see the robin that thinks it owns the fence. I think of Laura and the way she will swear kindly when she gets my message. I think of the stage, like a promise written on a long piece of paper.\n\nI put my hand to my throat and my fingers touch the St Christopher. It is warm. It is warmer than the air. A car horn blares somewhere that is not where I am. The road makes its own gutsy music. A smell like hot pennies lifts, then passes. The breakdown truck will come. It is on its way. I am on my way. It will all be in time. There is a quiet at the centre of me where a note waits, calm as a stone in a river. I hold onto that and nothing else. I look at the cars and I cannot tell if, in their windows, they are looking at me or through me. It\u2019s only wind. It\u2019s only noise. It\u2019s only the world taking a deep breath. I take one too, and let it out slowly, very slowly, as if doing it right might teach the day how to behave.",

The man who climbs out is tall and weathered, wearing a jacket with reflective strips that look like someone stuck puzzle pieces to him in a hurry. He moves with the efficient calm of people who spend their days rescuing bad luck and therefore cannot afford panic. He lifts a hand in a hello that is more of a hello to the whole situation than to me. When he speaks, his voice has the flattened music of the Midlands.\n\n\u201cAll right, mate?\u201d he says. \u201cYou done the right thing, standing back.\u201d He looks at the car like a farmer looks at a calf with a limp, not cruel, just resigned. \u201cShe cough on you?\u201d\n\n\u201cShuddered,\u201d I say. \u201cThen died like a Victorian heroine. It\u2019s a loaner. I did nothing to deserve her.\u201d\n\nHe smiles, quick and small. \u201cThey always say that,\u201d he says. \u201cName\u2019s Manu. Let\u2019s see what we can do.\u201d\n\nFrom the other side of the barrier, I watch him pop the bonnet and lean in. He is one of those people who becomes briefly intimate with whatever he touches, and I am weirdly comforted by the way his hands cradle the engine as if it might confid e in him if he gives it room. Traffic slides by in gusts. A crisp packet lifts and settles, lifts and settles. Manu peers, fiddles, taps. He speaks to the car in a voice both chastising and encouraging. The hazard lights tick-tick in their brave rhythm. I imagine them as the click of a metronome before a song I haven\u2019t practised enough, and my throat does its little pre-performance tighten and then release because there is no stage here and no audience, just a man and a machine and a morning that has veered slightly left of plan.\n\n\u201cFuel?\u201d he asks without looking up.\n\n\u201cEnough,\u201d I say. \u201cI topped up at Forton. The man at the counter tried to sell me a loyalty card. I told him I was committed to nothing.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d he says, and I get the sense he appreciates a customer who makes him laugh at least in theory. \u201cCoil pack,\u201d he says after another thirty seconds. \u201cMaybe. Could be the HT leads. Old ones go like liquorice. I can get you as far as the services and do a swap. Not a full fix, but it\u2019ll give you a run.\u201d\n\nRelief sweeps up so suddenly I feel slightly light-headed with it. \u201cI\u2019m meant to be in London by this evening,\u201d I say, and I hear how futile that sounds, as if London is a person I\u2019m standing up and needs a reason.\n\n\u201cAren\u2019t we all,\u201d he says gently. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. We\u2019ll get you moving.\u201d\n\nHe hitches the car, guides me into the cab. It smells of coffee and damp maps. There\u2019s a pink stuffed pig hanging from the rearview with a faded ribbon tied around its neck. He notices me noticing and says, \u201cMy daughter. Hates pigs, oddly. Leaves me this to remind me of that. Love\u2019s a funny old thing.\u201d\n\nWe rumble to the services, big lit letters promising burgers and clean toilets and a place to stretch a back that didn\u2019t used to ache. He finds a space near the far fence and slides out. The wind here is less of a slap and more of a constant bicker. In the minuscule lull between gusts, the sounds of other people trying to keep their lives on track fill in: laughter that isn\u2019t for you, a clatter of a tray on a table, the squeak of a trainer sole. Mammon, modern. Manu opens his boot and reveals an ordered array of tools and boxes I would not know what to do with even if someone pointed them at me and said, go on then. He moves with the ease of someone who has lifted the same lid a hundred times and still takes a second to like the way the hinges sound.\n\nWhile he works, I phone Laura, who this time picks up on the second ring like I\u2019ve interrupted her mid-shout.\n\n\u201cTell me you\u2019re not phoning to say you\u2019re turning back,\u201d she says, and then, before I can answer, \u201cTell me where you are and tell me your exact blood sugar.\u201d\n\n\u201cServices,\u201d I say. \u201cManu is being a saint with better tools. My blood sugar is fine and also composed of crisps. Don\u2019t tell Shaz.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re getting a pie,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd a bottle of water that costs eight quid and a woman in a fleece who calls you sweetheart without quite meaning it. And you are texting me a picture of your actual face in five minutes so I can assess whether your smile is lying.\u201d\n\n\u201cBossy,\u201d I say.\n\n\u201cEffective,\u201d she says. \u201cGo on.\u201d\n\nI hang up and think about my face and whether it is telling the truth. When I catch my reflection in the dark window of Manu\u2019s truck, it shows me a version of myself that looks like the one on telly but also like the boy who\u2019s tried to charm free puddings with a smile and has only learned the art in the places where it didn\u2019t work. My eyes look a shade lighter in this light. Perhaps that\u2019s hope. Perhaps it\u2019s the weird services neon.\n\nBy the time I\u2019ve bought a pie and water\u2014served by a woman in a fleece who does call me sweetheart with the complicated warmth of someone who has no more warmth to spare\u2014Manu has the coil pack in his hand. He shows it to me as if I might like to admire its wrongness. The rubber has gone soft in a way that makes my fingertips itch to not touch it.\n\n\u201cSee,\u201d he says. \u201cBit perished. Life, eh? Give me fifteen minutes and you\u2019ll be singing again.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not singing in the car,\u201d I say.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re lying to me,\u201d he says without malice.\n\nHe works, quick but not sloppy, and while he does, a child stops three paces from us and stares at me as if I am a good joke he has forgotten the punchline to. He\u2019s maybe seven, with hair cut square by someone who loves him enough to be brave. He tugs at his mother\u2019s sleeve. The mother looks, then looks harder, and a face I know too well blooms on hers\u2014the careful expression of someone trying to decide if they recognize a person they\u2019ve only ever seen contained in a glowing frame. The boy saves her the awkwardness.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re the telly man,\u201d he says, voice clear, generous. \u201cThe singing waiter.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am,\u201d I say, and watch how this pronoun nudges my day into a slightly different lane. \u201cI\u2019m off-duty at the minute. Letting him do the heavy lifting.\u201d\n\nThe boy nods, taking this as fair. \u201cMy dad says if you learn to sing proper you get free puddings.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour dad knows,\u201d I say solemnly. \u201cIt\u2019s a documented phenomenon.\u201d\n\nThe mother smiles, apologetic for her son\u2019s lack of boundaries without really being sorry. \u201cGood luck,\u201d she says. \u201cWe were shouting. My husband cried.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll deny it,\u201d I say.\n\n\u201cHe already does,\u201d she says. \u201cHe says it was hay fever. In March.\u201d\n\nWe grin at each other in that complicated way that strangers do when they\u2019ve shared nothing and somehow something. The boy waves like a windmill, then is whooshed away by the onwardness of their day, and for a second the services feels like a nice place to be marooned: humanity at its least curated, all these people unpeeling the sticky film from pastries as if that is the hardest thing they\u2019ve done all week.\n\nManu straightens and wipes his hands on a rag that looks like it was once a t-shirt someone loved. \u201cRight then,\u201d he says. \u201cTry her.\u201d\n\nShe catches. There is a relieved purr that sounds like a sigh being put into gear. Manu listens, head tilted. \u201cShe\u2019ll do,\u201d he says. \u201cTake it easy, don\u2019t thrash her, she\u2019s an old lady. Keep it at sixty-five and she won\u2019t sulk.\u201d\n\n\u201cBless you,\u201d I say, and I mean it enough that my voice goes a little weird around the blessing. \u201cWhat do I owe you?\u201d\n\nHe gives me a number that doesn\u2019t make me die and I give him a thanks that probably makes him uncomfortable, and he shrugs it off like a man used to people being a bit too grateful because otherwise they\u2019d be screaming. He taps the St Christopher at my throat with a knuckle, quick as a second hand. \u201cHe\u2019s got work to do today,\u201d he says, and I cannot tell if he\u2019s joking.\n\nBack on the motorway, every sound is suspect for a while. A rattle is a harbinger. A hum is a hymn. I pull into the left lane like it\u2019s my rightful home and the car, sainted for the moment, behaves itself as if flattered by the attention. I text Laura the requested photo of my face looking smug with a background of a sign that says Welcome Break as if I am advertising the concept. She replies with a string of thumbs and then a voice note of her singing an off-key fanfare that makes me laugh so hard my chest loosens. I text Mum a more measured update\u2014On my way\u2014 and she replies with five rocket emojis and a frying pan, which I choose to read as her trying to say go, and also eat.\n\nThe miles roll under me and London is not yet a city but a suggestion, an increase in lane numbers, a tone shift in the way the adverts shout. I hit the ring road. The traffic becomes more of a conversation and less of a queue. The skyline arranges itself like someone very carefully placing shiniest rocks at the edge of a pond. I feel that little sideways pull you get when you\u2019ve spent a long time in a place and are now entering the territory where you once only had pretend versions of yourself. It\u2019s not quite jealousy. It\u2019s not quite fear. It\u2019s a nudge that says: are you ready to be the person you have told stories about.\n\nThe hotel is a rectangle with opinions about glass. It is near enough to the studios that I could, if I had to, run and arrive sweating, which feels like a lifesaver and also a threat. In the lobby, everything is beige in a way that signals expense. A woman behind the desk wears a smile like good cutlery. She has the patient eyes of someone who has seen a lot of people arrive who think the hotel is an answer to a question that is nothing to do with beds.\n\n\u201cWelcome,\u201d she says, looking at her screen more than at me. \u201cName?\u201d\n\n\u201cJacob Hargreaves,\u201d I say, and she reads the list like it might spoil if she opens it too long. A small pause, then a nod.\n\n\u201cAh,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019re with the show. We\u2019ve got you on the fourth floor. Breakfast is until ten. There\u2019s a spa but it\u2019s being painted. Don\u2019t wear your badges past the bistro. Some guests get\u2026 overenthusiastic.\u201d\n\nShe hands me a key card with a smile that acknowledges the world on the other side of this door and does not engage with it. I take the lift up, my suitcase making a noise like a bored child over the carpet. In the room the air is conditioned to rich people\u2019s preferences. The window looks out over a slice of city that includes scaffolding and a church spire and a patch of trees that manage to look both valiant and a bit put-upon. I put the St Christopher on the bedside table and it looks too bright there, so I put it back on, because I am ridiculous. I make tea in a tiny kettle that would struggle to boil a thought. I pour Mum\u2019s lentil soup into the mug that says BEST DAD and it makes a dark honest smell that tugs at somewhere behind my ribs.\n\nThe email itinerary crinkles every time I touch it as if trying to warn me that my future time is not my own. Call sheet says: Thursday, sign-in at nine, wardrobe consult, vocal warm-up, band call, staging, tech, press. Don\u2019t be late, is written twice in different fonts, which is either professionalism or a cry for help. There is a map to a door marked Stage Door that will in real life be no such thing, but you have to call something something.\n\nSleep lurks. It lurks in the corner of the room like a friend you owe a drink to and are pretending not to see because you have too much to do. I shower instead and the water makes that small thin roar that hotel showers do, as if they are taking this personally. When I get out, a message from Gemma is sitting in my phone like a neat parcel: Hope the drive was manageable. See you bright and early. Let us know if you need anything. Evidence suggests this means let us know if you need to show up in two places at once and we\u2019ll tell you to pick one. I reply with a polite thank you and nothing else because I cannot ask it for anything that matters.\n\nNight in a new bed is a funny animal. It sniffs your edges and decides how to lie on you. I turn the pillow over and over as if there\u2019s a right way up. The window hums. Somewhere in the wall a pipe makes a click like a nervous throat. I close my eyes and instantly open them, because my head does that thing where it reminds me, cleverly, of every single thing that could go wrong. Forget the words. Drop your breath. Catch your breath and don\u2019t be able to let it out. The mic cut. The band speeding up while you slow down. Your mother missing the beginning because Freeview decides to update at the exact moment the show starts. I breathe and count and the numbers aren\u2019t big enough, and eventually I take Laura\u2019s text out again\u2014You\u2019ve got this, you idiot\u2014and hold it against my chest as if it can do the job of both a hot water bottle and a mantra.\n\nIn the morning, the city is different. The light makes dust honest. The air coming through the small gap in the window tastes like tyre and ambition. I put on a shirt and then another shirt and settle on the white one because it is honest even when it is lying. In the lift, a man with very white teeth and a small dog that looks like it could be digitally erased if needed says, \u201cBig day?\u201d as if he knows all days are big to someone. I make agreeable noises. The dog looks over my shoulder and then at my knees, interested in neither.\n\nOutside the studio, there is a bustle that is its own weather. People with headsets are communicating with invisible gods. A man carries an armful of fake flowers like he\u2019s bribing a meadow. A kid in an enormous hoodie is juggling because he can, because why not, because juggling is the sort of show-off skill that looks better in car parks. I stand for a second and watch the doors gulp people in, swallow them, and then belch out more people who look exactly the same but are different. I pin my pass to my shirt and it feels like putting on a name I have to earn.\n\n\u201cJake!\u201d calls a voice, bright as aluminium. It is Gemma, in black jeans and a black t-shirt that will never attract attention, by design. She has the glow of someone who, immediately before this moment, was in six other moments. \u201cYou made it. Good. Follow me, love.\u201d\n\nShe pours me through corridors the way you pour batter into a tin\u2014neat, efficient, confident someone else will handle the heat. We pass a wall of framed posters of shows that involve a lot of clapping. We pass a table with bowls of fruit that look too clean to be eaten by humans. We pass a man in a headset muttering, \u201cNo, I said the blue drape, I said the blue,\u201d and a woman in a floaty dress practicing looking surprised in a mirror, over and over, in a way that is either craft or prophecy.\n\nWardrobe is a room with too much mirror. The light makes a pleasant enemy of everyone. A woman with tape around her wrist like a bracelet and pins in her mouth smiles with her eyes. \u201cJacob,\u201d she says through the pins. \u201cRight. We\u2019ve got two options for you. Shirt you in or shirt you out. You\u2019re a shirt-in man, I think. We\u2019ll try both anyway. Arms up.\u201d\n\nArms up. The ritual. I do what I\u2019m told, and there is a comfort in it. The shirt they give me is nicer than my nicest. It has that weight that says it will sanction your behaviour. I stand still and let them tuck me into a version of myself that will read better in harsh light. They talk around me and over me and occasionally to me, and it is not unkind, it\u2019s just the way it is when the outfit is the thing and the body is the hanger. They ask me about jewellery and I say St Christopher and they say we can tuck that under, sweetheart, if it flashes we\u2019ll get letters. I nod and tuck. He warms against my skin, indignant.\n\nVocal warm-up happens in a room that once was a rehearsal studio and is now a room where people try not to be sick. The walls are a forgiving grey. There are bottles of lukewarm water lined up like a small army. The vocal coach is a woman with a perfect bun and the sort of gaze that could keep boats off rocks. She makes us do the exercises that make everyone sound ridiculous in a way that has a logic that\u2019s older than embarrassed. I lip trill enough to make my face hum. I do the sirens, I do the me-me-mes, I do the yawns that remind your throat it is a flexible creature, and the room softens around all of it like a hand around a fruit you do not want to bruise.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t oversing in rehearsal,\u201d she says, as if she\u2019s known me all my life. \u201cGuard the instrument. Give me seventy percent now, a hundred tomorrow. Stand tall. You drop your shoulder when you hit the swell. Let the breath sit low. All right?\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right,\u201d I say, and the words feel like a promise to someone else and to myself.\n\nBand call is a different animal. The MD is thin and intense, like the first line of a poem. He has a pencil behind his ear and a precision that makes you want to stand up straighter before you even make a sound. We run the first verse and he nods like a metronome. We hit the bridge and he lifts a hand like a conductor and says, \u201cThere, sit back. Let it float a bar longer. We\u2019re with you if you don\u2019t panic.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t panic,\u201d I say, and of course I do, and he knows, and we both pretend that\u2019s not true for the next ten minutes and then it sort of becomes true.\n\nOn a break, I end up leaning against a wall with a man who has a deck of cards in his hands like it\u2019s an animal he\u2019s tamed and could go wild at any second. He is perhaps twenty-two and has the kind of face that looks smooth at a distance and complicated up close. His fingers are indeed ridiculous. They eat cards and produce them and shuffle them into thin air and back. He glances at me with a little half-smirk that says he is used to people being impressed and has learned to act as if he is not.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re the guy from Lancaster,\u201d he says. \u201cThe waiter who isn\u2019t a waiter.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am a waiter,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019m many things. You\u2019re the Preston kid with fingers that are not following the rules.\u201d\n\nHe grins. \u201cKai,\u201d he says, and I tell him my name, and for a second we are two lads from not-London who are about to be made into content. He does a thing with three cards that makes no sense to me and then palms a coin behind my ear only to produce it again from the sleeve of my jacket, and I feel like a child, delighted and furious and wanting the trick and not the explanation.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in the same show,\u201d he says, twiddling. \u201cGood to have a northerner in the last half. We reduce the vowels.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe do,\u201d I say. \u201cWe also lower the temperature of the room by three degrees by standing in it.\u201d\n\n\u201cFair,\u201d he says. He glances past me, then at me, and for a moment that off feeling does a small dance at the back of my neck. The air flickers around the overhead lights. Kai frowns and shakes his head as if trying to get water out of his ear. \u201cIt\u2019s always like this in here,\u201d he mutters. \u201cLike the building remembers other shows and is trying to run them at the same time.\u201d\n\nStaging is a polite way of saying: here is the rectangle you will be allowed to be in; try not to do anything you do in your kitchen at 2 a.m. There are marks on the floor in tape of different colours, and my name written on one in a black felt pen that has bled a little. It occurs to me that this is the first time I have seen my name on a floor that wasn\u2019t to do with spillages. The stage manager, Del, is the man with the headset I imagined, with a voice like a safety briefing delivered by a friend. He calls, \u201cPlaces, please,\u201d in a tone that makes you want to impress him. He talks us through our bits like we are complicated machines he\u2019s been given five minutes to learn. When I step onto my mark, the lights lift just enough that I can see the negative space where an audience will be. It is always the strangest feeling: singing into the idea of people before the people are there. Like a promise, or a dare.\n\nWe run my entrance. We run the first verse. We run the bridge. The band swells and the room swells and then, just as I go to sit back into the space the MD gave me, the right-most light flickers, the sound in the monitor cuts, returns, and the tiniest shimmer of that corridor-from-a-dream feeling washes over me. It is gone before I can hold it. It leaves behind the ghost of the goosebumps I had about it. Del\u2019s voice is already on it, pragmatic, unruffled.\n\n\u201cLight four just threw a strop,\u201d he says into his mic. \u201cIt\u2019s all right, keep going, keep it moving, love. We\u2019ll fix that. Electricians, you\u2019re on it.\u201d\n\nWe keep going. We always keep going. The swallow of the note sits on the line where it should. I trust that the floor will continue to be floor beneath me. The MD nods once. It is ridiculous how much a single nod can make you feel like you belong in your own body.\n\nPress is the bit I dread and it turns out to be like being fed biscuits by three aunts who all say they only want a nibble. A kind girl with a tablet asks me questions that are variations of how does it feel and what would you say to your younger self and who would you like to collaborate with, and I answer them in sentences that are honest and a little rehearsed. I think of my mother, tuning in to a clip later perhaps, hearing my voice doing its best to not make a fool of us both, and I smile in a way that is not completely put on. At the end, the girl says, \u201cMy nan loves you,\u201d and I don\u2019t know what to say that isn\u2019t weird, so I say, \u201cYour nan has excellent taste,\u201d and hope her nan has a sense of humour.\n\nAt lunch\u2014which is rice in a compostable box and chicken that has been made decent by a sauce that tastes like someone thought about it\u2014Kai sits across from me and shows me the edge of a trick. He explains the falseness of one move in a way that makes me ache in a place that words don\u2019t help. He says, \u201cYou know, it\u2019s all angles. You don\u2019t hide it, not really. You just show something else with your shoulders while your hands tell a lie. People want to believe the story they\u2019ve already chosen.\u201d\n\n\u201cI sing a note like it\u2019s harder than it is,\u201d I say. \u201cIt\u2019s not the same, but it is.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is the same,\u201d he says, and then he licks sauce off his thumb in a way that is so childlike it makes me want to remind us both to stay. His phone buzzes and he looks at it as if it has said his name in an accusatory tone. \u201cMum,\u201d he says fondly, then grimaces. \u201cShe wants me to wear a different jacket. She thinks the one I brought makes me look like a small-time gangster.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat does the other one make you look like?\u201d\n\n\u201cA bigger time gangster,\u201d he says, and we both laugh and somehow in that moment I feel less alone.\n\nThe afternoon is long in the way afternoons are when they are full of things you love that also make you want to throw up. We run it again. We tweak a word. The MD moves a bar line. A woman with nails like tiny shields writes my name on a clipboard three times. I am fed three more bottles of water than a person deserves and pee so often I begin to suspect it\u2019s a hobby. Every now and then, that thin ripple in the air slides around the edges of my vision and I blink and it\u2019s gone. Once, near the end of the day, I\u2019m walking past a door marked NO ENTRY and it opens an inch with a sigh on no hinge. I see into a darkness that is full of the shapes of chairs. It looks, for a second, like a row of people have stood to leave and left their shadows sitting. I close it with my foot because I do not have the energy for metaphor.\n\nBack at the hotel, the hallway carpet smells like new glue and something enveloping. My room is exactly as I left it and, for an embarrassing second, that makes me emotional. It is a relief when nothing moves when you\u2019ve been pulled through a day like beads on someone else\u2019s string. I sit on the edge of the bed and put my head in my hands not because anything is wrong but because it is heavy. After a minute, my phone makes the small polite noise that means text and I look.\n\nFrom Mum: I have moved the blue vase onto the other table and it looks wrong but right. Your Auntie Lila says if you go on last she will be in bed. We love you. Eat your soup.\n\nI send her a picture of the soup halfway eaten, steam still lifting, the mug ridiculous and perfect. I call her and she answers on the second ring, a small triumph in a day of bigger ones. She tells me the quiz on the radio was about flags and she knew more than she thought. I tell her about the MD\u2019s pencil. She tells me Rachel the cat knocked over the tv remote and turned the sound up to thirty and sat there like a queen. I tell her the lights misbehaved and she says, \u201cSometimes they do that. Tell them to stop it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be all right,\u201d she adds, voice sudden in its quiet sincerity. \u201cYou\u2019re good at being you in a room. They can\u2019t stop you doing that.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks,\u201d I say. \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 that\u2019s the best job description I\u2019ve ever had.\u201d\n\nI call Laura and she is on a bus, her voice chest-high, laughing because a man has just tripped over nothing and then gotten so offended at the nothing he swore at it. \u201cI knew you\u2019d make it through a day of being handled,\u201d she says. \u201cYou were always good with a busy Christmas. Now, when they make you sing it half a tone lower because telly panics, you tell them to do one.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey only tried a quarter tone,\u201d I say. \u201cI fought it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere he is,\u201d she says. \u201cOur tiny rebel. Get some sleep. Dream of good things. Dream of us all at The Otter watching you and pretending not to cry, because if Shaz starts she\u2019ll never stop.\u201d\n\nWe say good night and I stand for a bit at the window. The city is lit like a diagram. In a narrow office opposite, a woman sits at a desk with her head on her arms and the light on. For a long minute, she doesn\u2019t move, and I watch her as if we\u2019ve agreed this is a fair exchange. When she finally lifts her head, she rubs her eyes, switches the light off, and the rectangle goes dark. The church spire is a point against a low cloud. Somewhere, a siren wails and then decides against it. I go to bed. I do not tell my heart it\u2019s allowed to be excited, but I stop telling it to behave.\n\nI wake at three with the feeling that someone has said my name. It sits in the air like breath you can see. The street lights make two parallel lines on the ceiling and for a second, in their shape, I see a face, a long one, looking down, as if the light itself is curious. I think of that dog on the quay and the boy in the car and the woman crossing the road who looked past me like I was a gap. I put my palm flat on my chest. My heart answers back: present. I don\u2019t sleep for a while. I have a small conversation with myself about how ridiculous I am being. Eventually the conversation becomes a dream where I am walking down a corridor with many doors and each one has a different version of my name written on it and none of them are Jake. When I wake, the white stripe on my knee is back and the morning makes everything believably ordinary again.\n\nCall time. Coffee I don\u2019t need and toast I misjudge. The hotel lifts are full of people who smell faintly of hairspray and determination. I check my bag seventeen times and then a twentieth. On my way out, the woman at the desk gives me a nod that says: I don\u2019t know you, but tonight I will say that I did. Outside, the air is sharp with a number I associate with early maths. The studios swallow me with the practised ease of a whale. Inside there is a buzz that has edges. People are speaking faster than yesterday. The man in the headset is holding two clipboards and the same amount of professionalism. Gemma appears, a small whirlwind. She puts a hand on my shoulder and squeezes in a way that feels like permission.\n\n\u201cMorning,\u201d she says. \u201cYou look well. How\u2019s the car?\u201d\n\n\u201cAlive,\u201d I say. \u201cI owe a man my life and a coil pack.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe all owe a man our life and a coil pack,\u201d she says, and for a second she isn\u2019t a person whose job is to hold a day together but just a person, and I like her more.\n\nThey move us like chess pieces. The run is tighter today, the pauses filled with warmth that is not warmth but can be used as such. Photographers bloom out of corners like mushrooms after rain. I answer a question I\u2019ve answered eight times with a slightly different cadence. A woman with a spray bottle mists me with something that smells like cucumber and triumph. I find Del and he winks at me in a way that is dad and mate and sea captain. He points at my chest, where the St Christopher sits under the shirt like a small impatience.\n\n\u201cKeep it tucked,\u201d he says. \u201cNot because I\u2019m worried about letters. Because if you ever lose it, you\u2019ll blame me, and I cannot carry that kind of narrative.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would never blame you,\u201d I say, and then make a face to indicate this is a lie. He cackles respectfully.\n\nBackstage in the wings there is a feeling like standing on a cliff edge you have chosen. The audience is a dark body made of individual lights. A man is telling jokes into a microphone in the sort of voice that makes jokes behave. A stagehand in black nods to me once, very seriously, the way you nod to someone you are handing a parachute to. Kai passes by, touches my elbow, does not break his own concentration bubble. I watch him disappear and then reappear in a square of light like a fish crossing a patch of sun in a pond. He flourishes. The roar tells me the room is willing.\n\nFive minutes. Two. One. This is the part where fear and love hold hands. I tie my shoelace for no reason. I make the knot the way my mother taught me and whisper, let them see you, let them see you, let them see you, and the third one turns into, let me see me. Del is at my shoulder with the half-second nod that means go, and the air changes temperature as I step forward. The light picks me up and the room does the thing rooms do where they become one eye. I take my breath and I let it out, and the first note sits where it should, not because I force it there but because it wants to. The world narrows and expands at once. The band is a living thing behind me. The words that have been living in my mouth all these years come out and do their neat little dances.\n\nIn the bridge, the one the MD told me to float, I feel that shimmer again\u2014a flicker at the edge of the light, a cool on the back of my neck, like a corridor opening for a second and then closing. I hold on to the note not tighter but truer. I let it pass through and it does, like a weather front, and then is gone. The light settles. The sound is sound again and not just electricity pretending to be it. I think of the river back home and the way the sun sits in its buckle and how everything is a reflection and a real thing at once. The last note blooms. The room stands up. They stand up.\n\nAfter, in the few seconds where you are still inside the rectangle but the rectangle has stopped being a secret, I taste salt in my mouth and do not know if it\u2019s sweat or the way joy has a taste when it\u2019s honest. The applause is a storm and I am somehow both inside it and not. I see, in the second row, a woman who looks almost like my mother\u2014but is not, of course not\u2014and she has her hand over her mouth like people do in old films when the train pulls in. Somewhere in the noise, I can hear one person\u2019s laugh that sounds like Laura\u2019s and I know she\u2019s not here, she\u2019s at The Otter, shouting and pretending not to, and the thought lands so squarely I almost tilt. I bow in the way they told me, not too low, not too long, respectful of everyone including myself.\n\nOffstage, Gemma grabs my arm and says some words that my ears will only catch in ten minutes. Del squeezes my shoulder in a way that registers as the thing my dad might have done in a universe where he knew how. Kai yelps something delighted as he is being interviewed and sends a thumbs up with his eyes at me. A runner presses a bottle of water into my hand and I drink and it tastes like water always has when it is doing its job.\n\nBack in the corridor, where the carpet is pretending to be a grander carpet, I find a corner of wall and lean on it. I breathe the four in, four hold, four out, four hold with the fierce devotion of the newly religious. My phone is waiting in the little tray with my name on it like a pet that wants your attention the very second you\u2019re home. There is a message from Mum that simply says, Oh my heart, and another that says, the cat walked in front of the telly during the last bit and I told her you were busy, and a final one that says, are you having a biscuit and if not why not. There is a photo from Laura of the pub, full, the cardboard star on the espresso machine tilted, Shaz with hands over her face, Morris looking like a man pretending he isn\u2019t wiping his eye with his wrist. My name is written in lipstick on someone\u2019s arm.\n\nI stand there and the building hums around me and I think, absurdly and correctly, that this is one of those little shelves in a life you stand and look at for a second and then carry on. I tuck the St Christopher back under my shirt because he has climbed out on his own. I wipe my face with my sleeve. I try to think of what comes next and that is the strange part: you cannot. It comes next anyway.\n\nAnd then, just as I\u2019m about to go back to the dressing room and let other people worry about whether the shirt creased, a man I don\u2019t know, wearing a lanyard that gives him permission to be everywhere, walks past, stops, frowns at the air to the left of me in a way I recognize now, that peculiar double-take as if someone has just said his name from a cupboard. He blinks, shakes himself, and carries on. The fluorescent light above us does a small discreet quiver. In the far-off, a kettle clicks. I am very present. I am the opposite of a ghost. I am a note that has found the room it was waiting for. I stand up straight. I go.",

There\u2019s a breeze fat with damp and iron, the sort that wets your lips without asking. I stand on the quay and hold a paper cup of coffee that is too hot at the rim and too tepid at the middle and feel the post-city hum loosen in me. London hangs in your ears for a bit after you leave it. It makes small beeps in your head for a lift that isn\u2019t there, it gives you phantom footsteps, it makes you stand a little wider as if you\u2019re expecting to be jostled. Here, gulls heckle and a bus misjudges its own tiredness and huffs past and an old man in a cap I\u2019ve seen on him since I was twelve lifts two fingers in greeting and then forgets he\u2019s done it and does it again. Home sits down right beside you without asking who you think you are.\n\nI have been away and I have not. I have gone and sung under a light that could have cooked a small casserole and I have returned with my own face, which seems unfairly the same. The show threw me like a stone and the splash was big and then the ripples kept going and then, weirdly, there was still me and a kitchen and a bin that needed taking out. I am both sick to death and starving for the subject of what happened, because telling and not telling are the two appetites we keep feeding and neither is ever full. People stop me and do that face\u2014radiant and cautious\u2014with questions that begin with \u201cso\u2026\u201d and I answer them with the measured joy of a person very aware that his life could at any moment slip on a wet aisle and land on its arse.\n\nThe Blue Otter put out a chalkboard that says WELCOME HOME, JAKE in a hand that looks like Shaz told a child to go wild and then tidied it after. There are balloons that should not be balloons at all\u2014one is a football that has been repurposed with a Sharpie and love\u2014and someone has taped a paper star to the hand dryer in the gents that says PLEASE DO NOT SING INTO THIS. Inside, the lights do their fuggy afternoon thing where everything has a peel of gold on it even though outside is grey. The regulars move their bodies out of my way like the river shifts round boats. Shaz pretends I don\u2019t exist for a whole minute, lining up pint glasses like soldiers on inspection, and then she looks up and says, \u201cAll right, you\u2019ve had your fun,\u201d and the hug she gives me is full-armed and perfumed and her bangles knock against my back like little cymbals.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been on television,\u201d says Morris, as if I might not have noticed. \u201cI watched you on me phone after my niece texted me four crying faces and a fish.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou watch everything on your phone,\u201d I say. He grips my shoulders in his big hands and examines me like I might have cracked in transit. He has a tea towel over his shoulder that says KISS THE COOK and he looks like he could bite a cloud and get nutrients.\n\nLaura comes at me sideways, because she\u2019s on a tray run, and breasts me like a friendly sheep and says, \u201cTry to be normal,\u201d into my ear with such ferocity that it makes me laugh, which is what she was aiming for. She looks tired in a way that makes her eyes brighter. There are small glitter dots at her hairline, unexplained. She winks, which means there\u2019s a story and I\u2019m going to have to pry it out with a butter knife later.\n\nBy the coffee machine, someone has propped up a photo that is the unflattering freeze-frame of my mouth mid-bridge. Underneath, in a pen that is trying to be brave against the laminated sign about allergens, someone has written: WE KNEW HIM WHEN HE COULDN\u2019T REACH THE TOP SHELF. Customers do the exaggerated glances that constitute respect for a person who is picking up cutlery while being a small bit famous. I carry a stack of plates to table seven and the woman in the cardigan with the soft bob\u2014she gave me the St Christopher\u2014touches her own throat reflexively when she sees me and says, \u201cWe screamed until the cat left the room,\u201d and I say, \u201cI\u2019m sorry for your cat,\u201d and she says, \u201cHe\u2019ll return to us in time,\u201d and we share that little piece of church where we decide things will work out because we have agreed they will.\n\nNews finds you even if you pretend you\u2019re a hedgehog. There are emails that say words like opportunity and synergy and a phone that rings with numbers that start with 020 and smile at you in an expensive way. A man called Conrad leaves a message with a voice so smooth it could butter bread, offering management services and a belief in me that sounds portable. A woman from a morning show wants me to come and look pleasantly surprised on a sofa. There\u2019s a message from Gemma about the possibility of a charity gala, black tie if I have it and they can lend if I don\u2019t. I thumb each thing and feel the reality of it the way you feel the weight of coins through your pocket lining. The temptation to just say yes to everything because it is the proof that something happened is loud. The part of me that ties knots and says let them see you says, keep a shape, love, don\u2019t thin yourself to water.\n\nWhat keeps belling inside all this is the small off-notes, like a dangling fork in a drawer you can\u2019t quite push closed. It isn\u2019t only lights. It isn\u2019t only that corridor feeling that sits on the corner of my eye and then behaves. People still do that tiny double-take that looks like a draft. The dog outside the chemist this morning tilted its head and whined at a point exactly to the left of me and then wagged its tail as if put at ease by some silent assurance. A woman I know only by the set of her shoulders passed me at the market and whispered \u201cthere you are\u201d with relief, but her gaze was pointed at my pocket. When I caught her eye to return the courtesy, she startled, apologised to nothing, and hurried on. It would be easy to pack this all up into the box labelled You Are Overtired and slap the lid on, and perhaps that is what I\u2019m doing when I choose not to tell anyone because curiosity is sometimes just wanting your weird to be shared.\n\nIt\u2019s early evening at The Otter when my phone goes with the kind of ring I have mentally shelved as family. The screen shows Dad, which is a ridiculous name for the contact because the contact is a number, not a person, and yet there it is: DAD. Laura\u2019s eyebrows climb into her fringe when she clocks the name. I take the call outside, because there is a dignity to be had in having a conversation under a sky rather than under a sign that says PLEASE ASK AT THE BAR FOR KETCHUP.\n\n\u201cHello,\u201d I say, and I sound like a person calling a doctor.\n\nThere\u2019s a breath, a small cough, a masculine clearing that isn\u2019t unkind so much as habitual. \u201cJacob,\u201d he says, and the sound of his voice empties a drawer I didn\u2019t know I\u2019d crammed full. \u201cAll right, lad?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m all right,\u201d I say. \u201cAre you\u2014?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not dead,\u201d he says, which is the sort of joke a man makes when he means to be tender and can\u2019t find the shoelace end. There\u2019s a dog bark, big-chested, and a woman\u2019s voice in the background saying, \u201cSoup, leave it,\u201d which is such a dumb name for an animal it makes my eyes prickle because it is ours. \u201cWe saw you,\u201d he says. \u201cOn the telly.\u201d\n\n\u201cEveryone did,\u201d I say, and I hear the sulk in it and fold it away quick. \u201cI mean\u2014thank you.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou were good,\u201d he says, blunt as a spade hitting the ground. \u201cYou looked like you knew what you were about. Mandy cried. I\u2014didn\u2019t. Got a bit of\u2026 hay fever.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn March,\u201d I say. I can feel the grin even as I hear the ache behind it.\n\n\u201cAye,\u201d he says. \u201cWeather\u2019s mad. Your mother\u2019ll be made up.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe was proud,\u201d I say, and, because the door\u2019s ajar, because sometimes you can be brave for four seconds, I add, \u201cShe\u2019d like it if you phoned her.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a little quiet. I can hear the sort of quiet that contains furniture. He clears his throat again. \u201cWe don\u2019t\u2014\u201d he begins, and leaves it. \u201cI\u2019ll send you something,\u201d he says instead, which is his language for love, for sorry, for the afternoon he forgot to pick me up from football and turned his phone off for five hours and then looked like a broken candlestick when he arrived. \u201cFor shoes or whatever it is you lot wear in London.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got shoes,\u201d I say. \u201cI could do with a decent microphone. For maybe\u2026 later. If I do this properly.\u201d\n\nHe makes a noise that could be approval or could be a door squeak. \u201cRight,\u201d he says. \u201cDo it properly. Don\u2019t let \u2018em make you daft. If they tell you to fall over, stand up.\u201d Soup barks again, a nonsense comment. \u201cI\u2019ll, ah, I\u2019ll not keep you. You\u2019re popular.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot here,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019m mostly in charge of cutlery.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s honest work,\u201d he says. There is a shuffle like he is going to hang up and then he doesn\u2019t. \u201cJacob,\u201d he says, and I can hear him chewing something that isn\u2019t food. \u201cProud.\u201d\n\nIt lands. It doesn\u2019t capsize me. It does a rearranging at the level of bone. \u201cThanks,\u201d I say, and there are a hundred small Mean things I could do with the word and I don\u2019t. We say goodbye with the awkwardness of two people exiting a corridor in opposite directions at the same time. When I go back in, the smell of salt and vinegar hits me like a century, and Laura looks at my face and then offers me a cigarette without comment, which I don\u2019t take, which is a small victory, which she celebrates by lighting it herself and swearing at the extractor fan.\n\nMum, bless her, is busy making the national conversation into a local one. She has been to the post office and has told Margaret behind the counter that she has never been prouder of a parcel. She has phoned Radio Lancashire again and a man named Craig has given her five minutes to talk about the merits of lentil soup in a world gone strange. When I call her and say, \u201cHe phoned,\u201d she says, \u201cWho,\u201d and then immediately, \u201cOh,\u201d and then, after a second that sounds like a kettle beginning, \u201cGood,\u201d in a tone that is mainly relief patted flat by decades. We talk about the pelargoniums and about whether she should risk Bakewell when the pastry makes her teeth feel like an idea, and she says, \u201cCome Sunday,\u201d and I say, \u201cOf course,\u201d and the universe nods because it likes scheduled love.\n\nThe email that I cannot ignore arrives while I am carrying a tray of four gins and a plate of olives that are pretending to be generous and are not. It\u2019s from the production office of a touring company of a musical that my mother would describe as the one with all the people in coats. They are offering me an audition for a featured role and for the ensemble, and the dates look like a dot-to-dot of cities I have only ever visited for two hours on a bus with a broken air-con. There is rehearsal in London and then two months in places where my accent gets warmer. There\u2019s money that would mean my rent does not have to be a question. There is, hiding under all that, the fact of leaving, which is not a single thing but a flake of everything.\n\nI print the email because my hands understand paper better than they understand screens. The printer in the corner wheezes like a pensioner getting out of a warm bath and spits out the sheet with a curl. I read it standing in the kitchen by the little freezer where someone has put a joke magnet that says I ONLY DRINK PROSECCO ON DAYS THAT END IN Y and taped over it WITH: NOT THIS ONE. Morris clocks the top line as he flips a haddock.\n\n\u201cGo on then,\u201d he says without looking round. \u201cWhat\u2019s the big ask. What do they want you to wear. Don\u2019t wear leather. You\u2019ll sweat like a saint.\u201d\n\nI tell him in a paragraph that ends up longer than I mean. He turns, tongs in hand, and squints at me as if reading tiny writing on my forehead. \u201cYou want it?\u201d he says, simple as a knife.\n\n\u201cI want to want it,\u201d I say, and that\u2019s the truth before I have time to tidy it.\n\n\u201cThen that\u2019s wanting it,\u201d he says, and he drops chips into oil like a blessing.\n\nThere are practicalities that are actually feelings knocking on with clipboards. I tell Laura and she says, \u201cGo,\u201d so fast it\u2019s like she has been waiting to say it since we met. She goes bright-eyed and then bored-eyed in a breath. \u201cWe\u2019ll cope,\u201d she adds, which stings because it\u2019s true and because it\u2019s very them to make my leaving not a drama to throw at me like a net. Shaz, who does melodrama with the same skill she does receipts, says she will print me and put me on the wall and make customers throw beer mats at my cardboard face to win a free shot. I tell Mum and she says, \u201cWe\u2019ll work it,\u201d without a comma, as if the words are a single long plank we can walk across and not fall off.\n\nThe shimmer works itself into the corners of this new possibility like a draft. It\u2019s subtle. It\u2019s in how the street near my flat seems a shade narrower for a second and then remembers its width. It\u2019s in the way the light in my kitchen slides across the tiles and then catches on a bit of air where nothing is. It\u2019s in the pause before the shop door opens when the bell does a tring without the handle moving and then does it again to overcompensate. I start paying attention to it and I tell myself I shouldn\u2019t because attention feeds it, then I tell myself that ignoring things is how they trip you. On Thursday, taking my washing down at the launderette because my machine has decided to be performative such as: today, no, I watch a little girl point at a patch of empty floor with a grin like she\u2019s spotted a rabbit. She keeps looking, then frowns, then tears up without any drama. Her mother lifts her, bounces her, says, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing there, poppet,\u201d and the girl stops bright-crying and does the kind of sob that sounds like a miniature scratch on glass. When they leave, the air where she pointed feels colder, and then it doesn\u2019t.\n\nI go to the Priory the next afternoon because it has the sort of quiet that is not an absence but a presence that has decided to lower its voice. The castle squats an undangerous black and the path to the church is full of small choices you don\u2019t have to remember afterwards. I sit on the stone wall and look at the gravestones and their sturdy names and think about permanence and about the theatre of it, because we do not inscribe our deaths to remind the dead. The wind comes up the hill with a silly insistence that makes my hair do a thing it thinks is flirtatious. A tour group shuffles past me and the guide says dates whose syllables have been rounded by use. I hum, because it is the thing I do that makes me feel like I might be a tuning fork for my own life.\n\nIn the church porch, there is a notice pinned up about bellringers wanted. It has a phone number that has been corrected twice in biro. Inside, the air is predictably cool and smells like stone and beeswax and sensible patience. A woman at the back is arranging flowers with the ferocity of someone determined to make softness behave. I light a candle for my own daft reasons and when the flame catches, there\u2019s that tickle in the skin between my shoulder blades and I think, not here, not this, and then let the thought be small. As I turn to go, a man in a very tidy raincoat steps into the nave and stops. He looks around with the eyes of someone who has come to see something specific and has found a lot of things that are not that thing. He frowns into the air to my right. He lifts his hand a little, as if hailing a taxi that none of us can see. He drops it again, embarrassed by a thought that didn\u2019t work. He meets my gaze and smiles the British apology for occupying volume. He says, \u201cSorry,\u201d to nothing, and shuffles away.\n\nI tell Laura about the email and the Priory and the man and I dress it all like a joke because telling it any other way makes me feel like one of those men who smell vaguely of old smoke and tell you about a cold spot in their kitchen. We are on her sofa in a living room that has three misbehaving plants and a poster of a film with a kiss that is better than the film. She listens with her ankles crossed and a pen in her hair that she forgot was there. She doesn\u2019t laugh. She doesn\u2019t not laugh. She pours me wine into a mug because she has never owned a wine glass that survived August.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re tired,\u201d she says, which is both true and useful and boring.\n\n\u201cI am,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019m also\u2026 I don\u2019t know. Like someone remembered me twice.\u201d\n\nShe bites the side of her lip the way she does when she\u2019s about to call me an idiot in the kindest way. \u201cYou are very rememberable,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople are probably rearranging where to put you in their head and throwing their house off. The Priory has drafts because it\u2019s older than your granddad\u2019s socks. As for the job\u2014say yes, and then we\u2019ll learn the next bit later. You can\u2019t keep returning to the same sentence and expecting a different ending.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an ensemble,\u201d I say, because I have learned, apparently, to give myself the slight wound I need someone to kiss better.\n\n\u201cAnd?\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019ll be part of a whole that works because of parts. It\u2019ll make you strong in your corners. You can be a solo later. Or never. I like you in harmony. Also, selfishly, I would like to come and see you in a coat in Sheffield.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not convinced there are coats in Sheffield,\u201d I say.\n\n\u201cThere are only coats in Sheffield,\u201d she says. \u201cThey issue you one at the station.\u201d\n\nWhen I get back to my flat, the hallway smells like someone has tried to cover a smell with toast. There\u2019s a new flyer on the corkboard for a yoga class that uses chairs and forgiveness. The BEST DAD mug is on the draining board where I left it to air after soup. The St Christopher sits against my chest and is a little warmer than he has any right to be. I take the medal off and put it on the windowsill and it looks immediately like a small lost coin. I stand for a minute, looking at it, and then the light from a passing car lifts across the room and puts a long face on the ceiling and the face is not a face and I say out loud, \u201cEnough,\u201d and laugh at myself and the room, which is to say I make the air agree that this is daft.\n\nIt is late when the call comes and it is very reasonable. It is the production manager from the tour, and her voice is a friendly spreadsheet. She thanks me for my interest which is a funny sentence to be on the end of when you\u2019ve done nothing yet but breathe. She asks if I can be in London for a workshop next Thursday and says it will be gentle and there will be biscuits and no one will shout unless the fire alarm does. I say yes. I say yes like a person who knows he\u2019s relied on other people\u2019s yeses for too long to be shy now. When I hang up, I put my hands on the back of the sofa and look at the clock and for a second the numbers move in a way that makes my stomach do the small lift in the lift. It\u2019s a trick of the eyes. The clock stops behaving. The room sits down around me again.\n\nI go to Mum\u2019s on Sunday with a bag that is heavier than it needs to be because I have put in bread that she already owns and fruit she will not eat until it is soup. The pelargoniums are triumphant, and Rachel the cat slinks along the top of the sofa like a lady avoiding puddles. Mum has put up a picture of me in the kitchen where the calendar used to go and has taped the calendar over the boiler instead. The rocket that she drew for the audition day is now next to a note that says CHECK GAS MAN and a smiley face that looks a little like a man who has just lost his hat. She has made a crumble and the custard is the right thickness and we eat it with the sort of seriousness that should be reserved for treaties.\n\nI tell her about the offer. She lifts an eyebrow and then both eyebrows and then one again, a choreography that could be a language if codified. \u201cYou\u2019ll go,\u201d she says, not question and not permission. \u201cYou\u2019ll look after your throat and your feet and you\u2019ll come back on Sundays and you\u2019ll tell me if you need me to send up ham.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you if I need ham,\u201d I say. \u201cAnd soup. And your opinion on coats.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t wear leather,\u201d she says, and I laugh because Morris did that one already and it is unfair that the universe shares notes about me behind my back.\n\nThe shimmer tries it on in her house, because why should it not. It stands in the corner for a second like someone waiting to be told where to put a chair. Mum catches me not looking at it and goes, \u201cWhat,\u201d in the way that says she has noticed me noticing something I have decided to carry alone. I tell myself to say nothing and then I say something because she put me together and she has a right to be consulted when parts go odd.\n\n\u201cDo you ever feel the air\u2019s off,\u201d I say, very breezy, very I\u2019m-not-daft.\n\nShe doesn\u2019t go mystical and she doesn\u2019t go mocking. She puts her fork down and considers. \u201cSometimes,\u201d she says. \u201cYou mean like the house has moved but you haven\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d I say, and the relief is a silly kind\u2014like someone else admitting they go to the toilet after their bath.\n\n\u201cAge,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd lack of salt. And ghosts. Take your pick.\u201d She reaches and squeezes my wrist as if sounding it. \u201cDon\u2019t build it a room. Only guests that pay rent get a room. Make it stand outside if it gives you cheek.\u201d\n\nWhen I leave, she presses the St Christopher in my hand, because I\u2019d left him on her shelf without thinking and she has been dusting him like a small errand. \u201cKeep him,\u201d she says. \u201cHe\u2019s working overtime.\u201d I tuck him back on. The metal sits on my skin and a thought I will not dignify with words crosses my mind and then goes away because it has no manners.\n\nThe workshop in London is a plain room with a piano and a lot of people pretending this is normal. It\u2019s me and six others who all look like they are better at yoga than I am and a director who has the air of a kind headteacher. There\u2019s an ensemble number where we have to move like we are one person with a lot of limbs and an intimacy exercise that makes me nearly laugh because no one has ever made me lean backwards into a colleague on purpose before. The MD is different but also somehow the same, because there is a species of musical director that grows in certain soils. He has a small way of counting that makes the space in between numbers useful. At break, a girl named Naima offers me half her banana bread and asks me about Lancashire like it\u2019s a spice she has not cooked with. We talk about trains and vowels and the value of a pub that knows your drink without asking.\n\nIt happens again, this offness, during a run of a section where we all have to hum under someone else\u2019s line. The hum is easy and gorgeous and I am busy being part of it when, for the space of a breath, the room tilts. The MD\u2019s pencil falls off the piano with a clatter that is too loud for the minute it occupies. Everyone blinks. No one says anything, because we are professionals pretending to be chairs. The director says, \u201cOnce again from F,\u201d as if she can restart not only the song but the air. Naima glances at me with an inquiry that does not want to pry. After, when we are filling paper cups from a jug that insists on glugs at the worst moments, she says, \u201cDoes London make you feel like you\u2019re being watched by your old house,\u201d and I say, \u201cYes,\u201d and we grin because some metaphors choose you.\n\nWalking back to the hotel that evening, the city does what it does with itself\u2014scrubs up, lights up, shows off. A busker with a voice like well-used denim sings a tune that is a cousin of my own. A man in a peacoat stops in the middle of the pavement and frowns at a space above my shoulder and then says, \u201cExcuse me,\u201d to nothing, and I step aside with him out of politeness because even his nothing looks urgent. When I pass a shop window and catch my reflection, the lights in the shop strobe once, twice, like a wink, and it is very easy at that point to believe that the trick is me.\n\nBack in the hotel, there\u2019s a card under my door with a logo that looks like a golden pretzel and a note in handwriting that thinks very well of itself. Conrad has left it, or one of Conrad\u2019s Conrads, and it says he\u2019d love to talk strategy and that the window is now, which makes me snort because, according to men like Conrad, windows are always now and doors are always closing and roofs are always about to fall in. I put the card on the table next to the tiny kettle and the sachets of tea that taste vaguely of regret and I look at it and I feel how easy it would be to say yes to what is shiny because it is shiny. I think of Morris and his tongs and Laura\u2019s eyebrows and Mum\u2019s fork and the St Christopher. I think of the Blue Otter sign squeaking in the wind. I think of the man at the Priory hailing what wasn\u2019t. I think of me, in a coat, humming a line that holds other people up.\n\nIn the night, the corridor outside my room makes the small rude noises that hotel corridors make\u2014the trolley that bangs into something, the whisper-shout of someone who has lost their key, the sudden run of a child whose parents didn\u2019t manage bedtime. At three, because of course it is three, I wake with that particular knowledge that someone has said my name. It is not frightening, not in the film way. It\u2019s more like a roll call. I lie there and I say, without moving my mouth, present, and it quiets. The ceiling has its parallel bars of light. I keep my breathing even because if I don\u2019t, my heart will take it as a dare. I must sleep again because when my alarm murmurs at seven, the room is where I left it and the world is the right size. When I pick up the St Christopher to put him back on, he is warm and I have no proof of anything.\n\nWhat there is proof of is the way this could all spin. The workshop goes on. I learn to stand on a taped mark that is not mine because it looks like it is mine and then learn to forgive myself for thinking I can claim anything that has chalk on it. I learn the harmony line that sits nicely under my throat and makes me feel like a chair supporting someone else\u2019s back. We break for lunch and I sit on a step in the sun with Naima and a boy named Kit who pretends to disdain everything and then remembers to eat like a runner and we talk about whether football is a musical and Kit gets so excited he nearly falls into the street. My phone buzzes with a text from Gemma about a small spot on the morning show next week and I feel that small hot pinch behind my eyes that says, careful, love, keep room for the quiet.\n\nAfter, when I go to cross the road, a cyclist whips past me so close I could count the stitches in the knee of his jeans. He shouts, \u201cSorry, mate,\u201d and then adds, to the air half a foot behind me, \u201cThought you were stepping,\u201d and for a second the pavement moves under my foot and then doesn\u2019t. I stand there with my hand on the pole like a man waiting for news from a doctor, and the news comes in the form of a Green Man light and I go because that\u2019s what you do when lights tell you to.\n\nOn the train back north that evening, there is the warm clag of people who have earned their sit. Across from me, a woman eats crisps very thoughtfully. In the seats behind, two lads argue about whether it is acceptable to go to a wedding in trainers if they are clean. A man further down the carriage dozes and wakes and dozes and the part of me that wants everything to make story notices that, each time he wakes, his eyes flick to the aisle and then to the window, as if he expects someone to be sitting in the seat he left as a child. When the sun slips behind a cloud and the carriage gets the flat, ungenerous light of a tunnel without being in one, I look at my reflection in the window and, for a breath, there are two of me, layered wrong. One has his head tilted a fraction, listening. The train lurches. The images click together again. I say, quietly, \u201cNo,\u201d and the crisp-eating woman looks up and smiles like we have agreed to discipline the universe and then gone back to our snacks.\n\nLancaster Station is human again. The platform coughs up familiar coats. The smell of chips in the air is either real or memory doing a very good job of itself. I stand on the concourse and watch a man with a violin case argue gently with a woman about whose turn it is to be gracious. The sky has been pinked by someone overeager. I walk down past the Priory and the Castle and the river sits like a sentence at the bottom of the town and I read it without moving my lips. When I reach my flat, there\u2019s a parcel propped against my door that contains a pair of shoes I forgot I ordered in a moment of optimism. They are a little too shiny but I put them on and they make me stand slightly taller than I am, which is perhaps the point and perhaps a warning. On the corkboard outside, the lost cat Stacey has been returned, as evidenced by a new little note added at the bottom in all caps that says THANK YOU, FOUND HER UNDER THE BED. The picture of Stacey has a biro smile drawn on now, which seems unfair to Stacey but probably helps the child in the house believe in endings.\n\nI sit on my sofa and I say yes to the ensemble audition because you cannot only say yes to ideas; you must say yes to the bits that make your throat work and your feet sore. I text Laura and she replies with a sticker of someone collapsing on a chaise longue. I text Mum and she sends back a single word\u2014COATS\u2014and three hearts that are not quite the right colour but are somehow better for it. I put my phone face down and the room behaves. The St Christopher lies on my collarbone like a coin on a magician\u2019s knuckle. I think about tricks and about angles and about how much of our lives is choosing which story to show with our shoulders while our hands are doing something honest. I think about the feeling like a corridor and I decide, for tonight, that it belongs to somewhere else that is not my sofa.\n\nThere\u2019s a knock at my door that is not a knock so much as a cautious inquiry with knuckles. When I open it, it\u2019s the woman from the second floor who I only know as Mrs T because she signs for parcels and writes variations of deliver to Mrs T on our communal nonsense. She is tiny and upright and sees through things in a way that could be vicious but never has been, at least not to me. She holds out a foil-wrapped parcel as if it might misbehave.\n\n\u201cI made too much,\u201d she says, which is one of those universal languages. \u201cIt\u2019s lasagne, but I\u2019ve done it my way.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know your way,\u201d I say, taking it, suddenly breathless with gratitude.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t either,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s different every time. You were on the television. Very good. You didn\u2019t shout.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d I say, and she nods once, curtly, the way people do when they have decided to like you and would die before admitting it in the language of people who overuse their adjectives. As she turns to go, she pauses and looks not at me but to my left. She frowns. \u201cDo you have a friend in there,\u201d she says, and I feel every hair on my arms stand because it\u2019s nothing and because it\u2019s something.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d I say, as lightly as a person can who has decided his lasagne is an amulet. \u201cJust me.\u201d\n\nShe looks like she could call me an idiot or a liar or a man who needs to be told to buy thicker curtains. Instead she looks down at her sensible shoes and says, \u201cWell. Don\u2019t be long,\u201d in the tone of a person whose children were late for tea and learned the price. She goes. The corridor is suddenly itself with great dedication. I close my door and lean my forehead against it and laugh once, because I am not going to give fear the dignity of a speech.\n\nThat night, I sleep with the window cracked and the street comes in like a neighbour through a side gate. Somewhere, a fox makes a noise like someone trying not to cough. Somewhere else, laughter jumps a fence and runs into the next garden. I dream I am on a stage and I can hear the audience breathing and when I open my mouth to sing, I sing my name and the room sings it back not as Jake or Jacob but as two notes that mean the same thing. When I wake, morning is incremental and my ceiling has no faces and I, inconveniently, want both breakfast and to tell someone everything and to keep it all in a small jar marked Not Yet. I take the lid off slowly. The day sits there like a cat in sun, pretending it chose me.",

The flats across the street have their curtains at the half-mast that means weekdays, and the bakery below throws up that yeasty breath that makes you think your life is more wholesome than it is. I make tea and drink it standing up, an old habit from the years when sitting felt like an invitation to not get up again, and I hum into the steam because it\u2019s easier than thinking in straight lines. The email from the touring company sits starred in my inbox, not because I don\u2019t know what to say, but because I\u2019m greedy for the moment when the saying will still be saying and not said. The St Christopher has left a faint circular dint on my chest that looks like a punctuation mark. I touch it and tell myself to stop being dramatic and then give myself permission to be dramatic for exactly five minutes because even saints get breakfast.\n\nOn the way to The Otter I take the long cut along the river because it\u2019s good to let the water tell you what kind of person you are that day and today it says you are reachable. A man is throwing a ball for a dog that is a dog in the way that makes you want to apologize to it for not owning it. When I pass, he says, \u201cMorning,\u201d in the tone of a person who has decided the day needs greeting to behave. The dog pauses, ball soft in its mouth, and looks at my shoulder with interest, then shifts its gaze one thumb-width to the left. I say, \u201cAll right, mate,\u201d and it does that little sideways wag that means thank you for acknowledging my work and, also, you\u2019ve got something following you. It is ridiculous how easily a dog\u2019s glance can move your temperature, and yet there I am, warmer for it and colder where the air presses oddly at the edge of my jaw.\n\nThe pub smells like the nap between lunch and tea\u2014lemon in the mop water, a suggestion of gravy still lingering, the faint damp of beer mats that were too brave last night. Shaz is polishing cutlery with the concentration of a surgeon and the earrings of a woman who has never met a hoop she didn\u2019t immediately respect. She looks me up and down and says, \u201cYou look like you\u2019ve had an idea,\u201d which is the sort of thing that makes you feel both seen and accused. I tell her about the workshop offer in a paragraph that keeps trying to turn into a list. She listens and nods and doesn\u2019t say anything until I run out of words like a kid runs out of trampoline.\n\n\u201cSay yes,\u201d she says, as if the word itself is a seasoning and she\u2019s added it to a stew she\u2019s been waiting to finish. \u201cWe\u2019ll buy a cake. We\u2019ll say goodbye and we\u2019ll say see you and we\u2019ll say bring the coat back in one piece. If it\u2019s awful, we\u2019ll say we told you to try. If it\u2019s good, we\u2019ll say we told you to go. That way, we\u2019re right twice.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s how right works,\u201d I say, and she winks because of course it is.\n\nAt table three, a man with shoulders like two grievances and a scarf too light for his throat says, \u201cYou served us on the quay, didn\u2019t you? Yesterday. With the pink prosecco? You were quick.\u201d I open my mouth to disagree and then close it because his wife is already nodding, eyes kind, and I find it easier to say, \u201cGlad you were looked after,\u201d and take the compliment from whatever air offered it up. After they leave, Laura sidles over with the sort of step you use on a stage when you\u2019re pretending to be a tree.\n\n\u201cThought I saw you at the bus stop this morning,\u201d she says, casual as a cat. \u201cBut then you were inside, behind me, ringing in your tips, so unless you\u2019ve learned to split yourself\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d I say, half a plea and half a laugh. \u201cI\u2019m already being haunted by my better timekeeping. Don\u2019t involve buses.\u201d\n\nShe bumps my shoulder with her shoulder and eyes me properly. \u201cYou\u2019re not going weird about it, are you? Because if you go weird, I\u2019ll have to slap you, and HR will write me up.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I say, and I give the word enough ballast that it feels true while I\u2019m saying it. \u201cTired. Unused to being looked at even when I am and not being looked at even when I\u2019m not.\u201d\n\n\u201cClassic existential crisis,\u201d she says, delighted by the phrase as if she could put it on a t-shirt. \u201cHave a crisp.\u201d\n\nThe afternoon slides by with that melodramatic sigh it gets when a storm is considering Lancashire and then decides, very well, another hour. I take delivery of a box of lemons that thinks it is the size of a man\u2019s regrets and sign the slip like a person who understands citrus. Morris hums and does not notice he is humming until he stops to listen to his own tune and forgets it instantly. At four, I find a quiet five minutes in the store cupboard that smells like pepper and last winter and I send the email that says yes, I\u2019d be honoured, and I check it twice for spelling because there is something deeply humiliating about misplacing an L in honoured at the very moment you\u2019re telling the universe you mean it. When the whoosh goes and the email is a past tense, I lean my head against the shelf and grin into the dark like a teenager telling secrets to a nice wall.\n\nThe rehearsal room the following week is an uglier version of the kind of space that pretends to be neutral. There are scuffs on the floor that map out other people\u2019s ambitions and a stack of chairs that looks, as ever, faintly judgmental. The director\u2014Marta, brisk without being sharp\u2014claps her hands once for gentleness and once for authority. \u201cLet\u2019s warm bodies, then voices,\u201d she says, and makes us all do very silly shapes while our hearts decide if they\u2019re in on this. The other lads are different combinations of me in other decades and not me at all. Naima is there, cool in a way that isn\u2019t cold, and Kit is working very hard at looking like he isn\u2019t working very hard. We do a movement pattern that seems designed to discover what your knees think about pressure and, halfway through, I catch myself in the mirror and, for a long blink, there are two me\u2019s offset by a smidge, like someone forgot one layer when printing. The man I am in the second version is in a darker shirt, or perhaps it\u2019s the shadow of that, and his mouth is a beat behind my mouth. I do not flinch because I will not feed it the flinch, and the image clicks, and what remains is me looking slightly too serious for a person sliding diagonally across a floor.\n\nMarta gives notes in a way that makes you want to be better because she believes you can be, not because she will be cross if you aren\u2019t. \u201cYou lead with your left shoulder,\u201d she says to me without looking up from her notebook. \u201cStop apologizing to your right. The audience will forgive you everything if they think you meant it. Again from the lift.\u201d We go again. The MD\u2014this one called Tim\u2014clicks his tongue and claps a cross-rhythm and looks at me over his glasses like we have a pact. I remember the breath Laura taught me and I fill it and, for a little while, the world behaves because I have convinced it to with lung and attention.\n\nOn the break, I stand at the window and watch London do its very best impression of itself. Down on the pavement, a school group is being gathered by a teacher with the posture of someone born with highlighter pens. The last boy in the line\u2014tall, coltish, hoodie with a logo that means something if you\u2019re fourteen and fluent\u2014pauses, frowns, looks up in that exact way I am learning too many people do, and then says something to the air that looks like, \u201cWait.\u201d His mate huffs at him and tugs, and he goes, and I touch the St Christopher the way you check your pocket for your keys, which is to say I do not need to, and I do. Naima comes to lean beside me, holds out half a satsuma in the palm of her hand like an offering.\n\n\u201cYou all right?\u201d she says, and she might be talking about the chorus or about whatever it is I\u2019m wearing like a perfume you can only smell if you once owned it.\n\n\u201cI keep feeling like someone is about to join me,\u201d I say, making it a joke because the alternative is that I become the sort of man who corners a woman during a break and gives her a tour of his interior weather.\n\n\u201cThey probably are,\u201d she says, pragmatic. \u201cRooms are greedy. They want to be full. It\u2019s why we clap when people leave them.\u201d\n\nThe call from Dad comes while I\u2019m buying plasters for a blister that has just expressed itself like a wrong footnote. It\u2019s less of a call and more of a message that looks like an apology before I press play. There\u2019s not much in it beyond a picture of a microphone on a website put into my inbox by a man who can just about work WhatsApp. He has captioned it, If this is the right sort, I\u2019ll get it. The model number is impressive in a way my bank balance would prefer not to know. I reply with a thank you so warm it makes me flinch and he sends back a thumbs up that could mean anything, and then a second later a second thumbs up, because sometimes a man doesn\u2019t trust the first one to have told the truth. It occurs to me that the men in my family might be thumbs up people forever and perhaps it\u2019s fine, perhaps love is better for arriving like small signs you could ignore if you were trying.\n\nMum, when I phone her that night from the mosquito buzz of the hotel\u2019s bedside lamp, is watching some crime drama where everyone whispers in rooms that are too blue. She turns the TV down and I can hear Rachel purring like an overfull radiator. \u201cHow\u2019s your knees,\u201d she says by way of hello, and then, \u201cYour Auntie Lila says there\u2019s a lady at Slimming who swears blind she saw you in Morrison\u2019s on Greaves Road today arguing with the scales, and I told her you\u2019re in London arguing with people who tell you to raise your eyebrows at the second eight.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t argue,\u201d I say. \u201cI discuss loudly.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou argue,\u201d she says, with satisfaction. \u201cListen, love, there\u2019s a thing I should tell you, because you\u2019ll only go and find your own head about it and I\u2019d rather it be mine. When you were little, you did this before.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid what?\u201d I say, sitting up as if it\u2019ll make the phone hear better.\n\n\u201cShowed up twice,\u201d she says, so calmly that I check the line to make sure it hasn\u2019t doubled. \u201cNot to everyone. To me. And to Mrs Paterson at number twenty-one, God rest her. There were days I\u2019d be washing up and you\u2019d be in front of the telly with your tractor and then you\u2019d come in behind me and ask for a biscuit and I\u2019d say you\u2019ve just had one and you\u2019d say no and I\u2019d say well, who\u2019s that then, and you\u2019d say, that\u2019s me watching the tractors. I never told you because what good would it do, and then you stopped. Six? Seven? I thought maybe it was just the sort of thing that children bring home from other places and put down like leaves and then forget.\u201d\n\nI sit there with the phone warm against my cheek and the world doing that slow tilt it gets when you realize you are not the first person to live in your life. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause,\u201d she says, brisk affection buckling on its sensible shoes, \u201cif your child brings two of themselves into a kitchen, and both of them want tea, you don\u2019t call a priest, you make two teas and you tell them to keep it down because Neighbours is on. And you don\u2019t want to frighten them into feeling wrong. And because I thought maybe it was me. An extra you because I was a tired woman who wanted very much there to be someone changing the channel while I did the washing. It didn\u2019t feel bad. It felt like when you catch sight of yourself in a window and remember your face belongs to you.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do I do with it?\u201d I say, and I am ashamed instantly of the way the pronoun has turned into it and not him, not me.\n\n\u201cYou sing,\u201d she says, as if I\u2019ve asked what weather coat I should wear. \u201cYou go to work. You kiss your friends when they will let you. You don\u2019t stand in the middle of the road because you\u2019re thinking about air. And if you feel frightened, you send it out of the room with a firm voice. Things respond to firmness. That\u2019s how I got Rachel to stop sleeping on the cooker. Also pepper. Pepper keeps cats off everything.\u201d\n\nI laugh, because it\u2019s either laugh or explain to the hotel curtains that I have accidentally stepped into a folktale and I could do with a committee. \u201cDo you ever think\u2014\u201d I begin, and stop, because adulthood affords you this brief lucidity where you understand that some questions have no teeth in them.\n\n\u201cI think lots,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t tell most of it to anyone because people are tired and it\u2019s rude to wake them. Come Sunday.\u201d\n\nThe day we find out about the tour is a Friday, damp and obliging. I\u2019ve barely sat my bag down before Gemma texts a picture of a clipboard with the word cast above a list that looks like a family tree. My name is there, not in bold but not faint. Ensemble, with a cover for a man who sings a duet in act two and has a hat that I could learn to make look sympathetic. I stare at the phone until the letters are not letters anymore. Naima calls and whoops into my ear with such sincerity I think my hearing might carry the shape of it for a week. Kit texts, The coat is so good, with seventeen coat emojis, which are not exactly accurate, but we are not in the business of accuracy, we are in the business of making shapes stand for other shapes.\n\nI tell The Otter by simply not being able to stop smiling while carrying four plates at once, which leads to Shaz deciding it\u2019s not fair to make me hold news in as well as food. She taps a knife against a glass with the authority of a woman who has brokered peace treaties over chips. \u201cOur Jacob,\u201d she says, not caring that I like Jake because she likes the biblical weight of the long name when she\u2019s being ceremonial, \u201chas been invited to pretend to be other people in good shoes. He will be leaving us for a bit. Try not to break anything while he\u2019s gone. We will take up a collection for the trouser press he will inevitably buy with his first wage packet.\u201d The cheer is bigger than the room. The regular with the scarf pats my arm like we\u2019re a team that just scored, and Mrs St Christopher puts her hand to her chest with a little theatrical gasp and I want to hug the whole place and also run away because the human heart, even when surrounded by the beer taps of its youth, is only so big and mine is at capacity.\n\nThat evening, because one must, I walk down to the Priory to tell the castle because it has as much right to know as anyone else and because the stone has a way of sorting your news into piles: this is the part that matters; this is the part you have invented so you can pretend the part that matters is dignified. The church is shutting and the woman with the flowers is counting stems like a general tallying his troops. On the path, a man and a woman are taking wedding photos in a wind that has decided to be in all their hair at once. The photographer makes soothing noises at the sky. I skirt them and lean on the low wall where you can see the river and the line of houses that think they are in a painting and the clump of trees that looks like it\u2019s eavesdropping. My breath goes in and out in the way that only gets earlier in the day if you\u2019re careful with it. When I turn to go, there\u2019s a lad about my age standing by the gate, frowning at the space a foot to my right in that now-familiar way. We do that British dance of pretend deference\u2014after you, no after you\u2014and as we pass he says, \u201cIs your brother\u2014\u201d and then shakes his head like he\u2019s dropped a biscuit and won\u2019t stoop for it, and adds, \u201cSorry, weird question,\u201d and I say, \u201cI don\u2019t have a brother,\u201d and he says, \u201cOh,\u201d in a way that is both apology and proof, and the gate clicks behind me with the sound of a full stop.\n\nThe thing with the double stops being a whisper and becomes a done fact the night Laura rings me from outside the chemist opposite the bus station and says, very calmly, very Laura when she\u2019s driving a situation with both hands, \u201cI am going to say something and you\u2019re going to breathe and then we are going to decide to laugh and then we are not going to stop laughing until it\u2019s not frightening.\u201d I say, \u201cOkay,\u201d because there\u2019s not much else you can say to such a well-ordered threat, and she says, \u201cI just watched you walk past me, go into the shop, buy plasters, and come out again. You nodded at me. Your hair was stupid and you had your coat on but not done up like a free man. You were you. And I am on the phone with you and I can hear the kettle boiling behind you and I can hear the oven fan that I keep telling you is on its last legs. So there are two of you, and one of them needs socks. I am holding it together because I went to Brownies and learned to cope. Tell me you are making tea.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m making tea,\u201d I say, because I am, because that\u2019s a thing that renders you real even if your molecules are trying out other careers. \u201cAnd I have plasters, so at least the other one knows what\u2019s good for his shoes.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d she says, in that clipped register she has when she\u2019s rearranging the filing cabinet inside her mind and finding the file is missing. \u201cHe walked like you. He didn\u2019t look translucent. I didn\u2019t feel a chill. He had the little frown like you have when you\u2019re calculating how much tip to draw out of someone with nice nails. He looked at me and he said, \u2018All right,\u2019 and he did your voice in your mouth. It was you. And then he was gone because he\u2019d turned the corner because that\u2019s what people do when corners are there.\u201d\n\nI sit down because if I do not sit, my legs will do an impression of sitting without me. \u201cOkay,\u201d I say, grateful to the syllables for their shape. \u201cOkay. It\u2019s happened to Mum, when I was a kid. She said I stopped and then here it is again. It\u2019s probably brain. It\u2019s probably grief-adjacent. It\u2019s probably me being looked at too much and the world\u2019s weirdness backwashing into us. It\u2019s probably none of that. I don\u2019t feel frightened. Or at least, I feel the kind of frightened that\u2019s useful, like the bit where you stand in the wing and then step three inches forward because otherwise you\u2019ll drink your whole body into a knot.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m coming over,\u201d she says, and I can hear her feet turn in the sound of the phone and the bus engine sighing its disappointment. \u201cI will bring biscuits. And something heavy to hit you with in case you are an imposter and also a test, like, how many questions can only my real Jake answer.\u201d\n\n\u201cNone,\u201d I say. \u201cYour friendship is so shallow it requires no specific knowledge,\u201d and she snorts, and I hear her decision to be unafraid flatten itself like pastry.\n\nShe arrives with a tin of shortbread that she calls medicinal and a bottle of wine that she calls for the saint. We sit at my kitchen table and do the kind of talking that feels like circling a pond with a torch, agreeing not to panic if two ducks become four. We make jokes about a rota for my selves and we make a plan that involves her taking pictures of any me she sees, at a respectful angle, like I am a rare bird at the feeder. When she goes to the loo, I watch the door like a child who has remembered that mirrors exist and thinks perhaps he should apologize for them. When she comes back, she stands in the doorway, looks to my left, and swears under her breath in a way that would have made our headteacher fail to hide a smile.\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d she says, and the word is an SOS and a spell. \u201cHe\u2019s there. He\u2019s there. I am not, at this precise second, hysterical. He\u2019s there and he\u2019s not a breeze. He is a person, he is\u2014\u201d She looks at me properly then, not at the air, and her eyes do the glass-bright thing you get when the body decides it needs to lubricate its panic. \u201cHe\u2019s older,\u201d she says, very small. \u201cBy a minute. He looks like you after you\u2019ve realized you can\u2019t afford a certain brand of cheese and you\u2019re going to get it anyway.\u201d\n\nI stand up slowly, because a slow man is less likely to break what he is walking toward. The air to my left is the air it always was and then it is the air it might be and then it is occupied by a sensation like I have stepped into a tune that I usually hear only on Wednesdays. I do not see him because seeing implies eyes and light and there is none of that. I feel him in that way you feel someone in a room with your eyes shut, in the shift of space and the voltage of attention. I say, as politely as a man who is about to cry because his friend looks like she\u2019s watching him evaporate can say, \u201cHello,\u201d and the floor stays the floor and the kettle clicks because it was going to anyway and then the room loosens. Laura sags against the doorframe and wipes her face with the sleeve of her cardigan and laughs once, rude and righteous.\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a flatmate. He better be tidy.\u201d\n\nThat night, I do not sleep so much as keep company with myself. The faces on the ceiling do their brief theatre and then respect my request for calm. Mum sends a text at eleven that says, Don\u2019t be a wally, and it\u2019s so perfectly on brand I let my face go soft with it. I dream that I am standing on the quay looking into the river and the river is glass again and under it this time there are not people but rooms, fifty of them, each with a version of me in it at a table, writing to someone I love. When I wake, afternoon has decided to start the day, and there\u2019s a message from the production saying they\u2019d like me to pop in for a costume fitting Friday and also would I mind a quick chat with marketing about whether I have any photographs of myself that make me look like I am having an experience. I say yes to all of it and put the kettle on and it boils in the way it always has, on the same hob, in the same kitchen, for a man who is feeling two degrees more companioned than he\u2019s used to.\n\nOn Friday, the costume department is a heaven of order that lives under the polite tyranny of rails. There are coats, obviously, and hats that have seen more arguments than most people, and a woman named Trish who can tell what decade you belong to by the angle you hold your elbows. She measures me with a tape that seems to be made of both cloth and gossip. \u201cYou\u2019re a thirty-eight on a day you haven\u2019t had a sandwich,\u201d she says, and pins something near my hip with a sound that could be a tut and could be a blessing. Naima emerges from behind a screen in a dress that looks like it was angry at first and then decided to be graceful; she does a small turn for me and I clap because sometimes the job is simply to witness and approve. Kit puts on a hat and becomes so handsome even he notices and takes it off quickly like the hat might be catching.\n\nWhen the fitting is done and I\u2019m released back into the city, I walk with my head one notch higher because the coat has taught my shoulders how to sit. Near the theatre, Kai appears like the answer to a question I hadn\u2019t asked out loud. He is on his way to a gig, deck of cards in his hand as if his fingers would get lonely without them. He grins when he sees me and tips a queen into existence from behind his ear as if he\u2019s rehearsed the trick on my head and been waiting for me to show up to pull it. We stand and talk in the traffic noise, two boys from the north pretending very successfully not to be fourteen.\n\n\u201cYou all right?\u201d he says, and I say, \u201cDefine,\u201d and he nods like I\u2019ve passed. He flips a double lift with the ease of someone who eats breakfast with sleight of hand. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking,\u201d he says, which is how men of our age say, I have been frightened for half an hour and don\u2019t know where to put it. \u201cAbout mirrors. How they take what you are and give it back and sometimes the glass goes lazy and doesn\u2019t bother to be exactly glass. You sing and it makes a room full of people feel reflected. You ever think sometimes reflection is like a drunk friend, showing up too many times at once.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think lots of things,\u201d I say. \u201cAnd then I fold them and put them in a drawer and sit on it.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d he says. \u201cKeep your drawers shut.\u201d He looks past me then, that same left-of-centre look everyone has been doing, and his face does two things at once\u2014entertained and very, very still. \u201cWell,\u201d he says, to the air that is holding its nerve. \u201cThat\u2019s a trick I can\u2019t explain.\u201d He sniff-laughs, like a magician who admires a rival\u2019s audacity, and his hand goes briefly to the back of his neck as if he could scratch off a shiver. \u201cYou\u2019ll be grand,\u201d he adds, and means both the song and the science.\n\nBy the time I get back to Lancaster that night, the train has rubbed off all my edges and I am briefly the shape of everyone. The station caf\u00e9 is closed but smells like something sugared has been arguing with something fried, which is its own comfort. I check my phone and there\u2019s a photo from Laura that makes my scalp itch and my heart want to write a letter. It is a picture of me\u2014jeans, white shirt, coat open\u2014walking past the window of the chemist again. The photo is taken at that distance where familiarity does the heavy lifting; the posture, the jaw, the stupid hair that needs arguing with. In the reflection in the glass, I think for a second that I can see me twice, me in the window man and me in the photographer\u2019s angle, making three, and then the train squeals, and a gull barks at a crisp packet, and I decide that for tonight I will eat toast and make notes on act two, scene four where the chorus moves like rain.\n\nBack in my flat, I press the St Christopher to my lips like a man who has learned how to be superstitious on weekdays. I email the production my measurements and a photograph of me in a coat where I look like a man about to apologize for being late to a revolution. I text Mum to say that I have been measured by a woman with a tape that knew my past and she replies with a sticker of a tape measure that has a face, and the face is patient. I text Dad a link to the microphone that won\u2019t break if you look at it wrong, and he sends back a short sentence\u2014Ordered\u2014without any punctuation, which is how our family does it when there\u2019s no room for the extra bits. The room is itself. The window does no tricks except the trick glass does when it shows you that you are there when you think you might not be. I go to the sink and wash a cup for the sake of it and put it on the rack and watch the water run from it like a thin sheet that moves itself, and I stand, not because anything has asked me to, but because it feels useful to demonstrate to the room that I can.\n\nOn Sunday, I carry ham and cake to Mum\u2019s because the pilgrimage needs a sacrifice and Mum\u2019s god is thinly sliced and appropriately salty. She has set new pelargoniums at jaunty angles, like they\u2019re trying to overhear the street, and Rachel does an elaborate ignore before allowing me to scratch the precise place where her spine becomes tail. We eat and we gossip and we inventory our worries like sensible women. I tell her about the coat, about Kai, about Laura\u2019s photo, and she listens like she\u2019s sitting a test she expects to pass. When I finish, she says, \u201cWell,\u201d in a tone that makes a cul-de-sac into a through road. \u201cThat\u2019s interesting. The thing is, love, if you\u2019re going to be more than one person, you\u2019re going to have to be very good at rest. Bodies don\u2019t do well when the occupants are greedy. And if there is more than one of you, tell the other one to take the bins out. He can pay rent in black bags.\u201d\n\nWe watch a quiz show that asks you to remember the names of capital cities and then tries to trick you with fun facts and neither of us falls for it. On the way out, she gives me a Tupperware box of stew that leaks immediately in protest at its own design and we laugh and then we double-wrap it, as if we can outwit physics. In the doorway, she looks to my left, not dramatically, not as if she is looking into a sudden corridor of light, just eyes flicked in the way you do when you hear a name from another room, and she nods once, approval granted to a thing that has not asked for it. \u201cAll right,\u201d she says, as if to me and to anyone I might have brought.\n\nOn my way home, the river looks more like steel than slate and a boy on a scooter takes the corner too hard and doesn\u2019t fall and his face splits into a grin so wide it could catch rain. The Blue Otter sign squeaks even though the wind is not trying very hard. I am here, in this, and also not only. The feeling sits with me on the bench like a good joke that can\u2019t be told yet because the person it\u2019s about just walked in. I breathe in a way that suggests I have learned one useful thing about being alive, and then I take my phone out and type, slowly and without drama, a message to Shaz that says we need to talk schedules, and a message to Laura that says he can have Wednesdays if he wants but the bins are both of ours, and a message to me, which stays unsent, saying, let them see you, let you see you, let him see you too. The air behaves. The light behaves. Night comes on like a room meaning you no harm.",

Every time I thought I had found its shape it went off and did a different impression of itself. There were very practical tasks that could be done with lists and bags and the satisfying click of a lid on a plastic box, and there were the other tasks that come disguised as duties and turn out, once you\u2019ve taken their coat, to be feelings. I wrote down everything that looked like it wanted being written: socks, spare charger, throat spray, coat, scripts, St Christopher, the good pen, biscuits, spare biscuits for the future, a spare future for the biscuits. I opened cupboards and looked at tinned tomatoes like we were in a long-distance relationship. I put my name down for the rota at The Otter for two more shifts and then crossed it out and then wrote it back again because I couldn\u2019t bear the idea of them imagining me gone and I couldn\u2019t bear the idea of them having to imagine me at all.\n\nShaz\u2019s way of coping with departure was to run the kind of military operation a more fanciful woman would describe as a hen-do for the heart. She drew up a schedule that had my last week annotated like a map of a complicated city. Monday was cake tasting which in her case meant a plate of three slices from three separate bakeries and the pronouncement that none of them were quite right, which was code for I have decided to bake it myself. Tuesday we would practice not crying by watching a sad film and not crying at it, which lasted thirteen minutes until a dog did the thing dogs do in sad films and both of us had to look out of the window and say harsh things about the scenery in order to survive. Wednesday she would pretend to forget my name and Thursday she would call me by my full name like she was the announcements at a station and then Friday would be the party and we would all congratulate each other on not making a fuss while making such a fuss that the fuss had to ask us to take our shoes off. Morris pretended to be cross in a way that involved putting an extra pie in the oven every half hour and then baffling us all by claiming no knowledge of how they got there.\n\nThe phenomenon\u2014we had stopped calling it anything with a capital letter\u2014kept turning up to put its finger on my shoulder and remind me that being singular was a hobby, not a law. There were days when it was a rumour at the edge of a room, when the only evidence that anything odd was happening was the fact that the air would breathe before me and after me and sometimes on behalf of me. There were other moments when its presence was the cleanest fact I had. Twice, coming home in the early dark, I found the bins already out at the kerb, lined up like good little soldiers. Once, the bathroom light was off when I was sure I\u2019d left it on, and the towel folded into that apologetic rectangle I do when I\u2019m trying to impress no one. A note appeared on my kitchen table that said buy milk in my handwriting and I refused, on principle, to give this any currency, even as I went and bought the milk and put it in the fridge of a flat that contained the ghosts of all the milk I hadn\u2019t bought on time.\n\nLaura dealt with it by making it part of the routine as if we were feeding a lodger we couldn\u2019t see. \u201cHe gets Wednesdays,\u201d she said, writing it on the wall calendar in her kitchen in a thick pen that bled through the paper and marked the plaster. \u201cHe can have Wednesdays and any day that begins with an S where you\u2019re not doing anything important. He can pay rent by doing the bins and the big clean before you let a man with a deposit form see this place. He better not drink my wine because if he does I will find the metaphysics necessary to slap him.\u201d In the way of a person who has known you since your hair thought it could get away with anything, she gathered my fear in her two hands the way a person gathers a goose\u2014firmly, efficiently, with a degree of swearing\u2014and moved it from one side of the room to the other where it could honk quietly without getting under our feet.\n\nOn Wednesday, the doorbell rang at a time of day when doorbells mean either post or bad news and I braced for both. It was a parcel that had travelled south to north in a way that looked like it had cost someone an effort he would refuse to call an effort. Inside was the microphone I had sent Dad the link to, and a little note folded the way men fold things when they don\u2019t trust their own handwriting, written on a slip of paper that had once been around a pack of screws. It said, Big enough? and then the second line said, Don\u2019t rinse it under the tap, which made me laugh and then blink much more fiercely than one ought to blink under a kitchen light. I set it up on the table like a guest at a small ordination and spoke into it as if I was saying grace for a roast I could not afford. The sound it made of me was both me and something I could learn to grow into. I sent him a voice note and the back of my neck tingled as it went, not with woo-woo, not with corridors, just with the way a man sometimes knows he is sending a message into a room that has been empty too long.\n\nMum took three days to ask whether he\u2014her word for him was he, not it\u2014had made himself useful and when I told her about the bins she made a satisfied noise and said, \u201cGood. If you\u2019re going to be two, you\u2019re going to be twice as useful. That\u2019s all I\u2019m saying.\u201d She had decided, in that way she had of turning a thing inside out and making it fit, that she had been given a second son without having to go through childbirth, which she had always maintained was greatly overrated as an activity, and if there was a polite haunting in the house at the far end of the quay then the polite thing to do was to put out a saucer of milk and let it be. When I mentioned I was leaving just after Sunday lunch, she did her face that is a practised balance between brave and I will die if you do not text me before Preston, and then she said, \u201cI\u2019ve bought you a new scarf. It\u2019ll look better with a coat that isn\u2019t yours,\u201d and we both laughed from the middle, because it is a relief when someone loves you enough to tease you where you are fragile.\n\nThe farewell at The Otter was the sort of thing that would look tacky if it wasn\u2019t made with so much sincerity it could have powered the lights. The chalkboard had MY FIRST TOUR on it and someone had drawn a coat that made me look like an admiral. The balloons were either the wrong colours or exactly the right ones, depending on whether you were a person who owns a spreadsheet. There were paper stars with my name in lipstick and a banner that was clearly a bed-sheet, the flowers still ghosted in its weave. Shaz, who had sworn last week that there would be no speeches, got up on a chair with the authority of a chair\u2019s natural predator and delivered an address that made a man at table six cry into his gin and a woman at the bar say, \u201cYou\u2019ll make me smudge,\u201d in a voice that betrayed the fact she had been softened into kindness by a long afternoon on her feet. I was told to say a few words and the few words multiplied like rabbits and I found myself talking about the first day I\u2019d carried four plates without dropping any, about the strange religion of regulars and how they will convert you without asking, about the fact that there is a kind of family whose breaking is still a family and that this was it, this room with its sticky tables and clean glasses and the sound of laughter that could lift a dead horse. When I finished, Shaz handed me a present wrapped in tin foil because she had lost the paper and inside was a Tupperware box of stew and a small printed photo of me at the age of nineteen with hair like a promise none of us could keep. On the back she had written: Don\u2019t forget who bought you your first throat sweets, and a phone number I already had, and a PS that said: ignore Conrad, we don\u2019t like his name.\n\nA man I didn\u2019t know put a tenner in my hand and told me to get myself a sandwich at the services, like I was going to war, and Mrs St Christopher fastened the medal more securely round my neck with a clumsy little knot that felt like something a church would teach you if it was kind. Morris promised to stay open late on nights when I finished late if I texted and said I was passing, which is how men say I will always have a chair for you. Laura pressed a pack of biscuits into my back pocket and said, \u201cEmergency,\u201d like she was a small god of sensible advice and sugar. We ate too much and drank exactly as much as you\u2019re allowed to when you will be driving in the morning and sang not at all until the very end when someone put on my audition on the telly and everyone watched it with the intensity of a group looking for proof they\u2019d known before it happened. I caught my own eye on the screen, that second where I always look left as if my mother could have arrived in the wrong place by accident and then made it right by looking, and I raised my bottle at the boy on the telly and he raised his literal mic at me, and if that isn\u2019t a trick then nothing is.\n\nI slept at Mum\u2019s the last night because not to would have been a small treason. We ate stew that tasted like my childhood and yesterday and if that sounds unlikely you have not had stew made by a woman who has been feeding a family on not-quite-enough for a lifetime. We watched the quiz where the man with the haircut like an apology tries to make us forget capitals we once knew by telling us about the bread they bake there, and we were so rude to him from the sofa that the cat left the room in protest. Mum put my overnight bag by the door at nine-thirty in a gesture that said I am very sensible about this and then stood in the kitchen looking into the space to my left for a longer beat than politeness demands. \u201cAll right, love,\u201d she said, and I did not ask whether she meant me or the air that has lately been telling us truths we already knew and were pretending not to. Before bed she put the scarf round my neck and stepped back with the satisfaction of a woman seeing a curtain hang correctly for the first time, then took it off because I\u2019d suffocate in my sleep under such carefulness. Upstairs, the bed smelled of the laundry detergent she buys because it has the word spring in the name even in December. Downstairs, the St Christopher hung from the bedpost because I didn\u2019t trust my own neck not to forget him.\n\nNight in my mother\u2019s house is loud in small ways. The boiler is proud of itself and needs us to know it has been working. The fridge adores humming and stops only to test if we are listening. The street outside refuses to be quiet even when the town has agreed to be, because there is always one fox and one boy with a scooter and one woman laughing on a phone. I woke at three with my heart near my mouth, not because I was frightened but because it had come to tell me that I was leaving and that the child part of me who thinks leaving means loss and loss means punishment had sat up to ask whether the biscuit situation would be maintained. I lay there and did the four counts. I listened for the corridor feeling and what I got instead was the warm-decided quiet of a house that knows me. At some point, I slept again and in my dream I was in the theatre, on the wing, and Del\u2014the man whose job it is to nod you into your fate\u2014was there with his headset and he said, not yet, not yet, and then he looked to my left and said, both, and when I stepped on the stage the light did not burn, it bathed.\n\nMorning had its way with us and we let it. Mum fussed in a register that would have made other people insane and made me calmer, because it was what the day was for. She told me three times to text at Preston and twice to stop for a wee whether I wanted to or not and once not to pick up hitchhikers unless they looked delicate and in need of soup. We put the pelargoniums into a position where they could spy on the wicket gate and we locked and unlocked the front door to make sure the ritual had been acknowledged by whatever part of the universe makes note of small diligence. When I hugged her for the last time in that hallway before I would be someone else\u2019s person for weeks, I felt the bones of her in that way that has nothing to do with frailty and everything to do with the fact that there is a framework that has held you up before you knew you were a weight. She looked to my left one more time and gave the same nod as she had given to me two minutes before and said \u201cbe good\u201d to both of us, and I wanted to say\u2014ridiculously, tenderly\u2014mum, we are, and instead I said, \u201cSee you Sunday,\u201d because a promise disguised as a plan is often the only honest thing you can offer.\n\nThe motorway south felt like an old song whose chords you could play in the dark. The road was generous for once, the big white vans didn\u2019t behave like men who were in love with the idea of being square, and the car, sainted with her new coil pack, made a purr that sounded like promise rather than threat. I put on the playlist that is too embarrassed to show itself to anyone else and sang to the bits that do not ask for me to be brave. At the services near Stafford I stopped for a tea that tasted like the memory of tea and texted Laura a picture of a sign that said Keep Left Except to Overtake and she wrote back, politics. Past the point where the fields start to pretend to be suburbs, the sky did that city trick of becoming bigger because the buildings were trying so hard to own it, and I felt the tilt, the little pull in the chest that you get when you are near your capital even if your capital has never been yours. The studios flickered across the windscreen like a place you glimpse in a film and think, oh there you are. The hotel, beige on beige, swallowed me and spat me into a room that knew exactly how much hot water to give a man before he praised it on an online form.\n\nRehearsals are a discipline like baking or prayer; they make your day into shapes you can predict and then they throw flour everywhere and hope you learned something from the mess last time. Marta stood at the front like a fulcrum and made us into levers. Tim tapped out a rhythm on the side of the piano and made our lungs coin-operate. Naima made a joke about communion when we all drank from the same jug and made the youngest lads laugh and then blush. We did the beginning until it didn\u2019t look like the beginning any more. We did the bit in the middle that everyone forgets and found it was the bit that makes the rest make sense. I learned to move like I had room for other people, which sounds like a therapy note and is also a fact on a stage. In the middle of a morning where we had to stand very close together and pretend that closeness was the room itself, the air did that slip, that sly sideways shuffle, like someone had moved a mirror and not told me. I felt him\u2014the other, the brother I would not call brother in case he decided to move in with his furniture\u2014standing where an understudy stands when he is not understudying a position but a feeling. The back of my neck cooled. The note in the harmony line tucked itself under my tongue and waited. \u201cAgain,\u201d said Marta, and we were all again, and if you want a definition of magic you could do worse.\n\nOn Thursday, they put the coat on me for the first time and it did that ridiculous thing clothes do sometimes where they make you into the person they thought you were when they were bits of fabric on a table. The shoulders said stand up. The hem said here is your gravity. The cut said yes you are allowed to own a body. Tim laughed at my face because I had that expression men get in shops when a garment does not betray them, and he said, \u201cDon\u2019t get used to it, we are only borrowing handsome,\u201d and I wanted to tell him about all the times I had lived on borrowed handsome and how this felt like the first time it was going to pay us back, but there isn\u2019t time in a day like that for a monologue.\n\nThat afternoon, during a run that was more like a stagger but had moments of flight, Marta called a break and pulled me aside with two fingers. \u201cWhen you sing the second line of the second verse,\u201d she said, \u201cyou leave yourself. I want you in it. I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s better without you, I want you at the centre of your own noise.\u201d It was the sort of note that made me want to take her home in my pocket and feed her stew. I nodded and said, \u201cYes,\u201d and she said, \u201cNo, say I will do that,\u201d which is different and is what an adult is for. I will do that, I said, and in the next run I did the opposite of leaving myself. I planted my breath and I watched my mouth shape the words and I felt the St Christopher on my skin like the small coin that proves you did the laundry. There was a slice of mischief at the edge of the light, a little shimmer like a hand waving from a carriage, and I ignored it in the way you ignore a good dog begging for a chip because you know someone who doesn\u2019t have as good a dog will give them one. The note stayed. The room agreed to be mine for the bar.\n\nThe going-away turned out to be two goings-away. There was leaving Lancaster, which felt like moving out of a coat you were still wearing. There was leaving the part of me that used to think he would get found out if he spoke too loudly. Both were messy and neither was dignified and I have no intention of providing a cleaner version for posterity. I kissed the lintel of my flat like a drunk Catholic and I put my key on the hook like a man who will borrow his own house back at Christmas. I sent Mum seventeen texts in an hour and then deleted five for being silly. I told Laura I would send her a picture every time I saw a kettle that wasn\u2019t mine and she told me to stop being soppy and then sent me three pictures of kettles she had found on Google with faces drawn on them. I took Soup a packet of dog treats I had no right to buy and left them with a note at my dad\u2019s because he was at work and I was feeling brave in tiny ways he might not notice.\n\nThe first city on the tour was Newcastle and it greeted us like an aunt who had run down the path in her slippers. The river lay like a lazy blade and the bridges acted like they had been put there for no other reason but to make us cry about human ingenuity. The theatre smelled of dust and lemon and someone else\u2019s nerves. We signed in with a felt pen that didn\u2019t quite want to, we were shown to dressing rooms that had seen more admissions and less denial than most churches, and I stood in front of my mirror and arranged my face into the sort of expression you give yourself when you are not yet the person you need to be and you are making an appointment to meet him. Naima hummed a run that told me a joke in a key I wanted to learn. Kit spun his hat on his finger and pretended it was the plot. Marta did the rounds like a vicar who knows the names of all your sins and still wants you in her congregation. Tim grinned at me like the man who lets you off detention because he saw you not do the thing you shouldn\u2019t have done.\n\nOn the second night a flu, upper-case F, took the man whose hat I am allowed to wear if his head won\u2019t, and the call came down the corridor in that very specific tone that means we all get to find out whether our boast about learning our lines in the bath was a boast or a prophecy. I had my shirt on and my trousers half on and the St Christopher in my mouth because I was using my teeth to fix the clasp without unhooking my brain, and Del put his hand on my shoulder and said, \u201cIt\u2019s you, mate,\u201d as if he was asking me to hold his ladder. The body has a setting for this and mine found it. I did the quiet panic, which is a very efficient thing once you have taught it not to spill. I let my hands do all the things they had practised in rooms with better air-conditioning. I said the little prayer you say to the floorboards\u2014be there\u2014and then I walked into a light that was not as cruel as it looked.\n\nWhat they forget to tell you about going on for someone else is that the audience can smell it. They get a whiff of change and their instincts stand up in their seats like dogs at a window. The company can smell it too and most of them love you for it\u2014most of them, most nights. I sang my first line and the room agreed as if we had all shaken hands before and forgotten. In verse two, the place where Marta had told me I tend to leave myself, I made a strong decision to be present to the level of irritating. I did not allow my head to run at the speed it fancies. I watched my breath like a kinder ghost. At the end of the bar, the shimmer came and went like a man at a bus stop who thinks each bus is his and then remembers he is on the wrong side of the road. A light did a small flutter which probably only three people in the stalls noticed and I think all three of them were men who have a favourite screwdriver. I finished the verse inside my ribs. There was the briefest sensation\u2014like the ones I had around the Priory and on the motorway\u2014of something moving past me with both kindness and intent. \u201cHello,\u201d I thought, stupidly, kindly, to the ether, and if it answered it did it in a language my ears will learn later.\n\nAfter, in the sort of corridor where girls with better hair than me have cried into tissues, Naima pressed her forehead into the side of my head in a gesture that would look unromantic in a photograph and is the most intimacy I have ever felt in a busy building. \u201cYou did it,\u201d she said, not whispering because she respects a room, and Kit said, \u201cNever do it again so well because then they\u2019ll make you do it on purpose,\u201d and Tim slapped the top of the piano with his two hands like a man who is pleased with his own children. Marta took my face in both her hands and looked at me with the relief a woman permits herself when she has backed a horse and it has crossed a line she had the patience to define. \u201cYou stayed,\u201d she said, and that is a love letter in any language.\n\nThe stage door afterwards had the usual small crowd of people who think perhaps that if they can catch you between two versions of yourself they will find the one who will give them a better story to take home. I signed three programmes and one piece of a bus ticket and a woman asked me to write To Louise, you are my reason, and I laughed a tiny bit and said, \u201cYou sure,\u201d and she said, \u201cWrite it,\u201d as if I was arguing against gravity. A man said, \u201cI saw you on the telly,\u201d and I said, \u201cI saw me on the telly too,\u201d and we both grinned in that watery way of men who aren\u2019t going to discuss their actual feelings at a back door. Then the air did its thing, because of course it did, in a place that is a corridor on purpose, and the security light clicked in the way security lights click when they are trying to figure out whether a moth is a person. A lad from the scene dock looked up and over my shoulder and frowned, the now-familiar check of the eye. \u201cMate,\u201d he said, to nothing and everything, \u201cyou can\u2019t come through this way,\u201d and then he laughed to himself because of course he was talking to a draft. I touched the St Christopher. I felt my own neck under my hand. I went to the pub with the two people who, by the end of the week, would know how I like my tea and when to tell me to shut up.\n\nNews got back to Lancashire faster than a rumour in a smoking shelter. Morris texted a photo of The Otter\u2019s telly with a grainy picture of me in the coat under a caption that said: OUR LAD in chalk letters too big for the board. Mum rang and didn\u2019t ring because she was squealing and we both agreed that breathing would be a good plan for the next three minutes and then we could attempt syllables again. Dad sent a message that said, Saw you. Good. which is Shakespeare in our language. Laura sent a video of her and Shaz and half the pub jumping up and down like people in an advert for lager and then a second video of herself alone in the kitchen, whispering into her phone, \u201cProud, now go to bed,\u201d because she knew the adrenaline would try to put me on a train to the moon.\n\nBy the end of Newcastle I had learned a few things about being plural in public that you can\u2019t teach yourself in a small city. I learned that walking through a city where you have not yet made yourself known will always feel different to walking through one where your voice has already bounced off its walls. I learned that talking to strangers at a stage door uses up the same bit of your music as singing and must be rationed like good bread. I learned that, if you feel him at your shoulder and you stand up straighter rather than turning to see, he will stay polite. And I learned that there are cities where the shimmer rides you like a second coat and cities where it refuses to get off the train.\n\nSheffield was coats and chips and a hill that assumed we would get over it. The theatre there had the kind of backstage that is made of corridors that disagree with each other, and in three different ones I felt that peculiar moment of double occupancy, like a bench halfway through a park trying to decide whether to be damp. Naima told me, in a tone like telling the weather, that when she was a kid in Tower Hamlets she used to hear her nan call her when her nan was still in the bath, and she had just assumed everyone who loved you had two voices in order to double their chances of being obeyed. Kit told me swears in Polish taught him by a drummer that were so effective they made a light bulb in the dressing room flicker, and then we had to stand on chairs and coax it back into good behaviour by pretending to know about fuses. In a caf\u00e9 where the coffee tasted like effort and kindness, a woman with hands that looked like she had lifted three children with each one leaned over and told me to eat more bread and I did, which felt like listening to God.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t all theatre. In Leeds, on my day off, I took the microphone my father had bought me to the little studio behind the shop that sells records even in the year of our lord where records are a metaphor, and I tried it with someone else\u2019s gear. The sound of me came back and I didn\u2019t hate him. I sent Dad a clip, holding my phone slightly away like a man bringing a baby to a bar. He sent back another thumbs up which in our vocabulary was a hug in a bad suit. I nearly called him then because we were already in the city of his current couch and nothing bad would happen if I made two men eat chips and talk about football while making very sure never to say the thing we were there to say. In the end I didn\u2019t because the day did that sprint where it shows you all the things you could do and then makes you do the one you usually do, which in my case was roaming a market to see what my mouth fell in love with and what my hands could afford.\n\nThe shimmer sometimes made itself into small acts of kindness that were either magic or other people being better than we deserve. In a caf\u00e9 in a city I was still getting the prepositions for, I went to pay and the woman behind the counter said, \u201cIt\u2019s on the house,\u201d and when I said why she said, \u201cBecause you look like a man who is carrying his other self in his pocket,\u201d and I laughed in a way that made her laugh and then I paid anyway because I am my mother\u2019s son. In a chemist that smelled of both clean and sadness, a boy at the till double-charged me and then blushed while correcting it, and when he gave me the refund he said, \u201cI thought there were two of you and now there is one,\u201d and then looked mortified as if he had just announced that he had swallowed a bee. In my hotel room in Sunderland the bedside lamp clicked on at three-oh-eight and I said, \u201cNo,\u201d and it clicked off, and I lay there and practised the sort of authority that doesn\u2019t get given back.\n\nThe thing about tour is that days learn to look like each other and then you put a different name at the top of them and pretend. We travelled with a little silent animal of exhaustion that asks for nothing and takes what it needs. We learnt to sleep in chairs and we learnt to sleep in twenty-minute bites and we learnt to make jokes that would be unacceptable under normal oxygen. We took turns being the person who cared about breakfast. We took turns being the person who cried in the shower because he missed a river that was doing the right kind of brown. In Nottingham, Naima lost her voice and then found it again half an hour before curtains in the bottom of a mug of disgusting tea that Tim made in the way only a man who has no respect for plants can. In Birmingham, Kit went on a date with a boy who had a laugh like a broken trampoline and we all debriefed him as if it had been a mission to Mars. In Manchester, a light over the second wing hummed in a way that made the stage manager throw his clipboard at it and then pretend he hadn\u2019t. In Liverpool, I swear that a woman in the second row who had my mother\u2019s hands had come in for the last number and sat down just long enough to hear me and then left, and when I told Mum she said, \u201cI didn\u2019t leave the house, love. My slippers held me hostage,\u201d and then sent a picture of Rachel looking smug and the pelargoniums looking like they were practising for their show.\n\nBy week four, the feeling of him with me stopped making my skin pretend to be a bird and became the sort of weight your coat has in winter when you\u2019re glad of it. It didn\u2019t make me lazy and it didn\u2019t make me brave; it made me careful, which is sometimes what bravery is wearing when it goes out in daylight. I learned when to ask him politely to take the bins out. I learned when to say, this is my verse. I learned to say, not here, when the wing felt crowded and my knees were already doing their little interpretation of an old man\u2019s day. I learned to text Laura even when I had nothing to say because the act of sending a message to a person who will read it when you are on a train you do not recognize is one of the little versions of faith that keep the world correct.\n\nWe came back to London for a week in a theatre that is older than half the arguments I have had with myself. Conrad was there in the foyer with his good suit and his good teeth pretending to make conversation with a man who looked at him like a catalogue. \u201cJacob,\u201d he said, and I said, \u201cMr Conrad,\u201d because I am not above using a title to remind a man of his own name. He offered me concepts and windows and I offered him a schedule and a throat and we both smiled like we were talking about weather. He said he could make this be more and I said more what and he did that important little laugh that means nothing and everything. Naima nodded at me from down the corridor with eyebrows that said don\u2019t. Tim made a noise in his throat like a piano stool being moved. I took the card again and put it in the pocket with the saint and the lip balm and the little laminated picture of a man trying to hold up too large a ship, and I thought, you can be the man who takes me somewhere one day if you say please in a language I speak.\n\nOn the Wednesday of that week, after a matinee where an entire school had decided to practise their future cheering, I walked out of the stage door into a patch of sun and felt, clearly, not frighteningly, like someone had walked out with me at the exact same pace. It wasn\u2019t a shadow because shadows are obedient even when the light isn\u2019t. It wasn\u2019t a trick of a window because there weren\u2019t any. It wasn\u2019t tiredness because tiredness is heavy and this was light. The door clicked. The street did its people. A woman pushing a buggy glanced up in that way that has become our punchline and then, very simply, because she was herself, she smiled and said, \u201cAll right, lads,\u201d and pushed on. I laughed, which is to say I refused to invent a shape that wasn\u2019t there, and I tucked the medal back under my shirt, because tucking is ritual and ritual is how a man who needs to know which parts of himself he can put on and take off learns to be present in the bit where he lives.\n\nWhen we got our first week off, a space opened that felt like the inside of a mussel shell. The tour wore off me and the town wore back on. The river did its slate thing and the bus misjudged its huff and the man with the cap lifted two fingers twice and then three times because he forgot the math of greeting. The Priory sat in the weather like a good dog. The Blue Otter smelled right. Stacey the cat was back on the board as FOUND even though she was in fact making a nuisance of herself under the bench. Mrs T knocked with lasagne that had elected to be vegetarian this week because she had read something about arteries and made it sound like a thing you could bargain with. Mum\u2019s pelargoniums were gossiping in new voices. We sat with stew and I told her about Tim and Marta and coats and the way theatres in different cities ask for different vowels. She told me about Margaret at the post office and her new habit of making everyone sign for things twice to keep her handwriting strong. She told me Rachel had learned to sit on the telly at the exact spot where the weather appears so that we would not be tempted to be glum about rain. We watched a crime show where everyone hissed and then spoke louder and then whispered again. She looked, three times in the space of an hour, to my left not because she had decided anything but because the body learns where to put its courtesy.\n\nBefore I left again, she got out the calendar and circled three dates that were not the ones I had told her about because she thinks some days need to be noticed more than others regardless of their plans. \u201cPut your rocket here,\u201d she said, pencil poised, and I did, obedient to the language of our kitchen. In the doorway she straightened my coat like the coat was a concept that could be improved by love. \u201cOne more thing,\u201d she said, as if we hadn\u2019t been doing nothing but things since I was born. \u201cIf he is there when you sing\u2014and I think sometimes he is\u2014let him sing with you. Not because you need him to but because he might need to. Kindness costs you nothing. And make sure you eat. You go thin when you\u2019re being two people.\u201d I left with a bag that was heavier by two Tupperware, one scarf, and an instruction about compassion I had no right to ask for and every intention of practising.\n\nOn the platform at Lancaster Station, the train did its shudder and the speakers did their apology. A boy with a scooter held it like a girlfriend. There was a fox on the embankment with the kind of mean gorgeous face that makes you think he has a schedule that doesn\u2019t include you. I stood with my bag at my feet like a dog that pretended not to understand language and I said, as modestly as a man who is about to ask the air to behave can say anything, \u201cPresent.\u201d The feeling that came wasn\u2019t the corridor. It wasn\u2019t the off. It was the simple pressure of being held by the world exactly where I stood, no more and no less, which is all you can ask for whether you are one person or two. When the train arrived, I got on. I turned and waved because that is what you do. Mum waved back, her hand small and brave in the cold March light. For a heartbeat and a half, there were two hands, one to the left of the line of glass and one to the right, both of them hers, both of them mine, and then the carriage moved and we all leaned into the fact of it like smart people. The river slid and kept sliding. The pelargoniums, back on their steps, listened to the street like old women. I sat down. I put my hand over the St Christopher. I breathed like a person who had been taught. I let the day do its part.",
