     "novel_text": "On the morning the butcher\u2019s window went blind, Elias Fiske was crouched beneath the blackthorn hedge behind Mrs. Coppin\u2019s cottage, coaxing a teaspoon of warm honey and thyme between the paws of a hare that had mistaken iron for clover. Andover had not yet properly shaken the chill from its bones; a gray fleece lay over the town, and the Anton stream moved low and glass-green along its cut chalk banks. The hedges smelled of dew and cold mud. Elias talked as he worked, not to the hare but to the cat standing on his shoulder as if it were a prow.\n\n\u201cHold steady, Quill,\u201d he said. \u201cOne more drop and the tongue will remember it belongs inside the mouth.\u201d\n\nQuill\u2019s tail whisked him on the nose. \u201cIt isn\u2019t the hare, old man,\u201d the cat said, voice a frostbitten whisper so it wouldn\u2019t spook the small patient. \u201cIt\u2019s you who forgets. Humans, I\u2019ve noticed, a great fondness for letting bits go wandering. Keys. Tempers. Whole lives.\u201d\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t mislaid my life,\u201d Elias said mildly. He set down the spoon, pried the bit of iron free\u2014some child\u2019s nail, rusted thin\u2014and murmured a comfort to seal the blood. The hare\u2019s eyes settled, its breath gentled. Elias stroked its ears until it trembled only a little and then sprang, anxious, slick-bellied, into the hedge. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not iron that calls me,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s work.\u201d\n\nQuill transferred from shoulder to satchel with a spring and a flap. He was lean as a one-word answer and striped like a half-remembered song. \u201cIt will be a day for it,\u201d the cat said, staring down the lane as if he could see what the thickening morning mist was trying to hide. \u201cPeople are telling stories. I\u2019ve counted three already getting born in the last ten minutes. Two without fathers.\u201d\n\n\u201cStories breed,\u201d Elias said, wiping his hands on his coat. The coat had seen better days. It had seen days it would never speak of to anyone. He straightened and squinted toward High Street. \u201cLet\u2019s see who needs a broom.\u201d\n\nThe butcher\u2019s window, when they reached it, looked as if it had been shut in on a thundercloud. Fat words and bruised smears had unrolled from the top sash and pooled against the slate. The usual neat row of fleck-white rabbits, pink trotters, parcels tied with string and bald knuckles of beef had disappeared behind a blackened gloss. When Elias put his face to the glass to peer through, the words smeared there clung to his breath and shivered like fish under ice.\n\n\u201cDo you mind,\u201d Mrs. Hardesty snapped, appearing at his elbow with a wiping cloth as if she meant to scour his cheek. \u201cI\u2019ve enough trouble with this muck without your steaming it. And don\u2019t you come near my sausages.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t planning to,\u201d Elias said. He stood back and bowed a little\u2014old habit; he\u2019d grown up with the Hardestys\u2019 shouts in his ear and their butcher\u2019s paper under his nose. \u201cMay I look?\u201d\n\nMrs. Hardesty sniffed. Her cap was crooked and the color in her cheeks had been painted there by fury. \u201cYou\u2019ll do more than look or I\u2019ll have you\u2014what do wizards get? Fined? Hanged?\u201d\n\n\u201cTea,\u201d Elias said thoughtfully. \u201cOr a biscuit, if the work\u2019s hard.\u201d He put his hand flat upon the glass. The words under his palm quivered. They had weight and grain to them, the oily insistence of ink left long enough to dry into the skin. He could make out letters now that the light was coming up: liar, fiend, children, from the blood. Andover made a low sound in his ear then, old brick and chalk and pig-iron, the faint groan of rope over a pulley. His town had a voice if you listened and didn\u2019t tell anyone you could. It sounded weary and short-tempered before breakfast. A man clearing his throat and not much more.\n\nQuill leaped neatly onto the window frame and put one paw into the ink. He drew it out again quickly, shaking off glossy drops. \u201cPfft,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s not from ink. Or it is, but not the sort from your little bottles. That\u2019s printed malice. Binding. You smell it?\u201d\n\nElias did. Under the butcher\u2019s familiar tang\u2014the iron of blood, the sweet rot of fat and aging sawdust\u2014there was the sharp naphthalene-apple stink of new pamphlets. He took his hand from the window and the letters slopped against the place his palm had been, trying not to let go, but his touch had been light and he knew how to slip politely from a trouble. He turned to Mrs. Hardesty. \u201cWho did you call first? The church? Constable?\u201d\n\n\u201cI called nobody,\u201d she said, and then flicked a glance to the line of waiting people behind him. The line, which had been very still and unwilling to meet Elias\u2019s eye, shifted. \u201cWell. I sent my Willy for the vicar. Willy hasn\u2019t been back. It\u2019s your mess. You did it. It says so right there.\u201d She jabbed her cloth at the words.\n\n\u201cDoes it,\u201d Elias murmured. He put his head close to the glass again until his own face appeared behind the ink as a gray ghost. He saw the letters more clearly now. Their edges were not ragged like spilled ink should be; they were crisp, set like type. The words slid when he looked, trying to be something else: slaughterer, corruptor, worm in the belly of the town. He had the sensation of the window speaking to him but not with its own tongue. A man\u2019s voice, soft and amused, licking at the syllables as they turned round.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen this work,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce. Far east of here. In a little place whose name I don\u2019t intend to remember.\u201d He glanced at Quill. \u201cAre there any prints?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhich sort?\u201d Quill\u2019s ears were flat. \u201cFoot or thumb?\u201d\n\n\u201cFeather,\u201d Elias said. He shook his head as if to clear it of the voice, though it had already gone, sliding away into the wet like a rat. \u201cLook for a crow\u2019s-foot. Corner, if it\u2019s properly done.\u201d\n\nThe cat slunk along the sill, careful not to let any more of the black touch him, and peered at the meeting of glass and wood. He sniffed, sneezed, lifted a whisker the way he lifted a sword when a mouse needed its pride pricked. \u201cThere,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the left lower corner. Three scratches and a dot. Like someone signed with a bird.\u201d\n\nElias felt the town shiver under his boots, a thud down the length of the street as if the bell had rung but only inside people\u2019s bones. He curled his fingers and wanted a mug in them, wanted heat. \u201cWe\u2019ll pull this down,\u201d he said, raising his voice so the line could hear and not hear. \u201cIt won\u2019t break the glass. No one will smash anything. This is only ink trying to be a story.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is a story,\u201d muttered a man behind him. He had the look of a man who had been told something shocking in the dark and had had to walk home with his hands in his pockets and the shocking thing like a lantern in his mouth. \u201cSaid you did a thing with old Mr. Crisp\u2019s daughter. Said you\u2014\u201d His voice ran out and his face went pink. \u201cSorry, Elias. I shouldn\u2019t. It\u2019s\u2026 it says it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not true,\u201d Elias said. He didn\u2019t say it sharply. You couldn\u2019t beat a story by shouting at it. He breathed out, and his breath made the black crawl again, and he spoke a word you would not find in a book because it wasn\u2019t written anywhere. It belonged to Andover and to the chalk under Andover and to the old law of a place that would not be humiliated by paper. It was a word that woke a broommaid in a cottage kitchen at the edge of town, ten miles from there, and made her think suddenly to scrub the hearth. It made a boy remember he had forgotten to shut the gate on the sheep. It made the dog turn thrice and lie down on the right side of the rug. It was a word of tidying up.\n\nThe ink flinched.\n\n\u201cAgain,\u201d Quill murmured.\n\nElias said the word again, softer. He felt it go out, like a rill of water down a slight slope, into the gutters and the wells. The ink drew back from his hand as if it didn\u2019t want to be touched by something so dull and domestic. \u201cSweep,\u201d he said, and \u201cset to rights,\u201d and \u201cenough,\u201d and the butcher\u2019s wife shuddered, and the boy at the end of the line started to cry without knowing why, and the window cleared as if someone were rolling up a blind. Ink gathered itself reluctantly into the corners and became a clotted spider, which skittered off into the morning.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about that,\u201d Elias told Mrs. Hardesty as she flinched. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t bite anything with a backbone.\u201d He was lying but he expected the spider would like best to disappear in a drain and mope.\n\nThe line exhaled. People came briskly to life with the shock of relief that was almost anger. \u201cIf there\u2019s any of it on my sausages\u2014\u201d Mrs. Hardesty began, but the words died away; she was looking at Elias as if she had never seen him before. \u201cWho would do such a thing?\u201d she said softly. \u201cTo my window? To our town?\u201d\n\n\u201cSomeone poor in stories,\u201d Quill answered. He was twisting his paw delicately, wiping it on the lapel of Elias\u2019s coat with exact malice. \u201cSomeone who only has the kind that rot from the inside.\u201d\n\nElias rubbed the back of his neck where the hairs had stiffened. The word he had said was still going about its business. You didn\u2019t want to overdo a thing like that or the town would be too tidy to bear. He looked up and down High Street. Every doorway had collected a listener. Faces like clocks with two fingers pointing different ways. He felt the weight of his own name on these people\u2019s tongues and it made a private ache down the center of his sternum, as if someone had pressed a thumb there and had not taken it away.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a mark,\u201d he said carefully. \u201cA dare. If you see anything like that\u2014\u201d He flicked a look. The three scratches and a dot were gone. He had expected that. \u201c\u2014you\u2019ll tell me. Don\u2019t read it. Or if you must read it, don\u2019t believe it. It\u2019s like walking over river ice: you can, but you\u2019ll come home wet and cold and it was only foolishness.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho?\u201d someone asked. \u201cWho is it?\u201d And the repetition came like sparrows from the eaves: who, who, who. Andover was not a small town but it could make itself small when it felt afraid.\n\nElias did not say a name, not because he did not have one in his mouth but because some names liked the air too much. He nodded to Mrs. Hardesty, and she nodded back, and the world made a tiny clack as a cog took a tooth. Work to do. Sausages to sell. People began to talk at once, and Quill leaped down and trotted before Elias like a banner.\n\nThey turned the corner into Scanner\u2019s Yard and found a pamphlet tied to Elias\u2019s blue door with string.\n\nIt looked as if the hedgerows had shed a skin in the night and someone had gathered it and made something flat of it and beaten it with the truth until it forgot the wild. It had sprigs along the margin like the small weeds that grow in paper, not because someone drew them but because the plant had not been entirely convinced it was dead. The title was in thick black, and it smiled at him with every tooth.\n\nThe Sorcerer of Andover Eats Children.\n\n\u201cDoes he,\u201d said Elias. His voice did not shake. He untied the string and held the pamphlet like a fish that he intended to return to the water unhurt. He opened it. The smell of it came off the pages in a sick-sweet breath.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Quill said sharply. \u201cThere\u2019s a burr inside. It\u2019s set to catch.\u201d\n\n\u201cI see it,\u201d Elias murmured. \u201cHold your tongue. If I miss it, tell me which way I bled.\u201d He thewed through the first paragraph with the kind of attention he would give to a ditch in darkness. The sentences were almost right. Almost true. He had\u2014for instance\u2014lived here since he was six, and yes, Mrs. Coppin had given him bread on Thursdays, and yes, he had once chased a badger out of a cellar with a broom. But the badger had not spoken to him with Mr. Crisp\u2019s daughter\u2019s voice and he had not\u2014and here the words turned like a worm in a hand\u2014worn a mask made from the skin of a child. The pamphlet was a map of a place that was Andover and not, with streets that led where they should but came out into rooms that smelled of pigs when they should have smelled of clean bed linen. It was the kind of story that crawled you and left little grit trails behind your eyes.\n\n\u201cEnough,\u201d Quill said. \u201cHe\u2019s signed it in the colophon. Look.\u201d\n\nElias turned to the last page. The mark was there in the tiny print, three scratches and a dot, and also the name. It wasn\u2019t a true name. Wizards had those, some of them kept in folded paper under the mattress of someone they trusted. It was a name chosen and worn in daylight. Vellum Crowe.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d Elias said. His coffee he\u2019d meant to go home and make had gone suddenly very necessary and very far away. He looked up and saw across the Yard the face of Hester Stowe in her window, chin tucked in the heel of her hand, watching. Hester had been eight the last time the river overran the bank and had followed Elias stoutly in bare feet while he spoke to the Anton and told it it was not time yet. He smiled at her in the ordinary way and she gave him an ordinary smile back. The ordinary had become very dear in an instant.\n\n\u201cWhat do you do?\u201d Quill asked. He was too quiet. He was never quiet when he was frightened. It was his vanity; he believed fear made him stupid and he hated that.\n\n\u201cTea,\u201d Elias said automatically. \u201cBiscuits. We promised Mrs. Coppin to look at her chimney after dinner.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat order makes no sense,\u201d Quill said, relieved to be cross. \u201cMilk first.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt does,\u201d Elias said. \u201cIt does enough. Do you know why he sent this to my door?\u201d He took in a breath of the smell of the pamphlet and let it go. He could see the burr quivering in it, set like a nettle almost under the skin of the words. He folded it carefully and set it on the sill. It would not go off yet. \u201cHe wants me to come to him. He\u2019ll lay down a trail of hurt and filth until I do. He likes the walk better than the meeting.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen don\u2019t go,\u201d Quill said at once. \u201cSit. Roll yourself up in a blanket. Let me bite anyone who knocks.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not made for the hearth,\u201d Elias said, but not unkindly. He pushed open the door and they went in. The house smelled of sage and floor wax. There were small bags hung on the pegs by the door\u2014sprigs of lavender, a twist of iron filings, a length of plaited hair he didn\u2019t remember making but he knew he had. He set water to boil and put bread on a plate and two lumps of sugar because sometimes, after a blow, there was nothing else to be done that would not make it worse. He held his hands to the kettle and watched the steam rise up in muslin threads. He said, to the steam, \u201cHe was waiting, this one. Somewhere damp. Somewhere people don\u2019t go because they get lonely if they do.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnder the viaduct,\u201d Quill suggested.\n\n\u201cNot\u2026 west of us. Not the water meadows. He smells of ink gone moldy. That\u2019s a room whose window never opens. Basement. Or a house shuttered long.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know him?\u201d\n\n\u201cI know his kind.\u201d Elias poured the water over the tea. The smell rose up, golden and brown. He had known many kinds. There were wizards who moved stones with their voices and wizards who took happiness like the top of a soft-boiled egg. Some of them you could talk with. Some you could outlast. There were the wicked and the sad and very many who were both. A man who made up nasty stories about his enemies because he liked to see how the town would turn\u2014he was not the worst. But he was not small either. Nasty stories ate. \u201cHe\u2019ll come for more than my window,\u201d Elias said.\n\n\u201cHe came for your name,\u201d Quill said, and then he started, because something hit the door. Not the door exactly. The air by the door. A soft slapping, like wetted paper thrown at varnish.\n\nElias set down his tea. He did not sigh. He took up his penknife, which had never been nervous about being only a penknife, and went to open the door.\n\nA patch of blackness the size of a dinner plate lurched off the jamb and fluttered at him, all corners. It was not a bird but it wanted to be. It wanted very badly to be. It came at his eyes. He stepped neatly to the side. Quill, who had no intention of letting a piece of ink peck his master to blindness, did something he was not proud of later: he jumped into the air shoulder first and caught the thing. It squealed. The squeal was human, high and pleased in its own pain, and it made Elias\u2019s stomach turn over. He flicked the knife and the thing tore open and fell to the step and lay there shuddering like a heart. It was letters. It was made of words.\n\n\u201cBother,\u201d Elias said, because the little boy across the Yard had appeared in his doorway with his mother\u2019s apron tied round his middle, and Elias had borrowed Bother from that house for so long it had become his. \u201cHe\u2019ll send more of those if we let him think it works.\u201d\n\nQuill spit a letter out of his mouth. It wriggled and went flat and climbed the doorjamb like a bug. \u201cLet him,\u201d the cat said darkly, and then coughed. \u201cApologies. It had an e lodged at the back of my throat. Stupid letter.\u201d\n\n\u201cTake the other door,\u201d Elias said to the letters on the step because it amused him to act as if he wasn\u2019t bothered. He went back inside, shut the door gently and leaned against it. His hands were steady. There were a thousand things to do and every one of them small. He could not go to the basement where Vellum Crowe waited\u2014if it was a basement\u2014with his coat smelling of Hardesty\u2019s shop and his tea growing cold. The answer to a sorcery like this was never a loud one. It was a washing line and a point at its center with a peg.\n\n\u201cWho told you?\u201d Quill asked a minute later when they had their tea and their bread and they sat on the back step looking over the small garden. \u201cThat you\u2019d be the kind of person who cleaned this sort of mess.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou did,\u201d Elias said. \u201cWhen you followed me home from the mill and refused to come in because the doormat said Wipe Your Feet as if it had been drawn by a bully.\u201d\n\nQuill sniffed. \u201cI was a kitten. I thought all rugs were orders.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou do still,\u201d Elias said, and that made Quill smile, which he did with his whiskers. \u201cAlso, my mother. Not with words. She scrubbed the lie out of everything with her day. She applied water and a certain song to it. My father\u2014\u201d He stopped. His father had been less of a shape. A pair of boots by the door. A laugh that could be felt through the floorboards if it was a good laugh, if it was in season.\n\n\u201cEat,\u201d Quill commanded, and Elias did. They finished tea and washed the cups. By then the Yard had emptied into the day, and the sun slid its greasy hair out of its cap and the mist began to burn away. People came by in twos and threes to ask if Elias needed anything and to not look at the pamphlet on the sill. He told them no and thank you and\u2014always\u2014the same thing: if words appear where they should not, call me, do not read them, it will make you ill.\n\nMidday brought Hester Stowe to his door with a handkerchief tied to a stick. \u201cI\u2019m going to beat my brother with it,\u201d she announced, pushing past him into the kitchen. \u201cHe said you ate a child because you were hungry. I told him you eat scones and he said you put glue in the jam so you could catch a fly in it. He said you stole Mr. Crisp\u2019s\u2014\u201d She stopped, seeing the pamphlet, and her mouth went O.\n\nElias took the handkerchief from her gently and untied the knot. Inside was a frog and two copper coins. \u201cI don\u2019t accept frogs as payment,\u201d he said solemnly. \u201cThey hop out of my pocket.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d Hester said, and blinked hard. Her eyes had begun to fill because she had read the word eats and the word children and there was the burr under the skin of the sentence and her body had felt it, not her mind. \u201cElias,\u201d she whispered, and the whisper had in it exactly enough trust to tear a man in two.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m all right,\u201d he said, crouching to be at her height. He always forgot how little most people were, and how tall he had become without meaning to. \u201cIs your brother all right?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s stupid. He has scabs all over his knees and none in his head.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d Elias said. \u201cScabs on knees mean there\u2019s still some honesty in him.\u201d He looked at Quill. \u201cWould you like to show Hester something?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Quill said at once. He did not care for performing. But Hester\u2019s tear had fallen and stuck at the corner of her mouth like a bead and Quill could not bear beads on children, and so he sat up very straight and looked at the frog. \u201cI will require the frog,\u201d he said.\n\nHester presented it. Quill observed it gravely. \u201cMiss Frog,\u201d he said, \u201cyou are safe. And unspectacular. Leap once if this is true, twice if it is not.\u201d The frog leaped once. Quill nodded. \u201cNow. Hester. Leap once if what your brother said is confusing your guts. Twice if it is not.\u201d\n\nHester leaped once without smiling. Then she realized what she\u2019d done and tried very hard not to make a face. Quill flicked an ear. \u201cNow listen to this: Elias and I will not eat you. Not past, not present, not future. Not in books, not in alleys, not in soups. Is any of that false?\u201d\n\nHester held her breath and sipped at the words as if they might be hot. \u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen tell your stupid brother we\u2019ll eat him instead,\u201d Quill said sweetly, and Elias sighed and Hester laughed and the burr he had seen under the pamphlet\u2019s skin came unseated, just a little, and scrabbled and fell away.\n\nWhen Hester had gone, Elias made himself read the pamphlet through to the end. It took an hour. It left a taste like pennies in his mouth for the rest of the day. He followed the stitch-work of the lies and saw the hands that had made them. Not many hands. One careful pair. They had chosen words as if choosing herbs for a medicine that would make the town\u2019s blood thin. They had saved a particular spice for last: at the bottom of the last page, in tiny, fine type that required the angle of a midwife\u2019s gaze to see, was a line that even Quill had missed: It is not safe to look him in the eyes.\n\n\u201cYou clever coward,\u201d Elias said aloud. \u201cYou will want them to look down when they see me.\u201d He put the pamphlet in a drawer, knowing it would shimmy out and follow him when it liked because this was not over. He washed his hands. He finished his work\u2014Mrs. Coppin\u2019s chimney had a bat in it; he told it kindly to move to the eaves; it did\u2014and he let the day go on being a day while somewhere, he knew, Vellum Crowe was making another day into something not entirely itself.\n\nHe dreamt of crows that night. Of course he did. He lay under a sky the exact slate color of the butcher\u2019s window at its worst and watched a flock of black paper tearing itself into pieces and reassembling as a different bird every time. One was a swallow with a stick for a belly. One was a gull with a nail through its head, which bothered it not at all. When he woke, Quill was asleep with his face in Elias\u2019s ear as if he could pour dreams out like water and drink them. Elias lay there quietly because the house was listening, and then set his feet to the floor like a man stepping into a cold stream.\n\nThe morning, which had thought it was going to be ordinary, changed its mind when the second pamphlet arrived and went directly for Mrs. Troon\u2019s baby. Mrs. Troon had been carrying the baby down the slope to the water when a wind rose and flapped at the paper in her apron pocket. She had taken it out and read two lines before she remembered Elias had told her not to. Later she would not be able to recall setting the baby down. She would say she dropped her shawl and the shawl cried, and when she looked up the child sat by the edge of the river with a woman\u2019s face on, a sour-faced woman with a mouth like a knife mark, who was telling the child in a voice thinner than tin that a narrow thing was the same as a safe thing. The child began to scoot without quite crawling toward the water.\n\nHester Stowe, truant and proud of it, was the one who screamed.\n\nBy the time Elias reached the bank, breath ragged, the child had one foot wet, one foot dry, and was peering at his own reflection as if he had a secret. The river was gray and earnest. The pamphlet lay on the grass with its throat open, letting out a smell like pith. Elias scooped the child up and the reflection shrugged and took one of those steps you sometimes see on a ladder when you climb above the roofline and don\u2019t expect it. Elias held the child tight and spoke to the river without raising his voice. He called it by its little name, which the Anton wore only when it turned under Andover Bridge and looked up at the sky for a moment as if it was going to decide whether to go on. \u201cYou\u2019ve misread your orders,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fetch is not for today.\u201d\n\nThe river settled like a big animal deciding not to ask for dinner just yet. The child hiccuped and put his wet foot on Elias\u2019s knee. The sour-faced woman stepped, briefly, onto a stone and then became the stone and then did not exist as a separate thing anymore.\n\n\u201cNow,\u201d Elias said to Mrs. Troon, very gentle because her face had shattered and was in several places at once. \u201cGo home. Remember that the baby was born on a Tuesday. Tuesdays have cleverness. You will need to keep an eye on that.\u201d Mrs. Troon nodded and bobbled the child and went away holding him as if he would otherwise join the boys on the bridge and smoke.\n\nHester went to pick up the pamphlet. Elias stopped her with a glance and a word. She froze. Quill, who had arrived late and furious and still beautiful, paced round the paper with his back arched, making a sound like a kettle at the boil.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t dramatize,\u201d Elias said absentmindedly. He put his penknife into his teeth and unfurled the pamphlet carefully with his fingertips so that not a whisper brushed him. The title was worse, if you could call that possible. The Sorcerer of Andover Whispers In Rivers, Do Not Let Your Children Sleep. \u201cOriginal,\u201d Elias muttered. He pulled a thread from his cuff, a long one; he had been saving it without noticing, and laid it along the seam. The thread was home and will and bread and crumbs and crumbs again. It lay down and went to sleep. The pamphlet did not like that. It twitched and tried to be interesting. The thread was not; it continued to be home. The pamphlet gave up its right to be the most interesting thing on the grass and sighed and lay still.\n\n\u201cGet a box,\u201d Elias said. \u201cSomething with corners. Mrs. Coppin\u2019s old biscuit tin. The one with the lid that sticks.\u201d\n\nThey put the pamphlet in the tin and the tin on the shelf and the shelf under a chair and the chair in front of the door. It was not proper wizard work. It was a grandmother\u2019s work. It turned out to be the right kind.\n\nThe town wrinkled itself all afternoon like a face misfitted. It could not settle. People stopped in the street to shake their heads as if to fling water from their ears. Mr. Crisp\u2019s daughter\u2014who was not the least bit inclined to speak with anyone about anything that was not a real thing in front of her face\u2014crossed to Elias where he was standing by the green and stuck out her hand as if she were shaking his name. \u201cThey can\u2019t take what they haven\u2019t got,\u201d she said. \u201cHere.\u201d She pressed something into his palm. It was a small painted wooden soldier with the paint rubbed off its nose. It had been sad for so long it had become happy again by accident.\n\n\u201cI can use that,\u201d Elias said seriously. He watched her shoulder as she went away and thought about how people made themselves. You learned to wipe your own feet.\n\nBy dusk, the third attack came, and it came not as paper but as people. Four of them, men he knew well enough to borrow a spade from. Their faces had been scuffed. The pamphlets had taken two fingers and a corner off their names and the men hadn\u2019t noticed. They came with their hats off, which was politeness, and with sticks, which was not.\n\n\u201cElias,\u201d the first man said. His name was Tom but the pamphlet had made it Ton and he had not felt the subtraction. \u201cWe\u2019ve been asked to speak to you on the town\u2019s behalf.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho asked you?\u201d Elias said. He stood in his doorway with Quill winding round his ankles like rope.\n\nThe men frowned faintly, as if the question were rude. Tom\u2014Ton\u2014worried his stick. \u201cThe truth,\u201d he said. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t look us in the eyes.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have to,\u201d Elias said. He looked at their hands instead. One of them had a blister where a pen had been held too tight. One had coal dust at the nail. One had a ring that fit too loose. He wanted very badly to send them home to their wives. He did not want to humiliate them. He said, \u201cYou\u2019ve been fed something that doesn\u2019t agree with you. I have a medicine for that. It tastes like tea.\u201d\n\nThe men listened to the word tea with visible relief. It had the right number of vowels. Ton took a breath and then looked furious at himself, as if he had done some small thing extremely well in front of the wrong person. \u201cWe\u2019re not fools,\u201d he said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t read that\u2014\u201d He stopped because he had, he had read it twice, once for himself and once for a version of himself with his thumb in his mouth.\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d Elias said. He opened the door wider. \u201cCome in. You can lean the sticks by the stove. It doesn\u2019t mind sticks.\u201d He let them pass because he was Andover and they were Andover and there was a sort of magic in that which had nothing of wands and light in it. He gave them tea. He told them the story of a fish that had swallowed a ring and then spat it up in a puddle and how the ring had rolled to the door of a woman who had been looking for a sign. He told it badly. They listened and sipped and some of the nasty story in them sloughed away because ordinary stories had teeth too.\n\n\u201cWhat are we going to do,\u201d Ton said at last, eyes on his cup. \u201cIf there are papers in the street saying we are the sort who cannot tell?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will be the sort who can,\u201d Elias said. \u201cAnd we will be the sort who keep going to the shop for bread with our heads up. There will be more of it before there is less. Bring me anything a crow has scratched.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you,\u201d Ton said, eyes lifting just enough. \u201cWhat will you do?\u201d\n\n\u201cI will make up a story of my own,\u201d Elias said. \u201cIt will be slow, because it will be true. But it will go through your house and not break a cup. It will remind you where you put your boots. It will sit at the foot of your bed in the night and when you wake, it will be gone and you will keep the shape of it.\u201d He smiled. \u201cAlso, I will find him. Ink doesn\u2019t keep a man.\u201d He held up the painted soldier. \u201cHe\u2019s north of here.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy,\u201d Quill muttered, \u201cdo you always say north as if it\u2019s an ache in your left shoulder.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause that\u2019s where the ache is,\u201d Elias said.\n\nThe men went home politely and did not leave their sticks. They had forgotten them. Elias set the sticks against the wall where they wouldn\u2019t trip anyone and closed the door and leaned his head against it. He did not open the drawer where the pamphlet lay. He did not throw up. He was not a hero when he was most useful; he was only himself and there were days when that had to be enough.\n\n\u201cHe wants you outside the town,\u201d Quill said. \u201cHe wants you somewhere he can say is not you, not yours.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe wants me in a room with no window and a floor you can wash until the boards wear through,\u201d Elias said. His voice did an odd thing then. It sounded like his father\u2019s when his father remembered a song halfway through the second verse and the song forgot him back. \u201cI will go where he wants,\u201d he added softly. \u201cBut not like that. And not yet.\u201d\n\nHe did not sleep much that night. Andover did, though; it lay down and wore its winter face and snored. The town dreamed of a harvest that had already been brought in and a storm that would not break the thatch. It dreamed no dreams with letters in.\n\nThe morning made a joke of being fine. A sky as clear as water held up the houses. Elias set his hand on the bricks of his doorway and felt the place purr. He took a small bag, the painted soldier, three lengths of string, his penknife and a biscuit he had not earned. Quill jumped into the bag and then out again and decided to go without the indignity.\n\n\u201cWhere,\u201d Quill said. \u201cSay you. Say it with your mouth.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will start at the bookbinder\u2019s,\u201d Elias said. \u201cMagdalene Plum saw a mark like that once. She won\u2019t tell me she did. She will tell me she did not not. Then we will go north. Not far. Not fast. We will step from harmless to less harmless to unkind to cruel. We will keep stepping. We will set ourselves on the ground like a fact.\u201d\n\n\u201cLike a pebble you can\u2019t get out of your shoe,\u201d Quill said approvingly. He waved his tail at the door as if it were an audience. \u201cBack soon,\u201d he told the lintel. \u201cOr not.\u201d\n\nMagdalene Plum\u2019s shop was not a shop so much as a long sigh with shelves in it. Paper lived here. It did not have to strain to keep still; Magdalene had a way of telling it to behave just with her throat. She looked up when Elias came in. She had the kind of face that had never been ungenerous and never would be. \u201cI will not mend a slander,\u201d she said without greeting.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not asking you to,\u201d Elias said. He put down the painted soldier and then took it up again because it had become dearer to him every time it crossed air. \u201cI need the smell.\u201d\n\nMagdalene\u2019s nostrils flared delicately, as if she had just been offered something she could not tell at a glance was a treat or a trap. \u201cIt\u2019s the same. Worse paper. Cheaper ink. Sign of a man who chooses cost over comfort because he thinks the discomfort proves his seriousness.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Elias said. \u201cAlso he has a scar.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe all have scars.\u201d Magdalene\u2019s eyes were dark as mischief. \u201cI suppose you want me to tell you where it was made. I suppose you want it brought to hand like a cake.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot cake,\u201d Elias said. \u201cBread.\u201d\n\n\u201cHm,\u201d she said, because she recognized the spell he was asking for and objected to it on principle. \u201cIt\u2019s below the school. In the old rooms where they kept the maps and the poor noise. The paper came up the road with a man who ought not have walked it. He wore his boots thin trying to keep quiet. He had a crow. It isn\u2019t really a crow. It\u2019s the habit of a crow\u2014the bit that loves bright, hateful bits\u2014and he feeds it pins.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Elias said, meaning it twice. \u201cDo you know him?\u201d\n\n\u201cI know what he reads,\u201d Magdalene said. \u201cHe reads instructions on how to be important.\u201d She bent to pick up a book and spoke to it as if it had whistled at her. \u201cHe reads lists. Mostly he reads the shape of his own mouth. Go with care. Do not let him make you into a litany. He will put numbers on you if he can.\u201d She lifted her head and the softness was gone. \u201cIf you come back with less of your name I will keep the remainder safe for you,\u201d she said. \u201cEven if it is only the dot.\u201d\n\n\u201cKeep the dot,\u201d Elias said. \u201cThat\u2019s the piece men miss. Thank you.\u201d\n\nOutside, the street was bent in the shape of an arrow pointing north. It had always been bent that way. Elias had not always been willing to see it. He and Quill walked the length of it and no one stopped them. The town loomed behind and then merely stood there, its little windows looking into its little rooms, making soup of its life. The school on the northern edge had been a scandal when it was next to new; the builders had run off with the money and the roof was wrong and the boys had learned to recite multiplication tables exactly loudly enough to drown the drip in the back corridor. Elias and Quill went round to the side where the slate fell green and the moss kept house on the steps.\n\nThe door to the lower rooms was kept with a slat and a promise. Elias unhooked both. The air that breathed out at him was tidy and wrong, as if someone had put all the chairs on the tables and called it truth.\n\n\u201cYou should call him out,\u201d Quill said. \u201cYou should knock and say Come taste your own mouth. You should make him eat it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI should make him come to my kitchen,\u201d Elias said. \u201cThe sky, it turns out, is mine. The water. The inside of my house. Not this. Not yet.\u201d\n\nThey went down the steps. One of the bulbs had burnt out and the others made a noise like a furious fly. The air smelled of wet string and school soups. Elias felt the first thread of Vellum Crowe\u2019s presence like a glove. It slid across his knuckles and then he was wearing it whether he wished or not.\n\nA door stood ajar. Ink lay on the floor in a skin. Someone had tried to leave and had not. Elias stepped carefully around a dark oval that was not a bucket and not a shadow. Quill\u2019s fur stood up in a stripe. \u201cHe sees us,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d Elias said. \u201cLet him. He\u2019s watching from nowhere. This is no one\u2019s house. He has not fed it. It will not keep him.\u201d\n\n\u201cElias Fiske,\u201d said a voice. It was a thin voice taught to be wide. It came from the next room and from the ceiling and from inside the frame of a fake map that had never been a country. It had a smile wrapped up in it for later use. \u201cAndover\u2019s broom. Andover\u2019s boy. Did you like the joke about the window? It made them look at themselves. It made them very clean.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am not a boy,\u201d Elias said, because it was an inexplicable point of pride with him and always had been. \u201cYou\u2019re Vellum Crowe. Or whatever your mother calls you when you\u2019ve been unkind to your dinner.\u201d\n\nSomething moved in the corner of the room, a shadow picking at its nails. \u201cMy mother,\u201d the voice said thoughtfully. \u201cI do not remember what she called me. People remember that sort of thing. I only remember that I was told not to point because I would call things and then what would we do. But here we are. I pointed. What will we do.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe,\u201d Elias said, entering the room and then stopping because he knew a trap when he felt one, \u201cwill sit. You can stand. It\u2019s your mess.\u201d He stood anyway. The room had no chairs; they had been turned into what chairs are when they forget: splinters and rudeness. A press squatted in the corner, proud of its iron. Its handle gleamed from liking hands and the idea of hands. On the wall hung letters cut out of paper and pinned on with steel. The floor had the grit of tears.\n\n\u201cYou think words are air,\u201d Vellum Crowe said, and Elias heard the way he said words, the s in it like a bit of broken glass. \u201cYou think they will sweep if you tell them to because you are a whispering man. Boys who whisper at rivers. Little ones.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think words are the floors we stand on,\u201d Elias said. \u201cAnd the roofs that keep us from getting wet. And the bowls we put soup in. And the names of our daughters in our mouths when we are ill. They are not toys and they are not pins and they are not what you think they are when you stay below the sky.\u201d\n\nThe silence that followed had in it the exact sound of Vellum Crowe glancing at the ceiling and failing to remember what color sky might be. \u201cYou will lose your town,\u201d he said lightly. \u201cThey will eat you and not because they are hungry. Only because it is something to do.\u201d He moved then and stepped into himself and there he was: a narrow man, more colorless than pale, with ink at his cuffs and a ring of powder at his collarbone where he had patted himself to keep from shining with sweat. His hair had tried to be black and had given up. He had chosen his nose as if picking one from a jar, not considering whether it would suit him. His mouth was not the kind you would lend a cup to. He smiled. \u201cIt is already happening,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou sign your papers with a crow\u2019s foot,\u201d Elias said.\n\n\u201cI sign the parts of people that think they\u2019re resistant,\u201d Vellum said. \u201cI make space. I make room between mouths and brains. I give time for people to see their own ideas come walking. Have you never wanted that?\u201d\n\nElias thought of a day ten years ago when he had stood on the bridge and wanted the river to swallow a man who had said his mother had\u2026 he shut the thought away with a shuffle, as you would tuck in a sheet. \u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cNot enough to put my face in it. You do not smell like a basement. You smell like an attic. Did your mother send you up there? Sit with the wasps and old hats. Make up names for them. Come down with a bent back.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will tell me a story to make me into a person people don\u2019t hate,\u201d Vellum said. He leaned sideways and a row of letters leaned with him, charmed. \u201cEveryone thinks he\u2019s a mother. Even cats.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will tell you one,\u201d Elias said, and he felt Quill prick his ankle with one needle of claw: be careful, old man. \u201cSlowly. Later. For now, I will take back what you put in my town. I will pour water on it and let it swell and swell and turn back into pulp and plant and dirt.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will never take it all,\u201d Vellum said, and his mouth did something that wanted to be a chuckle and became a cough. \u201cThey will always remember a part. The bad part. People keep those. They polish with them.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d Elias said, and the knowledge lay heavy and honest between them. \u201cYes. But I will mend and mend. That is my magic. Yours is to break and be entertained. Mine is to feel my hands hurt.\u201d\n\nVellum\u2019s eyes\u2014he had gray eyes, ink washed with rain\u2014narrowed. \u201cWe are not so different. I do not break. I write. The town breaks itself on the reading.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s worse,\u201d Quill said. He had kept still until now. He put his tail high and walked over the floor with terrible daintiness as if he were in another place where there were flowers worth not stepping on. \u201cElias,\u201d he said, \u201cthis smells like a story where the first chapter is someone in a cellar telling themselves they\u2019re right.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt does,\u201d Elias said. He took out the painted soldier and set it on the press. Vellum\u2019s gaze caught on it. A little startled heat rose in his cheeks, a child caught taking apples. Elias did not know what it meant but he knew it well enough to tuck away. \u201cThis is the bit where I tell you what I need. I need you to stop sending paper into the rooms of children. I need you to keep my name out of your mouth.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou cannot take the food from me,\u201d Vellum said. \u201cI eat this.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will give you soup,\u201d Quill offered, deadpan. \u201cBread and soup. A blanket.\u201d\n\n\u201cBe careful,\u201d Vellum said, and now the glass-forward sneer was gone. In its place was something like warning. \u201cI have a picture of you in my pocket in which you are crying. If I let it out\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll make me cry,\u201d Elias said. \u201cYes. And then what. You\u2019ll send a paper around to tell them I cried? They will not mind. They keep vegetables in the cool. I am a man with a hearth. You cannot win that way.\u201d\n\nVellum straightened and the room tightened, as if someone had pulled the cloth of it inward and tied a knot in the middle. He moved his fingers and the letters on the wall pulled themselves off and came like moths, a cloud of barbed edges. They whispered as they came. One of them said liar in Elias\u2019s left ear and one of them said fiend in his right and one of them climbed the side of his neck to tell him for certain of Mrs. Troon\u2019s baby meeting its end by noon without his meddling. He could feel the burrs; he closed his eyes because he would not give them the color of them.\n\nQuill leaped. He was small but you do not have to be large to interfere. He went mouth-open at the letter called fiend and swallowed it with an ugly gulp and spat it out into a corner, where it lay twitching like a centipede. Elias, eyes still shut, reached out and said the word he had said to the window. He said it three times, the last time almost without sound, and the letters lost interest in the thought they had been given and fluttered aimlessly in the beam of the buzzing lights. Vellum hissed between his teeth.\n\n\u201cHousework,\u201d he said contemptuously. \u201cYou sweep. You make dust. You are a small man with a broom. You believe if you tidy enough you will not think about the two days your mother did not come home.\u201d\n\nElias opened his eyes and looked at him and the hurt in the center of him burned a color Vellum would not have a word for if he had all the pamphlets in the world. \u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd yet we will see.\u201d\n\n\u201cGo back,\u201d Vellum said, suddenly sharp, as if he had pricked his own finger on his own pin. \u201cGo back and wait. I have not finished deciding what to call you. If I name you right you will be kindling.\u201d\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t be,\u201d Elias said, and then, because he had been taught not to leave a room without taking something from it to keep it from coming after you, he took a small thing: the dot. The dot at the end of a sentence pinned above the press, forgotten, humble, necessary. He put it in his pocket and felt it settle there like a stone and like a seed. He turned and went out.\n\nOn the steps, north falling away ahead like a question, the sky showing its throat, Quill shook himself hard. Tiny flecks of black came off his whiskers. \u201cHe pricked you,\u201d the cat said.\n\n\u201cHe did,\u201d Elias said. His voice did not shake. It would later. \u201cHe knows where to push. He\u2019s had practice.\u201d\n\n\u201cNorth,\u201d Quill said, peering up out of his own head at the new place where the ache had shifted to. \u201cNot always north.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Elias said. He put his hand in his pocket and touched the period. It was warm. It was ridiculous. It was the end of a sentence without its sentence. It made him smile. \u201cWe\u2019ll go where he thinks we won\u2019t. And we\u2019ll go with both hands. Andover is not a small thing. It is a weight in my mouth. He can go on making nasty stories until his fingers bleed. I\u2019ll learn the bigger ones.\u201d\n\nThey stood there until the bell in the church stepped a chime into the town and the sound went up and came down again, and Elias and his cat set their feet toward home. The town breathed them in and did not choke. The air, for once, said nothing about children in soups. Hester Stowe ran past them with her hair uncombed and did not look away. She waved. She shouted over her shoulder, clear as brass, \u201cMy brother says you made him feel silly. I told him he needed the practice.\u201d Elias waved and the dot in his pocket beat once against his fingers like a heart. He looked at the sky and saw a shape in it that might have been a crow, might have been a piece of scrap blown up and up.\n\n\u201cLet him tell it,\u201d he said aloud, to the sky, to the town. \u201cWe\u2019ll tell a better one.\u201d The day went on and the smell of a bakery came along the street and he told his feet to keep in time with it and not with the voice in his memory saying, do not look them in the eye. He looked everyone in the eye. If it stung, well, tea would help.\n\nThat night he read no pamphlets. He took out the biscuit tin and laid the second one on top of the first, and set a book on them and a stone he had brought home from the river and then his hand, as if blessing bread. Quill slept with his back jammed against Elias\u2019s chest, guarding with his spine. Andover snored again. Somewhere in the rooms below the school a man went on telling himself that the story was the same as the person, that if you got the word right you would own the thing. He would find out otherwise. It would not happen quickly. But it would. And when the morning came, Elias would rise and wash his face and go to buy sausages and pick up a letter from Magdalene Plum. It would say, in her prim hand, three scratches and a dot. It would say: we are not brittle. It would say the thing he needed and the thing he already knew, which was that a line can be drawn under anything, and under that line might be written a better thought. He would take up his broom and his penknife and his cat. He would go on. The hero of Andover does not glow. He stands. He goes back for the small, fallen, required. He knows\u2014which is a kind of magic, too\u2014that you cannot win a town with ink. You win it by living in it long enough to know where the tea is kept. He meant to live long enough. And longer, if he could be rude about it.The next morning began with flour on the air. Saturday had arrived with its hands full. Bread rose in ovens and people in beds and a pale sun put its shoulder to the roofs and shoved. Elias had the habit of taking Saturday by the polite scruff and showing it where to stand. He swept his step, because it was neighborly, and returned Mrs. Troon\u2019s handkerchief washed and pressed, because she would see the pressing and believe in the washing. He found three pebbles in his pocket that he did not remember collecting and set them on the sill to see if they had any intention in them. One did; it wanted to be part of a ring. He left it to think the rest through.\n\nQuill, who had no patience with pebbles, was stalking the mild, important fly that lived in the kitchen and had learned the shape of a cat\u2019s paw and the sound of a shout. \u201cIt will die in a week,\u201d Quill said, sitting down suddenly as if overcome by mercy. \u201cOr of boredom. It visits only three corners. It is a fly with a limited imagination.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is a fly who knows what it is about,\u201d Elias said. He tied his scarf without looking and it came out even. Evenness on a Saturday was a spell all its own. \u201cWe\u2019re going to Magdalene\u2019s,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd then to the green.\u201d\n\nQuill\u2019s ears twitched. \u201cWe are taking books to the grass? They don\u2019t like it. Grass goes between the pages and then you hear whispering when you open to find a recipe.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot books,\u201d Elias said. \u201cBoards.\u201d\n\nMagdalene Plum had said no three times before she said yes, and she had done it with her eyebrows and an intake of breath and a lean away and finally with her mouth. \u201cYou will not print an argument,\u201d she said as if it were a swear. \u201cYou will not print a defense. You will not print the words not and true on the same line.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Elias said. \u201cShopping lists.\u201d\n\nShe stared at him. \u201cYou are a tiresome man.\u201d\n\n\u201cNevertheless,\u201d Elias said, and his smile did not work on Magdalene because she had known him since he was a boy and had watched him call a lost kitten out of a coal scuttle and then ask it to return the coal. \u201cBlank shopping lists,\u201d he clarified. \u201cName at the top. Little lines below, with nothing on them. And a place at the bottom for a note to oneself.\u201d\n\nMagdalene made the sound of a woman considering both treason and tea. \u201cIt will look like charity,\u201d she said after a moment. \u201cThe sort women took and then hid when husbands came in.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt will be charity,\u201d Elias said. \u201cIt will be the sort of charity you cannot be ashamed of because you can cover a jar with it.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd in the fibers you will,\u201d she said, and it wasn\u2019t a question.\n\n\u201cI will put nothing that will sting,\u201d Elias said. He softened his voice as he would for a nervous dog. \u201cOnly the word that sends people back to their coats to fetch their gloves. Only the word that makes them put the kettle on before tears. Only the sound a brush makes when it finds the corner you always forget.\u201d\n\nMagdalene sighed. \u201cBring me the period,\u201d she said. \u201cThe little dot you took as if you were stealing an egg.\u201d\n\nElias did not ask her how she knew. He reached into his pocket and drew the small black speck onto his palm. It looked like nothing. It was nothing until you needed it. Magdalene did not touch it. She bent over it as if listening and the dot listened back. She nodded. \u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cHe will hate this.\u201d She laid a slip of transparent paper over Elias\u2019s hand and lifted the dot\u2019s shadow and slid that into a forme with a care like baptism. \u201cDo not make me do this again,\u201d she muttered, and then, because her heart had never once in its life agreed to be hardened and stay, she added, \u201cBut if you must, warn me. I will not be taken by surprise by goodness.\u201d\n\nThey printed fifty. The paper was not fine. It was that useful brown that seems to have been born wrapped round apples. The lists came off the press with a smell like rain on a pantry. Magdalene eyed the stack as if it might run. \u201cYou will need strings,\u201d she said. \u201cFor hanging. The backs of doors. Pegs will sulk if you leave them out.\u201d She took a skein from a drawer and cut lengths with a knife that had been her father\u2019s and his mother\u2019s and\u2014if Andover kept itself from burning down or eating its own children\u2014would belong to a niece yet to be born. She licked her forefinger and smoothed the ends. A small gesture, a small spell. Elias loved the woman for it. He thought he had loved her already for refusing him three times and he had, but this\u2014licked forefinger, neat ends\u2014added itself to the tally.\n\nOn the green, where men were setting up their stalls and children were arranging coins into shapes that looked like bigger coins, Elias borrowed the town\u2019s attention the way a bell borrows air. He stood on the flat top of the old mile stone, which had lost the number for the next place and kept the number for the one behind as if it could only bear to remember home. He did not clear his throat. He did not raise his arms. He let the sun find the list in his hand and make it glow.\n\n\u201cYou will have pamphlets,\u201d he said when the crowd had gathered in the way a crowd always does on a green when someone stands a little higher than the rest. \u201cAgain. Today, probably. Tomorrow certainly. He will put numbers on you. He will tell you what you are worth. He will put measurements on your children like coats. He will tell you the names of the parts of your soul and then give you the wrong definitions. He is very good at adding. He has forgotten how to count to one.\u201d\n\nA laugh moved through the crowd like someone trying not to cough and failing. Hester Stowe stood with both hands in her pockets and showed her teeth at the idea of anyone numbering her.\n\n\u201cThis,\u201d Elias said, holding up the list, \u201cis for adding back. It is for writing what you need and what you want and what you will forgive yourself for not having when the week is out. It is for putting your name at the top of your own life. You will hang it behind the door where you keep the broom. When you think something ugly, you will write butter. When you think something mean, you will write soap. When you cannot think at all, you will draw a square where the sugar lives. If you have a neighbor who cannot read, you will go and put a square in their square. If you can read and you read the sort of word that sticks in your skin, you will come to me and I will make tea. If you have better tea than mine, I will come to you.\u201d\n\nSomeone, and it might have been Mr. Crisp\u2019s daughter because she had never before spent a word where a look would do and had lately begun to spend, said, low and clear, \u201cYes.\u201d\n\nElias did not say it was magic. He did not say it was defense. He said, \u201cMagdalene Plum has made these. You may pay her in pennies or jam. If you have neither, you may pay her in kindness and she will remember you to your credit the next time you buy thread.\u201d Magdalene, who would not for the world be seen accepting jam as payment for paper, lifted her chin and took the first coins with a sniff that made paying in kindness feel extravagant.\n\nQuill, bored with speeches and delighted by distribution, leaped from shoulder to shoulder with lengths of string in his mouth as if he were ribboning a maypole. He allowed three children to pet him and bit none of them. \u201cOne each,\u201d he said sternly when Hester tried to take two. \u201cThey multiply in houses. They do not multiply in pockets.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey do if you tear them in half,\u201d Hester retorted. \u201cTwo smaller lists.\u201d\n\n\u201cMathematical fraud,\u201d Quill said. \u201cGo stand on your brother\u2019s foot.\u201d She went.\n\nThe noon bells, when they came, were late. They came in a disorder like a man coming down stairs carrying too many books. Heads turned toward the tower. People whose lives ran on those twelve notes frowned. The bell rope down the church\u2019s back corridor had a particular feel on a Saturday, rough from the week, oiled with the touch of a hundred palms. Elijah Grieves, who rang them, was a man who rarely looked up; the bell had taken its shape in him, a roundness where others were square. He came out of the side door shaking his hands as if he had dipped them in nettles.\n\n\u201cThey were numbered,\u201d he said, when Elias reached him on the path. \u201cHe put numbers on them. It didn\u2019t change the sound. It did change it. I cannot say. I heard a one where there is none.\u201d He lifted his palms. Across the pads of his fingers a row of faint gray marks had been laid like rules on paper. One, two, three, four, five. He had stopped before six.\n\nElias felt in his mouth the small brave word his town had been learning to say. He did not say it aloud yet. He turned Elijah\u2019s hands and breath caught in his chest as if he had picked up something heavy wrong. The marks were not ink. They were ash. The ash had been pressed in by something that meant to teach.\n\n\u201cI will see the ropes,\u201d he said. \u201cWould you stand in the sun and forget what numbers are for a minute.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do it often,\u201d Elijah said with humility. He went to stand by the chest tomb he was not related to, and he put his face up like a man warming his bones. Elias and Quill went inside the cool blue of the church.\n\nThe great loops of rope hung like enormous, sleeping snakes. At the base of each, knots had been tied where no knots belonged: neat, tight, too small for the size of rope. Around each knot a number had been chalked on with something not chalk, something that hated skin. One. Two. Three. Elias put his palm to One. The rope resisted him. It had been taught to obey a counting that was not the bell\u2019s own.\n\n\u201cYou are very tidy,\u201d he said to the nave. Dust shivered. \u201cYou are very ordered. You have the sort of order that makes girls stand up straight against walls. It is not the only sort.\u201d\n\nHe took out one of the strings Magdalene had cut and tied it very loosely around the middle of the rope. Then he tied a second string below and a third above. He breathed out and spoke the word of setting things to rights the way a mother\u2019s friend speaks it while she picks up the skirts of her dress and wades into the playroom. The rope shifted, thinking. The knot thought of being undone and did not yet undo. Truth did not argue. It poured tea and went on pouring when the guest sulked. Elias touched the chalk numbers with his knuckle and closed his eyes and saw the chalk before it had been chalk and the hand before it had held chalk and the boy before the hand grew big. He pressed his thumb against One and said, weary and gentle, \u201cEnough.\u201d\n\nThe number went out like a candle you blow and pretend someone else did. The knot unlearned itself. Two took longer. Three spat. Four came away with satisfaction; it had known it was ridiculous, stuck where it was. Five was a little blood. He wiped it on his trousers and told no one.\n\nOutside, Elijah rolled his shoulders as if the bell had started to remember the curve of them. \u201cBetter,\u201d he said. \u201cHe will not like that.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe will be late to his dinner,\u201d Elias said. \u201cNo one likes that.\u201d He stood on the step and looked over Andover and the way the roofs made a quilt to keep something warm underneath. He could feel another place tugging at him like a loose thread caught on a nail. North one day ago. Not north today. East. The ache had moved to under his right shoulder. \u201cHe is making lists,\u201d he said absently. \u201cDo not listen to them unless they say bread, salt, pickles.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe will put numbers on doors,\u201d Elijah said.\n\n\u201cHe will,\u201d Elias agreed. \u201cWe will put flowers over them. He will say we\u2019re foolish. We will be foolish. And we will eat.\u201d\n\nThey were halfway down the path to the green when the first door was chalked. The child who did it was not a child; he was a man named Short John because he was long, and he held a square of gray pressed stuff and ran it across the blue of Mrs. Coppin\u2019s door with a hunger that did not belong to his stomach. A four appeared, then a decimal, then a six. He looked at his work the way an apprentice looks at a chair he has planed smooth, and smile-pride broke over his face and then was gone as if water had thrown it out.\n\n\u201cJohn,\u201d Elias said mildly, \u201cyou have something on your hand.\u201d\n\nJohn stared at his palm as if he had been awakened. There was no chalk there, only that not-chalk ash, settled in the whorls. He looked at the door. He looked at Elias. \u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d he said, but quiet, as if the say was a question.\n\n\u201cYou do,\u201d Elias said. \u201cGive it here.\u201d He reached for John\u2019s hand and took it as he would a rope with a house tied to the other end. \u201cPut your other hand on your own chest,\u201d he added, and John obeyed because people like him, who had been told to put their hands on benches and tables and planks and put them sensibly, sometimes needed directions when it came to themselves. Elias leaned forward and blew, once, on the palm. The ash scattered as if surprised to discover it had no roots. \u201cThere,\u201d Elias said. He stepped past John and wrote over the number with the heel of his own hand, not words. He rubbed until the blue came back. He patted the wood because the wood had felt it. \u201cHester,\u201d he called, without looking, \u201cbring me a flower with a head not bigger than your nose.\u201d\n\nHester came at once, as if she had been waiting behind him all his life. She had a nasturtium, violent and impossible. Elias took it and tucked it into the splinter beside the latch. \u201cNow,\u201d he said to the door, to Mrs. Coppin\u2019s kitchen, to the corner where she kept the sugar, \u201cyou may look silly all afternoon. It will help.\u201d\n\nMrs. Coppin, who had never been silly in any public way, laughed from inside, unoffended, and the small devil in the chalk lifted its head and lost interest. John wiped his palm on his waistcoat as if that would undo something else. \u201cI thought I was helping,\u201d he said, bewildered.\n\n\u201cYou were,\u201d Elias said. He meant it. \u201cYou were helping prove that chalk does not say God.\u201d He felt the ache under his shoulder move and he put two fingers there and pressed. \u201cIf you feel like writing numbers,\u201d he added to John, \u201cwrite the number of your own door. It will bring you home.\u201d\n\nBy afternoon, Andover wore flowers like a girl who had run out of ears to stick them behind. Numbers appeared and were rubbed away and were covered with leaves of ivy and the paper labels of tins of syrup. Magdalene\u2019s lists had been hung beside brooms; the lines began to fill with butter and soap and thread and patience and more patience and forgive myself for thinking the wrong thought and a drawing of a cat with a hat on that could only have been Hester\u2019s. Quill napped with his head inside a bowl because that way no one would put words in it. Three times the black birds that were not birds tried to batter themselves to bits on the panes of the post office. Three times Mr. Bobbin, who had once played the fiddle badly in a pub and wished sometimes he still did, waltzed them away with a fly whisk and the obstinate grace of a man in his shirtsleeves dancing alone.\n\nIn the midst of this, when the day might have been called a success by someone who counted wins by notches cut in door frames, Vellum Crowe sent a thing so quiet that if Hester had not been looking at Elias since morning as if she could protect him with a stare, no one would have noticed it.\n\nIt came as a boy with a tray of buttons.\n\nHe had been a boy for years and would be one for some years yet; he had the knees and the scuffed shoes and the opinion of bread that boys have. He had a tray hung from his neck with a strap and on the tray were buttons, bone and wooden and glass, buttons that had belonged to miens of coats and dresses that had been out of fashion when the King was a different man. The buttons were threaded through card and each card had two words inked at the top. Brave Girl. Honest Wife. Good Man. Faithful Son. The boy\u2019s face was blank and not unhappy, the way faces are in the moment after someone says the first sentence in a story you have heard before. He went person to person and lifted the tray as if he were in church and the tray held wine and you had already drunk and must not take more. People took, because buttons are useful and names are a hunger.\n\nHester reached him before Elias did. She stood with her fists on her hips and tilted her chin until her hair touched her spine and refused Good Girl and said, \u201cDo you have Stupid Brother.\u201d\n\nThe boy raised his eyes and had to be a boy for three heartbeats longer than was polite. \u201cNo,\u201d he said, through the voice of someone who wished he could peach and could not. \u201cOnly these.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat if I am not good and not a girl,\u201d Hester said, tempted by fairies and devils both, \u201cbut something else.\u201d\n\nThe boy hesitated. He looked down at his tray and reached for a card and stopped and reached for another. His fingers hovered above Truth Teller. He lifted it as if it were heftless and heavy, which it was, and he would have pinned it on her chest if Elias had not touched his wrist. The boy startled and came back into himself like a man into a cold room. His eyes filled with tears because his eyes had been about to be taken from him. He put the card back. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said, to Hester, to Elias, to the buttons.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not you,\u201d Elias said, to the boy and to the town and to himself. \u201cGo home. Give those to Magdalene. She will string them on the right names.\u201d He lifted the tray off the boy\u2019s neck and the boy sagged with relief and ran. The buttons made a small rain on the green when the tray tilted. Elias crouched and picked up Truth Teller. The card tried to stick to his finger and he gave it one firm look and it changed its mind. He slid the card into his pocket behind the dot and felt the two sit there together like knowledge and action.\n\n\u201cWill you give it to me,\u201d Hester demanded, because she had heard the words and claimed them with the instantaneous greed of a thief with a code. \u201cWill you pin it on. If you do, it will stick.\u201d She sounded as if she wanted a brand. Quill made a sound not unlike the light failing in a lamp. He came and stood between Hester and the card with such careful rudeness that Hester had to look him in the face. He had cat angles. He had cat eyes. They were currently two very small moons.\n\n\u201cYou will not wear any word today,\u201d Quill said. He did not hiss. He did not purr. He pronounced. \u201cYou will eat. You will run. You will say three times my name is Hester Stowe and the only thing true in that sentence is that I am not a stove. You will laugh at yourself because you are very funny. You will not hold out your chest for anyone\u2019s pin.\u201d He flicked her jumper with a paw, less than the tap you might give a child\u2019s shoulder with your knuckle when she is dreaming. Hester\u2019s chin came down. She did as she was told. She looked smaller. She went away to be large somewhere else.\n\n\u201cButtons,\u201d Elias muttered, when she had gone. \u201cHe will send mirrors next. He will call himself a philanthropist.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe will send knives measured in kindnesses,\u201d Quill said, disgusted. \u201cAll dull. All sharp.\u201d\n\nThey walked the green until shadows began to think seriously about work. They rubbed away numbers. They hung lists. They put flowers in places that were very stern about flowers. Elias took three complaints and swallowed them without chewing because he did not have time to argue with Mrs. Hardesty about whether her sausages had suffered; they had not. He drank tea offered and tea taken and a tea that was not tea at all but barley boiled with a bay leaf because someone\u2019s grandmother had done it that way and no one had stopped her. He made a small boy swallow a lie he had just heard and then take a sip of water because swallowing things dry is foolish. He stood under a tree and looked north and east and west in turn and felt each direction press against him like a dog leaning its weight. He had said he would go where Vellum wanted him not to go and Vellum wanted him not to stay. So he stayed. No heroism. Only a man in a town where he lived.\n\nNight now had a shadow on it that it had not had before. People went home not briskly, not slow. They went home as if something were following and something else were leading and they were trying to arrange themselves between. Elias went indoors and lit his small lamp because he preferred oil to gas when he was going to do something that ought to have the right sort of flame. He set the biscuit tin on the table and took the pamphlets out and considered them the way a farmer might consider a dead fox: not with sentiment, not without a spasm of something like anger. He lifted the lid of the bottom of his teapot and took out what he had hidden there a year ago because he did not know why he had hidden it and it felt important. A thin strip of ribbon. It was the ribbon his mother had tied round her hair when she wanted it out of her eyes to scrub. It had a song in it. It had water. It had the smell of soap made from fat that had been saved and saved and finally used. He laid the ribbon across the pamphlets and said the name he never said, the one under his own. \u201cAll right,\u201d he said, to the paper, to the ribbon, to the piece of his life that had found him at his table. \u201cWe will be with each other now.\u201d\n\nQuill came very slowly and put his paw on Elias\u2019s wrist with the delicacy of a prince who knows the weight of a crown and refuses it. Elias did not begin to cry and he did not begin to look heroic. He breathed. The ribbon lay and lay and did what ribbons do when they have been taught all their lives to hold. The papers seemed to find themselves less interesting and more tiresome. The nasty burr in the second one shifted as if it had been dislodged by a careless elbow and fell apart. The first one thought of its title and then of its margin and then of the weed in the margin and then of the root of the weed and went home. Elias took them up and put them back in the tin and set the book and the stone and his hand on top in turn and did not worry if there was a formula in the order. There was and there wasn\u2019t; that was life.\n\n\u201cYou will go tomorrow,\u201d Quill said eventually into the quiet that had deepened like the color of water at dusk.\n\n\u201cI will go in the morning,\u201d Elias said. \u201cBefore the day puts its boots on. He took his dinner late; he will sleep late. He will think I have forgotten where the door to the lower rooms is. He will think I have decided to be a broom forever and never a brush.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are not a brush,\u201d Quill said. \u201cA brush is for paint. You are for corners.\u201d\n\n\u201cDifferent sorts,\u201d Elias said. He stretched his fingers and looked at their tips as if there might be a reckoning under the nails. Five little numbers there. No ash. \u201cHe will ask me to be numbered,\u201d he added. \u201cHe will ask me to tell him what I am in his words. He will say I am a sad son and I will flinch because it is true and not his. He will say I am a man who tidies in order not to grieve. I will say that grief leaves crumbs and someone must sweep.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will say it,\u201d Quill said, satisfied. \u201cSay the thing he cannot say without eating a part of himself that he wants to keep.\u201d\n\nThe dawn came with a taste of tin. The sky had beaten itself flat to lay better over Andover; something to do with pressure and weather and the way fields lie in late autumn. Elias put his hands on the table palms down and pressed, as if he could fasten himself to the world so that if a wind came and played tricks he would not be the leaf in it. He put the dot in his pocket and the Truth Teller card next to it and the ribbon round the pamphlets and the soldier in his breast, foolishly, because he had liked its weight on the press and thought the press might have liked its weight back. He did not tell Quill to stay. Quill did not ask to go. They went.\n\nThe school was less sentient in the morning. It had not yet remembered its damp. The steps were slick but not malicious. Elias left his hand on the wall as he went down and told it an unimportant thing as if to keep it in conversation: the way Mrs. Coppin put her spoon on a plate and not on the stove back and how he had learned to do the same. The wall did not reply. It listened. Sometimes that was enough.\n\nAt the door to the lower room, where ink had slept, a new sign had been hung. It had been thumbtacked\u2014no spell\u2014just hit and held. It said, in precise hand-done capitals, PRIVATE INSTRUCTION. There was a line drawn under it so straight that it had to be wrong. Elias wanted to pull the sign down and write underneath it, NO CHILDREN, but he did not. He opened the door.\n\nVellum Crowe was awake. He had not slept. He had been awake, learning. He had a cup on the table and something that might have been soup in it and he had not eaten. He had his sleeves rolled up and his thin forearms were scribbled with ink formulas because he was the sort of man who remembers better when his own skin agrees to be paper. He looked at Elias and in the single breath they took together, something like relief crossed his face. It was a man\u2019s relief when he hears the footstep coming that will not be turned away.\n\n\u201cYou stayed,\u201d Vellum said. \u201cYou did not come when I told you to. You made errands. And lists. You are trite.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am durable,\u201d Elias said. \u201cYou can write me as clever or not clever as you like. I will still be here when your pen runs out.\u201d\n\nVellum\u2019s mouth did an unwise thing then; it softened. He caught it and straightened it with a touch that would have been tender if it had been on anyone\u2019s flesh but his own. \u201cSay what you came to say,\u201d he commanded, and each word struck the air and pressed wrinkles into it that would not smooth easily. \u201cSay it. We will name. We will put the correct nouns with the correct verbs. You are a broom.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am a man,\u201d Elias said. He took the dot from his pocket and did not show it. He put his hand, that hand that had been taught by a woman who sang, on the end of the press as if to introduce two old creatures. \u201cYou are a boy who forgot what his mother called him,\u201d he added, not cruel, not kind. He added, after a small time in which Vellum remembered to blink, \u201cI brought you a soldier.\u201d\n\nThe look Vellum gave the painted thing on the table was so quick you might have missed it if you were the sort to miss things on purpose. Elias was not. Vellum\u2019s throat worked. \u201cI do not play,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou do not stop,\u201d Elias said. \u201cWhich is not the same.\u201d He took the truth card from his pocket and the dot with it and set them together on the press. \u201cYou sent buttons. You sent words to wear. You sent numbers. You sent whispers that teach women to lay children down and call it safety. You know how to thread malice. I know how to unthread it. If I die of it one day, at least the last thing I will have eaten will not be a lie.\u201d\n\nVellum\u2019s eyes flicked to the door and back. He was checking the room to be certain it stayed his. \u201cYou would die as easily as a word,\u201d he said. It was intended to be threat. It sounded like the thing men say when they love a sentence on a page and cannot get it out in any human way.\n\n\u201cThen put me down with the good ones,\u201d Elias said. He looked Vellum in the eyes because men had already been told not to and because Hester had done it for him when she laughed and said she was not a stove. \u201cYou will put my mother in your next pamphlet. You have already written a paragraph about her in your head. You have written a sentence in which she did not come home for two days and a second in which she did and a third in which there was someone with her and a fourth in which there was no one and the fourth is the worst of them because it has nothing pointed to it except absence and you will let people fill it with whatever dirt they have near to hand. If you write it, I will find you and I will take your name and sew it into my pocket and you will have to come to me to ask for it back.\u201d\n\nVellum\u2019s hands, which had been practicing composure for fifty mornings, curled in on themselves as if they might learn to be fists. \u201cYou think you are a hero,\u201d he said. Not a sneer. A boy trying on a tone and finding it too big.\n\n\u201cI think I am necessary,\u201d Elias said. \u201cI am not alone. My town knows where its tea is. The truth does not have to be shouted down the street. It will be put on the back of a door and looked at before someone leaves for the market.\u201d He laid the truth card with its neat little letters face down. He held the dot on the center of it with his thumb. \u201cWe are going to set something down,\u201d he said, and the press creaked as if clearing its own throat. \u201cAnd we are going to leave it there.\u201d\n\nVellum moved faster than Quill liked. He picked up a handful of letters and he threw them, and each was meant to be a nail. Quill did a thing he despised, which was to look like a fool for usefulness\u2019s sake: he thrust himself between the letters and Elias and let them tangle in his fur because his fur was the sort of thing malicious words slide off when they have not planned for whiskers. He spat, ugly. He sank his teeth in liar and it tasted of bitter almonds and the moment when a sweet goes bad on your tongue. He swallowed anyway. He felt it crawl and then he was Quill hard, that line of cat that goes from nose to tail like a string plucked. He hissed and disliked himself for hissing and did it again.\n\n\u201cI know your name,\u201d Elias said, to Vellum, with the dot under his thumb and the card under the dot and the ribbon in his pocket and the soldier waiting with his badly painted nose. \u201cNot the one you chose. The one someone else said to you without clothes on it. I do not need to say it. It is a small name. It is the name of a boy in a room being told not to point. You will not like me for this. You will not be able to make a pamphlet that does not smell of mildew if you write me into it.\u201d He lifted his thumb. He did not speak a spell. He said the word that lives in every house and men forget where it lives because they walk past it to get to the door. \u201cFull stop,\u201d he said. \u201cThere.\u201d\n\nIt was not light. It was not noise. It was the end of a sentence that had been running through the town for two days. It found the place in Mrs. Hardesty\u2019s kitchen where she kept the jar for flour and it sat in the bottom of it and waited to be scooped. It found the bell the boys rang with their fists when Elijah was not looking and it put a little period on the sound so that it could not run on into Ugly Theories About The Vicar\u2019s Sister. It found the place on Hester\u2019s mouth where a laugh had worn the skin thin and it settled there and made a small punctuation that felt like a healed scab. It found the pamphlets in the tin on Elias\u2019s table and laid a dot on the dot and said, without voice or bravado, enough.\n\nVellum Crowe swayed. He had been standing on the run-on. He had been breathing the breath people breathe when they are waiting for the next clause to give them their excuse. He put his hand out as if there were a chair and there was none\u2014he had turned them into splinters because he was a fool\u2014and he did not fall because falling would have been a drama and he was not written for drama, only for the nibbling bitterness of men in rooms. He said, very quietly, \u201cYou cannot print this.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Elias agreed. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t read. It sits.\u201d He touched the press, which had begun to look thoughtful, as presses do when you tell them you will not be using them for their ordinary wickedness and they are not sure they like virtue. \u201cYou could set it,\u201d he said to the iron. \u201cYou could do it by hand in churches and rooms where fights start and walk away once it takes.\u201d He lifted his hand and looked at Vellum and saw suddenly how thin the man had been made by his own wanting. The pity that came into him then had four legs and a tail. It was a cat. He did not show it. He said instead, \u201cWould you like soup.\u201d\n\nVellum looked at him as if he had said Would you like death. He made a face that was supposed to be disdain and could not be because he had turned his disdain into a pet and it had run away. \u201cYou will not make me into a story where we sit and share food and I learn to call you by your Christian name,\u201d he said. \u201cYou will not feed me.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are already in my story,\u201d Elias said. \u201cAnd you are very hungry.\u201d He took a step back, because pity was dangerous in the presence of a man who sharpened it for sport. \u201cI am going home,\u201d he said, because truth sometimes has doors in it and you must go through. \u201cIf you come up into the air I will speak to you. If you send paper to children I will stand in your doorway every morning until you stop and my town will bring me bread on days I am tired.\u201d\n\nVellum did not answer. His mouth had forgotten the trick. He looked at the soldier and turned away as if embarrassed by his own embarrassment. He lifted the cup that might have had soup in it and drank and choked because you cannot drink numbers and be satisfied.\n\nOn the steps, Elias let himself sit down for a long breath and then another. Quill arranged his whiskers with the lethal delicacy of a swordsman cleaning his blade. \u201cIf you ever,\u201d he said to Elias without heat, \u201cask me to swallow liar again, I will sleep in the drawer with the spoons and I will let them all have my fur forever.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d be handsome in spoons,\u201d Elias said. \u201cThink of the reflection.\u201d He leaned the back of his head against the stone and watched a spider do mathematics without numbers in the corner, putting leg to leg to silk to wall with neither chalk nor ash nor any man\u2019s pin. He looked at the morning, which was not much older than it had been when he\u2019d left the house, and thought how lengthened it felt already, like a day at the sea. \u201cWe are not done,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Quill said. \u201cBut you put a dot in the right place.\u201d He looked at Elias, and there was a thought in his yellow eyes that was not cat and not human and not town either. \u201cHe is one of those who has forgotten to want anything that doesn\u2019t have a label.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe wanted that soldier,\u201d Elias said. \u201cHe was six for a moment. People will tell you six is harmless. It is not. Six is violent. Six will learn a word and say it until it cuts and then cry because it cut and say it again for the shape of it. I will remember he wanted a toy. It will matter.\u201d\n\nThey walked home through a town that was discovering in a small way what it was to end a sentence. People spoke to each other and then stopped and smiled and did not say the extra nasty thought that had been waiting to come out like a rash. Mrs. Hardesty hung a list and put on it apples, lard, don\u2019t listen, more apples. Mr. Bobbin tuned his fiddle and decided not to play. Elijah Grieves rang the bells at the right hour and mistook a tone for another and did not mind, which was a revolution in a church taller than its own thought.\n\nOn Elias\u2019s table, under the stone and the book and his hand, two pieces of wicked paper behaved themselves with a sulk that would not last. He removed his hand. The book could sit alone. He thought of writing a notice and pinning it to his own door with a thumbtack that smelled of tin. PRIVATE INSTRUCTION, it would say, and underneath, in smaller letters, TEA.\n\nHe did not do it. He put the kettle on. He sat on his step. He looked at the street. Hester came and sat beside him without asking because only a very few people in a man\u2019s life get to do that, and she had given him a frog and two coins and nearly her trust and then her laugh, so she was in. They looked at the town together, and then at nothing, and that was fine.\n\n\u201cI stole something from the buttons,\u201d Hester said eventually, as if confessing and bragging were the same thing. \u201cThe one that said honest wife. I gave it to Mrs. Troon. She laughed and put it in her pocket.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d Elias said. \u201cPut things in your pockets. Then when a wind comes there will be weight there and you will not be turned inside out.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy brother said you only win because you talk like stories do and talking isn\u2019t anything,\u201d Hester said. \u201cI said he only loses because he listens like a donkey.\u201d She leaned against him, not much, a little weight. \u201cIs it winning,\u201d she asked, because there was nothing child in the question and everything child in the asking.\n\n\u201cIt is ending a sentence,\u201d Elias said. \u201cIt is putting a pot on the table and saying This is your spoon, this is mine. It is making lists and rubbing chalk. It isn\u2019t much. It is more than nothing.\u201d He thought of Vellum in his room smelling of ash and difficult childhood and soup he wouldn\u2019t eat. \u201cIt is not winning,\u201d he said, and Hester heard the word not because she wore a Truth invisible and that made words closer to her skin. \u201cIt is refusing to lose in the way that would please him.\u201d\n\nQuill made a sound like bridal lace. He had caught the fly with the inadequate imagination somewhere between Magdalene\u2019s and the green and was groomingly satisfied with himself. \u201cHe will send something clever,\u201d he said, licking a paw and dragging it over an ear as if the job were finishing touches. \u201cHe is clever. It\u2019s the thing he knows about himself.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d Elias said. He looked at the afternoon. It did not look back in any meaningful way. He thought of the dot, of the card, of the ribbon. He thought of his mother\u2019s song. He put his hands on his knees and was not idle. He was waiting the way bakers wait: by doing something with flour.\n\nVellum, in the room below the school where the maps had learned to be not countries, took up a fresh sheet and made it into a shape like a boat because he had forgotten to do that for thirty years and sometimes forgetting and remembering are different sorts of spells. He pushed the paper boat across the surface of his soup and thought of a river that would have been a friend if he had not told it he was smarter than it. He pushed the boat under. He watched it sink. He smiled a very small smile that had no malice in it and so died as it left his mouth.\n\nAndover breathed in and out and gathered its own smell round itself like a shawl. Someone somewhere called a cat in and the cat came and then went back out because that is what cats do when called. The water meadows were a breath away from letting mist stand up and show its bones. The green went dull and then lit again with a boy\u2019s torch that should not have been out and was. Elias took up his broom because some spells you have to make again and again or the world forgets and then where are you. He swept his step because it was his step. He did not put numbers on the broom. He did not let anyone else. He thought, without argument, that there would be a morning when he would, for a little, not be able to end any sentence, but he was not going to give that morning this day\u2019s light. He went inside when the dark said so in a voice that was not a pamphlet. He shut the door because he had a door. He put the kettle on again because kettles are how you mark distance between the worst of a man\u2019s words and the best of what you can do about them. He sat. He stood. He kept both hands. He did not glow. He prepared.Saturday\u2019s second breath brought things in their Sunday clothes, which was to say they concealed themselves as virtue. The first boy came up the lane with his cap at an angle that made old women say things about the cut of his mother\u2019s tongue, and he had a sheaf of small papers tied neat with twine. There was nothing written on them. They carried a smell like boiled milk left to catch a skin. He put them into people\u2019s hands with his head respectfully bent as if he were doffing it without the bother, and each paper had a pin like a thorn stuck through one corner so that you could put it on a sleeve. The title, if you held it to the light and let your eyes go strange, was Apology. Under it, there were no words at all.\n\nThey worked like sacks. Mrs. Hardesty took one and a small hollowness came loose in her mouth so that when the girl who swept her step every Thursday came late and knocked a tray of feet-first rabbits with her elbow and made a mess of sawdust and ears, Mrs. Hardesty went to say the word she had always used as a hinge\u2014sorry\u2014and found that the hinge had been prised up and hidden under the floorboard. She stood with her hands on her hips and said, hearing herself as if someone else had set her to it, I suppose. She disliked the sound so much she nearly paid the girl double to wash it out. The girl, who had her own blank pinned to her jumper, stared at Mrs. Hardesty as if a sovereign had rolled under the counter and no one had it in them to kneel.\n\nMagdalene Plum took one from the boy because she never refused to take what arrived in her hand; she liked to look at wickedness where it could see her looking. She pricked her finger on the pin and refused to be taught by that either. She turned the paper. She held it to the window. She laid it on her press as a dare and the press\u2014in whose metal had been hammered a dozen sermons by men whose daughters had grown up and grown old within the smell of it\u2014refused to act as midwife. \u201cHmph,\u201d Magdalene said. She wrapped the blank like bread in an old page of the Hampshire Chronicle that had reported nothing bloodier than a harvest and sent it with a boy to Elias.\n\nHe was on his knees under Mrs. Troon\u2019s table at the time, extracting a splinter that had been working up through the wood toward the soft underside of the baby. He extricated things with his voice when he could, but splinters liked a knife if you respected the fiber and the grain. He came out dusty and pleased with the chair leg, and took the package without ceremony, and the blank slid out and made the smallest noise like a little breath of contentment, as if at last it had found someone who would be a good host.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t pin it,\u201d Quill said immediately, all hackles in his voice if not his fur. \u201cDon\u2019t put it anywhere it can learn the shape of your arm.\u201d\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d Elias murmured. He touched the corner of the page with one knuckle. The nothing in it tried to come up his hand and grease his palm and he said, very quietly, as you would to an overeager dog: \u201cNo.\u201d He smelled the trick of it: the way it would sit on a sleeve all morning and then, when a man dropped an egg in the yard and a neighbor said, ah, and not unkindly, it would suck the apology out of his mouth and replace it with a bit of furniture dressed as a sentence. An apology was a use. This was an ornament, the sort a rich woman wears to church and takes off before the potatoes are peeled. \u201cClever,\u201d he said, because it was; Vellum had found the place where the town gave itself back to itself most easily and set a hand on it.\n\nBy midmorning there were two more contrivances. A man with a face like a knitting mistake brought round little mirrors with rough tin edging and a slip of paper in each that read with printed courtesy For Your Self-Reflection from A Friend. If you held a mirror up you could not see your nose straight for the words they had pressed behind the silver, and if you looked long enough the edge of your mouth took on the shape of the word that lay closest, which made men look cruel when they were tired and women look tired when they were trying to be cruel. Children took them by the dozen because children take shining things; Hester took one and put it in her pocket and later hung it facing the wall with a sock over it and told it, \u201cNot until you behave.\u201d\n\nAnd a woman I will not name because she had once refused a half-penny from a boy who had tried to pay for his mother\u2019s button with it came up the High Street ringing a small clean handbell and selling cards with lines on them and one word in tidy copperplate at the top: Regret. \u201cYou fill in your own,\u201d she told Magdalene, who frowned as if the word regret should not have let itself be put on a string and dragged about. \u201cThen it\u2019s real. Then everyone sees and knows you have been honest enough to be wrong.\u201d Nothing in her voice suggested she had thought any of this by herself. She had a look to her as though Vellum had pressed her flat and written on her and when he lifted his hand she had sprung back up with his letters ghosting under her skin.\n\nElias took the mirror, and the blank, and the regret, and laid them in a row on his table with the ribbon beyond them like a line he did not mean them to cross. He said nothing to them because there is a kind of rudeness that encourages the worst sort of houseguest and he had had lodgers enough in his time. He went and knocked on Magdalene\u2019s lintel so that she would have the pleasure of frowning at him in the doorway and then telling him he knew better. \u201cHe is trying to replace breath with paper,\u201d he told her when she had finished. \u201cHe has understood we have a word for We are sorry and we give it away to one another and it comes back and it is not the poorer for it. He has made it a thing you wear when you remember.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen take their pins,\u201d Magdalene said, savage. She cut a piece of brown wrap from the roll with a movement like a woman slicing a loaf, and printed with small brutality down the middle of it: lend, mend, carry, walk, brew, wash, spare. \u201cYou have taught them to write butter and soap. Teach them to write the doing words. Put these in their kitchens. Hang them on the line and let the verbs learn the shape of wind.\u201d She looked at him without love and with all the respect she had. \u201cDo not make me say please,\u201d she added. \u201cIf this is to be the language of the day, I will not be poor in it.\u201d\n\nHe left Magdalene\u2019s with a stack under his arm and the press\u2019s heat still under his palms. On the green, he gave the verbs away as if he were tossing seed into a fallow field and seeing already the rough hair of shoots coming up. Women took them and smiled with their mouths, which said everything about what men had been doing to their mouths all morning. Men took them and tucked them into hats because hats remember things that heads forget. Children ran with them held high and the words flapped and learned to fly and were not upset when they fell; verbs are not like that.\n\nQuill carried string again in his teeth and looked as if the task were beneath him and entirely pleasing at once. \u201cHe will hate this,\u201d the cat said around the knot, mouth full of a helpfulness he could not forbear. \u201cNot because it is clever. Because it is plain. He can\u2019t climb plain.\u201d\n\n\u201cI should like a sentence he cannot climb,\u201d Elias said. He raised his voice exactly as much as he needed to be heard by those near enough to want to hear and not a breath more. \u201cHang them over where water runs,\u201d he called. \u201cSinks that don\u2019t keep their tempers. Pumps. By the well. And say the words when you use them. Not to make a spell. To listen to whether they have changed shape in your mouth.\u201d\n\nThe hush came at two o\u2019clock. It came like snow in a dream: suddenly, totally, and with a ridiculous gentleness that made you forget it had weight. Elias was leaning on the pump handle on the green, showing a boy where it stuck in the downstroke, when the silence dropped and muffled them and left their breath singing under their skin like kettles on an invisible hob. The boy\u2019s mouth opened for a word he always said when he wanted the handle pulled harder and all that came out was a bit of air shaped like a letter with nothing after it. Elias felt his own tongue slip back from certain syllables as if they had become hot and his mouth did not care to be burned. He tried the old household words\u2014yes, no, please, thank you\u2014and found he had them, poor but his. Sorry, though, would not be caught; it scooted to the back of his throat like a mouse who had been a mouse a while and meant to go on.\n\nPeople stood where they were and went still, not with the stillness of prayer but with the stillness of a man who suddenly cannot call his child. Hester did not notice. Hester set her jaw against a thing and it always gave. She laughed at the hush because it had forgotten to take laughter too, and then stopped because Mrs. Hardesty had put both hands to her cheeks and had turned the kind of color that makes a person one sort of liar or another. The mirror-seller turned his mirrors over and over as if they might give him back a sound if he shook them. The apology sheets quivered like a flock catching a draft and then lay flat, very pleased with themselves in a way that made Quill want, for the first time in his elegant life, to shred something without leaving it neat in the end.\n\nElias did the one thing he was always certain of in a minute when he had nothing else to be certain of. He pumped. The pump was an old one and grudged the first pull in any weather and sulked if the weather had changed without telling it. He put his back under the work. He used not strength but steadiness. Water came up like a thing remembering itself; it shouldered into the spout with a growl like a wakeful stomach and fell. He had hung one of Magdalene\u2019s lists of verbs under the bracket just an hour before and now the water ran a finger along the word brew and made it shine, and along the word wash and set a wet edge on it, and along spare and made it look foolish for a second and then grand. He set the cup under, the communal one that tasted faintly of iron and of every mouth that had found itself at the green with its own cup left in the sink, and he drank. He swallowed with deliberation as if the water might be something else if not supervised. He put the cup in Hester\u2019s hands and made the same face at her he would make over any child dawdling with cold porridge.\n\nShe drank. She dabbed at her lip with her knuckle. She said the word impossible for a girl of nine that lives in the hands and then blushed because it came out with a roundness that made an impossible thing soft. \u201cSay please,\u201d Elias told the boy who had wanted the handle pulled, and the boy thought for one courageous second the pumpman had gone mad and then he said it, with a wobble, and his mouth cried out in relief to discover he still had that door. The sorry would come back later; it was not the sort to be fetched with a bucket.\n\nAround them the hush pushed and pressed and found stubbornness in places where it expected compliance. At Magdalene\u2019s, the press went on making the small soft sound it makes when a woman is doing work no one knows about, and the hush could not find a way to get into the oil of that. In the church, Elijah Grieves set his hands on the rope and spoke into his fists the names of his sons and the bell heard and answered and the names did not stick to the clapper but went up and were set to ring and came down again and became bread in Elijah\u2019s mouth when he had been skipping lunches to finish a coffin in time. In Mrs. Troon\u2019s kitchen, where the apology sheet had been pinned above the baby\u2019s cot with too much pride, the baby took his own hand, the left one, and put the knuckles into his mouth and chewed on his fingers and made the sound babies make before they learn any words and it was such a sound that the hush, which had no idea what to do with the untidy, took another step back.\n\nIt would have held, might have held, if Vellum had been content with a single cleverness. He had sent the hush and thought to watch the town press its face to it and leave a shape there and had gone away to map the next cruelty in thin blue pencil and wonder whether there was an economy in saving certain vowels for a storm. But he was not that sort. He could not resist improving a plan. He sent footnotes.\n\nThey fell like moths. They were small slips with glue on the back so old-fashioned women smiled and thought of ration books, and they landed on people\u2019s sleeves and hats and cheeks and carried a word in tiny, neat type: Actually. You could not see it without making yourself into a person who peers. But peering is a habit in towns and so the footnotes stuck and when a woman began to speak about the price of sugar she heard in the back of her head a small voice she would have cached as merely mean, and it said actually and then told her she had not got it quite right, and she paused, and in that pause there is where you can pour poison or tea depending on what country you live in.\n\nElias felt one land on his neck like a fly that had put on its Sunday suit. He slapped it as he had not slapped a thing since he was twelve. It stuck to his palm, and he held it out to Quill, and the cat read it with a narrowed eye. \u201cThis,\u201d the cat said, \u201cis an insect with footnotes attached.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I peel it off in the wrong direction it will tell my skin I have misremembered my own name,\u201d Elias said. He took the edge with two fingernails and lifted. It clung. He lifted more. It did what insinuations do when forced into daylight; it became ridiculous. He held the actually up by its tiny corner and it swayed in an unseen breeze like laundry that has no right to be pretty and yet is. He stuck it to the pump handle. \u201cNot today,\u201d he told it, and meant the habit and the whole damp country the habit lives in.\n\nThe boy with the apology takes\u2014the same boy, you could see him under the shape this job had pressed him to wear\u2014stood with his cap in his hands and tears climbing his throat. \u201cHe said I\u2019d be paid if I didn\u2019t talk,\u201d he muttered, because there are men who put silence on boys like a coat and then wonder why they grow with their arms held oddly. \u201cHe said to pin them as high as I could reach. That makes it work better.\u201d\n\nElias reached out and took his cap and put it back on his head with the care you\u2019d use to position a starling. \u201cThank you for telling me,\u201d he said, and it came out raw because the hush had tried to take thank you and not quite succeeded. \u201cTake off the pins you can reach. He will not end you for it. If he tries, tell him we don\u2019t allow endings on a Saturday.\u201d He gave the boy a list with brew on it and a string. He gave him the cup. He did not give him a word to wear. The boy took the string and it steadied him as if he had been given a pole for a river crossing.\n\nBy evening, the clevernesses had soured in Vellum\u2019s mouth. The hush had settled where hushed people live\u2014under the backs of throats and behind doors men close when a song starts that was not theirs\u2014and the footnotes had stuck to church pews and the underside of crockery and learned nothing. People put flowers over numbers and found they had invented a holiday without meaning to. The mirrors had begun to collect a slick of breath which is the most democratic medium in which to write. With a rag that never got quite clean, Mrs. Coppin wiped I am very tired of this off a glass and felt better in her elbows because the truth had somewhere to be that did not bump her in the night.\n\nQuill slept badly when he slept at all. The liar he had swallowed the day before turned in him as if letters had bones. He lay very still and then shook as if he were dreaming water at the roots of his fur. Elias sat beside him and hated him fiercely for being vulnerable and loved him with a patience he did not give to himself. He dripped chamomile on his tongue and the cat licked as if he had been robbed of the right to be dignified and would reclaim it later with interest. At one point, near dawn, Quill woke enough to say, voice not his and entirely his, \u201cYou must stop him sending the kind that make people polite. The cruel kind a person will argue with. The polite kind builds rooms in them.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d Elias said. He did know. It had been in the little black mouth of the period when he had put it in his pocket, the old instruction of the old law: beware the kindness that reads as charity and tastes of rank. He listened to the town breathing. It was falling into the habit of keeping its own noise, the good noise of spoons, pipe smoke, the bang of a cupboard that somebody in a hurry promised not to do again and would do again and be forgiven because a house without a bang is dead. He took the mirror from the shelf and turned it face down, not because it had done anything that day but because it had looked like it might. He looked at the ribbon on the tin and the soldier on the shelf and touched both without thinking which one first and then noticed, with a dark sort of humor, that it mattered to him and to nobody else.\n\nAt midmorning a thin letter pushed itself under his door like a rat ashamed to be seen but too hungry not to beg. It smelled of paste and the particular grief of rooms with coal without fire. Elias opened it with his thumbnail because knives have their dignity and he would not use one on an envelope that did not deserve it. The handwriting was unexpectedly cramped. Vellum had not learned to look like he had been to school. The letter said three things before it ran aground. It said: I retract. It said: The child by the river would have gone in if I had not. It said: You think because you make your town into a bowl you will keep soup from the floor, but I know the weakness of bowls.\n\nElias folded it. He put it on the table. He did not show it to Quill because the cat had hate for only certain sorts of paper and he did not mean to season the others. He took up Magdalene\u2019s verbs. He thought about bowls. He thought about the way bowls break and are mended with a line of tin so fine the eye likes the scar. He thought about his mother\u2019s ribbon and the way she had tied one end off round a leg and made a cradle of tight cloth for for drying wet boots so they did not warp. He went to the pump.\n\nAt the pump he met not the town but time. Elijah was there, his hair like a thatch the wind had tried to lift and failed because it had been laid with love. Mr. Crisp, who sharpened knives and opinions and sometimes did both too finely. Mrs. Hardesty with both hands scrubbed clean because she was afraid of what her hands might otherwise write. Hester with her pocket weighed down by a mirror and a frog memory and a stolen honesty. And Magdalene with ink on her knuckles as if she had been wagering with a raven and meant to win without letting it have the satisfaction of taking her bright things.\n\n\u201cWe will sing,\u201d Elias said.\n\nHester groaned in anticipation and delight because she saw herself on the point of making a racket with permission. Mr. Crisp began to disapprove by habit. Magdalene looked him in the eye and the disapproval turned into a convenient cough. Elijah set his feet apart like a man making space in himself for a second gear. Mrs. Hardesty had that look people get when they don\u2019t have it in them and are going to anyway.\n\n\u201cNot hymns,\u201d Elias said, because he knew his town. \u201cWe will do the one my mother sang when the wash water goes soapy. We will do the one the men learned when the mill broke and they had to carry their own jaws. We will do the one you only sing when there is something on the floor you can\u2019t look at and you will look at it later but first you must not fall.\u201d He spoke the words forward, not up, and they landed as if the green had put out its palm. \u201cYou know them,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery house knows them.\u201d\n\nThey began badly, which is always a mercy. Hester came in with too much light. Elijah\u2019s low note had a wobble that sounded like a bell getting its legs. Mrs. Hardesty doled out the beat as if it were a ration. Magdalene\u2019s voice was exactly true and too grieved to be beautiful, which made it something else entirely. Quill, who could sing when he wished to, lay with one paw over his nose and hummed in a dignified way because he despised singing that did not yet know what it was about. The pump took the measure and sang about iron. The list of verbs, wet now and gone wavy like hair, spoke its little lines into the falls. The hush came forward to listen. It tried to sit in the laps of the people on the green. It tried to spread itself under them like a blanket and make them mistake that weight for safety. But singing is what breath does when it refuses to be contained, and the hush, which is a liar in a lace cap, hates nothing so much as breath that will go on making itself heard even in a room with the curtains drawn.\n\nThey sang Noon Pot on, and Pick Up, and Put Down, and Sparrows Are Free to Come In and Out, which last is exactly what it sounds like and not a metaphor at all; a ritual for opening the kitchen window when a thing with wings is in the room and the adrenaline makes you stupid. They sang the silly one about the eel in the jar you can\u2019t get back out without breaking the jar and how sometimes the right thing is to break the jar. They sang and the apologies peeled themselves off sleeves as if they worried they would spoil their finery where there was sweat. They sang and the blossoms of footnotes curled at the edges where tea steam got at them and the glue failed and fell in little guilty flakes. They sang and they found sorry again, not because you can sing it back like a name but because the muscle knew the shape of the word when it was used properly and allowed it. People said it and it was ugly and useful and made space where shame had been pretending to be furniture.\n\nVellum heard them, you may be sure. The school\u2019s lower room snarled its damp and still could not muffle the sound of breath being used for something besides apology. He stood with his hands on the press and his cheekbones sharp because he did not eat when he was working and he was always working, and he smiled a schoolmaster\u2019s smile without boys. \u201cYou think this makes you a village,\u201d he said aloud to the iron, because he liked to win his arguments in a room where no one would say he was wrong. \u201cYou think this makes you small enough to avoid the larger ideas.\u201d He ran his thumb over a block that had said faithfully for fifty years at the bottom of invoices and came away with a black mark he would not notice until it had dried and become a bruise people would take for a wound and would not be wrong. \u201cVery well,\u201d he said, to the press, to the part of himself that had never been taught to sing. \u201cLet us see if they fancy a map.\u201d\n\nQuill slept by inches and woke by inches and in the waking had no patience for poetry. \u201cHe will take the names off the fields,\u201d he said, the same way you would say a thing about weather when your bones tell you about it before the sky. \u201cIf the fields don\u2019t have names they go shabby and let anyone in. He will make One, Two, Three, and nobody will know where Daniel\u2019s Oat and Margaret\u2019s Drop and The Square With The Hole In It are. People will say turn left at One and never get home.\u201d\n\nElias put the cup into the cat\u2019s offended mouth. \u201cDrink,\u201d he said. He turned over the bone disk that hung on the wall by the peg\u2014a thing that had been a button and become a token and was now, in its quieter life, both\u2014and read the names he had scratched there in a boy\u2019s hand with a nail the day he had first been given tea at Magdalene\u2019s: Daniel\u2019s Oat. Margaret\u2019s Drop. The Square With The Hole In It. The Cop, which everyone called that and no one knew why. He felt his name for them press back as if a child had put his palm against his in a game. He thought about the ache under his shoulder, which had moved again, west this time, into the part of him that always insisted he could carry more than he ought. He thought about a man downstairs in a school who believed in lines and thought they should be straight. He tied his scarf and did not bother to get the ends even. \u201cCome on,\u201d he said to Quill, to Hester perched on the step like a bird in possession of a house, to himself. \u201cWe\u2019re walking the fields.\u201d\n\nThey took paths whose ownership was a quarrel in three counties and a religion in two cottages, and Elias put his hand on every stile. He listened on the top of the wooden steps for whether the field on the far side said its name back to him and when it did not he said it to the air and nailed it there without nails. In Daniel\u2019s Oat, there was a plan under the ground like a frost pattern on glass: long lines and right angles and little squares numbered with a drafting-minded malice. He stood with his feet in the requisite furrow and told the plan it could have his boots but not the shape of the man inside them. He stamped. The pattern rattled and went you do not understand the economy of this, Elias, and he said yes, I do, it\u2019s called smaller wages and larger secrets, and the frost crawled away to find a muddy puddle to look noble in.\n\nThey crossed into Margaret\u2019s Drop, where the ground had a habit of pitching you slightly toward the ditch no matter how sober you were, and he said the name and felt the field find the weight of it again. Hester ran ahead and took a candy from her pocket and broke it in two and then in two again and if you worry about such things you will be pleased to know she accounted for the fractions out loud as if there were a mathematical ghost in the grass who could be soothed by sweet and sums. Quill leaped from post to post with a care for mud princely and absurd, then dropped into the ruts like a common cat and came out with one paw black and his dignity badly dinged and licked it until the field, which had been considering giving up and becoming a lawn, remembered that it liked beasts.\n\nBy the time the light was gold and unambitious, they had walked the Square With The Hole In It and the Cop and two whose names Elias had not scratched on his button but could find with his soles: One With Three Stone Teeth, and The Afterthought. In three of them were staked small neat signs with numbers: Field 4. Lot 2. Parcel 7. This was the cleverness: the numbers had been pressed in with a traveling stamp until the post itself had learned them, an ache in the grain. Elias took off his scarf and wrapped it round the first post and leaned a moment until he felt the number give a little, like a stiff knee when you put your hand under the back of it and say, come on then, bend. He took the second post in his arms and felt ridiculous and refused to mind. He put his forehead to the third and told it a joke about a plough and a priest and the field did not laugh but the post eased and that was enough.\n\nOn their way home, with the sky taking its coins back and the hedges pretending they had never had faces, they passed under the school\u2019s windows. In one of them, just visible if you were the sort who looked, a paper hung with a drawing on it so elegant in its cruelty it made Magdalene catch her breath in her kitchen and drop a spoon she would not admit she loved. It was a map of Andover without names. It had the streets. It had the curve of the river and the mistakes the builders had made and never told anyone. It had the rooflines like a deck of cards laid wrong. It had no Margaret\u2019s, no Daniel\u2019s, no Mr. Crisp, no Hester, no Magdalene. At the bottom, in a hand that did not belong to printing and did not care, was written: There. Is that better.\n\nElias put his hand against the glass and felt the shape of a man\u2019s satisfaction on the other side like the heat of a kettle you\u2019ve set to boiling and forgotten until it sings. He did not break the window, not because he could not have but because he had not brought a broom. He said the names to the pane. The glass fogged. The map did not take them. It did not listen. It was, after all, not a thing but an idea about a thing. He lowered his hand. He looked at the sky, which had got on with its own business and was pulling its dark up over one knee like a girl with a ladder in her stocking. He stood until he came away cold.\n\nThat night the town dreamed of turning left at One and finding Hester\u2019s pocket mirror hung in a hedge to tell you which way was west and making a face at it because it would not get to be that sort of authority. Elias slept on his side with Quill between his chest and his bent knees, the cat a warm, earnestly purring comma. In the drawer with the spoons, a tiny amount of cat hair collected on the silver handles, which made Elias smile in his sleep without knowing why. The ribbon over the pamphlets held, and the pamphlets sulked and imagined a future in which they would be framed and taken out at bedtime to frighten adolescents and were disappointed without understanding they were being told their own ending.\n\nIn the morning there would be small spoils: Mr. Bobbin\u2019s violin would have learned a tune it had not known; Elijah Grieves would ring the bell a fraction late and not care; Mrs. Hardesty would hand a sausage to a child who had not asked and say That one is on the house and then be unable to stop herself from blushing and scolding to hide how right it felt; Magdalene would find the word lend under her thumb and it would make a small dent in her skin that lasted an hour and reminded her of a time when she had meant to be somebody else and had chosen instead to be exactly what she was and had not, for a single day since, regretted the economy of it. Vellum would draw a new line, straighter, and an old paper boat would give up pretending to float in a bowl that ought to have had soup in it and sink without drama. The dot in Elias\u2019s pocket would sit and sit and at some point he would take it out and set it on the table and it would look like dirt and he would laugh and Quill would consider the laugh and allow it.\n\nHe did not write, that night, the thing the letter had asked him to pretend had been written already. He did not retract anything that needed keeping. He put his finger on the list by the broom and wrote in his awful hand rest, and under it wrote rest again, and under it wrote sweep and then drew a line and wrote bread and then put the pencil down because it was only a pencil and men have gone astray with worse and better. He slept and in his sleep his mother came into the room that was a memory and told him not to point because it was rude, and he did, and she laughed, which is how boys survive their mothers\u2019 rules, and then he woke and the day began again in the way days do when you mean to get them right and can\u2019t but will keep trying because you have the words.8. Errata\n\nSunday found Andover shining itself up as if for company. The air had the brittle brightness of a glass knocked into light and not yet broken. Men shaved properly; women pinned their hair with the pins they kept for visitors. The bells moved Elijah Grieves the way the river moved a leaf\u2014by habit, by love, by something older than either\u2014and the first sound they made was almost right and then right because the town had decided to let it be. Elias woke before the bells. He lay still and listened to the house think about him. It had decided he was not a bad bargain. Quill, who had slept hard as a comma wedged between two clauses, stretched up the length of Elias\u2019s ribs and yawned in his face with a breath like chamomile and old sarcasm.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll have printed God by now,\u201d Quill remarked, as if the information could be taken or left without consequence. \u201cTiny and neat. He\u2019ll hand Him around on cards with a piece of string. Men will wear Him in their hats.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf He takes offense,\u201d Elias said, \u201cHe\u2019ll have to stand in line.\u201d He sat and put his feet on the floor and felt the ache that spoke east last night, west at dusk, declare itself a new compass point that existed only for this day: inwards, under the breastbone, where old promises rest. He dressed without thinking and came out odd and then even, which happens when the hands have known the day\u2019s shape and the mind has not caught up. On the back of the chair hung the scarf he had not straightened. He grinned at it for having chosen sides.\n\nThe vicar, who was only sometimes a man and more often a question with his collar on, knocked at Elias\u2019s door with an embarrassment he had not been born with. Elias admired men who had acquired embarrassments as you admire men who have acquired skills late by hard practice. \u201cElias,\u201d the vicar said, leaning in with his hat in both hands like a penitent, \u201cbefore you come\u2014if you do come\u2014there\u2019s a thing I should say. Someone\u2019s put a paper. On the pulpit. It has notes for my sermon I didn\u2019t write. I\u2019m not sure what I\u2019m supposed to do about it. They\u2019re proper notes. Footnotes. With little numbers.\u201d\n\n\u201cTake the numbers off,\u201d Elias said kindly. He did not mean from the speech; he meant from the man. He reached for the vicar\u2019s fingers, which had hymnal dust in the creases, and put a thumb into the seam of his hand and rubbed until the skin remembered itself as skin and not paper. \u201cIf the words on the slip ask you to say \u2018deliver us from discomfort\u2019 instead of \u2018deliver us from evil,\u2019 take it as a suggestion from a person who cannot tell one from the other. And under no circumstances let the notes tell people to sit through the bit they should stand for.\u201d\n\nThe vicar laughed unhappily. His laugh had a gap in it where a tooth had gone when he was twelve, running and not looking, and some part of him had never forgiven the lane. \u201cYou make it sound easy,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI make it sound plain,\u201d Elias returned. \u201cCome to my step when you are done and shake your hands out. The rope left numbers on them yesterday. We must not let prayers do the same. They have enough to answer for without arithmetic.\u201d\n\nThe church had put itself together with a stern prettiness that always made Elias think of girls being told to remember which fork. The memorial tablets along the nave had been polished to a better self and glowed. The whole place smelled of beeswax, starch, men\u2019s necks and women\u2019s patience. Elias went in at the back because cats do not love being made to choose between a cushion and a knee, and Quill had opinions about velvet. He trotted along the pew tops like a baron inspecting property and leaped to a beam where he could look pious without blasphemy.\n\nPeople filled the wooden pens by household habit rather than God\u2019s governance. Mrs. Hardesty balanced piety with her shop, head up as if to dare the Lord to mind her sausages. Mr. Bobbin had brought his fiddle in its case with him because he did not trust the house to leave it alone; he held it like a child he would have wanted without believing he deserved. Hester Stowe slid between her mother and Mrs. Troon with the baby and produced her stolen mirror, which she hung by its rough edge on the hook where hymn numbers should go and then covered with a handkerchief because even a vain thing may serve if humiliated into humility. Magdalene Plum sat with her hands folded like a woman whose palms have not been without ink for twenty years. She had washed them. The ink had considered and stayed.\n\nOn the pulpit lay the paper. It had a look that wanted to be official without the authority to be so, the way a boy in his father\u2019s hat looks like a jest unless you love him. The vicar glanced at it and put both hands on the edges as if to hold it to one side of the sermon as you would a naughty child in a crowd. He began with the words no one remembered having decided were the right ones to begin with, and the hush, which had been crouched in the rafters peering down into everyone\u2019s throats, slid itself to the edge to listen.\n\nThe footnotes waited. They were printed in such a respectful type that if you squinted you might be moved to admire the authority even as it began its insults. At the bottom of the page a number 1 asked him to add \u2018for those of us who do not dabble\u2019 after the prayer for those who go out into the town to serve. A small 2 wanted him to replace the word wicked with wayward. Number 3 was giddy with its own cleverness; it had a Latin phrase that meant nothing in Latin and was meant to make the men feel that their tongues had chosen a side. The vicar cleared his throat and chose to be poor in Latin that day. He used wicked and meant it. He came to the prayer for the town and its water, and the hush leaned very hard and tried to keep him from saying river, and he took a breath and said Anton with his mouth open as if he were asking a question and the bell above heard and answered it.\n\nElias felt the sting of something sly in the beam. He lifted his face. Along the memorial tablets, the big ones for men who had made the town applaud them and the little ones for boys who had not done themselves the good or harm of living long, there ran a faint shadow like thin smoke. It was not smoke. It was an eraser in a good suit. It took the tiny raised serif off Elijah Grieves\u2019s dead son\u2019s name and made it look misspelled, then thought better and put a number beside it as if the boy had been a note to the line. On the tablet to Mrs. Bell\u2019s mother, who had delivered half of Andover and had died in a chair by the fire with her apron on because she had not meant to go yet, the word mother flickered and wanted to be matron, and then midwife, and then attendant, and then nothing, only a space where a woman might stand unnoticed all her life and the town would only think to praise the floor once it had gone.\n\nElias moved into the aisle without asking the aisle\u2019s leave. The vicar faltered and then did not because the thing in his hands felt the weight of a man walking with intent and did not wish to be laughed at for its hollowness. Elias laid his palm on the bottom right of Mrs. Bell\u2019s mother\u2019s brass and felt the shape of the name that was not up but under. He had no right to be here without being family. He was family by use. He said the woman\u2019s name under his breath and under his breath there was the ribbon round a hair and the way she had said Now, girl, breathe, which is the way men should have been taught to enter rooms all their lives. The brass warmed under his hand. It took patience to coax good truth from metal; metal has been told what to be for so long it forgets it can ring when it is asked correctly. He did not press. He waited. Under his fingers, the faint, fidgeting desire to be official gave up, and the word mother deepened its groove.\n\nQuill, up on his beam, clawed at a thin nothing that had caught on one of his whiskers. He pinned it to the wood and read it with distaste. \u201cErrata,\u201d he said under his breath, and a boy three rows back who had come because his mother had insisted and meant to count how many nails were in the pew in front of him tasted the word and had to spit into his handkerchief because his mouth was not made to carry such sourness with silence.\n\nIt moved fast when you watched where it tried to be slow. On the memorial for Elijah\u2019s son, the number softened, then ran. Elias smudged it with his thumb deliberately and put a dot where it had been without writing it and it sat, prim as an aunt expecting cake, and made the place where the mischief had been feel finished in a way that nothing nasty can stand. He went as a man goes along benches when he must leave in a hurry, touching, not stopping. He put a hand on the stone for the man who had funded the school and taken the money back and died anyway and said, not kindly, not unkindly, \u201cYour wife is not short for your achievement.\u201d The stone did not argue; it did not, in fairness, have a leg to stand on.\n\nWhen the prayer was done and the footnotes had sulked themselves into quiet ink, the vicar shut the book. He saw Elias in the aisle and looked briefly like a man offered a bowl just when his hands have learned to carry three plates. He made a face that warned the footnotes he might collect offerings with his head up and the footnotes whispered in affront about proper liceity and collapsed into their own type. The hymn after, an innocuous one about wheat, went like it always does in towns where people have seen famine from the wrong end: tentative, then full, then soft at the last line where the simile comes and makes you cry in front of your neighbors if you\u2019re not careful. The hush tried to sing and choked on its own breath. It took itself away to sulk in the vestry. The footnotes tried to get people\u2019s attention in the lane and no one read them because dinners had been put on and timing is a magic as good as any.\n\nAs they came out into the sharp midday, Elijah Grieves put both hands into Elias\u2019s and made the face of a man who has dropped a weight of steel and been handed a bag of flour in its place. \u201cHe had rounded my boy off,\u201d he said. \u201cThought to make him cleaner by taking off what his letters had. Thank you.\u201d His gratitude had no bow on it. It was meat. Elias took it and swallowed and did not think of Vellum\u2019s soup.\n\nOn the path, the vicar shook his hands as instructed and made a little breath like a boy told well done for something he did not know he had done and wanted to claim with both fists. \u201cThere was a note,\u201d he said, not ashamed. \u201cAt the bottom of the page, after If there are any who are to be present in the holy estate of matrimony. It said, instead of Speak now or forever hold your peace, it suggested the phrase Speak now or apply at the office. I may have said something rude under my breath. God will forgive me.\u201d He looked sideways the way men do before they say a thing they are afraid makes them sound weak. \u201cIf he writes my mother on a card,\u201d he added, \u201cI shall not read the card aloud. Is that permitted.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is required,\u201d Elias said. \u201cYou must not let a stranger put your mother where everyone can see her for the first time.\u201d He had to leave then because his chest had been pierced by a fool with thin ink who could not have known where to aim; the word mother had laid itself against his ribs with a weight like wet wool.\n\nBack on his step he found a boy had been. The boy had hands that shook as if he had made a choice against supervision. He had left a thing that did not look like Vellum\u2019s at all. It had been written in a crabbed hand on a scrap cut ragged with a table knife. It said Sorry I helped and under it, in a handwriting older than his, was written I know. Elias put his hand on his table. It was steady enough. He put the scrap under the ribbon as if he were teaching two words to lie down together and not mate. Quill leaped up beside it and looked away because when cats grant privacy to paper, men should do the same.\n\nErrata slips came heavy as flies after that, on plates, on tins, in pockets. Mrs. Hardesty reached into her apron and found one that said, in the small voice that always knows best, butcheress and she snarled and threw it in the fat and the fat popped as if you had insulted a woman who had been very good this morning and did not deserve it. Mamie Coppin lifted her teapot and discovered the word mean where steam should be and she put in a bay leaf and told the cleverness to steep, and it became the color of an old bruise and swam to the top and she skimmed it off and sprinkled it on the geranium, which surprised everyone by surviving.\n\nThe worst of it came not to a woman used to argument and knives, nor to a man who had practiced saying no and yes in public, but to Mrs. Bell, the midwife. She met Elias on the corner by the shop with a bundle of paper in her apron and her face arranged very neatly, which is what grief does when it has a job. \u201cHe has a list,\u201d she said without preface. \u201cNot my list. I keep the names of babies. It makes their first morning heavier so they don\u2019t blow away. He has cut mine up and put mine on cards with spaces where his pen has not been and he has made a binder. He will bring it as a gift when a woman goes hard in her labor. He thinks he is being modern.\u201d\n\nElias took the bundle from her without the ceremony his hands wanted because ceremony would have put a lace cap on madness. He sat on the stoop of the abandoned shop that had never kept a grocer long because it liked to be empty and spread the spoiled names on his knees like a fortune-teller with cards she does not trust. The paper had not been torn; it had been clipped with a precision that meant to be flattering and failed. The names had been put into a new order. Not order by the day and the evening and the two a.m. that had required Mrs. Bell to put on her boots and go out in a nightgown and her shawl. This order was by weight and color and whether the father had signed. Numbers had crept up the margins like damp. In a neat hand that had pleased Magdalene once on an invoice a year ago and displeased her now by association was written Above Average, and after it a list of boys; Below Average, and after it a list that had girls in it like thunder.\n\nMrs. Bell breathed as women do when they have been told to be polite in other people\u2019s tragedy and have decided they would be and still mean to kill, later, with a kindness. \u201cIf I go and cut his paper up,\u201d she said, \u201cit will make another boy that boy and he will become the sort who makes lists. I would rather break his thumb.\u201d\n\n\u201cStrings first,\u201d Elias said. He stacked the cleverness and pulled the long loop of hair-ribbon from his pocket. It would not be enough; ribbons never are. He had a spool of twine in his bag and felt for it without looking, a man who always knows where his own thread is. He tied the cards back into bundles where the names had belonged. He did not do it well. He did it twice and then again and the third time the knot sat properly and sulked. \u201cKeep yours in a box under your bed,\u201d he told Mrs. Bell. \u201cPut a kettle on top. If a man with a binder comes, we will rearrange his fingers into a new order.\u201d\n\nMrs. Bell laughed in the soundless way that means a woman has decided not to let crying take up space it cannot pay for. \u201cI will tell her to breathe,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I will tell her that knowing the word under the word is the only thing that makes a birth go right.\u201d She touched Elias\u2019s sleeve. It was not gratitude. It was exactly this: a midwife leaving some truth she could not fit in her pockets on a man\u2019s arm because she had to go and could not take it with her.\n\nBy midafternoon, the list-making had turned to maps again. The signs staked in the fields had multiplied in the night like a complaint that catches; a new one stood at the gap to the path where boys went to avoid being seen going to smoke. FIELD 1. PARCEL 5. The words sat neat on metal and made the hedge look guilty for having grown with its own shape instead of any square. Hester had her hands in her pockets and a pebble in her mouth to keep from saying things the vicar would borrow and put in a sermon and not return. \u201cHe\u2019s making a game,\u201d she said, her eyes hot because injustice made her cry not like a girl, like Hester. \u201cHe thinks we\u2019ll forget our names and be grateful when he gives us numbers to pin to them as if they were clean shirts.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will make him play something stupid,\u201d Elias said. He had a child\u2019s comfort in the foolish. \u201cHopscotch,\u201d he added, because remembrance has squares in it, too, and a thrown stone and a rule about stepping where you shouldn\u2019t. He chalked nine boxes on the green where chalk had lately been idolatrous and not been liked for it, and the action pleased him for its insolence. In the first he put the word here. In the second, the word now. In the third, the word bread. In the fourth and fifth, he put two small drawings like those Hester made when she was meant to be following sums; one of a cat, haughty as a mayor, one of a bell. In the sixth, he left it empty because not everything needs to be said to be counted. In the seventh and eighth he put the words speak and listen. In the ninth he wrote stay.\n\nHester watched him as if gathering new techniques for warfare to be employed at kitchen tables when you are too short to be impressive. \u201cYou\u2019ve made a game out of words,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve made words into a game,\u201d he corrected. \u201cJump.\u201d She jumped, and the stone he had set to throw\u2014a small, smooth thing you would have kept in your pocket after finding it for years\u2014landed on listen and obliged her to skip with her mouth shut, which nearly killed her and made her grin as if she had invented discipline. The green liked it. The green always liked it when games were played with fairness and the right amount of cheating and no bets that meant dusk took more than the afternoon had given.\n\nVellum, meanwhile, sat in the below-room with the window that made the light look like water trying to be useful in a bucket and drew a line he thought might please someone he had never met and never would. He had not slept. He did not look like a man who had not slept. He looked like a word that had been kept out of a sentence and would not forgive the omission. The crow, which was not a bird but had the habit of one the way a door has the habit of opening, sat on the press and made small motions with its beak as if pins were a delicacy and it had acquired a taste for them at someone else\u2019s expense. Vellum wrote in the margin of the map the words: it will be easier, then struck out easier and wrote better and then struck out better and wrote necessary and did not notice that his hand shook because there are tremblings that have nothing to do with cold.\n\nWhen he sent the next thing, he was too clever by half. He had discovered an old trick: errata not in the present but in the past. He slid thin slips into the parish register where the births were and the deaths and the little line that read baptised and the long line that read illegitimate which had been put there by a man fifty years ago who could not bear to have his theology contradicted by biology and so wrote it down and felt tidy. The slips were so convincing that if you did not know a thing you would swallow them whole and not know it; they did not look like additions, they looked like just the way it had been all along. Mr. Bobbin, who had been told all his life he had hands for iron and never for catgut, went to the book and found a note beneath his baptism written in a small hand and a smaller voice: not musical. It made his wrists cold. Mrs. Hardesty found that her mother\u2019s death had been attributed to intemperance when it had been a fever as ordinary and as deadly as any and she swore aloud in the church because there are decencies and then there are decencies.\n\nElias went through the side door with Quill in his bag because not even God was going to keep him out with ink in the rafters. The clerk had the sort of scar between his eyebrows that had been a wrinkle once and then hardened into proof he had tried to use his face to think for too long. He looked at Elias as if to say this is not your province. Elias laid his hand on the book as if it were a cat. He did not flip past the flyleaf, which had its own ideas about being valuable. He turned pages until he came to his own mother\u2019s name and he stopped because the book knew how to make him do that. He had not done this before. He had not let anyone too tidy put their finger near it. He read the line. He read the neat hand that was not the vicar\u2019s of the time and not any hand he knew and he read the small word at the edge in the new ink and the word said away and it had not been written by God.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Elias told it. He did not speak to the book. He spoke to the paper put on the paper. He touched his pocket where the period had sat all morning and had decided to live there the way some animals decide on a particular rock. He lifted it out and set it at the edge of the page, not on the terrible word, near it, like a bowl set near a drunk man, ready. \u201cYou have put an end where there was a gap,\u201d he said softly. \u201cI will not allow that.\u201d He slid the dot over the away, and it did not smear; it sat and stared at the additive until it looked like a stranger in a kitchen at night. The extra letters, which had thought to be indispensable as a teaspoon, found they had only been the gleam on one. They went flat. He moved the dot back and left the place clean and raw as it had always been. \u201cI know what away means,\u201d he said to no one and to everyone. \u201cIt does not mean gone.\u201d\n\nThe clerk, who had not the habit of weeping because his father had told him it was a thing men paid women to do, wiped his nose with his sleeve and let himself feel as if he had found a coin in a pocket he had sewed up himself. \u201cI didn\u2019t know one could argue with these,\u201d he admitted, astonished to hear his voice casual as bread in his own mouth.\n\n\u201cYou can,\u201d Elias said. \u201cThey lie if you don\u2019t.\u201d He took the pen, because you are allowed to take a pen if your fingers know how to hold a child by the ankle and check for splinters, and wrote in the margin in his poor hand very small the words checked, and under them, in smaller, the truth as a thing held between two people and not printed. He did not make a sermon of it. He made a note to himself with a witness. He laid the ribbon he had been allowed across the page the way a woman lays a washcloth on a fevered head. The paper sighed without rustle. It is embarrassing, sometimes, to be saved.\n\nWhen he came out into the yard, he spoke to the town because he would have had to go home otherwise and sit with tea and the door and the ache and he could not yet. He stood by the chestnut, which had known three generations of boys by their knife marks and had resigned itself to a life of scars. \u201cSay your names,\u201d he said to the people going by with their yawns and their plans. \u201cFirst and last and middle if you have one. Say the ones you don\u2019t use. Say the ones your grandmother called you that nobody would let you write. Say the ones you made up and never told anyone because you were eight and thought you\u2019d be someone else. Say them aloud, in order, and then go buy onions.\u201d It was absurd. It was a man putting a cup into the hands of a storm and asking it to pour. It worked because it was absurd. Magdalene said Magdalene Eunice Plum without blush and the town heard Eunice and stored it where it keeps lace. Mr. Bobbin said Tobias and then Bobbin and then in a small voice the name his wife had not been allowed to put on the stone and the stone in his chest shifted to make room. Mrs. Hardesty said Jane like a door shutting properly and felt the weight of the truth of a small name. Hester put her hands in her pockets and said Hester Hester Hester and then added Stowe as if it were her own idea and the men who named things glanced reluctantly down and had to write it.\n\nBy late afternoon the map in the school window had acquired names it had not intended to. Someone with a less neat hand and a better idea of the town had chalked Daniel\u2019s Oat across Field 2 and drawn an arrow meaning that definitely includes the hedge and if you don\u2019t like it you can climb it. Someone else had put Margaret\u2019s Drop where it belonged and added in the margin, mind the ditch, and a third, perhaps Hester, perhaps a boy she would shortly marry or fight, had written The Square With The Hole In It and drawn an indelicate picture beside it that made Vellum smile and then hate himself for smiling. The not-crow pecked at the chalk marks and came away with grit on its tongue and sulked because pins were sweeter.\n\nAt dusk, when respectable towns begin to be their less respectable selves and respectable men their more, the errata slowed. There is only so much correction one mind can pay attention to in a day. There are only so many polite cruelties you can display before the thin satisfaction of them leaks out and you remember you have soups to eat. Vellum sat with his hand on the press and looked at the painted soldier that had nothing to do with anything and everything to do with the boy who had been told not to point. He put his finger out and touched it and hated himself so thoroughly for the longing that the hate made a mark on his skin. He wrote a short letter, the sort that makes a man late for his dinner because he wants the sound of the words and not the sense. It said: Make a bargain with me. It said: I will take your mother out of my mouth if you take your town out of yours. It said: you do not know how to be quiet. He did not send it. He tore it up into pieces so small even a crow with pins for a palate would not bother.\n\nElias, who had said names until his tongue went woolly and did not mind, sat on his step and ate bread with jam and a ridiculous peace in it. Quill lay with his front paws straight and his back paws ridiculous and watched a fly with admiration for its adherence to its own brief. Hester came with her mirror and her head up like a girl who has decided not to audition for the parts she is offered and sat without being asked and without being trouble. \u201cWhat will he do next,\u201d she demanded, taking a bite of bread as if she meant to bite a sentence.\n\n\u201cHe will send numbers to charity,\u201d Elias said. \u201cHe will ration kindness. He will issue tickets for grief. He will say how many tears are appropriate per day, per death, per season. He will make goodness into something you line up for and resent.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd we will not,\u201d Hester said, not as question and not as boast. She had learned already to take the day by the scruff. \u201cWhat will we do.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will hang the verbs by the pump,\u201d Elias said. \u201cWe will say the names already in our mouths. We will write small notes in books that look like God. We will lay ribbons on paper. We will drink when it is time and go on speaking when the hush sits down and we will sing ill and well. We will take the pins out of things that ought to keep their motion. We will be ridiculous enough that cleverness sulks and goes to bed without supper.\u201d\n\n\u201cWill we win,\u201d Hester asked, as if you could ask a question like that and have it be treated with all the seriousness in the world and all the flippancy too.\n\n\u201cWe will not lose in ways that please him,\u201d Elias said. The dark came up the lane with its hands in its pockets like a boy. It stood at the end of the street and watched him and did nothing to him that he had not invited. \u201cAnd we will know where the tea is kept.\u201d\n\nQuill, who had made a profession of disdain for vows and a vocation of keeping them, put his chin on Elias\u2019s knee and made a sound like milk boiling, which is how some cats purr when they do not want you to know. He lifted his head a little and added, as if it were a detraction and not a benediction, \u201cYou should sleep. Tomorrow he will do something very boring and we will have to be clever against boredom, which is the most dangerous of enemies.\u201d\n\nElias tipped his head back against the door and looked at the sky, which had unhelpfully not arranged itself to show him which way to choose. He had, of late, stopped believing the sky was meant to instruct him and gone back to asking the floor. The floor had said sweep and he had done what he was told. He stood and closed the door and set the kettle where it belonged and wrote on the list on the back of his door the word mend, and under it, the word rest, and found that if you put them together they make the little sound you hear when a woman sits down and does not yet get up.\n\nHe slept with the dot on the table and not in his pocket because you must teach magic to trust the furniture, which is where life lives. Vellum dreamed of a field with no names and woke with the taste of someone else\u2019s hunger in his mouth and stood with his hand on the press until the metal cooled and remembered it was iron and not a question. The river turned under the bridge and looked up at the sky and decided it would not be taking anyone today without asking, and the town replied with the disagreeable contentment of a house that has been cleaned and will be dirty again in a minute, and both facts can be borne.10. Allowances\n\nMonday woke like a book that had been put back on the shelf with a leaf inside, saving someone\u2019s place, and the leaf had learned to read in the dark and had things to report. The low air had the starch of laundries about it, as if the sky had ironed itself and then forgotten what shape men wanted. Elias did not mind a dressed day when he had time to undress it gently, but he had slept with the dot on the table and it had rolled against his fingers twice in the night as if it were a chick or a headache, and he knew that the business of undoing would begin before his tea. Quill had taken the liberty of being both tender and rude in his sleep; he had rearranged himself across Elias\u2019s ribs like a punctuation mark with legal opinions and woken him twice by sneezing, which a cat will do if it believes the air has intruded on its person. When Elias swung his feet to the floor, the house shook itself as a settled bird does, not displeased to discover it still had its man.\n\nThey brought them in baskets the color of the postman\u2019s temper on wet days, and they were stamped with a crown and a seal and a line that claimed legality the way a child claims a pebble and expects everyone to agree the whole beach is his. Coupons, people said without being taught to, and they were right and wrong, right because the paper had been cut by a hard mind into small useful shreds, wrong because usefulness does not always sit in pieces. The books were blue, but not the kind that comforts; they had the sadness of ledgers and the creak of swings under grown men. Inside were neat perforations, and on each perforation in a hand that had meant to be merciful was printed a kindness. One read: two minutes of sympathy, transferable. Another: one listening, uninterrupting, may be redeemed on Tuesdays and Thursdays at the convenience of the listener. There were strips for patience and for civility and for the thing a man says when a child breaks a plate and he decides not to teach with a shout, and at the back, in a pocket that made Mrs. Hardesty\u2019s left eye twitch as if it had remembered ration books and the way hunger looks in the mirror, there were Special Allowances: three for grief, one for wild joy, one for rage if used with precautions and an adult present.\n\nThey came with people who had never taken a penny from a hand that did not wish to give one. Good men brought them and women with proper collars and a girl with a nervous lip who had learned to clench it between words and now could not let it go. \u201cTo avoid abuse,\u201d these people said, and their voices had the glaze of meetings on them, and they held out the books with both hands like wafers. \u201cSo that everyone has a share. So that the generous are not made destitute. So that the loud do not take all the air.\u201d For a minute in and among the geese on the green and the voices of men going to their Monday and the smell of cheap soap trying to be lemon, the town listened as if it were possible to put a bit of fairness into a pocket and not have it cut a hole on the way in.\n\nBy ten, Hester had already tried to buy a sorry with a patience and been told that the exchange rate was set in a printed notice and would she please not be sarcastic until after noon. She put both hands in her pockets and told the woman with the notice\u2014who was Mrs. Cray, who had never been in charge of anything but her hair and was doing badly by it\u2014that she would prefer to be sarcastic before noon because the light then was better. Elias took a book from the timid boy who had brought it and looked at it like a man making himself admire a hat a neighbor had made. He turned the pages and did not touch the perforations, because things with teeth in their edges like to be fed. Quill ran a whisker down the spine and sneezed again because sincerity in ink had always brought on a mild allergy.\n\n\u201cIt is a clever cruelty,\u201d Quill said finally, as if he was granting a rival the compliment of a nod across a battlefield. \u201cHe has made kindness into a cupboard. He will ration the cups. He will say who washes them. He will make a schedule and when a man is late for his civility, he will be fined.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will be poorer if we count it,\u201d Elias said. He put the book on the table and did the impolite thing; he wrote in his own hand through the printed word. He made loops and they were not tidy loops and Magdalene would have thrown a rag at him for the blot, but it was his and it said on the inside cover: you cannot keep soup with pins. He went out with the book in his pocket because you must learn the shape of a weapon before you teach people to ignore it. On the threshold, he touched the lintel and told the house he might be late to his noon, and the house held its breath and then let it go with an audible patience that struck him as indecently moving.\n\nThe queue had already formed by the pump. It did not know it was a queue; it thought it was a group of people all of whom had happened to think of water at the same time, which is what queues pretend when they are in fields and not in offices. A man stood at the head of it with the kind of authority that men take up when the sash is handed to them and they do not look at the sash closely enough to see the moth holes. He had a pin in his lapel and a notebook with a ribbon and a brass pencil that made him very happy in a way that did not want to be considered vulgar and was. \u201cKindnesses,\u201d he said into the air as if someone had asked what time the train goes, \u201care to be requested with the coupon attached. The volunteer with the kettle may redeem and initial. No more than one wild joy per day per family. Exceptions by special application.\u201d He wore an expression that was aiming for benign and could not settle there, the way a wasp will aim for jam but the jam has a skin on.\n\nShort John stood behind him with his hands hanging like two question marks and no answers. He had on a sash he had not been born to and his face was pale in the way faces go pale when a boy is praised for something that has not grown in the soil of him. In his pocket were more books and he jostled them with a knee in a way that told Elias, who knew pockets like a man knows the mouths of kettles, that Short John knew he ought not be where he was. He caught Elias\u2019s eye with the desperate dignity of a child caught playing king; he did not blush, because that would have given the game away, and the lack of blush made Elias want to put his hand on the back of the boy\u2019s neck in a way nobody would like.\n\nMrs. Troon came with the baby who had a Tuesday in him and a foot that liked water and exercised more caution than anyone thought. She handed over a coupon: one sympathy, good for five minutes, valid this week only. The man with the brass pencil took it between finger and thumb and held it up to the light as if sorrys have watermarks, and he inclined his head and wrote Mrs. Troon on a line with a little flourish that meant I am paid for doing this by admiration, and Magdalene appeared at his left shoulder with a look that suggested she would like to take that flourish and feed it to him. \u201cNo,\u201d she said very politely, which is a word that tells men to stop or the tea will be spilled on their pants. \u201cYou will go to my shop. You will sit on my stool. You will count this in ink until ink refuses to be counted. Leave my pump alone.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is for equitable distribution,\u201d the man said, with the haughtiness of someone who has read a pamphlet about equity. \u201cWe must ensure that the town is not prey to the generous. We must ensure that certain people do not take advantage.\u201d He glanced by accident toward Hester and then looked very quickly away, as if her face had a habit of pulling the meanings off sentences and he did not wish to be stripped in public. Hester grinned because she had done just that.\n\nElias took the man\u2019s notebook from his carefully correct hands and looked at the ribbon. It had been chosen by a woman; it had learned the shape of her fingers and was ashamed of its work. \u201cI have a ledger for you,\u201d he said, because you must always offer to rehome a thing that is being misused before you burn it. \u201cIt is on a wide table. It has a bowl of small apples beside it. It is called the commons. You do not write in anyone\u2019s column. You write in your own. Each day you write what you have taken and what you have brought. You write forgive myself for not bringing soup on Thursday to Mrs. Hardesty and then you bring her a sausage on Friday because she has not eaten, and then you write the kind of truth that makes your hands good, for instance I told a lie about my neighbor\u2019s daughter to see if my tongue still worked, and it did, and I would like to trade that for two hours of sweeping. You do it because your hands know it is right, not because I initial.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo initialing,\u201d Magdalene confirmed, sweet and deadly. \u201cNo ribbons. No brass pencils. No hats. You may use a burnt stick and the back of your hand if you must, so long as you wash after.\u201d She looked over the man\u2019s shoulder and saw the long morning where he had been taught to earn his keep by preventing other people from becoming less precise, and her mouth softened very slightly because she was not cruel and because a woman with a press knows where to set and where to let go.\n\nThe pump insisted upon its own say in the matter, being a democratic sort of iron. It had drunk water for forty years and spit it back with dignity for almost as long, and it would not be told when to be generous by a booklet with perforations. Elias wrapped Magdalene\u2019s wet list of verbs around the handle. He took Quill\u2019s actually from yesterday and stuck it with a fingernail to the man\u2019s lapel, because there are insects it is rude not to return when someone has brought them to a gathering. Then he stood back and let Mrs. Troon put her cup under the fall as if she had done it when she was a girl, because she had. The groan in the pump\u2019s first stroke went down into the ground and woke the good idea that had been sleeping under the green since someone decided to lay it flat and call it a place where a man can show off his potatoes. It made a sound that said we do not tear kindness into tickets, we keep it in bowls.\n\nVellum, who had expected barter and rage and a crowd of the unfairly sanctimonious, was disappointed by bowls. He put his pen down on the press and then picked it up again because he never put his pen down; it had grown into his hand in little roots and would have had to be dug out. He had thought to make them tidy, to make them say please in the right places and thank you where it would be counted and admitted into the ledger of what you can show to your sons. He had thought they would line up for sympathy the way they line up for meat. The paper breathed out on the press when he leaned over it as if it were a woman under a man that she had not chosen; it was an indrawn breath as thin as the edge of a knife. He smiled because he had made men behave well by compulsion and that is the oldest pleasure of a certain sort of mind, and then he frowned because fields with names were being written on his map by hands that did not ask permission. He did not ask the crow to go and tear them down because he did not like to ask, and in that small habit, which had begun as a point of pride and turned into a disability, there was a piece of his undoing.\n\nThe inspectors wore sashes, as Quill had predicted, which is the same as tying a ribbon around someone\u2019s hunger and expecting them to get full. They came to doors and asked people to show their books and their allotment of civility and any special permits for sympathy offered beyond the ordinary allotment, and they had lists in which generous women had been recorded with a tick in the margin that meant caution and perhaps a complaint later. Mr. Crisp\u2019s daughter, whose name was Eliza and whose father had persistently attempted to make it Lizzie because he thought that would make her kinder and had been surprised when it did not, came to the step with neither hat nor apology and asked which inspector wanted to come inside and untangle the string she kept for tying parcels. When no one volunteered, she put her hands behind her back and spoke as if she were a catechism and you had better get the answers right. \u201cNo,\u201d she said with proper elevation, \u201cyou may not count my decency. It does not fit in your boxes. Also, I will have back the paper you handed to the boy this morning that told him his kindness was to be administered by others, as I have told that boy since he was a wall-nibbler that he could choose when to say yes and no, and I will not have you take my teaching and make a ledger of it.\u201d\n\nShort John, who had been invited to memorise and had discovered memory was not improved by having your name shortened by a man with a pin, handed her his own book without meaning to. His hand had gone out because he remembered being offered sugar on a spoon and he had remembered that there are days when you want to feed someone even if it makes your mother cross. Eliza took it and tore the cover off very neatly and gave him the pages intact and he stood blinking at the niceness of the mercy as if it were rain that did not wet you, and then the torn cover lying in her palm showed its inside, full of the words of instructions men never read after the first pride, and Eliza looked at the tiny print and hated it with a cold precision that Elias would remember for a long time when he needed to aim at a hinge.\n\n\u201cI will take that,\u201d Elias said, because he did not want Eliza to poison herself on contempt and spend the morning vomiting where it would do no good. He tucked the cover into his pocket with the dot and the truth card and the ribbon and felt as if he were walking around with a woman\u2019s reticule in his trousers, which tickled him and kept him from making a speech. He did not make a speech because Quill had warned him that the enemy today lay with boredom. \u201cCollect your cups,\u201d he said instead, and the town did because a habit had begun in them and neither Vellum\u2019s cleverness nor anyone\u2019s weariness had had time to stop it. People brought out the chipped ones and the ridiculous ones, the cups with praise printed on them for jubilees not their own and the one without a handle that a grandfather would not part with because his hand had decided where to hold, and they set them on the table that Magdalene and Mr. Bobbin had brought out, which was the one that had never liked to live indoors and had longed for a market all its life and had been obliged to be respectable. On the table was laid a cloth that did not match anything and therefore matched the town.\n\nThey wrote, not in the blue books, but on paper that had wrapped a ham and on the back of a notice about Methodist teas and on one page of the Hampshire Chronicle that had got loose from binding because Magdalene had let it go. They wrote what they brought: I will come and sit at your window and say nothing on Wednesday. They wrote what they needed: my husband will not speak to me because the Queen died and he thinks being sad must be bigger than a kitchen and I would like someone to tell him the kitchen can hold the Queen if you open the doors. They wrote in ugly hands and in beautiful ones and in a child\u2019s block capitals, and Eliza wrote a note that said, as if daring someone to disagree, I am very bad at funerals; I can carry chairs. The list of verbs began to pick up in its fibers a new category of action that had not been set in type and probably never would be because the world would not consider it decent: the work of listening while someone fails to tell the truth and forgives himself.\n\nThat afternoon, when it would have been a pretty cruelty to do nothing and watch a town exhaust itself on its own virtue, Vellum sent the inspectors to the church. They came with a ledger that asked Elijah Grieves to account for how many bells had been rung for how many griefs and whether the bells had resounded equally for the rich and the eating of sausages yesterday, and Elijah took the book in both hands and regarded it as if it were a coal shovel asking to be consulted on weddings. He set it down. He wrote in a hand so slow and exact that any inspector would be obliged to watch until boredom did what truth could not, and he wrote: the bell rings the same for anyone who held a spoon. Then he added: the bell rings the same for anyone who did not, and he underlined did not because he understood that grief sometimes has nothing to do with having had a thing and much to do with having been promised and never given.\n\nQuill, who had no respect for ledgers and a professional interest in paper that presumed, leaped onto an inspector\u2019s lap and placed both paws squarely on the word appropriation before the man could read it, and stayed there until his full cat weight pressed it through the paper and into the man\u2019s trousers as a little shame. The inspector tried to move him and could not because there are laws in this world that only cats enforce, and finally he laughed helplessly and let the laughing go on two seconds longer than he should have because it was not the tone pamphlets require. When he stood up at last, the word had transferred to his shirt and he would have to go home before he could be seen enforcing anything else, and this, too, was a mercy the town pretended not to understand.\n\nFor his countercharm, Elias did not bring a broom because brooms would offend men who believed in ledgers; he brought a ledger bigger than theirs. He took the book Mrs. Bell kept under her bed and carried the kettle on top of it the way he had told her to, and he laid it on the commons table open at the page where the babies\u2019 names had been rearranged in Vellum\u2019s pretty formation and straightened again with twine. \u201cWrite your own kindnesses to yourselves,\u201d he said, and the town looked at him as if he had suggested that men put their hands in their own pockets and share out their money to the person who always forgot he deserved any. He nodded at Mr. Crisp\u2019s daughter because he was not above calling in a terror when he needed one, and Eliza wrote at the top of a clean page with the printshop\u2019s ugly pen in an ugly ink: I forgive myself for not liking funerals, as long as I carry chairs, and she signed it, and the ink looked better at once for having been given a bad job to do and doing it with an honest back.\n\nHe made a thing with string and spoons, because words are not everything and metal is next to truth if you ask the right question. He took spoons, which were the same spoons men have argued over for a thousand years, and he tied string to them, and he laid them in a bowl in the center of the table, and he told anyone who came to the commons that if they left without taking one, he would be cross. Hester took a spoon, because Hester would take anything that looked as if it might become a weapon later, and she put it in her pocket and made it ring when she walked. Mr. Bobbin tied his string around his wrist because he did not trust himself to keep hold of things that were not heavy. Mrs. Hardesty put hers under the counter because she had a way of reaching for sharp words and she wanted to grab metal first. The spoons knocked together when the wind came, and the sound they made was the kind of small music that rearranges a miser into a person who remembers that the spoon in his hand is meant for soup he intends to share.\n\nVellum tried boring them in the afternoon, because Quill had predicted boredom, and a man will always try the tactic you least fear when he thinks you\u2019ve become clever. He sent a procession. It was not the sort of procession that makes boys throw their caps and girls adjust their collars; it was the sort of procession that a man invents when he has never been celebrated and suspects that celebration is a punishment. They came with white bands around their arms and white cloths tied to sticks and white feathers on their hats that made their hats look ashamed, and they walked without a band and without a stride and without anything to carry properly and they asked that people admire the Quiet. They did not speak. They did not sing. They did not shuffle. They were the kind of silence that wave at windows and wait to be invited in to sit on chairs and tell women their grief is untidy.\n\nElias did not tell Hester she must not do what she was thinking. He let her run into the back of the procession with bells tied to her ankles, because Hester had learned from Elijah Grieves that bells belong to wrists and rope and people, not to schedules, and she made a noise like a baby storm and the white hats bobbed in agitation like mushrooms in uncertain weather. Mr. Bobbin, whose instrument does not take to being asked for high-mindedness, took out his fiddle and played badly on purpose because badness is sometimes a holy act, and the procession had to step in time to avoid looking ridiculous and then looked ridiculous anyway because a song had attached itself and they had not been made to hold one.\n\nWhen the white came to the church, the vicar stepped out and spoke to it like a man who had been interrupted while buttering bread. \u201cNo,\u201d he said, and he said it with an old west wind in his voice, the kind that knocks apples and leaves them fit for jelly and tells men not to argue about fruit. \u201cYou may come in when you have something to carry. We do not admire emptiness on purpose. We admire it by mistake, when we had meant to make soup and the cupboard argued.\u201d The Quiet did not know what to do with being told that it had nothing in its hands. It had been in rooms where being blank earns praise. It had been in rooms where men have made their faces into a refusal to cry and had been congratulated. It had not been in a place where being silent was not a virtue to be paraded but a space to be held while someone else finds her breath.\n\nBy late day, the coupons had lost their paper shine and had become merely paper. They were useful to light stoves and to write shopping lists and occasionally to stick under a table leg that wobbled because a man had wished to have his cupboard stand level and the floor refused. Elias took the book from his pocket and tore out the Special Allowance that said for grief, and he went to Mrs. Bell in between calls because he had the offense in his hands and could not carry it another hour, and he laid it on her table and put the kettle on top of it, and he did not speak because there are things you must not say in the presence of a woman whose day keeps people alive. He washed his hands without being asked and took the chair by the stove and scraped his nails carefully with the back of the knife because blood hides in them and you must show it a way out. Mrs. Bell saw him make a ritual and felt, in her elbows, a lessening of something no man had put there. She would not say thank you. She would say breathe to a girl with a long night ahead, and the thank you would be in not dying.\n\nThat night, for the first time since he had moved into the lower room, Vellum came up into the air. He did not mean to, which is how you know he was not yet lost to cunning altogether. He brought no paper. He brought the point of his nose and the fragile edge of his pride and stood at the corner where the field with the sign Parcel 7 looked at the hedge and pretended not to be jealous. He looked at the chalk written on his map through the window and at the chalk on the ground that boys had made into boxes with words in them because the big words kept their feet under them when they jumped. He wondered whether he had written the word necessary too many times today and if he had, whether that made it less so. He had known hunger was a bowl you do not talk about; he had not known kindness was a bowl you must talk into or it goes hard on the edges and does not pour.\n\nElias met him there not because he had guessed at Vellum\u2019s steps but because his own had brought him round the circuit of his day and landed at that corner the way a penny stops because a nail is under the tablecloth. He stood a little way off and did not say \u201cyou have come out,\u201d because men who have been under so long think you are mocking them. He stood with his hands in his pockets and thought of his mother\u2019s ribbon and of Short John\u2019s hands and of the vicar\u2019s head when it had been bowed for an instant today at the word river and then lifted because it had been asked to say Anton. When he spoke, he did not say a clever line, because cleverness serves only the first nice minute and then grows hungry.\n\n\u201cYou cannot make a scarcity of what breath does,\u201d he said. He said it to the hedge, because hedges understand things better than men when men are being watched. \u201cYou can make counting of the parts of it. You can put values on the edges so that someone with cold fingers can be persuaded it is warmer to have a list than a woman's hand. You can convince a boy that it is better to be thanked by a ribbon than by the look on his father\u2019s face when the wood is in. But it is breath. It will go into whatever room will let it, and if you shut the doors, it will push under, and if you seal that, it will go out the chimney and come down next door and the next town will name its fields and sing badly and keep its grief in bowls.\u201d\n\nVellum did not speak for a time, which is a form of respect in men who suspect they may not be loved and do not wish to do anything worse than they must. When he did, he kept his voice thin, perhaps because he did not know how to make it broad without sounding like someone he had hated. \u201cMy father gave my mother coupons for laughter,\u201d he said, not looking at Elias and not looking away, because his eyes had been taught to behave at their work. \u201cHe gave her three a week and one extra at Easter and told her not to overspend because laughing made the neighbors think we were like them and he did not want to be like them. On Mondays she laughed when she burned the bread and got scolded for it because the coupon did not cover laughter at mistakes. On Saturdays she would stand by the window and look at the back yard and use them all in a swallow. I thought that was economy and grace. I thought that was how you kept a house from spilling. You will not persuade me with bowls.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do not want to persuade you,\u201d Elias said, because he had learned, slowly, that doing so can make a man hate truth for being clever. \u201cI want to keep the town from being punished because your father ran his house like a counting book. You will go on being the sort of man whose hand writes smaller when he is ashamed. You will call it neatness and sometimes you will be right. You will look at the way people put cups down and think of putting them down in rows. No one will stop you thinking that. When you put the rows in other people\u2019s houses you will be in my way. I will not let you. You may come and stand at the edge and watch a bowl and call it foolish and go away and not die of it. Or you may come with a cup, which would make both of us very tired. Either way, you will not count women\u2019s laughter. It will go strange if you do.\u201d\n\nVellum turned his head then, not toward Elias exactly, but toward the sound of a woman on the green laughing in a way she had been rationing her whole life, that donkey-bray surprised into grace which you hear on spring days and at funerals out of season. He watched the sound, which is a thing that can be done if you are patient, and for a second some piece of him that had been seven and had wanted to point thought very hard about climbing out of his shirt. He put his hand on his cuff, which he had whitened this morning so that no discussion of his person would take place without his consent, and he said, as if tasting does not count as appetite, \u201cYou will not think me a monster if I tell you I have written to men who will buy your fields with the numbers I have given them.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will think you a clerk who has put his pen into another man\u2019s land and expected the soil to take ink,\u201d Elias said. He did not smile because there is no kindness in smiling at a man to whom you must say something honest. \u201cThey will come. They will carry rulers. They will stand in Daniel\u2019s Oat and in Margaret\u2019s Drop and ask where the lines are and expect to be told. And we will take them to the green and ask them to wait while we sing ill and ring bells wrong and feed them soup that is very good and speak the names of our dead in such a way that when they leave their rulers will have learned something unforgivable, which is that there are measures you cannot take and remain tidy. They will suspect we are untoward and be correct.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt will not last,\u201d Vellum said, and his voice did not have triumph in it nor despair. It had the damp of below-rooms and a boy\u2019s obedience. \u201cYou cannot win with bowls. A bowl breaks.\u201d\n\n\u201cA bowl mends,\u201d Elias answered, and the word, tiny and serviceable, went between them like an old coin that has passed so many hands it has become a prayer. \u201cAnd even when it shatters, the floor keeps some of what was in it. You have been trying to win with pins. A pin rusts. I am not winning either, not in any way you would count. I am living long enough to know where the tea is kept. That, it turns out, is a form of victory if you have to choose one.\u201d He inclined his head to Vellum, not as to a man he liked, which he did not, and not as to a man he pitied, which he was trying not to make into a habit, but as to a man he intended to continue to know until one of them died.\n\nWhen he walked away, Quill slipped down from the hedge where he had been rude in every way a cat can be in the presence of a man who tries to regulate laughter. He wound himself between Elias\u2019s ankles with exaggerated forgiveness, because he had climbed a field and dirtied his white feet and wished not to be told he was glorious. \u201cHe wants to be told someone will count him,\u201d the cat said, which is as near to kindness as Quill gets with enemies who don\u2019t have scales. \u201cHe thinks fair is numbers and not chairs carried and kettles offered and boys not told to hush. You will not persuade him, but you will make him late for his next cruelty and that matters as much as anything in a town.\u201d\n\nIt was late when the new ledger went up, which is to say the old wall of the old posting house that no one had posted in for years because one man had been shot for the wrong thing there once upon a time and the wall had taken a dislike to messages. Tired hands with good chalk wrote on it not news and not orders and not anything that would earn anyone praise; they wrote kindnesses that had happened and the spoons that had been returned and the cups that had gone missing and had been found under beds and the chairs that had been carried and the chairs that would need carrying on Thursday because Mrs. Plumbly was coming to lay out her dead. They wrote in their own hands the line that Magdalene had learned to set and refused today and would not refuse tomorrow: already paid. Then under it, because men will be men and towns will be towns and there are rules that must be spoken and laughed at, they wrote: if you have not paid, do not fret; bring a pie.\n\nAt Elias\u2019s table, the dot sat content as a seed in a dish and the truth card lay face down under it because truth lies better if you give it a small weight. He wrote on his list behind the broom mend and rest and then wrote borrow and lend and then wrote sing even if and then, because the day had asked more of him than a heroism and he had given it, he wrote sardines because Quill had been patient beyond reason. Quill leaped onto the chair with the look of a cat who has been promised something and intends to collect with a complaint, and he purred while he ate and made the tiny noise that sounds like tea water beginning to forgive a kettle. Andover breathed the way a house does when the baby has been put down and the father is keeping his chair quiet by force of will and the mother has taken off her shoes and will be found sleeping with one in her hand, and somewhere a man below a school put his pen down for a minute and looked at his empty hand as if it might have the right to be bare and did not know what to do with it and did nothing, which is a beginning if you have someone to make soup for you later.",

                              "content": "On the morning the butcher\u2019s window went blind, Elias Fiske was crouched beneath the blackthorn hedge behind Mrs. Coppin\u2019s cottage, coaxing a teaspoon of warm honey and thyme between the paws of a hare that had mistaken iron for clover. Andover had not yet properly shaken the chill from its bones; a gray fleece lay over the town, and the Anton stream moved low and glass-green along its cut chalk banks. The hedges smelled of dew and cold mud. Elias talked as he worked, not to the hare but to the cat standing on his shoulder as if it were a prow.\n\n\u201cHold steady, Quill,\u201d he said. \u201cOne more drop and the tongue will remember it belongs inside the mouth.\u201d\n\nQuill\u2019s tail whisked him on the nose. \u201cIt isn\u2019t the hare, old man,\u201d the cat said, voice a frostbitten whisper so it wouldn\u2019t spook the small patient. \u201cIt\u2019s you who forgets. Humans, I\u2019ve noticed, a great fondness for letting bits go wandering. Keys. Tempers. Whole lives.\u201d\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t mislaid my life,\u201d Elias said mildly. He set down the spoon, pried the bit of iron free\u2014some child\u2019s nail, rusted thin\u2014and murmured a comfort to seal the blood. The hare\u2019s eyes settled, its breath gentled. Elias stroked its ears until it trembled only a little and then sprang, anxious, slick-bellied, into the hedge. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not iron that calls me,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s work.\u201d\n\nQuill transferred from shoulder to satchel with a spring and a flap. He was lean as a one-word answer and striped like a half-remembered song. \u201cIt will be a day for it,\u201d the cat said, staring down the lane as if he could see what the thickening morning mist was trying to hide. \u201cPeople are telling stories. I\u2019ve counted three already getting born in the last ten minutes. Two without fathers.\u201d\n\n\u201cStories breed,\u201d Elias said, wiping his hands on his coat. The coat had seen better days. It had seen days it would never speak of to anyone. He straightened and squinted toward High Street. \u201cLet\u2019s see who needs a broom.\u201d\n\nThe butcher\u2019s window, when they reached it, looked as if it had been shut in on a thundercloud. Fat words and bruised smears had unrolled from the top sash and pooled against the slate. The usual neat row of fleck-white rabbits, pink trotters, parcels tied with string and bald knuckles of beef had disappeared behind a blackened gloss. When Elias put his face to the glass to peer through, the words smeared there clung to his breath and shivered like fish under ice.\n\n\u201cDo you mind,\u201d Mrs. Hardesty snapped, appearing at his elbow with a wiping cloth as if she meant to scour his cheek. \u201cI\u2019ve enough trouble with this muck without your steaming it. And don\u2019t you come near my sausages.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t planning to,\u201d Elias said. He stood back and bowed a little\u2014old habit; he\u2019d grown up with the Hardestys\u2019 shouts in his ear and their butcher\u2019s paper under his nose. \u201cMay I look?\u201d\n\nMrs. Hardesty sniffed. Her cap was crooked and the color in her cheeks had been painted there by fury. \u201cYou\u2019ll do more than look or I\u2019ll have you\u2014what do wizards get? Fined? Hanged?\u201d\n\n\u201cTea,\u201d Elias said thoughtfully. \u201cOr a biscuit, if the work\u2019s hard.\u201d He put his hand flat upon the glass. The words under his palm quivered. They had weight and grain to them, the oily insistence of ink left long enough to dry into the skin. He could make out letters now that the light was coming up: liar, fiend, children, from the blood. Andover made a low sound in his ear then, old brick and chalk and pig-iron, the faint groan of rope over a pulley. His town had a voice if you listened and didn\u2019t tell anyone you could. It sounded weary and short-tempered before breakfast. A man clearing his throat and not much more.\n\nQuill leaped neatly onto the window frame and put one paw into the ink. He drew it out again quickly, shaking off glossy drops. \u201cPfft,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s not from ink. Or it is, but not the sort from your little bottles. That\u2019s printed malice. Binding. You smell it?\u201d\n\nElias did. Under the butcher\u2019s familiar tang\u2014the iron of blood, the sweet rot of fat and aging sawdust\u2014there was the sharp naphthalene-apple stink of new pamphlets. He took his hand from the window and the letters slopped against the place his palm had been, trying not to let go, but his touch had been light and he knew how to slip politely from a trouble. He turned to Mrs. Hardesty. \u201cWho did you call first? The church? Constable?\u201d\n\n\u201cI called nobody,\u201d she said, and then flicked a glance to the line of waiting people behind him. The line, which had been very still and unwilling to meet Elias\u2019s eye, shifted. \u201cWell. I sent my Willy for the vicar. Willy hasn\u2019t been back. It\u2019s your mess. You did it. It says so right there.\u201d She jabbed her cloth at the words.\n\n\u201cDoes it,\u201d Elias murmured. He put his head close to the glass again until his own face appeared behind the ink as a gray ghost. He saw the letters more clearly now. Their edges were not ragged like spilled ink should be; they were crisp, set like type. The words slid when he looked, trying to be something else: slaughterer, corruptor, worm in the belly of the town. He had the sensation of the window speaking to him but not with its own tongue. A man\u2019s voice, soft and amused, licking at the syllables as they turned round.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen this work,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce. Far east of here. In a little place whose name I don\u2019t intend to remember.\u201d He glanced at Quill. \u201cAre there any prints?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhich sort?\u201d Quill\u2019s ears were flat. \u201cFoot or thumb?\u201d\n\n\u201cFeather,\u201d Elias said. He shook his head as if to clear it of the voice, though it had already gone, sliding away into the wet like a rat. \u201cLook for a crow\u2019s-foot. Corner, if it\u2019s properly done.\u201d\n\nThe cat slunk along the sill, careful not to let any more of the black touch him, and peered at the meeting of glass and wood. He sniffed, sneezed, lifted a whisker the way he lifted a sword when a mouse needed its pride pricked. \u201cThere,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the left lower corner. Three scratches and a dot. Like someone signed with a bird.\u201d\n\nElias felt the town shiver under his boots, a thud down the length of the street as if the bell had rung but only inside people\u2019s bones. He curled his fingers and wanted a mug in them, wanted heat. \u201cWe\u2019ll pull this down,\u201d he said, raising his voice so the line could hear and not hear. \u201cIt won\u2019t break the glass. No one will smash anything. This is only ink trying to be a story.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is a story,\u201d muttered a man behind him. He had the look of a man who had been told something shocking in the dark and had had to walk home with his hands in his pockets and the shocking thing like a lantern in his mouth. \u201cSaid you did a thing with old Mr. Crisp\u2019s daughter. Said you\u2014\u201d His voice ran out and his face went pink. \u201cSorry, Elias. I shouldn\u2019t. It\u2019s\u2026 it says it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not true,\u201d Elias said. He didn\u2019t say it sharply. You couldn\u2019t beat a story by shouting at it. He breathed out, and his breath made the black crawl again, and he spoke a word you would not find in a book because it wasn\u2019t written anywhere. It belonged to Andover and to the chalk under Andover and to the old law of a place that would not be humiliated by paper. It was a word that woke a broommaid in a cottage kitchen at the edge of town, ten miles from there, and made her think suddenly to scrub the hearth. It made a boy remember he had forgotten to shut the gate on the sheep. It made the dog turn thrice and lie down on the right side of the rug. It was a word of tidying up.\n\nThe ink flinched.\n\n\u201cAgain,\u201d Quill murmured.\n\nElias said the word again, softer. He felt it go out, like a rill of water down a slight slope, into the gutters and the wells. The ink drew back from his hand as if it didn\u2019t want to be touched by something so dull and domestic. \u201cSweep,\u201d he said, and \u201cset to rights,\u201d and \u201cenough,\u201d and the butcher\u2019s wife shuddered, and the boy at the end of the line started to cry without knowing why, and the window cleared as if someone were rolling up a blind. Ink gathered itself reluctantly into the corners and became a clotted spider, which skittered off into the morning.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about that,\u201d Elias told Mrs. Hardesty as she flinched. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t bite anything with a backbone.\u201d He was lying but he expected the spider would like best to disappear in a drain and mope.\n\nThe line exhaled. People came briskly to life with the shock of relief that was almost anger. \u201cIf there\u2019s any of it on my sausages\u2014\u201d Mrs. Hardesty began, but the words died away; she was looking at Elias as if she had never seen him before. \u201cWho would do such a thing?\u201d she said softly. \u201cTo my window? To our town?\u201d\n\n\u201cSomeone poor in stories,\u201d Quill answered. He was twisting his paw delicately, wiping it on the lapel of Elias\u2019s coat with exact malice. \u201cSomeone who only has the kind that rot from the inside.\u201d\n\nElias rubbed the back of his neck where the hairs had stiffened. The word he had said was still going about its business. You didn\u2019t want to overdo a thing like that or the town would be too tidy to bear. He looked up and down High Street. Every doorway had collected a listener. Faces like clocks with two fingers pointing different ways. He felt the weight of his own name on these people\u2019s tongues and it made a private ache down the center of his sternum, as if someone had pressed a thumb there and had not taken it away.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a mark,\u201d he said carefully. \u201cA dare. If you see anything like that\u2014\u201d He flicked a look. The three scratches and a dot were gone. He had expected that. \u201c\u2014you\u2019ll tell me. Don\u2019t read it. Or if you must read it, don\u2019t believe it. It\u2019s like walking over river ice: you can, but you\u2019ll come home wet and cold and it was only foolishness.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho?\u201d someone asked. \u201cWho is it?\u201d And the repetition came like sparrows from the eaves: who, who, who. Andover was not a small town but it could make itself small when it felt afraid.\n\nElias did not say a name, not because he did not have one in his mouth but because some names liked the air too much. He nodded to Mrs. Hardesty, and she nodded back, and the world made a tiny clack as a cog took a tooth. Work to do. Sausages to sell. People began to talk at once, and Quill leaped down and trotted before Elias like a banner.\n\nThey turned the corner into Scanner\u2019s Yard and found a pamphlet tied to Elias\u2019s blue door with string.\n\nIt looked as if the hedgerows had shed a skin in the night and someone had gathered it and made something flat of it and beaten it with the truth until it forgot the wild. It had sprigs along the margin like the small weeds that grow in paper, not because someone drew them but because the plant had not been entirely convinced it was dead. The title was in thick black, and it smiled at him with every tooth.\n\nThe Sorcerer of Andover Eats Children.\n\n\u201cDoes he,\u201d said Elias. His voice did not shake. He untied the string and held the pamphlet like a fish that he intended to return to the water unhurt. He opened it. The smell of it came off the pages in a sick-sweet breath.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Quill said sharply. \u201cThere\u2019s a burr inside. It\u2019s set to catch.\u201d\n\n\u201cI see it,\u201d Elias murmured. \u201cHold your tongue. If I miss it, tell me which way I bled.\u201d He thewed through the first paragraph with the kind of attention he would give to a ditch in darkness. The sentences were almost right. Almost true. He had\u2014for instance\u2014lived here since he was six, and yes, Mrs. Coppin had given him bread on Thursdays, and yes, he had once chased a badger out of a cellar with a broom. But the badger had not spoken to him with Mr. Crisp\u2019s daughter\u2019s voice and he had not\u2014and here the words turned like a worm in a hand\u2014worn a mask made from the skin of a child. The pamphlet was a map of a place that was Andover and not, with streets that led where they should but came out into rooms that smelled of pigs when they should have smelled of clean bed linen. It was the kind of story that crawled you and left little grit trails behind your eyes.\n\n\u201cEnough,\u201d Quill said. \u201cHe\u2019s signed it in the colophon. Look.\u201d\n\nElias turned to the last page. The mark was there in the tiny print, three scratches and a dot, and also the name. It wasn\u2019t a true name. Wizards had those, some of them kept in folded paper under the mattress of someone they trusted. It was a name chosen and worn in daylight. Vellum Crowe.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d Elias said. His coffee he\u2019d meant to go home and make had gone suddenly very necessary and very far away. He looked up and saw across the Yard the face of Hester Stowe in her window, chin tucked in the heel of her hand, watching. Hester had been eight the last time the river overran the bank and had followed Elias stoutly in bare feet while he spoke to the Anton and told it it was not time yet. He smiled at her in the ordinary way and she gave him an ordinary smile back. The ordinary had become very dear in an instant.\n\n\u201cWhat do you do?\u201d Quill asked. He was too quiet. He was never quiet when he was frightened. It was his vanity; he believed fear made him stupid and he hated that.\n\n\u201cTea,\u201d Elias said automatically. \u201cBiscuits. We promised Mrs. Coppin to look at her chimney after dinner.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat order makes no sense,\u201d Quill said, relieved to be cross. \u201cMilk first.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt does,\u201d Elias said. \u201cIt does enough. Do you know why he sent this to my door?\u201d He took in a breath of the smell of the pamphlet and let it go. He could see the burr quivering in it, set like a nettle almost under the skin of the words. He folded it carefully and set it on the sill. It would not go off yet. \u201cHe wants me to come to him. He\u2019ll lay down a trail of hurt and filth until I do. He likes the walk better than the meeting.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen don\u2019t go,\u201d Quill said at once. \u201cSit. Roll yourself up in a blanket. Let me bite anyone who knocks.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not made for the hearth,\u201d Elias said, but not unkindly. He pushed open the door and they went in. The house smelled of sage and floor wax. There were small bags hung on the pegs by the door\u2014sprigs of lavender, a twist of iron filings, a length of plaited hair he didn\u2019t remember making but he knew he had. He set water to boil and put bread on a plate and two lumps of sugar because sometimes, after a blow, there was nothing else to be done that would not make it worse. He held his hands to the kettle and watched the steam rise up in muslin threads. He said, to the steam, \u201cHe was waiting, this one. Somewhere damp. Somewhere people don\u2019t go because they get lonely if they do.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnder the viaduct,\u201d Quill suggested.\n\n\u201cNot\u2026 west of us. Not the water meadows. He smells of ink gone moldy. That\u2019s a room whose window never opens. Basement. Or a house shuttered long.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know him?\u201d\n\n\u201cI know his kind.\u201d Elias poured the water over the tea. The smell rose up, golden and brown. He had known many kinds. There were wizards who moved stones with their voices and wizards who took happiness like the top of a soft-boiled egg. Some of them you could talk with. Some you could outlast. There were the wicked and the sad and very many who were both. A man who made up nasty stories about his enemies because he liked to see how the town would turn\u2014he was not the worst. But he was not small either. Nasty stories ate. \u201cHe\u2019ll come for more than my window,\u201d Elias said.\n\n\u201cHe came for your name,\u201d Quill said, and then he started, because something hit the door. Not the door exactly. The air by the door. A soft slapping, like wetted paper thrown at varnish.\n\nElias set down his tea. He did not sigh. He took up his penknife, which had never been nervous about being only a penknife, and went to open the door.\n\nA patch of blackness the size of a dinner plate lurched off the jamb and fluttered at him, all corners. It was not a bird but it wanted to be. It wanted very badly to be. It came at his eyes. He stepped neatly to the side. Quill, who had no intention of letting a piece of ink peck his master to blindness, did something he was not proud of later: he jumped into the air shoulder first and caught the thing. It squealed. The squeal was human, high and pleased in its own pain, and it made Elias\u2019s stomach turn over. He flicked the knife and the thing tore open and fell to the step and lay there shuddering like a heart. It was letters. It was made of words.\n\n\u201cBother,\u201d Elias said, because the little boy across the Yard had appeared in his doorway with his mother\u2019s apron tied round his middle, and Elias had borrowed Bother from that house for so long it had become his. \u201cHe\u2019ll send more of those if we let him think it works.\u201d\n\nQuill spit a letter out of his mouth. It wriggled and went flat and climbed the doorjamb like a bug. \u201cLet him,\u201d the cat said darkly, and then coughed. \u201cApologies. It had an e lodged at the back of my throat. Stupid letter.\u201d\n\n\u201cTake the other door,\u201d Elias said to the letters on the step because it amused him to act as if he wasn\u2019t bothered. He went back inside, shut the door gently and leaned against it. His hands were steady. There were a thousand things to do and every one of them small. He could not go to the basement where Vellum Crowe waited\u2014if it was a basement\u2014with his coat smelling of Hardesty\u2019s shop and his tea growing cold. The answer to a sorcery like this was never a loud one. It was a washing line and a point at its center with a peg.\n\n\u201cWho told you?\u201d Quill asked a minute later when they had their tea and their bread and they sat on the back step looking over the small garden. \u201cThat you\u2019d be the kind of person who cleaned this sort of mess.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou did,\u201d Elias said. \u201cWhen you followed me home from the mill and refused to come in because the doormat said Wipe Your Feet as if it had been drawn by a bully.\u201d\n\nQuill sniffed. \u201cI was a kitten. I thought all rugs were orders.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou do still,\u201d Elias said, and that made Quill smile, which he did with his whiskers. \u201cAlso, my mother. Not with words. She scrubbed the lie out of everything with her day. She applied water and a certain song to it. My father\u2014\u201d He stopped. His father had been less of a shape. A pair of boots by the door. A laugh that could be felt through the floorboards if it was a good laugh, if it was in season.\n\n\u201cEat,\u201d Quill commanded, and Elias did. They finished tea and washed the cups. By then the Yard had emptied into the day, and the sun slid its greasy hair out of its cap and the mist began to burn away. People came by in twos and threes to ask if Elias needed anything and to not look at the pamphlet on the sill. He told them no and thank you and\u2014always\u2014the same thing: if words appear where they should not, call me, do not read them, it will make you ill.\n\nMidday brought Hester Stowe to his door with a handkerchief tied to a stick. \u201cI\u2019m going to beat my brother with it,\u201d she announced, pushing past him into the kitchen. \u201cHe said you ate a child because you were hungry. I told him you eat scones and he said you put glue in the jam so you could catch a fly in it. He said you stole Mr. Crisp\u2019s\u2014\u201d She stopped, seeing the pamphlet, and her mouth went O.\n\nElias took the handkerchief from her gently and untied the knot. Inside was a frog and two copper coins. \u201cI don\u2019t accept frogs as payment,\u201d he said solemnly. \u201cThey hop out of my pocket.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d Hester said, and blinked hard. Her eyes had begun to fill because she had read the word eats and the word children and there was the burr under the skin of the sentence and her body had felt it, not her mind. \u201cElias,\u201d she whispered, and the whisper had in it exactly enough trust to tear a man in two.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m all right,\u201d he said, crouching to be at her height. He always forgot how little most people were, and how tall he had become without meaning to. \u201cIs your brother all right?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s stupid. He has scabs all over his knees and none in his head.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d Elias said. \u201cScabs on knees mean there\u2019s still some honesty in him.\u201d He looked at Quill. \u201cWould you like to show Hester something?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Quill said at once. He did not care for performing. But Hester\u2019s tear had fallen and stuck at the corner of her mouth like a bead and Quill could not bear beads on children, and so he sat up very straight and looked at the frog. \u201cI will require the frog,\u201d he said.\n\nHester presented it. Quill observed it gravely. \u201cMiss Frog,\u201d he said, \u201cyou are safe. And unspectacular. Leap once if this is true, twice if it is not.\u201d The frog leaped once. Quill nodded. \u201cNow. Hester. Leap once if what your brother said is confusing your guts. Twice if it is not.\u201d\n\nHester leaped once without smiling. Then she realized what she\u2019d done and tried very hard not to make a face. Quill flicked an ear. \u201cNow listen to this: Elias and I will not eat you. Not past, not present, not future. Not in books, not in alleys, not in soups. Is any of that false?\u201d\n\nHester held her breath and sipped at the words as if they might be hot. \u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen tell your stupid brother we\u2019ll eat him instead,\u201d Quill said sweetly, and Elias sighed and Hester laughed and the burr he had seen under the pamphlet\u2019s skin came unseated, just a little, and scrabbled and fell away.\n\nWhen Hester had gone, Elias made himself read the pamphlet through to the end. It took an hour. It left a taste like pennies in his mouth for the rest of the day. He followed the stitch-work of the lies and saw the hands that had made them. Not many hands. One careful pair. They had chosen words as if choosing herbs for a medicine that would make the town\u2019s blood thin. They had saved a particular spice for last: at the bottom of the last page, in tiny, fine type that required the angle of a midwife\u2019s gaze to see, was a line that even Quill had missed: It is not safe to look him in the eyes.\n\n\u201cYou clever coward,\u201d Elias said aloud. \u201cYou will want them to look down when they see me.\u201d He put the pamphlet in a drawer, knowing it would shimmy out and follow him when it liked because this was not over. He washed his hands. He finished his work\u2014Mrs. Coppin\u2019s chimney had a bat in it; he told it kindly to move to the eaves; it did\u2014and he let the day go on being a day while somewhere, he knew, Vellum Crowe was making another day into something not entirely itself.\n\nHe dreamt of crows that night. Of course he did. He lay under a sky the exact slate color of the butcher\u2019s window at its worst and watched a flock of black paper tearing itself into pieces and reassembling as a different bird every time. One was a swallow with a stick for a belly. One was a gull with a nail through its head, which bothered it not at all. When he woke, Quill was asleep with his face in Elias\u2019s ear as if he could pour dreams out like water and drink them. Elias lay there quietly because the house was listening, and then set his feet to the floor like a man stepping into a cold stream.\n\nThe morning, which had thought it was going to be ordinary, changed its mind when the second pamphlet arrived and went directly for Mrs. Troon\u2019s baby. Mrs. Troon had been carrying the baby down the slope to the water when a wind rose and flapped at the paper in her apron pocket. She had taken it out and read two lines before she remembered Elias had told her not to. Later she would not be able to recall setting the baby down. She would say she dropped her shawl and the shawl cried, and when she looked up the child sat by the edge of the river with a woman\u2019s face on, a sour-faced woman with a mouth like a knife mark, who was telling the child in a voice thinner than tin that a narrow thing was the same as a safe thing. The child began to scoot without quite crawling toward the water.\n\nHester Stowe, truant and proud of it, was the one who screamed.\n\nBy the time Elias reached the bank, breath ragged, the child had one foot wet, one foot dry, and was peering at his own reflection as if he had a secret. The river was gray and earnest. The pamphlet lay on the grass with its throat open, letting out a smell like pith. Elias scooped the child up and the reflection shrugged and took one of those steps you sometimes see on a ladder when you climb above the roofline and don\u2019t expect it. Elias held the child tight and spoke to the river without raising his voice. He called it by its little name, which the Anton wore only when it turned under Andover Bridge and looked up at the sky for a moment as if it was going to decide whether to go on. \u201cYou\u2019ve misread your orders,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fetch is not for today.\u201d\n\nThe river settled like a big animal deciding not to ask for dinner just yet. The child hiccuped and put his wet foot on Elias\u2019s knee. The sour-faced woman stepped, briefly, onto a stone and then became the stone and then did not exist as a separate thing anymore.\n\n\u201cNow,\u201d Elias said to Mrs. Troon, very gentle because her face had shattered and was in several places at once. \u201cGo home. Remember that the baby was born on a Tuesday. Tuesdays have cleverness. You will need to keep an eye on that.\u201d Mrs. Troon nodded and bobbled the child and went away holding him as if he would otherwise join the boys on the bridge and smoke.\n\nHester went to pick up the pamphlet. Elias stopped her with a glance and a word. She froze. Quill, who had arrived late and furious and still beautiful, paced round the paper with his back arched, making a sound like a kettle at the boil.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t dramatize,\u201d Elias said absentmindedly. He put his penknife into his teeth and unfurled the pamphlet carefully with his fingertips so that not a whisper brushed him. The title was worse, if you could call that possible. The Sorcerer of Andover Whispers In Rivers, Do Not Let Your Children Sleep. \u201cOriginal,\u201d Elias muttered. He pulled a thread from his cuff, a long one; he had been saving it without noticing, and laid it along the seam. The thread was home and will and bread and crumbs and crumbs again. It lay down and went to sleep. The pamphlet did not like that. It twitched and tried to be interesting. The thread was not; it continued to be home. The pamphlet gave up its right to be the most interesting thing on the grass and sighed and lay still.\n\n\u201cGet a box,\u201d Elias said. \u201cSomething with corners. Mrs. Coppin\u2019s old biscuit tin. The one with the lid that sticks.\u201d\n\nThey put the pamphlet in the tin and the tin on the shelf and the shelf under a chair and the chair in front of the door. It was not proper wizard work. It was a grandmother\u2019s work. It turned out to be the right kind.\n\nThe town wrinkled itself all afternoon like a face misfitted. It could not settle. People stopped in the street to shake their heads as if to fling water from their ears. Mr. Crisp\u2019s daughter\u2014who was not the least bit inclined to speak with anyone about anything that was not a real thing in front of her face\u2014crossed to Elias where he was standing by the green and stuck out her hand as if she were shaking his name. \u201cThey can\u2019t take what they haven\u2019t got,\u201d she said. \u201cHere.\u201d She pressed something into his palm. It was a small painted wooden soldier with the paint rubbed off its nose. It had been sad for so long it had become happy again by accident.\n\n\u201cI can use that,\u201d Elias said seriously. He watched her shoulder as she went away and thought about how people made themselves. You learned to wipe your own feet.\n\nBy dusk, the third attack came, and it came not as paper but as people. Four of them, men he knew well enough to borrow a spade from. Their faces had been scuffed. The pamphlets had taken two fingers and a corner off their names and the men hadn\u2019t noticed. They came with their hats off, which was politeness, and with sticks, which was not.\n\n\u201cElias,\u201d the first man said. His name was Tom but the pamphlet had made it Ton and he had not felt the subtraction. \u201cWe\u2019ve been asked to speak to you on the town\u2019s behalf.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho asked you?\u201d Elias said. He stood in his doorway with Quill winding round his ankles like rope.\n\nThe men frowned faintly, as if the question were rude. Tom\u2014Ton\u2014worried his stick. \u201cThe truth,\u201d he said. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t look us in the eyes.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have to,\u201d Elias said. He looked at their hands instead. One of them had a blister where a pen had been held too tight. One had coal dust at the nail. One had a ring that fit too loose. He wanted very badly to send them home to their wives. He did not want to humiliate them. He said, \u201cYou\u2019ve been fed something that doesn\u2019t agree with you. I have a medicine for that. It tastes like tea.\u201d\n\nThe men listened to the word tea with visible relief. It had the right number of vowels. Ton took a breath and then looked furious at himself, as if he had done some small thing extremely well in front of the wrong person. \u201cWe\u2019re not fools,\u201d he said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t read that\u2014\u201d He stopped because he had, he had read it twice, once for himself and once for a version of himself with his thumb in his mouth.\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d Elias said. He opened the door wider. \u201cCome in. You can lean the sticks by the stove. It doesn\u2019t mind sticks.\u201d He let them pass because he was Andover and they were Andover and there was a sort of magic in that which had nothing of wands and light in it. He gave them tea. He told them the story of a fish that had swallowed a ring and then spat it up in a puddle and how the ring had rolled to the door of a woman who had been looking for a sign. He told it badly. They listened and sipped and some of the nasty story in them sloughed away because ordinary stories had teeth too.\n\n\u201cWhat are we going to do,\u201d Ton said at last, eyes on his cup. \u201cIf there are papers in the street saying we are the sort who cannot tell?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will be the sort who can,\u201d Elias said. \u201cAnd we will be the sort who keep going to the shop for bread with our heads up. There will be more of it before there is less. Bring me anything a crow has scratched.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you,\u201d Ton said, eyes lifting just enough. \u201cWhat will you do?\u201d\n\n\u201cI will make up a story of my own,\u201d Elias said. \u201cIt will be slow, because it will be true. But it will go through your house and not break a cup. It will remind you where you put your boots. It will sit at the foot of your bed in the night and when you wake, it will be gone and you will keep the shape of it.\u201d He smiled. \u201cAlso, I will find him. Ink doesn\u2019t keep a man.\u201d He held up the painted soldier. \u201cHe\u2019s north of here.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy,\u201d Quill muttered, \u201cdo you always say north as if it\u2019s an ache in your left shoulder.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause that\u2019s where the ache is,\u201d Elias said.\n\nThe men went home politely and did not leave their sticks. They had forgotten them. Elias set the sticks against the wall where they wouldn\u2019t trip anyone and closed the door and leaned his head against it. He did not open the drawer where the pamphlet lay. He did not throw up. He was not a hero when he was most useful; he was only himself and there were days when that had to be enough.\n\n\u201cHe wants you outside the town,\u201d Quill said. \u201cHe wants you somewhere he can say is not you, not yours.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe wants me in a room with no window and a floor you can wash until the boards wear through,\u201d Elias said. His voice did an odd thing then. It sounded like his father\u2019s when his father remembered a song halfway through the second verse and the song forgot him back. \u201cI will go where he wants,\u201d he added softly. \u201cBut not like that. And not yet.\u201d\n\nHe did not sleep much that night. Andover did, though; it lay down and wore its winter face and snored. The town dreamed of a harvest that had already been brought in and a storm that would not break the thatch. It dreamed no dreams with letters in.\n\nThe morning made a joke of being fine. A sky as clear as water held up the houses. Elias set his hand on the bricks of his doorway and felt the place purr. He took a small bag, the painted soldier, three lengths of string, his penknife and a biscuit he had not earned. Quill jumped into the bag and then out again and decided to go without the indignity.\n\n\u201cWhere,\u201d Quill said. \u201cSay you. Say it with your mouth.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will start at the bookbinder\u2019s,\u201d Elias said. \u201cMagdalene Plum saw a mark like that once. She won\u2019t tell me she did. She will tell me she did not not. Then we will go north. Not far. Not fast. We will step from harmless to less harmless to unkind to cruel. We will keep stepping. We will set ourselves on the ground like a fact.\u201d\n\n\u201cLike a pebble you can\u2019t get out of your shoe,\u201d Quill said approvingly. He waved his tail at the door as if it were an audience. \u201cBack soon,\u201d he told the lintel. \u201cOr not.\u201d\n\nMagdalene Plum\u2019s shop was not a shop so much as a long sigh with shelves in it. Paper lived here. It did not have to strain to keep still; Magdalene had a way of telling it to behave just with her throat. She looked up when Elias came in. She had the kind of face that had never been ungenerous and never would be. \u201cI will not mend a slander,\u201d she said without greeting.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not asking you to,\u201d Elias said. He put down the painted soldier and then took it up again because it had become dearer to him every time it crossed air. \u201cI need the smell.\u201d\n\nMagdalene\u2019s nostrils flared delicately, as if she had just been offered something she could not tell at a glance was a treat or a trap. \u201cIt\u2019s the same. Worse paper. Cheaper ink. Sign of a man who chooses cost over comfort because he thinks the discomfort proves his seriousness.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Elias said. \u201cAlso he has a scar.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe all have scars.\u201d Magdalene\u2019s eyes were dark as mischief. \u201cI suppose you want me to tell you where it was made. I suppose you want it brought to hand like a cake.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot cake,\u201d Elias said. \u201cBread.\u201d\n\n\u201cHm,\u201d she said, because she recognized the spell he was asking for and objected to it on principle. \u201cIt\u2019s below the school. In the old rooms where they kept the maps and the poor noise. The paper came up the road with a man who ought not have walked it. He wore his boots thin trying to keep quiet. He had a crow. It isn\u2019t really a crow. It\u2019s the habit of a crow\u2014the bit that loves bright, hateful bits\u2014and he feeds it pins.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Elias said, meaning it twice. \u201cDo you know him?\u201d\n\n\u201cI know what he reads,\u201d Magdalene said. \u201cHe reads instructions on how to be important.\u201d She bent to pick up a book and spoke to it as if it had whistled at her. \u201cHe reads lists. Mostly he reads the shape of his own mouth. Go with care. Do not let him make you into a litany. He will put numbers on you if he can.\u201d She lifted her head and the softness was gone. \u201cIf you come back with less of your name I will keep the remainder safe for you,\u201d she said. \u201cEven if it is only the dot.\u201d\n\n\u201cKeep the dot,\u201d Elias said. \u201cThat\u2019s the piece men miss. Thank you.\u201d\n\nOutside, the street was bent in the shape of an arrow pointing north. It had always been bent that way. Elias had not always been willing to see it. He and Quill walked the length of it and no one stopped them. The town loomed behind and then merely stood there, its little windows looking into its little rooms, making soup of its life. The school on the northern edge had been a scandal when it was next to new; the builders had run off with the money and the roof was wrong and the boys had learned to recite multiplication tables exactly loudly enough to drown the drip in the back corridor. Elias and Quill went round to the side where the slate fell green and the moss kept house on the steps.\n\nThe door to the lower rooms was kept with a slat and a promise. Elias unhooked both. The air that breathed out at him was tidy and wrong, as if someone had put all the chairs on the tables and called it truth.\n\n\u201cYou should call him out,\u201d Quill said. \u201cYou should knock and say Come taste your own mouth. You should make him eat it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI should make him come to my kitchen,\u201d Elias said. \u201cThe sky, it turns out, is mine. The water. The inside of my house. Not this. Not yet.\u201d\n\nThey went down the steps. One of the bulbs had burnt out and the others made a noise like a furious fly. The air smelled of wet string and school soups. Elias felt the first thread of Vellum Crowe\u2019s presence like a glove. It slid across his knuckles and then he was wearing it whether he wished or not.\n\nA door stood ajar. Ink lay on the floor in a skin. Someone had tried to leave and had not. Elias stepped carefully around a dark oval that was not a bucket and not a shadow. Quill\u2019s fur stood up in a stripe. \u201cHe sees us,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d Elias said. \u201cLet him. He\u2019s watching from nowhere. This is no one\u2019s house. He has not fed it. It will not keep him.\u201d\n\n\u201cElias Fiske,\u201d said a voice. It was a thin voice taught to be wide. It came from the next room and from the ceiling and from inside the frame of a fake map that had never been a country. It had a smile wrapped up in it for later use. \u201cAndover\u2019s broom. Andover\u2019s boy. Did you like the joke about the window? It made them look at themselves. It made them very clean.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am not a boy,\u201d Elias said, because it was an inexplicable point of pride with him and always had been. \u201cYou\u2019re Vellum Crowe. Or whatever your mother calls you when you\u2019ve been unkind to your dinner.\u201d\n\nSomething moved in the corner of the room, a shadow picking at its nails. \u201cMy mother,\u201d the voice said thoughtfully. \u201cI do not remember what she called me. People remember that sort of thing. I only remember that I was told not to point because I would call things and then what would we do. But here we are. I pointed. What will we do.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe,\u201d Elias said, entering the room and then stopping because he knew a trap when he felt one, \u201cwill sit. You can stand. It\u2019s your mess.\u201d He stood anyway. The room had no chairs; they had been turned into what chairs are when they forget: splinters and rudeness. A press squatted in the corner, proud of its iron. Its handle gleamed from liking hands and the idea of hands. On the wall hung letters cut out of paper and pinned on with steel. The floor had the grit of tears.\n\n\u201cYou think words are air,\u201d Vellum Crowe said, and Elias heard the way he said words, the s in it like a bit of broken glass. \u201cYou think they will sweep if you tell them to because you are a whispering man. Boys who whisper at rivers. Little ones.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think words are the floors we stand on,\u201d Elias said. \u201cAnd the roofs that keep us from getting wet. And the bowls we put soup in. And the names of our daughters in our mouths when we are ill. They are not toys and they are not pins and they are not what you think they are when you stay below the sky.\u201d\n\nThe silence that followed had in it the exact sound of Vellum Crowe glancing at the ceiling and failing to remember what color sky might be. \u201cYou will lose your town,\u201d he said lightly. \u201cThey will eat you and not because they are hungry. Only because it is something to do.\u201d He moved then and stepped into himself and there he was: a narrow man, more colorless than pale, with ink at his cuffs and a ring of powder at his collarbone where he had patted himself to keep from shining with sweat. His hair had tried to be black and had given up. He had chosen his nose as if picking one from a jar, not considering whether it would suit him. His mouth was not the kind you would lend a cup to. He smiled. \u201cIt is already happening,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou sign your papers with a crow\u2019s foot,\u201d Elias said.\n\n\u201cI sign the parts of people that think they\u2019re resistant,\u201d Vellum said. \u201cI make space. I make room between mouths and brains. I give time for people to see their own ideas come walking. Have you never wanted that?\u201d\n\nElias thought of a day ten years ago when he had stood on the bridge and wanted the river to swallow a man who had said his mother had\u2026 he shut the thought away with a shuffle, as you would tuck in a sheet. \u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cNot enough to put my face in it. You do not smell like a basement. You smell like an attic. Did your mother send you up there? Sit with the wasps and old hats. Make up names for them. Come down with a bent back.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will tell me a story to make me into a person people don\u2019t hate,\u201d Vellum said. He leaned sideways and a row of letters leaned with him, charmed. \u201cEveryone thinks he\u2019s a mother. Even cats.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will tell you one,\u201d Elias said, and he felt Quill prick his ankle with one needle of claw: be careful, old man. \u201cSlowly. Later. For now, I will take back what you put in my town. I will pour water on it and let it swell and swell and turn back into pulp and plant and dirt.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will never take it all,\u201d Vellum said, and his mouth did something that wanted to be a chuckle and became a cough. \u201cThey will always remember a part. The bad part. People keep those. They polish with them.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d Elias said, and the knowledge lay heavy and honest between them. \u201cYes. But I will mend and mend. That is my magic. Yours is to break and be entertained. Mine is to feel my hands hurt.\u201d\n\nVellum\u2019s eyes\u2014he had gray eyes, ink washed with rain\u2014narrowed. \u201cWe are not so different. I do not break. I write. The town breaks itself on the reading.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s worse,\u201d Quill said. He had kept still until now. He put his tail high and walked over the floor with terrible daintiness as if he were in another place where there were flowers worth not stepping on. \u201cElias,\u201d he said, \u201cthis smells like a story where the first chapter is someone in a cellar telling themselves they\u2019re right.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt does,\u201d Elias said. He took out the painted soldier and set it on the press. Vellum\u2019s gaze caught on it. A little startled heat rose in his cheeks, a child caught taking apples. Elias did not know what it meant but he knew it well enough to tuck away. \u201cThis is the bit where I tell you what I need. I need you to stop sending paper into the rooms of children. I need you to keep my name out of your mouth.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou cannot take the food from me,\u201d Vellum said. \u201cI eat this.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will give you soup,\u201d Quill offered, deadpan. \u201cBread and soup. A blanket.\u201d\n\n\u201cBe careful,\u201d Vellum said, and now the glass-forward sneer was gone. In its place was something like warning. \u201cI have a picture of you in my pocket in which you are crying. If I let it out\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll make me cry,\u201d Elias said. \u201cYes. And then what. You\u2019ll send a paper around to tell them I cried? They will not mind. They keep vegetables in the cool. I am a man with a hearth. You cannot win that way.\u201d\n\nVellum straightened and the room tightened, as if someone had pulled the cloth of it inward and tied a knot in the middle. He moved his fingers and the letters on the wall pulled themselves off and came like moths, a cloud of barbed edges. They whispered as they came. One of them said liar in Elias\u2019s left ear and one of them said fiend in his right and one of them climbed the side of his neck to tell him for certain of Mrs. Troon\u2019s baby meeting its end by noon without his meddling. He could feel the burrs; he closed his eyes because he would not give them the color of them.\n\nQuill leaped. He was small but you do not have to be large to interfere. He went mouth-open at the letter called fiend and swallowed it with an ugly gulp and spat it out into a corner, where it lay twitching like a centipede. Elias, eyes still shut, reached out and said the word he had said to the window. He said it three times, the last time almost without sound, and the letters lost interest in the thought they had been given and fluttered aimlessly in the beam of the buzzing lights. Vellum hissed between his teeth.\n\n\u201cHousework,\u201d he said contemptuously. \u201cYou sweep. You make dust. You are a small man with a broom. You believe if you tidy enough you will not think about the two days your mother did not come home.\u201d\n\nElias opened his eyes and looked at him and the hurt in the center of him burned a color Vellum would not have a word for if he had all the pamphlets in the world. \u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd yet we will see.\u201d\n\n\u201cGo back,\u201d Vellum said, suddenly sharp, as if he had pricked his own finger on his own pin. \u201cGo back and wait. I have not finished deciding what to call you. If I name you right you will be kindling.\u201d\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t be,\u201d Elias said, and then, because he had been taught not to leave a room without taking something from it to keep it from coming after you, he took a small thing: the dot. The dot at the end of a sentence pinned above the press, forgotten, humble, necessary. He put it in his pocket and felt it settle there like a stone and like a seed. He turned and went out.\n\nOn the steps, north falling away ahead like a question, the sky showing its throat, Quill shook himself hard. Tiny flecks of black came off his whiskers. \u201cHe pricked you,\u201d the cat said.\n\n\u201cHe did,\u201d Elias said. His voice did not shake. It would later. \u201cHe knows where to push. He\u2019s had practice.\u201d\n\n\u201cNorth,\u201d Quill said, peering up out of his own head at the new place where the ache had shifted to. \u201cNot always north.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Elias said. He put his hand in his pocket and touched the period. It was warm. It was ridiculous. It was the end of a sentence without its sentence. It made him smile. \u201cWe\u2019ll go where he thinks we won\u2019t. And we\u2019ll go with both hands. Andover is not a small thing. It is a weight in my mouth. He can go on making nasty stories until his fingers bleed. I\u2019ll learn the bigger ones.\u201d\n\nThey stood there until the bell in the church stepped a chime into the town and the sound went up and came down again, and Elias and his cat set their feet toward home. The town breathed them in and did not choke. The air, for once, said nothing about children in soups. Hester Stowe ran past them with her hair uncombed and did not look away. She waved. She shouted over her shoulder, clear as brass, \u201cMy brother says you made him feel silly. I told him he needed the practice.\u201d Elias waved and the dot in his pocket beat once against his fingers like a heart. He looked at the sky and saw a shape in it that might have been a crow, might have been a piece of scrap blown up and up.\n\n\u201cLet him tell it,\u201d he said aloud, to the sky, to the town. \u201cWe\u2019ll tell a better one.\u201d The day went on and the smell of a bakery came along the street and he told his feet to keep in time with it and not with the voice in his memory saying, do not look them in the eye. He looked everyone in the eye. If it stung, well, tea would help.\n\nThat night he read no pamphlets. He took out the biscuit tin and laid the second one on top of the first, and set a book on them and a stone he had brought home from the river and then his hand, as if blessing bread. Quill slept with his back jammed against Elias\u2019s chest, guarding with his spine. Andover snored again. Somewhere in the rooms below the school a man went on telling himself that the story was the same as the person, that if you got the word right you would own the thing. He would find out otherwise. It would not happen quickly. But it would. And when the morning came, Elias would rise and wash his face and go to buy sausages and pick up a letter from Magdalene Plum. It would say, in her prim hand, three scratches and a dot. It would say: we are not brittle. It would say the thing he needed and the thing he already knew, which was that a line can be drawn under anything, and under that line might be written a better thought. He would take up his broom and his penknife and his cat. He would go on. The hero of Andover does not glow. He stands. He goes back for the small, fallen, required. He knows\u2014which is a kind of magic, too\u2014that you cannot win a town with ink. You win it by living in it long enough to know where the tea is kept. He meant to live long enough. And longer, if he could be rude about it.",

                              "content": "The next morning began with flour on the air. Saturday had arrived with its hands full. Bread rose in ovens and people in beds and a pale sun put its shoulder to the roofs and shoved. Elias had the habit of taking Saturday by the polite scruff and showing it where to stand. He swept his step, because it was neighborly, and returned Mrs. Troon\u2019s handkerchief washed and pressed, because she would see the pressing and believe in the washing. He found three pebbles in his pocket that he did not remember collecting and set them on the sill to see if they had any intention in them. One did; it wanted to be part of a ring. He left it to think the rest through.\n\nQuill, who had no patience with pebbles, was stalking the mild, important fly that lived in the kitchen and had learned the shape of a cat\u2019s paw and the sound of a shout. \u201cIt will die in a week,\u201d Quill said, sitting down suddenly as if overcome by mercy. \u201cOr of boredom. It visits only three corners. It is a fly with a limited imagination.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is a fly who knows what it is about,\u201d Elias said. He tied his scarf without looking and it came out even. Evenness on a Saturday was a spell all its own. \u201cWe\u2019re going to Magdalene\u2019s,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd then to the green.\u201d\n\nQuill\u2019s ears twitched. \u201cWe are taking books to the grass? They don\u2019t like it. Grass goes between the pages and then you hear whispering when you open to find a recipe.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot books,\u201d Elias said. \u201cBoards.\u201d\n\nMagdalene Plum had said no three times before she said yes, and she had done it with her eyebrows and an intake of breath and a lean away and finally with her mouth. \u201cYou will not print an argument,\u201d she said as if it were a swear. \u201cYou will not print a defense. You will not print the words not and true on the same line.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Elias said. \u201cShopping lists.\u201d\n\nShe stared at him. \u201cYou are a tiresome man.\u201d\n\n\u201cNevertheless,\u201d Elias said, and his smile did not work on Magdalene because she had known him since he was a boy and had watched him call a lost kitten out of a coal scuttle and then ask it to return the coal. \u201cBlank shopping lists,\u201d he clarified. \u201cName at the top. Little lines below, with nothing on them. And a place at the bottom for a note to oneself.\u201d\n\nMagdalene made the sound of a woman considering both treason and tea. \u201cIt will look like charity,\u201d she said after a moment. \u201cThe sort women took and then hid when husbands came in.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt will be charity,\u201d Elias said. \u201cIt will be the sort of charity you cannot be ashamed of because you can cover a jar with it.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd in the fibers you will,\u201d she said, and it wasn\u2019t a question.\n\n\u201cI will put nothing that will sting,\u201d Elias said. He softened his voice as he would for a nervous dog. \u201cOnly the word that sends people back to their coats to fetch their gloves. Only the word that makes them put the kettle on before tears. Only the sound a brush makes when it finds the corner you always forget.\u201d\n\nMagdalene sighed. \u201cBring me the period,\u201d she said. \u201cThe little dot you took as if you were stealing an egg.\u201d\n\nElias did not ask her how she knew. He reached into his pocket and drew the small black speck onto his palm. It looked like nothing. It was nothing until you needed it. Magdalene did not touch it. She bent over it as if listening and the dot listened back. She nodded. \u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cHe will hate this.\u201d She laid a slip of transparent paper over Elias\u2019s hand and lifted the dot\u2019s shadow and slid that into a forme with a care like baptism. \u201cDo not make me do this again,\u201d she muttered, and then, because her heart had never once in its life agreed to be hardened and stay, she added, \u201cBut if you must, warn me. I will not be taken by surprise by goodness.\u201d\n\nThey printed fifty. The paper was not fine. It was that useful brown that seems to have been born wrapped round apples. The lists came off the press with a smell like rain on a pantry. Magdalene eyed the stack as if it might run. \u201cYou will need strings,\u201d she said. \u201cFor hanging. The backs of doors. Pegs will sulk if you leave them out.\u201d She took a skein from a drawer and cut lengths with a knife that had been her father\u2019s and his mother\u2019s and\u2014if Andover kept itself from burning down or eating its own children\u2014would belong to a niece yet to be born. She licked her forefinger and smoothed the ends. A small gesture, a small spell. Elias loved the woman for it. He thought he had loved her already for refusing him three times and he had, but this\u2014licked forefinger, neat ends\u2014added itself to the tally.\n\nOn the green, where men were setting up their stalls and children were arranging coins into shapes that looked like bigger coins, Elias borrowed the town\u2019s attention the way a bell borrows air. He stood on the flat top of the old mile stone, which had lost the number for the next place and kept the number for the one behind as if it could only bear to remember home. He did not clear his throat. He did not raise his arms. He let the sun find the list in his hand and make it glow.\n\n\u201cYou will have pamphlets,\u201d he said when the crowd had gathered in the way a crowd always does on a green when someone stands a little higher than the rest. \u201cAgain. Today, probably. Tomorrow certainly. He will put numbers on you. He will tell you what you are worth. He will put measurements on your children like coats. He will tell you the names of the parts of your soul and then give you the wrong definitions. He is very good at adding. He has forgotten how to count to one.\u201d\n\nA laugh moved through the crowd like someone trying not to cough and failing. Hester Stowe stood with both hands in her pockets and showed her teeth at the idea of anyone numbering her.\n\n\u201cThis,\u201d Elias said, holding up the list, \u201cis for adding back. It is for writing what you need and what you want and what you will forgive yourself for not having when the week is out. It is for putting your name at the top of your own life. You will hang it behind the door where you keep the broom. When you think something ugly, you will write butter. When you think something mean, you will write soap. When you cannot think at all, you will draw a square where the sugar lives. If you have a neighbor who cannot read, you will go and put a square in their square. If you can read and you read the sort of word that sticks in your skin, you will come to me and I will make tea. If you have better tea than mine, I will come to you.\u201d\n\nSomeone, and it might have been Mr. Crisp\u2019s daughter because she had never before spent a word where a look would do and had lately begun to spend, said, low and clear, \u201cYes.\u201d\n\nElias did not say it was magic. He did not say it was defense. He said, \u201cMagdalene Plum has made these. You may pay her in pennies or jam. If you have neither, you may pay her in kindness and she will remember you to your credit the next time you buy thread.\u201d Magdalene, who would not for the world be seen accepting jam as payment for paper, lifted her chin and took the first coins with a sniff that made paying in kindness feel extravagant.\n\nQuill, bored with speeches and delighted by distribution, leaped from shoulder to shoulder with lengths of string in his mouth as if he were ribboning a maypole. He allowed three children to pet him and bit none of them. \u201cOne each,\u201d he said sternly when Hester tried to take two. \u201cThey multiply in houses. They do not multiply in pockets.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey do if you tear them in half,\u201d Hester retorted. \u201cTwo smaller lists.\u201d\n\n\u201cMathematical fraud,\u201d Quill said. \u201cGo stand on your brother\u2019s foot.\u201d She went.\n\nThe noon bells, when they came, were late. They came in a disorder like a man coming down stairs carrying too many books. Heads turned toward the tower. People whose lives ran on those twelve notes frowned. The bell rope down the church\u2019s back corridor had a particular feel on a Saturday, rough from the week, oiled with the touch of a hundred palms. Elijah Grieves, who rang them, was a man who rarely looked up; the bell had taken its shape in him, a roundness where others were square. He came out of the side door shaking his hands as if he had dipped them in nettles.\n\n\u201cThey were numbered,\u201d he said, when Elias reached him on the path. \u201cHe put numbers on them. It didn\u2019t change the sound. It did change it. I cannot say. I heard a one where there is none.\u201d He lifted his palms. Across the pads of his fingers a row of faint gray marks had been laid like rules on paper. One, two, three, four, five. He had stopped before six.\n\nElias felt in his mouth the small brave word his town had been learning to say. He did not say it aloud yet. He turned Elijah\u2019s hands and breath caught in his chest as if he had picked up something heavy wrong. The marks were not ink. They were ash. The ash had been pressed in by something that meant to teach.\n\n\u201cI will see the ropes,\u201d he said. \u201cWould you stand in the sun and forget what numbers are for a minute.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do it often,\u201d Elijah said with humility. He went to stand by the chest tomb he was not related to, and he put his face up like a man warming his bones. Elias and Quill went inside the cool blue of the church.\n\nThe great loops of rope hung like enormous, sleeping snakes. At the base of each, knots had been tied where no knots belonged: neat, tight, too small for the size of rope. Around each knot a number had been chalked on with something not chalk, something that hated skin. One. Two. Three. Elias put his palm to One. The rope resisted him. It had been taught to obey a counting that was not the bell\u2019s own.\n\n\u201cYou are very tidy,\u201d he said to the nave. Dust shivered. \u201cYou are very ordered. You have the sort of order that makes girls stand up straight against walls. It is not the only sort.\u201d\n\nHe took out one of the strings Magdalene had cut and tied it very loosely around the middle of the rope. Then he tied a second string below and a third above. He breathed out and spoke the word of setting things to rights the way a mother\u2019s friend speaks it while she picks up the skirts of her dress and wades into the playroom. The rope shifted, thinking. The knot thought of being undone and did not yet undo. Truth did not argue. It poured tea and went on pouring when the guest sulked. Elias touched the chalk numbers with his knuckle and closed his eyes and saw the chalk before it had been chalk and the hand before it had held chalk and the boy before the hand grew big. He pressed his thumb against One and said, weary and gentle, \u201cEnough.\u201d\n\nThe number went out like a candle you blow and pretend someone else did. The knot unlearned itself. Two took longer. Three spat. Four came away with satisfaction; it had known it was ridiculous, stuck where it was. Five was a little blood. He wiped it on his trousers and told no one.\n\nOutside, Elijah rolled his shoulders as if the bell had started to remember the curve of them. \u201cBetter,\u201d he said. \u201cHe will not like that.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe will be late to his dinner,\u201d Elias said. \u201cNo one likes that.\u201d He stood on the step and looked over Andover and the way the roofs made a quilt to keep something warm underneath. He could feel another place tugging at him like a loose thread caught on a nail. North one day ago. Not north today. East. The ache had moved to under his right shoulder. \u201cHe is making lists,\u201d he said absently. \u201cDo not listen to them unless they say bread, salt, pickles.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe will put numbers on doors,\u201d Elijah said.\n\n\u201cHe will,\u201d Elias agreed. \u201cWe will put flowers over them. He will say we\u2019re foolish. We will be foolish. And we will eat.\u201d\n\nThey were halfway down the path to the green when the first door was chalked. The child who did it was not a child; he was a man named Short John because he was long, and he held a square of gray pressed stuff and ran it across the blue of Mrs. Coppin\u2019s door with a hunger that did not belong to his stomach. A four appeared, then a decimal, then a six. He looked at his work the way an apprentice looks at a chair he has planed smooth, and smile-pride broke over his face and then was gone as if water had thrown it out.\n\n\u201cJohn,\u201d Elias said mildly, \u201cyou have something on your hand.\u201d\n\nJohn stared at his palm as if he had been awakened. There was no chalk there, only that not-chalk ash, settled in the whorls. He looked at the door. He looked at Elias. \u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d he said, but quiet, as if the say was a question.\n\n\u201cYou do,\u201d Elias said. \u201cGive it here.\u201d He reached for John\u2019s hand and took it as he would a rope with a house tied to the other end. \u201cPut your other hand on your own chest,\u201d he added, and John obeyed because people like him, who had been told to put their hands on benches and tables and planks and put them sensibly, sometimes needed directions when it came to themselves. Elias leaned forward and blew, once, on the palm. The ash scattered as if surprised to discover it had no roots. \u201cThere,\u201d Elias said. He stepped past John and wrote over the number with the heel of his own hand, not words. He rubbed until the blue came back. He patted the wood because the wood had felt it. \u201cHester,\u201d he called, without looking, \u201cbring me a flower with a head not bigger than your nose.\u201d\n\nHester came at once, as if she had been waiting behind him all his life. She had a nasturtium, violent and impossible. Elias took it and tucked it into the splinter beside the latch. \u201cNow,\u201d he said to the door, to Mrs. Coppin\u2019s kitchen, to the corner where she kept the sugar, \u201cyou may look silly all afternoon. It will help.\u201d\n\nMrs. Coppin, who had never been silly in any public way, laughed from inside, unoffended, and the small devil in the chalk lifted its head and lost interest. John wiped his palm on his waistcoat as if that would undo something else. \u201cI thought I was helping,\u201d he said, bewildered.\n\n\u201cYou were,\u201d Elias said. He meant it. \u201cYou were helping prove that chalk does not say God.\u201d He felt the ache under his shoulder move and he put two fingers there and pressed. \u201cIf you feel like writing numbers,\u201d he added to John, \u201cwrite the number of your own door. It will bring you home.\u201d\n\nBy afternoon, Andover wore flowers like a girl who had run out of ears to stick them behind. Numbers appeared and were rubbed away and were covered with leaves of ivy and the paper labels of tins of syrup. Magdalene\u2019s lists had been hung beside brooms; the lines began to fill with butter and soap and thread and patience and more patience and forgive myself for thinking the wrong thought and a drawing of a cat with a hat on that could only have been Hester\u2019s. Quill napped with his head inside a bowl because that way no one would put words in it. Three times the black birds that were not birds tried to batter themselves to bits on the panes of the post office. Three times Mr. Bobbin, who had once played the fiddle badly in a pub and wished sometimes he still did, waltzed them away with a fly whisk and the obstinate grace of a man in his shirtsleeves dancing alone.\n\nIn the midst of this, when the day might have been called a success by someone who counted wins by notches cut in door frames, Vellum Crowe sent a thing so quiet that if Hester had not been looking at Elias since morning as if she could protect him with a stare, no one would have noticed it.\n\nIt came as a boy with a tray of buttons.\n\nHe had been a boy for years and would be one for some years yet; he had the knees and the scuffed shoes and the opinion of bread that boys have. He had a tray hung from his neck with a strap and on the tray were buttons, bone and wooden and glass, buttons that had belonged to miens of coats and dresses that had been out of fashion when the King was a different man. The buttons were threaded through card and each card had two words inked at the top. Brave Girl. Honest Wife. Good Man. Faithful Son. The boy\u2019s face was blank and not unhappy, the way faces are in the moment after someone says the first sentence in a story you have heard before. He went person to person and lifted the tray as if he were in church and the tray held wine and you had already drunk and must not take more. People took, because buttons are useful and names are a hunger.\n\nHester reached him before Elias did. She stood with her fists on her hips and tilted her chin until her hair touched her spine and refused Good Girl and said, \u201cDo you have Stupid Brother.\u201d\n\nThe boy raised his eyes and had to be a boy for three heartbeats longer than was polite. \u201cNo,\u201d he said, through the voice of someone who wished he could peach and could not. \u201cOnly these.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat if I am not good and not a girl,\u201d Hester said, tempted by fairies and devils both, \u201cbut something else.\u201d\n\nThe boy hesitated. He looked down at his tray and reached for a card and stopped and reached for another. His fingers hovered above Truth Teller. He lifted it as if it were heftless and heavy, which it was, and he would have pinned it on her chest if Elias had not touched his wrist. The boy startled and came back into himself like a man into a cold room. His eyes filled with tears because his eyes had been about to be taken from him. He put the card back. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said, to Hester, to Elias, to the buttons.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not you,\u201d Elias said, to the boy and to the town and to himself. \u201cGo home. Give those to Magdalene. She will string them on the right names.\u201d He lifted the tray off the boy\u2019s neck and the boy sagged with relief and ran. The buttons made a small rain on the green when the tray tilted. Elias crouched and picked up Truth Teller. The card tried to stick to his finger and he gave it one firm look and it changed its mind. He slid the card into his pocket behind the dot and felt the two sit there together like knowledge and action.\n\n\u201cWill you give it to me,\u201d Hester demanded, because she had heard the words and claimed them with the instantaneous greed of a thief with a code. \u201cWill you pin it on. If you do, it will stick.\u201d She sounded as if she wanted a brand. Quill made a sound not unlike the light failing in a lamp. He came and stood between Hester and the card with such careful rudeness that Hester had to look him in the face. He had cat angles. He had cat eyes. They were currently two very small moons.\n\n\u201cYou will not wear any word today,\u201d Quill said. He did not hiss. He did not purr. He pronounced. \u201cYou will eat. You will run. You will say three times my name is Hester Stowe and the only thing true in that sentence is that I am not a stove. You will laugh at yourself because you are very funny. You will not hold out your chest for anyone\u2019s pin.\u201d He flicked her jumper with a paw, less than the tap you might give a child\u2019s shoulder with your knuckle when she is dreaming. Hester\u2019s chin came down. She did as she was told. She looked smaller. She went away to be large somewhere else.\n\n\u201cButtons,\u201d Elias muttered, when she had gone. \u201cHe will send mirrors next. He will call himself a philanthropist.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe will send knives measured in kindnesses,\u201d Quill said, disgusted. \u201cAll dull. All sharp.\u201d\n\nThey walked the green until shadows began to think seriously about work. They rubbed away numbers. They hung lists. They put flowers in places that were very stern about flowers. Elias took three complaints and swallowed them without chewing because he did not have time to argue with Mrs. Hardesty about whether her sausages had suffered; they had not. He drank tea offered and tea taken and a tea that was not tea at all but barley boiled with a bay leaf because someone\u2019s grandmother had done it that way and no one had stopped her. He made a small boy swallow a lie he had just heard and then take a sip of water because swallowing things dry is foolish. He stood under a tree and looked north and east and west in turn and felt each direction press against him like a dog leaning its weight. He had said he would go where Vellum wanted him not to go and Vellum wanted him not to stay. So he stayed. No heroism. Only a man in a town where he lived.\n\nNight now had a shadow on it that it had not had before. People went home not briskly, not slow. They went home as if something were following and something else were leading and they were trying to arrange themselves between. Elias went indoors and lit his small lamp because he preferred oil to gas when he was going to do something that ought to have the right sort of flame. He set the biscuit tin on the table and took the pamphlets out and considered them the way a farmer might consider a dead fox: not with sentiment, not without a spasm of something like anger. He lifted the lid of the bottom of his teapot and took out what he had hidden there a year ago because he did not know why he had hidden it and it felt important. A thin strip of ribbon. It was the ribbon his mother had tied round her hair when she wanted it out of her eyes to scrub. It had a song in it. It had water. It had the smell of soap made from fat that had been saved and saved and finally used. He laid the ribbon across the pamphlets and said the name he never said, the one under his own. \u201cAll right,\u201d he said, to the paper, to the ribbon, to the piece of his life that had found him at his table. \u201cWe will be with each other now.\u201d\n\nQuill came very slowly and put his paw on Elias\u2019s wrist with the delicacy of a prince who knows the weight of a crown and refuses it. Elias did not begin to cry and he did not begin to look heroic. He breathed. The ribbon lay and lay and did what ribbons do when they have been taught all their lives to hold. The papers seemed to find themselves less interesting and more tiresome. The nasty burr in the second one shifted as if it had been dislodged by a careless elbow and fell apart. The first one thought of its title and then of its margin and then of the weed in the margin and then of the root of the weed and went home. Elias took them up and put them back in the tin and set the book and the stone and his hand on top in turn and did not worry if there was a formula in the order. There was and there wasn\u2019t; that was life.\n\n\u201cYou will go tomorrow,\u201d Quill said eventually into the quiet that had deepened like the color of water at dusk.\n\n\u201cI will go in the morning,\u201d Elias said. \u201cBefore the day puts its boots on. He took his dinner late; he will sleep late. He will think I have forgotten where the door to the lower rooms is. He will think I have decided to be a broom forever and never a brush.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are not a brush,\u201d Quill said. \u201cA brush is for paint. You are for corners.\u201d\n\n\u201cDifferent sorts,\u201d Elias said. He stretched his fingers and looked at their tips as if there might be a reckoning under the nails. Five little numbers there. No ash. \u201cHe will ask me to be numbered,\u201d he added. \u201cHe will ask me to tell him what I am in his words. He will say I am a sad son and I will flinch because it is true and not his. He will say I am a man who tidies in order not to grieve. I will say that grief leaves crumbs and someone must sweep.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will say it,\u201d Quill said, satisfied. \u201cSay the thing he cannot say without eating a part of himself that he wants to keep.\u201d\n\nThe dawn came with a taste of tin. The sky had beaten itself flat to lay better over Andover; something to do with pressure and weather and the way fields lie in late autumn. Elias put his hands on the table palms down and pressed, as if he could fasten himself to the world so that if a wind came and played tricks he would not be the leaf in it. He put the dot in his pocket and the Truth Teller card next to it and the ribbon round the pamphlets and the soldier in his breast, foolishly, because he had liked its weight on the press and thought the press might have liked its weight back. He did not tell Quill to stay. Quill did not ask to go. They went.\n\nThe school was less sentient in the morning. It had not yet remembered its damp. The steps were slick but not malicious. Elias left his hand on the wall as he went down and told it an unimportant thing as if to keep it in conversation: the way Mrs. Coppin put her spoon on a plate and not on the stove back and how he had learned to do the same. The wall did not reply. It listened. Sometimes that was enough.\n\nAt the door to the lower room, where ink had slept, a new sign had been hung. It had been thumbtacked\u2014no spell\u2014just hit and held. It said, in precise hand-done capitals, PRIVATE INSTRUCTION. There was a line drawn under it so straight that it had to be wrong. Elias wanted to pull the sign down and write underneath it, NO CHILDREN, but he did not. He opened the door.\n\nVellum Crowe was awake. He had not slept. He had been awake, learning. He had a cup on the table and something that might have been soup in it and he had not eaten. He had his sleeves rolled up and his thin forearms were scribbled with ink formulas because he was the sort of man who remembers better when his own skin agrees to be paper. He looked at Elias and in the single breath they took together, something like relief crossed his face. It was a man\u2019s relief when he hears the footstep coming that will not be turned away.\n\n\u201cYou stayed,\u201d Vellum said. \u201cYou did not come when I told you to. You made errands. And lists. You are trite.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am durable,\u201d Elias said. \u201cYou can write me as clever or not clever as you like. I will still be here when your pen runs out.\u201d\n\nVellum\u2019s mouth did an unwise thing then; it softened. He caught it and straightened it with a touch that would have been tender if it had been on anyone\u2019s flesh but his own. \u201cSay what you came to say,\u201d he commanded, and each word struck the air and pressed wrinkles into it that would not smooth easily. \u201cSay it. We will name. We will put the correct nouns with the correct verbs. You are a broom.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am a man,\u201d Elias said. He took the dot from his pocket and did not show it. He put his hand, that hand that had been taught by a woman who sang, on the end of the press as if to introduce two old creatures. \u201cYou are a boy who forgot what his mother called him,\u201d he added, not cruel, not kind. He added, after a small time in which Vellum remembered to blink, \u201cI brought you a soldier.\u201d\n\nThe look Vellum gave the painted thing on the table was so quick you might have missed it if you were the sort to miss things on purpose. Elias was not. Vellum\u2019s throat worked. \u201cI do not play,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou do not stop,\u201d Elias said. \u201cWhich is not the same.\u201d He took the truth card from his pocket and the dot with it and set them together on the press. \u201cYou sent buttons. You sent words to wear. You sent numbers. You sent whispers that teach women to lay children down and call it safety. You know how to thread malice. I know how to unthread it. If I die of it one day, at least the last thing I will have eaten will not be a lie.\u201d\n\nVellum\u2019s eyes flicked to the door and back. He was checking the room to be certain it stayed his. \u201cYou would die as easily as a word,\u201d he said. It was intended to be threat. It sounded like the thing men say when they love a sentence on a page and cannot get it out in any human way.\n\n\u201cThen put me down with the good ones,\u201d Elias said. He looked Vellum in the eyes because men had already been told not to and because Hester had done it for him when she laughed and said she was not a stove. \u201cYou will put my mother in your next pamphlet. You have already written a paragraph about her in your head. You have written a sentence in which she did not come home for two days and a second in which she did and a third in which there was someone with her and a fourth in which there was no one and the fourth is the worst of them because it has nothing pointed to it except absence and you will let people fill it with whatever dirt they have near to hand. If you write it, I will find you and I will take your name and sew it into my pocket and you will have to come to me to ask for it back.\u201d\n\nVellum\u2019s hands, which had been practicing composure for fifty mornings, curled in on themselves as if they might learn to be fists. \u201cYou think you are a hero,\u201d he said. Not a sneer. A boy trying on a tone and finding it too big.\n\n\u201cI think I am necessary,\u201d Elias said. \u201cI am not alone. My town knows where its tea is. The truth does not have to be shouted down the street. It will be put on the back of a door and looked at before someone leaves for the market.\u201d He laid the truth card with its neat little letters face down. He held the dot on the center of it with his thumb. \u201cWe are going to set something down,\u201d he said, and the press creaked as if clearing its own throat. \u201cAnd we are going to leave it there.\u201d\n\nVellum moved faster than Quill liked. He picked up a handful of letters and he threw them, and each was meant to be a nail. Quill did a thing he despised, which was to look like a fool for usefulness\u2019s sake: he thrust himself between the letters and Elias and let them tangle in his fur because his fur was the sort of thing malicious words slide off when they have not planned for whiskers. He spat, ugly. He sank his teeth in liar and it tasted of bitter almonds and the moment when a sweet goes bad on your tongue. He swallowed anyway. He felt it crawl and then he was Quill hard, that line of cat that goes from nose to tail like a string plucked. He hissed and disliked himself for hissing and did it again.\n\n\u201cI know your name,\u201d Elias said, to Vellum, with the dot under his thumb and the card under the dot and the ribbon in his pocket and the soldier waiting with his badly painted nose. \u201cNot the one you chose. The one someone else said to you without clothes on it. I do not need to say it. It is a small name. It is the name of a boy in a room being told not to point. You will not like me for this. You will not be able to make a pamphlet that does not smell of mildew if you write me into it.\u201d He lifted his thumb. He did not speak a spell. He said the word that lives in every house and men forget where it lives because they walk past it to get to the door. \u201cFull stop,\u201d he said. \u201cThere.\u201d\n\nIt was not light. It was not noise. It was the end of a sentence that had been running through the town for two days. It found the place in Mrs. Hardesty\u2019s kitchen where she kept the jar for flour and it sat in the bottom of it and waited to be scooped. It found the bell the boys rang with their fists when Elijah was not looking and it put a little period on the sound so that it could not run on into Ugly Theories About The Vicar\u2019s Sister. It found the place on Hester\u2019s mouth where a laugh had worn the skin thin and it settled there and made a small punctuation that felt like a healed scab. It found the pamphlets in the tin on Elias\u2019s table and laid a dot on the dot and said, without voice or bravado, enough.\n\nVellum Crowe swayed. He had been standing on the run-on. He had been breathing the breath people breathe when they are waiting for the next clause to give them their excuse. He put his hand out as if there were a chair and there was none\u2014he had turned them into splinters because he was a fool\u2014and he did not fall because falling would have been a drama and he was not written for drama, only for the nibbling bitterness of men in rooms. He said, very quietly, \u201cYou cannot print this.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Elias agreed. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t read. It sits.\u201d He touched the press, which had begun to look thoughtful, as presses do when you tell them you will not be using them for their ordinary wickedness and they are not sure they like virtue. \u201cYou could set it,\u201d he said to the iron. \u201cYou could do it by hand in churches and rooms where fights start and walk away once it takes.\u201d He lifted his hand and looked at Vellum and saw suddenly how thin the man had been made by his own wanting. The pity that came into him then had four legs and a tail. It was a cat. He did not show it. He said instead, \u201cWould you like soup.\u201d\n\nVellum looked at him as if he had said Would you like death. He made a face that was supposed to be disdain and could not be because he had turned his disdain into a pet and it had run away. \u201cYou will not make me into a story where we sit and share food and I learn to call you by your Christian name,\u201d he said. \u201cYou will not feed me.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are already in my story,\u201d Elias said. \u201cAnd you are very hungry.\u201d He took a step back, because pity was dangerous in the presence of a man who sharpened it for sport. \u201cI am going home,\u201d he said, because truth sometimes has doors in it and you must go through. \u201cIf you come up into the air I will speak to you. If you send paper to children I will stand in your doorway every morning until you stop and my town will bring me bread on days I am tired.\u201d\n\nVellum did not answer. His mouth had forgotten the trick. He looked at the soldier and turned away as if embarrassed by his own embarrassment. He lifted the cup that might have had soup in it and drank and choked because you cannot drink numbers and be satisfied.\n\nOn the steps, Elias let himself sit down for a long breath and then another. Quill arranged his whiskers with the lethal delicacy of a swordsman cleaning his blade. \u201cIf you ever,\u201d he said to Elias without heat, \u201cask me to swallow liar again, I will sleep in the drawer with the spoons and I will let them all have my fur forever.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d be handsome in spoons,\u201d Elias said. \u201cThink of the reflection.\u201d He leaned the back of his head against the stone and watched a spider do mathematics without numbers in the corner, putting leg to leg to silk to wall with neither chalk nor ash nor any man\u2019s pin. He looked at the morning, which was not much older than it had been when he\u2019d left the house, and thought how lengthened it felt already, like a day at the sea. \u201cWe are not done,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Quill said. \u201cBut you put a dot in the right place.\u201d He looked at Elias, and there was a thought in his yellow eyes that was not cat and not human and not town either. \u201cHe is one of those who has forgotten to want anything that doesn\u2019t have a label.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe wanted that soldier,\u201d Elias said. \u201cHe was six for a moment. People will tell you six is harmless. It is not. Six is violent. Six will learn a word and say it until it cuts and then cry because it cut and say it again for the shape of it. I will remember he wanted a toy. It will matter.\u201d\n\nThey walked home through a town that was discovering in a small way what it was to end a sentence. People spoke to each other and then stopped and smiled and did not say the extra nasty thought that had been waiting to come out like a rash. Mrs. Hardesty hung a list and put on it apples, lard, don\u2019t listen, more apples. Mr. Bobbin tuned his fiddle and decided not to play. Elijah Grieves rang the bells at the right hour and mistook a tone for another and did not mind, which was a revolution in a church taller than its own thought.\n\nOn Elias\u2019s table, under the stone and the book and his hand, two pieces of wicked paper behaved themselves with a sulk that would not last. He removed his hand. The book could sit alone. He thought of writing a notice and pinning it to his own door with a thumbtack that smelled of tin. PRIVATE INSTRUCTION, it would say, and underneath, in smaller letters, TEA.\n\nHe did not do it. He put the kettle on. He sat on his step. He looked at the street. Hester came and sat beside him without asking because only a very few people in a man\u2019s life get to do that, and she had given him a frog and two coins and nearly her trust and then her laugh, so she was in. They looked at the town together, and then at nothing, and that was fine.\n\n\u201cI stole something from the buttons,\u201d Hester said eventually, as if confessing and bragging were the same thing. \u201cThe one that said honest wife. I gave it to Mrs. Troon. She laughed and put it in her pocket.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d Elias said. \u201cPut things in your pockets. Then when a wind comes there will be weight there and you will not be turned inside out.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy brother said you only win because you talk like stories do and talking isn\u2019t anything,\u201d Hester said. \u201cI said he only loses because he listens like a donkey.\u201d She leaned against him, not much, a little weight. \u201cIs it winning,\u201d she asked, because there was nothing child in the question and everything child in the asking.\n\n\u201cIt is ending a sentence,\u201d Elias said. \u201cIt is putting a pot on the table and saying This is your spoon, this is mine. It is making lists and rubbing chalk. It isn\u2019t much. It is more than nothing.\u201d He thought of Vellum in his room smelling of ash and difficult childhood and soup he wouldn\u2019t eat. \u201cIt is not winning,\u201d he said, and Hester heard the word not because she wore a Truth invisible and that made words closer to her skin. \u201cIt is refusing to lose in the way that would please him.\u201d\n\nQuill made a sound like bridal lace. He had caught the fly with the inadequate imagination somewhere between Magdalene\u2019s and the green and was groomingly satisfied with himself. \u201cHe will send something clever,\u201d he said, licking a paw and dragging it over an ear as if the job were finishing touches. \u201cHe is clever. It\u2019s the thing he knows about himself.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d Elias said. He looked at the afternoon. It did not look back in any meaningful way. He thought of the dot, of the card, of the ribbon. He thought of his mother\u2019s song. He put his hands on his knees and was not idle. He was waiting the way bakers wait: by doing something with flour.\n\nVellum, in the room below the school where the maps had learned to be not countries, took up a fresh sheet and made it into a shape like a boat because he had forgotten to do that for thirty years and sometimes forgetting and remembering are different sorts of spells. He pushed the paper boat across the surface of his soup and thought of a river that would have been a friend if he had not told it he was smarter than it. He pushed the boat under. He watched it sink. He smiled a very small smile that had no malice in it and so died as it left his mouth.\n\nAndover breathed in and out and gathered its own smell round itself like a shawl. Someone somewhere called a cat in and the cat came and then went back out because that is what cats do when called. The water meadows were a breath away from letting mist stand up and show its bones. The green went dull and then lit again with a boy\u2019s torch that should not have been out and was. Elias took up his broom because some spells you have to make again and again or the world forgets and then where are you. He swept his step because it was his step. He did not put numbers on the broom. He did not let anyone else. He thought, without argument, that there would be a morning when he would, for a little, not be able to end any sentence, but he was not going to give that morning this day\u2019s light. He went inside when the dark said so in a voice that was not a pamphlet. He shut the door because he had a door. He put the kettle on again because kettles are how you mark distance between the worst of a man\u2019s words and the best of what you can do about them. He sat. He stood. He kept both hands. He did not glow. He prepared.",

                              "content": "Saturday\u2019s second breath brought things in their Sunday clothes, which was to say they concealed themselves as virtue. The first boy came up the lane with his cap at an angle that made old women say things about the cut of his mother\u2019s tongue, and he had a sheaf of small papers tied neat with twine. There was nothing written on them. They carried a smell like boiled milk left to catch a skin. He put them into people\u2019s hands with his head respectfully bent as if he were doffing it without the bother, and each paper had a pin like a thorn stuck through one corner so that you could put it on a sleeve. The title, if you held it to the light and let your eyes go strange, was Apology. Under it, there were no words at all.\n\nThey worked like sacks. Mrs. Hardesty took one and a small hollowness came loose in her mouth so that when the girl who swept her step every Thursday came late and knocked a tray of feet-first rabbits with her elbow and made a mess of sawdust and ears, Mrs. Hardesty went to say the word she had always used as a hinge\u2014sorry\u2014and found that the hinge had been prised up and hidden under the floorboard. She stood with her hands on her hips and said, hearing herself as if someone else had set her to it, I suppose. She disliked the sound so much she nearly paid the girl double to wash it out. The girl, who had her own blank pinned to her jumper, stared at Mrs. Hardesty as if a sovereign had rolled under the counter and no one had it in them to kneel.\n\nMagdalene Plum took one from the boy because she never refused to take what arrived in her hand; she liked to look at wickedness where it could see her looking. She pricked her finger on the pin and refused to be taught by that either. She turned the paper. She held it to the window. She laid it on her press as a dare and the press\u2014in whose metal had been hammered a dozen sermons by men whose daughters had grown up and grown old within the smell of it\u2014refused to act as midwife. \u201cHmph,\u201d Magdalene said. She wrapped the blank like bread in an old page of the Hampshire Chronicle that had reported nothing bloodier than a harvest and sent it with a boy to Elias.\n\nHe was on his knees under Mrs. Troon\u2019s table at the time, extracting a splinter that had been working up through the wood toward the soft underside of the baby. He extricated things with his voice when he could, but splinters liked a knife if you respected the fiber and the grain. He came out dusty and pleased with the chair leg, and took the package without ceremony, and the blank slid out and made the smallest noise like a little breath of contentment, as if at last it had found someone who would be a good host.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t pin it,\u201d Quill said immediately, all hackles in his voice if not his fur. \u201cDon\u2019t put it anywhere it can learn the shape of your arm.\u201d\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d Elias murmured. He touched the corner of the page with one knuckle. The nothing in it tried to come up his hand and grease his palm and he said, very quietly, as you would to an overeager dog: \u201cNo.\u201d He smelled the trick of it: the way it would sit on a sleeve all morning and then, when a man dropped an egg in the yard and a neighbor said, ah, and not unkindly, it would suck the apology out of his mouth and replace it with a bit of furniture dressed as a sentence. An apology was a use. This was an ornament, the sort a rich woman wears to church and takes off before the potatoes are peeled. \u201cClever,\u201d he said, because it was; Vellum had found the place where the town gave itself back to itself most easily and set a hand on it.\n\nBy midmorning there were two more contrivances. A man with a face like a knitting mistake brought round little mirrors with rough tin edging and a slip of paper in each that read with printed courtesy For Your Self-Reflection from A Friend. If you held a mirror up you could not see your nose straight for the words they had pressed behind the silver, and if you looked long enough the edge of your mouth took on the shape of the word that lay closest, which made men look cruel when they were tired and women look tired when they were trying to be cruel. Children took them by the dozen because children take shining things; Hester took one and put it in her pocket and later hung it facing the wall with a sock over it and told it, \u201cNot until you behave.\u201d\n\nAnd a woman I will not name because she had once refused a half-penny from a boy who had tried to pay for his mother\u2019s button with it came up the High Street ringing a small clean handbell and selling cards with lines on them and one word in tidy copperplate at the top: Regret. \u201cYou fill in your own,\u201d she told Magdalene, who frowned as if the word regret should not have let itself be put on a string and dragged about. \u201cThen it\u2019s real. Then everyone sees and knows you have been honest enough to be wrong.\u201d Nothing in her voice suggested she had thought any of this by herself. She had a look to her as though Vellum had pressed her flat and written on her and when he lifted his hand she had sprung back up with his letters ghosting under her skin.\n\nElias took the mirror, and the blank, and the regret, and laid them in a row on his table with the ribbon beyond them like a line he did not mean them to cross. He said nothing to them because there is a kind of rudeness that encourages the worst sort of houseguest and he had had lodgers enough in his time. He went and knocked on Magdalene\u2019s lintel so that she would have the pleasure of frowning at him in the doorway and then telling him he knew better. \u201cHe is trying to replace breath with paper,\u201d he told her when she had finished. \u201cHe has understood we have a word for We are sorry and we give it away to one another and it comes back and it is not the poorer for it. He has made it a thing you wear when you remember.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen take their pins,\u201d Magdalene said, savage. She cut a piece of brown wrap from the roll with a movement like a woman slicing a loaf, and printed with small brutality down the middle of it: lend, mend, carry, walk, brew, wash, spare. \u201cYou have taught them to write butter and soap. Teach them to write the doing words. Put these in their kitchens. Hang them on the line and let the verbs learn the shape of wind.\u201d She looked at him without love and with all the respect she had. \u201cDo not make me say please,\u201d she added. \u201cIf this is to be the language of the day, I will not be poor in it.\u201d\n\nHe left Magdalene\u2019s with a stack under his arm and the press\u2019s heat still under his palms. On the green, he gave the verbs away as if he were tossing seed into a fallow field and seeing already the rough hair of shoots coming up. Women took them and smiled with their mouths, which said everything about what men had been doing to their mouths all morning. Men took them and tucked them into hats because hats remember things that heads forget. Children ran with them held high and the words flapped and learned to fly and were not upset when they fell; verbs are not like that.\n\nQuill carried string again in his teeth and looked as if the task were beneath him and entirely pleasing at once. \u201cHe will hate this,\u201d the cat said around the knot, mouth full of a helpfulness he could not forbear. \u201cNot because it is clever. Because it is plain. He can\u2019t climb plain.\u201d\n\n\u201cI should like a sentence he cannot climb,\u201d Elias said. He raised his voice exactly as much as he needed to be heard by those near enough to want to hear and not a breath more. \u201cHang them over where water runs,\u201d he called. \u201cSinks that don\u2019t keep their tempers. Pumps. By the well. And say the words when you use them. Not to make a spell. To listen to whether they have changed shape in your mouth.\u201d\n\nThe hush came at two o\u2019clock. It came like snow in a dream: suddenly, totally, and with a ridiculous gentleness that made you forget it had weight. Elias was leaning on the pump handle on the green, showing a boy where it stuck in the downstroke, when the silence dropped and muffled them and left their breath singing under their skin like kettles on an invisible hob. The boy\u2019s mouth opened for a word he always said when he wanted the handle pulled harder and all that came out was a bit of air shaped like a letter with nothing after it. Elias felt his own tongue slip back from certain syllables as if they had become hot and his mouth did not care to be burned. He tried the old household words\u2014yes, no, please, thank you\u2014and found he had them, poor but his. Sorry, though, would not be caught; it scooted to the back of his throat like a mouse who had been a mouse a while and meant to go on.\n\nPeople stood where they were and went still, not with the stillness of prayer but with the stillness of a man who suddenly cannot call his child. Hester did not notice. Hester set her jaw against a thing and it always gave. She laughed at the hush because it had forgotten to take laughter too, and then stopped because Mrs. Hardesty had put both hands to her cheeks and had turned the kind of color that makes a person one sort of liar or another. The mirror-seller turned his mirrors over and over as if they might give him back a sound if he shook them. The apology sheets quivered like a flock catching a draft and then lay flat, very pleased with themselves in a way that made Quill want, for the first time in his elegant life, to shred something without leaving it neat in the end.\n\nElias did the one thing he was always certain of in a minute when he had nothing else to be certain of. He pumped. The pump was an old one and grudged the first pull in any weather and sulked if the weather had changed without telling it. He put his back under the work. He used not strength but steadiness. Water came up like a thing remembering itself; it shouldered into the spout with a growl like a wakeful stomach and fell. He had hung one of Magdalene\u2019s lists of verbs under the bracket just an hour before and now the water ran a finger along the word brew and made it shine, and along the word wash and set a wet edge on it, and along spare and made it look foolish for a second and then grand. He set the cup under, the communal one that tasted faintly of iron and of every mouth that had found itself at the green with its own cup left in the sink, and he drank. He swallowed with deliberation as if the water might be something else if not supervised. He put the cup in Hester\u2019s hands and made the same face at her he would make over any child dawdling with cold porridge.\n\nShe drank. She dabbed at her lip with her knuckle. She said the word impossible for a girl of nine that lives in the hands and then blushed because it came out with a roundness that made an impossible thing soft. \u201cSay please,\u201d Elias told the boy who had wanted the handle pulled, and the boy thought for one courageous second the pumpman had gone mad and then he said it, with a wobble, and his mouth cried out in relief to discover he still had that door. The sorry would come back later; it was not the sort to be fetched with a bucket.\n\nAround them the hush pushed and pressed and found stubbornness in places where it expected compliance. At Magdalene\u2019s, the press went on making the small soft sound it makes when a woman is doing work no one knows about, and the hush could not find a way to get into the oil of that. In the church, Elijah Grieves set his hands on the rope and spoke into his fists the names of his sons and the bell heard and answered and the names did not stick to the clapper but went up and were set to ring and came down again and became bread in Elijah\u2019s mouth when he had been skipping lunches to finish a coffin in time. In Mrs. Troon\u2019s kitchen, where the apology sheet had been pinned above the baby\u2019s cot with too much pride, the baby took his own hand, the left one, and put the knuckles into his mouth and chewed on his fingers and made the sound babies make before they learn any words and it was such a sound that the hush, which had no idea what to do with the untidy, took another step back.\n\nIt would have held, might have held, if Vellum had been content with a single cleverness. He had sent the hush and thought to watch the town press its face to it and leave a shape there and had gone away to map the next cruelty in thin blue pencil and wonder whether there was an economy in saving certain vowels for a storm. But he was not that sort. He could not resist improving a plan. He sent footnotes.\n\nThey fell like moths. They were small slips with glue on the back so old-fashioned women smiled and thought of ration books, and they landed on people\u2019s sleeves and hats and cheeks and carried a word in tiny, neat type: Actually. You could not see it without making yourself into a person who peers. But peering is a habit in towns and so the footnotes stuck and when a woman began to speak about the price of sugar she heard in the back of her head a small voice she would have cached as merely mean, and it said actually and then told her she had not got it quite right, and she paused, and in that pause there is where you can pour poison or tea depending on what country you live in.\n\nElias felt one land on his neck like a fly that had put on its Sunday suit. He slapped it as he had not slapped a thing since he was twelve. It stuck to his palm, and he held it out to Quill, and the cat read it with a narrowed eye. \u201cThis,\u201d the cat said, \u201cis an insect with footnotes attached.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I peel it off in the wrong direction it will tell my skin I have misremembered my own name,\u201d Elias said. He took the edge with two fingernails and lifted. It clung. He lifted more. It did what insinuations do when forced into daylight; it became ridiculous. He held the actually up by its tiny corner and it swayed in an unseen breeze like laundry that has no right to be pretty and yet is. He stuck it to the pump handle. \u201cNot today,\u201d he told it, and meant the habit and the whole damp country the habit lives in.\n\nThe boy with the apology takes\u2014the same boy, you could see him under the shape this job had pressed him to wear\u2014stood with his cap in his hands and tears climbing his throat. \u201cHe said I\u2019d be paid if I didn\u2019t talk,\u201d he muttered, because there are men who put silence on boys like a coat and then wonder why they grow with their arms held oddly. \u201cHe said to pin them as high as I could reach. That makes it work better.\u201d\n\nElias reached out and took his cap and put it back on his head with the care you\u2019d use to position a starling. \u201cThank you for telling me,\u201d he said, and it came out raw because the hush had tried to take thank you and not quite succeeded. \u201cTake off the pins you can reach. He will not end you for it. If he tries, tell him we don\u2019t allow endings on a Saturday.\u201d He gave the boy a list with brew on it and a string. He gave him the cup. He did not give him a word to wear. The boy took the string and it steadied him as if he had been given a pole for a river crossing.\n\nBy evening, the clevernesses had soured in Vellum\u2019s mouth. The hush had settled where hushed people live\u2014under the backs of throats and behind doors men close when a song starts that was not theirs\u2014and the footnotes had stuck to church pews and the underside of crockery and learned nothing. People put flowers over numbers and found they had invented a holiday without meaning to. The mirrors had begun to collect a slick of breath which is the most democratic medium in which to write. With a rag that never got quite clean, Mrs. Coppin wiped I am very tired of this off a glass and felt better in her elbows because the truth had somewhere to be that did not bump her in the night.\n\nQuill slept badly when he slept at all. The liar he had swallowed the day before turned in him as if letters had bones. He lay very still and then shook as if he were dreaming water at the roots of his fur. Elias sat beside him and hated him fiercely for being vulnerable and loved him with a patience he did not give to himself. He dripped chamomile on his tongue and the cat licked as if he had been robbed of the right to be dignified and would reclaim it later with interest. At one point, near dawn, Quill woke enough to say, voice not his and entirely his, \u201cYou must stop him sending the kind that make people polite. The cruel kind a person will argue with. The polite kind builds rooms in them.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d Elias said. He did know. It had been in the little black mouth of the period when he had put it in his pocket, the old instruction of the old law: beware the kindness that reads as charity and tastes of rank. He listened to the town breathing. It was falling into the habit of keeping its own noise, the good noise of spoons, pipe smoke, the bang of a cupboard that somebody in a hurry promised not to do again and would do again and be forgiven because a house without a bang is dead. He took the mirror from the shelf and turned it face down, not because it had done anything that day but because it had looked like it might. He looked at the ribbon on the tin and the soldier on the shelf and touched both without thinking which one first and then noticed, with a dark sort of humor, that it mattered to him and to nobody else.\n\nAt midmorning a thin letter pushed itself under his door like a rat ashamed to be seen but too hungry not to beg. It smelled of paste and the particular grief of rooms with coal without fire. Elias opened it with his thumbnail because knives have their dignity and he would not use one on an envelope that did not deserve it. The handwriting was unexpectedly cramped. Vellum had not learned to look like he had been to school. The letter said three things before it ran aground. It said: I retract. It said: The child by the river would have gone in if I had not. It said: You think because you make your town into a bowl you will keep soup from the floor, but I know the weakness of bowls.\n\nElias folded it. He put it on the table. He did not show it to Quill because the cat had hate for only certain sorts of paper and he did not mean to season the others. He took up Magdalene\u2019s verbs. He thought about bowls. He thought about the way bowls break and are mended with a line of tin so fine the eye likes the scar. He thought about his mother\u2019s ribbon and the way she had tied one end off round a leg and made a cradle of tight cloth for for drying wet boots so they did not warp. He went to the pump.\n\nAt the pump he met not the town but time. Elijah was there, his hair like a thatch the wind had tried to lift and failed because it had been laid with love. Mr. Crisp, who sharpened knives and opinions and sometimes did both too finely. Mrs. Hardesty with both hands scrubbed clean because she was afraid of what her hands might otherwise write. Hester with her pocket weighed down by a mirror and a frog memory and a stolen honesty. And Magdalene with ink on her knuckles as if she had been wagering with a raven and meant to win without letting it have the satisfaction of taking her bright things.\n\n\u201cWe will sing,\u201d Elias said.\n\nHester groaned in anticipation and delight because she saw herself on the point of making a racket with permission. Mr. Crisp began to disapprove by habit. Magdalene looked him in the eye and the disapproval turned into a convenient cough. Elijah set his feet apart like a man making space in himself for a second gear. Mrs. Hardesty had that look people get when they don\u2019t have it in them and are going to anyway.\n\n\u201cNot hymns,\u201d Elias said, because he knew his town. \u201cWe will do the one my mother sang when the wash water goes soapy. We will do the one the men learned when the mill broke and they had to carry their own jaws. We will do the one you only sing when there is something on the floor you can\u2019t look at and you will look at it later but first you must not fall.\u201d He spoke the words forward, not up, and they landed as if the green had put out its palm. \u201cYou know them,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery house knows them.\u201d\n\nThey began badly, which is always a mercy. Hester came in with too much light. Elijah\u2019s low note had a wobble that sounded like a bell getting its legs. Mrs. Hardesty doled out the beat as if it were a ration. Magdalene\u2019s voice was exactly true and too grieved to be beautiful, which made it something else entirely. Quill, who could sing when he wished to, lay with one paw over his nose and hummed in a dignified way because he despised singing that did not yet know what it was about. The pump took the measure and sang about iron. The list of verbs, wet now and gone wavy like hair, spoke its little lines into the falls. The hush came forward to listen. It tried to sit in the laps of the people on the green. It tried to spread itself under them like a blanket and make them mistake that weight for safety. But singing is what breath does when it refuses to be contained, and the hush, which is a liar in a lace cap, hates nothing so much as breath that will go on making itself heard even in a room with the curtains drawn.\n\nThey sang Noon Pot on, and Pick Up, and Put Down, and Sparrows Are Free to Come In and Out, which last is exactly what it sounds like and not a metaphor at all; a ritual for opening the kitchen window when a thing with wings is in the room and the adrenaline makes you stupid. They sang the silly one about the eel in the jar you can\u2019t get back out without breaking the jar and how sometimes the right thing is to break the jar. They sang and the apologies peeled themselves off sleeves as if they worried they would spoil their finery where there was sweat. They sang and the blossoms of footnotes curled at the edges where tea steam got at them and the glue failed and fell in little guilty flakes. They sang and they found sorry again, not because you can sing it back like a name but because the muscle knew the shape of the word when it was used properly and allowed it. People said it and it was ugly and useful and made space where shame had been pretending to be furniture.\n\nVellum heard them, you may be sure. The school\u2019s lower room snarled its damp and still could not muffle the sound of breath being used for something besides apology. He stood with his hands on the press and his cheekbones sharp because he did not eat when he was working and he was always working, and he smiled a schoolmaster\u2019s smile without boys. \u201cYou think this makes you a village,\u201d he said aloud to the iron, because he liked to win his arguments in a room where no one would say he was wrong. \u201cYou think this makes you small enough to avoid the larger ideas.\u201d He ran his thumb over a block that had said faithfully for fifty years at the bottom of invoices and came away with a black mark he would not notice until it had dried and become a bruise people would take for a wound and would not be wrong. \u201cVery well,\u201d he said, to the press, to the part of himself that had never been taught to sing. \u201cLet us see if they fancy a map.\u201d\n\nQuill slept by inches and woke by inches and in the waking had no patience for poetry. \u201cHe will take the names off the fields,\u201d he said, the same way you would say a thing about weather when your bones tell you about it before the sky. \u201cIf the fields don\u2019t have names they go shabby and let anyone in. He will make One, Two, Three, and nobody will know where Daniel\u2019s Oat and Margaret\u2019s Drop and The Square With The Hole In It are. People will say turn left at One and never get home.\u201d\n\nElias put the cup into the cat\u2019s offended mouth. \u201cDrink,\u201d he said. He turned over the bone disk that hung on the wall by the peg\u2014a thing that had been a button and become a token and was now, in its quieter life, both\u2014and read the names he had scratched there in a boy\u2019s hand with a nail the day he had first been given tea at Magdalene\u2019s: Daniel\u2019s Oat. Margaret\u2019s Drop. The Square With The Hole In It. The Cop, which everyone called that and no one knew why. He felt his name for them press back as if a child had put his palm against his in a game. He thought about the ache under his shoulder, which had moved again, west this time, into the part of him that always insisted he could carry more than he ought. He thought about a man downstairs in a school who believed in lines and thought they should be straight. He tied his scarf and did not bother to get the ends even. \u201cCome on,\u201d he said to Quill, to Hester perched on the step like a bird in possession of a house, to himself. \u201cWe\u2019re walking the fields.\u201d\n\nThey took paths whose ownership was a quarrel in three counties and a religion in two cottages, and Elias put his hand on every stile. He listened on the top of the wooden steps for whether the field on the far side said its name back to him and when it did not he said it to the air and nailed it there without nails. In Daniel\u2019s Oat, there was a plan under the ground like a frost pattern on glass: long lines and right angles and little squares numbered with a drafting-minded malice. He stood with his feet in the requisite furrow and told the plan it could have his boots but not the shape of the man inside them. He stamped. The pattern rattled and went you do not understand the economy of this, Elias, and he said yes, I do, it\u2019s called smaller wages and larger secrets, and the frost crawled away to find a muddy puddle to look noble in.\n\nThey crossed into Margaret\u2019s Drop, where the ground had a habit of pitching you slightly toward the ditch no matter how sober you were, and he said the name and felt the field find the weight of it again. Hester ran ahead and took a candy from her pocket and broke it in two and then in two again and if you worry about such things you will be pleased to know she accounted for the fractions out loud as if there were a mathematical ghost in the grass who could be soothed by sweet and sums. Quill leaped from post to post with a care for mud princely and absurd, then dropped into the ruts like a common cat and came out with one paw black and his dignity badly dinged and licked it until the field, which had been considering giving up and becoming a lawn, remembered that it liked beasts.\n\nBy the time the light was gold and unambitious, they had walked the Square With The Hole In It and the Cop and two whose names Elias had not scratched on his button but could find with his soles: One With Three Stone Teeth, and The Afterthought. In three of them were staked small neat signs with numbers: Field 4. Lot 2. Parcel 7. This was the cleverness: the numbers had been pressed in with a traveling stamp until the post itself had learned them, an ache in the grain. Elias took off his scarf and wrapped it round the first post and leaned a moment until he felt the number give a little, like a stiff knee when you put your hand under the back of it and say, come on then, bend. He took the second post in his arms and felt ridiculous and refused to mind. He put his forehead to the third and told it a joke about a plough and a priest and the field did not laugh but the post eased and that was enough.\n\nOn their way home, with the sky taking its coins back and the hedges pretending they had never had faces, they passed under the school\u2019s windows. In one of them, just visible if you were the sort who looked, a paper hung with a drawing on it so elegant in its cruelty it made Magdalene catch her breath in her kitchen and drop a spoon she would not admit she loved. It was a map of Andover without names. It had the streets. It had the curve of the river and the mistakes the builders had made and never told anyone. It had the rooflines like a deck of cards laid wrong. It had no Margaret\u2019s, no Daniel\u2019s, no Mr. Crisp, no Hester, no Magdalene. At the bottom, in a hand that did not belong to printing and did not care, was written: There. Is that better.\n\nElias put his hand against the glass and felt the shape of a man\u2019s satisfaction on the other side like the heat of a kettle you\u2019ve set to boiling and forgotten until it sings. He did not break the window, not because he could not have but because he had not brought a broom. He said the names to the pane. The glass fogged. The map did not take them. It did not listen. It was, after all, not a thing but an idea about a thing. He lowered his hand. He looked at the sky, which had got on with its own business and was pulling its dark up over one knee like a girl with a ladder in her stocking. He stood until he came away cold.\n\nThat night the town dreamed of turning left at One and finding Hester\u2019s pocket mirror hung in a hedge to tell you which way was west and making a face at it because it would not get to be that sort of authority. Elias slept on his side with Quill between his chest and his bent knees, the cat a warm, earnestly purring comma. In the drawer with the spoons, a tiny amount of cat hair collected on the silver handles, which made Elias smile in his sleep without knowing why. The ribbon over the pamphlets held, and the pamphlets sulked and imagined a future in which they would be framed and taken out at bedtime to frighten adolescents and were disappointed without understanding they were being told their own ending.\n\nIn the morning there would be small spoils: Mr. Bobbin\u2019s violin would have learned a tune it had not known; Elijah Grieves would ring the bell a fraction late and not care; Mrs. Hardesty would hand a sausage to a child who had not asked and say That one is on the house and then be unable to stop herself from blushing and scolding to hide how right it felt; Magdalene would find the word lend under her thumb and it would make a small dent in her skin that lasted an hour and reminded her of a time when she had meant to be somebody else and had chosen instead to be exactly what she was and had not, for a single day since, regretted the economy of it. Vellum would draw a new line, straighter, and an old paper boat would give up pretending to float in a bowl that ought to have had soup in it and sink without drama. The dot in Elias\u2019s pocket would sit and sit and at some point he would take it out and set it on the table and it would look like dirt and he would laugh and Quill would consider the laugh and allow it.\n\nHe did not write, that night, the thing the letter had asked him to pretend had been written already. He did not retract anything that needed keeping. He put his finger on the list by the broom and wrote in his awful hand rest, and under it wrote rest again, and under it wrote sweep and then drew a line and wrote bread and then put the pencil down because it was only a pencil and men have gone astray with worse and better. He slept and in his sleep his mother came into the room that was a memory and told him not to point because it was rude, and he did, and she laughed, which is how boys survive their mothers\u2019 rules, and then he woke and the day began again in the way days do when you mean to get them right and can\u2019t but will keep trying because you have the words.",

Men shaved properly; women pinned their hair with the pins they kept for visitors. The bells moved Elijah Grieves the way the river moved a leaf\u2014by habit, by love, by something older than either\u2014and the first sound they made was almost right and then right because the town had decided to let it be. Elias woke before the bells. He lay still and listened to the house think about him. It had decided he was not a bad bargain. Quill, who had slept hard as a comma wedged between two clauses, stretched up the length of Elias\u2019s ribs and yawned in his face with a breath like chamomile and old sarcasm.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll have printed God by now,\u201d Quill remarked, as if the information could be taken or left without consequence. \u201cTiny and neat. He\u2019ll hand Him around on cards with a piece of string. Men will wear Him in their hats.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf He takes offense,\u201d Elias said, \u201cHe\u2019ll have to stand in line.\u201d He sat and put his feet on the floor and felt the ache that spoke east last night, west at dusk, declare itself a new compass point that existed only for this day: inwards, under the breastbone, where old promises rest. He dressed without thinking and came out odd and then even, which happens when the hands have known the day\u2019s shape and the mind has not caught up. On the back of the chair hung the scarf he had not straightened. He grinned at it for having chosen sides.\n\nThe vicar, who was only sometimes a man and more often a question with his collar on, knocked at Elias\u2019s door with an embarrassment he had not been born with. Elias admired men who had acquired embarrassments as you admire men who have acquired skills late by hard practice. \u201cElias,\u201d the vicar said, leaning in with his hat in both hands like a penitent, \u201cbefore you come\u2014if you do come\u2014there\u2019s a thing I should say. Someone\u2019s put a paper. On the pulpit. It has notes for my sermon I didn\u2019t write. I\u2019m not sure what I\u2019m supposed to do about it. They\u2019re proper notes. Footnotes. With little numbers.\u201d\n\n\u201cTake the numbers off,\u201d Elias said kindly. He did not mean from the speech; he meant from the man. He reached for the vicar\u2019s fingers, which had hymnal dust in the creases, and put a thumb into the seam of his hand and rubbed until the skin remembered itself as skin and not paper. \u201cIf the words on the slip ask you to say \u2018deliver us from discomfort\u2019 instead of \u2018deliver us from evil,\u2019 take it as a suggestion from a person who cannot tell one from the other. And under no circumstances let the notes tell people to sit through the bit they should stand for.\u201d\n\nThe vicar laughed unhappily. His laugh had a gap in it where a tooth had gone when he was twelve, running and not looking, and some part of him had never forgiven the lane. \u201cYou make it sound easy,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI make it sound plain,\u201d Elias returned. \u201cCome to my step when you are done and shake your hands out. The rope left numbers on them yesterday. We must not let prayers do the same. They have enough to answer for without arithmetic.\u201d\n\nThe church had put itself together with a stern prettiness that always made Elias think of girls being told to remember which fork. The memorial tablets along the nave had been polished to a better self and glowed. The whole place smelled of beeswax, starch, men\u2019s necks and women\u2019s patience. Elias went in at the back because cats do not love being made to choose between a cushion and a knee, and Quill had opinions about velvet. He trotted along the pew tops like a baron inspecting property and leaped to a beam where he could look pious without blasphemy.\n\nPeople filled the wooden pens by household habit rather than God\u2019s governance. Mrs. Hardesty balanced piety with her shop, head up as if to dare the Lord to mind her sausages. Mr. Bobbin had brought his fiddle in its case with him because he did not trust the house to leave it alone; he held it like a child he would have wanted without believing he deserved. Hester Stowe slid between her mother and Mrs. Troon with the baby and produced her stolen mirror, which she hung by its rough edge on the hook where hymn numbers should go and then covered with a handkerchief because even a vain thing may serve if humiliated into humility. Magdalene Plum sat with her hands folded like a woman whose palms have not been without ink for twenty years. She had washed them. The ink had considered and stayed.\n\nOn the pulpit lay the paper. It had a look that wanted to be official without the authority to be so, the way a boy in his father\u2019s hat looks like a jest unless you love him. The vicar glanced at it and put both hands on the edges as if to hold it to one side of the sermon as you would a naughty child in a crowd. He began with the words no one remembered having decided were the right ones to begin with, and the hush, which had been crouched in the rafters peering down into everyone\u2019s throats, slid itself to the edge to listen.\n\nThe footnotes waited. They were printed in such a respectful type that if you squinted you might be moved to admire the authority even as it began its insults. At the bottom of the page a number 1 asked him to add \u2018for those of us who do not dabble\u2019 after the prayer for those who go out into the town to serve. A small 2 wanted him to replace the word wicked with wayward. Number 3 was giddy with its own cleverness; it had a Latin phrase that meant nothing in Latin and was meant to make the men feel that their tongues had chosen a side. The vicar cleared his throat and chose to be poor in Latin that day. He used wicked and meant it. He came to the prayer for the town and its water, and the hush leaned very hard and tried to keep him from saying river, and he took a breath and said Anton with his mouth open as if he were asking a question and the bell above heard and answered it.\n\nElias felt the sting of something sly in the beam. He lifted his face. Along the memorial tablets, the big ones for men who had made the town applaud them and the little ones for boys who had not done themselves the good or harm of living long, there ran a faint shadow like thin smoke. It was not smoke. It was an eraser in a good suit. It took the tiny raised serif off Elijah Grieves\u2019s dead son\u2019s name and made it look misspelled, then thought better and put a number beside it as if the boy had been a note to the line. On the tablet to Mrs. Bell\u2019s mother, who had delivered half of Andover and had died in a chair by the fire with her apron on because she had not meant to go yet, the word mother flickered and wanted to be matron, and then midwife, and then attendant, and then nothing, only a space where a woman might stand unnoticed all her life and the town would only think to praise the floor once it had gone.\n\nElias moved into the aisle without asking the aisle\u2019s leave. The vicar faltered and then did not because the thing in his hands felt the weight of a man walking with intent and did not wish to be laughed at for its hollowness. Elias laid his palm on the bottom right of Mrs. Bell\u2019s mother\u2019s brass and felt the shape of the name that was not up but under. He had no right to be here without being family. He was family by use. He said the woman\u2019s name under his breath and under his breath there was the ribbon round a hair and the way she had said Now, girl, breathe, which is the way men should have been taught to enter rooms all their lives. The brass warmed under his hand. It took patience to coax good truth from metal; metal has been told what to be for so long it forgets it can ring when it is asked correctly. He did not press. He waited. Under his fingers, the faint, fidgeting desire to be official gave up, and the word mother deepened its groove.\n\nQuill, up on his beam, clawed at a thin nothing that had caught on one of his whiskers. He pinned it to the wood and read it with distaste. \u201cErrata,\u201d he said under his breath, and a boy three rows back who had come because his mother had insisted and meant to count how many nails were in the pew in front of him tasted the word and had to spit into his handkerchief because his mouth was not made to carry such sourness with silence.\n\nIt moved fast when you watched where it tried to be slow. On the memorial for Elijah\u2019s son, the number softened, then ran. Elias smudged it with his thumb deliberately and put a dot where it had been without writing it and it sat, prim as an aunt expecting cake, and made the place where the mischief had been feel finished in a way that nothing nasty can stand. He went as a man goes along benches when he must leave in a hurry, touching, not stopping. He put a hand on the stone for the man who had funded the school and taken the money back and died anyway and said, not kindly, not unkindly, \u201cYour wife is not short for your achievement.\u201d The stone did not argue; it did not, in fairness, have a leg to stand on.\n\nWhen the prayer was done and the footnotes had sulked themselves into quiet ink, the vicar shut the book. He saw Elias in the aisle and looked briefly like a man offered a bowl just when his hands have learned to carry three plates. He made a face that warned the footnotes he might collect offerings with his head up and the footnotes whispered in affront about proper liceity and collapsed into their own type. The hymn after, an innocuous one about wheat, went like it always does in towns where people have seen famine from the wrong end: tentative, then full, then soft at the last line where the simile comes and makes you cry in front of your neighbors if you\u2019re not careful. The hush tried to sing and choked on its own breath. It took itself away to sulk in the vestry. The footnotes tried to get people\u2019s attention in the lane and no one read them because dinners had been put on and timing is a magic as good as any.\n\nAs they came out into the sharp midday, Elijah Grieves put both hands into Elias\u2019s and made the face of a man who has dropped a weight of steel and been handed a bag of flour in its place. \u201cHe had rounded my boy off,\u201d he said. \u201cThought to make him cleaner by taking off what his letters had. Thank you.\u201d His gratitude had no bow on it. It was meat. Elias took it and swallowed and did not think of Vellum\u2019s soup.\n\nOn the path, the vicar shook his hands as instructed and made a little breath like a boy told well done for something he did not know he had done and wanted to claim with both fists. \u201cThere was a note,\u201d he said, not ashamed. \u201cAt the bottom of the page, after If there are any who are to be present in the holy estate of matrimony. It said, instead of Speak now or forever hold your peace, it suggested the phrase Speak now or apply at the office. I may have said something rude under my breath. God will forgive me.\u201d He looked sideways the way men do before they say a thing they are afraid makes them sound weak. \u201cIf he writes my mother on a card,\u201d he added, \u201cI shall not read the card aloud. Is that permitted.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is required,\u201d Elias said. \u201cYou must not let a stranger put your mother where everyone can see her for the first time.\u201d He had to leave then because his chest had been pierced by a fool with thin ink who could not have known where to aim; the word mother had laid itself against his ribs with a weight like wet wool.\n\nBack on his step he found a boy had been. The boy had hands that shook as if he had made a choice against supervision. He had left a thing that did not look like Vellum\u2019s at all. It had been written in a crabbed hand on a scrap cut ragged with a table knife. It said Sorry I helped and under it, in a handwriting older than his, was written I know. Elias put his hand on his table. It was steady enough. He put the scrap under the ribbon as if he were teaching two words to lie down together and not mate. Quill leaped up beside it and looked away because when cats grant privacy to paper, men should do the same.\n\nErrata slips came heavy as flies after that, on plates, on tins, in pockets. Mrs. Hardesty reached into her apron and found one that said, in the small voice that always knows best, butcheress and she snarled and threw it in the fat and the fat popped as if you had insulted a woman who had been very good this morning and did not deserve it. Mamie Coppin lifted her teapot and discovered the word mean where steam should be and she put in a bay leaf and told the cleverness to steep, and it became the color of an old bruise and swam to the top and she skimmed it off and sprinkled it on the geranium, which surprised everyone by surviving.\n\nThe worst of it came not to a woman used to argument and knives, nor to a man who had practiced saying no and yes in public, but to Mrs. Bell, the midwife. She met Elias on the corner by the shop with a bundle of paper in her apron and her face arranged very neatly, which is what grief does when it has a job. \u201cHe has a list,\u201d she said without preface. \u201cNot my list. I keep the names of babies. It makes their first morning heavier so they don\u2019t blow away. He has cut mine up and put mine on cards with spaces where his pen has not been and he has made a binder. He will bring it as a gift when a woman goes hard in her labor. He thinks he is being modern.\u201d\n\nElias took the bundle from her without the ceremony his hands wanted because ceremony would have put a lace cap on madness. He sat on the stoop of the abandoned shop that had never kept a grocer long because it liked to be empty and spread the spoiled names on his knees like a fortune-teller with cards she does not trust. The paper had not been torn; it had been clipped with a precision that meant to be flattering and failed. The names had been put into a new order. Not order by the day and the evening and the two a.m. that had required Mrs. Bell to put on her boots and go out in a nightgown and her shawl. This order was by weight and color and whether the father had signed. Numbers had crept up the margins like damp. In a neat hand that had pleased Magdalene once on an invoice a year ago and displeased her now by association was written Above Average, and after it a list of boys; Below Average, and after it a list that had girls in it like thunder.\n\nMrs. Bell breathed as women do when they have been told to be polite in other people\u2019s tragedy and have decided they would be and still mean to kill, later, with a kindness. \u201cIf I go and cut his paper up,\u201d she said, \u201cit will make another boy that boy and he will become the sort who makes lists. I would rather break his thumb.\u201d\n\n\u201cStrings first,\u201d Elias said. He stacked the cleverness and pulled the long loop of hair-ribbon from his pocket. It would not be enough; ribbons never are. He had a spool of twine in his bag and felt for it without looking, a man who always knows where his own thread is. He tied the cards back into bundles where the names had belonged. He did not do it well. He did it twice and then again and the third time the knot sat properly and sulked. \u201cKeep yours in a box under your bed,\u201d he told Mrs. Bell. \u201cPut a kettle on top. If a man with a binder comes, we will rearrange his fingers into a new order.\u201d\n\nMrs. Bell laughed in the soundless way that means a woman has decided not to let crying take up space it cannot pay for. \u201cI will tell her to breathe,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I will tell her that knowing the word under the word is the only thing that makes a birth go right.\u201d She touched Elias\u2019s sleeve. It was not gratitude. It was exactly this: a midwife leaving some truth she could not fit in her pockets on a man\u2019s arm because she had to go and could not take it with her.\n\nBy midafternoon, the list-making had turned to maps again. The signs staked in the fields had multiplied in the night like a complaint that catches; a new one stood at the gap to the path where boys went to avoid being seen going to smoke. FIELD 1. PARCEL 5. The words sat neat on metal and made the hedge look guilty for having grown with its own shape instead of any square. Hester had her hands in her pockets and a pebble in her mouth to keep from saying things the vicar would borrow and put in a sermon and not return. \u201cHe\u2019s making a game,\u201d she said, her eyes hot because injustice made her cry not like a girl, like Hester. \u201cHe thinks we\u2019ll forget our names and be grateful when he gives us numbers to pin to them as if they were clean shirts.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will make him play something stupid,\u201d Elias said. He had a child\u2019s comfort in the foolish. \u201cHopscotch,\u201d he added, because remembrance has squares in it, too, and a thrown stone and a rule about stepping where you shouldn\u2019t. He chalked nine boxes on the green where chalk had lately been idolatrous and not been liked for it, and the action pleased him for its insolence. In the first he put the word here. In the second, the word now. In the third, the word bread. In the fourth and fifth, he put two small drawings like those Hester made when she was meant to be following sums; one of a cat, haughty as a mayor, one of a bell. In the sixth, he left it empty because not everything needs to be said to be counted. In the seventh and eighth he put the words speak and listen. In the ninth he wrote stay.\n\nHester watched him as if gathering new techniques for warfare to be employed at kitchen tables when you are too short to be impressive. \u201cYou\u2019ve made a game out of words,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve made words into a game,\u201d he corrected. \u201cJump.\u201d She jumped, and the stone he had set to throw\u2014a small, smooth thing you would have kept in your pocket after finding it for years\u2014landed on listen and obliged her to skip with her mouth shut, which nearly killed her and made her grin as if she had invented discipline. The green liked it. The green always liked it when games were played with fairness and the right amount of cheating and no bets that meant dusk took more than the afternoon had given.\n\nVellum, meanwhile, sat in the below-room with the window that made the light look like water trying to be useful in a bucket and drew a line he thought might please someone he had never met and never would. He had not slept. He did not look like a man who had not slept. He looked like a word that had been kept out of a sentence and would not forgive the omission. The crow, which was not a bird but had the habit of one the way a door has the habit of opening, sat on the press and made small motions with its beak as if pins were a delicacy and it had acquired a taste for them at someone else\u2019s expense. Vellum wrote in the margin of the map the words: it will be easier, then struck out easier and wrote better and then struck out better and wrote necessary and did not notice that his hand shook because there are tremblings that have nothing to do with cold.\n\nWhen he sent the next thing, he was too clever by half. He had discovered an old trick: errata not in the present but in the past. He slid thin slips into the parish register where the births were and the deaths and the little line that read baptised and the long line that read illegitimate which had been put there by a man fifty years ago who could not bear to have his theology contradicted by biology and so wrote it down and felt tidy. The slips were so convincing that if you did not know a thing you would swallow them whole and not know it; they did not look like additions, they looked like just the way it had been all along. Mr. Bobbin, who had been told all his life he had hands for iron and never for catgut, went to the book and found a note beneath his baptism written in a small hand and a smaller voice: not musical. It made his wrists cold. Mrs. Hardesty found that her mother\u2019s death had been attributed to intemperance when it had been a fever as ordinary and as deadly as any and she swore aloud in the church because there are decencies and then there are decencies.\n\nElias went through the side door with Quill in his bag because not even God was going to keep him out with ink in the rafters. The clerk had the sort of scar between his eyebrows that had been a wrinkle once and then hardened into proof he had tried to use his face to think for too long. He looked at Elias as if to say this is not your province. Elias laid his hand on the book as if it were a cat. He did not flip past the flyleaf, which had its own ideas about being valuable. He turned pages until he came to his own mother\u2019s name and he stopped because the book knew how to make him do that. He had not done this before. He had not let anyone too tidy put their finger near it. He read the line. He read the neat hand that was not the vicar\u2019s of the time and not any hand he knew and he read the small word at the edge in the new ink and the word said away and it had not been written by God.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Elias told it. He did not speak to the book. He spoke to the paper put on the paper. He touched his pocket where the period had sat all morning and had decided to live there the way some animals decide on a particular rock. He lifted it out and set it at the edge of the page, not on the terrible word, near it, like a bowl set near a drunk man, ready. \u201cYou have put an end where there was a gap,\u201d he said softly. \u201cI will not allow that.\u201d He slid the dot over the away, and it did not smear; it sat and stared at the additive until it looked like a stranger in a kitchen at night. The extra letters, which had thought to be indispensable as a teaspoon, found they had only been the gleam on one. They went flat. He moved the dot back and left the place clean and raw as it had always been. \u201cI know what away means,\u201d he said to no one and to everyone. \u201cIt does not mean gone.\u201d\n\nThe clerk, who had not the habit of weeping because his father had told him it was a thing men paid women to do, wiped his nose with his sleeve and let himself feel as if he had found a coin in a pocket he had sewed up himself. \u201cI didn\u2019t know one could argue with these,\u201d he admitted, astonished to hear his voice casual as bread in his own mouth.\n\n\u201cYou can,\u201d Elias said. \u201cThey lie if you don\u2019t.\u201d He took the pen, because you are allowed to take a pen if your fingers know how to hold a child by the ankle and check for splinters, and wrote in the margin in his poor hand very small the words checked, and under them, in smaller, the truth as a thing held between two people and not printed. He did not make a sermon of it. He made a note to himself with a witness. He laid the ribbon he had been allowed across the page the way a woman lays a washcloth on a fevered head. The paper sighed without rustle. It is embarrassing, sometimes, to be saved.\n\nWhen he came out into the yard, he spoke to the town because he would have had to go home otherwise and sit with tea and the door and the ache and he could not yet. He stood by the chestnut, which had known three generations of boys by their knife marks and had resigned itself to a life of scars. \u201cSay your names,\u201d he said to the people going by with their yawns and their plans. \u201cFirst and last and middle if you have one. Say the ones you don\u2019t use. Say the ones your grandmother called you that nobody would let you write. Say the ones you made up and never told anyone because you were eight and thought you\u2019d be someone else. Say them aloud, in order, and then go buy onions.\u201d It was absurd. It was a man putting a cup into the hands of a storm and asking it to pour. It worked because it was absurd. Magdalene said Magdalene Eunice Plum without blush and the town heard Eunice and stored it where it keeps lace. Mr. Bobbin said Tobias and then Bobbin and then in a small voice the name his wife had not been allowed to put on the stone and the stone in his chest shifted to make room. Mrs. Hardesty said Jane like a door shutting properly and felt the weight of the truth of a small name. Hester put her hands in her pockets and said Hester Hester Hester and then added Stowe as if it were her own idea and the men who named things glanced reluctantly down and had to write it.\n\nBy late afternoon the map in the school window had acquired names it had not intended to. Someone with a less neat hand and a better idea of the town had chalked Daniel\u2019s Oat across Field 2 and drawn an arrow meaning that definitely includes the hedge and if you don\u2019t like it you can climb it. Someone else had put Margaret\u2019s Drop where it belonged and added in the margin, mind the ditch, and a third, perhaps Hester, perhaps a boy she would shortly marry or fight, had written The Square With The Hole In It and drawn an indelicate picture beside it that made Vellum smile and then hate himself for smiling. The not-crow pecked at the chalk marks and came away with grit on its tongue and sulked because pins were sweeter.\n\nAt dusk, when respectable towns begin to be their less respectable selves and respectable men their more, the errata slowed. There is only so much correction one mind can pay attention to in a day. There are only so many polite cruelties you can display before the thin satisfaction of them leaks out and you remember you have soups to eat. Vellum sat with his hand on the press and looked at the painted soldier that had nothing to do with anything and everything to do with the boy who had been told not to point. He put his finger out and touched it and hated himself so thoroughly for the longing that the hate made a mark on his skin. He wrote a short letter, the sort that makes a man late for his dinner because he wants the sound of the words and not the sense. It said: Make a bargain with me. It said: I will take your mother out of my mouth if you take your town out of yours. It said: you do not know how to be quiet. He did not send it. He tore it up into pieces so small even a crow with pins for a palate would not bother.\n\nElias, who had said names until his tongue went woolly and did not mind, sat on his step and ate bread with jam and a ridiculous peace in it. Quill lay with his front paws straight and his back paws ridiculous and watched a fly with admiration for its adherence to its own brief. Hester came with her mirror and her head up like a girl who has decided not to audition for the parts she is offered and sat without being asked and without being trouble. \u201cWhat will he do next,\u201d she demanded, taking a bite of bread as if she meant to bite a sentence.\n\n\u201cHe will send numbers to charity,\u201d Elias said. \u201cHe will ration kindness. He will issue tickets for grief. He will say how many tears are appropriate per day, per death, per season. He will make goodness into something you line up for and resent.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd we will not,\u201d Hester said, not as question and not as boast. She had learned already to take the day by the scruff. \u201cWhat will we do.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will hang the verbs by the pump,\u201d Elias said. \u201cWe will say the names already in our mouths. We will write small notes in books that look like God. We will lay ribbons on paper. We will drink when it is time and go on speaking when the hush sits down and we will sing ill and well. We will take the pins out of things that ought to keep their motion. We will be ridiculous enough that cleverness sulks and goes to bed without supper.\u201d\n\n\u201cWill we win,\u201d Hester asked, as if you could ask a question like that and have it be treated with all the seriousness in the world and all the flippancy too.\n\n\u201cWe will not lose in ways that please him,\u201d Elias said. The dark came up the lane with its hands in its pockets like a boy. It stood at the end of the street and watched him and did nothing to him that he had not invited. \u201cAnd we will know where the tea is kept.\u201d\n\nQuill, who had made a profession of disdain for vows and a vocation of keeping them, put his chin on Elias\u2019s knee and made a sound like milk boiling, which is how some cats purr when they do not want you to know. He lifted his head a little and added, as if it were a detraction and not a benediction, \u201cYou should sleep. Tomorrow he will do something very boring and we will have to be clever against boredom, which is the most dangerous of enemies.\u201d\n\nElias tipped his head back against the door and looked at the sky, which had unhelpfully not arranged itself to show him which way to choose. He had, of late, stopped believing the sky was meant to instruct him and gone back to asking the floor. The floor had said sweep and he had done what he was told. He stood and closed the door and set the kettle where it belonged and wrote on the list on the back of his door the word mend, and under it, the word rest, and found that if you put them together they make the little sound you hear when a woman sits down and does not yet get up.\n\nHe slept with the dot on the table and not in his pocket because you must teach magic to trust the furniture, which is where life lives. Vellum dreamed of a field with no names and woke with the taste of someone else\u2019s hunger in his mouth and stood with his hand on the press until the metal cooled and remembered it was iron and not a question. The river turned under the bridge and looked up at the sky and decided it would not be taking anyone today without asking, and the town replied with the disagreeable contentment of a house that has been cleaned and will be dirty again in a minute, and both facts can be borne.",

Allowances\n\nMonday woke like a book that had been put back on the shelf with a leaf inside, saving someone\u2019s place, and the leaf had learned to read in the dark and had things to report. The low air had the starch of laundries about it, as if the sky had ironed itself and then forgotten what shape men wanted. Elias did not mind a dressed day when he had time to undress it gently, but he had slept with the dot on the table and it had rolled against his fingers twice in the night as if it were a chick or a headache, and he knew that the business of undoing would begin before his tea. Quill had taken the liberty of being both tender and rude in his sleep; he had rearranged himself across Elias\u2019s ribs like a punctuation mark with legal opinions and woken him twice by sneezing, which a cat will do if it believes the air has intruded on its person. When Elias swung his feet to the floor, the house shook itself as a settled bird does, not displeased to discover it still had its man.\n\nThey brought them in baskets the color of the postman\u2019s temper on wet days, and they were stamped with a crown and a seal and a line that claimed legality the way a child claims a pebble and expects everyone to agree the whole beach is his. Coupons, people said without being taught to, and they were right and wrong, right because the paper had been cut by a hard mind into small useful shreds, wrong because usefulness does not always sit in pieces. The books were blue, but not the kind that comforts; they had the sadness of ledgers and the creak of swings under grown men. Inside were neat perforations, and on each perforation in a hand that had meant to be merciful was printed a kindness. One read: two minutes of sympathy, transferable. Another: one listening, uninterrupting, may be redeemed on Tuesdays and Thursdays at the convenience of the listener. There were strips for patience and for civility and for the thing a man says when a child breaks a plate and he decides not to teach with a shout, and at the back, in a pocket that made Mrs. Hardesty\u2019s left eye twitch as if it had remembered ration books and the way hunger looks in the mirror, there were Special Allowances: three for grief, one for wild joy, one for rage if used with precautions and an adult present.\n\nThey came with people who had never taken a penny from a hand that did not wish to give one. Good men brought them and women with proper collars and a girl with a nervous lip who had learned to clench it between words and now could not let it go. \u201cTo avoid abuse,\u201d these people said, and their voices had the glaze of meetings on them, and they held out the books with both hands like wafers. \u201cSo that everyone has a share. So that the generous are not made destitute. So that the loud do not take all the air.\u201d For a minute in and among the geese on the green and the voices of men going to their Monday and the smell of cheap soap trying to be lemon, the town listened as if it were possible to put a bit of fairness into a pocket and not have it cut a hole on the way in.\n\nBy ten, Hester had already tried to buy a sorry with a patience and been told that the exchange rate was set in a printed notice and would she please not be sarcastic until after noon. She put both hands in her pockets and told the woman with the notice\u2014who was Mrs. Cray, who had never been in charge of anything but her hair and was doing badly by it\u2014that she would prefer to be sarcastic before noon because the light then was better. Elias took a book from the timid boy who had brought it and looked at it like a man making himself admire a hat a neighbor had made. He turned the pages and did not touch the perforations, because things with teeth in their edges like to be fed. Quill ran a whisker down the spine and sneezed again because sincerity in ink had always brought on a mild allergy.\n\n\u201cIt is a clever cruelty,\u201d Quill said finally, as if he was granting a rival the compliment of a nod across a battlefield. \u201cHe has made kindness into a cupboard. He will ration the cups. He will say who washes them. He will make a schedule and when a man is late for his civility, he will be fined.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will be poorer if we count it,\u201d Elias said. He put the book on the table and did the impolite thing; he wrote in his own hand through the printed word. He made loops and they were not tidy loops and Magdalene would have thrown a rag at him for the blot, but it was his and it said on the inside cover: you cannot keep soup with pins. He went out with the book in his pocket because you must learn the shape of a weapon before you teach people to ignore it. On the threshold, he touched the lintel and told the house he might be late to his noon, and the house held its breath and then let it go with an audible patience that struck him as indecently moving.\n\nThe queue had already formed by the pump. It did not know it was a queue; it thought it was a group of people all of whom had happened to think of water at the same time, which is what queues pretend when they are in fields and not in offices. A man stood at the head of it with the kind of authority that men take up when the sash is handed to them and they do not look at the sash closely enough to see the moth holes. He had a pin in his lapel and a notebook with a ribbon and a brass pencil that made him very happy in a way that did not want to be considered vulgar and was. \u201cKindnesses,\u201d he said into the air as if someone had asked what time the train goes, \u201care to be requested with the coupon attached. The volunteer with the kettle may redeem and initial. No more than one wild joy per day per family. Exceptions by special application.\u201d He wore an expression that was aiming for benign and could not settle there, the way a wasp will aim for jam but the jam has a skin on.\n\nShort John stood behind him with his hands hanging like two question marks and no answers. He had on a sash he had not been born to and his face was pale in the way faces go pale when a boy is praised for something that has not grown in the soil of him. In his pocket were more books and he jostled them with a knee in a way that told Elias, who knew pockets like a man knows the mouths of kettles, that Short John knew he ought not be where he was. He caught Elias\u2019s eye with the desperate dignity of a child caught playing king; he did not blush, because that would have given the game away, and the lack of blush made Elias want to put his hand on the back of the boy\u2019s neck in a way nobody would like.\n\nMrs. Troon came with the baby who had a Tuesday in him and a foot that liked water and exercised more caution than anyone thought. She handed over a coupon: one sympathy, good for five minutes, valid this week only. The man with the brass pencil took it between finger and thumb and held it up to the light as if sorrys have watermarks, and he inclined his head and wrote Mrs. Troon on a line with a little flourish that meant I am paid for doing this by admiration, and Magdalene appeared at his left shoulder with a look that suggested she would like to take that flourish and feed it to him. \u201cNo,\u201d she said very politely, which is a word that tells men to stop or the tea will be spilled on their pants. \u201cYou will go to my shop. You will sit on my stool. You will count this in ink until ink refuses to be counted. Leave my pump alone.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is for equitable distribution,\u201d the man said, with the haughtiness of someone who has read a pamphlet about equity. \u201cWe must ensure that the town is not prey to the generous. We must ensure that certain people do not take advantage.\u201d He glanced by accident toward Hester and then looked very quickly away, as if her face had a habit of pulling the meanings off sentences and he did not wish to be stripped in public. Hester grinned because she had done just that.\n\nElias took the man\u2019s notebook from his carefully correct hands and looked at the ribbon. It had been chosen by a woman; it had learned the shape of her fingers and was ashamed of its work. \u201cI have a ledger for you,\u201d he said, because you must always offer to rehome a thing that is being misused before you burn it. \u201cIt is on a wide table. It has a bowl of small apples beside it. It is called the commons. You do not write in anyone\u2019s column. You write in your own. Each day you write what you have taken and what you have brought. You write forgive myself for not bringing soup on Thursday to Mrs. Hardesty and then you bring her a sausage on Friday because she has not eaten, and then you write the kind of truth that makes your hands good, for instance I told a lie about my neighbor\u2019s daughter to see if my tongue still worked, and it did, and I would like to trade that for two hours of sweeping. You do it because your hands know it is right, not because I initial.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo initialing,\u201d Magdalene confirmed, sweet and deadly. \u201cNo ribbons. No brass pencils. No hats. You may use a burnt stick and the back of your hand if you must, so long as you wash after.\u201d She looked over the man\u2019s shoulder and saw the long morning where he had been taught to earn his keep by preventing other people from becoming less precise, and her mouth softened very slightly because she was not cruel and because a woman with a press knows where to set and where to let go.\n\nThe pump insisted upon its own say in the matter, being a democratic sort of iron. It had drunk water for forty years and spit it back with dignity for almost as long, and it would not be told when to be generous by a booklet with perforations. Elias wrapped Magdalene\u2019s wet list of verbs around the handle. He took Quill\u2019s actually from yesterday and stuck it with a fingernail to the man\u2019s lapel, because there are insects it is rude not to return when someone has brought them to a gathering. Then he stood back and let Mrs. Troon put her cup under the fall as if she had done it when she was a girl, because she had. The groan in the pump\u2019s first stroke went down into the ground and woke the good idea that had been sleeping under the green since someone decided to lay it flat and call it a place where a man can show off his potatoes. It made a sound that said we do not tear kindness into tickets, we keep it in bowls.\n\nVellum, who had expected barter and rage and a crowd of the unfairly sanctimonious, was disappointed by bowls. He put his pen down on the press and then picked it up again because he never put his pen down; it had grown into his hand in little roots and would have had to be dug out. He had thought to make them tidy, to make them say please in the right places and thank you where it would be counted and admitted into the ledger of what you can show to your sons. He had thought they would line up for sympathy the way they line up for meat. The paper breathed out on the press when he leaned over it as if it were a woman under a man that she had not chosen; it was an indrawn breath as thin as the edge of a knife. He smiled because he had made men behave well by compulsion and that is the oldest pleasure of a certain sort of mind, and then he frowned because fields with names were being written on his map by hands that did not ask permission. He did not ask the crow to go and tear them down because he did not like to ask, and in that small habit, which had begun as a point of pride and turned into a disability, there was a piece of his undoing.\n\nThe inspectors wore sashes, as Quill had predicted, which is the same as tying a ribbon around someone\u2019s hunger and expecting them to get full. They came to doors and asked people to show their books and their allotment of civility and any special permits for sympathy offered beyond the ordinary allotment, and they had lists in which generous women had been recorded with a tick in the margin that meant caution and perhaps a complaint later. Mr. Crisp\u2019s daughter, whose name was Eliza and whose father had persistently attempted to make it Lizzie because he thought that would make her kinder and had been surprised when it did not, came to the step with neither hat nor apology and asked which inspector wanted to come inside and untangle the string she kept for tying parcels. When no one volunteered, she put her hands behind her back and spoke as if she were a catechism and you had better get the answers right. \u201cNo,\u201d she said with proper elevation, \u201cyou may not count my decency. It does not fit in your boxes. Also, I will have back the paper you handed to the boy this morning that told him his kindness was to be administered by others, as I have told that boy since he was a wall-nibbler that he could choose when to say yes and no, and I will not have you take my teaching and make a ledger of it.\u201d\n\nShort John, who had been invited to memorise and had discovered memory was not improved by having your name shortened by a man with a pin, handed her his own book without meaning to. His hand had gone out because he remembered being offered sugar on a spoon and he had remembered that there are days when you want to feed someone even if it makes your mother cross. Eliza took it and tore the cover off very neatly and gave him the pages intact and he stood blinking at the niceness of the mercy as if it were rain that did not wet you, and then the torn cover lying in her palm showed its inside, full of the words of instructions men never read after the first pride, and Eliza looked at the tiny print and hated it with a cold precision that Elias would remember for a long time when he needed to aim at a hinge.\n\n\u201cI will take that,\u201d Elias said, because he did not want Eliza to poison herself on contempt and spend the morning vomiting where it would do no good. He tucked the cover into his pocket with the dot and the truth card and the ribbon and felt as if he were walking around with a woman\u2019s reticule in his trousers, which tickled him and kept him from making a speech. He did not make a speech because Quill had warned him that the enemy today lay with boredom. \u201cCollect your cups,\u201d he said instead, and the town did because a habit had begun in them and neither Vellum\u2019s cleverness nor anyone\u2019s weariness had had time to stop it. People brought out the chipped ones and the ridiculous ones, the cups with praise printed on them for jubilees not their own and the one without a handle that a grandfather would not part with because his hand had decided where to hold, and they set them on the table that Magdalene and Mr. Bobbin had brought out, which was the one that had never liked to live indoors and had longed for a market all its life and had been obliged to be respectable. On the table was laid a cloth that did not match anything and therefore matched the town.\n\nThey wrote, not in the blue books, but on paper that had wrapped a ham and on the back of a notice about Methodist teas and on one page of the Hampshire Chronicle that had got loose from binding because Magdalene had let it go. They wrote what they brought: I will come and sit at your window and say nothing on Wednesday. They wrote what they needed: my husband will not speak to me because the Queen died and he thinks being sad must be bigger than a kitchen and I would like someone to tell him the kitchen can hold the Queen if you open the doors. They wrote in ugly hands and in beautiful ones and in a child\u2019s block capitals, and Eliza wrote a note that said, as if daring someone to disagree, I am very bad at funerals; I can carry chairs. The list of verbs began to pick up in its fibers a new category of action that had not been set in type and probably never would be because the world would not consider it decent: the work of listening while someone fails to tell the truth and forgives himself.\n\nThat afternoon, when it would have been a pretty cruelty to do nothing and watch a town exhaust itself on its own virtue, Vellum sent the inspectors to the church. They came with a ledger that asked Elijah Grieves to account for how many bells had been rung for how many griefs and whether the bells had resounded equally for the rich and the eating of sausages yesterday, and Elijah took the book in both hands and regarded it as if it were a coal shovel asking to be consulted on weddings. He set it down. He wrote in a hand so slow and exact that any inspector would be obliged to watch until boredom did what truth could not, and he wrote: the bell rings the same for anyone who held a spoon. Then he added: the bell rings the same for anyone who did not, and he underlined did not because he understood that grief sometimes has nothing to do with having had a thing and much to do with having been promised and never given.\n\nQuill, who had no respect for ledgers and a professional interest in paper that presumed, leaped onto an inspector\u2019s lap and placed both paws squarely on the word appropriation before the man could read it, and stayed there until his full cat weight pressed it through the paper and into the man\u2019s trousers as a little shame. The inspector tried to move him and could not because there are laws in this world that only cats enforce, and finally he laughed helplessly and let the laughing go on two seconds longer than he should have because it was not the tone pamphlets require. When he stood up at last, the word had transferred to his shirt and he would have to go home before he could be seen enforcing anything else, and this, too, was a mercy the town pretended not to understand.\n\nFor his countercharm, Elias did not bring a broom because brooms would offend men who believed in ledgers; he brought a ledger bigger than theirs. He took the book Mrs. Bell kept under her bed and carried the kettle on top of it the way he had told her to, and he laid it on the commons table open at the page where the babies\u2019 names had been rearranged in Vellum\u2019s pretty formation and straightened again with twine. \u201cWrite your own kindnesses to yourselves,\u201d he said, and the town looked at him as if he had suggested that men put their hands in their own pockets and share out their money to the person who always forgot he deserved any. He nodded at Mr. Crisp\u2019s daughter because he was not above calling in a terror when he needed one, and Eliza wrote at the top of a clean page with the printshop\u2019s ugly pen in an ugly ink: I forgive myself for not liking funerals, as long as I carry chairs, and she signed it, and the ink looked better at once for having been given a bad job to do and doing it with an honest back.\n\nHe made a thing with string and spoons, because words are not everything and metal is next to truth if you ask the right question. He took spoons, which were the same spoons men have argued over for a thousand years, and he tied string to them, and he laid them in a bowl in the center of the table, and he told anyone who came to the commons that if they left without taking one, he would be cross. Hester took a spoon, because Hester would take anything that looked as if it might become a weapon later, and she put it in her pocket and made it ring when she walked. Mr. Bobbin tied his string around his wrist because he did not trust himself to keep hold of things that were not heavy. Mrs. Hardesty put hers under the counter because she had a way of reaching for sharp words and she wanted to grab metal first. The spoons knocked together when the wind came, and the sound they made was the kind of small music that rearranges a miser into a person who remembers that the spoon in his hand is meant for soup he intends to share.\n\nVellum tried boring them in the afternoon, because Quill had predicted boredom, and a man will always try the tactic you least fear when he thinks you\u2019ve become clever. He sent a procession. It was not the sort of procession that makes boys throw their caps and girls adjust their collars; it was the sort of procession that a man invents when he has never been celebrated and suspects that celebration is a punishment. They came with white bands around their arms and white cloths tied to sticks and white feathers on their hats that made their hats look ashamed, and they walked without a band and without a stride and without anything to carry properly and they asked that people admire the Quiet. They did not speak. They did not sing. They did not shuffle. They were the kind of silence that wave at windows and wait to be invited in to sit on chairs and tell women their grief is untidy.\n\nElias did not tell Hester she must not do what she was thinking. He let her run into the back of the procession with bells tied to her ankles, because Hester had learned from Elijah Grieves that bells belong to wrists and rope and people, not to schedules, and she made a noise like a baby storm and the white hats bobbed in agitation like mushrooms in uncertain weather. Mr. Bobbin, whose instrument does not take to being asked for high-mindedness, took out his fiddle and played badly on purpose because badness is sometimes a holy act, and the procession had to step in time to avoid looking ridiculous and then looked ridiculous anyway because a song had attached itself and they had not been made to hold one.\n\nWhen the white came to the church, the vicar stepped out and spoke to it like a man who had been interrupted while buttering bread. \u201cNo,\u201d he said, and he said it with an old west wind in his voice, the kind that knocks apples and leaves them fit for jelly and tells men not to argue about fruit. \u201cYou may come in when you have something to carry. We do not admire emptiness on purpose. We admire it by mistake, when we had meant to make soup and the cupboard argued.\u201d The Quiet did not know what to do with being told that it had nothing in its hands. It had been in rooms where being blank earns praise. It had been in rooms where men have made their faces into a refusal to cry and had been congratulated. It had not been in a place where being silent was not a virtue to be paraded but a space to be held while someone else finds her breath.\n\nBy late day, the coupons had lost their paper shine and had become merely paper. They were useful to light stoves and to write shopping lists and occasionally to stick under a table leg that wobbled because a man had wished to have his cupboard stand level and the floor refused. Elias took the book from his pocket and tore out the Special Allowance that said for grief, and he went to Mrs. Bell in between calls because he had the offense in his hands and could not carry it another hour, and he laid it on her table and put the kettle on top of it, and he did not speak because there are things you must not say in the presence of a woman whose day keeps people alive. He washed his hands without being asked and took the chair by the stove and scraped his nails carefully with the back of the knife because blood hides in them and you must show it a way out. Mrs. Bell saw him make a ritual and felt, in her elbows, a lessening of something no man had put there. She would not say thank you. She would say breathe to a girl with a long night ahead, and the thank you would be in not dying.\n\nThat night, for the first time since he had moved into the lower room, Vellum came up into the air. He did not mean to, which is how you know he was not yet lost to cunning altogether. He brought no paper. He brought the point of his nose and the fragile edge of his pride and stood at the corner where the field with the sign Parcel 7 looked at the hedge and pretended not to be jealous. He looked at the chalk written on his map through the window and at the chalk on the ground that boys had made into boxes with words in them because the big words kept their feet under them when they jumped. He wondered whether he had written the word necessary too many times today and if he had, whether that made it less so. He had known hunger was a bowl you do not talk about; he had not known kindness was a bowl you must talk into or it goes hard on the edges and does not pour.\n\nElias met him there not because he had guessed at Vellum\u2019s steps but because his own had brought him round the circuit of his day and landed at that corner the way a penny stops because a nail is under the tablecloth. He stood a little way off and did not say \u201cyou have come out,\u201d because men who have been under so long think you are mocking them. He stood with his hands in his pockets and thought of his mother\u2019s ribbon and of Short John\u2019s hands and of the vicar\u2019s head when it had been bowed for an instant today at the word river and then lifted because it had been asked to say Anton. When he spoke, he did not say a clever line, because cleverness serves only the first nice minute and then grows hungry.\n\n\u201cYou cannot make a scarcity of what breath does,\u201d he said. He said it to the hedge, because hedges understand things better than men when men are being watched. \u201cYou can make counting of the parts of it. You can put values on the edges so that someone with cold fingers can be persuaded it is warmer to have a list than a woman's hand. You can convince a boy that it is better to be thanked by a ribbon than by the look on his father\u2019s face when the wood is in. But it is breath. It will go into whatever room will let it, and if you shut the doors, it will push under, and if you seal that, it will go out the chimney and come down next door and the next town will name its fields and sing badly and keep its grief in bowls.\u201d\n\nVellum did not speak for a time, which is a form of respect in men who suspect they may not be loved and do not wish to do anything worse than they must. When he did, he kept his voice thin, perhaps because he did not know how to make it broad without sounding like someone he had hated. \u201cMy father gave my mother coupons for laughter,\u201d he said, not looking at Elias and not looking away, because his eyes had been taught to behave at their work. \u201cHe gave her three a week and one extra at Easter and told her not to overspend because laughing made the neighbors think we were like them and he did not want to be like them. On Mondays she laughed when she burned the bread and got scolded for it because the coupon did not cover laughter at mistakes. On Saturdays she would stand by the window and look at the back yard and use them all in a swallow. I thought that was economy and grace. I thought that was how you kept a house from spilling. You will not persuade me with bowls.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do not want to persuade you,\u201d Elias said, because he had learned, slowly, that doing so can make a man hate truth for being clever. \u201cI want to keep the town from being punished because your father ran his house like a counting book. You will go on being the sort of man whose hand writes smaller when he is ashamed. You will call it neatness and sometimes you will be right. You will look at the way people put cups down and think of putting them down in rows. No one will stop you thinking that. When you put the rows in other people\u2019s houses you will be in my way. I will not let you. You may come and stand at the edge and watch a bowl and call it foolish and go away and not die of it. Or you may come with a cup, which would make both of us very tired. Either way, you will not count women\u2019s laughter. It will go strange if you do.\u201d\n\nVellum turned his head then, not toward Elias exactly, but toward the sound of a woman on the green laughing in a way she had been rationing her whole life, that donkey-bray surprised into grace which you hear on spring days and at funerals out of season. He watched the sound, which is a thing that can be done if you are patient, and for a second some piece of him that had been seven and had wanted to point thought very hard about climbing out of his shirt. He put his hand on his cuff, which he had whitened this morning so that no discussion of his person would take place without his consent, and he said, as if tasting does not count as appetite, \u201cYou will not think me a monster if I tell you I have written to men who will buy your fields with the numbers I have given them.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will think you a clerk who has put his pen into another man\u2019s land and expected the soil to take ink,\u201d Elias said. He did not smile because there is no kindness in smiling at a man to whom you must say something honest. \u201cThey will come. They will carry rulers. They will stand in Daniel\u2019s Oat and in Margaret\u2019s Drop and ask where the lines are and expect to be told. And we will take them to the green and ask them to wait while we sing ill and ring bells wrong and feed them soup that is very good and speak the names of our dead in such a way that when they leave their rulers will have learned something unforgivable, which is that there are measures you cannot take and remain tidy. They will suspect we are untoward and be correct.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt will not last,\u201d Vellum said, and his voice did not have triumph in it nor despair. It had the damp of below-rooms and a boy\u2019s obedience. \u201cYou cannot win with bowls. A bowl breaks.\u201d\n\n\u201cA bowl mends,\u201d Elias answered, and the word, tiny and serviceable, went between them like an old coin that has passed so many hands it has become a prayer. \u201cAnd even when it shatters, the floor keeps some of what was in it. You have been trying to win with pins. A pin rusts. I am not winning either, not in any way you would count. I am living long enough to know where the tea is kept. That, it turns out, is a form of victory if you have to choose one.\u201d He inclined his head to Vellum, not as to a man he liked, which he did not, and not as to a man he pitied, which he was trying not to make into a habit, but as to a man he intended to continue to know until one of them died.\n\nWhen he walked away, Quill slipped down from the hedge where he had been rude in every way a cat can be in the presence of a man who tries to regulate laughter. He wound himself between Elias\u2019s ankles with exaggerated forgiveness, because he had climbed a field and dirtied his white feet and wished not to be told he was glorious. \u201cHe wants to be told someone will count him,\u201d the cat said, which is as near to kindness as Quill gets with enemies who don\u2019t have scales. \u201cHe thinks fair is numbers and not chairs carried and kettles offered and boys not told to hush. You will not persuade him, but you will make him late for his next cruelty and that matters as much as anything in a town.\u201d\n\nIt was late when the new ledger went up, which is to say the old wall of the old posting house that no one had posted in for years because one man had been shot for the wrong thing there once upon a time and the wall had taken a dislike to messages. Tired hands with good chalk wrote on it not news and not orders and not anything that would earn anyone praise; they wrote kindnesses that had happened and the spoons that had been returned and the cups that had gone missing and had been found under beds and the chairs that had been carried and the chairs that would need carrying on Thursday because Mrs. Plumbly was coming to lay out her dead. They wrote in their own hands the line that Magdalene had learned to set and refused today and would not refuse tomorrow: already paid. Then under it, because men will be men and towns will be towns and there are rules that must be spoken and laughed at, they wrote: if you have not paid, do not fret; bring a pie.\n\nAt Elias\u2019s table, the dot sat content as a seed in a dish and the truth card lay face down under it because truth lies better if you give it a small weight. He wrote on his list behind the broom mend and rest and then wrote borrow and lend and then wrote sing even if and then, because the day had asked more of him than a heroism and he had given it, he wrote sardines because Quill had been patient beyond reason. Quill leaped onto the chair with the look of a cat who has been promised something and intends to collect with a complaint, and he purred while he ate and made the tiny noise that sounds like tea water beginning to forgive a kettle. Andover breathed the way a house does when the baby has been put down and the father is keeping his chair quiet by force of will and the mother has taken off her shoes and will be found sleeping with one in her hand, and somewhere a man below a school put his pen down for a minute and looked at his empty hand as if it might have the right to be bare and did not know what to do with it and did nothing, which is a beginning if you have someone to make soup for you later.",
