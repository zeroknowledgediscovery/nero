     "novel_text": "The email had been there all along, nested between the department\u2019s circular on GDPR compliance and a newsletter from a publisher she barely remembered meeting at a conference in York. She clicked and skimmed and would have deleted, only the subject line snagged on her like burrs: CONFIRMATION OF FINALIST STATUS \u2014 The Night Stage.\n\nShe read it again. Then a third time out loud, through steam and kettle hiss and her own heartbeat. Congratulations Professor Blake... televised final... Hammersmith... a studio rehearsal pass... coaching sessions... travel covered, accommodation on the river. She laughed in the small square kitchen as if someone had told a very good joke and had to lean a palm on the cool laminate to steady herself.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re kidding,\u201d she said to no one. \u201cYou\u2019re absolutely, completely kidding me.\u201d\n\nOutside, Wokingham was making up its mind about the weather and the Friday market was setting up in the precinct. Some mornings you could hear the fish van calling names like nursery rhymes: cod! haddock! mackerel! She stood with her mug and thought about the precise weight of this thing\u2014a show watched by millions, a stage she\u2019d seen only in fluorescent dreams\u2014and then found herself counting minutes. When could she call Tabby without waking her up? Would this even wake her? It would. It had to.\n\nShe sent a photo of the email and then rang immediately anyway. The dial tone ran and ran; an old sweet high note she could hum. Tabby answered on the fifth, breathless.\n\n\u201cIs this about Mum,\u201d Tabby said by way of hello, as she nearly always did, and the words threw their dark robe over the morning. Then, as if hearing herself: \u201cDon\u2019t say yes. Don\u2019t you dare.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Miriam said. \u201cNo. Listen. The Night Stage. The finals. I\u2019m in.\u201d\n\nIt took a beat to register. Then she got her sister\u2019s laugh, that bright expensive sound she could never quite afford to hear. \u201cOh, you brilliant oddball,\u201d Tabby said. \u201cI always said you\u2019d be less beige one day, didn\u2019t I. When is it? When do I get to watch you terrify the nation with your bells and whistles.\u201d\n\n\u201cLoops and harmonies,\u201d Miriam said, smiling. \u201cThree weeks. Rehearsals before. London. Accommodation in\u2014wait. It says\u2014Hammersmith, near the river. Can you\u2014will you come?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow would I not,\u201d Tabby said. \u201cWe can make a horrible sign. I\u2019ll write it in my worst handwriting. I\u2019ll bring a trumpet. Honestly, Mim, honestly. You doing this. You.\u201d\n\nHer name, Mim, did what it always did, tugged at some childhood place where the loft smelled of dust and elderflower, where they\u2019d drawn chalk towns on the driveway and given each other elaborate, unacceptable council fines. For a minute she was not forty-one with a stack of marking and a choir rehearsal and Committee B at four; she was ten, and her sister was seven and sticky with jam and conviction.\n\nShe\u2019d been Professor Blake for four years now, and Dr. Blake for twelve before that, and no one in her family had got used to it the way people in the department had. She\u2019d started calling herself L. M. Blake on papers to make the emails kinder.\n\nShe went to campus swollen with a private tune and let herself into her office, the one that had an ivy plant limping across the window and a poster of Daphne Oram peering out between book spines. Students drifted past like fish beyond glass. She opened her laptop and read the email again for the hilarity of it, for the sweetness of the language that made her pretty hobby sound like a profession: we are thrilled... we believe your act will speak to viewers across the country... we are committed to diverse voices. She put on the kettle again, even though she didn\u2019t need it. The whistling gave her another excuse to laugh.\n\nBy eleven she\u2019d told Cal from Stats down the corridor, whispered in the way you whisper in churches and exam halls. Cal stood in the doorway with his makeshift hair and his unreadable T-shirt and said, \u201cLike the final final?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe televised one,\u201d she said. They both shook their heads, grinning like thieves.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t even know you were doing this,\u201d Cal said. \u201cI thought you just played in weird pubs and national trust toilets.\u201d\n\n\u201cAcoustics are very welcome in buildings with thick stone walls,\u201d she said primly, and he laughed, and she felt the world tilt.\n\nThe talent show had been a dare to herself in January. A video recorded late and messy, their living room full of leftover pine needles and caution. She\u2019d sent it half certain it would be swallowed by some algorithm, the way a song gets swallowed by the night. And yet, there had been the January audition in a hall with a squeakier floor than any school she\u2019d ever set foot in, and someone sympathetic in a headset had nodded along. There had been callbacks and smaller finals and the improbable business of people clapping where she had expected to be embarrassed. Now this.\n\nHer act had come the way some projects came, backwards. She\u2019d been teaching a seminar on medieval lyric\u2014refrain, repetition, the devil\u2019s music in some monastic eyes\u2014and a student had asked, as they sometimes asked, whether this was anything like the loops people did now. She\u2019d said yes and fumbled for an example, and afterwards felt the old itch in her fingers. She had a small concertina her grandmother\u2019s sister left her, and a penny whistle from a summer in Ennis, and a battered loop station she\u2019d bought second-hand from a man with delicate wrists on the Oxford Road. She had her voice, low and rough in the mornings, smoother by mid-afternoon. She began stacking noises like stones: the tap of chalk on a board, the click of a stapler, a vowel held until it found the corner of itself. It was a joke until it wasn\u2019t. She found herself singing ballads she taught by day, making polyphony out of other people\u2019s grief and stubbornness. In the terrible months after their mother\u2019s second stroke, it steadied her. Some evenings, it saved her, or at least saved the hours.\n\nThat afternoon, at three, she met her second-year seminar and said, \u201cLern\u00e8d friends, today we hum,\u201d and lifted the concertina onto the desk like a contraband melon. Twenty heads lifted. Someone\u2019s phone fell out of their lap and made a tinny sound like a bell from a bike.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not serious,\u201d said Miri (short for Miranda, with eyeliner like a manifesto).\n\n\u201cI am,\u201d Miriam said. \u201cThink of the refrain as a home you keep coming back to. Think of it as a way for the song to keep you. We\u2019ll talk about the words later. For now, the shape.\u201d\n\nShe made them intone the simplest patterns, made them split into two groups, then three. Da-da-da, and daaa-da-da, like rain in a gutter. Someone giggled until it stopped being funny and became like a small religious experience. When she added her own line, the room shifted, as rooms can. Miri\u2019s mouth made a soft O. They were good. Young and good and not yet embarrassed by their bodies. If you stood outside the window you\u2019d think a low and minor instrument had been playing, some old psaltery found in a lane.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to be scandalous on television,\u201d said Miri afterwards, in the front row by the desk, and Miriam laughed.\n\n\u201cModerately scandalous,\u201d she said. \u201cAt best.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll sell out Hammersmith,\u201d Miri said, unaware of the logistics of showbusiness and the way producers load more trapeze artists than there are trapezes. \u201cCan I bring my aunt. She believes education is useless.\u201d\n\n\u201cBring her,\u201d Miriam said, not certain what she meant.\n\nAfter committee, after signing a disintegrating card for someone taking early retirement, she walked home through the long green that ran along the back of the school playing fields and then cut towards the station. Wokingham, with its market-town hum and its leaves. A boy went by on a scooter with a flashing wheel, a small star-system spinning. The Black Boy\u2019s pub had a new chalkboard out front\u2014pie and mash, quiz Thursday. In a window over a shop, a cat lay like a loaf.\n\nHer terraced house was neat because the alternative made her skin itch. She picked up the post, which included a charity envelope and a flyer offering to replace her roof in a day. On the mat lay a glossy postcard advertising the show itself, though it didn\u2019t say her name, of course. The hosts smiled with teeth like pearl ornaments. Thousands of applications\u2026 the very best acts from across the country. It was real; ludicrous, and real.\n\nA message pinged from Nadine at The Night Stage, introducing herself as her point of contact and asking for her postal details again. They would deliver the detailed schedule on Monday. She typed back carefully, checked for typos as if Nadine might judge her academic worth, and finally wrote: yes, that\u2019s my number; yes, that\u2019s my best postal address; yes, I have a loop station and we do not require special power, just an ordinary UK plug; yes, a dressing room mirror would be grand; no, my act does not involve pyrotechnics unless you count vowels.\n\nAt six, she went to The Crooked Wren to meet Cal and a couple of choir people and tell the story properly, with a pint of something amber in her hand. They sat in the corner under a painting of what might have been a fox or a dog wearing a monocle; it was hard to tell. Bex from choir, who had enough hair for three other women, stared and said, \u201cBut you\u2019re not a headcase. Do headcases just audition now. Is that the world?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a headcase,\u201d Miriam said. \u201cI\u2019m an eccentric. And you see me at choir. You haven\u2019t seen me do the one with the pens and the whistle. I should patent it. Someone probably already has. The men in my YouTube comments certainly think so.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour YouTube comments?\u201d Cal said, theatrical. \u201cYou have YouTube comments? Excuse me while I faint.\u201d\n\n\u201cNever read them,\u201d said Bex, serious suddenly, and raised her pint.\n\nLater, walking back along the dim street threaded with fairy lights, she rang Tabby again, wanting a reprise, wanting the quick fizz of shared drama, the brokered thrill. No answer, though the call clicked into voicemail with two beats of background noise as if her sister had lifted then thought better. It was fine. It was Friday night. Tabby had a life with edges. She left a message anyway.\n\n\u201cHelp me choose,\u201d she said. \u201cWhich song first. I can\u2019t do Barbara Allen first. It\u2019ll sound like the BBC in 1952. But the \u2018Silver Dagger\u2019 one. I can loop the dagger\u2014I mean the word, not the object. Call me when you\u2019re less dazzling than a whole nightclub.\u201d\n\nIn the morning, Eileen from next door knocked with a jar of marmalade and her views on the council. Miriam listened, nodded, pictured Nadine\u2019s schedule. Rehearsal 1: West London rehearsal space, Thursday, arrival by 10:00 AM. She imagined a room with mirrors and a man with a clipboard. She\u2019d be told to smile and talk about her core message. She imagined her core message in a small box with a lid. She imagined having to explain that her act was not about gimmick but old ways made new, about the body as instrument and instrument as body. She thought, maybe, that wasn\u2019t a message. It was nothing the show could film. It was too private to fit in a box.\n\n\u201cAre you eating,\u201d Eileen asked at the end of a sentence about traffic.\n\n\u201cI am,\u201d Miriam said. \u201cLook. Bread. Butter. Marmalade. Replete.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re so proud,\u201d Eileen said, as if discussing an exam result. \u201cOf course I\u2019ll vote for you. We\u2019ve all been told to. Even Mr. Hughes at number eleven, even though he says television is a tool of the devil.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d Miriam said. \u201cIf I can win over the devil\u2019s tool, I\u2019m unstoppable.\u201d\n\nShe practiced. She sat in her front room with the upright piano that had a sour middle C and the loop station on the carpet, its pedals scuffed where her shoes liked to fall. She laid down a drone with the low ends of the concertina, counted four bars in and caught it in the loop, then added a second line, close and dissonant like two sisters not speaking. Then a patter of pen taps on a hardback. Then a breath. Then her voice. She was never sure how it might come out until it did, a slightly different instrument each time, like the flute you pick up in a music shop that has a crack you must learn.\n\nThere was a knock at the door during her fourth take and she stepped on the stop button and went in stocking feet to answer. Cal stood with a Tupperware, grinning, and behind him a small dog he was minding for a friend, black with white socks.\n\n\u201cI brought curry,\u201d Cal announced. \u201cAnd also a dog.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoes the dog eat curry,\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cHe informs me he doesn\u2019t,\u201d Cal said, looking down. The dog gazed back with charity.\n\nThey ate cross-legged, talked about set lists, about stage fright.\n\n\u201cDo you get it,\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cYes. Then no. Then yes. Sometimes the line just before I begin I think: I cannot do this. I cannot do anything. And then the music starts and I remember that I don\u2019t have to be clever, I just have to be honest.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd medieval,\u201d Cal said. \u201cDon\u2019t forget medieval.\u201d\n\nThe show called again, this time a youngish man called Rory with a slight Midlands drawl who told her gently that they preferred if she didn\u2019t use the word \u201cmedieval\u201d in her pre-performance interview, because it made people think of chastity belts. \u201cWhich are a myth,\u201d he added, cheerful, like a student who\u2019s read the second half of a reading list.\n\n\u201cPeople,\u201d she repeated. \u201cYou all mean a sort of imagined average viewer.\u201d\n\n\u201cExactly,\u201d Rory said with relief. \u201cExactly that.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow would you prefer I say it,\u201d she said, pen hovering.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cOld songs. Throwback. Timeless. Old school. That sort of thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is not at all old school,\u201d Miriam said, and then laughed. \u201cI know. I know. I won\u2019t say the word. I\u2019ll be digestible.\u201d\n\n\u201cPerfect,\u201d he said. \u201cAlso we sometimes call our acts by their act name. Do you have one?\u201d\n\nOh, God. She hadn\u2019t thought. She\u2019d been plain Miriam in signed emails, her legal name on forms. An act name. She looked around the room, the way people in movies look around the room and call themselves Lampy Tarn or Chair Boson.\n\n\u201cLight Where,\u201d she said, and then \u201cNo\u2014no, that\u2019s nonsense. Maybe\u2014The Lilt? No. There must be seventy-five Lilts. The\u2014\u201d\n\nAt that moment the dog barked at the hallway mirror, startling her into a falsetto. The dog had a collar with letters that spelled NORA. She put a hand on the crown of its head, felt warmth.\n\n\u201cHow about just my name,\u201d she said into the phone. \u201cMiriam Blake. People will cope.\u201d\n\n\u201cFine by us,\u201d Rory said, and she imagined him tapping the keypad, a tiny life detail firmed up. \u201cSee you Thursday.\u201d\n\nEven in that quiet week, between the email and the first rehearsal, things were not entirely quiet. A segment producer came to Wokingham, to film what they called \u201csoft story,\u201d which involved Miriam standing in the town centre looking at vegetables with a professional interest she\u2019d not had since she was six. She walked the length of Peach Street with a camera following, a person in a denim jacket asking her questions slightly off-mic. \u201cWhy old songs,\u201d the denim jacket asked. She said, \u201cBecause they were made to be carried in mouths,\u201d and the woman\u2019s face shifted as if that could be used.\n\nThey filmed in her office too, and her students became suddenly stately, sitting without slouching like saints. A boy in a hoodie asked if he could be in the background. They dimmed the fluorescent lights and made her say three sentences again with more smile. They filmed her touching spines, a curious archive of gestural commas.\n\nThe unglamour sat alongside the glamour in a way she found comic. She still had to sort out her mother\u2019s chair-raiser that the hospital never collected. She still had to pay the window cleaner, a cheerful man who had an anecdote about every pane he\u2019d ever seen. The train to London still broke down at Slough at least once a fortnight and had to be coaxed into shame by a woman at the microphone who said, with startling precision, that they were sorry at the inconvenience caused.\n\n\u201cBreathe,\u201d Bex kept texting. \u201cEat. Remember to oxygenate. Don\u2019t die before you make us proud.\u201d\n\n\u201cOptimal plan,\u201d she replied.\n\nShe didn\u2019t see Tabby, not properly, in that week. They swapped voice notes like dancers in a hallway. There was always something: Tabby\u2019s shift at the wine bar, Tabby\u2019s allocation at the charity shop where she did a day a week for reasons Miriam pretended she understood. A man called Darragh drifted in and out of sentences. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing,\u201d Tabby said, and then, \u201cOkay, it\u2019s maybe something, but not your jurisdiction,\u201d and then laughed sharply and sent a heart.\n\nTheir mother\u2019s care plan was stable for the moment. Stable meant a slow lean downward, sure, but no sudden drops. Sometimes it was enough to light her day: the way their mother\u2019s hand still recognized the shape of a fork, or the way she could be coaxed to sing. Sometimes, Miriam thought that this was why she sang: because some words, sung, could carry memory like goats carry milk on the narrow paths. Churl. Meed. Wend. Old words like pebbles you cannot wear out.\n\nOn Thursday at nine she lugged the loop station in its gypsy-case, the cables packed and taped so no intern would panic. She wore the jacket that made her look more like herself: navy with a thread of silver, shoulders that meant business but kindly. The train to Paddington was full of small children pointing at everything. At each stop, her heart ran through its paces. She texted Nadine: Nearly there. Nadine replied with a prayer hands emoji that for once did not annoy.\n\nThe rehearsal space was a bland dream of white. Studio 3. In the corridor, a woman in sequins walked like the sequins weighed more than you\u2019d think. A boy no older than her first-year undergraduates was moving his lips very fast as if rehearsing a rap in his head. She felt the old sensation you get in school gyms: the tips of your fingers remembering how to peel cello tape, the smell of floor polish pricking some tear. It was both unearthly and a tax office.\n\n\u201cProfessor Blake,\u201d someone called, and she turned to see Nadine, who was made entirely of scarf and sincerity. \u201cWe\u2019ve been watching your videos. We love the\u2014what did you call it? The pen taps?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe percussive stationery,\u201d Miriam said, deadpan, because she could.\n\n\u201cOh my God,\u201d Nadine said. \u201cSay that on camera.\u201d\n\nShe was walked to a corner to do sound check, the loop station credibly linked to an amp that did not hum, and she began the slow build of her act. One line, another, the bass hum of the concertina finding very gently the shape of the room. She met the face of the man in the sound booth, saw it change. Good. The best thing was always that first moment of disbelief: the way you could see someone expecting you to be quaint, and then recalibrating because the room had tipped. She built the second chorus. She heard her own voice come back to her, a sister she knew well. She stepped into it. When she ended, the room fell in love for a small and blessed second with being silent.\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d said the sound man into the microphone, business-like, and then, less so: \u201cOkay. That\u2019s\u2026 yeah. Good.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s a professor,\u201d someone murmured behind a script, as if it were a spell that made levitation possible.\n\nShe met the other acts between cues. A contortionist called Vee moved like a question mark and ate an apple like a person. A comedian with a face like an eager uncle tried a joke about the M25 that made no one laugh now, but might later. A boy with small precise hands played a toy piano with the seriousness of a surgeon. She liked them all immediately, the way you like your companions in a waiting room for a minor operation.\n\n\u201cYou will be huge,\u201d said Vee, matter-of-fact, not looking at her as she stretched her spine into improbable shapes.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need huge,\u201d Miriam said. \u201cI need convincingly medium. I need to stay upright and not fall over any wires.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour advice is terrifying,\u201d Vee said cheerfully, and bent until she seemed to be lying her head on the back of her own knee.\n\nOn the train back she texted Tabby a careful stream of nothing. It had been a smooth day. Tired. The show people were real. You would like Vee, who is made of springs. A boy called himself Ozone unironically and I find that enviable. She sent a voice note of twenty seconds: the chorus of the song she wanted to open with, just the bones. It was a bargaining chip, look what I have made, isn\u2019t it fine, can you say you\u2019re fine too.\n\nThere was no reply by Reading. She told herself it meant nothing. On the platform at Wokingham, a small girl waved at the train as if to keep it safe, as if to send it to a war. An old man touched the brim of his made-up hat at no one.\n\nLater that night, when the house was slow and the windows returned her face to her, her phone trembled on the table. She swiped. A voice note from Tabby. She pressed play.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d Tabby said, in the tone of someone saying it before you ask it. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. You gather. There\u2019s\u2026 there\u2019s a thing, but it isn\u2019t your thing, Mim. I know you think every thing is your thing, but don\u2019t ro\u2013 don\u2019t\u2014\u201d The voice broke somehow, like a tape chewed. The next second was static and what might have been wind. Then: \u201cListen, I can\u2019t\u2014\u201d The note ended. The small timer read eleven seconds.\n\nShe played it again and again, as if repetition could change content. It couldn\u2019t. She sent back a volley of words: Are you? Can I call? Should I come? She called anyway. It went to voicemail with the kind of cheeriness you would invent for your own funeral: Tabby again. Say your best.\n\nShe went to bed and lay under the duvet cool as the other side of a pillow, her hands a fraction too cold. It was not unusual; these half-outlines were Tabby\u2019s scribble. Tabby\u2019s life had always had angles she could not quite see. She had learned not to blunder, to bring soup and a joke instead of insistence. Love, she had found, wasn\u2019t always a key. Sometimes it was a blanket. Sometimes it was a pot plant you watered until you learned to stop drowning it.\n\nIn the morning she taught the last seminar of the term and left them with a silly hymn she loved, the kind that listed the parts of the day as if a day were a cathedral. In the afternoon she finally did the boring admin of her life: the electricity where the supplier sends you letters that say things like We need to read your meter and then Do not worry about this but and then We have estimated. She couldn\u2019t estimate Tabby.\n\nShe made a folder for the show called NIGHT in all caps like a teen. She put in it the contracts, the itineraries, the sheet of notes in which she had attempted to answer, for herself, what her act was about. She crossed through a lot of adjectives, none of which looked like her in a dress shop mirror. Possibly, it was about companionship. The way voices made company that did not frighten the dark. The way a loop did not abandon you, did not forget.\n\nSaturday someone slipped a postcard under her door. No stamp. No envelope. It showed a strip of sea the colour of bruised plums and a pier that jogged out like a line of punctuation. Selsey, or Worthing, or somewhere the children of Berkshire grew up pretending was their own coast. On the back, in a fast tidy hand that belonged to their childhood doctor or their form teacher or the universe at large, the words: Light where you left it. No name.\n\nShe stood in the hall with the postcard and a feeling like a small bird trapped in her stomach. It was a phrase. It had their DNA. They had said it to each other that summer their father left for the second time and came back the third, the summer with the vowels too long. Light where you left it. Tell me the way so I can come by the same road. I promise I\u2019ll leave the light where you left it.\n\nHad Tabby written it? She turned it this way and that, and it did not become more legible. She photographed it and sent it with a question mark. No read receipt. No reply.\n\nShe went out, because staying still made the noise louder. On the street she saw chaos and comfort: a delivery van untidily parked, a boy kicking a bottle top expertly into a drain, the woman in the charity shop window setting up a display of jackets with autumn in their elbows. She went in. \u201cTabitha,\u201d she said to the woman at the till, who was soft with ethics and eyes. \u201cWhen is she on? When\u2019s her shift?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s doing Thursdays,\u201d the woman said, riffling. \u201cShe\u2019s a good sort. Bright. I told her that. She told me to sell the mirror even if she reserved it. Do you want the mirror? It\u2019s very forgiving.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have a mirror,\u201d Miriam said, and believed it.\n\nIn the evening she called her mother. A carer held the phone. Her mother said her name in a way that made her both feel like a thousand stones and also a small floating thing. She sang, very gently, Daisy Daisy, and her mother sang back, dull sweetness like the last of the pears. \u201cProfessor Blake,\u201d the carer said, when they were done and had finished being grateful to each other for being both alive and present. \u201cThe telly. We\u2019ll put it on at six. She\u2019ll love that.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Miriam said, into a room she could not see. The line clicked. The house lifted and settled with night.\n\nShe dressed for a small local gig in the back room of the Stag and Violet, a place that used to be a bakery and, if you stood in the right place, still smelled of yeast and sugar. She put on the navy jacket and a scarf like the underside of a pigeon\u2019s neck (slate, oil, tender greed). Bex was at the bar. So was a man who had once told Miriam with conviction that women could not really do folk music because women were the subject of the ballads and very rarely their author. She avoided him like a language she did not speak.\n\nShe took the tiny stage, the rug underfoot anchoring her to the simple world, and opened with the one she knew by spine. Two lines in, the room quieted. Mid-song, a phone somewhere at the back boomed with an alert\u2014a thick sound like a gong. Someone silenced it, embarrassed. And then, a second gong, softer, in her own pocket. She kept going because that was the law of the song. She kept going because she could. The law had clauses and loopholes. You could do both: sing and dread.\n\nAfter, she pulled her phone to the light and there it was, a message that had managed to be both too brief and too much: Are you with her? followed by the sender\u2019s name: Darragh, which had been in Tabby\u2019s phone once; she remembered because it had popped up while their mother\u2019s speech therapist had been trying to explain the difference between now and not-now.\n\nMiriam felt the room tilt like a tray of glasses. She typed: With whom. He typed back: Tab.\n\nShe called. He answered as if the world were a hallway in which everyone was always already pointing at him.\n\n\u201cIs she there,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t get her. Hasn\u2019t been right all day. You\u2019re her\u2014she listens to you.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere,\u201d Miriam said, and she sounded, even to herself, like a person on a newscast. \u201cWhy are you\u2014where did you last see her.\u201d\n\nHe exhaled a type of laugh that was not laughter. \u201cYou the police now,\u201d he said, and then, softer, more himself: \u201cSorry. It\u2019s just, she was with me. And then she wasn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe nature of people who leave rooms,\u201d Miriam said, anger making her precise. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a theological riddle, Darragh.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t be\u2014look, we were at the lock. She likes the lock. You know she likes the stupid lock. She makes me read the stupid plaque. We had tea from a flask because they\u2019re charging three ninety for dishwater now, and she\u2014she just. She said she was going for a pee\u2014sorry\u2014and then she didn\u2019t come back. And her phone\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you go looking,\u201d Miriam said, not trusting the next word to be calm.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m calling you, aren\u2019t I,\u201d he said, and then, realer, when he heard the temperature drop: \u201cYes. Yes I looked. Yes I went\u2014yes. She wasn\u2019t there. It\u2019s not a big lock. I walked the canal like a man with a metal detector. Then this bloke who walks a dog said he thought he saw\u2014look; I don\u2019t know. I probably did something wrong. I always do. Just\u2014if she\u2019s at yours, if she came to you, don\u2019t\u2013 don\u2019t grass me up for worrying.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care about your fear of shame,\u201d Miriam said. The kindness came back like a coat she shrugged on. \u201cIf she\u2019s here I\u2019ll call you. She isn\u2019t here.\u201d\n\nShe hung up, then, because you were allowed to in the end. Because the law of the song requires not only patience but also breath. She sat in the corridor outside the bar, where the fairy light transformer buzzed like distant bees, and called Tabby again. She said the thing she tried not to say: I\u2019m here. Tell me where.\n\nNothing.\n\nOn Sunday, the whole town put its bins out as if to show they had some say in things. Miriam made tea and walked with both mugs into the small garden that the estate agents had called generous and which was, sure enough, generous in the way a kind stranger is. She stood among the soft things and listened to her neighbor\u2019s radio announcing Trade deals and a goal in the ninety-third minute. She thought: perhaps this is just the drama we will tell of this week. Perhaps this is nothing that cannot be made smaller by time. Then she put down one mug and picked up her phone and wrote to Tabby the way you put out crumbs for birds. I will stop texting like this in an hour. I\u2019m not mad. Please be safe. Can I bring you the blue boots you like. You left your scarf. I\u2019m doing that one with the dag\u2014no, I promise I won\u2019t use the word on television.\n\nAn hour left her with nothing except a list of the times she\u2019d been there and the times she hadn\u2019t and the mathematics of guilt. She took out the postcard and propped it against a plant pot. Light where you left it. She had left light so many places. She touched the card with her index finger as if it might be a cat.\n\nThere was a rehearsal on Monday. Then flights and people standing in cold corridors. Then there was this life beside it, the one that did not have cameras. She thought she was managing both, like an acrobat with a plate that she kept spinning with one finger and a plate that she kept spinning with the other. She saw, all of a sudden, that she had left the table.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t catastrophize,\u201d Cal said on the phone that evening, voice careful like a person who has been told to carry a bowl. \u201cYou are very extremely qualified to catastrophize. Don\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe sent me a phrase we used when we were ten,\u201d Miriam said.\n\n\u201cShe might be making you a thing,\u201d he said. \u201cShe might be being romantic about your show. She might be\u2014she might be even doing a thing for herself where she switches off her phone to stop herself doing worse things. You don\u2019t know yet, Mir. Don\u2019t make the whole scaffolding.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know the scaffolding,\u201d she said. \u201cI built it in prior lives. I\u2019ve been to the top and thrown down bricks.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen, maybe don\u2019t climb it now,\u201d he said. \u201cMake food. Do the other thing. Sing.\u201d\n\nShe made food. She burned onions, which was unlike her. She sang a small thing to the pot, the way people used to. She thought of her mother saying in a soft voice: There must be a song for this. There\u2019ll be a song for everything.\n\nTwo days later they filmed her in a black room speaking to a black camera and the black room demanded that she become bigger to fill it. They called this part Hero Shots. She tried not to laugh. She tried to be heroic. \u201cI grew up,\u201d she said, \u201clistening to my mother sing while she stirred soup,\u201d and the camera, the stupid black lens of it, understood this. It liked her. It wanted her to be that person at eight p.m. on a Saturday with the country watching and judging and making tea during the adverts.\n\n\u201cThe audience love a story,\u201d Nadine said in the make-up chair, as a woman with cool hands made her face more of a surface and less of a face.\n\n\u201cThey are not wrong,\u201d Miriam said. \u201cI love stories. They just don\u2019t always happen to have the right narrative shape when you need them to. Sometimes the second act is just an email.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat does your heart want,\u201d the make-up woman asked, in the voice of a kindly tarot reader.\n\n\u201cTo do this and have it be my life for a night,\u201d Miriam said. \u201cAnd for my sister to be in the audience and not to have vanished into a hole in the path.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh,\u201d said the make-up woman, and time passed in a way that suggested sympathy.\n\nShe stood under the halo of the light in rehearsal and said; \u201cThis is a song about people keeping each other alive,\u201d and Rory in the corner with his headset said, \u201cLess death,\u201d and she said, \u201cIt\u2019s not death. It\u2019s the opposite. It\u2019s defiance,\u201d and he said, \u201cOkay, lovely, say defiance,\u201d and she laughed, because this is what people did. They translated their hearts into packaging.\n\nOn the busiest day of that week, when she had met three people who asked her whether she would be wearing anything sparkly and one who asked what her key demographic was, she got a text from a number she did not know. It was a photograph of her sister\u2019s scarf on a railing over water. It was the scarf, blue with white flecks like cod eggs, the one she had thought she\u2019d return. The photograph was well-composed, as if not entirely unkind. Beneath it, a single word: Sorry.\n\nShe called the number until it did not ring anymore. In the quiet between rings she heard her own voice in the rehearsal in her head saying defiance. The truth was a moving thing. The truth was someone\u2019s scarf, maybe not now on that railing, and someone\u2019s number that did not work, and a stage so close she could have put out a hand and adjusted the mic.\n\nThe dull town resumed around her, respectably. The bins were brought in; the buses made their insistent patience known in exhalations. She sat on the step with her grey post, the one you do not put in a bin, and found that she was humming so softly that even she could barely hear it. Something like the refrain of a song that had not yet worked out what it was for. Something like the tune you hum when you are walking at dusk and you don\u2019t really know what to do with your hands.\n\nShe had wanted, early on, to be unshakable. She had thought age would do that, the way a river makes a stone polite. But it turns out you are never finished. It turns out that learning and practice never end and you keep having to haul yourself into the shape of someone who can step onto a bright stage and call that place and the real world both true.\n\nHer phone rang again, within an hour, with the call that put everything in a certain new tense. The voice on the line belonged to a police officer who had the patience of someone training a plant. He said her name and then her sister\u2019s name and then his own name, and there were the words found, and no foul and yet, and for now, and could she. Could she get here. Could she bring.\n\nMiriam said yes to all of it. She said yes to the wrong questions and the right ones. She went upstairs and stood by the bed and did not remember, later, how she had picked up her shoes. She made herself look in the mirror. She said, softly, \u201cLight where you left it,\u201d and her voice sounded like a stranger\u2019s. Then she went out into a town that, if she squinted, was kind and beautiful and hers, and walked faster than dignity permits, because sometimes you must, until the pavement gave way to ground that did not deserve to be called path and the water, when it came into view, was all wrong, and yet, unmistakeably, the same water that had sat under a modest English sky for a hundred years, minding only its own business.\n\nSomewhere, a camera was being packed into a soft black bag. Somewhere, a producer was crossing out a name on a whiteboard and writing it back on again. Somewhere, her act was looping in an empty room: her voice layered with itself, her voice singing to her voice, a chain, a family, a very old trick of time. She thought then of what a song is: the promise you can leave for yourself in the dark; the light you might find again where you left it; the sound of someone coming up the stairs and saying your name in a tone that means you are known. And with that thought in her chest, not comfortable, not terrible, just a metal she could polish later, she went. She had never been ready for any of this. She had only been willing. It had been enough so far. Now, she asked the world to meet her halfway and to do the easiest thing it ever had to do: to let something be true when you said it out loud and waited.She moved before the sense of it had time to catch up. The house made the soft protesting noises of a thing left mid-breath: the lamp still on in the hall, the dishwasher sulking about being half-loaded. She took the blue boots because she had promised them; she took the scarf because that was ridiculous now but still like a charm you rub a thumb against; she took the postcard without thinking, slipped it between the pages of a library book like a wickedness. The officer had asked, in that careful way, for ID if she had it, for medication if she knew, for a calm relative if such a creature existed. She put her calm in her pocket with her keys and found it was lighter than advertised.\n\nOutside, rain the size of pinheads threaded the air. The pavement had its old chalky smell. The town had been up since before she had and was in the middle of its Saturday laundry: cars rinsed, pavements washing themselves into drains, the church clock making a tiny thunder of it. She walked as fast as you can without making it look like running away, and then stopped caring about what she looked like. Cal\u2019s voice existed somewhere between her left ear and her sensible heart saying breathe and she did, but it was a saw-toothed kind of thing. At the station she cut down instead of up, took the alley that smelt of wet cardboard and good intentions, and then she was on the long straight that ran under trees towards the river, a line lived in by dog walkers and people mending something internal with the rhythm of their feet.\n\nThe lock was not the one she would have chosen if she had been ten and allowed to make the day\u2019s choices. Sonning wore its wealth; it posed for photographs in nice light. This was smaller, more used, a mechanism knitted into a council\u2019s sense of itself. The sign was brown and educational; the plaque said something about Brunel without conviction. Someone had planted geraniums in an old lock gate beam and the geraniums, damp and cheerful, made a mad contrast with the water that had the colour of tea you would send back. There were three vans where there should have been none. Unmarked, except in the way that vans owned by public services always are: yellow chevrons, unflashy steadiness. Someone had strung blue-and-white tape that made the landscape look like it had been invited to a party.\n\nIt was not a circus. It was not even loud. A woman with a notebook was talking to a man whose jacket knew more rain than it knew dry. The water spoke the way it always spoke, impatient and without malice, hauling a skin of bubbles into existence and then destroying it with a professionalism that made you want to applaud.\n\n\u201cMs Blake?\u201d The officer who had phoned materialised out of a sort of patient grey. He had a collar that sat wrong on his neck and the kind of beard that made you think of brown birds. \u201cDetective Constable Ellison. Thank you for coming. I\u2019m sorry to bring you out. We think\u2014 well. If you\u2019re ready, there\u2019s a\u2014 we\u2019ve got her at the ambulance just now. She\u2019s cold and she\u2019s not saying a lot. We\u2019re not looking at an offence. We just\u2014 if you can sit, and we need your confirmation for the notes.\u201d\n\n\u201cNotes,\u201d she said, because the word seemed small enough to manage. \u201cOf course. She\u2014 she\u2019s\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIn one piece,\u201d he said, and the small mercy made a room in her chest wider. \u201cSomeone saw her by the railings. He says she seemed confused. He thought he saw her take her shoes off and he thought he saw\u2014 I don\u2019t want to put words in anyone\u2019s\u2026 We\u2019re not building a case. You know her. You know what\u2019s likely. The gentleman went for help. By the time anyone got to the exact spot, she wasn\u2019t where he thought. The dog walker\u2014 there\u2019s always a dog in these these\u2014 was the one who hears and says he sees someone slip. You know how the water here has that awful slow bit that\u2019s somehow faster than you think. River rescue were on in under five. It\u2019s not very\u2014 it isn\u2019t far. She\u2019s lucky. It\u2019s lucky. She\u2019s shivery and she\u2019s\u2014 she was laughing at one point, you know that laughter people do when it\u2019s all more than. Then she wasn\u2019t. She apologised to a traffic cone. So. Ambulance are keen on warming and on some observations. They\u2019ll ask their questions. You can be in the corner.\u201d\n\nIt was a lot of words to say in the rain. The rain did that thing where it takes an interest in the backs of your hands. Miriam tried to make her mouth remember to do its job. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t take anything regular,\u201d she said. \u201cPainkillers when she has to. A multivitamin if someone hands it to her. Wine, when she works a double and forgets that water exists. She\u2014 she reads everything, which sometimes looks like steady but sometimes it looks like falling down holes. No drugs, not that I know, not unless you count stubbornness and men called Darragh. Did he\u2014 has he\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHe phoned us,\u201d Ellison said, without tone. \u201cHe\u2019s here, actually. He\u2019s over there being devastated by a bollard. We\u2019ve got two statements that don\u2019t quite match yet but they\u2019re honest statements, which is more than plenty. Do you want to see her first or do you want to commit grievous bodily eye-rolls at your sister\u2019s personal life in the meanwhile.\u201d\n\n\u201cHer,\u201d Miriam said, and was already walking.\n\nThe ambulance made a small bright room in the rain. Steam lived on the inside of the windows like breath on a mirror. A woman with plaited hair and a frog sticker on her name badge lifted the corner of the blanket and said in a voice that had been trained on football terraces and nurseries, \u201cHere\u2019s your professor,\u201d and Tabby, ridiculous, beautiful, infuriating, turned her head.\n\nIt was both entirely her and not at all anyone she knew. Her hair, which was a promise to chaos at the best of times, had been made into terrible plaits by the water and its cold hands. Her face was pale and then, under it, another paleness. Her mouth did a shape that said I am here and also I am sorry. She was wrapped as if she belonged to the laundry, all white and corners. At the edge of the blankets you could see her feet, purpled and ancient like they were having a separate career. Her eyes, which could be sunshine when she wanted, were wet diamonds you would immediately pawn to get her safe.\n\n\u201cHey,\u201d she said, in her stupid old voice. \u201cHello, Mim.\u201d\n\n\u201cHello,\u201d Miriam said. There was a small ungenerous part of her that wanted to shake the ambulance until all its needles chimed. The rest of her moved forward with a blanket of its own. She put two fingers on Tabby\u2019s knuckles. \u201cYou were supposed to be in a chair somewhere reading about fairtrade soaps, you unutterable goat. You have given me\u2014 I have less hair than I had yesterday.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was with a chair,\u201d Tabby whispered, and the breath made her voice misbehave. \u201cI was with Darragh, but never for long. I think I\u2014 I think I fell in love with the railings, is the issue. And then I got wet. I have been told that my choices were suboptimal.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe is coherent,\u201d said Frog Badge, writing without looking at the paper, like a magician. \u201cShe is shivery and she is embarrassed. We like embarrassed. That means there is someone to be embarrassed. We\u2019re going to go to Royal Berks. You can come in the back if you promise to be furniture. She going to have words with anyone who likes forms, but we\u2019ll get the core done. She keeps saying she\u2019s sorry to every inanimate thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am,\u201d Tabby said, and shut her eyes as if exhausted by the effort. \u201cI was going to go and have a pee and then the universe did something. Don\u2019t make a thing,\u201d she added, eyes open again, urgent as foxes. \u201cDon\u2019t you make this into a thing with scaffolding.\u201d\n\n\u201cI refuse your permission to prevent me scaffolding this,\u201d Miriam said, evenly, because there were languages she showed to strangers and this was not one of them. \u201cI\u2019ll be a chair,\u201d she said to Frog Badge. \u201cThank you. Thank you for the chair.\u201d\n\nThe ride to Reading was a short novel in which not much happened and everything mattered. The road made the exact same curve it always made at the business park that had tried, twice, to rebrand itself by planting trees with names. The ambulance murmured to its innards. Tabby\u2019s breath, under the burr of diesel and air conditioning and other people\u2019s crises, was the only song Miriam trusted. Frog Badge asked questions that were a lullaby of bureaucracy: had she eaten, had she had a head injury ever, had she drunk something that tasted like irony. Tabby answered in increments, faithfully, almost cheerful. \u201cSorry,\u201d she said when she got off by a tone, then \u201coh god, I\u2019m sorry again,\u201d and the paramedic laughed and said, \u201cWe\u2019re delighted. Keep apologising. Keep that going.\u201d\n\nIn A&E the air smells, always, like disinfectant that has gotten ideas about itself and like coins. They were given a space that was a curtain and then a different space that was a chair. Things that were not about them happened at speed. An elderly man shouted a name that might have been his wife\u2019s or his dog\u2019s or a saint\u2019s. A child with a dinosaur on their T-shirt announced that blood was not supposed to be outside. Time performed its trick of being idiotically fast and impossibly slow simultaneously. A nurse took a series of numbers from Tabby and from the numbers decided to keep her. \u201cYou went lovely and cold,\u201d she said, kind as a biscuit with a past. \u201cWe\u2019ll warm you back to the right bit. Then we\u2019ll have a chat about why water thinks you are an ingredient.\u201d\n\nMiriam did the things that the grew-up parts of your life demand. She handed over the boots. She fielded a call from Darragh in the corridor where a poster asked her if she had checked her balls lately in an inclusive, determined font. He sounded like a boy who had not learned yet how to hold a glass with one hand. \u201cThey won\u2019t even let me in,\u201d he said, as if hospitals were gigs with a bouncer sexually jealous of his aura. \u201cI said I was family and they did that face.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are not family,\u201d Miriam said. \u201cTo them, to me, to paperwork. Stop making personnel do faces. Go home and change your wet socks. Don\u2019t text her for an hour unless you have to. Then text me. If a woman at a desk asks you to fill out a thing, fill it and don\u2019t draw cartoons in the margins. I will call you when it is not a corridor.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou think this was\u2014\u201d he began, and there laid its teeth the thing that had been scuttling along the skirting board of her mind since the call. \u201cShe didn\u2019t\u2014 I mean, she\u2019s not\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cShe is not a public health myth,\u201d Miriam said, and then, softer, because she could hear his exhale pulling against his ribs, \u201cI don\u2019t think she meant to. I don\u2019t think the railings mean anything except that the council will have to put up one more sign about common sense. We will ask the questions you can\u2019t ask because you turn them into a mime. Go home and eat something a person cooks. Don\u2019t drink. Consider that we all have to live after this, and you can be useful in that after if you behave like a tool with the right head.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I bring her fox socks?\u201d he said, in the miserable voice of a man negotiating with a god. \u201cShe likes the fox socks.\u201d\n\n\u201cBring them later,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen she is tired of all this and wants to be reminded that toes exist. Later, when the drama has had a nap.\u201d\n\nShe went back to the curtain and found a doctor with hair going grey in the neatest possible way, who could have been a sympathiser at an allotment meeting. He said the sensible words in the sensible order: mild hypothermia, observation, tests because the note-sheets are greedy and like a blood for luck. \u201cWe\u2019ll ask someone to have a proper wellbeing conversation,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t tend to leap to conclusions in either direction if we can help it. There\u2019s a lot of water and a lot of people who think next to water. Does she have someone she would like who is not you. No offence. Sometimes a different ear\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cShe would like me,\u201d Miriam said. \u201cAnd she would like to be told that she can be as alive as she in fact is without needing to prove it in wet. She would like to not be asked in front of a whiteboard whether she feels like a danger to herself. She would like to be asked at a window whether she feels like she\u2019s swallowed a small lake. She ought to be asked quietly if there were any precipitating events, and then I will glare at her until she tells you about the thing she tries to call not-a-thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow many sisters like you do you suppose we get in a day,\u201d he asked, not unkindly, and she laughed because she heard the absurdity of her tone and because that way you confess you have heard yourself and the doctor need not get his hackles up. \u201cWe\u2019ll do the human version,\u201d he said. \u201cThank you. Sit. Drink that tea someone might bring. Pretend you are the one in charge for a bit and then agree with the expert when they contradict you. She\u2019ll be fine. She is fine. But the bit with words is as important as the bit with blankets.\u201d\n\nWhen they were alone again, Tabby looked at her with the particular mix of challenge and plea that made Miriam want to cuff the past. \u201cI didn\u2019t,\u201d she said, as if she had been instructed to admit a thing she had not done. \u201cI promise you. Don\u2019t you put this into the box with the worst things. I went to look. I went to\u2014 the water does that thing. It looks like an answer whether or not you asked the question. I was talking to Darragh because he was saying a string of sentences that seemed as if they were about me and were obviously about something he read on a forum. And then he said the thing you hate, you know the thing, the bit where he says, \u2018You\u2019re too much for this,\u2019 and you\u2019re supposed to be grateful that he sees your intensity and is not a coward about it. And I wanted a world that isn\u2019t a pub or a bed or a fake plant in a restaurant, and the lock was there. And I took off my boots because I needed to put my bare feet on a thing that was not a man. And then I leaned. And the world shifted by a degree.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe world is a child you are not permitted to spin,\u201d Miriam said, and then caught herself because she wasn\u2019t there to do an allegory. \u201cAnd you,\u201d she said, and it came out like a prayer and a scold. \u201cYou send me a postcard like a cryptic crossword and a scarf-on-railing like a stage direction, and you expect me not to dress the set.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t send the scarf,\u201d Tabby said. \u201cI can barely work my own phone when it\u2019s dry. Darragh texted you the other night when I left my pocket on the bar. He\u2019s a man who thinks other people\u2019s boundaries are an experiment. But the postcard, yes. That was me. I stuffed it under your door because it felt like you were going off into a room with a lot of lights where they might decide which bits of you counted and I wanted\u2014 I wanted to put a beacon in your pocket. Sad that I have invented anxiety theatre by mistake. Don\u2019t make the face. You\u2019d have a face if I bought you a lighthouse.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour handwriting is better when you\u2019re not cold,\u201d Miriam said, because there were seventy other sentences that wanted to get out and this one seemed like the least likely to set the curtain on fire. \u201cDon\u2019t do this again. Or if you must do water, do bath. Do tea. Do soup. Do cold peas on a bruise. If you need wind, put your head out of a window and shout at a pigeon. Or come and shout at me. I will be a better pigeon than the river.\u201d\n\nTabby laughed then, a small unspooling sound, and put her head back against the pillow as if she had found the exact place her skull had been kept for her. For a moment, it looked like the kind of laugh they used to do in the evening when they were meant to be going to bed and had instead chosen to turn all the tops of the felt pens upside down so that in the morning their mother would swear, very politely, like a woman doing a crossword who discovers that all the clues have been replaced by teeth.\n\nThe police did come and do questions, but they did them in a way that made her like Detective Ellison more. He stood with his notebook like a man who has decided to keep it forever so it must be used with ceremony and did not write the word suicide even once on a page that did not warrant it. He asked whether she had meant to go in and she said no, like a woman proud of a number she\u2019d got right in maths. He asked whether she had ever done anything like this before and she said no, unless you count when she tried to ride a shopping trolley down a slope at fourteen because someone called Eddie had made the trolley look like church. He asked about the photo and Miriam handed over the number written on the back of a wrapper she had pulled out of her coat like a magician producing lint. He made the old joke about it always being an 07 and then he stood it aside and said they\u2019d look and that if he had his way the world would contain fewer railings and more beds.\n\nHe left them in a way that suggested he could be phoned again without it being a betrayal of mood. Outside the curtain someone dropped a tray and four people said \u201cSorry\u201d like bells. A woman with an arm in a sling explained loudly to her boyfriend that she had texted his mother because in a crisis you go to the person who knows what to do with chicken. It was all so outrageously ordinary that Miriam felt suddenly and inexplicably grateful to every notice stuck to a wall with a thumb tack. Don\u2019t leave children on trolleys. Remember your prescription. If you are experiencing chest pains and are over forty-five, please tell us in the next six minutes. She would have married any of those sentences, given the chance.\n\nWhen she went for tea a nurse with eyebrows like punctuation said, \u201cWe saw you on that promo. The Night Stage. It\u2019ll be on the telly. Are you doing that thing with the pen?\u201d Miriam said she was and the nurse said, \u201cYou nearly made me crash the trolley when I watched it, but don\u2019t do it now; you\u2019ll give me palpitations and then we\u2019ll have to triage me and that\u2019s just\u2014 no,\u201d and then handed her a tea that was extraordinary for containing such an amount of milk she could have floated in it.\n\nNadine rang and did her voice that sits the right side of giddy. \u201cWe can push rehearsal by two hours,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ll move a comedian. They always think they go last; it\u2019s like some law.\u201d There was a pause and then the voice went a notch warmer, the zone producers use when they suspect a human is being a human. \u201cDo you\u2014 if you want to\u2014 I mean, if your sister is a part of your story that you want to\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cShe is a part of my life I wish to keep,\u201d Miriam said, and softened the flatness with breath. \u201cI know what you mean. Maybe. Let\u2019s not put a camera in a corridor. I will bring her to wave at you from a seat with consent that has bubbles around it. We will make a sign, and she will enjoy making the sign, and then when I say defiance you can put in a shot of her pretending to be bored. Don\u2019t put any water in a montage or I will set my loop station on fire and call it art.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would watch that,\u201d Nadine said, and then she was wise enough to not to say anything else except, \u201cWe can fetch you on a bike or a cloud. Tell me what you need.\u201d\n\nIn the end the need was small: a hotel room with a bed that didn\u2019t do the thin duvet thing and a kettle that didn\u2019t smell of fish. Tabby agreed, without her usual scroll of conditions, to take Miriam\u2019s couch for a few days. She could see the care home from Miriam\u2019s upstairs window, she said. She liked the sight of it, a ship in port. She would go visit their mother in the morning and explain, in a voice calibrated to parenthood and sweetness, that she had gone for a very stupid paddle, that someone had told her off gently, that everything was boring now as requested. She would stay off the internet and away from Darragh for seventy-two hours and then decide whether men named after hills were an object for a future.\n\nThey got discharged late with paperwork like a novella. A woman at the desk had a collection of ceramic frogs that would have made the frog on the paramedic\u2019s badge feel part of a movement. In the car park the air had the sour-sweet smell of things that have been closed for too long and might, at any moment, open. On the way home Tabby fell asleep with the radio on and Miriam drove like a person carrying something on a tray that could not be spilled. Her hands on the wheel were the exact hands that had held a mouse at a university computer twenty hours ago, and that was a different country with different laws.\n\nAt home Eileen appeared as if out of a Emile Zola novel about neighbourliness with soup and with a bag of bread rolls that had been cut on the diagonal, because presentation matters even when the protagonist is despair. She looked at Tabby with the precise courage of a woman who has prayed for people and found that prayer is better at making the person who does the praying feel less ridiculous than it is at doing the work. \u201cYou gave us all a fright,\u201d she said, and Tabby said, \u201cI know, I know, I\u2019m so\u2014\u201d and Eileen raised a hand without touching and said, \u201cNo sorry. I\u2019ve been instructed by a professional to stamp on apologies like cockroaches. Eat soup and be seen.\u201d\n\nThey ate soup and were seen. The couch announced its springs. The blue scarf hung over the radiator like it had staged its own rescue. Miriam put the postcard on the mantelpiece partly to make it answer for itself and partly because it seemed to scratch every surface it was put upon if hidden away. They didn\u2019t say much. They watched a programme in which people pretend to hate each other for a cake and found it soothing. When it was time to sleep, Tabby\u2019s breathing went out like a bread garnish on an old soup, and she slept the sleep of people who have had actual drama rather than theoretical. Miriam lay awake longer because that is the deal you sign when you are the one responsible for filling out the forms and being the chair.\n\nShe went downstairs once, the house dark and agreeable, and sat with the loop station like it was a person. She put down a single line with her voice so quiet she could feel the vibration more than she could hear it, something like a humming to a kettle. She added to it a soft percussive touch with her fingertips on the wooden table, the old sound of wood considering itself a drum. She put, under that, the breath the ambulance had made her listen for. It built. It didn\u2019t grow showy. It just made a basket for her thoughts to climb into. And when she stopped it, the room did that beautiful thing again, that fall into a silence that feels like acceptance. If she was telling a story to the camera, she might one day tell that, and not the way the paramedic wrote without looking, or the way Detective Ellison hid his notebook like a sacrament. She might tell the truth that the most defiant thing sometimes is to be quiet and not fill it.\n\nMorning was crisp and mean, like a skeleton trying on a cardigan. Tabby, contrary, woke singing, very quietly and quite off-key, which meant her nose was still not fully decided about breathing. She made a face at her own breath and said, \u201cYou are going to be obscene on television.\u201d Miriam told her she\u2019d only promised to be moderately scandalous and Tabby said, \u201cCall it obscene anyway; it reads better on placards,\u201d and then put the kettle on like a note returned to a tune after a long bridge.\n\nThey worked out a plan that had pillars. Between the pillars were rubber bands because that was realistic. Tabby would ring Darragh and say the thing people in respectable pamphlets advise you to say when you want everyone to continue existing: \u201cI need to be in a different room for a bit.\u201d Miriam would go to rehearsals with a suitcase and a list. Eileen would be their neighbour with the extra key and the knowing look that said she would call the fire brigade if she thought a candle had impure thoughts. They texted the care home and got three heart emojis and a photograph of their mother\u2019s hand holding a spoon as if it were the stem of a flower. They put the fox socks in the bag because Miriam is not a purist and no person is entirely a metaphor.\n\nAt Hammersmith the river braided itself with light as if it were trying jewellery. The venue was a theatre pretending to be a television and vice versa. The foyer did an impression of an airport and the backstage was\u2014 as always\u2014 part village hall, part spaceship. Nadine met them with a lanyard and an expression that was about fifty percent good auntie and fifty percent woman who had found out at breakfast that one of her jugglers had sprained something precious. Tabby wore her coat like armour and walked slightly ahead as if daring the building to find her a seat she was not equal to. She did not flirt with any of the security men which suggested either a new phase in her life or an excess of tiredness that might have put her on a scale.\n\n\u201cIs this the sister,\u201d Vee said, appearing like a cat from the high bits. \u201cYou look like the person he wrote the poem about.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no he,\u201d Tabby said, carrying herself with a dignity that still had jam in its hair. \u201cThere are only men who have yet to be instructed to bring fox socks. Nice spine, by the way.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks,\u201d Vee said brightly. \u201cI borrowed it from a whale.\u201d\n\nOn the stage Miriam did the walking to and fro that looked like trying on a pair of shoes that were the exact size and yet made your toes think about the future. She built the song to a point and then spoke, trying to hit the strange smile that lives between So this is me and Please don\u2019t forget to choose someone kind after me. It would be, she decided, the Barbara Allen after all. Not the first, no; but later, and she would steal its refrain and make it something that was not death but its cousin, the long refusal. Rory in the corner made a noise with his mouth as if to begin a sentence and she said, with a grin that made his mouth stop, \u201cWe will call it a ballad without the corpse,\u201d and he made the sign with his hand that meant he was both exasperated and proud like a younger brother.\n\nShe came off-stage to Tabby perched on a plastic chair expediently eating a sandwich like a sparrow eats a planet. Tabby said, with her poshest mouth, \u201cThat will do it,\u201d and Miriam said she hoped so and Tabby said, \u201cNot for them, for you,\u201d as if she had a share portfolio in Miriam\u2019s soul.\n\nIn the unexciting hour between sound check and the bit where someone asked her to be filmed pretending to walk into the building, Detective Ellison rang back. He had a number for her that made the unknown number not unknown. \u201cIt was the dog walker,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s called Owen. He didn\u2019t know where the thing was and he found your sister in his phone because she left it in a pocket and he believes in God and in good deeds. He took the picture to show us where because he is tidy. He said sorry because he thought photos of despair are rude. It turns out it was a picture of a scarf. We have told him he is a citizen. I said I\u2019d tell you because there were shapes, and sometimes it takes someone with badge to say the shape is not the shape you think it is.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d she said, and meant it with the whole breadth of her. \u201cTell him his God did useful work on the Kennet today. Tell him I have a postcard about light that I am trying not to get superstitious about.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am trying not to be superstitious about my football team,\u201d he said, with unearned intimacy. \u201cWe can try together. Good luck with your singing. Make them cry.\u201d\n\nShe did not intend to make anyone cry. She intended to do the precise thing you do when you take a bunch of vibrations and coax them into a shape and make a room agree with you that there is a universe where breath lives longer than an advert. She intended to make Tabby forget water. She intended to put the light where she had promised and see if it remained when the camera turned away.\n\nLater, when the heads of the producers were small dots with teeth and she was back in her dressing room with a bulb-ringed mirror that appeared to have been built by an enthusiastic minor god, Tabby knocked in a way that made the door do a tiny dance and came in with a sign she had made using three colours and an unjustified number of exclamation marks. It said: MIM BLAZE, which was not her name and yet was a better name than she\u2019d ever come up with in an emergency. Tabby had drawn flames that looked like a child\u2019s attempt at drawing kelp. She put the sign in the corner by the flowers that had arrived with a note from the department that said clever things about medieval but made her want to kiss them all on the crown.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to ask you one more time about what your heart wants,\u201d Tabby said. \u201cWhatever you do, don\u2019t say soup. They\u2019ll cut it next to a clip of someone crying over juggling.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will say defiance,\u201d Miriam said, and then she reached for her sister\u2019s hand and squeezed it in the way you squeeze a thing to see how solid it is. \u201cAnd love, possibly. And the wind. And the loop of a song that does not let you drown even when you lean too far. I might say railings.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you say railings,\u201d Tabby said, \u201cI will have to marry one out of pity.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou would,\u201d Miriam said. \u201cYou would elope with municipal infrastructure.\u201d And the two of them laughed the kind of laughter that frightened nobody and made the room increase.\n\nShe had not done the thing yet. The stage was a promise with a queue. The world outside was doing bins and buying onions. Her mother was, somewhere, being sung to by a carer who had decided that the word daisies was good luck. A detective who loved a football team was trying not to read omens into the colour of the sky. A dog who had done a good deed was possibly being given bacon under a table. And Miriam, who had thought once that all you could do was become unshakable, understood now that what you do is become willing and then stay. She looked at the postcard propped against the mirror, its plum sea an exaggeration of English water, and said aloud, because sometimes you tell the truth into glass before you say it into air, \u201cLight where you left it,\u201d and the words sounded thriftily beautiful. Then she put on the navy jacket, the one that made her shoulders look like a decision, and went to war with a room by using a melody that had survived worse than television.They called it a holding room as if it were designed to catch people whose thoughts might otherwise spill. It had a sofa that belonged in a regional dentist and a water cooler that made noises like a fretful animal. Miriam moved around it with practiced politeness, stepping over cables the way city people step over puddles. The loop station sat on the low table like a tame creature that might remember its wilder cousins if you startled it. Nadine came in and out on her soft shoes, adjusting the world by quarter turns. Rory appeared in her doorway to test his headset against her calm. He did not ask her not to say medieval. He said, instead, \u201cWhen you say defiance, imagine you\u2019ve just remembered where you put your keys. It should sound like relief as much as fight.\u201d\n\n\u201cRelief,\u201d she said, and rolled the word on her tongue as if testing for stones. \u201cI can do relief.\u201d\n\nTabby had been installed by an usher with a kindness diploma in Row G, seat 17, because 17 made the usher happy for reasons of numerology or lunchtime quizzes. She sent a photograph of her own knees and the way the stage looked between the heads and then a second photograph that was just a blur of lights and the corner of her sign. Miriam pretended to find it entirely legible and texted back an emoji she had learned from her students that meant, variously, may your timing align with your heart and also this has made me laugh unexpectedly and will save me through a committee. Cal sent a selfie of himself and Bex at The Crooked Wren where the landlord had put the volume up so high that you could hear the sound of someone clapping and think it was weather. Eileen wrote: We are in. Mr Hughes says the devil is in it but he has laid out crisps. The care home replied with a photograph of their mother\u2019s hand and a note saying We are prepared to be astonished in a tone that made Miriam imagine the whole room leaning forward at once.\n\nShe did the rituals that, uninspected, might have looked like superstition. She tuned the concertina with the care of a person whose hands must remember an old friend\u2019s face. She put the pen in the pocket where it would not be rattled into announcing itself. She warmed her voice so gently the air barely lifted to meet it. She looked once at the postcard propped against the mirror and lowered her eyes because glass had a way of asking you questions you were not prepared to answer. When a woman with a clip board and a pen like a conductor\u2019s baton came to the door and said, \u201cWe\u2019ll take you to stand by,\u201d Miriam stood and discovered that her legs had remained serviceable. She lifted the loop station case and felt the weight settle into a place on her body that knew how to carry.\n\nBackstage had the ordinary glamour of an organized kitchen. People moved without collision. Someone breathed into their cupped hands like a person about to sit an exam. A man with a square jaw made shapes with his mouth that suggested vowels were something he polished. The corridor hummed with electricity and starch. She saw Vee stretching in a sideways doorframe like punctuation and gave her a grin that came back twice the size. The floor manager walked her onto the wings, and the stage opened its dark mouth as if prepared to swallow or confess.\n\nThe host\u2019s voice filled the room with a warm varnish. He had a way of saying names that made you believe you had always been famous. He said Professor without making it sound like a promise that could not be kept. The soft story they had filmed in Wokingham began on the big screen and she watched herself in public through a crack in the scenery, a tiny woman peering at a version of herself that had been taught to look a certain way on purpose. There she was touching vegetables like a Victorian tourist in a market. There she was in her office next to the stern-watched poster of Daphne Oram, saying a sentence about mouths and inheritance that seemed truer now that there were ten thousand bodies attached to the listening.\n\n\u201cHere she is,\u201d the host said, and his hand did that odd, expensive gesture as if releasing pigeons. The floor manager made a circle with her finger. Miriam walked into the light, and the light held.\n\nThe room received her as if it had been taught how. The audience made the sound audiences make when they are not certain whether to applaud now or later, then did both. The panel arranged their faces into interest. The camera crane moved like a slow polite bird. Miriam put the loop station down like a small altar, took her place behind the mic, and discovered again the exact shape of her lungs.\n\n\u201cHello,\u201d she said, because you always start with something smaller than the thing itself. \u201cI sing old songs in new ways. I like the ones that have learned how to survive. This is a song about people keeping each other alive. It\u2019s about defiance,\u201d and she did not look at Rory in the wings, because if you give relief too much attention it might leave.\n\nShe began with the small percussive, a tap-tap with the pen on the spine of a book she had brought because it had the right body, thick paper with a yielding grain. The room adjusted its breathing. She laid down the concertina\u2019s low line, catching it on the loop a whisper before the end of the fourth bar, that small magic that made the machinery serve the ear and not the other way around. Then the higher voice, close and close enough to be uncomfortable until it was necessary. She added the tick of fingernails on wood, the soft mechanical click that sounded like a distant footfall in a hallway. The pattern was a net. She stepped into it.\n\nShe sang the refrain she had stolen and altered, the place where Barbara Allen refuses death made into a gentle, stubborn no to something else. She did not make a corpse. She made a promise. \u201cOh love,\u201d she sang, \u201coh heart of mine, not yet, not yet,\u201d and a hundred heads tipped a degree as if the words had bumped a memory. She slipped her own line in beneath it, almost like a joke for three people who were listening for it: \u201cLight where you left it,\u201d she sang, not verbose, just the words like a prayer in a pocket, and the loop took that line and held it the way you hold the beginning of a thought when you are getting your coat and not losing your keys.\n\nThe room did what rooms do when sound organizes them. It leaned forward. The panel\u2019s faces altered with human concentration. She saw, without looking hard, the shimmer that was Tabby\u2019s sign and beneath it her sister\u2019s face, softer than a few days ago and more alive than yesterday had let her believe. She added a line of her own voice in the low register that only arrived by mid-afternoon, the one that made people say things like rich as if they had tasted it. She lifted the melody up once and then refused to lift it again, letting it argue for the ground. She sang the refrain and the loop sang back, imperfect and faithful, and she heard the absurdity of it\u2014her voice holding her voice up\u2014and found it beautiful enough to make her think about crying later when no one had lights and clipboards.\n\nWhen she stopped, the room held the silence that follows music when it has done its job. It was not long. It was long enough to feel like a natural phenomenon. The applause came like weather. She bowed with a care that felt properly stern, as if what had just happened had to be asked to remain in the room for a while.\n\nThe host came in smiling like a person claiming to have found a small coin in a fountain and invited the panel to say their sanctioned human things. The woman at the far end with the kind mouth said, \u201cThat felt like a spell someone made to use in kitchens,\u201d and then apologized as if to a skeptic, and Miriam said, \u201cI\u2019m not offended by spells,\u201d and the room laughed in that relieving way that means they have permission to be serious and then to laugh and then serious again. The middle panelist, who was paid to be abrupt, said something about risk that was actually admiration and then caught himself and reframed it as competition. The comic at the left said, \u201cI feel like stationery has been hiding its talents,\u201d and she said, \u201cIt\u2019s all about the right pen,\u201d and the host said, \u201cVote now if you think she brought the light where\u2014\u201d and then checked himself, as if worried he had made a private thing public, and finished with something about should she be in your final three. The country, variously, dialed.\n\nBackstage, the sound man found her hand without quite intending to and squeezed it with a professionalism that could not entirely hide affection. \u201cYou did the thing,\u201d he said, which in his language meant you did not let the machines show. Nadine, who had been standing still for eight minutes like a person trying to prevent a cake from falling, exhaled and said, \u201cThey cut to your sister when you said that line and I\u2019m going to take the credit as if I orchestrated a Roman triumph,\u201d and Miriam said, \u201cYou can have the drums,\u201d and Nadine said, \u201cI\u2019ll have the banner.\u201d\n\nHer phone, in the small quiet after, discovered it had friends. Cal sent a cascade of capital letters that looked like a man falling down stairs while singing. Bex wrote: I have a fringe now because of you. The students were dramatic and sweet, the feed full of screenshots with circles and arrows as if what mattered could be held steady with punctuation. Detective Ellison texted a single woo that surprisingly read like a man who had not shouted woo in a while and found he liked the way his mouth made the shape. The care home sent a short video of their mother, head bent, fingers doing an absent-minded two-three on the arm of the chair that matched the rhythm from the loop, and the carer\u2019s voice, off-camera, making a small sound that might have been a laugh or a prayer.\n\n\u201cDo not cry,\u201d Tabby said, in the wardrobe department with its smell of hardwork glamour, appearing like a person summoned by a thought. \u201cDon\u2019t do it. You\u2019ll have to retouch and then the make-up woman will have to knead your face like dough and you\u2019ll resent butter for a month. You were obscene in the correct manner. You need to eat something that has one syllable. Bread. Chip. Cheese.\u201d\n\n\u201cI said the line,\u201d Miriam said, and heard the rational childishness of her own pride.\n\n\u201cYou did,\u201d Tabby said, and her eyes did that brief glass thing that runs you through like a small sword. \u201cYou did it like a person who had asked permission and then forgot to care. I took it as mine, by the way. I am perfectly willing to share but I will be litigating if I see it printed on a throw cushion.\u201d\n\nThey watched the others from a gap in a curtain, two faces in the dark like conspirators in a very low-stakes heist. Vee looked like a question mark at war with gravity and made the room remember it had spines. The boy with the toy piano played something that sounded like what sadness does when it thinks no one is looking and people who believed in grown-up instruments leaned forward as if they had been fooled and were grateful. The comedian redeemed his rehearsal with a story about teaching his mother to use voice notes that made half the room confess, with their laughter, to having said something unforgivable to a machine.\n\nThe voting was a slow machine with a sincere smile. The hosts did the mathematics with faces trained to make numbers look friendly. Names were called and faces did the thing that faces are paid for. Miriam stood with her loop station case in her hand and Tabby\u2019s fingers dug into her other palm as if to keep her in the building when the room tilted. When her name was called for the top three she made the noise you make when you open a drawer and find something you didn\u2019t know you\u2019d lost and also didn\u2019t know you cared about. When another name won\u2014because it did, the boy with precise hands who played the toy piano with such seriousness it made people want to be careful of cups\u2014she felt the feeling she had rehearsed in her sensible brain but not in her blood: the odd mixture of relief that the tent had been parcelled elsewhere and a small ache like a bruise in an obvious place. She clapped like a citizen. She turned to Tabby, who had expected both possible worlds and was prepared for the work of both.\n\n\u201cYou got the thing you came for,\u201d Tabby said, not permitting argument. \u201cYou got to make ten thousand people hold their breath and not because something had fallen over. You got to write yourself back onto your own face. The rest is men in offices, and everyone knows men in offices will eventually, given exposure to decent chords, do the right thing.\u201d\n\nThe after-rooms were the jostle you get when a wedding and a school play have a baby. People shook hands for no reason and took pictures to prove that strangers fade less quickly than you think. Nadine\u2019s scarf had an extra loop to it that suggested she had rescued something from a ledge by the judicious use of lists. Rory looked like a man who had met his bedtime and negotiated an extension with good grace. The panel were whisked away by people who moved fast without seeming to move and the hosts were suddenly in different shoes. Someone handed Miriam a bottle of water with her name spelled right on a sticker and she thought that, even if no other commemorative objects existed, this was satisfactory in its way. Vee hugged her with the bendiness of an emotion and said, \u201cYou owed me nothing and you repaid me with my own spine. That\u2019s good interest,\u201d and the boy with the piano shook her hand gravely, two-handed, like a small mayor opening a library.\n\nA producer with a pen in his pocket as if storing a spare rib materialized to talk in the voice of potential. He said there was a festival in a field that would find her comforting and alarming in equal measure and could only benefit from such tension. He said there was a woman at a radio station who liked to pretend she discovered people and would enjoy pretending. He said if Miriam wanted to talk about an album there was a man who understood microphones like other people understand types of cheese and had a barn with a temperament. Miriam, in a mood she recognized from rare good days in committee, said yes and then trimmed it to perhaps and then widened it with possible and then tucked three business cards into the pocket of the jacket that made her feel like a correct version of herself.\n\nThey waited until they could go home without apologizing to the people who had put the lights away. They walked out onto the river path where the air had changed temperature as if someone had enacted a policy. The Thames glowed like a thing pretending to be obedient. Tabby took her arm and then let it go and then took it again because that is how sisters demonstrate both independence and dependence without embarrassing either.\n\n\u201cDarragh texted,\u201d Tabby said, looking like a person who had not quite made peace with choosing not to perform. \u201cHe said he cried watching a dog food advert and thinks he is not safe to be in charge of his own heart. I told him to buy a lamp and learn its ways. I said he could bring the fox socks on Wednesday if he promised to say nothing that sounds like a slogan. He replied with six fox emojis and an apology to the concept of water.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou gave him an assignment,\u201d Miriam said. \u201cThat is healthy. People behave when they are given stationary tasks.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought you said stationery was a percussive instrument,\u201d Tabby said, pleased with herself, and Miriam conceded the point.\n\nEileen had left a note on the hall table written on the back of the council leaflet about roadworks. It said: We cheered when the panel talked like grown-ups. Mr Hughes still thinks the devil is in it but would like you to know that the devil has good diction. There is a casserole in your oven that will be ready when it claims it is ready and not before. P.S. Your mother clapped on two and four and then on one and three. She is a modernist. Sleep. It was both domestic and epic, which is to say it felt like their life.\n\nThey ate the casserole in bowls like people who did not need plates because there were no people to impress. For a while they sat on the floor because there are evenings when you revert to a simpler furniture. The loop station had been put back in its case with unusual reverence and the house made a different tone, as if it were aware of having been left and then found to have managed without you.\n\n\u201cTomorrow we\u2019ll go see her,\u201d Tabby said around a spoonful, already in the act of planning, which was her version of gratitude. \u201cWe\u2019ll take the fox socks even if I haven\u2019t accepted them because your mother is not someone to be cheated of novelty. We\u2019ll take biscuits that look cheap but are actually edible. We\u2019ll sing two verses of something that was not stolen by an advert. We\u2019ll come home before dark because look at us, we are women who respect circadian rhythms.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou say \u2018your mother\u2019 as if we have been assigned the parent in turns,\u201d Miriam said, tenderly, because there were versions of this sentence that she would not have survived if Tabby had chosen them. \u201cWe will do all of that. We will call Detective Ellison and tell him that football is not a superstition and that the Kennet owes him nothing anyway. We will write a thank-you card to a man called Owen who is now stuck in our lives like a helpful burr. We will put the postcard back in its place and not interrogate it. We will, at some point, sleep.\u201d\n\nThey cleaned in a way that fooled neither of them into thinking they had done any serious work and then went to their beds, or to their places that were approximately beds, and lay for a few minutes with the lights off like people in a play practising breathing. Miriam\u2019s phone vibrated in the soft dark with a voice note from Nadine that just said, with no varnish, \u201cThank you,\u201d and then a second from Rory that said, \u201cApologies if this is not my place, but that was the bit where I started believing that television might be useful,\u201d and she listened to them twice because repeating things in the night is a way to put them into a story that does not get deleted when you wake.\n\nSleep came like a patient bus. It was not the kind that arrives triumphantly and demands to be admired; it was the kind that does its job. Her dreams were not heroic. She wrapped a cable carefully into a circle that did not kink. She wrote a list for a man who needed to remember bread. She held her sister\u2019s hand in a river that had been imagined by a child who had run out of blue crayons. In the dream, the water did not take anything it was not entitled to.\n\nMorning arrived, as mornings do, without asking for her opinion. The kettle made its small theatre. The first headline she saw on her phone had lifted her name into that public place where names can be knocked about, but the article, against the odds, was precise and generous. The writer had done the odd thing journalists sometimes do, which is watch without wanting to win at it. They called her set a patient wonder and asked people not to clap along next time in case they frightened the quiet. Miriam smiled into her mug and put the phone down face-first like a person protecting a delicate plant from frost.\n\nOn the way to the care home, carrying biscuits and a tolerance for over-warm rooms, they passed the charity shop where the mirror still leaned in the window like a flirt. The woman with the ethics looked up and did two thumbs, an unBritish gesture she had made habitual, and Tabby blew her a kiss she could catch without consequences. When they reached the building with its decent chairs and its insistence on soft edges, a carer with a pin in her hair and a pair of reading glasses she wore on a chain led them to their mother with the pride of a curator.\n\nShe was a winter person now, their mother. The summer is there in her sometimes like a rumor. She looked up when they arrived and found something in Miriam\u2019s face that made her eyebrows do the small wave they had done in 1992 when someone had asked whether dinner would be pasta again and she had decided to forgive the past. Miriam sat and took the hand that did the clapping, and Tabby sat and put the fox socks where the fingers could find them later. \u201cOn the telly,\u201d the carer said, and their mother said, \u201cYou,\u201d like a person identifying an object in a cupboard that has been moved too high and forgiven for it.\n\nThey sang, not very loudly and not very in tune and with a sense of the appropriate for a room that had other people\u2019s stories in it. Their mother\u2019s voice came like a moth to light, then sat a minute and rested, then came again from a corner. Miriam did the refrain and Tabby did a harmony that was illegal in several counties. A man across the room who had once run a fish stall in Reading whistled and someone else coughed a verdict. It was not television. It was not even a parish hall. It was a small room where the promise of song did the modest work of occupying an hour.\n\nOn the way out, when they had promised nothing extravagant and signed the sheet that meant they might be supervised by someone else\u2019s plan if sirens ever came, Tabby paused by the noticeboard where the calendar reminded people of sherry and a dog on Thursdays. She looked at a poster that said We can be brave every day in a font that meant well and said, \u201cYou\u2019ll do it again,\u201d not looking at Miriam. \u201cNot like that, not even like this. You\u2019ll do it in a different room and someone will look at you like you\u2019ve told them where to put the lamp.\u201d\n\n\u201cPerhaps,\u201d Miriam said, not wishing to be heroic in the foyer of a care home. \u201cPerhaps I will just make soup and teach Miranda to use her eyeliner for good. Perhaps I will answer emails with unusual good grace. Perhaps I will get a cat and name it after a 14th-century poetic form that I will only be allowed to mention at dinner parties if the host is unwise.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re allowed to want the field and the light,\u201d Tabby said, as if the sentence were an ordinary instruction about turning off the tap. \u201cYou\u2019ve demonstrated you can be seen and not evaporate. Go on then. Evaporate a tiny bit. Then condense as a drizzle where we can find you.\u201d\n\nThey walked into a day that had decided on weather and kept it. The river, elsewhere, kept its counsel. The loop station waited on its shelf like a creature that would not leave if not invited. Miriam thought about defiance and about relief and about how poor television is at recording either in a way that can be kept in a drawer. She thought about Detective Ellison\u2019s woo and the sound of the care home\u2019s air conditioning and the way Nadine\u2019s scarf had looked at the end of the night like someone had wrapped twenty thoughts and kept them from blowing away. She thought about the postcard and decided it could stay in its frame for a week without being asked to stand trial.\n\nIn her office on Monday, the ivy plant had found another inch of window and the poster of Daphne Oram looked as if she had changed her mind about a chord and was tempted to try it. Students drifted by the door with a different kind of curiosity; some of them peered in and did a thumbs-up with the solemnity of a ritual. In her inbox, the emails separated themselves like lentils picked over in a kitchen, the urgent ones making themselves shiny, the friendly ones sitting in a small pile waiting to be handled. The subject lines contained congratulations that made her feel older in a nice way and invitations that made her feel like a person with shoes that fit.\n\nShe opened a blank document and wrote a title she would delete in an hour: Things Continuing. She made a list with bullet points that were not bullets, merely dots, and at the end of it she wrote the word nothing and then crossed it out with the neatness of a person who has learned not to give words the power to be too dramatic. When Cal tapped the door jamb and leaned in, carrying coffee he had purchased at a cafe with a tilting green sign that always forgot to wipe its chalkboard, she felt the place in her body that had been resisting soften.\n\n\u201cCeleb,\u201d he said, with the exact amount of mockery. \u201cAre you still a professor or have you ascended.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have ascended to a moderately improved coffee,\u201d she said, and he held his out and they clinked like children. \u201cI am thinking about a field.\u201d\n\n\u201cA field,\u201d he said. \u201cIs this metaphorical or is there a farmer who needs your voice to move cows.\u201d\n\n\u201cA festival,\u201d she said. \u201cIn a field that is temporarily not a field. Someone in a scarf and with a spreadsheet says they want me to be their nightingale. Do you think I can be a nightingale if my best hour is three in the afternoon.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can be a robin,\u201d he said. \u201cRobins sing all the time and will stab a man for crumbs. Also, the nurse who watched you told me not to tell you this but you caused a trolley incident. This is your carnage.\u201d\n\nThey drank their coffee and worked out a plan for keeping basic life alive under the new ornamental additions. She would keep her office hours. She would mark without trying to see how many fractions of herself she could fit in the margins. She would go to London twice a week for a while and not beat herself for liking it. She would send an email to the boy with the piano that said something like you made my hands behave and not worry whether it sounded odd.\n\nAnd when she walked home that evening along the same long green and the same small chalk of path, she found, under the old familiar sense that this was a place that would hold anything you spilled, a new line she had laid down and could not undo. It was not fame, which is a noise and then an absence. It was not a story, which is a shape that you can pretend is the right shape. It was a thread you can feel with your fingers when the lights are off. Light where you left it, said the phrase she had suspected of superstition and decided instead to promote to principle. Light where you left it, and return by the same road if you can, and if you cannot there will be a person with a sign with your name spelled wrong who loves you anyway and will shout at municipal railings on your behalf until they blush.The week after the show had the unglamorous habit of occurring. It folded itself into their kitchen, into the habit of tea and the shapes of their shoes by the door, into the emails that cleared their throats with subject lines like quick question re: REF impact and, from a stationer who could smell zeitgeist, a polite inquiry about whether she would consider endorsing a line of pens. Miriam laughed and wrote back that she could be tempted by biros with a good moral character, then spent ten minutes trying to work out how one described a pen\u2019s ethics without sounding like a person lost in a gallery catalogue. She found, too, that people she\u2019d known for years were slightly turned in her direction as if a small magnet had been set on the table. It wasn\u2019t fame and it wasn\u2019t quite curiosity; it was something like relief, as if she had turned out to be legible in a language they knew.\n\nThe field invitation came not as a hagiography but as a PDF with a diagram of tents. The email was signed by a woman called Miles, which made Miriam unimaginatively fond of her at once, and contained the kind of practicalities she found soothing: load-in times, plug types, whether she might object to the presence of a child-friendly silent disco adjacent to her slot. \u201cWe will do our utmost to minimize bleed,\u201d Miles wrote, and the phrase was so cheerfully gothic that Miriam read it aloud to Tabby, who was lying with a fox sock on each hand like a person trying to frighten a small child into joy. They accepted the Sunday afternoon slot on the second stage, the one that sat behind a hedge like a secret kept on purpose, and agreed to a short workshop in the tent with the craft signage where people made willow lanterns and wanted reasons to hum without embarrassment.\n\nThe department greeted her with a combination of sensible pride and precisely calibrated opportunism. The Head\u2014who had got his position partly by pretending he did not crave it\u2014asked in a meeting whether she might like to be the case study in a brochure about impact with a photograph that suggested both scholarship and accessibility, perhaps something with ivy and a shirt without a collar. \u201cNot a glamour shot,\u201d he said, as if this were a word he saved for his wife or for models of bridges, \u201cbut a hero shot for our own purposes. We would like to demonstrate that we are porous to the world without becoming puddles.\u201d She said she would be honored and also could they not make her look as if she had been rescued by a passing lifeboat of good sense. He pretended to be wounded and then asked if she would consider a lunchtime talk on medieval lyric for ordinary people, then caught himself and amended, \u201cFor a broad audience,\u201d and she nodded, pleased, because the word ordinary is a charm if you say it with love.\n\nMeanwhile, Tabby had decided to become temporarily domestic in the way she did, which meant making lists on the backs of envelopes and then ignoring them in favor of acts of compassion that came into range. She left a note for Darragh that used words like space and tenderness and the sentence I am not a hospice for men who confuse romance with escalation. He replied with contrition and a photograph of a fox in a charity shop window, wearing a child\u2019s hat like a crime, and the message I get it, which could mean anything and therefore was allowed. She began volunteering at the care home on Saturdays because, she said, if she was going to visit and cry a bit in the loo she might as well bring cake and a game. The manager\u2014a woman with earrings like small moons who seemed to have an extra hour in her pocket at all times\u2014put Tabby on the rota for Sherry and Songs and told her to stick to rounds people could remember. \u201cDaisies,\u201d she said kindly. \u201cSkye Boat Song. Avoid Sleater-Kinney unless the relatives have been briefed.\u201d\n\nThe barn with a temperament turned out to be on the Wiltshire edge of Berkshire, tucked between a field of rapeseed making a bid for its own sky and a lane that had decided potholes were a permanent art installation. The man who knew microphones like cheese was called Malcolm and had the face of a person who had once been described, by a lover, as \u201cunexpectedly luminous\u201d and had not recovered. He spoke to the equipment the way farmers speak to animals they respect, saying little and altering his whole posture instead, and when he showed Miriam the main room she knew at once that the notes would enjoy living there. The wooden ribs of the ceiling held sound the way a hand holds water without spilling all of it; swallows had built their architecture at the eaves and flew in and out with the proprietary calm of colleagues.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll want the M160 on the box,\u201d Malcolm said, by which he meant the concertina, \u201cand something forgiving on your mouth unless you like hearing your own teeth. You loop in the room or in the box.\u201d He said \u201cbox\u201d for the small glowing rectangle where other people kept whole orchestras and where he kept only the precise amount of magic that a track could tolerate. She said room, because she trusted her hands more than she trusted the small imp who sat within software and occasionally made a snide remark. He nodded as if she had told him a sensible thing about weather and put up a stand with the care of a person setting out a memory.\n\nThey recorded the one she had sung on television not because she thought the world needed a duplicate but because the electrics of the barn convinced it into a new shape. The swallows made a faint, deliberate track above them like someone flipping a book with their nails. A tractor coughed miles off. When she sang the line with light, Malcolm glanced up, as if he hadn\u2019t been expecting to believe in words in a day run by cables. He did not say the word beautiful because he wasn\u2019t allowed\u2014sound men are penalized for that; it\u2019s in their union bylaws\u2014but he shifted a fader as if he had felt the room make a small positive decision about its future.\n\n\u201cLeave it,\u201d he said, when she suggested she might do a cleverer harmony that would prove her cleverness to people who had not specified wanting proof. \u201cThe barn knows what you meant.\u201d They sat and listened back in the cooling of the late afternoon with mugs that tasted of other people\u2019s coffee and looked at each other once when the loop kissed the room imperfectly and found that the imperfection was precisely the right place to leave a thumbprint.\n\nOn the day of the festival the field had to be persuaded into hospitality. Men in high-vis moved with the patience of saints who had once been told that a stage could be assembled by thinking about it hard enough. The air heaved with the scent of damp canvas and fried optimism. A man tuning a violin in the next tent did it in the exact key of a child crying somewhere beyond the falafel queue, which made Miriam, in her piousness, want to place the pair in a duet and call it Art of Britain. Miles found her under a banner about acoustic serenity and introduced her to ten people with first names that told you nothing and lanyards that told you everything, then placed into her hand a laminated card that would let her move through fences like a ghost.\n\nThe second stage was a clean rectangle under fair lights and full of the kind of shadows that made you think of old theatres. There was a rehearsal of a brass band that would follow her in a grateful hour and a woman in a long cardigan arguing affectionately with a man about whether the phrase \u201cvocal fry\u201d had to be retired in feminist solidarity. She set up her loop station on a carpet that had been laid for good luck, taped her cables in place with the same austerity she reserved for making lists of people she loved, and met the stage manager, a square woman called Pru who had the air of being permanently five minutes from an emergency and never more than two steps from a resolution. \u201cWe like you,\u201d Pru said, without evidence, and then shouted at a child gently for attempting to plug themselves into a monitor, and then grinned at Miriam as if to suggest the world was messy and this would not end it.\n\nTabby, who had promised to behave and meant it for once, arrived with Bex and Cal and a bag that might once have contained coleslaw but now contained cherries, duct tape, and a gentle affront to health and safety. She had slept and eaten and put on a dress that made her look like a sensible lighthouse. There was a monitor tent with tea and biscuits and her instinct led her to it as if she had smelled childhood. They bickered about the right time to clap, which was their way of saying I love you in a setting where kissing would make people stop and later tell a story.\n\nThe power died in the middle of her second song. It died with a theatricality that suggested it had once been a performer itself and now resented sitting behind less emotive apparatus. It went with a small theatrically economical pop and the loop died with it, the pedal mute beneath her foot like a friend who has chosen to go offline at a crucial point. There was a sound from the crowd that civilized British people make when they cannot stop a disaster and must therefore narrate it quietly for the sake of their souls. Pru appeared at stage left with the expression of a general whose troops have made an honest mistake, and a man with a tool belt happened onto his stomach with the elegance of an otter and disappeared beneath the stage to speak in his private holy language to the thing that had misbehaved.\n\nIt was not the end of anything. She put her hands up, as if to ask a room to please be so kind as to give her half a minute of the kind of childhood she had enjoyed, and stepped away from the mic so that the habit of amplification would not be offended. She took the concertina up in her arms the way she might, in an emergency, carry a child who did not want to be carried, and began with a line that could travel without electricity because it had tried both ways and found itself wise. She heard her own voice gather the air by the scaffolding and under the hedges and near the clam sellers and make itself taller with the shame of ambition. The people in the front rows did the cleverest thing British people ever do and stopped being brave in favor of being good; they quieted, which let the people behind discover that listening is a communal sport and need not be refereed. She sang, a little ascetic at first and then with an appetite, and by the time the power came back with a cheer that could have been about democracy, no one wanted it for the next two verses.\n\n\u201cLeave it,\u201d Pru mouthed, her voice already halfway to her radio, and Miriam did. She finished acoustic because the day had asked to learn what breath was and she had been arrogant enough to think she could teach it. When electricity returned to its chair like a contrite child, she put the concertina down with ceremony and made a small bow to the mains as if to be polite to the gods. The band after her clapped like people who had just worked out that tradition could be unsupervised. A woman holding a toddler wiped her eyes with a sleeve and then laughed at herself and went in search of a flattering hay bale.\n\nThe brass band were all brass and shoulders and they bristled behind her like a polite weather system. A man in a flat cap leaned into Pru and said something in a tone that made Miriam\u2019s back muscles relax, and then she found herself cornered by an older woman with a voice like gingham who introduced herself as Gwen and explained, without malice, that she had once been the kind of singer who could stop a fight in a miners\u2019 hall and would she mind answering a question about a phrase in Child 84 that she had never been able to get past. Miriam stayed for the question and the three that followed and agreed to write on a postcard the year that Barbara Allen appeared in a broadside ballad because some people carry their arguments until the day they are delivered into the hands of someone with teeth.\n\nLater, in the willow-lantern tent with children using their names for colors and men explaining knots to themselves like prayer, she did the workshop that had sounded on paper like a polite request to present and turned out, in reality, to be an occasion. A boy with hair like a field on fire and a girl holding a map with her mouth asked if they could loop their own voices and she lowered the mic, moved her body, and taught them to do it without the machine. She clapped patterns that could only live for a minute and made them discover, with their own mouths and hands, that repetition is a kind of kindness. An old woman stood at the back and hummed on purpose and a baby made a rhythm under it with one heel and a man who had never been brave about this kind of thing opened his own mouth and found a note that his father had left for him years ago in a cupboard. She told them not to call it therapy unless they enjoyed scaring off fun, and a person with a clipboard wrote down \u201cloop as accompaniment\u201d as if they had just found a way to get money out of a room without frightening it.\n\nIf she had been the kind of person who read the press with intent to survive she might have seen, that evening, how the reviewer in the local paper had turned the power cut into a parable. The phrase held without wires shone there like a pinned moth, making her cringe and then put the paper down so she could continue to live. Instead, she and Tabby and Cal and Bex sat on a patch of grass near a group of teenagers teaching each other how to roll cigarettes with sincerity, and ate something that might have been halloumi in a better world and here, valiantly, was squeaky cheese in a bun. They watched the sun notice itself dramatically in the river. They did not talk about water in the way of confession and grief; they talked about water in the way of thirst and tide times and the way people carry rain inside them all day and only notice at night.\n\nOn Monday the department posted a photograph on its social media that made her look like someone you could ask to hold your baby while you went to the loo\u2014dignified, engaged with an invisible student, hair in a mood with its own agenda. The comments were red hearts and the occasional small fight about whether the university was using her funny folk music to get attention for its less lovable policies. She thought, for an uncharitable minute, that she would like to put Rory and the Head of Department in a room with Bex and make them talk about relevance, then put the kettle on and decided that even without interventions the zwieback of their ambition might still be softened by milk.\n\nDetective Ellison sent a text that contained only a photograph of a football goal that looked like a mistake and the word: Woo. She sent back a voice note that was a single woo sung like a Gregorian chant and then a second woo in harmony that committed small sins against the mode. He replied with the image of a robin sitting on a fence like a foreman, captioned: You. She had the sudden and not entirely comfortable thought that there are people who become part of your life because a thing went wrong and then you have to decide whether to carry them into the bits that go right. It might be that carrying is the thing that keeps the scale honest, she thought. It might be that the story is a boat and everyone gets a seat until they don\u2019t, and no one gets to predict who will become indispensable.\n\nAn envelope posted without ceremony appeared on her hall table on Thursday and contained a thank-you card from a man called Owen with a photograph of a damp dog on the front and a scrawl that said, I didn\u2019t know if it were allowed, but I thought maybe better to let you know what. He had written four sentences that managed, miraculously, not to make anything worse and to nudge something that had been lingering in the hallway towards the door. They bought good biscuits and took them to the park at the time that the note suggested he might be there, and found him in a jacket that had given up pretending to be waterproof, with a dog that looked as if it had made peace with being apologized to for no reason. He showed them, in the sober practice of people who have learned to understate, where he had stood and where he had looked and what he had thought. He did not say the word hero because he had a wife, you could tell, who would gently tell him off if he ever tried to cast himself in such a role without sufficient evidence. They thanked him and then stopped and thanked him again because there are thank-yous that require a double portion.\n\n\u201cDo I get to meet the professor,\u201d he said to Tabby, who was in a bright coat that made the river look as if it had come to play. \u201cI\u2019ve never met a professor who sings in a lock with no power.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s most of our holy people,\u201d Tabby said, cheerfully sacrilegious. \u201cI\u2019m just an auxiliary apostle. She\u2019s the one with the vowels. If you ever need someone to argue with a railings consultant I have built experience.\u201d\n\nThey all stood for a minute, looking at the water the way people who are trying to be sensible look at a cliff. The dog sneezed and shook and made a decision about a gull. It was more ordinary than most safety brochures allow. It made Miriam feel almost indecently grateful to the dull towns of England and their insistence on featuring the same bench in four different decades without developing an opinion about it.\n\nOn a Friday in late month she found herself on a panel in a small library in a city that smelled of dust and ambition, talking about old songs and new mouths. The panel consisted of a folk archivist with eyebrows like quotation marks, a podcaster with the voice of a friendly bell, and a young woman who had just released a record of unaccompanied lullabies and had the height of a person who had been used to standing on tiptoe for the length of an entire childhood. The audience contained two men who would have liked to ask whether the ballads belonged to them and six women who knew exactly who had written them and would fight for the footnotes. Miriam did her lines about carriage and mouth and how songs are portable roofs you can take with you when you move house. She did not say the word defiance because it looked worn that week, like a favorite hoodie, and refused instead to turn gently around it until it felt like it had rested.\n\nAfterward, the podcaster asked whether he might come to her house and record her kitchen for a segment about domestic acoustics. \u201cPeople need to hear what a nice room sounds like,\u201d he said, with such conviction it made her want to show him the cupboard with the slumping Tupperware to see if his faith would hold. She said he could as long as he promised to take his shoes off and not film the calendar that had a note reading DENTIST/TABBY NO in a nervous orange. He promised to be discreet and then tried to normalize his own excitement by listing, too quickly, other kitchens he had had the honor to capture. She laughed and pointed him to the week they would be in Wokingham pretending they had control over the quantity of jam in the house.\n\nThe thing with Darragh did not end theatrically because those things never do, not in real time. He came on Wednesday with the fox socks and a face like a dog who has eaten a bit of the cake and cannot tell you what cake is when asked. He apologized to furniture and railings and to the idea of forewarning. He looked at Tabby with those clever eyes of his that had made Miriam wish briefly that he were not made entirely of strings he liked to tighten and loosen for his own pleasure. Tabby took the socks and put them in the drawer without ceremony and said, \u201cThank you for the socks. Thank you for the bit where you went for help. Thank you for understanding that if we become a thing again we will need to invent a new word for it, and that word will almost certainly not mean what you remember.\u201d He nodded and said he would work on his new word elsewhere and then, almost as if he had learned a trick in a chapter he had not had access to before, he left without a speech.\n\nHer mother\u2019s decline found a steadier pace, which is a way of saying a road can be both beautiful and relentless and you must walk it anyway. They brought biscuits that suggested effort and sang only the first verse and the last of songs because the middle sometimes contains restless water. A new carer made the word Professor into a form of address that felt as if it had won a prize, and Miriam tried not to love the woman too much because the world sometimes removes such people with impunity. They caught their mother staring at the postcard under its frame in Miriam\u2019s hall one morning after a visit, not with comprehension but with a look Miriam recognized from her own face in photographs from the year their father left the first time and then had to be explained back to them by a neighbor who had decided they could manage truth. \u201cThat\u2019s the sea,\u201d their mother said. \u201cNot here.\u201d Miriam said, \u201cNo, not here,\u201d and felt in her chest a small, grateful weight that could have been the day agreeing to continue.\n\nThe man from the radio did call, the one the producer had promised her would pretend to have discovered her, but he turned out to be kind in an unfashionable way. He asked if she wanted to talk about medieval lyric and then caught himself and said, \u201cOld songs. I\u2019m supposed to say old songs. Someone in a headset will bite me if I say medieval.\u201d She granted him dispensation and he whooped and confessed that he had been wanting to say the word since second form when a supply teacher with shoulders like a lamppost had explained to him what a carol used to be. They recorded a small interview in which she tried to sound like a person whose voice could survive the uncharitable compression of a morning show, and when he asked her what she wanted next she did not say an empire or even a festival with a better cheese van. She said, \u201cI would like a room,\u201d and then, because she suspected he needed more, \u201cA room where I can do this for an hour and a half, and then we all go home feeling like we shared responsibility properly.\u201d\n\nIt came, slowly and then all at once, in the way that desires sometimes do when you have not insisted upon them with a megaphone. Miles wrote to say that the field had a winter edition in a town hall with a high ceiling and a stage with a smile. Nadine wrote to say there was a slot late one evening in a venue that had been a post office and now hosted bands and bereavements, which is to say small important evenings with light. The folk archivist wrote to offer the loan of a song that had been in a patched box in an attic for a hundred years and would she like to bring it into a room where hands could be heard turning pages. Malcolm wrote to say that the barn liked the way she left space and would tolerate her again if she did not over-bring pastries. The Head of Department wrote to ask if she might be willing to be on television again to discuss, without smirking, the relationship between old texts and newer threats to truth.\n\nShe said yes to the room. She said yes to a dozen rooms and then pared them down until she had four and then two because she could feel the scaffolding twitch and did not need the whole street to know about it. She told Tabby that she would be gone one evening and then back for breakfast and Tabby threw her a torch with a new battery and said, \"Leave a light and then come find it again.\" They made a list of snacks for trains and medicines for mothers and allotments for men who might be tempted, and then they went to the charity shop and bought two dresses that looked like respectful instruments and repaired the hem of one because life is not television and television is not life and you need clothes that forgive.\n\nWhen she walked onto the stage in the town hall with its polite Georgian windows and its chairs that had been sat on by at least three generations of knees, she felt anything that had wanted to be epic settle into the proper scale. It was her room in the way rooms sometimes consent to be borrowed. The posters on the doors were earnest and the person at the bar wore seriousness as if it were a costume they enjoyed in winter, and the crowd contained three people who had taught her how to do this without knowing it, and the neighbour who believed in the devil and crisps, and an archivist, and a detective, and a woman who had once fixed her boiler and refused payment in money on the grounds that she would accept a song in recompense like a medieval ghost. She tuned her concertina with the care she would have used to touch someone\u2019s face in a museum if such a thing were allowed and then, because it was no longer possible to pretend she was not in the business of asking for things, she asked the room to agree to two rules.\n\n\u201cNo clapping along unless I ask for it,\u201d she said, and they laughed with relief because they had been waiting to be told. \u201cAnd if I sing a line that sounds like it was left for someone, and it is yours, take it without apology. I\u2019ll make another.\u201d\n\nShe sang until the room told her to stop. She watched her own voice learn the shape of the ceiling and bounce back improved. She did the line with light and did not look for Tabby but felt her there the way you feel a radiator in a room, unshowy and relentless. She told the story she had refused on television about their mother stirring soup and leaving the handle of the spoon pointing, always, to whichever of them was in trouble that day, because she had discovered that the words can do what cameras cannot and return privacy to the person who speaks them. She sang a lullaby that had been in the box and brought back down the stairs to live in a throat and she mangled the middle verse and did not apologize because forgiveness had been built into the thing by a woman who had sung it to a child without sleeping for three nights, and that is the only kind of authority she wanted now.\n\nAfter, the man who had once said he did not believe women could sing folk music because it was about them and not by them came up to the edge of the stage and stared at his own shoe for a minute and then said he had been wrong in a voice that made her like him for the first time since he had introduced himself with his middle name as if anyone had asked. The detective waited on the periphery with a program folded in his hand like homework and said he had practiced not being superstitious but found that woo is now a domestic cry in his house. The archivist pressed into her palm a piece of paper with a song on it that had not been sung in that room for a century and said go on then and make a mess, and the neighbor told her that if the devil was in it he had been to charm school and could be tolerated under the right conditions.\n\nShe walked home afterwards with her loop station case bumping her leg like a slow dog and the irreverent bliss of work done properly keeping an old, decent warmth in her elbows. The town had been asleep for half an hour and was now at the bit where the night admits to its own small mischiefs. A fox evaluated the politics of a bin and found them wanting. A window left ajar told her the story of a washing machine. Her house agreed to be her house again and did not try to invent a narrative about deserts and return. She put the postcard back in its frame after dusting the top of the mantel with a sleeve because sometimes the difference between superstition and attention is housekeeping and intention.\n\nUpstairs Tabby had fallen asleep in an arrangement that suggested that she had been mid-thought and lost the thread in favor of breath. On the pillow beside her a notebook lay open with a page that read, in her handwriting which looked, even at rest, like it was walking down a hill: Light brigade, but a kind one, and underneath it a list of things a light could be: torch, window, song, person, memory, kettle. Miriam stood for a second and felt stupidly rich, and then put the kettle on in the line of duty, because there are two kinds of defiance: the kind you announce and the kind you do by getting on with it until it becomes a horizon.\n\nThe next morning, the day started as if it had been doing this forever and was tired of being applauded. The kettle scolded them gently. The ivy in her office found another millimeter to occupy. The inbox filled, politely, with strangers in need of a room to hum in and an old friend from York asking if she would play a set in a museum after hours and a person called Nora\u2014not Cal\u2019s Nora; another one; the world is patchwork\u2014who ran a choir for people who had forgotten where their breath lived and wanted her to show them how to borrow it back. She said yes to two things and no to two and put two into the drawer with the good pens where dreams go to proof for a day. She took down the concertina and then put it back where it wouldn\u2019t be knocked by a door because sometimes love is just storage done with a little thought. She breathed in, not as if about to be brave, but as if about to be exactly as she was, and went downstairs to find that Tabby had put a note on the bread bin that read: today: bread, and below it: also you. She laughed and then cut the bread at an angle because presentation matters, and began again.Chapter nine began not with a performance but with an appointment, which was a kind of performance if you squinted. It was the appointment where a woman behind a desk with a name badge that said she belonged to a different decade explained to Miriam and Tabby how to choose words for a future emergency and have them sit in a file without catching fire. The form had boxes that looked too thin to hold the sentences they contained and a margin that seemed to expect less love than it would be required to withstand. They were in a small room at the care home that had a chair with arms like reassurance and a small artificial plant that had learned, under duress, how to look like it was doing its best. The woman, who introduced herself as Jas and smiled in a way that made you believe people could change careers and still carry their competence with them like a reliable coat, said carefully that the forms existed to make difficult days tolerable rather than to tempt fate into flexing. Miriam nodded with the determined politeness of a person being fitted for armor she would rather not need, and Tabby leaned forward as if about to agree to a prank and then remembered that this was not a prank and sat back breathing carefully. \u201cWe\u2019ve done this before,\u201d Miriam said, because they had, in principle if not here with this pen in this room, and Jas nodded as if they had just told her that they were able to swim calmly in cold water and sometimes forgot they knew. They signed in the places they were instructed to sign and they wrote their mother\u2019s name in the space for names like a spell. When they finished, Jas put the papers in a folder the color of respectable jam and said, \u201cThis is good. It means that on a day you don\u2019t choose, someone kind can be certain they\u2019re doing the thing you asked,\u201d and it was such an ordinary piece of magic that Miriam felt, for a second, as if the floor had granted her an extra inch.\n\nOutside, the trees had gone into the part of autumn that involved standards. Leaves committed to a color as if they had been called on it. The air had learned the weight of damp newspapers and last berries. On the walk back, Tabby held the folder while Miriam carried a box that contained an emergency supply of biscuits because it is not sedition to bribe staff, it is citizenship. \u201cDo you feel grown,\u201d Tabby said, with half a tilt towards mischief, and Miriam laughed because the word was a coat that never quite fit. \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve been allowed to spoon the sugar,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel like the world is a teapot that will forgive me if I over-steep.\u201d They stopped at the charity shop where a poster announced a JUMBLE OF JUMPERS in a handwriting that refused to look haunted, and the ethics woman behind the till lifted her chin as if to say that the town had decided to be brave on an overcast Wednesday and would require them to join.\n\nIn the days that followed, life compressed itself into tasks that looked small and turned out not to be. The department asked politely whether Miriam might be available for an open day to be the professor who says something that makes a teenager imagine that a building could be kind. Nadine emailed to ask if she might be willing to return to The Night Stage for a Christmas special that would involve a medley and a snowfall machine and a promise not to use the word medieval within five miles of an executive. Malcolm called softly from the barn to say that the swallows had gone and the room missed their insolence but the microphones were cheerful and ready. Miles proposed a winter thing in a hall that had once been a corn exchange and now hosted cooking demonstrations that frightened butter. Detective Ellison, who had not yet learned how to use emojis without making them perform like show ponies, sent a message with a fireworks icon and, beneath it, an invitation to a charity night organized by the river rescue team that had become, in Miriam\u2019s mind, a stern aunt. The names gathered on the table in her hallway like family at Christmas, and she stood among them with a pen, which was her weapon and her flag, and made careful choices until the pile became a reasonable hill.\n\nIt was the river rescue gig that turned out to test their new arrangement with fate. It was to be held in a function room over a pub that had decided, at some point in its earnest middle age, to become a venue that could cater for wakes and awards ceremonies without flinching. The poster had a picture of a lifebuoy and unforgivable clip art, and a line-up that combined a jazz trio with a woman who had learned to tap dance at eighty-one and insisted on demonstrating. Darragh had been involved at a distance, the way he liked to be involved now, by connecting people with other people and then stepping away to observe his own restraint like a carpenter admiring a shelf. He asked Miriam, in a message that performed contrition with more economy than his previous art, whether she would consider doing three songs and if she insisted on refusing him he would pretend he had never asked. Tabby, reading over her shoulder without pretense, made a face that looked like a rehearsal for a sermon and then said, \u201cYes, but with conditions,\u201d and Miriam, who had been thinking No because taste and Yes because decency and Perhaps because love, wrote back and set down the rules in a tone that did not invite poetry. \u201cI will do two,\u201d she wrote, \u201cand not be photographed without prior consent, and I will leave without apology when I need to. I will sing about staying, and if you try to frame it as a story about water I will bring my entire discipline to bear and dismantle your narrative with love.\u201d He replied with a single sentence that, for once, did not lead to a paragraph: Understood, boss. The word boss made her roll her eyes, but this time it did not make her want to set anything on fire.\n\nThe night of the gig smelled like carpet that had learned to tell stories. Men in shirts with sincerity where buttons should be walked carefully carrying pints as if they contained news. Owen, the dog walker who had become in their minds a kind of local deity, stood near the back with a cup of tea and the air of a man who was frequently content to be a peripheral saint. Detective Ellison was there, at a table with two colleagues who had the gaze of people who assumed they would be asked to move chairs and were prepared for it. The jazz trio wore expressions that suggested they had made peace with sheet music being a suggestion and not a commandment. Tabby arrived in boots that looked equal to a flood and sat with Eileen, who had brought a Tupperware of sausage rolls and an opinion about everyone\u2019s posture. When it was Miriam\u2019s turn, she did not use the loop station. She took the concertina and stood under the ceiling fan\u2019s low democracy and sang two songs that left no room for argument. The first was bright and full of the kind of joy people sometimes do not trust unless there is a cake nearby. The second she began with a sentence about railings and restraint and then sang, plain and narrow, a version of Barbara Allen without a body, which made the refrain lift like a halo someone had decided to place on a living head. She did the line about light because it had moved into her house and was paying rent.\n\nThe applause was the softer kind, the type that people do when they are grateful that something has been put into the room in a way that does not need to be decorated further. Darragh came up afterwards with the careful manner of a man navigating furniture and did not attempt an apology. He said, instead, that the river looked different at night and he had considered that obvious observations were part of how people stayed alive. Tabby, at Miriam\u2019s elbow because there are nights when you arrive in a pair, nodded without encouraging metaphors, and said, \u201cI will accept observed obviousness as a down payment,\u201d and then turned, motherly, to tell a teenager with a camera to stop filming strangers without asking. It was a small success, wrought from an evening that had been invited to consider improving itself.\n\nWhile this community drama arranged itself into a story that would keep, an academic drama queued politely. The public talk that the department had asked of her became more specific. It would be in a large lecture theatre with a slanting floor and a smell of late-night arguments and old chewing gum. It would be advertised with a photograph of Miriam that made her look like a person who ironed opinions. The title they suggested\u2014Old Songs, New Mouths\u2014made her wince and then accept because she did not have a better set of words that would please a designer and an administrator simultaneously without consulting a committee. She wrote the talk at the kitchen table, between visits to the care home and emails to Malcolm about the barn\u2019s temperament and messages from Miles that contained maps drawn by someone who believed perspective was a conspiracy. She listened to her own habit of cleverness and then removed half of it. She put back the part where you could sit quietly in a room and hum and be in history without suffering for it. She left space for two minutes of communal humming because she wanted to commit a small act of organized tenderness in a place that had seen too much being right and not enough being together.\n\nOn the day, the students front-loaded the chairs with their presence and their beanies and their quiet competitiveness. Cal sat in the middle with a posture that said he was not involved and a grin that said he was entirely complicit. Bex helped the ushers by telling people where to sit with the confidence of a person who had once directed traffic for an outdoor Shakespeare and discovered she liked telling strangers to go left. The Head of Department made introductory remarks that managed not to mention impact even once, which suggested either that he had learned or that someone had blackmailed him with a photograph of himself eating a sausage roll. Miriam began with the story she had told in the dark room at the television studio about her mother stirring soup; she did not use the phrase defiance until minute nine because she did not want people to think she was brandishing it like a sword. She spoke about mouths as vessels and hands as archives and about how the loop was not a trick but a confession that humans have always needed their own company made audible. When she asked the room to hum, the room hummed. It was shy at first, as if someone had asked it to remove a coat, and then bold, which is what happens when people remember that the person next to them is the same shape. She released them from humming with a small bow as if to say that rituals do not end you; they feed you and then let you leave with your coat and your keys.\n\nAfter, the questions were the kind you hope for because they make you more honest than you had intended to be. A boy with hair like earnestness asked whether songs can be stolen if they were never properly owned and she said yes and that the thief is sometimes hunger and sometimes love. A woman in a shirt with a crisp collar asked whether the loop was the opposite of forgetting and Miriam wanted to kiss her on the crown and instead said \u201cIt\u2019s a friend to memory,\u201d which a person with a pen wrote down as if it had caught something important that might otherwise run away. The archivist with eyebrows like quotation marks stood at the back and raised his hand only at the end to ask, with deadly politeness, whether she would care to translate ink into breath for their Christmas do, and she said yes because that party had terrible sausage rolls and she loved it anyway.\n\nThey did record at the barn, in the thinner light of the year when morning had to be coaxed with tea. Malcolm kept the heaters on a miser\u2019s setting and wore fingerless gloves like a man who felt compelled not to succumb to the clich\u00e9s of his trade and could not resist the comforts either. The second track they tried to catch contained their mother\u2019s voice, not stolen, not thrust into the room by a stage-managed grief, but layered politely under a refrain with her permission that had been given on a good afternoon when the word permission still sat easily in her mouth. The video from the care home, a twenty-second clip of a hand finding a rhythm on the arm of a chair and a voice dark with pears saying Daisy on the beat, gave them the phrase they needed. Miriam sat with her earphones on and thought carefully about where the ethics lived, then put the phrase in gently, a hinge rather than a door, and stepped back as if from a painting she had touched up without making a scene. Malcolm listened and did not move for a time that made her think of the few good weddings she had attended. \u201cThat\u2019s not grief porn,\u201d he said, finally, blunt like a blessing. \u201cThat\u2019s a receipt.\u201d The swallows\u2019 ghosts approved in the rafters, or else it was the weather finding a way to say useful things to wood. They did not attempt anything else that day because you ought not to paint over your own kindness.\n\nTabby was making herself into a person who could arrive with paper cups and leave having arranged a rota. She liked the care home in a way that made Miriam glad and frightened; people who are good at kindness are often mistaken for reservoirs. She learned what biscuits worked, and which songs were allowed after four and before two, and which carers liked a silly dance when the tea trolley was late, and which families needed to be told sharply to stop standing in the way of the breakfast parade. She came home with stories that made Miriam want to be braver for the rest of the day. \u201cThere\u2019s a woman called Annette who refuses to call anyone dear on the grounds that it is a species of deer and therefore unfair,\u201d she said once, peeling an orange as if she were auditioning for a ritual, \u201cand a man called Frank who has adopted the ficus and gets emotionally distressed if anyone dusts it, and they both believe firmly in your show and also in soup.\u201d\n\nDecember came with its truck of gestures and found them at the window trying to decide which ones to order. They said no to the Christmas special because Miriam could feel the exhaustion of performing seasonal cheer for a camera she did not love. They said yes to the library do where the archivist had promised fewer sausage rolls and more glass of something tart, and to the winter edition in the town hall where Miles had insisted she must be their church. The town hall had wreaths that looked as if someone had negotiated with holly directly, and a heating system that had read about warmth and made a start. In the foyer, a man in a bow tie had set up a table of zines that were politely radical, and a child with a paper crown was telling an aunt that angels and sheep can be the same if you believe hard enough. The stage smelled of dry, grateful wood. Miriam had resolved not to chase the feeling that had happened the last time, the one with the sense of a room lifting like a lung, because you cannot train a miracle beyond teaching yourself to notice and then not get in its way.\n\nShe sang the one from the barn and the room learned it as if it had been waiting. She did not announce the hinge. She did not bring attention to the receipt. She let the phrase pass through like a small, necessary wind. Tabby cried, but in the good way, the way that leaves you new, and afterwards she out-sprinted three aunts to the merchandise table to ask a volunteer who looked fifteen to tell anyone who asked that the small print had been achieved ethically, thank you. A woman with a face that had chosen all its wrinkles deliberately came up and said that she had kept her mother alive for twenty-three days with custard and a hymn, and Miriam said she believed in custard and in hymns in that order, and the woman breathed out like a person who had been held on a bus by a stranger for a stop.\n\nThe Night Stage did call again in a way that made the room colder and then warmer; Nadine asked with her best bedside manner if Miriam would write something for their last show of the year, not to perform necessarily, but to be put on the website as a black-and-white piece that could lean against a photograph of someone more glittery and get used in a newsletter where adjectives went to take off their shoes. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be about us,\u201d Nadine said, perhaps lying, perhaps not, \u201cbut it would be nice if it was about why we bother at all when the world keeps making other noises.\u201d Miriam sat at her table that afternoon with a view of an ivy leaf that had decided on death with dignity and wrote a small essay in which she did not use the word defiance. She wrote about the body as drum and about how an old song is a cupboard people keep moving houses with, and about how the loop is a friend to the bit of you that forgets you exist unless you are heard. She sent it to Nadine and it came back with a subject line that read: you are rude to adjectives and I approve, and she laughed and kept the approval for putting under her tongue when a meeting threatened to eat her.\n\nThere was one more card. It arrived between gas bills in an envelope that had not made a decision about whether it wanted to be an envelope. It showed a photograph of a pedestrian crossing in a town that could have been any town with money for paint and a council that had written a letter to itself about courtesy. On the back were five words: Bring it home and share, with no signature and handwriting that belonged to someone who wrote on hard surfaces. It was a phrase from nowhere they could place. It was not one of their private childhood ropes. It did not wear their father\u2019s slant or their old doctor\u2019s carefuls. It fell into the house without making much noise and then started to shape the air around it as if it had always been meant to be there. Miriam stood with it in the hall and thought: perhaps this is how you know you\u2019re allowed to go on. Strangers begin to speak into your story and you do not mind because they are holding the words carefully and not dropping them into the sink.\n\nOn a late afternoon that had decided on fog like an aesthetic, their mother fell. It was not dramatic; it was what bodies do. A carer with daisies on her socks found her on the way to the dining room and made the right noises in the right order, which saved them the particular purgatory where you believe you might have done more if you had said a series of syllables in the correct key. The call came with the calm that professionals put on like a scarf and Miriam did the automatic things\u2014bag, phone, cardigan\u2014while Tabby produced, without announcing it, the small plastic box that contained the relevant paperwork and a pen that worked. At A&E the air was unambitious. People were managing to be alive together in the way humans do when they have no choice. Their mother\u2019s face looked like itself redesigned by a student who had been given limited time, but her eyes had the same ability they had always had to be both ordinary and unbearable.\n\nThe doctor was a different one this time, a woman with fluorescents in her pupils and a politeness that was not a pose. She explained about a small fracture and a night for observation and that they would do the thing with the pain relief while keeping an eye on the breath. She said the words you learn to love because they do not panic you and do not ignore you either. Tabby, who had been concealing her fear under useful jokes, stopped and then started again. Miriam sat with their mother and hummed\u2014because there are songs you sing in public and songs you do not, but humming is an acceptable sin\u2014while the machines did their rehearsed ballet. At one point their mother woke with a little, surprised \u201cOh,\u201d as if she had been offered a second pudding, and looked from Miriam to Tabby with a ferocious specificity that had been absent for a while. \u201cLight,\u201d she said, and then, after a pause in which her eyes did a mathematical operation, \u201cWhere?\u201d It could have been an accusation. It sounded like a game. She raised a hand and Miriam put her fingers under it and said, \u201cWe kept some,\u201d and Tabby, ridiculous, beautiful, infuriating, reached into her bag and produced the torch and clicked it on and off like a pantomime god. Their mother laughed, with her old cough of a laugh, and the machine supervising her heart took it as acceptable and did not object.\n\nThey stayed until staying was no longer useful and then they left in layers, because that is how you remove yourself from a place that has decided to keep the people you love overnight. Eileen had left a note that said SHE IS IN OUR POCKET in large block letters that were at war with grammar and on the hob, stubbornly doing its own timing, a stew made the long way. They ate and did not talk much about the part where the future had been mentioned by a machine. They were becoming good at not forcing a narrative to declare itself before it was ready. When it was time to sleep, Miriam went to her desk and wrote Bring it home and share on a small piece of paper and put it in the drawer with the pens and the tapes, not to hide it but to let it be among tools. She lay down and found the bus of sleep patient again, and when it came it took her to a small field where nothing was expected of her except to remember the right way to place her feet and to breathe when the path narrowed.\n\nIn the new year\u2014the administrative one, the poor unloved little January that has to arrive and bring the bins in and cancel things\u2014the town did its unreasonably noble task of carrying on. The gig in the post office that Nadine had conjured was a benevolent chaos of lights and emotions. The winter hall shared its breath with mist. The care home added crossword hour to the roster because Tabby had lobbied and someone had agreed that a full life requires a pencil and an eraser. The department sent her timetable, apologizing for putting her in Room 3.17 which had a heating system that preferred to sculpt fog rather than dispel it. Malcolm sent mixes with names like december_barn2_final and final_final_really_this_one, and a link to a small radio program where a woman with a voice like a dry brush had played three songs and said out loud that breath can be taught, which made Miriam feel like a person who had been correct without having had to argue.\n\nThere was a moment, one morning when the frost had made the green stay politely still, when Miriam unlocked her office and found on her chair a brown paper parcel tied with string like a proposition. Inside was a book, not new, a collection of ballads with a spine that had learned to bow, and inside the first page a note that read: For the professor who keeps songs honest. From a former cynic in Row F. She tried to work out from the handwriting who Row F had been and decided that preserving the mystery might be a better gift than solving it. She put the book next to the poster of Daphne Oram so they could discuss systems after dark and left a chocolate on her own desk for a future in which she might forget to buy herself anything.\n\nThe first room of the new year\u2014her room, the room she had asked for\u2014was in a little theater above a pub in a city that liked to refer to itself as significant and occasionally deserved it. The stairs were unfriendly at the turn and the backstage had borrowed someone\u2019s kettle without their consent. The chairs were comfortable in the way of chairs that have conspired with performers to keep people from leaving. She had asked that the lights be kind and that the sound be honest and the engineer, a woman with short hair and a cardigan that had outlived heartbreak, gave her both. She sang for ninety minutes after a sensible glass of water and a minute\u2019s quiet that nobody minded because the room had learned from churches how to be dignified without pretending to be older than it was. She made the loop hum like a radiator. She told two stories about their mother and one about the detective and one about the barn and one about the man with the fox socks because there is no point in pretending that our small icons do not give us gravity. When she sang the line that could have become a brand if she had been careless, she spoke it like a promise instead and looked out at her own idea of a country: students and pensioners and men who had been told they were too sensitive for ochres, women who had made soup for their neighbors, young people doing the facial expression that helps them listen differently, a detective in civvies with a woo saved for the end.\n\nShe brought it home and shared, in the practical ways that phrase demanded. She sent Malcolm an email that used the word grateful twice and did not delete one of them. She posted the dates on a website that no one had evaluated for elegance but which contained the correct information typed with the correct spelling. She sent Miles a list of adjectives that she would allow on a poster and trusted her to add one she had not anticipated. She called their mother every morning regardless of whether it would be her who answered, and sang as if the air between was not a cost. She made sure her students had an essay question that allowed them to say \u201cI\u201d in a way that did not get them marked down for being alive. She reminded Cal that he had promised to let her bully the choir into trying a nonsense canon and he reminded her that he had not agreed to be bullied but would permit persuasion. She bought herself a new pen that felt like a tool rather than a flourish.\n\nOn a Tuesday that initially resembled no one\u2019s idea of a chapter opening, a letter came from a man with a surname that belonged to their past. It was not their father. It was the vicar from the village they had lived in between the ages of eight and twelve, a man now in his eighties who had once preached sermons that had made their mother come home and declare that organized religion might be rescued by a handful of people who refused to be pompous. He wrote that he had found a cassette in a drawer labelled Blake girls, summer f\u00eate, and thought they might like the sound of themselves badly recorded, that the village had become posher and less kind and his wife had taken to playing the organ with a kind of malice he admired. He had copied the cassette onto a small awkward USB because his nephew had told him he must modernize or be eaten by the decades, and he hoped they would forgive hiss and the lack of tact. In the evening, they plugged it into Cal\u2019s laptop because he possessed an adaptor like a wizard and listened to two small voices misbehave in front of a trestle table, one trying to sing Wild Mountain Thyme and the other attempting to harmonize by finding a third that existed only in a nearby country. Between the notes was the removal truck of their father pulling away, and their mother baking something with a determined optimism, and the vicar\u2019s wife laughing in a way Miriam remembered from behind a curtain. They listened as if someone had threaded light across thirty years and asked it to keep itself from fraying. When it ended, Tabby wiped her nose with the back of her hand with deliberate inelegance and said, \u201cWe were all arms,\u201d and Miriam said, \u201cWe remain all arms, which is lucky because there is much to carry,\u201d and nobody reached for an extra meaning; they had enough.\n\nIn the thick of it, television turned up in her life again like a guest who might be forgiven for arriving unannounced because they had once washed up. A researcher with the wariness of someone who had been shouted at by a publicist called to ask if she would appear for five minutes on a show where clever people are allowed to be nice. She said yes because five minutes is an amount of time that can support temperance, and turned up in a cardigan that had chosen not to fuss and said her lines about old songs and new mouths and let a comedian call her loop \u201ca pleasing form of legal witchcraft.\u201d The clip went wherever clips go and returned with more than the usual number of messages from people who did not want anything except to say that their grandmother had sung to them during blackouts and they were thinking of buying a kettle with a proper whistle. She wrote back to more of them than was practical because it was an honest form of debt repayment, and put three of the stories in a file titled LIGHT to be kept for the day she felt like a crow needing a reason to bring something shiny home.\n\nThey did the thing that winter asks: they threw a party that was small on purpose. Eileen brought potato salad she had bullied into sophistication and Mr Hughes from number eleven arrived bearing crisps and a confession that he had once been caught dancing by a mirror and regretted nothing. Vee came on the train with a spine that had seen things and a cake that looked innocent and was not, and Owen turned up with the dog who had saved them by being out in the world doing dog work, and Detective Ellison arrived late and blamed traffic and then rioted internally when Tabby placed sheaves of paper in his hand and told him to run charades with conviction. They sang badly and well without assignment. At one point, as happens in houses that have made a reputation for being hospitable to the right kind of noise, people found themselves humming the same thing while looking at different walls as if consulting a manual. Miriam looked around and thought, uncomplicatedly, that this was the room she had asked for, and she had it, and that there were other rooms and other nights where it would not work and she could continue anyway.\n\nWhen the party ended and the house had done the sigh that meant it would keep the stories safe until morning, Miriam stood in the hall where the postcards lived and touched the edges of the frames only because a person can put a hand on a thing without summoning ghosts. Light where you left it. Bring it home and share. She had not engineered them, and yet they kept arriving, as if the world liked being fed and would return the bowl in the morning. She went upstairs and checked that Tabby\u2019s breathing was in the legal range that indicated non-disaster and checked her own emails for a message that might take the last hope out of a week and found none. She sent Nadine a photograph from the party of Eileen telling off a sausage roll for breaking in the oven and wrote, I think we may have discovered impact, and Nadine replied with a photograph of her cat sitting on a stack of scripts and the message: this is my audience and they are a tough room. The bus arrived again. The night did the decent thing. The next chapter was not obliged to be dramatic. It was obliged merely to turn up when called, and, so far, that had been enough.",

                              "content": "The email had been there all along, nested between the department\u2019s circular on GDPR compliance and a newsletter from a publisher she barely remembered meeting at a conference in York. She clicked and skimmed and would have deleted, only the subject line snagged on her like burrs: CONFIRMATION OF FINALIST STATUS \u2014 The Night Stage.\n\nShe read it again. Then a third time out loud, through steam and kettle hiss and her own heartbeat. Congratulations Professor Blake... televised final... Hammersmith... a studio rehearsal pass... coaching sessions... travel covered, accommodation on the river. She laughed in the small square kitchen as if someone had told a very good joke and had to lean a palm on the cool laminate to steady herself.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re kidding,\u201d she said to no one. \u201cYou\u2019re absolutely, completely kidding me.\u201d\n\nOutside, Wokingham was making up its mind about the weather and the Friday market was setting up in the precinct. Some mornings you could hear the fish van calling names like nursery rhymes: cod! haddock! mackerel! She stood with her mug and thought about the precise weight of this thing\u2014a show watched by millions, a stage she\u2019d seen only in fluorescent dreams\u2014and then found herself counting minutes. When could she call Tabby without waking her up? Would this even wake her? It would. It had to.\n\nShe sent a photo of the email and then rang immediately anyway. The dial tone ran and ran; an old sweet high note she could hum. Tabby answered on the fifth, breathless.\n\n\u201cIs this about Mum,\u201d Tabby said by way of hello, as she nearly always did, and the words threw their dark robe over the morning. Then, as if hearing herself: \u201cDon\u2019t say yes. Don\u2019t you dare.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Miriam said. \u201cNo. Listen. The Night Stage. The finals. I\u2019m in.\u201d\n\nIt took a beat to register. Then she got her sister\u2019s laugh, that bright expensive sound she could never quite afford to hear. \u201cOh, you brilliant oddball,\u201d Tabby said. \u201cI always said you\u2019d be less beige one day, didn\u2019t I. When is it? When do I get to watch you terrify the nation with your bells and whistles.\u201d\n\n\u201cLoops and harmonies,\u201d Miriam said, smiling. \u201cThree weeks. Rehearsals before. London. Accommodation in\u2014wait. It says\u2014Hammersmith, near the river. Can you\u2014will you come?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow would I not,\u201d Tabby said. \u201cWe can make a horrible sign. I\u2019ll write it in my worst handwriting. I\u2019ll bring a trumpet. Honestly, Mim, honestly. You doing this. You.\u201d\n\nHer name, Mim, did what it always did, tugged at some childhood place where the loft smelled of dust and elderflower, where they\u2019d drawn chalk towns on the driveway and given each other elaborate, unacceptable council fines. For a minute she was not forty-one with a stack of marking and a choir rehearsal and Committee B at four; she was ten, and her sister was seven and sticky with jam and conviction.\n\nShe\u2019d been Professor Blake for four years now, and Dr. Blake for twelve before that, and no one in her family had got used to it the way people in the department had. She\u2019d started calling herself L. M. Blake on papers to make the emails kinder.\n\nShe went to campus swollen with a private tune and let herself into her office, the one that had an ivy plant limping across the window and a poster of Daphne Oram peering out between book spines. Students drifted past like fish beyond glass. She opened her laptop and read the email again for the hilarity of it, for the sweetness of the language that made her pretty hobby sound like a profession: we are thrilled... we believe your act will speak to viewers across the country... we are committed to diverse voices. She put on the kettle again, even though she didn\u2019t need it. The whistling gave her another excuse to laugh.\n\nBy eleven she\u2019d told Cal from Stats down the corridor, whispered in the way you whisper in churches and exam halls. Cal stood in the doorway with his makeshift hair and his unreadable T-shirt and said, \u201cLike the final final?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe televised one,\u201d she said. They both shook their heads, grinning like thieves.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t even know you were doing this,\u201d Cal said. \u201cI thought you just played in weird pubs and national trust toilets.\u201d\n\n\u201cAcoustics are very welcome in buildings with thick stone walls,\u201d she said primly, and he laughed, and she felt the world tilt.\n\nThe talent show had been a dare to herself in January. A video recorded late and messy, their living room full of leftover pine needles and caution. She\u2019d sent it half certain it would be swallowed by some algorithm, the way a song gets swallowed by the night. And yet, there had been the January audition in a hall with a squeakier floor than any school she\u2019d ever set foot in, and someone sympathetic in a headset had nodded along. There had been callbacks and smaller finals and the improbable business of people clapping where she had expected to be embarrassed. Now this.\n\nHer act had come the way some projects came, backwards. She\u2019d been teaching a seminar on medieval lyric\u2014refrain, repetition, the devil\u2019s music in some monastic eyes\u2014and a student had asked, as they sometimes asked, whether this was anything like the loops people did now. She\u2019d said yes and fumbled for an example, and afterwards felt the old itch in her fingers. She had a small concertina her grandmother\u2019s sister left her, and a penny whistle from a summer in Ennis, and a battered loop station she\u2019d bought second-hand from a man with delicate wrists on the Oxford Road. She had her voice, low and rough in the mornings, smoother by mid-afternoon. She began stacking noises like stones: the tap of chalk on a board, the click of a stapler, a vowel held until it found the corner of itself. It was a joke until it wasn\u2019t. She found herself singing ballads she taught by day, making polyphony out of other people\u2019s grief and stubbornness. In the terrible months after their mother\u2019s second stroke, it steadied her. Some evenings, it saved her, or at least saved the hours.\n\nThat afternoon, at three, she met her second-year seminar and said, \u201cLern\u00e8d friends, today we hum,\u201d and lifted the concertina onto the desk like a contraband melon. Twenty heads lifted. Someone\u2019s phone fell out of their lap and made a tinny sound like a bell from a bike.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not serious,\u201d said Miri (short for Miranda, with eyeliner like a manifesto).\n\n\u201cI am,\u201d Miriam said. \u201cThink of the refrain as a home you keep coming back to. Think of it as a way for the song to keep you. We\u2019ll talk about the words later. For now, the shape.\u201d\n\nShe made them intone the simplest patterns, made them split into two groups, then three. Da-da-da, and daaa-da-da, like rain in a gutter. Someone giggled until it stopped being funny and became like a small religious experience. When she added her own line, the room shifted, as rooms can. Miri\u2019s mouth made a soft O. They were good. Young and good and not yet embarrassed by their bodies. If you stood outside the window you\u2019d think a low and minor instrument had been playing, some old psaltery found in a lane.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to be scandalous on television,\u201d said Miri afterwards, in the front row by the desk, and Miriam laughed.\n\n\u201cModerately scandalous,\u201d she said. \u201cAt best.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll sell out Hammersmith,\u201d Miri said, unaware of the logistics of showbusiness and the way producers load more trapeze artists than there are trapezes. \u201cCan I bring my aunt. She believes education is useless.\u201d\n\n\u201cBring her,\u201d Miriam said, not certain what she meant.\n\nAfter committee, after signing a disintegrating card for someone taking early retirement, she walked home through the long green that ran along the back of the school playing fields and then cut towards the station. Wokingham, with its market-town hum and its leaves. A boy went by on a scooter with a flashing wheel, a small star-system spinning. The Black Boy\u2019s pub had a new chalkboard out front\u2014pie and mash, quiz Thursday. In a window over a shop, a cat lay like a loaf.\n\nHer terraced house was neat because the alternative made her skin itch. She picked up the post, which included a charity envelope and a flyer offering to replace her roof in a day. On the mat lay a glossy postcard advertising the show itself, though it didn\u2019t say her name, of course. The hosts smiled with teeth like pearl ornaments. Thousands of applications\u2026 the very best acts from across the country. It was real; ludicrous, and real.\n\nA message pinged from Nadine at The Night Stage, introducing herself as her point of contact and asking for her postal details again. They would deliver the detailed schedule on Monday. She typed back carefully, checked for typos as if Nadine might judge her academic worth, and finally wrote: yes, that\u2019s my number; yes, that\u2019s my best postal address; yes, I have a loop station and we do not require special power, just an ordinary UK plug; yes, a dressing room mirror would be grand; no, my act does not involve pyrotechnics unless you count vowels.\n\nAt six, she went to The Crooked Wren to meet Cal and a couple of choir people and tell the story properly, with a pint of something amber in her hand. They sat in the corner under a painting of what might have been a fox or a dog wearing a monocle; it was hard to tell. Bex from choir, who had enough hair for three other women, stared and said, \u201cBut you\u2019re not a headcase. Do headcases just audition now. Is that the world?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a headcase,\u201d Miriam said. \u201cI\u2019m an eccentric. And you see me at choir. You haven\u2019t seen me do the one with the pens and the whistle. I should patent it. Someone probably already has. The men in my YouTube comments certainly think so.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour YouTube comments?\u201d Cal said, theatrical. \u201cYou have YouTube comments? Excuse me while I faint.\u201d\n\n\u201cNever read them,\u201d said Bex, serious suddenly, and raised her pint.\n\nLater, walking back along the dim street threaded with fairy lights, she rang Tabby again, wanting a reprise, wanting the quick fizz of shared drama, the brokered thrill. No answer, though the call clicked into voicemail with two beats of background noise as if her sister had lifted then thought better. It was fine. It was Friday night. Tabby had a life with edges. She left a message anyway.\n\n\u201cHelp me choose,\u201d she said. \u201cWhich song first. I can\u2019t do Barbara Allen first. It\u2019ll sound like the BBC in 1952. But the \u2018Silver Dagger\u2019 one. I can loop the dagger\u2014I mean the word, not the object. Call me when you\u2019re less dazzling than a whole nightclub.\u201d\n\nIn the morning, Eileen from next door knocked with a jar of marmalade and her views on the council. Miriam listened, nodded, pictured Nadine\u2019s schedule. Rehearsal 1: West London rehearsal space, Thursday, arrival by 10:00 AM. She imagined a room with mirrors and a man with a clipboard. She\u2019d be told to smile and talk about her core message. She imagined her core message in a small box with a lid. She imagined having to explain that her act was not about gimmick but old ways made new, about the body as instrument and instrument as body. She thought, maybe, that wasn\u2019t a message. It was nothing the show could film. It was too private to fit in a box.\n\n\u201cAre you eating,\u201d Eileen asked at the end of a sentence about traffic.\n\n\u201cI am,\u201d Miriam said. \u201cLook. Bread. Butter. Marmalade. Replete.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re so proud,\u201d Eileen said, as if discussing an exam result. \u201cOf course I\u2019ll vote for you. We\u2019ve all been told to. Even Mr. Hughes at number eleven, even though he says television is a tool of the devil.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d Miriam said. \u201cIf I can win over the devil\u2019s tool, I\u2019m unstoppable.\u201d\n\nShe practiced. She sat in her front room with the upright piano that had a sour middle C and the loop station on the carpet, its pedals scuffed where her shoes liked to fall. She laid down a drone with the low ends of the concertina, counted four bars in and caught it in the loop, then added a second line, close and dissonant like two sisters not speaking. Then a patter of pen taps on a hardback. Then a breath. Then her voice. She was never sure how it might come out until it did, a slightly different instrument each time, like the flute you pick up in a music shop that has a crack you must learn.\n\nThere was a knock at the door during her fourth take and she stepped on the stop button and went in stocking feet to answer. Cal stood with a Tupperware, grinning, and behind him a small dog he was minding for a friend, black with white socks.\n\n\u201cI brought curry,\u201d Cal announced. \u201cAnd also a dog.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoes the dog eat curry,\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cHe informs me he doesn\u2019t,\u201d Cal said, looking down. The dog gazed back with charity.\n\nThey ate cross-legged, talked about set lists, about stage fright.\n\n\u201cDo you get it,\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cYes. Then no. Then yes. Sometimes the line just before I begin I think: I cannot do this. I cannot do anything. And then the music starts and I remember that I don\u2019t have to be clever, I just have to be honest.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd medieval,\u201d Cal said. \u201cDon\u2019t forget medieval.\u201d\n\nThe show called again, this time a youngish man called Rory with a slight Midlands drawl who told her gently that they preferred if she didn\u2019t use the word \u201cmedieval\u201d in her pre-performance interview, because it made people think of chastity belts. \u201cWhich are a myth,\u201d he added, cheerful, like a student who\u2019s read the second half of a reading list.\n\n\u201cPeople,\u201d she repeated. \u201cYou all mean a sort of imagined average viewer.\u201d\n\n\u201cExactly,\u201d Rory said with relief. \u201cExactly that.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow would you prefer I say it,\u201d she said, pen hovering.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cOld songs. Throwback. Timeless. Old school. That sort of thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is not at all old school,\u201d Miriam said, and then laughed. \u201cI know. I know. I won\u2019t say the word. I\u2019ll be digestible.\u201d\n\n\u201cPerfect,\u201d he said. \u201cAlso we sometimes call our acts by their act name. Do you have one?\u201d\n\nOh, God. She hadn\u2019t thought. She\u2019d been plain Miriam in signed emails, her legal name on forms. An act name. She looked around the room, the way people in movies look around the room and call themselves Lampy Tarn or Chair Boson.\n\n\u201cLight Where,\u201d she said, and then \u201cNo\u2014no, that\u2019s nonsense. Maybe\u2014The Lilt? No. There must be seventy-five Lilts. The\u2014\u201d\n\nAt that moment the dog barked at the hallway mirror, startling her into a falsetto. The dog had a collar with letters that spelled NORA. She put a hand on the crown of its head, felt warmth.\n\n\u201cHow about just my name,\u201d she said into the phone. \u201cMiriam Blake. People will cope.\u201d\n\n\u201cFine by us,\u201d Rory said, and she imagined him tapping the keypad, a tiny life detail firmed up. \u201cSee you Thursday.\u201d\n\nEven in that quiet week, between the email and the first rehearsal, things were not entirely quiet. A segment producer came to Wokingham, to film what they called \u201csoft story,\u201d which involved Miriam standing in the town centre looking at vegetables with a professional interest she\u2019d not had since she was six. She walked the length of Peach Street with a camera following, a person in a denim jacket asking her questions slightly off-mic. \u201cWhy old songs,\u201d the denim jacket asked. She said, \u201cBecause they were made to be carried in mouths,\u201d and the woman\u2019s face shifted as if that could be used.\n\nThey filmed in her office too, and her students became suddenly stately, sitting without slouching like saints. A boy in a hoodie asked if he could be in the background. They dimmed the fluorescent lights and made her say three sentences again with more smile. They filmed her touching spines, a curious archive of gestural commas.\n\nThe unglamour sat alongside the glamour in a way she found comic. She still had to sort out her mother\u2019s chair-raiser that the hospital never collected. She still had to pay the window cleaner, a cheerful man who had an anecdote about every pane he\u2019d ever seen. The train to London still broke down at Slough at least once a fortnight and had to be coaxed into shame by a woman at the microphone who said, with startling precision, that they were sorry at the inconvenience caused.\n\n\u201cBreathe,\u201d Bex kept texting. \u201cEat. Remember to oxygenate. Don\u2019t die before you make us proud.\u201d\n\n\u201cOptimal plan,\u201d she replied.\n\nShe didn\u2019t see Tabby, not properly, in that week. They swapped voice notes like dancers in a hallway. There was always something: Tabby\u2019s shift at the wine bar, Tabby\u2019s allocation at the charity shop where she did a day a week for reasons Miriam pretended she understood. A man called Darragh drifted in and out of sentences. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing,\u201d Tabby said, and then, \u201cOkay, it\u2019s maybe something, but not your jurisdiction,\u201d and then laughed sharply and sent a heart.\n\nTheir mother\u2019s care plan was stable for the moment. Stable meant a slow lean downward, sure, but no sudden drops. Sometimes it was enough to light her day: the way their mother\u2019s hand still recognized the shape of a fork, or the way she could be coaxed to sing. Sometimes, Miriam thought that this was why she sang: because some words, sung, could carry memory like goats carry milk on the narrow paths. Churl. Meed. Wend. Old words like pebbles you cannot wear out.\n\nOn Thursday at nine she lugged the loop station in its gypsy-case, the cables packed and taped so no intern would panic. She wore the jacket that made her look more like herself: navy with a thread of silver, shoulders that meant business but kindly. The train to Paddington was full of small children pointing at everything. At each stop, her heart ran through its paces. She texted Nadine: Nearly there. Nadine replied with a prayer hands emoji that for once did not annoy.\n\nThe rehearsal space was a bland dream of white. Studio 3. In the corridor, a woman in sequins walked like the sequins weighed more than you\u2019d think. A boy no older than her first-year undergraduates was moving his lips very fast as if rehearsing a rap in his head. She felt the old sensation you get in school gyms: the tips of your fingers remembering how to peel cello tape, the smell of floor polish pricking some tear. It was both unearthly and a tax office.\n\n\u201cProfessor Blake,\u201d someone called, and she turned to see Nadine, who was made entirely of scarf and sincerity. \u201cWe\u2019ve been watching your videos. We love the\u2014what did you call it? The pen taps?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe percussive stationery,\u201d Miriam said, deadpan, because she could.\n\n\u201cOh my God,\u201d Nadine said. \u201cSay that on camera.\u201d\n\nShe was walked to a corner to do sound check, the loop station credibly linked to an amp that did not hum, and she began the slow build of her act. One line, another, the bass hum of the concertina finding very gently the shape of the room. She met the face of the man in the sound booth, saw it change. Good. The best thing was always that first moment of disbelief: the way you could see someone expecting you to be quaint, and then recalibrating because the room had tipped. She built the second chorus. She heard her own voice come back to her, a sister she knew well. She stepped into it. When she ended, the room fell in love for a small and blessed second with being silent.\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d said the sound man into the microphone, business-like, and then, less so: \u201cOkay. That\u2019s\u2026 yeah. Good.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s a professor,\u201d someone murmured behind a script, as if it were a spell that made levitation possible.\n\nShe met the other acts between cues. A contortionist called Vee moved like a question mark and ate an apple like a person. A comedian with a face like an eager uncle tried a joke about the M25 that made no one laugh now, but might later. A boy with small precise hands played a toy piano with the seriousness of a surgeon. She liked them all immediately, the way you like your companions in a waiting room for a minor operation.\n\n\u201cYou will be huge,\u201d said Vee, matter-of-fact, not looking at her as she stretched her spine into improbable shapes.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need huge,\u201d Miriam said. \u201cI need convincingly medium. I need to stay upright and not fall over any wires.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour advice is terrifying,\u201d Vee said cheerfully, and bent until she seemed to be lying her head on the back of her own knee.\n\nOn the train back she texted Tabby a careful stream of nothing. It had been a smooth day. Tired. The show people were real. You would like Vee, who is made of springs. A boy called himself Ozone unironically and I find that enviable. She sent a voice note of twenty seconds: the chorus of the song she wanted to open with, just the bones. It was a bargaining chip, look what I have made, isn\u2019t it fine, can you say you\u2019re fine too.\n\nThere was no reply by Reading. She told herself it meant nothing. On the platform at Wokingham, a small girl waved at the train as if to keep it safe, as if to send it to a war. An old man touched the brim of his made-up hat at no one.\n\nLater that night, when the house was slow and the windows returned her face to her, her phone trembled on the table. She swiped. A voice note from Tabby. She pressed play.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d Tabby said, in the tone of someone saying it before you ask it. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. You gather. There\u2019s\u2026 there\u2019s a thing, but it isn\u2019t your thing, Mim. I know you think every thing is your thing, but don\u2019t ro\u2013 don\u2019t\u2014\u201d The voice broke somehow, like a tape chewed. The next second was static and what might have been wind. Then: \u201cListen, I can\u2019t\u2014\u201d The note ended. The small timer read eleven seconds.\n\nShe played it again and again, as if repetition could change content. It couldn\u2019t. She sent back a volley of words: Are you? Can I call? Should I come? She called anyway. It went to voicemail with the kind of cheeriness you would invent for your own funeral: Tabby again. Say your best.\n\nShe went to bed and lay under the duvet cool as the other side of a pillow, her hands a fraction too cold. It was not unusual; these half-outlines were Tabby\u2019s scribble. Tabby\u2019s life had always had angles she could not quite see. She had learned not to blunder, to bring soup and a joke instead of insistence. Love, she had found, wasn\u2019t always a key. Sometimes it was a blanket. Sometimes it was a pot plant you watered until you learned to stop drowning it.\n\nIn the morning she taught the last seminar of the term and left them with a silly hymn she loved, the kind that listed the parts of the day as if a day were a cathedral. In the afternoon she finally did the boring admin of her life: the electricity where the supplier sends you letters that say things like We need to read your meter and then Do not worry about this but and then We have estimated. She couldn\u2019t estimate Tabby.\n\nShe made a folder for the show called NIGHT in all caps like a teen. She put in it the contracts, the itineraries, the sheet of notes in which she had attempted to answer, for herself, what her act was about. She crossed through a lot of adjectives, none of which looked like her in a dress shop mirror. Possibly, it was about companionship. The way voices made company that did not frighten the dark. The way a loop did not abandon you, did not forget.\n\nSaturday someone slipped a postcard under her door. No stamp. No envelope. It showed a strip of sea the colour of bruised plums and a pier that jogged out like a line of punctuation. Selsey, or Worthing, or somewhere the children of Berkshire grew up pretending was their own coast. On the back, in a fast tidy hand that belonged to their childhood doctor or their form teacher or the universe at large, the words: Light where you left it. No name.\n\nShe stood in the hall with the postcard and a feeling like a small bird trapped in her stomach. It was a phrase. It had their DNA. They had said it to each other that summer their father left for the second time and came back the third, the summer with the vowels too long. Light where you left it. Tell me the way so I can come by the same road. I promise I\u2019ll leave the light where you left it.\n\nHad Tabby written it? She turned it this way and that, and it did not become more legible. She photographed it and sent it with a question mark. No read receipt. No reply.\n\nShe went out, because staying still made the noise louder. On the street she saw chaos and comfort: a delivery van untidily parked, a boy kicking a bottle top expertly into a drain, the woman in the charity shop window setting up a display of jackets with autumn in their elbows. She went in. \u201cTabitha,\u201d she said to the woman at the till, who was soft with ethics and eyes. \u201cWhen is she on? When\u2019s her shift?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s doing Thursdays,\u201d the woman said, riffling. \u201cShe\u2019s a good sort. Bright. I told her that. She told me to sell the mirror even if she reserved it. Do you want the mirror? It\u2019s very forgiving.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have a mirror,\u201d Miriam said, and believed it.\n\nIn the evening she called her mother. A carer held the phone. Her mother said her name in a way that made her both feel like a thousand stones and also a small floating thing. She sang, very gently, Daisy Daisy, and her mother sang back, dull sweetness like the last of the pears. \u201cProfessor Blake,\u201d the carer said, when they were done and had finished being grateful to each other for being both alive and present. \u201cThe telly. We\u2019ll put it on at six. She\u2019ll love that.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Miriam said, into a room she could not see. The line clicked. The house lifted and settled with night.\n\nShe dressed for a small local gig in the back room of the Stag and Violet, a place that used to be a bakery and, if you stood in the right place, still smelled of yeast and sugar. She put on the navy jacket and a scarf like the underside of a pigeon\u2019s neck (slate, oil, tender greed). Bex was at the bar. So was a man who had once told Miriam with conviction that women could not really do folk music because women were the subject of the ballads and very rarely their author. She avoided him like a language she did not speak.\n\nShe took the tiny stage, the rug underfoot anchoring her to the simple world, and opened with the one she knew by spine. Two lines in, the room quieted. Mid-song, a phone somewhere at the back boomed with an alert\u2014a thick sound like a gong. Someone silenced it, embarrassed. And then, a second gong, softer, in her own pocket. She kept going because that was the law of the song. She kept going because she could. The law had clauses and loopholes. You could do both: sing and dread.\n\nAfter, she pulled her phone to the light and there it was, a message that had managed to be both too brief and too much: Are you with her? followed by the sender\u2019s name: Darragh, which had been in Tabby\u2019s phone once; she remembered because it had popped up while their mother\u2019s speech therapist had been trying to explain the difference between now and not-now.\n\nMiriam felt the room tilt like a tray of glasses. She typed: With whom. He typed back: Tab.\n\nShe called. He answered as if the world were a hallway in which everyone was always already pointing at him.\n\n\u201cIs she there,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t get her. Hasn\u2019t been right all day. You\u2019re her\u2014she listens to you.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere,\u201d Miriam said, and she sounded, even to herself, like a person on a newscast. \u201cWhy are you\u2014where did you last see her.\u201d\n\nHe exhaled a type of laugh that was not laughter. \u201cYou the police now,\u201d he said, and then, softer, more himself: \u201cSorry. It\u2019s just, she was with me. And then she wasn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe nature of people who leave rooms,\u201d Miriam said, anger making her precise. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a theological riddle, Darragh.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t be\u2014look, we were at the lock. She likes the lock. You know she likes the stupid lock. She makes me read the stupid plaque. We had tea from a flask because they\u2019re charging three ninety for dishwater now, and she\u2014she just. She said she was going for a pee\u2014sorry\u2014and then she didn\u2019t come back. And her phone\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you go looking,\u201d Miriam said, not trusting the next word to be calm.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m calling you, aren\u2019t I,\u201d he said, and then, realer, when he heard the temperature drop: \u201cYes. Yes I looked. Yes I went\u2014yes. She wasn\u2019t there. It\u2019s not a big lock. I walked the canal like a man with a metal detector. Then this bloke who walks a dog said he thought he saw\u2014look; I don\u2019t know. I probably did something wrong. I always do. Just\u2014if she\u2019s at yours, if she came to you, don\u2019t\u2013 don\u2019t grass me up for worrying.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care about your fear of shame,\u201d Miriam said. The kindness came back like a coat she shrugged on. \u201cIf she\u2019s here I\u2019ll call you. She isn\u2019t here.\u201d\n\nShe hung up, then, because you were allowed to in the end. Because the law of the song requires not only patience but also breath. She sat in the corridor outside the bar, where the fairy light transformer buzzed like distant bees, and called Tabby again. She said the thing she tried not to say: I\u2019m here. Tell me where.\n\nNothing.\n\nOn Sunday, the whole town put its bins out as if to show they had some say in things. Miriam made tea and walked with both mugs into the small garden that the estate agents had called generous and which was, sure enough, generous in the way a kind stranger is. She stood among the soft things and listened to her neighbor\u2019s radio announcing Trade deals and a goal in the ninety-third minute. She thought: perhaps this is just the drama we will tell of this week. Perhaps this is nothing that cannot be made smaller by time. Then she put down one mug and picked up her phone and wrote to Tabby the way you put out crumbs for birds. I will stop texting like this in an hour. I\u2019m not mad. Please be safe. Can I bring you the blue boots you like. You left your scarf. I\u2019m doing that one with the dag\u2014no, I promise I won\u2019t use the word on television.\n\nAn hour left her with nothing except a list of the times she\u2019d been there and the times she hadn\u2019t and the mathematics of guilt. She took out the postcard and propped it against a plant pot. Light where you left it. She had left light so many places. She touched the card with her index finger as if it might be a cat.\n\nThere was a rehearsal on Monday. Then flights and people standing in cold corridors. Then there was this life beside it, the one that did not have cameras. She thought she was managing both, like an acrobat with a plate that she kept spinning with one finger and a plate that she kept spinning with the other. She saw, all of a sudden, that she had left the table.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t catastrophize,\u201d Cal said on the phone that evening, voice careful like a person who has been told to carry a bowl. \u201cYou are very extremely qualified to catastrophize. Don\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe sent me a phrase we used when we were ten,\u201d Miriam said.\n\n\u201cShe might be making you a thing,\u201d he said. \u201cShe might be being romantic about your show. She might be\u2014she might be even doing a thing for herself where she switches off her phone to stop herself doing worse things. You don\u2019t know yet, Mir. Don\u2019t make the whole scaffolding.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know the scaffolding,\u201d she said. \u201cI built it in prior lives. I\u2019ve been to the top and thrown down bricks.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen, maybe don\u2019t climb it now,\u201d he said. \u201cMake food. Do the other thing. Sing.\u201d\n\nShe made food. She burned onions, which was unlike her. She sang a small thing to the pot, the way people used to. She thought of her mother saying in a soft voice: There must be a song for this. There\u2019ll be a song for everything.\n\nTwo days later they filmed her in a black room speaking to a black camera and the black room demanded that she become bigger to fill it. They called this part Hero Shots. She tried not to laugh. She tried to be heroic. \u201cI grew up,\u201d she said, \u201clistening to my mother sing while she stirred soup,\u201d and the camera, the stupid black lens of it, understood this. It liked her. It wanted her to be that person at eight p.m. on a Saturday with the country watching and judging and making tea during the adverts.\n\n\u201cThe audience love a story,\u201d Nadine said in the make-up chair, as a woman with cool hands made her face more of a surface and less of a face.\n\n\u201cThey are not wrong,\u201d Miriam said. \u201cI love stories. They just don\u2019t always happen to have the right narrative shape when you need them to. Sometimes the second act is just an email.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat does your heart want,\u201d the make-up woman asked, in the voice of a kindly tarot reader.\n\n\u201cTo do this and have it be my life for a night,\u201d Miriam said. \u201cAnd for my sister to be in the audience and not to have vanished into a hole in the path.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh,\u201d said the make-up woman, and time passed in a way that suggested sympathy.\n\nShe stood under the halo of the light in rehearsal and said; \u201cThis is a song about people keeping each other alive,\u201d and Rory in the corner with his headset said, \u201cLess death,\u201d and she said, \u201cIt\u2019s not death. It\u2019s the opposite. It\u2019s defiance,\u201d and he said, \u201cOkay, lovely, say defiance,\u201d and she laughed, because this is what people did. They translated their hearts into packaging.\n\nOn the busiest day of that week, when she had met three people who asked her whether she would be wearing anything sparkly and one who asked what her key demographic was, she got a text from a number she did not know. It was a photograph of her sister\u2019s scarf on a railing over water. It was the scarf, blue with white flecks like cod eggs, the one she had thought she\u2019d return. The photograph was well-composed, as if not entirely unkind. Beneath it, a single word: Sorry.\n\nShe called the number until it did not ring anymore. In the quiet between rings she heard her own voice in the rehearsal in her head saying defiance. The truth was a moving thing. The truth was someone\u2019s scarf, maybe not now on that railing, and someone\u2019s number that did not work, and a stage so close she could have put out a hand and adjusted the mic.\n\nThe dull town resumed around her, respectably. The bins were brought in; the buses made their insistent patience known in exhalations. She sat on the step with her grey post, the one you do not put in a bin, and found that she was humming so softly that even she could barely hear it. Something like the refrain of a song that had not yet worked out what it was for. Something like the tune you hum when you are walking at dusk and you don\u2019t really know what to do with your hands.\n\nShe had wanted, early on, to be unshakable. She had thought age would do that, the way a river makes a stone polite. But it turns out you are never finished. It turns out that learning and practice never end and you keep having to haul yourself into the shape of someone who can step onto a bright stage and call that place and the real world both true.\n\nHer phone rang again, within an hour, with the call that put everything in a certain new tense. The voice on the line belonged to a police officer who had the patience of someone training a plant. He said her name and then her sister\u2019s name and then his own name, and there were the words found, and no foul and yet, and for now, and could she. Could she get here. Could she bring.\n\nMiriam said yes to all of it. She said yes to the wrong questions and the right ones. She went upstairs and stood by the bed and did not remember, later, how she had picked up her shoes. She made herself look in the mirror. She said, softly, \u201cLight where you left it,\u201d and her voice sounded like a stranger\u2019s. Then she went out into a town that, if she squinted, was kind and beautiful and hers, and walked faster than dignity permits, because sometimes you must, until the pavement gave way to ground that did not deserve to be called path and the water, when it came into view, was all wrong, and yet, unmistakeably, the same water that had sat under a modest English sky for a hundred years, minding only its own business.\n\nSomewhere, a camera was being packed into a soft black bag. Somewhere, a producer was crossing out a name on a whiteboard and writing it back on again. Somewhere, her act was looping in an empty room: her voice layered with itself, her voice singing to her voice, a chain, a family, a very old trick of time. She thought then of what a song is: the promise you can leave for yourself in the dark; the light you might find again where you left it; the sound of someone coming up the stairs and saying your name in a tone that means you are known. And with that thought in her chest, not comfortable, not terrible, just a metal she could polish later, she went. She had never been ready for any of this. She had only been willing. It had been enough so far. Now, she asked the world to meet her halfway and to do the easiest thing it ever had to do: to let something be true when you said it out loud and waited.",

The house made the soft protesting noises of a thing left mid-breath: the lamp still on in the hall, the dishwasher sulking about being half-loaded. She took the blue boots because she had promised them; she took the scarf because that was ridiculous now but still like a charm you rub a thumb against; she took the postcard without thinking, slipped it between the pages of a library book like a wickedness. The officer had asked, in that careful way, for ID if she had it, for medication if she knew, for a calm relative if such a creature existed. She put her calm in her pocket with her keys and found it was lighter than advertised.\n\nOutside, rain the size of pinheads threaded the air. The pavement had its old chalky smell. The town had been up since before she had and was in the middle of its Saturday laundry: cars rinsed, pavements washing themselves into drains, the church clock making a tiny thunder of it. She walked as fast as you can without making it look like running away, and then stopped caring about what she looked like. Cal\u2019s voice existed somewhere between her left ear and her sensible heart saying breathe and she did, but it was a saw-toothed kind of thing. At the station she cut down instead of up, took the alley that smelt of wet cardboard and good intentions, and then she was on the long straight that ran under trees towards the river, a line lived in by dog walkers and people mending something internal with the rhythm of their feet.\n\nThe lock was not the one she would have chosen if she had been ten and allowed to make the day\u2019s choices. Sonning wore its wealth; it posed for photographs in nice light. This was smaller, more used, a mechanism knitted into a council\u2019s sense of itself. The sign was brown and educational; the plaque said something about Brunel without conviction. Someone had planted geraniums in an old lock gate beam and the geraniums, damp and cheerful, made a mad contrast with the water that had the colour of tea you would send back. There were three vans where there should have been none. Unmarked, except in the way that vans owned by public services always are: yellow chevrons, unflashy steadiness. Someone had strung blue-and-white tape that made the landscape look like it had been invited to a party.\n\nIt was not a circus. It was not even loud. A woman with a notebook was talking to a man whose jacket knew more rain than it knew dry. The water spoke the way it always spoke, impatient and without malice, hauling a skin of bubbles into existence and then destroying it with a professionalism that made you want to applaud.\n\n\u201cMs Blake?\u201d The officer who had phoned materialised out of a sort of patient grey. He had a collar that sat wrong on his neck and the kind of beard that made you think of brown birds. \u201cDetective Constable Ellison. Thank you for coming. I\u2019m sorry to bring you out. We think\u2014 well. If you\u2019re ready, there\u2019s a\u2014 we\u2019ve got her at the ambulance just now. She\u2019s cold and she\u2019s not saying a lot. We\u2019re not looking at an offence. We just\u2014 if you can sit, and we need your confirmation for the notes.\u201d\n\n\u201cNotes,\u201d she said, because the word seemed small enough to manage. \u201cOf course. She\u2014 she\u2019s\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIn one piece,\u201d he said, and the small mercy made a room in her chest wider. \u201cSomeone saw her by the railings. He says she seemed confused. He thought he saw her take her shoes off and he thought he saw\u2014 I don\u2019t want to put words in anyone\u2019s\u2026 We\u2019re not building a case. You know her. You know what\u2019s likely. The gentleman went for help. By the time anyone got to the exact spot, she wasn\u2019t where he thought. The dog walker\u2014 there\u2019s always a dog in these these\u2014 was the one who hears and says he sees someone slip. You know how the water here has that awful slow bit that\u2019s somehow faster than you think. River rescue were on in under five. It\u2019s not very\u2014 it isn\u2019t far. She\u2019s lucky. It\u2019s lucky. She\u2019s shivery and she\u2019s\u2014 she was laughing at one point, you know that laughter people do when it\u2019s all more than. Then she wasn\u2019t. She apologised to a traffic cone. So. Ambulance are keen on warming and on some observations. They\u2019ll ask their questions. You can be in the corner.\u201d\n\nIt was a lot of words to say in the rain. The rain did that thing where it takes an interest in the backs of your hands. Miriam tried to make her mouth remember to do its job. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t take anything regular,\u201d she said. \u201cPainkillers when she has to. A multivitamin if someone hands it to her. Wine, when she works a double and forgets that water exists. She\u2014 she reads everything, which sometimes looks like steady but sometimes it looks like falling down holes. No drugs, not that I know, not unless you count stubbornness and men called Darragh. Did he\u2014 has he\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHe phoned us,\u201d Ellison said, without tone. \u201cHe\u2019s here, actually. He\u2019s over there being devastated by a bollard. We\u2019ve got two statements that don\u2019t quite match yet but they\u2019re honest statements, which is more than plenty. Do you want to see her first or do you want to commit grievous bodily eye-rolls at your sister\u2019s personal life in the meanwhile.\u201d\n\n\u201cHer,\u201d Miriam said, and was already walking.\n\nThe ambulance made a small bright room in the rain. Steam lived on the inside of the windows like breath on a mirror. A woman with plaited hair and a frog sticker on her name badge lifted the corner of the blanket and said in a voice that had been trained on football terraces and nurseries, \u201cHere\u2019s your professor,\u201d and Tabby, ridiculous, beautiful, infuriating, turned her head.\n\nIt was both entirely her and not at all anyone she knew. Her hair, which was a promise to chaos at the best of times, had been made into terrible plaits by the water and its cold hands. Her face was pale and then, under it, another paleness. Her mouth did a shape that said I am here and also I am sorry. She was wrapped as if she belonged to the laundry, all white and corners. At the edge of the blankets you could see her feet, purpled and ancient like they were having a separate career. Her eyes, which could be sunshine when she wanted, were wet diamonds you would immediately pawn to get her safe.\n\n\u201cHey,\u201d she said, in her stupid old voice. \u201cHello, Mim.\u201d\n\n\u201cHello,\u201d Miriam said. There was a small ungenerous part of her that wanted to shake the ambulance until all its needles chimed. The rest of her moved forward with a blanket of its own. She put two fingers on Tabby\u2019s knuckles. \u201cYou were supposed to be in a chair somewhere reading about fairtrade soaps, you unutterable goat. You have given me\u2014 I have less hair than I had yesterday.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was with a chair,\u201d Tabby whispered, and the breath made her voice misbehave. \u201cI was with Darragh, but never for long. I think I\u2014 I think I fell in love with the railings, is the issue. And then I got wet. I have been told that my choices were suboptimal.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe is coherent,\u201d said Frog Badge, writing without looking at the paper, like a magician. \u201cShe is shivery and she is embarrassed. We like embarrassed. That means there is someone to be embarrassed. We\u2019re going to go to Royal Berks. You can come in the back if you promise to be furniture. She going to have words with anyone who likes forms, but we\u2019ll get the core done. She keeps saying she\u2019s sorry to every inanimate thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am,\u201d Tabby said, and shut her eyes as if exhausted by the effort. \u201cI was going to go and have a pee and then the universe did something. Don\u2019t make a thing,\u201d she added, eyes open again, urgent as foxes. \u201cDon\u2019t you make this into a thing with scaffolding.\u201d\n\n\u201cI refuse your permission to prevent me scaffolding this,\u201d Miriam said, evenly, because there were languages she showed to strangers and this was not one of them. \u201cI\u2019ll be a chair,\u201d she said to Frog Badge. \u201cThank you. Thank you for the chair.\u201d\n\nThe ride to Reading was a short novel in which not much happened and everything mattered. The road made the exact same curve it always made at the business park that had tried, twice, to rebrand itself by planting trees with names. The ambulance murmured to its innards. Tabby\u2019s breath, under the burr of diesel and air conditioning and other people\u2019s crises, was the only song Miriam trusted. Frog Badge asked questions that were a lullaby of bureaucracy: had she eaten, had she had a head injury ever, had she drunk something that tasted like irony. Tabby answered in increments, faithfully, almost cheerful. \u201cSorry,\u201d she said when she got off by a tone, then \u201coh god, I\u2019m sorry again,\u201d and the paramedic laughed and said, \u201cWe\u2019re delighted. Keep apologising. Keep that going.\u201d\n\nIn A&E the air smells, always, like disinfectant that has gotten ideas about itself and like coins. They were given a space that was a curtain and then a different space that was a chair. Things that were not about them happened at speed. An elderly man shouted a name that might have been his wife\u2019s or his dog\u2019s or a saint\u2019s. A child with a dinosaur on their T-shirt announced that blood was not supposed to be outside. Time performed its trick of being idiotically fast and impossibly slow simultaneously. A nurse took a series of numbers from Tabby and from the numbers decided to keep her. \u201cYou went lovely and cold,\u201d she said, kind as a biscuit with a past. \u201cWe\u2019ll warm you back to the right bit. Then we\u2019ll have a chat about why water thinks you are an ingredient.\u201d\n\nMiriam did the things that the grew-up parts of your life demand. She handed over the boots. She fielded a call from Darragh in the corridor where a poster asked her if she had checked her balls lately in an inclusive, determined font. He sounded like a boy who had not learned yet how to hold a glass with one hand. \u201cThey won\u2019t even let me in,\u201d he said, as if hospitals were gigs with a bouncer sexually jealous of his aura. \u201cI said I was family and they did that face.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are not family,\u201d Miriam said. \u201cTo them, to me, to paperwork. Stop making personnel do faces. Go home and change your wet socks. Don\u2019t text her for an hour unless you have to. Then text me. If a woman at a desk asks you to fill out a thing, fill it and don\u2019t draw cartoons in the margins. I will call you when it is not a corridor.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou think this was\u2014\u201d he began, and there laid its teeth the thing that had been scuttling along the skirting board of her mind since the call. \u201cShe didn\u2019t\u2014 I mean, she\u2019s not\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cShe is not a public health myth,\u201d Miriam said, and then, softer, because she could hear his exhale pulling against his ribs, \u201cI don\u2019t think she meant to. I don\u2019t think the railings mean anything except that the council will have to put up one more sign about common sense. We will ask the questions you can\u2019t ask because you turn them into a mime. Go home and eat something a person cooks. Don\u2019t drink. Consider that we all have to live after this, and you can be useful in that after if you behave like a tool with the right head.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I bring her fox socks?\u201d he said, in the miserable voice of a man negotiating with a god. \u201cShe likes the fox socks.\u201d\n\n\u201cBring them later,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen she is tired of all this and wants to be reminded that toes exist. Later, when the drama has had a nap.\u201d\n\nShe went back to the curtain and found a doctor with hair going grey in the neatest possible way, who could have been a sympathiser at an allotment meeting. He said the sensible words in the sensible order: mild hypothermia, observation, tests because the note-sheets are greedy and like a blood for luck. \u201cWe\u2019ll ask someone to have a proper wellbeing conversation,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t tend to leap to conclusions in either direction if we can help it. There\u2019s a lot of water and a lot of people who think next to water. Does she have someone she would like who is not you. No offence. Sometimes a different ear\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cShe would like me,\u201d Miriam said. \u201cAnd she would like to be told that she can be as alive as she in fact is without needing to prove it in wet. She would like to not be asked in front of a whiteboard whether she feels like a danger to herself. She would like to be asked at a window whether she feels like she\u2019s swallowed a small lake. She ought to be asked quietly if there were any precipitating events, and then I will glare at her until she tells you about the thing she tries to call not-a-thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow many sisters like you do you suppose we get in a day,\u201d he asked, not unkindly, and she laughed because she heard the absurdity of her tone and because that way you confess you have heard yourself and the doctor need not get his hackles up. \u201cWe\u2019ll do the human version,\u201d he said. \u201cThank you. Sit. Drink that tea someone might bring. Pretend you are the one in charge for a bit and then agree with the expert when they contradict you. She\u2019ll be fine. She is fine. But the bit with words is as important as the bit with blankets.\u201d\n\nWhen they were alone again, Tabby looked at her with the particular mix of challenge and plea that made Miriam want to cuff the past. \u201cI didn\u2019t,\u201d she said, as if she had been instructed to admit a thing she had not done. \u201cI promise you. Don\u2019t you put this into the box with the worst things. I went to look. I went to\u2014 the water does that thing. It looks like an answer whether or not you asked the question. I was talking to Darragh because he was saying a string of sentences that seemed as if they were about me and were obviously about something he read on a forum. And then he said the thing you hate, you know the thing, the bit where he says, \u2018You\u2019re too much for this,\u2019 and you\u2019re supposed to be grateful that he sees your intensity and is not a coward about it. And I wanted a world that isn\u2019t a pub or a bed or a fake plant in a restaurant, and the lock was there. And I took off my boots because I needed to put my bare feet on a thing that was not a man. And then I leaned. And the world shifted by a degree.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe world is a child you are not permitted to spin,\u201d Miriam said, and then caught herself because she wasn\u2019t there to do an allegory. \u201cAnd you,\u201d she said, and it came out like a prayer and a scold. \u201cYou send me a postcard like a cryptic crossword and a scarf-on-railing like a stage direction, and you expect me not to dress the set.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t send the scarf,\u201d Tabby said. \u201cI can barely work my own phone when it\u2019s dry. Darragh texted you the other night when I left my pocket on the bar. He\u2019s a man who thinks other people\u2019s boundaries are an experiment. But the postcard, yes. That was me. I stuffed it under your door because it felt like you were going off into a room with a lot of lights where they might decide which bits of you counted and I wanted\u2014 I wanted to put a beacon in your pocket. Sad that I have invented anxiety theatre by mistake. Don\u2019t make the face. You\u2019d have a face if I bought you a lighthouse.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour handwriting is better when you\u2019re not cold,\u201d Miriam said, because there were seventy other sentences that wanted to get out and this one seemed like the least likely to set the curtain on fire. \u201cDon\u2019t do this again. Or if you must do water, do bath. Do tea. Do soup. Do cold peas on a bruise. If you need wind, put your head out of a window and shout at a pigeon. Or come and shout at me. I will be a better pigeon than the river.\u201d\n\nTabby laughed then, a small unspooling sound, and put her head back against the pillow as if she had found the exact place her skull had been kept for her. For a moment, it looked like the kind of laugh they used to do in the evening when they were meant to be going to bed and had instead chosen to turn all the tops of the felt pens upside down so that in the morning their mother would swear, very politely, like a woman doing a crossword who discovers that all the clues have been replaced by teeth.\n\nThe police did come and do questions, but they did them in a way that made her like Detective Ellison more. He stood with his notebook like a man who has decided to keep it forever so it must be used with ceremony and did not write the word suicide even once on a page that did not warrant it. He asked whether she had meant to go in and she said no, like a woman proud of a number she\u2019d got right in maths. He asked whether she had ever done anything like this before and she said no, unless you count when she tried to ride a shopping trolley down a slope at fourteen because someone called Eddie had made the trolley look like church. He asked about the photo and Miriam handed over the number written on the back of a wrapper she had pulled out of her coat like a magician producing lint. He made the old joke about it always being an 07 and then he stood it aside and said they\u2019d look and that if he had his way the world would contain fewer railings and more beds.\n\nHe left them in a way that suggested he could be phoned again without it being a betrayal of mood. Outside the curtain someone dropped a tray and four people said \u201cSorry\u201d like bells. A woman with an arm in a sling explained loudly to her boyfriend that she had texted his mother because in a crisis you go to the person who knows what to do with chicken. It was all so outrageously ordinary that Miriam felt suddenly and inexplicably grateful to every notice stuck to a wall with a thumb tack. Don\u2019t leave children on trolleys. Remember your prescription. If you are experiencing chest pains and are over forty-five, please tell us in the next six minutes. She would have married any of those sentences, given the chance.\n\nWhen she went for tea a nurse with eyebrows like punctuation said, \u201cWe saw you on that promo. The Night Stage. It\u2019ll be on the telly. Are you doing that thing with the pen?\u201d Miriam said she was and the nurse said, \u201cYou nearly made me crash the trolley when I watched it, but don\u2019t do it now; you\u2019ll give me palpitations and then we\u2019ll have to triage me and that\u2019s just\u2014 no,\u201d and then handed her a tea that was extraordinary for containing such an amount of milk she could have floated in it.\n\nNadine rang and did her voice that sits the right side of giddy. \u201cWe can push rehearsal by two hours,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ll move a comedian. They always think they go last; it\u2019s like some law.\u201d There was a pause and then the voice went a notch warmer, the zone producers use when they suspect a human is being a human. \u201cDo you\u2014 if you want to\u2014 I mean, if your sister is a part of your story that you want to\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cShe is a part of my life I wish to keep,\u201d Miriam said, and softened the flatness with breath. \u201cI know what you mean. Maybe. Let\u2019s not put a camera in a corridor. I will bring her to wave at you from a seat with consent that has bubbles around it. We will make a sign, and she will enjoy making the sign, and then when I say defiance you can put in a shot of her pretending to be bored. Don\u2019t put any water in a montage or I will set my loop station on fire and call it art.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would watch that,\u201d Nadine said, and then she was wise enough to not to say anything else except, \u201cWe can fetch you on a bike or a cloud. Tell me what you need.\u201d\n\nIn the end the need was small: a hotel room with a bed that didn\u2019t do the thin duvet thing and a kettle that didn\u2019t smell of fish. Tabby agreed, without her usual scroll of conditions, to take Miriam\u2019s couch for a few days. She could see the care home from Miriam\u2019s upstairs window, she said. She liked the sight of it, a ship in port. She would go visit their mother in the morning and explain, in a voice calibrated to parenthood and sweetness, that she had gone for a very stupid paddle, that someone had told her off gently, that everything was boring now as requested. She would stay off the internet and away from Darragh for seventy-two hours and then decide whether men named after hills were an object for a future.\n\nThey got discharged late with paperwork like a novella. A woman at the desk had a collection of ceramic frogs that would have made the frog on the paramedic\u2019s badge feel part of a movement. In the car park the air had the sour-sweet smell of things that have been closed for too long and might, at any moment, open. On the way home Tabby fell asleep with the radio on and Miriam drove like a person carrying something on a tray that could not be spilled. Her hands on the wheel were the exact hands that had held a mouse at a university computer twenty hours ago, and that was a different country with different laws.\n\nAt home Eileen appeared as if out of a Emile Zola novel about neighbourliness with soup and with a bag of bread rolls that had been cut on the diagonal, because presentation matters even when the protagonist is despair. She looked at Tabby with the precise courage of a woman who has prayed for people and found that prayer is better at making the person who does the praying feel less ridiculous than it is at doing the work. \u201cYou gave us all a fright,\u201d she said, and Tabby said, \u201cI know, I know, I\u2019m so\u2014\u201d and Eileen raised a hand without touching and said, \u201cNo sorry. I\u2019ve been instructed by a professional to stamp on apologies like cockroaches. Eat soup and be seen.\u201d\n\nThey ate soup and were seen. The couch announced its springs. The blue scarf hung over the radiator like it had staged its own rescue. Miriam put the postcard on the mantelpiece partly to make it answer for itself and partly because it seemed to scratch every surface it was put upon if hidden away. They didn\u2019t say much. They watched a programme in which people pretend to hate each other for a cake and found it soothing. When it was time to sleep, Tabby\u2019s breathing went out like a bread garnish on an old soup, and she slept the sleep of people who have had actual drama rather than theoretical. Miriam lay awake longer because that is the deal you sign when you are the one responsible for filling out the forms and being the chair.\n\nShe went downstairs once, the house dark and agreeable, and sat with the loop station like it was a person. She put down a single line with her voice so quiet she could feel the vibration more than she could hear it, something like a humming to a kettle. She added to it a soft percussive touch with her fingertips on the wooden table, the old sound of wood considering itself a drum. She put, under that, the breath the ambulance had made her listen for. It built. It didn\u2019t grow showy. It just made a basket for her thoughts to climb into. And when she stopped it, the room did that beautiful thing again, that fall into a silence that feels like acceptance. If she was telling a story to the camera, she might one day tell that, and not the way the paramedic wrote without looking, or the way Detective Ellison hid his notebook like a sacrament. She might tell the truth that the most defiant thing sometimes is to be quiet and not fill it.\n\nMorning was crisp and mean, like a skeleton trying on a cardigan. Tabby, contrary, woke singing, very quietly and quite off-key, which meant her nose was still not fully decided about breathing. She made a face at her own breath and said, \u201cYou are going to be obscene on television.\u201d Miriam told her she\u2019d only promised to be moderately scandalous and Tabby said, \u201cCall it obscene anyway; it reads better on placards,\u201d and then put the kettle on like a note returned to a tune after a long bridge.\n\nThey worked out a plan that had pillars. Between the pillars were rubber bands because that was realistic. Tabby would ring Darragh and say the thing people in respectable pamphlets advise you to say when you want everyone to continue existing: \u201cI need to be in a different room for a bit.\u201d Miriam would go to rehearsals with a suitcase and a list. Eileen would be their neighbour with the extra key and the knowing look that said she would call the fire brigade if she thought a candle had impure thoughts. They texted the care home and got three heart emojis and a photograph of their mother\u2019s hand holding a spoon as if it were the stem of a flower. They put the fox socks in the bag because Miriam is not a purist and no person is entirely a metaphor.\n\nAt Hammersmith the river braided itself with light as if it were trying jewellery. The venue was a theatre pretending to be a television and vice versa. The foyer did an impression of an airport and the backstage was\u2014 as always\u2014 part village hall, part spaceship. Nadine met them with a lanyard and an expression that was about fifty percent good auntie and fifty percent woman who had found out at breakfast that one of her jugglers had sprained something precious. Tabby wore her coat like armour and walked slightly ahead as if daring the building to find her a seat she was not equal to. She did not flirt with any of the security men which suggested either a new phase in her life or an excess of tiredness that might have put her on a scale.\n\n\u201cIs this the sister,\u201d Vee said, appearing like a cat from the high bits. \u201cYou look like the person he wrote the poem about.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no he,\u201d Tabby said, carrying herself with a dignity that still had jam in its hair. \u201cThere are only men who have yet to be instructed to bring fox socks. Nice spine, by the way.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks,\u201d Vee said brightly. \u201cI borrowed it from a whale.\u201d\n\nOn the stage Miriam did the walking to and fro that looked like trying on a pair of shoes that were the exact size and yet made your toes think about the future. She built the song to a point and then spoke, trying to hit the strange smile that lives between So this is me and Please don\u2019t forget to choose someone kind after me. It would be, she decided, the Barbara Allen after all. Not the first, no; but later, and she would steal its refrain and make it something that was not death but its cousin, the long refusal. Rory in the corner made a noise with his mouth as if to begin a sentence and she said, with a grin that made his mouth stop, \u201cWe will call it a ballad without the corpse,\u201d and he made the sign with his hand that meant he was both exasperated and proud like a younger brother.\n\nShe came off-stage to Tabby perched on a plastic chair expediently eating a sandwich like a sparrow eats a planet. Tabby said, with her poshest mouth, \u201cThat will do it,\u201d and Miriam said she hoped so and Tabby said, \u201cNot for them, for you,\u201d as if she had a share portfolio in Miriam\u2019s soul.\n\nIn the unexciting hour between sound check and the bit where someone asked her to be filmed pretending to walk into the building, Detective Ellison rang back. He had a number for her that made the unknown number not unknown. \u201cIt was the dog walker,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s called Owen. He didn\u2019t know where the thing was and he found your sister in his phone because she left it in a pocket and he believes in God and in good deeds. He took the picture to show us where because he is tidy. He said sorry because he thought photos of despair are rude. It turns out it was a picture of a scarf. We have told him he is a citizen. I said I\u2019d tell you because there were shapes, and sometimes it takes someone with badge to say the shape is not the shape you think it is.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d she said, and meant it with the whole breadth of her. \u201cTell him his God did useful work on the Kennet today. Tell him I have a postcard about light that I am trying not to get superstitious about.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am trying not to be superstitious about my football team,\u201d he said, with unearned intimacy. \u201cWe can try together. Good luck with your singing. Make them cry.\u201d\n\nShe did not intend to make anyone cry. She intended to do the precise thing you do when you take a bunch of vibrations and coax them into a shape and make a room agree with you that there is a universe where breath lives longer than an advert. She intended to make Tabby forget water. She intended to put the light where she had promised and see if it remained when the camera turned away.\n\nLater, when the heads of the producers were small dots with teeth and she was back in her dressing room with a bulb-ringed mirror that appeared to have been built by an enthusiastic minor god, Tabby knocked in a way that made the door do a tiny dance and came in with a sign she had made using three colours and an unjustified number of exclamation marks. It said: MIM BLAZE, which was not her name and yet was a better name than she\u2019d ever come up with in an emergency. Tabby had drawn flames that looked like a child\u2019s attempt at drawing kelp. She put the sign in the corner by the flowers that had arrived with a note from the department that said clever things about medieval but made her want to kiss them all on the crown.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to ask you one more time about what your heart wants,\u201d Tabby said. \u201cWhatever you do, don\u2019t say soup. They\u2019ll cut it next to a clip of someone crying over juggling.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will say defiance,\u201d Miriam said, and then she reached for her sister\u2019s hand and squeezed it in the way you squeeze a thing to see how solid it is. \u201cAnd love, possibly. And the wind. And the loop of a song that does not let you drown even when you lean too far. I might say railings.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you say railings,\u201d Tabby said, \u201cI will have to marry one out of pity.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou would,\u201d Miriam said. \u201cYou would elope with municipal infrastructure.\u201d And the two of them laughed the kind of laughter that frightened nobody and made the room increase.\n\nShe had not done the thing yet. The stage was a promise with a queue. The world outside was doing bins and buying onions. Her mother was, somewhere, being sung to by a carer who had decided that the word daisies was good luck. A detective who loved a football team was trying not to read omens into the colour of the sky. A dog who had done a good deed was possibly being given bacon under a table. And Miriam, who had thought once that all you could do was become unshakable, understood now that what you do is become willing and then stay. She looked at the postcard propped against the mirror, its plum sea an exaggeration of English water, and said aloud, because sometimes you tell the truth into glass before you say it into air, \u201cLight where you left it,\u201d and the words sounded thriftily beautiful. Then she put on the navy jacket, the one that made her shoulders look like a decision, and went to war with a room by using a melody that had survived worse than television.",

                              "content": "They called it a holding room as if it were designed to catch people whose thoughts might otherwise spill. It had a sofa that belonged in a regional dentist and a water cooler that made noises like a fretful animal. Miriam moved around it with practiced politeness, stepping over cables the way city people step over puddles. The loop station sat on the low table like a tame creature that might remember its wilder cousins if you startled it. Nadine came in and out on her soft shoes, adjusting the world by quarter turns. Rory appeared in her doorway to test his headset against her calm. He did not ask her not to say medieval. He said, instead, \u201cWhen you say defiance, imagine you\u2019ve just remembered where you put your keys. It should sound like relief as much as fight.\u201d\n\n\u201cRelief,\u201d she said, and rolled the word on her tongue as if testing for stones. \u201cI can do relief.\u201d\n\nTabby had been installed by an usher with a kindness diploma in Row G, seat 17, because 17 made the usher happy for reasons of numerology or lunchtime quizzes. She sent a photograph of her own knees and the way the stage looked between the heads and then a second photograph that was just a blur of lights and the corner of her sign. Miriam pretended to find it entirely legible and texted back an emoji she had learned from her students that meant, variously, may your timing align with your heart and also this has made me laugh unexpectedly and will save me through a committee. Cal sent a selfie of himself and Bex at The Crooked Wren where the landlord had put the volume up so high that you could hear the sound of someone clapping and think it was weather. Eileen wrote: We are in. Mr Hughes says the devil is in it but he has laid out crisps. The care home replied with a photograph of their mother\u2019s hand and a note saying We are prepared to be astonished in a tone that made Miriam imagine the whole room leaning forward at once.\n\nShe did the rituals that, uninspected, might have looked like superstition. She tuned the concertina with the care of a person whose hands must remember an old friend\u2019s face. She put the pen in the pocket where it would not be rattled into announcing itself. She warmed her voice so gently the air barely lifted to meet it. She looked once at the postcard propped against the mirror and lowered her eyes because glass had a way of asking you questions you were not prepared to answer. When a woman with a clip board and a pen like a conductor\u2019s baton came to the door and said, \u201cWe\u2019ll take you to stand by,\u201d Miriam stood and discovered that her legs had remained serviceable. She lifted the loop station case and felt the weight settle into a place on her body that knew how to carry.\n\nBackstage had the ordinary glamour of an organized kitchen. People moved without collision. Someone breathed into their cupped hands like a person about to sit an exam. A man with a square jaw made shapes with his mouth that suggested vowels were something he polished. The corridor hummed with electricity and starch. She saw Vee stretching in a sideways doorframe like punctuation and gave her a grin that came back twice the size. The floor manager walked her onto the wings, and the stage opened its dark mouth as if prepared to swallow or confess.\n\nThe host\u2019s voice filled the room with a warm varnish. He had a way of saying names that made you believe you had always been famous. He said Professor without making it sound like a promise that could not be kept. The soft story they had filmed in Wokingham began on the big screen and she watched herself in public through a crack in the scenery, a tiny woman peering at a version of herself that had been taught to look a certain way on purpose. There she was touching vegetables like a Victorian tourist in a market. There she was in her office next to the stern-watched poster of Daphne Oram, saying a sentence about mouths and inheritance that seemed truer now that there were ten thousand bodies attached to the listening.\n\n\u201cHere she is,\u201d the host said, and his hand did that odd, expensive gesture as if releasing pigeons. The floor manager made a circle with her finger. Miriam walked into the light, and the light held.\n\nThe room received her as if it had been taught how. The audience made the sound audiences make when they are not certain whether to applaud now or later, then did both. The panel arranged their faces into interest. The camera crane moved like a slow polite bird. Miriam put the loop station down like a small altar, took her place behind the mic, and discovered again the exact shape of her lungs.\n\n\u201cHello,\u201d she said, because you always start with something smaller than the thing itself. \u201cI sing old songs in new ways. I like the ones that have learned how to survive. This is a song about people keeping each other alive. It\u2019s about defiance,\u201d and she did not look at Rory in the wings, because if you give relief too much attention it might leave.\n\nShe began with the small percussive, a tap-tap with the pen on the spine of a book she had brought because it had the right body, thick paper with a yielding grain. The room adjusted its breathing. She laid down the concertina\u2019s low line, catching it on the loop a whisper before the end of the fourth bar, that small magic that made the machinery serve the ear and not the other way around. Then the higher voice, close and close enough to be uncomfortable until it was necessary. She added the tick of fingernails on wood, the soft mechanical click that sounded like a distant footfall in a hallway. The pattern was a net. She stepped into it.\n\nShe sang the refrain she had stolen and altered, the place where Barbara Allen refuses death made into a gentle, stubborn no to something else. She did not make a corpse. She made a promise. \u201cOh love,\u201d she sang, \u201coh heart of mine, not yet, not yet,\u201d and a hundred heads tipped a degree as if the words had bumped a memory. She slipped her own line in beneath it, almost like a joke for three people who were listening for it: \u201cLight where you left it,\u201d she sang, not verbose, just the words like a prayer in a pocket, and the loop took that line and held it the way you hold the beginning of a thought when you are getting your coat and not losing your keys.\n\nThe room did what rooms do when sound organizes them. It leaned forward. The panel\u2019s faces altered with human concentration. She saw, without looking hard, the shimmer that was Tabby\u2019s sign and beneath it her sister\u2019s face, softer than a few days ago and more alive than yesterday had let her believe. She added a line of her own voice in the low register that only arrived by mid-afternoon, the one that made people say things like rich as if they had tasted it. She lifted the melody up once and then refused to lift it again, letting it argue for the ground. She sang the refrain and the loop sang back, imperfect and faithful, and she heard the absurdity of it\u2014her voice holding her voice up\u2014and found it beautiful enough to make her think about crying later when no one had lights and clipboards.\n\nWhen she stopped, the room held the silence that follows music when it has done its job. It was not long. It was long enough to feel like a natural phenomenon. The applause came like weather. She bowed with a care that felt properly stern, as if what had just happened had to be asked to remain in the room for a while.\n\nThe host came in smiling like a person claiming to have found a small coin in a fountain and invited the panel to say their sanctioned human things. The woman at the far end with the kind mouth said, \u201cThat felt like a spell someone made to use in kitchens,\u201d and then apologized as if to a skeptic, and Miriam said, \u201cI\u2019m not offended by spells,\u201d and the room laughed in that relieving way that means they have permission to be serious and then to laugh and then serious again. The middle panelist, who was paid to be abrupt, said something about risk that was actually admiration and then caught himself and reframed it as competition. The comic at the left said, \u201cI feel like stationery has been hiding its talents,\u201d and she said, \u201cIt\u2019s all about the right pen,\u201d and the host said, \u201cVote now if you think she brought the light where\u2014\u201d and then checked himself, as if worried he had made a private thing public, and finished with something about should she be in your final three. The country, variously, dialed.\n\nBackstage, the sound man found her hand without quite intending to and squeezed it with a professionalism that could not entirely hide affection. \u201cYou did the thing,\u201d he said, which in his language meant you did not let the machines show. Nadine, who had been standing still for eight minutes like a person trying to prevent a cake from falling, exhaled and said, \u201cThey cut to your sister when you said that line and I\u2019m going to take the credit as if I orchestrated a Roman triumph,\u201d and Miriam said, \u201cYou can have the drums,\u201d and Nadine said, \u201cI\u2019ll have the banner.\u201d\n\nHer phone, in the small quiet after, discovered it had friends. Cal sent a cascade of capital letters that looked like a man falling down stairs while singing. Bex wrote: I have a fringe now because of you. The students were dramatic and sweet, the feed full of screenshots with circles and arrows as if what mattered could be held steady with punctuation. Detective Ellison texted a single woo that surprisingly read like a man who had not shouted woo in a while and found he liked the way his mouth made the shape. The care home sent a short video of their mother, head bent, fingers doing an absent-minded two-three on the arm of the chair that matched the rhythm from the loop, and the carer\u2019s voice, off-camera, making a small sound that might have been a laugh or a prayer.\n\n\u201cDo not cry,\u201d Tabby said, in the wardrobe department with its smell of hardwork glamour, appearing like a person summoned by a thought. \u201cDon\u2019t do it. You\u2019ll have to retouch and then the make-up woman will have to knead your face like dough and you\u2019ll resent butter for a month. You were obscene in the correct manner. You need to eat something that has one syllable. Bread. Chip. Cheese.\u201d\n\n\u201cI said the line,\u201d Miriam said, and heard the rational childishness of her own pride.\n\n\u201cYou did,\u201d Tabby said, and her eyes did that brief glass thing that runs you through like a small sword. \u201cYou did it like a person who had asked permission and then forgot to care. I took it as mine, by the way. I am perfectly willing to share but I will be litigating if I see it printed on a throw cushion.\u201d\n\nThey watched the others from a gap in a curtain, two faces in the dark like conspirators in a very low-stakes heist. Vee looked like a question mark at war with gravity and made the room remember it had spines. The boy with the toy piano played something that sounded like what sadness does when it thinks no one is looking and people who believed in grown-up instruments leaned forward as if they had been fooled and were grateful. The comedian redeemed his rehearsal with a story about teaching his mother to use voice notes that made half the room confess, with their laughter, to having said something unforgivable to a machine.\n\nThe voting was a slow machine with a sincere smile. The hosts did the mathematics with faces trained to make numbers look friendly. Names were called and faces did the thing that faces are paid for. Miriam stood with her loop station case in her hand and Tabby\u2019s fingers dug into her other palm as if to keep her in the building when the room tilted. When her name was called for the top three she made the noise you make when you open a drawer and find something you didn\u2019t know you\u2019d lost and also didn\u2019t know you cared about. When another name won\u2014because it did, the boy with precise hands who played the toy piano with such seriousness it made people want to be careful of cups\u2014she felt the feeling she had rehearsed in her sensible brain but not in her blood: the odd mixture of relief that the tent had been parcelled elsewhere and a small ache like a bruise in an obvious place. She clapped like a citizen. She turned to Tabby, who had expected both possible worlds and was prepared for the work of both.\n\n\u201cYou got the thing you came for,\u201d Tabby said, not permitting argument. \u201cYou got to make ten thousand people hold their breath and not because something had fallen over. You got to write yourself back onto your own face. The rest is men in offices, and everyone knows men in offices will eventually, given exposure to decent chords, do the right thing.\u201d\n\nThe after-rooms were the jostle you get when a wedding and a school play have a baby. People shook hands for no reason and took pictures to prove that strangers fade less quickly than you think. Nadine\u2019s scarf had an extra loop to it that suggested she had rescued something from a ledge by the judicious use of lists. Rory looked like a man who had met his bedtime and negotiated an extension with good grace. The panel were whisked away by people who moved fast without seeming to move and the hosts were suddenly in different shoes. Someone handed Miriam a bottle of water with her name spelled right on a sticker and she thought that, even if no other commemorative objects existed, this was satisfactory in its way. Vee hugged her with the bendiness of an emotion and said, \u201cYou owed me nothing and you repaid me with my own spine. That\u2019s good interest,\u201d and the boy with the piano shook her hand gravely, two-handed, like a small mayor opening a library.\n\nA producer with a pen in his pocket as if storing a spare rib materialized to talk in the voice of potential. He said there was a festival in a field that would find her comforting and alarming in equal measure and could only benefit from such tension. He said there was a woman at a radio station who liked to pretend she discovered people and would enjoy pretending. He said if Miriam wanted to talk about an album there was a man who understood microphones like other people understand types of cheese and had a barn with a temperament. Miriam, in a mood she recognized from rare good days in committee, said yes and then trimmed it to perhaps and then widened it with possible and then tucked three business cards into the pocket of the jacket that made her feel like a correct version of herself.\n\nThey waited until they could go home without apologizing to the people who had put the lights away. They walked out onto the river path where the air had changed temperature as if someone had enacted a policy. The Thames glowed like a thing pretending to be obedient. Tabby took her arm and then let it go and then took it again because that is how sisters demonstrate both independence and dependence without embarrassing either.\n\n\u201cDarragh texted,\u201d Tabby said, looking like a person who had not quite made peace with choosing not to perform. \u201cHe said he cried watching a dog food advert and thinks he is not safe to be in charge of his own heart. I told him to buy a lamp and learn its ways. I said he could bring the fox socks on Wednesday if he promised to say nothing that sounds like a slogan. He replied with six fox emojis and an apology to the concept of water.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou gave him an assignment,\u201d Miriam said. \u201cThat is healthy. People behave when they are given stationary tasks.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought you said stationery was a percussive instrument,\u201d Tabby said, pleased with herself, and Miriam conceded the point.\n\nEileen had left a note on the hall table written on the back of the council leaflet about roadworks. It said: We cheered when the panel talked like grown-ups. Mr Hughes still thinks the devil is in it but would like you to know that the devil has good diction. There is a casserole in your oven that will be ready when it claims it is ready and not before. P.S. Your mother clapped on two and four and then on one and three. She is a modernist. Sleep. It was both domestic and epic, which is to say it felt like their life.\n\nThey ate the casserole in bowls like people who did not need plates because there were no people to impress. For a while they sat on the floor because there are evenings when you revert to a simpler furniture. The loop station had been put back in its case with unusual reverence and the house made a different tone, as if it were aware of having been left and then found to have managed without you.\n\n\u201cTomorrow we\u2019ll go see her,\u201d Tabby said around a spoonful, already in the act of planning, which was her version of gratitude. \u201cWe\u2019ll take the fox socks even if I haven\u2019t accepted them because your mother is not someone to be cheated of novelty. We\u2019ll take biscuits that look cheap but are actually edible. We\u2019ll sing two verses of something that was not stolen by an advert. We\u2019ll come home before dark because look at us, we are women who respect circadian rhythms.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou say \u2018your mother\u2019 as if we have been assigned the parent in turns,\u201d Miriam said, tenderly, because there were versions of this sentence that she would not have survived if Tabby had chosen them. \u201cWe will do all of that. We will call Detective Ellison and tell him that football is not a superstition and that the Kennet owes him nothing anyway. We will write a thank-you card to a man called Owen who is now stuck in our lives like a helpful burr. We will put the postcard back in its place and not interrogate it. We will, at some point, sleep.\u201d\n\nThey cleaned in a way that fooled neither of them into thinking they had done any serious work and then went to their beds, or to their places that were approximately beds, and lay for a few minutes with the lights off like people in a play practising breathing. Miriam\u2019s phone vibrated in the soft dark with a voice note from Nadine that just said, with no varnish, \u201cThank you,\u201d and then a second from Rory that said, \u201cApologies if this is not my place, but that was the bit where I started believing that television might be useful,\u201d and she listened to them twice because repeating things in the night is a way to put them into a story that does not get deleted when you wake.\n\nSleep came like a patient bus. It was not the kind that arrives triumphantly and demands to be admired; it was the kind that does its job. Her dreams were not heroic. She wrapped a cable carefully into a circle that did not kink. She wrote a list for a man who needed to remember bread. She held her sister\u2019s hand in a river that had been imagined by a child who had run out of blue crayons. In the dream, the water did not take anything it was not entitled to.\n\nMorning arrived, as mornings do, without asking for her opinion. The kettle made its small theatre. The first headline she saw on her phone had lifted her name into that public place where names can be knocked about, but the article, against the odds, was precise and generous. The writer had done the odd thing journalists sometimes do, which is watch without wanting to win at it. They called her set a patient wonder and asked people not to clap along next time in case they frightened the quiet. Miriam smiled into her mug and put the phone down face-first like a person protecting a delicate plant from frost.\n\nOn the way to the care home, carrying biscuits and a tolerance for over-warm rooms, they passed the charity shop where the mirror still leaned in the window like a flirt. The woman with the ethics looked up and did two thumbs, an unBritish gesture she had made habitual, and Tabby blew her a kiss she could catch without consequences. When they reached the building with its decent chairs and its insistence on soft edges, a carer with a pin in her hair and a pair of reading glasses she wore on a chain led them to their mother with the pride of a curator.\n\nShe was a winter person now, their mother. The summer is there in her sometimes like a rumor. She looked up when they arrived and found something in Miriam\u2019s face that made her eyebrows do the small wave they had done in 1992 when someone had asked whether dinner would be pasta again and she had decided to forgive the past. Miriam sat and took the hand that did the clapping, and Tabby sat and put the fox socks where the fingers could find them later. \u201cOn the telly,\u201d the carer said, and their mother said, \u201cYou,\u201d like a person identifying an object in a cupboard that has been moved too high and forgiven for it.\n\nThey sang, not very loudly and not very in tune and with a sense of the appropriate for a room that had other people\u2019s stories in it. Their mother\u2019s voice came like a moth to light, then sat a minute and rested, then came again from a corner. Miriam did the refrain and Tabby did a harmony that was illegal in several counties. A man across the room who had once run a fish stall in Reading whistled and someone else coughed a verdict. It was not television. It was not even a parish hall. It was a small room where the promise of song did the modest work of occupying an hour.\n\nOn the way out, when they had promised nothing extravagant and signed the sheet that meant they might be supervised by someone else\u2019s plan if sirens ever came, Tabby paused by the noticeboard where the calendar reminded people of sherry and a dog on Thursdays. She looked at a poster that said We can be brave every day in a font that meant well and said, \u201cYou\u2019ll do it again,\u201d not looking at Miriam. \u201cNot like that, not even like this. You\u2019ll do it in a different room and someone will look at you like you\u2019ve told them where to put the lamp.\u201d\n\n\u201cPerhaps,\u201d Miriam said, not wishing to be heroic in the foyer of a care home. \u201cPerhaps I will just make soup and teach Miranda to use her eyeliner for good. Perhaps I will answer emails with unusual good grace. Perhaps I will get a cat and name it after a 14th-century poetic form that I will only be allowed to mention at dinner parties if the host is unwise.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re allowed to want the field and the light,\u201d Tabby said, as if the sentence were an ordinary instruction about turning off the tap. \u201cYou\u2019ve demonstrated you can be seen and not evaporate. Go on then. Evaporate a tiny bit. Then condense as a drizzle where we can find you.\u201d\n\nThey walked into a day that had decided on weather and kept it. The river, elsewhere, kept its counsel. The loop station waited on its shelf like a creature that would not leave if not invited. Miriam thought about defiance and about relief and about how poor television is at recording either in a way that can be kept in a drawer. She thought about Detective Ellison\u2019s woo and the sound of the care home\u2019s air conditioning and the way Nadine\u2019s scarf had looked at the end of the night like someone had wrapped twenty thoughts and kept them from blowing away. She thought about the postcard and decided it could stay in its frame for a week without being asked to stand trial.\n\nIn her office on Monday, the ivy plant had found another inch of window and the poster of Daphne Oram looked as if she had changed her mind about a chord and was tempted to try it. Students drifted by the door with a different kind of curiosity; some of them peered in and did a thumbs-up with the solemnity of a ritual. In her inbox, the emails separated themselves like lentils picked over in a kitchen, the urgent ones making themselves shiny, the friendly ones sitting in a small pile waiting to be handled. The subject lines contained congratulations that made her feel older in a nice way and invitations that made her feel like a person with shoes that fit.\n\nShe opened a blank document and wrote a title she would delete in an hour: Things Continuing. She made a list with bullet points that were not bullets, merely dots, and at the end of it she wrote the word nothing and then crossed it out with the neatness of a person who has learned not to give words the power to be too dramatic. When Cal tapped the door jamb and leaned in, carrying coffee he had purchased at a cafe with a tilting green sign that always forgot to wipe its chalkboard, she felt the place in her body that had been resisting soften.\n\n\u201cCeleb,\u201d he said, with the exact amount of mockery. \u201cAre you still a professor or have you ascended.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have ascended to a moderately improved coffee,\u201d she said, and he held his out and they clinked like children. \u201cI am thinking about a field.\u201d\n\n\u201cA field,\u201d he said. \u201cIs this metaphorical or is there a farmer who needs your voice to move cows.\u201d\n\n\u201cA festival,\u201d she said. \u201cIn a field that is temporarily not a field. Someone in a scarf and with a spreadsheet says they want me to be their nightingale. Do you think I can be a nightingale if my best hour is three in the afternoon.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can be a robin,\u201d he said. \u201cRobins sing all the time and will stab a man for crumbs. Also, the nurse who watched you told me not to tell you this but you caused a trolley incident. This is your carnage.\u201d\n\nThey drank their coffee and worked out a plan for keeping basic life alive under the new ornamental additions. She would keep her office hours. She would mark without trying to see how many fractions of herself she could fit in the margins. She would go to London twice a week for a while and not beat herself for liking it. She would send an email to the boy with the piano that said something like you made my hands behave and not worry whether it sounded odd.\n\nAnd when she walked home that evening along the same long green and the same small chalk of path, she found, under the old familiar sense that this was a place that would hold anything you spilled, a new line she had laid down and could not undo. It was not fame, which is a noise and then an absence. It was not a story, which is a shape that you can pretend is the right shape. It was a thread you can feel with your fingers when the lights are off. Light where you left it, said the phrase she had suspected of superstition and decided instead to promote to principle. Light where you left it, and return by the same road if you can, and if you cannot there will be a person with a sign with your name spelled wrong who loves you anyway and will shout at municipal railings on your behalf until they blush.",

                              "content": "The week after the show had the unglamorous habit of occurring. It folded itself into their kitchen, into the habit of tea and the shapes of their shoes by the door, into the emails that cleared their throats with subject lines like quick question re: REF impact and, from a stationer who could smell zeitgeist, a polite inquiry about whether she would consider endorsing a line of pens. Miriam laughed and wrote back that she could be tempted by biros with a good moral character, then spent ten minutes trying to work out how one described a pen\u2019s ethics without sounding like a person lost in a gallery catalogue. She found, too, that people she\u2019d known for years were slightly turned in her direction as if a small magnet had been set on the table. It wasn\u2019t fame and it wasn\u2019t quite curiosity; it was something like relief, as if she had turned out to be legible in a language they knew.\n\nThe field invitation came not as a hagiography but as a PDF with a diagram of tents. The email was signed by a woman called Miles, which made Miriam unimaginatively fond of her at once, and contained the kind of practicalities she found soothing: load-in times, plug types, whether she might object to the presence of a child-friendly silent disco adjacent to her slot. \u201cWe will do our utmost to minimize bleed,\u201d Miles wrote, and the phrase was so cheerfully gothic that Miriam read it aloud to Tabby, who was lying with a fox sock on each hand like a person trying to frighten a small child into joy. They accepted the Sunday afternoon slot on the second stage, the one that sat behind a hedge like a secret kept on purpose, and agreed to a short workshop in the tent with the craft signage where people made willow lanterns and wanted reasons to hum without embarrassment.\n\nThe department greeted her with a combination of sensible pride and precisely calibrated opportunism. The Head\u2014who had got his position partly by pretending he did not crave it\u2014asked in a meeting whether she might like to be the case study in a brochure about impact with a photograph that suggested both scholarship and accessibility, perhaps something with ivy and a shirt without a collar. \u201cNot a glamour shot,\u201d he said, as if this were a word he saved for his wife or for models of bridges, \u201cbut a hero shot for our own purposes. We would like to demonstrate that we are porous to the world without becoming puddles.\u201d She said she would be honored and also could they not make her look as if she had been rescued by a passing lifeboat of good sense. He pretended to be wounded and then asked if she would consider a lunchtime talk on medieval lyric for ordinary people, then caught himself and amended, \u201cFor a broad audience,\u201d and she nodded, pleased, because the word ordinary is a charm if you say it with love.\n\nMeanwhile, Tabby had decided to become temporarily domestic in the way she did, which meant making lists on the backs of envelopes and then ignoring them in favor of acts of compassion that came into range. She left a note for Darragh that used words like space and tenderness and the sentence I am not a hospice for men who confuse romance with escalation. He replied with contrition and a photograph of a fox in a charity shop window, wearing a child\u2019s hat like a crime, and the message I get it, which could mean anything and therefore was allowed. She began volunteering at the care home on Saturdays because, she said, if she was going to visit and cry a bit in the loo she might as well bring cake and a game. The manager\u2014a woman with earrings like small moons who seemed to have an extra hour in her pocket at all times\u2014put Tabby on the rota for Sherry and Songs and told her to stick to rounds people could remember. \u201cDaisies,\u201d she said kindly. \u201cSkye Boat Song. Avoid Sleater-Kinney unless the relatives have been briefed.\u201d\n\nThe barn with a temperament turned out to be on the Wiltshire edge of Berkshire, tucked between a field of rapeseed making a bid for its own sky and a lane that had decided potholes were a permanent art installation. The man who knew microphones like cheese was called Malcolm and had the face of a person who had once been described, by a lover, as \u201cunexpectedly luminous\u201d and had not recovered. He spoke to the equipment the way farmers speak to animals they respect, saying little and altering his whole posture instead, and when he showed Miriam the main room she knew at once that the notes would enjoy living there. The wooden ribs of the ceiling held sound the way a hand holds water without spilling all of it; swallows had built their architecture at the eaves and flew in and out with the proprietary calm of colleagues.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll want the M160 on the box,\u201d Malcolm said, by which he meant the concertina, \u201cand something forgiving on your mouth unless you like hearing your own teeth. You loop in the room or in the box.\u201d He said \u201cbox\u201d for the small glowing rectangle where other people kept whole orchestras and where he kept only the precise amount of magic that a track could tolerate. She said room, because she trusted her hands more than she trusted the small imp who sat within software and occasionally made a snide remark. He nodded as if she had told him a sensible thing about weather and put up a stand with the care of a person setting out a memory.\n\nThey recorded the one she had sung on television not because she thought the world needed a duplicate but because the electrics of the barn convinced it into a new shape. The swallows made a faint, deliberate track above them like someone flipping a book with their nails. A tractor coughed miles off. When she sang the line with light, Malcolm glanced up, as if he hadn\u2019t been expecting to believe in words in a day run by cables. He did not say the word beautiful because he wasn\u2019t allowed\u2014sound men are penalized for that; it\u2019s in their union bylaws\u2014but he shifted a fader as if he had felt the room make a small positive decision about its future.\n\n\u201cLeave it,\u201d he said, when she suggested she might do a cleverer harmony that would prove her cleverness to people who had not specified wanting proof. \u201cThe barn knows what you meant.\u201d They sat and listened back in the cooling of the late afternoon with mugs that tasted of other people\u2019s coffee and looked at each other once when the loop kissed the room imperfectly and found that the imperfection was precisely the right place to leave a thumbprint.\n\nOn the day of the festival the field had to be persuaded into hospitality. Men in high-vis moved with the patience of saints who had once been told that a stage could be assembled by thinking about it hard enough. The air heaved with the scent of damp canvas and fried optimism. A man tuning a violin in the next tent did it in the exact key of a child crying somewhere beyond the falafel queue, which made Miriam, in her piousness, want to place the pair in a duet and call it Art of Britain. Miles found her under a banner about acoustic serenity and introduced her to ten people with first names that told you nothing and lanyards that told you everything, then placed into her hand a laminated card that would let her move through fences like a ghost.\n\nThe second stage was a clean rectangle under fair lights and full of the kind of shadows that made you think of old theatres. There was a rehearsal of a brass band that would follow her in a grateful hour and a woman in a long cardigan arguing affectionately with a man about whether the phrase \u201cvocal fry\u201d had to be retired in feminist solidarity. She set up her loop station on a carpet that had been laid for good luck, taped her cables in place with the same austerity she reserved for making lists of people she loved, and met the stage manager, a square woman called Pru who had the air of being permanently five minutes from an emergency and never more than two steps from a resolution. \u201cWe like you,\u201d Pru said, without evidence, and then shouted at a child gently for attempting to plug themselves into a monitor, and then grinned at Miriam as if to suggest the world was messy and this would not end it.\n\nTabby, who had promised to behave and meant it for once, arrived with Bex and Cal and a bag that might once have contained coleslaw but now contained cherries, duct tape, and a gentle affront to health and safety. She had slept and eaten and put on a dress that made her look like a sensible lighthouse. There was a monitor tent with tea and biscuits and her instinct led her to it as if she had smelled childhood. They bickered about the right time to clap, which was their way of saying I love you in a setting where kissing would make people stop and later tell a story.\n\nThe power died in the middle of her second song. It died with a theatricality that suggested it had once been a performer itself and now resented sitting behind less emotive apparatus. It went with a small theatrically economical pop and the loop died with it, the pedal mute beneath her foot like a friend who has chosen to go offline at a crucial point. There was a sound from the crowd that civilized British people make when they cannot stop a disaster and must therefore narrate it quietly for the sake of their souls. Pru appeared at stage left with the expression of a general whose troops have made an honest mistake, and a man with a tool belt happened onto his stomach with the elegance of an otter and disappeared beneath the stage to speak in his private holy language to the thing that had misbehaved.\n\nIt was not the end of anything. She put her hands up, as if to ask a room to please be so kind as to give her half a minute of the kind of childhood she had enjoyed, and stepped away from the mic so that the habit of amplification would not be offended. She took the concertina up in her arms the way she might, in an emergency, carry a child who did not want to be carried, and began with a line that could travel without electricity because it had tried both ways and found itself wise. She heard her own voice gather the air by the scaffolding and under the hedges and near the clam sellers and make itself taller with the shame of ambition. The people in the front rows did the cleverest thing British people ever do and stopped being brave in favor of being good; they quieted, which let the people behind discover that listening is a communal sport and need not be refereed. She sang, a little ascetic at first and then with an appetite, and by the time the power came back with a cheer that could have been about democracy, no one wanted it for the next two verses.\n\n\u201cLeave it,\u201d Pru mouthed, her voice already halfway to her radio, and Miriam did. She finished acoustic because the day had asked to learn what breath was and she had been arrogant enough to think she could teach it. When electricity returned to its chair like a contrite child, she put the concertina down with ceremony and made a small bow to the mains as if to be polite to the gods. The band after her clapped like people who had just worked out that tradition could be unsupervised. A woman holding a toddler wiped her eyes with a sleeve and then laughed at herself and went in search of a flattering hay bale.\n\nThe brass band were all brass and shoulders and they bristled behind her like a polite weather system. A man in a flat cap leaned into Pru and said something in a tone that made Miriam\u2019s back muscles relax, and then she found herself cornered by an older woman with a voice like gingham who introduced herself as Gwen and explained, without malice, that she had once been the kind of singer who could stop a fight in a miners\u2019 hall and would she mind answering a question about a phrase in Child 84 that she had never been able to get past. Miriam stayed for the question and the three that followed and agreed to write on a postcard the year that Barbara Allen appeared in a broadside ballad because some people carry their arguments until the day they are delivered into the hands of someone with teeth.\n\nLater, in the willow-lantern tent with children using their names for colors and men explaining knots to themselves like prayer, she did the workshop that had sounded on paper like a polite request to present and turned out, in reality, to be an occasion. A boy with hair like a field on fire and a girl holding a map with her mouth asked if they could loop their own voices and she lowered the mic, moved her body, and taught them to do it without the machine. She clapped patterns that could only live for a minute and made them discover, with their own mouths and hands, that repetition is a kind of kindness. An old woman stood at the back and hummed on purpose and a baby made a rhythm under it with one heel and a man who had never been brave about this kind of thing opened his own mouth and found a note that his father had left for him years ago in a cupboard. She told them not to call it therapy unless they enjoyed scaring off fun, and a person with a clipboard wrote down \u201cloop as accompaniment\u201d as if they had just found a way to get money out of a room without frightening it.\n\nIf she had been the kind of person who read the press with intent to survive she might have seen, that evening, how the reviewer in the local paper had turned the power cut into a parable. The phrase held without wires shone there like a pinned moth, making her cringe and then put the paper down so she could continue to live. Instead, she and Tabby and Cal and Bex sat on a patch of grass near a group of teenagers teaching each other how to roll cigarettes with sincerity, and ate something that might have been halloumi in a better world and here, valiantly, was squeaky cheese in a bun. They watched the sun notice itself dramatically in the river. They did not talk about water in the way of confession and grief; they talked about water in the way of thirst and tide times and the way people carry rain inside them all day and only notice at night.\n\nOn Monday the department posted a photograph on its social media that made her look like someone you could ask to hold your baby while you went to the loo\u2014dignified, engaged with an invisible student, hair in a mood with its own agenda. The comments were red hearts and the occasional small fight about whether the university was using her funny folk music to get attention for its less lovable policies. She thought, for an uncharitable minute, that she would like to put Rory and the Head of Department in a room with Bex and make them talk about relevance, then put the kettle on and decided that even without interventions the zwieback of their ambition might still be softened by milk.\n\nDetective Ellison sent a text that contained only a photograph of a football goal that looked like a mistake and the word: Woo. She sent back a voice note that was a single woo sung like a Gregorian chant and then a second woo in harmony that committed small sins against the mode. He replied with the image of a robin sitting on a fence like a foreman, captioned: You. She had the sudden and not entirely comfortable thought that there are people who become part of your life because a thing went wrong and then you have to decide whether to carry them into the bits that go right. It might be that carrying is the thing that keeps the scale honest, she thought. It might be that the story is a boat and everyone gets a seat until they don\u2019t, and no one gets to predict who will become indispensable.\n\nAn envelope posted without ceremony appeared on her hall table on Thursday and contained a thank-you card from a man called Owen with a photograph of a damp dog on the front and a scrawl that said, I didn\u2019t know if it were allowed, but I thought maybe better to let you know what. He had written four sentences that managed, miraculously, not to make anything worse and to nudge something that had been lingering in the hallway towards the door. They bought good biscuits and took them to the park at the time that the note suggested he might be there, and found him in a jacket that had given up pretending to be waterproof, with a dog that looked as if it had made peace with being apologized to for no reason. He showed them, in the sober practice of people who have learned to understate, where he had stood and where he had looked and what he had thought. He did not say the word hero because he had a wife, you could tell, who would gently tell him off if he ever tried to cast himself in such a role without sufficient evidence. They thanked him and then stopped and thanked him again because there are thank-yous that require a double portion.\n\n\u201cDo I get to meet the professor,\u201d he said to Tabby, who was in a bright coat that made the river look as if it had come to play. \u201cI\u2019ve never met a professor who sings in a lock with no power.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s most of our holy people,\u201d Tabby said, cheerfully sacrilegious. \u201cI\u2019m just an auxiliary apostle. She\u2019s the one with the vowels. If you ever need someone to argue with a railings consultant I have built experience.\u201d\n\nThey all stood for a minute, looking at the water the way people who are trying to be sensible look at a cliff. The dog sneezed and shook and made a decision about a gull. It was more ordinary than most safety brochures allow. It made Miriam feel almost indecently grateful to the dull towns of England and their insistence on featuring the same bench in four different decades without developing an opinion about it.\n\nOn a Friday in late month she found herself on a panel in a small library in a city that smelled of dust and ambition, talking about old songs and new mouths. The panel consisted of a folk archivist with eyebrows like quotation marks, a podcaster with the voice of a friendly bell, and a young woman who had just released a record of unaccompanied lullabies and had the height of a person who had been used to standing on tiptoe for the length of an entire childhood. The audience contained two men who would have liked to ask whether the ballads belonged to them and six women who knew exactly who had written them and would fight for the footnotes. Miriam did her lines about carriage and mouth and how songs are portable roofs you can take with you when you move house. She did not say the word defiance because it looked worn that week, like a favorite hoodie, and refused instead to turn gently around it until it felt like it had rested.\n\nAfterward, the podcaster asked whether he might come to her house and record her kitchen for a segment about domestic acoustics. \u201cPeople need to hear what a nice room sounds like,\u201d he said, with such conviction it made her want to show him the cupboard with the slumping Tupperware to see if his faith would hold. She said he could as long as he promised to take his shoes off and not film the calendar that had a note reading DENTIST/TABBY NO in a nervous orange. He promised to be discreet and then tried to normalize his own excitement by listing, too quickly, other kitchens he had had the honor to capture. She laughed and pointed him to the week they would be in Wokingham pretending they had control over the quantity of jam in the house.\n\nThe thing with Darragh did not end theatrically because those things never do, not in real time. He came on Wednesday with the fox socks and a face like a dog who has eaten a bit of the cake and cannot tell you what cake is when asked. He apologized to furniture and railings and to the idea of forewarning. He looked at Tabby with those clever eyes of his that had made Miriam wish briefly that he were not made entirely of strings he liked to tighten and loosen for his own pleasure. Tabby took the socks and put them in the drawer without ceremony and said, \u201cThank you for the socks. Thank you for the bit where you went for help. Thank you for understanding that if we become a thing again we will need to invent a new word for it, and that word will almost certainly not mean what you remember.\u201d He nodded and said he would work on his new word elsewhere and then, almost as if he had learned a trick in a chapter he had not had access to before, he left without a speech.\n\nHer mother\u2019s decline found a steadier pace, which is a way of saying a road can be both beautiful and relentless and you must walk it anyway. They brought biscuits that suggested effort and sang only the first verse and the last of songs because the middle sometimes contains restless water. A new carer made the word Professor into a form of address that felt as if it had won a prize, and Miriam tried not to love the woman too much because the world sometimes removes such people with impunity. They caught their mother staring at the postcard under its frame in Miriam\u2019s hall one morning after a visit, not with comprehension but with a look Miriam recognized from her own face in photographs from the year their father left the first time and then had to be explained back to them by a neighbor who had decided they could manage truth. \u201cThat\u2019s the sea,\u201d their mother said. \u201cNot here.\u201d Miriam said, \u201cNo, not here,\u201d and felt in her chest a small, grateful weight that could have been the day agreeing to continue.\n\nThe man from the radio did call, the one the producer had promised her would pretend to have discovered her, but he turned out to be kind in an unfashionable way. He asked if she wanted to talk about medieval lyric and then caught himself and said, \u201cOld songs. I\u2019m supposed to say old songs. Someone in a headset will bite me if I say medieval.\u201d She granted him dispensation and he whooped and confessed that he had been wanting to say the word since second form when a supply teacher with shoulders like a lamppost had explained to him what a carol used to be. They recorded a small interview in which she tried to sound like a person whose voice could survive the uncharitable compression of a morning show, and when he asked her what she wanted next she did not say an empire or even a festival with a better cheese van. She said, \u201cI would like a room,\u201d and then, because she suspected he needed more, \u201cA room where I can do this for an hour and a half, and then we all go home feeling like we shared responsibility properly.\u201d\n\nIt came, slowly and then all at once, in the way that desires sometimes do when you have not insisted upon them with a megaphone. Miles wrote to say that the field had a winter edition in a town hall with a high ceiling and a stage with a smile. Nadine wrote to say there was a slot late one evening in a venue that had been a post office and now hosted bands and bereavements, which is to say small important evenings with light. The folk archivist wrote to offer the loan of a song that had been in a patched box in an attic for a hundred years and would she like to bring it into a room where hands could be heard turning pages. Malcolm wrote to say that the barn liked the way she left space and would tolerate her again if she did not over-bring pastries. The Head of Department wrote to ask if she might be willing to be on television again to discuss, without smirking, the relationship between old texts and newer threats to truth.\n\nShe said yes to the room. She said yes to a dozen rooms and then pared them down until she had four and then two because she could feel the scaffolding twitch and did not need the whole street to know about it. She told Tabby that she would be gone one evening and then back for breakfast and Tabby threw her a torch with a new battery and said, \"Leave a light and then come find it again.\" They made a list of snacks for trains and medicines for mothers and allotments for men who might be tempted, and then they went to the charity shop and bought two dresses that looked like respectful instruments and repaired the hem of one because life is not television and television is not life and you need clothes that forgive.\n\nWhen she walked onto the stage in the town hall with its polite Georgian windows and its chairs that had been sat on by at least three generations of knees, she felt anything that had wanted to be epic settle into the proper scale. It was her room in the way rooms sometimes consent to be borrowed. The posters on the doors were earnest and the person at the bar wore seriousness as if it were a costume they enjoyed in winter, and the crowd contained three people who had taught her how to do this without knowing it, and the neighbour who believed in the devil and crisps, and an archivist, and a detective, and a woman who had once fixed her boiler and refused payment in money on the grounds that she would accept a song in recompense like a medieval ghost. She tuned her concertina with the care she would have used to touch someone\u2019s face in a museum if such a thing were allowed and then, because it was no longer possible to pretend she was not in the business of asking for things, she asked the room to agree to two rules.\n\n\u201cNo clapping along unless I ask for it,\u201d she said, and they laughed with relief because they had been waiting to be told. \u201cAnd if I sing a line that sounds like it was left for someone, and it is yours, take it without apology. I\u2019ll make another.\u201d\n\nShe sang until the room told her to stop. She watched her own voice learn the shape of the ceiling and bounce back improved. She did the line with light and did not look for Tabby but felt her there the way you feel a radiator in a room, unshowy and relentless. She told the story she had refused on television about their mother stirring soup and leaving the handle of the spoon pointing, always, to whichever of them was in trouble that day, because she had discovered that the words can do what cameras cannot and return privacy to the person who speaks them. She sang a lullaby that had been in the box and brought back down the stairs to live in a throat and she mangled the middle verse and did not apologize because forgiveness had been built into the thing by a woman who had sung it to a child without sleeping for three nights, and that is the only kind of authority she wanted now.\n\nAfter, the man who had once said he did not believe women could sing folk music because it was about them and not by them came up to the edge of the stage and stared at his own shoe for a minute and then said he had been wrong in a voice that made her like him for the first time since he had introduced himself with his middle name as if anyone had asked. The detective waited on the periphery with a program folded in his hand like homework and said he had practiced not being superstitious but found that woo is now a domestic cry in his house. The archivist pressed into her palm a piece of paper with a song on it that had not been sung in that room for a century and said go on then and make a mess, and the neighbor told her that if the devil was in it he had been to charm school and could be tolerated under the right conditions.\n\nShe walked home afterwards with her loop station case bumping her leg like a slow dog and the irreverent bliss of work done properly keeping an old, decent warmth in her elbows. The town had been asleep for half an hour and was now at the bit where the night admits to its own small mischiefs. A fox evaluated the politics of a bin and found them wanting. A window left ajar told her the story of a washing machine. Her house agreed to be her house again and did not try to invent a narrative about deserts and return. She put the postcard back in its frame after dusting the top of the mantel with a sleeve because sometimes the difference between superstition and attention is housekeeping and intention.\n\nUpstairs Tabby had fallen asleep in an arrangement that suggested that she had been mid-thought and lost the thread in favor of breath. On the pillow beside her a notebook lay open with a page that read, in her handwriting which looked, even at rest, like it was walking down a hill: Light brigade, but a kind one, and underneath it a list of things a light could be: torch, window, song, person, memory, kettle. Miriam stood for a second and felt stupidly rich, and then put the kettle on in the line of duty, because there are two kinds of defiance: the kind you announce and the kind you do by getting on with it until it becomes a horizon.\n\nThe next morning, the day started as if it had been doing this forever and was tired of being applauded. The kettle scolded them gently. The ivy in her office found another millimeter to occupy. The inbox filled, politely, with strangers in need of a room to hum in and an old friend from York asking if she would play a set in a museum after hours and a person called Nora\u2014not Cal\u2019s Nora; another one; the world is patchwork\u2014who ran a choir for people who had forgotten where their breath lived and wanted her to show them how to borrow it back. She said yes to two things and no to two and put two into the drawer with the good pens where dreams go to proof for a day. She took down the concertina and then put it back where it wouldn\u2019t be knocked by a door because sometimes love is just storage done with a little thought. She breathed in, not as if about to be brave, but as if about to be exactly as she was, and went downstairs to find that Tabby had put a note on the bread bin that read: today: bread, and below it: also you. She laughed and then cut the bread at an angle because presentation matters, and began again.",

It was the appointment where a woman behind a desk with a name badge that said she belonged to a different decade explained to Miriam and Tabby how to choose words for a future emergency and have them sit in a file without catching fire. The form had boxes that looked too thin to hold the sentences they contained and a margin that seemed to expect less love than it would be required to withstand. They were in a small room at the care home that had a chair with arms like reassurance and a small artificial plant that had learned, under duress, how to look like it was doing its best. The woman, who introduced herself as Jas and smiled in a way that made you believe people could change careers and still carry their competence with them like a reliable coat, said carefully that the forms existed to make difficult days tolerable rather than to tempt fate into flexing. Miriam nodded with the determined politeness of a person being fitted for armor she would rather not need, and Tabby leaned forward as if about to agree to a prank and then remembered that this was not a prank and sat back breathing carefully. \u201cWe\u2019ve done this before,\u201d Miriam said, because they had, in principle if not here with this pen in this room, and Jas nodded as if they had just told her that they were able to swim calmly in cold water and sometimes forgot they knew. They signed in the places they were instructed to sign and they wrote their mother\u2019s name in the space for names like a spell. When they finished, Jas put the papers in a folder the color of respectable jam and said, \u201cThis is good. It means that on a day you don\u2019t choose, someone kind can be certain they\u2019re doing the thing you asked,\u201d and it was such an ordinary piece of magic that Miriam felt, for a second, as if the floor had granted her an extra inch.\n\nOutside, the trees had gone into the part of autumn that involved standards. Leaves committed to a color as if they had been called on it. The air had learned the weight of damp newspapers and last berries. On the walk back, Tabby held the folder while Miriam carried a box that contained an emergency supply of biscuits because it is not sedition to bribe staff, it is citizenship. \u201cDo you feel grown,\u201d Tabby said, with half a tilt towards mischief, and Miriam laughed because the word was a coat that never quite fit. \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve been allowed to spoon the sugar,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel like the world is a teapot that will forgive me if I over-steep.\u201d They stopped at the charity shop where a poster announced a JUMBLE OF JUMPERS in a handwriting that refused to look haunted, and the ethics woman behind the till lifted her chin as if to say that the town had decided to be brave on an overcast Wednesday and would require them to join.\n\nIn the days that followed, life compressed itself into tasks that looked small and turned out not to be. The department asked politely whether Miriam might be available for an open day to be the professor who says something that makes a teenager imagine that a building could be kind. Nadine emailed to ask if she might be willing to return to The Night Stage for a Christmas special that would involve a medley and a snowfall machine and a promise not to use the word medieval within five miles of an executive. Malcolm called softly from the barn to say that the swallows had gone and the room missed their insolence but the microphones were cheerful and ready. Miles proposed a winter thing in a hall that had once been a corn exchange and now hosted cooking demonstrations that frightened butter. Detective Ellison, who had not yet learned how to use emojis without making them perform like show ponies, sent a message with a fireworks icon and, beneath it, an invitation to a charity night organized by the river rescue team that had become, in Miriam\u2019s mind, a stern aunt. The names gathered on the table in her hallway like family at Christmas, and she stood among them with a pen, which was her weapon and her flag, and made careful choices until the pile became a reasonable hill.\n\nIt was the river rescue gig that turned out to test their new arrangement with fate. It was to be held in a function room over a pub that had decided, at some point in its earnest middle age, to become a venue that could cater for wakes and awards ceremonies without flinching. The poster had a picture of a lifebuoy and unforgivable clip art, and a line-up that combined a jazz trio with a woman who had learned to tap dance at eighty-one and insisted on demonstrating. Darragh had been involved at a distance, the way he liked to be involved now, by connecting people with other people and then stepping away to observe his own restraint like a carpenter admiring a shelf. He asked Miriam, in a message that performed contrition with more economy than his previous art, whether she would consider doing three songs and if she insisted on refusing him he would pretend he had never asked. Tabby, reading over her shoulder without pretense, made a face that looked like a rehearsal for a sermon and then said, \u201cYes, but with conditions,\u201d and Miriam, who had been thinking No because taste and Yes because decency and Perhaps because love, wrote back and set down the rules in a tone that did not invite poetry. \u201cI will do two,\u201d she wrote, \u201cand not be photographed without prior consent, and I will leave without apology when I need to. I will sing about staying, and if you try to frame it as a story about water I will bring my entire discipline to bear and dismantle your narrative with love.\u201d He replied with a single sentence that, for once, did not lead to a paragraph: Understood, boss. The word boss made her roll her eyes, but this time it did not make her want to set anything on fire.\n\nThe night of the gig smelled like carpet that had learned to tell stories. Men in shirts with sincerity where buttons should be walked carefully carrying pints as if they contained news. Owen, the dog walker who had become in their minds a kind of local deity, stood near the back with a cup of tea and the air of a man who was frequently content to be a peripheral saint. Detective Ellison was there, at a table with two colleagues who had the gaze of people who assumed they would be asked to move chairs and were prepared for it. The jazz trio wore expressions that suggested they had made peace with sheet music being a suggestion and not a commandment. Tabby arrived in boots that looked equal to a flood and sat with Eileen, who had brought a Tupperware of sausage rolls and an opinion about everyone\u2019s posture. When it was Miriam\u2019s turn, she did not use the loop station. She took the concertina and stood under the ceiling fan\u2019s low democracy and sang two songs that left no room for argument. The first was bright and full of the kind of joy people sometimes do not trust unless there is a cake nearby. The second she began with a sentence about railings and restraint and then sang, plain and narrow, a version of Barbara Allen without a body, which made the refrain lift like a halo someone had decided to place on a living head. She did the line about light because it had moved into her house and was paying rent.\n\nThe applause was the softer kind, the type that people do when they are grateful that something has been put into the room in a way that does not need to be decorated further. Darragh came up afterwards with the careful manner of a man navigating furniture and did not attempt an apology. He said, instead, that the river looked different at night and he had considered that obvious observations were part of how people stayed alive. Tabby, at Miriam\u2019s elbow because there are nights when you arrive in a pair, nodded without encouraging metaphors, and said, \u201cI will accept observed obviousness as a down payment,\u201d and then turned, motherly, to tell a teenager with a camera to stop filming strangers without asking. It was a small success, wrought from an evening that had been invited to consider improving itself.\n\nWhile this community drama arranged itself into a story that would keep, an academic drama queued politely. The public talk that the department had asked of her became more specific. It would be in a large lecture theatre with a slanting floor and a smell of late-night arguments and old chewing gum. It would be advertised with a photograph of Miriam that made her look like a person who ironed opinions. The title they suggested\u2014Old Songs, New Mouths\u2014made her wince and then accept because she did not have a better set of words that would please a designer and an administrator simultaneously without consulting a committee. She wrote the talk at the kitchen table, between visits to the care home and emails to Malcolm about the barn\u2019s temperament and messages from Miles that contained maps drawn by someone who believed perspective was a conspiracy. She listened to her own habit of cleverness and then removed half of it. She put back the part where you could sit quietly in a room and hum and be in history without suffering for it. She left space for two minutes of communal humming because she wanted to commit a small act of organized tenderness in a place that had seen too much being right and not enough being together.\n\nOn the day, the students front-loaded the chairs with their presence and their beanies and their quiet competitiveness. Cal sat in the middle with a posture that said he was not involved and a grin that said he was entirely complicit. Bex helped the ushers by telling people where to sit with the confidence of a person who had once directed traffic for an outdoor Shakespeare and discovered she liked telling strangers to go left. The Head of Department made introductory remarks that managed not to mention impact even once, which suggested either that he had learned or that someone had blackmailed him with a photograph of himself eating a sausage roll. Miriam began with the story she had told in the dark room at the television studio about her mother stirring soup; she did not use the phrase defiance until minute nine because she did not want people to think she was brandishing it like a sword. She spoke about mouths as vessels and hands as archives and about how the loop was not a trick but a confession that humans have always needed their own company made audible. When she asked the room to hum, the room hummed. It was shy at first, as if someone had asked it to remove a coat, and then bold, which is what happens when people remember that the person next to them is the same shape. She released them from humming with a small bow as if to say that rituals do not end you; they feed you and then let you leave with your coat and your keys.\n\nAfter, the questions were the kind you hope for because they make you more honest than you had intended to be. A boy with hair like earnestness asked whether songs can be stolen if they were never properly owned and she said yes and that the thief is sometimes hunger and sometimes love. A woman in a shirt with a crisp collar asked whether the loop was the opposite of forgetting and Miriam wanted to kiss her on the crown and instead said \u201cIt\u2019s a friend to memory,\u201d which a person with a pen wrote down as if it had caught something important that might otherwise run away. The archivist with eyebrows like quotation marks stood at the back and raised his hand only at the end to ask, with deadly politeness, whether she would care to translate ink into breath for their Christmas do, and she said yes because that party had terrible sausage rolls and she loved it anyway.\n\nThey did record at the barn, in the thinner light of the year when morning had to be coaxed with tea. Malcolm kept the heaters on a miser\u2019s setting and wore fingerless gloves like a man who felt compelled not to succumb to the clich\u00e9s of his trade and could not resist the comforts either. The second track they tried to catch contained their mother\u2019s voice, not stolen, not thrust into the room by a stage-managed grief, but layered politely under a refrain with her permission that had been given on a good afternoon when the word permission still sat easily in her mouth. The video from the care home, a twenty-second clip of a hand finding a rhythm on the arm of a chair and a voice dark with pears saying Daisy on the beat, gave them the phrase they needed. Miriam sat with her earphones on and thought carefully about where the ethics lived, then put the phrase in gently, a hinge rather than a door, and stepped back as if from a painting she had touched up without making a scene. Malcolm listened and did not move for a time that made her think of the few good weddings she had attended. \u201cThat\u2019s not grief porn,\u201d he said, finally, blunt like a blessing. \u201cThat\u2019s a receipt.\u201d The swallows\u2019 ghosts approved in the rafters, or else it was the weather finding a way to say useful things to wood. They did not attempt anything else that day because you ought not to paint over your own kindness.\n\nTabby was making herself into a person who could arrive with paper cups and leave having arranged a rota. She liked the care home in a way that made Miriam glad and frightened; people who are good at kindness are often mistaken for reservoirs. She learned what biscuits worked, and which songs were allowed after four and before two, and which carers liked a silly dance when the tea trolley was late, and which families needed to be told sharply to stop standing in the way of the breakfast parade. She came home with stories that made Miriam want to be braver for the rest of the day. \u201cThere\u2019s a woman called Annette who refuses to call anyone dear on the grounds that it is a species of deer and therefore unfair,\u201d she said once, peeling an orange as if she were auditioning for a ritual, \u201cand a man called Frank who has adopted the ficus and gets emotionally distressed if anyone dusts it, and they both believe firmly in your show and also in soup.\u201d\n\nDecember came with its truck of gestures and found them at the window trying to decide which ones to order. They said no to the Christmas special because Miriam could feel the exhaustion of performing seasonal cheer for a camera she did not love. They said yes to the library do where the archivist had promised fewer sausage rolls and more glass of something tart, and to the winter edition in the town hall where Miles had insisted she must be their church. The town hall had wreaths that looked as if someone had negotiated with holly directly, and a heating system that had read about warmth and made a start. In the foyer, a man in a bow tie had set up a table of zines that were politely radical, and a child with a paper crown was telling an aunt that angels and sheep can be the same if you believe hard enough. The stage smelled of dry, grateful wood. Miriam had resolved not to chase the feeling that had happened the last time, the one with the sense of a room lifting like a lung, because you cannot train a miracle beyond teaching yourself to notice and then not get in its way.\n\nShe sang the one from the barn and the room learned it as if it had been waiting. She did not announce the hinge. She did not bring attention to the receipt. She let the phrase pass through like a small, necessary wind. Tabby cried, but in the good way, the way that leaves you new, and afterwards she out-sprinted three aunts to the merchandise table to ask a volunteer who looked fifteen to tell anyone who asked that the small print had been achieved ethically, thank you. A woman with a face that had chosen all its wrinkles deliberately came up and said that she had kept her mother alive for twenty-three days with custard and a hymn, and Miriam said she believed in custard and in hymns in that order, and the woman breathed out like a person who had been held on a bus by a stranger for a stop.\n\nThe Night Stage did call again in a way that made the room colder and then warmer; Nadine asked with her best bedside manner if Miriam would write something for their last show of the year, not to perform necessarily, but to be put on the website as a black-and-white piece that could lean against a photograph of someone more glittery and get used in a newsletter where adjectives went to take off their shoes. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be about us,\u201d Nadine said, perhaps lying, perhaps not, \u201cbut it would be nice if it was about why we bother at all when the world keeps making other noises.\u201d Miriam sat at her table that afternoon with a view of an ivy leaf that had decided on death with dignity and wrote a small essay in which she did not use the word defiance. She wrote about the body as drum and about how an old song is a cupboard people keep moving houses with, and about how the loop is a friend to the bit of you that forgets you exist unless you are heard. She sent it to Nadine and it came back with a subject line that read: you are rude to adjectives and I approve, and she laughed and kept the approval for putting under her tongue when a meeting threatened to eat her.\n\nThere was one more card. It arrived between gas bills in an envelope that had not made a decision about whether it wanted to be an envelope. It showed a photograph of a pedestrian crossing in a town that could have been any town with money for paint and a council that had written a letter to itself about courtesy. On the back were five words: Bring it home and share, with no signature and handwriting that belonged to someone who wrote on hard surfaces. It was a phrase from nowhere they could place. It was not one of their private childhood ropes. It did not wear their father\u2019s slant or their old doctor\u2019s carefuls. It fell into the house without making much noise and then started to shape the air around it as if it had always been meant to be there. Miriam stood with it in the hall and thought: perhaps this is how you know you\u2019re allowed to go on. Strangers begin to speak into your story and you do not mind because they are holding the words carefully and not dropping them into the sink.\n\nOn a late afternoon that had decided on fog like an aesthetic, their mother fell. It was not dramatic; it was what bodies do. A carer with daisies on her socks found her on the way to the dining room and made the right noises in the right order, which saved them the particular purgatory where you believe you might have done more if you had said a series of syllables in the correct key. The call came with the calm that professionals put on like a scarf and Miriam did the automatic things\u2014bag, phone, cardigan\u2014while Tabby produced, without announcing it, the small plastic box that contained the relevant paperwork and a pen that worked. At A&E the air was unambitious. People were managing to be alive together in the way humans do when they have no choice. Their mother\u2019s face looked like itself redesigned by a student who had been given limited time, but her eyes had the same ability they had always had to be both ordinary and unbearable.\n\nThe doctor was a different one this time, a woman with fluorescents in her pupils and a politeness that was not a pose. She explained about a small fracture and a night for observation and that they would do the thing with the pain relief while keeping an eye on the breath. She said the words you learn to love because they do not panic you and do not ignore you either. Tabby, who had been concealing her fear under useful jokes, stopped and then started again. Miriam sat with their mother and hummed\u2014because there are songs you sing in public and songs you do not, but humming is an acceptable sin\u2014while the machines did their rehearsed ballet. At one point their mother woke with a little, surprised \u201cOh,\u201d as if she had been offered a second pudding, and looked from Miriam to Tabby with a ferocious specificity that had been absent for a while. \u201cLight,\u201d she said, and then, after a pause in which her eyes did a mathematical operation, \u201cWhere?\u201d It could have been an accusation. It sounded like a game. She raised a hand and Miriam put her fingers under it and said, \u201cWe kept some,\u201d and Tabby, ridiculous, beautiful, infuriating, reached into her bag and produced the torch and clicked it on and off like a pantomime god. Their mother laughed, with her old cough of a laugh, and the machine supervising her heart took it as acceptable and did not object.\n\nThey stayed until staying was no longer useful and then they left in layers, because that is how you remove yourself from a place that has decided to keep the people you love overnight. Eileen had left a note that said SHE IS IN OUR POCKET in large block letters that were at war with grammar and on the hob, stubbornly doing its own timing, a stew made the long way. They ate and did not talk much about the part where the future had been mentioned by a machine. They were becoming good at not forcing a narrative to declare itself before it was ready. When it was time to sleep, Miriam went to her desk and wrote Bring it home and share on a small piece of paper and put it in the drawer with the pens and the tapes, not to hide it but to let it be among tools. She lay down and found the bus of sleep patient again, and when it came it took her to a small field where nothing was expected of her except to remember the right way to place her feet and to breathe when the path narrowed.\n\nIn the new year\u2014the administrative one, the poor unloved little January that has to arrive and bring the bins in and cancel things\u2014the town did its unreasonably noble task of carrying on. The gig in the post office that Nadine had conjured was a benevolent chaos of lights and emotions. The winter hall shared its breath with mist. The care home added crossword hour to the roster because Tabby had lobbied and someone had agreed that a full life requires a pencil and an eraser. The department sent her timetable, apologizing for putting her in Room 3.17 which had a heating system that preferred to sculpt fog rather than dispel it. Malcolm sent mixes with names like december_barn2_final and final_final_really_this_one, and a link to a small radio program where a woman with a voice like a dry brush had played three songs and said out loud that breath can be taught, which made Miriam feel like a person who had been correct without having had to argue.\n\nThere was a moment, one morning when the frost had made the green stay politely still, when Miriam unlocked her office and found on her chair a brown paper parcel tied with string like a proposition. Inside was a book, not new, a collection of ballads with a spine that had learned to bow, and inside the first page a note that read: For the professor who keeps songs honest. From a former cynic in Row F. She tried to work out from the handwriting who Row F had been and decided that preserving the mystery might be a better gift than solving it. She put the book next to the poster of Daphne Oram so they could discuss systems after dark and left a chocolate on her own desk for a future in which she might forget to buy herself anything.\n\nThe first room of the new year\u2014her room, the room she had asked for\u2014was in a little theater above a pub in a city that liked to refer to itself as significant and occasionally deserved it. The stairs were unfriendly at the turn and the backstage had borrowed someone\u2019s kettle without their consent. The chairs were comfortable in the way of chairs that have conspired with performers to keep people from leaving. She had asked that the lights be kind and that the sound be honest and the engineer, a woman with short hair and a cardigan that had outlived heartbreak, gave her both. She sang for ninety minutes after a sensible glass of water and a minute\u2019s quiet that nobody minded because the room had learned from churches how to be dignified without pretending to be older than it was. She made the loop hum like a radiator. She told two stories about their mother and one about the detective and one about the barn and one about the man with the fox socks because there is no point in pretending that our small icons do not give us gravity. When she sang the line that could have become a brand if she had been careless, she spoke it like a promise instead and looked out at her own idea of a country: students and pensioners and men who had been told they were too sensitive for ochres, women who had made soup for their neighbors, young people doing the facial expression that helps them listen differently, a detective in civvies with a woo saved for the end.\n\nShe brought it home and shared, in the practical ways that phrase demanded. She sent Malcolm an email that used the word grateful twice and did not delete one of them. She posted the dates on a website that no one had evaluated for elegance but which contained the correct information typed with the correct spelling. She sent Miles a list of adjectives that she would allow on a poster and trusted her to add one she had not anticipated. She called their mother every morning regardless of whether it would be her who answered, and sang as if the air between was not a cost. She made sure her students had an essay question that allowed them to say \u201cI\u201d in a way that did not get them marked down for being alive. She reminded Cal that he had promised to let her bully the choir into trying a nonsense canon and he reminded her that he had not agreed to be bullied but would permit persuasion. She bought herself a new pen that felt like a tool rather than a flourish.\n\nOn a Tuesday that initially resembled no one\u2019s idea of a chapter opening, a letter came from a man with a surname that belonged to their past. It was not their father. It was the vicar from the village they had lived in between the ages of eight and twelve, a man now in his eighties who had once preached sermons that had made their mother come home and declare that organized religion might be rescued by a handful of people who refused to be pompous. He wrote that he had found a cassette in a drawer labelled Blake girls, summer f\u00eate, and thought they might like the sound of themselves badly recorded, that the village had become posher and less kind and his wife had taken to playing the organ with a kind of malice he admired. He had copied the cassette onto a small awkward USB because his nephew had told him he must modernize or be eaten by the decades, and he hoped they would forgive hiss and the lack of tact. In the evening, they plugged it into Cal\u2019s laptop because he possessed an adaptor like a wizard and listened to two small voices misbehave in front of a trestle table, one trying to sing Wild Mountain Thyme and the other attempting to harmonize by finding a third that existed only in a nearby country. Between the notes was the removal truck of their father pulling away, and their mother baking something with a determined optimism, and the vicar\u2019s wife laughing in a way Miriam remembered from behind a curtain. They listened as if someone had threaded light across thirty years and asked it to keep itself from fraying. When it ended, Tabby wiped her nose with the back of her hand with deliberate inelegance and said, \u201cWe were all arms,\u201d and Miriam said, \u201cWe remain all arms, which is lucky because there is much to carry,\u201d and nobody reached for an extra meaning; they had enough.\n\nIn the thick of it, television turned up in her life again like a guest who might be forgiven for arriving unannounced because they had once washed up. A researcher with the wariness of someone who had been shouted at by a publicist called to ask if she would appear for five minutes on a show where clever people are allowed to be nice. She said yes because five minutes is an amount of time that can support temperance, and turned up in a cardigan that had chosen not to fuss and said her lines about old songs and new mouths and let a comedian call her loop \u201ca pleasing form of legal witchcraft.\u201d The clip went wherever clips go and returned with more than the usual number of messages from people who did not want anything except to say that their grandmother had sung to them during blackouts and they were thinking of buying a kettle with a proper whistle. She wrote back to more of them than was practical because it was an honest form of debt repayment, and put three of the stories in a file titled LIGHT to be kept for the day she felt like a crow needing a reason to bring something shiny home.\n\nThey did the thing that winter asks: they threw a party that was small on purpose. Eileen brought potato salad she had bullied into sophistication and Mr Hughes from number eleven arrived bearing crisps and a confession that he had once been caught dancing by a mirror and regretted nothing. Vee came on the train with a spine that had seen things and a cake that looked innocent and was not, and Owen turned up with the dog who had saved them by being out in the world doing dog work, and Detective Ellison arrived late and blamed traffic and then rioted internally when Tabby placed sheaves of paper in his hand and told him to run charades with conviction. They sang badly and well without assignment. At one point, as happens in houses that have made a reputation for being hospitable to the right kind of noise, people found themselves humming the same thing while looking at different walls as if consulting a manual. Miriam looked around and thought, uncomplicatedly, that this was the room she had asked for, and she had it, and that there were other rooms and other nights where it would not work and she could continue anyway.\n\nWhen the party ended and the house had done the sigh that meant it would keep the stories safe until morning, Miriam stood in the hall where the postcards lived and touched the edges of the frames only because a person can put a hand on a thing without summoning ghosts. Light where you left it. Bring it home and share. She had not engineered them, and yet they kept arriving, as if the world liked being fed and would return the bowl in the morning. She went upstairs and checked that Tabby\u2019s breathing was in the legal range that indicated non-disaster and checked her own emails for a message that might take the last hope out of a week and found none. She sent Nadine a photograph from the party of Eileen telling off a sausage roll for breaking in the oven and wrote, I think we may have discovered impact, and Nadine replied with a photograph of her cat sitting on a stack of scripts and the message: this is my audience and they are a tough room. The bus arrived again. The night did the decent thing. The next chapter was not obliged to be dramatic. It was obliged merely to turn up when called, and, so far, that had been enough.",
