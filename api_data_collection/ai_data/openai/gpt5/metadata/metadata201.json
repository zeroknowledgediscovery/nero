     "novel_text": "Anchorage wore the midnight sun like a tilted halo, and the pixies wore Anchorage like a song stitched into their coats. They lived under deck planks and birch bark, in the hollows of old moose bones and the secret rafter spaces of antique shops where the owner swore things went missing as if by sighing. They took their tea with spruce tips and rainwater. They refused to be discovered except by those who already believed.\n\nTavi was very good at being small and being loud about it. He was small the way a snowflake is complicated. He was loud the way auroras are quiet. He trusted his hands, and he trusted the rules that got folded into him on his first winter: what you take is a conversation, never a theft; what you return should be better than it left; and when the wind says duck, you duck and ask later.\n\nHe had a spot behind the big seafood place on E Street where the ferns made a kind of low cathedral and the dumpsters leaked stories. He liked to sit on an old sardine tin and watch human ankles and the black warbling of ravens and make magic for the sheer muscle-memory joy of it. He\u2019d learned to coax a thread of fog from a warm cup of coffee, to shake frost patterns into lace that could hold a weight ten times his own, to persuade moths to carry a word from one alley to the next. Magic was mostly persuading, he\u2019d decided. The world preferred to be what it was; magic asked it to be something else for a moment, like a good joke that didn\u2019t hurt anyone.\n\nThat morning the air felt like a clean blade, cool and sharp and absolutely indifferent. The tide was out, exposing ankles of mud along Knik Arm. Tavi slipped his hand into the cold and pinched. The water listened to him because he never lied to it. A filament of wave rose up, looped around his wrist as if it were a bracelet made of breath. He cupped his other palm beneath it, and the thread stooped into a bead, heavier and heavier, until it was impossible and he had to laugh at himself. He let it go and it sizzled back into the estuary, none the worse for being taught a trick.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to teach the whole arm to bite,\u201d Oona had scolded him once, and then hugged him anyway, her wings dusted with flour. Oona wasn\u2019t old for a pixie; pixies aged sideways, their faces widening with the accumulation of questions. Hers looked very wide, so wide you could see your own reflection fall right in.\n\nThat night was the Unfurling, a time when small communities made themselves temporary and bigger, when pinecones were passed around like bowls and everybody smelled of smoke and late-season blueberries. They would meet at the birch grove near Ship Creek where someone had threaded lanterns into the trunks years ago, and because the rules were not made for breaking, Tavi would arrive early, as he always did, to stretch the magic thin over the place until it hummed.\n\nHe put on his best vest, the one with the pockets that knew the weight of his familiar slate of slate, the one that had a crooked stitch near the left shoulder where he\u2019d stitched himself mid-spell in a moment of stray attention. The seam never quite lay right. He liked it that way. A reminder: you\u2019re a working creature, not a jewel.\n\nHe bundled a pocket full of clean snow from the shadow side of a fence and carried it like an egg. Snow is better kept if you speak to it. He did, whispering the names of the mountains back to it like passwords: Alpenglow, Denali (he knew what the humans argued about and tried not to), Susitna like a sleeping woman on her side. The snow quieted.\n\nBy the time he reached the grove the first ravens were already perched like commas. He set the snow into a crevice and mumbled a blessing over it, a bit of theater for himself, and then began to work.\n\nHe stretched a net of frost between the ferns and the birches, a veil of intricate geometries so delicate a careless breath could hole it. He whistled soft until the frost agreed it was strong. He pinned it with knots of moonlight. He was particularly good at moonlight. He could hold it long enough for a kiss to be exchanged, a promise to be made, a small lie to be unlearned. He braided the net around the lanterns so that when anyone walked through they would feel a tickle of cold and a sense of being held, gently and exactly.\n\n\u201cShowing off, my tiny friend?\u201d\n\nHe didn\u2019t jump at the voice, but only because he knew it too well. The voice was a laugh that had swallowed something it shouldn\u2019t have. Grin Sable came out of the low brush with twigs stuck in his shoulder spines and a grin (of course) that looked like he hadn\u2019t been born with it\u2014no, like he had borrowed it and bit down until it fit.\n\nGrin\u2019s hair looked like bedhead in a storm. His boots were polished with a sheen of fish oil. He had charm that ran ahead of him like a dog off-leash. He told jokes that slid into rooms like knives disguised as dessert forks.\n\n\u201cSomeone has to,\u201d Tavi said without looking up, as if the frost net would be offended by divided attention.\n\n\u201cDo I need to pretend your little curtain is necessary?\u201d Grin leaned in as if to appraise, as if his breath could be measured in inches and knives.\n\nTavi did look up at that, because the thing about Grin was that he could convince you to abandon your own plan if you didn\u2019t watch his mouth. He had great mouth. Words climbed out of it like ants\u2014sharp, efficient, unafraid of bitter.\n\n\u201cThis curtain,\u201d Tavi corrected, \u201ckeeps your humors in and your humor out.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh? And here I was,\u201d Grin spread his arms as if expecting his lines to be delivered by cloud, \u201cplanning to debut my newest material on frostbite and commitment.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Tavi said. He pinched the final knot until it glowed true.\n\nGrin clicked his tongue thoughtfully. \u201cRight. We mustn\u2019t alarm the elders by suggesting the toe-numbing grind of a long winter could be\u2026 used.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know what you think is funny,\u201d Tavi said, because it was not unkind to say true things. But sometimes true things come with splinters.\n\nGrin rocked back on his heels, slapped his own chest in mock-wound. \u201cAnd I know what you think is magic.\u201d He snapped his fingers as if calling a dog. His hand lit. And the flame told a joke across his knuckles\u2014the crudest kind, a sort of pantomime that made Tavi roll his eyes on reflex because if he took offense Grin would drink it like cream.\n\n\u201cStop,\u201d Tavi said, and the flame did because the air liked Tavi better.\n\nGrin sucked his teeth, annoyed, but not at the world. That was the secret scald under his comedies. Everyone assumed he went too far out of ignorance; they did not see the calculation in the grin. He didn\u2019t fumble. He aimed.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be there tonight,\u201d Tavi said, which wasn\u2019t a question.\n\n\u201cAnd miss Oona pretending she doesn\u2019t notice the elderberries fermenting themselves? Never. I have a new one about feasts where the main course is an apology.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Tavi said again. How many times in a life do you say don\u2019t until it becomes a kind of hello. \u201cSome jokes aren\u2019t yours.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re everybody\u2019s.\u201d Grin wrinkled his nose. \u201cIt\u2019s the weather, Tavi. If you don\u2019t laugh at the dead elk on the trail you\u2019ll laugh at nothing at all.\u201d\n\n\u201cI prefer my laughs not to have ribs.\u201d\n\nGrin\u2019s eyes slid sidelong. \u201cWhat about palaces?\u201d\n\n\u201cPalaces don\u2019t have ribs.\u201d Tavi tried to keep the confusion out of his voice and failed. It came through like a draft.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t they?\u201d Grin asked, pleased with himself as if he had put a coin in an unseen slot and it had made a sound. \u201cI had a dream of a castle last night. Lush as a summer thrown indoors. Banners in silk. Walls like living stone. A in a place that knows your footprints no matter where you go. Imagine that. A big space that recognizes you.\u201d\n\n\u201cA castle?\u201d Tavi wiped his fingers on his vest, leaving tiny streaks of frost that would look like glitter to someone who wanted to sell it. \u201cIn Anchorage?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy not.\u201d Grin shrugged. \u201cHumans build square houses and call them boxes; we build boxes and call them poems. It\u2019s a failure of ambition. You\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\nTavi returned to the net. \u201cI\u2019ll wear my ambition when the weather fits it, thanks.\u201d\n\nGrin smiled as if Tavi had said exactly what he needed said. He sketched a little bow without sincerity and drifted off, humming a song with uneven bars so that your step caught on it if you weren\u2019t careful.\n\nBy dusk the grove had filled with the particular buzz of a crowd right before something. Oona arrived with her arms full of bread that steamed and cracked like it had language. She was taller than most, the way a person is taller when they are used to looking after other people\u2019s lost hats. Her wings were crow-feather black and showed every smear of flour like winter constellations. She set the bread down and kissed Tavi\u2019s forehead without waiting for permission.\n\n\u201cLook at you,\u201d she said, and pinched his ear. \u201cStringing the world up like a winter sweater.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a net,\u201d Tavi said, but smiled because there are hills you die on and then there are hills where you let your aunt call your structural work a sweater.\n\nThey shared a lane of tea and let the last of the ravens settle. The big lantern was lit. The little ones followed, like children who had been told it was a game. The air felt good on the skin. A bit of cold rubs away falseness. Tavi watched his breath and made patterns with his fingers in it, not for show, not for anything but to loosen his wrists.\n\nThe Unfurling was one part ritual, one part gossip, and the rest improvisation. There would be singing. There would be memory-work, which is a particular kind of apology in this town. There would be the Lumen Bell, which had been carried in with a hush. The bell wasn\u2019t big; it sat in Oona\u2019s hands like a story that already knew its ending. It wasn\u2019t metal at all, of course, though the humans would have drawn a bell if you asked them to draw a bell. It was a bowl spun from thinned light and the pale membrane behind a moth\u2019s wing. If you rang it properly, the whole grove remembered who it was. It took a hand like Tavi\u2019s, small and earnest and practiced.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll ring,\u201d Oona said, because people like Oona know where they\u2019re pointing you long before you see it.\n\nHe nodded.\n\nSomeone started a drum with their palms. Someone else laughed and it went up like the first little rabbit from a hedge. Tavi\u2019s chest felt tight in the good way, the too-much-of-it way when you are too full to be exactly still. Magic wants to move. Magic like his pricks the skin and says now please.\n\nGrin arrived late and made sure everyone knew it, sliding through the frost curtain with a flinch like he was a hero surviving a gauntlet. He winked at Oona. He whispered something to a group of cousins that made them howl into their hands and then pretend they hadn\u2019t. He cleared his throat and the little mothers of the grove put their hands on their hips, preemptively.\n\n\u201cNot now,\u201d Oona murmured to him. He raised his hands as if to say what could I possibly do.\n\nTavi caught his eye. Grin flashed his teeth. The net over the grove thrummed, a plucked string, as if the air itself had blinked.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll do the first strand,\u201d Oona said to Tavi, and then, with her voice turned toward everybody: \u201cTonight we hold our reminders in our hands. Tonight we take inventory of the cold and decide what it costs and what it gives. The bell is empty until we say otherwise.\u201d\n\nShe held it up, and every head tilted. It looked like a puddle cupped. The lanterns reflected in it even before she touched it. She rested it in Tavi\u2019s hands. He felt the cheapness of his own skin. All at once he wanted to apologize to it. He held on.\n\n\u201cJust breathe,\u201d Oona said, not because he\u2019d forgotten but because it changes the way you stand when someone tells you to. He breathed.\n\nHe reached for the tone he knew was right, that forgiving hum the bell liked, and found it, and he coaxed it from the rim like peeling an orange without breaking the peel. It grew. The sound was a good listener. It held them without expecting anything. The frost net shivered as if remembering what it was meant for. Someone started to cry. A few someones. Tavi felt the way he always felt when it worked right: grateful and unimportant. The sound did not need him past the first invitation. It went from person to person, a polite guest, touching a shoulder, the back of a neck. It wrote the whole grove, briefly.\n\nThen someone laughed.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t the wrong slice of sound, exactly, but it was badly timed and it hung there. It wasn\u2019t a laugh of the overwhelmed; it was not a sob in a different dialect. It was a punch line badly placed.\n\nGrin stood near the bread and he\u2019d said something, easy, something with teeth. People close to him pressed their lips together as if trying to retie the moment. The bell faltered on the same beat the laughter landed.\n\nOona\u2019s eyes moved to Grin and away because you cannot take a swing at a ghost; you have to swing at the body that made it. She did not swing. She looked at Tavi and her mouth softened. \u201cBreathe,\u201d she repeated, and he did. He used the breath to coax the tone to deepen, to swallow the stray laughter like a river takes leaves without making them the point.\n\nThe bell filled the grove again. The lanterns burned with more fat. Someone took a deep inhalation like a fresh minted coin. The moment held.\n\nAfter, there was food and caffeine and the angry gossip that lubricates communities into doing anything but nothing. Tavi ate a fistful of smoked salmon his cousin had acquired in a way everyone agreed not to ask about. He kept half an eye on the bell, sitting to the side like a good bowl.\n\nGrin drifted near him without quite arriving. Tavi could feel the tug of him the way you feel weather in your friend\u2019s knees. Grin\u2019s jokes came like knives thrown toward the ceiling. They hit beams and quivered and dropped. Sometimes they stuck. Tonight his audience was good: indulgent, older. They shook their heads. They laughed in the wrong places because you have to keep a relationship with dangerous things or they stop warning you.\n\n\u201cI suppose you did that quite well,\u201d Grin said eventually, casual, leaning as if the tree belonged to him.\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Tavi said, and took the compliment like a spiny fish: savoring it while not swallowing any bones.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re making a legend out of you,\u201d Grin went on. \u201cLittle Tavi and the bell that drank moods.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t.\u201d Tavi smiled despite himself. \u201cI\u2019d rather be known for my soup.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat would you do with it?\u201d Grin tilted his head. \u201cWhat do you do with being known? I\u2019d build. Rooms. Layers. A whole house just to keep it.\u201d He inclined his forehead toward the bell. \u201cToo bad it doesn\u2019t tolerate your fingers for more than three minutes at a time. Might make a nice paperweight for a desk.\u201d\n\n\u201cPaperweight,\u201d Tavi repeated, amused and absolutely aware they were playing a game that the others did not hear. \u201cOn a desk in a castle.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere you are.\u201d Grin\u2019s eyes lit, truly. \u201cWe can have the same dream, Tavi. Don\u2019t act like yours are small. You perform like someone who knows the difference between a stage and a floor.\u201d\n\n\u201cStages are for people who want handclaps,\u201d Tavi said. \u201cFloors are for people who want dancing.\u201d\n\nOona had shushed a cluster of second cousins from eating all the jam with their hands when a child\u2019s cry split the soft.\n\n\u201cBell,\u201d the child said, and pointed.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t where they\u2019d left it.\n\nTavi\u2019s stomach dropped as if somebody had pulled the floorboards out from under him. It sat now on the stump near the edge of the grove, almost precisely where it had been but an inch and a half to the left. That leftness mattered. His whole body knew it. Oona\u2019s wings stiffened.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t,\u201d Tavi said, on reflex, on instinct, on fear, and Oona said, \u201cOf course you didn\u2019t.\u201d She had taught him not to pre-apologize to a room.\n\nGrin spread his hands as if to say how could I. In his palms, invisible near enough to everyone but not to Tavi, there was the powder of a spell that takes ownership off of things. The kind used to slip a key from a hook unnoticed, used to make someone believe a chair had always been where it now sat and not where it belonged.\n\nTavi\u2019s mouth went dry. He stepped forward slowly, as if approaching a skittish animal, as if the bell itself might bolt. The frost net above head rang like spun glass. He reached the stump, reached for the bowl. It looked exactly the same except for the way it wasn\u2019t congruent with where it had been. He set his hand to it. It was warm. The bell should not be warm unless it had just been rung. It had not been rung.\n\nHe looked up. Grin\u2019s face was innocent as a winter day. His smile had dialed down to polite.\n\n\u201cMagic likes to be touched,\u201d Grin observed to nobody in particular. \u201cYou cannot isolate the interesting parts and expect the rest to wait in the lobby.\u201d\n\nOona was beside Tavi now, one hand on his shoulder like reassurance, the other hovering near the bell without touching. Her eyes flicked to the powder on Grin\u2019s hands. You always think elders see nothing until they smell your breath for berries.\n\n\u201cFunny,\u201d she said. It sounded not at all like praise.\n\n\u201cI am,\u201d Grin agreed mildly. \u201cIt\u2019s an illness.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen stop coughing on our food,\u201d Oona said, which pulled a reluctant laugh from a few throats, turned the air. She leaned around Tavi and whispered something the bell could hear. The bowl cooled, very slightly. She nodded to Tavi, one little dip: we do not play into his timing. We have our own.\n\nThey proceeded. Memory-work resumed. People tied strands of aunts and brothers and old dogs into the low branches like cloth. Someone sang about the way the river dragged ice. The night grew. The small wrong thing sat on the stump like an extra guest whose name you couldn\u2019t quite place.\n\nBy the time they doused the last lantern Tavi\u2019s jaw hurt. He had not realized he\u2019d been clenching it. He helped Oona tuck the leftovers into their baskets. He threaded a safeguard around the bell that was small and mean as an insult; he almost felt bad for it.\n\nGrin lounged against a trunk observing this, not hiding his watching. \u201cYou look like a man who\u2019s just discovered a stain on his favorite shirt,\u201d he mused. \u201cThe one you wear when you walk past windows and pretend you\u2019re taller than you are.\u201d\n\n\u201cGo home, Grin,\u201d Oona said. \u201cDo not entertain mischief tonight; it will take you up on it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI live where the mischief sleeps,\u201d Grin replied. \u201cWe share a pillow.\u201d He swung his feet like a boy on a dock.\n\nWhen the grove thinned to the final few and the night swole with the comfortable silence of after, Tavi and Oona carried the bell together, each with one hand on the bottom for balance, into the trunk where its nest was. Oona had gauge marks on her palm from other nights, other places. She set it down with the grace of someone who knows grace is just practice that remembers.\n\n\u201cI think he moved it,\u201d Tavi said, quiet enough that it was a thought spoken aloud.\n\n\u201cI think he wanted you to think he did,\u201d Oona said, and tapped the bell twice, as if listening for cavities. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s the same thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf he can reach it with a joke, what can he reach with a plan?\u201d\n\nOona blew out a breath through her nose. \u201cYou cannot police his mouth, Tavi. Only your reaction.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d he said, but he didn\u2019t. Not in the practical sense. He wanted to rub the thought out like a chalk mark.\n\n\u201cHe has the talent\u2014they laugh, he rearranges them. Dangerous if you are not careful. Which is why we watch him together.\u201d\n\nTavi glanced at the seam in his vest. He fussed with it. \u201cHe talked about a castle today.\u201d\n\nOona barked a little laugh. \u201cHe would.\u201d She eyed the curve of the bell as if it were a future you could bowl. \u201cPalaces breed restlessness. They think of walls as appetites.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe believes he deserves one,\u201d Tavi said. He tasted the truth of that and the bitterness too.\n\n\u201cWould you like a castle?\u201d Oona asked, a little sideways, a little testing for the pitch of the question.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Tavi said, quick and then slower: \u201cI want walls that are whom I\u2019ve worked with. A stove that knows my hands. A window that forgives unwashed cups by morning.\u201d\n\nOona kissed the top of his head. \u201cYou\u2019ll do fine if you hold on to that. The trouble with Grin is not that he wants a big room. It\u2019s that he wants the room to be someone he can win.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat if he can?\u201d Tavi asked, and Oona said, not soothing, not a lullaby, \u201cThen we have work to do.\u201d\n\nOn the way back to his spot behind the restaurant, the sky decided to be three new kinds of blue. The buildings mumbled to each other like old men on benches. Tavi walked the edges of human light and the steepness of pixie dark. He stood to watch the neon bear of a tourist shop turn its head, as if even signs got to stretch when nobody looked. He felt the bell at the back of his heart like a coin under the tongue. The wrongness of the shift would not leave.\n\nHe ducked into the alley. His sardine-tin chair sat right where he\u2019d left it, bless a small world. He set his hand on it anyway because things behave better when spoken to, and he said thank you. He sat. He made the mistake of letting the night settle without giving it a chore. It came and sat on his chest like a cat.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re ridiculous,\u201d he told himself aloud, and that helped. He pulled a piece of string from his pocket and made a figure out of it, a fox if you were generous. He let his fingertips spark and did not do anything but feel the flit of current between skin and air. Cool. Warm. Electric. He played with it until it bored him.\n\n\u201cStop that,\u201d a voice said. \u201cYou\u2019ll burn your fingerprints off.\u201d\n\nTavi did jump then, because he hadn\u2019t heard the approach. Grin slid into the alley like he belonged to all places that had space for a person the width of a wish. His grin was tired now. The jokes had drained him like tapping a maple. He leaned against a stack of crates that had seen everything and kept counsel anyway.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t sneak,\u201d Tavi said, not a command so much as a plea.\n\n\u201cWhat, and miss the romance of startling someone? You should thank me. Keeps your heart young.\u201d Grin pulled a small paper bag from his coat and shook it in Tavi\u2019s direction. \u201cA peace offering. Not that we are at war. Yet.\u201d\n\nTavi took it cautiously. Inside were candied spruce tips. He couldn\u2019t stop the little happiness in his chest; his mouth watered on reflex. He ate one and pretended not to make a noise of satisfaction.\n\n\u201cSee?\u201d Grin said softly. \u201cYou only wanted sugar.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d Tavi asked, because he\u2019d learned that with Grin you circle a long time if you don\u2019t pin the tail on the goat.\n\nGrin looked up at the slice of sky. He made a face. Not disgust. Not delight. Something with a flavor of hunger. \u201cI want a room where my laughter isn\u2019t an accident,\u201d he said. \u201cYou want control over your bell; I want control over my punch lines. Same thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cControl is different from harm,\u201d Tavi said.\n\n\u201cAnd intent is different from result,\u201d Grin replied. \u201cYou can say you wanted to make everyone feel included and still make someone small.\u201d He squinted at Tavi. \u201cYou know that, don\u2019t you? With your nets and your neatness.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe I do,\u201d Tavi admitted. He could feel the seams of his certainty. It was not an apology. \u201cPlease don\u2019t touch the bell again.\u201d\n\nGrin tilted his head. \u201cPlease don\u2019t tell me not to do something. It makes my spine itchy.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll scratch it for you with a fork,\u201d Tavi said, which startled a laugh out of both of them. They sat in that mutual noise without knowing they\u2019d wanted it.\n\nGrin sobered. \u201cI didn\u2019t push it much. It wanted to move a little. I helped.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Tavi said a third time, because third times in a night make a pattern. \u201cYou don\u2019t get to decide what wants.\u201d\n\nGrin grew quiet in a way he rarely was. \u201cEverything wants something, Tavi. Stones want to rest. Water wants the downward. Words want mouths. My mouth wants air and the shape of a room. If the room isn\u2019t the right shape I make it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t keep doing it in ours.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou think this grove is yours? What, because you made a net out of weather?\u201d His tone sharpened, not because he wished to wound but because it was his instrument. \u201cIf I am cruel\u2014and I don\u2019t accept that I am always\u2014be crueler. Stop me. Tell me no in a way that doesn\u2019t turn into wallpaper.\u201d\n\nTavi rubbed his eyes, weariness settling behind his ears like cold. \u201cI did.\u201d\n\nGrin nodded, as if that had been a portion of a cake he wanted anyway. He stepped away from the crates like he hadn\u2019t left any imprint. He tucked his hands into his pockets and the powder of the unsubtle spell dusted down into his seams, as if he were always wearing mischief.\n\nHe paused. \u201cI dream of a place with a ceiling so high we think there isn\u2019t one,\u201d he said, soft, almost for himself. \u201cWhere you can take a running start on a joke and not hit someone\u2019s grief. Where laughter can be its own person and not a weapon and not a shield. And the floor would be moss with a sensible sense of humor. And the bathwater would be warm, forever.\u201d\n\nTavi wanted to tell him that those places did not exist; he also wanted to build one for him. He ate another spruce tip because sweetness helps with unsayable things. \u201cAnchorage isn\u2019t going to give you a castle,\u201d he said, mild.\n\n\u201cThen I will take one from somewhere else,\u201d Grin said, and smiled with his eyes closed. \u201cOr else I will grow it like a tooth.\u201d\n\nWhen he left he left the alley a little bigger than it had been. It was a trick of the eyes. It was also a promise. Tavi sat with it until the cold convinced him to his feet. He went home and lay on his belly under the boards and listened to the ship horns and the cars that never learned and the crows\u2019 gossip. He told the dark: I will not let him make us sad. Which is not a vow you can keep. He slept badly.\n\nIn the morning Oona came to his spot with a tin of lemon cookies that were either too tart or too sweet depending on how much you didn\u2019t want them. She carried a small, flat bundle wrapped in oilcloth.\n\n\u201cBefore you say anything,\u201d she said, \u201cI have something for you and yes you will think it is too much and yes you will take it anyway.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t sustain this level of ferocity before coffee,\u201d Tavi said, but he took the tin and the bundle. He peeled back the cloth. Inside lay a map. Not drawn in ink. Scrimshawed, it would be called if it were bone, which it wasn\u2019t. The lines had been stitched into the fabric, the thread dyed with the juice of boiled moss. It showed the city the way a fox sees it. The warm pipes. The ways under doors. The good drains. The places where the ground hums.\n\n\u201cIt shows desire lines,\u201d Oona said. \u201cWhere a person thinks they\u2019re going, not where they say. We made it last winter when the pipes froze wrong. Consider it\u2026 insurance. For if you need to find someone who is going where they don\u2019t want people to think they are going. Or if you just want a better walk.\u201d\n\n\u201cOona,\u201d Tavi said, because her name itself tuned his ribcage. \u201cThank you.\u201d\n\nShe waved it off. \u201cIt\u2019s an old trick. But the thread is new. Careful of the edges. It\u2019ll bite you if you think it\u2019s an ordinary thing.\u201d\n\nTavi traced a line that shivered under his finger like it desired to leave. \u201cYou think I should follow him.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think curiosity is a muscle we should feed. And we should not let generosity pretend it is naive.\u201d Oona\u2019s face went mean and dear at once, a trick very few could pull. \u201cI also think if he decides to build this castle he\u2019s going to need more than words. He\u2019ll go looking for the Lumen again. Or something like it. He wants to make walls out of attention. You\u2019re the attention he wants to break.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t want to break me,\u201d Tavi said. He believed it while he said it. It wobbled like a chord held past its natural end.\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t know what he wants,\u201d Oona said. \u201cThat\u2019s the dangerous bit.\u201d\n\nThey ate lemon cookies. They drank coffee blooming with a splash of something you could call cream if you didn\u2019t own a dictionary. The day wore its winter half-mask with pride. They spread the map and watched the lines settle as if the city were a cat finding comfort.\n\nGrin\u2019s line\u2014if that is what it was\u2014ran broken through the neighborhoods that thought they were safe from pixies and turned abruptly toward the water and then reluctantly toward the hills. It had a stutter in it, a hesitance, a laugh he had told that bruised him back. Tavi put his finger on the end. The line nipped him. He did not pull away.\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d he said. \u201cOkay.\u201d\n\nThe day took on a purpose that had nothing to do with lanterns. Tavi packed his vest and patched his seam with a dark thread that would show. He told Oona where he would be. He told three friends so the telling had weight. He left breadcrumbs in the old fish way\u2014actual crumbs of biscuits the mice liked and messages for the wind. He took the map and the bell\u2019s distant echo into his pocket and set out.\n\nAnchorage widened. He had not realized how many of the good old paths had gotten dull underfoot. He walked them and watched them brighten. He cut across the parking lot of a shuttered store that had turned into a church and back into a store again. He ducked into a culvert and emerged smelling like a rumor.\n\nHe found signs of Grin the way you find handwriting in the air if you think a person has just spoken: a hangover of laughter, a prickle at the back of the neck, a joke that had been told two streets over and didn\u2019t deserve to walk this far. He followed the hunger of it. It led where Oona had guessed\u2014toward the water and then inland where the spruce did things with the light that made you believe in old gods again.\n\nBy the time he reached the first climb of the foothills, his ribs felt like an accordion and his heart like a stubborn drummer. He didn\u2019t stop because he didn\u2019t know what he\u2019d do if he did. He kept the map in his pocket where it warmed the side of his thigh with an insistent mind of its own.\n\nHe found Grin two hours into the walk, as if the city had slowed him, as if his jokes were heavy in his pockets. Grin stood in a small clearing where the snow still believed nobody had noticed it, scratching a shape into the dirt with a stick. It was a circle, of course, because people love circles. He looked up without surprise when Tavi arrived, as if this was the sort of coincidence you could build a religion on.\n\n\u201cYou brought your conscience,\u201d Grin said, nodding at the bulge where the map sat. \u201cAnd your sense of direction. Smart.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou brought a magic circle into the woods,\u201d Tavi said, equally obvious.\n\n\u201cIt is foolish to build a castle without marking where the wind thinks the corners should be,\u201d Grin replied, and gestured at the circle. \u201cCome in then. Take my measure. Tell me I am wrong. Do whatever you need to do so you can sleep with your mean cat.\u201d\n\nTavi stepped up to the circle and did not cross it. \u201cIf you bring the bell out here I will carry you home by your ears.\u201d\n\n\u201cHard to carry a creature taller than you,\u201d Grin said, but his eyes flicked, briefly, to Tavi\u2019s hands. \u201cI know your strength.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you know your own?\u201d Tavi asked.\n\nGrin laughed. \u201cNo. Not yet. That\u2019s the point.\u201d He tapped the circle. \u201cYou think I like being the man at the edge of the room making everyone look at me to prove I am there? I want walls that look back.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd beyond them?\u201d Tavi asked, because sometimes you can only find a person by asking them what succeeds their cathedrals.\n\n\u201cA garden,\u201d Grin said, and Tavi believed him. \u201cSomething that keeps growing if the jokes go bad.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou tell inappropriate jokes,\u201d Tavi said, blunt because the trees liked it that way. \u201cSometimes cruel ones.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Grin said. He looked tired again. \u201cIt\u2019s the only time the room seems to pay attention to the true edge of things. Or maybe it\u2019s just that I don\u2019t know how to do it different and not vanish.\u201d\n\n\u201cTry entertaining kindness,\u201d Tavi said softly. \u201cIt\u2019s got better material. Harder timing. You\u2019ve got the hands for hard timing.\u201d\n\nGrin\u2019s jaw worked. He stepped into his own circle and stood like a penitent and like a king. \u201cHelp me build it then,\u201d he said, naked in a way that made Tavi want to cover him with both hands and a coat. \u201cBecause if I build it alone I will build something you cannot live with.\u201d\n\nTavi stared at him. He remembered the powder on Grin\u2019s hands. He remembered the warm bell. He remembered the spruce tips. He remembered the way Grin\u2019s laugh had buckled under itself when it fell into a wrong place. He wanted to say yes the way we want to say yes standing at a cliff face while the wind says jump. He wanted to say no in a way that he wouldn\u2019t regret when he was older and had his own apprentice, gods help him.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll help you,\u201d he said, and it unlaced something in Grin\u2019s shoulders. \u201cBut\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Grin said, rolling his eyes skyward, mocking the gods. \u201cThere\u2019s always a but.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut,\u201d Tavi went on, \u201cyou do not touch the bell. You do not test the room with a knife. You do not force laughter. You build quiet things first. Walls that do not make you feel bigger than you are or smaller than you\u2019re afraid. And if you bring a joke into my kitchen I will salt it until it can\u2019t hurt anyone.\u201d\n\nGrin smiled with a gentleness that did not sit easy on him and made him beautiful. \u201cYou\u2019re very controlling.\u201d\n\n\u201cI told you,\u201d Tavi said simply. \u201cI\u2019m good at magic.\u201d\n\nGrin nodded, made a tiny bow that contained more sincerity than any other he\u2019d given. \u201cLet\u2019s begin with a wall then. A small one. A practice rib.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou said walls had ribs,\u201d Tavi recalled.\n\n\u201cThey do now,\u201d Grin said. They crouched together at the circle\u2019s boundary and started to argue about corners in the language of small stones. The forest watched. The wind took notes. The first part of a castle is always a rumor.\n\nBy the time their hands were raw and their bellies had forgotten why they had been invented, a low line of earth lay where there had been none, dusted lightly with frost that did not dare melt. It was nothing. It was a song that had lost its words. Grin sat back on his heels and looked like what he wanted would kill him and he was letting it.\n\n\u201cAgain tomorrow,\u201d Tavi said, because that is how you make anything stay.\n\nGrin nodded. He reached out like he might touch Tavi\u2019s shoulder and thought better of it. \u201cOkay,\u201d he said, and almost the tiniest voice.\n\nThey walked back down together, not quite touching, like magnets with a paper between them. When they parted at the edge of the grove, Grin made a face like he had swallowed less than he had hoped to. He shook himself. \u201cI\u2019m going to tell a joke,\u201d he warned.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Tavi said, smiling for the first time at the ritual of it.\n\nGrin told it anyway, but softly, so nobody could be hurt by it, and it was not vulgar, not tonight; it was about a chair that learned to dance when nobody was home. Tavi laughed not because it was funny but because all furniture should get a chance. The frost net above them hummed in approval. The bell, nested in its quiet trunk like a heart inside a ribcage, listened.\n\nAnchorage sleeping was a good place to be a pixie if you liked to find things you hadn\u2019t known you were missing. Tavi fell asleep with dirt under his nails and a map under his pillow. In his dream a wall rose where there had been air, and it smelled like spruce and lemon cookies and the edge of a joke that might finally be kind. He woke with the certain knowledge that nothing that important ever held still, and that Grin had already found a way to cheat at corners.\n\nHe sighed. He put the kettle on. He tied his hair back. And when Oona came round he looked her in the eye, as if the day had been expecting it, and told her everything.",

                              "content": "Anchorage wore the midnight sun like a tilted halo, and the pixies wore Anchorage like a song stitched into their coats. They lived under deck planks and birch bark, in the hollows of old moose bones and the secret rafter spaces of antique shops where the owner swore things went missing as if by sighing. They took their tea with spruce tips and rainwater. They refused to be discovered except by those who already believed.\n\nTavi was very good at being small and being loud about it. He was small the way a snowflake is complicated. He was loud the way auroras are quiet. He trusted his hands, and he trusted the rules that got folded into him on his first winter: what you take is a conversation, never a theft; what you return should be better than it left; and when the wind says duck, you duck and ask later.\n\nHe had a spot behind the big seafood place on E Street where the ferns made a kind of low cathedral and the dumpsters leaked stories. He liked to sit on an old sardine tin and watch human ankles and the black warbling of ravens and make magic for the sheer muscle-memory joy of it. He\u2019d learned to coax a thread of fog from a warm cup of coffee, to shake frost patterns into lace that could hold a weight ten times his own, to persuade moths to carry a word from one alley to the next. Magic was mostly persuading, he\u2019d decided. The world preferred to be what it was; magic asked it to be something else for a moment, like a good joke that didn\u2019t hurt anyone.\n\nThat morning the air felt like a clean blade, cool and sharp and absolutely indifferent. The tide was out, exposing ankles of mud along Knik Arm. Tavi slipped his hand into the cold and pinched. The water listened to him because he never lied to it. A filament of wave rose up, looped around his wrist as if it were a bracelet made of breath. He cupped his other palm beneath it, and the thread stooped into a bead, heavier and heavier, until it was impossible and he had to laugh at himself. He let it go and it sizzled back into the estuary, none the worse for being taught a trick.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to teach the whole arm to bite,\u201d Oona had scolded him once, and then hugged him anyway, her wings dusted with flour. Oona wasn\u2019t old for a pixie; pixies aged sideways, their faces widening with the accumulation of questions. Hers looked very wide, so wide you could see your own reflection fall right in.\n\nThat night was the Unfurling, a time when small communities made themselves temporary and bigger, when pinecones were passed around like bowls and everybody smelled of smoke and late-season blueberries. They would meet at the birch grove near Ship Creek where someone had threaded lanterns into the trunks years ago, and because the rules were not made for breaking, Tavi would arrive early, as he always did, to stretch the magic thin over the place until it hummed.\n\nHe put on his best vest, the one with the pockets that knew the weight of his familiar slate of slate, the one that had a crooked stitch near the left shoulder where he\u2019d stitched himself mid-spell in a moment of stray attention. The seam never quite lay right. He liked it that way. A reminder: you\u2019re a working creature, not a jewel.\n\nHe bundled a pocket full of clean snow from the shadow side of a fence and carried it like an egg. Snow is better kept if you speak to it. He did, whispering the names of the mountains back to it like passwords: Alpenglow, Denali (he knew what the humans argued about and tried not to), Susitna like a sleeping woman on her side. The snow quieted.\n\nBy the time he reached the grove the first ravens were already perched like commas. He set the snow into a crevice and mumbled a blessing over it, a bit of theater for himself, and then began to work.\n\nHe stretched a net of frost between the ferns and the birches, a veil of intricate geometries so delicate a careless breath could hole it. He whistled soft until the frost agreed it was strong. He pinned it with knots of moonlight. He was particularly good at moonlight. He could hold it long enough for a kiss to be exchanged, a promise to be made, a small lie to be unlearned. He braided the net around the lanterns so that when anyone walked through they would feel a tickle of cold and a sense of being held, gently and exactly.\n\n\u201cShowing off, my tiny friend?\u201d\n\nHe didn\u2019t jump at the voice, but only because he knew it too well. The voice was a laugh that had swallowed something it shouldn\u2019t have. Grin Sable came out of the low brush with twigs stuck in his shoulder spines and a grin (of course) that looked like he hadn\u2019t been born with it\u2014no, like he had borrowed it and bit down until it fit.\n\nGrin\u2019s hair looked like bedhead in a storm. His boots were polished with a sheen of fish oil. He had charm that ran ahead of him like a dog off-leash. He told jokes that slid into rooms like knives disguised as dessert forks.\n\n\u201cSomeone has to,\u201d Tavi said without looking up, as if the frost net would be offended by divided attention.\n\n\u201cDo I need to pretend your little curtain is necessary?\u201d Grin leaned in as if to appraise, as if his breath could be measured in inches and knives.\n\nTavi did look up at that, because the thing about Grin was that he could convince you to abandon your own plan if you didn\u2019t watch his mouth. He had great mouth. Words climbed out of it like ants\u2014sharp, efficient, unafraid of bitter.\n\n\u201cThis curtain,\u201d Tavi corrected, \u201ckeeps your humors in and your humor out.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh? And here I was,\u201d Grin spread his arms as if expecting his lines to be delivered by cloud, \u201cplanning to debut my newest material on frostbite and commitment.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Tavi said. He pinched the final knot until it glowed true.\n\nGrin clicked his tongue thoughtfully. \u201cRight. We mustn\u2019t alarm the elders by suggesting the toe-numbing grind of a long winter could be\u2026 used.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know what you think is funny,\u201d Tavi said, because it was not unkind to say true things. But sometimes true things come with splinters.\n\nGrin rocked back on his heels, slapped his own chest in mock-wound. \u201cAnd I know what you think is magic.\u201d He snapped his fingers as if calling a dog. His hand lit. And the flame told a joke across his knuckles\u2014the crudest kind, a sort of pantomime that made Tavi roll his eyes on reflex because if he took offense Grin would drink it like cream.\n\n\u201cStop,\u201d Tavi said, and the flame did because the air liked Tavi better.\n\nGrin sucked his teeth, annoyed, but not at the world. That was the secret scald under his comedies. Everyone assumed he went too far out of ignorance; they did not see the calculation in the grin. He didn\u2019t fumble. He aimed.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be there tonight,\u201d Tavi said, which wasn\u2019t a question.\n\n\u201cAnd miss Oona pretending she doesn\u2019t notice the elderberries fermenting themselves? Never. I have a new one about feasts where the main course is an apology.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Tavi said again. How many times in a life do you say don\u2019t until it becomes a kind of hello. \u201cSome jokes aren\u2019t yours.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re everybody\u2019s.\u201d Grin wrinkled his nose. \u201cIt\u2019s the weather, Tavi. If you don\u2019t laugh at the dead elk on the trail you\u2019ll laugh at nothing at all.\u201d\n\n\u201cI prefer my laughs not to have ribs.\u201d\n\nGrin\u2019s eyes slid sidelong. \u201cWhat about palaces?\u201d\n\n\u201cPalaces don\u2019t have ribs.\u201d Tavi tried to keep the confusion out of his voice and failed. It came through like a draft.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t they?\u201d Grin asked, pleased with himself as if he had put a coin in an unseen slot and it had made a sound. \u201cI had a dream of a castle last night. Lush as a summer thrown indoors. Banners in silk. Walls like living stone. A in a place that knows your footprints no matter where you go. Imagine that. A big space that recognizes you.\u201d\n\n\u201cA castle?\u201d Tavi wiped his fingers on his vest, leaving tiny streaks of frost that would look like glitter to someone who wanted to sell it. \u201cIn Anchorage?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy not.\u201d Grin shrugged. \u201cHumans build square houses and call them boxes; we build boxes and call them poems. It\u2019s a failure of ambition. You\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\nTavi returned to the net. \u201cI\u2019ll wear my ambition when the weather fits it, thanks.\u201d\n\nGrin smiled as if Tavi had said exactly what he needed said. He sketched a little bow without sincerity and drifted off, humming a song with uneven bars so that your step caught on it if you weren\u2019t careful.\n\nBy dusk the grove had filled with the particular buzz of a crowd right before something. Oona arrived with her arms full of bread that steamed and cracked like it had language. She was taller than most, the way a person is taller when they are used to looking after other people\u2019s lost hats. Her wings were crow-feather black and showed every smear of flour like winter constellations. She set the bread down and kissed Tavi\u2019s forehead without waiting for permission.\n\n\u201cLook at you,\u201d she said, and pinched his ear. \u201cStringing the world up like a winter sweater.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a net,\u201d Tavi said, but smiled because there are hills you die on and then there are hills where you let your aunt call your structural work a sweater.\n\nThey shared a lane of tea and let the last of the ravens settle. The big lantern was lit. The little ones followed, like children who had been told it was a game. The air felt good on the skin. A bit of cold rubs away falseness. Tavi watched his breath and made patterns with his fingers in it, not for show, not for anything but to loosen his wrists.\n\nThe Unfurling was one part ritual, one part gossip, and the rest improvisation. There would be singing. There would be memory-work, which is a particular kind of apology in this town. There would be the Lumen Bell, which had been carried in with a hush. The bell wasn\u2019t big; it sat in Oona\u2019s hands like a story that already knew its ending. It wasn\u2019t metal at all, of course, though the humans would have drawn a bell if you asked them to draw a bell. It was a bowl spun from thinned light and the pale membrane behind a moth\u2019s wing. If you rang it properly, the whole grove remembered who it was. It took a hand like Tavi\u2019s, small and earnest and practiced.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll ring,\u201d Oona said, because people like Oona know where they\u2019re pointing you long before you see it.\n\nHe nodded.\n\nSomeone started a drum with their palms. Someone else laughed and it went up like the first little rabbit from a hedge. Tavi\u2019s chest felt tight in the good way, the too-much-of-it way when you are too full to be exactly still. Magic wants to move. Magic like his pricks the skin and says now please.\n\nGrin arrived late and made sure everyone knew it, sliding through the frost curtain with a flinch like he was a hero surviving a gauntlet. He winked at Oona. He whispered something to a group of cousins that made them howl into their hands and then pretend they hadn\u2019t. He cleared his throat and the little mothers of the grove put their hands on their hips, preemptively.\n\n\u201cNot now,\u201d Oona murmured to him. He raised his hands as if to say what could I possibly do.\n\nTavi caught his eye. Grin flashed his teeth. The net over the grove thrummed, a plucked string, as if the air itself had blinked.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll do the first strand,\u201d Oona said to Tavi, and then, with her voice turned toward everybody: \u201cTonight we hold our reminders in our hands. Tonight we take inventory of the cold and decide what it costs and what it gives. The bell is empty until we say otherwise.\u201d\n\nShe held it up, and every head tilted. It looked like a puddle cupped. The lanterns reflected in it even before she touched it. She rested it in Tavi\u2019s hands. He felt the cheapness of his own skin. All at once he wanted to apologize to it. He held on.\n\n\u201cJust breathe,\u201d Oona said, not because he\u2019d forgotten but because it changes the way you stand when someone tells you to. He breathed.\n\nHe reached for the tone he knew was right, that forgiving hum the bell liked, and found it, and he coaxed it from the rim like peeling an orange without breaking the peel. It grew. The sound was a good listener. It held them without expecting anything. The frost net shivered as if remembering what it was meant for. Someone started to cry. A few someones. Tavi felt the way he always felt when it worked right: grateful and unimportant. The sound did not need him past the first invitation. It went from person to person, a polite guest, touching a shoulder, the back of a neck. It wrote the whole grove, briefly.\n\nThen someone laughed.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t the wrong slice of sound, exactly, but it was badly timed and it hung there. It wasn\u2019t a laugh of the overwhelmed; it was not a sob in a different dialect. It was a punch line badly placed.\n\nGrin stood near the bread and he\u2019d said something, easy, something with teeth. People close to him pressed their lips together as if trying to retie the moment. The bell faltered on the same beat the laughter landed.\n\nOona\u2019s eyes moved to Grin and away because you cannot take a swing at a ghost; you have to swing at the body that made it. She did not swing. She looked at Tavi and her mouth softened. \u201cBreathe,\u201d she repeated, and he did. He used the breath to coax the tone to deepen, to swallow the stray laughter like a river takes leaves without making them the point.\n\nThe bell filled the grove again. The lanterns burned with more fat. Someone took a deep inhalation like a fresh minted coin. The moment held.\n\nAfter, there was food and caffeine and the angry gossip that lubricates communities into doing anything but nothing. Tavi ate a fistful of smoked salmon his cousin had acquired in a way everyone agreed not to ask about. He kept half an eye on the bell, sitting to the side like a good bowl.\n\nGrin drifted near him without quite arriving. Tavi could feel the tug of him the way you feel weather in your friend\u2019s knees. Grin\u2019s jokes came like knives thrown toward the ceiling. They hit beams and quivered and dropped. Sometimes they stuck. Tonight his audience was good: indulgent, older. They shook their heads. They laughed in the wrong places because you have to keep a relationship with dangerous things or they stop warning you.\n\n\u201cI suppose you did that quite well,\u201d Grin said eventually, casual, leaning as if the tree belonged to him.\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Tavi said, and took the compliment like a spiny fish: savoring it while not swallowing any bones.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re making a legend out of you,\u201d Grin went on. \u201cLittle Tavi and the bell that drank moods.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t.\u201d Tavi smiled despite himself. \u201cI\u2019d rather be known for my soup.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat would you do with it?\u201d Grin tilted his head. \u201cWhat do you do with being known? I\u2019d build. Rooms. Layers. A whole house just to keep it.\u201d He inclined his forehead toward the bell. \u201cToo bad it doesn\u2019t tolerate your fingers for more than three minutes at a time. Might make a nice paperweight for a desk.\u201d\n\n\u201cPaperweight,\u201d Tavi repeated, amused and absolutely aware they were playing a game that the others did not hear. \u201cOn a desk in a castle.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere you are.\u201d Grin\u2019s eyes lit, truly. \u201cWe can have the same dream, Tavi. Don\u2019t act like yours are small. You perform like someone who knows the difference between a stage and a floor.\u201d\n\n\u201cStages are for people who want handclaps,\u201d Tavi said. \u201cFloors are for people who want dancing.\u201d\n\nOona had shushed a cluster of second cousins from eating all the jam with their hands when a child\u2019s cry split the soft.\n\n\u201cBell,\u201d the child said, and pointed.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t where they\u2019d left it.\n\nTavi\u2019s stomach dropped as if somebody had pulled the floorboards out from under him. It sat now on the stump near the edge of the grove, almost precisely where it had been but an inch and a half to the left. That leftness mattered. His whole body knew it. Oona\u2019s wings stiffened.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t,\u201d Tavi said, on reflex, on instinct, on fear, and Oona said, \u201cOf course you didn\u2019t.\u201d She had taught him not to pre-apologize to a room.\n\nGrin spread his hands as if to say how could I. In his palms, invisible near enough to everyone but not to Tavi, there was the powder of a spell that takes ownership off of things. The kind used to slip a key from a hook unnoticed, used to make someone believe a chair had always been where it now sat and not where it belonged.\n\nTavi\u2019s mouth went dry. He stepped forward slowly, as if approaching a skittish animal, as if the bell itself might bolt. The frost net above head rang like spun glass. He reached the stump, reached for the bowl. It looked exactly the same except for the way it wasn\u2019t congruent with where it had been. He set his hand to it. It was warm. The bell should not be warm unless it had just been rung. It had not been rung.\n\nHe looked up. Grin\u2019s face was innocent as a winter day. His smile had dialed down to polite.\n\n\u201cMagic likes to be touched,\u201d Grin observed to nobody in particular. \u201cYou cannot isolate the interesting parts and expect the rest to wait in the lobby.\u201d\n\nOona was beside Tavi now, one hand on his shoulder like reassurance, the other hovering near the bell without touching. Her eyes flicked to the powder on Grin\u2019s hands. You always think elders see nothing until they smell your breath for berries.\n\n\u201cFunny,\u201d she said. It sounded not at all like praise.\n\n\u201cI am,\u201d Grin agreed mildly. \u201cIt\u2019s an illness.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen stop coughing on our food,\u201d Oona said, which pulled a reluctant laugh from a few throats, turned the air. She leaned around Tavi and whispered something the bell could hear. The bowl cooled, very slightly. She nodded to Tavi, one little dip: we do not play into his timing. We have our own.\n\nThey proceeded. Memory-work resumed. People tied strands of aunts and brothers and old dogs into the low branches like cloth. Someone sang about the way the river dragged ice. The night grew. The small wrong thing sat on the stump like an extra guest whose name you couldn\u2019t quite place.\n\nBy the time they doused the last lantern Tavi\u2019s jaw hurt. He had not realized he\u2019d been clenching it. He helped Oona tuck the leftovers into their baskets. He threaded a safeguard around the bell that was small and mean as an insult; he almost felt bad for it.\n\nGrin lounged against a trunk observing this, not hiding his watching. \u201cYou look like a man who\u2019s just discovered a stain on his favorite shirt,\u201d he mused. \u201cThe one you wear when you walk past windows and pretend you\u2019re taller than you are.\u201d\n\n\u201cGo home, Grin,\u201d Oona said. \u201cDo not entertain mischief tonight; it will take you up on it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI live where the mischief sleeps,\u201d Grin replied. \u201cWe share a pillow.\u201d He swung his feet like a boy on a dock.\n\nWhen the grove thinned to the final few and the night swole with the comfortable silence of after, Tavi and Oona carried the bell together, each with one hand on the bottom for balance, into the trunk where its nest was. Oona had gauge marks on her palm from other nights, other places. She set it down with the grace of someone who knows grace is just practice that remembers.\n\n\u201cI think he moved it,\u201d Tavi said, quiet enough that it was a thought spoken aloud.\n\n\u201cI think he wanted you to think he did,\u201d Oona said, and tapped the bell twice, as if listening for cavities. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s the same thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf he can reach it with a joke, what can he reach with a plan?\u201d\n\nOona blew out a breath through her nose. \u201cYou cannot police his mouth, Tavi. Only your reaction.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d he said, but he didn\u2019t. Not in the practical sense. He wanted to rub the thought out like a chalk mark.\n\n\u201cHe has the talent\u2014they laugh, he rearranges them. Dangerous if you are not careful. Which is why we watch him together.\u201d\n\nTavi glanced at the seam in his vest. He fussed with it. \u201cHe talked about a castle today.\u201d\n\nOona barked a little laugh. \u201cHe would.\u201d She eyed the curve of the bell as if it were a future you could bowl. \u201cPalaces breed restlessness. They think of walls as appetites.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe believes he deserves one,\u201d Tavi said. He tasted the truth of that and the bitterness too.\n\n\u201cWould you like a castle?\u201d Oona asked, a little sideways, a little testing for the pitch of the question.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Tavi said, quick and then slower: \u201cI want walls that are whom I\u2019ve worked with. A stove that knows my hands. A window that forgives unwashed cups by morning.\u201d\n\nOona kissed the top of his head. \u201cYou\u2019ll do fine if you hold on to that. The trouble with Grin is not that he wants a big room. It\u2019s that he wants the room to be someone he can win.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat if he can?\u201d Tavi asked, and Oona said, not soothing, not a lullaby, \u201cThen we have work to do.\u201d\n\nOn the way back to his spot behind the restaurant, the sky decided to be three new kinds of blue. The buildings mumbled to each other like old men on benches. Tavi walked the edges of human light and the steepness of pixie dark. He stood to watch the neon bear of a tourist shop turn its head, as if even signs got to stretch when nobody looked. He felt the bell at the back of his heart like a coin under the tongue. The wrongness of the shift would not leave.\n\nHe ducked into the alley. His sardine-tin chair sat right where he\u2019d left it, bless a small world. He set his hand on it anyway because things behave better when spoken to, and he said thank you. He sat. He made the mistake of letting the night settle without giving it a chore. It came and sat on his chest like a cat.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re ridiculous,\u201d he told himself aloud, and that helped. He pulled a piece of string from his pocket and made a figure out of it, a fox if you were generous. He let his fingertips spark and did not do anything but feel the flit of current between skin and air. Cool. Warm. Electric. He played with it until it bored him.\n\n\u201cStop that,\u201d a voice said. \u201cYou\u2019ll burn your fingerprints off.\u201d\n\nTavi did jump then, because he hadn\u2019t heard the approach. Grin slid into the alley like he belonged to all places that had space for a person the width of a wish. His grin was tired now. The jokes had drained him like tapping a maple. He leaned against a stack of crates that had seen everything and kept counsel anyway.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t sneak,\u201d Tavi said, not a command so much as a plea.\n\n\u201cWhat, and miss the romance of startling someone? You should thank me. Keeps your heart young.\u201d Grin pulled a small paper bag from his coat and shook it in Tavi\u2019s direction. \u201cA peace offering. Not that we are at war. Yet.\u201d\n\nTavi took it cautiously. Inside were candied spruce tips. He couldn\u2019t stop the little happiness in his chest; his mouth watered on reflex. He ate one and pretended not to make a noise of satisfaction.\n\n\u201cSee?\u201d Grin said softly. \u201cYou only wanted sugar.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d Tavi asked, because he\u2019d learned that with Grin you circle a long time if you don\u2019t pin the tail on the goat.\n\nGrin looked up at the slice of sky. He made a face. Not disgust. Not delight. Something with a flavor of hunger. \u201cI want a room where my laughter isn\u2019t an accident,\u201d he said. \u201cYou want control over your bell; I want control over my punch lines. Same thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cControl is different from harm,\u201d Tavi said.\n\n\u201cAnd intent is different from result,\u201d Grin replied. \u201cYou can say you wanted to make everyone feel included and still make someone small.\u201d He squinted at Tavi. \u201cYou know that, don\u2019t you? With your nets and your neatness.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe I do,\u201d Tavi admitted. He could feel the seams of his certainty. It was not an apology. \u201cPlease don\u2019t touch the bell again.\u201d\n\nGrin tilted his head. \u201cPlease don\u2019t tell me not to do something. It makes my spine itchy.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll scratch it for you with a fork,\u201d Tavi said, which startled a laugh out of both of them. They sat in that mutual noise without knowing they\u2019d wanted it.\n\nGrin sobered. \u201cI didn\u2019t push it much. It wanted to move a little. I helped.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Tavi said a third time, because third times in a night make a pattern. \u201cYou don\u2019t get to decide what wants.\u201d\n\nGrin grew quiet in a way he rarely was. \u201cEverything wants something, Tavi. Stones want to rest. Water wants the downward. Words want mouths. My mouth wants air and the shape of a room. If the room isn\u2019t the right shape I make it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t keep doing it in ours.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou think this grove is yours? What, because you made a net out of weather?\u201d His tone sharpened, not because he wished to wound but because it was his instrument. \u201cIf I am cruel\u2014and I don\u2019t accept that I am always\u2014be crueler. Stop me. Tell me no in a way that doesn\u2019t turn into wallpaper.\u201d\n\nTavi rubbed his eyes, weariness settling behind his ears like cold. \u201cI did.\u201d\n\nGrin nodded, as if that had been a portion of a cake he wanted anyway. He stepped away from the crates like he hadn\u2019t left any imprint. He tucked his hands into his pockets and the powder of the unsubtle spell dusted down into his seams, as if he were always wearing mischief.\n\nHe paused. \u201cI dream of a place with a ceiling so high we think there isn\u2019t one,\u201d he said, soft, almost for himself. \u201cWhere you can take a running start on a joke and not hit someone\u2019s grief. Where laughter can be its own person and not a weapon and not a shield. And the floor would be moss with a sensible sense of humor. And the bathwater would be warm, forever.\u201d\n\nTavi wanted to tell him that those places did not exist; he also wanted to build one for him. He ate another spruce tip because sweetness helps with unsayable things. \u201cAnchorage isn\u2019t going to give you a castle,\u201d he said, mild.\n\n\u201cThen I will take one from somewhere else,\u201d Grin said, and smiled with his eyes closed. \u201cOr else I will grow it like a tooth.\u201d\n\nWhen he left he left the alley a little bigger than it had been. It was a trick of the eyes. It was also a promise. Tavi sat with it until the cold convinced him to his feet. He went home and lay on his belly under the boards and listened to the ship horns and the cars that never learned and the crows\u2019 gossip. He told the dark: I will not let him make us sad. Which is not a vow you can keep. He slept badly.\n\nIn the morning Oona came to his spot with a tin of lemon cookies that were either too tart or too sweet depending on how much you didn\u2019t want them. She carried a small, flat bundle wrapped in oilcloth.\n\n\u201cBefore you say anything,\u201d she said, \u201cI have something for you and yes you will think it is too much and yes you will take it anyway.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t sustain this level of ferocity before coffee,\u201d Tavi said, but he took the tin and the bundle. He peeled back the cloth. Inside lay a map. Not drawn in ink. Scrimshawed, it would be called if it were bone, which it wasn\u2019t. The lines had been stitched into the fabric, the thread dyed with the juice of boiled moss. It showed the city the way a fox sees it. The warm pipes. The ways under doors. The good drains. The places where the ground hums.\n\n\u201cIt shows desire lines,\u201d Oona said. \u201cWhere a person thinks they\u2019re going, not where they say. We made it last winter when the pipes froze wrong. Consider it\u2026 insurance. For if you need to find someone who is going where they don\u2019t want people to think they are going. Or if you just want a better walk.\u201d\n\n\u201cOona,\u201d Tavi said, because her name itself tuned his ribcage. \u201cThank you.\u201d\n\nShe waved it off. \u201cIt\u2019s an old trick. But the thread is new. Careful of the edges. It\u2019ll bite you if you think it\u2019s an ordinary thing.\u201d\n\nTavi traced a line that shivered under his finger like it desired to leave. \u201cYou think I should follow him.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think curiosity is a muscle we should feed. And we should not let generosity pretend it is naive.\u201d Oona\u2019s face went mean and dear at once, a trick very few could pull. \u201cI also think if he decides to build this castle he\u2019s going to need more than words. He\u2019ll go looking for the Lumen again. Or something like it. He wants to make walls out of attention. You\u2019re the attention he wants to break.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t want to break me,\u201d Tavi said. He believed it while he said it. It wobbled like a chord held past its natural end.\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t know what he wants,\u201d Oona said. \u201cThat\u2019s the dangerous bit.\u201d\n\nThey ate lemon cookies. They drank coffee blooming with a splash of something you could call cream if you didn\u2019t own a dictionary. The day wore its winter half-mask with pride. They spread the map and watched the lines settle as if the city were a cat finding comfort.\n\nGrin\u2019s line\u2014if that is what it was\u2014ran broken through the neighborhoods that thought they were safe from pixies and turned abruptly toward the water and then reluctantly toward the hills. It had a stutter in it, a hesitance, a laugh he had told that bruised him back. Tavi put his finger on the end. The line nipped him. He did not pull away.\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d he said. \u201cOkay.\u201d\n\nThe day took on a purpose that had nothing to do with lanterns. Tavi packed his vest and patched his seam with a dark thread that would show. He told Oona where he would be. He told three friends so the telling had weight. He left breadcrumbs in the old fish way\u2014actual crumbs of biscuits the mice liked and messages for the wind. He took the map and the bell\u2019s distant echo into his pocket and set out.\n\nAnchorage widened. He had not realized how many of the good old paths had gotten dull underfoot. He walked them and watched them brighten. He cut across the parking lot of a shuttered store that had turned into a church and back into a store again. He ducked into a culvert and emerged smelling like a rumor.\n\nHe found signs of Grin the way you find handwriting in the air if you think a person has just spoken: a hangover of laughter, a prickle at the back of the neck, a joke that had been told two streets over and didn\u2019t deserve to walk this far. He followed the hunger of it. It led where Oona had guessed\u2014toward the water and then inland where the spruce did things with the light that made you believe in old gods again.\n\nBy the time he reached the first climb of the foothills, his ribs felt like an accordion and his heart like a stubborn drummer. He didn\u2019t stop because he didn\u2019t know what he\u2019d do if he did. He kept the map in his pocket where it warmed the side of his thigh with an insistent mind of its own.\n\nHe found Grin two hours into the walk, as if the city had slowed him, as if his jokes were heavy in his pockets. Grin stood in a small clearing where the snow still believed nobody had noticed it, scratching a shape into the dirt with a stick. It was a circle, of course, because people love circles. He looked up without surprise when Tavi arrived, as if this was the sort of coincidence you could build a religion on.\n\n\u201cYou brought your conscience,\u201d Grin said, nodding at the bulge where the map sat. \u201cAnd your sense of direction. Smart.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou brought a magic circle into the woods,\u201d Tavi said, equally obvious.\n\n\u201cIt is foolish to build a castle without marking where the wind thinks the corners should be,\u201d Grin replied, and gestured at the circle. \u201cCome in then. Take my measure. Tell me I am wrong. Do whatever you need to do so you can sleep with your mean cat.\u201d\n\nTavi stepped up to the circle and did not cross it. \u201cIf you bring the bell out here I will carry you home by your ears.\u201d\n\n\u201cHard to carry a creature taller than you,\u201d Grin said, but his eyes flicked, briefly, to Tavi\u2019s hands. \u201cI know your strength.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you know your own?\u201d Tavi asked.\n\nGrin laughed. \u201cNo. Not yet. That\u2019s the point.\u201d He tapped the circle. \u201cYou think I like being the man at the edge of the room making everyone look at me to prove I am there? I want walls that look back.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd beyond them?\u201d Tavi asked, because sometimes you can only find a person by asking them what succeeds their cathedrals.\n\n\u201cA garden,\u201d Grin said, and Tavi believed him. \u201cSomething that keeps growing if the jokes go bad.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou tell inappropriate jokes,\u201d Tavi said, blunt because the trees liked it that way. \u201cSometimes cruel ones.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Grin said. He looked tired again. \u201cIt\u2019s the only time the room seems to pay attention to the true edge of things. Or maybe it\u2019s just that I don\u2019t know how to do it different and not vanish.\u201d\n\n\u201cTry entertaining kindness,\u201d Tavi said softly. \u201cIt\u2019s got better material. Harder timing. You\u2019ve got the hands for hard timing.\u201d\n\nGrin\u2019s jaw worked. He stepped into his own circle and stood like a penitent and like a king. \u201cHelp me build it then,\u201d he said, naked in a way that made Tavi want to cover him with both hands and a coat. \u201cBecause if I build it alone I will build something you cannot live with.\u201d\n\nTavi stared at him. He remembered the powder on Grin\u2019s hands. He remembered the warm bell. He remembered the spruce tips. He remembered the way Grin\u2019s laugh had buckled under itself when it fell into a wrong place. He wanted to say yes the way we want to say yes standing at a cliff face while the wind says jump. He wanted to say no in a way that he wouldn\u2019t regret when he was older and had his own apprentice, gods help him.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll help you,\u201d he said, and it unlaced something in Grin\u2019s shoulders. \u201cBut\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Grin said, rolling his eyes skyward, mocking the gods. \u201cThere\u2019s always a but.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut,\u201d Tavi went on, \u201cyou do not touch the bell. You do not test the room with a knife. You do not force laughter. You build quiet things first. Walls that do not make you feel bigger than you are or smaller than you\u2019re afraid. And if you bring a joke into my kitchen I will salt it until it can\u2019t hurt anyone.\u201d\n\nGrin smiled with a gentleness that did not sit easy on him and made him beautiful. \u201cYou\u2019re very controlling.\u201d\n\n\u201cI told you,\u201d Tavi said simply. \u201cI\u2019m good at magic.\u201d\n\nGrin nodded, made a tiny bow that contained more sincerity than any other he\u2019d given. \u201cLet\u2019s begin with a wall then. A small one. A practice rib.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou said walls had ribs,\u201d Tavi recalled.\n\n\u201cThey do now,\u201d Grin said. They crouched together at the circle\u2019s boundary and started to argue about corners in the language of small stones. The forest watched. The wind took notes. The first part of a castle is always a rumor.\n\nBy the time their hands were raw and their bellies had forgotten why they had been invented, a low line of earth lay where there had been none, dusted lightly with frost that did not dare melt. It was nothing. It was a song that had lost its words. Grin sat back on his heels and looked like what he wanted would kill him and he was letting it.\n\n\u201cAgain tomorrow,\u201d Tavi said, because that is how you make anything stay.\n\nGrin nodded. He reached out like he might touch Tavi\u2019s shoulder and thought better of it. \u201cOkay,\u201d he said, and almost the tiniest voice.\n\nThey walked back down together, not quite touching, like magnets with a paper between them. When they parted at the edge of the grove, Grin made a face like he had swallowed less than he had hoped to. He shook himself. \u201cI\u2019m going to tell a joke,\u201d he warned.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Tavi said, smiling for the first time at the ritual of it.\n\nGrin told it anyway, but softly, so nobody could be hurt by it, and it was not vulgar, not tonight; it was about a chair that learned to dance when nobody was home. Tavi laughed not because it was funny but because all furniture should get a chance. The frost net above them hummed in approval. The bell, nested in its quiet trunk like a heart inside a ribcage, listened.\n\nAnchorage sleeping was a good place to be a pixie if you liked to find things you hadn\u2019t known you were missing. Tavi fell asleep with dirt under his nails and a map under his pillow. In his dream a wall rose where there had been air, and it smelled like spruce and lemon cookies and the edge of a joke that might finally be kind. He woke with the certain knowledge that nothing that important ever held still, and that Grin had already found a way to cheat at corners.\n\nHe sighed. He put the kettle on. He tied his hair back. And when Oona came round he looked her in the eye, as if the day had been expecting it, and told her everything.",
