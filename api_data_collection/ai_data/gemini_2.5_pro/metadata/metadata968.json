     "novel_text": "The rain over Walsall had a particular quality, a kind of weary persistence that didn't bother with the drama of a downpour but aimed instead for a slow, comprehensive soaking. It was a rain that seeped, that found the tiny imperfections in a window seal or the collar of a coat, and it had been DCI Eleanor Vance\u2019s only companion for the last four hours. She sat in the driver's seat of the unmarked Ford, the engine cold, her breath a fleeting mist on the inside of the glass. The world beyond the windscreen was a palette of greys and damp browns; the corrugated iron of the industrial unit they were watching, the slick tarmac of the service road, the bruised sky.\n\n\"Anything?\" DC Chopra's voice, startlingly young and crisp, crackled through the radio wedged in the cup holder.\n\nEllie picked it up, her thumb pressing the transmit button with an economy of movement that came from twenty-five years on the force. \"Negative, Sameer. Just a very bored-looking pigeon and enough rain to float the Black Country out to sea. You?\"\n\n\"Same, guv. Tea\u2019s gone cold. The flask has betrayed me.\"\n\nA ghost of a smile touched Ellie\u2019s lips. Chopra was a good lad. Keen. A bit too much like a Labrador puppy sometimes, desperate for a pat on the head, but his paperwork was immaculate and he could actually make a comprehensible entry in the evidence log, which put him in the top percentile of DCs she\u2019d had to break in. \"Suffering builds character, Chopra. Stick with it.\"\n\nShe dropped the radio back into its holder and flexed her fingers around the steering wheel. A dull ache had settled deep in her right knee, a souvenir from a chase through a scrapyard in Tipton a decade ago. It was her body\u2019s own weather forecast, and it was predicting a monsoon. She was fifty-two. Too old for this nonsense, for sitting in a damp car on a Tuesday night waiting for a low-level fence named Gazza to show up with a van full of stolen catalytic converters. This was a job for the keen puppies, not the old dog. But Superintendent Davies had made a point of it. \"A personal touch, Ellie. Show the team you're still one of them. Boots on the ground.\" Davies's idea of 'boots on the ground' was sending someone else's boots to get damp while he attended a regional planning dinner.\n\nShe rubbed at her eyes, the heels of her palms pressing hard enough to make stars burst behind her lids. Fatigue was a constant, a low hum beneath the surface of her thoughts. When she pulled her hands away, she glanced at her knuckles, resting on the smooth grey plastic of the wheel. For a splinter of a second, the strangest thing happened. The texture of the dashboard, the faint crisscross pattern, was visible *through* her skin. It was as if her hand had become a pane of smoky glass. She blinked, hard. And it was gone. Her hand was just a hand again, solid and pale, the skin a little dry. A network of fine lines and a single, silvery scar from a misplaced bread knife.\n\nA migraine aura, she told herself. Stress. Not enough sleep, too much caffeine. The optic nerve playing tricks. It had to be. She\u2019d had them before, strange scintillating zig-zags at the edge of her vision. This was just a new, and admittedly unsettling, variation. She resolutely filed the incident away in the mental cabinet marked 'Things To Ignore' and forced her attention back to the shuttered door of Unit 14B.\n\nAnother hour crawled by. The pigeon, having concluded its business, flew away. Ellie\u2019s mind drifted. It wasn't supposed to be like this. She\u2019d pictured DCI as the pinnacle, a position of command and strategy, of moving pieces on a chessboard. She hadn't accounted for the sheer, grinding weight of the bureaucracy, the budget meetings, the performance reviews, the endless demand for statistics that painted a rosier picture than the reality on the streets. Her life had narrowed until the job was all that was left. It had consumed her marriage years ago, swallowed up friendships, and now it was gnawing away at her sanity, one stakeout at a time.\n\nHer only escape, her one remaining secret pleasure, was the golf course. The early weekend mornings at the municipal, the clean crack of a well-hit drive, the singular focus on a small white ball. It was a different kind of problem-solving. Trajectory, wind speed, the lie of the land. There were rules, and they made sense. Unlike life. She had a set of second-hand Callaways in the boot of her own car, a battered stand bag she'd had since her thirties. It was the only part of her life that felt entirely her own, untainted by the job.\n\nA flash of headlights jerked her back to the present. A white transit van, mud-splashed and dented, swung into the service road, its engine rattling like a can of bolts. It reversed clumsily up to the doors of Unit 14B.\n\n\"Contact,\" she said into the radio, her voice low and steady. The fatigue vanished, replaced by a familiar, cold thrill. \"White transit. Stand by.\"\n\n\"Copied, guv,\" came Chopra's immediate reply, the puppy now a wolf, alert and ready.\n\nThe van's side door slid open and a man in a high-vis jacket jumped out. Gary \"Gazza\" Tomlinson. He was practically a local landmark. He fumbled with a set of keys, unlocked a huge padlock, and began to heave the big metal shutter upwards. It rose with a deafening screech that tore through the quiet evening. The moment it was high enough, two more figures emerged from the darkness of the unit.\n\n\"Right,\" Ellie murmured, her hand already on the door handle. \"Let's go and say hello.\"\n\nShe gave the signal. Two other cars, hidden further down the road, flicked on their lights. Her own door opened and she was out in the rain, the cold shock of it welcome now. Chopra was already sprinting from his position, his longer legs eating up the ground. The three men by the van froze, their faces a comical tableau of surprise and dismay in the sudden glare of the headlights. Gazza, to his credit, reacted first. He spun around and bolted, not towards the road, but back into the labyrinthine mess of the industrial estate.\n\n\"Chopra, with me!\" Ellie yelled, breaking into a surprisingly fast run, her bad knee screaming in protest. \"Uniforms, secure the other two!\"\n\nAdrenaline was a wonderful anaesthetic. She ignored the pain, her eyes locked on Gazza\u2019s bright yellow jacket as he dodged between stacked pallets and rusted skips. He was younger, but he was a smoker and she was fueled by pure, distilled rage at the thought of the paperwork this chase was going to generate. She was gaining on him. He glanced over his shoulder, his eyes wide with panic, and swerved into a narrow alley between two units. A dead end. He knew it the moment he was in. He spun around, panting, his hands held up.\n\n\"Alright, alright, guv! It's a fair cop!\"\n\nEllie slowed to a walk, catching her breath, the rain plastering her hair to her forehead. Chopra arrived a second later, puffing but triumphant. \"Got him, guv.\"\n\n\"Good work, Sameer. Cuff him.\" As Chopra wrestled with the cuffs and a suddenly uncooperative Gazza, Ellie leaned against the cold brick wall of the alley, the adrenaline starting to ebb, leaving the ache in her knee in its wake. She looked down at her hand, braced against the damp brickwork. And it happened again. Slower this time. A creeping transparency, starting at the fingertips. She could see the dark, moss-stained mortar of the wall through her own flesh. It was like watching ice melt, but in reverse, turning from solid to spectral. She stared, mesmerized and horrified, as the effect travelled up her wrist, her watch seeming to float on an invisible arm.\n\n\"Guv? You okay?\" Chopra's voice cut through her daze.\n\nShe snatched her hand away from the wall, shoving it into her pocket. When she looked at it in the darkness there, it was solid again. Just a hand. \"Fine,\" she snapped, her voice harsher than she intended. \"Just... catching my breath. Get him back to the van.\" The rest of the arrest was a blur of procedure. The other two suspects were compliant, the van was full of stolen tech, and by the time they got back to the station, the canteen was serving lukewarm stew. Ellie skipped the stew. She went to her office, the strange flickering of her hand replaying in her mind. She wrote her initial report with a kind of numb efficiency, her fingers hitting the keyboard with mechanical precision. Davies would be pleased. A good result. A feather in his cap.\n\nIt was past midnight when she finally left the station. The rain had, at last, given up. The streets of Walsall glistened under the orange streetlights, empty and quiet. Her house was on a neat, boring estate that had seemed like a sensible choice ten years ago and now just felt like a trap. It was tidy, sterile. The home of someone who was never there. She kicked off her shoes, dropped her keys in a ceramic bowl by the door, and walked through the silent house to the downstairs bathroom.\n\nShe didn't know why, but she had to look. A morbid curiosity. She flicked on the light. The face in the mirror was tired. Dark circles under the eyes, a fretful line between her brows. The face of DCI Eleanor Vance, fifty-two, divorced, no kids, married to the job. It was a face she was tired of looking at. She sighed, picked up her toothbrush, and squeezed a line of paste onto it. She turned on the tap, ran the brush under it, and began to scrub at her teeth with a grim determination. It was just another night. Another day done.\n\nShe spat into the sink, rinsed her mouth, and looked up.\n\nAnd screamed. A silent, strangled gasp that caught in her throat.\n\nThe mirror was empty.\n\nNo, not empty. The mirror was reflecting the bathroom perfectly. The beige tiles, the towel rail with its neatly folded hand towel, the bottle of hand soap on the edge of the sink, the light fixture on the ceiling. It was all there. Everything except her.\n\nHer mind refused to process it. She could feel her heart hammering against ribs she couldn't see. She could feel the cold tile floor under feet that were not there. The toothbrush, which she had been holding, fell from an invisible hand, clattering against the white porcelain of the basin with a sound that was far too loud in the sudden, terrifying silence of her world. She raised her arms, or where her arms ought to be. Nothing. She flapped them, a frantic, desperate motion. All she saw was the wall behind her. She was gone. The face she was so tired of looking at, the body that ached with the weight of her life, the whole solid presence of her, had simply... ceased to be. There was only the empty space where a woman should have been, and the frantic, invisible pulse of pure, unadulterated terror.Her first rational thought, slicing through the static of her terror, was that she was having a stroke. Or a complete psychotic break. The mind, pushed far enough, would simply snap the tether to reality. She had seen it happen to suspects, to victims, even to a colleague once after a particularly gruesome case involving a family. But this felt different. It didn't feel like a hallucination. The chill of the tiled floor was real, the lingering minty tang of toothpaste in her mouth was real, the solid, familiar shape of her own jaw beneath her questing, invisible fingers was terrifyingly, irrefutably real. She could feel the soft fabric of her Henley shirt against her skin, trace the waistband of her trousers, feel the pulse hammering in a throat she could no longer see.\n\nIt was then she looked down. Her clothes weren\u2019t invisible. They hung in the air, a ghostly sculpture of a person. The grey shirt was rumpled, the dark trousers creased at the non-existent knees, the sleeves puckered at the elbows. It was the most obscene thing she had ever seen; a person-shaped void, delineated by cotton and denim. She held up an arm, and the grey sleeve lifted with it, empty and limp from the wrist. She balled a fist she could not see, and the material at the end of the sleeve tightened. It was a macabre puppet show, and she was the unseen puppeteer, the ghost in her own machine.\n\nThe detective in her, buried under an avalanche of panic, began to claw its way out. Observation. Facts. What did she know? Fact one: her body was invisible to the naked eye, and apparently to mirrors. Fact two: her clothes were not. Fact three: she was still solid, possessed mass, and was subject to gravity. Fact four: the phenomenon was intermittent before, but now seemed total. She stumbled out of the bathroom, away from the damning evidence of the mirror, her hand trailing along the wall for balance. The sensation was bizarre, watching the wall and feeling its textured wallpaper slide against a palm that wasn't there. She was a moving blind spot.\n\nShe made her way into the living room, the familiar space now alien and menacing. Every object seemed to mock her with its stolid visibility. The sofa, the television, the framed photograph on the mantelpiece of her and her ex-husband, taken in a happier time. She was a ghost in her own home, a ghost in her own life. Who could she call? The very idea was insane. \u2018Hello, desk sergeant? I\u2019d like to report a missing DCI. Yes, that\u2019s me. I\u2019m reporting myself missing. I\u2019m at my home address, but I appear to have mislaid my entire physical body.\u2019 They would have the mental health team at her door in ten minutes. Dr. Evans? He\u2019d triple her antidepressants and book her a long stay in a quiet room with padded walls. Chopra? The poor lad would have a nervous breakdown. No. This was hers. A problem of one. The ultimate solitary confinement.\n\nHer gaze fell on the hallway that led to the back door and the small, attached garage. In there, propped against a stack of old newspapers, was her golf bag. The battered Callaways, the scuffed leather of the bag itself. Suddenly, she had a desperate, irrational need to see it, to touch it. It was her only anchor, the one part of her life that was just about sport and physics and clean air, untainted by crime and paperwork and the slow, grinding erosion of her soul. Moving with a new, frantic purpose, she walked towards the garage, her empty clothes shuffling through the silent house. It was an absurd pilgrimage, a search for solace in a set of metal sticks. But in a world that had just casually ripped up every rule she had ever known, the simple, solid reality of a three-iron felt like the only sane thing left.The internal door to the garage clicked open with a familiar groan, pushed by a disembodied grey sleeve. The air inside was cool and still, thick with the scents of engine oil, damp concrete, and the faint, sweet perfume of dried grass clippings from the lawnmower. It was a space of deferred tasks and forgotten hobbies; stacked boxes of case files marked for archiving, a dusty workbench cluttered with tools she rarely used, a deflated bicycle tyre hanging from a hook like a dead snake. But her eyes sought only one thing. Propped in the corner, illuminated by the weak light spilling from the hallway, was her golf bag. It was old and worn, the black and red fabric faded, the stand slightly bent. It looked solid. It looked real.\n\nShe approached it slowly, a shuffling set of clothes moving through the gloom. Her invisible hand reached out, the grey cuff of her shirt hovering just above the worn leather of the bag\u2019s handle. She hesitated for a fraction of a second, then her fingers closed around it. The feel of it was a shock of normality. The pebbled texture of the handle, the slight give in the stitching, the sheer physical fact of it beneath her grasp. It was an anchor in a world that had become a phantom sea. She let out a breath she hadn\u2019t realised she was holding, her shoulders, hidden beneath the fabric, slumping in relief. She ran her other hand down the side of the bag, her unseen fingers tracing the zips and pockets, finally closing around the cold, hard shaft of her driver where it stuck out from the top. The sensation was grounding, a confirmation that her sense of touch, at least, had not deserted her.\n\nThe terror, while not gone, receded enough for the investigator to surface. This was a scene. She was the evidence. She had to analyse it. The toothbrush had been visible when it fell. The clothes were visible now. The golf club in her hand was still stubbornly, reassuringly a golf club. She pulled her seven-iron from its slot, the metal scraping softly against the other clubs. Holding it aloft, she watched as the club hovered in the garage air, suspended by an unseen force. It was a cheap magic trick, utterly baffling and real. Any object she held remained visible. This wasn\u2019t a field of invisibility that extended outwards; it was a property of her own body. The implications started to slot into place with cold, logical precision. She couldn't walk down the street. People wouldn't see her, but they would see a floating coat and trousers ambling along the pavement. She couldn't pick up a cup of coffee without it appearing to levitate.\n\nThere was only one logical, if utterly mad, course of action. The clothes had to come off. The thought made her skin, the skin she could feel but not see, crawl. To be naked and invisible in her own cold garage felt like the punchline to a terrible joke she didn't understand. With clumsy, fumbling motions, she began to undress. Unbuttoning her shirt was a bizarre act of faith, her fingers working by memory and feel alone, the fabric parting to reveal\u2026 nothing. Just the back wall of the garage seen through the gap in her shirt. She pulled it off, letting it drop to the concrete floor where it lay in a sad, grey heap. Then came the trousers, the belt buckle cold against her spectral fingertips, until they too were pooled around her ankles. She stepped out of them, and then, finally, stripped off her socks and underwear.\n\nShe stood for a long moment in the absolute, bone-aching cold of the garage, every nerve ending screaming with the chill. She was completely, utterly gone. She waved an arm and saw only the dusty workbench behind it. She looked down at the floor and saw only the cracked concrete where her feet should be. The only proof of her existence was the cold, the frantic drumming of her own heart, and the faint disturbance in the air as she breathed. She took a tentative step, then another. It felt like walking in a dream, a disembodied consciousness drifting through a solid world. She shuffled over to the wing mirror of her car, leaning in close until her non-existent nose was almost touching the glass. The reflection was perfect and unbroken: the shelves, the boxes, the sad, discarded pile of her clothes on the floor. Of Eleanor Vance, there was not a single trace. The experiment was a success. The conclusion was horrifying. This was not an illusion. This was her reality now. A ghost in her own life, stripped bare and shivering in the dark.## Chapter 2\n\nThe cold was the first thing to truly cut through the panic. Not the background chill of the rainy evening, but a deep, invasive cold that settled into her unseen bones as she stood naked on the concrete floor. It was a physical fact, an undeniable sensation that proved her body, though vanished from sight, was still a vessel of nerve endings and shivering muscle. The ghost was getting hypothermia. The absurdity of it was almost enough to make her laugh, but the sound died in her throat. She had to move, to get warm, to think. She turned, a ripple of disturbed air in the stillness of the garage, and walked back into the house, her invisible feet silent on the laminate flooring of the hall. She closed the door to the garage behind her, the soft click of the latch sealing her in with her impossible secret.\n\nA hot shower seemed like the most logical first step. It was a routine, a human ritual, and she clung to the idea of it like a drowning woman to a piece of driftwood. The bathroom was a chamber of horrors now, with its truth-telling mirror, but she forced herself back inside. She didn't look at the reflection of the empty room. Instead, she reached for the shower dial, her unseen fingers recognising the familiar shape and resistance. Watching the chrome fixture turn, seemingly of its own accord, was profoundly unsettling. She stepped into the cubicle and pulled the glass door shut. When the water hit, hot and hard, she gasped. It wasn't just the warmth, it was the confirmation. She could feel every single drop, a million tiny impacts against her shoulders, her back, her legs. The steam billowed around her, swirling and eddying against an invisible shape, momentarily outlining a human form before dissipating into the general haze. It was the closest she had come to seeing herself in what felt like an eternity.\n\nWrapped in a large bath towel that seemed to float around her middle, she padded into the living room and sank into the soft cushions of her armchair. The fabric dipped, compressed by a weight it could not see. She sat there for a long time, the only sound the frantic thumping of her own heart and the drip of water from her spectral hair onto the towel. The detective in her began to stir, methodically, pushing aside the raw animal fear. This was a case. The most bizarre case of her career, and she was the sole victim, witness, and investigator. She began to assemble the facts in her head. Fact one: the condition is total invisibility of her biological matter. Fact two: inanimate objects she holds or wears remain visible. Fact three: her physical solidity, mass, and sensory perceptions remain intact. She could still feel, hear, taste, smell, and interact with the world. She was a perfectly functional human being who had been deleted from the visible spectrum. The \u2018migraine aura\u2019 theory was now laughably insufficient. This wasn't a trick of the light; it was a fundamental violation of the laws of physics as she knew them.\n\nAs dawn began to bleed grey light through the cracks in the blinds, the silence of the house was shattered by a shrill, demanding ring. The landline. Her heart, which had just begun to settle into a steady rhythm of dread, kicked into a frantic gallop. The caller ID display glowed on the handset in the hallway: WEST MIDS POLICE. They were checking on her. She was late. Of course she was late. For the first time in twenty-five years, DCI Vance was a no-show. The phone rang again, insistent. It was a lifeline to a world she was no longer part of, and a threat to the secret she had to keep. She had to answer it. To not answer would trigger a welfare check, and the thought of a pair of uniformed officers breaking down her door to find an empty house with a pile of clothes in the garage was unthinkable.\n\nTaking a deep, steadying breath that did nothing to calm her, she walked to the hallway table. Her invisible hand reached out and picked up the receiver, which then floated eerily in the air. \"Vance,\" she said, and was shocked by how normal her voice sounded.\n\"Guv? It's Sameer. You okay? You're never late.\" Chopra. Of course. His voice was a mixture of surprise and genuine concern.\n\"Chopra,\" she rasped, deliberately roughening her voice, making it sound clogged and sick. \"Yeah. Sorry. Woke up feeling like I'd been run over by a bus. Some kind of bug. Stomach, head\u2026 the works.\" It was her first lie. The first stone laid in the foundation of her new, hidden existence.\n\"Oh, right. Blimey. Is it that thing that's been going around? Half of admin are off with it. Do you need anything? I can drop off some supplies after my shift.\" The puppy, loyal to the last. The kindness was a knife in her gut.\n\"No,\" she said, too quickly. \"No, don't. It's\u2026 explosive. Trust me, you want to maintain a five-mile exclusion zone. I'm going to turn my phone off and try to sleep it off. I'll check in tomorrow.\"\n\"Okay, guv. Hope you feel better soon. Davies is going to be chuffed about the Gazza arrest, by the way. The Super's already emailed about it.\"\n\"Good,\" she croaked. \"That's good.\" She hung up, placing the handset back on its cradle with a hand that trembled invisibly. The receiver settled into place, and the connection to her old life was severed.\n\nShe had done it. She had bought herself time. A day, maybe two. The relief was a thin, brittle skin over a vast emptiness. She slid down the wall, her towel-wrapped form slumping to the floor in a way that would have looked utterly bizarre to an observer. The job. Davies, Chopra, the Gazza arrest. It all felt like it had happened to someone else, in another lifetime. Her entire career, her identity, was built on presence, on being seen. On the authority she projected when she walked into an interview room, the reassuring glance she could give a victim, the intimidating stare that could break a suspect. All of it, gone. She couldn\u2019t walk into her office, couldn\u2019t chair a briefing, couldn\u2019t testify in court. DCI Eleanor Vance, as the world knew her, had ceased to exist. The job that had consumed everything else in her life was now the one thing that was utterly, completely impossible for her to do.\n\nAnd then, a thought, insidious and strange, surfaced through the mire of her despair. She looked at the mantelpiece, at the photo of her and Graham, smiling on a beach in Cornwall. She thought of the endless meetings, the budget cuts, the stifling bureaucracy. She thought of Davies and his political games, of the weary ache in her bones after a thankless sixteen-hour day. All of that was gone, too. The constant pressure to be DCI Vance, the unblinking eye of the force, the woman who had sacrificed everything for the job. She was free from it. Not just from the duties, but from the scrutiny. No one was watching her anymore. No one *could* watch her. It was a horrifying, terrifying, and profoundly lonely kind of freedom. The freedom of a ghost, adrift in her own life, with no rules and no one to answer to. Shivering there on the floor, a disembodied consciousness draped in a bath towel, Ellie Vance began to wonder if her life had just ended, or if it had, in some terrible and incomprehensible way, just begun.The thought of freedom was a dangerous, seductive whisper in the roaring silence of her mind. For twenty-five years, she had been a public servant in the most literal sense; her face known to every villain and beat cop in the Black Country, her life forfeit to the relentless demands of the job. Now, she was the ultimate private citizen. More than private. She was a secret. The idea was so potent it was almost physically painful. She could walk anywhere, go anywhere, listen to anything. She was the perfect surveillance machine. The ultimate undercover officer. The thought was immediately followed by a wave of self-loathing. Was that really her first instinct? To weaponise her own affliction for the job that had already taken everything from her? The irony was so bitter it tasted like bile.\n\nSlowly, she got to her feet, the towel clutched around her waist. The house was cold and her stomach was a tight knot of hunger and anxiety. Food. She needed food. The journey to the kitchen was an exercise in navigating by memory and touch alone. She ran an invisible hand along the cool surface of the kitchen counter, her fingers finding the handle of the fridge. Inside, the light flickered on, illuminating the contents. A half-empty bottle of milk, some wilting lettuce, a sad-looking block of cheddar. It looked like the fridge of a person who didn\u2019t live here. She reached for the milk, her brain calculating the position of her hand with unnerving accuracy. The bottle lifted, suspended in the air, and she carried it to the counter, her movements slow and deliberate, like a bomb disposal expert.\n\nMaking a simple cup of tea and a cheese sandwich became the most complex and mentally taxing operation of her life. She had to trust her proprioception, the body\u2019s innate sense of its position in space, to a degree she had never imagined. She found a mug by touch, placed a teabag in it by faith, and held it under the kettle\u2019s spout, praying she had the angle right. The click of the boiling kettle was a gunshot in the quiet room. Pouring the water was terrifying; she had to rely entirely on the sound of the filling mug and the increasing weight in her unseen hand. She ended up with scalding water splashed across her spectral knuckles, the pain a sharp, welcome confirmation of her own reality. The sandwich was a similar ordeal. The knife floated, slicing through the cheese. The bread seemed to butter itself. She ate standing by the counter, forcing down the dry bread and tasteless cheese, acutely aware that she couldn't see her own mouth, couldn't watch her own hands. It was the loneliest meal she had ever eaten.\n\nAfter the ghost of a breakfast, she made her way to the small study. Her laptop sat on the desk, closed. Here was a window. A way to reach out into the world without being seen, a tool she already used to exist at a distance. She sat down, the office chair sighing under her weight, and opened the screen. Her fingers, guided by decades of muscle memory, found the home keys on the keyboard. She opened a browser, the screen\u2019s light bathing a patch of empty air. For a moment she just stared at the search bar, the blinking cursor a tiny, rhythmic pulse of infinite possibility and utter hopelessness. What could she possibly type?\n\n\u2018Human body becomes transparent\u2019. \u2018Spontaneous invisibility\u2019. \u2018Sudden cellular translucency\u2019. The search results were a predictable cascade of science fiction tropes, crank medical theories from the dark corners of the internet, and forum posts from people who believed they could astral project. There was nothing scientific, nothing medical, nothing real. She spent an hour diving down rabbit holes, reading about quantum entanglement, military cloaking technology, and obscure neurological conditions that affected self-perception, but none of them fit. They were disorders of the mind, not the flesh. Her mind was horribly, terrifyingly lucid. It was her body that had staged the coup. The silence from the legitimate world was deafening. There were no case studies, no research papers, no bewildered articles in medical journals. Whatever this was, it was happening to her and her alone. She was a medical anomaly of one.\n\nThe sound of the letterbox clattering shut made her jump so violently the chair squeaked. Footsteps crunched on the gravel path outside, then receded down the street. The post. A bill, a takeaway menu, a circular. A dispatch from a world that was still running on time, a world where people were visible and paid their gas bills and ordered pizza. She crept to the front door and peered through the spyhole. The street was empty save for a neighbour from three doors down, wrestling his recycling bin to the kerb. He paused to stretch his back, wincing, utterly oblivious to the invisible woman watching him from behind the door. The sheer, unbridgeable chasm between their two realities was dizzying. He had a bad back. She had no body. They were living in different universes, separated by a pane of glass and a few feet of air.\n\nShe sank to the floor again, the sheer weight of her solitude pressing down on her. The house, once a sterile sanctuary from the chaos of her job, had become a prison. She was trapped. She could order groceries online, she supposed, have them left on the doorstep. She could live here, in the quiet and the dark, a ghost haunting the rooms of her own life, until her money ran out or her mind finally fractured. But as she sat there, her gaze drifted towards the hallway, towards the closed door of the garage. Behind it, leaning in the corner, was her golf bag. The thought of the golf course, the wide open green under a vast sky, was a sudden, desperate craving. The clean, uncomplicated physics of it. Out there, in the dark, her invisibility wouldn't be a curse. It would be an advantage. No one would see the odd-looking woman practicing her swing at two in the morning. No one would see her at all. The idea took root, a small, defiant weed pushing up through the concrete of her despair. She couldn't be DCI Vance. She couldn't even be Ellie Vance. But maybe, just maybe, she could be a golfer.## Chapter 3\n\nThe day was the longest of her life. A sentence served in ten-hour increments, measured by the slow march of sunlight across the living room carpet. She was a phantom in a diorama of her own life, watching the world through glass. She saw her neighbour\u2019s children leave for school, their shouts and laughter like sounds from another planet. She saw an Amazon delivery van pull up, the driver jogging to the door opposite with a parcel, his movements full of a casual, unthinking visibility that she now envied with a burning intensity. She did not turn on the television or the radio. The thought of hearing about the world\u2014about crimes, about politics, about the weather over Walsall\u2014felt like listening to a report from a country from which she had been permanently exiled. The silence was a presence, broken only by the hum of the fridge and the frantic, looping monologue in her own head.\n\nAs dusk began to blur the edges of the day, the passive agony of waiting solidified into a hard, cold resolve. The golf course. The thought had become an obsession, a focal point in the swirling chaos of her new reality. It was no longer about solace; it was about action. A test. An experiment to see if she could function in this new state, or if she was doomed to haunt the two floors of her semi-detached house until she went mad. A plan, police-like in its pragmatism, began to form. She couldn't carry the clubs; the sight of a floating golf bag trotting down the street would guarantee a call to every news outlet in the country. But in the back of the garage, behind the lawnmower, was an old, collapsible pull-trolley she hadn't used in years. She could push it. At two in the morning, a self-propelled golf trolley would be strange, yes, but far less strange than a levitating one. It was a flimsy plan, a desperate gamble, but it was infinitely better than doing nothing.\n\nWhen the streetlights had been on for hours and the last glow of television sets had blinked out from her neighbours\u2019 windows, she began her preparations. The garage was like a tomb, the air frigid against her bare skin as she wrestled the stiff, dusty trolley from its resting place and strapped her bag to it with trembling, invisible hands. The most difficult part was the final act of leaving. She stood in her hallway, utterly naked, her hand on the front door latch. Every instinct, every ingrained habit of a lifetime screamed at the sheer, insane vulnerability of it. To step outside, stripped not just of her clothes but of her very image, felt like a greater violation than any she had ever faced. But the alternative, the endless, silent waiting in the house, was a kind of death. She took a breath that felt like it was drawn from the bottom of a well, turned the lock, and pushed the door open into the cold, damp night.\n\nThe world outside was a sensory assault. The rough, uneven surface of the pavement was a shock of texture against the soft soles of her feet. She flinched as she stepped into a shallow puddle, the icy water a sudden, sharp pain. The air, heavy with the smell of wet tarmac and decaying leaves, moved against her skin, a constant, ghostly caress. She pushed the trolley before her, its wheels making a soft, rhythmic rumble on the pavement that sounded deafening to her own ears. Cars passed, their headlights sweeping the street, and she froze each time, her heart hammering. The beams passed through the space she occupied, illuminating the privet hedge behind her, and for a moment, she was nothing more than a distortion in the air, a place where the light did not reflect. She was a hole in the world, pushing a set of golf clubs.\n\nShe had been walking for nearly twenty minutes, sticking to the shadows, when she heard the jingle of a dog collar and the soft tread of trainers. A man in a tracksuit, head down, phone glowing in his hand, was walking a small Jack Russell. There was nowhere to hide. Ellie froze, flattening herself against a brick garden wall, her hand clamped over the handle of the trolley to keep it still. The man walked past, oblivious, but the dog stopped. It planted its front paws, a low whine building in its throat, its nose twitching as it stared directly at the spot where Ellie stood. The man tugged the lead. \"Come on, Buster, there's nothing there. Just a fox, probably.\" The dog resisted, letting out a short, sharp bark, its small body taut with a primal sense of wrongness. For a terrifying second, Ellie was sure the man would look closer, would see the trolley that seemed to have stopped of its own accord. But he just sighed, gave a harder tug, and pulled the reluctant animal away. \"Stupid mutt.\" Ellie didn't breathe again until they had rounded the corner, the sound of the dog\u2019s whining fading into the night. She had been seen. Not by human eyes, but seen all the same.\n\nThe Walsall Municipal Golf Club was a dark, sprawling shape against the slightly less dark sky. Its main gates were padlocked, a heavy chain looped through the bars. In her old life, she could have flashed a warrant card or simply called the groundskeeper. Now, she was just another trespasser. She pushed the trolley along the perimeter fence, the wire humming faintly in the breeze. About fifty yards down, where the fence met a thicket of overgrown brambles, the wire was bent and loose at the bottom, pulled up by years of teenagers looking for a shortcut. It was a narrow, muddy gap. With a grimace, she crouched down, the wet earth cold and slimy beneath her invisible knees, and shoved the trolley through first. Then, with a grunt of effort and a scratch from a thorny branch across a shoulder she could not see, she squirmed through after it. She was in. An intruder on her own sanctuary.\n\nThe course was a transformed world. The familiar, friendly undulations of the fairways were now rolling seas of blackness under the weak moonlight. The sand traps were pale, ghostly hollows. The silence was profound, broken only by the whisper of the wind in the tall pines that lined the first hole and the soft rumble of her trolley on the manicured grass. It was eerie, but it was also peaceful. Here, there were no houses, no passing cars, no dogs to sense her presence. She felt the knot of tension in her chest loosen, just a fraction. She pulled the trolley to the first tee box, the flat, elevated ground feeling like a stage. Her stage.\n\nShe went through the ritual with a reverent slowness, her movements precise in the dark. She bent down, her unseen fingers pushing a wooden tee into the damp turf. She placed a ball on it, the dimpled white sphere seeming to glow in the gloom. She pulled her driver from the bag, the familiar weight of it in her hand a comfort and a promise. She took her stance, her bare feet planted firmly on the dew-slicked grass. She could feel the subtle shift of her weight, the tension in her thighs, the coil of her back. She didn't need to see her alignment; her body knew the geometry of this motion better than it knew anything else. For a single, crystal-clear moment, the terror, the confusion, the sheer, crushing impossibility of her situation, all fell away. There was only the ball, the club, and the clean, dark arc of the swing she was about to make.\n\nShe drew the club back, a smooth, practiced motion, and then unleashed a lifetime of frustration, rage, and grief into the downswing. The impact was perfect. Not a thud, but a sharp, clean *crack* that shattered the silence of the night like a gunshot. The force of it resonated up the shaft of the club, a jolt of pure energy that sang through her invisible hands and arms. She couldn't see the ball, but she didn't need to. She felt its trajectory, knew from the sound and the feel that it was soaring, straight and true, down the centre of the fairway, a tiny missile fired into the heart of the darkness. The echo of the shot died away, leaving a silence more profound than before. She stood there, holding her finishing pose, her invisible face turned towards the unseen flight of the ball. In that moment, she was not DCI Vance, the burnt-out cop. She was not the terrified ghost in the machine. She was power. She was purpose. She was a zero-handicap phantom, and she had just hit a perfect drive.The perfect drive. The perfect feeling. But it lasted only a moment. The glorious, singing vibration in her hands faded, and she was left standing in the dark, the cold seeping back into her bare feet. The sound of the shot had been huge, a declaration of her existence, but the silence that swallowed it was a reminder of her utter isolation. A perfect drive into an empty void. She was still naked, still invisible, still trapped in a nightmare from which there was no waking. The brief illusion of control shattered, leaving only the cold, hard facts. She let the driver drop, its unseen fall ending with a soft thud on the grass. The urge to just lie down on the damp turf and let the cold take her was immense, a siren song of surrender. But the same stubborn grit that had carried her through twenty-five years of police work, the refusal to simply give up, sparked again, small and weak, but there. She had hit the ball. She would find it.\n\nShe grabbed the handle of the trolley, the cold metal a familiar shock, and began to walk. The feel of the close-cropped fairway under her bare feet was strange, a sensation of both softness and damp resistance. Every step was an act of faith. She walked the centre line, her eyes scanning the darkness ahead, her memory of the shot her only guide. The moon broke through the clouds for a moment, casting the landscape in a weak, silvery light. The fairway stretched out like a pale ribbon between the black masses of the rough. And there, almost exactly where she had pictured it, was a tiny white speck. Her ball. It sat perched perfectly on the grass, a small, solid point of order in a chaotic universe. Finding it felt like a monumental victory, a confirmation that her judgment, her senses, were still sound. It was proof that even if she couldn't see herself, she could still accurately impose her will upon the world.\n\nReaching the ball, she stood over it for a moment. 150 yards to the pin, maybe less. A gentle seven-iron. She pulled the club from the bag, the cool steel of the shaft a comforting weight. She went through her pre-shot routine automatically, a series of small, precise movements honed by a thousand Saturdays. It was a ritual, and the familiar rhythm of it was profoundly calming. There was no conscious thought, just muscle memory. The swing was shorter this time, more controlled. The click of impact was less dramatic than the driver, a crisp, satisfying *thwack* that sent the ball on a high, graceful arc towards the green. She watched its ghost-white path against the dark sky until it disappeared somewhere near the pin. The simple, repeatable physics of it was a balm. Problem, analysis, execution, result. It was the core of her old job, stripped of all the human misery.\n\nAs she pushed her trolley towards the green, the first glimmer of a new idea began to form. This wasn't just an escape. It was training. She was learning to operate this new version of herself, calibrating her senses, trusting her instincts in a way she never had before. She was learning to navigate the world as a disembodied force. The thought was still terrifying, but it now contained a sliver of something else: potential. The green was a darker circle of velvet. She found her ball ten feet from the hole. A solid approach. The putt was a formality, her focus absolute. She crouched, reading a non-existent break in the gloom, and stroked the ball with the face of her putter. It rolled smooth and true, dropping into the cup with a soft, final clatter. A birdie on the first hole, naked, in the middle of the night, while being completely invisible. She didn't feel triumphant. She just felt\u2026 quiet. The hole was done. The problem was solved. But the course had seventeen more holes, and her life had countless empty days stretching out ahead. What now?\n\nIt was as she was walking towards the second tee that she saw it. A light. A single, yellow square of light shining from the small groundskeeper's cottage, tucked away behind a copse of silver birch trees near the ninth green. Angus McBain. The head groundskeeper. A craggy, solitary Scotsman who was as much a feature of the course as the ancient oak by the seventh fairway. He sometimes stayed over after a long day, preferring the quiet of the course to his small flat in town. In her old life, she\u2019d shared a flask of tea with him a few times during an early weekend round. Now, his light was a beacon of another existence, a sudden, jarring reminder that she was not alone out here. And with that reminder came a new, cold impulse, born not of a golfer\u2019s focus but of a detective's curiosity. She could go over there. She could walk right up to the window. She could look inside, and he would never, ever know. The thought was chilling, a violation, a trespass far more profound than just being on the course. It was a test of a different kind of nerve. The ghost was about to learn how to haunt.## Chapter 4\n\nThe decision was not a conscious one. It was an impulse, a magnetic pull as strong and instinctive as a flinch from fire. One moment she was a golfer, contemplating her next shot; the next, she was a hunter, abandoning her game and her trolley in the deep shadow of a cypress tree. The cottage light was a solitary star in her personal darkness, and she was drawn to it. She moved with a newfound stealth, her bare feet silent on the soft grass. The skills she\u2019d honed over years of surveillance\u2014moving quietly, using cover, judging sight lines\u2014came back to her not as trained techniques but as pure instinct. She skirted the edge of the ninth fairway, keeping a line of trees between herself and the cottage, her body a column of cold air moving through the night. The thrill of it was shameful and undeniable, a cold burn of adrenaline that had nothing to do with chasing suspects and everything to do with the raw, illicit power of her condition.\n\nShe reached the small, manicured garden that surrounded the cottage and crouched behind a fragrant rhododendron bush, its waxy leaves cool against her invisible skin. The window was a perfect, brightly lit diorama. Angus McBain was inside, his back to her. He was a man carved from oak, with a shock of white hair and shoulders bowed by decades of physical labour. His small kitchen was tidy and worn; a pot of soup bubbled on the stove, and a half-finished crossword lay on the small wooden table. Ellie watched as he methodically buttered a slice of bread, his movements economical and sure. He was utterly engrossed in the simple task, a man at peace in his small kingdom. The scene was so profoundly normal, so deeply human, that it hurt to look at. It was a life. A quiet, simple, visible life.\n\nThe DCI in her noted the details: the brand of whisky on the side, the worn spine of the book by his chair, the way he favoured his left leg slightly. But the woman, the ghost outside the glass, felt a pang of loneliness so sharp it was a physical ache. She was watching a life being lived, and she was no longer a participant. She was merely a spectator, a phantom presence at the feast. She saw him turn and pick up a small, framed photograph from the countertop. He looked at it for a long moment, his gruff features softening into something tender, something sad. He murmured something too low for her to hear, then placed the photo back down with a quiet reverence. In that instant, the power she felt vanished, replaced by a crushing sense of her own transgression. This was not a clue. This was not evidence. This was a man's private grief, a moment of unguarded intimacy, and she was stealing it. She was no better than a voyeur, a ghoul peering into a window, her affliction a skeleton key to doors she had no right to open.\n\nA floorboard creaked inside the cottage. Angus startled, turning his head sharply towards the window. His eyes, pale and fierce, seemed to stare directly into hers. Ellie froze, her blood turning to ice. Her heart hammered against ribs he could not see, a frantic drumbeat in the silent garden. He was looking right at her. It was impossible, but he was. His gaze was fixed on the space she occupied, his head tilted as if listening for a sound that wasn't there. For ten, twenty, thirty seconds, he stood motionless, a hunter sensing a disturbance in the woods. Ellie held her breath until her lungs burned, convinced that somehow, through some primal instinct, he knew. She could imagine the headlines: \u2018Naked Invisible Policewoman Discovered by Perceptive Scottish Groundskeeper\u2019. Then, as slowly as he had tensed, he relaxed. He shook his head, a small, dismissive gesture, and turned back to his soup. It was a draught, a trick of the light, an old man\u2019s nerves. He hadn\u2019t seen her. He couldn\u2019t have.\n\nShe backed away from the window, her retreat slow and deliberate until she was swallowed by the darkness of the trees. The adrenaline drained away, leaving her hollowed out and shaking. The thrill was gone, replaced by a sour taste of shame. What had she been thinking? What had she hoped to find? A clue to her condition? An answer? There were no answers in another man\u2019s kitchen. There was only more proof of the chasm that had opened up between her and the rest of the human race. She found her trolley where she had left it, the clubs glinting dully in the weak moonlight. The desire to play was gone, the clean physics of the game now tainted by the messy, complicated trespass she had just committed. The course no longer felt like a sanctuary. It felt like a hunting ground, and she was no longer sure if she was the hunter or the prey.\n\nThe journey home was a blur of self-recrimination. Each rumble of the trolley wheels on the pavement sounded like an accusation. She had used her condition not for survival, but for a cheap, intrusive thrill. She had crossed a line, and she knew it. It was the kind of line she had spent her entire career defending. By the time she slipped back through her own front door, the first birds were beginning to sing, heralding a dawn she felt she hadn't earned. She was back in her prison, but the nature of the prison had changed. It wasn\u2019t just the house anymore; it was her own invisible skin. As she stood shivering in her hallway, she understood a new, terrible truth. The greatest danger she faced wasn't discovery. It wasn't loneliness or madness or starvation. The greatest danger was what she might become, now that no one was watching. The old Ellie Vance, the DCI with a rigid moral code, was gone. And the ghost that remained was free to write its own rules.The shame was a physical sensation, a cold, greasy film on her invisible skin that the pre-dawn chill couldn't touch. Back in the sterile silence of her hallway, the mud from the golf course fence was a tangible reminder of her transgression. She had crawled through the dirt, both literally and figuratively. The clean, soaring arc of her golf shots felt like a memory from a different life, a moment of purity that only served to highlight the sordid nature of what came after. Crouching in a stranger\u2019s garden, stealing a glimpse of his private grief\u2014it was a squalid little act, the kind of pathetic intrusion she\u2019d once scorned in low-level informants and gossiping neighbours. She was a Peeping Tom. A ghost at the window. The power she had felt for a fleeting moment was nothing more than the grubby thrill of the voyeur.\n\nShe made her way to the bathroom, avoiding the mirror as if it might somehow see her despite the evidence. The shower was scalding hot this time, a punishment. She scrubbed at her spectral skin with a ferocity that bordered on self-harm, trying to wash away the feeling of Angus McBain's sad, unknowing eyes. As the water sluiced over her, she thought about the dog, Buster. The animal had known. It hadn't seen her, but it had sensed the wrongness, the hole in the pattern of the world where she stood. It was a sobering thought. She was not entirely undetectable. She was a disturbance, a ripple. And if a dog could sense her, what else could? The thought was a new and unwelcome thread in the tapestry of her fear.\n\nDrying herself with a rough towel, the familiar motions a small comfort, she felt a subtle shift in her thinking. The raw panic was being replaced by something else, something colder and more familiar: professional anger. She was a DCI. Her life\u2019s work was about imposing order on chaos, finding answers in the dark. For two days she had been floundering, a victim of circumstance. No more. This was not a medical crisis or a supernatural curse to be endured. This was a case. The case. And she was the lead investigator. The shame from the garden began to recede, burned away by the icy fire of purpose. Spying on Angus had been a mistake, an undisciplined, emotional act. She would not make that mistake again. From now on, every action would have a purpose. Every risk would be calculated. The objective was no longer to survive, but to understand.\n\nClad in a floating fleece dressing gown, she went to her study and sat before her laptop. Her previous, desperate searches for \u2018spontaneous invisibility\u2019 now seemed amateurish, the work of a panicked civilian. She was not a civilian. She pushed aside the public internet and navigated to a bookmarked portal, her fingers flying across the keyboard to type in a long, complex password that gave her remote access to the West Midlands Police HOLMES database. The Home Office Large Major Enquiry System. It was the brain of the force, a vast, interconnected repository of every crime, statement, and piece of evidence from thousands of cases. She wasn't looking for a crime. She was looking for the gaps, the loose threads, the reports that went nowhere. Every force had them: the 'Misper' (Missing Person) report where someone vanished from a locked room; the oddball witness statement about a \"man who wasn't there\"; the burglaries with no signs of forced entry. These were the files that got marked \u2018NFAR\u2019 \u2013 No Further Action Required \u2013 and were buried under the weight of more urgent, more violent, more understandable crimes. They were the force\u2019s collection of ghost stories, and she was about to become their most dedicated reader.\n\nThe hours bled into one another as she fell down a rabbit hole of official strangeness. She bypassed the obvious crank calls and filtered for credible witnesses\u2014other cops, paramedics, sober professionals. She found a report from a traffic cop in Coventry who swore a car had swerved to avoid something he couldn't see. She found a witness statement from a terrified homeowner in Solihull who claimed to have heard an intruder and felt a cold spot pass by him, but the only thing missing was a single, sentimental photograph from his mantelpiece. Each report was a dead end, a tiny, isolated mystery. But as she cross-referenced dates, locations, and keywords, a faint, almost imperceptible pattern began to emerge. A cluster of low-level, inexplicable events dotted across the West Midlands over the past eighteen months. It was nothing concrete, nothing she could ever have presented in a briefing. It was just a faint statistical shimmer, a whisper in the data. But it was more than she\u2019d had before. She was not the first ripple. There were others.\n\nThe realisation brought a new, urgent need. She had to know the parameters of her own condition. The dog had sensed her. Angus had felt something. She was a physical object, subject to thermodynamics. She had a heat signature. The thought clicked into place with the force of a revelation. Thermal imaging. The force had Forward-Looking Infrared (FLIR) cameras, expensive pieces of kit used for night-time surveillance, for finding fugitives hiding in the woods, for spotting cannabis farms from the air. She needed to look at herself through one of those cameras. And she knew exactly where one was. It was stored in a locked cabinet in the Technical Surveillance Unit on the third floor of Walsall Central Police Station. Her station. The place she was supposed to be running. The irony was a physical blow. To investigate her own disappearance, she would have to break into her own office. The ghost would not just haunt; she would have to become a thief, stealing from the very institution she had given her life to. The moral line she had crossed in Angus\u2019s garden was nothing compared to the one she was now preparing to obliterate.The moral compass of DCI Eleanor Vance, which had spun wildly in the storm of her new reality, now clicked into a fixed, chilling direction. North. The shame she\u2019d felt in Angus McBain\u2019s garden had not been exorcised; it had been analysed, processed, and repurposed. It was now a cold, hard data point demonstrating the unacceptable risks of unstructured, emotional action. What she had done in the groundskeeper's garden was sloppy and unprofessional. Breaking into her own police station, however, would be the opposite. It would be a calculated, precise, and necessary operation. She framed it in the language of her profession, a cognitive trick to keep the sheer criminality of the act at bay. This was not a break-in; it was a covert evidence-gathering exercise. She was not a burglar; she was an undercover officer on the deepest, most dangerous assignment of her life, and she had to be prepared to bend the rules to get results. The target wasn't her employer; it was an unknown adversary who had stolen her very form, and the station held the one tool that might let her see its face.\n\nThe DCI was gone, but her mind remained. She spent the rest of the day in a state of focused deprivation, fasting to keep her senses sharp, her thoughts clear. In her study, with a notepad she couldn\u2019t see herself write on, she sketched the layout of Walsall Central from memory. She knew the building better than her own house. She listed every CCTV camera, noting their fields of vision and their blind spots. She mapped the predictable patrol routes of the two night-duty officers and cross-referenced them with the cleaning crew's schedule. The station was a fortress she had helped run, and now she was drawing up the siege plans. The primary obstacle was entry. The main public entrance was a non-starter, monitored constantly. But the rear loading bay, used for deliveries and prisoner transport, offered a sliver of a possibility. The heavy roller door was automated, but the adjacent staff entrance was often propped open with a wedge by the contract cleaners during their shift, which started at a brutally early 4 a.m. One of the night-duty PCs, a young officer named Meadows, was always assigned to the ground floor, but his routine was gospel: a full circuit every thirty minutes, with a long stop in the main-floor kitchenette for a pot of tea and a browse of the sports pages at precisely 4:15. This created a window. A narrow, high-risk window, but a window nonetheless.\n\nThe next problem was the Technical Surveillance Unit itself. The TSU was on the third floor, behind another keycard-locked door. Her own card was in her wallet on the bedside table, a useless sliver of plastic. She couldn't simply tailgate a cleaner; they didn't have that level of access. Here, however, her rank and experience provided a potential key. She knew something only a handful of senior officers would know. The physical master keys, the override set for every office on a single floor, were kept in a small, grey lockbox next to the fire warden's station in the stairwell. The four-digit code for that box was not changed weekly, as official policy dictated. It was the station\u2019s original incident-response call sign from the 1980s, a piece of institutional trivia she had once used to quiz new sergeants. It was a long shot, a gamble on bureaucratic laziness, but it was the most viable option she had.\n\nAs the town\u2019s clocks ticked past 3 a.m., she began her final preparations. There would be no impulsive nakedness this time, no vulnerable bare feet on the cold ground. This was a tactical operation. She dressed in the darkest, most close-fitting clothing she owned: black yoga leggings and a long-sleeved black top. They would still be visible, a floating set of clothes moving through the dark, but her hope was that in the confusing reflections and deep shadows of the station's corridors, they might be dismissed as a trick of the eye, a discarded uniform on a chair, anything but what they actually were. She pulled on soft-soled trainers, their laces tied by a combination of muscle memory and sheer faith. She left the house as she had the night before, a ghost slipping out into the sleeping world. But this time there was no golf trolley, no destination of leisure. Her route was direct, her steps silent and filled with purpose. The two-mile walk to the town centre was a gauntlet of orange-tinted streetlights and the occasional sweep of headlights from a passing taxi or delivery van. She moved like a creature of the night, from the black shadow of one building to the next, her heart a cold, steady drum against her invisible ribs. She was DCI Eleanor Vance, and she was going to work.\n\nShe arrived opposite the station at 3:50 a.m., melting into the unlit doorway of a closed-down bakery. The building was a familiar monolith, its windows dark save for a few random squares of light on the upper floors where the 24/7 units operated. It looked inert, sleeping, but she knew the truth. It was a living organism, humming with electricity, data, and the quiet vigilance of the night shift. At 4:02, a battered Ford Fiesta pulled into the staff car park and two women in the blue tabards of a commercial cleaning company got out, laughing at some shared joke. Her pulse quickened. They disappeared around the back of the building. Ellie counted the seconds, her eyes fixed on the corner they had turned. Five minutes passed. Ten. At 4:13, she saw the unmistakable silhouette of PC Meadows amble past a ground-floor window, heading towards the kitchenette. It was time. She broke cover, a moving patch of darkness flitting across the deserted road. She reached the rear of the building and peered around the corner. The staff door was propped open with a red rubber wedge. Her plan had survived first contact with reality. Taking a final, steadying breath, Eleanor Vance, or what was left of her, slipped inside the lion's den.\n\nThe air inside was a shock, a familiar assault of old coffee, industrial-grade disinfectant, and the faint, underlying metallic tang of stress. She was in a concrete corridor that led from the loading bay to the main building. Her heart was a frantic bird in a cage she couldn't see. She moved silently, her trainers making no sound on the polished linoleum, a pair of black leggings and a top gliding through the empty space. She reached the main ground-floor corridor and paused, pressing herself into the alcove by the vending machines. In the distance, she could hear the clink of a spoon against a mug. Meadows was making his tea. She moved in the opposite direction, towards the stairwell. The keycard reader next to the stairwell door was a blank, impassive sentinel. She waited. Her wait was rewarded two minutes later by one of the cleaners, pushing a rattling janitorial cart. The woman swiped her card without breaking stride, the lock beeped green, and she pushed the door open. Ellie seized the moment, slipping through the gap just as the door began to hiss shut behind the cleaner. She was in.\n\nShe let the cleaner go up ahead, the rattling of her cart a useful cover for any tiny sound Ellie might make. On the third-floor landing, the cleaner turned right, towards the main office bullpen. Ellie turned left, into the silent, dimmer corridor that housed the specialist units. The fire warden\u2019s station was exactly where she remembered it, a small red box and a grey metal lockbox bolted to the wall. Her invisible fingers, trembling slightly, found the four small dials of the combination lock. She entered the old call sign: 8-4-7-1. She pulled the latch. It clicked open. Relief washed over her, so potent it almost buckled her knees. Inside, hanging on a small hook, was a single, brass-coloured key. The master.\n\nThe TSU office was twenty feet down the corridor. The key slid into the lock with a well-oiled smoothness. She turned it, the click of the tumblers deafening in the silence. She pushed the door open, slipped inside, and closed it gently behind her, leaving the key in the lock. The room was a tech-lover's paradise, crammed with servers, monitors, and shelves of esoteric equipment. And against the far wall stood a bank of grey metal charging cabinets. The second one from the left was labelled 'FLIR'. It was locked with a simple cabinet lock. Her luck had run out. But a DCI's luck is often self-made. She scanned the cluttered desks. On one, next to a diagram of a mobile phone jammer, was a small tray of loose change, paperclips, and a tiny, thin-bladed screwdriver from a Christmas cracker toolkit. It was flimsy, but it might be enough. She knelt by the cabinet, her heart in her throat, and inserted the tip of the screwdriver into the cheap lock. She twisted gently, feeling for the pins, a skill she'd picked up from a retired cat burglar she\u2019d once interviewed. There was a soft, pathetic snap, and the lock gave way.\n\nShe pulled open the cabinet door. Inside, nestled in custom-cut foam, was a thermal imaging camera. It looked like a prop from a science-fiction film, all black composite plastic and a large, ominous-looking lens. It was heavier than she expected. With the reverence of an archaeologist finding a sacred relic, she lifted it out. She found an empty interview room two doors down, the sort of soulless, grey box where she had spent thousands of hours breaking down the lies of others. Now she was here to find the truth about herself. She stood in the middle of the room, the camera in her unseen hands. She flicked the power switch. The device hummed to life, a small screen on the back flickering on. It showed the room in a ghostly palette of blues and purples, the lingering warmth of a computer monitor a splash of faint yellow. With a hand that shook uncontrollably, she turned the lens around, pointing it directly at the empty space where her face should be. She held her breath and looked at the screen.## Chapter 5\n\nThe screen was a swirling chaos of deep blues and purples, the ambient cold of the interview room rendered in a ghostly palette. And in the centre of it, a miracle of horror. A perfect, incandescent human silhouette. It blazed with heat, a fiery ghost of orange, yellow, and red, stark and undeniable against the cold background. It was her. The heat of her own blood, the warmth of her own skin, translated into a language of light she could finally see. It was the most beautiful and the most monstrous thing she had ever witnessed. A strangled sob, utterly silent to the outside world, escaped her. She was there. The data proved it. The thermal signature of a 5' 9\" woman, solid and whole and alive, stood in the middle of Interview Room 3.\n\nShe raised a hand. The glowing shape on the screen raised a hand. The fingers, rendered in tapering shades from hot orange to cooler yellow at the tips, flexed in perfect synchrony with her own. She traced the outline of her jaw, and on the screen, the fiery ghost mimicked the motion, a hand of light caressing a face of flame. For the first time in days, she was looking at herself. It wasn't the tired, fretful face of DCI Vance, but a more fundamental truth. This was the living, breathing engine beneath the surface, the thermal signature of a life in progress. The image held no judgment, bore no silvery scar from a misplaced bread knife or ache from a decade-old knee injury. It was just heat. It was just life. And it was hers.\n\nShe zoomed in, the detective's need for detail overriding the awe. The heat was distributed as she would expect: a brighter core in the torso and head, cooler tones in the extremities. Everything was normal. Except\u2026 she tilted the camera, focusing on the blazing corona that represented her head. In the very centre of her forehead, there was a small, perfectly circular void. It was not red or yellow. It was a patch of the deepest, coldest indigo, a tiny black hole in the galaxy of her own heat. It was no bigger than a ten-pence piece, but it was absolute. A dead spot. A zone of impossible cold where warmth and life should have been. Her finger, the real one, went to her forehead. She felt nothing unusual. The skin was warm to her own touch, the bone solid beneath. But the camera did not lie. It was a piece of data that made no sense, a flaw in the code of her own biology, a chilling asterisk next to the proof of her existence.\n\nA distant clang of a metal door broke the spell. Footsteps, brisk and official, echoed down the main corridor. Meadows. His break was over. Panic, cold and sharp, lanced through her. She powered down the camera, the image of the fiery ghost winking out of existence, leaving her alone in the dark once more. She had to move. Her mind, now a finely tuned machine of risk assessment, clicked through the escape plan. Wipe the camera for prints\u2014a reflex, though a useless one now. Place it back in the cabinet. Prop the broken lock in place, hoping no one would check too closely. The key in the TSU door, retrieve it. Lock the door. Back to the stairwell, replace the master key, spin the dials on the lockbox. Each action was fluid, economical, the work of a professional operating under extreme pressure. She descended the stairs, her heart pounding a syncopated rhythm against the steady tread of a pair of approaching officers. She flattened herself into a fire-extinguisher alcove, making herself small, a void in a recess. Two uniformed constables passed, complaining about the new coffee machine, their voices and solid, visible presence like blows against her fragile composure. The staff door was still propped open. She slipped through it, out of the sterile, conditioned air and into the raw, damp chill of the breaking dawn.\n\nShe didn't stop moving until she was three blocks away, huddled in the darkness of a bus shelter, the plastic smelling of stale cigarettes. She looked back at the station, a dark brick-and-glass mountain against the bruised purple sky. Her fortress. Her life's work. She had violated it, burgled it, treated it like any other target. The invisible woman in the floating black clothes had done what DCI Eleanor Vance would have sent a person to prison for ten years for. She had the information she craved, a single, terrifying image now seared onto the inside of her eyelids: a glowing woman with a hole in her head. But the knowledge had come at a cost. She had crossed a Rubicon, not just morally, but psychologically. She was no longer just hiding from the world; she was actively preying on it. The cold spot on her forehead felt mirrored by a new cold spot in her soul. She turned away from the station and began the long, silent walk home, a ghost returning to her haunt, more alone and more dangerous than when she had left.The walk home was a journey through a world that had become thin and unreal. The rising sun painted the wet streets in washes of pale gold and grey, and the first wave of early commuters began to appear, their faces grimly set for the day ahead. They were solid, opaque, wrapped in their coats and their worries, utterly oblivious to the invisible, law-breaking phantom walking among them. Ellie felt a profound and terrible detachment, as if she were watching a film of a life she used to know. The image from the FLIR camera was burned into her mind's eye, a constant, looping playback of a woman made of fire with a black hole in her head. She kept touching her forehead, a useless, compulsive gesture, seeking a physical confirmation that wasn't there. All she felt was smooth, warm skin, yet she knew with an unshakeable certainty that a spot of impossible cold was clinging to her, a tiny, internal winter that was the source of all this madness. The normal world, with its traffic and its birdsong and its bakery smells, was no longer her world. She was a thing of data and shadow now, and her only home was the sterile silence of the house waiting for her at the end of the street.\n\nOnce inside, she locked and bolted the door with a finality that felt different from the day before. The house was no longer just a prison; it had become her headquarters, a secure facility from which she could wage her silent war. The fear and despair, while still present, had been packed down, compressed by the cold, heavy weight of purpose. She didn't bother with food or drink. She went directly to the study, the floating black dressing gown a bizarre sight in the morning light, and sat down at her laptop. Her previous research felt naive, the flailings of a frightened victim. Now, she was an investigator with a lead. A single, inexplicable clue that defied all known science: the cold spot. It was the fingerprint of the phenomenon, the calling card of whatever had stolen her from the world.\n\nShe began a new, more focused assault on the internet's fortress of knowledge. She abandoned the fantastical search terms and adopted a clinical, scientific vocabulary. \"Focal endothermic biological process.\" \"Spontaneous localized cryo-genesis.\" \"A-thermal cellular necrosis.\" The searches led her into the deepest, most obscure corners of academic research. She read papers on the unique biology of icefish, whose veins ran with natural antifreeze. She skimmed theses on quantum tunnelling and its theoretical macro-scale effects. It was all brilliant, all fascinating, and all utterly useless. Science had no category for a person with a refrigerated forehead who had turned invisible. Frustration mounted, a hot, dry pressure behind her eyes. The answer wasn't in established science. Established science was for a world that followed the rules. Her world had thrown the rulebook into a furnace.\n\nThe thought made her pause. She had been thinking like a scientist. She needed to think like a cop. Cops don't just study the rules; they study the exceptions, the anomalies, the people who break the rules. She opened her remote access to the HOLMES database again, her fingers moving with renewed speed. The Solihull report. The man who felt a cold spot pass by him. It had been a throwaway detail, a piece of atmospheric color in a witness statement. Now, it was everything. She pulled up the full case file on the burglary at the home of Mr. Alistair Finch. It was as thin as she remembered. No witnesses, no forensics, no forced entry. Just an elderly, recently widowed man, a retired watchmaker, who insisted someone had been in his house and stolen a single, specific photograph of his late wife from the mantelpiece. The responding officer had noted Finch was \"distressed but lucid\" and had made a particular point of the cold he had felt, dismissing it as \"likely a draught.\" But Ellie knew better. It wasn't a draught. It was a signature.\n\nThe connection hit her with the force of a physical impact, winding her. The cold spot. The inexplicable burglary. The stolen photograph of a lost loved one. Her own descent had begun after a period of intense, grinding loneliness, a life narrowed to a single, all-consuming point. Mr. Finch was recently widowed. He had lost his other half. A photograph, a memory of a person who was gone, was the only thing taken. It was a pattern, not of a crime, but of a condition. A pattern of profound loss manifesting as a physical disappearance, a fading from a world that no longer felt complete. Was this what happened? Did the universe simply edit you out when a part of you was already gone? The thought was both terrifying and horribly, poetically logical. And if she was right, then Alistair Finch wasn't a victim of a crime she needed to solve. He was either a fellow traveller in this nightmare, another ghost in the machine, or he was something else. He was Patient Zero. The original ripple. She had to find him. Not to arrest him, not to question him as a suspect, but to stand with him, one invisible soul to another, and ask him the only question that now mattered: How did this start, and how in God's name do we make it stop?## Chapter 6\n\nThe transition from a DCI to a full-time conspirator against reality was surprisingly seamless. The same skills applied. Finding Alistair Finch was a matter of simple, illicit procedure. His name and the Solihull address were in the HOLMES file. A further, deeper search using back-end access she was definitely not authorised to use from her living room yielded his date of birth, his NHS number, and a grainy, ten-year-old driving licence photo. He was a small, neat man with kind eyes and the slightly bewildered expression of someone who had just been asked a complicated question. He looked like a grandfather, not a phantom. He looked harmless. But Ellie knew from bitter experience that the most dangerous people were often the ones who looked the most ordinary. The question was, dangerous to whom?\n\nGetting to Solihull was a logistical nightmare that consumed her morning. She couldn\u2019t drive; a driverless car navigating the M6 would attract the wrong kind of attention. Public transport was a terrifying prospect, a chaotic ballet of bodies and bags she would have to navigate by memory and luck. But it was the only way. She dressed again in her black uniform of invisibility, adding a thin, dark beanie hat that floated just above her head, a bizarre halo of anonymity. The bus to Walsall station was an ordeal of sensory overload. The press of bodies she couldn't see but could feel brushing against her, the cacophony of conversations, the smell of cheap perfume and damp coats. She stood rigidly in the designated wheelchair space, a vacant cube of air that people instinctively avoided, praying no one would fall into her.\n\nThe train was worse. She paid for her ticket in cash at a machine, a floating hand feeding notes into a slot, a manoeuvre that left her sweating with anxiety. She found a seat in an almost-empty carriage, but it soon filled up. A young man with headphones sat next to her, his leg occasionally brushing against her own invisible one, each contact a jolt of pure panic. She spent the entire thirty-minute journey to Birmingham New Street holding a newspaper she\u2019d lifted from a stand, holding it up in front of her non-existent face. It was a flimsy shield, a floating rectangle of print that served as a 'do not disturb' sign to the visible world. It was a pathetic piece of camouflage, but it worked. No one tried to take her seat. No one looked too closely at the paper that seemed to be reading itself. People saw what they expected to see, and no one expected to see a ghost commuting.\n\nFrom Birmingham, another train, another bus, and then a long walk through the leafy, affluent suburbs of Solihull. The difference from Walsall was stark. The roads were wide, the houses set back behind manicured lawns and expensive cars. It was a world of comfortable, visible success. Alistair Finch lived on a quiet cul-de-sac in a modest but impeccably maintained semi-detached house, its front garden a riot of perfectly tended roses. It was the house of a man with time on his hands and a deep-seated need for order. It was also the house directly opposite one that was up for sale, its windows vacant, a 'For Sale' sign leaning drunkenly in the overgrown lawn. It was the perfect observation post. A minute of fumbling at the back gate with a paperclip from her pocket\u2014another old trick from the cat burglar\u2014and she was in, slipping through the unlocked patio doors into the dusty, echoing silence of an empty home.\n\nShe set up her vigil in the front bedroom, the air thick with the smell of old carpets and decaying plaster. Through the grimy window, she had a clear, uninterrupted view of Alistair Finch\u2019s front door and living room window. And then she waited. The familiar, soul-crushing boredom of a stakeout settled over her. The only difference was that this time, she was the sole member of the team, and her target was a potentially invisible, retired watchmaker. The hours crawled by. A postman came and went. A neighbour collected a parcel. Nothing. The house remained still, the curtains partially drawn, no signs of life within. Doubt, cold and insidious, began to creep in. Had she been wrong? Was this a wild goose chase based on a single word in a witness statement? Was Finch even there? Maybe he had faded completely, a human evaporation.\n\nThen, at just after four in the afternoon, as the light began to fade, she saw it. A flicker of movement in the living room window. A light switched on, illuminating a room that was as neat and ordered as the garden outside. It was a comfortable, traditional room: a floral-patterned sofa, a polished wooden sideboard, and a mantelpiece that was conspicuously empty save for a single, ornate carriage clock. There was no sign of Mr. Finch. Ellie pressed herself closer to the dusty glass, her invisible breath fogging a patch she couldn't see. She waited, her senses on a knife-edge. The kettle whistled in a distant part of the house, the sound faint but clear. She heard the soft click of a cupboard door. And then she saw it.\n\nOn a small table next to an empty armchair, a bone china teacup and saucer sat waiting. As Ellie watched, mesmerized, the teacup lifted into the air. It tilted, as if held by an unseen hand, then moved smoothly across the room towards the kitchen. It disappeared from view for a moment, then returned, now steaming gently, a pale cloud of vapour rising from the unseen liquid within. The floating cup settled back onto its saucer with a gentle, familiar clink. Then a sugar bowl, its lid lifting of its own accord, a spoon dipping inside and stirring the contents of the cup before replacing the lid. The spoon then rested itself neatly on the saucer. It was all so calm, so methodical, so terrifyingly normal.\n\nEllie sank to the floor of the empty bedroom, a silent scream trapped in her throat. She was not alone. The faint statistical shimmer in the HOLMES database, the cold spot, the stolen photograph\u2014it was all real. Alistair Finch was like her. He was another ghost, another hole in the world, quietly making himself a cup of tea. A wave of elation, so powerful it was dizzying, washed over her, followed immediately by a tidal wave of terror and pity. She wasn't the only one. But that meant this wasn't just her problem. It was a condition. A plague. A quiet, creeping subtraction of souls from the fabric of the universe. She looked back at the window, at the armchair where a man she couldn't see was now presumably enjoying his tea. She had found her Patient Zero. The first thread in the conspiracy. But the elation died as a new, impossibly complex question took its place. She had found him. But how in God's name do you introduce yourself to a ghost?The question hung in the dusty air of the abandoned bedroom, a perfect summary of her impossible situation. For a career built on confrontation and interrogation, on the power of presence and a well-timed question, she was now faced with a contact problem that defied every protocol she had ever learned. To knock on his door would be to announce a floating set of clothes, an act of such profound weirdness it would likely trigger a heart attack in a man of his age. To shout from the street was to invite the attention of the entire neighbourhood and a swift response from the local police, a scenario too layered with irony to contemplate. No, this had to be handled like the most delicate of source-handling operations: with patience, with caution, and with an undeniable, secret proof of shared experience.\n\nFor the rest of the afternoon, she did nothing but watch. It was the purest form of surveillance she had ever undertaken. From her grimy window, she observed the quiet, invisible life of Alistair Finch. She saw a newspaper lift from the doormat and float to the armchair, where its pages turned with methodical slowness. She watched as a duster, seemingly of its own volition, traced the surfaces of the polished sideboard, moving with the practiced, gentle strokes of someone who took pride in his home. She saw the carriage clock on the mantelpiece being wound, the key turning in the air with a series of tiny, precise clicks. He was a man of routine, a man clinging to the mundane scaffolding of a normal life in a desperate attempt to feel real. Every quiet, ghostly action was a testament to a long and lonely battle fought in secret. He wasn't a phantom; he was a widower, a retired watchmaker, going about his day. The tragedy of it was a lead weight in Ellie\u2019s chest.\n\nAs dusk settled over the quiet cul-de-sac, she knew she could not wait any longer. An idea, born of her DCI\u2019s tradecraft, had crystallised. She needed a dead drop, a message that could be delivered without contact and replied to without a meeting. She turned from the window and began a systematic search of the abandoned house. The place had been picked clean of anything valuable, but in a drawer in the kitchen, among dried-up rubber bands and a single, rusty key, she found what she needed: a promotional notepad from a local estate agent and a cheap ballpoint pen that still, miraculously, worked. She returned to the gloom of the upstairs bedroom, sat on the dusty floorboards, and began to compose the most important message of her life. Her invisible hand felt for the paper, her fingers gripping the pen. It was a bizarre sensation, watching the pen move across the page, seemingly guided by an unseen force, leaving a trail of blue ink in its wake. She wrote with a brutal economy, choosing words that would be meaningless to anyone else but a thunderclap of recognition to him.\n\n\"I know,\" she wrote. \"The cold spot. The photograph. I am the same. You are not alone. If you understand this, and if you are willing to communicate, leave a yellow duster tied to the front doorknob tomorrow before noon. Do not try to find me. I will find you.\"\n\nThe note felt heavy in her hand, a small, paper rectangle containing the weight of two impossible lives. The instruction was a classic police move: simple, specific, and designed to confirm receipt and willingness to engage, all while maintaining control of the situation. It put the ball firmly in his court. She waited until the street was utterly dark and silent, the houses blank-faced and sleeping. The walk across the road was the longest of her life. Every rustle of a leaf, every distant hum of a car engine, felt like an alarm. She reached his front door, her heart hammering a frantic, silent rhythm. She bent down, her invisible fingers pushing the folded note through the letterbox. It landed on the bristly doormat inside with a soft, definitive whisper. The act was done. There was no taking it back. She retreated to the dark sanctuary of the empty house, her eyes locked on the front door of Alistair Finch, and began the second, more torturous, phase of her wait.\n\nThe night was endless. She did not sleep. She sat by the window, a sentinel in the dark, watching for any sign. A light flicking on. A curtain twitching. Nothing. The house remained as still and silent as a tomb. Dawn broke, grey and reluctant, and still there was no movement. A new fear began to gnaw at her. Had he not found it? Had she misjudged him completely? What if he had panicked, called the police to report a threatening note, bringing the whole visible world crashing down on their secret? Her carefully constructed plan suddenly felt like a fool\u2019s gamble. Then, at shortly after 8 a.m., she saw the newspaper float up from the doormat as it had the day before. But this time, it stopped. It hovered in mid-air for a long, pregnant moment before dropping back to the mat with a soft rustle. Something had changed. He had seen her note.\n\nShe watched, holding a breath she couldn't see, as a patch of empty air by the door seemed to shimmer with indecision. She could almost feel his shock, his terror, his disbelief, radiating across the street. She imagined him standing there, his invisible hand clutching his chest, his world, which had already been turned upside down, now spun on its axis once more. For a full hour, nothing happened. The newspaper lay where it had fallen. The house was utterly still. Ellie\u2019s hope began to curdle into despair. He was going to ignore it. He was too scared, too insular, too broken by his long solitude to risk contact. Her gamble had failed. She was still alone. She was about to turn away from the window, to admit defeat and begin the long, lonely journey back to her own prison, when she saw it. A flash of yellow in the dim hallway, visible through the frosted glass panel of the front door. The doorknob, which had been dull brass, now had a small, bright yellow knot tied around it. A yellow duster. He had answered. He understood. He was willing to talk. Ellie sank back into the shadows of the empty room, a wave of relief so profound it felt like a physical blow washing over her. She was not alone. There was another ghost in the world, and he was waiting for her to make the next move.The relief was a physical thing, a slackening of unseen muscles, a deep, shuddering intake of air that disturbed the dust motes in the sunlit room. He had answered. For the first time since her world had dissolved, Ellie was not an anomaly of one. There was a population of two. The implications were staggering, but for a single, precious moment, all she felt was the simple, profound comfort of no longer being utterly alone. The moment passed, and the DCI took over once more. Phase one, establishing contact and willingness to communicate, was complete. Phase two, the meeting itself, now required a new level of planning and risk.\n\nShe didn't waste time. She retrieved the notepad and pen and wrote a second message, her hand steadier this time. The floating pen moved with more authority across the page. \"Thank you. We need to talk. The empty house opposite, number 14. Tonight, after midnight. The back door will be unlocked. I know this is difficult. It is for me, too. But we have to understand what is happening to us.\" She folded it, and as night fell for the second time on the quiet Solihull street, she repeated the covert journey across the road, posting the next piece of her impossible puzzle through his letterbox. There would be no signal this time. Only an act of faith. He would either come, or he would not.\n\nReturning to the cold, derelict house, she began to prepare her interview room. She found two rickety dining chairs in the downstairs room, their legs caked in dust. She dragged them into the centre of the empty living room, wiping them down with the sleeve of her floating black top. She arranged them facing each other, about six feet apart. It looked like a set for some absurd minimalist play. The stage was set for a conversation between two people who couldn't be seen. As the hours ticked by towards midnight, a new kind of anxiety began to build. She had forced this, engineered it. She was dragging a reclusive, grieving old man out of the fragile shell of routine he had built and into the terrifying unknown she now inhabited. What right did she have? The question was answered by the memory of the FLIR image, the fiery ghost with the black hole in its head. She had every right. They were both sick with the same impossible disease, and isolation was no cure.\n\nA few minutes past midnight, she heard it. A soft, hesitant creak from the back of the house. The sound of the patio door sliding open, then closing with a gentle click. Footsteps, slow and shuffling, on the dusty floorboards of the kitchen. A man\u2019s breathing, shallow and tight with fear. He was here. He had come. Ellie stood by her designated chair in the living room, her own heart a frantic, silent drum. The footsteps paused at the doorway. She could feel his presence, a subtle compression of the air, the faint, almost imperceptible scent of old books and soap. He was standing right there, a man-shaped column of terror and curiosity.\n\n\"Mr. Finch?\" she said, her voice low and steady, though it cost her a monumental effort to keep it from trembling.\n\nA sharp, startled intake of breath from the doorway. A long silence, and then a voice, thin and reedy, but with a watchmaker's precision in its diction. \"How\u2026 how did you know my name?\"\n\n\"I'm a police officer,\" she said, the words tasting strange and half-true in her mouth. \"It's what I do. Or what I used to do. My name is Eleanor Vance.\"\n\n\"A police officer,\" he repeated, the words full of a quiet, defeated wonder. He took another shuffling step into the room. \"I\u2026 I did not take anything else. Only the photograph. I don't know why I ran with it. I was so frightened.\"\n\n\"I know,\" Ellie said, a wave of empathy washing over her. Her theory had been right. He wasn't a thief; he was a victim, just like her. \"I'm not here about the photograph, Mr. Finch. I'm here because of this.\" An idea, a sudden gamble to build trust, seized her. With a decisive set of movements, she pulled the black top over her head and let it fall to the floor. She kicked off her trainers, then stripped off the leggings and the rest of her clothes, dropping them into a small, dark pile beside her chair. The cold of the room hit her instantly, a familiar shock. \"I think we should talk on equal terms.\"\n\nThere was another long, stunned silence from the doorway. She heard a soft rustle of fabric, then another. A moment later, he spoke again, his voice closer now, and thick with an emotion she couldn't quite place. \"My God,\" he whispered. \"You too. You really are.\" He shuffled forward and with a soft sigh, the dining chair opposite her creaked as it took his invisible weight. The meeting had begun. They were two ghosts in an abandoned house, stripped bare and shivering in the dark, and for the first time in a very long time, they were not alone.## Chapter 7\n\nFor a long time, the only sounds in the room were the frantic, mismatched rhythms of their breathing and the faint, distant moan of the wind in the chimney. They were two voids in the darkness, defined only by the creak of the cheap wooden chairs and the palpable aura of their shared terror. It was an intimacy so profound and so strange that it transcended all norms of human contact. Ellie, trained to read every twitch and nuance of a suspect\u2019s face, was now flying blind, relying on nothing but the cadence of a stranger\u2019s breath and the weight of the silence between his words. She was the one who had engineered this impossible summit, and so the onus was on her to navigate it.\n\n\"When did it start for you?\" she asked, her voice deliberately calm, the tone of a doctor taking a patient\u2019s history. \"The first time you noticed something was wrong.\"\n\nThe chair opposite her creaked as the unseen man shifted. When he spoke, his voice was thin but steady, each word placed with the precision of a watchmaker setting a jewel. \"Six months and four days after my Mary passed,\" he said, the statement devoid of self-pity, a simple declaration of fact. \"I was washing my hands at the kitchen sink. The water was very hot, and I looked down to see the pattern of the porcelain right through the back of my hand. I thought I was losing my mind. The grief, you know. I thought it had finally broken me. It came and went for a few weeks, like a faulty connection. Then one morning, I woke up, and\u2026 there was just a depression in the pillow where my head should have been. I haven't seen myself since.\"\n\nHe paused, and Ellie could hear a faint, wet sniffle in the darkness. \"That was eighteen months ago. I adapted. The routines\u2026 winding the clocks, making the tea, tending the roses\u2026 they are my anchor. If I keep doing the things Alistair Finch would do, then perhaps I still am him.\"\n\nHis quiet confession resonated with a truth that Ellie felt deep in her invisible bones. She had her golf, he had his clocks. They had both clung to the rituals of their former lives as a bulwark against the encroaching madness. \"For me, it was different,\" she found herself saying, the admission surprising her. \"My marriage ended years ago. The job\u2026 it ate everything. My life got smaller and smaller until it was just the work. I think I was already a ghost, in a way. I had lost\u2026 myself. This,\" she gestured to the empty space where her body was, \"just made it official.\"\n\nThe shared diagnosis hung in the air between them: they were both victims of a profound and hollow-ing loss. The silence that followed was different, less fraught with fear and more with a sombre, shared understanding. They were two sides of the same coin. This was the moment to push, to introduce her one piece of hard evidence. \"Alistair,\" she said, the use of his first name a deliberate step towards a fragile alliance. \"I did something\u2026 reckless. I broke into my old police station. They have equipment, thermal imaging cameras. I needed to see if I was really there.\" She described the journey, the break-in, her voice a flat, professional monotone, and then she described the result. \"It was all there. A complete thermal image. A woman made of fire. But there was something else. Something wrong.\"\n\nShe lifted her unseen hand and pointed to her own forehead. \"Right here. In the centre. There was a hole in the heat. A perfect, dark circle of absolute cold. A dead spot, where there should have been warmth. I can't feel it, not in the normal way, but it's there. It's the source, I think.\" She leaned forward, the front legs of her chair groaning in protest. \"Alistair\u2026 I need to know. Do you have one?\"\n\nThe silence that answered her was the most profound yet. It stretched for so long that she began to think he had simply vanished, evaporated from the chair opposite her. When he finally spoke, his voice was a choked whisper, freighted with a horror that made the hairs on her invisible arms stand on end. \"The anchor,\" he breathed. \"That's what I call it. I can feel it. Not like you feel a headache. It's\u2026 a pressure. A cold, heavy weight, right behind the eyes. I assumed it was just me. A tumour. The physical cause of the madness.\"\n\n\"You can feel it?\" Ellie asked, her professional calm shattered. This was new data. \"What does it feel like?\"\n\nAlistair took a deep, shuddering breath. \"It feels like a drain,\" he said, the words tumbling out now, a confession held back for eighteen long months. \"At first, it was just the cold. But over time\u2026 it's like it's feeding. Not on my body. On my thoughts. On\u2026 me. My memories of Mary. When this started, I could remember every detail of her face, the sound of her laugh, the way she smelled of lavender. Now\u2026 now I have to look at her photograph just to be sure of the colour of her eyes. It's taking her from me, piece by piece. The cold spot is erasing her.\"\n\nThe simple horror of his words struck Ellie with the force of a physical blow. This wasn't a static condition. It was progressive. It wasn't just about the loss of a physical body; that was merely the opening act. The true horror was the slow, systematic erasure of the soul. Her burnout, her all-consuming job\u2014the cold spot was feeding on that, too. She thought of her golf swing, the one pure thing she had left. Was it taking that? Was it consuming the memories of her parents, of a childhood she barely thought about anymore? The invisibility wasn't the disease. It was a symptom of a much more terrifying process. They weren't just disappearing. They were being consumed.The watchmaker\u2019s words landed in the cold, dusty room and detonated. Erasure. It was a word far more terrifying than invisibility. It reframed her entire condition, transforming it from a bizarre physical state into a terminal diagnosis of the soul. Ellie felt a chill so profound it seemed to emanate from the cold spot on her own forehead, spreading outwards through her invisible limbs. This entity, this phenomenon, wasn't just hiding them; it was hollowing them out, using them as fuel. The job that had consumed her life now felt like a long, slow marination, preparing her for the feast. The memories of her ex-husband, Graham, were already faded, the good times bleached out by years of resentment and neglect. Could she still picture her father\u2019s face clearly? The thought sent a jolt of pure ice through her. She tried, and the image that came to mind was blurry, indistinct, a photograph left out in the sun for too long.\n\n\"It's a parasite,\" she heard herself say, the words hard and clipped, the DCI finding footing even on this shifting ground of ontological terror. \"It anchors itself in a place of loss, of vacancy, and it feeds on what's left. Your grief for your wife. My\u2026 burnout. It's consuming the very things that made us who we are.\" She stood up, the chair scraping against the floorboards with a jarring screech. The cold of the room was nothing compared to the cold fury now building inside her. She began to pace, a ripple of disturbed air moving through the gloom. \"This isn't a passive state, Alistair. It's an attack. And if it's an attack, we can fight back.\"\n\nThe chair opposite creaked, a sound of immense weariness. \"Fight back?\" Alistair's voice was heavy with the weight of eighteen months of solitary defeat. \"How? I've spent every single day fighting. I talk to Mary. I say her name out loud a hundred times a day. I force myself to remember our first holiday, the day we bought this house. I tend her roses, I wind the clock she loved. I surround myself with her, with us. But it's like trying to hold water in a sieve. Every day, a little more is gone. The cold place\u2026 it's stronger when I am idle. When I sit and let my mind drift, I can feel it\u2026 pulling. It is weakest when I am working. When I have a watch to repair, when my focus is absolute on a gear, a spring, a single tiny screw. But I'm running out of watches.\"\n\nHis confession was a tactical briefing from the front line of a long, losing war. His strategy had been defensive, a desperate reinforcement of existing memories. It was a noble effort, but it was doomed to fail. You couldn't save a library by re-reading the books while an arsonist was at work in the stacks. Ellie stopped her pacing, her mind racing, connecting the data points. Alistair\u2019s workshop. Her own fleeting moment of pure, unadulterated presence on the golf course. The clean crack of the drive, the singular focus on the ball. In those moments, she hadn't been thinking about her past, her losses, her job. She had been utterly, completely in the present.\n\n\"That's it,\" she said, her voice electric with a dawning, terrifying hope. \"You're right. It's weakest when your focus is absolute. You've been trying to save the past, Alistair. That's the battle it wants you to fight, because it will always win. It feeds on memory. We can't beat it by looking backwards. We have to starve it. We have to stop giving it what it wants.\" She turned to face the empty chair where he sat, her own invisible form radiating a new, fierce energy. \"We have to create. We have to build. We need new memories, new experiences, new purpose. Things so new and so powerful that they overwhelm the old losses. We can\u2019t just be the ghosts of a watchmaker and a cop. We have to become something else. Something it can't digest.\"Alistair did not respond immediately. The creak of his chair was a sound of profound doubt, the protest of old wood under the weight of a man who had been sitting with his ghosts for too long. When he finally spoke, his voice was frayed, stripped of its earlier precision. \"Become something else? But\u2026 I am Alistair Finch. I am Mary\u2019s husband. That is the only thing that has kept me here. Every clock I wind, every rose I prune, it is an act of defiance, a statement that I am still the man she loved. If I abandon that\u2026 if I try to become 'something else'\u2026 what if I lose him completely? What if that\u2019s all that is left of me, and I let it go? Then the cold place wins. It will have taken everything.\"\n\nHis logic was the flawless, circular reasoning of a long-term prisoner. He had defined the walls of his cell so completely that he could no longer imagine a world outside them. Ellie understood it instantly. It was the same logic that had kept her chained to her desk, sacrificing her life to a job that had stopped giving anything back long ago. Her new idea was not just a strategy; it was a form of heresy against the faith of their shared suffering.\n\n\"No,\" she said, her voice firm, cutting through his weary resignation. \"You misunderstand. This isn't about letting go. It's about building a wall. Think of it, Alistair. You said it yourself, it's a parasite. It's feeding on your memories of Mary. Your beautiful, precious memories. Your current strategy is to sit in the larder with it, guarding the food while it eats. You're trying to outlast it, but it has an infinite appetite. We can't win that way.\" She took an invisible step closer to him, her presence marked only by a slight shift in the air. \"We don't abandon the past. We build a fortress around it. A fortress made of new things, new skills, new moments. We make ourselves so busy, so focused on the present, so full of *now*, that the parasite starves. The cold spot shrinks because it has nothing to feed on. We don't forget Mary. We save her. We save what's left of her by building a life so vibrant and so real that the ghost inside us can't get a foothold.\"\n\nThe metaphor, blunt and militaristic, seemed to land. There was another long silence, but this one felt different. It was the silence of calculation, of a watchmaker considering a new and complex mechanism. Ellie could almost hear the gears turning in his mind as he weighed eighteen months of lonely, defensive grief against this sudden, aggressive, and terrifying new proposal. He was a man of logic, of systems. She had given him a new system to consider.\n\n\"A fortress,\" he murmured, testing the word. \"So we\u2026 what? Go out into the world? A world we cannot be seen in, a world that would lock us up if they knew? It is impossible. I have not left my house in over a year, except to put out the bins.\"\n\n\"We start small,\" Ellie countered immediately, seizing the flicker of possibility. \"We start right here. In this room. We prove the theory. We do something together. Something that requires focus. Something creative. A new, shared memory that belongs only to us, the two ghosts. Something it cannot possibly have a taste for.\" She looked around the derelict living room, her eyes adjusting to the deep gloom. Her gaze fell on the fireplace, a soot-stained maw with a broken hearth, its slate tiles cracked and displaced. \"We fix that,\" she said, pointing an invisible finger. \"The hearth. It\u2019s broken. We'll need tools, cement, something to mix it in. Your workshop, you must have what we need. We'll plan it. We'll sneak the supplies over. We'll work together, coordinating our movements, solving the problems. We will take this broken thing and we will make it whole again. It's a pointless, absurd task. But it's ours. It will be the first brick in our fortress.\"\n\nThe idea was utterly mad. Two naked, invisible people, planning to conduct clandestine home repairs in a derelict house as a form of metaphysical warfare against a soul-eating parasite. And yet, in the profound strangeness of their situation, it possessed a spark of perfect, insane logic. Alistair was quiet for a moment longer. Then, for the first time, Ellie heard a new sound from the opposite chair. It was a dry, rusty chuckle, a sound of disbelief at war with a dawning sense of wonder. \"A police officer and a watchmaker,\" he said softly. \"Turning into\u2026 builders. Mary would have found that very, very funny.\" He sighed, a long, slow exhalation that seemed to carry some of the weight of his solitude with it. The chair creaked as he stood up. \"Alright, Detective Chief Inspector Vance. Let us build your fortress. Tell me, what is the best way to steal a bag of cement?\"## Chapter 8\n\nThe absurdity of Alistair\u2019s question, spoken with such genuine curiosity, hung in the cold air like a puff of condensation. For a moment, the sheer, mad reality of their situation crested over Ellie, and she almost laughed. Here she was, a Detective Chief Inspector, a pillar of law and order, being asked for advice on the best way to procure stolen building materials. The fortress, it seemed, would be built on a foundation of petty crime. She pushed the hysterical laughter down, marshalling her thoughts back into the familiar, comforting channels of operational planning. This was no different from planning a raid, only the objective was constructive rather than destructive, and her entire team consisted of one invisible, retired watchmaker.\n\n\"We don't steal,\" she stated, the ingrained habit of her profession asserting itself. \"We strategically re-appropriate abandoned assets. There are dozens of small building sites dotted around. Unsecured, poorly lit. We could find a loose bag of cement, some off-cuts of slate. It's lower risk.\"\n\nAlistair made a soft, thoughtful sound in the darkness. \"The risk of discovery is lower, but the risk of failure is higher. We could spend all night searching and find nothing of the right quality. My Mary, she always said, 'If a job is worth doing, it is worth doing properly.' There is a twenty-four-hour DIY superstore just off the A45. It will be mostly empty at this time of night. They will have exactly what we need, in a single location. The risk is higher, but the reward is guaranteed. It is a more\u2026 elegant solution.\"\n\nEllie was taken aback. The quiet, grieving watchmaker was proposing a B&E at a superstore with more logistical cunning than half the sergeants she had commanded. He wasn't just a victim; he was a meticulous planner. She was the strategist, but he, it seemed, was the mission architect. A flicker of deep respect, the kind she felt for a truly competent colleague, sparked within her. \"Alright, Alistair,\" she conceded. \"An elegant solution it is. But how do we get there and, more importantly, how do we transport a twenty-kilo bag of cement without someone noticing it's floating?\"\n\n\"I have a car,\" he said simply, as if it were the most obvious thing in the world. \"A 1971 Morris Minor. My father bought it new. I keep it in perfect working order. It is\u2026 a connection to him. We will need a trolley from the store. You, I suspect, are stronger than I am. You will lift the heavy items onto the trolley. I will push it. To an observer, it will appear to be a runaway trolley. Unlikely, but not impossible. Once at the checkout, we will simply\u2026 walk past. The cashier at that time of night is usually a young man more interested in his phone than his job. With luck, he will not even look up.\"\n\nThe plan was audacious, riddled with a thousand points of potential failure, and yet it was the only plan they had. An hour later, they were standing in Alistair\u2019s garage. It was a complete contrast to her own cluttered, neglected space. This was a sanctuary of order. Tools hung on a pegboard in a perfect, gleaming tableau. Jars of screws and nails were neatly labelled. And under a dust sheet sat the car. When Alistair pulled the cover off, Ellie, even in her state of invisible anxiety, felt a small gasp of admiration. The Morris Minor was immaculate, its dark green paint polished to a deep lustre, its chrome trim gleaming. It was a museum piece, a perfect fossil from a bygone era. The driver\u2019s side door opened, seemingly on its own, and the seat depressed with a soft sigh of leather as Alistair settled himself behind the wheel. Ellie slipped into the passenger seat, the unfamiliar sensation of the curved bench seat a strange comfort.\n\nThe journey was the most surreal experience of Ellie\u2019s life. The engine coughed to life with a surprisingly throaty roar, and the large, thin steering wheel began to turn, guided by an unseen hand. They pulled out of the quiet cul-de-sac, a ghost car gliding through the sleeping suburbs of Solihull. To any late-night observer, it would have been a sight to curdle the blood. Ellie sat rigidly, her eyes scanning the road, calling out directions from a map app on her phone, which floated in the space between them. They were a bizarre parody of a married couple on a road trip, their conversation stripped down to the bare, procedural essentials. \"Left at the next roundabout, Alistair.\" \"There's a police car behind us, slow down.\" The squad car cruised past them without a second glance, its occupants oblivious to the two law-breaking phantoms in the vintage automobile beside them.\n\nThe car park of 'DIY Universe' was a vast, orange-lit expanse of empty tarmac. They parked in a dark corner, the little Morris Minor looking like a lost toy amongst the few battered transit vans belonging to the night staff. Inside, the store was a cathedral of silence, broken only by the hum of the fluorescent lights and the distant beep of a reversing forklift. A lone, bored-looking teenager was stacking shelves three aisles away, lost in the tinny beat escaping his headphones. Alistair located a flatbed trolley, and with a soft rumble of wheels, their operation began. They moved with a silent, coordinated grace that surprised them both, two invisible forces working in perfect tandem. Alistair guided the trolley, his unseen hands resting on the bar, while Ellie moved ahead, a silent scout.\n\nThey reached the building materials aisle, a cavernous corridor of plasterboard, timber, and pallets stacked high with bags of cement and plaster. Ellie located the correct type of tile adhesive and a small bag of grey grout, placing them on the trolley with soft, careful movements. Then came the cement. The twenty-kilo bag was dense and awkward. Bracing her invisible feet, Ellie squatted, wrapped her arms around the thick paper sack, and lifted. The strain was immense, a deep pull in her back and shoulders. The bag rose from the pallet, a solid, branded object levitating in the sterile air. She shuffled backwards, muscles screaming, and lowered it onto the flatbed with a muffled whump that sounded like a cannon shot in the stillness. At the far end of the aisle, the shelf-stacker paused, pulling one headphone out, his head cocked.\n\nHe turned, his gaze sweeping down the aisle towards them. For a heart-stopping moment, his eyes seemed to pass right over the spot where the floating bag of cement had just settled onto a seemingly self-propelled trolley. His gaze was vacant, unfocused. He saw nothing, because he expected to see nothing. But then he started to walk towards them, a slow, ambling gait, his eyes now fixed on a display of spirit levels just beyond their position. There was nowhere to run, nowhere to hide. They were trapped. Ellie froze, every muscle tensed. Beside her, she heard Alistair make a tiny, choked sound of pure panic. In that split second, her DCI\u2019s brain, trained for chaos, took over. She couldn't move the trolley, but she could move something else. With a swift, silent movement, she reached out to a tall, precarious display of brightly coloured spray-paint cans. Her invisible fingers found a single, loose can on the top tier. She gave it a sharp, decisive nudge.\n\nThe can of 'Racing Green' fell with a series of loud, dramatic clatters, bouncing off the shelves below before hitting the concrete floor with a final, echoing crash. The shelf-stacker jumped, startled, his attention snapping instantly to the source of the noise. He swore under his breath and changed course, heading towards the rogue can of paint with the weary sigh of a man profoundly wronged by the universe. The window was open. \"Now,\" Ellie breathed. Alistair needed no further encouragement. He pushed the trolley with a newfound urgency, its wheels rumbling as they made their escape down the aisle and towards the blissful anonymity of the main thoroughfare.\n\nThey bypassed the single open checkout, its cashier staring intently at a glowing phone screen, and pushed their illicit haul out into the cold night air. The relief upon reaching the car was so intense it left Ellie feeling light-headed. They loaded the boot in a frantic, silent rush, the heavy bag of cement a dead weight that felt like victory. As they drove away, leaving the glowing superstore behind them, neither of them spoke. They were no longer just victims. They were conspirators, partners in a crime that no one else in the world could possibly understand. Back in the derelict house, they piled the fruits of their raid on the dusty floor beside the broken hearth. The bag of cement, the tub of adhesive, a new trowel, and a small stack of dark grey slate tiles. It wasn't just a pile of building materials. It was the first tangible proof of their alliance, a shared secret made solid. It was the first brick.## Chapter 8\n\nThe glow of their shared, absurd victory lasted until the first grey light of dawn seeped through the grime of the windows, turning their haul from a trove of triumphant plunder into a drab, inert pile of building supplies. The silence of the house reasserted itself, and with it, the daunting reality of the task they had set themselves. Ellie looked at the bag of cement, a solid, tangible object, and felt a familiar wave of pre-operation anxiety. It was one thing to plan a mission, another entirely to execute it, especially when the principal challenge was the non-existence of the operatives themselves. The empty space beside her, where Alistair stood, seemed to hum with a similar tension. Their heist had been an act of pure, adrenaline-fueled momentum. This, the building, would be a slow, painstaking exercise in a new and terrifying kind of trust.\n\n\"Right,\" Ellie said, her voice sounding unnaturally loud in the morning stillness. \"First, we need a plan. A system. We can't see each other\u2019s hands. We can't judge distance visually. Every single movement will have to be choreographed and communicated. It\u2019s going to be like defusing a bomb in the dark, only with more dust.\"\n\nAlistair, ever the pragmatist, had clearly been thinking along the same lines. \"Verbal cues,\" he stated, his voice regaining its focused, watchmaker\u2019s tone. \"We will have to narrate our every action. We define a workspace on the floor, a 'red zone'. Nothing enters or leaves that zone without a clear verbal announcement. 'I am placing the trowel on the left edge of the zone.' 'My hand is now entering the zone from above to retrieve the trowel.' It will be slow. It will be tedious. But it will prevent us from injuring one another or ruining the materials.\"\n\nAnd so, their strange ballet began. The first hour was a masterpiece of clumsy frustration. They found a battered plastic bucket in the overgrown garden to use for mixing. The simple act of pouring cement powder into it was a nerve-shredding ordeal. Ellie, being the stronger, lifted the heavy bag while Alistair guided the opening over the bucket, their commands a frantic, whispered dialogue. \"Lower by an inch, Eleanor!\" \"Is that enough?\" \"Too much, too fast! It's going everywhere!\" A cloud of grey dust erupted, making them both cough, their invisible lungs protesting the fine powder. They sounded like two ghosts choking on their own ethereal dust. The floor around the bucket was soon covered in a fine grey film, a testament to their initial incompetence.\n\nAdding the water was even worse. Alistair held the bucket steady while Ellie, using a dirty milk bottle they\u2019d rinsed in a puddle, attempted to pour. Her first attempt was a torrent that sent a wave of grey water sloshing over the side. \"Gently!\" Alistair cried out, a sharp edge of panic in his voice as the cold, gritty liquid splashed against his unseen shins. Ellie froze, mortified. \"I'm sorry,\" she snapped, her frustration aimed more at herself than him. For a moment, the fragile alliance wavered, the sheer difficulty of their task threatening to drive a wedge between them. Then Alistair sighed, a long, weary sound. \"No, my apologies, Eleanor. I am not used to\u2026 teamwork. Let us try again. Slower this time. I will tell you when to stop.\" They did, and this time, guided by his calm, precise instructions, they achieved a thick, workable, lumpy grey sludge. It was, Ellie thought, the single greatest accomplishment of her recent life.\n\nAs they began to work, a strange rhythm developed. They were no longer a cop and a watchmaker. They were two hands of the same unseen body, forced to communicate every twitch and intention. \"I am applying the adhesive to the back of the first tile,\" Alistair would murmur, his voice a low constant. Ellie, kneeling opposite him in the 'red zone', would prepare the next tile, cleaning its edges. \"The next tile is ready, to your left, long side facing you.\" They moved with a slow, deliberate grace, their earlier clumsiness replaced by a hard-won synergy. The scrape of the trowel, the soft tap of the rubber mallet, the rasp of the slate tiles against each other, became the vocabulary of their shared purpose. They spoke less, their verbal cues becoming shorter, more intuitive. They were beginning to anticipate each other's needs, feeling the subtle shift in the air as the other moved, a new sense born of their shared affliction.\n\nIt was as she was carefully cleaning excess adhesive from between the first two laid tiles, her focus absolute on the feel of the damp rag against the stone, that Ellie noticed it. The cold spot. The familiar, low-grade pressure behind her forehead, the psychic hum of the parasite, was\u2026 quieter. It wasn\u2019t gone, but its insistent, draining presence had receded, pushed to the periphery of her consciousness by the overwhelming demands of the present moment. Her mind was not on her past, her losses, or her fear. It was entirely consumed by the exact angle of a slate tile, the consistency of grout, the precise location of Alistair's invisible hand. She paused, the rag still. \"Alistair,\" she whispered, her voice full of a new, tentative awe. \"The cold\u2026 can you feel it?\"\n\nFrom the other side of the hearth came a soft, sharp intake of breath. \"Yes,\" he breathed, his voice filled with wonder. \"It's\u2026 distant. Like a radio station that has gone out of tune. The pulling\u2026 it has stopped.\" The parasite was being starved. Their insane theory was working. The simple, focused, creative act of mending a broken thing was a weapon. It was a shield. The joy of the revelation was a shot of pure, undiluted energy. A genuine, unrestrained laugh bubbled up out of Ellie, a sound so unfamiliar in the grim silence of the last few weeks that it startled them both. A moment later, a dry, rusty chuckle answered her from Alistair\u2019s side of the hearth. For a brief, shining moment, they were not two invisible phantoms fighting a soul-eating monster. They were just two people, laughing in a dusty room, covered in cement, having the time of their lives.## Chapter 9\n\nThe shared laughter, a rare and precious sound in the derelict house, faded into a new kind of silence. It was not the oppressive, fearful quiet of before, but a space filled with a vibrant, shared energy. They returned to the hearth not as desperate survivors, but as joyful saboteurs, their purpose now infused with a thrilling sense of efficacy. Their verbal ballet became smoother, more intuitive. The stilted commands of \"hand in the zone\" softened into a fluid dialogue of partnership. \"Slightly more adhesive on that one, I think, Eleanor.\" \"Hold that steady for me, Alistair, just for a moment.\" They were no longer two separate entities fumbling in the dark, but a single, four-handed creature, working with a grace and synergy that belied their invisibility. The scrape of the trowel was the rhythm of their rebellion, each perfectly placed tile a victory against the void.\n\nThey laid the final piece of slate just as the afternoon sun cast long, dusty rays through the living room window. There was no grand ceremony, just a shared, satisfied sigh. They tidied their tools with the care of master craftspeople, wiping down the trowel, sealing the leftover adhesive, and stacking the remaining tiles neatly against the wall. Then they stood, two invisible figures side-by-side, and regarded their work. They couldn\u2019t see it, not in the way the new owners of the house would. But they could feel it. Ellie knelt and ran her unseen hand over the surface. It was cool, smooth, and perfectly level. The sharp, broken edges were gone, replaced by a seamless plane of dark, solid stone. A broken thing, made whole. It was more than a hearth. It was a monument to their impossible alliance, a declaration in slate and cement that they were still here, and they could still create.\n\nThe true test, however, came after the work was done. As the adrenaline of their task subsided, a familiar apprehension settled over Ellie. She sank onto her dusty chair, bracing herself for the inevitable return of the cold, psychic hum, the draining pull of the parasite reasserting its dominion in the idle quiet. She closed her non-existent eyes, focusing inward, searching for the familiar pressure behind her forehead. She waited. And she felt\u2026 quiet. The oppressive static was gone. The cold spot was still there, she knew, a latent fact like a dormant volcano, but its active, hungry presence was gone. The silence in her mind was clean, clear, and entirely her own. It was a peace she hadn't realised she had lost until this very moment of its return.\n\n\"It's quiet,\" Alistair whispered from the other chair, his voice filled with a disbelieving reverence that mirrored her own feelings perfectly. \"For the first time in so long, my head is quiet. I can think without\u2026 fighting.\" He paused, and Ellie felt the direction of his presence shift as he turned towards her. \"The watches\u2026 when I work on them, the feeling lessens, but it always comes back the moment I put my tools down. This\u2026 this is different. The quiet is deeper. It feels\u2026 earned.\" He was right. This wasn't the temporary reprieve of solitary focus. This was the resilient peace of shared accomplishment. It was a new kind of memory, one not of loss or grief, but of creation and partnership, and it seemed to be anathema to the parasite. \"We built a wall,\" she said softly, the words filled with awe. \"And it's holding.\"\n\nTheir conversation, for the first time, drifted away from the immediate, terrifying present. They spoke of the things that brought them focus, the \"safe\" memories that were about process, not people. Alistair described, with a passion that warmed his reedy voice, the beautiful, intricate logic of a grasshopper escapement, the delicate balance of a hairspring. Ellie, in turn, found herself talking about the singular, clean joy of reading a green on a golf course, the complex calculation of wind and slope that dissolved the rest of the world into irrelevant noise. They were exchanging notes from their respective fortresses of solitude, discovering they had been fighting the same war on different fronts, with different weapons.\n\nIt was Ellie who brought them back to the necessary, tactical reality. \"This is a proof of concept, Alistair. A brilliant one. But this house\u2026 our sanctuary\u2026 it's temporary. We can't stay here forever. We need a permanent base of operations. A workshop. A place where we can continue this\u2026 therapy. A place we can secure.\" The logical answer was obvious, hanging in the air between them. Alistair\u2019s house. His workshop. His last, most personal fortress. It was a huge ask, an invitation to invade the only private space he had left. She watched the empty space where he sat, waiting for his reply, expecting hesitation. Instead, his response was immediate and sure. \"My workshop,\" he said. \"It is secure. It has everything we might need. You would be\u2026 welcome, Eleanor. It would be good to have the company.\"\n\nThe offer was a profound gesture of trust, a cementing of their alliance that felt more solid than the hearth they had just built. A wave of gratitude and relief washed over Ellie. For the first time, a long-term plan felt possible. They had a strategy, and now they had a base. A flicker of hope, bright and fierce, ignited in the darkness of her world. Full of this newfound optimism, she stood and walked to the grimy window, a habitual check of her surroundings. The street was quiet, bathed in the golden light of the late afternoon. She was about to turn away when a smart-looking estate car pulled up directly outside. A man in a sharp suit got out, walked to the leaning 'For Sale' sign in the overgrown lawn, and with a grunt of effort, pulled it from the ground. He opened the boot of his car and replaced it with another sign. It was smaller, starker, and its single, brutal word seemed to scream at her across the quiet street. A bright red banner emblazoned with the word: SOLD.The word was a brutalist monument of red and white, a definitive, final statement. SOLD. It was not a possibility, not a negotiation; it was a conclusion. The fragile peace they had built, the quiet joy of their shared accomplishment, evaporated in an instant, replaced by the cold, familiar grip of exposure. Their sanctuary was no longer theirs. The fortress had fallen before the first defensive brick was even truly dry. Ellie felt the blood drain from her invisible face, the warmth of their recent victory leeched away by a simple word on a plastic sign. The estate agent, a man in a world of solid, visible transactions, tossed the old sign into his boot, slammed it shut, and drove away, utterly oblivious to the two ghosts he had just evicted.\n\nShe turned from the window, her movement sharp and sudden. The elation was gone from her, replaced by the clipped, urgent efficiency of a DCI facing a sudden tactical collapse. \"We have a problem,\" she announced, her voice a low, hard command. \"The house is sold. We have to leave. Now.\" The chair opposite her gave a sharp, protesting creak, a sound of sudden, crushing weight. She didn't need to see Alistair to know that the fragile, hopeful light she had seen kindle within him had just been extinguished. The silence from his side of the room was a void of profound disappointment, the sound of a man who had just taken his first step out of a lifelong prison only to find the gates slamming shut in his face.\n\nAnd then, she felt it. A cold, familiar throb behind her forehead, like the phantom limb of an amputated fear. The parasite, which had been blissfully, wonderfully quiet, was awake. It had sensed the spike of anxiety, the sudden fear of displacement, and it was stirring, hungry. A faint, draining pull began, a psychic leech fastening onto the fresh wound of their defeat. \"Alistair,\" she said, her voice tight, \"Can you feel it? It's back.\" From the darkness opposite came a low, despairing groan. \"Yes. The cold. It is\u2026 stronger than before.\" Their victory had been temporary. Their therapy worked, but the moment their focus was broken, the moment fear returned, the enemy was at their door, not just outside, but inside their own heads.\n\nTheir new reality galvanised them into frantic, whispered action. The hearth, their beautiful, solid monument, could not be hidden, but every other trace of their presence had to be erased. The leftover tiles, the tools, the precious bag of cement\u2014they had to go. \"The car is too risky in daylight,\" Ellie hissed, her mind a flurry of risk assessments. \"We take what we can carry. The rest, we have to leave. The tools are most important.\" They worked in a feverish, desperate silence, a stark contrast to their earlier, joyful rhythm. The tools were wrapped in old rags to prevent them from clinking. Alistair found a sturdy canvas bag in one of the kitchen cupboards, into which they packed the essentials. The cement, their twenty-kilo trophy, had to be abandoned, a casualty of their hasty retreat. Leaving it felt like admitting defeat.\n\nThey slipped out of the back door like the ghosts they were, their last act in the house to wipe the doorknobs clean of fingerprints they hadn't left. The journey back to Alistair's house was a gauntlet of suburban normality. Every dog walker, every passing mother with a pram, every curtain that twitched in a window was a potential witness to the sight of a floating canvas bag of tools moving purposefully down the pavement. They hugged the shadows of garden walls and hedges, moving in short, synchronised bursts, two invisible soldiers retreating through enemy territory. A postman on his rounds whistled cheerfully as he walked right past the hedge they were hiding behind, so close Ellie could have reached out and touched his mail sack. The sheer, unbridgeable gulf between his carefree, visible world and their tense, hidden one was a chasm that seemed to grow wider with every step.\n\nFinally, they reached the sanctuary of Alistair's cul-de-sac. The relief upon slipping through his back gate and hearing the click of his kitchen door locking behind them was so profound that Ellie had to lean against a wall for support, her invisible knees weak. They were safe. For now. Alistair, without a word, led the way, his soft, shuffling footsteps guiding her through his neat, quiet house and down a short corridor to a door at the very back. He unlocked it, and pushed it open. \"My workshop,\" he announced, his voice regaining a sliver of its former pride.\n\nEllie stepped inside, and felt the world shift. This was not the cold, derelict emptiness of the abandoned house. This was a world in miniature, a temple of order and purpose. The room smelled of clean machine oil, old wood, and the faint, metallic tang of brass. Workbenches lined the walls, each one a masterpiece of organisation. Tiny drawers, meticulously labelled, held gears and springs and hands. Delicate tools hung in precise rows, their polished steel glinting in the light from the large, clean window that looked out onto his rose garden. In the centre of the room, on a velvet mat under a large magnifying lamp, lay the disassembled guts of an ancient pocket watch, its components laid out like the organs of a fallen brass bird. This was not just a workshop. It was Alistair\u2019s fortress, the physical manifestation of his focused mind. This was their new headquarters.\n\nAlistair placed the bag of tools on a clear section of workbench, the canvas seeming to settle itself. The immediate crisis was over, the retreat successful. But the parasite was still there, a low, hungry hum in their minds, a reminder that defence was not enough. They had been reactive for too long. It was time to go on the offensive. \"Alistair,\" Ellie said, turning from her inspection of a rack of tiny, gleaming screwdrivers. Her voice was quiet, but it held the hard, unmistakable edge of a DCI giving a briefing. \"The hearth was our training exercise. Now the real work begins. We can't just keep building things. We need more data. We need to understand the enemy. Your case file, the Coventry traffic cop\u2026 there are others out there like us. We need to find another one. Not just to build a bigger wall. We need to find them so we can learn how this thing works, and how to kill it.\"## Chapter 10\n\nAlistair looked at the empty space where Ellie stood, his head tilted as if trying to bring an invisible object into focus. Her declaration to \"kill it\" was the most terrifying and exhilarating thing he had heard in his eighteen months of solitude. His entire existence had been a quiet, managed retreat, a rear-guard action against the encroaching fog. The idea of turning around and charging headlong into that fog, seeking out its very source, was anathema to his cautious, ordered nature. And yet, the logic was as clean and inescapable as the mechanism of a fine chronometer. Defence was a losing game. An army of two had a better chance than an army of one. The watchmaker, who had spent a lifetime making things run, finally saw the sense in not just winding his own clock, but in seeking out others that had stopped.\n\n\"Then this is no longer a workshop,\" he said, his voice quiet but resolute. He gestured with an unseen hand to the pristine benches and gleaming tools. \"It is an incident room.\" The words felt strange and momentous in the small, quiet space. His sanctuary, the last bastion of his private, ordered world, had been requisitioned for a war he had only just realised he was fighting. It felt like a violation, but also, strangely, like a promotion. He was no longer a hermit, hiding from the world. He was now quartermaster and chief analyst for a special investigations unit of two.\n\nThe transformation of the space began immediately. They brought in a small table and a chair from his kitchen, setting up a dedicated workstation for Ellie's laptop opposite his own workbench. The juxtaposition was striking: on one side, the intricate, analogue world of brass gears and polished steel; on the other, the glowing, digital portal into the vast, interconnected data-sphere of the modern world. An invisible woman sat at the table, her fingers a blur over the keyboard, the screen's light illuminating a patch of empty air. An invisible man sat at the workbench, a tiny jeweler's loupe floating near his eye as he methodically disassembled the pocket watch, the tiny, repetitive actions a form of meditation, a way to keep his own focus sharp while Ellie hunted in the electronic wilderness. They worked in a shared, purposeful silence, the soft click of Ellie\u2019s keyboard a counterpoint to the delicate tick and scrape of Alistair\u2019s tools.\n\nEllie\u2019s approach was different this time, honed by the new, terrifying clarity of their situation. She was no longer looking for anomalies. She was profiling for a specific vulnerability. She built a complex search algorithm in her head, a DCI's intuitive leap translated into database queries. She cross-referenced unresolved, low-level incident reports\u2014reports marked 'NFAR' that had a hint of the inexplicable\u2014with a new set of data: public records of profound personal and professional loss. She trawled digital archives of bankruptcy filings, linking them to sudden spikes in erratic driving reports. She scanned obituaries and divorce records from the preceding months of 'phantom burglaries' where nothing of value was taken. It was a grim, voyeuristic trawl through the wreckage of other people's lives, but she did it with the detached focus of a surgeon. She was not looking for criminals. She was looking for casualties.\n\nAfter hours of methodical searching, she returned to their strongest lead: the Coventry traffic cop's report. The driver of the swerving car. Marcus Thorne. Forty-eight years old. A HGV driver with a twenty-five-year clean record. The original incident report dismissed him as a probable drunk driver who had simply gotten lucky with the breathalyzer. But Ellie bypassed the summary and went straight for the source data, pulling up the digital file on Thorne himself. And there it was. Three months before the swerving incident, 'Thorne Haulage Ltd,' a family business started by his grandfather, had gone into liquidation. Thorne had lost everything: his company, his fleet of trucks, his professional identity. He had gone from being the boss to just another unemployed driver looking for agency work. The hollowing out had been swift and brutal.\n\n\"I have him, Alistair,\" Ellie said, her voice cutting through the quiet of the workshop. Alistair carefully placed a microscopic gear onto his velvet mat and turned his unseen face towards her. \"The driver. Marcus Thorne. His company went under. He lost a lifetime's work, his family's legacy. The traffic cop said Thorne was disoriented, argumentative. He claimed the steering had 'gone funny,' that the lorry had 'jumped.' The cop thought he was making excuses. But what if he wasn't? What if he was fading, right there in the cab, doing sixty miles an hour on the M6? What if the lorry 'jumped' because for a split second, its driver ceased to fully exist?\"\n\nThe theory was horrifying, but it slotted into their understanding of the phenomenon with a sickening click. Thorne wasn't swerving to avoid something unseen. He *was* the unseen thing. His intermittent physical state was causing the vehicle to behave erratically. He was a danger not just to himself, but to everyone around him. The cold spot inside Ellie\u2019s head seemed to pulse in grim recognition. This was not a passive, gentle fading. It could be violent. It could be catastrophic.\n\nShe drilled deeper, her fingers flying across the keys. A current address for Thorne in a tired suburb of Rugby. A flag on his file for two subsequent 'public order' disturbances, both minor, both involving arguments in public where witnesses claimed he seemed to be \"shouting at no one.\" He was deteriorating. He was losing control. He was shedding the routines that kept him anchored faster than either she or Alistair had. They had their next target. \"Rugby,\" she announced, the single word a new destination, a new mission objective. \"He's in Rugby. And from the look of these reports, he's coming apart at the seams. We need to get to him. Not just to find answers. We need to get to him before he hurts someone. Or before he disappears for good.\"The transformation of the workshop was absolute. Alistair, a man who had not moved a single tool from its designated hook in twenty years, now surveyed a large-scale Ordnance Survey map of the Midlands spread across his main workbench, held down at the corners by heavy brass paperweights. His collection of priceless, half-repaired timepieces had been carefully moved to a side bench, their intricate mechanisms now secondary to the more urgent mechanics of their mission. His sanctuary had become an incident room, and he had, with a quiet and surprising alacrity, become its chief intelligence analyst, his meticulous mind perfectly suited to the new task of route-planning and logistical support. Ellie, for her part, had established her digital command post, the laptop a humming portal from which she launched sorties into the data trails of their new target, her focus as intense and all-consuming as any major investigation she had ever run.\n\nTheir new partnership was a study in contrasts. Alistair, grounded in the analogue world of maps and mechanics, planned their physical journey. He traced the route from Solihull to Rugby on the paper map with an unseen finger, his voice a low murmur as he calculated fuel consumption for the Morris Minor and identified potential blackspots for surveillance. He was methodical, cautious, pointing out the vulnerabilities of taking such a conspicuous, vintage car on a long journey. Ellie, operating in the abstract realm of data, was more aggressive. She saw the risks, but her focus was on the target, the urgent need to intercept Thorne before his deteriorating state caused a catastrophe.\n\n\"The car is a risk, Eleanor,\" Alistair stated, his disembodied voice emanating from beside the map. \"On the motorway, it is an anomaly. It draws the eye. If we were to be stopped for any reason, a routine check\u2026 the consequences are unthinkable. And I must confess, I have not taken her on a journey of more than twenty miles in over a decade. Her reliability is, at this point, a theoretical concept.\"\n\n\"It\u2019s the only asset we have,\" Ellie countered, her eyes not leaving the screen where Marcus Thorne\u2019s digital ghost was taking shape. \"We move at night. We stick to the back roads where we can. The risk of the journey is high, but the risk of leaving a volatile, intermittently invisible HGV driver to his own devices is higher. He's a ticking bomb, Alistair. We have to get there.\" Her logic was brutal and unassailable, the cold calculus of command. Alistair fell silent, conceding the point. The mission parameters were set by the threat, not by their comfort. They would take the Morris Minor.\n\nThey left under the cloak of a moonless night, the little green car a whisper of motion through the sleeping towns of the Midlands. The journey was a long, ninety-minute ordeal of sustained, silent tension. Every pair of headlights in the rear-view mirror was a potential threat, every distant siren a possible end to their impossible enterprise. Ellie navigated, her voice a low, steady presence in the dark, while Alistair drove with a focus so absolute it was a physical force in the small cabin. They were a ghost crew sailing a ghost ship through a world that could not be allowed to see them. As they drove, Alistair, perhaps needing to fill the tense silence, began to talk about the car, about his father teaching him to drive in it, about the faded scent of his mother\u2019s perfume that he could still sometimes smell in the woollen seat covers. It was not a lament for the past, Ellie realised, but a quiet statement of what he was fighting to protect. He was not just saving himself; he was saving the library of memories that made him who he was.\n\nThey arrived in Rugby in the dead hour before dawn, the town\u2019s industrial estates and tired-looking housing developments a world away from the manicured lawns of Solihull. The address they had for Thorne was a flat in a grim, four-storey block, its concrete facade stained with damp, its balconies cluttered with rusting satellite dishes and broken furniture. The place radiated a palpable air of neglect and quiet desperation. There was no empty house opposite, no convenient observation post. Their operational theatre had become infinitely more complex and exposed. They parked the Morris at the end of the road, half-hidden in the shadow of a large, graffiti-covered telecoms cabinet, and began their wait.\n\nFor hours, nothing. The block of flats remained dormant. But as the sun rose, bringing with it the daily churn of people leaving for work and school, they got their first sign. A window on the third floor, which Ellie had identified as Thorne\u2019s, slid open with a screech. A moment later, a half-eaten pork pie, trailing a greasy slick of jelly, arced through the air and splattered on the pavement below. It was followed by a torrent of furious, disembodied swearing that echoed across the car park, a litany of curses aimed at the world in general. A woman walking her dog hurried past, pulling her pet away from the mess on the ground and casting a nervous glance up at the open window from which the abuse seemed to be emanating. Alistair let out a soft, appalled gasp. His own invisibility had been a quiet, sad affair of floating teacups and self-dusting furniture. This was different. This was aggressive, chaotic, and public. This was a man not just fading, but actively lashing out at the world as he went. Their ticking bomb was live.The greasy splatter of the pork pie on the pavement was a punctuation mark at the end of a sentence Ellie hadn't wanted to read. It was a declaration of chaos, a public tantrum thrown by a man whose internal world was collapsing so violently it was spilling out into the open. Beside her, she felt Alistair recoil, a subtle shift in the air that spoke of profound dismay. His own affliction was a quiet, mannered affair, a secret kept with the same neat precision as his workshop. This raw, aggressive display of psychic collapse was a brutal confirmation that their condition was not uniform; it was a bespoke malady that preyed on the unique weaknesses of its host. For Alistair, the parasite fed on quiet grief. For Ellie, it had fed on hollowed-out duty. For Marcus Thorne, it was clearly feasting on pure, undirected rage.\n\n\"We cannot approach him like we approached each other,\" Ellie said, her voice a low, hard whisper that cut through the vintage car\u2019s quiet interior. The DCI had taken full command, the shock giving way to a cold, tactical assessment. \"A note will be a provocation. A direct approach, even an invisible one, could be met with violence. His anchor isn't a quiet memory of a loved one; it's a burning grievance against the world. He's not hiding from his condition; he's weaponising it.\" She looked at the grimy facade of the block of flats, a vertical slum radiating misery. \"I need to get inside. I need to get a baseline reading on his environment and his routine. You stay with the car, Alistair. You are our transport and our only way out. Keep the engine warm. If you see police, you leave. Do you understand? You do not wait for me. You leave.\" The order was brutal, the protocol of a deep-cover operation where one partner might have to be sacrificed for the mission to survive. Alistair did not reply, but the slight dip of the driver's seat was his silent, grim assent.\n\nHer opportunity came twenty minutes later. A harried-looking young woman, wrestling with a buggy and two shopping bags, struggled to open the main entrance door to the block. Ellie slipped through the gap behind her, a ghost riding in the wake of another person\u2019s daily struggle. The inside of the building was even more depressing than the outside. The air was thick with the smell of stale cooking, damp, and cheap air freshener failing to mask something vaguely unpleasant. Muffled sounds bled through the thin walls: the tinny beat of daytime television, the sharp, angry words of an argument, the desolate sound of a baby crying without hope of being comforted. This was a place where lives were lived on top of one another, a petri dish of quiet desperation. Ellie took the stairs, her trainers silent on the worn, stained carpet, her invisible hand gliding along a sticky banister. She was an unseen trespasser in a building full of people who already felt invisible in their own ways.\n\nShe found Thorne\u2019s flat, 3C, at the end of a dimly lit corridor. She pressed her unseen ear to the cheap wood of the door. From inside, she could hear a television blaring a mind-numbing quiz show, the questions and meaningless applause a stark contrast to the aggressive silence behind it. And then she heard another sound, a rhythmic, violent thud. Thud. Thud. Thud. It was the sound of a man repeatedly, methodically, punching a wall. Each impact was followed by a low, guttural grunt of effort and pain. He wasn't just angry. He was trying to feel something, anything, through the fog of his own dissolution, battling his invisibility with the brute, physical reality of pain. Ellie stepped back from the door, her own invisible skin crawling. This was worse than she had imagined. Alistair was trying to remember. She was trying to build. Marcus Thorne was just trying to break things, starting with himself.\n\nShe had been waiting for almost an hour, concealed in the dark recess at the end of the corridor, when the door to 3C was wrenched open. Marcus Thorne stood silhouetted in the doorway for a moment, and Ellie finally saw her target in the flesh. He was a big man, running to seed, his large frame stooped inside a stained tracksuit. His face was blotchy and pale, his eyes sunk deep in bruised-looking sockets, burning with a restless, frantic anger. His knuckles were raw and bleeding. He looked like a bear with a thorn in its paw, enraged by a pain it could neither see nor understand. He slammed the door behind him, the flimsy frame shuddering in protest, and stomped off down the corridor towards the stairs, his heavy footsteps echoing his fury. This was Ellie's chance. It was a huge risk, but the intelligence to be gained from inside his flat was too valuable to pass up. As Thorne\u2019s footsteps receded, she slipped forward. She had no tools, but she didn\u2019t need them. He hadn\u2019t even bothered to lock the door. With a soft click, she pushed it open and slipped into the lion's den.\n\nThe flat was a disaster zone, a perfect reflection of the chaos in its owner\u2019s mind. The air was thick with the smell of stale beer, unwashed clothes, and greasy takeaways. Empty pizza boxes and beer cans littered every surface. An overflowing ashtray sat perilously on the arm of a sofa that had seen better decades. In the centre of the living room wall was a ragged area of exposed plasterboard, the target of Thorne\u2019s desperate, self-harming assault. It was a scene of total collapse, the habitat of a man who had given up on every facet of a normal life. But amidst the squalor, on a small, dust-free shelf high on the wall, sat a single, pristine object. It was a beautiful, exquisitely detailed scale model of a Scania R-series truck, painted in the smart green and gold livery of 'Thorne Haulage Ltd'. It was his anchor. His last, treasured memory of a life of purpose, a life where his name meant something, a life he could see and touch.\n\nDrawn by an investigator's instinct, Ellie moved towards the model truck. It was his version of Alistair's clocks, her golf clubs. This was the nexus of his loss. As she got closer, she saw that propped against the front wheel of the model was a small, framed photograph. It wasn't of a wife or a child. It was a picture of a younger, prouder Marcus Thorne, his arm slung around an older man who shared his broad features, both of them grinning in front of a real, full-sized Thorne Haulage truck. His father. This was the legacy he had lost. She reached out an invisible hand, her fingers hovering just millimetres from the photograph, a profound, aching pity for this angry, broken man welling up inside her. He wasn't a monster. He was just another casualty, his grief curdled into a rage that was consuming him from the inside out.\n\nIt was then that she heard it. The unmistakable, terrifying sound of a key scraping against the outside of the lock. Her blood turned to ice. He was back. He must have forgotten something. Her mind raced, a frantic search for an exit, an escape route. But there was none. The flat was a small, one-bedroom box. There was no back door, no place to hide. The lock turned with a loud, final click. The door began to swing inwards. Ellie was trapped. Trapped in the chaotic, rage-filled epicentre of a volatile, unstable, and intermittently invisible man, with nowhere to run and no way of knowing if he could see her or not.",

                                        "text": "The rain over Walsall had a particular quality, a kind of weary persistence that didn't bother with the drama of a downpour but aimed instead for a slow, comprehensive soaking. It was a rain that seeped, that found the tiny imperfections in a window seal or the collar of a coat, and it had been DCI Eleanor Vance\u2019s only companion for the last four hours. She sat in the driver's seat of the unmarked Ford, the engine cold, her breath a fleeting mist on the inside of the glass. The world beyond the windscreen was a palette of greys and damp browns; the corrugated iron of the industrial unit they were watching, the slick tarmac of the service road, the bruised sky.\n\n\"Anything?\" DC Chopra's voice, startlingly young and crisp, crackled through the radio wedged in the cup holder.\n\nEllie picked it up, her thumb pressing the transmit button with an economy of movement that came from twenty-five years on the force. \"Negative, Sameer. Just a very bored-looking pigeon and enough rain to float the Black Country out to sea. You?\"\n\n\"Same, guv. Tea\u2019s gone cold. The flask has betrayed me.\"\n\nA ghost of a smile touched Ellie\u2019s lips. Chopra was a good lad. Keen. A bit too much like a Labrador puppy sometimes, desperate for a pat on the head, but his paperwork was immaculate and he could actually make a comprehensible entry in the evidence log, which put him in the top percentile of DCs she\u2019d had to break in. \"Suffering builds character, Chopra. Stick with it.\"\n\nShe dropped the radio back into its holder and flexed her fingers around the steering wheel. A dull ache had settled deep in her right knee, a souvenir from a chase through a scrapyard in Tipton a decade ago. It was her body\u2019s own weather forecast, and it was predicting a monsoon. She was fifty-two. Too old for this nonsense, for sitting in a damp car on a Tuesday night waiting for a low-level fence named Gazza to show up with a van full of stolen catalytic converters. This was a job for the keen puppies, not the old dog. But Superintendent Davies had made a point of it. \"A personal touch, Ellie. Show the team you're still one of them. Boots on the ground.\" Davies's idea of 'boots on the ground' was sending someone else's boots to get damp while he attended a regional planning dinner.\n\nShe rubbed at her eyes, the heels of her palms pressing hard enough to make stars burst behind her lids. Fatigue was a constant, a low hum beneath the surface of her thoughts. When she pulled her hands away, she glanced at her knuckles, resting on the smooth grey plastic of the wheel. For a splinter of a second, the strangest thing happened. The texture of the dashboard, the faint crisscross pattern, was visible *through* her skin. It was as if her hand had become a pane of smoky glass. She blinked, hard. And it was gone. Her hand was just a hand again, solid and pale, the skin a little dry. A network of fine lines and a single, silvery scar from a misplaced bread knife.\n\nA migraine aura, she told herself. Stress. Not enough sleep, too much caffeine. The optic nerve playing tricks. It had to be. She\u2019d had them before, strange scintillating zig-zags at the edge of her vision. This was just a new, and admittedly unsettling, variation. She resolutely filed the incident away in the mental cabinet marked 'Things To Ignore' and forced her attention back to the shuttered door of Unit 14B.\n\nAnother hour crawled by. The pigeon, having concluded its business, flew away. Ellie\u2019s mind drifted. It wasn't supposed to be like this. She\u2019d pictured DCI as the pinnacle, a position of command and strategy, of moving pieces on a chessboard. She hadn't accounted for the sheer, grinding weight of the bureaucracy, the budget meetings, the performance reviews, the endless demand for statistics that painted a rosier picture than the reality on the streets. Her life had narrowed until the job was all that was left. It had consumed her marriage years ago, swallowed up friendships, and now it was gnawing away at her sanity, one stakeout at a time.\n\nHer only escape, her one remaining secret pleasure, was the golf course. The early weekend mornings at the municipal, the clean crack of a well-hit drive, the singular focus on a small white ball. It was a different kind of problem-solving. Trajectory, wind speed, the lie of the land. There were rules, and they made sense. Unlike life. She had a set of second-hand Callaways in the boot of her own car, a battered stand bag she'd had since her thirties. It was the only part of her life that felt entirely her own, untainted by the job.\n\nA flash of headlights jerked her back to the present. A white transit van, mud-splashed and dented, swung into the service road, its engine rattling like a can of bolts. It reversed clumsily up to the doors of Unit 14B.\n\n\"Contact,\" she said into the radio, her voice low and steady. The fatigue vanished, replaced by a familiar, cold thrill. \"White transit. Stand by.\"\n\n\"Copied, guv,\" came Chopra's immediate reply, the puppy now a wolf, alert and ready.\n\nThe van's side door slid open and a man in a high-vis jacket jumped out. Gary \"Gazza\" Tomlinson. He was practically a local landmark. He fumbled with a set of keys, unlocked a huge padlock, and began to heave the big metal shutter upwards. It rose with a deafening screech that tore through the quiet evening. The moment it was high enough, two more figures emerged from the darkness of the unit.\n\n\"Right,\" Ellie murmured, her hand already on the door handle. \"Let's go and say hello.\"\n\nShe gave the signal. Two other cars, hidden further down the road, flicked on their lights. Her own door opened and she was out in the rain, the cold shock of it welcome now. Chopra was already sprinting from his position, his longer legs eating up the ground. The three men by the van froze, their faces a comical tableau of surprise and dismay in the sudden glare of the headlights. Gazza, to his credit, reacted first. He spun around and bolted, not towards the road, but back into the labyrinthine mess of the industrial estate.\n\n\"Chopra, with me!\" Ellie yelled, breaking into a surprisingly fast run, her bad knee screaming in protest. \"Uniforms, secure the other two!\"\n\nAdrenaline was a wonderful anaesthetic. She ignored the pain, her eyes locked on Gazza\u2019s bright yellow jacket as he dodged between stacked pallets and rusted skips. He was younger, but he was a smoker and she was fueled by pure, distilled rage at the thought of the paperwork this chase was going to generate. She was gaining on him. He glanced over his shoulder, his eyes wide with panic, and swerved into a narrow alley between two units. A dead end. He knew it the moment he was in. He spun around, panting, his hands held up.\n\n\"Alright, alright, guv! It's a fair cop!\"\n\nEllie slowed to a walk, catching her breath, the rain plastering her hair to her forehead. Chopra arrived a second later, puffing but triumphant. \"Got him, guv.\"\n\n\"Good work, Sameer. Cuff him.\" As Chopra wrestled with the cuffs and a suddenly uncooperative Gazza, Ellie leaned against the cold brick wall of the alley, the adrenaline starting to ebb, leaving the ache in her knee in its wake. She looked down at her hand, braced against the damp brickwork. And it happened again. Slower this time. A creeping transparency, starting at the fingertips. She could see the dark, moss-stained mortar of the wall through her own flesh. It was like watching ice melt, but in reverse, turning from solid to spectral. She stared, mesmerized and horrified, as the effect travelled up her wrist, her watch seeming to float on an invisible arm.\n\n\"Guv? You okay?\" Chopra's voice cut through her daze.\n\nShe snatched her hand away from the wall, shoving it into her pocket. When she looked at it in the darkness there, it was solid again. Just a hand. \"Fine,\" she snapped, her voice harsher than she intended. \"Just... catching my breath. Get him back to the van.\" The rest of the arrest was a blur of procedure. The other two suspects were compliant, the van was full of stolen tech, and by the time they got back to the station, the canteen was serving lukewarm stew. Ellie skipped the stew. She went to her office, the strange flickering of her hand replaying in her mind. She wrote her initial report with a kind of numb efficiency, her fingers hitting the keyboard with mechanical precision. Davies would be pleased. A good result. A feather in his cap.\n\nIt was past midnight when she finally left the station. The rain had, at last, given up. The streets of Walsall glistened under the orange streetlights, empty and quiet. Her house was on a neat, boring estate that had seemed like a sensible choice ten years ago and now just felt like a trap. It was tidy, sterile. The home of someone who was never there. She kicked off her shoes, dropped her keys in a ceramic bowl by the door, and walked through the silent house to the downstairs bathroom.\n\nShe didn't know why, but she had to look. A morbid curiosity. She flicked on the light. The face in the mirror was tired. Dark circles under the eyes, a fretful line between her brows. The face of DCI Eleanor Vance, fifty-two, divorced, no kids, married to the job. It was a face she was tired of looking at. She sighed, picked up her toothbrush, and squeezed a line of paste onto it. She turned on the tap, ran the brush under it, and began to scrub at her teeth with a grim determination. It was just another night. Another day done.\n\nShe spat into the sink, rinsed her mouth, and looked up.\n\nAnd screamed. A silent, strangled gasp that caught in her throat.\n\nThe mirror was empty.\n\nNo, not empty. The mirror was reflecting the bathroom perfectly. The beige tiles, the towel rail with its neatly folded hand towel, the bottle of hand soap on the edge of the sink, the light fixture on the ceiling. It was all there. Everything except her.\n\nHer mind refused to process it. She could feel her heart hammering against ribs she couldn't see. She could feel the cold tile floor under feet that were not there. The toothbrush, which she had been holding, fell from an invisible hand, clattering against the white porcelain of the basin with a sound that was far too loud in the sudden, terrifying silence of her world. She raised her arms, or where her arms ought to be. Nothing. She flapped them, a frantic, desperate motion. All she saw was the wall behind her. She was gone. The face she was so tired of looking at, the body that ached with the weight of her life, the whole solid presence of her, had simply... ceased to be. There was only the empty space where a woman should have been, and the frantic, invisible pulse of pure, unadulterated terror."

                                        "text": "Her first rational thought, slicing through the static of her terror, was that she was having a stroke. Or a complete psychotic break. The mind, pushed far enough, would simply snap the tether to reality. She had seen it happen to suspects, to victims, even to a colleague once after a particularly gruesome case involving a family. But this felt different. It didn't feel like a hallucination. The chill of the tiled floor was real, the lingering minty tang of toothpaste in her mouth was real, the solid, familiar shape of her own jaw beneath her questing, invisible fingers was terrifyingly, irrefutably real. She could feel the soft fabric of her Henley shirt against her skin, trace the waistband of her trousers, feel the pulse hammering in a throat she could no longer see.\n\nIt was then she looked down. Her clothes weren\u2019t invisible. They hung in the air, a ghostly sculpture of a person. The grey shirt was rumpled, the dark trousers creased at the non-existent knees, the sleeves puckered at the elbows. It was the most obscene thing she had ever seen; a person-shaped void, delineated by cotton and denim. She held up an arm, and the grey sleeve lifted with it, empty and limp from the wrist. She balled a fist she could not see, and the material at the end of the sleeve tightened. It was a macabre puppet show, and she was the unseen puppeteer, the ghost in her own machine.\n\nThe detective in her, buried under an avalanche of panic, began to claw its way out. Observation. Facts. What did she know? Fact one: her body was invisible to the naked eye, and apparently to mirrors. Fact two: her clothes were not. Fact three: she was still solid, possessed mass, and was subject to gravity. Fact four: the phenomenon was intermittent before, but now seemed total. She stumbled out of the bathroom, away from the damning evidence of the mirror, her hand trailing along the wall for balance. The sensation was bizarre, watching the wall and feeling its textured wallpaper slide against a palm that wasn't there. She was a moving blind spot.\n\nShe made her way into the living room, the familiar space now alien and menacing. Every object seemed to mock her with its stolid visibility. The sofa, the television, the framed photograph on the mantelpiece of her and her ex-husband, taken in a happier time. She was a ghost in her own home, a ghost in her own life. Who could she call? The very idea was insane. \u2018Hello, desk sergeant? I\u2019d like to report a missing DCI. Yes, that\u2019s me. I\u2019m reporting myself missing. I\u2019m at my home address, but I appear to have mislaid my entire physical body.\u2019 They would have the mental health team at her door in ten minutes. Dr. Evans? He\u2019d triple her antidepressants and book her a long stay in a quiet room with padded walls. Chopra? The poor lad would have a nervous breakdown. No. This was hers. A problem of one. The ultimate solitary confinement.\n\nHer gaze fell on the hallway that led to the back door and the small, attached garage. In there, propped against a stack of old newspapers, was her golf bag. The battered Callaways, the scuffed leather of the bag itself. Suddenly, she had a desperate, irrational need to see it, to touch it. It was her only anchor, the one part of her life that was just about sport and physics and clean air, untainted by crime and paperwork and the slow, grinding erosion of her soul. Moving with a new, frantic purpose, she walked towards the garage, her empty clothes shuffling through the silent house. It was an absurd pilgrimage, a search for solace in a set of metal sticks. But in a world that had just casually ripped up every rule she had ever known, the simple, solid reality of a three-iron felt like the only sane thing left."

                                        "text": "The internal door to the garage clicked open with a familiar groan, pushed by a disembodied grey sleeve. The air inside was cool and still, thick with the scents of engine oil, damp concrete, and the faint, sweet perfume of dried grass clippings from the lawnmower. It was a space of deferred tasks and forgotten hobbies; stacked boxes of case files marked for archiving, a dusty workbench cluttered with tools she rarely used, a deflated bicycle tyre hanging from a hook like a dead snake. But her eyes sought only one thing. Propped in the corner, illuminated by the weak light spilling from the hallway, was her golf bag. It was old and worn, the black and red fabric faded, the stand slightly bent. It looked solid. It looked real.\n\nShe approached it slowly, a shuffling set of clothes moving through the gloom. Her invisible hand reached out, the grey cuff of her shirt hovering just above the worn leather of the bag\u2019s handle. She hesitated for a fraction of a second, then her fingers closed around it. The feel of it was a shock of normality. The pebbled texture of the handle, the slight give in the stitching, the sheer physical fact of it beneath her grasp. It was an anchor in a world that had become a phantom sea. She let out a breath she hadn\u2019t realised she was holding, her shoulders, hidden beneath the fabric, slumping in relief. She ran her other hand down the side of the bag, her unseen fingers tracing the zips and pockets, finally closing around the cold, hard shaft of her driver where it stuck out from the top. The sensation was grounding, a confirmation that her sense of touch, at least, had not deserted her.\n\nThe terror, while not gone, receded enough for the investigator to surface. This was a scene. She was the evidence. She had to analyse it. The toothbrush had been visible when it fell. The clothes were visible now. The golf club in her hand was still stubbornly, reassuringly a golf club. She pulled her seven-iron from its slot, the metal scraping softly against the other clubs. Holding it aloft, she watched as the club hovered in the garage air, suspended by an unseen force. It was a cheap magic trick, utterly baffling and real. Any object she held remained visible. This wasn\u2019t a field of invisibility that extended outwards; it was a property of her own body. The implications started to slot into place with cold, logical precision. She couldn't walk down the street. People wouldn't see her, but they would see a floating coat and trousers ambling along the pavement. She couldn't pick up a cup of coffee without it appearing to levitate.\n\nThere was only one logical, if utterly mad, course of action. The clothes had to come off. The thought made her skin, the skin she could feel but not see, crawl. To be naked and invisible in her own cold garage felt like the punchline to a terrible joke she didn't understand. With clumsy, fumbling motions, she began to undress. Unbuttoning her shirt was a bizarre act of faith, her fingers working by memory and feel alone, the fabric parting to reveal\u2026 nothing. Just the back wall of the garage seen through the gap in her shirt. She pulled it off, letting it drop to the concrete floor where it lay in a sad, grey heap. Then came the trousers, the belt buckle cold against her spectral fingertips, until they too were pooled around her ankles. She stepped out of them, and then, finally, stripped off her socks and underwear.\n\nShe stood for a long moment in the absolute, bone-aching cold of the garage, every nerve ending screaming with the chill. She was completely, utterly gone. She waved an arm and saw only the dusty workbench behind it. She looked down at the floor and saw only the cracked concrete where her feet should be. The only proof of her existence was the cold, the frantic drumming of her own heart, and the faint disturbance in the air as she breathed. She took a tentative step, then another. It felt like walking in a dream, a disembodied consciousness drifting through a solid world. She shuffled over to the wing mirror of her car, leaning in close until her non-existent nose was almost touching the glass. The reflection was perfect and unbroken: the shelves, the boxes, the sad, discarded pile of her clothes on the floor. Of Eleanor Vance, there was not a single trace. The experiment was a success. The conclusion was horrifying. This was not an illusion. This was her reality now. A ghost in her own life, stripped bare and shivering in the dark."

Not the background chill of the rainy evening, but a deep, invasive cold that settled into her unseen bones as she stood naked on the concrete floor. It was a physical fact, an undeniable sensation that proved her body, though vanished from sight, was still a vessel of nerve endings and shivering muscle. The ghost was getting hypothermia. The absurdity of it was almost enough to make her laugh, but the sound died in her throat. She had to move, to get warm, to think. She turned, a ripple of disturbed air in the stillness of the garage, and walked back into the house, her invisible feet silent on the laminate flooring of the hall. She closed the door to the garage behind her, the soft click of the latch sealing her in with her impossible secret.\n\nA hot shower seemed like the most logical first step. It was a routine, a human ritual, and she clung to the idea of it like a drowning woman to a piece of driftwood. The bathroom was a chamber of horrors now, with its truth-telling mirror, but she forced herself back inside. She didn't look at the reflection of the empty room. Instead, she reached for the shower dial, her unseen fingers recognising the familiar shape and resistance. Watching the chrome fixture turn, seemingly of its own accord, was profoundly unsettling. She stepped into the cubicle and pulled the glass door shut. When the water hit, hot and hard, she gasped. It wasn't just the warmth, it was the confirmation. She could feel every single drop, a million tiny impacts against her shoulders, her back, her legs. The steam billowed around her, swirling and eddying against an invisible shape, momentarily outlining a human form before dissipating into the general haze. It was the closest she had come to seeing herself in what felt like an eternity.\n\nWrapped in a large bath towel that seemed to float around her middle, she padded into the living room and sank into the soft cushions of her armchair. The fabric dipped, compressed by a weight it could not see. She sat there for a long time, the only sound the frantic thumping of her own heart and the drip of water from her spectral hair onto the towel. The detective in her began to stir, methodically, pushing aside the raw animal fear. This was a case. The most bizarre case of her career, and she was the sole victim, witness, and investigator. She began to assemble the facts in her head. Fact one: the condition is total invisibility of her biological matter. Fact two: inanimate objects she holds or wears remain visible. Fact three: her physical solidity, mass, and sensory perceptions remain intact. She could still feel, hear, taste, smell, and interact with the world. She was a perfectly functional human being who had been deleted from the visible spectrum. The \u2018migraine aura\u2019 theory was now laughably insufficient. This wasn't a trick of the light; it was a fundamental violation of the laws of physics as she knew them.\n\nAs dawn began to bleed grey light through the cracks in the blinds, the silence of the house was shattered by a shrill, demanding ring. The landline. Her heart, which had just begun to settle into a steady rhythm of dread, kicked into a frantic gallop. The caller ID display glowed on the handset in the hallway: WEST MIDS POLICE. They were checking on her. She was late. Of course she was late. For the first time in twenty-five years, DCI Vance was a no-show. The phone rang again, insistent. It was a lifeline to a world she was no longer part of, and a threat to the secret she had to keep. She had to answer it. To not answer would trigger a welfare check, and the thought of a pair of uniformed officers breaking down her door to find an empty house with a pile of clothes in the garage was unthinkable.\n\nTaking a deep, steadying breath that did nothing to calm her, she walked to the hallway table. Her invisible hand reached out and picked up the receiver, which then floated eerily in the air. \"Vance,\" she said, and was shocked by how normal her voice sounded.\n\"Guv? It's Sameer. You okay? You're never late.\" Chopra. Of course. His voice was a mixture of surprise and genuine concern.\n\"Chopra,\" she rasped, deliberately roughening her voice, making it sound clogged and sick. \"Yeah. Sorry. Woke up feeling like I'd been run over by a bus. Some kind of bug. Stomach, head\u2026 the works.\" It was her first lie. The first stone laid in the foundation of her new, hidden existence.\n\"Oh, right. Blimey. Is it that thing that's been going around? Half of admin are off with it. Do you need anything? I can drop off some supplies after my shift.\" The puppy, loyal to the last. The kindness was a knife in her gut.\n\"No,\" she said, too quickly. \"No, don't. It's\u2026 explosive. Trust me, you want to maintain a five-mile exclusion zone. I'm going to turn my phone off and try to sleep it off. I'll check in tomorrow.\"\n\"Okay, guv. Hope you feel better soon. Davies is going to be chuffed about the Gazza arrest, by the way. The Super's already emailed about it.\"\n\"Good,\" she croaked. \"That's good.\" She hung up, placing the handset back on its cradle with a hand that trembled invisibly. The receiver settled into place, and the connection to her old life was severed.\n\nShe had done it. She had bought herself time. A day, maybe two. The relief was a thin, brittle skin over a vast emptiness. She slid down the wall, her towel-wrapped form slumping to the floor in a way that would have looked utterly bizarre to an observer. The job. Davies, Chopra, the Gazza arrest. It all felt like it had happened to someone else, in another lifetime. Her entire career, her identity, was built on presence, on being seen. On the authority she projected when she walked into an interview room, the reassuring glance she could give a victim, the intimidating stare that could break a suspect. All of it, gone. She couldn\u2019t walk into her office, couldn\u2019t chair a briefing, couldn\u2019t testify in court. DCI Eleanor Vance, as the world knew her, had ceased to exist. The job that had consumed everything else in her life was now the one thing that was utterly, completely impossible for her to do.\n\nAnd then, a thought, insidious and strange, surfaced through the mire of her despair. She looked at the mantelpiece, at the photo of her and Graham, smiling on a beach in Cornwall. She thought of the endless meetings, the budget cuts, the stifling bureaucracy. She thought of Davies and his political games, of the weary ache in her bones after a thankless sixteen-hour day. All of that was gone, too. The constant pressure to be DCI Vance, the unblinking eye of the force, the woman who had sacrificed everything for the job. She was free from it. Not just from the duties, but from the scrutiny. No one was watching her anymore. No one *could* watch her. It was a horrifying, terrifying, and profoundly lonely kind of freedom. The freedom of a ghost, adrift in her own life, with no rules and no one to answer to. Shivering there on the floor, a disembodied consciousness draped in a bath towel, Ellie Vance began to wonder if her life had just ended, or if it had, in some terrible and incomprehensible way, just begun."

                                        "text": "The thought of freedom was a dangerous, seductive whisper in the roaring silence of her mind. For twenty-five years, she had been a public servant in the most literal sense; her face known to every villain and beat cop in the Black Country, her life forfeit to the relentless demands of the job. Now, she was the ultimate private citizen. More than private. She was a secret. The idea was so potent it was almost physically painful. She could walk anywhere, go anywhere, listen to anything. She was the perfect surveillance machine. The ultimate undercover officer. The thought was immediately followed by a wave of self-loathing. Was that really her first instinct? To weaponise her own affliction for the job that had already taken everything from her? The irony was so bitter it tasted like bile.\n\nSlowly, she got to her feet, the towel clutched around her waist. The house was cold and her stomach was a tight knot of hunger and anxiety. Food. She needed food. The journey to the kitchen was an exercise in navigating by memory and touch alone. She ran an invisible hand along the cool surface of the kitchen counter, her fingers finding the handle of the fridge. Inside, the light flickered on, illuminating the contents. A half-empty bottle of milk, some wilting lettuce, a sad-looking block of cheddar. It looked like the fridge of a person who didn\u2019t live here. She reached for the milk, her brain calculating the position of her hand with unnerving accuracy. The bottle lifted, suspended in the air, and she carried it to the counter, her movements slow and deliberate, like a bomb disposal expert.\n\nMaking a simple cup of tea and a cheese sandwich became the most complex and mentally taxing operation of her life. She had to trust her proprioception, the body\u2019s innate sense of its position in space, to a degree she had never imagined. She found a mug by touch, placed a teabag in it by faith, and held it under the kettle\u2019s spout, praying she had the angle right. The click of the boiling kettle was a gunshot in the quiet room. Pouring the water was terrifying; she had to rely entirely on the sound of the filling mug and the increasing weight in her unseen hand. She ended up with scalding water splashed across her spectral knuckles, the pain a sharp, welcome confirmation of her own reality. The sandwich was a similar ordeal. The knife floated, slicing through the cheese. The bread seemed to butter itself. She ate standing by the counter, forcing down the dry bread and tasteless cheese, acutely aware that she couldn't see her own mouth, couldn't watch her own hands. It was the loneliest meal she had ever eaten.\n\nAfter the ghost of a breakfast, she made her way to the small study. Her laptop sat on the desk, closed. Here was a window. A way to reach out into the world without being seen, a tool she already used to exist at a distance. She sat down, the office chair sighing under her weight, and opened the screen. Her fingers, guided by decades of muscle memory, found the home keys on the keyboard. She opened a browser, the screen\u2019s light bathing a patch of empty air. For a moment she just stared at the search bar, the blinking cursor a tiny, rhythmic pulse of infinite possibility and utter hopelessness. What could she possibly type?\n\n\u2018Human body becomes transparent\u2019. \u2018Spontaneous invisibility\u2019. \u2018Sudden cellular translucency\u2019. The search results were a predictable cascade of science fiction tropes, crank medical theories from the dark corners of the internet, and forum posts from people who believed they could astral project. There was nothing scientific, nothing medical, nothing real. She spent an hour diving down rabbit holes, reading about quantum entanglement, military cloaking technology, and obscure neurological conditions that affected self-perception, but none of them fit. They were disorders of the mind, not the flesh. Her mind was horribly, terrifyingly lucid. It was her body that had staged the coup. The silence from the legitimate world was deafening. There were no case studies, no research papers, no bewildered articles in medical journals. Whatever this was, it was happening to her and her alone. She was a medical anomaly of one.\n\nThe sound of the letterbox clattering shut made her jump so violently the chair squeaked. Footsteps crunched on the gravel path outside, then receded down the street. The post. A bill, a takeaway menu, a circular. A dispatch from a world that was still running on time, a world where people were visible and paid their gas bills and ordered pizza. She crept to the front door and peered through the spyhole. The street was empty save for a neighbour from three doors down, wrestling his recycling bin to the kerb. He paused to stretch his back, wincing, utterly oblivious to the invisible woman watching him from behind the door. The sheer, unbridgeable chasm between their two realities was dizzying. He had a bad back. She had no body. They were living in different universes, separated by a pane of glass and a few feet of air.\n\nShe sank to the floor again, the sheer weight of her solitude pressing down on her. The house, once a sterile sanctuary from the chaos of her job, had become a prison. She was trapped. She could order groceries online, she supposed, have them left on the doorstep. She could live here, in the quiet and the dark, a ghost haunting the rooms of her own life, until her money ran out or her mind finally fractured. But as she sat there, her gaze drifted towards the hallway, towards the closed door of the garage. Behind it, leaning in the corner, was her golf bag. The thought of the golf course, the wide open green under a vast sky, was a sudden, desperate craving. The clean, uncomplicated physics of it. Out there, in the dark, her invisibility wouldn't be a curse. It would be an advantage. No one would see the odd-looking woman practicing her swing at two in the morning. No one would see her at all. The idea took root, a small, defiant weed pushing up through the concrete of her despair. She couldn't be DCI Vance. She couldn't even be Ellie Vance. But maybe, just maybe, she could be a golfer."

                                        "text": "## Chapter 3\n\nThe day was the longest of her life. A sentence served in ten-hour increments, measured by the slow march of sunlight across the living room carpet. She was a phantom in a diorama of her own life, watching the world through glass. She saw her neighbour\u2019s children leave for school, their shouts and laughter like sounds from another planet. She saw an Amazon delivery van pull up, the driver jogging to the door opposite with a parcel, his movements full of a casual, unthinking visibility that she now envied with a burning intensity. She did not turn on the television or the radio. The thought of hearing about the world\u2014about crimes, about politics, about the weather over Walsall\u2014felt like listening to a report from a country from which she had been permanently exiled. The silence was a presence, broken only by the hum of the fridge and the frantic, looping monologue in her own head.\n\nAs dusk began to blur the edges of the day, the passive agony of waiting solidified into a hard, cold resolve. The golf course. The thought had become an obsession, a focal point in the swirling chaos of her new reality. It was no longer about solace; it was about action. A test. An experiment to see if she could function in this new state, or if she was doomed to haunt the two floors of her semi-detached house until she went mad. A plan, police-like in its pragmatism, began to form. She couldn't carry the clubs; the sight of a floating golf bag trotting down the street would guarantee a call to every news outlet in the country. But in the back of the garage, behind the lawnmower, was an old, collapsible pull-trolley she hadn't used in years. She could push it. At two in the morning, a self-propelled golf trolley would be strange, yes, but far less strange than a levitating one. It was a flimsy plan, a desperate gamble, but it was infinitely better than doing nothing.\n\nWhen the streetlights had been on for hours and the last glow of television sets had blinked out from her neighbours\u2019 windows, she began her preparations. The garage was like a tomb, the air frigid against her bare skin as she wrestled the stiff, dusty trolley from its resting place and strapped her bag to it with trembling, invisible hands. The most difficult part was the final act of leaving. She stood in her hallway, utterly naked, her hand on the front door latch. Every instinct, every ingrained habit of a lifetime screamed at the sheer, insane vulnerability of it. To step outside, stripped not just of her clothes but of her very image, felt like a greater violation than any she had ever faced. But the alternative, the endless, silent waiting in the house, was a kind of death. She took a breath that felt like it was drawn from the bottom of a well, turned the lock, and pushed the door open into the cold, damp night.\n\nThe world outside was a sensory assault. The rough, uneven surface of the pavement was a shock of texture against the soft soles of her feet. She flinched as she stepped into a shallow puddle, the icy water a sudden, sharp pain. The air, heavy with the smell of wet tarmac and decaying leaves, moved against her skin, a constant, ghostly caress. She pushed the trolley before her, its wheels making a soft, rhythmic rumble on the pavement that sounded deafening to her own ears. Cars passed, their headlights sweeping the street, and she froze each time, her heart hammering. The beams passed through the space she occupied, illuminating the privet hedge behind her, and for a moment, she was nothing more than a distortion in the air, a place where the light did not reflect. She was a hole in the world, pushing a set of golf clubs.\n\nShe had been walking for nearly twenty minutes, sticking to the shadows, when she heard the jingle of a dog collar and the soft tread of trainers. A man in a tracksuit, head down, phone glowing in his hand, was walking a small Jack Russell. There was nowhere to hide. Ellie froze, flattening herself against a brick garden wall, her hand clamped over the handle of the trolley to keep it still. The man walked past, oblivious, but the dog stopped. It planted its front paws, a low whine building in its throat, its nose twitching as it stared directly at the spot where Ellie stood. The man tugged the lead. \"Come on, Buster, there's nothing there. Just a fox, probably.\" The dog resisted, letting out a short, sharp bark, its small body taut with a primal sense of wrongness. For a terrifying second, Ellie was sure the man would look closer, would see the trolley that seemed to have stopped of its own accord. But he just sighed, gave a harder tug, and pulled the reluctant animal away. \"Stupid mutt.\" Ellie didn't breathe again until they had rounded the corner, the sound of the dog\u2019s whining fading into the night. She had been seen. Not by human eyes, but seen all the same.\n\nThe Walsall Municipal Golf Club was a dark, sprawling shape against the slightly less dark sky. Its main gates were padlocked, a heavy chain looped through the bars. In her old life, she could have flashed a warrant card or simply called the groundskeeper. Now, she was just another trespasser. She pushed the trolley along the perimeter fence, the wire humming faintly in the breeze. About fifty yards down, where the fence met a thicket of overgrown brambles, the wire was bent and loose at the bottom, pulled up by years of teenagers looking for a shortcut. It was a narrow, muddy gap. With a grimace, she crouched down, the wet earth cold and slimy beneath her invisible knees, and shoved the trolley through first. Then, with a grunt of effort and a scratch from a thorny branch across a shoulder she could not see, she squirmed through after it. She was in. An intruder on her own sanctuary.\n\nThe course was a transformed world. The familiar, friendly undulations of the fairways were now rolling seas of blackness under the weak moonlight. The sand traps were pale, ghostly hollows. The silence was profound, broken only by the whisper of the wind in the tall pines that lined the first hole and the soft rumble of her trolley on the manicured grass. It was eerie, but it was also peaceful. Here, there were no houses, no passing cars, no dogs to sense her presence. She felt the knot of tension in her chest loosen, just a fraction. She pulled the trolley to the first tee box, the flat, elevated ground feeling like a stage. Her stage.\n\nShe went through the ritual with a reverent slowness, her movements precise in the dark. She bent down, her unseen fingers pushing a wooden tee into the damp turf. She placed a ball on it, the dimpled white sphere seeming to glow in the gloom. She pulled her driver from the bag, the familiar weight of it in her hand a comfort and a promise. She took her stance, her bare feet planted firmly on the dew-slicked grass. She could feel the subtle shift of her weight, the tension in her thighs, the coil of her back. She didn't need to see her alignment; her body knew the geometry of this motion better than it knew anything else. For a single, crystal-clear moment, the terror, the confusion, the sheer, crushing impossibility of her situation, all fell away. There was only the ball, the club, and the clean, dark arc of the swing she was about to make.\n\nShe drew the club back, a smooth, practiced motion, and then unleashed a lifetime of frustration, rage, and grief into the downswing. The impact was perfect. Not a thud, but a sharp, clean *crack* that shattered the silence of the night like a gunshot. The force of it resonated up the shaft of the club, a jolt of pure energy that sang through her invisible hands and arms. She couldn't see the ball, but she didn't need to. She felt its trajectory, knew from the sound and the feel that it was soaring, straight and true, down the centre of the fairway, a tiny missile fired into the heart of the darkness. The echo of the shot died away, leaving a silence more profound than before. She stood there, holding her finishing pose, her invisible face turned towards the unseen flight of the ball. In that moment, she was not DCI Vance, the burnt-out cop. She was not the terrified ghost in the machine. She was power. She was purpose. She was a zero-handicap phantom, and she had just hit a perfect drive."

                                        "text": "The perfect drive. The perfect feeling. But it lasted only a moment. The glorious, singing vibration in her hands faded, and she was left standing in the dark, the cold seeping back into her bare feet. The sound of the shot had been huge, a declaration of her existence, but the silence that swallowed it was a reminder of her utter isolation. A perfect drive into an empty void. She was still naked, still invisible, still trapped in a nightmare from which there was no waking. The brief illusion of control shattered, leaving only the cold, hard facts. She let the driver drop, its unseen fall ending with a soft thud on the grass. The urge to just lie down on the damp turf and let the cold take her was immense, a siren song of surrender. But the same stubborn grit that had carried her through twenty-five years of police work, the refusal to simply give up, sparked again, small and weak, but there. She had hit the ball. She would find it.\n\nShe grabbed the handle of the trolley, the cold metal a familiar shock, and began to walk. The feel of the close-cropped fairway under her bare feet was strange, a sensation of both softness and damp resistance. Every step was an act of faith. She walked the centre line, her eyes scanning the darkness ahead, her memory of the shot her only guide. The moon broke through the clouds for a moment, casting the landscape in a weak, silvery light. The fairway stretched out like a pale ribbon between the black masses of the rough. And there, almost exactly where she had pictured it, was a tiny white speck. Her ball. It sat perched perfectly on the grass, a small, solid point of order in a chaotic universe. Finding it felt like a monumental victory, a confirmation that her judgment, her senses, were still sound. It was proof that even if she couldn't see herself, she could still accurately impose her will upon the world.\n\nReaching the ball, she stood over it for a moment. 150 yards to the pin, maybe less. A gentle seven-iron. She pulled the club from the bag, the cool steel of the shaft a comforting weight. She went through her pre-shot routine automatically, a series of small, precise movements honed by a thousand Saturdays. It was a ritual, and the familiar rhythm of it was profoundly calming. There was no conscious thought, just muscle memory. The swing was shorter this time, more controlled. The click of impact was less dramatic than the driver, a crisp, satisfying *thwack* that sent the ball on a high, graceful arc towards the green. She watched its ghost-white path against the dark sky until it disappeared somewhere near the pin. The simple, repeatable physics of it was a balm. Problem, analysis, execution, result. It was the core of her old job, stripped of all the human misery.\n\nAs she pushed her trolley towards the green, the first glimmer of a new idea began to form. This wasn't just an escape. It was training. She was learning to operate this new version of herself, calibrating her senses, trusting her instincts in a way she never had before. She was learning to navigate the world as a disembodied force. The thought was still terrifying, but it now contained a sliver of something else: potential. The green was a darker circle of velvet. She found her ball ten feet from the hole. A solid approach. The putt was a formality, her focus absolute. She crouched, reading a non-existent break in the gloom, and stroked the ball with the face of her putter. It rolled smooth and true, dropping into the cup with a soft, final clatter. A birdie on the first hole, naked, in the middle of the night, while being completely invisible. She didn't feel triumphant. She just felt\u2026 quiet. The hole was done. The problem was solved. But the course had seventeen more holes, and her life had countless empty days stretching out ahead. What now?\n\nIt was as she was walking towards the second tee that she saw it. A light. A single, yellow square of light shining from the small groundskeeper's cottage, tucked away behind a copse of silver birch trees near the ninth green. Angus McBain. The head groundskeeper. A craggy, solitary Scotsman who was as much a feature of the course as the ancient oak by the seventh fairway. He sometimes stayed over after a long day, preferring the quiet of the course to his small flat in town. In her old life, she\u2019d shared a flask of tea with him a few times during an early weekend round. Now, his light was a beacon of another existence, a sudden, jarring reminder that she was not alone out here. And with that reminder came a new, cold impulse, born not of a golfer\u2019s focus but of a detective's curiosity. She could go over there. She could walk right up to the window. She could look inside, and he would never, ever know. The thought was chilling, a violation, a trespass far more profound than just being on the course. It was a test of a different kind of nerve. The ghost was about to learn how to haunt."

One moment she was a golfer, contemplating her next shot; the next, she was a hunter, abandoning her game and her trolley in the deep shadow of a cypress tree. The cottage light was a solitary star in her personal darkness, and she was drawn to it. She moved with a newfound stealth, her bare feet silent on the soft grass. The skills she\u2019d honed over years of surveillance\u2014moving quietly, using cover, judging sight lines\u2014came back to her not as trained techniques but as pure instinct. She skirted the edge of the ninth fairway, keeping a line of trees between herself and the cottage, her body a column of cold air moving through the night. The thrill of it was shameful and undeniable, a cold burn of adrenaline that had nothing to do with chasing suspects and everything to do with the raw, illicit power of her condition.\n\nShe reached the small, manicured garden that surrounded the cottage and crouched behind a fragrant rhododendron bush, its waxy leaves cool against her invisible skin. The window was a perfect, brightly lit diorama. Angus McBain was inside, his back to her. He was a man carved from oak, with a shock of white hair and shoulders bowed by decades of physical labour. His small kitchen was tidy and worn; a pot of soup bubbled on the stove, and a half-finished crossword lay on the small wooden table. Ellie watched as he methodically buttered a slice of bread, his movements economical and sure. He was utterly engrossed in the simple task, a man at peace in his small kingdom. The scene was so profoundly normal, so deeply human, that it hurt to look at. It was a life. A quiet, simple, visible life.\n\nThe DCI in her noted the details: the brand of whisky on the side, the worn spine of the book by his chair, the way he favoured his left leg slightly. But the woman, the ghost outside the glass, felt a pang of loneliness so sharp it was a physical ache. She was watching a life being lived, and she was no longer a participant. She was merely a spectator, a phantom presence at the feast. She saw him turn and pick up a small, framed photograph from the countertop. He looked at it for a long moment, his gruff features softening into something tender, something sad. He murmured something too low for her to hear, then placed the photo back down with a quiet reverence. In that instant, the power she felt vanished, replaced by a crushing sense of her own transgression. This was not a clue. This was not evidence. This was a man's private grief, a moment of unguarded intimacy, and she was stealing it. She was no better than a voyeur, a ghoul peering into a window, her affliction a skeleton key to doors she had no right to open.\n\nA floorboard creaked inside the cottage. Angus startled, turning his head sharply towards the window. His eyes, pale and fierce, seemed to stare directly into hers. Ellie froze, her blood turning to ice. Her heart hammered against ribs he could not see, a frantic drumbeat in the silent garden. He was looking right at her. It was impossible, but he was. His gaze was fixed on the space she occupied, his head tilted as if listening for a sound that wasn't there. For ten, twenty, thirty seconds, he stood motionless, a hunter sensing a disturbance in the woods. Ellie held her breath until her lungs burned, convinced that somehow, through some primal instinct, he knew. She could imagine the headlines: \u2018Naked Invisible Policewoman Discovered by Perceptive Scottish Groundskeeper\u2019. Then, as slowly as he had tensed, he relaxed. He shook his head, a small, dismissive gesture, and turned back to his soup. It was a draught, a trick of the light, an old man\u2019s nerves. He hadn\u2019t seen her. He couldn\u2019t have.\n\nShe backed away from the window, her retreat slow and deliberate until she was swallowed by the darkness of the trees. The adrenaline drained away, leaving her hollowed out and shaking. The thrill was gone, replaced by a sour taste of shame. What had she been thinking? What had she hoped to find? A clue to her condition? An answer? There were no answers in another man\u2019s kitchen. There was only more proof of the chasm that had opened up between her and the rest of the human race. She found her trolley where she had left it, the clubs glinting dully in the weak moonlight. The desire to play was gone, the clean physics of the game now tainted by the messy, complicated trespass she had just committed. The course no longer felt like a sanctuary. It felt like a hunting ground, and she was no longer sure if she was the hunter or the prey.\n\nThe journey home was a blur of self-recrimination. Each rumble of the trolley wheels on the pavement sounded like an accusation. She had used her condition not for survival, but for a cheap, intrusive thrill. She had crossed a line, and she knew it. It was the kind of line she had spent her entire career defending. By the time she slipped back through her own front door, the first birds were beginning to sing, heralding a dawn she felt she hadn't earned. She was back in her prison, but the nature of the prison had changed. It wasn\u2019t just the house anymore; it was her own invisible skin. As she stood shivering in her hallway, she understood a new, terrible truth. The greatest danger she faced wasn't discovery. It wasn't loneliness or madness or starvation. The greatest danger was what she might become, now that no one was watching. The old Ellie Vance, the DCI with a rigid moral code, was gone. And the ghost that remained was free to write its own rules."

Back in the sterile silence of her hallway, the mud from the golf course fence was a tangible reminder of her transgression. She had crawled through the dirt, both literally and figuratively. The clean, soaring arc of her golf shots felt like a memory from a different life, a moment of purity that only served to highlight the sordid nature of what came after. Crouching in a stranger\u2019s garden, stealing a glimpse of his private grief\u2014it was a squalid little act, the kind of pathetic intrusion she\u2019d once scorned in low-level informants and gossiping neighbours. She was a Peeping Tom. A ghost at the window. The power she had felt for a fleeting moment was nothing more than the grubby thrill of the voyeur.\n\nShe made her way to the bathroom, avoiding the mirror as if it might somehow see her despite the evidence. The shower was scalding hot this time, a punishment. She scrubbed at her spectral skin with a ferocity that bordered on self-harm, trying to wash away the feeling of Angus McBain's sad, unknowing eyes. As the water sluiced over her, she thought about the dog, Buster. The animal had known. It hadn't seen her, but it had sensed the wrongness, the hole in the pattern of the world where she stood. It was a sobering thought. She was not entirely undetectable. She was a disturbance, a ripple. And if a dog could sense her, what else could? The thought was a new and unwelcome thread in the tapestry of her fear.\n\nDrying herself with a rough towel, the familiar motions a small comfort, she felt a subtle shift in her thinking. The raw panic was being replaced by something else, something colder and more familiar: professional anger. She was a DCI. Her life\u2019s work was about imposing order on chaos, finding answers in the dark. For two days she had been floundering, a victim of circumstance. No more. This was not a medical crisis or a supernatural curse to be endured. This was a case. The case. And she was the lead investigator. The shame from the garden began to recede, burned away by the icy fire of purpose. Spying on Angus had been a mistake, an undisciplined, emotional act. She would not make that mistake again. From now on, every action would have a purpose. Every risk would be calculated. The objective was no longer to survive, but to understand.\n\nClad in a floating fleece dressing gown, she went to her study and sat before her laptop. Her previous, desperate searches for \u2018spontaneous invisibility\u2019 now seemed amateurish, the work of a panicked civilian. She was not a civilian. She pushed aside the public internet and navigated to a bookmarked portal, her fingers flying across the keyboard to type in a long, complex password that gave her remote access to the West Midlands Police HOLMES database. The Home Office Large Major Enquiry System. It was the brain of the force, a vast, interconnected repository of every crime, statement, and piece of evidence from thousands of cases. She wasn't looking for a crime. She was looking for the gaps, the loose threads, the reports that went nowhere. Every force had them: the 'Misper' (Missing Person) report where someone vanished from a locked room; the oddball witness statement about a \"man who wasn't there\"; the burglaries with no signs of forced entry. These were the files that got marked \u2018NFAR\u2019 \u2013 No Further Action Required \u2013 and were buried under the weight of more urgent, more violent, more understandable crimes. They were the force\u2019s collection of ghost stories, and she was about to become their most dedicated reader.\n\nThe hours bled into one another as she fell down a rabbit hole of official strangeness. She bypassed the obvious crank calls and filtered for credible witnesses\u2014other cops, paramedics, sober professionals. She found a report from a traffic cop in Coventry who swore a car had swerved to avoid something he couldn't see. She found a witness statement from a terrified homeowner in Solihull who claimed to have heard an intruder and felt a cold spot pass by him, but the only thing missing was a single, sentimental photograph from his mantelpiece. Each report was a dead end, a tiny, isolated mystery. But as she cross-referenced dates, locations, and keywords, a faint, almost imperceptible pattern began to emerge. A cluster of low-level, inexplicable events dotted across the West Midlands over the past eighteen months. It was nothing concrete, nothing she could ever have presented in a briefing. It was just a faint statistical shimmer, a whisper in the data. But it was more than she\u2019d had before. She was not the first ripple. There were others.\n\nThe realisation brought a new, urgent need. She had to know the parameters of her own condition. The dog had sensed her. Angus had felt something. She was a physical object, subject to thermodynamics. She had a heat signature. The thought clicked into place with the force of a revelation. Thermal imaging. The force had Forward-Looking Infrared (FLIR) cameras, expensive pieces of kit used for night-time surveillance, for finding fugitives hiding in the woods, for spotting cannabis farms from the air. She needed to look at herself through one of those cameras. And she knew exactly where one was. It was stored in a locked cabinet in the Technical Surveillance Unit on the third floor of Walsall Central Police Station. Her station. The place she was supposed to be running. The irony was a physical blow. To investigate her own disappearance, she would have to break into her own office. The ghost would not just haunt; she would have to become a thief, stealing from the very institution she had given her life to. The moral line she had crossed in Angus\u2019s garden was nothing compared to the one she was now preparing to obliterate."

                                        "text": "The moral compass of DCI Eleanor Vance, which had spun wildly in the storm of her new reality, now clicked into a fixed, chilling direction. North. The shame she\u2019d felt in Angus McBain\u2019s garden had not been exorcised; it had been analysed, processed, and repurposed. It was now a cold, hard data point demonstrating the unacceptable risks of unstructured, emotional action. What she had done in the groundskeeper's garden was sloppy and unprofessional. Breaking into her own police station, however, would be the opposite. It would be a calculated, precise, and necessary operation. She framed it in the language of her profession, a cognitive trick to keep the sheer criminality of the act at bay. This was not a break-in; it was a covert evidence-gathering exercise. She was not a burglar; she was an undercover officer on the deepest, most dangerous assignment of her life, and she had to be prepared to bend the rules to get results. The target wasn't her employer; it was an unknown adversary who had stolen her very form, and the station held the one tool that might let her see its face.\n\nThe DCI was gone, but her mind remained. She spent the rest of the day in a state of focused deprivation, fasting to keep her senses sharp, her thoughts clear. In her study, with a notepad she couldn\u2019t see herself write on, she sketched the layout of Walsall Central from memory. She knew the building better than her own house. She listed every CCTV camera, noting their fields of vision and their blind spots. She mapped the predictable patrol routes of the two night-duty officers and cross-referenced them with the cleaning crew's schedule. The station was a fortress she had helped run, and now she was drawing up the siege plans. The primary obstacle was entry. The main public entrance was a non-starter, monitored constantly. But the rear loading bay, used for deliveries and prisoner transport, offered a sliver of a possibility. The heavy roller door was automated, but the adjacent staff entrance was often propped open with a wedge by the contract cleaners during their shift, which started at a brutally early 4 a.m. One of the night-duty PCs, a young officer named Meadows, was always assigned to the ground floor, but his routine was gospel: a full circuit every thirty minutes, with a long stop in the main-floor kitchenette for a pot of tea and a browse of the sports pages at precisely 4:15. This created a window. A narrow, high-risk window, but a window nonetheless.\n\nThe next problem was the Technical Surveillance Unit itself. The TSU was on the third floor, behind another keycard-locked door. Her own card was in her wallet on the bedside table, a useless sliver of plastic. She couldn't simply tailgate a cleaner; they didn't have that level of access. Here, however, her rank and experience provided a potential key. She knew something only a handful of senior officers would know. The physical master keys, the override set for every office on a single floor, were kept in a small, grey lockbox next to the fire warden's station in the stairwell. The four-digit code for that box was not changed weekly, as official policy dictated. It was the station\u2019s original incident-response call sign from the 1980s, a piece of institutional trivia she had once used to quiz new sergeants. It was a long shot, a gamble on bureaucratic laziness, but it was the most viable option she had.\n\nAs the town\u2019s clocks ticked past 3 a.m., she began her final preparations. There would be no impulsive nakedness this time, no vulnerable bare feet on the cold ground. This was a tactical operation. She dressed in the darkest, most close-fitting clothing she owned: black yoga leggings and a long-sleeved black top. They would still be visible, a floating set of clothes moving through the dark, but her hope was that in the confusing reflections and deep shadows of the station's corridors, they might be dismissed as a trick of the eye, a discarded uniform on a chair, anything but what they actually were. She pulled on soft-soled trainers, their laces tied by a combination of muscle memory and sheer faith. She left the house as she had the night before, a ghost slipping out into the sleeping world. But this time there was no golf trolley, no destination of leisure. Her route was direct, her steps silent and filled with purpose. The two-mile walk to the town centre was a gauntlet of orange-tinted streetlights and the occasional sweep of headlights from a passing taxi or delivery van. She moved like a creature of the night, from the black shadow of one building to the next, her heart a cold, steady drum against her invisible ribs. She was DCI Eleanor Vance, and she was going to work.\n\nShe arrived opposite the station at 3:50 a.m., melting into the unlit doorway of a closed-down bakery. The building was a familiar monolith, its windows dark save for a few random squares of light on the upper floors where the 24/7 units operated. It looked inert, sleeping, but she knew the truth. It was a living organism, humming with electricity, data, and the quiet vigilance of the night shift. At 4:02, a battered Ford Fiesta pulled into the staff car park and two women in the blue tabards of a commercial cleaning company got out, laughing at some shared joke. Her pulse quickened. They disappeared around the back of the building. Ellie counted the seconds, her eyes fixed on the corner they had turned. Five minutes passed. Ten. At 4:13, she saw the unmistakable silhouette of PC Meadows amble past a ground-floor window, heading towards the kitchenette. It was time. She broke cover, a moving patch of darkness flitting across the deserted road. She reached the rear of the building and peered around the corner. The staff door was propped open with a red rubber wedge. Her plan had survived first contact with reality. Taking a final, steadying breath, Eleanor Vance, or what was left of her, slipped inside the lion's den.\n\nThe air inside was a shock, a familiar assault of old coffee, industrial-grade disinfectant, and the faint, underlying metallic tang of stress. She was in a concrete corridor that led from the loading bay to the main building. Her heart was a frantic bird in a cage she couldn't see. She moved silently, her trainers making no sound on the polished linoleum, a pair of black leggings and a top gliding through the empty space. She reached the main ground-floor corridor and paused, pressing herself into the alcove by the vending machines. In the distance, she could hear the clink of a spoon against a mug. Meadows was making his tea. She moved in the opposite direction, towards the stairwell. The keycard reader next to the stairwell door was a blank, impassive sentinel. She waited. Her wait was rewarded two minutes later by one of the cleaners, pushing a rattling janitorial cart. The woman swiped her card without breaking stride, the lock beeped green, and she pushed the door open. Ellie seized the moment, slipping through the gap just as the door began to hiss shut behind the cleaner. She was in.\n\nShe let the cleaner go up ahead, the rattling of her cart a useful cover for any tiny sound Ellie might make. On the third-floor landing, the cleaner turned right, towards the main office bullpen. Ellie turned left, into the silent, dimmer corridor that housed the specialist units. The fire warden\u2019s station was exactly where she remembered it, a small red box and a grey metal lockbox bolted to the wall. Her invisible fingers, trembling slightly, found the four small dials of the combination lock. She entered the old call sign: 8-4-7-1. She pulled the latch. It clicked open. Relief washed over her, so potent it almost buckled her knees. Inside, hanging on a small hook, was a single, brass-coloured key. The master.\n\nThe TSU office was twenty feet down the corridor. The key slid into the lock with a well-oiled smoothness. She turned it, the click of the tumblers deafening in the silence. She pushed the door open, slipped inside, and closed it gently behind her, leaving the key in the lock. The room was a tech-lover's paradise, crammed with servers, monitors, and shelves of esoteric equipment. And against the far wall stood a bank of grey metal charging cabinets. The second one from the left was labelled 'FLIR'. It was locked with a simple cabinet lock. Her luck had run out. But a DCI's luck is often self-made. She scanned the cluttered desks. On one, next to a diagram of a mobile phone jammer, was a small tray of loose change, paperclips, and a tiny, thin-bladed screwdriver from a Christmas cracker toolkit. It was flimsy, but it might be enough. She knelt by the cabinet, her heart in her throat, and inserted the tip of the screwdriver into the cheap lock. She twisted gently, feeling for the pins, a skill she'd picked up from a retired cat burglar she\u2019d once interviewed. There was a soft, pathetic snap, and the lock gave way.\n\nShe pulled open the cabinet door. Inside, nestled in custom-cut foam, was a thermal imaging camera. It looked like a prop from a science-fiction film, all black composite plastic and a large, ominous-looking lens. It was heavier than she expected. With the reverence of an archaeologist finding a sacred relic, she lifted it out. She found an empty interview room two doors down, the sort of soulless, grey box where she had spent thousands of hours breaking down the lies of others. Now she was here to find the truth about herself. She stood in the middle of the room, the camera in her unseen hands. She flicked the power switch. The device hummed to life, a small screen on the back flickering on. It showed the room in a ghostly palette of blues and purples, the lingering warmth of a computer monitor a splash of faint yellow. With a hand that shook uncontrollably, she turned the lens around, pointing it directly at the empty space where her face should be. She held her breath and looked at the screen."

And in the centre of it, a miracle of horror. A perfect, incandescent human silhouette. It blazed with heat, a fiery ghost of orange, yellow, and red, stark and undeniable against the cold background. It was her. The heat of her own blood, the warmth of her own skin, translated into a language of light she could finally see. It was the most beautiful and the most monstrous thing she had ever witnessed. A strangled sob, utterly silent to the outside world, escaped her. She was there. The data proved it. The thermal signature of a 5' 9\" woman, solid and whole and alive, stood in the middle of Interview Room 3.\n\nShe raised a hand. The glowing shape on the screen raised a hand. The fingers, rendered in tapering shades from hot orange to cooler yellow at the tips, flexed in perfect synchrony with her own. She traced the outline of her jaw, and on the screen, the fiery ghost mimicked the motion, a hand of light caressing a face of flame. For the first time in days, she was looking at herself. It wasn't the tired, fretful face of DCI Vance, but a more fundamental truth. This was the living, breathing engine beneath the surface, the thermal signature of a life in progress. The image held no judgment, bore no silvery scar from a misplaced bread knife or ache from a decade-old knee injury. It was just heat. It was just life. And it was hers.\n\nShe zoomed in, the detective's need for detail overriding the awe. The heat was distributed as she would expect: a brighter core in the torso and head, cooler tones in the extremities. Everything was normal. Except\u2026 she tilted the camera, focusing on the blazing corona that represented her head. In the very centre of her forehead, there was a small, perfectly circular void. It was not red or yellow. It was a patch of the deepest, coldest indigo, a tiny black hole in the galaxy of her own heat. It was no bigger than a ten-pence piece, but it was absolute. A dead spot. A zone of impossible cold where warmth and life should have been. Her finger, the real one, went to her forehead. She felt nothing unusual. The skin was warm to her own touch, the bone solid beneath. But the camera did not lie. It was a piece of data that made no sense, a flaw in the code of her own biology, a chilling asterisk next to the proof of her existence.\n\nA distant clang of a metal door broke the spell. Footsteps, brisk and official, echoed down the main corridor. Meadows. His break was over. Panic, cold and sharp, lanced through her. She powered down the camera, the image of the fiery ghost winking out of existence, leaving her alone in the dark once more. She had to move. Her mind, now a finely tuned machine of risk assessment, clicked through the escape plan. Wipe the camera for prints\u2014a reflex, though a useless one now. Place it back in the cabinet. Prop the broken lock in place, hoping no one would check too closely. The key in the TSU door, retrieve it. Lock the door. Back to the stairwell, replace the master key, spin the dials on the lockbox. Each action was fluid, economical, the work of a professional operating under extreme pressure. She descended the stairs, her heart pounding a syncopated rhythm against the steady tread of a pair of approaching officers. She flattened herself into a fire-extinguisher alcove, making herself small, a void in a recess. Two uniformed constables passed, complaining about the new coffee machine, their voices and solid, visible presence like blows against her fragile composure. The staff door was still propped open. She slipped through it, out of the sterile, conditioned air and into the raw, damp chill of the breaking dawn.\n\nShe didn't stop moving until she was three blocks away, huddled in the darkness of a bus shelter, the plastic smelling of stale cigarettes. She looked back at the station, a dark brick-and-glass mountain against the bruised purple sky. Her fortress. Her life's work. She had violated it, burgled it, treated it like any other target. The invisible woman in the floating black clothes had done what DCI Eleanor Vance would have sent a person to prison for ten years for. She had the information she craved, a single, terrifying image now seared onto the inside of her eyelids: a glowing woman with a hole in her head. But the knowledge had come at a cost. She had crossed a Rubicon, not just morally, but psychologically. She was no longer just hiding from the world; she was actively preying on it. The cold spot on her forehead felt mirrored by a new cold spot in her soul. She turned away from the station and began the long, silent walk home, a ghost returning to her haunt, more alone and more dangerous than when she had left."

                                        "text": "The walk home was a journey through a world that had become thin and unreal. The rising sun painted the wet streets in washes of pale gold and grey, and the first wave of early commuters began to appear, their faces grimly set for the day ahead. They were solid, opaque, wrapped in their coats and their worries, utterly oblivious to the invisible, law-breaking phantom walking among them. Ellie felt a profound and terrible detachment, as if she were watching a film of a life she used to know. The image from the FLIR camera was burned into her mind's eye, a constant, looping playback of a woman made of fire with a black hole in her head. She kept touching her forehead, a useless, compulsive gesture, seeking a physical confirmation that wasn't there. All she felt was smooth, warm skin, yet she knew with an unshakeable certainty that a spot of impossible cold was clinging to her, a tiny, internal winter that was the source of all this madness. The normal world, with its traffic and its birdsong and its bakery smells, was no longer her world. She was a thing of data and shadow now, and her only home was the sterile silence of the house waiting for her at the end of the street.\n\nOnce inside, she locked and bolted the door with a finality that felt different from the day before. The house was no longer just a prison; it had become her headquarters, a secure facility from which she could wage her silent war. The fear and despair, while still present, had been packed down, compressed by the cold, heavy weight of purpose. She didn't bother with food or drink. She went directly to the study, the floating black dressing gown a bizarre sight in the morning light, and sat down at her laptop. Her previous research felt naive, the flailings of a frightened victim. Now, she was an investigator with a lead. A single, inexplicable clue that defied all known science: the cold spot. It was the fingerprint of the phenomenon, the calling card of whatever had stolen her from the world.\n\nShe began a new, more focused assault on the internet's fortress of knowledge. She abandoned the fantastical search terms and adopted a clinical, scientific vocabulary. \"Focal endothermic biological process.\" \"Spontaneous localized cryo-genesis.\" \"A-thermal cellular necrosis.\" The searches led her into the deepest, most obscure corners of academic research. She read papers on the unique biology of icefish, whose veins ran with natural antifreeze. She skimmed theses on quantum tunnelling and its theoretical macro-scale effects. It was all brilliant, all fascinating, and all utterly useless. Science had no category for a person with a refrigerated forehead who had turned invisible. Frustration mounted, a hot, dry pressure behind her eyes. The answer wasn't in established science. Established science was for a world that followed the rules. Her world had thrown the rulebook into a furnace.\n\nThe thought made her pause. She had been thinking like a scientist. She needed to think like a cop. Cops don't just study the rules; they study the exceptions, the anomalies, the people who break the rules. She opened her remote access to the HOLMES database again, her fingers moving with renewed speed. The Solihull report. The man who felt a cold spot pass by him. It had been a throwaway detail, a piece of atmospheric color in a witness statement. Now, it was everything. She pulled up the full case file on the burglary at the home of Mr. Alistair Finch. It was as thin as she remembered. No witnesses, no forensics, no forced entry. Just an elderly, recently widowed man, a retired watchmaker, who insisted someone had been in his house and stolen a single, specific photograph of his late wife from the mantelpiece. The responding officer had noted Finch was \"distressed but lucid\" and had made a particular point of the cold he had felt, dismissing it as \"likely a draught.\" But Ellie knew better. It wasn't a draught. It was a signature.\n\nThe connection hit her with the force of a physical impact, winding her. The cold spot. The inexplicable burglary. The stolen photograph of a lost loved one. Her own descent had begun after a period of intense, grinding loneliness, a life narrowed to a single, all-consuming point. Mr. Finch was recently widowed. He had lost his other half. A photograph, a memory of a person who was gone, was the only thing taken. It was a pattern, not of a crime, but of a condition. A pattern of profound loss manifesting as a physical disappearance, a fading from a world that no longer felt complete. Was this what happened? Did the universe simply edit you out when a part of you was already gone? The thought was both terrifying and horribly, poetically logical. And if she was right, then Alistair Finch wasn't a victim of a crime she needed to solve. He was either a fellow traveller in this nightmare, another ghost in the machine, or he was something else. He was Patient Zero. The original ripple. She had to find him. Not to arrest him, not to question him as a suspect, but to stand with him, one invisible soul to another, and ask him the only question that now mattered: How did this start, and how in God's name do we make it stop?"

                                        "text": "## Chapter 6\n\nThe transition from a DCI to a full-time conspirator against reality was surprisingly seamless. The same skills applied. Finding Alistair Finch was a matter of simple, illicit procedure. His name and the Solihull address were in the HOLMES file. A further, deeper search using back-end access she was definitely not authorised to use from her living room yielded his date of birth, his NHS number, and a grainy, ten-year-old driving licence photo. He was a small, neat man with kind eyes and the slightly bewildered expression of someone who had just been asked a complicated question. He looked like a grandfather, not a phantom. He looked harmless. But Ellie knew from bitter experience that the most dangerous people were often the ones who looked the most ordinary. The question was, dangerous to whom?\n\nGetting to Solihull was a logistical nightmare that consumed her morning. She couldn\u2019t drive; a driverless car navigating the M6 would attract the wrong kind of attention. Public transport was a terrifying prospect, a chaotic ballet of bodies and bags she would have to navigate by memory and luck. But it was the only way. She dressed again in her black uniform of invisibility, adding a thin, dark beanie hat that floated just above her head, a bizarre halo of anonymity. The bus to Walsall station was an ordeal of sensory overload. The press of bodies she couldn't see but could feel brushing against her, the cacophony of conversations, the smell of cheap perfume and damp coats. She stood rigidly in the designated wheelchair space, a vacant cube of air that people instinctively avoided, praying no one would fall into her.\n\nThe train was worse. She paid for her ticket in cash at a machine, a floating hand feeding notes into a slot, a manoeuvre that left her sweating with anxiety. She found a seat in an almost-empty carriage, but it soon filled up. A young man with headphones sat next to her, his leg occasionally brushing against her own invisible one, each contact a jolt of pure panic. She spent the entire thirty-minute journey to Birmingham New Street holding a newspaper she\u2019d lifted from a stand, holding it up in front of her non-existent face. It was a flimsy shield, a floating rectangle of print that served as a 'do not disturb' sign to the visible world. It was a pathetic piece of camouflage, but it worked. No one tried to take her seat. No one looked too closely at the paper that seemed to be reading itself. People saw what they expected to see, and no one expected to see a ghost commuting.\n\nFrom Birmingham, another train, another bus, and then a long walk through the leafy, affluent suburbs of Solihull. The difference from Walsall was stark. The roads were wide, the houses set back behind manicured lawns and expensive cars. It was a world of comfortable, visible success. Alistair Finch lived on a quiet cul-de-sac in a modest but impeccably maintained semi-detached house, its front garden a riot of perfectly tended roses. It was the house of a man with time on his hands and a deep-seated need for order. It was also the house directly opposite one that was up for sale, its windows vacant, a 'For Sale' sign leaning drunkenly in the overgrown lawn. It was the perfect observation post. A minute of fumbling at the back gate with a paperclip from her pocket\u2014another old trick from the cat burglar\u2014and she was in, slipping through the unlocked patio doors into the dusty, echoing silence of an empty home.\n\nShe set up her vigil in the front bedroom, the air thick with the smell of old carpets and decaying plaster. Through the grimy window, she had a clear, uninterrupted view of Alistair Finch\u2019s front door and living room window. And then she waited. The familiar, soul-crushing boredom of a stakeout settled over her. The only difference was that this time, she was the sole member of the team, and her target was a potentially invisible, retired watchmaker. The hours crawled by. A postman came and went. A neighbour collected a parcel. Nothing. The house remained still, the curtains partially drawn, no signs of life within. Doubt, cold and insidious, began to creep in. Had she been wrong? Was this a wild goose chase based on a single word in a witness statement? Was Finch even there? Maybe he had faded completely, a human evaporation.\n\nThen, at just after four in the afternoon, as the light began to fade, she saw it. A flicker of movement in the living room window. A light switched on, illuminating a room that was as neat and ordered as the garden outside. It was a comfortable, traditional room: a floral-patterned sofa, a polished wooden sideboard, and a mantelpiece that was conspicuously empty save for a single, ornate carriage clock. There was no sign of Mr. Finch. Ellie pressed herself closer to the dusty glass, her invisible breath fogging a patch she couldn't see. She waited, her senses on a knife-edge. The kettle whistled in a distant part of the house, the sound faint but clear. She heard the soft click of a cupboard door. And then she saw it.\n\nOn a small table next to an empty armchair, a bone china teacup and saucer sat waiting. As Ellie watched, mesmerized, the teacup lifted into the air. It tilted, as if held by an unseen hand, then moved smoothly across the room towards the kitchen. It disappeared from view for a moment, then returned, now steaming gently, a pale cloud of vapour rising from the unseen liquid within. The floating cup settled back onto its saucer with a gentle, familiar clink. Then a sugar bowl, its lid lifting of its own accord, a spoon dipping inside and stirring the contents of the cup before replacing the lid. The spoon then rested itself neatly on the saucer. It was all so calm, so methodical, so terrifyingly normal.\n\nEllie sank to the floor of the empty bedroom, a silent scream trapped in her throat. She was not alone. The faint statistical shimmer in the HOLMES database, the cold spot, the stolen photograph\u2014it was all real. Alistair Finch was like her. He was another ghost, another hole in the world, quietly making himself a cup of tea. A wave of elation, so powerful it was dizzying, washed over her, followed immediately by a tidal wave of terror and pity. She wasn't the only one. But that meant this wasn't just her problem. It was a condition. A plague. A quiet, creeping subtraction of souls from the fabric of the universe. She looked back at the window, at the armchair where a man she couldn't see was now presumably enjoying his tea. She had found her Patient Zero. The first thread in the conspiracy. But the elation died as a new, impossibly complex question took its place. She had found him. But how in God's name do you introduce yourself to a ghost?"

To knock on his door would be to announce a floating set of clothes, an act of such profound weirdness it would likely trigger a heart attack in a man of his age. To shout from the street was to invite the attention of the entire neighbourhood and a swift response from the local police, a scenario too layered with irony to contemplate. No, this had to be handled like the most delicate of source-handling operations: with patience, with caution, and with an undeniable, secret proof of shared experience.\n\nFor the rest of the afternoon, she did nothing but watch. It was the purest form of surveillance she had ever undertaken. From her grimy window, she observed the quiet, invisible life of Alistair Finch. She saw a newspaper lift from the doormat and float to the armchair, where its pages turned with methodical slowness. She watched as a duster, seemingly of its own volition, traced the surfaces of the polished sideboard, moving with the practiced, gentle strokes of someone who took pride in his home. She saw the carriage clock on the mantelpiece being wound, the key turning in the air with a series of tiny, precise clicks. He was a man of routine, a man clinging to the mundane scaffolding of a normal life in a desperate attempt to feel real. Every quiet, ghostly action was a testament to a long and lonely battle fought in secret. He wasn't a phantom; he was a widower, a retired watchmaker, going about his day. The tragedy of it was a lead weight in Ellie\u2019s chest.\n\nAs dusk settled over the quiet cul-de-sac, she knew she could not wait any longer. An idea, born of her DCI\u2019s tradecraft, had crystallised. She needed a dead drop, a message that could be delivered without contact and replied to without a meeting. She turned from the window and began a systematic search of the abandoned house. The place had been picked clean of anything valuable, but in a drawer in the kitchen, among dried-up rubber bands and a single, rusty key, she found what she needed: a promotional notepad from a local estate agent and a cheap ballpoint pen that still, miraculously, worked. She returned to the gloom of the upstairs bedroom, sat on the dusty floorboards, and began to compose the most important message of her life. Her invisible hand felt for the paper, her fingers gripping the pen. It was a bizarre sensation, watching the pen move across the page, seemingly guided by an unseen force, leaving a trail of blue ink in its wake. She wrote with a brutal economy, choosing words that would be meaningless to anyone else but a thunderclap of recognition to him.\n\n\"I know,\" she wrote. \"The cold spot. The photograph. I am the same. You are not alone. If you understand this, and if you are willing to communicate, leave a yellow duster tied to the front doorknob tomorrow before noon. Do not try to find me. I will find you.\"\n\nThe note felt heavy in her hand, a small, paper rectangle containing the weight of two impossible lives. The instruction was a classic police move: simple, specific, and designed to confirm receipt and willingness to engage, all while maintaining control of the situation. It put the ball firmly in his court. She waited until the street was utterly dark and silent, the houses blank-faced and sleeping. The walk across the road was the longest of her life. Every rustle of a leaf, every distant hum of a car engine, felt like an alarm. She reached his front door, her heart hammering a frantic, silent rhythm. She bent down, her invisible fingers pushing the folded note through the letterbox. It landed on the bristly doormat inside with a soft, definitive whisper. The act was done. There was no taking it back. She retreated to the dark sanctuary of the empty house, her eyes locked on the front door of Alistair Finch, and began the second, more torturous, phase of her wait.\n\nThe night was endless. She did not sleep. She sat by the window, a sentinel in the dark, watching for any sign. A light flicking on. A curtain twitching. Nothing. The house remained as still and silent as a tomb. Dawn broke, grey and reluctant, and still there was no movement. A new fear began to gnaw at her. Had he not found it? Had she misjudged him completely? What if he had panicked, called the police to report a threatening note, bringing the whole visible world crashing down on their secret? Her carefully constructed plan suddenly felt like a fool\u2019s gamble. Then, at shortly after 8 a.m., she saw the newspaper float up from the doormat as it had the day before. But this time, it stopped. It hovered in mid-air for a long, pregnant moment before dropping back to the mat with a soft rustle. Something had changed. He had seen her note.\n\nShe watched, holding a breath she couldn't see, as a patch of empty air by the door seemed to shimmer with indecision. She could almost feel his shock, his terror, his disbelief, radiating across the street. She imagined him standing there, his invisible hand clutching his chest, his world, which had already been turned upside down, now spun on its axis once more. For a full hour, nothing happened. The newspaper lay where it had fallen. The house was utterly still. Ellie\u2019s hope began to curdle into despair. He was going to ignore it. He was too scared, too insular, too broken by his long solitude to risk contact. Her gamble had failed. She was still alone. She was about to turn away from the window, to admit defeat and begin the long, lonely journey back to her own prison, when she saw it. A flash of yellow in the dim hallway, visible through the frosted glass panel of the front door. The doorknob, which had been dull brass, now had a small, bright yellow knot tied around it. A yellow duster. He had answered. He understood. He was willing to talk. Ellie sank back into the shadows of the empty room, a wave of relief so profound it felt like a physical blow washing over her. She was not alone. There was another ghost in the world, and he was waiting for her to make the next move."

He had answered. For the first time since her world had dissolved, Ellie was not an anomaly of one. There was a population of two. The implications were staggering, but for a single, precious moment, all she felt was the simple, profound comfort of no longer being utterly alone. The moment passed, and the DCI took over once more. Phase one, establishing contact and willingness to communicate, was complete. Phase two, the meeting itself, now required a new level of planning and risk.\n\nShe didn't waste time. She retrieved the notepad and pen and wrote a second message, her hand steadier this time. The floating pen moved with more authority across the page. \"Thank you. We need to talk. The empty house opposite, number 14. Tonight, after midnight. The back door will be unlocked. I know this is difficult. It is for me, too. But we have to understand what is happening to us.\" She folded it, and as night fell for the second time on the quiet Solihull street, she repeated the covert journey across the road, posting the next piece of her impossible puzzle through his letterbox. There would be no signal this time. Only an act of faith. He would either come, or he would not.\n\nReturning to the cold, derelict house, she began to prepare her interview room. She found two rickety dining chairs in the downstairs room, their legs caked in dust. She dragged them into the centre of the empty living room, wiping them down with the sleeve of her floating black top. She arranged them facing each other, about six feet apart. It looked like a set for some absurd minimalist play. The stage was set for a conversation between two people who couldn't be seen. As the hours ticked by towards midnight, a new kind of anxiety began to build. She had forced this, engineered it. She was dragging a reclusive, grieving old man out of the fragile shell of routine he had built and into the terrifying unknown she now inhabited. What right did she have? The question was answered by the memory of the FLIR image, the fiery ghost with the black hole in its head. She had every right. They were both sick with the same impossible disease, and isolation was no cure.\n\nA few minutes past midnight, she heard it. A soft, hesitant creak from the back of the house. The sound of the patio door sliding open, then closing with a gentle click. Footsteps, slow and shuffling, on the dusty floorboards of the kitchen. A man\u2019s breathing, shallow and tight with fear. He was here. He had come. Ellie stood by her designated chair in the living room, her own heart a frantic, silent drum. The footsteps paused at the doorway. She could feel his presence, a subtle compression of the air, the faint, almost imperceptible scent of old books and soap. He was standing right there, a man-shaped column of terror and curiosity.\n\n\"Mr. Finch?\" she said, her voice low and steady, though it cost her a monumental effort to keep it from trembling.\n\nA sharp, startled intake of breath from the doorway. A long silence, and then a voice, thin and reedy, but with a watchmaker's precision in its diction. \"How\u2026 how did you know my name?\"\n\n\"I'm a police officer,\" she said, the words tasting strange and half-true in her mouth. \"It's what I do. Or what I used to do. My name is Eleanor Vance.\"\n\n\"A police officer,\" he repeated, the words full of a quiet, defeated wonder. He took another shuffling step into the room. \"I\u2026 I did not take anything else. Only the photograph. I don't know why I ran with it. I was so frightened.\"\n\n\"I know,\" Ellie said, a wave of empathy washing over her. Her theory had been right. He wasn't a thief; he was a victim, just like her. \"I'm not here about the photograph, Mr. Finch. I'm here because of this.\" An idea, a sudden gamble to build trust, seized her. With a decisive set of movements, she pulled the black top over her head and let it fall to the floor. She kicked off her trainers, then stripped off the leggings and the rest of her clothes, dropping them into a small, dark pile beside her chair. The cold of the room hit her instantly, a familiar shock. \"I think we should talk on equal terms.\"\n\nThere was another long, stunned silence from the doorway. She heard a soft rustle of fabric, then another. A moment later, he spoke again, his voice closer now, and thick with an emotion she couldn't quite place. \"My God,\" he whispered. \"You too. You really are.\" He shuffled forward and with a soft sigh, the dining chair opposite her creaked as it took his invisible weight. The meeting had begun. They were two ghosts in an abandoned house, stripped bare and shivering in the dark, and for the first time in a very long time, they were not alone."

They were two voids in the darkness, defined only by the creak of the cheap wooden chairs and the palpable aura of their shared terror. It was an intimacy so profound and so strange that it transcended all norms of human contact. Ellie, trained to read every twitch and nuance of a suspect\u2019s face, was now flying blind, relying on nothing but the cadence of a stranger\u2019s breath and the weight of the silence between his words. She was the one who had engineered this impossible summit, and so the onus was on her to navigate it.\n\n\"When did it start for you?\" she asked, her voice deliberately calm, the tone of a doctor taking a patient\u2019s history. \"The first time you noticed something was wrong.\"\n\nThe chair opposite her creaked as the unseen man shifted. When he spoke, his voice was thin but steady, each word placed with the precision of a watchmaker setting a jewel. \"Six months and four days after my Mary passed,\" he said, the statement devoid of self-pity, a simple declaration of fact. \"I was washing my hands at the kitchen sink. The water was very hot, and I looked down to see the pattern of the porcelain right through the back of my hand. I thought I was losing my mind. The grief, you know. I thought it had finally broken me. It came and went for a few weeks, like a faulty connection. Then one morning, I woke up, and\u2026 there was just a depression in the pillow where my head should have been. I haven't seen myself since.\"\n\nHe paused, and Ellie could hear a faint, wet sniffle in the darkness. \"That was eighteen months ago. I adapted. The routines\u2026 winding the clocks, making the tea, tending the roses\u2026 they are my anchor. If I keep doing the things Alistair Finch would do, then perhaps I still am him.\"\n\nHis quiet confession resonated with a truth that Ellie felt deep in her invisible bones. She had her golf, he had his clocks. They had both clung to the rituals of their former lives as a bulwark against the encroaching madness. \"For me, it was different,\" she found herself saying, the admission surprising her. \"My marriage ended years ago. The job\u2026 it ate everything. My life got smaller and smaller until it was just the work. I think I was already a ghost, in a way. I had lost\u2026 myself. This,\" she gestured to the empty space where her body was, \"just made it official.\"\n\nThe shared diagnosis hung in the air between them: they were both victims of a profound and hollow-ing loss. The silence that followed was different, less fraught with fear and more with a sombre, shared understanding. They were two sides of the same coin. This was the moment to push, to introduce her one piece of hard evidence. \"Alistair,\" she said, the use of his first name a deliberate step towards a fragile alliance. \"I did something\u2026 reckless. I broke into my old police station. They have equipment, thermal imaging cameras. I needed to see if I was really there.\" She described the journey, the break-in, her voice a flat, professional monotone, and then she described the result. \"It was all there. A complete thermal image. A woman made of fire. But there was something else. Something wrong.\"\n\nShe lifted her unseen hand and pointed to her own forehead. \"Right here. In the centre. There was a hole in the heat. A perfect, dark circle of absolute cold. A dead spot, where there should have been warmth. I can't feel it, not in the normal way, but it's there. It's the source, I think.\" She leaned forward, the front legs of her chair groaning in protest. \"Alistair\u2026 I need to know. Do you have one?\"\n\nThe silence that answered her was the most profound yet. It stretched for so long that she began to think he had simply vanished, evaporated from the chair opposite her. When he finally spoke, his voice was a choked whisper, freighted with a horror that made the hairs on her invisible arms stand on end. \"The anchor,\" he breathed. \"That's what I call it. I can feel it. Not like you feel a headache. It's\u2026 a pressure. A cold, heavy weight, right behind the eyes. I assumed it was just me. A tumour. The physical cause of the madness.\"\n\n\"You can feel it?\" Ellie asked, her professional calm shattered. This was new data. \"What does it feel like?\"\n\nAlistair took a deep, shuddering breath. \"It feels like a drain,\" he said, the words tumbling out now, a confession held back for eighteen long months. \"At first, it was just the cold. But over time\u2026 it's like it's feeding. Not on my body. On my thoughts. On\u2026 me. My memories of Mary. When this started, I could remember every detail of her face, the sound of her laugh, the way she smelled of lavender. Now\u2026 now I have to look at her photograph just to be sure of the colour of her eyes. It's taking her from me, piece by piece. The cold spot is erasing her.\"\n\nThe simple horror of his words struck Ellie with the force of a physical blow. This wasn't a static condition. It was progressive. It wasn't just about the loss of a physical body; that was merely the opening act. The true horror was the slow, systematic erasure of the soul. Her burnout, her all-consuming job\u2014the cold spot was feeding on that, too. She thought of her golf swing, the one pure thing she had left. Was it taking that? Was it consuming the memories of her parents, of a childhood she barely thought about anymore? The invisibility wasn't the disease. It was a symptom of a much more terrifying process. They weren't just disappearing. They were being consumed."

It reframed her entire condition, transforming it from a bizarre physical state into a terminal diagnosis of the soul. Ellie felt a chill so profound it seemed to emanate from the cold spot on her own forehead, spreading outwards through her invisible limbs. This entity, this phenomenon, wasn't just hiding them; it was hollowing them out, using them as fuel. The job that had consumed her life now felt like a long, slow marination, preparing her for the feast. The memories of her ex-husband, Graham, were already faded, the good times bleached out by years of resentment and neglect. Could she still picture her father\u2019s face clearly? The thought sent a jolt of pure ice through her. She tried, and the image that came to mind was blurry, indistinct, a photograph left out in the sun for too long.\n\n\"It's a parasite,\" she heard herself say, the words hard and clipped, the DCI finding footing even on this shifting ground of ontological terror. \"It anchors itself in a place of loss, of vacancy, and it feeds on what's left. Your grief for your wife. My\u2026 burnout. It's consuming the very things that made us who we are.\" She stood up, the chair scraping against the floorboards with a jarring screech. The cold of the room was nothing compared to the cold fury now building inside her. She began to pace, a ripple of disturbed air moving through the gloom. \"This isn't a passive state, Alistair. It's an attack. And if it's an attack, we can fight back.\"\n\nThe chair opposite creaked, a sound of immense weariness. \"Fight back?\" Alistair's voice was heavy with the weight of eighteen months of solitary defeat. \"How? I've spent every single day fighting. I talk to Mary. I say her name out loud a hundred times a day. I force myself to remember our first holiday, the day we bought this house. I tend her roses, I wind the clock she loved. I surround myself with her, with us. But it's like trying to hold water in a sieve. Every day, a little more is gone. The cold place\u2026 it's stronger when I am idle. When I sit and let my mind drift, I can feel it\u2026 pulling. It is weakest when I am working. When I have a watch to repair, when my focus is absolute on a gear, a spring, a single tiny screw. But I'm running out of watches.\"\n\nHis confession was a tactical briefing from the front line of a long, losing war. His strategy had been defensive, a desperate reinforcement of existing memories. It was a noble effort, but it was doomed to fail. You couldn't save a library by re-reading the books while an arsonist was at work in the stacks. Ellie stopped her pacing, her mind racing, connecting the data points. Alistair\u2019s workshop. Her own fleeting moment of pure, unadulterated presence on the golf course. The clean crack of the drive, the singular focus on the ball. In those moments, she hadn't been thinking about her past, her losses, her job. She had been utterly, completely in the present.\n\n\"That's it,\" she said, her voice electric with a dawning, terrifying hope. \"You're right. It's weakest when your focus is absolute. You've been trying to save the past, Alistair. That's the battle it wants you to fight, because it will always win. It feeds on memory. We can't beat it by looking backwards. We have to starve it. We have to stop giving it what it wants.\" She turned to face the empty chair where he sat, her own invisible form radiating a new, fierce energy. \"We have to create. We have to build. We need new memories, new experiences, new purpose. Things so new and so powerful that they overwhelm the old losses. We can\u2019t just be the ghosts of a watchmaker and a cop. We have to become something else. Something it can't digest.\""

                                        "text": "Alistair did not respond immediately. The creak of his chair was a sound of profound doubt, the protest of old wood under the weight of a man who had been sitting with his ghosts for too long. When he finally spoke, his voice was frayed, stripped of its earlier precision. \"Become something else? But\u2026 I am Alistair Finch. I am Mary\u2019s husband. That is the only thing that has kept me here. Every clock I wind, every rose I prune, it is an act of defiance, a statement that I am still the man she loved. If I abandon that\u2026 if I try to become 'something else'\u2026 what if I lose him completely? What if that\u2019s all that is left of me, and I let it go? Then the cold place wins. It will have taken everything.\"\n\nHis logic was the flawless, circular reasoning of a long-term prisoner. He had defined the walls of his cell so completely that he could no longer imagine a world outside them. Ellie understood it instantly. It was the same logic that had kept her chained to her desk, sacrificing her life to a job that had stopped giving anything back long ago. Her new idea was not just a strategy; it was a form of heresy against the faith of their shared suffering.\n\n\"No,\" she said, her voice firm, cutting through his weary resignation. \"You misunderstand. This isn't about letting go. It's about building a wall. Think of it, Alistair. You said it yourself, it's a parasite. It's feeding on your memories of Mary. Your beautiful, precious memories. Your current strategy is to sit in the larder with it, guarding the food while it eats. You're trying to outlast it, but it has an infinite appetite. We can't win that way.\" She took an invisible step closer to him, her presence marked only by a slight shift in the air. \"We don't abandon the past. We build a fortress around it. A fortress made of new things, new skills, new moments. We make ourselves so busy, so focused on the present, so full of *now*, that the parasite starves. The cold spot shrinks because it has nothing to feed on. We don't forget Mary. We save her. We save what's left of her by building a life so vibrant and so real that the ghost inside us can't get a foothold.\"\n\nThe metaphor, blunt and militaristic, seemed to land. There was another long silence, but this one felt different. It was the silence of calculation, of a watchmaker considering a new and complex mechanism. Ellie could almost hear the gears turning in his mind as he weighed eighteen months of lonely, defensive grief against this sudden, aggressive, and terrifying new proposal. He was a man of logic, of systems. She had given him a new system to consider.\n\n\"A fortress,\" he murmured, testing the word. \"So we\u2026 what? Go out into the world? A world we cannot be seen in, a world that would lock us up if they knew? It is impossible. I have not left my house in over a year, except to put out the bins.\"\n\n\"We start small,\" Ellie countered immediately, seizing the flicker of possibility. \"We start right here. In this room. We prove the theory. We do something together. Something that requires focus. Something creative. A new, shared memory that belongs only to us, the two ghosts. Something it cannot possibly have a taste for.\" She looked around the derelict living room, her eyes adjusting to the deep gloom. Her gaze fell on the fireplace, a soot-stained maw with a broken hearth, its slate tiles cracked and displaced. \"We fix that,\" she said, pointing an invisible finger. \"The hearth. It\u2019s broken. We'll need tools, cement, something to mix it in. Your workshop, you must have what we need. We'll plan it. We'll sneak the supplies over. We'll work together, coordinating our movements, solving the problems. We will take this broken thing and we will make it whole again. It's a pointless, absurd task. But it's ours. It will be the first brick in our fortress.\"\n\nThe idea was utterly mad. Two naked, invisible people, planning to conduct clandestine home repairs in a derelict house as a form of metaphysical warfare against a soul-eating parasite. And yet, in the profound strangeness of their situation, it possessed a spark of perfect, insane logic. Alistair was quiet for a moment longer. Then, for the first time, Ellie heard a new sound from the opposite chair. It was a dry, rusty chuckle, a sound of disbelief at war with a dawning sense of wonder. \"A police officer and a watchmaker,\" he said softly. \"Turning into\u2026 builders. Mary would have found that very, very funny.\" He sighed, a long, slow exhalation that seemed to carry some of the weight of his solitude with it. The chair creaked as he stood up. \"Alright, Detective Chief Inspector Vance. Let us build your fortress. Tell me, what is the best way to steal a bag of cement?\""

                                        "text": "## Chapter 8\n\nThe absurdity of Alistair\u2019s question, spoken with such genuine curiosity, hung in the cold air like a puff of condensation. For a moment, the sheer, mad reality of their situation crested over Ellie, and she almost laughed. Here she was, a Detective Chief Inspector, a pillar of law and order, being asked for advice on the best way to procure stolen building materials. The fortress, it seemed, would be built on a foundation of petty crime. She pushed the hysterical laughter down, marshalling her thoughts back into the familiar, comforting channels of operational planning. This was no different from planning a raid, only the objective was constructive rather than destructive, and her entire team consisted of one invisible, retired watchmaker.\n\n\"We don't steal,\" she stated, the ingrained habit of her profession asserting itself. \"We strategically re-appropriate abandoned assets. There are dozens of small building sites dotted around. Unsecured, poorly lit. We could find a loose bag of cement, some off-cuts of slate. It's lower risk.\"\n\nAlistair made a soft, thoughtful sound in the darkness. \"The risk of discovery is lower, but the risk of failure is higher. We could spend all night searching and find nothing of the right quality. My Mary, she always said, 'If a job is worth doing, it is worth doing properly.' There is a twenty-four-hour DIY superstore just off the A45. It will be mostly empty at this time of night. They will have exactly what we need, in a single location. The risk is higher, but the reward is guaranteed. It is a more\u2026 elegant solution.\"\n\nEllie was taken aback. The quiet, grieving watchmaker was proposing a B&E at a superstore with more logistical cunning than half the sergeants she had commanded. He wasn't just a victim; he was a meticulous planner. She was the strategist, but he, it seemed, was the mission architect. A flicker of deep respect, the kind she felt for a truly competent colleague, sparked within her. \"Alright, Alistair,\" she conceded. \"An elegant solution it is. But how do we get there and, more importantly, how do we transport a twenty-kilo bag of cement without someone noticing it's floating?\"\n\n\"I have a car,\" he said simply, as if it were the most obvious thing in the world. \"A 1971 Morris Minor. My father bought it new. I keep it in perfect working order. It is\u2026 a connection to him. We will need a trolley from the store. You, I suspect, are stronger than I am. You will lift the heavy items onto the trolley. I will push it. To an observer, it will appear to be a runaway trolley. Unlikely, but not impossible. Once at the checkout, we will simply\u2026 walk past. The cashier at that time of night is usually a young man more interested in his phone than his job. With luck, he will not even look up.\"\n\nThe plan was audacious, riddled with a thousand points of potential failure, and yet it was the only plan they had. An hour later, they were standing in Alistair\u2019s garage. It was a complete contrast to her own cluttered, neglected space. This was a sanctuary of order. Tools hung on a pegboard in a perfect, gleaming tableau. Jars of screws and nails were neatly labelled. And under a dust sheet sat the car. When Alistair pulled the cover off, Ellie, even in her state of invisible anxiety, felt a small gasp of admiration. The Morris Minor was immaculate, its dark green paint polished to a deep lustre, its chrome trim gleaming. It was a museum piece, a perfect fossil from a bygone era. The driver\u2019s side door opened, seemingly on its own, and the seat depressed with a soft sigh of leather as Alistair settled himself behind the wheel. Ellie slipped into the passenger seat, the unfamiliar sensation of the curved bench seat a strange comfort.\n\nThe journey was the most surreal experience of Ellie\u2019s life. The engine coughed to life with a surprisingly throaty roar, and the large, thin steering wheel began to turn, guided by an unseen hand. They pulled out of the quiet cul-de-sac, a ghost car gliding through the sleeping suburbs of Solihull. To any late-night observer, it would have been a sight to curdle the blood. Ellie sat rigidly, her eyes scanning the road, calling out directions from a map app on her phone, which floated in the space between them. They were a bizarre parody of a married couple on a road trip, their conversation stripped down to the bare, procedural essentials. \"Left at the next roundabout, Alistair.\" \"There's a police car behind us, slow down.\" The squad car cruised past them without a second glance, its occupants oblivious to the two law-breaking phantoms in the vintage automobile beside them.\n\nThe car park of 'DIY Universe' was a vast, orange-lit expanse of empty tarmac. They parked in a dark corner, the little Morris Minor looking like a lost toy amongst the few battered transit vans belonging to the night staff. Inside, the store was a cathedral of silence, broken only by the hum of the fluorescent lights and the distant beep of a reversing forklift. A lone, bored-looking teenager was stacking shelves three aisles away, lost in the tinny beat escaping his headphones. Alistair located a flatbed trolley, and with a soft rumble of wheels, their operation began. They moved with a silent, coordinated grace that surprised them both, two invisible forces working in perfect tandem. Alistair guided the trolley, his unseen hands resting on the bar, while Ellie moved ahead, a silent scout.\n\nThey reached the building materials aisle, a cavernous corridor of plasterboard, timber, and pallets stacked high with bags of cement and plaster. Ellie located the correct type of tile adhesive and a small bag of grey grout, placing them on the trolley with soft, careful movements. Then came the cement. The twenty-kilo bag was dense and awkward. Bracing her invisible feet, Ellie squatted, wrapped her arms around the thick paper sack, and lifted. The strain was immense, a deep pull in her back and shoulders. The bag rose from the pallet, a solid, branded object levitating in the sterile air. She shuffled backwards, muscles screaming, and lowered it onto the flatbed with a muffled whump that sounded like a cannon shot in the stillness. At the far end of the aisle, the shelf-stacker paused, pulling one headphone out, his head cocked.\n\nHe turned, his gaze sweeping down the aisle towards them. For a heart-stopping moment, his eyes seemed to pass right over the spot where the floating bag of cement had just settled onto a seemingly self-propelled trolley. His gaze was vacant, unfocused. He saw nothing, because he expected to see nothing. But then he started to walk towards them, a slow, ambling gait, his eyes now fixed on a display of spirit levels just beyond their position. There was nowhere to run, nowhere to hide. They were trapped. Ellie froze, every muscle tensed. Beside her, she heard Alistair make a tiny, choked sound of pure panic. In that split second, her DCI\u2019s brain, trained for chaos, took over. She couldn't move the trolley, but she could move something else. With a swift, silent movement, she reached out to a tall, precarious display of brightly coloured spray-paint cans. Her invisible fingers found a single, loose can on the top tier. She gave it a sharp, decisive nudge.\n\nThe can of 'Racing Green' fell with a series of loud, dramatic clatters, bouncing off the shelves below before hitting the concrete floor with a final, echoing crash. The shelf-stacker jumped, startled, his attention snapping instantly to the source of the noise. He swore under his breath and changed course, heading towards the rogue can of paint with the weary sigh of a man profoundly wronged by the universe. The window was open. \"Now,\" Ellie breathed. Alistair needed no further encouragement. He pushed the trolley with a newfound urgency, its wheels rumbling as they made their escape down the aisle and towards the blissful anonymity of the main thoroughfare.\n\nThey bypassed the single open checkout, its cashier staring intently at a glowing phone screen, and pushed their illicit haul out into the cold night air. The relief upon reaching the car was so intense it left Ellie feeling light-headed. They loaded the boot in a frantic, silent rush, the heavy bag of cement a dead weight that felt like victory. As they drove away, leaving the glowing superstore behind them, neither of them spoke. They were no longer just victims. They were conspirators, partners in a crime that no one else in the world could possibly understand. Back in the derelict house, they piled the fruits of their raid on the dusty floor beside the broken hearth. The bag of cement, the tub of adhesive, a new trowel, and a small stack of dark grey slate tiles. It wasn't just a pile of building materials. It was the first tangible proof of their alliance, a shared secret made solid. It was the first brick."

                                        "text": "## Chapter 8\n\nThe glow of their shared, absurd victory lasted until the first grey light of dawn seeped through the grime of the windows, turning their haul from a trove of triumphant plunder into a drab, inert pile of building supplies. The silence of the house reasserted itself, and with it, the daunting reality of the task they had set themselves. Ellie looked at the bag of cement, a solid, tangible object, and felt a familiar wave of pre-operation anxiety. It was one thing to plan a mission, another entirely to execute it, especially when the principal challenge was the non-existence of the operatives themselves. The empty space beside her, where Alistair stood, seemed to hum with a similar tension. Their heist had been an act of pure, adrenaline-fueled momentum. This, the building, would be a slow, painstaking exercise in a new and terrifying kind of trust.\n\n\"Right,\" Ellie said, her voice sounding unnaturally loud in the morning stillness. \"First, we need a plan. A system. We can't see each other\u2019s hands. We can't judge distance visually. Every single movement will have to be choreographed and communicated. It\u2019s going to be like defusing a bomb in the dark, only with more dust.\"\n\nAlistair, ever the pragmatist, had clearly been thinking along the same lines. \"Verbal cues,\" he stated, his voice regaining its focused, watchmaker\u2019s tone. \"We will have to narrate our every action. We define a workspace on the floor, a 'red zone'. Nothing enters or leaves that zone without a clear verbal announcement. 'I am placing the trowel on the left edge of the zone.' 'My hand is now entering the zone from above to retrieve the trowel.' It will be slow. It will be tedious. But it will prevent us from injuring one another or ruining the materials.\"\n\nAnd so, their strange ballet began. The first hour was a masterpiece of clumsy frustration. They found a battered plastic bucket in the overgrown garden to use for mixing. The simple act of pouring cement powder into it was a nerve-shredding ordeal. Ellie, being the stronger, lifted the heavy bag while Alistair guided the opening over the bucket, their commands a frantic, whispered dialogue. \"Lower by an inch, Eleanor!\" \"Is that enough?\" \"Too much, too fast! It's going everywhere!\" A cloud of grey dust erupted, making them both cough, their invisible lungs protesting the fine powder. They sounded like two ghosts choking on their own ethereal dust. The floor around the bucket was soon covered in a fine grey film, a testament to their initial incompetence.\n\nAdding the water was even worse. Alistair held the bucket steady while Ellie, using a dirty milk bottle they\u2019d rinsed in a puddle, attempted to pour. Her first attempt was a torrent that sent a wave of grey water sloshing over the side. \"Gently!\" Alistair cried out, a sharp edge of panic in his voice as the cold, gritty liquid splashed against his unseen shins. Ellie froze, mortified. \"I'm sorry,\" she snapped, her frustration aimed more at herself than him. For a moment, the fragile alliance wavered, the sheer difficulty of their task threatening to drive a wedge between them. Then Alistair sighed, a long, weary sound. \"No, my apologies, Eleanor. I am not used to\u2026 teamwork. Let us try again. Slower this time. I will tell you when to stop.\" They did, and this time, guided by his calm, precise instructions, they achieved a thick, workable, lumpy grey sludge. It was, Ellie thought, the single greatest accomplishment of her recent life.\n\nAs they began to work, a strange rhythm developed. They were no longer a cop and a watchmaker. They were two hands of the same unseen body, forced to communicate every twitch and intention. \"I am applying the adhesive to the back of the first tile,\" Alistair would murmur, his voice a low constant. Ellie, kneeling opposite him in the 'red zone', would prepare the next tile, cleaning its edges. \"The next tile is ready, to your left, long side facing you.\" They moved with a slow, deliberate grace, their earlier clumsiness replaced by a hard-won synergy. The scrape of the trowel, the soft tap of the rubber mallet, the rasp of the slate tiles against each other, became the vocabulary of their shared purpose. They spoke less, their verbal cues becoming shorter, more intuitive. They were beginning to anticipate each other's needs, feeling the subtle shift in the air as the other moved, a new sense born of their shared affliction.\n\nIt was as she was carefully cleaning excess adhesive from between the first two laid tiles, her focus absolute on the feel of the damp rag against the stone, that Ellie noticed it. The cold spot. The familiar, low-grade pressure behind her forehead, the psychic hum of the parasite, was\u2026 quieter. It wasn\u2019t gone, but its insistent, draining presence had receded, pushed to the periphery of her consciousness by the overwhelming demands of the present moment. Her mind was not on her past, her losses, or her fear. It was entirely consumed by the exact angle of a slate tile, the consistency of grout, the precise location of Alistair's invisible hand. She paused, the rag still. \"Alistair,\" she whispered, her voice full of a new, tentative awe. \"The cold\u2026 can you feel it?\"\n\nFrom the other side of the hearth came a soft, sharp intake of breath. \"Yes,\" he breathed, his voice filled with wonder. \"It's\u2026 distant. Like a radio station that has gone out of tune. The pulling\u2026 it has stopped.\" The parasite was being starved. Their insane theory was working. The simple, focused, creative act of mending a broken thing was a weapon. It was a shield. The joy of the revelation was a shot of pure, undiluted energy. A genuine, unrestrained laugh bubbled up out of Ellie, a sound so unfamiliar in the grim silence of the last few weeks that it startled them both. A moment later, a dry, rusty chuckle answered her from Alistair\u2019s side of the hearth. For a brief, shining moment, they were not two invisible phantoms fighting a soul-eating monster. They were just two people, laughing in a dusty room, covered in cement, having the time of their lives."

                                        "text": "## Chapter 9\n\nThe shared laughter, a rare and precious sound in the derelict house, faded into a new kind of silence. It was not the oppressive, fearful quiet of before, but a space filled with a vibrant, shared energy. They returned to the hearth not as desperate survivors, but as joyful saboteurs, their purpose now infused with a thrilling sense of efficacy. Their verbal ballet became smoother, more intuitive. The stilted commands of \"hand in the zone\" softened into a fluid dialogue of partnership. \"Slightly more adhesive on that one, I think, Eleanor.\" \"Hold that steady for me, Alistair, just for a moment.\" They were no longer two separate entities fumbling in the dark, but a single, four-handed creature, working with a grace and synergy that belied their invisibility. The scrape of the trowel was the rhythm of their rebellion, each perfectly placed tile a victory against the void.\n\nThey laid the final piece of slate just as the afternoon sun cast long, dusty rays through the living room window. There was no grand ceremony, just a shared, satisfied sigh. They tidied their tools with the care of master craftspeople, wiping down the trowel, sealing the leftover adhesive, and stacking the remaining tiles neatly against the wall. Then they stood, two invisible figures side-by-side, and regarded their work. They couldn\u2019t see it, not in the way the new owners of the house would. But they could feel it. Ellie knelt and ran her unseen hand over the surface. It was cool, smooth, and perfectly level. The sharp, broken edges were gone, replaced by a seamless plane of dark, solid stone. A broken thing, made whole. It was more than a hearth. It was a monument to their impossible alliance, a declaration in slate and cement that they were still here, and they could still create.\n\nThe true test, however, came after the work was done. As the adrenaline of their task subsided, a familiar apprehension settled over Ellie. She sank onto her dusty chair, bracing herself for the inevitable return of the cold, psychic hum, the draining pull of the parasite reasserting its dominion in the idle quiet. She closed her non-existent eyes, focusing inward, searching for the familiar pressure behind her forehead. She waited. And she felt\u2026 quiet. The oppressive static was gone. The cold spot was still there, she knew, a latent fact like a dormant volcano, but its active, hungry presence was gone. The silence in her mind was clean, clear, and entirely her own. It was a peace she hadn't realised she had lost until this very moment of its return.\n\n\"It's quiet,\" Alistair whispered from the other chair, his voice filled with a disbelieving reverence that mirrored her own feelings perfectly. \"For the first time in so long, my head is quiet. I can think without\u2026 fighting.\" He paused, and Ellie felt the direction of his presence shift as he turned towards her. \"The watches\u2026 when I work on them, the feeling lessens, but it always comes back the moment I put my tools down. This\u2026 this is different. The quiet is deeper. It feels\u2026 earned.\" He was right. This wasn't the temporary reprieve of solitary focus. This was the resilient peace of shared accomplishment. It was a new kind of memory, one not of loss or grief, but of creation and partnership, and it seemed to be anathema to the parasite. \"We built a wall,\" she said softly, the words filled with awe. \"And it's holding.\"\n\nTheir conversation, for the first time, drifted away from the immediate, terrifying present. They spoke of the things that brought them focus, the \"safe\" memories that were about process, not people. Alistair described, with a passion that warmed his reedy voice, the beautiful, intricate logic of a grasshopper escapement, the delicate balance of a hairspring. Ellie, in turn, found herself talking about the singular, clean joy of reading a green on a golf course, the complex calculation of wind and slope that dissolved the rest of the world into irrelevant noise. They were exchanging notes from their respective fortresses of solitude, discovering they had been fighting the same war on different fronts, with different weapons.\n\nIt was Ellie who brought them back to the necessary, tactical reality. \"This is a proof of concept, Alistair. A brilliant one. But this house\u2026 our sanctuary\u2026 it's temporary. We can't stay here forever. We need a permanent base of operations. A workshop. A place where we can continue this\u2026 therapy. A place we can secure.\" The logical answer was obvious, hanging in the air between them. Alistair\u2019s house. His workshop. His last, most personal fortress. It was a huge ask, an invitation to invade the only private space he had left. She watched the empty space where he sat, waiting for his reply, expecting hesitation. Instead, his response was immediate and sure. \"My workshop,\" he said. \"It is secure. It has everything we might need. You would be\u2026 welcome, Eleanor. It would be good to have the company.\"\n\nThe offer was a profound gesture of trust, a cementing of their alliance that felt more solid than the hearth they had just built. A wave of gratitude and relief washed over Ellie. For the first time, a long-term plan felt possible. They had a strategy, and now they had a base. A flicker of hope, bright and fierce, ignited in the darkness of her world. Full of this newfound optimism, she stood and walked to the grimy window, a habitual check of her surroundings. The street was quiet, bathed in the golden light of the late afternoon. She was about to turn away when a smart-looking estate car pulled up directly outside. A man in a sharp suit got out, walked to the leaning 'For Sale' sign in the overgrown lawn, and with a grunt of effort, pulled it from the ground. He opened the boot of his car and replaced it with another sign. It was smaller, starker, and its single, brutal word seemed to scream at her across the quiet street. A bright red banner emblazoned with the word: SOLD."

                                        "text": "The word was a brutalist monument of red and white, a definitive, final statement. SOLD. It was not a possibility, not a negotiation; it was a conclusion. The fragile peace they had built, the quiet joy of their shared accomplishment, evaporated in an instant, replaced by the cold, familiar grip of exposure. Their sanctuary was no longer theirs. The fortress had fallen before the first defensive brick was even truly dry. Ellie felt the blood drain from her invisible face, the warmth of their recent victory leeched away by a simple word on a plastic sign. The estate agent, a man in a world of solid, visible transactions, tossed the old sign into his boot, slammed it shut, and drove away, utterly oblivious to the two ghosts he had just evicted.\n\nShe turned from the window, her movement sharp and sudden. The elation was gone from her, replaced by the clipped, urgent efficiency of a DCI facing a sudden tactical collapse. \"We have a problem,\" she announced, her voice a low, hard command. \"The house is sold. We have to leave. Now.\" The chair opposite her gave a sharp, protesting creak, a sound of sudden, crushing weight. She didn't need to see Alistair to know that the fragile, hopeful light she had seen kindle within him had just been extinguished. The silence from his side of the room was a void of profound disappointment, the sound of a man who had just taken his first step out of a lifelong prison only to find the gates slamming shut in his face.\n\nAnd then, she felt it. A cold, familiar throb behind her forehead, like the phantom limb of an amputated fear. The parasite, which had been blissfully, wonderfully quiet, was awake. It had sensed the spike of anxiety, the sudden fear of displacement, and it was stirring, hungry. A faint, draining pull began, a psychic leech fastening onto the fresh wound of their defeat. \"Alistair,\" she said, her voice tight, \"Can you feel it? It's back.\" From the darkness opposite came a low, despairing groan. \"Yes. The cold. It is\u2026 stronger than before.\" Their victory had been temporary. Their therapy worked, but the moment their focus was broken, the moment fear returned, the enemy was at their door, not just outside, but inside their own heads.\n\nTheir new reality galvanised them into frantic, whispered action. The hearth, their beautiful, solid monument, could not be hidden, but every other trace of their presence had to be erased. The leftover tiles, the tools, the precious bag of cement\u2014they had to go. \"The car is too risky in daylight,\" Ellie hissed, her mind a flurry of risk assessments. \"We take what we can carry. The rest, we have to leave. The tools are most important.\" They worked in a feverish, desperate silence, a stark contrast to their earlier, joyful rhythm. The tools were wrapped in old rags to prevent them from clinking. Alistair found a sturdy canvas bag in one of the kitchen cupboards, into which they packed the essentials. The cement, their twenty-kilo trophy, had to be abandoned, a casualty of their hasty retreat. Leaving it felt like admitting defeat.\n\nThey slipped out of the back door like the ghosts they were, their last act in the house to wipe the doorknobs clean of fingerprints they hadn't left. The journey back to Alistair's house was a gauntlet of suburban normality. Every dog walker, every passing mother with a pram, every curtain that twitched in a window was a potential witness to the sight of a floating canvas bag of tools moving purposefully down the pavement. They hugged the shadows of garden walls and hedges, moving in short, synchronised bursts, two invisible soldiers retreating through enemy territory. A postman on his rounds whistled cheerfully as he walked right past the hedge they were hiding behind, so close Ellie could have reached out and touched his mail sack. The sheer, unbridgeable gulf between his carefree, visible world and their tense, hidden one was a chasm that seemed to grow wider with every step.\n\nFinally, they reached the sanctuary of Alistair's cul-de-sac. The relief upon slipping through his back gate and hearing the click of his kitchen door locking behind them was so profound that Ellie had to lean against a wall for support, her invisible knees weak. They were safe. For now. Alistair, without a word, led the way, his soft, shuffling footsteps guiding her through his neat, quiet house and down a short corridor to a door at the very back. He unlocked it, and pushed it open. \"My workshop,\" he announced, his voice regaining a sliver of its former pride.\n\nEllie stepped inside, and felt the world shift. This was not the cold, derelict emptiness of the abandoned house. This was a world in miniature, a temple of order and purpose. The room smelled of clean machine oil, old wood, and the faint, metallic tang of brass. Workbenches lined the walls, each one a masterpiece of organisation. Tiny drawers, meticulously labelled, held gears and springs and hands. Delicate tools hung in precise rows, their polished steel glinting in the light from the large, clean window that looked out onto his rose garden. In the centre of the room, on a velvet mat under a large magnifying lamp, lay the disassembled guts of an ancient pocket watch, its components laid out like the organs of a fallen brass bird. This was not just a workshop. It was Alistair\u2019s fortress, the physical manifestation of his focused mind. This was their new headquarters.\n\nAlistair placed the bag of tools on a clear section of workbench, the canvas seeming to settle itself. The immediate crisis was over, the retreat successful. But the parasite was still there, a low, hungry hum in their minds, a reminder that defence was not enough. They had been reactive for too long. It was time to go on the offensive. \"Alistair,\" Ellie said, turning from her inspection of a rack of tiny, gleaming screwdrivers. Her voice was quiet, but it held the hard, unmistakable edge of a DCI giving a briefing. \"The hearth was our training exercise. Now the real work begins. We can't just keep building things. We need more data. We need to understand the enemy. Your case file, the Coventry traffic cop\u2026 there are others out there like us. We need to find another one. Not just to build a bigger wall. We need to find them so we can learn how this thing works, and how to kill it.\""

                                        "text": "## Chapter 10\n\nAlistair looked at the empty space where Ellie stood, his head tilted as if trying to bring an invisible object into focus. Her declaration to \"kill it\" was the most terrifying and exhilarating thing he had heard in his eighteen months of solitude. His entire existence had been a quiet, managed retreat, a rear-guard action against the encroaching fog. The idea of turning around and charging headlong into that fog, seeking out its very source, was anathema to his cautious, ordered nature. And yet, the logic was as clean and inescapable as the mechanism of a fine chronometer. Defence was a losing game. An army of two had a better chance than an army of one. The watchmaker, who had spent a lifetime making things run, finally saw the sense in not just winding his own clock, but in seeking out others that had stopped.\n\n\"Then this is no longer a workshop,\" he said, his voice quiet but resolute. He gestured with an unseen hand to the pristine benches and gleaming tools. \"It is an incident room.\" The words felt strange and momentous in the small, quiet space. His sanctuary, the last bastion of his private, ordered world, had been requisitioned for a war he had only just realised he was fighting. It felt like a violation, but also, strangely, like a promotion. He was no longer a hermit, hiding from the world. He was now quartermaster and chief analyst for a special investigations unit of two.\n\nThe transformation of the space began immediately. They brought in a small table and a chair from his kitchen, setting up a dedicated workstation for Ellie's laptop opposite his own workbench. The juxtaposition was striking: on one side, the intricate, analogue world of brass gears and polished steel; on the other, the glowing, digital portal into the vast, interconnected data-sphere of the modern world. An invisible woman sat at the table, her fingers a blur over the keyboard, the screen's light illuminating a patch of empty air. An invisible man sat at the workbench, a tiny jeweler's loupe floating near his eye as he methodically disassembled the pocket watch, the tiny, repetitive actions a form of meditation, a way to keep his own focus sharp while Ellie hunted in the electronic wilderness. They worked in a shared, purposeful silence, the soft click of Ellie\u2019s keyboard a counterpoint to the delicate tick and scrape of Alistair\u2019s tools.\n\nEllie\u2019s approach was different this time, honed by the new, terrifying clarity of their situation. She was no longer looking for anomalies. She was profiling for a specific vulnerability. She built a complex search algorithm in her head, a DCI's intuitive leap translated into database queries. She cross-referenced unresolved, low-level incident reports\u2014reports marked 'NFAR' that had a hint of the inexplicable\u2014with a new set of data: public records of profound personal and professional loss. She trawled digital archives of bankruptcy filings, linking them to sudden spikes in erratic driving reports. She scanned obituaries and divorce records from the preceding months of 'phantom burglaries' where nothing of value was taken. It was a grim, voyeuristic trawl through the wreckage of other people's lives, but she did it with the detached focus of a surgeon. She was not looking for criminals. She was looking for casualties.\n\nAfter hours of methodical searching, she returned to their strongest lead: the Coventry traffic cop's report. The driver of the swerving car. Marcus Thorne. Forty-eight years old. A HGV driver with a twenty-five-year clean record. The original incident report dismissed him as a probable drunk driver who had simply gotten lucky with the breathalyzer. But Ellie bypassed the summary and went straight for the source data, pulling up the digital file on Thorne himself. And there it was. Three months before the swerving incident, 'Thorne Haulage Ltd,' a family business started by his grandfather, had gone into liquidation. Thorne had lost everything: his company, his fleet of trucks, his professional identity. He had gone from being the boss to just another unemployed driver looking for agency work. The hollowing out had been swift and brutal.\n\n\"I have him, Alistair,\" Ellie said, her voice cutting through the quiet of the workshop. Alistair carefully placed a microscopic gear onto his velvet mat and turned his unseen face towards her. \"The driver. Marcus Thorne. His company went under. He lost a lifetime's work, his family's legacy. The traffic cop said Thorne was disoriented, argumentative. He claimed the steering had 'gone funny,' that the lorry had 'jumped.' The cop thought he was making excuses. But what if he wasn't? What if he was fading, right there in the cab, doing sixty miles an hour on the M6? What if the lorry 'jumped' because for a split second, its driver ceased to fully exist?\"\n\nThe theory was horrifying, but it slotted into their understanding of the phenomenon with a sickening click. Thorne wasn't swerving to avoid something unseen. He *was* the unseen thing. His intermittent physical state was causing the vehicle to behave erratically. He was a danger not just to himself, but to everyone around him. The cold spot inside Ellie\u2019s head seemed to pulse in grim recognition. This was not a passive, gentle fading. It could be violent. It could be catastrophic.\n\nShe drilled deeper, her fingers flying across the keys. A current address for Thorne in a tired suburb of Rugby. A flag on his file for two subsequent 'public order' disturbances, both minor, both involving arguments in public where witnesses claimed he seemed to be \"shouting at no one.\" He was deteriorating. He was losing control. He was shedding the routines that kept him anchored faster than either she or Alistair had. They had their next target. \"Rugby,\" she announced, the single word a new destination, a new mission objective. \"He's in Rugby. And from the look of these reports, he's coming apart at the seams. We need to get to him. Not just to find answers. We need to get to him before he hurts someone. Or before he disappears for good.\""

Alistair, a man who had not moved a single tool from its designated hook in twenty years, now surveyed a large-scale Ordnance Survey map of the Midlands spread across his main workbench, held down at the corners by heavy brass paperweights. His collection of priceless, half-repaired timepieces had been carefully moved to a side bench, their intricate mechanisms now secondary to the more urgent mechanics of their mission. His sanctuary had become an incident room, and he had, with a quiet and surprising alacrity, become its chief intelligence analyst, his meticulous mind perfectly suited to the new task of route-planning and logistical support. Ellie, for her part, had established her digital command post, the laptop a humming portal from which she launched sorties into the data trails of their new target, her focus as intense and all-consuming as any major investigation she had ever run.\n\nTheir new partnership was a study in contrasts. Alistair, grounded in the analogue world of maps and mechanics, planned their physical journey. He traced the route from Solihull to Rugby on the paper map with an unseen finger, his voice a low murmur as he calculated fuel consumption for the Morris Minor and identified potential blackspots for surveillance. He was methodical, cautious, pointing out the vulnerabilities of taking such a conspicuous, vintage car on a long journey. Ellie, operating in the abstract realm of data, was more aggressive. She saw the risks, but her focus was on the target, the urgent need to intercept Thorne before his deteriorating state caused a catastrophe.\n\n\"The car is a risk, Eleanor,\" Alistair stated, his disembodied voice emanating from beside the map. \"On the motorway, it is an anomaly. It draws the eye. If we were to be stopped for any reason, a routine check\u2026 the consequences are unthinkable. And I must confess, I have not taken her on a journey of more than twenty miles in over a decade. Her reliability is, at this point, a theoretical concept.\"\n\n\"It\u2019s the only asset we have,\" Ellie countered, her eyes not leaving the screen where Marcus Thorne\u2019s digital ghost was taking shape. \"We move at night. We stick to the back roads where we can. The risk of the journey is high, but the risk of leaving a volatile, intermittently invisible HGV driver to his own devices is higher. He's a ticking bomb, Alistair. We have to get there.\" Her logic was brutal and unassailable, the cold calculus of command. Alistair fell silent, conceding the point. The mission parameters were set by the threat, not by their comfort. They would take the Morris Minor.\n\nThey left under the cloak of a moonless night, the little green car a whisper of motion through the sleeping towns of the Midlands. The journey was a long, ninety-minute ordeal of sustained, silent tension. Every pair of headlights in the rear-view mirror was a potential threat, every distant siren a possible end to their impossible enterprise. Ellie navigated, her voice a low, steady presence in the dark, while Alistair drove with a focus so absolute it was a physical force in the small cabin. They were a ghost crew sailing a ghost ship through a world that could not be allowed to see them. As they drove, Alistair, perhaps needing to fill the tense silence, began to talk about the car, about his father teaching him to drive in it, about the faded scent of his mother\u2019s perfume that he could still sometimes smell in the woollen seat covers. It was not a lament for the past, Ellie realised, but a quiet statement of what he was fighting to protect. He was not just saving himself; he was saving the library of memories that made him who he was.\n\nThey arrived in Rugby in the dead hour before dawn, the town\u2019s industrial estates and tired-looking housing developments a world away from the manicured lawns of Solihull. The address they had for Thorne was a flat in a grim, four-storey block, its concrete facade stained with damp, its balconies cluttered with rusting satellite dishes and broken furniture. The place radiated a palpable air of neglect and quiet desperation. There was no empty house opposite, no convenient observation post. Their operational theatre had become infinitely more complex and exposed. They parked the Morris at the end of the road, half-hidden in the shadow of a large, graffiti-covered telecoms cabinet, and began their wait.\n\nFor hours, nothing. The block of flats remained dormant. But as the sun rose, bringing with it the daily churn of people leaving for work and school, they got their first sign. A window on the third floor, which Ellie had identified as Thorne\u2019s, slid open with a screech. A moment later, a half-eaten pork pie, trailing a greasy slick of jelly, arced through the air and splattered on the pavement below. It was followed by a torrent of furious, disembodied swearing that echoed across the car park, a litany of curses aimed at the world in general. A woman walking her dog hurried past, pulling her pet away from the mess on the ground and casting a nervous glance up at the open window from which the abuse seemed to be emanating. Alistair let out a soft, appalled gasp. His own invisibility had been a quiet, sad affair of floating teacups and self-dusting furniture. This was different. This was aggressive, chaotic, and public. This was a man not just fading, but actively lashing out at the world as he went. Their ticking bomb was live."

It was a declaration of chaos, a public tantrum thrown by a man whose internal world was collapsing so violently it was spilling out into the open. Beside her, she felt Alistair recoil, a subtle shift in the air that spoke of profound dismay. His own affliction was a quiet, mannered affair, a secret kept with the same neat precision as his workshop. This raw, aggressive display of psychic collapse was a brutal confirmation that their condition was not uniform; it was a bespoke malady that preyed on the unique weaknesses of its host. For Alistair, the parasite fed on quiet grief. For Ellie, it had fed on hollowed-out duty. For Marcus Thorne, it was clearly feasting on pure, undirected rage.\n\n\"We cannot approach him like we approached each other,\" Ellie said, her voice a low, hard whisper that cut through the vintage car\u2019s quiet interior. The DCI had taken full command, the shock giving way to a cold, tactical assessment. \"A note will be a provocation. A direct approach, even an invisible one, could be met with violence. His anchor isn't a quiet memory of a loved one; it's a burning grievance against the world. He's not hiding from his condition; he's weaponising it.\" She looked at the grimy facade of the block of flats, a vertical slum radiating misery. \"I need to get inside. I need to get a baseline reading on his environment and his routine. You stay with the car, Alistair. You are our transport and our only way out. Keep the engine warm. If you see police, you leave. Do you understand? You do not wait for me. You leave.\" The order was brutal, the protocol of a deep-cover operation where one partner might have to be sacrificed for the mission to survive. Alistair did not reply, but the slight dip of the driver's seat was his silent, grim assent.\n\nHer opportunity came twenty minutes later. A harried-looking young woman, wrestling with a buggy and two shopping bags, struggled to open the main entrance door to the block. Ellie slipped through the gap behind her, a ghost riding in the wake of another person\u2019s daily struggle. The inside of the building was even more depressing than the outside. The air was thick with the smell of stale cooking, damp, and cheap air freshener failing to mask something vaguely unpleasant. Muffled sounds bled through the thin walls: the tinny beat of daytime television, the sharp, angry words of an argument, the desolate sound of a baby crying without hope of being comforted. This was a place where lives were lived on top of one another, a petri dish of quiet desperation. Ellie took the stairs, her trainers silent on the worn, stained carpet, her invisible hand gliding along a sticky banister. She was an unseen trespasser in a building full of people who already felt invisible in their own ways.\n\nShe found Thorne\u2019s flat, 3C, at the end of a dimly lit corridor. She pressed her unseen ear to the cheap wood of the door. From inside, she could hear a television blaring a mind-numbing quiz show, the questions and meaningless applause a stark contrast to the aggressive silence behind it. And then she heard another sound, a rhythmic, violent thud. Thud. Thud. Thud. It was the sound of a man repeatedly, methodically, punching a wall. Each impact was followed by a low, guttural grunt of effort and pain. He wasn't just angry. He was trying to feel something, anything, through the fog of his own dissolution, battling his invisibility with the brute, physical reality of pain. Ellie stepped back from the door, her own invisible skin crawling. This was worse than she had imagined. Alistair was trying to remember. She was trying to build. Marcus Thorne was just trying to break things, starting with himself.\n\nShe had been waiting for almost an hour, concealed in the dark recess at the end of the corridor, when the door to 3C was wrenched open. Marcus Thorne stood silhouetted in the doorway for a moment, and Ellie finally saw her target in the flesh. He was a big man, running to seed, his large frame stooped inside a stained tracksuit. His face was blotchy and pale, his eyes sunk deep in bruised-looking sockets, burning with a restless, frantic anger. His knuckles were raw and bleeding. He looked like a bear with a thorn in its paw, enraged by a pain it could neither see nor understand. He slammed the door behind him, the flimsy frame shuddering in protest, and stomped off down the corridor towards the stairs, his heavy footsteps echoing his fury. This was Ellie's chance. It was a huge risk, but the intelligence to be gained from inside his flat was too valuable to pass up. As Thorne\u2019s footsteps receded, she slipped forward. She had no tools, but she didn\u2019t need them. He hadn\u2019t even bothered to lock the door. With a soft click, she pushed it open and slipped into the lion's den.\n\nThe flat was a disaster zone, a perfect reflection of the chaos in its owner\u2019s mind. The air was thick with the smell of stale beer, unwashed clothes, and greasy takeaways. Empty pizza boxes and beer cans littered every surface. An overflowing ashtray sat perilously on the arm of a sofa that had seen better decades. In the centre of the living room wall was a ragged area of exposed plasterboard, the target of Thorne\u2019s desperate, self-harming assault. It was a scene of total collapse, the habitat of a man who had given up on every facet of a normal life. But amidst the squalor, on a small, dust-free shelf high on the wall, sat a single, pristine object. It was a beautiful, exquisitely detailed scale model of a Scania R-series truck, painted in the smart green and gold livery of 'Thorne Haulage Ltd'. It was his anchor. His last, treasured memory of a life of purpose, a life where his name meant something, a life he could see and touch.\n\nDrawn by an investigator's instinct, Ellie moved towards the model truck. It was his version of Alistair's clocks, her golf clubs. This was the nexus of his loss. As she got closer, she saw that propped against the front wheel of the model was a small, framed photograph. It wasn't of a wife or a child. It was a picture of a younger, prouder Marcus Thorne, his arm slung around an older man who shared his broad features, both of them grinning in front of a real, full-sized Thorne Haulage truck. His father. This was the legacy he had lost. She reached out an invisible hand, her fingers hovering just millimetres from the photograph, a profound, aching pity for this angry, broken man welling up inside her. He wasn't a monster. He was just another casualty, his grief curdled into a rage that was consuming him from the inside out.\n\nIt was then that she heard it. The unmistakable, terrifying sound of a key scraping against the outside of the lock. Her blood turned to ice. He was back. He must have forgotten something. Her mind raced, a frantic search for an exit, an escape route. But there was none. The flat was a small, one-bedroom box. There was no back door, no place to hide. The lock turned with a loud, final click. The door began to swing inwards. Ellie was trapped. Trapped in the chaotic, rage-filled epicentre of a volatile, unstable, and intermittently invisible man, with nowhere to run and no way of knowing if he could see her or not."
