     "novel_text": "The serviette, folded into the shape of a bishop\u2019s mitre, was the first casualty. Arthur Penhaligon watched it surrender, its crisp, starched confidence wilting in the condensation of a G&T glass. It slumped, a soft white flag on the dark wood of Table 7. He should have used a coaster. Mr Henderson would have his hide for that. But his mind wasn\u2019t on coasters. It wasn\u2019t on the smear of b\u00e9arnaise sauce on Mrs Albright\u2019s side plate or the fact that the lads on Table 12 were about to get rowdy. His mind was a hundred and eighty miles south, under a blizzard of confetti and the heat of a thousand stage lights.\n\nArthur was a constellation of tiny, rehearsed movements. A dip of the head, a flick of the wrist to present the wine list, the silent, gliding walk that was the hallmark of a man who had spent a decade trying to be invisible. He worked at \u2018The Gilded Fork\u2019, a name far grander than the establishment itself, a place in Lancaster that aspired to fine dining but mostly settled for being the default option for anniversaries and awkward corporate dinners. He was, by all accounts, a good waiter. Attentive. Discreet. But lately, his discretion was cracking. He\u2019d find himself humming. Not just a mindless tune, but the soaring bridge of \u2018Nessun Dorma\u2019, his voice a low, resonant thrum in the back of his throat as he cleared away half-eaten steaks. He\u2019d tap out the rhythm of a powerful crescendo on the edge of his serving tray, a frantic, silent drumming that only he could hear.\n\nThe phone call had come three days ago. He\u2019d been in the stockroom, the air thick with the smell of cardboard and cheap cleaning fluid, counting napkins. His mobile, an old thing with a spiderweb crack across the screen, had vibrated against a box of communion-wafer-thin mints. A London number. A slick, impossibly cheerful voice belonging to a woman named Chloe.\n\u201cArthur? Chloe from Syco. We\u2019ve got the numbers. The public vote\u2026 Arthur, you\u2019re in. You\u2019re in the final.\u201d\n\nThe world had tilted. The dusty shelves of a Lancaster stockroom became the epicentre of the universe. He had leaned against a crate of Chilean Merlot, the cheap wine suddenly priceless, his breath catching in his throat. The final. Not a dream. Not a fantasy he played out in his head while polishing cutlery until his own reflection stared back, tired and vague. It was real. The golden buzzer from the auditions, a moment of pure, blinding shock that felt like a lightning strike, had been one thing. The semi-final, a terrifying blur of adrenaline and dry-ice smoke, had been another. But this? This was the summit. The air was thin up here.\n\n\u201cYou there, love?\u201d a voice crackled, pulling him from his memory. Mrs Gable from Table 4, a woman whose face was a delicate roadmap of her ninety-two years. She was a regular, a Tuesday-and-Thursday fixture.\n\u201cSorry, Mrs Gable. Miles away.\u201d He offered a smile that he hoped reached his eyes.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got that look again,\u201d she said, her own eyes, pale blue and watery, twinkling. \u201cLike you\u2019ve swallowed a canary. A whole choir of them.\u201d\nArthur\u2019s smile became genuine. \u201cJust thinking.\u201d\n\u201cAbout London, I\u2019ll be bound. Our lad. On the telly.\u201d She patted his hand, her skin as fine and dry as parchment. \u201cYou\u2019ll do us proud, Arthur. Just remember to stand up straight. And don\u2019t you dare sing any of that racket the youngsters like.\u201d\n\u201cVera Lynn. Just for you, Mrs Gable,\u201d he promised, and her face lit up.\n\nThe promise was easy to make. He carried a hundred such promises in his pockets, little pebbles of expectation from the people of this city. Since the semi-final aired, he couldn\u2019t walk to the corner shop without being stopped. \u201cIt\u2019s him, our Arthur!\u201d people would whisper. The butcher gave him his best cuts of bacon for free. The woman in the bakery insisted he take a 'good luck' Eccles cake. He was no longer just Arthur Penhaligon, the quiet man from the terraced house on the canal. He was \u2018Lancaster\u2019s Lark\u2019, a headline from the local paper that made his cheeks burn every time he thought of it. He felt the weight of it, a heavy, warm cloak he wasn\u2019t sure he knew how to wear.\n\nHe moved through the evening service on autopilot. The clatter of the kitchen, the drone of conversations, the endless, looping pop music piped through the ceiling speakers \u2013 it all faded into a gentle, ignorable hum. The only sound with any clarity was the song in his own head. He was still deciding. The producers wanted something big, something anthemic. Another Puccini, maybe. But Arthur was leaning towards something simpler. Something from the heart. A Welsh hymn his mother used to sing. It felt right. It felt like him.\n\nHis mother. Elsie. He\u2019d called her straight after the producer, his hand shaking so much he could barely hold the phone. He\u2019d pictured her in her small, neat-as-a-pin bungalow, the scent of lavender polish and Earl Grey tea in the air.\n\u201cMam? It\u2019s me.\u201d\n\u201cArthur! I was just watching the kettle. Thinking it\u2019s nearly time for your break.\u201d She always knew his schedule, a timetable of his life etched into her own.\n\u201cI\u2019m in, Mam. The final.\u201d\nSilence. For a second, a cold spike of fear lanced through him. Had the line gone dead? \u201cMam?\u201d\nThen, a sound like a gasp, a sob, a laugh, all tangled into one. \u201cOh, my boy. My beautiful, beautiful boy. I knew it. I always knew it.\u201d\nHe could hear the tears in her voice, and it made his own eyes sting. He\u2019d spent his whole life trying to make her proud, a quiet, desperate effort since his dad had left, leaving a void that Arthur had tried to fill with good grades, steady employment, and a conspicuous lack of trouble. But none of it, not the school prizes or the promotion to head waiter, had ever earned a reaction like this. This was a pride that felt elemental, a force of nature.\n\u201cDon\u2019t you get overwhelmed now,\u201d she\u2019d said, her voice shifting into its familiar, fussing cadence. \u201cYou make sure you eat properly. And get your sleep. You look peaky on the telly, love. It\u2019s the lighting, I\u2019m sure, but a mother worries.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m fine, Mam. Honestly.\u201d\n\u201cOf course you are. You\u2019re my Arthur. Strong as an ox, you are.\u201d\nHe wasn't. Not really. He was a man who polished glasses for a living. But when she said it, for a moment, he believed her. A strange, unseasonable shiver traced its way down his spine then, right there in the warm stockroom. A sudden, deep cold that had nothing to do with the temperature. He\u2019d shaken it off. Nerves, that's all.\n\nThe last diners finally drifted out just after eleven, trailing scarves and the scent of expensive perfume. The Gilded Fork exhaled, its shoulders slumping in relief. Arthur and the other junior waiter, a university student named Ben who mostly communicated in grunts, began the long, slow process of resetting the room for the next day. Stripping tables, crumbing down, polishing cutlery. It was a ritual he usually found soothing, the methodical restoration of order from chaos. But tonight, every polished fork was a second ticking away, another moment gone from the precious few days he had left. The final was on Saturday. It was already Tuesday night.\n\n\u201cBig weekend for you, then,\u201d Ben grunted, upending a salt shaker into a steel container.\n\u201cYeah. A bit,\u201d Arthur said, his voice quiet in the cavernous, empty room.\n\u201cGonna be weird, innit? Seeing you on a massive screen instead of just\u2026 here.\u201d Ben gestured vaguely at the restaurant, at the life Arthur was about to leave behind, if only for a night.\n\u201cIt\u2019s weird for me, too.\u201d\nMr Henderson emerged from his office, keys jangling. He was a man built of sharp angles and disapproval, but tonight his face was softer. \u201cPenhaligon. My office. A moment.\u201d\nArthur\u2019s stomach tightened. He followed the manager into the tiny, cluttered room, expecting a lecture about the water-damaged serviette.\nMr Henderson sat down heavily behind his desk. He cleared his throat. \u201cI\u2019ve rearranged the rota. Given you the rest of the week off. Paid.\u201d\nArthur blinked. \u201cSir? You don\u2019t have to do that. I can work until Thursday.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t be a fool, man. You\u2019re representing this city, for heaven\u2019s sake. In a small, tangential way, you\u2019re representing this restaurant.\u201d He looked almost pained to admit it. \u201cGo. Practice. Don\u2019t make us look like idiots.\u201d He opened a drawer and pulled out a card. It was a cheap, garish thing with a glittery horseshoe on the front. Inside, in the scrawled handwriting of every member of staff, were messages of good luck. Even a grunt from Ben that just said \u2018Smash it\u2019.\nTucked inside was a bundle of notes. Fifties. At least three hundred pounds.\n\u201cA collection,\u201d Mr Henderson said gruffly, refusing to meet Arthur\u2019s eye. \u201cFor your expenses. Hotels in London aren\u2019t cheap.\u201d\nArthur stared at the money, a lump forming in his throat. \u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t know what to say.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t say anything. Just win.\u201d\n\nHe walked home under a sky the colour of bruised plums. The air was cold, carrying the damp, earthy smell of the canal. Lancaster was asleep, its stone buildings hunched and silent. His own footsteps echoed, a lonely rhythm on the pavement. He felt a profound sense of dislocation, as if he were watching himself from a great height. There was Arthur, the waiter, walking his usual route home. But inside, a different Arthur was vibrating, a tuning fork struck against a star. The money in his pocket felt heavy, a tangible symbol of the faith this town was placing in him. It wasn't just his dream anymore.\n\nHis house was the middle of a row of three, identical but for the colour of their front doors. His was a peeling, forgettable brown. He let himself in, the familiar click of the lock a small comfort. The house was cold. Colder than it should be. He ran a hand along the radiator in the hall. Tepid. He\u2019d have to bleed them again. He stood for a moment in the darkness, listening to the house settle around him. There was a faint, persistent drip from the kitchen tap and the low hum of the refrigerator. It was the soundtrack of his life, a quiet, unassuming melody. But now, all he could hear were the crashing chords of a future he hadn\u2019t dared to imagine.\n\nHe didn\u2019t turn on the lights. He walked through to the small living room, the moonlight painting a silver rectangle on the worn carpet. On the mantelpiece, amongst a collection of ceramic birds, was a framed photograph. Him and his mother, taken ten years ago in Morecambe. They were squinting into the sun, a half-melted ice cream cone in his hand. Her arm was around his shoulder, her smile wide and unreserved. He picked it up, the cold glass chilling his fingertips. He saw the boy in the picture, the one who sang in the school choir and dreamed of the stage, a boy who had slowly been buried under the weight of bills and responsibilities and the quiet, creeping fear of disappointment. He was still in there, that boy. And in four days, he was going to walk onto a stage in front of fifteen million people and sing his heart out. For his mother. For Mrs Gable. For Lancaster. For himself.\n\nHe sank into his worn armchair, the springs groaning in protest. The chill was back, deep in his bones this time, a cold that had nothing to do with the faulty radiators. It felt ancient. He pulled his jacket tighter around himself, his gaze drifting to the window. Across the street, parked under a flickering streetlamp, was his car. A fifteen-year-old Ford Fiesta, the colour of a faded poppy. The driver\u2019s side wing was a slightly different shade of red, the result of a misjudged encounter with a bollard. It was a tired, cantankerous machine. But it was his. His chariot. On Friday morning, he would load it up, turn the key, and point it south. The thought filled him with a dizzying mix of terror and glee. Everything, absolutely everything, was riding on that journey. He closed his eyes, and for a moment, just a fleeting, sickening moment, he heard not the roar of a crowd, but the high-pitched squeal of tortured rubber on wet tarmac. He snapped his eyes open, his heart hammering against his ribs. The room was silent. Just the drip, drip, drip from the kitchen tap. Just the hum of the fridge. He was just tired. Overwrought. That\u2019s all it was. It had to be.He rose from the chair, the motion stiff and automatic, and walked into the kitchen. The drip of the tap was louder here, a maddeningly irregular plink-plonk into the stainless-steel sink. He twisted the handle, putting his shoulder into it until the metal groaned and the sound ceased. The silence that followed was somehow worse, thick and expectant. He stood there for a long time, one hand braced on the chilly formica countertop, the other pressed against his chest, as if he could physically still the frantic bird that was beating against his ribs. Sleep, when it finally came, was a shallow, restless affair, punctuated by dreams of falling confetti that turned to snow, and the distant, mournful sound of a car horn that wouldn't stop.\n\nThe next morning, Wednesday, dawned grey and damp. The absence of his uniform felt like a missing limb. He made toast and let it go cold on the plate, his appetite gone. The house felt too big, too quiet. To fill the silence, he decided to practice. He stood in the centre of the living room, a space designed for two armchairs and a small television, and took a deep, preparatory breath. He started with scales, his voice tentative at first, a guest in his own home. Then he let it swell, the notes of the Welsh hymn, \u2018Calon L\u00e2n\u2019, filling the small room, vibrating through the floorboards and rattling the ceramic birds on the mantelpiece. The sound was too large for the space. It bounced off the floral wallpaper and the low ceiling, feeling trapped and desperate. It was a voice made for cathedrals and grand theatres, and here it was, caged in a terraced house by a canal. He stopped mid-phrase, the final note hanging unfinished in the air, a profound sense of inadequacy washing over him.\n\nHis phone rang, startling him. It was his mother.\n\u201cAre you practising, love?\u201d she asked, her voice bright. \u201cI thought I could hear angels.\u201d\nHe smiled, the tension in his shoulders easing. \u201cJust making a racket, Mam.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a racket, it\u2019s a gift. Now, I\u2019ve been thinking. Your sister can\u2019t get the time off work, more\u2019s the pity, but her Dave said he\u2019ll drive me down on Saturday morning. We\u2019ll be there in the audience. I\u2019ve bought a new hat. Peacock blue.\u201d\nArthur\u2019s blood ran cold. The shiver from the stockroom was back, intense and sharp. His mother, on the motorway, for five hours. Her brother-in-law Dave, a man whose driving philosophy was to treat the accelerator as an on/off switch. The image from the night before flooded his mind: the squeal of tyres, the sickening crunch. It was so vivid, so visceral, that he had to sit down.\n\u201cArthur? You still there? You\u2019ve gone quiet.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 that\u2019s a long way for you to come, Mam.\u201d\n\u201cNonsense. I wouldn\u2019t miss it for the world. Seeing my boy\u2026 seeing his dream come true. I\u2019ll wave the hat. You\u2019ll see me.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, Mam,\u201d he said, his voice a hoarse whisper. \u201cI\u2019ll look for you.\u201d\nHe ended the call feeling ten times more terrified than before. The stakes had been raised to an impossible height. It wasn\u2019t just about him and his voice anymore. It was about his mother\u2019s new hat, her proud, beaming face in the crowd, and her safe passage down a hundred and eighty miles of unforgiving tarmac.\n\nHe had to get out. He pulled on a coat and walked towards the town centre, his head down, hoping to remain invisible. It was a futile hope. The headline \u2018Lancaster\u2019s Lark\u2019 had made his face, once part of the city\u2019s quiet background, into a local landmark.\n\u201cThere he is! Arthur!\u201d A woman with a pushchair beamed at him. \u201cAll the best, love! We\u2019re all voting for you!\u201d\n\u201cGive \u2018em what for, lad!\u201d shouted a man from a scaffolding rig, his voice echoing across the square.\nArthur nodded, mumbled his thanks, his cheeks burning. He felt like an imposter, a fraud accepting praise for a victory he hadn\u2019t yet earned, and might not survive to see. He bought a newspaper and a pint of milk, the simple transaction feeling strangely theatrical, as if he were playing the part of a normal person. The woman behind the counter refused his money. \u201cOn the house, for our celebrity,\u201d she said with a wink. The kindness felt like another stone added to the weight in his pockets. He retreated home, the front door clicking shut behind him like the closing of a portcullis.\n\nThursday was spent in a fever of anxious preparation. He laid out his one good suit on the bed, polishing his shoes until they shone with a desperate, dark lustre. He packed a small overnight bag with a meticulousness born of sheer panic: toothbrush, shirt, the glittery good luck card from his colleagues, which he tucked into an inside pocket like a talisman. In the afternoon, he went out to the car. He lifted the bonnet of the Fiesta and stared at the engine, a greasy, complex tangle he didn\u2019t understand. He checked the oil and the water, just as his father had taught him, the memory a faint, ghostly echo. He kicked the tyres. He even cleaned the windscreen, scrubbing away a winter\u2019s worth of grime. As he worked, he could feel the cold seeping up from the pavement, a damp chill that settled deep in his marrow. His tired, poppy-red chariot. It looked so small, so fragile. The journey felt less like a drive to London and more like a voyage across a vast, uncertain ocean, in a vessel he was no longer sure he could trust. He locked it and went back inside, the premonition no longer a fleeting sound, but a low, constant hum beneath the surface of his thoughts. He was no longer sure it was just nerves. It felt like a warning.Chapter 2\n\nHe ate a tin of soup for dinner, standing over the sink, the metallic taste coating his tongue. He couldn\u2019t face sitting at the table, couldn't bear the empty chair opposite him. The house, usually a sanctuary of quiet solitude, now felt like a mausoleum. Every creak of the floorboards above, every sigh of the wind in the chimney, sounded like a lament. He went to bed early, hoping to bank a few hours of sleep against the long day to come, but his mind refused to quieten. It played a cruel highlight reel of all his anxieties: the intimidating vastness of the London studio, the sea of expectant faces, the crushing weight of a high note held for too long. But beneath it all, the dominant theme, the relentless undertone, was the M6 motorway. A long, grey ribbon of tarmac, slick with rain, hemmed in by roaring lorries.\n\nLying in the dark, the image became terrifyingly clear. He saw his mother's peacock-blue hat, a bright splash of colour in the crumpled wreckage of a small car. He heard her laughter abruptly cut short. He felt the cold shock of impact, a phantom jolt that made him flinch in his bed. It wasn\u2019t a dream or a memory; it was a scene playing out in the theatre of his mind with the brutal clarity of a premonition. He sat bolt upright, his pyjamas damp with a cold sweat, his breath coming in ragged gasps. The feeling was no longer a shiver or a hum. It was a certainty, as solid and unshakeable as the stone of Lancaster Castle. Something terrible was waiting for his mother on that road.\n\nSleep was impossible after that. He spent the rest of the night pacing the small landing, a ghost in his own home, from the spare room filled with boxes of his mother's old things to the top of the stairs and back again. He tried to rationalise it. He was under immense pressure. He was exhausted. It was a textbook case of pre-performance jitters manifesting in a morbid fantasy. He told himself this over and over, the words a hollow mantra, but the cold conviction in his gut refused to yield. Reason was a flimsy shield against a fear so primal. The sun rose on Friday morning to find him grey-faced and hollow-eyed, sitting in the armchair with the framed photograph of him and his mother held tightly in his hands.\n\nAt eight o'clock, he loaded his bag and suit carrier into the Fiesta. The car seemed to sag under the minimal weight, its poppy-red paintwork looking less faded and more anaemic in the thin morning light. He ran his hand over the driver\u2019s side wing, the slightly-off shade of red a testament to a past mistake. He thought of his sister\u2019s husband, Dave, a man who drove with a kind of belligerent confidence Arthur found terrifying. He pictured Dave's heavy-set hands on the steering wheel, his foot pressing down, his mind on getting to London in record time rather than the precious cargo beside him. The simple act of putting the key in the ignition felt like a monumental betrayal. He was starting his journey, the one that would, in turn, set his mother on hers. He turned the key. The engine coughed, spluttered, then grudgingly caught, settling into its familiar, uneven idle.\n\nThe first hour of the drive south was a form of torture. His knuckles were white on the steering wheel, his eyes scanning the road, the mirrors, the sky, searching for threats. Every car that loomed in his rear-view mirror was a potential aggressor, every patch of shadow on the road ahead a treacherous slick of oil. The familiar landscape of Lancashire blurred into an indistinguishable smear of green and grey. He kept the radio off, unable to bear the thought of a cheerful DJ or a pop song intruding on his high-strung vigil. The only sounds were the drone of the engine and the whistle of the wind through the aging door seals, a lonely, mournful sound that perfectly matched his mood. He was \u2018Lancaster\u2019s Lark\u2019, heading for the biggest moment of his life, and he had never felt less like singing.\n\nJust south of Knutsford services, it happened. A white van, its sides caked with mud, had been tailgating him for miles. Impatient, the driver suddenly swerved out, cutting in front of a blue saloon in the middle lane to overtake Arthur. The saloon driver, startled, slammed on their brakes. The sound, a high-pitched, desperate screech of rubber on tarmac, tore through the cabin of the Fiesta. Arthur\u2019s heart stopped. His foot stomped on his own brake pedal out of pure reflex, the car lurching as it slowed. The premonition was real. The sound he had heard in his head, in his dreams, was now echoing on the M6, just a hundred feet in front of him. The saloon swerved, corrected itself, and sped on, the moment of danger passing in a heartbeat. But for Arthur, time had frozen. The world went silent, his ears ringing with that terrible sound. He was shaking so violently he could barely keep his hands on the wheel.\n\nHe indicated, his movements jerky and uncoordinated, and steered the little Fiesta onto the hard shoulder, bumping to a halt behind the steel crash barrier. He switched off the engine, and the sudden silence was deafening. Lorries thundered past, shaking the small car, their slipstream rocking it like a boat in a storm. He leaned his forehead against the cold plastic of the steering wheel, his eyes squeezed shut, but the image of the blue saloon fishtailing was burned onto the back of his eyelids. It could have been them. It could have been Dave\u2019s car. It could have been his mother\u2019s hat. That was it. He couldn\u2019t do it. He couldn\u2019t let her travel. The pride, the glory, the fifteen million viewers, none of it was worth this sickening, absolute certainty of disaster.\n\nWith a trembling hand, he reached for his phone, the one with the spiderweb crack across the screen. He found his mother\u2019s number and pressed the call button, his thumb hovering over it for a long second. This was going to break her heart. She would think he was mad, that the pressure had gotten to him. She would be so disappointed. But disappointing her was better than the alternative his mind kept serving up. He took a deep, shuddering breath, the air tasting of exhaust fumes and fear, and pressed his thumb to the screen. The phone began to ring, each tone a hammer blow against his resolve.\n\u201cArthur? Are you on your way, love? How\u2019s the traffic?\u201d Her voice was full of cheerful excitement, a sound from another, brighter universe.\n\u201cMam,\u201d he began, his own voice a dry, cracked thing. \u201cMam, listen to me. I need you to do something for me. I need you to stay home. Don\u2019t come to London.\u201d\n\nThere was a pause on the other end of the line. When she spoke again, the cheerfulness had been replaced by a puzzled concern. \u201cWhat are you talking about, Arthur? Don\u2019t be silly. Dave\u2019s already put petrol in the car. My hat is in its box by the door. Of course we\u2019re coming.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said, the word coming out with more force than he intended. \u201cNo, Mam, you can\u2019t. It\u2019s not safe. The roads\u2026 the drive. It\u2019s not safe.\u201d\n\u201cNot safe? We\u2019ve driven to your sister\u2019s in Scotland a dozen times, it\u2019s no different. Have you had a prang? Is the car alright?\u201d\n\u201cThe car is fine. I\u2019m fine. It\u2019s\u2026 I have a feeling, Mam. A terrible, awful feeling. Please. For me. Just watch it on the telly. Please stay home.\u201d\nHe could hear the hurt creeping into her voice, a fine crackle of disappointment over the line. \u201cA feeling? Arthur, you\u2019re letting your nerves get the better of you. It\u2019s a big day, I know, but you can\u2019t let silly superstitions take over. I want to be there. I need to be there for you.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I need you to be safe!\u201d he cried, the desperation finally breaking through. His voice was ragged with it. \u201cI can\u2019t explain it. I can\u2019t. But I know it. As sure as I\u2019m sitting here, I know something will happen if you and Dave get on that motorway tomorrow. Mam, please. I\u2019m begging you. If you love me, you\u2019ll stay home.\u201d\n\nThe silence that followed stretched for an eternity. He could picture her in her neat-as-a-pin bungalow, her hand on the receiver, her face a mask of confusion and hurt. This was the one person in the world he never wanted to cause pain, and here he was, crushing her excitement with an insane, inexplicable demand. He heard a resigned sigh.\n\u201cAlright, Arthur,\u201d she said, her voice small and thin, all the light gone from it. \u201cAlright, love. If it\u2019s that important to you. We won\u2019t come.\u201d\nThe relief that flooded him was so immense it made him feel faint, but it was immediately followed by a wave of guilt so profound it was nauseating. He had won. He had kept her safe. And in doing so, he had just broken his mother's heart.\n\u201cThank you, Mam,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI love you.\u201d\n\u201cI love you too, my boy,\u201d she said, but her voice was distant, as if she were already a hundred miles away. \u201cJust\u2026 just do your best, Arthur. Make us proud.\u201d\nThe line went dead. Arthur sat for a long time on the hard shoulder of the M6, the phone limp in his hand, the roar of the traffic a meaningless drone. He had averted a disaster that only he could see, but he felt no victory. He just felt utterly, completely alone.He restarted the engine. The sound was flat and ordinary now, stripped of all its menacing portent. Pulling back onto the motorway felt like merging into a different reality. The terror was gone, lanced like a boil, but what remained was a landscape bleached of all colour, a world rendered in shades of grey. He was safe. She was safe. This was the knowledge he had to cling to, the central pillar around which the ruins of the day were collapsing. He had paid for that safety with his mother\u2019s happiness, a currency he never thought he\u2019d have to spend. The guilt was a cold, heavy passenger sitting beside him, its weight pressing the little car closer to the tarmac.\n\nThe remainder of the drive was a featureless crawl through a country that no longer felt like his own. He passed signs for places he'd only ever heard of, each one a marker taking him further from the life he understood, from the man he was just this morning. The vibrant, terrifying future he had been hurtling towards had been replaced by a quiet, hollow present. By the time the dense, sprawling suburbs of London began to close in around him, he felt less like a finalist arriving for his moment of glory and more like a fugitive, fleeing the scene of a crime only he knew he had committed.\n\nThe television studio was a world of polished glass and aggressive cheerfulness. A security guard, whose neck was thicker than Arthur\u2019s thigh, checked his name off a list and directed him towards an underground car park. The tired, poppy-red Fiesta looked shabby and out of place parked between a gleaming black Range Rover and a silver Mercedes. He felt a sudden, fierce loyalty to the little car, his partner in the strange, lonely ordeal of the morning. He grabbed his suit carrier and bag and walked into the bright, air-conditioned belly of the beast, feeling the quiet life of Lancaster slough off him with every step. He was greeted almost immediately by Chloe, the producer, who moved with a velocity that seemed to defy the normal laws of physics.\n\u201cArthur! You made it! Traffic a nightmare?\u201d she asked, her smile a perfect, dazzling crescent.\n\u201cNot too bad,\u201d he lied, the words tasting like ash in his mouth. His own smile felt like a poorly fitting mask.\n\u201cBrilliant. We\u2019ve got you scheduled for a sound check and camera rehearsal in thirty minutes on the main stage. Just to get you comfortable with the space. Feeling good? You look a bit pale.\u201d\n\u201cJust the drive,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m fine. Ready to go.\u201d\n\nThe stage was bigger and more terrifying than it looked on television. It was a vast, dark cavern, dominated by a galaxy of lights suspended from a grid high above. Screens the size of houses flanked the performance area, currently displaying a generic, swirling blue pattern. Technicians in black t-shirts scurried about, speaking a clipped, technical language he didn\u2019t understand, their headsets glowing with small red lights. It was a factory for dreams, and he was just one small, trembling component on the assembly line. He thought of Mrs Gable, patting his hand. He thought of the collection from the staff at The Gilded Fork, the wad of fifties tucked in his jacket. He thought of his mother\u2019s voice, small and wounded, over the phone. He had to do this for them. He had to make it mean something.\n\nHe was led to a chalk mark on the floor, an \u2018X\u2019 that felt unnervingly like the target in a shooting gallery. A disembodied voice from the darkness asked him to sing a few bars, just for a level check. He opened his mouth, and for a terrifying second, nothing came out. His throat was tight, his lungs empty. Panic, cold and sharp, seized him. Then he thought of the song he had chosen. \u2018Calon L\u00e2n\u2019. A Pure Heart. The irony was so bitter, so profound, it almost made him laugh. What would his mother, who had taught him the hymn, think of him singing it now, with a heart so heavy with deceit? And in that moment, the song transformed. It was no longer a simple plea for a pure heart. It was an apology. A confession. A prayer for forgiveness sent across the miles. He took a breath, closed his eyes, and sang.\n\nThe voice that filled the empty auditorium was not the one he had practiced in his living room. That voice had been hopeful, ambitious. This was something else entirely. It was saturated with a sorrow so deep and a longing so raw that it seemed to vibrate in the very air around him. He sang of a pure heart, full of goodness, fairer than the lily white, but his voice carried the weight of the impure heart he now possessed, the one that had chosen a painful lie over a terrible truth. He wasn't performing; he was unburdening himself. As the final, mournful notes of the Welsh melody faded into the vast darkness of the studio, a profound silence descended. The scurrying technicians had stopped. The disembodied voice was quiet. For a moment, the only sound was the frantic, guilty beating of his own heart.\n\nThen Chloe\u2019s voice, softer now, cut through the quiet. \u201cArthur\u2026 that was\u2026 my God.\u201d She walked towards him from the wings, her usual slick confidence replaced by a look of genuine awe. \u201cThat\u2019s it. That\u2019s the performance. The emotion in that\u2026 it\u2019s a guaranteed win.\u201d She didn't understand. She saw powerful art, a masterful interpretation. She couldn\u2019t see the jagged pieces of the morning's bargain that he had just stitched together into a song. He felt a wave of dizziness, the disconnect between her reality and his own making the world tilt on its axis. He had turned his private, gut-wrenching grief into a product, a commodity to be sold to fifteen million people. The thought made him feel sick to his stomach.\n\nThe rest of the afternoon passed in a blur of interviews, costume fittings, and more instructions. He was moved from room to room, a polite, quiet puppet whose strings were being pulled by a dozen different people. He met the other finalists, a fresh-faced girl band and a street-dance troupe whose youthful energy seemed to suck the very air from the room. They were buzzing with an uncomplicated excitement, their families flanking them, laughing and taking photos. Arthur watched them from a distance, an island of solitude in a sea of celebration. He felt a hundred years older than all of them. When he was finally given the key to his hotel room late in the evening, the simple act of closing the door and being alone felt like a gasp of air after being held underwater. The room was sterile and impersonal, but the silence was a balm. He sank onto the edge of the king-sized bed, his suit carrier still in his hand, a soldier who had survived the battle, only to find the war had moved inside him.Chapter 3\n\nHe did not unpack. The suit remained in its carrier, a dark spectre hanging on the wardrobe door, and his overnight bag sat by the bed like a patient, neglected dog. The hotel room, with its anonymous beige walls and bland corporate art, offered no comfort, only a deeper sense of displacement. He tried to watch television, flicking through channels of shouting quiz shows and slick dramas, but the bright, flickering images were an assault. They belonged to a world of casual entertainment, a world he no longer felt a part of. He turned it off, and the silence rushed back in, thick with the low hum of the city and the even lower hum of his own disquiet. He was a hundred and eighty miles from home, but he had never felt so far away.\n\nPulling the glittery card from his jacket, he opened it on the desk. The scrawled messages of support from his colleagues at The Gilded Fork swam before his eyes. \u2018Go get \u2018em, Arthur!\u2019, \u2018You\u2019ve got this!\u2019, \u2018Smash it\u2019. Honest, simple words of encouragement that now felt like accusations. They believed in \u2018Lancaster\u2019s Lark\u2019, the humble waiter with the golden voice. They didn\u2019t know he was a liar, a man who had manipulated his own mother\u2019s love out of a terror he couldn't even prove was real. The wad of cash Mr Henderson had given him was still tucked inside. He laid the notes out on the polished desk, a small fortune that felt like blood money. He had to call her. He couldn\u2019t bear the thought of her sitting in her bungalow, her new hat in its box, her heart aching with a disappointment he had so selfishly inflicted.\n\nHis finger trembled as he dialled. She answered on the second ring, her voice quieter than it had been that morning.\n\u201cArthur?\u201d\n\u201cMam. It\u2019s me. I\u2019m at the hotel.\u201d\n\u201cOh, good. It\u2019s a nice one, is it? You get yourself some room service. Don\u2019t you go hungry.\u201d The familiar fussing was there, but it was strained, a habit performed without its usual warmth.\n\u201cMam, I\u2019m so sorry,\u201d he whispered, the words catching in his throat. \u201cAbout today. About asking you not to come. It was a cruel thing to do.\u201d\nHe heard her take a long, slow breath. \u201cNo, love. It wasn\u2019t cruel. It was\u2026 strange. But you were frightened. I could hear it in your voice. I\u2019ve never heard you sound like that before.\u201d\n\u201cI just\u2026 I had this feeling. This awful, certain feeling.\u201d\n\u201cI know,\u201d she said softly, and in those two words, he heard not judgement, but a deep, maternal acceptance that was more shattering than any anger could have been. \u201cA mother knows. I knew something was wrong. I\u2019m just glad you\u2019re alright. That\u2019s all that matters. Your sister\u2019s here with me now. We\u2019re going to get a curry in and watch you on the big telly. We\u2019ll be screaming so loud you\u2019ll probably hear us in London.\u201d\nThe image of them, safe in Lancaster, a takeaway carton on the coffee table, was so potent it brought tears to his eyes. It was an image of normal life, the life he had so callously disrupted. He had protected that life, but he had also placed himself outside of it.\n\u201cI love you, Mam.\u201d\n\u201cI love you too, my Arthur. Now stop your worrying. You\u2019ve got a big day tomorrow. You get some sleep, and you go out there and you sing that beautiful song. You sing it for your old mam, alright?\u201d\n\u201cAlright, Mam,\u201d he promised, his voice thick with unshed tears. \u201cFor you.\u201d\n\nHe slept, but it was a thin, fitful sleep, more a series of brief, anxious blackouts than a period of rest. He woke long before the dawn, the grey light of a London morning seeping through a gap in the curtains. Saturday. The day of the final. The knot of dread in his stomach had been joined by a strange, cold sense of purpose. The performance was no longer about winning. It was about fulfilling his promise to his mother. It was the only act of penance he could offer. He showered and dressed in his suit, the fabric feeling stiff and unfamiliar. Looking in the mirror, he saw a stranger. The face was his, but the eyes were haunted, carrying the weight of the last twenty-four hours. He was Arthur Penhaligon, the waiter, dressed in the costume of a star, about to go on stage and sing a hymn about a pure heart he no longer believed he possessed.\n\nThe studio was a hive of frantic, joyous energy that felt utterly alien. Dancers stretched in corridors, singers warmed up their voices in dressing rooms, and families gathered in clutches, their faces shining with pride and excitement. Arthur moved through it all like a ghost, his polite nods and quiet smiles a fragile shield against the overwhelming atmosphere. Chloe found him by the catering table, where he was staring into a cup of coffee he had no intention of drinking.\n\u201cThe man of the hour!\u201d she chirped, her energy relentless. \u201cHow are we feeling? You were a different man in rehearsal yesterday. Found another gear. If you can bring just half of that to the stage tonight, you\u2019ll walk this.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll do my best,\u201d Arthur said, the phrase a hollow echo of his mother\u2019s words.\nHe spent the hours before the live show in his designated dressing room, a small, windowless box with a mirror framed in bare lightbulbs. He didn\u2019t practice. He didn\u2019t pace. He just sat, the silence of the room a temporary refuge from the chaos outside and the storm within. He thought of his route home from The Gilded Fork, the earthy smell of the canal, the quiet click of his own front door. He thought of the folded serviette, the first casualty of an evening that now seemed a lifetime ago. He was a constellation of tiny, rehearsed movements, but the man he had been, the man who tried to be invisible, was gone forever. In his place was this new, terrified creature, about to be seen by millions.\n\nWhen the call came, he walked to the stage on legs that felt disconnected from his body. The roar of the live audience was a physical force, a wave of heat and sound that washed over him as he stepped into the lights. He found his chalk mark, the familiar \u2018X\u2019 on the vast, dark floor. He could see the judges at their desk, their faces lit from below, looking like pagan gods about to pass judgement. The host gave him a thumbs-up and a blinding smile. Fifteen million people. His mother and his sister, with their curry. Mrs Gable. Mr Henderson. Ben. All of Lancaster. He took a deep breath, the air thick with the artificial scent of dry-ice smoke. The opening chords of \u2018Calon L\u00e2n\u2019 began, soft and simple on the piano. He found the camera with the glowing red light, the one that looked directly into the homes of the nation. He looked into its dark, unblinking lens, and he sang.\n\nHe sang not to the judges, not to the roaring crowd, but to the small living room on the terraced street by the canal. Every note was an apology. Every soaring phrase was a plea for forgiveness. He poured all the fear of the last three days, the sickening premonition on the motorway, the lie he had told his mother, the profound guilt that now defined him, into the melody. He sang of the pure heart he longed for, and the sound that emerged was one of heartbreaking, desolate beauty. It was the sound of a man who had glimpsed his soul\u2019s desire only to find he had to trade a piece of his soul to get there. As the final, whispered note hung in the air, the studio was utterly silent. No one coughed. No one cheered. The nation held its breath. Then, the silence was shattered by an explosion of applause, a roar so thunderous it seemed to shake the very foundations of the building. Arthur stood, unmoving, tears he hadn't realised he was crying now tracing hot tracks down his cheeks.\n\nThe host\u2019s arm was around his shoulder, the judges were on their feet, their faces a mixture of shock and reverence. The praise they showered on him was a meaningless babble of superlatives. \u201cTranscendent.\u201d \u201cA moment of television history.\u201d \u201cThe performance of a lifetime.\u201d He just nodded, his eyes fixed on that dark camera lens, his heart pounding a frantic, exhausted rhythm. The voting lines closed. He stood between the giggling girl band and the hyper-masculine dance troupe as the tension was drawn out to its breaking point. He felt nothing. He was hollowed out, an empty vessel waiting for a verdict he no longer cared about.\n\u201cAnd the winner,\u201d the host bellowed, his voice reaching a crescendo, \u201cthe winner of a recording contract and two hundred and fifty thousand pounds\u2026 is\u2026 ARTHUR PENHALIGON!\u201d\nConfetti cannons exploded, showering him in a blizzard of shimmering gold and silver paper, just as he had once imagined. The roar of the crowd was deafening. The girl band hugged him, the dancers clapped him on the back. A heavy, ornate trophy was thrust into his hands. He was surrounded by celebration, bathed in the warmth of a thousand stage lights, his dream made real in the most spectacular way possible. And as he lifted the trophy, forcing a smile for the cameras, one thought echoed in the silent, empty chamber of his heart. I wish I had used a coaster. He felt a strange, unseasonable shiver, a sudden, deep cold that had nothing to do with the temperature. The victory was his. But the joy was a hundred and eighty miles north, sitting in a small bungalow, watching a different show entirely.The chaos that followed was a form of drowning. He was passed from the host\u2019s embrace to a frantic floor manager, then into a scrum of reporters whose flashing cameras were like bursts of shrapnel in the dazzling air. Questions were thrown at him, a barrage of unintelligible noise from which he could only pick out single words: \u2018dream\u2019, \u2018mother\u2019, \u2018Lancaster\u2019, \u2018future\u2019. He answered with a series of nods and mumbled phrases that seemed to satisfy them, his mind a perfect, humming blank. He felt the heavy trophy in his hands, its cold, engraved metal the only thing that felt real. It was an anchor in a sea of unreality, and it was dragging him down.\n\nChloe finally materialised, cleaving a path through the media throng like a sharp-prowed ship. She grabbed his arm, her grip surprisingly strong, her smile somehow even wider and more brilliant than before. \u201cThere you are! We\u2019re losing you to the press already! Come on, we\u2019ve got a champagne reception in the green room. The head of the label wants to meet you. Arthur, do you have any idea what you\u2019ve just done?\u201d she said, her voice a giddy torrent as she steered him down a brightly lit corridor. He looked at her, at the pure, uncomplicated triumph in her eyes, and felt a pang of something like envy. For her, this was a simple, glorious victory. For him, it was a complex and terrible equation that he was no closer to solving.\n\nThe green room was even louder and more crowded than the stage had been. Music throbbed from hidden speakers, and the air was thick with the scent of champagne and expensive ambition. Faces he recognised from television and magazines turned to him, their smiles ready, their hands outstretched. He was the commodity of the hour. He shook hands, accepted congratulations, and allowed a glass of fizz to be pressed into his palm. He held it, watching the tiny bubbles race to the surface, and thought of the G&T glass and the wilting serviette. That felt like a hundred years ago, a scene from someone else's life. He was introduced to a man in a razor-sharp suit, the fabled head of Syco, who clapped him on the shoulder and spoke of albums and global markets. The words washed over Arthur, meaningless as the tide.\n\nHe needed to call his mother. The need was a physical ache, a sharp point of focus in the swirling chaos. Excusing himself with a muttered apology, he found a quieter corner by a vending machine that sold only water and protein bars. He leaned against the cool glass, the thumping bass from the party a dull, rhythmic punch in his back. He pulled out his phone, the cracked screen seeming like an artefact from a lost civilisation. His hands were shaking again. He pressed her number, and the world narrowed to the small device in his hand. She answered instantly, her voice a shriek of pure, unadulterated joy.\n\u201cARTHUR! YOU DID IT! OH, MY BOY, YOU DID IT! We were screaming, the whole street could hear us! Oh, the neighbours are banging on the walls! I don\u2019t even care! My boy! My beautiful, beautiful boy!\u201d\n\nHe closed his eyes, leaning his head back against the machine. Her happiness was a sun so bright it burned him. He had to shield himself from it, and he had to reflect it back at her. \u201cWe did it, Mam,\u201d he said, forcing a lightness into his voice that felt like a physical strain. \u201cI told you I\u2019d do it for you.\u201d\n\u201cOh, love. You did it for you! I\u2019ve never been so proud in all my life. Never. Your sister is in floods of tears. Happy tears, mind. Just\u2026 oh, Arthur. That song. It was like you were singing just to me. It broke my heart and put it back together again all at once.\u201d\nThe knot in his stomach tightened into a cold, hard stone. She was right. He had been singing just to her. He had been confessing his sins in a language only his heart understood, and she had heard it as a love song. The chasm between his truth and her perception was vast and dark, and he was stranded on one side, utterly alone. He listened to her talk, her words tumbling over one another in a rush of pride and plans for a welcome-home party. He made the right noises, laughed in the right places, and felt a part of himself curdle and die with every fake expression of joy. When he finally ended the call, the silence he was left with was more profound than any he had ever known.\n\nHe couldn't go back to the party. He couldn't bear another smile, another handshake, another syllable of praise for the performance that had cost him so much. He found a side exit, a plain fire door that opened into a cool, dark alleyway smelling of damp bins and rain. The sudden quiet was a mercy. He stood there for a long time, breathing in the grubby London air, the trophy still clutched in one hand. He was the winner. He had a recording contract and a quarter of a million pounds to his name. He was Lancaster\u2019s Lark, and he had never felt more like a common crow, perched on a wire, watching a world he could no longer join. A taxi slowed as it passed the end of the alley, its orange light a beacon. Without a second thought, he raised his hand.\n\nThe journey back to the hotel was a silent film played outside the cab window. The city lights smeared into long, watercolour streaks, a beautiful, abstract painting of a life he had no part in. The driver, sensing his passenger\u2019s mood, left the radio off. In the quiet, Arthur looked down at the trophy sitting on the seat beside him. It was a stylised figure, reaching for a star. It was gaudy and magnificent and unbearably heavy. He arrived at the hotel and walked through the hushed, empty lobby, the night porter giving him a curious, respectful nod. Inside his room, he didn't turn on the main lights. He placed the trophy on the desk, its polished gold catching the low lamplight. Then he took the wad of cash from his suit pocket and laid it carefully beside the gleaming statue. The collection from his colleagues. The prize money. The two sat side by side, symbols of a beginning and an end, though he wasn't sure which was which. He was free of The Gilded Fork, but he was now bound to something far larger and more terrifying.Chapter 4\n\nSleep had not come, only a grey truce with consciousness that fractured just before sunrise. Arthur found himself staring at the ceiling, tracing the faint water stain in the corner that looked like a map of a country he would never visit. The previous night\u2019s adrenaline had evaporated, leaving behind a residue of profound exhaustion and a clarity that was worse than the chaos. He was a winner. The thought didn't land with a triumphant crash but with the soft, dull thud of a sandbag. He turned his head. The trophy sat on the desk, a sentinel in the gloom, seeming to absorb all the light in the room and give nothing back. It was a monument to a lie.\n\nHis mobile phone, lying beside it, began to vibrate. The noise was aggressive, insistent, a trapped, angry insect against the polished wood. He knew who it would be. Chloe, or someone from her world of schedules and opportunities. He let it buzz, the sound a physical manifestation of the new life that was already clawing at his door, demanding entry. When it stopped, a profound silence descended, only to be shattered moments later as it began again. With a sigh that seemed to drain him of his last reserve of energy, he reached for it. The screen glowed with her name.\n\n\u201cArthur! Morning, superstar! Hope you slept well, you\u2019ve earned it!\u201d Chloe\u2019s voice was pure, undiluted caffeine. \u201cListen, big day. We\u2019ve got a car coming for you in an hour. First up is a breakfast spot on national telly, then a radio blitz, and the label wants to have a preliminary chat about producers this afternoon. We\u2019re striking while the iron is hot, Arthur. This is your moment!\u201d\n\nArthur looked from the trophy to the window, where the sky over London was the colour of dishwater. He thought of his small, cold house, the dripping tap he\u2019d finally silenced, the familiar, worn springs of his armchair. He thought of his mother\u2019s face, not the ecstatic vision from the television screen, but the hurt and confused one he imagined from their phone call on the motorway. A car in an hour. Producers. A radio blitz. It all sounded like a language he had once dreamed of learning but now found he had no aptitude for.\n\n\u201cChloe,\u201d he said, his voice husky with disuse. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d\nThere was a short, sharp silence on the other end. \u201cCan\u2019t? Arthur, this isn\u2019t really optional. This is the launch. This is what you won.\u201d\n\u201cI have to go home,\u201d he said. It wasn\u2019t a request or an excuse; it was a simple statement of fact, as unchangeable as gravity. \u201cI need to go back to Lancaster.\u201d\n\u201cLancaster?\u201d she repeated, the name of his home city sounding like a remote, incomprehensible outpost. \u201cArthur, you\u2019re the hottest property in the country right now. Lancaster can wait. Your life is here now.\u201d\n\u201cMy mother is in Lancaster,\u201d he said, the words a shield and a weapon. \u201cI\u2019m going home.\u201d\n\nHe could almost hear the calculations whirring in her head, the recalibration of strategy. The story of the devoted son was a good one. It was marketable. He could feel her shifting gears. \u201cOkay,\u201d she said, her voice softening, taking on a tone of conspiratorial understanding. \u201cOkay, I get it. Family first. Of course. But just for the day. You drive up, you see your mum, you get your hero\u2019s welcome, and you\u2019re back here Monday morning, nine a.m. sharp. We\u2019ll have a car waiting for you in Lancaster. I\u2019ll make the arrangements. Can you do that for me, Arthur?\u201d\n\nHe agreed, the compromise a small price to pay for escape. After he hung up, he moved with a new sense of purpose. He packed his bag, folded his suit, and carefully wrapped the heavy trophy in a hotel towel before placing it in a laundry bag, hiding its damning gleam. He checked out of the hotel, the receptionist\u2019s star-struck congratulations barely registering. He walked back to the underground car park, back to the one piece of his old life that had made the journey with him. The poppy-red Fiesta looked smaller and more tired than ever, a humble vessel for a king returning in secret. He placed the shrouded trophy on the passenger seat, where it sat like a slumped, silent figure.\n\nThe drive north was the inverse of the journey down. The M6 was no longer a ribbon of terror but a long, monotonous path of penance. The fear was gone, replaced by a dull, persistent ache in the centre of his chest. He turned on the radio, scanning the news bulletins, a grim part of him still searching for a justification for his actions. He listened for reports of accidents, of pile-ups, of anything that might lend substance to the phantom premonition that had ruled him. There was nothing. Just the usual litany of traffic updates, political squabbles, and a story about a prize-winning marrow. The absence of disaster was its own kind of condemnation. He hadn\u2019t averted a tragedy; he had just given in to a fit of madness. The thought was colder and more isolating than any fear had been.\n\nAs the miles dissolved and the familiar, rugged hills of the north began to rise in the distance, his anxiety took on a new shape. It was no longer about what might happen, but about what had. He was driving towards a celebration he didn\u2019t deserve, to accept the praise of a town he had deceived. When he took the exit for Lancaster, his hands were slick on the steering wheel. The city felt different, or perhaps he was the one who was irrevocably changed. As he drove through the outskirts, he saw it. A bedsheet, strung between two lampposts outside a pub. On it, in clumsily painted letters of red and black, were the words: \u2018CONGRATULATIONS ARTHUR! LANCASTER\u2019S LARK SINGS FOR US ALL!\u2019 He had to pull over for a moment, the sight of it making him feel physically ill. It was a banner celebrating a man who didn't exist.\n\nHis own street was unrecognizable. Bunting, the kind usually reserved for a royal wedding, was strung from window to window. Cars were parked haphazardly on the pavement. A small crowd was gathered on the pavement outside his house. They were his neighbours, people he had exchanged polite nods with for a decade. Now they were holding mugs of tea and craning their necks, a makeshift receiving line. And at the centre of it all, standing on the top step by his peeling brown front door, was his mother. She was wearing her peacock-blue hat. She had put it on just for him. As he turned the corner in his little red car, a cheer went up. It was a ragged, heartfelt sound that struck him with the force of a physical blow. He brought the car to a halt and killed the engine. For a long, silent moment, he couldn\u2019t move. He couldn\u2019t breathe. This was it. The moment of reckoning. He had to get out of the car and walk into their pride, into their joy, and pretend it was his own. He had to face the woman in the peacock-blue hat, whose heart he had broken and then filled with a false, shining happiness. He opened the car door, and stepped out into the noise.Chapter 5\n\nThe cheer that went up from the small crowd was a physical thing, a wave of sound and emotion that washed over him, threatening to sweep his legs from under him. He stood frozen by the open door of the Fiesta, a fixed, brittle smile cracking on his face. His name was being called from a dozen different mouths, a name that suddenly felt like a title, a role he was required to play. Hands patted his back, clutched his arm. Mr Egan from number 12, a man he\u2019d only ever shared terse nods with over the garden fence, was grinning at him, his eyes suspiciously bright. The woman from the bakery was there, holding out a plate of Eccles cakes like an offering. It was a carnival of goodwill, and he was the unwilling main attraction, a man being celebrated for surviving a shipwreck of his own making.\n\nThrough the shifting sea of faces, he saw her. His mother, Elsie, making her way towards him, a small, determined figure parting the crowd. The peacock-blue hat was perched perfectly, a defiant splash of colour against the grey Lancaster sky. It was the hat she had bought for a journey she never made, a journey he had forbidden. Now, repurposed for this moment of victory, it seemed not a symbol of her pride, but an emblem of his deceit. As she reached him, her face, a delicate roadmap of her life, was alight with a joy so pure it was painful to look at. She threw her arms around his neck, and he hugged her back, burying his face in her shoulder, breathing in the familiar scent of lavender polish and Earl Grey tea. He felt the slight tremor in her hands as she held him. \"Oh, my boy,\" she whispered, her voice choked with emotion, audible only to him. \"You\u2019re home. You\u2019re finally home.\" The simple words were both a benediction and a curse, and he held on tighter, a drowning man clinging to the source of his own storm.\n\nThe momentum of the crowd was irresistible, a gentle but firm tide that propelled him out of the street and into his own house. His sister, Sarah, was waiting just inside the door, her face red and swollen from crying. She crushed him in a hug, sobbing and laughing at the same time. \"I can't believe it, Art! I just can't believe it's you!\" His small hallway, usually a space of quiet passage, was crammed with neighbours, their coats piled on the newel post. The house was alive, thrumming with a boisterous energy it had never known. He felt a profound sense of dislocation, as if he had walked into the correct address but the wrong life. Everything was the same\u2014the worn patch on the carpet by the door, the framed print of Morecambe Bay hanging slightly askew\u2014but it was all re-contextualized, the set of a play in which he no longer knew his lines.\n\n\"Right then, where is it?\" a voice boomed. It was his brother-in-law, Dave, a man whose presence filled any room. \"The main event! Let\u2019s have a look at the trophy!\" A murmur of agreement went through the assembled party. All eyes turned to Arthur. His hands were empty. He had left it in the car, shrouded in its cheap hotel towel, a guilty secret on the passenger seat. The thought of bringing it into this house, into this celebration, made his stomach clench. But there was no escape. \"It's in the car,\" he said, his voice sounding thin and distant to his own ears. \"I'll go and get it.\" The short walk back down the garden path was a strange reprieve. For a few seconds, he was alone, the front door closing behind him, muffling the joyful chatter. He opened the car door and looked at the lumpy shape on the seat. It felt heavier now, weighted with the expectation of the people inside.\n\nHe walked back into the living room holding the graceless bundle. The conversations stopped. A space was cleared for him on the sofa next to his mother, an expectant hush falling over the room. He felt like a magician about to perform a trick he hadn't rehearsed. Slowly, deliberately, he placed the bag on the coffee table and peeled back the thin, worn towel. The studio lights had made the trophy seem magnificent, but here, in the gentle light of his own living room, it looked almost vulgar. It was too big, too shiny, an ostentatious piece of gilded metal that didn't belong amongst the familiar clutter of his life. A collective gasp went through the room, a sound of pure awe. \"Oh, Arthur,\" his mother breathed, her hand going to her mouth. \"It's real.\" He was forced to pick it up, to pass it around, each person who touched it imbuing it with more significance, more power. He watched it move from hand to hand, a holy relic being venerated by a congregation of the faithful, and he, the high priest, was the only one who knew it was a fake.\n\nEventually, he was allowed to sink into his own worn armchair, the springs groaning a familiar welcome. The trophy had been given the place of honour on the mantelpiece, where it dwarfed his mother's collection of ceramic birds. A mug of tea, strong and sweet just the way he liked it, was pressed into his hands. The room buzzed around him, a kaleidoscope of happy, familiar faces. His sister was recounting the moment his name was announced, acting it out with wild gestures. Dave was explaining to Mr Egan how he\u2019d always known Arthur had it in him. His mother just sat on the sofa, her gaze fixed on him, her smile a constant, unwavering beacon of pride. He was the centre of their universe, the quiet man who had roared. He smiled, he nodded, he answered questions about the judges and the after-party, and with every word, he felt a piece of himself calcify. He had returned to his sanctuary, only to find it had become his stage, and this performance was the most difficult of his life. He caught his own reflection in the dark, blank screen of the television opposite. He saw a man in a rumpled suit, holding a mug of tea, a faint, polite smile on his face. He looked like a stranger at his own victory party.Dave clapped him on the shoulder, jolting him from his reverie. His brother-in-law\u2019s face was ruddy with excitement and probably a few celebratory cans he\u2019d had while waiting. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what, mate, you saved me a job! Five hours down the M6, I\u2019d have been chewing my own arm off. Elsie was gutted, mind. But you were right, looking back. Saturday traffic, it would have been murder. We\u2019d probably still be stuck in a jam outside Birmingham!\u201d He laughed, a loud, booming sound that filled the small room. Arthur felt a cold lurch in his gut. There it was, the phantom journey, spoken of so casually, so blithely. Dave\u2019s words, meant to be a simple jest, were a series of hammer blows against the fragile wall of his composure. He managed a weak smile, the muscles in his face screaming in protest. \"Probably for the best,\" he heard himself say, the words tasting like poison.\n\nThe afternoon wore on in a series of similar, painful vignettes. He was an actor in an endless improvisation, his only props a teacup and a weary smile. He listened to theories about his future career, accepted advice on how to invest his prize money, and nodded as people reminisced about his first solo in the school choir. Each well-meaning comment, each expression of vicarious joy, felt like another layer of earth being shovelled onto the man he used to be. The noise was constant, a cheerful, suffocating blanket of sound that left no room for his own thoughts. At one point, seeking refuge, he offered to make another pot of tea and escaped into the tiny kitchen. He stood for a moment with his back to the door, one hand braced on the cool formica, just breathing. The familiar drip from the tap was gone, and he felt a pang of loss for the imperfect, quiet life he had so thoroughly obliterated.\n\nBy late afternoon, the crowd began to thin. Neighbours, with final handshakes and promises to \"keep an eye on the house when you're a big star,\" drifted back to their own homes. The front door, which had been perpetually open, was finally closed, and the sudden drop in volume was startling. The living room, which had felt impossibly full, now seemed vast and empty, littered with the evidence of a party: empty mugs, a plate of half-eaten cakes, a stray paper napkin. Only his mother, his sister, and Dave remained. The boisterous energy of the celebration dissipated, leaving behind something quieter, more intense, and infinitely more difficult to navigate. The performance was over, and now he was left with just his family, the people who knew him best, and who he was now fooling the most.\n\nSarah eventually declared she needed to get Dave home before he fell asleep in the armchair. Their departure was a flurry of final hugs and whispered instructions to his mother to make sure he ate something proper. Then, silence. Arthur stood in the hallway, listening to their car drive away, until the only sound was the low hum of his own refrigerator. He turned back to the living room. His mother was there, carefully collecting the used mugs. She hadn't put on the main light, and in the gathering dusk, she looked small and fragile. She put the mugs down and turned to him, her face etched with a love that felt like a physical weight. \"You look tired, my love,\" she said, her voice soft. \"Not happy-tired. Just\u2026 worn to the bone. That place\u2026 it took something out of you, didn't it?\" It wasn\u2019t an accusation. It was a simple, devastatingly accurate observation. He wanted to tell her everything, to confess the premonition, the lie, the crushing weight of it all. But looking at her proud, tired face, at the peacock-blue hat still perched on the hall table where she\u2019d left it, he knew he couldn\u2019t. He couldn't tarnish this for her. It was the one pure thing left.\n\n\"It was a lot, Mam,\" he said, the understatement a chasm. \"I just need a bit of sleep, that's all.\" He managed a smile he hoped was reassuring. She came to him and patted his cheek, her skin as fine and dry as parchment. \"Of course, you do. You're home now. That's all that matters. You're home.\" She kissed him on the forehead and made her slow, careful way up the stairs to the spare room he always kept ready for her. Arthur remained in the living room, a solitary figure in the twilight. He walked to the mantelpiece and stood before the trophy. In the dim light, it seemed to mock him, a garish monument to his glorious, hollow victory. He reached out and touched its cold, smooth surface. He had done it. He had won. He was home. And he was utterly, irrevocably lost.He did not move for a long time, his fingertips resting on the cold metal. The silence in the house was no longer a peaceful absence of noise, but a presence in itself, thick and judgmental. It pressed in on him, amplifying the frantic monologue in his own head. He felt an urgent, desperate need to do something normal, to perform an action from his old life that might tether him to the man he once was. He retreated to the kitchen, the scene of his earlier, brief escape, and began to gather the dirty mugs. He ran the hot water, the familiar sound of it rushing into the sink a small comfort. He submerged his hands, the heat a mild shock, and began to wash each cup with a methodical, almost frantic precision, scrubbing away the faint lipstick stains and dried tea rings left by his well-wishers. But the simple, domestic ritual brought no solace. He was merely cleaning up after a party he hadn't attended, a ghost tidying the remnants of a life that was no longer his.\n\nSleep was a country to which he had lost his passport. He didn't even try to go to his own bed, knowing the familiar confines of his room would feel like a cage. Instead, he returned to the living room and sank back into his armchair, the worn springs groaning a weary complaint. The street outside grew quiet, the last of the late-night revelers making their way home, their laughter fading into the distance. A single streetlamp cast a pale, orange rectangle of light onto the carpet, a stage on which dust motes danced in a slow, silent ballet. His gaze was drawn, again and again, to the mantelpiece. The trophy sat there, its gilded surface catching the faint light, a constant, gleaming reminder. It was the full stop at the end of the greatest sentence of his life, but the sentence itself was a lie. He thought of Dave's booming laugh, his casual dismissal of the journey. \u2018Saturday traffic, it would have been murder.\u2019 The words echoed, stripped of their jovial intent, becoming a cruel taunt. The universe hadn't offered him validation; it had offered him mockery. His grand, desperate act of love was reduced to a foolish, unnecessary panic. He hadn't saved his mother from a terrible fate; he had simply robbed her of a precious memory.\n\nThe sun rose on Sunday morning with a kind of weary reluctance, painting the sky in shades of bruised grey and tired pink. Arthur hadn't moved from the chair, and his body ached with a deep, unyielding stiffness. He heard the floorboards creak overhead, the familiar sound of his mother waking. He heard the flush of the toilet, the gentle turning of the tap. Each small, domestic noise was a turn of the screw, a reminder of the ordinary life he was now observing from behind a sheet of glass. He forced himself to his feet and went to the kitchen to put the kettle on, a pantomime of his morning routine. When Elsie came downstairs, wrapped in her old chenille dressing gown, she found him standing by the counter, staring into space.\n\"You didn't sleep a wink, did you?\" she said, her voice soft with a concern that was almost unbearable. She put her hand on his arm. \"Arthur, talk to me. What is it? Is it this London business? Are they frightening you?\"\n\"No, Mam,\" he lied, turning to her with a smile that felt like it was cracking his face. \"Just a bit overwhelmed. It's a lot to take in.\"\n\"Well, I've got just the thing,\" she announced, her tone shifting into a determined brightness, a deliberate attempt to chase away the shadows she could so clearly see in his eyes. \"I've been down to the corner shop already. The papers are full of you! Let's have a proper look, with a nice cup of tea.\"\n\nShe spread the Sunday papers out on the small dining table, and he was forced to sit opposite her and look at his own face staring back. There he was, in grainy newsprint, tears on his cheeks, trophy held aloft. 'LANCASHIRE LARK SOARS' screamed one headline. 'WAITER'S PUCCINI DREAM COMES TRUE' proclaimed another. His mother read snippets aloud, her voice filled with a giddy, childlike wonder. She pointed to a quote from a judge, a piece of praise from an anonymous 'insider', a photograph of the cheering crowd. Arthur nodded and made appreciative noises, the sound of her happiness a constant, low-level torture. He felt a desperate urge to confess, to shatter the perfect, newsprint image of her son and show her the terrified, deceitful man sitting opposite her. But the words wouldn't come. They were trapped behind the dam of his love for her, a love that now demanded this terrible, ongoing silence. He was her hero, and a hero could not have feet of clay.\n\nThat afternoon, he knew he had to escape the house. He told his mother he was going for a walk, just to get some fresh air and clear his head. The relief in her eyes was palpable; she thought it a sign of him returning to himself. He walked his old route, his feet carrying him out of instinct towards the canal path. The air was damp and cold, carrying the earthy smell of the water and the faint, distant scent of coal smoke. It was the smell of his life, of his home. Here, away from the bunting and the trophy, the world felt almost normal. He passed other walkers, people who nodded at him with a new, knowing respect. 'Well done, lad,' an old man walking a greyhound said, tipping his cap. Arthur mumbled his thanks, his eyes fixed on the muddy path. He was no longer Arthur Penhaligon; he was a public monument, a landmark to be acknowledged. His anonymity, the invisibility he had cultivated for a decade, was gone forever. It had been the price of his ticket, a cost he hadn't understood until it was paid.\n\nHe stopped by a lock, leaning his arms on the cold, damp stone of the bridge, and stared down into the murky, green water. He thought of the phone call that was coming. Chloe\u2019s voice. A car in the morning. He had a choice. He could pick up the phone and tell her he wasn't coming back. He could tell them to keep the money, to tear up the contract. He could try to disappear back into the quiet life he had left behind, to become the waiter again, to live with the whispers and the pitying looks and the eternal question of 'what if'. He could do that. He could reclaim some small, broken piece of his soul. But what would it do to his mother? Her pride was so fierce, so absolute. To see it all turn to dust, to see her son become a local cautionary tale\u2014it would break her. He had already broken her heart once with his fear; he couldn't break it again with his failure. The choice was a brutal one, but it wasn't really a choice at all. He had to protect her happiness, the very happiness he had so expertly, so cruelly, manufactured. That was his penance now.\n\nWhen he returned to the house, the decision had settled in him, a cold, heavy weight in his gut. His mother was in the living room, carefully placing the newspaper clippings into a scrapbook. She looked up as he entered, her face hopeful.\n\"Feeling better for the fresh air?\" she asked.\nHe nodded, forcing a smile that felt more genuine than any he had managed all weekend. It was the smile of a man who had accepted his sentence. \"Much better, Mam. It cleared my head.\" He walked over to her and kissed the top of her head. \"I've been thinking. I need to pack. The car is coming for me in the morning.\"\nThe relief that flooded her face was his reward and his punishment. \"Oh, good,\" she said, her hands fluttering over the scrapbook. \"That's good, love. You can't let an opportunity like this slip away. This is your time.\"\nThat night, he went to his own room and took out his small overnight bag. He packed his shirt, his toothbrush, the few things he would need for the start of his new life. The movements were automatic, detached. He was preparing not for an adventure, but for a long, arduous tour of duty. Before he closed the bag, he went back downstairs. The house was quiet, his mother already in bed. He stood in the living room doorway and looked at the trophy on the mantelpiece. It stood there, impassive, a golden idol demanding its sacrifice. He had won. He had his mother's pride, a recording contract, a fortune he couldn't comprehend, and a future brighter than he had ever dared to imagine. He had everything he had ever wanted. He just had to leave himself behind to get it.They sat together in the living room that evening, watching the television. A cheerful quiz show filled the screen, the theme tune jarringly upbeat, the contestants\u2019 laughter echoing in the quiet room. His mother was engrossed, occasionally making a comment about a contestant\u2019s questionable choice of haircut or a particularly easy question they had missed. It was a ritual they had shared hundreds of times, a comfortable, unassuming way to pass an evening. But for Arthur, it was an out-of-body experience. He felt as if he were watching not just the television, but the entire scene from a great height: the two figures on the worn sofa, the flickering blue light, the hulking golden trophy on the mantelpiece keeping its silent, glittering vigil. He was no longer a participant. He was a spectator at the wake of his own quiet life.\n\n\u201cOh, she\u2019s a clever one, that one,\u201d his mother murmured, pointing a finger at a young woman on the screen who had just answered a question about astrophysics. \u201cYou\u2019ll be meeting all sorts of clever people now, I expect. People from all over.\u201d She turned to him, her eyes shining with the reflected light of the screen. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to remember to tell me all about them. Don\u2019t you go thinking your old mam won\u2019t be interested in your new London friends.\u201d Her words were full of innocent excitement for a future she imagined was all bright lights and fascinating company. She couldn\u2019t see the shadows that future cast, the sharp-suited men and women who didn't see him, but a product to be shaped and sold. He just smiled and squeezed her hand. \"I'll tell you everything, Mam. I promise.\" It was another lie, a small, necessary brick in the wall he was building around her.\n\nLater, as she prepared to go up to bed, she fussed over him one last time. She straightened the collar of his shirt, a gesture she had been making since he was a small boy in a school uniform. \"You make sure you eat properly down there, Arthur. They all look like they live on air and water on the telly. You need to keep your strength up.\" Her hands were gentle, her concern a familiar, comforting weight. \"And don't let them change you too much, love. You're my Arthur. That's what people voted for. Just you.\" The simple sincerity of her words was a knife twisting in his gut. The man she believed in, the man she was instructing him to be, was the very man he was being forced to abandon. He was a walking paradox, a man whose authenticity was now his greatest performance.\n\nHe lay awake for hours in his own bed that night, the sheets cool against his skin. He listened to the familiar sounds of the house settling, the creak of a floorboard, the distant sigh of the water pipes. This was the last time he would hear this particular symphony of quiet. From tomorrow, his world would be one of studio hums, ringing telephones, and the roar of crowds. He thought of the man he was only a week ago, the waiter whose greatest ambition was a flawlessly folded serviette and a smoothly run evening service. That man had dreamed of singing, but his dreams had been soft-focus fantasies, comforting and contained. He had never imagined the brutal reality of a dream made manifest, the way it could scour you clean of everything you were, leaving a polished, hollow shell behind. The victory had not freed him; it had imprisoned him in a gilded cage.\n\nThe car arrived at precisely nine a.m. It was a sleek, black saloon, its dark, tinted windows reflecting a distorted image of his terraced street. It seemed to suck all the colour from its surroundings, an alien craft that had landed from another, more serious world. Its driver, a young man in a dark suit, didn't get out, but simply sent a polite text: \u2018Your car is outside.\u2019 Arthur looked at his old Fiesta parked further down the road, its poppy-red paintwork looking cheerful and almost comically outmatched. It was his past, humble and slightly battered. The black car was his future, silent, impersonal, and waiting. His mother stood with him at the front door, her hands clutching her dressing gown tightly. She had refused to get properly dressed, as if admitting it was a normal day would make his departure too final.\n\nHe placed his bag in the boot, the driver assisting with a practiced, unobtrusive efficiency. The moment he could no longer delay had arrived. He turned back to his mother, who stood framed in the doorway of the house that had been his entire world. Her eyes were bright with unshed tears, but her smile was resolute. \"You be good, now,\" she said, her voice catching slightly. \"And you phone me. You phone me the minute you get there.\" He wrapped her in his arms, a fierce, desperate hug that was both a goodbye and an apology. He breathed in her scent one last time, trying to commit it to memory, a talisman against the sterile, air-conditioned world he was about to enter. \"I love you, Mam,\" he whispered into her hair. \"More than anything.\" He pulled away before she could see the truth in his eyes. He walked to the waiting car without looking back, opened the heavy door, and slid onto the cool leather of the back seat. As the car pulled away from the curb with a smooth, silent acceleration, he finally allowed himself a glance in the side mirror. He saw his house shrinking, his mother a small, solitary figure on the step, waving until he turned the corner and she was gone. The journey south had begun again, but this time, he knew exactly what it would cost him.### Chapter 6\n\nThe black saloon moved through the landscape with an imperious smoothness that absorbed all the imperfections of the road. Arthur sat perfectly still in the back, a passenger in his own life, watching the familiar towns and service stations of the M6 glide past the tinted window. This journey was different from the two that had preceded it. It was not fuelled by a panicked terror or a grim sense of penance. This was a journey of capitulation. He was no longer driving; he was being delivered, a parcel sent from his old life to his new one. The driver, a young man with a discreet earpiece and eyes that never left the road, had not spoken a word since their initial, polite greeting. The silence in the car was absolute, a manufactured, hermetic quiet that was a universe away from the companionable silence of his own home. He felt the vibration of his phone in his pocket and knew, with a weary certainty, what was required of him. He pulled it out and dialled his mother\u2019s number. \u201cI\u2019m on the motorway, Mam,\u201d he said, his voice even and calm. \u201cJust past Birmingham. The traffic\u2019s not too bad. Yes, I\u2019ll call you as soon as I get to the studio. I love you, too.\u201d He ended the call and placed the phone back in his pocket, the lie now practiced, easy, and all the more damning for it.\n\nTheir destination was not the same sprawling studio complex he had entered as a contestant. The car bypassed the main public entrance and swept down a ramp into a private underground garage, coming to a halt in a bay marked \u2018GUEST 1\u2019. The driver was out in an instant, opening the door for him, a gesture of deference that felt utterly alien. As Arthur stepped out, Chloe emerged from a doorway, her smile a beacon in the concrete gloom. She was flanked by a tall, severe-looking woman with a clipboard and a young man who seemed to vibrate with nervous energy. There was no contestant\u2019s lanyard for him this time, no waiting in line. He was an asset, and he was being moved through a different, more exclusive set of corridors, the polished floors reflecting his tired face back at him. \u201cArthur, brilliant time,\u201d Chloe said, falling into step beside him. \u201cThis is Janice, she\u2019s your publicist, and this is Leo, my new assistant. Leo\u2019s going to be your shadow for the next few weeks, alright? Anything you need, he\u2019s your man.\u201d Leo gave a quick, jerky nod, his eyes wide. Arthur murmured a greeting, feeling the unseen walls of his new life assembling around him, brick by invisible brick.\n\nHe was shown into a dressing room that was smaller than the one he\u2019d had on finals night, but infinitely more luxurious. There was a bowl of fruit he would not eat and a rack of designer clothes he would not choose. A woman with fiercely arched eyebrows and a belt of makeup brushes descended on him, tilting his face to the light and tutting softly. \u201cThe camera is not kind to tired eyes,\u201d she announced to the room at large, before beginning to dab and blend, erasing the evidence of his sleepless nights. As she worked, Janice, the publicist, stood by the door, speaking in a low, rapid voice. \u201cThe narrative is key, Arthur. Humble beginnings, devoted son, the dream people thought was impossible. We lean into the authenticity. You are the real thing in a plastic world. When they ask about the money, it\u2019s not for you, it\u2019s for your mum. A new kitchen, a garden, security. Got it?\u201d He just nodded, his face a passive canvas for the makeup artist, his mind a blank slate for the publicist to write upon. He was being built, assembled, his raw materials of grief and guilt being polished into a marketable story.\n\nThe set of the breakfast show was an assault of primary colours and aggressive cheerfulness. He was guided to a lurid orange sofa, the cushions so plump they seemed to sigh as he sat down. The host, a woman with a famous smile and teeth so white they seemed to generate their own light, leaned over and squeezed his knee. \u201cArthur! So thrilled to have you! You\u2019ve captured the nation\u2019s heart, you really have. Just relax, this is just a chat,\u201d she chirped, her eyes already looking past him to the camera operator who was signalling they had ten seconds. The theme music swelled and then faded, the studio lights grew hotter, and the famous smile was turned on him like a searchlight. \u201cAnd we are back with the man of the moment, the winner of this year\u2019s show, the incredible Arthur Penhaligon! Arthur\u2026 welcome. You must be on cloud nine!\u201d The question hung in the air, a simple, baited hook. He thought of the cold dread on the M6, of his mother\u2019s wounded voice, of the hollow ache that had taken up permanent residence in his chest. He smiled, a gentle, humble expression that the makeup artist had prepared and his own despair had perfected. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s all a bit of a dream,\u201d he said, his voice soft. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s quite sunk in. I\u2019m just a waiter from Lancaster. Things like this don\u2019t happen to people like me.\u201d The answer was perfect. Janice, standing just off-camera, gave a small, almost imperceptible nod of approval.\n\nThe interview was a masterclass in polite evasion. He spoke of the honour, the shock, the gratitude. When the host asked what he would do with the prize money, he delivered the lines Janice had given him, painting a picture of a comfortable, worry-free future for his mother. The lie was so pure, so noble in its intent, that it almost felt true. Then came the question he had been dreading. \u201cYour mother, Elsie, we all saw her in the audience during the semi-finals, she must be bursting with pride. I\u2019m sure she was your biggest supporter on the night of the final, too.\u201d Arthur felt a momentary, vertiginous drop, the studio floor seeming to fall away. He saw his mother on the sofa, her face a mask of disappointment. He saw her on the doorstep, waving him off, her pride resurrected by his victory. He had to hold on to the second image. It was the only way to survive the first. \u201cShe\u2019s everything to me,\u201d he said, his voice thick with an emotion that was entirely real, even if its context was a lie. \u201cShe\u2019s the reason I sing. To know I\u2019ve made her happy\u2026 that\u2019s the real prize.\u201d\n\nAs if on cue, the screen behind them flickered to life. \u201cLet\u2019s just remind ourselves of that incredible, winning performance,\u201d the host said brightly. The opening piano chords of \u2018Calon L\u00e2n\u2019 filled the studio, and he was forced to watch a replay of his own heartbreak. He saw the man on the screen, his face pale and strained, his eyes dark with a sorrow that the cameras had interpreted as artistic depth. He heard the voice, his voice, saturated with a pain so profound it had silenced a nation. He watched this stranger fall apart in the most public way imaginable, his confession of a lie transformed into an anthem of triumph. The audience in the studio applauded the clip, their faces full of admiration. The host turned back to him, her own eyes glistening. \u201cJust breathtaking. So much raw emotion. What were you thinking in that moment, Arthur? Where did that come from?\u201d He looked into the camera, into the millions of living rooms, into the kind, trusting faces of people like Mrs Gable and his colleagues at The Gilded Fork. He thought of his mother, watching him now, her heart swelling with pride. He gave them the only answer he could. \u201cI was thinking of home,\u201d he whispered.\n\nThe interview concluded, and as the show cut to a commercial break, the host\u2019s warm expression vanished, replaced by a professional briskness as she turned to her notes for the next segment. The bubble of performance had burst. Chloe was at his side instantly, her face alight with triumph. \u201cPerfect. Absolutely perfect. Heartfelt, humble, you hit every single beat. They loved you. The phones are already going mad.\u201d She did not ask if he was alright. She did not seem to notice the sweat on his brow or the slight tremble in his hand as he accepted the glass of water Leo offered him. She had seen a flawless execution of the brand strategy. The man who had executed it was incidental. He was guided off the set, the cheerful theme music rising behind him, and led back down the sterile corridors, his duty done. But the day was not over. The radio blitz was next. He understood now. His new job was not singing. It was this: a relentless series of performances on couches and in studios, retelling the story of his magical, beautiful, perfect victory until he, and everyone else, believed it was true.The radio blitz was a disorienting tour of London's airwaves, a series of anonymous buildings connected by the silent, leather-lined cocoon of the black saloon. Between each stop, Janice would provide a clipped summary of the next host\u2019s style\u2014\"Chris is a man-of-the-people, lots of football analogies,\" \"Fiona is more high-brow, expect a question about the Welsh choral tradition\"\u2014all of which was utterly useless information. The questions were always the same, variations on a single, triumphant theme. Arthur sat in sound-proofed rooms, a pair of heavy headphones clamped over his ears, and spoke into microphones that seemed to drink his words without leaving a trace. He talked about his shock, his gratitude, his love for his mother. His voice, the very thing that had brought him here, felt disconnected from him, a disembodied sound floating in the sterile air of the studio, a tool he was learning to operate with a chilling proficiency.\n\nAfter the third interview, in a studio overlooking the bustling chaos of Leicester Square, the host announced they would be opening the phone lines. \"The whole country wants to talk to you, Arthur,\" he said with a warm, avuncular smile. Arthur\u2019s heart gave a familiar, sickening lurch. This was an unscripted danger, an opportunity for a question he couldn\u2019t answer. The first few calls were a blur of breathless congratulations and declarations of having voted for him ten times. He responded with practiced humility, his answers becoming smoother and more hollow with each call. Then the host\u2019s tone changed. \"We have a lady on the line now from your home town. All the way from Lancaster, it\u2019s\u2026 Mary Gable. Hello, Mary, you\u2019re on the air with Arthur.\"\n\nThe name struck him like a physical blow. The studio, the host, the blinking lights\u2014it all dissolved. He was back in The Gilded Fork, the scent of b\u00e9arnaise sauce in the air, a kind, wrinkled face smiling up at him. The voice that came through his headphones was thin and reedy, laced with the static of a long-distance call, but it was unmistakably her. \"Arthur? Is that you, love?\" He couldn\u2019t speak. He just nodded dumbly at the microphone. \"It\u2019s Mrs Gable. From Table 4,\" she continued, as if he might have forgotten. \"Oh, we are all so proud of you, son. So very proud. You stood up so straight! And that song\u2026 oh, it was just beautiful. You made us all cry. Now, you haven't forgotten your promise, have you? That Vera Lynn song. You promised me.\" A genuine laugh, small and unexpected, escaped Arthur\u2019s lips. It was the first real sound he had made all day. \"No, Mrs Gable,\" he said, and his own voice sounded strange to him, thick with an emotion he wasn\u2019t performing. \"I haven't forgotten. It's the first one I'll learn.\"\n\nThe moment was radio gold. The host\u2019s eyes lit up, sensing the raw, unscripted truth of it. When the call ended, he leaned into his microphone, his voice hushed with reverence. \"That, ladies and gentlemen, is why this man won. A true gentleman. Don't go away, we'll be right back with Arthur Penhaligon after the break.\" During the advert, Leo, his young shadow, gave him a thumbs-up, his face glowing with admiration. \"That was amazing!\" he whispered. \"So real!\" Arthur just stared at the sound-proofing foam on the wall, the genuine warmth of Mrs Gable\u2019s call already receding, leaving him colder than before. She had reached through the artifice and touched him for a moment, but in doing so, she had only highlighted the crushing reality of his isolation. Her pride was for the man on the television, the man who made promises and sang beautiful songs. He was now that man, and he would have to keep those promises, no matter the cost.\n\nThe final appointment of the day was at the record label's headquarters, a shimmering tower of glass and steel that seemed to pierce the grey London sky. This was not a place of creative clutter or artistic chaos; it was a cathedral of commerce, silent and intimidating. He was led not to a studio but to a boardroom on the top floor. A single, vast slab of dark wood served as a table, surrounded by a dozen severe black leather chairs. Through the floor-to-ceiling windows, London was laid out below him, a sprawling, indifferent map of his new life. The man from the party, the head of the label, a Mr Davies, was there, along with two other executives whose smiles were as sharp and polished as their shoes. They did not gush like the television hosts. They observed him with a calm, unnerving intensity, the way a jeweller might examine a newly acquired, un-cut diamond.\n\nThey talked about marketing demographics and album release windows, their conversation a swift, coded volley that Arthur struggled to follow. They used his name, but they seemed to be talking about a concept, a brand called \u2018Arthur Penhaligon\u2019. He was a story, a feeling, an emotional arc that could be translated into units sold. Finally, Mr Davies leaned forward, steepling his fingers on the gleaming table. \"Arthur,\" he said, his voice quiet but carrying an immense, unshakeable authority. \"Your performance in the final was a moment. A rare moment of genuine, powerful emotion. It connected. It\u2019s what people are buying into. It\u2019s what we are buying into.\" He paused, his eyes holding Arthur's. \"That is what this first album needs to be. We need to capture that. That\u2026 beautiful sadness. That heartbreak. We want an album of Calon L\u00e2ns.\" The words hung in the sterile air of the boardroom. They were not asking him to sing. They were asking him to bleed. They were commissioning a collection of his most profound pain, packaged into three-minute tracks and sold for mass consumption.\n\nArthur looked out of the window, down at the tiny, scurrying cars and the endless grey rooftops. He had thought his penance was to perform happiness, to pretend he was the humble, joyous winner everyone wanted him to be. He had been wrong. His real penance was to commodify his grief. To relive the lie, the fear, and the heartbreak, over and over again, in a recording booth, until they had enough material for a platinum-selling album. To stand on stages for the rest of his foreseeable future and sing, not of the joy he didn\u2019t feel, but of the authentic, soul-crushing sorrow that had won him the prize. It was a far more terrible, more fitting punishment than he could ever have imagined. He turned his gaze from the window and met the expectant eyes of Mr Davies. He gave a small, almost imperceptible nod. \"Alright,\" he said, his voice barely a whisper. The executives smiled. A deal had been struck.### Chapter 7\n\nThe days that followed blurred into a new, monotonous routine, a life lived between the silent luxury of the black saloon and the sound-proofed confines of a recording studio in a fashionable, cobbled mews. This was where the alchemy was to happen, where his pain was to be spun into gold. The studio, named \u2018The Alibi Room\u2019, was a stark contrast to the corporate gloss of the label\u2019s headquarters. It was a space of curated cool: vintage Persian rugs on dark wood floors, exposed brickwork, and an array of guitars hanging on the walls like retired hunting trophies. It was designed to feel authentic, a creative haven, but to Arthur, it felt like the most sophisticated and terrifying prison yet. The walls were lined with velvet to absorb the sound, and he felt they absorbed his very soul, leaving him dry and husks-like at the end of each day.\n\nLeo, his shadow, was a constant, well-meaning presence, fetching him coffee he never drank and water he barely sipped. His youthful reverence for the process was a source of constant, low-grade irritation for Arthur. Leo saw magic in the endless tweaking of a microphone position, in the complex constellation of tiny lights on the mixing desk. Arthur only saw the cold, technical mechanics of his own vivisection. The producer assigned to him was a man named Julian, a quiet, intense man in his late forties with kind eyes and a reputation for coaxing \u2018truthful\u2019 performances from his artists. He wore soft, unstructured cardigans and spoke in a gentle, almost therapeutic tone. Arthur knew, with a dreadful certainty, that Julian was the most dangerous man he had yet met. He was the chief inquisitor, the man whose job it was to find the wound and press on it until it bled.\n\nTheir first session began not with a grand Puccini aria, but with a song that had been written for him by a team of hugely successful Swedish songwriters. It was a beautiful, melancholic ballad called \u2018The Ghost of a Footprint\u2019, full of poetic, slightly vague lyrics about loss and memory. It was engineered to be moving, a blank canvas onto which an audience could project their own sadness. Julian played it for him on an old acoustic guitar, his voice a pleasant, unassuming murmur. \u201cThe melody feels like it\u2019s in your range, the sentiment is there,\u201d Julian said softly. \u201cLet\u2019s just see how it feels. No pressure. Just find your way into it.\u201d Arthur was led into the vocal booth, a small, dimly lit box that felt unnervingly like a confessional. The heavy door closed with a soft, definitive click, sealing him in. He put on the headphones, and Julian\u2019s disembodied voice filled his head, calm and encouraging. \u201cWhenever you\u2019re ready, Arthur.\u201d\n\nHe sang. The notes were perfect, the pitch immaculate, the phrasing faultless. He was a good waiter, a man who had spent a decade fulfilling requests with precision and discretion, and this was just another order to be fulfilled. He delivered the song as requested, a clean, technically proficient vocal take. When the final note faded, there was a moment of silence. Then Julian\u2019s voice came through the headphones, still gentle, but with a new, searching quality. \u201cThat was lovely, Arthur. Technically, it\u2019s flawless. But I\u2019m not feeling you in there. I\u2019m hearing the song, but I\u2019m not hearing your story. What we need is that thing you gave us on Saturday night. That honesty.\u201d Arthur closed his eyes. Honesty. They kept using that word. They had no idea what it meant.\n\nThey tried again. And again. Each take was a perfect, lifeless replica of the last. He could hear the faint, creeping frustration in Julian\u2019s patient instructions. Outside the glass of the vocal booth, he could see Leo looking anxious, his faith in the magic beginning to waver. Julian called for a break. He came into the booth, leaving the door open, breaking the seal. He sat on a stool opposite Arthur. \u201cLet\u2019s forget the song for a minute,\u201d he said, his kind eyes searching Arthur\u2019s face. \u201cTalk to me about Lancaster. What does it feel like when you\u2019re walking home from work, by the canal? What does the air smell like?\u201d The questions were so simple, so unexpected. Arthur found himself talking, his voice low, describing the damp, earthy smell, the sound of his own footsteps on the wet pavement, the particular bruised-plum colour of the sky at dusk. He spoke of the quiet, and Julian just nodded, listening. \u201cAnd your mum,\u201d Julian said, his voice dropping even lower. \u201cWhen you sing, you\u2019re singing for her, aren\u2019t you? That\u2019s what you said in the interview this morning.\u201d\n\nThe trap was sprung. It was so elegant, so gentle, he hadn\u2019t even seen the jaws. Julian had taken the public narrative, the lie he had so carefully constructed, and was now using it as a key to unlock the private truth. Arthur\u2019s throat tightened. He thought of his mother\u2019s face, not as a source of inspiration, but as the reason for his suffocating guilt. He thought of the premonition, the screech of tires, the bargain he had made with a universe that had not been listening. A cold, familiar dread washed over him. \u201cLet\u2019s try one more time,\u201d Julian said, as if sensing the shift in the emotional weather. He retreated back to the control room, and the heavy door clicked shut again, sealing Arthur back inside his own head.\n\nHe put on the headphones. The simple piano backing track began. He opened his mouth, but this time, he wasn\u2019t thinking about the Swedish lyrics or the perfect pitch. He was standing on the hard shoulder of the M6. He was hearing the hurt in his mother\u2019s voice. He was seeing the garish trophy on his mantelpiece. He was feeling the profound, crushing weight of his magnificent, terrible lie. He sang. The voice that came out of him was a raw, wounded thing. It cracked on the high notes and frayed at the edges with a sorrow so pure it was almost ugly. He wasn\u2019t performing \u2018The Ghost of a Footprint\u2019; he was confessing to it. The footprint was his own, the ghost was the man he had left behind. When he finished, he was shaking, leaning against the velvet-lined wall for support, his breath coming in ragged gasps. The silence from the control room was absolute, stretching for an eternity. Then Julian\u2019s voice, when it came, was a choked whisper. \u201cMy God, Arthur. Don\u2019t move. We\u2019re recording. Just\u2026 do that again. Exactly that.\u201d### Chapter 7\n\nThe words echoed in the small, padded box, stripped of their initial, choked emotion and replayed in Arthur\u2019s head as a cold, clinical instruction. *Do that again. Exactly that.* It wasn\u2019t a plea for an encore; it was an order to reopen a vein. The fragile barrier between the man and the artist, between the agony and the performance, had been vaporised. In that moment, Arthur understood the true nature of his contract. He had not been signed for his voice, but for his wound, and his job, for the foreseeable future, was to keep it fresh, to prevent it from ever healing over. Julian, with his kind eyes and gentle manner, was not a producer; he was a surgeon of the soul, and his task was to extract a specific, marketable strain of pain. The realisation was so profound, so horrifying, it left no room for anger. All he felt was a vast, arctic emptiness.\n\nHe looked through the thick studio glass at the two figures in the control room. Julian was leaning forward, his face a mask of intense concentration, his hand hovering over a fader on the enormous mixing desk. Leo, his young shadow, was staring at Arthur with an expression of pure, unadulterated awe, as if he were witnessing a miracle rather than a meticulously engineered emotional breakdown. To Leo, this was art. This was the magic he had come to London to be a part of. Arthur felt a surge of something akin to pity for the boy\u2019s innocence. He was a tourist watching a ritual sacrifice, admiring the beautiful patterns the blood made on the stones. He took a breath, the air in the booth feeling thick and used up. He had to do it again. He had no other choice. This was the job. This was the price.\n\nHe closed his eyes and summoned the images, the terrible slideshow he now knew by heart. The white van cutting in front of the blue saloon. The high-pitched, desperate squeal of rubber on tarmac. His mother\u2019s voice on the phone, the cheerfulness draining from it, leaving only a thin, brittle shell of hurt. The peacock-blue hat, sitting in its box by the door. He marshalled his ghosts, lined them up, and made them perform. When he opened his mouth, the sound that emerged was a near-perfect replica of his earlier agony. The melody was a vessel, and he filled it with guilt, with fear, with the bottomless sorrow of his monumental, loving lie. He sang the song three more times, each pass leaving him progressively more hollowed out, more spectral. He was a well, and they were lowering a bucket into him, time and time again, and he was amazed to find that there was always more water, dark and bitter, to be drawn up.\n\nWhen Julian\u2019s voice finally came through the headphones, it was soft with a satisfaction that was almost reverent. \u201cThat\u2019s it, Arthur. We\u2019ve got it. We have it. That was\u2026 extraordinary. Let\u2019s call it a day.\u201d The heavy door of the vocal booth opened, and the ordinary air of the studio rushed in, smelling of coffee and old rugs. It felt like emerging from a deep-sea dive, the pressure change making him dizzy. Leo rushed forward with a bottle of water, his eyes shining. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like that,\u201d he breathed. \u201cIt was like you were channelling something.\u201d Arthur took the water, his hand shaking too much to open it. He just nodded, the gesture requiring a colossal effort. Julian clapped him gently on the shoulder. \u201cYou did good work today, Arthur. Really good work. Go home. Get some rest. We\u2019ll do it all again tomorrow.\u201d\n\nThe ride back to the serviced apartment the label had rented for him was a silent, grey smear. He sat in the back of the familiar black saloon, staring out at the rain-slicked London streets, seeing nothing. He felt scoured, sandblasted, a building stripped back to its bare, weeping brickwork. His apartment was on the seventh floor of a new, anonymous glass block in a part of the city that had no discernible character. It was furnished with clean lines, hard surfaces, and a complete absence of personality. There were no worn armchairs, no ceramic birds, no framed photographs of a day trip to Morecambe. It was a holding cell with a better view. He walked in, dropped his keys on the stark white kitchen counter, and stood for a long time in the centre of the room, listening to the hum of the air conditioning. He had spent his entire day excavating his deepest feelings, and now he was in a place where it was impossible to feel anything at all.\n\nHe knew he had to call his mother. It was part of the routine, the most crucial performance of his day. He sat on the edge of the stiff, modern sofa and dialled, composing his face into a mask of weary contentment for an audience of one, a thousand miles away. She answered, as always, on the second ring. \u201cArthur! How was it, love? Your first proper day! Did they like you?\u201d Her voice was a lifeline to a world he no longer inhabited, a world of simple successes and honest work. It was a world where a good day meant you had done a good job. He looked around the sterile white room, at the view of a thousand other windows, and summoned the energy for his final lie of the day. \u201cIt was good, Mam. Really good. The producer, Julian, he\u2019s very nice. We worked on a new song. I think\u2026 I think they were pleased.\u201d\n\n\u201cPleased? Of course they were pleased!\u201d she chirped, her pride a warm, uncomplicated thing. \u201cHow could they not be? As long as you\u2019re happy, love. That\u2019s the main thing. That you\u2019re enjoying it.\u201d Enjoying it. The word was so absurd, so grotesquely inappropriate, that he had to stifle a laugh that sounded more like a sob. He had spent the day mentally torturing himself for money, and she was picturing him humming happily in a room full of new friends. The chasm between her reality and his was now the defining feature of his existence. He was a man living in two separate, incompatible worlds, and the strain of holding them apart was tearing him in two. \u201cI\u2019m happy, Mam,\u201d he said, the words tasting like rust in his mouth. \u201cI\u2019m very happy.\u201d He ended the call, promising to phone again the next day, and let the phone drop onto the sofa beside him. He sat in the gathering dusk, the lights of London beginning to glitter outside his window like a vast, beautiful, indifferent star field. He had another session tomorrow. He had to do it all again. And again. And again. The beautiful sadness was his product, and he was beginning to understand that the supply was inexhaustible.### Chapter 8\n\nThe process became a grim science. Weeks bled into one another, marked not by days but by vocal takes. Arthur learned how to access the dark well inside himself with an unnerving efficiency. He no longer had to consciously summon the ghosts of the motorway or the memory of his mother\u2019s wounded voice; they were his constant companions now, waiting patiently in the wings of his mind for their cue. Julian would give a quiet nod from the control room, Arthur would close his eyes, and the performance would begin. He had become a virtuoso of his own misery. His voice, once a source of simple, private joy, was now a precision instrument for the excavation of pain, and he played it with a skill that terrified him. He was thinner, the skin stretched taut over his cheekbones, and his eyes had a permanent, haunted quality that the makeup artists on his occasional media appearances no longer had to fake. He was the perfect embodiment of the beautiful sadness they were selling.\n\nOne Tuesday afternoon, after a particularly raw take of a song about a love that was doomed from the start, Julian\u2019s voice came through the headphones, warm with accomplishment. \u201cI think that\u2019s the one, Arthur. The emotion is just\u2026 there. You know, I think we have something now. A body of work. I want to play you something. I want you to hear what we\u2019re building.\u201d A profound dread, cold and heavy, settled in Arthur\u2019s stomach. He had avoided this. He had sung into the void, day after day, and had actively refused to listen to the playback, treating each performance as a discrete act of self-immolation that was over the moment it was finished. To listen back felt like being forced to attend his own autopsy. But Julian was already ushering him out of the vocal booth and towards the large, worn leather sofa that faced the mixing desk and its fortress of speakers. Leo, sensing a momentous occasion, perched on the arm of the sofa, his face a mask of nervous excitement.\n\nJulian dimmed the main studio lights, creating a theatrical, intimate atmosphere. He moved a few faders on the desk, his movements economical and precise. \u201cI\u2019ve done a rough mix of the first three tracks,\u201d he said, his voice a low murmur in the semi-darkness. \u201cJust to give you a sense of the shape of it. Listen.\u201d He pressed a button, and the studio was filled with sound. It was immense. It was a soundscape of epic melancholy, a cathedral built from his own quiet despair. His voice, the raw, cracking thing he had been producing in the booth, was at the centre of it, but it was no longer naked. It was supported by swelling cellos, ghosted by ethereal backing vocals, and underscored by a piano that fell like soft, relentless rain. The production was flawless, beautiful, and utterly devastating. It was the most heartbreaking sound he had ever heard.\n\nHe listened, frozen on the sofa, as his own private agony was played back to him, polished and packaged for public consumption. He heard the catch in his throat as he sang a line about saying goodbye, a sound born from the memory of his mother\u2019s hurt silence, now transformed into a sublime musical moment, artfully drenched in reverb. He heard the ragged edge of his voice on a sustained high note, a sound torn from him by the visceral memory of screeching tires, now framed by a shimmering cymbal crash that made it heroic. It was a violation of the most intimate kind. They had taken his truth, the ugly, secret, shameful truth of his lie, and had made it beautiful. They had made it art. He felt a dizzying wave of depersonalization, as if the man singing from the speakers was a stranger who had stolen his memories and his voice, and was now parading them with a skill and artistry Arthur himself could never possess. The singer on the record was a genius of sorrow. Arthur was just the raw, weeping material he had been quarried from.\n\nWhen the last notes faded into a shimmering silence, Julian slowly turned up the lights. His face was glowing, suffused with the quiet, profound satisfaction of a master craftsman who had just completed his masterwork. Leo was speechless, his eyes wide and wet with tears. \u201cArthur\u2026 it\u2019s a masterpiece,\u201d Julian said, his voice barely above a whisper. \u201cIt\u2019s more than an album. It\u2019s a confession. It\u2019s the truth.\u201d The word, \u2018truth\u2019, landed with the force of a physical blow. Arthur felt a sudden, violent need for air, for an escape from this room where his soul had been so expertly sampled, looped, and arranged. He stood up abruptly, the movement jerky and uncoordinated. \u201cI need a walk,\u201d he mumbled, his voice a dry rasp, and he turned and walked towards the door, his one thought to get away from the sound of his own beautifully rendered lie.\n\nHe was halfway down the cobbled mews before he realised Leo was scurrying behind him, his faithful shadow in this new, bewildering world. \u201cGreat idea! Some air!\u201d Leo panted, catching up to him. \u201cThat was just\u2026 intense. I don\u2019t know how you do it. Where are we going?\u201d Arthur stopped and turned, the sudden, bright daylight making him flinch. The noise of the city, the ordinary sounds of traffic and people, felt like a vulgar intrusion after the curated perfection of the studio. \u201cI\u2019m going for a walk, Leo,\u201d he said, and the words came out colder and sharper than he had intended. \u201cAlone.\u201d Leo\u2019s eager, open face crumpled. He looked like a puppy that had been unexpectedly kicked. \u201cOh,\u201d he said, his voice small. \u201cRight. Of course. Sorry. Do you\u2026 want me to get you anything? A coffee?\u201d\n\nLooking at Leo\u2019s earnest, worried face, the brief flash of irritation Arthur had felt was instantly extinguished, replaced by a wave of profound, bone-deep weariness. This boy was not his jailer. He was just another prisoner, trapped by his own innocent dreams of the music industry. \u201cNo, Leo,\u201d Arthur said, his voice softening. \u201cThank you. I\u2019m fine.\u201d He turned and walked away, leaving Leo standing alone on the cobbles, a small, confused figure outside the temple of sound. Arthur walked without direction, his hands stuffed in his pockets, his shoulders hunched against a chill that had nothing to do with the weather. He moved through the streets of fashionable London, past artisanal bakeries selling sourdough bread for the price of a full meal at The Gilded Fork, past expensive boutiques displaying single, exquisite dresses in their windows. He was a ghost haunting a life he was supposed to be living, the sound of his own polished agony still ringing in his ears, a perfect, inescapable soundtrack.\n\nHe found a small, forgotten churchyard, a patch of green and tilting grey headstones hemmed in by towering office blocks. He sat on a cold stone bench, under the shade of an ancient, gnarled yew tree, and finally allowed himself to breathe. He took out his phone. He had one more performance to give. He dialled his mother\u2019s number, the familiar sequence of digits a small, painful ritual. She answered, her voice bubbling with news from Lancaster. The local paper wanted to do a follow-up interview with her. The butcher had put a \u2018We\u2019re proud of you, Arthur!\u2019 sign in his window. Mrs Gable had stopped her in the street to ask if he had started learning \u2018The White Cliffs of Dover\u2019 yet. Her world was a universe constructed entirely from the bright, shining echo of his success, and he was its absent, benevolent god. He listened, making the right noises, the right murmurs of encouragement. \u201cThat\u2019s wonderful, Mam,\u201d he said, when she finally paused for breath. His voice was a dead, flat monotone, all its colour and life having been left on the studio floor. There was a pause. A different kind of pause. \u201cArthur? Are you alright, love?\u201d she asked, a sliver of concern cutting through her excitement. \u201cYou sound a bit flat.\u201d The first crack. The first tremor in the edifice. He scrambled to repair the damage, forcing a warmth he did not feel into his voice. \u201cJust tired, Mam. It was a long day. A good day, though. A really good day. We listened to some of the songs. They sound\u2026 amazing.\u201d The lie saved him, for now. But as he ended the call, sitting alone amongst the dead in the heart of the city, he knew, with a chilling certainty, that the performance was becoming unsustainable. He was running out of lies.The fear that lingered after the call was a new and more insidious vintage. The public finding out he was a fraud was a distant, abstract terror. His mother discovering he was unhappy\u2014that was immediate, personal, and utterly catastrophic. The entire, elaborate deception, the whole punishing charade, was for the sole purpose of preserving her joy. If his own misery leaked through the cracks in his voice and poisoned that joy, then the entire sacrifice was for nothing. He would have lost himself and failed her, a double-negative that cancelled out his entire existence. He sat on the cold stone bench, the tilting headstones his silent companions, and felt the architecture of his lie begin to groan under a strain it was never designed to bear.\n\nHe walked back to the apartment as the city\u2019s evening pulse quickened. The pubs were spilling light and laughter onto the pavements, and the restaurants were filling with couples and groups of friends, their animated conversations visible through the large glass windows. Arthur moved through it all like a man walking underwater, the vibrant life of the city a distorted, distant spectacle. He saw a young man buy a bouquet of flowers from a street vendor, a woman laugh so hard she had to lean against a wall for support, a father lifting his small child onto his shoulders to see over the crowds. These were small, unremarkable moments of human connection, of ordinary happiness, and they felt as remote and unattainable to him as the stars. Each scene was a fresh page in a book about a language he had forgotten how to speak.\n\nThe apartment was cold and silent, smelling faintly of the lemon-scented cleaning products the weekly service used. It was a space scrubbed clean of life. He didn't turn on the lights, preferring to stand in the gloom, watching the city glitter through the vast, floor-to-ceiling window. He was a specimen in a glass case, a perfect example of modern success, with a view of everything and a connection to nothing. His phone buzzed in his pocket. He pulled it out, expecting it to be Leo with a schedule update, but the name on the screen was his sister\u2019s. The message was short, simple, and devastating. \u2018Mam just called. She\u2019s worried about you. Said you sounded low. Are you eating properly, Art? We\u2019re all so proud of you, don\u2019t let them run you into the ground.\u2019 He stared at the words until they blurred, the screen\u2019s harsh blue light illuminating the profound failure of his performance. The one person he was doing all this for, the person whose happiness was his only remaining moral compass, was beginning to see the truth.\n\nA strange, unfamiliar anger began to bubble up through the layers of his exhaustion and despair. It wasn't directed at his sister, or his mother, or even at Julian and the machinery of the label. It was an impotent rage at the sheer, crushing impossibility of his situation. He walked into the stark white kitchen, a space more like a laboratory than a place for preparing food, and opened the pristine, empty refrigerator. The label provided a weekly grocery delivery service, a curated selection of organic vegetables, lean proteins, and artisanal cheeses, most of which he left to rot. He ignored it all. He rummaged in the back of a cupboard and found what he was looking for: a forgotten tin of baked beans and a plastic-wrapped loaf of cheap white bread. It was survival food from his old life. In a silent, desperate act of rebellion, he made himself beans on toast. He didn't use one of the expensive, minimalist plates, but ate standing over the sink, scooping the beans onto the toast with a fork, the familiar, slightly metallic taste an echo of a thousand tired evenings after a long shift at The Gilded Fork.\n\nAs he ate the simple, unglamorous meal, a decision began to crystallize in his mind, forming with the cold, hard clarity of an ice crystal. This slow, public disintegration was unsustainable. The daily act of mining his own sorrow was not just destroying him; it was beginning to poison the very person he was trying to protect. The risk of his mother discovering the full extent of his misery was now a greater, more immediate threat than the risk of disappointing her with his failure. He had to change the terms of his penance. He could not run from the lie, but he could no longer live it in this gilded cage, two hundred miles away. He had to go home. Not for a fleeting, stage-managed visit, but to be there, on the ground, to manage the lie in person, to shore up the cracks before the whole dam burst. It was a desperate, illogical plan, a flight not away from his problem, but directly into its heart. He rinsed the plate, left it in the sink, and walked to his laptop. He didn't call Chloe to ask for permission. He didn't text Leo to cancel his schedule. He opened a web browser, his fingers moving with a new, determined purpose, and booked a one-way ticket on the first train to Lancaster in the morning.### Chapter 9\n\nHe woke before the alarm, a jolt of adrenaline cutting through the shallow depths of his sleep. For a moment, he lay perfectly still in the pre-dawn gloom, listening. The apartment was silent, its air-conditioned hum the only sign of life. The decision he had made in the desperate clarity of the previous evening felt reckless and insane in the cold light of morning. But the alternative\u2014another day in the velvet coffin of the vocal booth, another phone call where he would have to counterfeit happiness for his mother\u2014was simply unthinkable. The fear of staying had finally become greater than the fear of running. He moved with the quiet, urgent purpose of a fugitive. He packed a single bag, not with the crisp, new clothes the label\u2019s stylists had provided, but with his own worn jeans and jumpers, the few remaining artefacts of his former self. He left the key card on the white countertop, a small, plastic tombstone marking the grave of his London life. He did not look back.\n\nHe took the Tube to Euston Station, descending into the warm, metallic-smelling breath of the city\u2019s underbelly. The early morning crowds were a river of preoccupied faces, and for the first time in weeks, Arthur felt a profound sense of relief. Here, in the anonymous crush of the commute, he was no one. He was just another man in a dark coat with his head down, another ghost in the machine. The invisibility he had once taken for granted now felt like a superpower, a cloak he could pull around his shoulders for a few precious, stolen hours. He bought his ticket from a machine, paid with his own debit card, and found his platform, the vast, arched roof of the station feeling like the nave of a great, hurried cathedral. He felt a thrill of pure, unadulterated agency. He was not being driven; he was moving under his own power, making a choice, however desperate and ill-advised it might be.\n\nThe train slid out of the station with a gentle, sighing hiss, and as it gathered speed, leaving the dense urban sprawl for the green, untidy patchwork of the home counties, Arthur felt a subtle loosening in his chest. The rhythmic, monotonous clatter of the wheels on the track was a soothing, forward-moving sound, a drumbeat of escape. He watched the country scroll past his window, a landscape waking under a watercolour sky. He saw fields of sheep, their fleece grey in the early light, and small villages clustered around stone church spires. It was a world of quiet, ordinary life, a world that continued to exist entirely without him. The journey north felt like a reversal of time, a rewinding of the past few, frantic months. With every mile that passed, he felt as if he were shedding a layer of the artifice that had been so carefully applied, stripping himself back to the man who had first made the journey down, a man full of a simpler, more honest kind of terror.\n\nHis phone began to vibrate halfway to Crewe. The screen glowed with Chloe\u2019s name. His brief, anonymous freedom was over. He stared at the vibrating device, the insistent buzzing a summons back to the life he was fleeing. He could ignore it, but that would only delay the inevitable, a cowardly act. He had made his move; now he had to own it. He took a deep breath, the air in the carriage smelling of stale coffee and disinfectant, and answered. \u201cArthur,\u201d Chloe\u2019s voice was sharp, a staccato burst of confusion and annoyance. \u201cWhere are you? Your car\u2019s been waiting for an hour. Julian\u2019s at the studio. Leo is having a panic attack.\u201d He leaned his head against the cool glass of the window, watching a pylon march across a distant hill. \u201cI\u2019m on a train, Chloe,\u201d he said, his voice quiet but firm. \u201cI\u2019m going home. To Lancaster.\u201d\n\nThere was a moment of stunned silence on the other end, a brief, silent reboot of her entire strategic framework. \u201cYou\u2019re\u2026 what? Arthur, you can\u2019t just leave. We have a schedule. We have a delivery date for this album. What is going on?\u201d Her voice was rising, the slick corporate veneer cracking to reveal the raw frustration beneath. This was the moment. He had to re-negotiate the terms of his surrender. \u201cI can\u2019t do it anymore, Chloe,\u201d he said, the simple truth of the words giving them an unshakeable weight. \u201cNot like this. Not from down there. You want the album? You want that\u2026 beautiful sadness? It comes from Lancaster. It comes from my life, from my mother. Being two hundred miles away, locked in a studio, it\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s killing the source. I can\u2019t give you what you want if I\u2019m not there.\u201d He was using their own language against them, reframing his desperate need for escape as a necessary condition for the creative process. It was a lie, of course, but it was a better, more useful lie than any he had told so far.\n\nHe could almost hear the gears turning in her head, the rapid cost-benefit analysis. An AWOL, unhappy star was a public relations disaster and a creative dead end. A star reconnecting with his \u2018authentic roots\u2019 to fuel his art? That was a story. That was marketable. \u201cAlright, Arthur,\u201d she said, her voice dropping, the anger replaced by a tone of carefully managed concession. \u201cAlright. I hear you. This is\u2026 unconventional. But if you think this is what\u2019s best for the album, then we\u2019ll make it work. For now. You can work from home. We\u2019ll arrange a local studio for you, or fly you down for key sessions. But you have to stay in communication. You have to work. This isn\u2019t a holiday.\u201d He had won. He had won a small, crucial battle in a war he knew he was still losing. \u201cI\u2019ll work,\u201d he promised. \u201cThank you, Chloe.\u201d He ended the call and looked out of the window. The landscape had changed. The hills were sterner now, the stone darker. He was entering his own country.\n\nThe train pulled into Lancaster station under a sky the colour of lead. As he stepped onto the platform, the familiar air, damp and cool and smelling of old stone, filled his lungs. It felt like his first real breath in months. The relief was intoxicating, but it was fleeting, replaced almost instantly by the anxiety of the task ahead. He walked out of the station and into the city. He was home, but he was no longer just a citizen; he was a landmark. He saw a poster for his winning single in the window of a music shop, his own mournful face staring back at him. He pulled the collar of his coat up and walked with his head down, but he could feel the occasional flicker of recognition, the subtle double-takes from passers-by. He walked past the grand facade of The Gilded Fork, its windows dark and empty at this time of day. It looked like a building from a dream he\u2019d once had. He was an alien visiting the ruins of his own life.\n\nHe turned onto his street. The bunting was gone, taken down by the weather or a return to civic normality, but the memory of it lingered. The street looked quiet, ordinary, just as it always had. But he knew it was different. He was different. He walked towards his front door, his footsteps echoing in the quiet, each one a hammer blow against his own heart. He knew his mother would be in. She was a woman of routine and ritual. He imagined her in the kitchen, wiping down the counters, the radio playing softly, a cup of tea by her elbow. He didn't have a key; he had given his to his sister months ago, a practical admission that his life was no longer here. He reached the peeling brown door, the sight of its familiar imperfections making his throat ache. He raised his hand, the knuckles white with tension, and knocked. He heard the radio cut off abruptly, the sound of footsteps, and then the rattle of the latch. He held his breath, bracing himself for the look on his mother\u2019s face when she saw the ghost that had appeared on her doorstep.The door swung open, and for a heart-stopping second, Elsie Penhaligon\u2019s face was a blank slate of incomprehension. She stared at the man on her doorstep as if he were a trick of the light, a figment of her worried imagination made flesh. Then, recognition flooded in, immediately followed not by joy, but by a wave of raw, maternal alarm. The man on the television, the confident, smiling victor, was gone. In his place stood her son, but a thinner, paler version, his eyes sunk into shadowed hollows, his shoulders slumped with a weariness that seemed ancient.\n\n\u201cArthur!\u201d The name was a gasp, a breath of pure shock. \u201cWhat on earth? What\u2019s happened? Are you alright?\u201d She reached out, her hand fluttering to his arm as if to check he was solid. Her touch was the anchor he had been searching for. He could see the questions, the fears, the scenarios she had been playing out in her head, all coalescing in her wide, frightened eyes. Before he could answer, her maternal instinct took over, overriding all other impulses. She grabbed his arm with a surprising strength and pulled him inside, shutting the door firmly behind him, closing out the quiet street and the prying eyes of the world. The familiar click of the latch was the sound of a cage door swinging shut, but for the first time, it felt like a sanctuary.\n\n\u201cLet me look at you,\u201d she commanded, her hands now on his shoulders, her gaze scanning him from head to toe. \u201cYou\u2019re skin and bone. And you\u2019re as white as a sheet. Have you been ill? Why didn\u2019t you call?\u201d He had prepared for this, rehearsing his lines on the train, a new performance for a new, more intimate stage. He summoned a smile that he hoped looked tired but not broken. \u201cI\u2019m fine, Mam. Honestly. Just run down. They\u2019ve\u2026 they\u2019ve given me a break.\u201d He delivered the lie he had crafted, the one that used the truth as its scaffolding. \u201cThe producer, Julian, he thinks I should spend some time at home. To write. He said I should get back to my roots. It\u2019s for the album.\u201d\n\nElsie stared at him, her brow furrowed, trying to process this new information, to fit it into the narrative of success she had so carefully constructed. The idea of him being sent home sounded less like a creative retreat and more like a punishment, a quiet expulsion. But the mention of the album, the sacred project, seemed to soothe her immediate panic. \u201cFor the album,\u201d she repeated, the words a charm against her fears. \u201cWell. I suppose that makes sense. You can\u2019t write about Lancaster from a London shoebox, can you?\u201d She released him, her practical nature reasserting itself. \u201cWell, you\u2019re here now. That\u2019s the main thing. Kettle\u2019s on. You sit yourself down in your chair before you fall down. You look ready to drop.\u201d\n\nHe obeyed, sinking into the familiar, welcoming contours of his armchair, the springs groaning a soft, welcoming complaint. The house was exactly as he had left it, a museum of his former life. On the mantelpiece, the golden trophy stood sentinel, catching the grey morning light, an obscene object of worship in this humble domestic chapel. He averted his eyes, unable to look at it. Elsie bustled in with a tray, two mugs of steaming tea and a plate of digestive biscuits arranged with a simple, loving precision. She placed it on the coffee table and sat on the edge of the sofa opposite him, her hands wrapped around her mug, her eyes never leaving his face. The interrogation by tea had begun. \u201cSo they\u2019re just letting you work from here? For how long?\u201d she asked, her tone casual, but her gaze sharp, forensic.\n\n\u201cFor as long as it takes, I suppose,\u201d he said, picking up his mug, the warmth seeping into his cold hands. \u201cIt\u2019s better this way. Quieter. I can think here.\u201d He was building the lie, adding details, making it solid. \u201cThe pressure down there\u2026 it\u2019s a lot, Mam. Constant. This is better for the work.\u201d He saw a flicker of understanding in her eyes. This she could accept. The trope of the overworked, sensitive artist was a familiar one. It was a story that made sense, a story that allowed her to worry about him without having to question his success. \u201cI told you they were working you too hard,\u201d she said, a note of grim satisfaction in her voice. \u201cYou\u2019re not a machine, Arthur. You need your rest. You need proper food.\u201d She looked at his thin face again, and her own softened with a deep, aching love. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll take care of that. You\u2019re home now. I\u2019ll fatten you up. You just concentrate on your beautiful songs.\u201d Her gaze drifted to the mantelpiece, to the gleaming, ostentatious prize. \u201cIt\u2019s all been worth it though, hasn\u2019t it, love? All this.\u201d She gestured towards the trophy, her eyes shining with a fierce, uncomplicated pride. Arthur followed her gaze and finally forced himself to look at it. The golden statue seemed to mock him, a permanent, glittering monument to the lie that sat between them, a lie he had just travelled two hundred miles to reinforce. \u201cYes, Mam,\u201d he said, the words feeling like shards of glass in his throat. \u201cIt\u2019s all been worth it.\u201dThe silence that followed his forced agreement was thick with all the things he could not say. Elsie, however, took his words as the end of a difficult conversation, a line drawn under a period of worry. She became a whirlwind of restorative domesticity, her anxiety channelled into a fierce, loving campaign to make things right. She insisted he take a hot bath while she put fresh sheets on his bed. She made him a cheese and onion sandwich, cutting it into neat triangles just as she had when he was a boy, her movements brisk and full of a purpose he could only envy. He ate it, the familiar taste of sharp cheddar and white bread a small, solid piece of reality in a world that had become abstract and terrifying. He retreated to his old bedroom, a small, square room overlooking the back gardens of the neighbouring houses. Nothing had changed. The narrow single bed was still covered with a worn candlewick bedspread. A shelf above his desk held a row of dusty paperbacks and a small, tarnished silver cup he had won for a choir solo when he was fourteen. It was the bedroom of the boy he had been, a quiet, hopeful boy who dreamed of singing. It was a shrine to a person who no longer existed, and standing in it felt like trespassing in his own past.\n\nHe spent the afternoon engaged in the elaborate pantomime of creative work. He sat at the small wooden desk, the same desk where he had once struggled with algebra homework, and opened a fresh, lined notebook that his mother had produced from a drawer. He stared at the blank page, a vast, white expanse of nothing, and tried to look thoughtful. He held a pen, uncapped, and occasionally tapped it against his teeth, an affectation he had probably seen in a film once. The act of performing the role of 'songwriter' was exhausting, a silent, one-man play for an audience of one. His mother would pop her head around the door every hour or so, a fresh cup of tea in her hand, her face a mixture of concern and reverence. \"Any ideas flowing, love?\" she would whisper, as if he were a skittish deer that might be startled by a loud noise. \"Don't you force it. They say it has to come naturally.\" He would just nod, offering a weak, pensive smile, and she would retreat, satisfied that she had witnessed the sacred, mysterious process of creation. He wrote nothing. The page remained as empty as he was.\n\nLate in the afternoon, the four walls of the house began to feel like they were closing in. He told his mother he was going for a walk, a phrase that now felt like a coded request for a temporary parole. He walked the familiar route to the canal, the damp air a welcome shock to his system. The path was muddy, strewn with autumn leaves, and the water was a sheet of dull, green-grey glass. He felt a flicker of something approaching peace, the simple, physical act of walking a relief from the static tension of the house. As he rounded a bend, he saw a familiar figure leaning against the lock gates, hunched over a rolling cigarette. It was Ben, the junior waiter from The Gilded Fork. He looked up as Arthur approached, his usual grunt of recognition replaced by a wide, slightly incredulous grin. \"Bloody hell. Arthur. It's you,\" he said, shaking his head in disbelief. \"What are you doing back here? Thought you'd be off in London, living it up with supermodels.\" The casual, good-natured comment highlighted the immense, unbridgeable gulf that now existed between them. \"Just back for a bit,\" Arthur said, his voice quiet. \"To work.\" Ben just laughed, a short, sharp bark. \"Work? Blimey. Bet it beats crumbing down Table 7 after the Albrights have been in, eh? Listen, mate, well done. Seriously. We all had a tenner on you. Henderson almost smiled when you won.\" The mundane detail, the mention of Mr Henderson\u2019s near-smile, was a message from a world he had lost forever. He was no longer a part of that world; he was just a story they told there now.\n\nThat evening, the quiet of the house felt different. The initial shock of his return had subsided, leaving behind a fragile, unspoken truce. They sat in front of the television, the familiar glow a comfort, but an undercurrent of tension hummed beneath the surface of the cheerful game show. Elsie kept glancing at him when she thought he wasn't looking, her maternal radar scanning him for cracks, for any sign of the desolate man who had appeared on her doorstep that morning. He knew he was being monitored, and the knowledge forced him to hold himself in a state of careful, casual composure, his posture relaxed, his expression placid. It was the hardest performance yet, requiring a constant, draining vigilance. During a commercial break, his phone vibrated in his pocket. He glanced at the screen. It was a text from Chloe. \u2018Okay, I\u2019ve found a potential studio for you just outside Preston. Decent gear. Engineer is a good lad. I\u2019m sending him your number. Expect a call tomorrow. We need to keep this train on the tracks, Arthur.\u2019 He read the message and a cold, heavy resignation settled over him. He had run two hundred miles, but the leash was still around his neck. He hadn\u2019t escaped. He had simply been relocated to a larger, more familiar-looking cage. He slipped the phone back into his pocket, the screen going dark, and turned his attention back to the television, where a woman had just won a speedboat, her shrieks of manufactured joy a hollow echo of his own.### Chapter 10\n\nThe reprieve was a fragile bubble, and it lasted for precisely thirty-six hours. In that time, Arthur existed in a state of suspended animation, a quiet limbo where the demands of his future had not yet caught up with the wreckage of his present. He moved through the small house like a convalescent, his actions slow and deliberate, his words carefully measured. He helped his mother with the washing up, he read the newspaper from cover to cover, and he sat in his bedroom, staring at the blank page of his notebook, the pen a cold, alien object in his hand. He was performing the role of a man at rest, a man reconnecting with his roots, and the performance was so convincing that, for brief, fleeting moments, he almost believed it himself. The quiet rhythm of his old life was a powerful opiate, dulling the sharp edges of his anxiety, and he allowed himself to sink into it, knowing it could not last.\n\nThe phone call came on Wednesday morning, as he was drying a plate his mother had just washed. The ringtone, a generic chime he had never bothered to change, was a shrill, unwelcome intrusion into the domestic harmony of clinking crockery and running water. The name on the screen was unknown, but the number was local. His heart sank with a dull, heavy finality. He answered, his voice a cautious murmur. The voice on the other end was cheerful, practical, and laced with the broad, friendly vowels of North Lancashire. \u201cIs that Arthur Penhaligon? It\u2019s Kev from Keystone Sound. Chloe from your label gave me a bell. Said you were looking for a place to lay some vocals down. We\u2019re just off the M61 near Preston. Dead easy to find. When d\u2019you fancy popping over to see if the place suits?\u201d\n\nThe mundane, business-like words were a death sentence for his brief illusion of escape. The machinery of his new life had located him, its gears grinding inexorably back into motion. Kev spoke of soundproofing and microphone choices, of getting a \u201cnice, warm, honest vocal sound,\u201d and the language was so different from Julian\u2019s talk of \u2018truth\u2019 and \u2018pain\u2019 that it was almost disorienting. This was a man who saw singing as a technical problem to be solved, not a soul to be flayed. \u201cTomorrow?\u201d Arthur heard himself say, the word coming out as a flat, toneless statement. \u201cYeah, I could do tomorrow.\u201d The appointment was made for eleven a.m. He ended the call and placed the phone on the counter, staring at its dark, blank screen. He had run home to find himself, and now London was sending a satellite office to his doorstep to ensure he remained lost.\n\nHe broke the news to his mother over a cup of tea, carefully framing it as a triumph, a sign that things were moving forward. \u201cThey\u2019ve found me a studio, Mam,\u201d he said, focusing his gaze on the swirling tea leaves in his mug. \u201cA local place, near Preston. So I can get back to work properly. Chloe arranged it all.\u201d Elsie\u2019s reaction was a complex cocktail of emotions. He saw the pride in her eyes at the efficiency of his new, powerful employers, the people who could arrange a recording studio with a single phone call. He saw the relief that he was engaging with the world again, that her son was not simply retreating into a silent, sad shell. But underneath it all, he saw the faint, unmistakable flicker of disappointment. Her convalescent was being discharged. Her boy was leaving again, even if only for the day. \u201cOh, that\u2019s wonderful, love,\u201d she said, her smile not quite reaching her eyes. \u201cSo soon! They don\u2019t let the grass grow under your feet, do they? You\u2019ll be driving, then. I\u2019ll make you up a flask. And some sandwiches. You can\u2019t rely on garage food.\u201d\n\nThe next morning, he found himself behind the wheel of his old Fiesta, the engine turning over with a familiar, grumpy cough. The journey was short, a twenty-minute drive down a motorway he had once seen as a ribbon of terror. Now, it was just a commute. He was a working man again, but the nature of his work was a grotesque parody of his former life. He wasn\u2019t going to wait on tables or polish cutlery; he was going to a small room to professionally re-enact his own sorrow. The absurdity of it was overwhelming. He passed a sign for a garden centre, a delivery lorry for a bakery, the mundane components of a world he no longer understood. He was a man with two lives, and he was beginning to feel that he wasn\u2019t truly living in either of them.\n\nKeystone Sound was located on a small, dreary industrial estate, squeezed between a wholesale plumbing supplier and a garage that specialised in van repairs. The name was painted in peeling blue letters on the corrugated iron door of a featureless breeze-block unit. There was no curated cool here, no sense of it being a creative Mecca. It was a place of work, as glamorous as a laundrette. Arthur parked his tired red car next to a greasy-looking white transit van and felt a profound sense of dislocation. He had sung in a multi-million-pound television studio, he had recorded in a legendary London mews, and now he was here, in a shed in an industrial estate, to try and manufacture a masterpiece. He took a deep breath, the air smelling of diesel fumes and damp concrete, and knocked on the corrugated door.\n\nThe man who opened it was exactly as his voice had suggested. Kev was in his fifties, with a kind, weathered face, a receding hairline, and a faded t-shirt for a band Arthur had never heard of. He greeted Arthur with a firm handshake and a warm, uncomplicated smile. \u201cArthur! Come on in, mate. Welcome to the palace.\u201d The studio, or \u2018the palace\u2019, was one large, cluttered room, with a vocal booth, no bigger than a wardrobe, built into one corner. It was a chaotic jungle of wires, microphone stands, and precariously stacked effects units. It smelled of soldering fumes, stale coffee, and dust. Kev was immensely proud of it. He showed Arthur his favourite vintage compressor, his collection of microphones, his mixing desk that he had bought second-hand from a studio in Manchester. He was a craftsman, a man who loved the tools of his trade. Arthur found himself liking him immediately, and the feeling filled him with a quiet dread.\n\nHe was ushered into the tiny vocal booth. It was claustrophobic, the foam-lined walls pressing in on him. Kev handed him a pair of headphones and gave him a cheerful thumbs-up through the small, thick glass window. \u201cRight then, Arthur. Chloe sent the backing track over. \u2018Ghost of a Footprint\u2019, it\u2019s called. Lovely tune. Let\u2019s just do a level check, and then we\u2019ll go for a take. Just give it what you\u2019ve got, lad.\u201d Arthur put on the headphones. The familiar, melancholic piano melody began to play, a sound he now associated with the subtle art of emotional self-harm. He closed his eyes, preparing himself, waiting for the familiar descent into the darkness. He summoned the images, the memories, the feelings. But nothing happened. Here, in this cramped, stuffy box, with the friendly, no-nonsense face of Kev beaming at him from the other side of the glass, the ghosts refused to appear. His grand, internal tragedy felt stagey and ridiculous. The raw pain that had been so readily accessible in the pressurised environment of London was gone, leaving only a hollow echo.\n\nHe sang, but the voice that came out was thin, controlled, and utterly devoid of the \u2018beautiful sadness\u2019 that was his one marketable asset. It was the voice of Arthur Penhaligon, the waiter, doing a competent but uninspired job. When the song finished, Kev\u2019s voice crackled in the headphones, bright and enthusiastic. \u201cSmashing, mate! Got it in one! Sounding absolutely spot on. Great pitch. We\u2019ll get another one down just for safety, but honestly, that\u2019s a beauty. Nice and clean.\u201d Kev, the craftsman, had heard a clean take, a professional vocal, and considered the job done. He had no idea he had just witnessed a catastrophic failure of the product line. Arthur stood in the silent, stuffy booth, his heart pounding a slow, heavy rhythm of panic. \u201cIt\u2019s not right,\u201d Arthur said into the microphone, his voice barely a whisper. \u201cIt needs more\u2026 emotion.\u201d\n\nKev\u2019s face, seen through the glass, registered a flicker of good-natured confusion. \u201cEmotion? Right. You want me to push the reverb up a bit on the cans? Give it a bit more of a \u2018live room\u2019 feel for you?\u201d He was offering a technical solution to an existential problem. Arthur realised, with a sickening clarity, the futility of his situation. He couldn\u2019t ask this kind, practical man to help him sound more heartbroken. He couldn\u2019t explain that his job was not to sing well, but to suffer audibly. The whole premise was so monstrous, so insane, that it couldn\u2019t be spoken aloud, not here, not to a man like Kev. \u201cNo,\u201d Arthur said, his voice flat with defeat. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. Let\u2019s just\u2026 do another one.\u201d They recorded three more takes, each one as technically proficient and emotionally bankrupt as the first. The session was a disaster.\n\nThe drive back to Lancaster was a journey into a new circle of hell. He had fled London because the process of performing his sadness was destroying him. Now, he had discovered something even worse: he couldn\u2019t even do that anymore. The one terrible, dark gift he possessed had deserted him. He was a failure as a person and now, he was a failure as a product. The pressure he had tried to escape was about to return, tenfold. He was a broken instrument, a singer who could no longer produce the only note his employers wanted to hear. He pulled up outside his small, terraced house, the engine of the Fiesta sputtering into silence. He sat for a long moment, gripping the steering wheel, paralysed by a despair so profound it felt like a physical illness.\n\nHe finally forced himself out of the car and walked the short, familiar path to his front door. He turned the key and stepped inside. The house smelled of baking bread and furniture polish, the scent of his mother\u2019s love. She appeared from the living room, wiping her hands on her apron, her face alight with a hopeful, anxious smile. She had been waiting for him, the good parent waiting for their child to come home from their first day at a new job. \u201cThere you are, love!\u201d she said, her voice bright and full of a determined cheerfulness. \u201cHow did it go? A good day at the office?\u201d The simple, loving phrase, the casual reference to a normal life of work and reward, struck him with the force of a physical blow. He had to switch masks again, from the failed recording artist to the successful, hardworking son. He summoned the very last of his emotional reserves, a final, desperate act of performance. \u201cIt was great, Mam,\u201d he said, forcing a smile that felt like it was tearing his face apart. \u201cA really good, productive day.\u201dThe lie, once spoken, took on a life of its own. It sat between them at the dinner table as his mother served him a shepherd\u2019s pie made with a love so fierce it was almost a physical ingredient. It watched television with them in the evening, a third, silent presence on the sofa, its shadow falling over the cheerful inanity of a celebrity dancing competition. Arthur nodded and smiled, commented on a clumsy foxtrot or a garish costume, and all the while, he was listening to the sound of his own failure, the clean, emotionless vocal takes playing on a loop in the private, sound-proofed studio of his mind. He was a fraud twice over now, a man who could neither feel nor fake the very thing that had made him famous.\n\nThe night offered no escape, only a different kind of vigil. He lay in the narrow bed of his childhood, the familiar dip in the mattress a hollow where a more peaceful version of himself used to sleep. He stared into the darkness, his thoughts a frantic, scurrying pack of rats. He imagined Kev, the kindly engineer, emailing the audio files to London. He imagined Julian, with his soft cardigan and surgical gaze, loading the tracks, his brow furrowed in concentration. He imagined the moment the sound filled Julian\u2019s expensive studio speakers \u2013 the polite, competent, and utterly dead voice of a stranger. He imagined the silence that would follow, a silence pregnant not with awe, but with cold, commercial disappointment. He felt a bead of sweat trace a path from his temple to his jaw. He was a man on death row, waiting for the governor\u2019s call to be denied.\n\nThe next morning, he couldn\u2019t eat. His mother placed a plate of perfectly cooked bacon and eggs in front of him, her face a study in anxious care, but the food looked like wax. The smell of it made his stomach clench. \u201cYou\u2019re not eating,\u201d she stated, her voice gentle but firm. \u201cYou\u2019re wasting away to nothing. Is it the work? Are you worried?\u201d He pushed a piece of bacon around his plate with his fork. \u201cJust thinking, Mam,\u201d he said, the excuse sounding thin and worn even to his own ears. \u201cBig song. Got to get it right.\u201d He was waiting. Every time the postman walked past the window, every time a car slowed on the street, his nervous system jolted, a high-voltage shock of pure dread. He kept his phone on the table beside him, face down, as if not looking at it might prevent it from ringing.\n\nIt was just after ten o\u2019clock when it happened. The phone didn\u2019t ring; it vibrated, a low, angry buzz against the polished wood of the dining table. He saw his mother\u2019s eyes flick towards it. The name on the screen was JULIAN. His hand felt impossibly heavy as he reached for it. He stood up from the table. \u201cIt\u2019s the studio,\u201d he said, his voice a dry croak. He walked into the hallway for the illusion of privacy, his back to the living room door, his heart hammering a frantic, panicked rhythm against his ribs. He swiped to answer. \u201cJulian,\u201d he said, the name coming out as a breathless puff of air.\n\n\u201cArthur.\u201d Julian\u2019s voice was not angry. It was something far worse. It was quiet, calm, and freighted with a deep, clinical disappointment. It was the voice of a doctor contemplating a terminal diagnosis. \u201cI\u2019ve been listening to the files Kev sent over.\u201d A pause stretched, a vast, echoing canyon of silence into which Arthur felt himself falling. \u201cThey\u2019re very\u2026 clean, Arthur.\u201d The word was a masterpiece of professional understatement, a verbal stiletto slipped between his ribs. \u201cTechnically, they\u2019re perfect. Your pitch is impeccable. But you\u2019re not there. The man who sang \u2018Calon L\u00e2n\u2019 is not on these recordings. I thought being home, being back at the source, would open you up, not shut you down. What happened?\u201d\n\nArthur leaned his forehead against the cool, floral-patterned wallpaper of the hall, the receiver slick with sweat in his hand. What happened? How could he possibly explain? How could he say that the source of his art was not a wholesome connection to his roots, but a toxic, unsustainable combination of terror, guilt, and isolation that could only be brewed in the pressurised loneliness of London? How could he admit that his mother\u2019s love, the very thing he was trying to protect, was the antidote to the poison the label wanted him to bottle and sell? He had no words. He stammered, mumbled something about a new environment, about it being a first attempt. Julian let him flounder for a few seconds before cutting in, his voice losing its therapeutic softness and taking on a hard, executive edge. \u201cLook, this isn\u2019t working. It\u2019s not a question of practice, Arthur. You\u2019ve lost the frequency. And we are on a very tight schedule. Chloe and I have been discussing it. We can\u2019t afford to scrap these sessions. We have to get this back on track. Now.\u201d\n\nAnother terrible pause. Arthur held his breath, waiting for the sentence. \u201cSo,\u201d Julian continued, his voice now brisk, decisive, the voice of a man enacting a solution, \u201cif the artist can\u2019t get to the right headspace, we\u2019re going to have to bring the headspace to the artist. I\u2019m coming up to Lancaster.\u201d The words hit Arthur with the force of a physical impact. He felt the blood drain from his face. Julian. Here. In this house, with his mother, with the fake smiles and the cups of tea. The two halves of his life, the two irreconcilable realities he had been struggling to keep in separate hemispheres, were about to collide in a catastrophic, head-on crash. \u201cNo,\u201d he whispered into the phone. \u201cNo, you can\u2019t. There\u2019s no need for that. I can do it. I just need another day.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a request, Arthur,\u201d Julian said, his tone leaving no room for negotiation. \u201cIt\u2019s happening. I\u2019ve already booked my train. I\u2019ll be there this evening. I\u2019ll stay at a hotel in the city centre, and we will work at Kev\u2019s studio tomorrow. Together. We are going to find that beautiful sadness again. One way or another.\u201d The line went dead. Arthur stood frozen in the hallway, the phone still pressed to his ear, listening to the dial tone, a monotonous, mocking sound that was the new soundtrack to his life. He felt a gentle touch on his arm and he flinched, spinning around. His mother was standing there, her face a mask of love and profound concern. She had been there the whole time. \u201cWho was that, love?\u201d she asked softly, her eyes searching his. \u201cYou look like you\u2019ve seen a ghost.\u201d",

                                        "text": "The serviette, folded into the shape of a bishop\u2019s mitre, was the first casualty. Arthur Penhaligon watched it surrender, its crisp, starched confidence wilting in the condensation of a G&T glass. It slumped, a soft white flag on the dark wood of Table 7. He should have used a coaster. Mr Henderson would have his hide for that. But his mind wasn\u2019t on coasters. It wasn\u2019t on the smear of b\u00e9arnaise sauce on Mrs Albright\u2019s side plate or the fact that the lads on Table 12 were about to get rowdy. His mind was a hundred and eighty miles south, under a blizzard of confetti and the heat of a thousand stage lights.\n\nArthur was a constellation of tiny, rehearsed movements. A dip of the head, a flick of the wrist to present the wine list, the silent, gliding walk that was the hallmark of a man who had spent a decade trying to be invisible. He worked at \u2018The Gilded Fork\u2019, a name far grander than the establishment itself, a place in Lancaster that aspired to fine dining but mostly settled for being the default option for anniversaries and awkward corporate dinners. He was, by all accounts, a good waiter. Attentive. Discreet. But lately, his discretion was cracking. He\u2019d find himself humming. Not just a mindless tune, but the soaring bridge of \u2018Nessun Dorma\u2019, his voice a low, resonant thrum in the back of his throat as he cleared away half-eaten steaks. He\u2019d tap out the rhythm of a powerful crescendo on the edge of his serving tray, a frantic, silent drumming that only he could hear.\n\nThe phone call had come three days ago. He\u2019d been in the stockroom, the air thick with the smell of cardboard and cheap cleaning fluid, counting napkins. His mobile, an old thing with a spiderweb crack across the screen, had vibrated against a box of communion-wafer-thin mints. A London number. A slick, impossibly cheerful voice belonging to a woman named Chloe.\n\u201cArthur? Chloe from Syco. We\u2019ve got the numbers. The public vote\u2026 Arthur, you\u2019re in. You\u2019re in the final.\u201d\n\nThe world had tilted. The dusty shelves of a Lancaster stockroom became the epicentre of the universe. He had leaned against a crate of Chilean Merlot, the cheap wine suddenly priceless, his breath catching in his throat. The final. Not a dream. Not a fantasy he played out in his head while polishing cutlery until his own reflection stared back, tired and vague. It was real. The golden buzzer from the auditions, a moment of pure, blinding shock that felt like a lightning strike, had been one thing. The semi-final, a terrifying blur of adrenaline and dry-ice smoke, had been another. But this? This was the summit. The air was thin up here.\n\n\u201cYou there, love?\u201d a voice crackled, pulling him from his memory. Mrs Gable from Table 4, a woman whose face was a delicate roadmap of her ninety-two years. She was a regular, a Tuesday-and-Thursday fixture.\n\u201cSorry, Mrs Gable. Miles away.\u201d He offered a smile that he hoped reached his eyes.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got that look again,\u201d she said, her own eyes, pale blue and watery, twinkling. \u201cLike you\u2019ve swallowed a canary. A whole choir of them.\u201d\nArthur\u2019s smile became genuine. \u201cJust thinking.\u201d\n\u201cAbout London, I\u2019ll be bound. Our lad. On the telly.\u201d She patted his hand, her skin as fine and dry as parchment. \u201cYou\u2019ll do us proud, Arthur. Just remember to stand up straight. And don\u2019t you dare sing any of that racket the youngsters like.\u201d\n\u201cVera Lynn. Just for you, Mrs Gable,\u201d he promised, and her face lit up.\n\nThe promise was easy to make. He carried a hundred such promises in his pockets, little pebbles of expectation from the people of this city. Since the semi-final aired, he couldn\u2019t walk to the corner shop without being stopped. \u201cIt\u2019s him, our Arthur!\u201d people would whisper. The butcher gave him his best cuts of bacon for free. The woman in the bakery insisted he take a 'good luck' Eccles cake. He was no longer just Arthur Penhaligon, the quiet man from the terraced house on the canal. He was \u2018Lancaster\u2019s Lark\u2019, a headline from the local paper that made his cheeks burn every time he thought of it. He felt the weight of it, a heavy, warm cloak he wasn\u2019t sure he knew how to wear.\n\nHe moved through the evening service on autopilot. The clatter of the kitchen, the drone of conversations, the endless, looping pop music piped through the ceiling speakers \u2013 it all faded into a gentle, ignorable hum. The only sound with any clarity was the song in his own head. He was still deciding. The producers wanted something big, something anthemic. Another Puccini, maybe. But Arthur was leaning towards something simpler. Something from the heart. A Welsh hymn his mother used to sing. It felt right. It felt like him.\n\nHis mother. Elsie. He\u2019d called her straight after the producer, his hand shaking so much he could barely hold the phone. He\u2019d pictured her in her small, neat-as-a-pin bungalow, the scent of lavender polish and Earl Grey tea in the air.\n\u201cMam? It\u2019s me.\u201d\n\u201cArthur! I was just watching the kettle. Thinking it\u2019s nearly time for your break.\u201d She always knew his schedule, a timetable of his life etched into her own.\n\u201cI\u2019m in, Mam. The final.\u201d\nSilence. For a second, a cold spike of fear lanced through him. Had the line gone dead? \u201cMam?\u201d\nThen, a sound like a gasp, a sob, a laugh, all tangled into one. \u201cOh, my boy. My beautiful, beautiful boy. I knew it. I always knew it.\u201d\nHe could hear the tears in her voice, and it made his own eyes sting. He\u2019d spent his whole life trying to make her proud, a quiet, desperate effort since his dad had left, leaving a void that Arthur had tried to fill with good grades, steady employment, and a conspicuous lack of trouble. But none of it, not the school prizes or the promotion to head waiter, had ever earned a reaction like this. This was a pride that felt elemental, a force of nature.\n\u201cDon\u2019t you get overwhelmed now,\u201d she\u2019d said, her voice shifting into its familiar, fussing cadence. \u201cYou make sure you eat properly. And get your sleep. You look peaky on the telly, love. It\u2019s the lighting, I\u2019m sure, but a mother worries.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m fine, Mam. Honestly.\u201d\n\u201cOf course you are. You\u2019re my Arthur. Strong as an ox, you are.\u201d\nHe wasn't. Not really. He was a man who polished glasses for a living. But when she said it, for a moment, he believed her. A strange, unseasonable shiver traced its way down his spine then, right there in the warm stockroom. A sudden, deep cold that had nothing to do with the temperature. He\u2019d shaken it off. Nerves, that's all.\n\nThe last diners finally drifted out just after eleven, trailing scarves and the scent of expensive perfume. The Gilded Fork exhaled, its shoulders slumping in relief. Arthur and the other junior waiter, a university student named Ben who mostly communicated in grunts, began the long, slow process of resetting the room for the next day. Stripping tables, crumbing down, polishing cutlery. It was a ritual he usually found soothing, the methodical restoration of order from chaos. But tonight, every polished fork was a second ticking away, another moment gone from the precious few days he had left. The final was on Saturday. It was already Tuesday night.\n\n\u201cBig weekend for you, then,\u201d Ben grunted, upending a salt shaker into a steel container.\n\u201cYeah. A bit,\u201d Arthur said, his voice quiet in the cavernous, empty room.\n\u201cGonna be weird, innit? Seeing you on a massive screen instead of just\u2026 here.\u201d Ben gestured vaguely at the restaurant, at the life Arthur was about to leave behind, if only for a night.\n\u201cIt\u2019s weird for me, too.\u201d\nMr Henderson emerged from his office, keys jangling. He was a man built of sharp angles and disapproval, but tonight his face was softer. \u201cPenhaligon. My office. A moment.\u201d\nArthur\u2019s stomach tightened. He followed the manager into the tiny, cluttered room, expecting a lecture about the water-damaged serviette.\nMr Henderson sat down heavily behind his desk. He cleared his throat. \u201cI\u2019ve rearranged the rota. Given you the rest of the week off. Paid.\u201d\nArthur blinked. \u201cSir? You don\u2019t have to do that. I can work until Thursday.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t be a fool, man. You\u2019re representing this city, for heaven\u2019s sake. In a small, tangential way, you\u2019re representing this restaurant.\u201d He looked almost pained to admit it. \u201cGo. Practice. Don\u2019t make us look like idiots.\u201d He opened a drawer and pulled out a card. It was a cheap, garish thing with a glittery horseshoe on the front. Inside, in the scrawled handwriting of every member of staff, were messages of good luck. Even a grunt from Ben that just said \u2018Smash it\u2019.\nTucked inside was a bundle of notes. Fifties. At least three hundred pounds.\n\u201cA collection,\u201d Mr Henderson said gruffly, refusing to meet Arthur\u2019s eye. \u201cFor your expenses. Hotels in London aren\u2019t cheap.\u201d\nArthur stared at the money, a lump forming in his throat. \u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t know what to say.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t say anything. Just win.\u201d\n\nHe walked home under a sky the colour of bruised plums. The air was cold, carrying the damp, earthy smell of the canal. Lancaster was asleep, its stone buildings hunched and silent. His own footsteps echoed, a lonely rhythm on the pavement. He felt a profound sense of dislocation, as if he were watching himself from a great height. There was Arthur, the waiter, walking his usual route home. But inside, a different Arthur was vibrating, a tuning fork struck against a star. The money in his pocket felt heavy, a tangible symbol of the faith this town was placing in him. It wasn't just his dream anymore.\n\nHis house was the middle of a row of three, identical but for the colour of their front doors. His was a peeling, forgettable brown. He let himself in, the familiar click of the lock a small comfort. The house was cold. Colder than it should be. He ran a hand along the radiator in the hall. Tepid. He\u2019d have to bleed them again. He stood for a moment in the darkness, listening to the house settle around him. There was a faint, persistent drip from the kitchen tap and the low hum of the refrigerator. It was the soundtrack of his life, a quiet, unassuming melody. But now, all he could hear were the crashing chords of a future he hadn\u2019t dared to imagine.\n\nHe didn\u2019t turn on the lights. He walked through to the small living room, the moonlight painting a silver rectangle on the worn carpet. On the mantelpiece, amongst a collection of ceramic birds, was a framed photograph. Him and his mother, taken ten years ago in Morecambe. They were squinting into the sun, a half-melted ice cream cone in his hand. Her arm was around his shoulder, her smile wide and unreserved. He picked it up, the cold glass chilling his fingertips. He saw the boy in the picture, the one who sang in the school choir and dreamed of the stage, a boy who had slowly been buried under the weight of bills and responsibilities and the quiet, creeping fear of disappointment. He was still in there, that boy. And in four days, he was going to walk onto a stage in front of fifteen million people and sing his heart out. For his mother. For Mrs Gable. For Lancaster. For himself.\n\nHe sank into his worn armchair, the springs groaning in protest. The chill was back, deep in his bones this time, a cold that had nothing to do with the faulty radiators. It felt ancient. He pulled his jacket tighter around himself, his gaze drifting to the window. Across the street, parked under a flickering streetlamp, was his car. A fifteen-year-old Ford Fiesta, the colour of a faded poppy. The driver\u2019s side wing was a slightly different shade of red, the result of a misjudged encounter with a bollard. It was a tired, cantankerous machine. But it was his. His chariot. On Friday morning, he would load it up, turn the key, and point it south. The thought filled him with a dizzying mix of terror and glee. Everything, absolutely everything, was riding on that journey. He closed his eyes, and for a moment, just a fleeting, sickening moment, he heard not the roar of a crowd, but the high-pitched squeal of tortured rubber on wet tarmac. He snapped his eyes open, his heart hammering against his ribs. The room was silent. Just the drip, drip, drip from the kitchen tap. Just the hum of the fridge. He was just tired. Overwrought. That\u2019s all it was. It had to be."

The drip of the tap was louder here, a maddeningly irregular plink-plonk into the stainless-steel sink. He twisted the handle, putting his shoulder into it until the metal groaned and the sound ceased. The silence that followed was somehow worse, thick and expectant. He stood there for a long time, one hand braced on the chilly formica countertop, the other pressed against his chest, as if he could physically still the frantic bird that was beating against his ribs. Sleep, when it finally came, was a shallow, restless affair, punctuated by dreams of falling confetti that turned to snow, and the distant, mournful sound of a car horn that wouldn't stop.\n\nThe next morning, Wednesday, dawned grey and damp. The absence of his uniform felt like a missing limb. He made toast and let it go cold on the plate, his appetite gone. The house felt too big, too quiet. To fill the silence, he decided to practice. He stood in the centre of the living room, a space designed for two armchairs and a small television, and took a deep, preparatory breath. He started with scales, his voice tentative at first, a guest in his own home. Then he let it swell, the notes of the Welsh hymn, \u2018Calon L\u00e2n\u2019, filling the small room, vibrating through the floorboards and rattling the ceramic birds on the mantelpiece. The sound was too large for the space. It bounced off the floral wallpaper and the low ceiling, feeling trapped and desperate. It was a voice made for cathedrals and grand theatres, and here it was, caged in a terraced house by a canal. He stopped mid-phrase, the final note hanging unfinished in the air, a profound sense of inadequacy washing over him.\n\nHis phone rang, startling him. It was his mother.\n\u201cAre you practising, love?\u201d she asked, her voice bright. \u201cI thought I could hear angels.\u201d\nHe smiled, the tension in his shoulders easing. \u201cJust making a racket, Mam.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a racket, it\u2019s a gift. Now, I\u2019ve been thinking. Your sister can\u2019t get the time off work, more\u2019s the pity, but her Dave said he\u2019ll drive me down on Saturday morning. We\u2019ll be there in the audience. I\u2019ve bought a new hat. Peacock blue.\u201d\nArthur\u2019s blood ran cold. The shiver from the stockroom was back, intense and sharp. His mother, on the motorway, for five hours. Her brother-in-law Dave, a man whose driving philosophy was to treat the accelerator as an on/off switch. The image from the night before flooded his mind: the squeal of tyres, the sickening crunch. It was so vivid, so visceral, that he had to sit down.\n\u201cArthur? You still there? You\u2019ve gone quiet.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 that\u2019s a long way for you to come, Mam.\u201d\n\u201cNonsense. I wouldn\u2019t miss it for the world. Seeing my boy\u2026 seeing his dream come true. I\u2019ll wave the hat. You\u2019ll see me.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, Mam,\u201d he said, his voice a hoarse whisper. \u201cI\u2019ll look for you.\u201d\nHe ended the call feeling ten times more terrified than before. The stakes had been raised to an impossible height. It wasn\u2019t just about him and his voice anymore. It was about his mother\u2019s new hat, her proud, beaming face in the crowd, and her safe passage down a hundred and eighty miles of unforgiving tarmac.\n\nHe had to get out. He pulled on a coat and walked towards the town centre, his head down, hoping to remain invisible. It was a futile hope. The headline \u2018Lancaster\u2019s Lark\u2019 had made his face, once part of the city\u2019s quiet background, into a local landmark.\n\u201cThere he is! Arthur!\u201d A woman with a pushchair beamed at him. \u201cAll the best, love! We\u2019re all voting for you!\u201d\n\u201cGive \u2018em what for, lad!\u201d shouted a man from a scaffolding rig, his voice echoing across the square.\nArthur nodded, mumbled his thanks, his cheeks burning. He felt like an imposter, a fraud accepting praise for a victory he hadn\u2019t yet earned, and might not survive to see. He bought a newspaper and a pint of milk, the simple transaction feeling strangely theatrical, as if he were playing the part of a normal person. The woman behind the counter refused his money. \u201cOn the house, for our celebrity,\u201d she said with a wink. The kindness felt like another stone added to the weight in his pockets. He retreated home, the front door clicking shut behind him like the closing of a portcullis.\n\nThursday was spent in a fever of anxious preparation. He laid out his one good suit on the bed, polishing his shoes until they shone with a desperate, dark lustre. He packed a small overnight bag with a meticulousness born of sheer panic: toothbrush, shirt, the glittery good luck card from his colleagues, which he tucked into an inside pocket like a talisman. In the afternoon, he went out to the car. He lifted the bonnet of the Fiesta and stared at the engine, a greasy, complex tangle he didn\u2019t understand. He checked the oil and the water, just as his father had taught him, the memory a faint, ghostly echo. He kicked the tyres. He even cleaned the windscreen, scrubbing away a winter\u2019s worth of grime. As he worked, he could feel the cold seeping up from the pavement, a damp chill that settled deep in his marrow. His tired, poppy-red chariot. It looked so small, so fragile. The journey felt less like a drive to London and more like a voyage across a vast, uncertain ocean, in a vessel he was no longer sure he could trust. He locked it and went back inside, the premonition no longer a fleeting sound, but a low, constant hum beneath the surface of his thoughts. He was no longer sure it was just nerves. It felt like a warning."

                                        "text": "Chapter 2\n\nHe ate a tin of soup for dinner, standing over the sink, the metallic taste coating his tongue. He couldn\u2019t face sitting at the table, couldn't bear the empty chair opposite him. The house, usually a sanctuary of quiet solitude, now felt like a mausoleum. Every creak of the floorboards above, every sigh of the wind in the chimney, sounded like a lament. He went to bed early, hoping to bank a few hours of sleep against the long day to come, but his mind refused to quieten. It played a cruel highlight reel of all his anxieties: the intimidating vastness of the London studio, the sea of expectant faces, the crushing weight of a high note held for too long. But beneath it all, the dominant theme, the relentless undertone, was the M6 motorway. A long, grey ribbon of tarmac, slick with rain, hemmed in by roaring lorries.\n\nLying in the dark, the image became terrifyingly clear. He saw his mother's peacock-blue hat, a bright splash of colour in the crumpled wreckage of a small car. He heard her laughter abruptly cut short. He felt the cold shock of impact, a phantom jolt that made him flinch in his bed. It wasn\u2019t a dream or a memory; it was a scene playing out in the theatre of his mind with the brutal clarity of a premonition. He sat bolt upright, his pyjamas damp with a cold sweat, his breath coming in ragged gasps. The feeling was no longer a shiver or a hum. It was a certainty, as solid and unshakeable as the stone of Lancaster Castle. Something terrible was waiting for his mother on that road.\n\nSleep was impossible after that. He spent the rest of the night pacing the small landing, a ghost in his own home, from the spare room filled with boxes of his mother's old things to the top of the stairs and back again. He tried to rationalise it. He was under immense pressure. He was exhausted. It was a textbook case of pre-performance jitters manifesting in a morbid fantasy. He told himself this over and over, the words a hollow mantra, but the cold conviction in his gut refused to yield. Reason was a flimsy shield against a fear so primal. The sun rose on Friday morning to find him grey-faced and hollow-eyed, sitting in the armchair with the framed photograph of him and his mother held tightly in his hands.\n\nAt eight o'clock, he loaded his bag and suit carrier into the Fiesta. The car seemed to sag under the minimal weight, its poppy-red paintwork looking less faded and more anaemic in the thin morning light. He ran his hand over the driver\u2019s side wing, the slightly-off shade of red a testament to a past mistake. He thought of his sister\u2019s husband, Dave, a man who drove with a kind of belligerent confidence Arthur found terrifying. He pictured Dave's heavy-set hands on the steering wheel, his foot pressing down, his mind on getting to London in record time rather than the precious cargo beside him. The simple act of putting the key in the ignition felt like a monumental betrayal. He was starting his journey, the one that would, in turn, set his mother on hers. He turned the key. The engine coughed, spluttered, then grudgingly caught, settling into its familiar, uneven idle.\n\nThe first hour of the drive south was a form of torture. His knuckles were white on the steering wheel, his eyes scanning the road, the mirrors, the sky, searching for threats. Every car that loomed in his rear-view mirror was a potential aggressor, every patch of shadow on the road ahead a treacherous slick of oil. The familiar landscape of Lancashire blurred into an indistinguishable smear of green and grey. He kept the radio off, unable to bear the thought of a cheerful DJ or a pop song intruding on his high-strung vigil. The only sounds were the drone of the engine and the whistle of the wind through the aging door seals, a lonely, mournful sound that perfectly matched his mood. He was \u2018Lancaster\u2019s Lark\u2019, heading for the biggest moment of his life, and he had never felt less like singing.\n\nJust south of Knutsford services, it happened. A white van, its sides caked with mud, had been tailgating him for miles. Impatient, the driver suddenly swerved out, cutting in front of a blue saloon in the middle lane to overtake Arthur. The saloon driver, startled, slammed on their brakes. The sound, a high-pitched, desperate screech of rubber on tarmac, tore through the cabin of the Fiesta. Arthur\u2019s heart stopped. His foot stomped on his own brake pedal out of pure reflex, the car lurching as it slowed. The premonition was real. The sound he had heard in his head, in his dreams, was now echoing on the M6, just a hundred feet in front of him. The saloon swerved, corrected itself, and sped on, the moment of danger passing in a heartbeat. But for Arthur, time had frozen. The world went silent, his ears ringing with that terrible sound. He was shaking so violently he could barely keep his hands on the wheel.\n\nHe indicated, his movements jerky and uncoordinated, and steered the little Fiesta onto the hard shoulder, bumping to a halt behind the steel crash barrier. He switched off the engine, and the sudden silence was deafening. Lorries thundered past, shaking the small car, their slipstream rocking it like a boat in a storm. He leaned his forehead against the cold plastic of the steering wheel, his eyes squeezed shut, but the image of the blue saloon fishtailing was burned onto the back of his eyelids. It could have been them. It could have been Dave\u2019s car. It could have been his mother\u2019s hat. That was it. He couldn\u2019t do it. He couldn\u2019t let her travel. The pride, the glory, the fifteen million viewers, none of it was worth this sickening, absolute certainty of disaster.\n\nWith a trembling hand, he reached for his phone, the one with the spiderweb crack across the screen. He found his mother\u2019s number and pressed the call button, his thumb hovering over it for a long second. This was going to break her heart. She would think he was mad, that the pressure had gotten to him. She would be so disappointed. But disappointing her was better than the alternative his mind kept serving up. He took a deep, shuddering breath, the air tasting of exhaust fumes and fear, and pressed his thumb to the screen. The phone began to ring, each tone a hammer blow against his resolve.\n\u201cArthur? Are you on your way, love? How\u2019s the traffic?\u201d Her voice was full of cheerful excitement, a sound from another, brighter universe.\n\u201cMam,\u201d he began, his own voice a dry, cracked thing. \u201cMam, listen to me. I need you to do something for me. I need you to stay home. Don\u2019t come to London.\u201d\n\nThere was a pause on the other end of the line. When she spoke again, the cheerfulness had been replaced by a puzzled concern. \u201cWhat are you talking about, Arthur? Don\u2019t be silly. Dave\u2019s already put petrol in the car. My hat is in its box by the door. Of course we\u2019re coming.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said, the word coming out with more force than he intended. \u201cNo, Mam, you can\u2019t. It\u2019s not safe. The roads\u2026 the drive. It\u2019s not safe.\u201d\n\u201cNot safe? We\u2019ve driven to your sister\u2019s in Scotland a dozen times, it\u2019s no different. Have you had a prang? Is the car alright?\u201d\n\u201cThe car is fine. I\u2019m fine. It\u2019s\u2026 I have a feeling, Mam. A terrible, awful feeling. Please. For me. Just watch it on the telly. Please stay home.\u201d\nHe could hear the hurt creeping into her voice, a fine crackle of disappointment over the line. \u201cA feeling? Arthur, you\u2019re letting your nerves get the better of you. It\u2019s a big day, I know, but you can\u2019t let silly superstitions take over. I want to be there. I need to be there for you.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I need you to be safe!\u201d he cried, the desperation finally breaking through. His voice was ragged with it. \u201cI can\u2019t explain it. I can\u2019t. But I know it. As sure as I\u2019m sitting here, I know something will happen if you and Dave get on that motorway tomorrow. Mam, please. I\u2019m begging you. If you love me, you\u2019ll stay home.\u201d\n\nThe silence that followed stretched for an eternity. He could picture her in her neat-as-a-pin bungalow, her hand on the receiver, her face a mask of confusion and hurt. This was the one person in the world he never wanted to cause pain, and here he was, crushing her excitement with an insane, inexplicable demand. He heard a resigned sigh.\n\u201cAlright, Arthur,\u201d she said, her voice small and thin, all the light gone from it. \u201cAlright, love. If it\u2019s that important to you. We won\u2019t come.\u201d\nThe relief that flooded him was so immense it made him feel faint, but it was immediately followed by a wave of guilt so profound it was nauseating. He had won. He had kept her safe. And in doing so, he had just broken his mother's heart.\n\u201cThank you, Mam,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI love you.\u201d\n\u201cI love you too, my boy,\u201d she said, but her voice was distant, as if she were already a hundred miles away. \u201cJust\u2026 just do your best, Arthur. Make us proud.\u201d\nThe line went dead. Arthur sat for a long time on the hard shoulder of the M6, the phone limp in his hand, the roar of the traffic a meaningless drone. He had averted a disaster that only he could see, but he felt no victory. He just felt utterly, completely alone."

                                        "text": "He restarted the engine. The sound was flat and ordinary now, stripped of all its menacing portent. Pulling back onto the motorway felt like merging into a different reality. The terror was gone, lanced like a boil, but what remained was a landscape bleached of all colour, a world rendered in shades of grey. He was safe. She was safe. This was the knowledge he had to cling to, the central pillar around which the ruins of the day were collapsing. He had paid for that safety with his mother\u2019s happiness, a currency he never thought he\u2019d have to spend. The guilt was a cold, heavy passenger sitting beside him, its weight pressing the little car closer to the tarmac.\n\nThe remainder of the drive was a featureless crawl through a country that no longer felt like his own. He passed signs for places he'd only ever heard of, each one a marker taking him further from the life he understood, from the man he was just this morning. The vibrant, terrifying future he had been hurtling towards had been replaced by a quiet, hollow present. By the time the dense, sprawling suburbs of London began to close in around him, he felt less like a finalist arriving for his moment of glory and more like a fugitive, fleeing the scene of a crime only he knew he had committed.\n\nThe television studio was a world of polished glass and aggressive cheerfulness. A security guard, whose neck was thicker than Arthur\u2019s thigh, checked his name off a list and directed him towards an underground car park. The tired, poppy-red Fiesta looked shabby and out of place parked between a gleaming black Range Rover and a silver Mercedes. He felt a sudden, fierce loyalty to the little car, his partner in the strange, lonely ordeal of the morning. He grabbed his suit carrier and bag and walked into the bright, air-conditioned belly of the beast, feeling the quiet life of Lancaster slough off him with every step. He was greeted almost immediately by Chloe, the producer, who moved with a velocity that seemed to defy the normal laws of physics.\n\u201cArthur! You made it! Traffic a nightmare?\u201d she asked, her smile a perfect, dazzling crescent.\n\u201cNot too bad,\u201d he lied, the words tasting like ash in his mouth. His own smile felt like a poorly fitting mask.\n\u201cBrilliant. We\u2019ve got you scheduled for a sound check and camera rehearsal in thirty minutes on the main stage. Just to get you comfortable with the space. Feeling good? You look a bit pale.\u201d\n\u201cJust the drive,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m fine. Ready to go.\u201d\n\nThe stage was bigger and more terrifying than it looked on television. It was a vast, dark cavern, dominated by a galaxy of lights suspended from a grid high above. Screens the size of houses flanked the performance area, currently displaying a generic, swirling blue pattern. Technicians in black t-shirts scurried about, speaking a clipped, technical language he didn\u2019t understand, their headsets glowing with small red lights. It was a factory for dreams, and he was just one small, trembling component on the assembly line. He thought of Mrs Gable, patting his hand. He thought of the collection from the staff at The Gilded Fork, the wad of fifties tucked in his jacket. He thought of his mother\u2019s voice, small and wounded, over the phone. He had to do this for them. He had to make it mean something.\n\nHe was led to a chalk mark on the floor, an \u2018X\u2019 that felt unnervingly like the target in a shooting gallery. A disembodied voice from the darkness asked him to sing a few bars, just for a level check. He opened his mouth, and for a terrifying second, nothing came out. His throat was tight, his lungs empty. Panic, cold and sharp, seized him. Then he thought of the song he had chosen. \u2018Calon L\u00e2n\u2019. A Pure Heart. The irony was so bitter, so profound, it almost made him laugh. What would his mother, who had taught him the hymn, think of him singing it now, with a heart so heavy with deceit? And in that moment, the song transformed. It was no longer a simple plea for a pure heart. It was an apology. A confession. A prayer for forgiveness sent across the miles. He took a breath, closed his eyes, and sang.\n\nThe voice that filled the empty auditorium was not the one he had practiced in his living room. That voice had been hopeful, ambitious. This was something else entirely. It was saturated with a sorrow so deep and a longing so raw that it seemed to vibrate in the very air around him. He sang of a pure heart, full of goodness, fairer than the lily white, but his voice carried the weight of the impure heart he now possessed, the one that had chosen a painful lie over a terrible truth. He wasn't performing; he was unburdening himself. As the final, mournful notes of the Welsh melody faded into the vast darkness of the studio, a profound silence descended. The scurrying technicians had stopped. The disembodied voice was quiet. For a moment, the only sound was the frantic, guilty beating of his own heart.\n\nThen Chloe\u2019s voice, softer now, cut through the quiet. \u201cArthur\u2026 that was\u2026 my God.\u201d She walked towards him from the wings, her usual slick confidence replaced by a look of genuine awe. \u201cThat\u2019s it. That\u2019s the performance. The emotion in that\u2026 it\u2019s a guaranteed win.\u201d She didn't understand. She saw powerful art, a masterful interpretation. She couldn\u2019t see the jagged pieces of the morning's bargain that he had just stitched together into a song. He felt a wave of dizziness, the disconnect between her reality and his own making the world tilt on its axis. He had turned his private, gut-wrenching grief into a product, a commodity to be sold to fifteen million people. The thought made him feel sick to his stomach.\n\nThe rest of the afternoon passed in a blur of interviews, costume fittings, and more instructions. He was moved from room to room, a polite, quiet puppet whose strings were being pulled by a dozen different people. He met the other finalists, a fresh-faced girl band and a street-dance troupe whose youthful energy seemed to suck the very air from the room. They were buzzing with an uncomplicated excitement, their families flanking them, laughing and taking photos. Arthur watched them from a distance, an island of solitude in a sea of celebration. He felt a hundred years older than all of them. When he was finally given the key to his hotel room late in the evening, the simple act of closing the door and being alone felt like a gasp of air after being held underwater. The room was sterile and impersonal, but the silence was a balm. He sank onto the edge of the king-sized bed, his suit carrier still in his hand, a soldier who had survived the battle, only to find the war had moved inside him."

The suit remained in its carrier, a dark spectre hanging on the wardrobe door, and his overnight bag sat by the bed like a patient, neglected dog. The hotel room, with its anonymous beige walls and bland corporate art, offered no comfort, only a deeper sense of displacement. He tried to watch television, flicking through channels of shouting quiz shows and slick dramas, but the bright, flickering images were an assault. They belonged to a world of casual entertainment, a world he no longer felt a part of. He turned it off, and the silence rushed back in, thick with the low hum of the city and the even lower hum of his own disquiet. He was a hundred and eighty miles from home, but he had never felt so far away.\n\nPulling the glittery card from his jacket, he opened it on the desk. The scrawled messages of support from his colleagues at The Gilded Fork swam before his eyes. \u2018Go get \u2018em, Arthur!\u2019, \u2018You\u2019ve got this!\u2019, \u2018Smash it\u2019. Honest, simple words of encouragement that now felt like accusations. They believed in \u2018Lancaster\u2019s Lark\u2019, the humble waiter with the golden voice. They didn\u2019t know he was a liar, a man who had manipulated his own mother\u2019s love out of a terror he couldn't even prove was real. The wad of cash Mr Henderson had given him was still tucked inside. He laid the notes out on the polished desk, a small fortune that felt like blood money. He had to call her. He couldn\u2019t bear the thought of her sitting in her bungalow, her new hat in its box, her heart aching with a disappointment he had so selfishly inflicted.\n\nHis finger trembled as he dialled. She answered on the second ring, her voice quieter than it had been that morning.\n\u201cArthur?\u201d\n\u201cMam. It\u2019s me. I\u2019m at the hotel.\u201d\n\u201cOh, good. It\u2019s a nice one, is it? You get yourself some room service. Don\u2019t you go hungry.\u201d The familiar fussing was there, but it was strained, a habit performed without its usual warmth.\n\u201cMam, I\u2019m so sorry,\u201d he whispered, the words catching in his throat. \u201cAbout today. About asking you not to come. It was a cruel thing to do.\u201d\nHe heard her take a long, slow breath. \u201cNo, love. It wasn\u2019t cruel. It was\u2026 strange. But you were frightened. I could hear it in your voice. I\u2019ve never heard you sound like that before.\u201d\n\u201cI just\u2026 I had this feeling. This awful, certain feeling.\u201d\n\u201cI know,\u201d she said softly, and in those two words, he heard not judgement, but a deep, maternal acceptance that was more shattering than any anger could have been. \u201cA mother knows. I knew something was wrong. I\u2019m just glad you\u2019re alright. That\u2019s all that matters. Your sister\u2019s here with me now. We\u2019re going to get a curry in and watch you on the big telly. We\u2019ll be screaming so loud you\u2019ll probably hear us in London.\u201d\nThe image of them, safe in Lancaster, a takeaway carton on the coffee table, was so potent it brought tears to his eyes. It was an image of normal life, the life he had so callously disrupted. He had protected that life, but he had also placed himself outside of it.\n\u201cI love you, Mam.\u201d\n\u201cI love you too, my Arthur. Now stop your worrying. You\u2019ve got a big day tomorrow. You get some sleep, and you go out there and you sing that beautiful song. You sing it for your old mam, alright?\u201d\n\u201cAlright, Mam,\u201d he promised, his voice thick with unshed tears. \u201cFor you.\u201d\n\nHe slept, but it was a thin, fitful sleep, more a series of brief, anxious blackouts than a period of rest. He woke long before the dawn, the grey light of a London morning seeping through a gap in the curtains. Saturday. The day of the final. The knot of dread in his stomach had been joined by a strange, cold sense of purpose. The performance was no longer about winning. It was about fulfilling his promise to his mother. It was the only act of penance he could offer. He showered and dressed in his suit, the fabric feeling stiff and unfamiliar. Looking in the mirror, he saw a stranger. The face was his, but the eyes were haunted, carrying the weight of the last twenty-four hours. He was Arthur Penhaligon, the waiter, dressed in the costume of a star, about to go on stage and sing a hymn about a pure heart he no longer believed he possessed.\n\nThe studio was a hive of frantic, joyous energy that felt utterly alien. Dancers stretched in corridors, singers warmed up their voices in dressing rooms, and families gathered in clutches, their faces shining with pride and excitement. Arthur moved through it all like a ghost, his polite nods and quiet smiles a fragile shield against the overwhelming atmosphere. Chloe found him by the catering table, where he was staring into a cup of coffee he had no intention of drinking.\n\u201cThe man of the hour!\u201d she chirped, her energy relentless. \u201cHow are we feeling? You were a different man in rehearsal yesterday. Found another gear. If you can bring just half of that to the stage tonight, you\u2019ll walk this.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll do my best,\u201d Arthur said, the phrase a hollow echo of his mother\u2019s words.\nHe spent the hours before the live show in his designated dressing room, a small, windowless box with a mirror framed in bare lightbulbs. He didn\u2019t practice. He didn\u2019t pace. He just sat, the silence of the room a temporary refuge from the chaos outside and the storm within. He thought of his route home from The Gilded Fork, the earthy smell of the canal, the quiet click of his own front door. He thought of the folded serviette, the first casualty of an evening that now seemed a lifetime ago. He was a constellation of tiny, rehearsed movements, but the man he had been, the man who tried to be invisible, was gone forever. In his place was this new, terrified creature, about to be seen by millions.\n\nWhen the call came, he walked to the stage on legs that felt disconnected from his body. The roar of the live audience was a physical force, a wave of heat and sound that washed over him as he stepped into the lights. He found his chalk mark, the familiar \u2018X\u2019 on the vast, dark floor. He could see the judges at their desk, their faces lit from below, looking like pagan gods about to pass judgement. The host gave him a thumbs-up and a blinding smile. Fifteen million people. His mother and his sister, with their curry. Mrs Gable. Mr Henderson. Ben. All of Lancaster. He took a deep breath, the air thick with the artificial scent of dry-ice smoke. The opening chords of \u2018Calon L\u00e2n\u2019 began, soft and simple on the piano. He found the camera with the glowing red light, the one that looked directly into the homes of the nation. He looked into its dark, unblinking lens, and he sang.\n\nHe sang not to the judges, not to the roaring crowd, but to the small living room on the terraced street by the canal. Every note was an apology. Every soaring phrase was a plea for forgiveness. He poured all the fear of the last three days, the sickening premonition on the motorway, the lie he had told his mother, the profound guilt that now defined him, into the melody. He sang of the pure heart he longed for, and the sound that emerged was one of heartbreaking, desolate beauty. It was the sound of a man who had glimpsed his soul\u2019s desire only to find he had to trade a piece of his soul to get there. As the final, whispered note hung in the air, the studio was utterly silent. No one coughed. No one cheered. The nation held its breath. Then, the silence was shattered by an explosion of applause, a roar so thunderous it seemed to shake the very foundations of the building. Arthur stood, unmoving, tears he hadn't realised he was crying now tracing hot tracks down his cheeks.\n\nThe host\u2019s arm was around his shoulder, the judges were on their feet, their faces a mixture of shock and reverence. The praise they showered on him was a meaningless babble of superlatives. \u201cTranscendent.\u201d \u201cA moment of television history.\u201d \u201cThe performance of a lifetime.\u201d He just nodded, his eyes fixed on that dark camera lens, his heart pounding a frantic, exhausted rhythm. The voting lines closed. He stood between the giggling girl band and the hyper-masculine dance troupe as the tension was drawn out to its breaking point. He felt nothing. He was hollowed out, an empty vessel waiting for a verdict he no longer cared about.\n\u201cAnd the winner,\u201d the host bellowed, his voice reaching a crescendo, \u201cthe winner of a recording contract and two hundred and fifty thousand pounds\u2026 is\u2026 ARTHUR PENHALIGON!\u201d\nConfetti cannons exploded, showering him in a blizzard of shimmering gold and silver paper, just as he had once imagined. The roar of the crowd was deafening. The girl band hugged him, the dancers clapped him on the back. A heavy, ornate trophy was thrust into his hands. He was surrounded by celebration, bathed in the warmth of a thousand stage lights, his dream made real in the most spectacular way possible. And as he lifted the trophy, forcing a smile for the cameras, one thought echoed in the silent, empty chamber of his heart. I wish I had used a coaster. He felt a strange, unseasonable shiver, a sudden, deep cold that had nothing to do with the temperature. The victory was his. But the joy was a hundred and eighty miles north, sitting in a small bungalow, watching a different show entirely."

He was passed from the host\u2019s embrace to a frantic floor manager, then into a scrum of reporters whose flashing cameras were like bursts of shrapnel in the dazzling air.

He answered with a series of nods and mumbled phrases that seemed to satisfy them, his mind a perfect, humming blank. He felt the heavy trophy in his hands, its cold, engraved metal the only thing that felt real. It was an anchor in a sea of unreality, and it was dragging him down.\n\nChloe finally materialised, cleaving a path through the media throng like a sharp-prowed ship. She grabbed his arm, her grip surprisingly strong, her smile somehow even wider and more brilliant than before. \u201cThere you are! We\u2019re losing you to the press already! Come on, we\u2019ve got a champagne reception in the green room. The head of the label wants to meet you. Arthur, do you have any idea what you\u2019ve just done?\u201d she said, her voice a giddy torrent as she steered him down a brightly lit corridor. He looked at her, at the pure, uncomplicated triumph in her eyes, and felt a pang of something like envy. For her, this was a simple, glorious victory. For him, it was a complex and terrible equation that he was no closer to solving.\n\nThe green room was even louder and more crowded than the stage had been. Music throbbed from hidden speakers, and the air was thick with the scent of champagne and expensive ambition. Faces he recognised from television and magazines turned to him, their smiles ready, their hands outstretched. He was the commodity of the hour. He shook hands, accepted congratulations, and allowed a glass of fizz to be pressed into his palm. He held it, watching the tiny bubbles race to the surface, and thought of the G&T glass and the wilting serviette. That felt like a hundred years ago, a scene from someone else's life. He was introduced to a man in a razor-sharp suit, the fabled head of Syco, who clapped him on the shoulder and spoke of albums and global markets. The words washed over Arthur, meaningless as the tide.\n\nHe needed to call his mother. The need was a physical ache, a sharp point of focus in the swirling chaos. Excusing himself with a muttered apology, he found a quieter corner by a vending machine that sold only water and protein bars. He leaned against the cool glass, the thumping bass from the party a dull, rhythmic punch in his back. He pulled out his phone, the cracked screen seeming like an artefact from a lost civilisation. His hands were shaking again. He pressed her number, and the world narrowed to the small device in his hand. She answered instantly, her voice a shriek of pure, unadulterated joy.\n\u201cARTHUR! YOU DID IT! OH, MY BOY, YOU DID IT! We were screaming, the whole street could hear us! Oh, the neighbours are banging on the walls! I don\u2019t even care! My boy! My beautiful, beautiful boy!\u201d\n\nHe closed his eyes, leaning his head back against the machine. Her happiness was a sun so bright it burned him. He had to shield himself from it, and he had to reflect it back at her. \u201cWe did it, Mam,\u201d he said, forcing a lightness into his voice that felt like a physical strain. \u201cI told you I\u2019d do it for you.\u201d\n\u201cOh, love. You did it for you! I\u2019ve never been so proud in all my life. Never. Your sister is in floods of tears. Happy tears, mind. Just\u2026 oh, Arthur. That song. It was like you were singing just to me. It broke my heart and put it back together again all at once.\u201d\nThe knot in his stomach tightened into a cold, hard stone. She was right. He had been singing just to her. He had been confessing his sins in a language only his heart understood, and she had heard it as a love song. The chasm between his truth and her perception was vast and dark, and he was stranded on one side, utterly alone. He listened to her talk, her words tumbling over one another in a rush of pride and plans for a welcome-home party. He made the right noises, laughed in the right places, and felt a part of himself curdle and die with every fake expression of joy. When he finally ended the call, the silence he was left with was more profound than any he had ever known.\n\nHe couldn't go back to the party. He couldn't bear another smile, another handshake, another syllable of praise for the performance that had cost him so much. He found a side exit, a plain fire door that opened into a cool, dark alleyway smelling of damp bins and rain. The sudden quiet was a mercy. He stood there for a long time, breathing in the grubby London air, the trophy still clutched in one hand. He was the winner. He had a recording contract and a quarter of a million pounds to his name. He was Lancaster\u2019s Lark, and he had never felt more like a common crow, perched on a wire, watching a world he could no longer join. A taxi slowed as it passed the end of the alley, its orange light a beacon. Without a second thought, he raised his hand.\n\nThe journey back to the hotel was a silent film played outside the cab window. The city lights smeared into long, watercolour streaks, a beautiful, abstract painting of a life he had no part in. The driver, sensing his passenger\u2019s mood, left the radio off. In the quiet, Arthur looked down at the trophy sitting on the seat beside him. It was a stylised figure, reaching for a star. It was gaudy and magnificent and unbearably heavy. He arrived at the hotel and walked through the hushed, empty lobby, the night porter giving him a curious, respectful nod. Inside his room, he didn't turn on the main lights. He placed the trophy on the desk, its polished gold catching the low lamplight. Then he took the wad of cash from his suit pocket and laid it carefully beside the gleaming statue. The collection from his colleagues. The prize money. The two sat side by side, symbols of a beginning and an end, though he wasn't sure which was which. He was free of The Gilded Fork, but he was now bound to something far larger and more terrifying."

                                        "text": "Chapter 4\n\nSleep had not come, only a grey truce with consciousness that fractured just before sunrise. Arthur found himself staring at the ceiling, tracing the faint water stain in the corner that looked like a map of a country he would never visit. The previous night\u2019s adrenaline had evaporated, leaving behind a residue of profound exhaustion and a clarity that was worse than the chaos. He was a winner. The thought didn't land with a triumphant crash but with the soft, dull thud of a sandbag. He turned his head. The trophy sat on the desk, a sentinel in the gloom, seeming to absorb all the light in the room and give nothing back. It was a monument to a lie.\n\nHis mobile phone, lying beside it, began to vibrate. The noise was aggressive, insistent, a trapped, angry insect against the polished wood. He knew who it would be. Chloe, or someone from her world of schedules and opportunities. He let it buzz, the sound a physical manifestation of the new life that was already clawing at his door, demanding entry. When it stopped, a profound silence descended, only to be shattered moments later as it began again. With a sigh that seemed to drain him of his last reserve of energy, he reached for it. The screen glowed with her name.\n\n\u201cArthur! Morning, superstar! Hope you slept well, you\u2019ve earned it!\u201d Chloe\u2019s voice was pure, undiluted caffeine. \u201cListen, big day. We\u2019ve got a car coming for you in an hour. First up is a breakfast spot on national telly, then a radio blitz, and the label wants to have a preliminary chat about producers this afternoon. We\u2019re striking while the iron is hot, Arthur. This is your moment!\u201d\n\nArthur looked from the trophy to the window, where the sky over London was the colour of dishwater. He thought of his small, cold house, the dripping tap he\u2019d finally silenced, the familiar, worn springs of his armchair. He thought of his mother\u2019s face, not the ecstatic vision from the television screen, but the hurt and confused one he imagined from their phone call on the motorway. A car in an hour. Producers. A radio blitz. It all sounded like a language he had once dreamed of learning but now found he had no aptitude for.\n\n\u201cChloe,\u201d he said, his voice husky with disuse. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d\nThere was a short, sharp silence on the other end. \u201cCan\u2019t? Arthur, this isn\u2019t really optional. This is the launch. This is what you won.\u201d\n\u201cI have to go home,\u201d he said. It wasn\u2019t a request or an excuse; it was a simple statement of fact, as unchangeable as gravity. \u201cI need to go back to Lancaster.\u201d\n\u201cLancaster?\u201d she repeated, the name of his home city sounding like a remote, incomprehensible outpost. \u201cArthur, you\u2019re the hottest property in the country right now. Lancaster can wait. Your life is here now.\u201d\n\u201cMy mother is in Lancaster,\u201d he said, the words a shield and a weapon. \u201cI\u2019m going home.\u201d\n\nHe could almost hear the calculations whirring in her head, the recalibration of strategy. The story of the devoted son was a good one. It was marketable. He could feel her shifting gears. \u201cOkay,\u201d she said, her voice softening, taking on a tone of conspiratorial understanding. \u201cOkay, I get it. Family first. Of course. But just for the day. You drive up, you see your mum, you get your hero\u2019s welcome, and you\u2019re back here Monday morning, nine a.m. sharp. We\u2019ll have a car waiting for you in Lancaster. I\u2019ll make the arrangements. Can you do that for me, Arthur?\u201d\n\nHe agreed, the compromise a small price to pay for escape. After he hung up, he moved with a new sense of purpose. He packed his bag, folded his suit, and carefully wrapped the heavy trophy in a hotel towel before placing it in a laundry bag, hiding its damning gleam. He checked out of the hotel, the receptionist\u2019s star-struck congratulations barely registering. He walked back to the underground car park, back to the one piece of his old life that had made the journey with him. The poppy-red Fiesta looked smaller and more tired than ever, a humble vessel for a king returning in secret. He placed the shrouded trophy on the passenger seat, where it sat like a slumped, silent figure.\n\nThe drive north was the inverse of the journey down. The M6 was no longer a ribbon of terror but a long, monotonous path of penance. The fear was gone, replaced by a dull, persistent ache in the centre of his chest. He turned on the radio, scanning the news bulletins, a grim part of him still searching for a justification for his actions. He listened for reports of accidents, of pile-ups, of anything that might lend substance to the phantom premonition that had ruled him. There was nothing. Just the usual litany of traffic updates, political squabbles, and a story about a prize-winning marrow. The absence of disaster was its own kind of condemnation. He hadn\u2019t averted a tragedy; he had just given in to a fit of madness. The thought was colder and more isolating than any fear had been.\n\nAs the miles dissolved and the familiar, rugged hills of the north began to rise in the distance, his anxiety took on a new shape. It was no longer about what might happen, but about what had. He was driving towards a celebration he didn\u2019t deserve, to accept the praise of a town he had deceived. When he took the exit for Lancaster, his hands were slick on the steering wheel. The city felt different, or perhaps he was the one who was irrevocably changed. As he drove through the outskirts, he saw it. A bedsheet, strung between two lampposts outside a pub. On it, in clumsily painted letters of red and black, were the words: \u2018CONGRATULATIONS ARTHUR! LANCASTER\u2019S LARK SINGS FOR US ALL!\u2019 He had to pull over for a moment, the sight of it making him feel physically ill. It was a banner celebrating a man who didn't exist.\n\nHis own street was unrecognizable. Bunting, the kind usually reserved for a royal wedding, was strung from window to window. Cars were parked haphazardly on the pavement. A small crowd was gathered on the pavement outside his house. They were his neighbours, people he had exchanged polite nods with for a decade. Now they were holding mugs of tea and craning their necks, a makeshift receiving line. And at the centre of it all, standing on the top step by his peeling brown front door, was his mother. She was wearing her peacock-blue hat. She had put it on just for him. As he turned the corner in his little red car, a cheer went up. It was a ragged, heartfelt sound that struck him with the force of a physical blow. He brought the car to a halt and killed the engine. For a long, silent moment, he couldn\u2019t move. He couldn\u2019t breathe. This was it. The moment of reckoning. He had to get out of the car and walk into their pride, into their joy, and pretend it was his own. He had to face the woman in the peacock-blue hat, whose heart he had broken and then filled with a false, shining happiness. He opened the car door, and stepped out into the noise."

He stood frozen by the open door of the Fiesta, a fixed, brittle smile cracking on his face. His name was being called from a dozen different mouths, a name that suddenly felt like a title, a role he was required to play. Hands patted his back, clutched his arm. Mr Egan from number 12, a man he\u2019d only ever shared terse nods with over the garden fence, was grinning at him, his eyes suspiciously bright. The woman from the bakery was there, holding out a plate of Eccles cakes like an offering. It was a carnival of goodwill, and he was the unwilling main attraction, a man being celebrated for surviving a shipwreck of his own making.\n\nThrough the shifting sea of faces, he saw her. His mother, Elsie, making her way towards him, a small, determined figure parting the crowd. The peacock-blue hat was perched perfectly, a defiant splash of colour against the grey Lancaster sky. It was the hat she had bought for a journey she never made, a journey he had forbidden. Now, repurposed for this moment of victory, it seemed not a symbol of her pride, but an emblem of his deceit. As she reached him, her face, a delicate roadmap of her life, was alight with a joy so pure it was painful to look at. She threw her arms around his neck, and he hugged her back, burying his face in her shoulder, breathing in the familiar scent of lavender polish and Earl Grey tea. He felt the slight tremor in her hands as she held him. \"Oh, my boy,\" she whispered, her voice choked with emotion, audible only to him. \"You\u2019re home. You\u2019re finally home.\" The simple words were both a benediction and a curse, and he held on tighter, a drowning man clinging to the source of his own storm.\n\nThe momentum of the crowd was irresistible, a gentle but firm tide that propelled him out of the street and into his own house. His sister, Sarah, was waiting just inside the door, her face red and swollen from crying. She crushed him in a hug, sobbing and laughing at the same time. \"I can't believe it, Art! I just can't believe it's you!\" His small hallway, usually a space of quiet passage, was crammed with neighbours, their coats piled on the newel post. The house was alive, thrumming with a boisterous energy it had never known. He felt a profound sense of dislocation, as if he had walked into the correct address but the wrong life. Everything was the same\u2014the worn patch on the carpet by the door, the framed print of Morecambe Bay hanging slightly askew\u2014but it was all re-contextualized, the set of a play in which he no longer knew his lines.\n\n\"Right then, where is it?\" a voice boomed. It was his brother-in-law, Dave, a man whose presence filled any room. \"The main event! Let\u2019s have a look at the trophy!\" A murmur of agreement went through the assembled party. All eyes turned to Arthur. His hands were empty. He had left it in the car, shrouded in its cheap hotel towel, a guilty secret on the passenger seat. The thought of bringing it into this house, into this celebration, made his stomach clench. But there was no escape. \"It's in the car,\" he said, his voice sounding thin and distant to his own ears. \"I'll go and get it.\" The short walk back down the garden path was a strange reprieve. For a few seconds, he was alone, the front door closing behind him, muffling the joyful chatter. He opened the car door and looked at the lumpy shape on the seat. It felt heavier now, weighted with the expectation of the people inside.\n\nHe walked back into the living room holding the graceless bundle. The conversations stopped. A space was cleared for him on the sofa next to his mother, an expectant hush falling over the room. He felt like a magician about to perform a trick he hadn't rehearsed. Slowly, deliberately, he placed the bag on the coffee table and peeled back the thin, worn towel. The studio lights had made the trophy seem magnificent, but here, in the gentle light of his own living room, it looked almost vulgar. It was too big, too shiny, an ostentatious piece of gilded metal that didn't belong amongst the familiar clutter of his life. A collective gasp went through the room, a sound of pure awe. \"Oh, Arthur,\" his mother breathed, her hand going to her mouth. \"It's real.\" He was forced to pick it up, to pass it around, each person who touched it imbuing it with more significance, more power. He watched it move from hand to hand, a holy relic being venerated by a congregation of the faithful, and he, the high priest, was the only one who knew it was a fake.\n\nEventually, he was allowed to sink into his own worn armchair, the springs groaning a familiar welcome. The trophy had been given the place of honour on the mantelpiece, where it dwarfed his mother's collection of ceramic birds. A mug of tea, strong and sweet just the way he liked it, was pressed into his hands. The room buzzed around him, a kaleidoscope of happy, familiar faces. His sister was recounting the moment his name was announced, acting it out with wild gestures. Dave was explaining to Mr Egan how he\u2019d always known Arthur had it in him. His mother just sat on the sofa, her gaze fixed on him, her smile a constant, unwavering beacon of pride. He was the centre of their universe, the quiet man who had roared. He smiled, he nodded, he answered questions about the judges and the after-party, and with every word, he felt a piece of himself calcify. He had returned to his sanctuary, only to find it had become his stage, and this performance was the most difficult of his life. He caught his own reflection in the dark, blank screen of the television opposite. He saw a man in a rumpled suit, holding a mug of tea, a faint, polite smile on his face. He looked like a stranger at his own victory party."

                                        "text": "Dave clapped him on the shoulder, jolting him from his reverie. His brother-in-law\u2019s face was ruddy with excitement and probably a few celebratory cans he\u2019d had while waiting. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what, mate, you saved me a job! Five hours down the M6, I\u2019d have been chewing my own arm off. Elsie was gutted, mind. But you were right, looking back. Saturday traffic, it would have been murder. We\u2019d probably still be stuck in a jam outside Birmingham!\u201d He laughed, a loud, booming sound that filled the small room. Arthur felt a cold lurch in his gut. There it was, the phantom journey, spoken of so casually, so blithely. Dave\u2019s words, meant to be a simple jest, were a series of hammer blows against the fragile wall of his composure. He managed a weak smile, the muscles in his face screaming in protest. \"Probably for the best,\" he heard himself say, the words tasting like poison.\n\nThe afternoon wore on in a series of similar, painful vignettes. He was an actor in an endless improvisation, his only props a teacup and a weary smile. He listened to theories about his future career, accepted advice on how to invest his prize money, and nodded as people reminisced about his first solo in the school choir. Each well-meaning comment, each expression of vicarious joy, felt like another layer of earth being shovelled onto the man he used to be. The noise was constant, a cheerful, suffocating blanket of sound that left no room for his own thoughts. At one point, seeking refuge, he offered to make another pot of tea and escaped into the tiny kitchen. He stood for a moment with his back to the door, one hand braced on the cool formica, just breathing. The familiar drip from the tap was gone, and he felt a pang of loss for the imperfect, quiet life he had so thoroughly obliterated.\n\nBy late afternoon, the crowd began to thin. Neighbours, with final handshakes and promises to \"keep an eye on the house when you're a big star,\" drifted back to their own homes. The front door, which had been perpetually open, was finally closed, and the sudden drop in volume was startling. The living room, which had felt impossibly full, now seemed vast and empty, littered with the evidence of a party: empty mugs, a plate of half-eaten cakes, a stray paper napkin. Only his mother, his sister, and Dave remained. The boisterous energy of the celebration dissipated, leaving behind something quieter, more intense, and infinitely more difficult to navigate. The performance was over, and now he was left with just his family, the people who knew him best, and who he was now fooling the most.\n\nSarah eventually declared she needed to get Dave home before he fell asleep in the armchair. Their departure was a flurry of final hugs and whispered instructions to his mother to make sure he ate something proper. Then, silence. Arthur stood in the hallway, listening to their car drive away, until the only sound was the low hum of his own refrigerator. He turned back to the living room. His mother was there, carefully collecting the used mugs. She hadn't put on the main light, and in the gathering dusk, she looked small and fragile. She put the mugs down and turned to him, her face etched with a love that felt like a physical weight. \"You look tired, my love,\" she said, her voice soft. \"Not happy-tired. Just\u2026 worn to the bone. That place\u2026 it took something out of you, didn't it?\" It wasn\u2019t an accusation. It was a simple, devastatingly accurate observation. He wanted to tell her everything, to confess the premonition, the lie, the crushing weight of it all. But looking at her proud, tired face, at the peacock-blue hat still perched on the hall table where she\u2019d left it, he knew he couldn\u2019t. He couldn't tarnish this for her. It was the one pure thing left.\n\n\"It was a lot, Mam,\" he said, the understatement a chasm. \"I just need a bit of sleep, that's all.\" He managed a smile he hoped was reassuring. She came to him and patted his cheek, her skin as fine and dry as parchment. \"Of course, you do. You're home now. That's all that matters. You're home.\" She kissed him on the forehead and made her slow, careful way up the stairs to the spare room he always kept ready for her. Arthur remained in the living room, a solitary figure in the twilight. He walked to the mantelpiece and stood before the trophy. In the dim light, it seemed to mock him, a garish monument to his glorious, hollow victory. He reached out and touched its cold, smooth surface. He had done it. He had won. He was home. And he was utterly, irrevocably lost."

                                        "text": "He did not move for a long time, his fingertips resting on the cold metal. The silence in the house was no longer a peaceful absence of noise, but a presence in itself, thick and judgmental. It pressed in on him, amplifying the frantic monologue in his own head. He felt an urgent, desperate need to do something normal, to perform an action from his old life that might tether him to the man he once was. He retreated to the kitchen, the scene of his earlier, brief escape, and began to gather the dirty mugs. He ran the hot water, the familiar sound of it rushing into the sink a small comfort. He submerged his hands, the heat a mild shock, and began to wash each cup with a methodical, almost frantic precision, scrubbing away the faint lipstick stains and dried tea rings left by his well-wishers. But the simple, domestic ritual brought no solace. He was merely cleaning up after a party he hadn't attended, a ghost tidying the remnants of a life that was no longer his.\n\nSleep was a country to which he had lost his passport. He didn't even try to go to his own bed, knowing the familiar confines of his room would feel like a cage. Instead, he returned to the living room and sank back into his armchair, the worn springs groaning a weary complaint. The street outside grew quiet, the last of the late-night revelers making their way home, their laughter fading into the distance. A single streetlamp cast a pale, orange rectangle of light onto the carpet, a stage on which dust motes danced in a slow, silent ballet. His gaze was drawn, again and again, to the mantelpiece. The trophy sat there, its gilded surface catching the faint light, a constant, gleaming reminder. It was the full stop at the end of the greatest sentence of his life, but the sentence itself was a lie. He thought of Dave's booming laugh, his casual dismissal of the journey. \u2018Saturday traffic, it would have been murder.\u2019 The words echoed, stripped of their jovial intent, becoming a cruel taunt. The universe hadn't offered him validation; it had offered him mockery. His grand, desperate act of love was reduced to a foolish, unnecessary panic. He hadn't saved his mother from a terrible fate; he had simply robbed her of a precious memory.\n\nThe sun rose on Sunday morning with a kind of weary reluctance, painting the sky in shades of bruised grey and tired pink. Arthur hadn't moved from the chair, and his body ached with a deep, unyielding stiffness. He heard the floorboards creak overhead, the familiar sound of his mother waking. He heard the flush of the toilet, the gentle turning of the tap. Each small, domestic noise was a turn of the screw, a reminder of the ordinary life he was now observing from behind a sheet of glass. He forced himself to his feet and went to the kitchen to put the kettle on, a pantomime of his morning routine. When Elsie came downstairs, wrapped in her old chenille dressing gown, she found him standing by the counter, staring into space.\n\"You didn't sleep a wink, did you?\" she said, her voice soft with a concern that was almost unbearable. She put her hand on his arm. \"Arthur, talk to me. What is it? Is it this London business? Are they frightening you?\"\n\"No, Mam,\" he lied, turning to her with a smile that felt like it was cracking his face. \"Just a bit overwhelmed. It's a lot to take in.\"\n\"Well, I've got just the thing,\" she announced, her tone shifting into a determined brightness, a deliberate attempt to chase away the shadows she could so clearly see in his eyes. \"I've been down to the corner shop already. The papers are full of you! Let's have a proper look, with a nice cup of tea.\"\n\nShe spread the Sunday papers out on the small dining table, and he was forced to sit opposite her and look at his own face staring back. There he was, in grainy newsprint, tears on his cheeks, trophy held aloft. 'LANCASHIRE LARK SOARS' screamed one headline. 'WAITER'S PUCCINI DREAM COMES TRUE' proclaimed another. His mother read snippets aloud, her voice filled with a giddy, childlike wonder. She pointed to a quote from a judge, a piece of praise from an anonymous 'insider', a photograph of the cheering crowd. Arthur nodded and made appreciative noises, the sound of her happiness a constant, low-level torture. He felt a desperate urge to confess, to shatter the perfect, newsprint image of her son and show her the terrified, deceitful man sitting opposite her. But the words wouldn't come. They were trapped behind the dam of his love for her, a love that now demanded this terrible, ongoing silence. He was her hero, and a hero could not have feet of clay.\n\nThat afternoon, he knew he had to escape the house. He told his mother he was going for a walk, just to get some fresh air and clear his head. The relief in her eyes was palpable; she thought it a sign of him returning to himself. He walked his old route, his feet carrying him out of instinct towards the canal path. The air was damp and cold, carrying the earthy smell of the water and the faint, distant scent of coal smoke. It was the smell of his life, of his home. Here, away from the bunting and the trophy, the world felt almost normal. He passed other walkers, people who nodded at him with a new, knowing respect. 'Well done, lad,' an old man walking a greyhound said, tipping his cap. Arthur mumbled his thanks, his eyes fixed on the muddy path. He was no longer Arthur Penhaligon; he was a public monument, a landmark to be acknowledged. His anonymity, the invisibility he had cultivated for a decade, was gone forever. It had been the price of his ticket, a cost he hadn't understood until it was paid.\n\nHe stopped by a lock, leaning his arms on the cold, damp stone of the bridge, and stared down into the murky, green water. He thought of the phone call that was coming. Chloe\u2019s voice. A car in the morning. He had a choice. He could pick up the phone and tell her he wasn't coming back. He could tell them to keep the money, to tear up the contract. He could try to disappear back into the quiet life he had left behind, to become the waiter again, to live with the whispers and the pitying looks and the eternal question of 'what if'. He could do that. He could reclaim some small, broken piece of his soul. But what would it do to his mother? Her pride was so fierce, so absolute. To see it all turn to dust, to see her son become a local cautionary tale\u2014it would break her. He had already broken her heart once with his fear; he couldn't break it again with his failure. The choice was a brutal one, but it wasn't really a choice at all. He had to protect her happiness, the very happiness he had so expertly, so cruelly, manufactured. That was his penance now.\n\nWhen he returned to the house, the decision had settled in him, a cold, heavy weight in his gut. His mother was in the living room, carefully placing the newspaper clippings into a scrapbook. She looked up as he entered, her face hopeful.\n\"Feeling better for the fresh air?\" she asked.\nHe nodded, forcing a smile that felt more genuine than any he had managed all weekend. It was the smile of a man who had accepted his sentence. \"Much better, Mam. It cleared my head.\" He walked over to her and kissed the top of her head. \"I've been thinking. I need to pack. The car is coming for me in the morning.\"\nThe relief that flooded her face was his reward and his punishment. \"Oh, good,\" she said, her hands fluttering over the scrapbook. \"That's good, love. You can't let an opportunity like this slip away. This is your time.\"\nThat night, he went to his own room and took out his small overnight bag. He packed his shirt, his toothbrush, the few things he would need for the start of his new life. The movements were automatic, detached. He was preparing not for an adventure, but for a long, arduous tour of duty. Before he closed the bag, he went back downstairs. The house was quiet, his mother already in bed. He stood in the living room doorway and looked at the trophy on the mantelpiece. It stood there, impassive, a golden idol demanding its sacrifice. He had won. He had his mother's pride, a recording contract, a fortune he couldn't comprehend, and a future brighter than he had ever dared to imagine. He had everything he had ever wanted. He just had to leave himself behind to get it."

                                        "text": "They sat together in the living room that evening, watching the television. A cheerful quiz show filled the screen, the theme tune jarringly upbeat, the contestants\u2019 laughter echoing in the quiet room. His mother was engrossed, occasionally making a comment about a contestant\u2019s questionable choice of haircut or a particularly easy question they had missed. It was a ritual they had shared hundreds of times, a comfortable, unassuming way to pass an evening. But for Arthur, it was an out-of-body experience. He felt as if he were watching not just the television, but the entire scene from a great height: the two figures on the worn sofa, the flickering blue light, the hulking golden trophy on the mantelpiece keeping its silent, glittering vigil. He was no longer a participant. He was a spectator at the wake of his own quiet life.\n\n\u201cOh, she\u2019s a clever one, that one,\u201d his mother murmured, pointing a finger at a young woman on the screen who had just answered a question about astrophysics. \u201cYou\u2019ll be meeting all sorts of clever people now, I expect. People from all over.\u201d She turned to him, her eyes shining with the reflected light of the screen. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to remember to tell me all about them. Don\u2019t you go thinking your old mam won\u2019t be interested in your new London friends.\u201d Her words were full of innocent excitement for a future she imagined was all bright lights and fascinating company. She couldn\u2019t see the shadows that future cast, the sharp-suited men and women who didn't see him, but a product to be shaped and sold. He just smiled and squeezed her hand. \"I'll tell you everything, Mam. I promise.\" It was another lie, a small, necessary brick in the wall he was building around her.\n\nLater, as she prepared to go up to bed, she fussed over him one last time. She straightened the collar of his shirt, a gesture she had been making since he was a small boy in a school uniform. \"You make sure you eat properly down there, Arthur. They all look like they live on air and water on the telly. You need to keep your strength up.\" Her hands were gentle, her concern a familiar, comforting weight. \"And don't let them change you too much, love. You're my Arthur. That's what people voted for. Just you.\" The simple sincerity of her words was a knife twisting in his gut. The man she believed in, the man she was instructing him to be, was the very man he was being forced to abandon. He was a walking paradox, a man whose authenticity was now his greatest performance.\n\nHe lay awake for hours in his own bed that night, the sheets cool against his skin. He listened to the familiar sounds of the house settling, the creak of a floorboard, the distant sigh of the water pipes. This was the last time he would hear this particular symphony of quiet. From tomorrow, his world would be one of studio hums, ringing telephones, and the roar of crowds. He thought of the man he was only a week ago, the waiter whose greatest ambition was a flawlessly folded serviette and a smoothly run evening service. That man had dreamed of singing, but his dreams had been soft-focus fantasies, comforting and contained. He had never imagined the brutal reality of a dream made manifest, the way it could scour you clean of everything you were, leaving a polished, hollow shell behind. The victory had not freed him; it had imprisoned him in a gilded cage.\n\nThe car arrived at precisely nine a.m. It was a sleek, black saloon, its dark, tinted windows reflecting a distorted image of his terraced street. It seemed to suck all the colour from its surroundings, an alien craft that had landed from another, more serious world. Its driver, a young man in a dark suit, didn't get out, but simply sent a polite text: \u2018Your car is outside.\u2019 Arthur looked at his old Fiesta parked further down the road, its poppy-red paintwork looking cheerful and almost comically outmatched. It was his past, humble and slightly battered. The black car was his future, silent, impersonal, and waiting. His mother stood with him at the front door, her hands clutching her dressing gown tightly. She had refused to get properly dressed, as if admitting it was a normal day would make his departure too final.\n\nHe placed his bag in the boot, the driver assisting with a practiced, unobtrusive efficiency. The moment he could no longer delay had arrived. He turned back to his mother, who stood framed in the doorway of the house that had been his entire world. Her eyes were bright with unshed tears, but her smile was resolute. \"You be good, now,\" she said, her voice catching slightly. \"And you phone me. You phone me the minute you get there.\" He wrapped her in his arms, a fierce, desperate hug that was both a goodbye and an apology. He breathed in her scent one last time, trying to commit it to memory, a talisman against the sterile, air-conditioned world he was about to enter. \"I love you, Mam,\" he whispered into her hair. \"More than anything.\" He pulled away before she could see the truth in his eyes. He walked to the waiting car without looking back, opened the heavy door, and slid onto the cool leather of the back seat. As the car pulled away from the curb with a smooth, silent acceleration, he finally allowed himself a glance in the side mirror. He saw his house shrinking, his mother a small, solitary figure on the step, waving until he turned the corner and she was gone. The journey south had begun again, but this time, he knew exactly what it would cost him."

                                        "text": "### Chapter 6\n\nThe black saloon moved through the landscape with an imperious smoothness that absorbed all the imperfections of the road. Arthur sat perfectly still in the back, a passenger in his own life, watching the familiar towns and service stations of the M6 glide past the tinted window. This journey was different from the two that had preceded it. It was not fuelled by a panicked terror or a grim sense of penance. This was a journey of capitulation. He was no longer driving; he was being delivered, a parcel sent from his old life to his new one. The driver, a young man with a discreet earpiece and eyes that never left the road, had not spoken a word since their initial, polite greeting. The silence in the car was absolute, a manufactured, hermetic quiet that was a universe away from the companionable silence of his own home. He felt the vibration of his phone in his pocket and knew, with a weary certainty, what was required of him. He pulled it out and dialled his mother\u2019s number. \u201cI\u2019m on the motorway, Mam,\u201d he said, his voice even and calm. \u201cJust past Birmingham. The traffic\u2019s not too bad. Yes, I\u2019ll call you as soon as I get to the studio. I love you, too.\u201d He ended the call and placed the phone back in his pocket, the lie now practiced, easy, and all the more damning for it.\n\nTheir destination was not the same sprawling studio complex he had entered as a contestant. The car bypassed the main public entrance and swept down a ramp into a private underground garage, coming to a halt in a bay marked \u2018GUEST 1\u2019. The driver was out in an instant, opening the door for him, a gesture of deference that felt utterly alien. As Arthur stepped out, Chloe emerged from a doorway, her smile a beacon in the concrete gloom. She was flanked by a tall, severe-looking woman with a clipboard and a young man who seemed to vibrate with nervous energy. There was no contestant\u2019s lanyard for him this time, no waiting in line. He was an asset, and he was being moved through a different, more exclusive set of corridors, the polished floors reflecting his tired face back at him. \u201cArthur, brilliant time,\u201d Chloe said, falling into step beside him. \u201cThis is Janice, she\u2019s your publicist, and this is Leo, my new assistant. Leo\u2019s going to be your shadow for the next few weeks, alright? Anything you need, he\u2019s your man.\u201d Leo gave a quick, jerky nod, his eyes wide. Arthur murmured a greeting, feeling the unseen walls of his new life assembling around him, brick by invisible brick.\n\nHe was shown into a dressing room that was smaller than the one he\u2019d had on finals night, but infinitely more luxurious. There was a bowl of fruit he would not eat and a rack of designer clothes he would not choose. A woman with fiercely arched eyebrows and a belt of makeup brushes descended on him, tilting his face to the light and tutting softly. \u201cThe camera is not kind to tired eyes,\u201d she announced to the room at large, before beginning to dab and blend, erasing the evidence of his sleepless nights. As she worked, Janice, the publicist, stood by the door, speaking in a low, rapid voice. \u201cThe narrative is key, Arthur. Humble beginnings, devoted son, the dream people thought was impossible. We lean into the authenticity. You are the real thing in a plastic world. When they ask about the money, it\u2019s not for you, it\u2019s for your mum. A new kitchen, a garden, security. Got it?\u201d He just nodded, his face a passive canvas for the makeup artist, his mind a blank slate for the publicist to write upon. He was being built, assembled, his raw materials of grief and guilt being polished into a marketable story.\n\nThe set of the breakfast show was an assault of primary colours and aggressive cheerfulness. He was guided to a lurid orange sofa, the cushions so plump they seemed to sigh as he sat down. The host, a woman with a famous smile and teeth so white they seemed to generate their own light, leaned over and squeezed his knee. \u201cArthur! So thrilled to have you! You\u2019ve captured the nation\u2019s heart, you really have. Just relax, this is just a chat,\u201d she chirped, her eyes already looking past him to the camera operator who was signalling they had ten seconds. The theme music swelled and then faded, the studio lights grew hotter, and the famous smile was turned on him like a searchlight. \u201cAnd we are back with the man of the moment, the winner of this year\u2019s show, the incredible Arthur Penhaligon! Arthur\u2026 welcome. You must be on cloud nine!\u201d The question hung in the air, a simple, baited hook. He thought of the cold dread on the M6, of his mother\u2019s wounded voice, of the hollow ache that had taken up permanent residence in his chest. He smiled, a gentle, humble expression that the makeup artist had prepared and his own despair had perfected. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s all a bit of a dream,\u201d he said, his voice soft. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s quite sunk in. I\u2019m just a waiter from Lancaster. Things like this don\u2019t happen to people like me.\u201d The answer was perfect. Janice, standing just off-camera, gave a small, almost imperceptible nod of approval.\n\nThe interview was a masterclass in polite evasion. He spoke of the honour, the shock, the gratitude. When the host asked what he would do with the prize money, he delivered the lines Janice had given him, painting a picture of a comfortable, worry-free future for his mother. The lie was so pure, so noble in its intent, that it almost felt true. Then came the question he had been dreading. \u201cYour mother, Elsie, we all saw her in the audience during the semi-finals, she must be bursting with pride. I\u2019m sure she was your biggest supporter on the night of the final, too.\u201d Arthur felt a momentary, vertiginous drop, the studio floor seeming to fall away. He saw his mother on the sofa, her face a mask of disappointment. He saw her on the doorstep, waving him off, her pride resurrected by his victory. He had to hold on to the second image. It was the only way to survive the first. \u201cShe\u2019s everything to me,\u201d he said, his voice thick with an emotion that was entirely real, even if its context was a lie. \u201cShe\u2019s the reason I sing. To know I\u2019ve made her happy\u2026 that\u2019s the real prize.\u201d\n\nAs if on cue, the screen behind them flickered to life. \u201cLet\u2019s just remind ourselves of that incredible, winning performance,\u201d the host said brightly. The opening piano chords of \u2018Calon L\u00e2n\u2019 filled the studio, and he was forced to watch a replay of his own heartbreak. He saw the man on the screen, his face pale and strained, his eyes dark with a sorrow that the cameras had interpreted as artistic depth. He heard the voice, his voice, saturated with a pain so profound it had silenced a nation. He watched this stranger fall apart in the most public way imaginable, his confession of a lie transformed into an anthem of triumph. The audience in the studio applauded the clip, their faces full of admiration. The host turned back to him, her own eyes glistening. \u201cJust breathtaking. So much raw emotion. What were you thinking in that moment, Arthur? Where did that come from?\u201d He looked into the camera, into the millions of living rooms, into the kind, trusting faces of people like Mrs Gable and his colleagues at The Gilded Fork. He thought of his mother, watching him now, her heart swelling with pride. He gave them the only answer he could. \u201cI was thinking of home,\u201d he whispered.\n\nThe interview concluded, and as the show cut to a commercial break, the host\u2019s warm expression vanished, replaced by a professional briskness as she turned to her notes for the next segment. The bubble of performance had burst. Chloe was at his side instantly, her face alight with triumph. \u201cPerfect. Absolutely perfect. Heartfelt, humble, you hit every single beat. They loved you. The phones are already going mad.\u201d She did not ask if he was alright. She did not seem to notice the sweat on his brow or the slight tremble in his hand as he accepted the glass of water Leo offered him. She had seen a flawless execution of the brand strategy. The man who had executed it was incidental. He was guided off the set, the cheerful theme music rising behind him, and led back down the sterile corridors, his duty done. But the day was not over. The radio blitz was next. He understood now. His new job was not singing. It was this: a relentless series of performances on couches and in studios, retelling the story of his magical, beautiful, perfect victory until he, and everyone else, believed it was true."

Between each stop, Janice would provide a clipped summary of the next host\u2019s style\u2014\"Chris is a man-of-the-people, lots of football analogies,\" \"Fiona is more high-brow, expect a question about the Welsh choral tradition\"\u2014all of which was utterly useless information. The questions were always the same, variations on a single, triumphant theme. Arthur sat in sound-proofed rooms, a pair of heavy headphones clamped over his ears, and spoke into microphones that seemed to drink his words without leaving a trace. He talked about his shock, his gratitude, his love for his mother. His voice, the very thing that had brought him here, felt disconnected from him, a disembodied sound floating in the sterile air of the studio, a tool he was learning to operate with a chilling proficiency.\n\nAfter the third interview, in a studio overlooking the bustling chaos of Leicester Square, the host announced they would be opening the phone lines. \"The whole country wants to talk to you, Arthur,\" he said with a warm, avuncular smile. Arthur\u2019s heart gave a familiar, sickening lurch. This was an unscripted danger, an opportunity for a question he couldn\u2019t answer. The first few calls were a blur of breathless congratulations and declarations of having voted for him ten times. He responded with practiced humility, his answers becoming smoother and more hollow with each call. Then the host\u2019s tone changed. \"We have a lady on the line now from your home town. All the way from Lancaster, it\u2019s\u2026 Mary Gable. Hello, Mary, you\u2019re on the air with Arthur.\"\n\nThe name struck him like a physical blow. The studio, the host, the blinking lights\u2014it all dissolved. He was back in The Gilded Fork, the scent of b\u00e9arnaise sauce in the air, a kind, wrinkled face smiling up at him. The voice that came through his headphones was thin and reedy, laced with the static of a long-distance call, but it was unmistakably her. \"Arthur? Is that you, love?\" He couldn\u2019t speak. He just nodded dumbly at the microphone. \"It\u2019s Mrs Gable. From Table 4,\" she continued, as if he might have forgotten. \"Oh, we are all so proud of you, son. So very proud. You stood up so straight! And that song\u2026 oh, it was just beautiful. You made us all cry. Now, you haven't forgotten your promise, have you? That Vera Lynn song. You promised me.\" A genuine laugh, small and unexpected, escaped Arthur\u2019s lips. It was the first real sound he had made all day. \"No, Mrs Gable,\" he said, and his own voice sounded strange to him, thick with an emotion he wasn\u2019t performing. \"I haven't forgotten. It's the first one I'll learn.\"\n\nThe moment was radio gold. The host\u2019s eyes lit up, sensing the raw, unscripted truth of it. When the call ended, he leaned into his microphone, his voice hushed with reverence. \"That, ladies and gentlemen, is why this man won. A true gentleman. Don't go away, we'll be right back with Arthur Penhaligon after the break.\" During the advert, Leo, his young shadow, gave him a thumbs-up, his face glowing with admiration. \"That was amazing!\" he whispered. \"So real!\" Arthur just stared at the sound-proofing foam on the wall, the genuine warmth of Mrs Gable\u2019s call already receding, leaving him colder than before. She had reached through the artifice and touched him for a moment, but in doing so, she had only highlighted the crushing reality of his isolation. Her pride was for the man on the television, the man who made promises and sang beautiful songs. He was now that man, and he would have to keep those promises, no matter the cost.\n\nThe final appointment of the day was at the record label's headquarters, a shimmering tower of glass and steel that seemed to pierce the grey London sky. This was not a place of creative clutter or artistic chaos; it was a cathedral of commerce, silent and intimidating. He was led not to a studio but to a boardroom on the top floor. A single, vast slab of dark wood served as a table, surrounded by a dozen severe black leather chairs. Through the floor-to-ceiling windows, London was laid out below him, a sprawling, indifferent map of his new life. The man from the party, the head of the label, a Mr Davies, was there, along with two other executives whose smiles were as sharp and polished as their shoes. They did not gush like the television hosts. They observed him with a calm, unnerving intensity, the way a jeweller might examine a newly acquired, un-cut diamond.\n\nThey talked about marketing demographics and album release windows, their conversation a swift, coded volley that Arthur struggled to follow. They used his name, but they seemed to be talking about a concept, a brand called \u2018Arthur Penhaligon\u2019. He was a story, a feeling, an emotional arc that could be translated into units sold. Finally, Mr Davies leaned forward, steepling his fingers on the gleaming table. \"Arthur,\" he said, his voice quiet but carrying an immense, unshakeable authority. \"Your performance in the final was a moment. A rare moment of genuine, powerful emotion. It connected. It\u2019s what people are buying into. It\u2019s what we are buying into.\" He paused, his eyes holding Arthur's. \"That is what this first album needs to be. We need to capture that. That\u2026 beautiful sadness. That heartbreak. We want an album of Calon L\u00e2ns.\" The words hung in the sterile air of the boardroom. They were not asking him to sing. They were asking him to bleed. They were commissioning a collection of his most profound pain, packaged into three-minute tracks and sold for mass consumption.\n\nArthur looked out of the window, down at the tiny, scurrying cars and the endless grey rooftops. He had thought his penance was to perform happiness, to pretend he was the humble, joyous winner everyone wanted him to be. He had been wrong. His real penance was to commodify his grief. To relive the lie, the fear, and the heartbreak, over and over again, in a recording booth, until they had enough material for a platinum-selling album. To stand on stages for the rest of his foreseeable future and sing, not of the joy he didn\u2019t feel, but of the authentic, soul-crushing sorrow that had won him the prize. It was a far more terrible, more fitting punishment than he could ever have imagined. He turned his gaze from the window and met the expectant eyes of Mr Davies. He gave a small, almost imperceptible nod. \"Alright,\" he said, his voice barely a whisper. The executives smiled. A deal had been struck."

This was where the alchemy was to happen, where his pain was to be spun into gold. The studio, named \u2018The Alibi Room\u2019, was a stark contrast to the corporate gloss of the label\u2019s headquarters. It was a space of curated cool: vintage Persian rugs on dark wood floors, exposed brickwork, and an array of guitars hanging on the walls like retired hunting trophies. It was designed to feel authentic, a creative haven, but to Arthur, it felt like the most sophisticated and terrifying prison yet. The walls were lined with velvet to absorb the sound, and he felt they absorbed his very soul, leaving him dry and husks-like at the end of each day.\n\nLeo, his shadow, was a constant, well-meaning presence, fetching him coffee he never drank and water he barely sipped. His youthful reverence for the process was a source of constant, low-grade irritation for Arthur. Leo saw magic in the endless tweaking of a microphone position, in the complex constellation of tiny lights on the mixing desk. Arthur only saw the cold, technical mechanics of his own vivisection. The producer assigned to him was a man named Julian, a quiet, intense man in his late forties with kind eyes and a reputation for coaxing \u2018truthful\u2019 performances from his artists. He wore soft, unstructured cardigans and spoke in a gentle, almost therapeutic tone. Arthur knew, with a dreadful certainty, that Julian was the most dangerous man he had yet met. He was the chief inquisitor, the man whose job it was to find the wound and press on it until it bled.\n\nTheir first session began not with a grand Puccini aria, but with a song that had been written for him by a team of hugely successful Swedish songwriters. It was a beautiful, melancholic ballad called \u2018The Ghost of a Footprint\u2019, full of poetic, slightly vague lyrics about loss and memory. It was engineered to be moving, a blank canvas onto which an audience could project their own sadness. Julian played it for him on an old acoustic guitar, his voice a pleasant, unassuming murmur. \u201cThe melody feels like it\u2019s in your range, the sentiment is there,\u201d Julian said softly. \u201cLet\u2019s just see how it feels. No pressure. Just find your way into it.\u201d Arthur was led into the vocal booth, a small, dimly lit box that felt unnervingly like a confessional. The heavy door closed with a soft, definitive click, sealing him in. He put on the headphones, and Julian\u2019s disembodied voice filled his head, calm and encouraging. \u201cWhenever you\u2019re ready, Arthur.\u201d\n\nHe sang. The notes were perfect, the pitch immaculate, the phrasing faultless. He was a good waiter, a man who had spent a decade fulfilling requests with precision and discretion, and this was just another order to be fulfilled. He delivered the song as requested, a clean, technically proficient vocal take. When the final note faded, there was a moment of silence. Then Julian\u2019s voice came through the headphones, still gentle, but with a new, searching quality. \u201cThat was lovely, Arthur. Technically, it\u2019s flawless. But I\u2019m not feeling you in there. I\u2019m hearing the song, but I\u2019m not hearing your story. What we need is that thing you gave us on Saturday night. That honesty.\u201d Arthur closed his eyes. Honesty. They kept using that word. They had no idea what it meant.\n\nThey tried again. And again. Each take was a perfect, lifeless replica of the last. He could hear the faint, creeping frustration in Julian\u2019s patient instructions. Outside the glass of the vocal booth, he could see Leo looking anxious, his faith in the magic beginning to waver. Julian called for a break. He came into the booth, leaving the door open, breaking the seal. He sat on a stool opposite Arthur. \u201cLet\u2019s forget the song for a minute,\u201d he said, his kind eyes searching Arthur\u2019s face. \u201cTalk to me about Lancaster. What does it feel like when you\u2019re walking home from work, by the canal? What does the air smell like?\u201d The questions were so simple, so unexpected. Arthur found himself talking, his voice low, describing the damp, earthy smell, the sound of his own footsteps on the wet pavement, the particular bruised-plum colour of the sky at dusk. He spoke of the quiet, and Julian just nodded, listening. \u201cAnd your mum,\u201d Julian said, his voice dropping even lower. \u201cWhen you sing, you\u2019re singing for her, aren\u2019t you? That\u2019s what you said in the interview this morning.\u201d\n\nThe trap was sprung. It was so elegant, so gentle, he hadn\u2019t even seen the jaws. Julian had taken the public narrative, the lie he had so carefully constructed, and was now using it as a key to unlock the private truth. Arthur\u2019s throat tightened. He thought of his mother\u2019s face, not as a source of inspiration, but as the reason for his suffocating guilt. He thought of the premonition, the screech of tires, the bargain he had made with a universe that had not been listening. A cold, familiar dread washed over him. \u201cLet\u2019s try one more time,\u201d Julian said, as if sensing the shift in the emotional weather. He retreated back to the control room, and the heavy door clicked shut again, sealing Arthur back inside his own head.\n\nHe put on the headphones. The simple piano backing track began. He opened his mouth, but this time, he wasn\u2019t thinking about the Swedish lyrics or the perfect pitch. He was standing on the hard shoulder of the M6. He was hearing the hurt in his mother\u2019s voice. He was seeing the garish trophy on his mantelpiece. He was feeling the profound, crushing weight of his magnificent, terrible lie. He sang. The voice that came out of him was a raw, wounded thing. It cracked on the high notes and frayed at the edges with a sorrow so pure it was almost ugly. He wasn\u2019t performing \u2018The Ghost of a Footprint\u2019; he was confessing to it. The footprint was his own, the ghost was the man he had left behind. When he finished, he was shaking, leaning against the velvet-lined wall for support, his breath coming in ragged gasps. The silence from the control room was absolute, stretching for an eternity. Then Julian\u2019s voice, when it came, was a choked whisper. \u201cMy God, Arthur. Don\u2019t move. We\u2019re recording. Just\u2026 do that again. Exactly that.\u201d"

                                        "text": "### Chapter 7\n\nThe words echoed in the small, padded box, stripped of their initial, choked emotion and replayed in Arthur\u2019s head as a cold, clinical instruction. *Do that again. Exactly that.* It wasn\u2019t a plea for an encore; it was an order to reopen a vein. The fragile barrier between the man and the artist, between the agony and the performance, had been vaporised. In that moment, Arthur understood the true nature of his contract. He had not been signed for his voice, but for his wound, and his job, for the foreseeable future, was to keep it fresh, to prevent it from ever healing over. Julian, with his kind eyes and gentle manner, was not a producer; he was a surgeon of the soul, and his task was to extract a specific, marketable strain of pain. The realisation was so profound, so horrifying, it left no room for anger. All he felt was a vast, arctic emptiness.\n\nHe looked through the thick studio glass at the two figures in the control room. Julian was leaning forward, his face a mask of intense concentration, his hand hovering over a fader on the enormous mixing desk. Leo, his young shadow, was staring at Arthur with an expression of pure, unadulterated awe, as if he were witnessing a miracle rather than a meticulously engineered emotional breakdown. To Leo, this was art. This was the magic he had come to London to be a part of. Arthur felt a surge of something akin to pity for the boy\u2019s innocence. He was a tourist watching a ritual sacrifice, admiring the beautiful patterns the blood made on the stones. He took a breath, the air in the booth feeling thick and used up. He had to do it again. He had no other choice. This was the job. This was the price.\n\nHe closed his eyes and summoned the images, the terrible slideshow he now knew by heart. The white van cutting in front of the blue saloon. The high-pitched, desperate squeal of rubber on tarmac. His mother\u2019s voice on the phone, the cheerfulness draining from it, leaving only a thin, brittle shell of hurt. The peacock-blue hat, sitting in its box by the door. He marshalled his ghosts, lined them up, and made them perform. When he opened his mouth, the sound that emerged was a near-perfect replica of his earlier agony. The melody was a vessel, and he filled it with guilt, with fear, with the bottomless sorrow of his monumental, loving lie. He sang the song three more times, each pass leaving him progressively more hollowed out, more spectral. He was a well, and they were lowering a bucket into him, time and time again, and he was amazed to find that there was always more water, dark and bitter, to be drawn up.\n\nWhen Julian\u2019s voice finally came through the headphones, it was soft with a satisfaction that was almost reverent. \u201cThat\u2019s it, Arthur. We\u2019ve got it. We have it. That was\u2026 extraordinary. Let\u2019s call it a day.\u201d The heavy door of the vocal booth opened, and the ordinary air of the studio rushed in, smelling of coffee and old rugs. It felt like emerging from a deep-sea dive, the pressure change making him dizzy. Leo rushed forward with a bottle of water, his eyes shining. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like that,\u201d he breathed. \u201cIt was like you were channelling something.\u201d Arthur took the water, his hand shaking too much to open it. He just nodded, the gesture requiring a colossal effort. Julian clapped him gently on the shoulder. \u201cYou did good work today, Arthur. Really good work. Go home. Get some rest. We\u2019ll do it all again tomorrow.\u201d\n\nThe ride back to the serviced apartment the label had rented for him was a silent, grey smear. He sat in the back of the familiar black saloon, staring out at the rain-slicked London streets, seeing nothing. He felt scoured, sandblasted, a building stripped back to its bare, weeping brickwork. His apartment was on the seventh floor of a new, anonymous glass block in a part of the city that had no discernible character. It was furnished with clean lines, hard surfaces, and a complete absence of personality. There were no worn armchairs, no ceramic birds, no framed photographs of a day trip to Morecambe. It was a holding cell with a better view. He walked in, dropped his keys on the stark white kitchen counter, and stood for a long time in the centre of the room, listening to the hum of the air conditioning. He had spent his entire day excavating his deepest feelings, and now he was in a place where it was impossible to feel anything at all.\n\nHe knew he had to call his mother. It was part of the routine, the most crucial performance of his day. He sat on the edge of the stiff, modern sofa and dialled, composing his face into a mask of weary contentment for an audience of one, a thousand miles away. She answered, as always, on the second ring. \u201cArthur! How was it, love? Your first proper day! Did they like you?\u201d Her voice was a lifeline to a world he no longer inhabited, a world of simple successes and honest work. It was a world where a good day meant you had done a good job. He looked around the sterile white room, at the view of a thousand other windows, and summoned the energy for his final lie of the day. \u201cIt was good, Mam. Really good. The producer, Julian, he\u2019s very nice. We worked on a new song. I think\u2026 I think they were pleased.\u201d\n\n\u201cPleased? Of course they were pleased!\u201d she chirped, her pride a warm, uncomplicated thing. \u201cHow could they not be? As long as you\u2019re happy, love. That\u2019s the main thing. That you\u2019re enjoying it.\u201d Enjoying it. The word was so absurd, so grotesquely inappropriate, that he had to stifle a laugh that sounded more like a sob. He had spent the day mentally torturing himself for money, and she was picturing him humming happily in a room full of new friends. The chasm between her reality and his was now the defining feature of his existence. He was a man living in two separate, incompatible worlds, and the strain of holding them apart was tearing him in two. \u201cI\u2019m happy, Mam,\u201d he said, the words tasting like rust in his mouth. \u201cI\u2019m very happy.\u201d He ended the call, promising to phone again the next day, and let the phone drop onto the sofa beside him. He sat in the gathering dusk, the lights of London beginning to glitter outside his window like a vast, beautiful, indifferent star field. He had another session tomorrow. He had to do it all again. And again. And again. The beautiful sadness was his product, and he was beginning to understand that the supply was inexhaustible."

Arthur learned how to access the dark well inside himself with an unnerving efficiency. He no longer had to consciously summon the ghosts of the motorway or the memory of his mother\u2019s wounded voice; they were his constant companions now, waiting patiently in the wings of his mind for their cue. Julian would give a quiet nod from the control room, Arthur would close his eyes, and the performance would begin. He had become a virtuoso of his own misery. His voice, once a source of simple, private joy, was now a precision instrument for the excavation of pain, and he played it with a skill that terrified him. He was thinner, the skin stretched taut over his cheekbones, and his eyes had a permanent, haunted quality that the makeup artists on his occasional media appearances no longer had to fake. He was the perfect embodiment of the beautiful sadness they were selling.\n\nOne Tuesday afternoon, after a particularly raw take of a song about a love that was doomed from the start, Julian\u2019s voice came through the headphones, warm with accomplishment. \u201cI think that\u2019s the one, Arthur. The emotion is just\u2026 there. You know, I think we have something now. A body of work. I want to play you something. I want you to hear what we\u2019re building.\u201d A profound dread, cold and heavy, settled in Arthur\u2019s stomach. He had avoided this. He had sung into the void, day after day, and had actively refused to listen to the playback, treating each performance as a discrete act of self-immolation that was over the moment it was finished. To listen back felt like being forced to attend his own autopsy. But Julian was already ushering him out of the vocal booth and towards the large, worn leather sofa that faced the mixing desk and its fortress of speakers. Leo, sensing a momentous occasion, perched on the arm of the sofa, his face a mask of nervous excitement.\n\nJulian dimmed the main studio lights, creating a theatrical, intimate atmosphere. He moved a few faders on the desk, his movements economical and precise. \u201cI\u2019ve done a rough mix of the first three tracks,\u201d he said, his voice a low murmur in the semi-darkness. \u201cJust to give you a sense of the shape of it. Listen.\u201d He pressed a button, and the studio was filled with sound. It was immense. It was a soundscape of epic melancholy, a cathedral built from his own quiet despair. His voice, the raw, cracking thing he had been producing in the booth, was at the centre of it, but it was no longer naked. It was supported by swelling cellos, ghosted by ethereal backing vocals, and underscored by a piano that fell like soft, relentless rain. The production was flawless, beautiful, and utterly devastating. It was the most heartbreaking sound he had ever heard.\n\nHe listened, frozen on the sofa, as his own private agony was played back to him, polished and packaged for public consumption. He heard the catch in his throat as he sang a line about saying goodbye, a sound born from the memory of his mother\u2019s hurt silence, now transformed into a sublime musical moment, artfully drenched in reverb. He heard the ragged edge of his voice on a sustained high note, a sound torn from him by the visceral memory of screeching tires, now framed by a shimmering cymbal crash that made it heroic. It was a violation of the most intimate kind. They had taken his truth, the ugly, secret, shameful truth of his lie, and had made it beautiful. They had made it art. He felt a dizzying wave of depersonalization, as if the man singing from the speakers was a stranger who had stolen his memories and his voice, and was now parading them with a skill and artistry Arthur himself could never possess. The singer on the record was a genius of sorrow. Arthur was just the raw, weeping material he had been quarried from.\n\nWhen the last notes faded into a shimmering silence, Julian slowly turned up the lights. His face was glowing, suffused with the quiet, profound satisfaction of a master craftsman who had just completed his masterwork. Leo was speechless, his eyes wide and wet with tears. \u201cArthur\u2026 it\u2019s a masterpiece,\u201d Julian said, his voice barely above a whisper. \u201cIt\u2019s more than an album. It\u2019s a confession. It\u2019s the truth.\u201d The word, \u2018truth\u2019, landed with the force of a physical blow. Arthur felt a sudden, violent need for air, for an escape from this room where his soul had been so expertly sampled, looped, and arranged. He stood up abruptly, the movement jerky and uncoordinated. \u201cI need a walk,\u201d he mumbled, his voice a dry rasp, and he turned and walked towards the door, his one thought to get away from the sound of his own beautifully rendered lie.\n\nHe was halfway down the cobbled mews before he realised Leo was scurrying behind him, his faithful shadow in this new, bewildering world. \u201cGreat idea! Some air!\u201d Leo panted, catching up to him. \u201cThat was just\u2026 intense. I don\u2019t know how you do it. Where are we going?\u201d Arthur stopped and turned, the sudden, bright daylight making him flinch. The noise of the city, the ordinary sounds of traffic and people, felt like a vulgar intrusion after the curated perfection of the studio. \u201cI\u2019m going for a walk, Leo,\u201d he said, and the words came out colder and sharper than he had intended. \u201cAlone.\u201d Leo\u2019s eager, open face crumpled. He looked like a puppy that had been unexpectedly kicked. \u201cOh,\u201d he said, his voice small. \u201cRight. Of course. Sorry. Do you\u2026 want me to get you anything? A coffee?\u201d\n\nLooking at Leo\u2019s earnest, worried face, the brief flash of irritation Arthur had felt was instantly extinguished, replaced by a wave of profound, bone-deep weariness. This boy was not his jailer. He was just another prisoner, trapped by his own innocent dreams of the music industry. \u201cNo, Leo,\u201d Arthur said, his voice softening. \u201cThank you. I\u2019m fine.\u201d He turned and walked away, leaving Leo standing alone on the cobbles, a small, confused figure outside the temple of sound. Arthur walked without direction, his hands stuffed in his pockets, his shoulders hunched against a chill that had nothing to do with the weather. He moved through the streets of fashionable London, past artisanal bakeries selling sourdough bread for the price of a full meal at The Gilded Fork, past expensive boutiques displaying single, exquisite dresses in their windows. He was a ghost haunting a life he was supposed to be living, the sound of his own polished agony still ringing in his ears, a perfect, inescapable soundtrack.\n\nHe found a small, forgotten churchyard, a patch of green and tilting grey headstones hemmed in by towering office blocks. He sat on a cold stone bench, under the shade of an ancient, gnarled yew tree, and finally allowed himself to breathe. He took out his phone. He had one more performance to give. He dialled his mother\u2019s number, the familiar sequence of digits a small, painful ritual. She answered, her voice bubbling with news from Lancaster. The local paper wanted to do a follow-up interview with her. The butcher had put a \u2018We\u2019re proud of you, Arthur!\u2019 sign in his window. Mrs Gable had stopped her in the street to ask if he had started learning \u2018The White Cliffs of Dover\u2019 yet. Her world was a universe constructed entirely from the bright, shining echo of his success, and he was its absent, benevolent god. He listened, making the right noises, the right murmurs of encouragement. \u201cThat\u2019s wonderful, Mam,\u201d he said, when she finally paused for breath. His voice was a dead, flat monotone, all its colour and life having been left on the studio floor. There was a pause. A different kind of pause. \u201cArthur? Are you alright, love?\u201d she asked, a sliver of concern cutting through her excitement. \u201cYou sound a bit flat.\u201d The first crack. The first tremor in the edifice. He scrambled to repair the damage, forcing a warmth he did not feel into his voice. \u201cJust tired, Mam. It was a long day. A good day, though. A really good day. We listened to some of the songs. They sound\u2026 amazing.\u201d The lie saved him, for now. But as he ended the call, sitting alone amongst the dead in the heart of the city, he knew, with a chilling certainty, that the performance was becoming unsustainable. He was running out of lies."

                                        "text": "The fear that lingered after the call was a new and more insidious vintage. The public finding out he was a fraud was a distant, abstract terror. His mother discovering he was unhappy\u2014that was immediate, personal, and utterly catastrophic. The entire, elaborate deception, the whole punishing charade, was for the sole purpose of preserving her joy. If his own misery leaked through the cracks in his voice and poisoned that joy, then the entire sacrifice was for nothing. He would have lost himself and failed her, a double-negative that cancelled out his entire existence. He sat on the cold stone bench, the tilting headstones his silent companions, and felt the architecture of his lie begin to groan under a strain it was never designed to bear.\n\nHe walked back to the apartment as the city\u2019s evening pulse quickened. The pubs were spilling light and laughter onto the pavements, and the restaurants were filling with couples and groups of friends, their animated conversations visible through the large glass windows. Arthur moved through it all like a man walking underwater, the vibrant life of the city a distorted, distant spectacle. He saw a young man buy a bouquet of flowers from a street vendor, a woman laugh so hard she had to lean against a wall for support, a father lifting his small child onto his shoulders to see over the crowds. These were small, unremarkable moments of human connection, of ordinary happiness, and they felt as remote and unattainable to him as the stars. Each scene was a fresh page in a book about a language he had forgotten how to speak.\n\nThe apartment was cold and silent, smelling faintly of the lemon-scented cleaning products the weekly service used. It was a space scrubbed clean of life. He didn't turn on the lights, preferring to stand in the gloom, watching the city glitter through the vast, floor-to-ceiling window. He was a specimen in a glass case, a perfect example of modern success, with a view of everything and a connection to nothing. His phone buzzed in his pocket. He pulled it out, expecting it to be Leo with a schedule update, but the name on the screen was his sister\u2019s. The message was short, simple, and devastating. \u2018Mam just called. She\u2019s worried about you. Said you sounded low. Are you eating properly, Art? We\u2019re all so proud of you, don\u2019t let them run you into the ground.\u2019 He stared at the words until they blurred, the screen\u2019s harsh blue light illuminating the profound failure of his performance. The one person he was doing all this for, the person whose happiness was his only remaining moral compass, was beginning to see the truth.\n\nA strange, unfamiliar anger began to bubble up through the layers of his exhaustion and despair. It wasn't directed at his sister, or his mother, or even at Julian and the machinery of the label. It was an impotent rage at the sheer, crushing impossibility of his situation. He walked into the stark white kitchen, a space more like a laboratory than a place for preparing food, and opened the pristine, empty refrigerator. The label provided a weekly grocery delivery service, a curated selection of organic vegetables, lean proteins, and artisanal cheeses, most of which he left to rot. He ignored it all. He rummaged in the back of a cupboard and found what he was looking for: a forgotten tin of baked beans and a plastic-wrapped loaf of cheap white bread. It was survival food from his old life. In a silent, desperate act of rebellion, he made himself beans on toast. He didn't use one of the expensive, minimalist plates, but ate standing over the sink, scooping the beans onto the toast with a fork, the familiar, slightly metallic taste an echo of a thousand tired evenings after a long shift at The Gilded Fork.\n\nAs he ate the simple, unglamorous meal, a decision began to crystallize in his mind, forming with the cold, hard clarity of an ice crystal. This slow, public disintegration was unsustainable. The daily act of mining his own sorrow was not just destroying him; it was beginning to poison the very person he was trying to protect. The risk of his mother discovering the full extent of his misery was now a greater, more immediate threat than the risk of disappointing her with his failure. He had to change the terms of his penance. He could not run from the lie, but he could no longer live it in this gilded cage, two hundred miles away. He had to go home. Not for a fleeting, stage-managed visit, but to be there, on the ground, to manage the lie in person, to shore up the cracks before the whole dam burst. It was a desperate, illogical plan, a flight not away from his problem, but directly into its heart. He rinsed the plate, left it in the sink, and walked to his laptop. He didn't call Chloe to ask for permission. He didn't text Leo to cancel his schedule. He opened a web browser, his fingers moving with a new, determined purpose, and booked a one-way ticket on the first train to Lancaster in the morning."

                                        "text": "### Chapter 9\n\nHe woke before the alarm, a jolt of adrenaline cutting through the shallow depths of his sleep. For a moment, he lay perfectly still in the pre-dawn gloom, listening. The apartment was silent, its air-conditioned hum the only sign of life. The decision he had made in the desperate clarity of the previous evening felt reckless and insane in the cold light of morning. But the alternative\u2014another day in the velvet coffin of the vocal booth, another phone call where he would have to counterfeit happiness for his mother\u2014was simply unthinkable. The fear of staying had finally become greater than the fear of running. He moved with the quiet, urgent purpose of a fugitive. He packed a single bag, not with the crisp, new clothes the label\u2019s stylists had provided, but with his own worn jeans and jumpers, the few remaining artefacts of his former self. He left the key card on the white countertop, a small, plastic tombstone marking the grave of his London life. He did not look back.\n\nHe took the Tube to Euston Station, descending into the warm, metallic-smelling breath of the city\u2019s underbelly. The early morning crowds were a river of preoccupied faces, and for the first time in weeks, Arthur felt a profound sense of relief. Here, in the anonymous crush of the commute, he was no one. He was just another man in a dark coat with his head down, another ghost in the machine. The invisibility he had once taken for granted now felt like a superpower, a cloak he could pull around his shoulders for a few precious, stolen hours. He bought his ticket from a machine, paid with his own debit card, and found his platform, the vast, arched roof of the station feeling like the nave of a great, hurried cathedral. He felt a thrill of pure, unadulterated agency. He was not being driven; he was moving under his own power, making a choice, however desperate and ill-advised it might be.\n\nThe train slid out of the station with a gentle, sighing hiss, and as it gathered speed, leaving the dense urban sprawl for the green, untidy patchwork of the home counties, Arthur felt a subtle loosening in his chest. The rhythmic, monotonous clatter of the wheels on the track was a soothing, forward-moving sound, a drumbeat of escape. He watched the country scroll past his window, a landscape waking under a watercolour sky. He saw fields of sheep, their fleece grey in the early light, and small villages clustered around stone church spires. It was a world of quiet, ordinary life, a world that continued to exist entirely without him. The journey north felt like a reversal of time, a rewinding of the past few, frantic months. With every mile that passed, he felt as if he were shedding a layer of the artifice that had been so carefully applied, stripping himself back to the man who had first made the journey down, a man full of a simpler, more honest kind of terror.\n\nHis phone began to vibrate halfway to Crewe. The screen glowed with Chloe\u2019s name. His brief, anonymous freedom was over. He stared at the vibrating device, the insistent buzzing a summons back to the life he was fleeing. He could ignore it, but that would only delay the inevitable, a cowardly act. He had made his move; now he had to own it. He took a deep breath, the air in the carriage smelling of stale coffee and disinfectant, and answered. \u201cArthur,\u201d Chloe\u2019s voice was sharp, a staccato burst of confusion and annoyance. \u201cWhere are you? Your car\u2019s been waiting for an hour. Julian\u2019s at the studio. Leo is having a panic attack.\u201d He leaned his head against the cool glass of the window, watching a pylon march across a distant hill. \u201cI\u2019m on a train, Chloe,\u201d he said, his voice quiet but firm. \u201cI\u2019m going home. To Lancaster.\u201d\n\nThere was a moment of stunned silence on the other end, a brief, silent reboot of her entire strategic framework. \u201cYou\u2019re\u2026 what? Arthur, you can\u2019t just leave. We have a schedule. We have a delivery date for this album. What is going on?\u201d Her voice was rising, the slick corporate veneer cracking to reveal the raw frustration beneath. This was the moment. He had to re-negotiate the terms of his surrender. \u201cI can\u2019t do it anymore, Chloe,\u201d he said, the simple truth of the words giving them an unshakeable weight. \u201cNot like this. Not from down there. You want the album? You want that\u2026 beautiful sadness? It comes from Lancaster. It comes from my life, from my mother. Being two hundred miles away, locked in a studio, it\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s killing the source. I can\u2019t give you what you want if I\u2019m not there.\u201d He was using their own language against them, reframing his desperate need for escape as a necessary condition for the creative process. It was a lie, of course, but it was a better, more useful lie than any he had told so far.\n\nHe could almost hear the gears turning in her head, the rapid cost-benefit analysis. An AWOL, unhappy star was a public relations disaster and a creative dead end. A star reconnecting with his \u2018authentic roots\u2019 to fuel his art? That was a story. That was marketable. \u201cAlright, Arthur,\u201d she said, her voice dropping, the anger replaced by a tone of carefully managed concession. \u201cAlright. I hear you. This is\u2026 unconventional. But if you think this is what\u2019s best for the album, then we\u2019ll make it work. For now. You can work from home. We\u2019ll arrange a local studio for you, or fly you down for key sessions. But you have to stay in communication. You have to work. This isn\u2019t a holiday.\u201d He had won. He had won a small, crucial battle in a war he knew he was still losing. \u201cI\u2019ll work,\u201d he promised. \u201cThank you, Chloe.\u201d He ended the call and looked out of the window. The landscape had changed. The hills were sterner now, the stone darker. He was entering his own country.\n\nThe train pulled into Lancaster station under a sky the colour of lead. As he stepped onto the platform, the familiar air, damp and cool and smelling of old stone, filled his lungs. It felt like his first real breath in months. The relief was intoxicating, but it was fleeting, replaced almost instantly by the anxiety of the task ahead. He walked out of the station and into the city. He was home, but he was no longer just a citizen; he was a landmark. He saw a poster for his winning single in the window of a music shop, his own mournful face staring back at him. He pulled the collar of his coat up and walked with his head down, but he could feel the occasional flicker of recognition, the subtle double-takes from passers-by. He walked past the grand facade of The Gilded Fork, its windows dark and empty at this time of day. It looked like a building from a dream he\u2019d once had. He was an alien visiting the ruins of his own life.\n\nHe turned onto his street. The bunting was gone, taken down by the weather or a return to civic normality, but the memory of it lingered. The street looked quiet, ordinary, just as it always had. But he knew it was different. He was different. He walked towards his front door, his footsteps echoing in the quiet, each one a hammer blow against his own heart. He knew his mother would be in. She was a woman of routine and ritual. He imagined her in the kitchen, wiping down the counters, the radio playing softly, a cup of tea by her elbow. He didn't have a key; he had given his to his sister months ago, a practical admission that his life was no longer here. He reached the peeling brown door, the sight of its familiar imperfections making his throat ache. He raised his hand, the knuckles white with tension, and knocked. He heard the radio cut off abruptly, the sound of footsteps, and then the rattle of the latch. He held his breath, bracing himself for the look on his mother\u2019s face when she saw the ghost that had appeared on her doorstep."

                                        "text": "The door swung open, and for a heart-stopping second, Elsie Penhaligon\u2019s face was a blank slate of incomprehension. She stared at the man on her doorstep as if he were a trick of the light, a figment of her worried imagination made flesh. Then, recognition flooded in, immediately followed not by joy, but by a wave of raw, maternal alarm. The man on the television, the confident, smiling victor, was gone. In his place stood her son, but a thinner, paler version, his eyes sunk into shadowed hollows, his shoulders slumped with a weariness that seemed ancient.\n\n\u201cArthur!\u201d The name was a gasp, a breath of pure shock. \u201cWhat on earth? What\u2019s happened? Are you alright?\u201d She reached out, her hand fluttering to his arm as if to check he was solid. Her touch was the anchor he had been searching for. He could see the questions, the fears, the scenarios she had been playing out in her head, all coalescing in her wide, frightened eyes. Before he could answer, her maternal instinct took over, overriding all other impulses. She grabbed his arm with a surprising strength and pulled him inside, shutting the door firmly behind him, closing out the quiet street and the prying eyes of the world. The familiar click of the latch was the sound of a cage door swinging shut, but for the first time, it felt like a sanctuary.\n\n\u201cLet me look at you,\u201d she commanded, her hands now on his shoulders, her gaze scanning him from head to toe. \u201cYou\u2019re skin and bone. And you\u2019re as white as a sheet. Have you been ill? Why didn\u2019t you call?\u201d He had prepared for this, rehearsing his lines on the train, a new performance for a new, more intimate stage. He summoned a smile that he hoped looked tired but not broken. \u201cI\u2019m fine, Mam. Honestly. Just run down. They\u2019ve\u2026 they\u2019ve given me a break.\u201d He delivered the lie he had crafted, the one that used the truth as its scaffolding. \u201cThe producer, Julian, he thinks I should spend some time at home. To write. He said I should get back to my roots. It\u2019s for the album.\u201d\n\nElsie stared at him, her brow furrowed, trying to process this new information, to fit it into the narrative of success she had so carefully constructed. The idea of him being sent home sounded less like a creative retreat and more like a punishment, a quiet expulsion. But the mention of the album, the sacred project, seemed to soothe her immediate panic. \u201cFor the album,\u201d she repeated, the words a charm against her fears. \u201cWell. I suppose that makes sense. You can\u2019t write about Lancaster from a London shoebox, can you?\u201d She released him, her practical nature reasserting itself. \u201cWell, you\u2019re here now. That\u2019s the main thing. Kettle\u2019s on. You sit yourself down in your chair before you fall down. You look ready to drop.\u201d\n\nHe obeyed, sinking into the familiar, welcoming contours of his armchair, the springs groaning a soft, welcoming complaint. The house was exactly as he had left it, a museum of his former life. On the mantelpiece, the golden trophy stood sentinel, catching the grey morning light, an obscene object of worship in this humble domestic chapel. He averted his eyes, unable to look at it. Elsie bustled in with a tray, two mugs of steaming tea and a plate of digestive biscuits arranged with a simple, loving precision. She placed it on the coffee table and sat on the edge of the sofa opposite him, her hands wrapped around her mug, her eyes never leaving his face. The interrogation by tea had begun. \u201cSo they\u2019re just letting you work from here? For how long?\u201d she asked, her tone casual, but her gaze sharp, forensic.\n\n\u201cFor as long as it takes, I suppose,\u201d he said, picking up his mug, the warmth seeping into his cold hands. \u201cIt\u2019s better this way. Quieter. I can think here.\u201d He was building the lie, adding details, making it solid. \u201cThe pressure down there\u2026 it\u2019s a lot, Mam. Constant. This is better for the work.\u201d He saw a flicker of understanding in her eyes. This she could accept. The trope of the overworked, sensitive artist was a familiar one. It was a story that made sense, a story that allowed her to worry about him without having to question his success. \u201cI told you they were working you too hard,\u201d she said, a note of grim satisfaction in her voice. \u201cYou\u2019re not a machine, Arthur. You need your rest. You need proper food.\u201d She looked at his thin face again, and her own softened with a deep, aching love. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll take care of that. You\u2019re home now. I\u2019ll fatten you up. You just concentrate on your beautiful songs.\u201d Her gaze drifted to the mantelpiece, to the gleaming, ostentatious prize. \u201cIt\u2019s all been worth it though, hasn\u2019t it, love? All this.\u201d She gestured towards the trophy, her eyes shining with a fierce, uncomplicated pride. Arthur followed her gaze and finally forced himself to look at it. The golden statue seemed to mock him, a permanent, glittering monument to the lie that sat between them, a lie he had just travelled two hundred miles to reinforce. \u201cYes, Mam,\u201d he said, the words feeling like shards of glass in his throat. \u201cIt\u2019s all been worth it.\u201d"

                                        "text": "The silence that followed his forced agreement was thick with all the things he could not say. Elsie, however, took his words as the end of a difficult conversation, a line drawn under a period of worry. She became a whirlwind of restorative domesticity, her anxiety channelled into a fierce, loving campaign to make things right. She insisted he take a hot bath while she put fresh sheets on his bed. She made him a cheese and onion sandwich, cutting it into neat triangles just as she had when he was a boy, her movements brisk and full of a purpose he could only envy. He ate it, the familiar taste of sharp cheddar and white bread a small, solid piece of reality in a world that had become abstract and terrifying. He retreated to his old bedroom, a small, square room overlooking the back gardens of the neighbouring houses. Nothing had changed. The narrow single bed was still covered with a worn candlewick bedspread. A shelf above his desk held a row of dusty paperbacks and a small, tarnished silver cup he had won for a choir solo when he was fourteen. It was the bedroom of the boy he had been, a quiet, hopeful boy who dreamed of singing. It was a shrine to a person who no longer existed, and standing in it felt like trespassing in his own past.\n\nHe spent the afternoon engaged in the elaborate pantomime of creative work. He sat at the small wooden desk, the same desk where he had once struggled with algebra homework, and opened a fresh, lined notebook that his mother had produced from a drawer. He stared at the blank page, a vast, white expanse of nothing, and tried to look thoughtful. He held a pen, uncapped, and occasionally tapped it against his teeth, an affectation he had probably seen in a film once. The act of performing the role of 'songwriter' was exhausting, a silent, one-man play for an audience of one. His mother would pop her head around the door every hour or so, a fresh cup of tea in her hand, her face a mixture of concern and reverence. \"Any ideas flowing, love?\" she would whisper, as if he were a skittish deer that might be startled by a loud noise. \"Don't you force it. They say it has to come naturally.\" He would just nod, offering a weak, pensive smile, and she would retreat, satisfied that she had witnessed the sacred, mysterious process of creation. He wrote nothing. The page remained as empty as he was.\n\nLate in the afternoon, the four walls of the house began to feel like they were closing in. He told his mother he was going for a walk, a phrase that now felt like a coded request for a temporary parole. He walked the familiar route to the canal, the damp air a welcome shock to his system. The path was muddy, strewn with autumn leaves, and the water was a sheet of dull, green-grey glass. He felt a flicker of something approaching peace, the simple, physical act of walking a relief from the static tension of the house. As he rounded a bend, he saw a familiar figure leaning against the lock gates, hunched over a rolling cigarette. It was Ben, the junior waiter from The Gilded Fork. He looked up as Arthur approached, his usual grunt of recognition replaced by a wide, slightly incredulous grin. \"Bloody hell. Arthur. It's you,\" he said, shaking his head in disbelief. \"What are you doing back here? Thought you'd be off in London, living it up with supermodels.\" The casual, good-natured comment highlighted the immense, unbridgeable gulf that now existed between them. \"Just back for a bit,\" Arthur said, his voice quiet. \"To work.\" Ben just laughed, a short, sharp bark. \"Work? Blimey. Bet it beats crumbing down Table 7 after the Albrights have been in, eh? Listen, mate, well done. Seriously. We all had a tenner on you. Henderson almost smiled when you won.\" The mundane detail, the mention of Mr Henderson\u2019s near-smile, was a message from a world he had lost forever. He was no longer a part of that world; he was just a story they told there now.\n\nThat evening, the quiet of the house felt different. The initial shock of his return had subsided, leaving behind a fragile, unspoken truce. They sat in front of the television, the familiar glow a comfort, but an undercurrent of tension hummed beneath the surface of the cheerful game show. Elsie kept glancing at him when she thought he wasn't looking, her maternal radar scanning him for cracks, for any sign of the desolate man who had appeared on her doorstep that morning. He knew he was being monitored, and the knowledge forced him to hold himself in a state of careful, casual composure, his posture relaxed, his expression placid. It was the hardest performance yet, requiring a constant, draining vigilance. During a commercial break, his phone vibrated in his pocket. He glanced at the screen. It was a text from Chloe. \u2018Okay, I\u2019ve found a potential studio for you just outside Preston. Decent gear. Engineer is a good lad. I\u2019m sending him your number. Expect a call tomorrow. We need to keep this train on the tracks, Arthur.\u2019 He read the message and a cold, heavy resignation settled over him. He had run two hundred miles, but the leash was still around his neck. He hadn\u2019t escaped. He had simply been relocated to a larger, more familiar-looking cage. He slipped the phone back into his pocket, the screen going dark, and turned his attention back to the television, where a woman had just won a speedboat, her shrieks of manufactured joy a hollow echo of his own."

In that time, Arthur existed in a state of suspended animation, a quiet limbo where the demands of his future had not yet caught up with the wreckage of his present. He moved through the small house like a convalescent, his actions slow and deliberate, his words carefully measured. He helped his mother with the washing up, he read the newspaper from cover to cover, and he sat in his bedroom, staring at the blank page of his notebook, the pen a cold, alien object in his hand. He was performing the role of a man at rest, a man reconnecting with his roots, and the performance was so convincing that, for brief, fleeting moments, he almost believed it himself. The quiet rhythm of his old life was a powerful opiate, dulling the sharp edges of his anxiety, and he allowed himself to sink into it, knowing it could not last.\n\nThe phone call came on Wednesday morning, as he was drying a plate his mother had just washed. The ringtone, a generic chime he had never bothered to change, was a shrill, unwelcome intrusion into the domestic harmony of clinking crockery and running water. The name on the screen was unknown, but the number was local. His heart sank with a dull, heavy finality. He answered, his voice a cautious murmur. The voice on the other end was cheerful, practical, and laced with the broad, friendly vowels of North Lancashire. \u201cIs that Arthur Penhaligon? It\u2019s Kev from Keystone Sound. Chloe from your label gave me a bell. Said you were looking for a place to lay some vocals down. We\u2019re just off the M61 near Preston. Dead easy to find. When d\u2019you fancy popping over to see if the place suits?\u201d\n\nThe mundane, business-like words were a death sentence for his brief illusion of escape. The machinery of his new life had located him, its gears grinding inexorably back into motion. Kev spoke of soundproofing and microphone choices, of getting a \u201cnice, warm, honest vocal sound,\u201d and the language was so different from Julian\u2019s talk of \u2018truth\u2019 and \u2018pain\u2019 that it was almost disorienting. This was a man who saw singing as a technical problem to be solved, not a soul to be flayed. \u201cTomorrow?\u201d Arthur heard himself say, the word coming out as a flat, toneless statement. \u201cYeah, I could do tomorrow.\u201d The appointment was made for eleven a.m. He ended the call and placed the phone on the counter, staring at its dark, blank screen. He had run home to find himself, and now London was sending a satellite office to his doorstep to ensure he remained lost.\n\nHe broke the news to his mother over a cup of tea, carefully framing it as a triumph, a sign that things were moving forward. \u201cThey\u2019ve found me a studio, Mam,\u201d he said, focusing his gaze on the swirling tea leaves in his mug. \u201cA local place, near Preston. So I can get back to work properly. Chloe arranged it all.\u201d Elsie\u2019s reaction was a complex cocktail of emotions. He saw the pride in her eyes at the efficiency of his new, powerful employers, the people who could arrange a recording studio with a single phone call. He saw the relief that he was engaging with the world again, that her son was not simply retreating into a silent, sad shell. But underneath it all, he saw the faint, unmistakable flicker of disappointment. Her convalescent was being discharged. Her boy was leaving again, even if only for the day. \u201cOh, that\u2019s wonderful, love,\u201d she said, her smile not quite reaching her eyes. \u201cSo soon! They don\u2019t let the grass grow under your feet, do they? You\u2019ll be driving, then. I\u2019ll make you up a flask. And some sandwiches. You can\u2019t rely on garage food.\u201d\n\nThe next morning, he found himself behind the wheel of his old Fiesta, the engine turning over with a familiar, grumpy cough. The journey was short, a twenty-minute drive down a motorway he had once seen as a ribbon of terror. Now, it was just a commute. He was a working man again, but the nature of his work was a grotesque parody of his former life. He wasn\u2019t going to wait on tables or polish cutlery; he was going to a small room to professionally re-enact his own sorrow. The absurdity of it was overwhelming. He passed a sign for a garden centre, a delivery lorry for a bakery, the mundane components of a world he no longer understood. He was a man with two lives, and he was beginning to feel that he wasn\u2019t truly living in either of them.\n\nKeystone Sound was located on a small, dreary industrial estate, squeezed between a wholesale plumbing supplier and a garage that specialised in van repairs. The name was painted in peeling blue letters on the corrugated iron door of a featureless breeze-block unit. There was no curated cool here, no sense of it being a creative Mecca. It was a place of work, as glamorous as a laundrette. Arthur parked his tired red car next to a greasy-looking white transit van and felt a profound sense of dislocation. He had sung in a multi-million-pound television studio, he had recorded in a legendary London mews, and now he was here, in a shed in an industrial estate, to try and manufacture a masterpiece. He took a deep breath, the air smelling of diesel fumes and damp concrete, and knocked on the corrugated door.\n\nThe man who opened it was exactly as his voice had suggested. Kev was in his fifties, with a kind, weathered face, a receding hairline, and a faded t-shirt for a band Arthur had never heard of. He greeted Arthur with a firm handshake and a warm, uncomplicated smile. \u201cArthur! Come on in, mate. Welcome to the palace.\u201d The studio, or \u2018the palace\u2019, was one large, cluttered room, with a vocal booth, no bigger than a wardrobe, built into one corner. It was a chaotic jungle of wires, microphone stands, and precariously stacked effects units. It smelled of soldering fumes, stale coffee, and dust. Kev was immensely proud of it. He showed Arthur his favourite vintage compressor, his collection of microphones, his mixing desk that he had bought second-hand from a studio in Manchester. He was a craftsman, a man who loved the tools of his trade. Arthur found himself liking him immediately, and the feeling filled him with a quiet dread.\n\nHe was ushered into the tiny vocal booth. It was claustrophobic, the foam-lined walls pressing in on him. Kev handed him a pair of headphones and gave him a cheerful thumbs-up through the small, thick glass window. \u201cRight then, Arthur. Chloe sent the backing track over. \u2018Ghost of a Footprint\u2019, it\u2019s called. Lovely tune. Let\u2019s just do a level check, and then we\u2019ll go for a take. Just give it what you\u2019ve got, lad.\u201d Arthur put on the headphones. The familiar, melancholic piano melody began to play, a sound he now associated with the subtle art of emotional self-harm. He closed his eyes, preparing himself, waiting for the familiar descent into the darkness. He summoned the images, the memories, the feelings. But nothing happened. Here, in this cramped, stuffy box, with the friendly, no-nonsense face of Kev beaming at him from the other side of the glass, the ghosts refused to appear. His grand, internal tragedy felt stagey and ridiculous. The raw pain that had been so readily accessible in the pressurised environment of London was gone, leaving only a hollow echo.\n\nHe sang, but the voice that came out was thin, controlled, and utterly devoid of the \u2018beautiful sadness\u2019 that was his one marketable asset. It was the voice of Arthur Penhaligon, the waiter, doing a competent but uninspired job. When the song finished, Kev\u2019s voice crackled in the headphones, bright and enthusiastic. \u201cSmashing, mate! Got it in one! Sounding absolutely spot on. Great pitch. We\u2019ll get another one down just for safety, but honestly, that\u2019s a beauty. Nice and clean.\u201d Kev, the craftsman, had heard a clean take, a professional vocal, and considered the job done. He had no idea he had just witnessed a catastrophic failure of the product line. Arthur stood in the silent, stuffy booth, his heart pounding a slow, heavy rhythm of panic. \u201cIt\u2019s not right,\u201d Arthur said into the microphone, his voice barely a whisper. \u201cIt needs more\u2026 emotion.\u201d\n\nKev\u2019s face, seen through the glass, registered a flicker of good-natured confusion. \u201cEmotion? Right. You want me to push the reverb up a bit on the cans? Give it a bit more of a \u2018live room\u2019 feel for you?\u201d He was offering a technical solution to an existential problem. Arthur realised, with a sickening clarity, the futility of his situation. He couldn\u2019t ask this kind, practical man to help him sound more heartbroken. He couldn\u2019t explain that his job was not to sing well, but to suffer audibly. The whole premise was so monstrous, so insane, that it couldn\u2019t be spoken aloud, not here, not to a man like Kev. \u201cNo,\u201d Arthur said, his voice flat with defeat. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. Let\u2019s just\u2026 do another one.\u201d They recorded three more takes, each one as technically proficient and emotionally bankrupt as the first. The session was a disaster.\n\nThe drive back to Lancaster was a journey into a new circle of hell. He had fled London because the process of performing his sadness was destroying him. Now, he had discovered something even worse: he couldn\u2019t even do that anymore. The one terrible, dark gift he possessed had deserted him. He was a failure as a person and now, he was a failure as a product. The pressure he had tried to escape was about to return, tenfold. He was a broken instrument, a singer who could no longer produce the only note his employers wanted to hear. He pulled up outside his small, terraced house, the engine of the Fiesta sputtering into silence. He sat for a long moment, gripping the steering wheel, paralysed by a despair so profound it felt like a physical illness.\n\nHe finally forced himself out of the car and walked the short, familiar path to his front door. He turned the key and stepped inside. The house smelled of baking bread and furniture polish, the scent of his mother\u2019s love. She appeared from the living room, wiping her hands on her apron, her face alight with a hopeful, anxious smile. She had been waiting for him, the good parent waiting for their child to come home from their first day at a new job. \u201cThere you are, love!\u201d she said, her voice bright and full of a determined cheerfulness. \u201cHow did it go? A good day at the office?\u201d The simple, loving phrase, the casual reference to a normal life of work and reward, struck him with the force of a physical blow. He had to switch masks again, from the failed recording artist to the successful, hardworking son. He summoned the very last of his emotional reserves, a final, desperate act of performance. \u201cIt was great, Mam,\u201d he said, forcing a smile that felt like it was tearing his face apart. \u201cA really good, productive day.\u201d"

                                        "text": "The lie, once spoken, took on a life of its own. It sat between them at the dinner table as his mother served him a shepherd\u2019s pie made with a love so fierce it was almost a physical ingredient. It watched television with them in the evening, a third, silent presence on the sofa, its shadow falling over the cheerful inanity of a celebrity dancing competition. Arthur nodded and smiled, commented on a clumsy foxtrot or a garish costume, and all the while, he was listening to the sound of his own failure, the clean, emotionless vocal takes playing on a loop in the private, sound-proofed studio of his mind. He was a fraud twice over now, a man who could neither feel nor fake the very thing that had made him famous.\n\nThe night offered no escape, only a different kind of vigil. He lay in the narrow bed of his childhood, the familiar dip in the mattress a hollow where a more peaceful version of himself used to sleep. He stared into the darkness, his thoughts a frantic, scurrying pack of rats. He imagined Kev, the kindly engineer, emailing the audio files to London. He imagined Julian, with his soft cardigan and surgical gaze, loading the tracks, his brow furrowed in concentration. He imagined the moment the sound filled Julian\u2019s expensive studio speakers \u2013 the polite, competent, and utterly dead voice of a stranger. He imagined the silence that would follow, a silence pregnant not with awe, but with cold, commercial disappointment. He felt a bead of sweat trace a path from his temple to his jaw. He was a man on death row, waiting for the governor\u2019s call to be denied.\n\nThe next morning, he couldn\u2019t eat. His mother placed a plate of perfectly cooked bacon and eggs in front of him, her face a study in anxious care, but the food looked like wax. The smell of it made his stomach clench. \u201cYou\u2019re not eating,\u201d she stated, her voice gentle but firm. \u201cYou\u2019re wasting away to nothing. Is it the work? Are you worried?\u201d He pushed a piece of bacon around his plate with his fork. \u201cJust thinking, Mam,\u201d he said, the excuse sounding thin and worn even to his own ears. \u201cBig song. Got to get it right.\u201d He was waiting. Every time the postman walked past the window, every time a car slowed on the street, his nervous system jolted, a high-voltage shock of pure dread. He kept his phone on the table beside him, face down, as if not looking at it might prevent it from ringing.\n\nIt was just after ten o\u2019clock when it happened. The phone didn\u2019t ring; it vibrated, a low, angry buzz against the polished wood of the dining table. He saw his mother\u2019s eyes flick towards it. The name on the screen was JULIAN. His hand felt impossibly heavy as he reached for it. He stood up from the table. \u201cIt\u2019s the studio,\u201d he said, his voice a dry croak. He walked into the hallway for the illusion of privacy, his back to the living room door, his heart hammering a frantic, panicked rhythm against his ribs. He swiped to answer. \u201cJulian,\u201d he said, the name coming out as a breathless puff of air.\n\n\u201cArthur.\u201d Julian\u2019s voice was not angry. It was something far worse. It was quiet, calm, and freighted with a deep, clinical disappointment. It was the voice of a doctor contemplating a terminal diagnosis. \u201cI\u2019ve been listening to the files Kev sent over.\u201d A pause stretched, a vast, echoing canyon of silence into which Arthur felt himself falling. \u201cThey\u2019re very\u2026 clean, Arthur.\u201d The word was a masterpiece of professional understatement, a verbal stiletto slipped between his ribs. \u201cTechnically, they\u2019re perfect. Your pitch is impeccable. But you\u2019re not there. The man who sang \u2018Calon L\u00e2n\u2019 is not on these recordings. I thought being home, being back at the source, would open you up, not shut you down. What happened?\u201d\n\nArthur leaned his forehead against the cool, floral-patterned wallpaper of the hall, the receiver slick with sweat in his hand. What happened? How could he possibly explain? How could he say that the source of his art was not a wholesome connection to his roots, but a toxic, unsustainable combination of terror, guilt, and isolation that could only be brewed in the pressurised loneliness of London? How could he admit that his mother\u2019s love, the very thing he was trying to protect, was the antidote to the poison the label wanted him to bottle and sell? He had no words. He stammered, mumbled something about a new environment, about it being a first attempt. Julian let him flounder for a few seconds before cutting in, his voice losing its therapeutic softness and taking on a hard, executive edge. \u201cLook, this isn\u2019t working. It\u2019s not a question of practice, Arthur. You\u2019ve lost the frequency. And we are on a very tight schedule. Chloe and I have been discussing it. We can\u2019t afford to scrap these sessions. We have to get this back on track. Now.\u201d\n\nAnother terrible pause. Arthur held his breath, waiting for the sentence. \u201cSo,\u201d Julian continued, his voice now brisk, decisive, the voice of a man enacting a solution, \u201cif the artist can\u2019t get to the right headspace, we\u2019re going to have to bring the headspace to the artist. I\u2019m coming up to Lancaster.\u201d The words hit Arthur with the force of a physical impact. He felt the blood drain from his face. Julian. Here. In this house, with his mother, with the fake smiles and the cups of tea. The two halves of his life, the two irreconcilable realities he had been struggling to keep in separate hemispheres, were about to collide in a catastrophic, head-on crash. \u201cNo,\u201d he whispered into the phone. \u201cNo, you can\u2019t. There\u2019s no need for that. I can do it. I just need another day.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a request, Arthur,\u201d Julian said, his tone leaving no room for negotiation. \u201cIt\u2019s happening. I\u2019ve already booked my train. I\u2019ll be there this evening. I\u2019ll stay at a hotel in the city centre, and we will work at Kev\u2019s studio tomorrow. Together. We are going to find that beautiful sadness again. One way or another.\u201d The line went dead. Arthur stood frozen in the hallway, the phone still pressed to his ear, listening to the dial tone, a monotonous, mocking sound that was the new soundtrack to his life. He felt a gentle touch on his arm and he flinched, spinning around. His mother was standing there, her face a mask of love and profound concern. She had been there the whole time. \u201cWho was that, love?\u201d she asked softly, her eyes searching his. \u201cYou look like you\u2019ve seen a ghost.\u201d"
