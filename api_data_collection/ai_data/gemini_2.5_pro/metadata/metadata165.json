     "novel_text": "The scent of lemon polish and old dust was the perfume of Adebayo\u2019s life. It clung to his clothes, settled in his nostrils, and followed him home in the evenings. He pushed the heavy-duty buffer across the marble floor of The Palms Residence lobby, its drone a familiar bassline to the melody he hummed under his breath. The machine whirred, and Adebayo\u2019s voice, a low and smooth tenor, rose to fill the space, chasing the drone and dancing with the echo in the high-ceilinged emptiness. It was a gospel tune, one his mother used to sing while braiding his hair, a song about faith and mountains and the mustard seed of a dream.\n\nThe machine shuddered to a halt. In the sudden silence, his last note hung in the air, pure and clear as a drop of water.\n\n\u201cIs that you, Adebayo? Making all that racket?\u201d\n\nHe straightened up, his back protesting with a dull ache. Mrs Ede stood at the top of the grand staircase, her hands on her silk-wrapped hips, her face a mask of mild irritation. She was a woman whose wealth was as loud as the gold bangles that jangled on her wrists.\n\n\u201cSorry, Madam. Just finishing the floors.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith all that\u2026 wailing? It sounds like a sick goat.\u201d She descended the stairs, the click of her heels on the marble like a metronome counting his failings. But as she drew closer, the corner of her mouth twitched. It was a game they played. She would complain, and he would be deferential, and they would both pretend she didn't sometimes pause outside the lobby just to listen. \u201cAnyway, the lift on B-wing is making that funny noise again. Like a dying man. See to it. Mr Bankole is complaining his guests were very disturbed last night.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, Madam. Straight away.\u201d\n\nHe watched her go, a galleon in full sail, leaving a wake of expensive perfume that failed to mask the scent of polish. He leaned the buffer against a pillar and wiped a slick of sweat from his brow with the back of his hand. A sick goat. He smiled a little. He had been called worse. His voice, he knew, was not for everyone. It was not the thin, reedy pop that saturated the radio waves. It was thick, like palm wine, with a texture of harmattan dust and a warmth that came from the very centre of his chest. It was the only thing in his life that felt entirely his own. Not borrowed, not rented, not beholden to the whims of the wealthy residents of The Palms.\n\nHis own flat, a small two-room affair tacked onto the back of the main building, was a world away from the air-conditioned splendour of the lobby. Here, the air was thick with the competing smells of fried plantain and baby powder. The drone of the generator outside was the constant, rumbling heartbeat of their lives.\n\nFunke was on a mat on the floor, deftly weaving thread into a customer\u2019s hair, her fingers moving with a practiced, hypnotic speed. The customer was scrolling through her phone, oblivious. And in a cot in the corner, a small mound under a light blanket, was Amara. His Amara. His heart.\n\nFunke looked up as he entered, her eyes tired but holding a familiar light. \u201cAh, you are back. Food is on the stove.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow is she?\u201d he whispered, his gaze fixed on the cot.\n\n\u201cSleeping like the world is not on fire,\u201d Funke murmured, not missing a single twist of her fingers. \u201cMrs Ojo came to collect the stew. She said to thank you for the extra ginger.\u201d\n\nHe nodded, moving quietly towards the cot. He leaned over, his large frame casting a shadow. Amara\u2019s tiny chest rose and fell in a steady, perfect rhythm. Her face, smooshed against the mattress, was a study in serenity. He could watch her for hours. This tiny person, this miracle of flesh and blood, had reconfigured his entire universe. Every song he sang now had her face in it. Every dream of a better life had her small hand tucked inside his. He reached in and gently stroked a cheek, skin softer than any silk Mrs Ede could ever wrap herself in.\n\nLater, after the customer had left, admiring her new braids in the reflection of their small, cracked mirror, and the stew was eaten, they sat together in the near-darkness, the only light coming from the flickering screen of a small television perched on a stack of books. The generator had coughed into silence an hour ago, plunging their neighbourhood into a familiar, shared darkness.\n\n\u201cThey are advertising it again,\u201d Adebayo said, his voice low.\n\nOn the screen, bright, flashing colours exploded. A handsome host with teeth too white to be real promised \u201cA NEW LIFE! FAME! FORTUNE!\u201d It was the advert for \u2018Naija Star Voice\u2019, the biggest singing competition in the country. The screen showed clips of past winners: a young woman crying as confetti rained down, a man holding a giant cheque, a montage of studio sessions and cheering crowds. It was a fantasy packaged and sold in thirty-second bursts.\n\nFunke sighed, leaning her head against his shoulder. Her hair smelled of coconut oil. \u201cAde, please. Don\u2019t start with this thing again.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you hear them, Funke. Some of them\u2026 I can sing better than them.\u201d It sounded like boasting, and he hated it, but it was the truth. He had heard them. He had perfect pitch, a gift from God, and he could hear the slight waver, the strained high note, the lack of genuine soul.\n\n\u201cSinging in the church choir is not the same as this thing. This is for\u2026 other people. People with connections. People who can pay for votes.\u201d She shifted, her voice laced with the hard-edged pragmatism that life had taught her. \u201cWe have Amara. We have rent. My hair business is slow. We don\u2019t have time for dreams, my love. We have to be serious.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is because of Amara,\u201d he insisted, his voice rising with a passion he couldn\u2019t suppress. \u201cIt is *for* her. Imagine, Funke. Just imagine if I won. We would have our own house. A proper house, with a garden. No more generators. No more pleasing Mrs Ede. You could open your own salon, a real one, not just\u2026 here.\u201d He gestured around their cramped room, at the peeling paint and the single, buzzing lightbulb that would work again when the power returned, maybe.\n\n\u201cAnd imagine if you don\u2019t,\u201d she countered softly, her words a pinprick to his ballooning fantasy. \u201cThe money for transport to the auditions. The time off work. What will we eat? Hope?\u201d\n\nHe fell silent. She was right, of course. She was always right. Her feet were planted so firmly on the ground they seemed to have grown roots. His were always trying to float away. He looked at the television. A new contestant was singing, a girl in a glittery dress. Her voice was thin but passable. The judges, famous musicians and producers, were nodding along with serious expressions. They looked like gods on a mountain, deciding fates. Could a caretaker, a man who smelled of polish and spent his days fixing other people\u2019s problems, ever be allowed onto that mountain?\n\nThe next day, the thought was a persistent hum beneath the drone of the buffer. He scrubbed a stubborn stain on the third-floor landing, the words of a new song forming in his head. It was a song about a man with calloused hands and a voice full of unspent gold. As he worked, Mr Bankole\u2019s youngest son, a university student named Tunde, walked past, his headphones leaking the tinny beat of an Afrobeats song. Tunde paused.\n\n\u201cYo, Adebayo,\u201d he said, pulling one headphone off. \u201cIs that you I hear singing all the time?\u201d\n\nAdebayo straightened, wary. \u201cSorry, sir. I did not mean to disturb.\u201d\n\nTunde laughed, a bright, easy sound. \u201cDisturb? Man, you\u2019re good. Like, properly good. You ever think of doing something with that? For real.\u201d\n\nThe simple, unprompted praise landed in Adebayo\u2019s chest like a stone in a quiet pool. \u201cMy wife says I should be serious,\u201d he mumbled, fiddling with the handle of his mop.\n\n\u201cSerious? Bro, a voice like that is serious business! You heard about Naija Star Voice? The auditions are next week in Surulere. You should totally go.\u201d Tunde tapped his phone. \u201cLook, it\u2019s all over Insta. You\u2019d kill it.\u201d\n\nHe showed Adebayo the screen, the same flashing logo, the same impossibly white teeth of the host. But seeing it on Tunde\u2019s phone, presented as a real and achievable thing, made it seem different. Closer.\n\nThat night, after Funke and Amara were asleep, Adebayo stayed up. He took out his old smartphone, the one with a spiderweb of cracks across the screen. The Palms had Wi-Fi, a fast, unlimited connection for the residents. But if he stood in the corner of his bedroom, pressed right up against the wall that bordered the main building, he could sometimes catch a weak, stray signal. One bar. Sometimes two, if he was lucky.\n\nHe found the application page. Full Name: Adebayo Okoro. Age: 32. Occupation. He hesitated for a long time, his thumb hovering over the keypad. He could write \u2018Vocalist\u2019. \u2018Musician\u2019. But it felt like a lie. With a sigh, he typed the truth: \u2018Caretaker\u2019.\n\nHe filled out the rest of the form, his heart thumping a nervous rhythm against his ribs. He had to upload a video. He didn't have one. Panic began to prickle his skin. Then he remembered. Last Christmas, at the church\u2019s carol service, Funke\u2019s cousin had filmed his solo of \u2018O Holy Night\u2019 on her phone. He had been embarrassed, but she had sent it to him. He scrolled back through months of messages, past pictures of Amara, past shopping lists and funny videos. He found it.\n\nThe quality was poor, the sound tinny, filled with the coughs and shuffles of the congregation. But his voice, when it came, cut through the noise. It soared, filling the church, filled with a yearning and a reverence that even the tiny phone speaker could not entirely diminish. It was honest. It was him.\n\nHe attached the file. The upload bar crawled across the screen, impossibly slow. The single bar of Wi-Fi flickered, threatening to vanish. He held his breath, pressing the phone harder against the wall as if he could physically push the data through the air. The generator from the next compound over rumbled, and a dog barked somewhere in the darkness. He felt a profound and sudden loneliness, a man in a concrete box, trying to send his voice out into a world that had never asked to hear it.\n\nThe bar reached the end. \u2018Upload Complete\u2019.\n\nA new button appeared. \u2018Submit Application\u2019. His thumb trembled. He thought of Funke\u2019s tired eyes, of Amara\u2019s soft cheek, of Mrs Ede\u2019s sneer, of Tunde\u2019s easy encouragement. He thought of the smell of polish, and the ache in his back, and the unspent gold in his throat. He closed his eyes and pressed down. The screen refreshed. \u2018Thank you. Your application for Naija Star Voice has been received.\u2019\n\nHe switched off the phone and slid down the wall to the floor. In the silence of the room, he could hear two heartbeats. His own, loud and frantic. And from the cot, the slow, steady, peaceful rhythm of his daughter\u2019s sleep.The week that followed was a quiet torment. The secret sat in Adebayo\u2019s stomach like an undigested stone. At work, every drone of the buffer, every imperious summons from a resident, felt heavier. The scent of polish was no longer a perfume, but a shroud. He found himself checking his phone constantly, polishing the cracked screen with his thumb as if to clear a path for the message he yearned for. He would stand in the corner of his room late at night, a silent sentinel waiting for a single bar of Wi-Fi, only to be met with a screen full of old messages and the crushing emptiness of his inbox. He began to feel foolish. It was a lottery ticket, bought with a stolen scrap of hope. What were the chances?\n\nFunke noticed his distraction. She saw the way his eyes glazed over while he was bouncing Amara on his knee, the way he\u2019d startle when she spoke to him. She saw the new, obsessive ritual with the phone. She said nothing, but her silence was a question mark he could not answer. Her pragmatism had become a kind of fortress, and he had laid siege to it without her knowledge. The guilt was a constant, low hum, another bassline to the anxious melody in his head. He tried to compensate, working harder around their small flat, helping her more with customers, whispering compliments about her cooking. They were small offerings, apologies for a betrayal she did not even know had happened.\n\nOne sweltering afternoon, he was tasked with clearing a blockage in the drainage pipe behind the staff kitchen. The smell was foul, a thick, greasy stench of rot and old food that clung to the humid air. He worked with a plumber\u2019s snake, his shirt soaked with sweat, his knuckles scraped and raw. It was the kind of job that made him feel small and unseen, a cog in the great machine of The Palms, tasked with handling its filth. He took a break, leaning against the hot wall and pulling out his phone. He didn\u2019t expect anything. It was just a habit now, a nervous tic. He held it up high. One bar flickered into existence. And then the phone vibrated, a sharp, electric jolt against his palm.\n\nIt was an email. The sender was \u2018Naija Star Voice Auditions\u2019. His breath caught in his throat. His hands, slick with sweat and grime, trembled as he tapped the screen. The subject line read: \u2018Invitation to Preliminary Auditions\u2019. He read the first line, then read it again. \u2018Dear Adebayo Okoro, Thank you for your application. We were impressed by your submission and would like to invite you to a live audition\u2026\u2019 The words swam before his eyes. The email detailed a time and a location: a conference hall in Surulere, the following Saturday. For a moment, the stench of the drain vanished, replaced by the imaginary scent of stage lights and new clothes. He was no longer a man standing in an alley knee-deep in refuse. He was a man with an invitation. He was a man with a chance.\n\nThat evening, he could not eat. The ball of yams Funke served him sat untouched on his plate. He watched her feed Amara, mashing the soft food with a fork, her movements full of a gentle, focused love that made his secret feel like a shard of glass in his heart. The television was off. The generator was quiet. The only sounds were Amara\u2019s soft gurgles and the distant traffic on the main road. He knew he could not carry the secret any longer. It was too heavy, and too bright, to keep to himself.\n\n\u201cFunke,\u201d he began, his voice barely a whisper. She looked up, her brow furrowed with concern. He slid his cracked phone across the table. \u201cI did something.\u201d\n\nShe picked it up, her expression wary. She read the email, her eyes scanning the text once, then twice. The silence in the room stretched and tightened until Adebayo felt it might snap. When she finally looked at him, her face was unreadable, a calm sea before a storm. She placed the phone down on the table with deliberate care. \u201cSurulere,\u201d she said, her voice flat. \u201cThat is three bus changes. The transport fare alone will be half of what I made this week.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d he said, his own voice pleading. \u201cBut Funke, they chose me. They listened to the video from the church. They heard my voice and they chose me.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey chose hundreds of people, Adebayo,\u201d she countered, her pragmatism flaring like a shield. \u201cThis is how this thing works. They call everyone to a big hall, they make you wait all day in the sun, and then a junior person listens to you for thirty seconds and tells you to go home. It is a business. They are selling hope, and you are buying.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is more than hope! It is a chance!\u201d He leaned forward, his hands gripping the edge of the table. \u201cMy voice\u2026 Funke, you know my voice. It is a gift from God. What is the point of a gift if I just use it to chase echoes in an empty lobby? What if this is the door He is opening? For us. For Amara.\u201d He gestured to their daughter, now dozing in Funke\u2019s arms. \u201cI cannot spend my whole life smelling of polish and fixing rich people\u2019s toilets and tell her that I was too scared to even try.\u201d\n\nThe passion in his voice filled the small room, raw and undeniable. He saw a flicker of something in her eyes \u2013 not anger, but a deep and profound weariness. She looked from his desperate face to Amara\u2019s sleeping one. She looked around the cramped room, at the water stain on the ceiling and the single pot on the stove. This was her reality, the one she fought to hold together every single day. His dream was a wild bird that threatened to knock it all over.\n\nAfter a long moment, she let out a slow breath, the sound of a painful surrender. She reached down beside the mat where she worked and retrieved a small, knotted piece of fabric. Her \u2018emergency\u2019 savings. She began to untie the knot with her teeth, her gaze fixed on him. \u201cThe transport fare,\u201d she said, her voice low and heavy with the weight of the sacrifice. \u201cAnd enough for you to buy a bottle of water and one meat pie. Not two. One.\u201d She pulled out a few rumpled Naira notes and pushed them across the table. They lay there, a tiny, precious pile. \u201cBut you must understand this, my husband. If you go, you cannot come home and tell me about the long queue or the hot sun. You cannot come home with just a story. You go there, and you make them listen.\u201dThe morning of the audition, the air in their small room was thick with unspoken words. Adebayo woke before the first hint of dawn, his heart a frantic drum against his ribs. He slid from the mat, careful not to wake Funke, but her eyes opened in the gloom. She was already awake, and had been for some time. She said nothing, but rose and went to a small trunk in the corner. From it, she pulled his best shirt, a white button-down, now slightly greyed with age but impeccably clean and pressed. The sharp creases from the iron were lines of her reluctant blessing. She had also polished his only pair of good shoes, the leather worn but now gleaming with a dull shine. The gesture was more eloquent than any speech. It said, *I do not believe in this fairytale, but I will not have you looking like a fool while you chase it.*\n\nHe dressed in silence, the starched cotton of the shirt a strange armour against his skin. Before he left, he leaned over Amara\u2019s cot. Her breath was a faint, sweet whisper in the stillness. He laid his large, calloused hand on her back, feeling the delicate flutter of her tiny lungs. This was the reason. This small, sleeping soul was the entire purpose. He could not fail her by not trying. When he turned to the door, Funke was there, holding out a small nylon sack containing his polished shoes and the bottle of water. Their eyes met. \u201cDon\u2019t let the sun cook your brain,\u201d she said, her voice soft. It was the closest she could come to saying \u2018good luck\u2019. He nodded, took the bag, and slipped out into the pre-dawn darkness, the crumpled Naira notes a hot, secret weight in his pocket.\n\nThe journey to Surulere was a descent into the city\u2019s roaring, waking heart. The first danfo bus was a metal box of stale air and crushed bodies, the conductor hanging from the open door, shouting destinations into the din of horns and market traders. Adebayo stood, crammed between a woman with a basket of live chickens and a young man with headphones blasting tinny music. The smells of exhaust, dust, and sweat were a world away from the sterile lemon polish of The Palms. He kept his head down, his lips moving silently, rehearsing the verses of the gospel tune his mother used to sing. It was a song about moving mountains, and right now, the city itself felt like a mountain range he had to cross. Each bus change was a new level of chaos, a new test of his resolve, pushing him further from the quiet predictability of his life.\n\nBy the time he arrived at the conference hall, the sun was a hot weight in the sky and the street was a river of people. It was exactly as Funke had described, but a thousand times more overwhelming. There were thousands of them, a vibrant, noisy, desperate sea of hopefuls. They spilled from the gates, lining the walls, sitting on curbs, each one clutching a piece of paper and a dream. He saw young girls in shimmering, tight dresses, men with sculpted beards and designer sunglasses, people with guitars strapped to their backs, entire families who had come to support their one shining star. The air thrummed with a nervous, competitive energy. It was a marketplace of voices, everyone trying to sell themselves. Adebayo, in his simple white shirt, holding his nylon sack, felt his carefully constructed courage begin to fray. He was a caretaker. A cleaner of floors. What was he doing here among these peacocks?\n\nHe found the end of a queue that snaked around the block, and after an hour of shuffling forward, a harried-looking official thrust a piece of paper with the number \u2018743\u2019 scrawled on it into his hand. Seven hundred and forty-three. He was just a number. He found a sliver of shade against a wall and sat down for the long wait. The sun climbed higher, beating down on the pavement. He watched as the day wore on, as the initial excitement of the crowd soured into tired frustration. He saw people practicing, their voices straining against the noise of the city. He saw others arguing, their nerves shot. He saw a young woman burst into tears after emerging from the hall, her brief, thirty-second chance already over. He clutched his number, the paper growing damp in his sweaty palm.\n\nTo pass the time, and to silence the growing voice of doubt in his head, he bought his single meat pie and ate it slowly, piece by tiny piece, making it last. He drank his water in small, careful sips. He was not here as a dreamer, he told himself. He was here as a worker. Funke\u2019s investment was in his pocket, and this waiting, this heat, this crushing anonymity, was the labour. His job was to endure. He closed his eyes, shutting out the sea of faces. He tuned out the cacophony of competing melodies. He went to that quiet place inside himself, the high-ceilinged lobby of his memory, and let his own song rise, silently, in his chest. He wasn't Adebayo Okoro, number 743. He was a man with a voice full of unspent gold, and he had come to make them listen.Hours bled into one another under the oppressive sun. Adebayo\u2019s white shirt was now mapped with sweat stains, and his initial resolve had been baked into a dull, throbbing patience. He watched numbers being called in blocks, the hopefuls surging forward like a tide, only to ebb back out minutes later, most with their shoulders slumped and their dreams extinguished. The sun began its slow descent, painting the dusty sky in hues of orange and purple, and a cold knot of dread formed in his stomach. He had waited all day. Had they forgotten his batch? Had his number been a mistake? Funke\u2019s words about coming home with just a story echoed in his mind, sharp and painful. He was just about to accept defeat, to gather his things for the long, shaming journey home, when a voice, strained through a cheap megaphone, crackled through the weary crowd.\n\n\u201cNumbers 740 through 760! To Gate C! Final call, Gate C!\u201d\n\nA jolt went through Adebayo, sharp as an electric shock. He scrambled to his feet, his joints protesting. 743. He was 743. He joined the last, ragged group of hopefuls, a collection of the day\u2019s most resilient or most desperate, and was herded through a side door into the blessed cool of an air-conditioned hallway. The sudden change in temperature was dizzying. After the vibrant chaos outside, the inside was sterile and silent. They were lined up against a wall, a row of wilted flowers waiting for inspection. One by one, they were called into a plain, unmarked door at the end of the corridor.\n\nWhen the door opened and a dejected-looking boy with a guitar slouched out, a woman with a clipboard called, \u201cNumber 743.\u201d Adebayo\u2019s heart leaped into his throat. He smoothed his damp shirt, took a deep breath that did nothing to calm him, and walked into the room. It was small and stark, dominated by a long table behind which sat three people. They were not the gods from the television. They were their weary, mortal underlings. One was a young woman who looked bored, her chin propped on her hand as she scrolled through her phone. In the middle sat a man with glasses and a serious, pinched expression, a pen poised over a notepad. The third was a sharp-featured woman in a colourful blazer, her eyes sweeping over Adebayo with an air of instant dismissal, cataloguing his worn shoes, his simple shirt, his age. She was the one looking for a product to sell.\n\n\u201cName?\u201d the man in the middle asked, not looking up.\n\n\u201cAdebayo Okoro.\u201d\n\n\u201cOccupation?\u201d\n\nAdebayo hesitated for only a fraction of a second. He would not lie. \u201cCaretaker,\u201d he said, his voice quiet but firm. The woman in the blazer raised a perfectly sculpted eyebrow. The bored girl didn't look up from her phone.\n\n\u201cOkay, Caretaker Adebayo,\u201d the man said, a hint of tired irony in his tone. \u201cWhat will you be singing for us today?\u201d\n\n\u201cA gospel song,\u201d Adebayo said. \u201c\u2018The Mountain of Faith\u2019.\u201d\n\nThe woman in the blazer sighed audibly. \u201cAnother one. Original?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, ma. It is an old song. My mother\u2019s song.\u201d\n\n\u201cThirty seconds. Go,\u201d the man said, clicking his pen.\n\nAdebayo planted his worn shoes on the floor, feeling the solid ground beneath him. He closed his eyes, shutting out their tired faces, the sterile room, the crushing weight of their judgment. He was not in Surulere. He was back in the echoing lobby of The Palms, his voice chasing the drone of the buffer. He was a small boy in a quiet village, his mother\u2019s fingers braiding his hair as she sang of faith. He drew a breath, not of air, but of memory and hope, and opened his mouth.\n\nThe first note was low and smooth, thick like palm wine, emerging not from his throat but from the very centre of his chest. It didn\u2019t just enter the room; it filled it, pushing into the corners, warming the cold air, silencing the tap-tap-tap of the bored girl\u2019s finger on her phone screen. He sang of mountains and mustard seeds, of weary hands and unwavering belief. His voice, unadorned by any instrument, was an orchestra in itself. It carried the texture of harmattan dust, the warmth of a cooking fire, the profound, resonant ache of a life lived with more hardship than hope. It was a voice that knew labour and loss, but soared with a spirit that refused to be broken.\n\nHe saw the bored girl\u2019s phone slip from her hand, landing on the table with a soft clatter. He saw the man in the middle put his pen down, his glasses sliding to the tip of his nose, his mouth slightly agape. He saw the woman in the blazer lean forward, her mask of commercial assessment cracking, replaced by an expression of pure, unadulterated shock. He sang past the thirty-second mark, past the one-minute mark. No one stopped him. He poured all the unspent gold of his life into that small room\u2014the love for Funke, the fierce adoration for Amara, the years of quiet humiliation, the stubborn, secret pride in his gift. He finished the song, his last note hanging in the air, pure and clear as a drop of water, just as it had in the lobby.\n\nIn the sudden, deafening silence that followed, the three judges simply stared at him. The man in the middle was the first to speak, his voice a stunned croak. \u201cWhere did you learn to sing like that?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe church choir, sir. And my mother,\u201d Adebayo answered, his heart still hammering.\n\n\u201cAdebayo Okoro,\u201d the woman in the blazer said, her sharp tone now softened with disbelief. She picked up a sheet of paper from a pile. \u201cYou\u2019re the caretaker from The Palms Residence who sent in the \u2018O Holy Night\u2019 video.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a question. She remembered.\n\nHe just nodded, unable to speak.\n\nThe man in the middle looked at his colleagues. \u201cThat\u2026 that was not what I was expecting.\u201d He turned back to Adebayo, his eyes serious and intent. \u201cYour voice has character, Mr. Okoro. It has a story. That is rare.\u201d He scribbled something on a small yellow slip of paper and pushed it across the table. It slid to a stop just in front of Adebayo. \u201cDon\u2019t be late. And don\u2019t wear that shirt.\u201d\n\nAdebayo looked down. On the slip were an address for a studio on Victoria Island, a date for the following week, and the words \u2018CALLBACK \u2013 STAGE 2\u2019. It was real. A tangible piece of paper that held the weight of a possible future. He picked it up, his fingers trembling, and folded it carefully, reverently, before placing it in his pocket next to the now-spent Naira notes from Funke.\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d he whispered, his voice hoarse. \u201cThank you, sir. Thank you, ma.\u201d\n\nHe backed out of the room, nodding his gratitude. As he closed the door behind him, he heard the woman in the blazer say to the others, her voice a mixture of confusion and excitement, \u201cCan you believe that? A caretaker. What on earth are we going to do with him?\u201d Adebayo didn\u2019t wait to hear the answer. He walked down the empty corridor and out into the cool night air, the yellow slip in his pocket feeling warmer and heavier than any gold.The journey home was the inverse of the one that morning. The city, which had felt like an adversary, a mountain of concrete and noise designed to crush him, now seemed to pulse with a shared, secret energy. The lights of the danfo buses streaking through the darkness were not just signs of traffic but bursts of confetti. The cacophony of horns and distant music was no longer a din but a city-wide orchestra playing a chaotic, vibrant overture just for him. Adebayo sat with his back pressed against the vibrating metal wall of the bus, his hand in his pocket, his fingers tracing the sharp, folded edges of the yellow slip. He kept pulling it out under the dim interior light, rereading the words\u2014\u2018CALLBACK \u2013 STAGE 2\u2019, \u2018Victoria Island\u2019\u2014as if they might vanish. They were coordinates to a new world, a place he had only ever seen from the outside, a mythical island of glass towers and impossible wealth where men like him only went to serve. Now, he had been invited to perform.\n\nHe walked the final stretch to The Palms through the deep, familiar darkness of his neighbourhood, the generator silence a blanket over the huddled buildings. He could feel the exhaustion deep in his bones, but beneath it, a current of pure adrenaline hummed. He was no longer just tired; he was spent, emptied of all the anxiety and filled with a terrifying, brilliant hope. He knew Funke would be waiting, her silence a heavier judgment than any of the judges could have mustered. He rehearsed his speech, his great victory announcement, but the words felt hollow and boastful. He had no story to tell her, not in words. He only had the proof. When he pushed open their door, the room was lit by a single candle, its flame dancing in the faint breeze from the window. Funke was sitting on the mat, not braiding hair or sleeping, but simply waiting, her back ramrod straight. In the flickering light, her face was a mask of exhausted patience. She didn't ask a question; her eyes asked everything.\n\nHe didn\u2019t speak. He walked past her, placing his nylon sack on the floor and leaning down to check on Amara, his ritual of arrival. The baby was a peaceful lump in the darkness, her scent of powder and milk a grounding anchor. Then he turned back to his wife. He sat down heavily on the floor opposite her, the candle between them. He reached into his pocket and took out the yellow slip, a bright flag of surrender in the dim light. He unfolded it and pushed it across the mat towards her. Her eyes followed the paper, then flickered to his face, searching for the punchline. Seeing none, she picked it up, her calloused fingertips handling it as if it might be coated in poison or pixie dust. She angled it towards the candlelight, her lips moving silently as she read the words. \u2018Victoria Island\u2019. He saw her shoulders, so tense just a moment before, slump with an imperceptible weight. It was not the happy collapse of relief, but the heavy surrender to a new, more complicated reality.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t wear that shirt,\u201d she whispered, her voice rough. She wasn\u2019t looking at him, but at the yellow paper, her mind already racing miles ahead of the moment, calculating costs and impossibilities. \u201cThey told you not to wear your best shirt. So what will you wear, Adebayo? A shirt made of hope?\u201d She looked up at him then, and for the first time, he saw past the fortress of her pragmatism. He saw the flicker of fear, the terror of believing in something that could so easily be snatched away, leaving them with less than they had before. He saw the tiny, almost imperceptible gleam of pride she was trying so desperately to suppress. He reached across the small space between them and covered her hand, the one holding the slip, with his own. \u201cWe will find a way,\u201d he said, and for the first time, it didn\u2019t feel like a hollow promise. It felt like a plan.\n\nThe next day at The Palms was a study in surrealism. The lobby floor was just as vast, the marble just as cold, the scent of lemon polish just as pervasive. But Adebayo felt as though he were moving through it all behind a pane of glass. He was a man with a secret. The imperious commands of the residents, the drone of the buffer, the familiar ache in his back\u2014it all seemed like a role he was playing in a film about his old life. He saw Mrs Ede sailing down the grand staircase, a scowl already forming on her face as she prepared to lodge a complaint, and for the first time, he felt not a flicker of intimidation, only a distant pity. Her world was so loud and yet so small, confined by the walls of this building. His was about to crack wide open. He met her gaze, offered a small, polite nod, and kept polishing, humming his tune a little louder than usual. The sound wasn\u2019t a nervous habit anymore; it was a rehearsal.\n\nLater that afternoon, while he was replacing a faulty light fixture in the B-wing corridor, Tunde jogged past, headphones in place. He skidded to a halt, reversing a few steps to look at Adebayo up on the stepladder. He pulled his headphones down around his neck. \"So? Don't leave me hanging, man! Did you go? How was it?\" Adebayo paused, screwdriver in hand, and a wide, genuine smile broke across his face, the first one he\u2019d allowed himself all day. He felt a rush of gratitude for the young man\u2019s easy, uncomplicated belief in him. \u201cI went,\u201d he said, his voice low, conspiratorial. \u201cThey\u2026 they want to see me again.\u201d Tunde\u2019s eyes went wide. \u201cNo way! A callback? Bro, that\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about! That is sick! Stage two?\u201d Adebayo nodded, and Tunde let out a whoop, slapping the wall in his excitement. \u201cI knew it! My guy! The voice of The Palms! What did they say? What do you need?\u201d\n\nThe genuine joy on Tunde\u2019s face was a balm. Here was someone who saw only the victory, not the problems it created. The judge\u2019s dismissive words came back to him. \u201cThey told me not to wear my shirt,\u201d Adebayo confessed, a little embarrassed. Tunde frowned, looking at Adebayo\u2019s uniform. \u201cYour work shirt? Nah, you can\u2019t wear that. And your Sunday best is a bit\u2026 formal. You need to look like an artist, man. Cool, but humble. Like, effortlessly cool.\u201d Tunde tapped his chin, his mind already working. \u201cOkay, look. This is a problem we can solve. My wardrobe is your wardrobe. We are not the same size, not even close,\u201d he said, grinning at Adebayo\u2019s broad shoulders, \u201cbut my cousin, Dele, he\u2019s a big guy. Plays rugby. And he thinks he\u2019s a fashion icon. Let me make a call. We\u2019re going to get you a shirt, Adebayo. We are going to get you a killer shirt.\u201dThe next evening, after his shift, Tunde intercepted him by the service entrance. \"Operation Killer Shirt is a go,\" he whispered, a conspiratorial grin splitting his face. He led Adebayo not to his own apartment, but up in the silent, carpeted lift to the penthouse suite, a realm Adebayo had only ever glimpsed when called to fix a leak. The door opened onto a space so vast and white it felt like stepping into a cloud. Floor-to-ceiling windows revealed the whole of Lagos glittering below, a carpet of jewels laid at their feet. Tunde\u2019s cousin, Dele, a mountain of a man with a surprisingly gentle smile, was waiting. Laid out on a sprawling white leather sofa were several shirts that cost more than Adebayo\u2019s monthly salary. They were made of linen and soft, brushed cotton in muted, earthy tones. Tunde held one up, a dark olive green shirt made of a fabric that seemed to drink the light. \u201cThis is the one,\u201d he declared. \u201cIt says \u2018I have soul, but I\u2019m not trying too hard.\u2019\u201d Adebayo touched the fabric, his calloused fingers snagging slightly on the perfect weave. It felt impossibly soft. He felt a deep, squirming discomfort, the familiar unease of a man who polishes floors being dressed up by the men who walk on them. \u201cI cannot accept this,\u201d he mumbled, his eyes on the floor. Dele clapped a heavy hand on his shoulder. \u201cNonsense, man. It\u2019s just a shirt. A voice like yours deserves a good shirt. Go on, try it. We\u2019re brothers in this now.\u201d\n\nHe carried the shirt home folded carefully in a glossy shopping bag, the crisp paper a foreign object in his world of nylon sacks and reused containers. He presented it to Funke with a nervous pride, pulling it from its tissue-paper nest like a magician revealing a dove. She felt the fabric, her fingers, so attuned to texture, immediately recognizing its quality. Her face, which had been cautiously hopeful, hardened. \u201cWhere did you get this?\u201d she asked, her voice dangerously quiet. \u201cIt was a gift. From Mr. Tunde and his cousin.\u201d He tried to sound casual, but the words came out sounding defensive. Funke dropped the shirt onto the mat as if it were burning her. \u201cA gift,\u201d she repeated, the word tasting like ash in her mouth. \u201cSo now you are their project? Their little charity case? The singing caretaker they can dress up and show off? Adebayo, do you not see? This is just another chain, a softer one, but a chain all the same. They own the building you clean, they own the flat you sleep in, and now they want to own your voice too?\u201d Her words were sharp, each one a perfectly aimed dart hitting the exact centre of his own buried fears. \u201cIt is not like that, Funke!\u201d he protested, his voice rising. \u201cHe is helping me. He believes in me.\u201d \u201cHe believes in a good story!\u201d she shot back, her eyes flashing. \u201cAnd when the story is over? When they are bored? They will take back their shirt and you will be left with nothing but the smell of polish. We have Amara. We have our dignity. Do not trade it for a borrowed shirt.\u201d\n\nThe argument left a ringing silence in the small room that lasted for days. The olive-green shirt hung from a nail on the wall, a silent, beautiful accusation. It represented everything that was pulling them apart: his soaring, reckless hope and her fierce, grounded fear. Adebayo found himself caught in the crossfire of his own heart. When he was at work, buffing the floors, Tunde\u2019s confident optimism felt real and attainable. But when he was home, in the small space held together by Funke\u2019s tireless labour, her warnings felt like prophecy. He would watch her braiding hair, her face a mask of concentration, and feel a pang of guilt so sharp it stole his breath. He was gambling with her peace, with their fragile stability. Then he would look at Amara, sleeping in her cot, and the fear would be replaced by a different, more powerful urgency. He had to do this *for* her, to give her a world larger than this one-room life, a world without the constant, rumbling drone of a generator. The night before the callback, he lay awake on the mat, staring at the silhouette of the shirt against the wall. It was a flag from a foreign country, and he was about to sail into its waters, leaving the only shore he had ever known behind.\n\nVictoria Island was another planet. The air itself seemed different, thinner, cleaner, smelling of money and sea salt instead of dust and exhaust. The studio was an imposing structure of dark glass and brushed steel, a place so intimidatingly modern that Adebayo almost turned around. He clutched the address on the yellow slip, his only proof that he belonged here. Inside, the cool air hummed with a low, professional buzz. The other contestants waiting in the sleek lobby were nothing like the desperate crowd in Surulere. They were a handful of exquisitely beautiful, unnervingly confident people who looked like they had been born for a stage. They chatted easily with each other, name-dropping producers and vocal coaches. Adebayo sat alone in a leather chair that was too soft, the borrowed shirt feeling both too tight around his shoulders and too loose around his spirit. He was acutely aware of his worn shoes, of his calloused hands, of the faint, imaginary scent of lemon polish that he was sure clung to him like a second skin. He was an impostor, and he knew it was only a matter of time before everyone else did too.\n\n\u201cAdebayo Okoro!\u201d The voice belonged to a brisk young woman with a headset. It was his turn. He followed her down a corridor and through a heavy door that opened onto a vast, dark space. He was on a stage. It wasn\u2019t a room; it was a proper stage, a circle of blinding white light surrounded by an intimidating darkness. He could just make out the long table from the television adverts, and behind it, the silhouettes of the three celebrity judges. He recognised the sharp, elegant profile of Zara Kalu, the legendary producer; the relaxed, cool posture of Femi \u2018Rhymz\u2019 Adeoye, the country\u2019s biggest Afrobeats star; and the severe, upright figure of Chief Obinna, the notoriously blunt owner of the record label sponsoring the show. The handsome host stepped into the light, his white teeth gleaming. \u201cAnd here we have Adebayo Okoro!\u201d the host announced to the empty, cavernous space. \u201cHe keeps the floors shining at The Palms Residence, but today he wants to see if he can shine on our stage! A big hand for our singing caretaker!\u201d The patronizing introduction landed like a blow, but Adebayo barely registered it. His eyes were fixed on the judges, on those three fates who held his future in their hands.\n\n\u201cMr. Okoro,\u201d Chief Obinna\u2019s voice boomed through the speakers, deep and devoid of warmth. \u201cThe preliminary judges seemed to think you were special. I am rarely impressed. Do not waste my time. Sing.\u201d The command was a bucket of ice water. For a terrifying second, Adebayo\u2019s mind went blank. The song he had prepared vanished. His throat closed up. He could feel the borrowed shirt sticking to his back, the weight of Funke\u2019s fears, Tunde\u2019s expectations, and his own desperate yearning pressing down on his chest. He was going to fail. The silence stretched. Zara Kalu leaned forward, a flicker of impatience in her eyes. He was losing them. He closed his eyes, and in the blinding whiteness behind his eyelids, he saw a single, clear image: Amara\u2019s face, smooshed against her mattress in serene sleep. A breath entered his lungs. He would not sing for the judges. He would sing for her. He opened his mouth and what came out was a lullaby, a simple Yoruba folk song his grandmother used to sing, one he now sang to Amara.\n\nIt wasn't a song of power or glory. It was a melody of profound, heartbreaking tenderness. His voice, stripped of all artifice, became a vessel for pure, unvarnished love. It was the sound of a father\u2019s devotion, a promise whispered in the dark. It spoke of protection, of safety, of a world made gentle for a beloved child. The voice that had filled a church and silenced a waiting room now created an incredible intimacy in the vast, empty studio. It drew the darkness in, transforming the intimidating stage into a sacred space, a father\u2019s quiet bedside. He poured every drop of his love for his daughter, his guilt and hope for Funke, his entire being into the simple, ancient melody.\n\nHe finished the song on a note so soft it was almost a sigh, a perfect, gentle fade into silence. He opened his eyes, blinking against the lights, his heart pounding. The studio was utterly still. He could see the judges\u2019 faces more clearly now. Femi Rhymz was leaning back, his head tilted, a look of quiet wonder on his face. Zara Kalu was staring at him, her famously critical mask completely gone, replaced by something soft and deeply moved. It was Chief Obinna who leaned forward, his elbows on the table, his fingertips steepled in front of him. He stared at Adebayo for a long, unreadable moment, the silence stretching until it was almost unbearable. Finally, he reached for his microphone, the click echoing through the studio. \u201cMr. Okoro,\u201d he began, his voice a low, serious rumble. \u201cI have one question for you.\u201dAdebayo\u2019s mind, which had been soaring in the quiet, sacred space of his lullaby, came crashing back to earth. The question was not about his voice, his pitch, or his performance. It was a question about his life, a direct echo of Funke\u2019s most profound fears, now spoken in a deep, booming voice from the darkness. He felt the soft linen of the borrowed shirt, suddenly heavy and foreign against his skin. This man was not asking about a song; he was asking for a soul.\n\nHe took a breath, the harsh stage lights hot on his face. He had no prepared answer, no slick retort polished by a media coach. He only had the truth, a thing as plain and worn as his own hands. \u201cNo, sir,\u201d he said, his voice quiet but steady, the honesty of the admission silencing the vast room. \u201cI have no idea. I have never been in this industry. I only know the industry of polish and leaking pipes. I know what it is to work for sixteen hours and have barely enough to buy medicine for my child. I know the demand of a boss who thinks my voice is the wailing of a sick goat. I know the shame of not having enough.\u201d He looked past the blinding lights, trying to find the Chief\u2019s eyes in the gloom. \u201cYou ask me what this industry will demand, and I tell you, I do not know. But I cannot imagine it will demand more than my current life already takes. If sacrifice is the price, then my whole life has been a down payment.\u201d\n\nA profound silence followed his words. In that quiet, Femi Rhymz slowly began to clap. It wasn\u2019t a loud, performative applause, but a soft, rhythmic beat of respect. Zara Kalu, who had built a career on spotting commercial appeal, looked at Chief Obinna, her expression a complex mixture of commercial calculation and genuine awe. This was more than a voice. This was a narrative. This was a man an entire nation could root for. The Chief, however, remained unmoved, his face a mask of stone. He let the silence stretch, a tool he often used to break lesser men. Adebayo stood his ground, his heart hammering but his gaze unwavering.\n\nFinally, Chief Obinna leaned into his microphone again, his voice a low rumble that seemed to shake the very floor of the stage. \u201cThis industry chews up young boys who want fame and spits them out as forgotten men. It has less experience with men who have something to fight for.\u201d He paused, his dark eyes boring into Adebayo. \u201cWe will see which one you are.\u201d He made a small, almost imperceptible gesture to the host. The host, his professional smile back in place, stepped forward. \u201cChief Obinna, the deciding vote\u2026?\u201d The Chief cut him off with a sharp look. \u201cHe is through,\u201d he said, the words falling like stones into a deep well. \u201cMove on.\u201d\n\nThe walk off the stage was a blur. The bright lights gave way to the dim backstage corridor, and the tension in Adebayo\u2019s shoulders unwound so suddenly he felt dizzy. The brisk woman with the headset met him, her expression now holding a flicker of respect. She handed him a laminated card on a lanyard and a thick folder. \u201cWelcome to the Top 20,\u201d she said, her tone all business. \u201cRehearsal schedule, contracts, and media guidelines are in the folder. Your life is no longer your own. Read it. All of it. Be at the studio tomorrow, 8 a.m. sharp.\u201d He took the folder, its weight a shock in his hands. He looked at the lanyard. It had his picture, a grainy shot from his application, with his name underneath: Adebayo Okoro. Vocalist.\n\nHe found himself back in the sleek lobby, the other contestants now looking at him differently. He saw envy, curiosity, and in some eyes, a clear dismissal, as if his success was a fluke, a gimmick that would soon wear off. Tunde\u2019s words came back to him: *\u2018The voice of The Palms!\u2019* The host\u2019s words echoed louder: *\u2018Our singing caretaker!\u2019* He knew which label would stick. He was a story, a novelty. He clutched the folder to his chest and walked out of the glass building, back onto the planet of his real life, the cool evening air doing nothing to calm the firestorm in his mind. He made his way to the bus stop, a man caught between two worlds, belonging fully to neither. He pulled out his phone and sent a simple text to Tunde: *\u2018I am in.\u2019* He couldn\u2019t bring himself to call Funke. This news was too big, too terrifying, to be delivered through a wire. It had to be given face to face, a fragile offering laid at her feet.\n\nWhen he arrived home, the generator was running, its familiar drone a comforting, mundane sound. The single lightbulb was on, casting a harsh, yellow glare over their room. Funke was on the mat, mending one of Amara\u2019s tiny dresses, her needle moving with a quick, rhythmic precision. She looked up as he entered, her eyes immediately scanning his face, then dropping to the thick folder in his hands. She didn\u2019t have to ask. The answer was right there, a heavy, glossy testament to his success. He sat down opposite her, the exhaustion of the day settling into his bones like a deep chill. He placed the folder on the mat between them. It lay there like a border wall.\n\n\u201cThey put me through,\u201d he said, his voice flat with fatigue. \u201cTo the live shows. The Top 20.\u201d He watched her face, searching for a sign, any sign. She put the mending aside, her hands smoothing the fabric of her own worn wrapper. She looked at the folder, at the sleek logo of \u2018Naija Star Voice\u2019, an invader in their simple room. She looked at the olive-green shirt he was still wearing, a costume for a life he hadn't yet earned.\n\n\u201cSo,\u201d she said, her voice impossibly calm, betraying none of the storm he knew must be raging inside her. \u201cThey have you now.\u201d He flinched. It was the exact fear she had expressed, now stated as fact. \u201cThey have our story. They will put us on television for everyone to see. Our room. Our daughter. Our life. They will package it and sell it.\u201d She finally raised her eyes to meet his, and he saw no anger, only a profound, heartbreaking clarity. \u201cYou sang for them, Adebayo. Now you will dance for them too.\u201d She reached out and touched the folder, not with fear, but with a grim resignation. \u201cSo show me. Show me the contract for your soul.\u201dThey sat on the mat long into the night, the generator having coughed into silence, plunging them back into the intimate darkness of a single candle. The thick folder lay between them, its pristine white pages a stark contrast to their surroundings. Funke, with the ferocious focus she usually reserved for a complicated braid pattern, began to read. Adebayo watched her, unable to decipher the dense blocks of text himself, the legal language a thick jungle he could not navigate. He could only read her face. He saw her brow furrow at a clause about exclusivity, her lips thin into a grim line as she read the section on revenue sharing. The numbers were staggering. The label would take a percentage of everything: not just music sales, but touring, merchandise, endorsements, even public appearances, for a period of seven years after the competition, win or lose. It was a net cast wide enough to catch not just the fish, but the entire river.\n\n\u201cThis is not a contract, Adebayo,\u201d she finally said, her voice low and heavy in the stillness of the room. She tapped a page with her finger. \u201cThis is an indenture. They will give you a stipend, yes. Enough to make you feel rich for a month. They will put you in a house with the others. But you will own nothing. Your voice, the songs you sing, the clothes you wear, the places you go\u2026 they will own it all. It says here,\u201d she pointed again, \u201cthat they have the right to \u2018shape and exploit the artist\u2019s life story for promotional purposes\u2019. Exploit, Adebayo. They are not hiding what they will do. They are telling you to your face.\u201d He saw the small, precious dream of a garden and a proper salon for her shrivel under the harsh light of her words. He had seen the callback as a door opening; she saw it as a cage closing, its lock clicking shut.\n\n\u201cBut what choice do we have, Funke?\u201d he pleaded, the exhaustion and the hope warring within him. \u201cTo stay here forever? To let Amara grow up in this one room, listening to the generator and the arguments from next door? This is a chance to escape. A hard chance, yes, a bad bargain, but it is the only one we have been offered.\u201d He reached for the folder, his hand resting on top of it. \u201cWe have been exploited our whole lives for a few Naira. At least with this, the promise is bigger.\u201d Funke looked at him, her eyes full of a deep, weary sorrow. She did not see a brave man seizing an opportunity. She saw her husband, a good and simple man, walking into a lion\u2019s den because he had been promised a feast. She picked up the pen they used for her customer records and, with a hand that did not tremble, signed her name in the space marked \u2018Spouse/Next of Kin\u2019. Her signature was a neat, precise, and utterly joyless surrender.\n\nThe next morning, at an hour when he would normally be dragging the heavy buffer across the lobby floor, Adebayo stood with a small, worn bag at the gates of The Palms. A sleek black car, its windows tinted to an opaque darkness, was waiting for him. Tunde was there to see him off, bouncing on the balls of his feet with an infectious excitement that Adebayo could not quite feel. \u201cMy guy! You\u2019re off! To the big leagues!\u201d Tunde clapped him on the back. \u201cRemember us little people when you\u2019re a superstar!\u201d Adebayo managed a weak smile, his mind elsewhere. He had said goodbye to Funke in their room, a stilted, awkward affair full of things left unsaid. He had kissed Amara\u2019s sleeping head, the familiar scent of baby powder a painful reminder of the world he was leaving behind. Getting into the air-conditioned luxury of the car felt less like an ascent and more like an abduction. As the car pulled away, he looked back and saw Mrs Ede standing on the grand steps of the residence, her arms crossed, watching his departure with an expression he couldn't quite decipher. It wasn't irritation. It was something closer to\u2026 thwarted ownership.\n\nThe artist compound was a large, modern duplex on a quiet, tree-lined street in Ikeja, surrounded by high walls topped with security wire. It was another world, but a far cry from the sleek fantasy of Victoria Island. This was a holding pen, comfortable but sterile. He was shown to a small, neat room he would share with another contestant, a rapper from Jos named MC Slate who regarded Adebayo\u2019s worn bag and simple clothes with a cool, assessing gaze. The house was filled with the twenty chosen ones, a vibrant and intimidating mix of talent and ego. They were all younger than him, their ambitions worn as brightly as their designer clothes. They spoke a different language, a slick patois of industry slang and social media trends, and moved with a restless, competitive energy that made Adebayo feel slow and ancient. He was the caretaker, the old man, the novelty act. He saw it in the way they looked at him, a mixture of pity and condescending curiosity. His story had preceded him. He was not just Adebayo; he was a character.\n\nThe first week was a blur of scheduled disorientation. They were given new phones with their schedules pre-loaded, new wardrobes curated by a team of stylists, and a strict set of rules. No unauthorized contact with the outside world. No social media posts without approval. Every meal was catered, every hour was accounted for. It was a life of manufactured ease designed to keep them focused and controlled. His first session with the head vocal coach, a woman named Diana with a sharp bob and an even sharper tongue, was a lesson in humiliation. He sang his mother's gospel tune, the one that had impressed the first-round judges, pouring his heart into it. Diana stopped him halfway through, a pained expression on her face. \u201cDarling, no,\u201d she said, her voice dripping with condescension. \u201cThat raw, shouty thing might work for a church hall, but it won\u2019t sell records. Your pitch is a gift, but your technique is a disaster. You\u2019re singing from your chest, from your feelings. It\u2019s very\u2026 authentic.\u201d She said the word \u2018authentic\u2019 as if it were a disease. \u201cWe need you to sing from your diaphragm. We need control. We need to polish the diamond, not just admire the rock it\u2019s trapped in.\u201d For the next hour, she had him doing breathing exercises and scales, trying to sand down the very texture he thought was the soul of his voice. He felt foolish, his large frame struggling to follow her precise instructions, while in the next room, a young girl half his age effortlessly ran through a complex Mariah Carey riff.\n\nThe calls home were the hardest part. He would find a quiet corner of the manicured garden, the new, unfamiliar phone feeling slick and foreign in his hand. \u201cHow is Amara?\u201d he would ask, his opening line every time. \u201cShe has a tooth coming in. She is crying all night,\u201d Funke would reply, her voice thin and tired over the line. \u201cThe landlord was asking about the rent for next month.\u201d He would try to tell her about his day, about the stylists and the vocal coaches, but the words felt absurd and hollow. How could he speak of choosing between three different kinds of designer jeans when she was worried about rent? The chasm between their realities was growing wider with every call. \u201cThey are paying me a stipend,\u201d he said, trying to offer a concrete reassurance. \u201cIt will come soon. I will send it all.\u201d But he could hear the unspoken accusation in her silence. The money came at a cost, and she was the one at home paying the daily interest. He was living in a clean, quiet house with chefs and stylists. She was living in a small, hot room with a teething baby and the ghosts of their broken promises.The theme for the first live show was \u2018My Story\u2019. When it was announced, a wave of palpable excitement rippled through the production team, and all eyes turned to Adebayo. He was their golden goose, their lottery ticket. His story was not one of youthful ambition or a comfortable middle-class dream; it was a gritty, aspirational fairytale that wrote its own headlines. The producers assigned him their top field director, a man named Tunde whose slick, easy charm felt like a weapon. He sat Adebayo down and pitched the vision for his pre-performance video package, his hands painting a masterpiece of sentimental poverty in the air. They would show the grand, marble-floored lobby of The Palms, then immediately cut to his own cramped quarters. The contrast would be breathtaking. They would film him with his mop, a silent, noble worker, staring wistfully into the middle distance. It was a caricature, a reduction of his entire existence into a thirty-second sob story, and Adebayo felt a hot, helpless shame creep up his neck.\n\nThe day the film crew came to The Palms was one of the longest of Adebayo\u2019s life. They arrived in a white van, their equipment cases and confident swagger an alien invasion in the familiar service corridors. They followed him as he did his work, the camera\u2019s unblinking eye a constant, silent judgment. The director, Tunde, orchestrated every shot. \u201cAdebayo, my man, just a bit more pathos, okay? Look at the scuff mark on the floor like it represents all the dreams you\u2019ve had to scrub away,\u201d he\u2019d say, and the crew would chuckle. Adebayo obeyed, his movements stiff, his face a stony mask. He felt like a prop in the museum of his own life. The true humiliation, however, came when they arrived at his flat. He had called Funke to warn her, a conversation filled with tense, brittle silences. She was there, with Amara strapped to her back, her face scrubbed of all expression. She had cleaned the room to within an inch of its life, but there was no hiding the peeling paint, the cracked mirror, the inherent smallness of their world.\n\nThe crew squeezed into the tiny space, their presence sucking the very air from the room. The director\u2019s eyes lit up as he saw the cracked mirror. \u201cOh, this is gold. Pure gold,\u201d he murmured to his cameraman. He tried to interview Funke, aiming his charming smile at her like a spotlight. \u201cSo, tell us,\u201d he began, \u201cwhat does it feel like, knowing your husband has this incredible, once-in-a-lifetime chance to lift you both out of\u2026 all this?\u201d Funke looked at him, her gaze so direct and devoid of artifice that he faltered for a second. \u201cIt feels like my house is full of strangers with cameras,\u201d she said, her voice quiet and clear. She answered every question with a blunt, unadorned fact, refusing to give them the tears or the trembling hope they were mining for. She would not perform for them. She would not sell her struggle for their story. Defeated, they turned their attention back to Adebayo, positioning him by the window, asking him to look out at the grey concrete wall of the next building as if he were gazing at a promised land.\n\nThat Saturday night, backstage was a riot of nervous energy, hairspray, and sequins. Adebayo stood in the wings, the borrowed clothes from the show\u2019s stylist feeling like a costume for a stranger. He could hear the roar of the live audience, a sound like the ocean, vast and terrifying. He was due to sing a popular Afrobeats ballad that had been stripped down and rearranged into a soulless, acoustic number. Diana, his vocal coach, fussed around him, patting his chest. \u201cBreathe, Adebayo. Diaphragm. And for heaven\u2019s sake, connect with the camera. Seduce it. Make them fall in love with you,\u201d she hissed, before being shooed away by a stage manager. Then, the lights in the studio dimmed. The host\u2019s voice boomed, and Adebayo\u2019s video package filled the enormous screens. He watched in horror as his life was served up for mass consumption. There he was, a sad-looking man with a mop. There was his home, a portrait of lack. And there was Funke, her face a mask of proud defiance, her refusal to play their game making her look cold and unsupportive. Finally, the camera zoomed in on Amara, sleeping in her cot, a symbol of innocent hope. The audience sighed a collective, pitying \u201cAwwww.\u201d Adebayo felt naked, flayed open, his most private sanctums turned into public spectacle. He was no longer a man; he was a tear-jerker.\n\nHe walked into the circle of light, his heart a cold, heavy stone in his chest. The music started, a soft, generic guitar melody. He began to sing, his voice coming out exactly as Diana had trained it: controlled, on pitch, technically perfect, and utterly dead. He went through the motions of the first verse, his eyes fixed on the red light of the main camera as instructed. He could see the judges\u2019 faces on a monitor. They were nodding politely, their expressions professional and vaguely bored. This was the safe, polished product they were creating. This was the voice of a man who did as he was told. Then, as the song moved to the chorus, he caught his own reflection in the dark screen of a camera. He saw a stranger, a well-dressed puppet whose soul had been sanded down and tucked away. Funke\u2019s words echoed in his head, a burning indictment: *Now you will dance for them too.* A fire ignited in his belly. No. He would not.\n\nIn the space between one beat and the next, he broke away. He abandoned the prescribed melody and the sterile arrangement. He closed his eyes, shutting out the lights, the cameras, the judges, and Diana\u2019s horrified face, which he could sense in the wings. He took the shallow pop lyrics and plunged them into the deep well of his own sound. The thin melody thickened, infused with the harmattan dust and palm wine of his true voice. He sang of love, not as a romantic clich\u00e9, but as a thing of grit and sacrifice. He sang of faith, not as a greeting card sentiment, but as the desperate, calloused-hand grip of a man holding on in the dark. The song transformed. It became a gospel hymn. It became a plea. It became a defiant roar. He was no longer performing for the audience or the judges. He was singing directly to Funke, an apology for the invasion of her privacy, a declaration that they had not taken everything, that this, his voice, was still his own. The final note soared, raw and resonant, a cry of pure, unvarnished soul that hung in the air long after the stunned guitarist had stopped playing.\n\nWhen he opened his eyes, the studio was in an uproar. The polite audience had become a cheering, roaring crowd, on its feet, their applause a physical force that washed over him. He looked at the judges\u2019 table. Femi Rhymz was standing, clapping slowly, a huge grin of pure delight on his face. \u201cNow, *that* is what we call soul!\u201d he yelled over the noise. Zara Kalu was staring, her pen forgotten, her sharp, commercial mind visibly spinning as she processed the raw, marketable power of what she had just witnessed. Only Chief Obinna remained seated, his face an unreadable granite mask. He had disobeyed. He had broken the cardinal rule of the show. He had taken back control. Backstage, he knew Diana would be apoplectic. He knew the producers would be furious. He had gone off-script. But as he stood there, bathed in the thunderous applause, he felt a profound and terrifying sense of release. He had stopped dancing.\n\nLater that night, long after the adrenaline had faded, leaving him hollowed out and trembling, he found a quiet corner and dialled Funke\u2019s number. The phone rang for a long time before she picked up. He braced himself for her anger, for the \u2018I told you so\u2019 that he so richly deserved after their life had been broadcast to millions. \u201cI saw it,\u201d she said, her voice small and distant. He waited. \u201cBaba Risi down the street brought his television outside. The whole neighbourhood was there. Watching.\u201d There was a long pause, filled with the crackle of the phone line and the frantic beating of Adebayo\u2019s heart. \u201cWhen they showed the room,\u201d she continued, \u201cI wanted to die.\u201d He closed his eyes. \u201cFunke, I am so sorry\u2014\u201d \u201cBut then you started to sing,\u201d she cut in, her voice barely a whisper. \u201cAt first, it was just\u2026 noise. Another love song. And then\u2026 it was you. It was your voice. The one from the church.\u201d Another pause. He could hear her take a shaky breath. \u201cThe people here,\u201d she said, her voice thick with a strange wonder, \u201cthey were shouting your name. They were cheering for you, Adebayo.\u201d It was not forgiveness. It was not an absolution. But it was something more precious. It was a recognition. Across the vast, crackling distance, through the television screen and the phone line, she had heard him. Not the caretaker, not the contestant. Him.The moment Adebayo stepped off the stage, the thunder of the crowd was replaced by a frigid, menacing silence. Diana was waiting for him in the wings, her face a mask of incandescent rage, her sharp bob vibrating with fury. Her whisper was more terrifying than any shout. \"You are finished,\" she hissed, her eyes like chips of black ice. \"You arrogant, ungrateful man. I told you to connect, not to self-destruct. Chief Obinna will have you thrown out of here so fast your feet won't touch the ground. You have just ended your career before it even began. You are a caretaker, and a caretaker you will remain.\" He didn't answer, his body still humming with the aftershock of the performance, his heart a strange mix of terror and triumph. He had expected this. He had made his choice in that circle of light, and he was ready to accept the consequences. He simply nodded, a quiet acknowledgment of her verdict, and walked past her towards the communal dressing room, preparing himself for the walk of shame out of the building and back to his old life.\n\nHe was pulling the borrowed shirt over his head when the brisk woman with the headset appeared at the door, her expression as unreadable as ever. The other male contestants in the room fell silent, watching the unfolding drama with predatory stillness. \"Adebayo Okoro,\" she said, her voice cutting through the tension. \"Chief Obinna will see you now. In his office.\" A collective, indrawn breath seemed to be taken by everyone in the room. This was it. The final judgment, delivered not by a subordinate, but by the king himself. Adebayo put the shirt back on, his fingers fumbling with the buttons. As he followed the woman down a series of sterile, white corridors he had never seen before, he felt a strange sense of peace settle over him. He had not bowed. He had sung his truth. If this was the end, he would leave with his voice, the one thing that was entirely his own, still intact.\n\nChief Obinna\u2019s office was on the top floor, a vast, dark space paneled in rich mahogany. One wall was a single sheet of glass overlooking the sprawling, glittering lights of Lagos. It was the view of a man who owned the city, not one who cleaned its floors. Zara Kalu and Femi Rhymz were already there, seated in low leather armchairs. Chief Obinna sat behind a desk so large it looked like a landing strip, his fingertips steepled before him. He gestured for Adebayo to stand in the centre of the expensive rug, a specimen under a microscope. He let the silence stretch, a palpable force in the room, before he spoke, his voice a low, dangerous rumble. \"Mr. Okoro. You were given a song, a vocal arrangement, and a set of instructions from my team. You followed none of them. Explain yourself.\" Adebayo\u2019s throat was dry. \"Sir,\" he began, his voice raspy. \"The song they gave me\u2026 it had no heart. It was not my story. I could not sing a lie.\"\n\nFemi Rhymz let out a short, appreciative laugh, which he quickly stifled when the Chief shot him a dark glance. It was Zara Kalu who spoke, her voice smooth and calculated. \"His social media mentions have increased by three thousand percent in the last hour. The hashtag #NaijaHeart is trending. He\u2019s what the people are talking about.\" She wasn't defending Adebayo; she was presenting a stock report. Chief Obinna\u2019s eyes remained fixed on Adebayo, cold and assessing. \"So, you are an artist, Mr. Okoro? You believe your feelings are more important than a multi-million Naira production? You believe your 'heart' is more valuable than my investment?\" Adebayo met his gaze. \"I believe my heart is the only thing I have that is worth investing in, sir.\" The audacity of the statement hung in the air. The Chief stared at him for a long, unnerving moment, and then a slow, chilling smile spread across his face. It did not reach his eyes. \"Excellent,\" he said. \"I agree. From now on, that is your brand. Adebayo Okoro, the Heart of Naija. The man who sings the truth. The voice of the people.\" He leaned forward, his smile vanishing. \"But understand this. I own your truth now. I own your heart. I own the people\u2019s response to it. You thought you were rebelling, but you were merely auditioning for a new role. And you got the part. Congratulations.\" He gestured to the door. \"You are dismissed. Do not disappoint your public.\"\n\nWalking back into the brightly lit compound was like re-entering the atmosphere from outer space. The change in the house was immediate and profound. The whispers that used to follow him were now replaced by a wary silence. He was no longer the pitiable caretaker; he was a contender, a favourite, and a threat. Some contestants approached him with a new, sycophantic deference, offering to get him a drink, complimenting his performance with wide, false eyes. Others, like MC Slate, watched him from a distance, their expressions hardened with a new layer of competitive resentment. Later that evening, the rapper cornered him by the pool, the water casting shifting blue patterns on their faces. \"That was a neat trick on the stage, old man,\" Slate said, his voice a low murmur. \"You made them think it was their idea.\" Adebayo shook his head. \"It was not a trick.\" Slate smirked, a flash of white in the darkness. \"Everything in this place is a trick. You just pulled off a good one. Just be careful. When you're the 'Heart of Naija', there's a long way to fall. And everyone in this house will be waiting to watch.\"\n\nThat night, Adebayo\u2019s call with Funke was different. The static on the line felt less like a chasm and more like a necessary buffer. He told her everything, the words tumbling out of him\u2014Diana\u2019s fury, the terrifying summons, the Chief's chilling pronouncement. He tried to frame it as a victory, a validation of his choice. \"They are letting me be me, Funke! They want my voice, not some copy.\" He waited for her to share in his relief, but her reply was a splash of cold, sobering water. \"So the lion was pleased you roared,\" she said, her voice laced with the hard-edged pragmatism he had missed so dearly. \"He did not set you free, Adebayo. He has simply put you in a bigger cage and painted the bars gold. Now you are not just a singer; you are a symbol. 'The Heart of Naija'. It is a much heavier chain to wear than a number on a piece of paper.\" She was right. The euphoria of his survival began to curdle into a familiar anxiety. He had won, but the price of his victory was that he now had to keep winning, on their terms, under a label he had not chosen.\n\nThe new week began, and the pressure was immense. His every move was watched, his interviews parsed, his image carefully managed by the show\u2019s publicity team. At his next vocal session, Diana was a different person. Her condescension was gone, replaced by a fawning, honey-sweet tone that was somehow more unnerving. \"Adebayo, my star!\" she cooed. \"We must protect that magnificent, raw instrument of yours!\" The theme for the week was 'Legends of Gospel'. It was an obvious move, a strategic corralling of his new brand. Diana presented him with his song, chosen by the Chief himself: 'Amazing Grace'. It was perhaps the most famous hymn in the world, a song so grand and so familiar it was almost a clich\u00e9. The trap was elegant in its simplicity. If he sang it straight, he would be boring, a predictable church singer. If he tried to deconstruct it as he had the pop song, he risked sacrilege, alienating the very audience that now adored him. He stared at the sheet music, at the simple, timeless notes. Last week, he had fought for the right to sing with a soul. This week, he was being commanded to do so, and he had no idea if he could deliver an authentic miracle on demand.The week leading up to the second live show was a masterclass in gilded imprisonment. His brand, \u2018The Heart of Naija\u2019, became his shadow, preceding him into every room and lingering long after he left. Diana, his vocal coach, now treated him less like a student and more like a volatile, priceless artifact. Her sessions were no longer about technique but about curation. She would sit at the piano, playing the simple chords of \u2018Amazing Grace\u2019, her eyes closed as if in rapture. \u201cFeel it, Adebayo. Feel the history,\u201d she would command. \u201cRemember the video package. Remember the mop. Channel the struggle. This isn\u2019t just a song; it\u2019s your biography.\u201d The more she tried to orchestrate his emotion, the more it fled from him. The song, once a source of comfort heard in countless church services, became a hollow vessel. He would sing the words, his voice technically flawless, but his own ears heard only a dead echo.\n\nHe became a ghost in the vibrant, noisy house. His newfound status had built an invisible wall around him. The other contestants, who once ignored him, now watched his every move. Bisi, a bubbly eighteen-year-old pop singer with a voice like spun sugar, cornered him one afternoon by the water cooler. \u201cUncle Adebayo,\u201d she said, her eyes wide and earnest, \u201cwhat\u2019s your secret? That thing you did last week\u2026 that pain in your voice. How do you find it?\u201d He stared at her, at her unlined face and her life of privilege that she wore so effortlessly, and he had no answer. How could he explain that the \u2018pain\u2019 she admired was the accumulation of a thousand quiet humiliations, the ache in his back after a sixteen-hour shift, the knot in his stomach when Amara had a fever and the clinic was closed? His life was not a technique to be learned. He was not a secret to be unlocked. He was a man, and he felt he was slowly being disassembled, his parts catalogued and sold for public consumption.\n\nThe chasm between his new reality and the one he had left behind grew deeper with every phone call home. He would stand on the manicured lawn of the compound, the scent of hibiscus and chlorine in the air, and listen to Funke\u2019s dispatches from another universe. Her voice was flat with exhaustion. The roof had developed a new leak right over Amara\u2019s cot. The price of cooking gas had gone up again. He tried to tell her about his own struggles, the suffocating pressure of his new brand, the hollowness he felt trying to sing his assigned song. \u201cI have to sing \u2018Amazing Grace\u2019,\u201d he said, his voice laced with a frustration he couldn't hide, \u201cand I feel like a liar.\u201d There was a long silence on the other end of the line, a silence so heavy he could feel its weight across the miles. \u201cA man in a big house with free food is worried about a song,\u201d Funke said, not unkindly, but with the devastating clarity of her reality. \u201cI am worried our daughter will catch a cold from the damp. We are living in different worlds now, my husband.\u201d The call ended with the usual promises to send money, but the words felt like flimsy paper bridges thrown across an ever-widening canyon.\n\nHis crisis came two nights before the show. He was in his small, sterile room, staring at his reflection in the polished surface of the television screen. He saw a stranger looking back at him. The man in the reflection wore a soft, expensive t-shirt. His face was fuller, his skin clearer. The perpetual tiredness that had settled deep in his bones for years was gone, replaced by a new, sharper anxiety. He looked comfortable. He looked rested. He looked nothing like the man who deserved to sing about being a wretch saved by grace. The entire performance felt like a fraud. He was no longer the man from the lobby. He was Chief Obinna\u2019s polished product, a living, breathing brand. He felt a surge of self-loathing so strong it made him want to smash the screen. He grabbed his phone, his thumb swiping angrily past the endless stream of notifications from strangers who claimed to love him, searching for something real. He found it in his photo gallery. It was a picture Funke had sent him days ago, one he had glanced at and forgotten. Amara, propped up on a pillow, her face a mess of mashed yam, holding a plastic spoon like a scepter. Her smile was pure, uncalculated joy.\n\nHe stared at the image, at the smudge of food on her cheek, at the light in her eyes, and the lyrics of the hymn began to reconfigure themselves in his soul. *Amazing grace, how sweet the sound, that saved a wretch like me.* The grace wasn\u2019t the record deal or the cheering crowd. The grace was this. It was the fierce, stubborn love of a wife who would read a contract in the dark to protect him. It was the impossible, breathtaking miracle of his daughter\u2019s gummy smile. The wretch was not a character to be played for the cameras; it was the man he had been, the man who felt invisible, who hummed his songs into the drone of a buffer because he believed no one else would ever care to listen. *I once was lost, but now am found.* He had been lost in the anonymous grind of his life, and now he was found, exposed to the world in all his flawed humanity. *Was blind, but now I see.* He had been blind to his own worth, and now he saw it, but he also saw the gilded bars of the cage he was in. The song wasn't a simple hymn of praise. It was a complex, painful, and beautiful testimony of his exact position in the universe at that very moment. It was a song of a man who was simultaneously more free and more trapped than he had ever been in his life.\n\nHe didn't need Diana\u2019s coaching or the Chief\u2019s branding. He didn\u2019t need to channel a past struggle; he just needed to inhabit his present truth. The song was no longer about a divine, distant God. It was about the messy, tangible, amazing grace of a life that had brought him here, to this strange, lonely room, staring at a picture of his daughter and preparing to sing for his survival. He picked up the show's acoustic guitar, an instrument he hadn't touched in years, and began to pick out a simple, quiet melody. He would not give them a performance. He would not give them a spectacle. He would give them a confession. He would strip the song down to its bones, to a place so quiet and intimate that it would feel like a prayer whispered in the dark. In the sterile silence of the compound, Adebayo Okoro, the Heart of Naija, finally found his voice again, not in a roar of defiance, but in a whisper of profound and complicated gratitude.On the night of the second live show, the backstage area was a whirlwind of frantic energy, a storm of glitter and ambition that Adebayo now navigated with a strange, unnerving calm. He sat on a crate in a dimly lit corner, away from the flurry of makeup artists and panicking contestants, his fingers tracing the worn wood of the acoustic guitar resting on his lap. It was an old instrument from the studio\u2019s storage, dusty and forgotten, but it felt more real in his hands than any of the expensive costumes he had been forced to wear. He had found his anchor.\n\nDiana found him there, her face a carefully constructed mask of supportive encouragement, but her eyes darted nervously to the guitar. \u201cAdebayo, darling,\u201d she began, her voice a tense whisper, \u201cWhat are you doing with that? There\u2019s no guitar in the arrangement. It\u2019s a full orchestra tonight. Grandeur. Power. Remember the brand.\u201d\n\nAdebayo looked up at her, his expression placid. The fear she had once inspired in him was gone, replaced by a quiet, settled resolve. \u201cThe brand is \u2018Heart of Naija\u2019, Diana,\u201d he said, his voice even. \u201cMy heart is not an orchestra. It is this.\u201d He strummed a single, soft chord, the sound small but pure, cutting through the surrounding chaos. Diana\u2019s face tightened. She saw the same stubborn disobedience from the week before, but this time it was not a fiery rebellion; it was something far more formidable: a quiet declaration of independence. She knew there was no point arguing. She gave a curt, angry nod and swept away to complain to the producers, leaving him alone with his decision.\n\nWhen the host, his teeth seeming to glow in the studio lights, announced his name with a booming flourish, the introduction was thick with manufactured sentiment. \u201cAnd now, the man whose story has captured the nation! The voice of the people, the one and only Heart of Naija, Adebayo Okoro!\u201d The roar from the crowd was immense, a wave of expectation. But Adebayo did not walk to the center of the stage. He walked instead to a single wooden stool placed to the side, the guitar in his hand a clear signal that he was once again going off-script. A murmur of confusion rippled through the audience and, he knew, a wave of panic in the control room. He sat down, adjusted the microphone, and ignored the teleprompter, the cameras, and the sea of faces. He took a deep breath, and in the sudden, expectant hush, he looked down at his own hands, the hands that had scrubbed floors and held his daughter, and began to play.\n\nHe did not sing the song as a hymn. He spoke it, almost, the first lines a hushed confession whispered into the microphone. His voice was not the soaring tenor that had filled the church; it was a low, textured baritone, intimate and raw. He sang of grace not as a divine thunderclap, but as the quiet, persistent light of his daughter\u2019s smile in a cracked phone screen. When he sang of being a \u2018wretch\u2019, the word was imbued with the memory of his own invisibility, of smelling of polish and being looked through as if he were part of the furniture. The vast studio, with its thousands of people, seemed to shrink until it was just him, alone in a room, grappling with the terrible and beautiful truth of his life. He built the song slowly, not towards a crescendo of power, but towards a summit of heartbreaking vulnerability. For the final verse, his voice finally rose, not in a shout, but in a flight of pure, unadorned melody that seemed to carry all the love, fear, and gratitude of his fractured world. He held the last note, letting it fade into a whisper, his fingers resting on the silent strings of the guitar.\n\nThe silence that followed was absolute, a sacred, breathless vacuum that lasted for what felt like an eternity. It was not the stunned silence of shock from the week before; it was the profound, reverent silence of a shared moment of truth. Then, a single person began to clap, then another, and then the entire studio erupted, not in a wild roar, but in a deep, sustained ovation that was less an applause and more an answer. He looked up at the judges' table. Femi Rhymz was wiping a tear from his eye, unashamedly. Zara Kalu was staring at her notes, though she hadn't written a single word, her sharp commercial mind grappling with a phenomenon that defied easy marketing. It was Chief Obinna who leaned into his microphone, his voice a low, resonant bass that cut through the applause. He looked directly at Adebayo, his expression unreadable.\n\n\u201cLast week, Mr. Okoro, you showed us your power,\u201d the Chief began, the audience falling silent to hear his verdict. \u201cTonight, you have shown us your soul. There are many singers in this world, but there are very few artists who can hold a room captive with nothing but their own truth.\u201d He paused, letting the weight of his words settle. \u201cYou are no longer a contestant in this competition. You are the standard by which all others will now be judged.\u201d It was the most terrifying coronation Adebayo could have imagined. It was not a release; it was the tightening of a crown.\n\nThe phone call home that night felt different. He dialled her number with a steady hand, the familiar anxiety replaced by a quiet need to connect. Funke answered on the second ring. Before he could even ask about Amara, she spoke, her voice soft and full of a wonder he had not heard in years. \u201cThe whole street was quiet tonight, Adebayo. Baba Risi turned the volume up, but there was no need. Nobody was talking. We were all just\u2026 listening.\u201d He could hear the crackle of the line, but for the first time, it felt like it was carrying them closer, not holding them apart.\n\n\u201cWhat did you think?\u201d he asked, the question holding the entire weight of his performance. He needed her verdict more than he needed the Chief\u2019s. There was a pause, and he heard her let out a long, shaky breath. \"You were not singing to them,\" she said, her voice thick with emotion. \"You were singing to us. You sang about the leak in the roof, and the smell of baby powder, and the fear I feel when I look at the calendar. You sang my worries and you made them sound like a prayer.\" She was crying, he realised, a quiet, gentle weeping that held no anger, only a profound, heartbreaking recognition. \"You brought the song home, Adebayo,\" she whispered. \"In front of all those people, you finally brought it all home to us.\" In that moment, surrounded by the artificial luxury of his gilded cage, Adebayo felt a grace so real and so powerful it brought him to his knees.The morning after his performance, Adebayo awoke to a profound and unnerving silence. The usual pre-dawn cacophony of the compound\u2014the thumping bass from someone\u2019s headphones, the competitive vocal runs from the shower, the loud, boastful chatter\u2014was gone. In its place was a quiet so complete it felt like a held breath. When he walked into the communal kitchen, the few contestants already there stopped their conversations mid-sentence. They didn't look at him with jealousy or admiration anymore; they looked at him with a kind of awe-struck fear, as if he were a visitor from another plane of existence. He was no longer one of them, a scrabbler in the dirt fighting for a spot. Chief Obinna\u2019s declaration had placed him on a separate, lonely pedestal. He was \u2018the standard\u2019, a fixed point against which their own frantic orbits would be measured. It was not a promotion; it was an exile.\n\nThe new dynamic was on full display at breakfast. Bisi, the young pop singer who had once asked for the secret to his pain, now quietly placed the ripest slices of mango on his plate, her head bowed as if making an offering to a deity. Others gave him a wide berth, their eyes skittering away from his. He saw MC Slate across the room, watching him over the rim of a coffee mug, his expression a cold, flat line of calculation. The rapper was not awed; he was analyzing a new and dangerous variable in the equation. The fawning reverence of the others was suffocating, but Slate\u2019s silent, clinical assessment was far more unsettling. Adebayo felt like an animal that had been separated from the herd, a position that made him both respected and intensely vulnerable. He ate his mango in silence, the sweet fruit tasting like ash in his mouth, the loneliness of his new station a cold weight in his stomach.\n\nLater that morning, he was summoned not to Diana, but to a formal meeting with Zara Kalu and the show\u2019s Head of Publicity, a sharp, fast-talking woman named Yetunde. They sat him down in a glass-walled conference room, a stack of glossy magazines between them. \u201cAdebayo, your metrics are unprecedented,\u201d Yetunde began, tapping a tablet that glowed with charts and graphs. \u201cYou\u2019re not just a television personality anymore; you\u2019re a cultural moment.\u201d Zara Kalu leaned forward, her expression devoid of sentiment. \u201cAnd moments are perishable. We need to capitalize. *BellaNaija* wants a digital cover and an in-depth feature. *Genevieve Magazine* is proposing a full family spread for their Christmas issue.\u201d She paused, her gaze pointed. \u201cYour story of struggle is very\u2026 aspirational right now. It sells. We need to frame it properly before the narrative gets away from us.\u201d Adebayo stared at the mock-up of a magazine cover on the tablet. It was his face, artfully shadowed, with the headline: \u2018FROM THE FLOOR TO THE STARS: THE AMAZING GRACE OF ADEBAYO OKORO\u2019. He felt a wave of nausea. They weren't just owning his voice; they were packaging his past, shrink-wrapping his pain for mass-market consumption.\n\nHis blood ran cold at the mention of a family spread. That afternoon, he called Funke, a knot of dread tightening in his chest. Her voice, when she answered, was thin and ragged. \u201cThey are here, Adebayo,\u201d she whispered, her voice cracking. \u201cOutside. They have been there since morning.\u201d He didn\u2019t have to ask who. The press. \u201cMen with big cameras. They are talking to the neighbours, offering them money to talk about us. Mrs. Ojo from next door told me one of them tried to take a picture of Amara through the window.\u201d A bolt of pure, primal fear shot through Adebayo, eclipsing everything else. This was his fault. His ambition, his dream, had shattered the small, fragile pane of their privacy and invited the wolves to their door. \u201cI can\u2019t take her for her vaccinations. I can\u2019t even go to the market. We are prisoners in our own home, Adebayo. What have you done?\u201d The question was not an accusation; it was a genuine, desperate plea for an answer he did not have.\n\nRage, cold and pure, propelled him from the garden and straight to Yetunde\u2019s office. He burst in without knocking, his usual deference incinerated by his protective fury. \u201cMy family,\u201d he said, his voice a low growl that made the polished publicist look up in alarm. \u201cYou have to get those people away from my family. Now. My daughter is not a part of your story.\u201d Yetunde stood, her expression shifting from surprise to a practiced, sympathetic frown. \u201cAdebayo, please. I understand you\u2019re upset. But this is the nature of the beast. You are beloved. The public feels a connection to you, and your family is an extension of that. This is the price of this new life.\u201d She spread her hands in a gesture of helplessness that was utterly insincere. \u201cWe have no control over the press.\u201d It was a lie, and they both knew it. He saw with blinding clarity that to them, his family\u2019s fear was not a crisis to be managed, but a valuable B-story, another texture in the rich tapestry of his brand. He had absolutely no power. The realization left him feeling more helpless than he ever had while holding a mop.\n\nThe week\u2019s theme was announced that evening in the main studio, the air thick with tension. The host, radiating manufactured excitement, stood before a giant screen that flashed the word \u2018DUETS\u2019. \u201cThis week, we\u2019re pairing you up! You\u2019ll have to find harmony with one of your fellow competitors in a performance that celebrates the spirit of unity!\u201d Adebayo felt a deep sense of foreboding. The producers were not interested in unity; they were interested in drama. His name was the last to be called. \u201cAnd finally, our Heart of Naija, the man who stands alone\u2026 will be standing with another! He\u2019ll be paired with the lyrical fire of\u2026 MC Slate!\u201d The camera zoomed in for a split screen of their reactions. Adebayo\u2019s face was a stoic mask of resignation, while a slow, predatory smile spread across Slate\u2019s face. It was the smile of a wolf that had just been handed a sheep for a playmate. To complete the brutal irony, the song assigned to them was a classic Fela Kuti anthem about brotherhood and solidarity.\n\nTheir first rehearsal was a clash of two opposing forces of nature. They met in a small, soundproofed studio, an engineer looking on nervously. Adebayo, with his acoustic guitar, began to feel out a soulful, melodic interpretation of the song\u2019s chorus. MC Slate let him play for less than a minute before cutting him off with a sharp gesture. \u201cNo, no, no,\u201d he said, shaking his head, a look of pitying condescension on his face. \u201cSave the sad church music for your solo career, old man. This is Fela. This is fire and rhythm. It\u2019s politics. It\u2019s not a lullaby for your baby.\u201d He tapped a beat out on the table, a complex, aggressive rhythm that was the polar opposite of Adebayo\u2019s gentle cadence. \u201cI\u2019ll take the verses. You just come in on the hook. And try to keep up. This isn\u2019t about your feelings. It\u2019s about the beat. You follow it, or it runs you over.\u201d He leaned in, his voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper, his eyes gleaming with cold amusement. \u201cThey want unity? Fine. We\u2019ll give them a war and call it a duet.\u201dThe rehearsals became a battleground for two irreconcilable ideologies. Slate, a creature of the digital age, treated the song like a piece of code to be hacked. He arrived with a laptop and a small synthesizer, layering the raw, brassy funk of the original Fela track with sharp, aggressive 808-bass hits and trap hi-hats. The result was slick, modern, and undeniably catchy, but to Adebayo, it felt like a desecration. He would try to sing the chorus, his voice seeking the soulful, melodic pocket of the groove, only to find the pocket had been paved over with a concrete slab of synthetic rhythm. His voice, designed to swell and fill space, was now forced into a narrow, percussive lane, competing with Slate\u2019s rapid-fire, polysyllabic verses. The rapper moved with a boxer\u2019s swagger, his rhymes a dazzling display of lyrical acrobatics, but the words were about a generalized, fashionable anger\u2014a protest against an abstract \u2018system\u2019 that sounded more like a brand identity than a genuine grievance.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not working, old man,\u201d Slate would say, cutting the beat with a tap of his spacebar. He\u2019d lean back in his chair, a smirk playing on his lips. \u201cYour flow is from another era. This song needs punch, it needs aggression. You\u2019re trying to turn a protest anthem into a church spiritual.\u201d Diana and the producers, who now sat in on every rehearsal, would nod in agreement. They were mesmerized by Slate\u2019s modernity. He was the sound of the radio, the pulse of the clubs. Adebayo was a beautiful, but dated, piece of furniture they didn\u2019t quite know what to do with. \u201cPerhaps you could try to be more\u2026 rhythmic, Adebayo,\u201d Diana suggested gently, her words dripping with condescension. \u201cThink of your voice as another drum in the mix, not the main melody.\u201d Adebayo gripped his acoustic guitar, the one he now brought to rehearsals as a silent protest, its warm wood a talisman against the cold onslaught of Slate\u2019s electronics. \u201cFela was not just a drum, he was a story,\u201d Adebayo argued, his voice low with a frustration that was nearing its limit. \u201cHis anger came from a real place, from seeing his people suffer. This\u2026\u201d he gestured at the laptop, \u201cthis has no soul. It\u2019s just noise.\u201d Slate laughed, a short, sharp bark. \u201cSoul doesn\u2019t get you streams, Uncle. A hot beat does. Welcome to the 21st century.\u201d\n\nThe war in the studio was a pale shadow of the siege his family was enduring. The phone calls to Funke became fraught with a shared, helpless terror. Her voice was a frayed wire. \u201cI haven\u2019t left the room in two days, Adebayo,\u201d she whispered, the generator rumbling in the background, a sound he now associated with the life he had abandoned. \u201cThey don\u2019t leave. There\u2019s a car parked across the street, all day, all night. Amara has a rash from the heat in the room. I can\u2019t open the window because their cameras are right there.\u201d The image of his daughter, trapped and uncomfortable in the sweltering heat because of his ambition, was a knife in Adebayo\u2019s gut. He felt a rage so potent it made his hands shake, a fury directed at the faceless press, at the producers who enabled them, and most of all, at himself. He had flown too close to the sun, and the heat was scorching his family.\n\nHe stormed into Zara Kalu\u2019s office, bypassing her assistant and the polite protocols he had been taught. He found her on a call, discussing advertising rates. He stood in the middle of her plush carpet, vibrating with a silent fury, until she finished her call and looked up at him, her eyebrows raised in annoyance. \u201cThis needs to stop,\u201d he said, his voice shaking. \u201cMy family. My daughter. This is not part of the deal.\u201d Zara sighed, a sound of weary impatience, as if dealing with a child\u2019s tantrum. She steepled her fingers. \u201cAdebayo, you have become a very valuable property. And valuable properties attract attention. This is a symptom of your success. Your story is compelling. The press is simply telling it. I cannot put a leash on every journalist in Lagos.\u201d He took a step closer to her desk, his large frame casting a shadow over her. \u201cThen get them out of my house,\u201d he said, his voice dropping to a dangerous whisper. \u201cMove them. Now. Put them somewhere safe. A hotel. Anywhere. Use the money you are making from my \u2018valuable property\u2019 and protect the people I love.\u201d For the first time, he saw a flicker of something other than commercial calculation in Zara\u2019s eyes. It might have been respect, or it might have been the simple recognition of a man pushed to his absolute limit. She held his gaze for a long moment, then gave a curt, almost imperceptible nod. \u201cI will make some calls,\u201d she said. It was a concession, a small one, but it was something.\n\nThe call she made, however, was not the one he expected. The next day, Chief Obinna himself swept into their rehearsal. He did not sit. He stood by the door, a silent, imposing monolith, and gestured for them to perform. They launched into their disjointed, combative version of the song. Adebayo sang the hook with a heavy heart, his voice muted and resigned, while Slate attacked the verses with even more ferocity than usual, his rhymes sharp and serrated. It was a mess, a dialogue of the deaf, the sound of two artists falling down a flight of stairs together. When they finished, the silence in the room was thick with failure. The Chief let it hang in the air for a moment before he spoke, his voice calm. \u201cI understand there is some\u2026 creative friction,\u201d he said, his eyes on Adebayo. \u201cAnd that your family is experiencing some unwanted attention, Mr. Okoro. A difficult situation.\u201d He paused. \u201cFela Kuti\u2019s mother was thrown from a window by soldiers. He was beaten, his home was burned, his people were terrorized. He took that pain and he put it into his music. He turned his suffering into a weapon.\u201d The Chief\u2019s gaze was hard as granite. \u201cYou are being hounded by men with cameras, not guns. And you have been given a microphone that reaches millions. Do not come to my producers with your problems. Bring them to the stage. That is what an artist does.\u201d He turned to leave, pausing at the door. \u201cGive them a war,\u201d he said, echoing Slate\u2019s own words, a chilling smile touching his lips. \u201cThe ratings will be spectacular.\u201d\n\nThe Chief\u2019s words were a death sentence for the song, but they were a key for Adebayo. He finally understood. The Chief didn't want him to be a singer; he wanted him to be a gladiator. The show wasn't a competition; it was an arena, and his personal pain was just another exotic beast to be released for the crowd\u2019s entertainment. He had been looking for a way out, a way to protect his family, but the only path offered was to bleed for them on live television. If they wanted a war, he would give them one. But it would not be Slate\u2019s war of beats and rhymes, or the Chief\u2019s war for ratings. It would be his own. He would fight for the only thing that mattered: his family\u2019s peace.\n\nThat night, Adebayo sat with the lyrics to the Fela song, a pen in his hand. He began to cross out words, to write new ones in the margins. He took the song\u2019s themes of political oppression and corporate greed and refracted them through the small, powerful lens of his own experience. He wrote about the long lens of a camera that steals a child\u2019s image, about the rented privacy of a one-room flat, about a man who sells his story and finds his family paying the price. It was a direct, unambiguous message, a plea and a condemnation aimed squarely at the press and at the industry that fed them. It was a terrifying act of defiance, far more dangerous than simply changing a melody. This was sedition.\n\nOn the night of the show, as they stood in the wings, the roar of the crowd a physical pressure against their bodies, the tension between Adebayo and Slate was a palpable, static charge. They had not spoken a word to each other since their final, disastrous rehearsal. Slate, dressed in a sharp, military-style jacket, bounced on his toes, hyped and ready for battle. Adebayo stood perfectly still in a simple black shirt, the acoustic guitar strapped to his back, his face a calm, unreadable mask. Slate glanced at him, a final, taunting smirk on his lips. \u201cReady to get run over, old man? The beat waits for no one.\u201d Adebayo looked at him, his eyes holding a deep, quiet sorrow. \u201cI am not fighting you, my brother,\u201d he said, his voice barely a whisper. \u201cI am fighting for my own.\u201d Before Slate could process the strange response, their names were called, and they walked out into the blinding lights of the arena, two unwilling soldiers marching into a war where only one of them knew the true stakes.The stage lights flared, and the Chief\u2019s words, \u201cGive them a war,\u201d echoed in Adebayo\u2019s mind like a curse. The slick, aggressive beat dropped with the force of a slammed door, and MC Slate launched into his first verse. He was a master of his craft, a whirlwind of motion and sound. His rhymes were intricate, his delivery precise as a surgeon\u2019s scalpel, his body a conduit for the cold, synthetic fire of the track. He prowled the stage, his every gesture dripping with a confident, marketable swagger. The audience, primed for a battle, responded instantly, their heads nodding to the heavy 808-bass, their hands in the air. Slate was giving them exactly what they came for: a spectacle. He was playing his part in the Chief\u2019s arena perfectly, a gladiator dazzling the crowd with his flashy swordsmanship.\n\nAdebayo stood still, a quiet island in the storm of Slate\u2019s performance, the acoustic guitar a dormant weight on his back. The camera repeatedly cut to him, framing him as the passive, older man about to be devoured by the young lion\u2019s energy. He could feel the producers\u2019 glee in the control room, the narrative playing out just as they had designed it. Slate finished his verse with a final, explosive lyrical flourish, pointing a finger at Adebayo, a gesture of challenge that sent a fresh roar through the crowd. The beat pulsed, a hungry, expectant heartbeat, waiting for Adebayo to step into the lane they had prepared for him, to sing his assigned hook, to be the soulful counterpoint to Slate\u2019s jagged edges.\n\nIt was his turn. But Adebayo did not sing. Instead, he calmly unslung the acoustic guitar. The movement was slow, deliberate, a quiet act of sabotage in the high-tempo theatre of the show. He stepped forward, not to the main microphone, but to a secondary one typically used for backup singers. He looked across the stage, past the flashing lights, and met the eyes of the show\u2019s veteran musical director, a man he had spoken to only once. He gave a single, firm nod. The director, after a split second of stunned hesitation, seemed to understand. He raised a hand. The pounding electronic beat, the very lifeblood of Slate\u2019s performance, stuttered and died. An abrupt, shocking silence descended on the studio, a vacuum where a wall of sound had been moments before. Thousands of people, Slate, the judges, and the entire production crew held a collective breath.\n\nInto that silence, Adebayo played a single chord. It was a simple, minor chord, full of a quiet, sorrowful ache. It was the sound of a leaky roof and a single candle burning in the dark. Then, he began to sing, his voice not the soaring tenor of his gospel performances, but a low, conversational baritone, a voice telling a story to a friend. But his words were not Fela\u2019s. They were his own. \u201cYou see a story, you see a headline,\u201d he sang, his eyes finding the dark, unblinking lens of the main camera. \u201cI see the fear behind my child\u2019s curtain. You want my pain, you want my struggle? You can have the song, but you can\u2019t have her.\u201d The lyrics were a direct, unadorned missile. The air in the studio grew thick with a tension far deeper than competitive spirit. This was no longer a performance. It was a public reckoning.\n\nSlate stood frozen mid-stage, his swagger evaporated, his microphone hanging uselessly at his side. He looked from Adebayo to the judges and back again, his face a mask of pure disbelief. This was not the war he had signed up for. Adebayo continued, his voice gaining a quiet, steely strength, his fingers picking out the mournful melody. \u201cYou buy my neighbour\u2019s words for a silver coin, you plant your hunger in my quiet street. Is this brotherhood? Or just a hungry market, selling pieces of my life to the beat?\u201d Every word was a photograph, a specific indictment of the past week\u2019s horrors. He was singing directly to the press, to the producers, to the Chief himself. He was breaking the unspoken covenant of the show: that the performer\u2019s pain is a commodity to be exploited, never a weapon to be turned against the exploiters. He finished his verse, the final chord of the guitar hanging in the air like a question.\n\nHe looked over at Slate, his expression not one of triumph, but of weary invitation. \u201cMy brother,\u201d he sang, his voice softening, repurposing the song\u2019s original theme, \u201cthey build a wall between us two. They give you a crown and me a cross to bear. But their hungry cameras, they will come for you, when my story\u2019s old, and my soul is bare.\u201d For the first time, a flicker of understanding crossed Slate\u2019s face. He saw the trap for what it was. He was not Adebayo\u2019s opponent; he was just the next course on the menu. In a move that shocked everyone, most of all himself, Slate raised his microphone. But he did not rap. In a raw, unpolished singing voice, he echoed Adebayo\u2019s last line, his voice a stark harmony of dawning solidarity. \"When your story's old, and your soul is bare.\" Then he let the microphone fall to his side, effectively ceding the stage, the song, and the war. Adebayo finished the song alone, his final words a quiet, powerful prayer for peace, ending not with a bang, but with the soft, resonant fade of a single, hopeful major chord.\n\nThe aftermath was a silence more profound than any he had yet created. It was the silence of a truth that left no room for applause. The host stood by the side of the stage, his cue cards useless, his face pale. On the judges\u2019 panel, Femi Rhymz was on his feet, not clapping, but nodding slowly, his face a portrait of solemn respect. Zara Kalu was scribbling furiously, her mind already calculating the fallout, the potential for lawsuits, the catastrophic breach of contract. And Chief Obinna sat like a statue carved from volcanic rock. His face was devoid of all expression, but his eyes, fixed on Adebayo, burned with a cold, terrifying fire. He had wanted a gladiator to entertain his arena. Instead, a slave had stood up, addressed the emperor directly, and questioned the very existence of the games. Adebayo had not just broken the rules; he had shattered the illusion that held the entire enterprise together. He had done the one thing the Chief could not tolerate: he had taken his power back.As the last chord faded, the silence in the studio was a physical entity, a thick, suffocating blanket that smothered the usual post-performance hysteria. The host, a man paid for his seamless patter, stood frozen by the side of the stage, his face a comical mask of panic. The applause, when it finally came, was scattered and confused, quickly dying out as people looked at each other, unsure if they had witnessed an artistic triumph or a televised career suicide. Adebayo and Slate didn't wait for a verdict. In a silent, mutual understanding, they both turned and walked off stage, not towards the triumphant embrace of the other contestants, but towards the dark, uncertain corridors backstage.\n\nThe moment they were out of the audience\u2019s line of sight, the dam of professional composure broke. Stagehands scurried past them, avoiding their eyes. Producers with headsets were shouting into their microphones, their voices sharp with panic. Diana stood by a lighting rig, her face ashen, looking at Adebayo as if he were a ghost. They were intercepted not by a congratulatory crew member, but by two grim-faced security guards who wordlessly gestured for them to follow. They were led to a small, sterile green room, the kind reserved for problematic guests, and the door was shut behind them, leaving them in a sudden, ringing quiet.\n\nFor a long moment, neither man spoke. Slate paced the small room like a caged panther, running his hands over his head. He finally stopped and faced Adebayo, his eyes wide with a mixture of terror and incredulous respect. \u201cDo you have any idea what you just did?\u201d he breathed, his voice a hoarse whisper. \u201cYou didn\u2019t just change the lyrics. You pulled the pin on a grenade and handed it to Chief Obinna on live television. You read out a suicide note and signed my name to it.\u201d Adebayo sank onto a small sofa, the adrenaline finally leaving him, replaced by a profound, bone-deep weariness. He looked at the younger man, seeing not a rival, but a fellow inmate. \u201cI did what I had to do for my family,\u201d he said simply. Slate let out a short, sharp, humorless laugh. \u201cYour family? Old man, we are all his family now. And he does not like it when his children disobey.\u201d He slumped into a chair opposite Adebayo, the swagger completely stripped from him, leaving only a scared, ambitious young man who had just seen the gears of the machine he so desperately wanted to master. \u201cSo what happens now?\u201d Slate asked, the question hanging in the air between them, heavy and unanswered.\n\nThey didn't have to wait long. The door opened and the brisk woman with the headset stood there, her face impassive. \u201cThe Chief will see you. Both of you. Now.\u201d This time, the summons felt different. It was not a call to an office; it was a summons to an execution. They walked the long, silent corridors to the top floor, the two guards trailing them like an escort to the gallows. The Chief\u2019s office was darker than before, the city lights outside twinkling like a distant, indifferent galaxy. Chief Obinna was not alone. Zara Kalu sat stiffly in one of the leather chairs, her face pale. Femi Rhymz stood by the window, his back to the room, a silent statement of his discomfort. A third man, thin and severe in a grey suit Adebayo had not seen before, stood beside the Chief\u2019s desk, a leather-bound portfolio in his hand. He was clearly a lawyer.\n\nThe Chief did not invite them to sit. He let them stand in the centre of the room, a pair of errant schoolboys before the headmaster. He gestured to the lawyer. \u201cMr. Bello, please remind our two artists of the contractual obligations they so flagrantly violated tonight.\u201d The lawyer opened his portfolio and began to read in a dry, emotionless monotone, citing clauses about unauthorized lyrical changes, deviation from approved musical arrangements, and actions causing material damage to the show\u2019s brand and sponsor relationships. The list was long and the financial penalties attached to each violation were astronomical, sums of money so vast they seemed like a joke. Slate visibly paled, his bravado crumbling under the sheer weight of the numbers. Adebayo listened, his expression unchanged. He had never had that kind of money, so the threat of losing it was meaningless. He had only ever had his family and his voice, and he had just used one to defend the other.\n\n\u201cIn short,\u201d the Chief said, cutting the lawyer off, \u201cI own this show. I own the stage you stand on. I own the song you butchered. And according to this document, for the next seven years, I own you. I could sue you both into a state of poverty so absolute your grandchildren would be born into debt.\u201d He let the threat hang in the air, a sword dangling by a thread. He then turned his gaze entirely on Adebayo. \u201cHowever. Zara informs me that your little stunt has, paradoxically, been a ratings success. It seems the public enjoys watching a man set fire to his own house.\u201d A cold smile touched his lips. \u201cSo I will offer you a choice, Mr. Okoro. A chance for redemption. At the beginning of the next show, you will issue a full, public apology. You will state that you were overcome with emotion, that you acted unprofessionally, and that you are deeply grateful for the opportunities this platform has provided. You will then perform the song we assign you, exactly as we arrange it. You will be compliant, you will be humble, and you will do exactly as you are told. In return, I will forget this evening\u2019s transgression. The war, as you call it, will be over.\u201d\n\nThe offer was clear: capitulate completely, become the puppet they always wanted, or face total annihilation. Adebayo felt Slate\u2019s desperate gaze on him, silently pleading for him to take the deal. He looked at the Chief, at this man who built empires on the dreams of others, and he felt not fear, but a profound, clarifying calm. \u201cI will not apologize for protecting my family,\u201d he said, his voice quiet but unshakable. \u201cAnd I will not sing words that are not true. If you wish to sue me, you must do so. But I will not lie for you.\u201d Femi Rhymz turned from the window, a look of agonized pride on his face. The lawyer blinked, nonplussed. Zara closed her eyes. It was the Chief who slowly began to nod, as if Adebayo had just confirmed a long-held suspicion.\n\n\u201cI see,\u201d he said, his voice dropping to a deceptively soft tone. \u201cYou mistake a courtroom for my only weapon. You think this is a matter of contracts.\u201d He stood up and walked around his desk, stopping directly in front of Adebayo, so close that Adebayo could smell the expensive cologne he wore. The Chief\u2019s face was a mask of cold fury. \u201cLet me explain how power truly works, Mr. Okoro. I will not sue you. It\u2019s messy and public. Instead, I will make a few phone calls. A word to the landlord of The Palms Residence about a problematic tenant whose extended family is causing a disturbance. A quiet inquiry to the tax authorities about undeclared income from a small, cash-only hairdressing business. A suggestion to the immigration service to review the residency status of certain family members. I will not destroy you with a lawsuit, Mr. Okoro. I will simply unravel your life, thread by thread, from a thousand miles away, with a telephone. And no one will ever trace it back to me.\u201d He paused, his eyes like black stones. \u201cNow, ask yourself. Who is the real gladiator here?\u201d\n\nThe threat was a masterpiece of casual cruelty, so absolute and untraceable it left no room for defiance. It bypassed Adebayo entirely and went straight for the foundations of his world, for Funke and Amara. He felt the floor drop out from beneath him. He had faced down the cameras, the judges, the machine itself, but he had no defense against this, the quiet, administrative violence of a powerful man. He had won the battle on stage, but in this dark, silent office, he had been utterly and completely defeated. The Chief, seeing the broken look in his eyes, smiled, a victor\u2019s smile. \u201cI expect your apology to be very convincing,\u201d he said, turning and walking back to his desk. \u201cYou are dismissed.\u201d\n\nNumbly, Adebayo and Slate were escorted from the office. They rode the elevator down in a crushing silence. Slate looked at Adebayo, his earlier fear now replaced by a deep, weary pity. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, man,\u201d he whispered as the doors opened. Adebayo didn\u2019t respond. He walked through the now-deserted backstage area and out into the cool night air. The world felt tilted on its axis. He had sung his truth, and his truth had led him and his family to the edge of a cliff. He finally pulled out his phone, his hand trembling, and dialled Funke\u2019s number, dreading the sound of her voice. She answered, not with fear, but with a strange, breathless urgency. \u201cAdebayo? A car came. A black car, just like yours. A woman in a suit, she said she was from the production company. She said we had to pack one bag, that we were being moved somewhere safe for a few days.\u201d Adebayo\u2019s heart stopped. \u201cWhere? Where are you going?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said, her voice a mixture of terror and confusion. \u201cA hotel, she said. She gave me money. A lot of money. For food, for Amara. Adebayo\u2026 what is happening? I don\u2019t know if I am being rescued or taken hostage.\u201d The line crackled, and he heard the car door slam shut, followed by the sound of an engine starting. In the background, he heard Amara begin to cry.The sound of Amara\u2019s cry, cut off by the closing of a car door, was the most violent sound Adebayo had ever heard. It echoed in the vast, empty space where his defiance had lived just moments before. He stood on the pavement outside the studio complex, the city\u2019s indifferent lights blurring into streaks before his eyes. He was a king who had stormed the palace gates only to find the enemy was already inside his home, holding a knife to the throat of everything he loved. The Chief\u2019s threat was a poison that had bypassed his skin and gone straight to his soul, paralyzing him from the inside out. He stumbled to a nearby bus stop bench and sank onto it, the cold plastic a shock against his legs. His phone felt impossibly heavy in his hand. Funke was in a car, going to an unknown location, and he did not know if she was a hostage or a protected asset. The ambiguity was a form of torture all its own.\n\nHis fingers, clumsy with a tremor he could not control, dialled the only number that might hold an answer. Zara Kalu picked up on the first ring, her voice crisp and alert, as if she had been expecting his call. \"Adebayo,\" she said, her tone devoid of surprise. He dispensed with any greeting. \"My family,\" he rasped, his voice a dry husk. \"Where are they?\" There was a brief pause on the other end, the sound of a pen tapping against a desk. \"They are safe,\" she said, her voice a cool statement of fact. \"I had them moved to a serviced apartment in Ikoyi. It's clean, it's secure, and most importantly, it's anonymous. The press will not find them there.\" The relief that washed over him was so immense it was physically painful, a cramp in his chest that stole his breath. But it was immediately followed by a cold wave of suspicion. This was not an act of charity. Zara Kalu did not perform acts of charity.\n\n\"Why?\" he asked, the word a shard of glass in his throat. He heard her sigh, a sound of faint, professional impatience. \"Because your public breakdown, while good for ratings, has created a logistical nightmare. Your family was under siege, a situation which was making you unstable. An unstable asset is a depreciating asset, Adebayo. I simply stabilized the situation. Consider it an advance against your future earnings. Nothing is free.\" There it was. The cold, brutal transaction at the heart of everything. She had not saved his family; she had moved them from a cage made of peeling paint and poverty into a cleaner, more expensive cage, and in doing so, had fastened a new, stronger leash around his neck. \"The apartment is paid for. The fridge is stocked. Your wife has been given a per diem for sundries. They are comfortable. And they will remain so, as long as you are\u2026 cooperative.\" The word hung in the air between them, a perfectly polished threat.\n\nFunke stood in the middle of a living room that was larger than their entire flat. The air smelled faintly of bleach and air freshener, a sterile, impersonal scent. Amara, startled by the strange surroundings, had finally cried herself to sleep in Funke\u2019s arms. The woman in the suit, whose name Funke had already forgotten, had left them with two key cards and a thick envelope of cash on the polished dining table. \u201cFor your expenses,\u201d she had said with a tight smile. \u201cSomeone will be in touch.\u201d Funke walked through the apartment, her bare feet silent on the cool, tiled floor. There was a kitchen with a gleaming, unused stove and a refrigerator humming with fullness. There were two bedrooms with clean, white sheets turned down on the beds. The bathroom had a stack of fluffy white towels and tiny bottles of soap. It was a perfect, soulless imitation of a home. She looked out the window, down ten stories to a quiet street lined with expensive cars and guarded gates. There were no neighbours shouting, no generators rumbling, no smell of fried plantain in the air. She was safe from the press, from the prying eyes, from the daily grind of her old life. And she had never felt more imprisoned.\n\nHe met Zara the next day in a quiet caf\u00e9, a place so discreet and expensive that the air itself seemed to hum with the sound of money. She slid a key card across the table to him. \u201cThe address for the apartment,\u201d she said. \u201cYou may visit, but you will be discreet. No grand entrances.\u201d Adebayo looked at the key card, a small piece of plastic that represented both his family\u2019s safety and his own capitulation. He pushed it back towards her. \u201cWhat do you want from me?\u201d he asked, his voice flat. Zara took a sip of her espresso, her eyes appraising him over the rim of the tiny cup. \u201cI want what the Chief wants,\u201d she said bluntly. \u201cAn apology. A performance. Compliance. You had your moment of rebellion, Adebayo. It was spectacular television. But the story now requires a new arc: redemption. The prodigal son returns to the fold, humbled and grateful. The public will love it. It\u2019s a classic for a reason.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd if I refuse?\u201d he asked, the question a hollow echo of the man he had been twenty-four hours earlier. Zara placed her cup down with a soft click. \u201cIf you refuse, the apartment in Ikoyi will cease to be available. The per diem will stop. And the Chief will pick up his telephone. My job is to manage the asset, Adebayo. If the asset refuses to perform, it gets liquidated. I am not your friend. I am not your saviour. I am the person telling you, in very clear terms, how to survive. You have a beautiful voice and a powerful story. Don't be a fool and throw it all away for a pride that will not feed your daughter.\u201d She stood, placing a few bills on the table. \u201cYour rehearsal with Diana is at two. Your song is \u2018Bridge Over Troubled Water\u2019. I trust you\u2019ll find the theme appropriate.\u201d She gave him a final, dismissive look and walked out of the caf\u00e9, leaving him alone with the key card and the bitter taste of his defeat.\n\nThe journey to the apartment in Ikoyi felt like a pilgrimage to the site of his own surrender. He found Funke sitting by the large window, staring down at the silent street, Amara sleeping on a clean blanket at her feet. She looked up as he entered, her eyes tired but sharp. She did not run to him, did not embrace him. She simply watched him, waiting. He knelt down beside Amara, his large hand stroking her soft hair, the familiar ritual a painful anchor in this strange new world. \u201cAre you alright?\u201d he whispered to Funke. She gave a short, humorless laugh. \u201cI have food I did not have to cook, light that does not depend on a generator, and a door with three locks. I am a queen in a palace, my husband. How can I not be alright?\u201d Her sarcasm was a shield, protecting a core of fear and anger he knew was directed as much at him as at their unseen captors.\n\nHe sat on the floor opposite her, the space between them filled with the enormity of his failure. \u201cThey want me to apologize,\u201d he said, the words costing him more than any song ever had. \u201cOn the next show. I have to tell them I was wrong.\u201d He waited for her condemnation, for the disappointment in her voice. But Funke simply nodded, her gaze fixed on her sleeping daughter. \u201cAnd will you?\u201d she asked, her voice neutral. \u201cI have no choice,\u201d he confessed, the admission a final, painful surrender. \u201cThey\u2026 they will hurt us, Funke. Not just me. Us. You. Our life.\u201d She reached out and placed her hand on his, her touch a spark of warmth in the cold, air-conditioned room. \u201cI know,\u201d she said softly. \u201cI have known since they put us in this car. We are their property now, Adebayo. You have been from the beginning. I am just catching up.\u201d She looked at him then, her eyes clear and unblinking. \u201cSo go. Apologize. Thank them for the golden chains. We are survivors, my love. We will do what we must. Sing their song. But when you sing, sing it for us. Let it be our secret, in the middle of their noise.\u201d\n\nHis rehearsal with Diana was a quiet, somber affair. He walked in, accepted the sheet music for the Simon & Garfunkel classic, and stood by the piano. He did not argue. He did not offer his own interpretation. He simply waited for her instruction. Diana, clearly briefed on the new world order, was all brisk professionalism. \u201cThe arrangement is simple. Piano, strings. Very sincere. You will stand centre stage. You will look into the camera. You will be humble,\u201d she instructed. He nodded. When she asked him to sing, he opened his mouth and the song came out, perfectly on pitch, perfectly controlled, and utterly empty. The fire was gone. The raw, unvarnished soul that had captivated a nation was banked, hidden away behind a wall of compliance. Diana listened, a small, satisfied smile on her face. This was the singer she had wanted all along: a flawless vocalist, a beautiful vessel with nothing inside. As he sang the famous lines, \u201cWhen you're weary, feeling small\u2026 I will be your bridge,\u201d he wasn\u2019t thinking of the audience or the judges. He was thinking of Funke\u2019s hand on his, and the quiet, terrible strength in her voice as she told him to survive. He would be their bridge, a bridge made of his own humiliation, to carry them over this troubled water. And he would let them all watch him do it.The night of the show, Adebayo was dressed in a simple, dark suit, a uniform of solemnity chosen by the stylists to complement his new role as the repentant sinner. There was no guitar waiting for him in the wings, no quiet corner for a moment of solitary preparation. He was led from the dressing room to the backstage area by a production assistant who hovered around him like a nervous warden, ensuring he didn't stray from the pre-approved path. The air, which on previous nights had crackled with a vibrant, competitive energy, was now thick with a different kind of tension. The other contestants avoided his eyes, their whispers ceasing as he drew near. He was a walking ghost story, a cautionary tale about flying too high and falling too far. His public humiliation was to be the opening act, and no one wanted to stand too close to the man about to be sacrificed.\n\nDiana approached him, not with her usual mix of fury or fawning, but with a cool, detached professionalism. She straightened his tie, her fingers clinical and cold. \u201cRemember what we discussed, Adebayo,\u201d she said, her voice low. \u201cThe teleprompter has your statement. Read it exactly as written. No ad-libs, no soulful pauses. And when you sing, remember the notes, not the narrative. We need sincerity, not drama.\u201d She looked him in the eye, and for a fleeting moment, he saw not a coach, but a fellow employee doing a distasteful job. \u201cJust get through it,\u201d she added, her voice dropping almost to a whisper, before turning away.\n\nThe host\u2019s voice boomed through the studio, welcoming the nation back to the show. The introduction was a masterpiece of sanctimonious spin. \u201cLast week, we witnessed a moment of raw, untamed passion. A moment that reminded us that our artists are not just performers, but human beings with deep emotions. Tonight, Adebayo Okoro has something he wants to share with all of us, from the heart.\u201d The lie was so blatant, so perfectly packaged, that Adebayo felt a moment of dizzying detachment, as if he were watching a show about a man who looked just like him. He walked onto the stage into a pool of soft, forgiving light, the audience a sea of expectant faces. The teleprompter glowed in the darkness opposite him, the words stark and white. He took a breath, not of air, but of pure, cold resignation, and began to read the script of his own surrender.\n\n\u201cGood evening,\u201d he began, his voice a flat, hollow echo of its usual richness. \u201cI want to apologize for my conduct during last week\u2019s show.\u201d The words felt like stones in his mouth. \u201cIn a moment of overwhelming emotion, I behaved unprofessionally, and I deeply disrespected my fellow artist, the producers, and this entire platform.\u201d He could feel thousands of eyes on him, and the unblinking red light of the camera lens, a soulless eye demanding its pound of flesh. He forced himself to continue, the script scrolling upwards, pulling him along. \u201cThis competition has given me an opportunity beyond my wildest dreams, a chance to provide a new life for my family. I am profoundly grateful to Chief Obinna, the judges, and the entire Naija Star Voice team for their belief in me. I promise to honour that belief from this day forward.\u201d He finished, the last word falling into a thick, uncomfortable silence. He had done it. He had danced for them.\n\nThen, the gentle, familiar chords of a piano filled the studio, and the orchestra swelled behind it, a lush, sentimental wave of sound designed to wash away the memory of his defiance. He stood at the center of the stage, a solitary figure, as the introduction to \u2018Bridge Over Troubled Water\u2019 began. He closed his eyes for a second, not to find a deep well of emotion, but to see Funke\u2019s face, her eyes telling him to survive. He would be her bridge. He opened his eyes, found the main camera, and began to sing. The voice that emerged was beautiful. It was technically perfect, every note held with impeccable control, every phrase shaped with a craftsman\u2019s precision. It was the voice of a man who had been expertly coached, a flawless instrument playing a flawless song. But it was a voice scrubbed clean of its own history. The harmattan dust, the thickness of palm wine, the unspent gold\u2014it was all gone, locked away in a place the cameras and the coaches could not reach.\n\nHe sang the words of comfort and sacrifice, his performance a masterclass in feigned sincerity. When he sang the line, \u201cI will lay me down,\u201d the camera zoomed in on his face, capturing a flicker of what looked like deep, soulful emotion in his eyes. The audience sighed, moved by the sight of the humbled man offering himself up. But Adebayo was not performing for them. In his mind, he was laying himself down on the sharp, cold stones of the Chief\u2019s power, creating a path for Funke and Amara to walk across, away from the danger he had brought upon them. The performance was a public act of submission, but its intent was a secret act of love. He was building the bridge with the pieces of his own broken pride. He finished the song, his voice fading into the lush swell of the strings, his final note a perfect, polished, and utterly heartbreaking sound.\n\nThe ovation was immediate and thunderous, far louder than the confused applause of the week before. This was a narrative the audience understood and embraced: the fall and the redemption. The judges rose to their feet. Zara Kalu clapped with a satisfied, proprietary smile. Chief Obinna offered a series of slow, deliberate claps, a king applauding a jester who had learned his lesson. It was Femi Rhymz who looked genuinely pained, his applause seeming reluctant. \u201cWelcome back, Adebayo,\u201d he said when the noise died down, his voice heavy. \u201cIt takes a big man to admit his faults, and an even bigger one to sing with such\u2026 humility. That was a beautiful performance.\u201d The praise felt like acid. They were applauding his chains, celebrating the strength of his cage.\n\nBackstage, the spell was broken. The atmosphere had shifted once more. He was no longer a ghost; he was a tame lion, an object of pity. Contestants who had feared him now patted his shoulder with condescending sympathy. \u201cTough night, man, but you handled it,\u201d one said. \u201cThat took guts,\u201d said another, though his eyes said it took a complete lack of them. MC Slate was standing by the door of the dressing room as Adebayo approached. He didn\u2019t offer a platitude. He simply met Adebayo\u2019s gaze and gave a single, slow nod, a gesture that conveyed a universe of shared, bitter understanding. It was a soldier\u2019s salute to a fallen comrade.\n\nAdebayo found a quiet corridor, the sounds of the show fading behind him, and dialled Funke\u2019s number. He felt hollowed out, a vessel emptied of everything that made him himself. She answered instantly. \"I watched,\" she said, her voice quiet, steady. He waited, bracing for what might come next. \"It was a beautiful song,\" she continued, and his heart sank. She had seen the puppet, not the man. \"And your apology,\" she added, \"was very convincing.\" He squeezed his eyes shut, the shame a physical heat on his face. Then, after a pause, her voice changed, losing its formal distance, becoming the voice he knew, the voice that anchored him. \"But I did not hear the apology,\" she whispered, her voice dropping so low it was almost a secret. \"And I did not hear the song they gave you.\" He held his breath. \"I heard you building a bridge, my love,\" she said, her voice thick with unshed tears. \"I heard every single stone you laid down. We are on the other side, Adebayo. We are safe, because of you.\" In the sterile hallway of the studio, surrounded by the architecture of his defeat, Adebayo leaned his head against the cool wall and cried, silent tears of grief and gratitude tracking paths through the makeup on his face. He had lost the war, but he had not lost everything.The days that followed his public apology took on a uniform, grey-toned stillness. Adebayo had become a ghost in the machine, a perfectly functioning component that drew no special attention. In the compound, the atmosphere around him shifted from pity to a kind of polite indifference. He was no longer the explosive, unpredictable force to be feared or revered; he was the tame lion, neutered and safe, and therefore, profoundly uninteresting. He would sit at the long dining table for meals, and the boisterous chatter of the other contestants would flow around him, their conversations about social media followers and celebrity gossip parting like a river around a stone. He was included in the headcount, but excluded from the lifeblood of the house. He had been reabsorbed into the background, a transition that was both a relief and a slow, creeping erasure of self.\n\nHis visits to the apartment in Ikoyi were his only anchor to reality, though it was a strange, distorted version of it. A black car would ferry him there twice a week, a silent driver navigating the manicured streets, the journey a passage between two different cages. He would step into the cool, air-conditioned silence of the apartment and find Funke trying to impose their life onto the sterile space. She would cook jollof rice on the gleaming induction stove, but the smell wouldn\u2019t cling to the walls the right way. She would spread her weaving materials on the expensive rug, the familiar colours a small rebellion against the beige and cream decor. Amara was now crawling, a small, determined explorer charting the vast, empty territory of the living room floor. Each visit, Adebayo would notice a new change in his daughter\u2014a new sound, a new dexterity in her tiny hands\u2014and each discovery was a fresh pang of grief for the life he was missing, the daily miracles he had traded for this high-stakes performance.\n\nThey would sit together after Amara was asleep, the city lights glittering below them like a field of fallen stars. The television would be off. The shared silence between them was no longer tense, but thick with a shared, unspoken understanding. They were partners in a long, quiet heist of their own survival. \"I feel like one of Mrs. Ede's friends,\" Funke confessed one evening, her voice low as she looked out the window. \"I have not touched a Naira note that I have earned myself in three weeks. A man brings groceries in a box. I wear clean clothes I did not wash. I am a kept woman, Adebayo. I am safe and I am suffocating.\" He had no words of comfort that weren't a lie. Her agency had been the price of their safety. He took her hand, the calluses on her fingertips, once a testament to her hard work, now softened by a life of enforced idleness. Her strength was being leached away, and it was his fault.\n\nThe competition marched on. The theme for the next show was \u2018Viewer\u2019s Choice\u2019, and the public, having thoroughly enjoyed the drama of his fall and redemption, voted for him to sing a soaring, epic power ballad about overcoming adversity. It was the most obvious, sentimental choice imaginable, and the production team was ecstatic. Diana coached him with a new, simplified mandate: just sound beautiful. His rehearsal sessions were models of efficiency. He learned the melody, memorized the breathing patterns, and delivered the song with the flawless precision of a studio recording. He poured no part of himself into it. He was a vessel, and the song simply passed through him, leaving no trace.\n\nOn the live show, he stood centre stage, bathed in a dramatic blue light, and performed the ballad. His voice was immense, filling the studio with its power and clarity. He hit the climactic high note with a technical perfection that made the judges gasp. It was, by any objective measure, a stunning vocal performance. The audience gave him a standing ovation. The judges were effusive. \u201cIncredible consistency, Adebayo!\u201d Zara praised, her smile wide and genuine. \u201cYou prove week after week what a world-class vocalist you are.\u201d But online, the reaction was more muted. The hashtag #NaijaHeart, which had once set the internet ablaze, was quiet. The comments praised his voice but were missing the fervent, personal connection. \u201cHe sings like an angel,\u201d one comment read, \u201cbut I don\u2019t feel it anymore.\u201d The public didn\u2019t want a perfect singer. They wanted the man who bled on stage, and that man was gone. He was winning the competition, but he was losing his audience.\n\nThe quiet understanding between him and MC Slate solidified into a strange, unspoken alliance. They would find themselves in the same corner of the garden late at night, two smokers sharing a patch of darkness without needing to exchange a light. One night, Slate broke the silence. \"How do you do it?\" he asked, his voice stripped of its usual bravado. \"How do you get on that stage and just\u2026 switch it all off? I watched you tonight. Your eyes were dead.\" Adebayo looked at the glowing tip of his own imaginary cigarette, a habit he didn't have but whose posture he understood. \"I think of my daughter,\" he answered, his voice rough. \"I think of the price of the food she is eating. And then I sing the notes.\" Slate was quiet for a long time, absorbing the bleakness of the answer. \"My father took out a loan for my first mixtape,\" he said, the confession offered up into the darkness. \"My whole village thinks I'm already a star. They don't know I'm deeper in debt now than when I started. We're all just singing for someone else, aren't we?\" In that moment, the rapper from Jos and the caretaker from Lagos were just two men, trapped in the same gilded cage, trying to remember the sound of their own voices.\n\nOne afternoon, his phone rang with an unfamiliar number. He answered cautiously. The voice on the other end was hesitant, familiar. It was Bola, one of the younger security guards from The Palms, a good-natured boy who used to ask Adebayo for advice about his girlfriend. \"Adebayo-sir? Is that you?\" Bola whispered, as if afraid of being overheard. \"It is me, Bola. How are you?\" A wave of nostalgia, sharp and painful, washed over Adebayo. It was a message from a life that felt a century away. \"I am fine, Bola. What is it?\" There was a pause. \"Sir, I just thought you should know,\" Bola said, his voice full of awkward sympathy. \"The\u2026 your flat. The one at the back. There is a new family there. The man is the new head of maintenance. They moved in last week.\"\n\nThe words landed not like a punch, but like the slow, quiet closing of a heavy door. Adebayo stood on the lush, perfectly manicured lawn of the compound, the afternoon sun warm on his skin, and felt a profound, internal chill. He knew, logically, that life at The Palms would move on without him. But the finality of it, the simple fact of another family living in their space, sleeping on the floor where he and Funke had whispered their dreams, was a brutal confirmation of his new reality. His past had not just been left behind; it had been erased, painted over, occupied by someone else. The bridge he had built for his family was strong and it had carried them to safety, but he now saw with devastating clarity that it was a one-way street, and the shore he had departed from had already crumbled into the sea. There was no going home.The news about his flat was not a thunderclap; it was the quiet, inexorable settling of a building\u2019s foundation. The structure of his past, which he had thought he was merely vacationing from, had been demolished and rebuilt in his absence. He was not on leave; he was obsolete. The realization settled deep in his bones during the following days, a cold and heavy truth. The scent of lemon polish and old dust, once the perfume of his life, was now a phantom limb, an ache for something that no longer existed. He had traded his world for a chance to save his family, only to find that the world he\u2019d left behind had ceased to exist, making his sacrifice both total and irreversible.\n\nThis new, hollowed-out version of Adebayo was, to the producers, the perfect contestant. He was reliable, professional, and beautifully, tragically sad. He did as he was told. He hit his notes. He posed for the cameras. And he was dying inside. The grand finale was announced, and the theme was the one he had been dreading most: \u2018Original Song\u2019. Each of the final three contestants\u2014Adebayo, a powerhouse female vocalist from Warri named Efe, and the ever-present MC Slate\u2014was to write and perform a song that defined their journey. For Slate, it was an opportunity to showcase his lyrical genius. For Efe, it was a chance to deliver a show-stopping ballad of empowerment. For Adebayo, it was a death sentence. He had been so thoroughly deconstructed, so expertly coached away from his own instincts, that he no longer knew what his own voice sounded like, let alone what song it wanted to sing.\n\nHe sat for hours in his sterile room with a notebook and a guitar, trying to write. He attempted to craft the song they wanted, the one that fit the \u2018Heart of Naija\u2019 brand. It was a soaring ballad about a man who rose from poverty, a song of gratitude and triumph, full of sweeping metaphors about mountains and stars. The melody was pleasant. The lyrics were inspirational. And it was the most profound lie he had ever constructed. Every chord he played felt like a betrayal, every word a cheap imitation of the feelings he was supposed to have. The wellspring of his music, the unspent gold in his throat, had been buried under layers of compliance and fear. He could not find it. The notebook remained mostly empty.\n\nHis next visit to the apartment in Ikoyi felt different. The news about their old flat hung in the air between him and Funke, a shared, unspoken grief. She was quieter than usual, her movements slower as she went about the strange, listless rhythm of her new life. After they had put a restless Amara to bed, they stood by the vast window, looking down at the silent, orderly city. \u201cIt\u2019s gone, then,\u201d Funke said, her voice so soft he barely heard it. She wasn\u2019t looking at him, but at the reflection of their two silhouettes in the glass. \u201cOur home.\u201d He reached for her hand. \u201cIt was just a place, Funke. Two rooms.\u201d \u201cIt was the place you first sang to Amara,\u201d she countered, her voice gaining a sharp edge of pain. \u201cIt was the place I held your hand when the power was out and you told me about your foolish dreams. It was our place. And now it is nothing.\u201d He had no answer. He could only stand beside her, a co-conspirator in the erasure of their own history.\n\nHe expected her anger, her sorrow, even her blame. What he did not expect was for her to turn from the window, her eyes dry and fiercely bright. \u201cSo, this is it,\u201d she said, her voice no longer soft, but imbued with a hard, brittle strength. \u201cThis apartment. This life of waiting for a car to bring you to us, of eating food someone else has bought. This is what we get for the price of that room?\u201d He shook his head, lost. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you mean.\u201d \u201cI mean,\u201d she said, stepping closer to him, her intensity a physical force, \u201cthat if we have given up our home, our life, our very selves for this competition, then you must not come back here with anything less than a victory. You cannot just survive this thing, Adebayo. You have to finish it. You have to win it. Not for them. For us. So that this\u2026 this gilded cage\u2026 was not for nothing. Go. Write your song. And win.\u201d She was not asking him to comply anymore. She was commanding him to conquer. She was giving him his purpose back, not as a dreamer, but as a fighter with a final, specific mission.\n\nHe returned to the compound that night with Funke\u2019s command echoing in his soul. *Finish it.* He sat with the empty notebook, but his mind was not on the finale or the judges. He was thinking of the bridge he had built. He had thought it was a bridge to safety, but Funke had made him see it was a bridge to this new, sterile world, a world where she was slowly suffocating. Winning was no longer about the money or the fame. It was about earning the right to tear down this safe house and build a real home, one of their own choosing. But the song still wouldn\u2019t come. The weight of their sacrifice was too heavy; it crushed his creativity. Defeated, he pulled out his phone, seeking the one true thing in his life: a glimpse of his daughter. He scrolled through the videos Funke had sent. He found one from that afternoon. It was a short, shaky clip of Amara. She was holding onto the leg of a coffee table, her small body trembling with effort. She let go, her face a mask of intense concentration. She took one wobbly, uncertain step. Then another. And then she tumbled onto the soft rug, looked up at the camera, and broke into a wide, triumphant, drool-covered grin.\n\nAdebayo watched the video again, and again, a sob catching in his throat. It was not a memory of the past. It was a vision of the future. It was a beginning. And in that moment, the song arrived. It came not as a soaring ballad of overcoming adversity, but as a quiet, simple melody, the kind of tune a father would hum while trying to build a foundation. The lyrics were not about rising from the dust; they were about laying the first stone. It was a song about the terrifying, sacred duty of fatherhood, about building a home not of bricks and mortar, but of love and legacy. It was a promise to his daughter, a quiet vow that her first steps would be on ground that was truly their own. He titled it \u2018Amara\u2019s Floor\u2019.\n\nHe wrote through the night, the words and music flowing out of him as if a dam had broken. It was his voice, his true voice, unadorned and honest. The song was spare and beautiful, filled with the texture of his life\u2014not the past life of lemon polish, but his present life as a father fighting for a future. The next morning, exhausted but exhilarated, he sought out the one person in the whole machinery he thought might understand. He found Femi Rhymz in a small, private lounge, away from the other judges. The Afrobeats star looked surprised to see him. \u201cAdebayo. What\u2019s up?\u201d Adebayo stood before him, his notebook in his hand. \u201cI have my song for the finale,\u201d he said. \u201cI wanted\u2026 I thought you should hear it first.\u201d Femi raised an eyebrow, intrigued. He gestured to a chair. Adebayo sat, took a deep breath, and, without his guitar, sang his song, his voice a low, intimate hum in the quiet room. He sang of his daughter\u2019s first steps, of the hollow echo in an empty, expensive apartment, of the promise of a floor that would belong only to her.\n\nWhen he finished, the silence in the room was absolute. Femi stared at him, his cool, celebrity posture gone, his expression one of profound, unguarded emotion. \u201cThat song\u2026\u201d he started, his voice thick, \u201cthat is the most honest thing I have heard in ten years in this business.\u201d He leaned forward, his eyes serious. \u201cYou know they won\u2019t like it. It\u2019s not a \u2018finale\u2019 song. It\u2019s too quiet, too personal. It doesn\u2019t scream \u2018winner\u2019. It whispers \u2018truth\u2019.\u201d Adebayo nodded. \u201cI know.\u201d Femi stood up and walked to the window, looking out at the city below. \u201cThe Chief wants a product he can sell to the masses. A victory song. You give them this\u2026 you are handing the crown to Efe or Slate on a platter. You will lose the competition.\u201d He turned back to face Adebayo, a wry, sad smile on his face. \u201cBut you will win yourself back.\u201d He clapped Adebayo on the shoulder, a gesture of solidarity. \u201cMy job is to judge what I see on the stage. But as a man, Adebayo\u2026 as a man, I hope you have the courage to lose.\u201d",

It clung to his clothes, settled in his nostrils, and followed him home in the evenings. He pushed the heavy-duty buffer across the marble floor of The Palms Residence lobby, its drone a familiar bassline to the melody he hummed under his breath. The machine whirred, and Adebayo\u2019s voice, a low and smooth tenor, rose to fill the space, chasing the drone and dancing with the echo in the high-ceilinged emptiness. It was a gospel tune, one his mother used to sing while braiding his hair, a song about faith and mountains and the mustard seed of a dream.\n\nThe machine shuddered to a halt. In the sudden silence, his last note hung in the air, pure and clear as a drop of water.\n\n\u201cIs that you, Adebayo? Making all that racket?\u201d\n\nHe straightened up, his back protesting with a dull ache. Mrs Ede stood at the top of the grand staircase, her hands on her silk-wrapped hips, her face a mask of mild irritation. She was a woman whose wealth was as loud as the gold bangles that jangled on her wrists.\n\n\u201cSorry, Madam. Just finishing the floors.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith all that\u2026 wailing? It sounds like a sick goat.\u201d She descended the stairs, the click of her heels on the marble like a metronome counting his failings. But as she drew closer, the corner of her mouth twitched. It was a game they played. She would complain, and he would be deferential, and they would both pretend she didn't sometimes pause outside the lobby just to listen. \u201cAnyway, the lift on B-wing is making that funny noise again. Like a dying man. See to it. Mr Bankole is complaining his guests were very disturbed last night.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, Madam. Straight away.\u201d\n\nHe watched her go, a galleon in full sail, leaving a wake of expensive perfume that failed to mask the scent of polish. He leaned the buffer against a pillar and wiped a slick of sweat from his brow with the back of his hand. A sick goat. He smiled a little. He had been called worse. His voice, he knew, was not for everyone. It was not the thin, reedy pop that saturated the radio waves. It was thick, like palm wine, with a texture of harmattan dust and a warmth that came from the very centre of his chest. It was the only thing in his life that felt entirely his own. Not borrowed, not rented, not beholden to the whims of the wealthy residents of The Palms.\n\nHis own flat, a small two-room affair tacked onto the back of the main building, was a world away from the air-conditioned splendour of the lobby. Here, the air was thick with the competing smells of fried plantain and baby powder. The drone of the generator outside was the constant, rumbling heartbeat of their lives.\n\nFunke was on a mat on the floor, deftly weaving thread into a customer\u2019s hair, her fingers moving with a practiced, hypnotic speed. The customer was scrolling through her phone, oblivious. And in a cot in the corner, a small mound under a light blanket, was Amara. His Amara. His heart.\n\nFunke looked up as he entered, her eyes tired but holding a familiar light. \u201cAh, you are back. Food is on the stove.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow is she?\u201d he whispered, his gaze fixed on the cot.\n\n\u201cSleeping like the world is not on fire,\u201d Funke murmured, not missing a single twist of her fingers. \u201cMrs Ojo came to collect the stew. She said to thank you for the extra ginger.\u201d\n\nHe nodded, moving quietly towards the cot. He leaned over, his large frame casting a shadow. Amara\u2019s tiny chest rose and fell in a steady, perfect rhythm. Her face, smooshed against the mattress, was a study in serenity. He could watch her for hours. This tiny person, this miracle of flesh and blood, had reconfigured his entire universe. Every song he sang now had her face in it. Every dream of a better life had her small hand tucked inside his. He reached in and gently stroked a cheek, skin softer than any silk Mrs Ede could ever wrap herself in.\n\nLater, after the customer had left, admiring her new braids in the reflection of their small, cracked mirror, and the stew was eaten, they sat together in the near-darkness, the only light coming from the flickering screen of a small television perched on a stack of books. The generator had coughed into silence an hour ago, plunging their neighbourhood into a familiar, shared darkness.\n\n\u201cThey are advertising it again,\u201d Adebayo said, his voice low.\n\nOn the screen, bright, flashing colours exploded. A handsome host with teeth too white to be real promised \u201cA NEW LIFE! FAME! FORTUNE!\u201d It was the advert for \u2018Naija Star Voice\u2019, the biggest singing competition in the country. The screen showed clips of past winners: a young woman crying as confetti rained down, a man holding a giant cheque, a montage of studio sessions and cheering crowds. It was a fantasy packaged and sold in thirty-second bursts.\n\nFunke sighed, leaning her head against his shoulder. Her hair smelled of coconut oil. \u201cAde, please. Don\u2019t start with this thing again.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you hear them, Funke. Some of them\u2026 I can sing better than them.\u201d It sounded like boasting, and he hated it, but it was the truth. He had heard them. He had perfect pitch, a gift from God, and he could hear the slight waver, the strained high note, the lack of genuine soul.\n\n\u201cSinging in the church choir is not the same as this thing. This is for\u2026 other people. People with connections. People who can pay for votes.\u201d She shifted, her voice laced with the hard-edged pragmatism that life had taught her. \u201cWe have Amara. We have rent. My hair business is slow. We don\u2019t have time for dreams, my love. We have to be serious.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is because of Amara,\u201d he insisted, his voice rising with a passion he couldn\u2019t suppress. \u201cIt is *for* her. Imagine, Funke. Just imagine if I won. We would have our own house. A proper house, with a garden. No more generators. No more pleasing Mrs Ede. You could open your own salon, a real one, not just\u2026 here.\u201d He gestured around their cramped room, at the peeling paint and the single, buzzing lightbulb that would work again when the power returned, maybe.\n\n\u201cAnd imagine if you don\u2019t,\u201d she countered softly, her words a pinprick to his ballooning fantasy. \u201cThe money for transport to the auditions. The time off work. What will we eat? Hope?\u201d\n\nHe fell silent. She was right, of course. She was always right. Her feet were planted so firmly on the ground they seemed to have grown roots. His were always trying to float away. He looked at the television. A new contestant was singing, a girl in a glittery dress. Her voice was thin but passable. The judges, famous musicians and producers, were nodding along with serious expressions. They looked like gods on a mountain, deciding fates. Could a caretaker, a man who smelled of polish and spent his days fixing other people\u2019s problems, ever be allowed onto that mountain?\n\nThe next day, the thought was a persistent hum beneath the drone of the buffer. He scrubbed a stubborn stain on the third-floor landing, the words of a new song forming in his head. It was a song about a man with calloused hands and a voice full of unspent gold. As he worked, Mr Bankole\u2019s youngest son, a university student named Tunde, walked past, his headphones leaking the tinny beat of an Afrobeats song. Tunde paused.\n\n\u201cYo, Adebayo,\u201d he said, pulling one headphone off. \u201cIs that you I hear singing all the time?\u201d\n\nAdebayo straightened, wary. \u201cSorry, sir. I did not mean to disturb.\u201d\n\nTunde laughed, a bright, easy sound. \u201cDisturb? Man, you\u2019re good. Like, properly good. You ever think of doing something with that? For real.\u201d\n\nThe simple, unprompted praise landed in Adebayo\u2019s chest like a stone in a quiet pool. \u201cMy wife says I should be serious,\u201d he mumbled, fiddling with the handle of his mop.\n\n\u201cSerious? Bro, a voice like that is serious business! You heard about Naija Star Voice? The auditions are next week in Surulere. You should totally go.\u201d Tunde tapped his phone. \u201cLook, it\u2019s all over Insta. You\u2019d kill it.\u201d\n\nHe showed Adebayo the screen, the same flashing logo, the same impossibly white teeth of the host. But seeing it on Tunde\u2019s phone, presented as a real and achievable thing, made it seem different. Closer.\n\nThat night, after Funke and Amara were asleep, Adebayo stayed up. He took out his old smartphone, the one with a spiderweb of cracks across the screen. The Palms had Wi-Fi, a fast, unlimited connection for the residents. But if he stood in the corner of his bedroom, pressed right up against the wall that bordered the main building, he could sometimes catch a weak, stray signal. One bar. Sometimes two, if he was lucky.\n\nHe found the application page. Full Name: Adebayo Okoro. Age: 32. Occupation. He hesitated for a long time, his thumb hovering over the keypad. He could write \u2018Vocalist\u2019. \u2018Musician\u2019. But it felt like a lie. With a sigh, he typed the truth: \u2018Caretaker\u2019.\n\nHe filled out the rest of the form, his heart thumping a nervous rhythm against his ribs. He had to upload a video. He didn't have one. Panic began to prickle his skin. Then he remembered. Last Christmas, at the church\u2019s carol service, Funke\u2019s cousin had filmed his solo of \u2018O Holy Night\u2019 on her phone. He had been embarrassed, but she had sent it to him. He scrolled back through months of messages, past pictures of Amara, past shopping lists and funny videos. He found it.\n\nThe quality was poor, the sound tinny, filled with the coughs and shuffles of the congregation. But his voice, when it came, cut through the noise. It soared, filling the church, filled with a yearning and a reverence that even the tiny phone speaker could not entirely diminish. It was honest. It was him.\n\nHe attached the file. The upload bar crawled across the screen, impossibly slow. The single bar of Wi-Fi flickered, threatening to vanish. He held his breath, pressing the phone harder against the wall as if he could physically push the data through the air. The generator from the next compound over rumbled, and a dog barked somewhere in the darkness. He felt a profound and sudden loneliness, a man in a concrete box, trying to send his voice out into a world that had never asked to hear it.\n\nThe bar reached the end. \u2018Upload Complete\u2019.\n\nA new button appeared. \u2018Submit Application\u2019. His thumb trembled. He thought of Funke\u2019s tired eyes, of Amara\u2019s soft cheek, of Mrs Ede\u2019s sneer, of Tunde\u2019s easy encouragement. He thought of the smell of polish, and the ache in his back, and the unspent gold in his throat. He closed his eyes and pressed down. The screen refreshed. \u2018Thank you. Your application for Naija Star Voice has been received.\u2019\n\nHe switched off the phone and slid down the wall to the floor. In the silence of the room, he could hear two heartbeats. His own, loud and frantic. And from the cot, the slow, steady, peaceful rhythm of his daughter\u2019s sleep."

At work, every drone of the buffer, every imperious summons from a resident, felt heavier. The scent of polish was no longer a perfume, but a shroud. He found himself checking his phone constantly, polishing the cracked screen with his thumb as if to clear a path for the message he yearned for. He would stand in the corner of his room late at night, a silent sentinel waiting for a single bar of Wi-Fi, only to be met with a screen full of old messages and the crushing emptiness of his inbox. He began to feel foolish. It was a lottery ticket, bought with a stolen scrap of hope. What were the chances?\n\nFunke noticed his distraction. She saw the way his eyes glazed over while he was bouncing Amara on his knee, the way he\u2019d startle when she spoke to him. She saw the new, obsessive ritual with the phone. She said nothing, but her silence was a question mark he could not answer. Her pragmatism had become a kind of fortress, and he had laid siege to it without her knowledge. The guilt was a constant, low hum, another bassline to the anxious melody in his head. He tried to compensate, working harder around their small flat, helping her more with customers, whispering compliments about her cooking. They were small offerings, apologies for a betrayal she did not even know had happened.\n\nOne sweltering afternoon, he was tasked with clearing a blockage in the drainage pipe behind the staff kitchen. The smell was foul, a thick, greasy stench of rot and old food that clung to the humid air. He worked with a plumber\u2019s snake, his shirt soaked with sweat, his knuckles scraped and raw. It was the kind of job that made him feel small and unseen, a cog in the great machine of The Palms, tasked with handling its filth. He took a break, leaning against the hot wall and pulling out his phone. He didn\u2019t expect anything. It was just a habit now, a nervous tic. He held it up high. One bar flickered into existence. And then the phone vibrated, a sharp, electric jolt against his palm.\n\nIt was an email. The sender was \u2018Naija Star Voice Auditions\u2019. His breath caught in his throat. His hands, slick with sweat and grime, trembled as he tapped the screen. The subject line read: \u2018Invitation to Preliminary Auditions\u2019. He read the first line, then read it again. \u2018Dear Adebayo Okoro, Thank you for your application. We were impressed by your submission and would like to invite you to a live audition\u2026\u2019 The words swam before his eyes. The email detailed a time and a location: a conference hall in Surulere, the following Saturday. For a moment, the stench of the drain vanished, replaced by the imaginary scent of stage lights and new clothes. He was no longer a man standing in an alley knee-deep in refuse. He was a man with an invitation. He was a man with a chance.\n\nThat evening, he could not eat. The ball of yams Funke served him sat untouched on his plate. He watched her feed Amara, mashing the soft food with a fork, her movements full of a gentle, focused love that made his secret feel like a shard of glass in his heart. The television was off. The generator was quiet. The only sounds were Amara\u2019s soft gurgles and the distant traffic on the main road. He knew he could not carry the secret any longer. It was too heavy, and too bright, to keep to himself.\n\n\u201cFunke,\u201d he began, his voice barely a whisper. She looked up, her brow furrowed with concern. He slid his cracked phone across the table. \u201cI did something.\u201d\n\nShe picked it up, her expression wary. She read the email, her eyes scanning the text once, then twice. The silence in the room stretched and tightened until Adebayo felt it might snap. When she finally looked at him, her face was unreadable, a calm sea before a storm. She placed the phone down on the table with deliberate care. \u201cSurulere,\u201d she said, her voice flat. \u201cThat is three bus changes. The transport fare alone will be half of what I made this week.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d he said, his own voice pleading. \u201cBut Funke, they chose me. They listened to the video from the church. They heard my voice and they chose me.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey chose hundreds of people, Adebayo,\u201d she countered, her pragmatism flaring like a shield. \u201cThis is how this thing works. They call everyone to a big hall, they make you wait all day in the sun, and then a junior person listens to you for thirty seconds and tells you to go home. It is a business. They are selling hope, and you are buying.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is more than hope! It is a chance!\u201d He leaned forward, his hands gripping the edge of the table. \u201cMy voice\u2026 Funke, you know my voice. It is a gift from God. What is the point of a gift if I just use it to chase echoes in an empty lobby? What if this is the door He is opening? For us. For Amara.\u201d He gestured to their daughter, now dozing in Funke\u2019s arms. \u201cI cannot spend my whole life smelling of polish and fixing rich people\u2019s toilets and tell her that I was too scared to even try.\u201d\n\nThe passion in his voice filled the small room, raw and undeniable. He saw a flicker of something in her eyes \u2013 not anger, but a deep and profound weariness. She looked from his desperate face to Amara\u2019s sleeping one. She looked around the cramped room, at the water stain on the ceiling and the single pot on the stove. This was her reality, the one she fought to hold together every single day. His dream was a wild bird that threatened to knock it all over.\n\nAfter a long moment, she let out a slow breath, the sound of a painful surrender. She reached down beside the mat where she worked and retrieved a small, knotted piece of fabric. Her \u2018emergency\u2019 savings. She began to untie the knot with her teeth, her gaze fixed on him. \u201cThe transport fare,\u201d she said, her voice low and heavy with the weight of the sacrifice. \u201cAnd enough for you to buy a bottle of water and one meat pie. Not two. One.\u201d She pulled out a few rumpled Naira notes and pushed them across the table. They lay there, a tiny, precious pile. \u201cBut you must understand this, my husband. If you go, you cannot come home and tell me about the long queue or the hot sun. You cannot come home with just a story. You go there, and you make them listen.\u201d"

                                        "text": "The morning of the audition, the air in their small room was thick with unspoken words. Adebayo woke before the first hint of dawn, his heart a frantic drum against his ribs. He slid from the mat, careful not to wake Funke, but her eyes opened in the gloom. She was already awake, and had been for some time. She said nothing, but rose and went to a small trunk in the corner. From it, she pulled his best shirt, a white button-down, now slightly greyed with age but impeccably clean and pressed. The sharp creases from the iron were lines of her reluctant blessing. She had also polished his only pair of good shoes, the leather worn but now gleaming with a dull shine. The gesture was more eloquent than any speech. It said, *I do not believe in this fairytale, but I will not have you looking like a fool while you chase it.*\n\nHe dressed in silence, the starched cotton of the shirt a strange armour against his skin. Before he left, he leaned over Amara\u2019s cot. Her breath was a faint, sweet whisper in the stillness. He laid his large, calloused hand on her back, feeling the delicate flutter of her tiny lungs. This was the reason. This small, sleeping soul was the entire purpose. He could not fail her by not trying. When he turned to the door, Funke was there, holding out a small nylon sack containing his polished shoes and the bottle of water. Their eyes met. \u201cDon\u2019t let the sun cook your brain,\u201d she said, her voice soft. It was the closest she could come to saying \u2018good luck\u2019. He nodded, took the bag, and slipped out into the pre-dawn darkness, the crumpled Naira notes a hot, secret weight in his pocket.\n\nThe journey to Surulere was a descent into the city\u2019s roaring, waking heart. The first danfo bus was a metal box of stale air and crushed bodies, the conductor hanging from the open door, shouting destinations into the din of horns and market traders. Adebayo stood, crammed between a woman with a basket of live chickens and a young man with headphones blasting tinny music. The smells of exhaust, dust, and sweat were a world away from the sterile lemon polish of The Palms. He kept his head down, his lips moving silently, rehearsing the verses of the gospel tune his mother used to sing. It was a song about moving mountains, and right now, the city itself felt like a mountain range he had to cross. Each bus change was a new level of chaos, a new test of his resolve, pushing him further from the quiet predictability of his life.\n\nBy the time he arrived at the conference hall, the sun was a hot weight in the sky and the street was a river of people. It was exactly as Funke had described, but a thousand times more overwhelming. There were thousands of them, a vibrant, noisy, desperate sea of hopefuls. They spilled from the gates, lining the walls, sitting on curbs, each one clutching a piece of paper and a dream. He saw young girls in shimmering, tight dresses, men with sculpted beards and designer sunglasses, people with guitars strapped to their backs, entire families who had come to support their one shining star. The air thrummed with a nervous, competitive energy. It was a marketplace of voices, everyone trying to sell themselves. Adebayo, in his simple white shirt, holding his nylon sack, felt his carefully constructed courage begin to fray. He was a caretaker. A cleaner of floors. What was he doing here among these peacocks?\n\nHe found the end of a queue that snaked around the block, and after an hour of shuffling forward, a harried-looking official thrust a piece of paper with the number \u2018743\u2019 scrawled on it into his hand. Seven hundred and forty-three. He was just a number. He found a sliver of shade against a wall and sat down for the long wait. The sun climbed higher, beating down on the pavement. He watched as the day wore on, as the initial excitement of the crowd soured into tired frustration. He saw people practicing, their voices straining against the noise of the city. He saw others arguing, their nerves shot. He saw a young woman burst into tears after emerging from the hall, her brief, thirty-second chance already over. He clutched his number, the paper growing damp in his sweaty palm.\n\nTo pass the time, and to silence the growing voice of doubt in his head, he bought his single meat pie and ate it slowly, piece by tiny piece, making it last. He drank his water in small, careful sips. He was not here as a dreamer, he told himself. He was here as a worker. Funke\u2019s investment was in his pocket, and this waiting, this heat, this crushing anonymity, was the labour. His job was to endure. He closed his eyes, shutting out the sea of faces. He tuned out the cacophony of competing melodies. He went to that quiet place inside himself, the high-ceilinged lobby of his memory, and let his own song rise, silently, in his chest. He wasn't Adebayo Okoro, number 743. He was a man with a voice full of unspent gold, and he had come to make them listen."

                                        "text": "Hours bled into one another under the oppressive sun. Adebayo\u2019s white shirt was now mapped with sweat stains, and his initial resolve had been baked into a dull, throbbing patience. He watched numbers being called in blocks, the hopefuls surging forward like a tide, only to ebb back out minutes later, most with their shoulders slumped and their dreams extinguished. The sun began its slow descent, painting the dusty sky in hues of orange and purple, and a cold knot of dread formed in his stomach. He had waited all day. Had they forgotten his batch? Had his number been a mistake? Funke\u2019s words about coming home with just a story echoed in his mind, sharp and painful. He was just about to accept defeat, to gather his things for the long, shaming journey home, when a voice, strained through a cheap megaphone, crackled through the weary crowd.\n\n\u201cNumbers 740 through 760! To Gate C! Final call, Gate C!\u201d\n\nA jolt went through Adebayo, sharp as an electric shock. He scrambled to his feet, his joints protesting. 743. He was 743. He joined the last, ragged group of hopefuls, a collection of the day\u2019s most resilient or most desperate, and was herded through a side door into the blessed cool of an air-conditioned hallway. The sudden change in temperature was dizzying. After the vibrant chaos outside, the inside was sterile and silent. They were lined up against a wall, a row of wilted flowers waiting for inspection. One by one, they were called into a plain, unmarked door at the end of the corridor.\n\nWhen the door opened and a dejected-looking boy with a guitar slouched out, a woman with a clipboard called, \u201cNumber 743.\u201d Adebayo\u2019s heart leaped into his throat. He smoothed his damp shirt, took a deep breath that did nothing to calm him, and walked into the room. It was small and stark, dominated by a long table behind which sat three people. They were not the gods from the television. They were their weary, mortal underlings. One was a young woman who looked bored, her chin propped on her hand as she scrolled through her phone. In the middle sat a man with glasses and a serious, pinched expression, a pen poised over a notepad. The third was a sharp-featured woman in a colourful blazer, her eyes sweeping over Adebayo with an air of instant dismissal, cataloguing his worn shoes, his simple shirt, his age. She was the one looking for a product to sell.\n\n\u201cName?\u201d the man in the middle asked, not looking up.\n\n\u201cAdebayo Okoro.\u201d\n\n\u201cOccupation?\u201d\n\nAdebayo hesitated for only a fraction of a second. He would not lie. \u201cCaretaker,\u201d he said, his voice quiet but firm. The woman in the blazer raised a perfectly sculpted eyebrow. The bored girl didn't look up from her phone.\n\n\u201cOkay, Caretaker Adebayo,\u201d the man said, a hint of tired irony in his tone. \u201cWhat will you be singing for us today?\u201d\n\n\u201cA gospel song,\u201d Adebayo said. \u201c\u2018The Mountain of Faith\u2019.\u201d\n\nThe woman in the blazer sighed audibly. \u201cAnother one. Original?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, ma. It is an old song. My mother\u2019s song.\u201d\n\n\u201cThirty seconds. Go,\u201d the man said, clicking his pen.\n\nAdebayo planted his worn shoes on the floor, feeling the solid ground beneath him. He closed his eyes, shutting out their tired faces, the sterile room, the crushing weight of their judgment. He was not in Surulere. He was back in the echoing lobby of The Palms, his voice chasing the drone of the buffer. He was a small boy in a quiet village, his mother\u2019s fingers braiding his hair as she sang of faith. He drew a breath, not of air, but of memory and hope, and opened his mouth.\n\nThe first note was low and smooth, thick like palm wine, emerging not from his throat but from the very centre of his chest. It didn\u2019t just enter the room; it filled it, pushing into the corners, warming the cold air, silencing the tap-tap-tap of the bored girl\u2019s finger on her phone screen. He sang of mountains and mustard seeds, of weary hands and unwavering belief. His voice, unadorned by any instrument, was an orchestra in itself. It carried the texture of harmattan dust, the warmth of a cooking fire, the profound, resonant ache of a life lived with more hardship than hope. It was a voice that knew labour and loss, but soared with a spirit that refused to be broken.\n\nHe saw the bored girl\u2019s phone slip from her hand, landing on the table with a soft clatter. He saw the man in the middle put his pen down, his glasses sliding to the tip of his nose, his mouth slightly agape. He saw the woman in the blazer lean forward, her mask of commercial assessment cracking, replaced by an expression of pure, unadulterated shock. He sang past the thirty-second mark, past the one-minute mark. No one stopped him. He poured all the unspent gold of his life into that small room\u2014the love for Funke, the fierce adoration for Amara, the years of quiet humiliation, the stubborn, secret pride in his gift. He finished the song, his last note hanging in the air, pure and clear as a drop of water, just as it had in the lobby.\n\nIn the sudden, deafening silence that followed, the three judges simply stared at him. The man in the middle was the first to speak, his voice a stunned croak. \u201cWhere did you learn to sing like that?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe church choir, sir. And my mother,\u201d Adebayo answered, his heart still hammering.\n\n\u201cAdebayo Okoro,\u201d the woman in the blazer said, her sharp tone now softened with disbelief. She picked up a sheet of paper from a pile. \u201cYou\u2019re the caretaker from The Palms Residence who sent in the \u2018O Holy Night\u2019 video.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a question. She remembered.\n\nHe just nodded, unable to speak.\n\nThe man in the middle looked at his colleagues. \u201cThat\u2026 that was not what I was expecting.\u201d He turned back to Adebayo, his eyes serious and intent. \u201cYour voice has character, Mr. Okoro. It has a story. That is rare.\u201d He scribbled something on a small yellow slip of paper and pushed it across the table. It slid to a stop just in front of Adebayo. \u201cDon\u2019t be late. And don\u2019t wear that shirt.\u201d\n\nAdebayo looked down. On the slip were an address for a studio on Victoria Island, a date for the following week, and the words \u2018CALLBACK \u2013 STAGE 2\u2019. It was real. A tangible piece of paper that held the weight of a possible future. He picked it up, his fingers trembling, and folded it carefully, reverently, before placing it in his pocket next to the now-spent Naira notes from Funke.\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d he whispered, his voice hoarse. \u201cThank you, sir. Thank you, ma.\u201d\n\nHe backed out of the room, nodding his gratitude. As he closed the door behind him, he heard the woman in the blazer say to the others, her voice a mixture of confusion and excitement, \u201cCan you believe that? A caretaker. What on earth are we going to do with him?\u201d Adebayo didn\u2019t wait to hear the answer. He walked down the empty corridor and out into the cool night air, the yellow slip in his pocket feeling warmer and heavier than any gold."

                                        "text": "The journey home was the inverse of the one that morning. The city, which had felt like an adversary, a mountain of concrete and noise designed to crush him, now seemed to pulse with a shared, secret energy. The lights of the danfo buses streaking through the darkness were not just signs of traffic but bursts of confetti. The cacophony of horns and distant music was no longer a din but a city-wide orchestra playing a chaotic, vibrant overture just for him. Adebayo sat with his back pressed against the vibrating metal wall of the bus, his hand in his pocket, his fingers tracing the sharp, folded edges of the yellow slip. He kept pulling it out under the dim interior light, rereading the words\u2014\u2018CALLBACK \u2013 STAGE 2\u2019, \u2018Victoria Island\u2019\u2014as if they might vanish. They were coordinates to a new world, a place he had only ever seen from the outside, a mythical island of glass towers and impossible wealth where men like him only went to serve. Now, he had been invited to perform.\n\nHe walked the final stretch to The Palms through the deep, familiar darkness of his neighbourhood, the generator silence a blanket over the huddled buildings. He could feel the exhaustion deep in his bones, but beneath it, a current of pure adrenaline hummed. He was no longer just tired; he was spent, emptied of all the anxiety and filled with a terrifying, brilliant hope. He knew Funke would be waiting, her silence a heavier judgment than any of the judges could have mustered. He rehearsed his speech, his great victory announcement, but the words felt hollow and boastful. He had no story to tell her, not in words. He only had the proof. When he pushed open their door, the room was lit by a single candle, its flame dancing in the faint breeze from the window. Funke was sitting on the mat, not braiding hair or sleeping, but simply waiting, her back ramrod straight. In the flickering light, her face was a mask of exhausted patience. She didn't ask a question; her eyes asked everything.\n\nHe didn\u2019t speak. He walked past her, placing his nylon sack on the floor and leaning down to check on Amara, his ritual of arrival. The baby was a peaceful lump in the darkness, her scent of powder and milk a grounding anchor. Then he turned back to his wife. He sat down heavily on the floor opposite her, the candle between them. He reached into his pocket and took out the yellow slip, a bright flag of surrender in the dim light. He unfolded it and pushed it across the mat towards her. Her eyes followed the paper, then flickered to his face, searching for the punchline. Seeing none, she picked it up, her calloused fingertips handling it as if it might be coated in poison or pixie dust. She angled it towards the candlelight, her lips moving silently as she read the words. \u2018Victoria Island\u2019. He saw her shoulders, so tense just a moment before, slump with an imperceptible weight. It was not the happy collapse of relief, but the heavy surrender to a new, more complicated reality.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t wear that shirt,\u201d she whispered, her voice rough. She wasn\u2019t looking at him, but at the yellow paper, her mind already racing miles ahead of the moment, calculating costs and impossibilities. \u201cThey told you not to wear your best shirt. So what will you wear, Adebayo? A shirt made of hope?\u201d She looked up at him then, and for the first time, he saw past the fortress of her pragmatism. He saw the flicker of fear, the terror of believing in something that could so easily be snatched away, leaving them with less than they had before. He saw the tiny, almost imperceptible gleam of pride she was trying so desperately to suppress. He reached across the small space between them and covered her hand, the one holding the slip, with his own. \u201cWe will find a way,\u201d he said, and for the first time, it didn\u2019t feel like a hollow promise. It felt like a plan.\n\nThe next day at The Palms was a study in surrealism. The lobby floor was just as vast, the marble just as cold, the scent of lemon polish just as pervasive. But Adebayo felt as though he were moving through it all behind a pane of glass. He was a man with a secret. The imperious commands of the residents, the drone of the buffer, the familiar ache in his back\u2014it all seemed like a role he was playing in a film about his old life. He saw Mrs Ede sailing down the grand staircase, a scowl already forming on her face as she prepared to lodge a complaint, and for the first time, he felt not a flicker of intimidation, only a distant pity. Her world was so loud and yet so small, confined by the walls of this building. His was about to crack wide open. He met her gaze, offered a small, polite nod, and kept polishing, humming his tune a little louder than usual. The sound wasn\u2019t a nervous habit anymore; it was a rehearsal.\n\nLater that afternoon, while he was replacing a faulty light fixture in the B-wing corridor, Tunde jogged past, headphones in place. He skidded to a halt, reversing a few steps to look at Adebayo up on the stepladder. He pulled his headphones down around his neck. \"So? Don't leave me hanging, man! Did you go? How was it?\" Adebayo paused, screwdriver in hand, and a wide, genuine smile broke across his face, the first one he\u2019d allowed himself all day. He felt a rush of gratitude for the young man\u2019s easy, uncomplicated belief in him. \u201cI went,\u201d he said, his voice low, conspiratorial. \u201cThey\u2026 they want to see me again.\u201d Tunde\u2019s eyes went wide. \u201cNo way! A callback? Bro, that\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about! That is sick! Stage two?\u201d Adebayo nodded, and Tunde let out a whoop, slapping the wall in his excitement. \u201cI knew it! My guy! The voice of The Palms! What did they say? What do you need?\u201d\n\nThe genuine joy on Tunde\u2019s face was a balm. Here was someone who saw only the victory, not the problems it created. The judge\u2019s dismissive words came back to him. \u201cThey told me not to wear my shirt,\u201d Adebayo confessed, a little embarrassed. Tunde frowned, looking at Adebayo\u2019s uniform. \u201cYour work shirt? Nah, you can\u2019t wear that. And your Sunday best is a bit\u2026 formal. You need to look like an artist, man. Cool, but humble. Like, effortlessly cool.\u201d Tunde tapped his chin, his mind already working. \u201cOkay, look. This is a problem we can solve. My wardrobe is your wardrobe. We are not the same size, not even close,\u201d he said, grinning at Adebayo\u2019s broad shoulders, \u201cbut my cousin, Dele, he\u2019s a big guy. Plays rugby. And he thinks he\u2019s a fashion icon. Let me make a call. We\u2019re going to get you a shirt, Adebayo. We are going to get you a killer shirt.\u201d"

                                        "text": "The next evening, after his shift, Tunde intercepted him by the service entrance. \"Operation Killer Shirt is a go,\" he whispered, a conspiratorial grin splitting his face. He led Adebayo not to his own apartment, but up in the silent, carpeted lift to the penthouse suite, a realm Adebayo had only ever glimpsed when called to fix a leak. The door opened onto a space so vast and white it felt like stepping into a cloud. Floor-to-ceiling windows revealed the whole of Lagos glittering below, a carpet of jewels laid at their feet. Tunde\u2019s cousin, Dele, a mountain of a man with a surprisingly gentle smile, was waiting. Laid out on a sprawling white leather sofa were several shirts that cost more than Adebayo\u2019s monthly salary. They were made of linen and soft, brushed cotton in muted, earthy tones. Tunde held one up, a dark olive green shirt made of a fabric that seemed to drink the light. \u201cThis is the one,\u201d he declared. \u201cIt says \u2018I have soul, but I\u2019m not trying too hard.\u2019\u201d Adebayo touched the fabric, his calloused fingers snagging slightly on the perfect weave. It felt impossibly soft. He felt a deep, squirming discomfort, the familiar unease of a man who polishes floors being dressed up by the men who walk on them. \u201cI cannot accept this,\u201d he mumbled, his eyes on the floor. Dele clapped a heavy hand on his shoulder. \u201cNonsense, man. It\u2019s just a shirt. A voice like yours deserves a good shirt. Go on, try it. We\u2019re brothers in this now.\u201d\n\nHe carried the shirt home folded carefully in a glossy shopping bag, the crisp paper a foreign object in his world of nylon sacks and reused containers. He presented it to Funke with a nervous pride, pulling it from its tissue-paper nest like a magician revealing a dove. She felt the fabric, her fingers, so attuned to texture, immediately recognizing its quality. Her face, which had been cautiously hopeful, hardened. \u201cWhere did you get this?\u201d she asked, her voice dangerously quiet. \u201cIt was a gift. From Mr. Tunde and his cousin.\u201d He tried to sound casual, but the words came out sounding defensive. Funke dropped the shirt onto the mat as if it were burning her. \u201cA gift,\u201d she repeated, the word tasting like ash in her mouth. \u201cSo now you are their project? Their little charity case? The singing caretaker they can dress up and show off? Adebayo, do you not see? This is just another chain, a softer one, but a chain all the same. They own the building you clean, they own the flat you sleep in, and now they want to own your voice too?\u201d Her words were sharp, each one a perfectly aimed dart hitting the exact centre of his own buried fears. \u201cIt is not like that, Funke!\u201d he protested, his voice rising. \u201cHe is helping me. He believes in me.\u201d \u201cHe believes in a good story!\u201d she shot back, her eyes flashing. \u201cAnd when the story is over? When they are bored? They will take back their shirt and you will be left with nothing but the smell of polish. We have Amara. We have our dignity. Do not trade it for a borrowed shirt.\u201d\n\nThe argument left a ringing silence in the small room that lasted for days. The olive-green shirt hung from a nail on the wall, a silent, beautiful accusation. It represented everything that was pulling them apart: his soaring, reckless hope and her fierce, grounded fear. Adebayo found himself caught in the crossfire of his own heart. When he was at work, buffing the floors, Tunde\u2019s confident optimism felt real and attainable. But when he was home, in the small space held together by Funke\u2019s tireless labour, her warnings felt like prophecy. He would watch her braiding hair, her face a mask of concentration, and feel a pang of guilt so sharp it stole his breath. He was gambling with her peace, with their fragile stability. Then he would look at Amara, sleeping in her cot, and the fear would be replaced by a different, more powerful urgency. He had to do this *for* her, to give her a world larger than this one-room life, a world without the constant, rumbling drone of a generator. The night before the callback, he lay awake on the mat, staring at the silhouette of the shirt against the wall. It was a flag from a foreign country, and he was about to sail into its waters, leaving the only shore he had ever known behind.\n\nVictoria Island was another planet. The air itself seemed different, thinner, cleaner, smelling of money and sea salt instead of dust and exhaust. The studio was an imposing structure of dark glass and brushed steel, a place so intimidatingly modern that Adebayo almost turned around. He clutched the address on the yellow slip, his only proof that he belonged here. Inside, the cool air hummed with a low, professional buzz. The other contestants waiting in the sleek lobby were nothing like the desperate crowd in Surulere. They were a handful of exquisitely beautiful, unnervingly confident people who looked like they had been born for a stage. They chatted easily with each other, name-dropping producers and vocal coaches. Adebayo sat alone in a leather chair that was too soft, the borrowed shirt feeling both too tight around his shoulders and too loose around his spirit. He was acutely aware of his worn shoes, of his calloused hands, of the faint, imaginary scent of lemon polish that he was sure clung to him like a second skin. He was an impostor, and he knew it was only a matter of time before everyone else did too.\n\n\u201cAdebayo Okoro!\u201d The voice belonged to a brisk young woman with a headset. It was his turn. He followed her down a corridor and through a heavy door that opened onto a vast, dark space. He was on a stage. It wasn\u2019t a room; it was a proper stage, a circle of blinding white light surrounded by an intimidating darkness. He could just make out the long table from the television adverts, and behind it, the silhouettes of the three celebrity judges. He recognised the sharp, elegant profile of Zara Kalu, the legendary producer; the relaxed, cool posture of Femi \u2018Rhymz\u2019 Adeoye, the country\u2019s biggest Afrobeats star; and the severe, upright figure of Chief Obinna, the notoriously blunt owner of the record label sponsoring the show. The handsome host stepped into the light, his white teeth gleaming. \u201cAnd here we have Adebayo Okoro!\u201d the host announced to the empty, cavernous space. \u201cHe keeps the floors shining at The Palms Residence, but today he wants to see if he can shine on our stage! A big hand for our singing caretaker!\u201d The patronizing introduction landed like a blow, but Adebayo barely registered it. His eyes were fixed on the judges, on those three fates who held his future in their hands.\n\n\u201cMr. Okoro,\u201d Chief Obinna\u2019s voice boomed through the speakers, deep and devoid of warmth. \u201cThe preliminary judges seemed to think you were special. I am rarely impressed. Do not waste my time. Sing.\u201d The command was a bucket of ice water. For a terrifying second, Adebayo\u2019s mind went blank. The song he had prepared vanished. His throat closed up. He could feel the borrowed shirt sticking to his back, the weight of Funke\u2019s fears, Tunde\u2019s expectations, and his own desperate yearning pressing down on his chest. He was going to fail. The silence stretched. Zara Kalu leaned forward, a flicker of impatience in her eyes. He was losing them. He closed his eyes, and in the blinding whiteness behind his eyelids, he saw a single, clear image: Amara\u2019s face, smooshed against her mattress in serene sleep. A breath entered his lungs. He would not sing for the judges. He would sing for her. He opened his mouth and what came out was a lullaby, a simple Yoruba folk song his grandmother used to sing, one he now sang to Amara.\n\nIt wasn't a song of power or glory. It was a melody of profound, heartbreaking tenderness. His voice, stripped of all artifice, became a vessel for pure, unvarnished love. It was the sound of a father\u2019s devotion, a promise whispered in the dark. It spoke of protection, of safety, of a world made gentle for a beloved child. The voice that had filled a church and silenced a waiting room now created an incredible intimacy in the vast, empty studio. It drew the darkness in, transforming the intimidating stage into a sacred space, a father\u2019s quiet bedside. He poured every drop of his love for his daughter, his guilt and hope for Funke, his entire being into the simple, ancient melody.\n\nHe finished the song on a note so soft it was almost a sigh, a perfect, gentle fade into silence. He opened his eyes, blinking against the lights, his heart pounding. The studio was utterly still. He could see the judges\u2019 faces more clearly now. Femi Rhymz was leaning back, his head tilted, a look of quiet wonder on his face. Zara Kalu was staring at him, her famously critical mask completely gone, replaced by something soft and deeply moved. It was Chief Obinna who leaned forward, his elbows on the table, his fingertips steepled in front of him. He stared at Adebayo for a long, unreadable moment, the silence stretching until it was almost unbearable. Finally, he reached for his microphone, the click echoing through the studio. \u201cMr. Okoro,\u201d he began, his voice a low, serious rumble. \u201cI have one question for you.\u201d"

                                        "text": "Adebayo\u2019s mind, which had been soaring in the quiet, sacred space of his lullaby, came crashing back to earth. The question was not about his voice, his pitch, or his performance. It was a question about his life, a direct echo of Funke\u2019s most profound fears, now spoken in a deep, booming voice from the darkness. He felt the soft linen of the borrowed shirt, suddenly heavy and foreign against his skin. This man was not asking about a song; he was asking for a soul.\n\nHe took a breath, the harsh stage lights hot on his face. He had no prepared answer, no slick retort polished by a media coach. He only had the truth, a thing as plain and worn as his own hands. \u201cNo, sir,\u201d he said, his voice quiet but steady, the honesty of the admission silencing the vast room. \u201cI have no idea. I have never been in this industry. I only know the industry of polish and leaking pipes. I know what it is to work for sixteen hours and have barely enough to buy medicine for my child. I know the demand of a boss who thinks my voice is the wailing of a sick goat. I know the shame of not having enough.\u201d He looked past the blinding lights, trying to find the Chief\u2019s eyes in the gloom. \u201cYou ask me what this industry will demand, and I tell you, I do not know. But I cannot imagine it will demand more than my current life already takes. If sacrifice is the price, then my whole life has been a down payment.\u201d\n\nA profound silence followed his words. In that quiet, Femi Rhymz slowly began to clap. It wasn\u2019t a loud, performative applause, but a soft, rhythmic beat of respect. Zara Kalu, who had built a career on spotting commercial appeal, looked at Chief Obinna, her expression a complex mixture of commercial calculation and genuine awe. This was more than a voice. This was a narrative. This was a man an entire nation could root for. The Chief, however, remained unmoved, his face a mask of stone. He let the silence stretch, a tool he often used to break lesser men. Adebayo stood his ground, his heart hammering but his gaze unwavering.\n\nFinally, Chief Obinna leaned into his microphone again, his voice a low rumble that seemed to shake the very floor of the stage. \u201cThis industry chews up young boys who want fame and spits them out as forgotten men. It has less experience with men who have something to fight for.\u201d He paused, his dark eyes boring into Adebayo. \u201cWe will see which one you are.\u201d He made a small, almost imperceptible gesture to the host. The host, his professional smile back in place, stepped forward. \u201cChief Obinna, the deciding vote\u2026?\u201d The Chief cut him off with a sharp look. \u201cHe is through,\u201d he said, the words falling like stones into a deep well. \u201cMove on.\u201d\n\nThe walk off the stage was a blur. The bright lights gave way to the dim backstage corridor, and the tension in Adebayo\u2019s shoulders unwound so suddenly he felt dizzy. The brisk woman with the headset met him, her expression now holding a flicker of respect. She handed him a laminated card on a lanyard and a thick folder. \u201cWelcome to the Top 20,\u201d she said, her tone all business. \u201cRehearsal schedule, contracts, and media guidelines are in the folder. Your life is no longer your own. Read it. All of it. Be at the studio tomorrow, 8 a.m. sharp.\u201d He took the folder, its weight a shock in his hands. He looked at the lanyard. It had his picture, a grainy shot from his application, with his name underneath: Adebayo Okoro. Vocalist.\n\nHe found himself back in the sleek lobby, the other contestants now looking at him differently. He saw envy, curiosity, and in some eyes, a clear dismissal, as if his success was a fluke, a gimmick that would soon wear off. Tunde\u2019s words came back to him: *\u2018The voice of The Palms!\u2019* The host\u2019s words echoed louder: *\u2018Our singing caretaker!\u2019* He knew which label would stick. He was a story, a novelty. He clutched the folder to his chest and walked out of the glass building, back onto the planet of his real life, the cool evening air doing nothing to calm the firestorm in his mind. He made his way to the bus stop, a man caught between two worlds, belonging fully to neither. He pulled out his phone and sent a simple text to Tunde: *\u2018I am in.\u2019* He couldn\u2019t bring himself to call Funke. This news was too big, too terrifying, to be delivered through a wire. It had to be given face to face, a fragile offering laid at her feet.\n\nWhen he arrived home, the generator was running, its familiar drone a comforting, mundane sound. The single lightbulb was on, casting a harsh, yellow glare over their room. Funke was on the mat, mending one of Amara\u2019s tiny dresses, her needle moving with a quick, rhythmic precision. She looked up as he entered, her eyes immediately scanning his face, then dropping to the thick folder in his hands. She didn\u2019t have to ask. The answer was right there, a heavy, glossy testament to his success. He sat down opposite her, the exhaustion of the day settling into his bones like a deep chill. He placed the folder on the mat between them. It lay there like a border wall.\n\n\u201cThey put me through,\u201d he said, his voice flat with fatigue. \u201cTo the live shows. The Top 20.\u201d He watched her face, searching for a sign, any sign. She put the mending aside, her hands smoothing the fabric of her own worn wrapper. She looked at the folder, at the sleek logo of \u2018Naija Star Voice\u2019, an invader in their simple room. She looked at the olive-green shirt he was still wearing, a costume for a life he hadn't yet earned.\n\n\u201cSo,\u201d she said, her voice impossibly calm, betraying none of the storm he knew must be raging inside her. \u201cThey have you now.\u201d He flinched. It was the exact fear she had expressed, now stated as fact. \u201cThey have our story. They will put us on television for everyone to see. Our room. Our daughter. Our life. They will package it and sell it.\u201d She finally raised her eyes to meet his, and he saw no anger, only a profound, heartbreaking clarity. \u201cYou sang for them, Adebayo. Now you will dance for them too.\u201d She reached out and touched the folder, not with fear, but with a grim resignation. \u201cSo show me. Show me the contract for your soul.\u201d"

The thick folder lay between them, its pristine white pages a stark contrast to their surroundings. Funke, with the ferocious focus she usually reserved for a complicated braid pattern, began to read. Adebayo watched her, unable to decipher the dense blocks of text himself, the legal language a thick jungle he could not navigate. He could only read her face. He saw her brow furrow at a clause about exclusivity, her lips thin into a grim line as she read the section on revenue sharing. The numbers were staggering. The label would take a percentage of everything: not just music sales, but touring, merchandise, endorsements, even public appearances, for a period of seven years after the competition, win or lose. It was a net cast wide enough to catch not just the fish, but the entire river.\n\n\u201cThis is not a contract, Adebayo,\u201d she finally said, her voice low and heavy in the stillness of the room. She tapped a page with her finger. \u201cThis is an indenture. They will give you a stipend, yes. Enough to make you feel rich for a month. They will put you in a house with the others. But you will own nothing. Your voice, the songs you sing, the clothes you wear, the places you go\u2026 they will own it all. It says here,\u201d she pointed again, \u201cthat they have the right to \u2018shape and exploit the artist\u2019s life story for promotional purposes\u2019. Exploit, Adebayo. They are not hiding what they will do. They are telling you to your face.\u201d He saw the small, precious dream of a garden and a proper salon for her shrivel under the harsh light of her words. He had seen the callback as a door opening; she saw it as a cage closing, its lock clicking shut.\n\n\u201cBut what choice do we have, Funke?\u201d he pleaded, the exhaustion and the hope warring within him. \u201cTo stay here forever? To let Amara grow up in this one room, listening to the generator and the arguments from next door? This is a chance to escape. A hard chance, yes, a bad bargain, but it is the only one we have been offered.\u201d He reached for the folder, his hand resting on top of it. \u201cWe have been exploited our whole lives for a few Naira. At least with this, the promise is bigger.\u201d Funke looked at him, her eyes full of a deep, weary sorrow. She did not see a brave man seizing an opportunity. She saw her husband, a good and simple man, walking into a lion\u2019s den because he had been promised a feast. She picked up the pen they used for her customer records and, with a hand that did not tremble, signed her name in the space marked \u2018Spouse/Next of Kin\u2019. Her signature was a neat, precise, and utterly joyless surrender.\n\nThe next morning, at an hour when he would normally be dragging the heavy buffer across the lobby floor, Adebayo stood with a small, worn bag at the gates of The Palms. A sleek black car, its windows tinted to an opaque darkness, was waiting for him. Tunde was there to see him off, bouncing on the balls of his feet with an infectious excitement that Adebayo could not quite feel. \u201cMy guy! You\u2019re off! To the big leagues!\u201d Tunde clapped him on the back. \u201cRemember us little people when you\u2019re a superstar!\u201d Adebayo managed a weak smile, his mind elsewhere. He had said goodbye to Funke in their room, a stilted, awkward affair full of things left unsaid. He had kissed Amara\u2019s sleeping head, the familiar scent of baby powder a painful reminder of the world he was leaving behind. Getting into the air-conditioned luxury of the car felt less like an ascent and more like an abduction. As the car pulled away, he looked back and saw Mrs Ede standing on the grand steps of the residence, her arms crossed, watching his departure with an expression he couldn't quite decipher. It wasn't irritation. It was something closer to\u2026 thwarted ownership.\n\nThe artist compound was a large, modern duplex on a quiet, tree-lined street in Ikeja, surrounded by high walls topped with security wire. It was another world, but a far cry from the sleek fantasy of Victoria Island. This was a holding pen, comfortable but sterile. He was shown to a small, neat room he would share with another contestant, a rapper from Jos named MC Slate who regarded Adebayo\u2019s worn bag and simple clothes with a cool, assessing gaze. The house was filled with the twenty chosen ones, a vibrant and intimidating mix of talent and ego. They were all younger than him, their ambitions worn as brightly as their designer clothes. They spoke a different language, a slick patois of industry slang and social media trends, and moved with a restless, competitive energy that made Adebayo feel slow and ancient. He was the caretaker, the old man, the novelty act. He saw it in the way they looked at him, a mixture of pity and condescending curiosity. His story had preceded him. He was not just Adebayo; he was a character.\n\nThe first week was a blur of scheduled disorientation. They were given new phones with their schedules pre-loaded, new wardrobes curated by a team of stylists, and a strict set of rules. No unauthorized contact with the outside world. No social media posts without approval. Every meal was catered, every hour was accounted for. It was a life of manufactured ease designed to keep them focused and controlled. His first session with the head vocal coach, a woman named Diana with a sharp bob and an even sharper tongue, was a lesson in humiliation. He sang his mother's gospel tune, the one that had impressed the first-round judges, pouring his heart into it. Diana stopped him halfway through, a pained expression on her face. \u201cDarling, no,\u201d she said, her voice dripping with condescension. \u201cThat raw, shouty thing might work for a church hall, but it won\u2019t sell records. Your pitch is a gift, but your technique is a disaster. You\u2019re singing from your chest, from your feelings. It\u2019s very\u2026 authentic.\u201d She said the word \u2018authentic\u2019 as if it were a disease. \u201cWe need you to sing from your diaphragm. We need control. We need to polish the diamond, not just admire the rock it\u2019s trapped in.\u201d For the next hour, she had him doing breathing exercises and scales, trying to sand down the very texture he thought was the soul of his voice. He felt foolish, his large frame struggling to follow her precise instructions, while in the next room, a young girl half his age effortlessly ran through a complex Mariah Carey riff.\n\nThe calls home were the hardest part. He would find a quiet corner of the manicured garden, the new, unfamiliar phone feeling slick and foreign in his hand. \u201cHow is Amara?\u201d he would ask, his opening line every time. \u201cShe has a tooth coming in. She is crying all night,\u201d Funke would reply, her voice thin and tired over the line. \u201cThe landlord was asking about the rent for next month.\u201d He would try to tell her about his day, about the stylists and the vocal coaches, but the words felt absurd and hollow. How could he speak of choosing between three different kinds of designer jeans when she was worried about rent? The chasm between their realities was growing wider with every call. \u201cThey are paying me a stipend,\u201d he said, trying to offer a concrete reassurance. \u201cIt will come soon. I will send it all.\u201d But he could hear the unspoken accusation in her silence. The money came at a cost, and she was the one at home paying the daily interest. He was living in a clean, quiet house with chefs and stylists. She was living in a small, hot room with a teething baby and the ghosts of their broken promises."

                                        "text": "The theme for the first live show was \u2018My Story\u2019. When it was announced, a wave of palpable excitement rippled through the production team, and all eyes turned to Adebayo. He was their golden goose, their lottery ticket. His story was not one of youthful ambition or a comfortable middle-class dream; it was a gritty, aspirational fairytale that wrote its own headlines. The producers assigned him their top field director, a man named Tunde whose slick, easy charm felt like a weapon. He sat Adebayo down and pitched the vision for his pre-performance video package, his hands painting a masterpiece of sentimental poverty in the air. They would show the grand, marble-floored lobby of The Palms, then immediately cut to his own cramped quarters. The contrast would be breathtaking. They would film him with his mop, a silent, noble worker, staring wistfully into the middle distance. It was a caricature, a reduction of his entire existence into a thirty-second sob story, and Adebayo felt a hot, helpless shame creep up his neck.\n\nThe day the film crew came to The Palms was one of the longest of Adebayo\u2019s life. They arrived in a white van, their equipment cases and confident swagger an alien invasion in the familiar service corridors. They followed him as he did his work, the camera\u2019s unblinking eye a constant, silent judgment. The director, Tunde, orchestrated every shot. \u201cAdebayo, my man, just a bit more pathos, okay? Look at the scuff mark on the floor like it represents all the dreams you\u2019ve had to scrub away,\u201d he\u2019d say, and the crew would chuckle. Adebayo obeyed, his movements stiff, his face a stony mask. He felt like a prop in the museum of his own life. The true humiliation, however, came when they arrived at his flat. He had called Funke to warn her, a conversation filled with tense, brittle silences. She was there, with Amara strapped to her back, her face scrubbed of all expression. She had cleaned the room to within an inch of its life, but there was no hiding the peeling paint, the cracked mirror, the inherent smallness of their world.\n\nThe crew squeezed into the tiny space, their presence sucking the very air from the room. The director\u2019s eyes lit up as he saw the cracked mirror. \u201cOh, this is gold. Pure gold,\u201d he murmured to his cameraman. He tried to interview Funke, aiming his charming smile at her like a spotlight. \u201cSo, tell us,\u201d he began, \u201cwhat does it feel like, knowing your husband has this incredible, once-in-a-lifetime chance to lift you both out of\u2026 all this?\u201d Funke looked at him, her gaze so direct and devoid of artifice that he faltered for a second. \u201cIt feels like my house is full of strangers with cameras,\u201d she said, her voice quiet and clear. She answered every question with a blunt, unadorned fact, refusing to give them the tears or the trembling hope they were mining for. She would not perform for them. She would not sell her struggle for their story. Defeated, they turned their attention back to Adebayo, positioning him by the window, asking him to look out at the grey concrete wall of the next building as if he were gazing at a promised land.\n\nThat Saturday night, backstage was a riot of nervous energy, hairspray, and sequins. Adebayo stood in the wings, the borrowed clothes from the show\u2019s stylist feeling like a costume for a stranger. He could hear the roar of the live audience, a sound like the ocean, vast and terrifying. He was due to sing a popular Afrobeats ballad that had been stripped down and rearranged into a soulless, acoustic number. Diana, his vocal coach, fussed around him, patting his chest. \u201cBreathe, Adebayo. Diaphragm. And for heaven\u2019s sake, connect with the camera. Seduce it. Make them fall in love with you,\u201d she hissed, before being shooed away by a stage manager. Then, the lights in the studio dimmed. The host\u2019s voice boomed, and Adebayo\u2019s video package filled the enormous screens. He watched in horror as his life was served up for mass consumption. There he was, a sad-looking man with a mop. There was his home, a portrait of lack. And there was Funke, her face a mask of proud defiance, her refusal to play their game making her look cold and unsupportive. Finally, the camera zoomed in on Amara, sleeping in her cot, a symbol of innocent hope. The audience sighed a collective, pitying \u201cAwwww.\u201d Adebayo felt naked, flayed open, his most private sanctums turned into public spectacle. He was no longer a man; he was a tear-jerker.\n\nHe walked into the circle of light, his heart a cold, heavy stone in his chest. The music started, a soft, generic guitar melody. He began to sing, his voice coming out exactly as Diana had trained it: controlled, on pitch, technically perfect, and utterly dead. He went through the motions of the first verse, his eyes fixed on the red light of the main camera as instructed. He could see the judges\u2019 faces on a monitor. They were nodding politely, their expressions professional and vaguely bored. This was the safe, polished product they were creating. This was the voice of a man who did as he was told. Then, as the song moved to the chorus, he caught his own reflection in the dark screen of a camera. He saw a stranger, a well-dressed puppet whose soul had been sanded down and tucked away. Funke\u2019s words echoed in his head, a burning indictment: *Now you will dance for them too.* A fire ignited in his belly. No. He would not.\n\nIn the space between one beat and the next, he broke away. He abandoned the prescribed melody and the sterile arrangement. He closed his eyes, shutting out the lights, the cameras, the judges, and Diana\u2019s horrified face, which he could sense in the wings. He took the shallow pop lyrics and plunged them into the deep well of his own sound. The thin melody thickened, infused with the harmattan dust and palm wine of his true voice. He sang of love, not as a romantic clich\u00e9, but as a thing of grit and sacrifice. He sang of faith, not as a greeting card sentiment, but as the desperate, calloused-hand grip of a man holding on in the dark. The song transformed. It became a gospel hymn. It became a plea. It became a defiant roar. He was no longer performing for the audience or the judges. He was singing directly to Funke, an apology for the invasion of her privacy, a declaration that they had not taken everything, that this, his voice, was still his own. The final note soared, raw and resonant, a cry of pure, unvarnished soul that hung in the air long after the stunned guitarist had stopped playing.\n\nWhen he opened his eyes, the studio was in an uproar. The polite audience had become a cheering, roaring crowd, on its feet, their applause a physical force that washed over him. He looked at the judges\u2019 table. Femi Rhymz was standing, clapping slowly, a huge grin of pure delight on his face. \u201cNow, *that* is what we call soul!\u201d he yelled over the noise. Zara Kalu was staring, her pen forgotten, her sharp, commercial mind visibly spinning as she processed the raw, marketable power of what she had just witnessed. Only Chief Obinna remained seated, his face an unreadable granite mask. He had disobeyed. He had broken the cardinal rule of the show. He had taken back control. Backstage, he knew Diana would be apoplectic. He knew the producers would be furious. He had gone off-script. But as he stood there, bathed in the thunderous applause, he felt a profound and terrifying sense of release. He had stopped dancing.\n\nLater that night, long after the adrenaline had faded, leaving him hollowed out and trembling, he found a quiet corner and dialled Funke\u2019s number. The phone rang for a long time before she picked up. He braced himself for her anger, for the \u2018I told you so\u2019 that he so richly deserved after their life had been broadcast to millions. \u201cI saw it,\u201d she said, her voice small and distant. He waited. \u201cBaba Risi down the street brought his television outside. The whole neighbourhood was there. Watching.\u201d There was a long pause, filled with the crackle of the phone line and the frantic beating of Adebayo\u2019s heart. \u201cWhen they showed the room,\u201d she continued, \u201cI wanted to die.\u201d He closed his eyes. \u201cFunke, I am so sorry\u2014\u201d \u201cBut then you started to sing,\u201d she cut in, her voice barely a whisper. \u201cAt first, it was just\u2026 noise. Another love song. And then\u2026 it was you. It was your voice. The one from the church.\u201d Another pause. He could hear her take a shaky breath. \u201cThe people here,\u201d she said, her voice thick with a strange wonder, \u201cthey were shouting your name. They were cheering for you, Adebayo.\u201d It was not forgiveness. It was not an absolution. But it was something more precious. It was a recognition. Across the vast, crackling distance, through the television screen and the phone line, she had heard him. Not the caretaker, not the contestant. Him."

                                        "text": "The moment Adebayo stepped off the stage, the thunder of the crowd was replaced by a frigid, menacing silence. Diana was waiting for him in the wings, her face a mask of incandescent rage, her sharp bob vibrating with fury. Her whisper was more terrifying than any shout. \"You are finished,\" she hissed, her eyes like chips of black ice. \"You arrogant, ungrateful man. I told you to connect, not to self-destruct. Chief Obinna will have you thrown out of here so fast your feet won't touch the ground. You have just ended your career before it even began. You are a caretaker, and a caretaker you will remain.\" He didn't answer, his body still humming with the aftershock of the performance, his heart a strange mix of terror and triumph. He had expected this. He had made his choice in that circle of light, and he was ready to accept the consequences. He simply nodded, a quiet acknowledgment of her verdict, and walked past her towards the communal dressing room, preparing himself for the walk of shame out of the building and back to his old life.\n\nHe was pulling the borrowed shirt over his head when the brisk woman with the headset appeared at the door, her expression as unreadable as ever. The other male contestants in the room fell silent, watching the unfolding drama with predatory stillness. \"Adebayo Okoro,\" she said, her voice cutting through the tension. \"Chief Obinna will see you now. In his office.\" A collective, indrawn breath seemed to be taken by everyone in the room. This was it. The final judgment, delivered not by a subordinate, but by the king himself. Adebayo put the shirt back on, his fingers fumbling with the buttons. As he followed the woman down a series of sterile, white corridors he had never seen before, he felt a strange sense of peace settle over him. He had not bowed. He had sung his truth. If this was the end, he would leave with his voice, the one thing that was entirely his own, still intact.\n\nChief Obinna\u2019s office was on the top floor, a vast, dark space paneled in rich mahogany. One wall was a single sheet of glass overlooking the sprawling, glittering lights of Lagos. It was the view of a man who owned the city, not one who cleaned its floors. Zara Kalu and Femi Rhymz were already there, seated in low leather armchairs. Chief Obinna sat behind a desk so large it looked like a landing strip, his fingertips steepled before him. He gestured for Adebayo to stand in the centre of the expensive rug, a specimen under a microscope. He let the silence stretch, a palpable force in the room, before he spoke, his voice a low, dangerous rumble. \"Mr. Okoro. You were given a song, a vocal arrangement, and a set of instructions from my team. You followed none of them. Explain yourself.\" Adebayo\u2019s throat was dry. \"Sir,\" he began, his voice raspy. \"The song they gave me\u2026 it had no heart. It was not my story. I could not sing a lie.\"\n\nFemi Rhymz let out a short, appreciative laugh, which he quickly stifled when the Chief shot him a dark glance. It was Zara Kalu who spoke, her voice smooth and calculated. \"His social media mentions have increased by three thousand percent in the last hour. The hashtag #NaijaHeart is trending. He\u2019s what the people are talking about.\" She wasn't defending Adebayo; she was presenting a stock report. Chief Obinna\u2019s eyes remained fixed on Adebayo, cold and assessing. \"So, you are an artist, Mr. Okoro? You believe your feelings are more important than a multi-million Naira production? You believe your 'heart' is more valuable than my investment?\" Adebayo met his gaze. \"I believe my heart is the only thing I have that is worth investing in, sir.\" The audacity of the statement hung in the air. The Chief stared at him for a long, unnerving moment, and then a slow, chilling smile spread across his face. It did not reach his eyes. \"Excellent,\" he said. \"I agree. From now on, that is your brand. Adebayo Okoro, the Heart of Naija. The man who sings the truth. The voice of the people.\" He leaned forward, his smile vanishing. \"But understand this. I own your truth now. I own your heart. I own the people\u2019s response to it. You thought you were rebelling, but you were merely auditioning for a new role. And you got the part. Congratulations.\" He gestured to the door. \"You are dismissed. Do not disappoint your public.\"\n\nWalking back into the brightly lit compound was like re-entering the atmosphere from outer space. The change in the house was immediate and profound. The whispers that used to follow him were now replaced by a wary silence. He was no longer the pitiable caretaker; he was a contender, a favourite, and a threat. Some contestants approached him with a new, sycophantic deference, offering to get him a drink, complimenting his performance with wide, false eyes. Others, like MC Slate, watched him from a distance, their expressions hardened with a new layer of competitive resentment. Later that evening, the rapper cornered him by the pool, the water casting shifting blue patterns on their faces. \"That was a neat trick on the stage, old man,\" Slate said, his voice a low murmur. \"You made them think it was their idea.\" Adebayo shook his head. \"It was not a trick.\" Slate smirked, a flash of white in the darkness. \"Everything in this place is a trick. You just pulled off a good one. Just be careful. When you're the 'Heart of Naija', there's a long way to fall. And everyone in this house will be waiting to watch.\"\n\nThat night, Adebayo\u2019s call with Funke was different. The static on the line felt less like a chasm and more like a necessary buffer. He told her everything, the words tumbling out of him\u2014Diana\u2019s fury, the terrifying summons, the Chief's chilling pronouncement. He tried to frame it as a victory, a validation of his choice. \"They are letting me be me, Funke! They want my voice, not some copy.\" He waited for her to share in his relief, but her reply was a splash of cold, sobering water. \"So the lion was pleased you roared,\" she said, her voice laced with the hard-edged pragmatism he had missed so dearly. \"He did not set you free, Adebayo. He has simply put you in a bigger cage and painted the bars gold. Now you are not just a singer; you are a symbol. 'The Heart of Naija'. It is a much heavier chain to wear than a number on a piece of paper.\" She was right. The euphoria of his survival began to curdle into a familiar anxiety. He had won, but the price of his victory was that he now had to keep winning, on their terms, under a label he had not chosen.\n\nThe new week began, and the pressure was immense. His every move was watched, his interviews parsed, his image carefully managed by the show\u2019s publicity team. At his next vocal session, Diana was a different person. Her condescension was gone, replaced by a fawning, honey-sweet tone that was somehow more unnerving. \"Adebayo, my star!\" she cooed. \"We must protect that magnificent, raw instrument of yours!\" The theme for the week was 'Legends of Gospel'. It was an obvious move, a strategic corralling of his new brand. Diana presented him with his song, chosen by the Chief himself: 'Amazing Grace'. It was perhaps the most famous hymn in the world, a song so grand and so familiar it was almost a clich\u00e9. The trap was elegant in its simplicity. If he sang it straight, he would be boring, a predictable church singer. If he tried to deconstruct it as he had the pop song, he risked sacrilege, alienating the very audience that now adored him. He stared at the sheet music, at the simple, timeless notes. Last week, he had fought for the right to sing with a soul. This week, he was being commanded to do so, and he had no idea if he could deliver an authentic miracle on demand."

This isn\u2019t just a song; it\u2019s your biography.\u201d The more she tried to orchestrate his emotion, the more it fled from him. The song, once a source of comfort heard in countless church services, became a hollow vessel. He would sing the words, his voice technically flawless, but his own ears heard only a dead echo.\n\nHe became a ghost in the vibrant, noisy house. His newfound status had built an invisible wall around him. The other contestants, who once ignored him, now watched his every move. Bisi, a bubbly eighteen-year-old pop singer with a voice like spun sugar, cornered him one afternoon by the water cooler. \u201cUncle Adebayo,\u201d she said, her eyes wide and earnest, \u201cwhat\u2019s your secret? That thing you did last week\u2026 that pain in your voice. How do you find it?\u201d He stared at her, at her unlined face and her life of privilege that she wore so effortlessly, and he had no answer. How could he explain that the \u2018pain\u2019 she admired was the accumulation of a thousand quiet humiliations, the ache in his back after a sixteen-hour shift, the knot in his stomach when Amara had a fever and the clinic was closed? His life was not a technique to be learned. He was not a secret to be unlocked. He was a man, and he felt he was slowly being disassembled, his parts catalogued and sold for public consumption.\n\nThe chasm between his new reality and the one he had left behind grew deeper with every phone call home. He would stand on the manicured lawn of the compound, the scent of hibiscus and chlorine in the air, and listen to Funke\u2019s dispatches from another universe. Her voice was flat with exhaustion. The roof had developed a new leak right over Amara\u2019s cot. The price of cooking gas had gone up again. He tried to tell her about his own struggles, the suffocating pressure of his new brand, the hollowness he felt trying to sing his assigned song. \u201cI have to sing \u2018Amazing Grace\u2019,\u201d he said, his voice laced with a frustration he couldn't hide, \u201cand I feel like a liar.\u201d There was a long silence on the other end of the line, a silence so heavy he could feel its weight across the miles. \u201cA man in a big house with free food is worried about a song,\u201d Funke said, not unkindly, but with the devastating clarity of her reality. \u201cI am worried our daughter will catch a cold from the damp. We are living in different worlds now, my husband.\u201d The call ended with the usual promises to send money, but the words felt like flimsy paper bridges thrown across an ever-widening canyon.\n\nHis crisis came two nights before the show. He was in his small, sterile room, staring at his reflection in the polished surface of the television screen. He saw a stranger looking back at him. The man in the reflection wore a soft, expensive t-shirt. His face was fuller, his skin clearer. The perpetual tiredness that had settled deep in his bones for years was gone, replaced by a new, sharper anxiety. He looked comfortable. He looked rested. He looked nothing like the man who deserved to sing about being a wretch saved by grace. The entire performance felt like a fraud. He was no longer the man from the lobby. He was Chief Obinna\u2019s polished product, a living, breathing brand. He felt a surge of self-loathing so strong it made him want to smash the screen. He grabbed his phone, his thumb swiping angrily past the endless stream of notifications from strangers who claimed to love him, searching for something real. He found it in his photo gallery. It was a picture Funke had sent him days ago, one he had glanced at and forgotten. Amara, propped up on a pillow, her face a mess of mashed yam, holding a plastic spoon like a scepter. Her smile was pure, uncalculated joy.\n\nHe stared at the image, at the smudge of food on her cheek, at the light in her eyes, and the lyrics of the hymn began to reconfigure themselves in his soul. *Amazing grace, how sweet the sound, that saved a wretch like me.* The grace wasn\u2019t the record deal or the cheering crowd. The grace was this. It was the fierce, stubborn love of a wife who would read a contract in the dark to protect him. It was the impossible, breathtaking miracle of his daughter\u2019s gummy smile. The wretch was not a character to be played for the cameras; it was the man he had been, the man who felt invisible, who hummed his songs into the drone of a buffer because he believed no one else would ever care to listen. *I once was lost, but now am found.* He had been lost in the anonymous grind of his life, and now he was found, exposed to the world in all his flawed humanity. *Was blind, but now I see.* He had been blind to his own worth, and now he saw it, but he also saw the gilded bars of the cage he was in. The song wasn't a simple hymn of praise. It was a complex, painful, and beautiful testimony of his exact position in the universe at that very moment. It was a song of a man who was simultaneously more free and more trapped than he had ever been in his life.\n\nHe didn't need Diana\u2019s coaching or the Chief\u2019s branding. He didn\u2019t need to channel a past struggle; he just needed to inhabit his present truth. The song was no longer about a divine, distant God. It was about the messy, tangible, amazing grace of a life that had brought him here, to this strange, lonely room, staring at a picture of his daughter and preparing to sing for his survival. He picked up the show's acoustic guitar, an instrument he hadn't touched in years, and began to pick out a simple, quiet melody. He would not give them a performance. He would not give them a spectacle. He would give them a confession. He would strip the song down to its bones, to a place so quiet and intimate that it would feel like a prayer whispered in the dark. In the sterile silence of the compound, Adebayo Okoro, the Heart of Naija, finally found his voice again, not in a roar of defiance, but in a whisper of profound and complicated gratitude."

                                        "text": "On the night of the second live show, the backstage area was a whirlwind of frantic energy, a storm of glitter and ambition that Adebayo now navigated with a strange, unnerving calm. He sat on a crate in a dimly lit corner, away from the flurry of makeup artists and panicking contestants, his fingers tracing the worn wood of the acoustic guitar resting on his lap. It was an old instrument from the studio\u2019s storage, dusty and forgotten, but it felt more real in his hands than any of the expensive costumes he had been forced to wear. He had found his anchor.\n\nDiana found him there, her face a carefully constructed mask of supportive encouragement, but her eyes darted nervously to the guitar. \u201cAdebayo, darling,\u201d she began, her voice a tense whisper, \u201cWhat are you doing with that? There\u2019s no guitar in the arrangement. It\u2019s a full orchestra tonight. Grandeur. Power. Remember the brand.\u201d\n\nAdebayo looked up at her, his expression placid. The fear she had once inspired in him was gone, replaced by a quiet, settled resolve. \u201cThe brand is \u2018Heart of Naija\u2019, Diana,\u201d he said, his voice even. \u201cMy heart is not an orchestra. It is this.\u201d He strummed a single, soft chord, the sound small but pure, cutting through the surrounding chaos. Diana\u2019s face tightened. She saw the same stubborn disobedience from the week before, but this time it was not a fiery rebellion; it was something far more formidable: a quiet declaration of independence. She knew there was no point arguing. She gave a curt, angry nod and swept away to complain to the producers, leaving him alone with his decision.\n\nWhen the host, his teeth seeming to glow in the studio lights, announced his name with a booming flourish, the introduction was thick with manufactured sentiment. \u201cAnd now, the man whose story has captured the nation! The voice of the people, the one and only Heart of Naija, Adebayo Okoro!\u201d The roar from the crowd was immense, a wave of expectation. But Adebayo did not walk to the center of the stage. He walked instead to a single wooden stool placed to the side, the guitar in his hand a clear signal that he was once again going off-script. A murmur of confusion rippled through the audience and, he knew, a wave of panic in the control room. He sat down, adjusted the microphone, and ignored the teleprompter, the cameras, and the sea of faces. He took a deep breath, and in the sudden, expectant hush, he looked down at his own hands, the hands that had scrubbed floors and held his daughter, and began to play.\n\nHe did not sing the song as a hymn. He spoke it, almost, the first lines a hushed confession whispered into the microphone. His voice was not the soaring tenor that had filled the church; it was a low, textured baritone, intimate and raw. He sang of grace not as a divine thunderclap, but as the quiet, persistent light of his daughter\u2019s smile in a cracked phone screen. When he sang of being a \u2018wretch\u2019, the word was imbued with the memory of his own invisibility, of smelling of polish and being looked through as if he were part of the furniture. The vast studio, with its thousands of people, seemed to shrink until it was just him, alone in a room, grappling with the terrible and beautiful truth of his life. He built the song slowly, not towards a crescendo of power, but towards a summit of heartbreaking vulnerability. For the final verse, his voice finally rose, not in a shout, but in a flight of pure, unadorned melody that seemed to carry all the love, fear, and gratitude of his fractured world. He held the last note, letting it fade into a whisper, his fingers resting on the silent strings of the guitar.\n\nThe silence that followed was absolute, a sacred, breathless vacuum that lasted for what felt like an eternity. It was not the stunned silence of shock from the week before; it was the profound, reverent silence of a shared moment of truth. Then, a single person began to clap, then another, and then the entire studio erupted, not in a wild roar, but in a deep, sustained ovation that was less an applause and more an answer. He looked up at the judges' table. Femi Rhymz was wiping a tear from his eye, unashamedly. Zara Kalu was staring at her notes, though she hadn't written a single word, her sharp commercial mind grappling with a phenomenon that defied easy marketing. It was Chief Obinna who leaned into his microphone, his voice a low, resonant bass that cut through the applause. He looked directly at Adebayo, his expression unreadable.\n\n\u201cLast week, Mr. Okoro, you showed us your power,\u201d the Chief began, the audience falling silent to hear his verdict. \u201cTonight, you have shown us your soul. There are many singers in this world, but there are very few artists who can hold a room captive with nothing but their own truth.\u201d He paused, letting the weight of his words settle. \u201cYou are no longer a contestant in this competition. You are the standard by which all others will now be judged.\u201d It was the most terrifying coronation Adebayo could have imagined. It was not a release; it was the tightening of a crown.\n\nThe phone call home that night felt different. He dialled her number with a steady hand, the familiar anxiety replaced by a quiet need to connect. Funke answered on the second ring. Before he could even ask about Amara, she spoke, her voice soft and full of a wonder he had not heard in years. \u201cThe whole street was quiet tonight, Adebayo. Baba Risi turned the volume up, but there was no need. Nobody was talking. We were all just\u2026 listening.\u201d He could hear the crackle of the line, but for the first time, it felt like it was carrying them closer, not holding them apart.\n\n\u201cWhat did you think?\u201d he asked, the question holding the entire weight of his performance. He needed her verdict more than he needed the Chief\u2019s. There was a pause, and he heard her let out a long, shaky breath. \"You were not singing to them,\" she said, her voice thick with emotion. \"You were singing to us. You sang about the leak in the roof, and the smell of baby powder, and the fear I feel when I look at the calendar. You sang my worries and you made them sound like a prayer.\" She was crying, he realised, a quiet, gentle weeping that held no anger, only a profound, heartbreaking recognition. \"You brought the song home, Adebayo,\" she whispered. \"In front of all those people, you finally brought it all home to us.\" In that moment, surrounded by the artificial luxury of his gilded cage, Adebayo felt a grace so real and so powerful it brought him to his knees."

                                        "text": "The morning after his performance, Adebayo awoke to a profound and unnerving silence. The usual pre-dawn cacophony of the compound\u2014the thumping bass from someone\u2019s headphones, the competitive vocal runs from the shower, the loud, boastful chatter\u2014was gone. In its place was a quiet so complete it felt like a held breath. When he walked into the communal kitchen, the few contestants already there stopped their conversations mid-sentence. They didn't look at him with jealousy or admiration anymore; they looked at him with a kind of awe-struck fear, as if he were a visitor from another plane of existence. He was no longer one of them, a scrabbler in the dirt fighting for a spot. Chief Obinna\u2019s declaration had placed him on a separate, lonely pedestal. He was \u2018the standard\u2019, a fixed point against which their own frantic orbits would be measured. It was not a promotion; it was an exile.\n\nThe new dynamic was on full display at breakfast. Bisi, the young pop singer who had once asked for the secret to his pain, now quietly placed the ripest slices of mango on his plate, her head bowed as if making an offering to a deity. Others gave him a wide berth, their eyes skittering away from his. He saw MC Slate across the room, watching him over the rim of a coffee mug, his expression a cold, flat line of calculation. The rapper was not awed; he was analyzing a new and dangerous variable in the equation. The fawning reverence of the others was suffocating, but Slate\u2019s silent, clinical assessment was far more unsettling. Adebayo felt like an animal that had been separated from the herd, a position that made him both respected and intensely vulnerable. He ate his mango in silence, the sweet fruit tasting like ash in his mouth, the loneliness of his new station a cold weight in his stomach.\n\nLater that morning, he was summoned not to Diana, but to a formal meeting with Zara Kalu and the show\u2019s Head of Publicity, a sharp, fast-talking woman named Yetunde. They sat him down in a glass-walled conference room, a stack of glossy magazines between them. \u201cAdebayo, your metrics are unprecedented,\u201d Yetunde began, tapping a tablet that glowed with charts and graphs. \u201cYou\u2019re not just a television personality anymore; you\u2019re a cultural moment.\u201d Zara Kalu leaned forward, her expression devoid of sentiment. \u201cAnd moments are perishable. We need to capitalize. *BellaNaija* wants a digital cover and an in-depth feature. *Genevieve Magazine* is proposing a full family spread for their Christmas issue.\u201d She paused, her gaze pointed. \u201cYour story of struggle is very\u2026 aspirational right now. It sells. We need to frame it properly before the narrative gets away from us.\u201d Adebayo stared at the mock-up of a magazine cover on the tablet. It was his face, artfully shadowed, with the headline: \u2018FROM THE FLOOR TO THE STARS: THE AMAZING GRACE OF ADEBAYO OKORO\u2019. He felt a wave of nausea. They weren't just owning his voice; they were packaging his past, shrink-wrapping his pain for mass-market consumption.\n\nHis blood ran cold at the mention of a family spread. That afternoon, he called Funke, a knot of dread tightening in his chest. Her voice, when she answered, was thin and ragged. \u201cThey are here, Adebayo,\u201d she whispered, her voice cracking. \u201cOutside. They have been there since morning.\u201d He didn\u2019t have to ask who. The press. \u201cMen with big cameras. They are talking to the neighbours, offering them money to talk about us. Mrs. Ojo from next door told me one of them tried to take a picture of Amara through the window.\u201d A bolt of pure, primal fear shot through Adebayo, eclipsing everything else. This was his fault. His ambition, his dream, had shattered the small, fragile pane of their privacy and invited the wolves to their door. \u201cI can\u2019t take her for her vaccinations. I can\u2019t even go to the market. We are prisoners in our own home, Adebayo. What have you done?\u201d The question was not an accusation; it was a genuine, desperate plea for an answer he did not have.\n\nRage, cold and pure, propelled him from the garden and straight to Yetunde\u2019s office. He burst in without knocking, his usual deference incinerated by his protective fury. \u201cMy family,\u201d he said, his voice a low growl that made the polished publicist look up in alarm. \u201cYou have to get those people away from my family. Now. My daughter is not a part of your story.\u201d Yetunde stood, her expression shifting from surprise to a practiced, sympathetic frown. \u201cAdebayo, please. I understand you\u2019re upset. But this is the nature of the beast. You are beloved. The public feels a connection to you, and your family is an extension of that. This is the price of this new life.\u201d She spread her hands in a gesture of helplessness that was utterly insincere. \u201cWe have no control over the press.\u201d It was a lie, and they both knew it. He saw with blinding clarity that to them, his family\u2019s fear was not a crisis to be managed, but a valuable B-story, another texture in the rich tapestry of his brand. He had absolutely no power. The realization left him feeling more helpless than he ever had while holding a mop.\n\nThe week\u2019s theme was announced that evening in the main studio, the air thick with tension. The host, radiating manufactured excitement, stood before a giant screen that flashed the word \u2018DUETS\u2019. \u201cThis week, we\u2019re pairing you up! You\u2019ll have to find harmony with one of your fellow competitors in a performance that celebrates the spirit of unity!\u201d Adebayo felt a deep sense of foreboding. The producers were not interested in unity; they were interested in drama. His name was the last to be called. \u201cAnd finally, our Heart of Naija, the man who stands alone\u2026 will be standing with another! He\u2019ll be paired with the lyrical fire of\u2026 MC Slate!\u201d The camera zoomed in for a split screen of their reactions. Adebayo\u2019s face was a stoic mask of resignation, while a slow, predatory smile spread across Slate\u2019s face. It was the smile of a wolf that had just been handed a sheep for a playmate. To complete the brutal irony, the song assigned to them was a classic Fela Kuti anthem about brotherhood and solidarity.\n\nTheir first rehearsal was a clash of two opposing forces of nature. They met in a small, soundproofed studio, an engineer looking on nervously. Adebayo, with his acoustic guitar, began to feel out a soulful, melodic interpretation of the song\u2019s chorus. MC Slate let him play for less than a minute before cutting him off with a sharp gesture. \u201cNo, no, no,\u201d he said, shaking his head, a look of pitying condescension on his face. \u201cSave the sad church music for your solo career, old man. This is Fela. This is fire and rhythm. It\u2019s politics. It\u2019s not a lullaby for your baby.\u201d He tapped a beat out on the table, a complex, aggressive rhythm that was the polar opposite of Adebayo\u2019s gentle cadence. \u201cI\u2019ll take the verses. You just come in on the hook. And try to keep up. This isn\u2019t about your feelings. It\u2019s about the beat. You follow it, or it runs you over.\u201d He leaned in, his voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper, his eyes gleaming with cold amusement. \u201cThey want unity? Fine. We\u2019ll give them a war and call it a duet.\u201d"

                                        "text": "The rehearsals became a battleground for two irreconcilable ideologies. Slate, a creature of the digital age, treated the song like a piece of code to be hacked. He arrived with a laptop and a small synthesizer, layering the raw, brassy funk of the original Fela track with sharp, aggressive 808-bass hits and trap hi-hats. The result was slick, modern, and undeniably catchy, but to Adebayo, it felt like a desecration. He would try to sing the chorus, his voice seeking the soulful, melodic pocket of the groove, only to find the pocket had been paved over with a concrete slab of synthetic rhythm. His voice, designed to swell and fill space, was now forced into a narrow, percussive lane, competing with Slate\u2019s rapid-fire, polysyllabic verses. The rapper moved with a boxer\u2019s swagger, his rhymes a dazzling display of lyrical acrobatics, but the words were about a generalized, fashionable anger\u2014a protest against an abstract \u2018system\u2019 that sounded more like a brand identity than a genuine grievance.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not working, old man,\u201d Slate would say, cutting the beat with a tap of his spacebar. He\u2019d lean back in his chair, a smirk playing on his lips. \u201cYour flow is from another era. This song needs punch, it needs aggression. You\u2019re trying to turn a protest anthem into a church spiritual.\u201d Diana and the producers, who now sat in on every rehearsal, would nod in agreement. They were mesmerized by Slate\u2019s modernity. He was the sound of the radio, the pulse of the clubs. Adebayo was a beautiful, but dated, piece of furniture they didn\u2019t quite know what to do with. \u201cPerhaps you could try to be more\u2026 rhythmic, Adebayo,\u201d Diana suggested gently, her words dripping with condescension. \u201cThink of your voice as another drum in the mix, not the main melody.\u201d Adebayo gripped his acoustic guitar, the one he now brought to rehearsals as a silent protest, its warm wood a talisman against the cold onslaught of Slate\u2019s electronics. \u201cFela was not just a drum, he was a story,\u201d Adebayo argued, his voice low with a frustration that was nearing its limit. \u201cHis anger came from a real place, from seeing his people suffer. This\u2026\u201d he gestured at the laptop, \u201cthis has no soul. It\u2019s just noise.\u201d Slate laughed, a short, sharp bark. \u201cSoul doesn\u2019t get you streams, Uncle. A hot beat does. Welcome to the 21st century.\u201d\n\nThe war in the studio was a pale shadow of the siege his family was enduring. The phone calls to Funke became fraught with a shared, helpless terror. Her voice was a frayed wire. \u201cI haven\u2019t left the room in two days, Adebayo,\u201d she whispered, the generator rumbling in the background, a sound he now associated with the life he had abandoned. \u201cThey don\u2019t leave. There\u2019s a car parked across the street, all day, all night. Amara has a rash from the heat in the room. I can\u2019t open the window because their cameras are right there.\u201d The image of his daughter, trapped and uncomfortable in the sweltering heat because of his ambition, was a knife in Adebayo\u2019s gut. He felt a rage so potent it made his hands shake, a fury directed at the faceless press, at the producers who enabled them, and most of all, at himself. He had flown too close to the sun, and the heat was scorching his family.\n\nHe stormed into Zara Kalu\u2019s office, bypassing her assistant and the polite protocols he had been taught. He found her on a call, discussing advertising rates. He stood in the middle of her plush carpet, vibrating with a silent fury, until she finished her call and looked up at him, her eyebrows raised in annoyance. \u201cThis needs to stop,\u201d he said, his voice shaking. \u201cMy family. My daughter. This is not part of the deal.\u201d Zara sighed, a sound of weary impatience, as if dealing with a child\u2019s tantrum. She steepled her fingers. \u201cAdebayo, you have become a very valuable property. And valuable properties attract attention. This is a symptom of your success. Your story is compelling. The press is simply telling it. I cannot put a leash on every journalist in Lagos.\u201d He took a step closer to her desk, his large frame casting a shadow over her. \u201cThen get them out of my house,\u201d he said, his voice dropping to a dangerous whisper. \u201cMove them. Now. Put them somewhere safe. A hotel. Anywhere. Use the money you are making from my \u2018valuable property\u2019 and protect the people I love.\u201d For the first time, he saw a flicker of something other than commercial calculation in Zara\u2019s eyes. It might have been respect, or it might have been the simple recognition of a man pushed to his absolute limit. She held his gaze for a long moment, then gave a curt, almost imperceptible nod. \u201cI will make some calls,\u201d she said. It was a concession, a small one, but it was something.\n\nThe call she made, however, was not the one he expected. The next day, Chief Obinna himself swept into their rehearsal. He did not sit. He stood by the door, a silent, imposing monolith, and gestured for them to perform. They launched into their disjointed, combative version of the song. Adebayo sang the hook with a heavy heart, his voice muted and resigned, while Slate attacked the verses with even more ferocity than usual, his rhymes sharp and serrated. It was a mess, a dialogue of the deaf, the sound of two artists falling down a flight of stairs together. When they finished, the silence in the room was thick with failure. The Chief let it hang in the air for a moment before he spoke, his voice calm. \u201cI understand there is some\u2026 creative friction,\u201d he said, his eyes on Adebayo. \u201cAnd that your family is experiencing some unwanted attention, Mr. Okoro. A difficult situation.\u201d He paused. \u201cFela Kuti\u2019s mother was thrown from a window by soldiers. He was beaten, his home was burned, his people were terrorized. He took that pain and he put it into his music. He turned his suffering into a weapon.\u201d The Chief\u2019s gaze was hard as granite. \u201cYou are being hounded by men with cameras, not guns. And you have been given a microphone that reaches millions. Do not come to my producers with your problems. Bring them to the stage. That is what an artist does.\u201d He turned to leave, pausing at the door. \u201cGive them a war,\u201d he said, echoing Slate\u2019s own words, a chilling smile touching his lips. \u201cThe ratings will be spectacular.\u201d\n\nThe Chief\u2019s words were a death sentence for the song, but they were a key for Adebayo. He finally understood. The Chief didn't want him to be a singer; he wanted him to be a gladiator. The show wasn't a competition; it was an arena, and his personal pain was just another exotic beast to be released for the crowd\u2019s entertainment. He had been looking for a way out, a way to protect his family, but the only path offered was to bleed for them on live television. If they wanted a war, he would give them one. But it would not be Slate\u2019s war of beats and rhymes, or the Chief\u2019s war for ratings. It would be his own. He would fight for the only thing that mattered: his family\u2019s peace.\n\nThat night, Adebayo sat with the lyrics to the Fela song, a pen in his hand. He began to cross out words, to write new ones in the margins. He took the song\u2019s themes of political oppression and corporate greed and refracted them through the small, powerful lens of his own experience. He wrote about the long lens of a camera that steals a child\u2019s image, about the rented privacy of a one-room flat, about a man who sells his story and finds his family paying the price. It was a direct, unambiguous message, a plea and a condemnation aimed squarely at the press and at the industry that fed them. It was a terrifying act of defiance, far more dangerous than simply changing a melody. This was sedition.\n\nOn the night of the show, as they stood in the wings, the roar of the crowd a physical pressure against their bodies, the tension between Adebayo and Slate was a palpable, static charge. They had not spoken a word to each other since their final, disastrous rehearsal. Slate, dressed in a sharp, military-style jacket, bounced on his toes, hyped and ready for battle. Adebayo stood perfectly still in a simple black shirt, the acoustic guitar strapped to his back, his face a calm, unreadable mask. Slate glanced at him, a final, taunting smirk on his lips. \u201cReady to get run over, old man? The beat waits for no one.\u201d Adebayo looked at him, his eyes holding a deep, quiet sorrow. \u201cI am not fighting you, my brother,\u201d he said, his voice barely a whisper. \u201cI am fighting for my own.\u201d Before Slate could process the strange response, their names were called, and they walked out into the blinding lights of the arena, two unwilling soldiers marching into a war where only one of them knew the true stakes."

                                        "text": "The stage lights flared, and the Chief\u2019s words, \u201cGive them a war,\u201d echoed in Adebayo\u2019s mind like a curse. The slick, aggressive beat dropped with the force of a slammed door, and MC Slate launched into his first verse. He was a master of his craft, a whirlwind of motion and sound. His rhymes were intricate, his delivery precise as a surgeon\u2019s scalpel, his body a conduit for the cold, synthetic fire of the track. He prowled the stage, his every gesture dripping with a confident, marketable swagger. The audience, primed for a battle, responded instantly, their heads nodding to the heavy 808-bass, their hands in the air. Slate was giving them exactly what they came for: a spectacle. He was playing his part in the Chief\u2019s arena perfectly, a gladiator dazzling the crowd with his flashy swordsmanship.\n\nAdebayo stood still, a quiet island in the storm of Slate\u2019s performance, the acoustic guitar a dormant weight on his back. The camera repeatedly cut to him, framing him as the passive, older man about to be devoured by the young lion\u2019s energy. He could feel the producers\u2019 glee in the control room, the narrative playing out just as they had designed it. Slate finished his verse with a final, explosive lyrical flourish, pointing a finger at Adebayo, a gesture of challenge that sent a fresh roar through the crowd. The beat pulsed, a hungry, expectant heartbeat, waiting for Adebayo to step into the lane they had prepared for him, to sing his assigned hook, to be the soulful counterpoint to Slate\u2019s jagged edges.\n\nIt was his turn. But Adebayo did not sing. Instead, he calmly unslung the acoustic guitar. The movement was slow, deliberate, a quiet act of sabotage in the high-tempo theatre of the show. He stepped forward, not to the main microphone, but to a secondary one typically used for backup singers. He looked across the stage, past the flashing lights, and met the eyes of the show\u2019s veteran musical director, a man he had spoken to only once. He gave a single, firm nod. The director, after a split second of stunned hesitation, seemed to understand. He raised a hand. The pounding electronic beat, the very lifeblood of Slate\u2019s performance, stuttered and died. An abrupt, shocking silence descended on the studio, a vacuum where a wall of sound had been moments before. Thousands of people, Slate, the judges, and the entire production crew held a collective breath.\n\nInto that silence, Adebayo played a single chord. It was a simple, minor chord, full of a quiet, sorrowful ache. It was the sound of a leaky roof and a single candle burning in the dark. Then, he began to sing, his voice not the soaring tenor of his gospel performances, but a low, conversational baritone, a voice telling a story to a friend. But his words were not Fela\u2019s. They were his own. \u201cYou see a story, you see a headline,\u201d he sang, his eyes finding the dark, unblinking lens of the main camera. \u201cI see the fear behind my child\u2019s curtain. You want my pain, you want my struggle? You can have the song, but you can\u2019t have her.\u201d The lyrics were a direct, unadorned missile. The air in the studio grew thick with a tension far deeper than competitive spirit. This was no longer a performance. It was a public reckoning.\n\nSlate stood frozen mid-stage, his swagger evaporated, his microphone hanging uselessly at his side. He looked from Adebayo to the judges and back again, his face a mask of pure disbelief. This was not the war he had signed up for. Adebayo continued, his voice gaining a quiet, steely strength, his fingers picking out the mournful melody. \u201cYou buy my neighbour\u2019s words for a silver coin, you plant your hunger in my quiet street. Is this brotherhood? Or just a hungry market, selling pieces of my life to the beat?\u201d Every word was a photograph, a specific indictment of the past week\u2019s horrors. He was singing directly to the press, to the producers, to the Chief himself. He was breaking the unspoken covenant of the show: that the performer\u2019s pain is a commodity to be exploited, never a weapon to be turned against the exploiters. He finished his verse, the final chord of the guitar hanging in the air like a question.\n\nHe looked over at Slate, his expression not one of triumph, but of weary invitation. \u201cMy brother,\u201d he sang, his voice softening, repurposing the song\u2019s original theme, \u201cthey build a wall between us two. They give you a crown and me a cross to bear. But their hungry cameras, they will come for you, when my story\u2019s old, and my soul is bare.\u201d For the first time, a flicker of understanding crossed Slate\u2019s face. He saw the trap for what it was. He was not Adebayo\u2019s opponent; he was just the next course on the menu. In a move that shocked everyone, most of all himself, Slate raised his microphone. But he did not rap. In a raw, unpolished singing voice, he echoed Adebayo\u2019s last line, his voice a stark harmony of dawning solidarity. \"When your story's old, and your soul is bare.\" Then he let the microphone fall to his side, effectively ceding the stage, the song, and the war. Adebayo finished the song alone, his final words a quiet, powerful prayer for peace, ending not with a bang, but with the soft, resonant fade of a single, hopeful major chord.\n\nThe aftermath was a silence more profound than any he had yet created. It was the silence of a truth that left no room for applause. The host stood by the side of the stage, his cue cards useless, his face pale. On the judges\u2019 panel, Femi Rhymz was on his feet, not clapping, but nodding slowly, his face a portrait of solemn respect. Zara Kalu was scribbling furiously, her mind already calculating the fallout, the potential for lawsuits, the catastrophic breach of contract. And Chief Obinna sat like a statue carved from volcanic rock. His face was devoid of all expression, but his eyes, fixed on Adebayo, burned with a cold, terrifying fire. He had wanted a gladiator to entertain his arena. Instead, a slave had stood up, addressed the emperor directly, and questioned the very existence of the games. Adebayo had not just broken the rules; he had shattered the illusion that held the entire enterprise together. He had done the one thing the Chief could not tolerate: he had taken his power back."

The host, a man paid for his seamless patter, stood frozen by the side of the stage, his face a comical mask of panic. The applause, when it finally came, was scattered and confused, quickly dying out as people looked at each other, unsure if they had witnessed an artistic triumph or a televised career suicide. Adebayo and Slate didn't wait for a verdict. In a silent, mutual understanding, they both turned and walked off stage, not towards the triumphant embrace of the other contestants, but towards the dark, uncertain corridors backstage.\n\nThe moment they were out of the audience\u2019s line of sight, the dam of professional composure broke. Stagehands scurried past them, avoiding their eyes. Producers with headsets were shouting into their microphones, their voices sharp with panic. Diana stood by a lighting rig, her face ashen, looking at Adebayo as if he were a ghost. They were intercepted not by a congratulatory crew member, but by two grim-faced security guards who wordlessly gestured for them to follow. They were led to a small, sterile green room, the kind reserved for problematic guests, and the door was shut behind them, leaving them in a sudden, ringing quiet.\n\nFor a long moment, neither man spoke. Slate paced the small room like a caged panther, running his hands over his head. He finally stopped and faced Adebayo, his eyes wide with a mixture of terror and incredulous respect. \u201cDo you have any idea what you just did?\u201d he breathed, his voice a hoarse whisper. \u201cYou didn\u2019t just change the lyrics. You pulled the pin on a grenade and handed it to Chief Obinna on live television. You read out a suicide note and signed my name to it.\u201d Adebayo sank onto a small sofa, the adrenaline finally leaving him, replaced by a profound, bone-deep weariness. He looked at the younger man, seeing not a rival, but a fellow inmate. \u201cI did what I had to do for my family,\u201d he said simply. Slate let out a short, sharp, humorless laugh. \u201cYour family? Old man, we are all his family now. And he does not like it when his children disobey.\u201d He slumped into a chair opposite Adebayo, the swagger completely stripped from him, leaving only a scared, ambitious young man who had just seen the gears of the machine he so desperately wanted to master. \u201cSo what happens now?\u201d Slate asked, the question hanging in the air between them, heavy and unanswered.\n\nThey didn't have to wait long. The door opened and the brisk woman with the headset stood there, her face impassive. \u201cThe Chief will see you. Both of you. Now.\u201d This time, the summons felt different. It was not a call to an office; it was a summons to an execution. They walked the long, silent corridors to the top floor, the two guards trailing them like an escort to the gallows. The Chief\u2019s office was darker than before, the city lights outside twinkling like a distant, indifferent galaxy. Chief Obinna was not alone. Zara Kalu sat stiffly in one of the leather chairs, her face pale. Femi Rhymz stood by the window, his back to the room, a silent statement of his discomfort. A third man, thin and severe in a grey suit Adebayo had not seen before, stood beside the Chief\u2019s desk, a leather-bound portfolio in his hand. He was clearly a lawyer.\n\nThe Chief did not invite them to sit. He let them stand in the centre of the room, a pair of errant schoolboys before the headmaster. He gestured to the lawyer. \u201cMr. Bello, please remind our two artists of the contractual obligations they so flagrantly violated tonight.\u201d The lawyer opened his portfolio and began to read in a dry, emotionless monotone, citing clauses about unauthorized lyrical changes, deviation from approved musical arrangements, and actions causing material damage to the show\u2019s brand and sponsor relationships. The list was long and the financial penalties attached to each violation were astronomical, sums of money so vast they seemed like a joke. Slate visibly paled, his bravado crumbling under the sheer weight of the numbers. Adebayo listened, his expression unchanged. He had never had that kind of money, so the threat of losing it was meaningless. He had only ever had his family and his voice, and he had just used one to defend the other.\n\n\u201cIn short,\u201d the Chief said, cutting the lawyer off, \u201cI own this show. I own the stage you stand on. I own the song you butchered. And according to this document, for the next seven years, I own you. I could sue you both into a state of poverty so absolute your grandchildren would be born into debt.\u201d He let the threat hang in the air, a sword dangling by a thread. He then turned his gaze entirely on Adebayo. \u201cHowever. Zara informs me that your little stunt has, paradoxically, been a ratings success. It seems the public enjoys watching a man set fire to his own house.\u201d A cold smile touched his lips. \u201cSo I will offer you a choice, Mr. Okoro. A chance for redemption. At the beginning of the next show, you will issue a full, public apology. You will state that you were overcome with emotion, that you acted unprofessionally, and that you are deeply grateful for the opportunities this platform has provided. You will then perform the song we assign you, exactly as we arrange it. You will be compliant, you will be humble, and you will do exactly as you are told. In return, I will forget this evening\u2019s transgression. The war, as you call it, will be over.\u201d\n\nThe offer was clear: capitulate completely, become the puppet they always wanted, or face total annihilation. Adebayo felt Slate\u2019s desperate gaze on him, silently pleading for him to take the deal. He looked at the Chief, at this man who built empires on the dreams of others, and he felt not fear, but a profound, clarifying calm. \u201cI will not apologize for protecting my family,\u201d he said, his voice quiet but unshakable. \u201cAnd I will not sing words that are not true. If you wish to sue me, you must do so. But I will not lie for you.\u201d Femi Rhymz turned from the window, a look of agonized pride on his face. The lawyer blinked, nonplussed. Zara closed her eyes. It was the Chief who slowly began to nod, as if Adebayo had just confirmed a long-held suspicion.\n\n\u201cI see,\u201d he said, his voice dropping to a deceptively soft tone. \u201cYou mistake a courtroom for my only weapon. You think this is a matter of contracts.\u201d He stood up and walked around his desk, stopping directly in front of Adebayo, so close that Adebayo could smell the expensive cologne he wore. The Chief\u2019s face was a mask of cold fury. \u201cLet me explain how power truly works, Mr. Okoro. I will not sue you. It\u2019s messy and public. Instead, I will make a few phone calls. A word to the landlord of The Palms Residence about a problematic tenant whose extended family is causing a disturbance. A quiet inquiry to the tax authorities about undeclared income from a small, cash-only hairdressing business. A suggestion to the immigration service to review the residency status of certain family members. I will not destroy you with a lawsuit, Mr. Okoro. I will simply unravel your life, thread by thread, from a thousand miles away, with a telephone. And no one will ever trace it back to me.\u201d He paused, his eyes like black stones. \u201cNow, ask yourself. Who is the real gladiator here?\u201d\n\nThe threat was a masterpiece of casual cruelty, so absolute and untraceable it left no room for defiance. It bypassed Adebayo entirely and went straight for the foundations of his world, for Funke and Amara. He felt the floor drop out from beneath him. He had faced down the cameras, the judges, the machine itself, but he had no defense against this, the quiet, administrative violence of a powerful man. He had won the battle on stage, but in this dark, silent office, he had been utterly and completely defeated. The Chief, seeing the broken look in his eyes, smiled, a victor\u2019s smile. \u201cI expect your apology to be very convincing,\u201d he said, turning and walking back to his desk. \u201cYou are dismissed.\u201d\n\nNumbly, Adebayo and Slate were escorted from the office. They rode the elevator down in a crushing silence. Slate looked at Adebayo, his earlier fear now replaced by a deep, weary pity. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, man,\u201d he whispered as the doors opened. Adebayo didn\u2019t respond. He walked through the now-deserted backstage area and out into the cool night air. The world felt tilted on its axis. He had sung his truth, and his truth had led him and his family to the edge of a cliff. He finally pulled out his phone, his hand trembling, and dialled Funke\u2019s number, dreading the sound of her voice. She answered, not with fear, but with a strange, breathless urgency. \u201cAdebayo? A car came. A black car, just like yours. A woman in a suit, she said she was from the production company. She said we had to pack one bag, that we were being moved somewhere safe for a few days.\u201d Adebayo\u2019s heart stopped. \u201cWhere? Where are you going?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said, her voice a mixture of terror and confusion. \u201cA hotel, she said. She gave me money. A lot of money. For food, for Amara. Adebayo\u2026 what is happening? I don\u2019t know if I am being rescued or taken hostage.\u201d The line crackled, and he heard the car door slam shut, followed by the sound of an engine starting. In the background, he heard Amara begin to cry."

                                        "text": "The sound of Amara\u2019s cry, cut off by the closing of a car door, was the most violent sound Adebayo had ever heard. It echoed in the vast, empty space where his defiance had lived just moments before. He stood on the pavement outside the studio complex, the city\u2019s indifferent lights blurring into streaks before his eyes. He was a king who had stormed the palace gates only to find the enemy was already inside his home, holding a knife to the throat of everything he loved. The Chief\u2019s threat was a poison that had bypassed his skin and gone straight to his soul, paralyzing him from the inside out. He stumbled to a nearby bus stop bench and sank onto it, the cold plastic a shock against his legs. His phone felt impossibly heavy in his hand. Funke was in a car, going to an unknown location, and he did not know if she was a hostage or a protected asset. The ambiguity was a form of torture all its own.\n\nHis fingers, clumsy with a tremor he could not control, dialled the only number that might hold an answer. Zara Kalu picked up on the first ring, her voice crisp and alert, as if she had been expecting his call. \"Adebayo,\" she said, her tone devoid of surprise. He dispensed with any greeting. \"My family,\" he rasped, his voice a dry husk. \"Where are they?\" There was a brief pause on the other end, the sound of a pen tapping against a desk. \"They are safe,\" she said, her voice a cool statement of fact. \"I had them moved to a serviced apartment in Ikoyi. It's clean, it's secure, and most importantly, it's anonymous. The press will not find them there.\" The relief that washed over him was so immense it was physically painful, a cramp in his chest that stole his breath. But it was immediately followed by a cold wave of suspicion. This was not an act of charity. Zara Kalu did not perform acts of charity.\n\n\"Why?\" he asked, the word a shard of glass in his throat. He heard her sigh, a sound of faint, professional impatience. \"Because your public breakdown, while good for ratings, has created a logistical nightmare. Your family was under siege, a situation which was making you unstable. An unstable asset is a depreciating asset, Adebayo. I simply stabilized the situation. Consider it an advance against your future earnings. Nothing is free.\" There it was. The cold, brutal transaction at the heart of everything. She had not saved his family; she had moved them from a cage made of peeling paint and poverty into a cleaner, more expensive cage, and in doing so, had fastened a new, stronger leash around his neck. \"The apartment is paid for. The fridge is stocked. Your wife has been given a per diem for sundries. They are comfortable. And they will remain so, as long as you are\u2026 cooperative.\" The word hung in the air between them, a perfectly polished threat.\n\nFunke stood in the middle of a living room that was larger than their entire flat. The air smelled faintly of bleach and air freshener, a sterile, impersonal scent. Amara, startled by the strange surroundings, had finally cried herself to sleep in Funke\u2019s arms. The woman in the suit, whose name Funke had already forgotten, had left them with two key cards and a thick envelope of cash on the polished dining table. \u201cFor your expenses,\u201d she had said with a tight smile. \u201cSomeone will be in touch.\u201d Funke walked through the apartment, her bare feet silent on the cool, tiled floor. There was a kitchen with a gleaming, unused stove and a refrigerator humming with fullness. There were two bedrooms with clean, white sheets turned down on the beds. The bathroom had a stack of fluffy white towels and tiny bottles of soap. It was a perfect, soulless imitation of a home. She looked out the window, down ten stories to a quiet street lined with expensive cars and guarded gates. There were no neighbours shouting, no generators rumbling, no smell of fried plantain in the air. She was safe from the press, from the prying eyes, from the daily grind of her old life. And she had never felt more imprisoned.\n\nHe met Zara the next day in a quiet caf\u00e9, a place so discreet and expensive that the air itself seemed to hum with the sound of money. She slid a key card across the table to him. \u201cThe address for the apartment,\u201d she said. \u201cYou may visit, but you will be discreet. No grand entrances.\u201d Adebayo looked at the key card, a small piece of plastic that represented both his family\u2019s safety and his own capitulation. He pushed it back towards her. \u201cWhat do you want from me?\u201d he asked, his voice flat. Zara took a sip of her espresso, her eyes appraising him over the rim of the tiny cup. \u201cI want what the Chief wants,\u201d she said bluntly. \u201cAn apology. A performance. Compliance. You had your moment of rebellion, Adebayo. It was spectacular television. But the story now requires a new arc: redemption. The prodigal son returns to the fold, humbled and grateful. The public will love it. It\u2019s a classic for a reason.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd if I refuse?\u201d he asked, the question a hollow echo of the man he had been twenty-four hours earlier. Zara placed her cup down with a soft click. \u201cIf you refuse, the apartment in Ikoyi will cease to be available. The per diem will stop. And the Chief will pick up his telephone. My job is to manage the asset, Adebayo. If the asset refuses to perform, it gets liquidated. I am not your friend. I am not your saviour. I am the person telling you, in very clear terms, how to survive. You have a beautiful voice and a powerful story. Don't be a fool and throw it all away for a pride that will not feed your daughter.\u201d She stood, placing a few bills on the table. \u201cYour rehearsal with Diana is at two. Your song is \u2018Bridge Over Troubled Water\u2019. I trust you\u2019ll find the theme appropriate.\u201d She gave him a final, dismissive look and walked out of the caf\u00e9, leaving him alone with the key card and the bitter taste of his defeat.\n\nThe journey to the apartment in Ikoyi felt like a pilgrimage to the site of his own surrender. He found Funke sitting by the large window, staring down at the silent street, Amara sleeping on a clean blanket at her feet. She looked up as he entered, her eyes tired but sharp. She did not run to him, did not embrace him. She simply watched him, waiting. He knelt down beside Amara, his large hand stroking her soft hair, the familiar ritual a painful anchor in this strange new world. \u201cAre you alright?\u201d he whispered to Funke. She gave a short, humorless laugh. \u201cI have food I did not have to cook, light that does not depend on a generator, and a door with three locks. I am a queen in a palace, my husband. How can I not be alright?\u201d Her sarcasm was a shield, protecting a core of fear and anger he knew was directed as much at him as at their unseen captors.\n\nHe sat on the floor opposite her, the space between them filled with the enormity of his failure. \u201cThey want me to apologize,\u201d he said, the words costing him more than any song ever had. \u201cOn the next show. I have to tell them I was wrong.\u201d He waited for her condemnation, for the disappointment in her voice. But Funke simply nodded, her gaze fixed on her sleeping daughter. \u201cAnd will you?\u201d she asked, her voice neutral. \u201cI have no choice,\u201d he confessed, the admission a final, painful surrender. \u201cThey\u2026 they will hurt us, Funke. Not just me. Us. You. Our life.\u201d She reached out and placed her hand on his, her touch a spark of warmth in the cold, air-conditioned room. \u201cI know,\u201d she said softly. \u201cI have known since they put us in this car. We are their property now, Adebayo. You have been from the beginning. I am just catching up.\u201d She looked at him then, her eyes clear and unblinking. \u201cSo go. Apologize. Thank them for the golden chains. We are survivors, my love. We will do what we must. Sing their song. But when you sing, sing it for us. Let it be our secret, in the middle of their noise.\u201d\n\nHis rehearsal with Diana was a quiet, somber affair. He walked in, accepted the sheet music for the Simon & Garfunkel classic, and stood by the piano. He did not argue. He did not offer his own interpretation. He simply waited for her instruction. Diana, clearly briefed on the new world order, was all brisk professionalism. \u201cThe arrangement is simple. Piano, strings. Very sincere. You will stand centre stage. You will look into the camera. You will be humble,\u201d she instructed. He nodded. When she asked him to sing, he opened his mouth and the song came out, perfectly on pitch, perfectly controlled, and utterly empty. The fire was gone. The raw, unvarnished soul that had captivated a nation was banked, hidden away behind a wall of compliance. Diana listened, a small, satisfied smile on her face. This was the singer she had wanted all along: a flawless vocalist, a beautiful vessel with nothing inside. As he sang the famous lines, \u201cWhen you're weary, feeling small\u2026 I will be your bridge,\u201d he wasn\u2019t thinking of the audience or the judges. He was thinking of Funke\u2019s hand on his, and the quiet, terrible strength in her voice as she told him to survive. He would be their bridge, a bridge made of his own humiliation, to carry them over this troubled water. And he would let them all watch him do it."

                                        "text": "The night of the show, Adebayo was dressed in a simple, dark suit, a uniform of solemnity chosen by the stylists to complement his new role as the repentant sinner. There was no guitar waiting for him in the wings, no quiet corner for a moment of solitary preparation. He was led from the dressing room to the backstage area by a production assistant who hovered around him like a nervous warden, ensuring he didn't stray from the pre-approved path. The air, which on previous nights had crackled with a vibrant, competitive energy, was now thick with a different kind of tension. The other contestants avoided his eyes, their whispers ceasing as he drew near. He was a walking ghost story, a cautionary tale about flying too high and falling too far. His public humiliation was to be the opening act, and no one wanted to stand too close to the man about to be sacrificed.\n\nDiana approached him, not with her usual mix of fury or fawning, but with a cool, detached professionalism. She straightened his tie, her fingers clinical and cold. \u201cRemember what we discussed, Adebayo,\u201d she said, her voice low. \u201cThe teleprompter has your statement. Read it exactly as written. No ad-libs, no soulful pauses. And when you sing, remember the notes, not the narrative. We need sincerity, not drama.\u201d She looked him in the eye, and for a fleeting moment, he saw not a coach, but a fellow employee doing a distasteful job. \u201cJust get through it,\u201d she added, her voice dropping almost to a whisper, before turning away.\n\nThe host\u2019s voice boomed through the studio, welcoming the nation back to the show. The introduction was a masterpiece of sanctimonious spin. \u201cLast week, we witnessed a moment of raw, untamed passion. A moment that reminded us that our artists are not just performers, but human beings with deep emotions. Tonight, Adebayo Okoro has something he wants to share with all of us, from the heart.\u201d The lie was so blatant, so perfectly packaged, that Adebayo felt a moment of dizzying detachment, as if he were watching a show about a man who looked just like him. He walked onto the stage into a pool of soft, forgiving light, the audience a sea of expectant faces. The teleprompter glowed in the darkness opposite him, the words stark and white. He took a breath, not of air, but of pure, cold resignation, and began to read the script of his own surrender.\n\n\u201cGood evening,\u201d he began, his voice a flat, hollow echo of its usual richness. \u201cI want to apologize for my conduct during last week\u2019s show.\u201d The words felt like stones in his mouth. \u201cIn a moment of overwhelming emotion, I behaved unprofessionally, and I deeply disrespected my fellow artist, the producers, and this entire platform.\u201d He could feel thousands of eyes on him, and the unblinking red light of the camera lens, a soulless eye demanding its pound of flesh. He forced himself to continue, the script scrolling upwards, pulling him along. \u201cThis competition has given me an opportunity beyond my wildest dreams, a chance to provide a new life for my family. I am profoundly grateful to Chief Obinna, the judges, and the entire Naija Star Voice team for their belief in me. I promise to honour that belief from this day forward.\u201d He finished, the last word falling into a thick, uncomfortable silence. He had done it. He had danced for them.\n\nThen, the gentle, familiar chords of a piano filled the studio, and the orchestra swelled behind it, a lush, sentimental wave of sound designed to wash away the memory of his defiance. He stood at the center of the stage, a solitary figure, as the introduction to \u2018Bridge Over Troubled Water\u2019 began. He closed his eyes for a second, not to find a deep well of emotion, but to see Funke\u2019s face, her eyes telling him to survive. He would be her bridge. He opened his eyes, found the main camera, and began to sing. The voice that emerged was beautiful. It was technically perfect, every note held with impeccable control, every phrase shaped with a craftsman\u2019s precision. It was the voice of a man who had been expertly coached, a flawless instrument playing a flawless song. But it was a voice scrubbed clean of its own history. The harmattan dust, the thickness of palm wine, the unspent gold\u2014it was all gone, locked away in a place the cameras and the coaches could not reach.\n\nHe sang the words of comfort and sacrifice, his performance a masterclass in feigned sincerity. When he sang the line, \u201cI will lay me down,\u201d the camera zoomed in on his face, capturing a flicker of what looked like deep, soulful emotion in his eyes. The audience sighed, moved by the sight of the humbled man offering himself up. But Adebayo was not performing for them. In his mind, he was laying himself down on the sharp, cold stones of the Chief\u2019s power, creating a path for Funke and Amara to walk across, away from the danger he had brought upon them. The performance was a public act of submission, but its intent was a secret act of love. He was building the bridge with the pieces of his own broken pride. He finished the song, his voice fading into the lush swell of the strings, his final note a perfect, polished, and utterly heartbreaking sound.\n\nThe ovation was immediate and thunderous, far louder than the confused applause of the week before. This was a narrative the audience understood and embraced: the fall and the redemption. The judges rose to their feet. Zara Kalu clapped with a satisfied, proprietary smile. Chief Obinna offered a series of slow, deliberate claps, a king applauding a jester who had learned his lesson. It was Femi Rhymz who looked genuinely pained, his applause seeming reluctant. \u201cWelcome back, Adebayo,\u201d he said when the noise died down, his voice heavy. \u201cIt takes a big man to admit his faults, and an even bigger one to sing with such\u2026 humility. That was a beautiful performance.\u201d The praise felt like acid. They were applauding his chains, celebrating the strength of his cage.\n\nBackstage, the spell was broken. The atmosphere had shifted once more. He was no longer a ghost; he was a tame lion, an object of pity. Contestants who had feared him now patted his shoulder with condescending sympathy. \u201cTough night, man, but you handled it,\u201d one said. \u201cThat took guts,\u201d said another, though his eyes said it took a complete lack of them. MC Slate was standing by the door of the dressing room as Adebayo approached. He didn\u2019t offer a platitude. He simply met Adebayo\u2019s gaze and gave a single, slow nod, a gesture that conveyed a universe of shared, bitter understanding. It was a soldier\u2019s salute to a fallen comrade.\n\nAdebayo found a quiet corridor, the sounds of the show fading behind him, and dialled Funke\u2019s number. He felt hollowed out, a vessel emptied of everything that made him himself. She answered instantly. \"I watched,\" she said, her voice quiet, steady. He waited, bracing for what might come next. \"It was a beautiful song,\" she continued, and his heart sank. She had seen the puppet, not the man. \"And your apology,\" she added, \"was very convincing.\" He squeezed his eyes shut, the shame a physical heat on his face. Then, after a pause, her voice changed, losing its formal distance, becoming the voice he knew, the voice that anchored him. \"But I did not hear the apology,\" she whispered, her voice dropping so low it was almost a secret. \"And I did not hear the song they gave you.\" He held his breath. \"I heard you building a bridge, my love,\" she said, her voice thick with unshed tears. \"I heard every single stone you laid down. We are on the other side, Adebayo. We are safe, because of you.\" In the sterile hallway of the studio, surrounded by the architecture of his defeat, Adebayo leaned his head against the cool wall and cried, silent tears of grief and gratitude tracking paths through the makeup on his face. He had lost the war, but he had not lost everything."

                                        "text": "The days that followed his public apology took on a uniform, grey-toned stillness. Adebayo had become a ghost in the machine, a perfectly functioning component that drew no special attention. In the compound, the atmosphere around him shifted from pity to a kind of polite indifference. He was no longer the explosive, unpredictable force to be feared or revered; he was the tame lion, neutered and safe, and therefore, profoundly uninteresting. He would sit at the long dining table for meals, and the boisterous chatter of the other contestants would flow around him, their conversations about social media followers and celebrity gossip parting like a river around a stone. He was included in the headcount, but excluded from the lifeblood of the house. He had been reabsorbed into the background, a transition that was both a relief and a slow, creeping erasure of self.\n\nHis visits to the apartment in Ikoyi were his only anchor to reality, though it was a strange, distorted version of it. A black car would ferry him there twice a week, a silent driver navigating the manicured streets, the journey a passage between two different cages. He would step into the cool, air-conditioned silence of the apartment and find Funke trying to impose their life onto the sterile space. She would cook jollof rice on the gleaming induction stove, but the smell wouldn\u2019t cling to the walls the right way. She would spread her weaving materials on the expensive rug, the familiar colours a small rebellion against the beige and cream decor. Amara was now crawling, a small, determined explorer charting the vast, empty territory of the living room floor. Each visit, Adebayo would notice a new change in his daughter\u2014a new sound, a new dexterity in her tiny hands\u2014and each discovery was a fresh pang of grief for the life he was missing, the daily miracles he had traded for this high-stakes performance.\n\nThey would sit together after Amara was asleep, the city lights glittering below them like a field of fallen stars. The television would be off. The shared silence between them was no longer tense, but thick with a shared, unspoken understanding. They were partners in a long, quiet heist of their own survival. \"I feel like one of Mrs. Ede's friends,\" Funke confessed one evening, her voice low as she looked out the window. \"I have not touched a Naira note that I have earned myself in three weeks. A man brings groceries in a box. I wear clean clothes I did not wash. I am a kept woman, Adebayo. I am safe and I am suffocating.\" He had no words of comfort that weren't a lie. Her agency had been the price of their safety. He took her hand, the calluses on her fingertips, once a testament to her hard work, now softened by a life of enforced idleness. Her strength was being leached away, and it was his fault.\n\nThe competition marched on. The theme for the next show was \u2018Viewer\u2019s Choice\u2019, and the public, having thoroughly enjoyed the drama of his fall and redemption, voted for him to sing a soaring, epic power ballad about overcoming adversity. It was the most obvious, sentimental choice imaginable, and the production team was ecstatic. Diana coached him with a new, simplified mandate: just sound beautiful. His rehearsal sessions were models of efficiency. He learned the melody, memorized the breathing patterns, and delivered the song with the flawless precision of a studio recording. He poured no part of himself into it. He was a vessel, and the song simply passed through him, leaving no trace.\n\nOn the live show, he stood centre stage, bathed in a dramatic blue light, and performed the ballad. His voice was immense, filling the studio with its power and clarity. He hit the climactic high note with a technical perfection that made the judges gasp. It was, by any objective measure, a stunning vocal performance. The audience gave him a standing ovation. The judges were effusive. \u201cIncredible consistency, Adebayo!\u201d Zara praised, her smile wide and genuine. \u201cYou prove week after week what a world-class vocalist you are.\u201d But online, the reaction was more muted. The hashtag #NaijaHeart, which had once set the internet ablaze, was quiet. The comments praised his voice but were missing the fervent, personal connection. \u201cHe sings like an angel,\u201d one comment read, \u201cbut I don\u2019t feel it anymore.\u201d The public didn\u2019t want a perfect singer. They wanted the man who bled on stage, and that man was gone. He was winning the competition, but he was losing his audience.\n\nThe quiet understanding between him and MC Slate solidified into a strange, unspoken alliance. They would find themselves in the same corner of the garden late at night, two smokers sharing a patch of darkness without needing to exchange a light. One night, Slate broke the silence. \"How do you do it?\" he asked, his voice stripped of its usual bravado. \"How do you get on that stage and just\u2026 switch it all off? I watched you tonight. Your eyes were dead.\" Adebayo looked at the glowing tip of his own imaginary cigarette, a habit he didn't have but whose posture he understood. \"I think of my daughter,\" he answered, his voice rough. \"I think of the price of the food she is eating. And then I sing the notes.\" Slate was quiet for a long time, absorbing the bleakness of the answer. \"My father took out a loan for my first mixtape,\" he said, the confession offered up into the darkness. \"My whole village thinks I'm already a star. They don't know I'm deeper in debt now than when I started. We're all just singing for someone else, aren't we?\" In that moment, the rapper from Jos and the caretaker from Lagos were just two men, trapped in the same gilded cage, trying to remember the sound of their own voices.\n\nOne afternoon, his phone rang with an unfamiliar number. He answered cautiously. The voice on the other end was hesitant, familiar. It was Bola, one of the younger security guards from The Palms, a good-natured boy who used to ask Adebayo for advice about his girlfriend. \"Adebayo-sir? Is that you?\" Bola whispered, as if afraid of being overheard. \"It is me, Bola. How are you?\" A wave of nostalgia, sharp and painful, washed over Adebayo. It was a message from a life that felt a century away. \"I am fine, Bola. What is it?\" There was a pause. \"Sir, I just thought you should know,\" Bola said, his voice full of awkward sympathy. \"The\u2026 your flat. The one at the back. There is a new family there. The man is the new head of maintenance. They moved in last week.\"\n\nThe words landed not like a punch, but like the slow, quiet closing of a heavy door. Adebayo stood on the lush, perfectly manicured lawn of the compound, the afternoon sun warm on his skin, and felt a profound, internal chill. He knew, logically, that life at The Palms would move on without him. But the finality of it, the simple fact of another family living in their space, sleeping on the floor where he and Funke had whispered their dreams, was a brutal confirmation of his new reality. His past had not just been left behind; it had been erased, painted over, occupied by someone else. The bridge he had built for his family was strong and it had carried them to safety, but he now saw with devastating clarity that it was a one-way street, and the shore he had departed from had already crumbled into the sea. There was no going home."

The structure of his past, which he had thought he was merely vacationing from, had been demolished and rebuilt in his absence. He was not on leave; he was obsolete. The realization settled deep in his bones during the following days, a cold and heavy truth. The scent of lemon polish and old dust, once the perfume of his life, was now a phantom limb, an ache for something that no longer existed. He had traded his world for a chance to save his family, only to find that the world he\u2019d left behind had ceased to exist, making his sacrifice both total and irreversible.\n\nThis new, hollowed-out version of Adebayo was, to the producers, the perfect contestant. He was reliable, professional, and beautifully, tragically sad. He did as he was told. He hit his notes. He posed for the cameras. And he was dying inside. The grand finale was announced, and the theme was the one he had been dreading most: \u2018Original Song\u2019. Each of the final three contestants\u2014Adebayo, a powerhouse female vocalist from Warri named Efe, and the ever-present MC Slate\u2014was to write and perform a song that defined their journey. For Slate, it was an opportunity to showcase his lyrical genius. For Efe, it was a chance to deliver a show-stopping ballad of empowerment. For Adebayo, it was a death sentence. He had been so thoroughly deconstructed, so expertly coached away from his own instincts, that he no longer knew what his own voice sounded like, let alone what song it wanted to sing.\n\nHe sat for hours in his sterile room with a notebook and a guitar, trying to write. He attempted to craft the song they wanted, the one that fit the \u2018Heart of Naija\u2019 brand. It was a soaring ballad about a man who rose from poverty, a song of gratitude and triumph, full of sweeping metaphors about mountains and stars. The melody was pleasant. The lyrics were inspirational. And it was the most profound lie he had ever constructed. Every chord he played felt like a betrayal, every word a cheap imitation of the feelings he was supposed to have. The wellspring of his music, the unspent gold in his throat, had been buried under layers of compliance and fear. He could not find it. The notebook remained mostly empty.\n\nHis next visit to the apartment in Ikoyi felt different. The news about their old flat hung in the air between him and Funke, a shared, unspoken grief. She was quieter than usual, her movements slower as she went about the strange, listless rhythm of her new life. After they had put a restless Amara to bed, they stood by the vast window, looking down at the silent, orderly city. \u201cIt\u2019s gone, then,\u201d Funke said, her voice so soft he barely heard it. She wasn\u2019t looking at him, but at the reflection of their two silhouettes in the glass. \u201cOur home.\u201d He reached for her hand. \u201cIt was just a place, Funke. Two rooms.\u201d \u201cIt was the place you first sang to Amara,\u201d she countered, her voice gaining a sharp edge of pain. \u201cIt was the place I held your hand when the power was out and you told me about your foolish dreams. It was our place. And now it is nothing.\u201d He had no answer. He could only stand beside her, a co-conspirator in the erasure of their own history.\n\nHe expected her anger, her sorrow, even her blame. What he did not expect was for her to turn from the window, her eyes dry and fiercely bright. \u201cSo, this is it,\u201d she said, her voice no longer soft, but imbued with a hard, brittle strength. \u201cThis apartment. This life of waiting for a car to bring you to us, of eating food someone else has bought. This is what we get for the price of that room?\u201d He shook his head, lost. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you mean.\u201d \u201cI mean,\u201d she said, stepping closer to him, her intensity a physical force, \u201cthat if we have given up our home, our life, our very selves for this competition, then you must not come back here with anything less than a victory. You cannot just survive this thing, Adebayo. You have to finish it. You have to win it. Not for them. For us. So that this\u2026 this gilded cage\u2026 was not for nothing. Go. Write your song. And win.\u201d She was not asking him to comply anymore. She was commanding him to conquer. She was giving him his purpose back, not as a dreamer, but as a fighter with a final, specific mission.\n\nHe returned to the compound that night with Funke\u2019s command echoing in his soul. *Finish it.* He sat with the empty notebook, but his mind was not on the finale or the judges. He was thinking of the bridge he had built. He had thought it was a bridge to safety, but Funke had made him see it was a bridge to this new, sterile world, a world where she was slowly suffocating. Winning was no longer about the money or the fame. It was about earning the right to tear down this safe house and build a real home, one of their own choosing. But the song still wouldn\u2019t come. The weight of their sacrifice was too heavy; it crushed his creativity. Defeated, he pulled out his phone, seeking the one true thing in his life: a glimpse of his daughter. He scrolled through the videos Funke had sent. He found one from that afternoon. It was a short, shaky clip of Amara. She was holding onto the leg of a coffee table, her small body trembling with effort. She let go, her face a mask of intense concentration. She took one wobbly, uncertain step. Then another. And then she tumbled onto the soft rug, looked up at the camera, and broke into a wide, triumphant, drool-covered grin.\n\nAdebayo watched the video again, and again, a sob catching in his throat. It was not a memory of the past. It was a vision of the future. It was a beginning. And in that moment, the song arrived. It came not as a soaring ballad of overcoming adversity, but as a quiet, simple melody, the kind of tune a father would hum while trying to build a foundation. The lyrics were not about rising from the dust; they were about laying the first stone. It was a song about the terrifying, sacred duty of fatherhood, about building a home not of bricks and mortar, but of love and legacy. It was a promise to his daughter, a quiet vow that her first steps would be on ground that was truly their own. He titled it \u2018Amara\u2019s Floor\u2019.\n\nHe wrote through the night, the words and music flowing out of him as if a dam had broken. It was his voice, his true voice, unadorned and honest. The song was spare and beautiful, filled with the texture of his life\u2014not the past life of lemon polish, but his present life as a father fighting for a future. The next morning, exhausted but exhilarated, he sought out the one person in the whole machinery he thought might understand. He found Femi Rhymz in a small, private lounge, away from the other judges. The Afrobeats star looked surprised to see him. \u201cAdebayo. What\u2019s up?\u201d Adebayo stood before him, his notebook in his hand. \u201cI have my song for the finale,\u201d he said. \u201cI wanted\u2026 I thought you should hear it first.\u201d Femi raised an eyebrow, intrigued. He gestured to a chair. Adebayo sat, took a deep breath, and, without his guitar, sang his song, his voice a low, intimate hum in the quiet room. He sang of his daughter\u2019s first steps, of the hollow echo in an empty, expensive apartment, of the promise of a floor that would belong only to her.\n\nWhen he finished, the silence in the room was absolute. Femi stared at him, his cool, celebrity posture gone, his expression one of profound, unguarded emotion. \u201cThat song\u2026\u201d he started, his voice thick, \u201cthat is the most honest thing I have heard in ten years in this business.\u201d He leaned forward, his eyes serious. \u201cYou know they won\u2019t like it. It\u2019s not a \u2018finale\u2019 song. It\u2019s too quiet, too personal. It doesn\u2019t scream \u2018winner\u2019. It whispers \u2018truth\u2019.\u201d Adebayo nodded. \u201cI know.\u201d Femi stood up and walked to the window, looking out at the city below. \u201cThe Chief wants a product he can sell to the masses. A victory song. You give them this\u2026 you are handing the crown to Efe or Slate on a platter. You will lose the competition.\u201d He turned back to face Adebayo, a wry, sad smile on his face. \u201cBut you will win yourself back.\u201d He clapped Adebayo on the shoulder, a gesture of solidarity. \u201cMy job is to judge what I see on the stage. But as a man, Adebayo\u2026 as a man, I hope you have the courage to lose.\u201d"
