     "novel_text": "The smell was the first clue. Not the honest stink of a blocked drain, a smell Samantha knew with the kind of intimacy a chef has for garlic, but something richer, more offensive. It was the smell of old money and festering secrets, rising from the guts of the St Andrews clubhouse. She heaved her toolbox onto the pristine tartan carpet of the lobby, ignoring the pinched face of the club manager, a man whose moustache seemed to be held up by sheer indignation.\n\n\"The blockage is in the main men's locker room, I believe,\" he said, his voice a tight, reedy thing. \"It's\u2026 rather unpleasant.\"\n\n\"Aye, they usually are,\" Sam replied, her accent thick as porridge, a deliberate tool she used to put men like him on the back foot. She wore her work, the grime under her fingernails and the faint scent of copper and flux that clung to her overalls, like a declaration. I am a plumber. I fix what you break. Deal with it.\n\nShe pushed through the polished oak doors and the smell hit her full force. A tide of raw sewage had backed up through the floor drains, sullying the gleaming tiles and lapping at the mahogany lockers. A few members, men in their sixties with faces like pink, boiled hams, stood at a safe distance, their pastel Pringle jumpers a jarring splash of colour against the brown-grey filth.\n\nSam dropped to a crouch, her eyes scanning the layout, her mind already a blueprint of pipes and junctions. This was her world. Not the sweeping green fairways outside, but the dark, cramped, and vital underworld that made it all function. She could see the problem already. A catastrophic failure in the main soil stack, probably choked with things that had no business being there. Wet wipes. Golf balls. The hubris of the wealthy.\n\n\"Need a hand with that?\"\n\nThe voice came from beside her. It was quiet, without the panicked edge of the other members. She glanced over. He was young, maybe early twenties, leaning against a locker just beyond the edge of the filth. He wasn't wearing a Pringle jumper. Just a simple grey t-shirt and worn jeans. His hair was a messy thatch of dark curls, and his eyes, a startling shade of blue, held a sort of amused curiosity. He was one of the caddies, she guessed. They had a different air about them. Less entitlement, more observation.\n\n\"I'm fine,\" she grunted, pulling a heavy wrench from her box. \"Unless you fancy a paddle.\"\n\nHe chuckled, a low, pleasant sound. \"Tempting. But I think I'll leave the heroics to the professional.\" He didn't leave, though. He just watched, his arms crossed. It was unnerving. Men usually did one of two things when she was on a job: they either ignored her completely or they offered useless advice, peering over her shoulder like she was a curious roadside accident. This one just\u2026 watched.\n\nShe found the access panel and wrenched it open. A fresh wave of stench billowed out. One of the members made a gagging sound. Sam just took a deep breath through her mouth and peered into the darkness with her headlamp. \"Aye,\" she muttered to herself. \"There you are, you bastard.\" A thick, greasy clot of who-knows-what, jammed tight where the four-inch pipe met the main drain.\n\n\"Find the monster?\" the caddy asked.\n\n\"Something like that.\" She started to work, the muscles in her arms and back straining as she fought with a rusted-on joint. The clubhouse was silent now, save for her grunts and the metallic clang of her tools. The manager and his members had retreated. Only the caddy remained. After ten minutes of sweat and swearing, the joint gave way with a great groan of tortured metal. She worked quickly then, her hands sure and practiced, feeding a heavy-duty auger into the pipe. The coiled steel screeched against the cast iron, a sound that grated on the ears of anyone but her. To Sam, it was the sound of progress.\n\nFinally, with a sickening lurch, the clog broke free. A great whoosh and gurgle echoed through the pipes as the backed-up water began to drain, pulling the filth on the floor with it. A slow, brown whirlpool formed over the drains.\n\n\"Victory,\" the caddy said softly.\n\nSam sat back on her heels, wiping a smear of something vile from her cheek with the back of her gloved hand. She was sweating, her hair stuck to her forehead, and she probably smelled worse than the drain itself. She looked at him. He was still smiling, not a mocking smile, but one of genuine appreciation.\n\n\"You're very\u2026 methodical,\" he said, searching for the word. \"It's like watching someone solve a puzzle.\"\n\nNo one had ever called her work methodical before. They called it dirty, smelly, a man's job. \"It's just pipes,\" she said, starting to pack her tools, the clatter echoing in the now-draining room.\n\n\"I'm Liam,\" he said, pushing himself off the locker and extending a clean hand.\n\nShe looked at his hand, then at her own filthy, gloved one. She just nodded. \"Sam.\"\n\n\"Well, Sam,\" he said, retracting his hand without a hint of awkwardness. \"The least I can do for saving the club from drowning in its own effluent is buy you a cup of tea. Or something stronger. My shift's done.\"\n\nSam paused. She never drank with clients. She never mixed work with anything else. Her life was a series of neat, separate pipes: work, her small flat, the quiet pint by herself at The Dunvegan. They didn't cross. They weren't supposed to. But his eyes were a very clear blue, and his smile didn't seem to have any hidden angles.\n\n\"I'm not really dressed for the clubhouse bar,\" she said, gesturing to her overalls.\n\n\"God, no,\" he laughed. \"I wouldn't inflict that on you. There's a pub down the street. Full of actual human beings.\"\n\nAgainst her better judgement, a small smile touched her lips. \"Aye, alright,\" she said. \"Give me twenty minutes to pack up and talk to the man with the moustache.\"\n\nThe pub was everything the clubhouse wasn't. It was dark and loud, smelling of spilled beer and frying onions. It was real. Liam had found a small booth in the corner, and a pint of Guinness and a whisky chaser were waiting for her when she arrived, having washed her hands and face in the clubhouse's now-functional bathroom.\n\n\"A bit presumptuous,\" she said, sliding into the booth, \"but you got it right.\"\n\n\"You looked like a whisky lass,\" he said, raising his own pint. \"To a successful unblocking.\"\n\nThey drank. He asked her about plumbing. And not in the condescending way. He asked about the pressure, the physics of it, the history of the pipes under a town as old as St Andrews. He told her he was studying history at the university, that caddying paid for his books and beer. He talked about the golf course not as a series of holes and scores, but as a living landscape, sculpted by time and weather.\n\n\"You should let me take you out,\" he said, after their second pint. \"On the course, I mean. For a round.\"\n\nSam snorted into her whisky. \"You're joking. Hitting a wee ball with a stick? It's a daft way to ruin a good walk.\"\n\n\"That's what people who've never played say,\" he challenged, his eyes twinkling. \"I'll be your caddy. I'll carry your bag. I'll teach you. No charge.\"\n\n\"I don't have clubs. Or the daft clothes.\"\n\n\"We can rent clubs. And you can wear what you want. I want to show you what I see out there.\"\n\nIt was a ridiculous idea. Her, Samantha the Plumber, on the hallowed turf of the Old Course. But the whisky was warm in her belly, and the earnestness in his face was disarming. He wasn't trying to impress her. He was trying to share something. It was a feeling she wasn't used to.\n\n\"One round,\" she said, holding up a single, still-not-entirely-clean finger. \"And if I hate it, you have to come and help me flush a sewage line.\"\n\nLiam laughed, a full, open-throated laugh that made the man at the next table look over. \"You have a deal, Sam,\" he said. \"A binding contract.\"\n\nA week later, she found herself standing on the first tee of the Jubilee course, feeling more out of place than she had in the sewage-filled locker room. The sky was a vast, moody grey, the North Sea a churning line of white in the distance. The wind whipped at her jeans and pulled strands of her ponytail loose. Liam stood beside her, a bag of rented clubs on his shoulder. He'd been right. No one seemed to care that she was wearing jeans and a scruffy jumper.\n\n\"Right,\" he said, placing a ball on a tee for her. \"The goal is simple. Just hit the ball.\"\n\nHer first swing was a complete, comical miss. The second topped the ball, sending it dribbling a pathetic ten feet into the rough. She felt a hot flush of embarrassment. This was stupid. She was a plumber. She belonged in cramped, dark spaces with a wrench in her hand.\n\n\"Hey,\" Liam's voice was soft, right by her ear. He came to stand behind her, his body close but not quite touching hers. \"You're trying to kill it. Don't kill it. Just... persuade it.\" He adjusted her grip, his fingers warm over hers. \"And your shoulders are all tense. Loosen up. Breathe the sea air.\" His presence was a strange mix of calming and electrifying. She could feel the warmth of his chest near her back, smell the faint, clean scent of his laundry soap mixed with the salt of the sea.\n\nHe guided her through the motion, a slow, fluid swing. \"Like that,\" he whispered. \"Easy.\"\n\nShe stepped back to the ball, took a breath, and tried to replicate the feeling. This time, there was a solid, satisfying *thwack*. The ball soared into the air, a small white speck against the grey sky, before landing in the middle of the fairway. It wasn't a long shot, not by a golfer's standards, but to her, it was a miracle.\n\nShe turned to him, a grin spreading across her face, wide and unbidden. He was already smiling.\n\n\"See?\" he said. \"You're a natural.\"\n\nThey didn't keep score. They didn't really play by the rules. The game was an excuse. An excuse for him to walk beside her on the springy turf, pointing out the subtle dips and rises of the land, explaining how a caddy reads the unseen contours of the green. He spoke about the gorse, the tough, prickly shrub that burst into brilliant yellow in the spring, and the way the wind, the single greatest player on any links course, could turn a simple shot into an impossible challenge. He made her see it not as a manicured park, but as a wild, beautiful piece of coastline that just happened to have flags on it.\n\nAnd she, in turn, found herself talking. She told him about the satisfaction of soldering a perfect joint, of bringing water and heat back to a cold house. She described the strange archaeology of her job, pulling ancient, Victorian pipes from behind modern plasterboard. He listened. He actually listened, his blue eyes fixed on her, making her feel like the most fascinating person in the world.\n\nBy the eighteenth hole, as the light began to fade and the sky turned a soft, bruised purple, something had shifted. The carefully constructed walls around her, the separate pipes of her life, had started to corrode. Standing there, with the wind in her hair and the smell of the sea and the damp earth all around her, she felt a crack appear in her solitary world. And through that crack, a new and terrifying light was beginning to shine. It was the light from Liam\u2019s eyes. When he took the driver from her hand, his fingers brushed against hers, and this time, the contact lingered for a second too long. It was a jolt, more powerful than any mis-wired immersion heater. It was the moment she knew she was in trouble. The kind of trouble she couldn't fix with a wrench.They walked back toward the lights of the clubhouse in a comfortable quiet, the only sound the soft squelch of their shoes on the damp ground and the distant cry of a gull. The air had grown cold, and Sam found herself walking a little closer to him than was strictly necessary, as if his presence alone generated some kind of warmth. The charged moment on the green had passed, but its energy lingered between them, a low hum beneath the surface of the evening. He carried the heavy golf bag as if it were nothing, his stride easy and long, and she had to quicken her pace slightly to keep up.\n\n\"So,\" he said, as they reached the edge of the car park, the gravel crunching under their feet. \"Was it as daft as you thought?\"\n\n\"It was\u2026 less daft,\" she conceded, the words feeling inadequate. She couldn't explain that the game itself was irrelevant. What she'd remember was the way the sky looked, the feel of the wind, and the sound of his voice explaining the unseen world beneath her feet. \"I still think it's a complicated way to go for a walk.\"\n\nHe laughed, stopping by a small, beat-up hatchback that looked as out of place in the prestigious car park as she felt. \"Fair enough. I'll take 'less daft' as a roaring success.\" He dropped the golf bag into the boot with a thud and turned to face her. Under the flat, orange glare of a single lamppost, his eyes seemed darker, the blue lost to the twilight. \"I had a really good time, Sam.\"\n\n\"Aye,\" she said, her hands shoved deep in her pockets. \"Me too.\" The admission felt like a confession. This was the point where she would normally make a quick exit, a clean break. Back to her van, back to her life. But she stayed rooted to the spot, held there by the quiet intensity of his gaze.\n\n\"I don't want this to be a one-off,\" he said, his voice dropping a little. \"I'd like to see you again. Somewhere that doesn't involve sewage or golf clubs. Dinner, maybe?\"\n\nThe word hung in the air between them. Dinner. It was a proper date word. It implied tablecloths and choices and conversation that wasn't buffered by pints of Guinness or the distraction of hitting a ball. It was an escalation. The pipes in her carefully ordered life began to creak and groan under the sudden, unexpected pressure. Her first instinct, the muscle memory of a lifetime of self-preservation, was to find an excuse. Too busy. Wrong part of town. We're too different.\n\nBut she looked at his face, at the open, hopeful expression there, and the excuses died on her lips. For once, she was tired of the safety of her solitude. She was tired of knowing exactly what every day would bring. She wanted to see what would happen if she just opened the valve and let things flow. \"I'd have to wash my hair and everything,\" she said, a weak attempt at her usual deflection.\n\nA slow smile spread across his face, reaching his eyes. \"I'd appreciate that. Here.\" He pulled a crumpled receipt from his jeans pocket and borrowed a pen from his car's glovebox. He scribbled his name and number on the back, the pen scratching in the quiet of the car park. \"No pressure. But I hope you'll call.\"\n\nShe took the small piece of paper. It felt warm from his pocket. His fingers brushed hers again as she took it, and this time the jolt was expected, a familiar and yet still startling current. \"Alright, Liam,\" she said, the name feeling solid and real on her tongue. \"I will.\"\n\nThe drive home was a blur. She navigated the familiar streets of St Andrews on autopilot, her mind replaying the day in a dizzying loop of images: the green of the course, the grey of the sea, the blue of his eyes. When she let herself into her small, second-floor flat, the silence was absolute. It was usually a comforting silence, a welcome buffer against the noise of the world. Tonight, it felt empty. The air was still and smelled faintly of the fish and chips she'd had for dinner two nights ago. There was no salt, no wind, no Liam.\n\nShe dropped her keys in the bowl by the door and kicked off her muddy boots. In the bathroom mirror, her reflection looked windswept and unfamiliar. Her cheeks were flushed from the cold, her hair was a mess, and there was a smudge of dirt on her chin she'd somehow missed. But her eyes looked different. Brighter. She looked at her hands, the hands that could coax a rusted joint into submission or finesse a copper pipe into a perfect angle. They looked clumsy now, holding the flimsy piece of paper with his number on it. She smoothed it out on the side of the sink, a binding contract for a future she hadn't known she wanted until today. A future that was complicated and unpredictable and utterly terrifying. She left the receipt by the sink, a small white flag in her orderly territory, and went to run a bath, wondering if it was possible to wash away a feeling as easily as you could wash away the grime of a long day's work.For two days, the crumpled receipt sat by her bathroom sink, a constant, silent accusation. Every morning, as she brushed her teeth and scraped her hair back into its functional ponytail, her eyes would snag on it. Liam. The name was written in a quick, confident scrawl. She\u2019d go to work, wrestling with stopcocks in damp cellars and replacing washers in cramped kitchens, the physical reality of her job a welcome anchor. In those moments, with the familiar weight of a Stilson wrench in her hand and the problem clear and solvable in front of her, the receipt and the man it represented seemed like a strange dream. But then she\u2019d be back in her van, the scent of flux and builder's tea filling the cab, and the memory of his smile would surface, unbidden and disruptive. Her life, which had always felt so solid and defined, suddenly seemed full of hairline cracks.\n\nThe following day found her on her back under a leaking sink in a tiny tenement flat near the university. Water dripped with infuriating slowness onto her forehead. The residents, a trio of cheerful, chaotic students, had offered her tea and biscuits and then vanished, leaving a trail of textbooks and empty noodle packets in their wake. It was a world adjacent to Liam\u2019s, and the thought made her fumble with a compression fitting. She was used to being invisible, a functionary who came, fixed, and left. The St Andrews members ignored her out of snobbery; these students ignored her out of youthful self-absorption. Liam hadn\u2019t ignored her. He had watched, and seen. He had seen a puzzle being solved, not just a mess being cleaned. The thought was more distracting than the constant *plink, plink, plink* of water hitting her face.\n\nThat evening, she sat in her worn armchair, the television murmuring unwatched in the corner. She held the receipt in one hand and her mobile in the other. All the arguments against it paraded through her head. He was a kid. A student with a summer job who found the gritty plumber girl a charming diversion before he went back to his real life of lectures and library books. She was a novelty. She imagined the conversation with his friends: \"You'll never guess who I took for a pint, this woman who unblocked the bogs at the club!\" The thought made her stomach clench with a familiar, defensive anger. She was thirty-two years old. Her life was set. She had her work, her flat, her quiet independence. It was a fortress she had built brick by painstaking brick, and she was terrified of letting anyone near the gates, let alone inside. Tossing the receipt in the bin would be so easy. It would be a restoration of order, a plugging of a potential leak before it could cause any real damage.\n\nShe stood up and walked to the bin, her hand poised over the opening. But she didn't drop it. She thought of the eighteenth green, the purple sky, and the earnest look on his face as he talked about the gorse. He hadn\u2019t been trying to impress her; he had been trying to share something. It was the difference between talking at someone and talking with them. She had spent a decade building walls to keep people out, and in a single afternoon, he had simply walked alongside them, pointing out the view. Her solitary life was safe, yes, but it was also unchanging. The same pint at the same pub, the same takeaway on a Friday night, the same echoing quiet when she closed her front door. Suddenly, the safety of it felt less like a fortress and more like a cage. With a curse that was half frustration and half surrender, she turned from the bin and jabbed the numbers into her phone.\n\nHer heart hammered against her ribs as it rang, once, twice. She was about to hang up, her courage failing, when he answered. \"Hello?\" His voice was clear and relaxed, without the questioning tone of someone receiving a call from an unknown number. He must have saved hers. The thought sent a fresh jolt through her.\n\"It's Sam,\" she said, her own voice sounding rough and unfamiliar. \"The plumber.\"\nThere was a pause, and for a horrible second she thought she'd been right, that he was struggling to place her. But then he laughed, a warm, genuine sound that instantly eased the knot in her chest. \"Sam the Plumber! I was hoping you'd call. I was beginning to think my chat was as bad as my golf swing.\"\n\"I've seen your golf swing,\" she said, a smile creeping into her voice. \"It's not that bad.\"\n\"High praise. So, are you calling to take me up on that dinner offer, or do you have another sewage line you need help with?\"\n\"Dinner,\" she said, the word coming out more firmly than she expected. \"As long as it's not somewhere with a dress code involving tartan.\"\nHe laughed again. \"Deal. There's a little Italian place on a back street. The food's good, and the only dress code is 'wear clothes'. Would Friday at eight work for you?\"\nIt was simple. Direct. No games. She agreed, they said their goodbyes, and she ended the call. She stood in the middle of her living room, the phone still in her hand, her pulse thrumming with a potent mix of terror and elation. A binding contract. The deal had been struck. And now, she realised with a fresh wave of panic, she had absolutely nothing to wear.\n\nFriday arrived faster than a leak spreads across a new laminate floor. All day, during a tricky boiler installation that required her full concentration, her mind kept snagging on the evening ahead. She finished the job, packed her tools, and drove home feeling a nervous energy she hadn't experienced in years. In her flat, she surveyed the contents of her wardrobe with a critical eye. It was a sea of practical, durable fabrics: jeans, sturdy jumpers, flannel shirts, and a dozen work t-shirts in varying states of wear and tear. Tucked at the very back was a simple black dress she\u2019d bought for a cousin's wedding three years ago and hadn't touched since. It felt like a costume for a person she wasn't. But it was either that or her best jeans. With a sigh, she pulled out the dress. In the shower, she scrubbed at her hands, trying to banish the last of the grime from under her nails, a task she usually didn't bother with. She let her hair dry loose for once, instead of yanking it back. As she stood in front of the mirror, wearing the black dress, she felt like an imposter. This woman, with her clean hands and soft hair, didn't know the first thing about copper pipe or water pressure. This was someone else. Taking a deep, steadying breath, she grabbed her keys and her jacket. It was just dinner, she told herself. Just a conversation. It wasn't a catastrophic failure in the main soil stack. But as she walked out into the cool night air, she knew this felt infinitely more dangerous.The restaurant was called \"La Trattoria\" and was tucked down a cobbled lane that smelled of rain and garlic. It was small and crowded, the warm, noisy interior a stark contrast to the quiet chill of the evening. Every table seemed to be full of laughing students or couples leaning close over flickering candles. For a moment, Sam faltered in the doorway, the urge to turn and flee back to the safety of her van almost overwhelming. This was a world of easy intimacy, of casual connection, and she was an intruder in borrowed clothes. Then she saw him. He was at a small table in the corner, nursing a glass of red wine, his attention on the street outside. He hadn't seen her yet. He looked different here, too. Away from the wild expanse of the golf course, framed by the warm interior of the restaurant, he seemed more solid, more defined. The amused curiosity in his eyes was replaced by a quiet thoughtfulness.\n\nHe looked up then, and his face broke into the smile she was beginning to recognise, a smile that seemed to smooth out all the anxious corners of the world. He stood as she approached, his eyes doing a quick, appreciative sweep of the black dress. \"Wow,\" he said, his voice a low murmur that was just for her amidst the restaurant's clatter. \"Sam the Plumber cleans up well.\" It could have sounded glib from someone else, but from him, it was just a statement of simple, unvarnished pleasure. He pulled her chair out for her, a gesture so unexpectedly gentlemanly that she almost stumbled.\n\n\"Don't get used to it,\" she mumbled, sinking into the chair and placing her jacket on the back of it. She felt clumsy and oversized, her hands, accustomed to the heft of tools, unsure what to do on the white tablecloth. \"This dress has a very limited social calendar.\"\n\n\"Well, I'm honoured to be on it.\" The waiter arrived, and Liam ordered a bottle of the house red without consulting her, but he caught her eye as he did it. 'Is that okay?' his expression asked. She gave a tiny nod, grateful that he had taken charge, that he had spared her from having to make one more decision in this unfamiliar territory. The conversation started slowly, circling around safe topics \u2013 the town, the university, a particularly stubborn boiler she had fought with that day. But Liam, she was discovering, was a patient and skilled excavator of people. He didn't just ask questions; he listened to the answers and then asked better ones.\n\n\"So why plumbing?\" he asked, after they had ordered their food. \"It's not exactly a career they push on you at school, is it?\"\n\nSam swirled the wine in her glass, watching the dark red liquid coat the sides. \"My dad was a plumber,\" she said. It was a fact, simple and unadorned. \"He had his own business. I used to go with him on jobs during the summer holidays when I was a kid. I was small, I could get into the tight spaces he couldn't reach. I liked it.\" She paused, surprised at herself. She hadn't spoken about her father to anyone in years. \"I liked that you could see the problem right in front of you. A leak, a blockage, no heat. And at the end of the day, you'd fixed it. You'd made something work again. It was honest.\"\n\n\"He must have been proud of you, taking over the business.\"\n\nA shadow flickered across Sam's face, brief but definite. \"He died when I was nineteen. A heart attack. The business was just\u2026 gone. I was working in a call centre at the time. Hated it. A few years later, I did my apprenticeship. Started on my own.\" She took a quick sip of wine, the gesture a full stop. That was enough archaeology for one night. She didn't add the rest: the crippling debts her father had left, the struggle of being a woman in a trade that didn't want her, the fierce, lonely pride she'd felt when she finally bought her own van.\n\nLiam didn't push. He seemed to understand that she had offered him a small, fragile piece of her past and that he should handle it with care. \"An honest job,\" he said, nodding slowly. \"I get that. There's an honesty to caddying, too. The course doesn't care who you are or how much money you have. The wind blows the same on everyone. You have to respect it. You have to read what's there, not what you want to be there.\" He looked at her, his blue eyes serious. \"It's a bit like you in that locker room. You weren't panicking about the mess. you were just reading the problem.\"\n\nThe food arrived, steaming plates of pasta that smelled divine, and the intensity of the moment broke. They ate, and he made her laugh, telling her stories about the absurdly wealthy American tourists he caddied for, mimicking their accents and their outrage when a perfectly hit shot was gusted into a pot bunker by the unpredictable Scottish wind. He talked about his studies, about the thrill of holding a 500-year-old document in the university's special collections, feeling the direct, physical link to the past. He made history sound not like a collection of dusty dates, but like a series of overlapping stories, just like the pipes under the town. He wasn't just a student; he was a storyteller. And as she listened, she felt the rigid posture she'd walked in with begin to soften. The black dress felt less like a costume and more like a choice she had made.\n\nAfter they had finished their meal and he had insisted on paying, they stepped back out into the night. The lane was quieter now, the air damp and smelling of the nearby sea. \"Can I walk you home?\" he asked. It wasn't a question of safety; St Andrews was not that kind of town. It was a simple request to prolong their time together. She found herself nodding before she had even thought about it. They walked in a comfortable silence at first, their footsteps echoing on the ancient stones. He didn't take her hand, but his arm brushed against hers as they navigated the narrow pavement, and the contact was a low, steady current running through her.\n\nThey emerged onto a wider street that overlooked the sea. The tide was out, and the vast expanse of the West Sands stretched out under a sliver of moon, the distant waves a rhythmic shushing sound. They stopped, leaning against the old stone wall that separated the town from the beach. \"I still can't believe you'd never been on the course,\" he said, looking out at the dark silhouette of the clubhouse in the distance. \"Living here your whole life.\"\n\n\"My world was under the course, not on it,\" she replied, turning to look at him. In the faint moonlight, the planes of his face were softer, his expression unreadable. \"We're from different sides of the wall, you and me.\"\n\n\"It's the same wall, though,\" he said, turning to face her fully. He was closer now, close enough that she could feel the warmth radiating from him, could see the slight curl of his eyelashes. \"We're just looking at it from different directions.\" He raised a hand, and for a second, she thought he was going to touch her cheek. Her entire body tensed, bracing for an impact she wasn't sure she could withstand. But his hand went to a stray piece of her hair that the wind had whipped across her face, gently tucking it behind her ear. His fingers were warm against her skin, and the simple, tender gesture did more to dismantle her defences than a battering ram ever could. Her breath caught in her throat.\n\n\"Sam,\" he whispered, and her name on his lips was both a question and a statement. He leaned in slowly, giving her every opportunity to pull away, to rebuild the wall. She didn't. Her eyes fluttered shut, and then his lips were on hers. It wasn't a forceful kiss. It was soft, questioning at first, then deepening as she responded, a silent and astonishing communication. It was the taste of red wine and the cold, salt tang of the sea. It was the yielding of a rusted-on joint, the terrifying, exhilarating release of pressure that had been building for a lifetime. When he finally pulled back, they were both breathless. He rested his forehead against hers, his thumbs stroking her arms.\n\n\"So much for different sides of the wall,\" he murmured, his voice husky.\n\nSam couldn't speak. She could only feel the thrumming in her blood, the echo of the kiss on her lips, and the catastrophic, wonderful, terrifying realisation that the foundations of her carefully built, solitary world had just been irrevocably shaken. This wasn't a leak. This was a flood.The walk back to her flat was a disorienting journey through familiar streets that no longer felt entirely her own. She was acutely aware of the cold air on her lips, the lingering warmth where his forehead had rested against hers, the ghost of his touch on her arm. When she finally closed her front door behind her, the silence of her flat was different. It wasn't the comfortable, restorative quiet she was used to; it was a hollow, ringing silence, amplifying the frantic thrumming of her own pulse. She leaned against the door, her eyes closed, feeling the solid wood against her back as she tried to anchor herself. But the world had tilted on its axis, and she was adrift in the strange new gravity of his kiss. She didn't sleep well. Her mind, usually a clean blueprint of the next day's work, was a chaotic jumble of sensations: the taste of wine, the sound of the sea, the startling blue of his eyes in the moonlight.\n\nThe next morning, the shrill alarm felt like an assault. She swung her legs out of bed and the cold floorboards on her bare feet were a familiar, grounding shock. In the bathroom, she caught her reflection and paused. She looked the same\u2014her hair a tangled mess, sleep still clouding her eyes\u2014but something was different. A vulnerability lingered around her mouth. The woman in the mirror looked like she had a secret. Beside the sink, the crumpled receipt from the pub lay where she\u2019d left it, a relic from a different era. An era before the flood. She picked it up, smoothed it out one last time, and then, with a decisive finality, she folded it neatly and tucked it into the pocket of a clean pair of jeans. It was no longer an accusation; it was evidence.\n\nWork was a bathroom installation in a new-build house on the edge of town. It should have been a straightforward job: clean pipes, modern fittings, easy access. It was the kind of work she could usually do on autopilot, her hands moving with an intelligence of their own. But today, her focus was shot. Her mind kept drifting from pipe diameters to the exact cadence of his laugh. While soldering a joint on a copper feed to the new shower, her concentration lapsed for a fraction of a second. A blob of molten solder dripped and hissed on the floorboard, narrowly missing her boot. She swore, snatching her hand back, the smell of burnt flux filling the air. It was a rookie mistake, a lapse she hadn't made in years. She was a professional. She fixed what was broken. But now, she felt like a collection of loose fittings, rattling around with no clear purpose, a system on the verge of a critical failure. The job took her two hours longer than it should have, her frustration mounting with every misplaced washer and overtightened nut.\n\nShe was packing her tools away, her body aching with a weariness that was more mental than physical, when her phone buzzed in her pocket. She pulled it out, her heart giving a stupid, traitorous leap when she saw the unknown number. But it wasn't a number; it was a name. *Liam*. He must have saved her number when she called. The thought sent another unexpected current through her. With a greasy thumb, she opened the text. *Hope you made it back okay. The sea wall is my new favourite spot in town.* It was simple, light. It didn't demand anything. But the reference to their shared moment, to the place where he had kissed her, was as direct as a plumb line. Her mind raced. What was the protocol for this? What did you say the day after your carefully ordered world had been turned upside down by a student caddy with kind eyes?\n\nHer first instinct was to ignore it. To leave him waiting, to reclaim some of the power she felt she had lost. It was the safe move, the one that kept her behind the wall. She could retreat into the familiar silence, and eventually, the memory would fade, becoming just another strange story to file away. But the thought of that silence, which had been her comfort for so long, now felt like a punishment. She thought of his laugh in the pub, the intent look on his face as he explained the history of a patch of grass, the gentle way he\u2019d tucked her hair behind her ear. He wasn't a threat to be managed; he was an offer being made. She typed a reply, deleted it. Typed another. Too keen. Deleted. Finally, she settled on something that felt like her. It was gruff, a little defensive, but it was an answer. It was an open valve.\n\n*Aye, I got back. Don't go getting sentimental about a wall. It's just stones.*\n\nShe hit send before she could second-guess it, her thumb hovering over the screen. It felt like cutting a live pipe\u2014risky, unpredictable, with a high chance of making a mess. A minute later, her phone buzzed again. Her breath hitched.\n\n*You're right. It's the company that makes the spot. When can I see you again?*\n\nHis directness was a counterpunch to her deflection, cutting straight through her practiced defenses. It left her with nowhere to hide. A slow smile spread across her face, a genuine, unforced thing that made her tired eyes crinkle at the corners. She was in trouble. The kind of trouble she couldn't fix with a wrench. And for the first time in a very long time, she didn't want to fix it. She wanted to see how bad the leak would get.Leaning against the side of her van, the metal cool against her back, Sam stared at his last message. *When can I see you again?* It was a question that bypassed all her carefully laid tripwires and went straight for the main fuse box. There was no ambiguity, no room for misinterpretation or tactical retreat. She felt the corner of her own mouth lift in a reluctant smile. He fought fair, she had to give him that. Her thumbs, usually so sure and steady as they tightened a compression nut, felt clumsy on the tiny screen. She thought about her schedule, a mental ledger of boilers, sinks, and radiators. It was her shield and her excuse.\n\n*Working Saturday. A kitchen fit. All day.*\n\nIt was a test, and she knew it. It was a statement of fact that doubled as a challenge: This is my life. It isn't pretty or convenient. Take it or leave it. She sent the message and immediately felt a pang of regret, a cold dread that she had finally pushed too far, that she had presented a wall so high and uninviting he would simply turn and walk away. The three dots that signalled he was typing appeared and disappeared twice. Then, the reply came through, and it wasn't what she expected at all.\n\n*Perfect. I'll bring lunch. Text me the address. Don't work too hard.*\n\nThe simple, unhesitating acceptance of her reality did more to disarm her than any romantic proclamation could have. He wasn't trying to pull her into his world of manicured greens and ancient libraries; he was offering to step into hers, with sandwiches. A wave of something warm and unfamiliar washed through her, unsettling the deep, cold quiet she usually carried within herself. She typed out the address of a small bungalow in a quiet residential street and added, *Don't bring anything with pesto in it.* It was the closest she could get to saying thank you.\n\nSaturday's job was for a Mrs Baird, a woman in her late eighties whose wit was sharper than any of Sam's pipe cutters. Sam had been looking after her plumbing for years, drawn in by the old woman's fierce independence and the endless supply of surprisingly good biscuits. The job was a full kitchen sink and tap replacement, a straightforward task of isolating the water, wrestling with the old fittings, and bedding in the new stainless steel unit with a satisfying bead of silicone. Sam worked with a focused rhythm, the familiar motions a balm to her frazzled nerves. As she lay on her back under the cabinet, tightening the final connection on the hot-water feed, Mrs Baird appeared in the doorway, leaning on her walker.\n\n\"You're very quiet today, Samantha,\" she observed. \"Not nearly enough cursing at those old pipes. Are you feeling alright, dear?\"\n\n\"Just concentrating, Mrs B,\" Sam grunted, giving the nut a final, firm twist. \"Don't want to flood your lovely new floor.\"\n\n\"Nonsense. A bit of drama is good for the heart,\" the old woman said, her eyes twinkling. \"Is that young man of yours bringing you a proper lunch? A working girl needs her sustenance.\"\n\nSam froze, the wrench slipping in her hand. \"He's not my 'young man'. He's just\u2026 a lad. Bringing sandwiches.\"\n\n\"A lad who brings a plumber sandwiches is a lad worth keeping an eye on,\" Mrs Baird said sagely, just as the doorbell chimed. \"And there he is. Perfect timing. Do try to wash the sealant off your hands before you eat, dear. It's terribly unladylike.\"\n\nLiam stood on the doorstep, holding a paper bag that smelled deliciously of fresh bread and sausage rolls. He wore the same easy smile, his blue eyes crinkling in the bright sunlight. He didn't seem fazed at all to be standing at the scene of a half-finished plumbing job. Mrs Baird immediately took him in, her shrewd gaze assessing him from head to toe before a slow, approving smile spread across her face. Within minutes, Liam had been charmed into carrying a tray of tea and biscuits out to the small, sun-drenched patio in the back garden, while Sam scrubbed her hands raw at the newly-functional sink. They ate their lunch sitting on the patio steps, the scent of Mrs Baird's roses mingling with the smell of sawdust. He\u2019d brought a flask of hot, sweet tea, just the way she liked it.\n\n\"So this is a day in the life,\" he said, taking a bite of a sausage roll. \"It's\u2026 quieter than I imagined.\"\n\n\"They're not all sewage explosions,\" she admitted, feeling a strange need for him to understand. \"Most of it is just this. Making things work. Giving an old lady hot water for her dishes.\"\n\n\"That's not 'just this',\" he said, his expression serious. \"That's important. It's the stuff life is actually made of.\" He looked around the tidy garden, then back at her, her overalls smeared with dust and a smudge of silicone on her cheek. \"You're good at it. You're good at making things right.\"\n\nWhen the job was done and Mrs Baird had paid her, pressing an extra twenty-pound note into Sam\u2019s hand for \"a trip to the pictures with that lovely boy,\" Sam felt a pang of her usual end-of-day melancholy. This was normally the point where she would retreat into the solitary cocoon of her van and her empty flat. But Liam was still there, leaning against her van, waiting. He had helped her carry the old, heavy ceramic sink out to the driveway without a word of complaint. The simple act of sharing the load, of him taking one side and her the other, felt more intimate than their kiss.\n\n\"Right,\" she said, slamming the van's back doors shut. \"Thanks for the lunch.\" It was a dismissal, the automatic raising of the drawbridge.\n\n\"You're exhausted,\" he stated, ignoring her tone. \"And I'm not letting you go home to an empty flat and a microwave meal. Let's go back to yours, and I'll make you a proper cup of tea. A non-flask-based one.\"\n\nThe suggestion hung in the air. Her flat. Her sanctuary. No client had ever been to her flat. No man had been inside it in over five years. It was the one place that was entirely and exclusively hers, a fortress of solitude and order. The thought of him in her space, in her kitchen, sitting on her sofa, sent a wave of pure panic through her. It was too much, too soon. But then she looked at his face, the genuine concern in his eyes, and the thought of the echoing silence that awaited her at home seemed infinitely more terrifying.\n\n\"I've only got one mug that isn't chipped,\" she said, the words a white flag of surrender.\n\nHe just smiled. \"I'll take my chances.\"\n\nThe journey to her flat was short and silent. She drove, hyper-aware of him in the passenger seat of her cluttered van, a clean, calm presence amidst the chaos of her work life. Standing outside her own front door, key in hand, she hesitated. This was the final barrier. Once she turned this lock, there was no going back. She could feel him waiting patiently behind her, not crowding her, giving her the space to make the choice. With a deep breath that did little to calm the frantic hammering in her chest, she unlocked the door and pushed it open. \"It's not much,\" she said, the apology instinctive.\n\nHe stepped inside and looked around, his gaze taking in the small, obsessively neat living room. There was a single, well-worn armchair, a small sofa, and a bookshelf filled not with novels, but with technical manuals and catalogues, all arranged by size. On the windowsill, a lone succulent stood in a simple pot, green and thriving. He didn't see a lack of decoration or personality. He saw her.\n\n\"It's quiet,\" he said, his voice soft. \"And clean. It's a good place.\" He walked over to the bookshelf and ran a finger over the spines of the manuals. \"It's like your workshop.\" Then he turned to her, his eyes full of a soft understanding that made her throat tighten. \"Can I use your kitchen?\"\n\nShe watched, stunned into silence, as he moved around her small kitchen as if he belonged there, filling her kettle, finding the tea bags, rinsing out the two mugs she pointed to. It was a simple, domestic ballet, and it felt more profound than any grand, romantic gesture. She sank onto her sofa, her limbs heavy with the day's labour, and watched him. When he brought the tea over, he didn't sit in the armchair opposite her. He sat on the sofa, leaving a respectable distance, but still sharing the same space. The silence that settled between them wasn't empty. It was filled with the hum of the refrigerator, the distant sound of traffic, and the quiet, revolutionary presence of another person. She felt the tension she carried perpetually in her shoulders begin to dissolve, draining away like water down an unblocked pipe.\n\nShe must have dozed off, her head eventually lolling to rest against the back of the sofa, because the next thing she knew, the light outside had softened to the orange glow of late afternoon. She blinked, disoriented, and realised Liam hadn't moved. He was just sitting there, reading one of her boiler installation manuals, a small smile on his face. He looked up and saw she was awake.\n\n\"Fascinating stuff, the legal requirements for flue positioning,\" he said, his voice a low, gentle rumble. He hadn't woken her. He had simply let her rest. He had guarded her sleep. She looked at him, truly looked at him, sitting on her sofa, in her flat, in the heart of her life. The panic was gone. In its place was a quiet, terrifying, and overwhelming sense of rightness. The flood had come, it had breached every wall and washed through every room, and she had not drowned. She was floating.She swam up from the depths of a dreamless sleep, the way a diver ascends slowly towards the light. The first thing she registered was the lack of an alarm blaring in her ear. The second was the quiet weight of a day\u2019s exhaustion still settled in her bones, a familiar ache that was somehow less sharp than usual. She blinked, her vision focusing on the familiar cracks in her own ceiling, and then memory came rushing back, not with a jolt, but with the quiet click of a well-seated valve. Liam. He was here. In her flat. Her head turned on the sofa cushion, and there he was, bathed in the soft, forgiving light of the late afternoon, looking utterly at home with a schematic diagram of a combination boiler.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a closed-loop system,\u201d she said, her voice thick with sleep. \u201cThe pressure needs to be between one and one-point-five bar when the system is cold.\u201d\n\nHe looked up from the manual, his mouth quirking into a smile that reached the startling blue of his eyes. There was no surprise, no awkwardness. He simply closed the manual and placed it carefully back on the coffee table. \u201cI think I was just getting to that part,\u201d he said. \u201cYou were out for a good hour. You must have been knackered.\u201d\n\n\u201cLong day,\u201d she mumbled, pushing herself into a sitting position. Her hair was a disaster, and she felt a flush of self-consciousness that was entirely new to her. She, Samantha the Plumber, who had faced down raw sewage and irate club managers without batting an eye, was flustered because a man had seen her sleep. \u201cYou should have woken me.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d he asked, his expression one of genuine curiosity. \u201cYou needed the rest. Besides, I was getting an education.\u201d He gestured to the bookshelf. \u201cIt\u2019s a whole secret language. Flow and return, heat exchangers, diverter valves. It\u2019s fascinating.\u201d\n\nNo one had ever called her work fascinating. Necessary, messy, complicated\u2014but never fascinating. She stood up, needing to move, to do something with the restless energy that was fizzing under her skin. \u201cRight. Well. Tea\u2019s probably cold.\u201d The thought of him leaving now, of the door closing and the silence rushing back in to fill the space he occupied, sent a surprising and unwelcome pang of something that felt dangerously like loneliness through her.\n\n\u201cI was thinking something more substantial than tea,\u201d he said, getting to his feet. He stretched, a lithe, easy movement that made her small living room feel even smaller. \u201cWhat\u2019s the situation in your fridge? I\u2019m a decent cook, but I can\u2019t work miracles.\u201d\n\nThe idea of him cooking in her kitchen, using her pans, was a level of intrusion she couldn\u2019t have imagined tolerating just yesterday. Her kitchen was a functional space for assembling sandwiches and brewing tea, not a place for creation. \u201cThe situation is dire,\u201d she admitted. \u201cThere\u2019s eggs. Some cheese that might be old enough to vote. A tin of beans.\u201d\n\nHe laughed, a full, open sound that seemed to warm the whole room. \u201cEggs and cheese it is. The best omelettes are born from desperation.\u201d He moved towards her kitchen, then paused and looked back at her. \u201cUnless you want me to go?\u201d His sensitivity was a constant surprise, a soft touch on the bruised and calloused parts of her. He was always giving her an out, a clean line of retreat. And for the first time, she had no desire to take it.\n\n\u201cKnock yourself out,\u201d she said, gesturing towards the kitchen with a wave of her hand. \u201cBut if you give me food poisoning, you\u2019re fixing the toilet for free.\u201d\n\nShe watched from the doorway as he navigated the small space with an easy confidence. He found a pan, cracked eggs with one hand, and grated the questionable cheese with a practiced efficiency. It was a simple act, but watching him create sustenance in the heart of her fortress was profoundly intimate. They didn\u2019t talk much. The kitchen was filled with the sizzle of the eggs, the scrape of a spatula, and the quiet sound of two people learning to share a space. He served the omelettes on her two non-chipped plates, and they ate sitting on the sofa, their knees almost touching. It was the best thing she\u2019d eaten all week.\n\nAfter they\u2019d finished, and he had insisted on washing the plates, she found herself talking, the words flowing more easily than they had in years. She told him about Mrs Baird and her surprisingly good biscuits. He told her about his dissertation on the medieval trade routes that had made St Andrews a major port, long before golf was ever imagined. They discovered a shared fascination for the hidden histories of things\u2014the story told by an ancient pipe joint, the tale revealed by a faded ship\u2019s manifest. They were from different worlds, but they were both archaeologists of a sort, digging beneath the surface to understand how things worked.\n\nAs the evening drew in, a comfortable quiet settled over them again. The sky outside the window deepened from bruised purple to inky black. The small lamp in the corner of the room cast a warm, golden glow, making the space feel like a haven against the world. He was sitting at the other end of the sofa, but the space between them no longer felt like a distance to be maintained; it felt like a connection, a tangible line of energy.\n\n\u201cI should go,\u201d he said eventually, though he made no move to stand. \u201cYou\u2019ve got work in the morning.\u201d\n\n\u201cAye,\u201d she said, her voice quiet. The thought of the morning, of the van and the tools and the solitary routine, seemed a world away. He stood up, and she did too, feeling an instinctive pull to keep him there, to stop the moment from ending. They stood by the door, the same way they had stood at the restaurant, but the air between them was different now. The frantic, questioning energy had been replaced by a low, humming certainty.\n\n\u201cI had a really good day, Sam,\u201d he said, his voice low.\n\n\u201cYou made me an omelette and read a boiler manual,\u201d she countered, her default sarcasm a flimsy shield.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d he smiled, a slow, soft smile. \u201cI did. It was one of the best days I\u2019ve had in a long time.\u201d He reached out, not to kiss her, but to gently take her hand. His fingers were long and warm, and they laced through hers with a comfortable familiarity, as if they had done it a hundred times before. He looked down at their joined hands\u2014his, smooth and clean; hers, still bearing the faint lines of ingrained dirt and the small, pale scars of her trade. He lifted her hand and pressed a soft kiss to her knuckles, a gesture of such unexpected tenderness it stole the air from her lungs.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll call you,\u201d he said, his eyes holding hers. It wasn\u2019t a promise to be vetted or a line to be tested; it was a simple statement of intent. He let go of her hand, opened the door, and was gone, leaving her in the quiet of her flat. She locked the door and leaned against it, her hand still tingling from his touch. The silence that filled the room was not empty. It was alive, humming with the echo of his laugh, the memory of his presence. The fortress hadn't just been breached; its resident had willingly left the gate standing wide open. And she realised, with a clarity that was both terrifying and exhilarating, that she had no intention of ever locking it again.The weeks that followed were a process of slow, careful acclimation, like a heating system coming online for the first time in winter. There were groans and creaks, unfamiliar noises in the quiet architecture of her life, but gradually, a steady warmth began to spread through rooms she hadn't realised were so cold. The silence in her flat was no longer a void but a space of anticipation, charged with the possibility of a text message or the sound of his footsteps on the stairs. Her life, once a series of straight, unconnected pipes, was becoming a complex and interwoven system, and Liam was the unexpected junction box at its centre.\n\nShe found herself thinking of him at odd moments during the day. While wrestling with a seized stopcock in a damp cellar, she would remember the look on his face as he\u2019d concentrated on her boiler manual and a small, private smile would touch her lips. The world, which she had always viewed in the practical, monochrome tones of a technical drawing, seemed to have acquired new shades of colour. The grey of the North Sea now held hints of blue and silver; the moody sky was a canvas of purple and slate. It was the same world, but she was seeing it through a different lens.\n\nOne afternoon, a text arrived as she was packing up her tools after replacing a radiator in a cramped student flat. The room was a chaotic testament to youthful living\u2014piles of clothes, teetering stacks of books, and half-eaten packets of biscuits that would have made Mrs Baird weep. A few years ago, the mess would have irritated her. Now, it just made her think of Liam. The text was simple: *Come to my other office. I want to show you something.* It was followed by a location pin for the main university library. Her first instinct was a visceral 'no'. The library was the heart of a world that wasn't hers, a hushed temple of intellect where she, with her grease-stained hands and steel-toed boots, would be an unwelcome pagan. But the reflexive fear was weaker now, overlaid by a current of curiosity that was stronger and more compelling.\n\nShe met him outside, feeling deeply conspicuous in her work clothes. He, on the other hand, looked perfectly at home, leaning against the ancient stone archway with a book under his arm. He didn't seem to notice or care about her overalls; he just smiled, took her hand, and led her inside. The change in atmosphere was instantaneous. The air was cool and still, smelling of old paper, floor polish, and a faint, scholarly dust. The silence was a living thing, broken only by the soft rustle of turning pages and the distant cough of a student. Her work boots, which crunched so satisfyingly on gravel, felt clumsy and loud on the polished stone floor, even though they made no sound. She was a wrench in a room full of delicate instruments.\n\nLiam led her away from the main reading room, down a quiet corridor and through a door marked 'Special Collections'. Here, the silence was even more profound. He spoke in a low whisper to a librarian, who nodded and led them to a heavy wooden table. A few moments later, the librarian returned carrying a large, flat archival box. Liam\u2019s eyes lit up with a passion Sam was beginning to recognise\u2014the same passion she felt when she finally sourced a rare part for a vintage boiler. He opened the box with a reverence that was almost religious. Inside, resting on a bed of acid-free foam, was a sheet of thick, yellowed parchment covered in elegant, looping script.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a charter from 1483,\u201d he whispered, his voice full of awe. \u201cGranting trading rights for wool and salt fish to the merchants of the town.\u201d He pointed with a careful finger, not quite touching the surface. \u201cThis is the royal seal. Look at the detail. You can almost see the fingerprint of the man who pressed it into the wax over five hundred years ago.\u201d He brought her closer, showing her the way the iron gall ink had bitten into the fibres of the parchment, the slight imperfections in the lettering. She looked from the ancient document to his face, and saw that for him, this wasn't just old paper. It was a direct line, a physical connection to the past, as real and solid as a copper pipe.\n\n\"It's like the archaeology of the job,\" she said, her own voice a low murmur. \"Sometimes you have to cut through a modern wall and you find the original Victorian leadwork behind it. It's colder, heavier. You can feel the time in it, the hands that shaped it.\" A look of profound understanding passed between them. In that quiet, hallowed room, surrounded by the ghosts of scholars, the plumber and the historian had found their common language. He hadn't just brought her to his world; he had shown her how it connected to hers.\n\nTheir relationship settled into a rhythm. She would join him for a late-night coffee in a student caf\u00e9 after a long job, the smell of solder on her clothes mingling with the aroma of espresso. He would turn up at her flat with fish and chips on a Friday, seemingly unfazed by the fact that she often had to spend the first twenty minutes of their evening on the phone, talking another tradesman through a pressure-loss problem. He learned the difference between a Stilson and a mole wrench; she learned the difference between the Plantagenets and the Tudors. He never questioned the long hours of her work, and she never mocked the arcane focus of his. Their lives, which had seemed so different, were both about understanding the hidden systems that lay beneath the surface of things.\n\nOne bright, windy Saturday, they walked along the West Sands, the tide far out, the beach a vast, empty canvas. A group of young people, laughing and shouting to each other over the wind, spotted Liam and jogged over. They were his friends from his history course, bright and articulate and effervescent with the easy confidence of youth. They were friendly enough to Sam, but their conversation was a rapid-fire volley of shared references to lectures, parties, and people she didn\u2019t know. She stood slightly outside their circle, her hands jammed in her pockets, suddenly feeling every one of her thirty-two years. She felt the scuffs on her boots, the faint lines around her eyes, the invisible weight of a life lived outside the warm, protected bubble of academia. She was Sam the Plumber, an interesting diversion, a story Liam might tell later. The old, familiar chill of the outsider crept over her.\n\nWhen the group finally moved on, calling out cheerful goodbyes, Sam was quiet, her gaze fixed on the distant horizon. Liam took her hand, his thumb stroking the back of it, but she didn't respond. He didn't press her, just walked beside her in the renewed quiet, the only sound the wind and the distant gulls. The easy comfort that had grown between them felt fragile again, threatened by the cold reality of their differences. Back in the warmth of her flat, as she mechanically made them both tea, he leaned against the kitchen counter and watched her.\n\n\u201cYou went somewhere else back there,\u201d he said, his voice gentle. \u201cOn the beach.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust tired,\u201d she said, her stock answer.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t do that,\u201d he said, his tone still soft but firm. \u201cDon\u2019t shut me out. Was it my friends?\u201d She didn't answer, just kept her back to him, busying herself with the kettle. He came to stand behind her, his presence warm and solid. \u201cSam. Talk to me.\u201d\n\nWith a sigh, she turned around, leaning back against the counter. \u201cThey\u2019re kids, Liam. They talk about things I don't know anything about. I\u2019m a decade older than them and I spend my days with my arm down a U-bend. We\u2019re not from the same planet.\u201d The words came out with a raw, bitter edge she hadn't intended.\n\nHe listened, his expression serious. He didn\u2019t offer platitudes or denials. He just nodded, accepting her words, her fear. \u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d he said, and the simple agreement surprised her. \u201cWe\u2019re not from the same planet. But I don\u2019t want to live on their planet. I want to live on the one where you know how to fix things that are broken, and you can see the history in an old pipe, and you have the quietest, most peaceful flat in all of St Andrews.\u201d He reached out and tucked a strand of hair behind her ear, his touch as gentle and certain as it had been on the sea wall. \u201cThey\u2019re my friends. You\u2019re my home.\u201d\n\nThe word hung in the air between them, more solid and real than any charter, more binding than any contract. *Home*. It was a word she had only ever associated with a place, with bricks and mortar. He used it to mean a person. He used it to mean her. The last of her internal walls didn\u2019t just crack; it turned to dust. She stepped forward, into the space he had been holding open for her all along, and wrapped her arms around him, burying her face in the warm fabric of his jumper. He held her tight, a silent, steadying pressure. This wasn't a flood anymore. This was the shore.The embrace lingered, a long, silent conversation that said more than words ever could. For Sam, it was like the slow setting of a bone, a painful alignment that finally clicked into place, promising a future of strength instead of a lifetime of compensating for an old break. When they finally separated, the air in the small flat had changed. It was no longer her solitary space, defended against intrusion; it was a shared territory, the lamplight pooling around them in a circle of warmth. He didn't leave. The unspoken question of his departure hung in the air for a moment before dissolving, an irrelevance. He would stay. It was a fact as solid and unadorned as the cast-iron pipes she worked with every day.\n\nShe gave him the spare pillow and a thick wool blanket, and he took the sofa without question or comment. The quiet choreography of preparing for the night in the same small space was a new and unnervingly domestic dance. As she lay in her own bed, the door left slightly ajar, the unfamiliar sound of another person's breathing in the next room was not the threat she would have once imagined. It was a steadying rhythm, a quiet anchor in the dark. It was the sound of not being alone. For the first time in as long as she could remember, she fell asleep without the weight of her own solitary vigilance pressing down on her.\n\nShe woke before dawn, her internal clock set to a plumber\u2019s early start. The flat was shrouded in a pre-dawn grey, and for a moment, everything felt normal. Then she saw him, a long shape under the blanket on her sofa, his dark curls a chaotic spill against her plain pillow. A wave of panic, a ghost of her old self-preservation, flickered in her chest and then died out, starved of the fear that had once sustained it. In its place was a quiet, profound sense of rightness. She moved into the kitchen, her bare feet silent on the lino, and began the familiar ritual of making coffee. But this morning, she took down two mugs. The second one, a novelty mug with a faded cartoon sheep on it left by a previous tenant, had sat at the back of the cupboard for years. Placing it on the counter next to her own chipped favourite felt like a landmark decision.\n\nHe stirred as the coffee was brewing, woken by the aroma. He padded into the kitchen, his hair an even wilder mess than usual, and scrubbed a hand over his face. \"Morning,\" he mumbled, his voice gravelly with sleep. He looked around her kitchen as if seeing it for the first time in the clear morning light. \"Morning,\" she replied, her voice softer than she intended. She pushed the cartoon sheep mug towards him. He looked at it, then at her, and a slow, sleepy smile spread across his face. He understood the gesture, the offering. They drank their coffee in a comfortable silence, the rising sun casting long shadows across the floor. It felt less like the morning after and more like the first morning.\n\n\"Big day today,\" he said, staring into his mug. \"I've got to hand in the first full draft of my dissertation. My supervisor is a demon for deadlines.\" He sighed, a gust of tired, academic stress. \"Another three weeks of this and then... freedom.\" The word hung in the air, full of promise for him and loaded with a sudden, sharp ambiguity for her. Freedom. She looked at him, at the way the morning light caught the blue of his eyes, at how perfectly he seemed to fit in her small kitchen, and a cold knot of a familiar fear began to form in her stomach. Freedom from what? From St Andrews? From the caddying job that had brought him to her? From her? The warmth of the last twelve hours suddenly felt fragile, threatened by the simple, unavoidable fact that his life here had a finish line, and hers did not. She had just found her home, and now she was faced with the terrifying possibility that it was built on a temporary lease.\n\nHer phone buzzed on the counter, a shrill, demanding sound that broke the moment. She glanced at the screen, her professional mask slipping back into place with practiced ease. It was the club manager, the man with the moustache held up by indignation. Her heart didn't sink at the thought of another job; instead, a strange sense of resolve settled over her. This was her world, her reality, the part of her life that was permanent and real. She answered, her voice all business. \"Sam here.\" She listened for a moment, her brow furrowed in concentration. \"Aye. No, a pressure drop that fast isn't a leak, it's a rupture. It'll be in the boiler room, in the main heating circuit for the east wing. I can be there in an hour.\" She ended the call and looked at Liam. He was watching her, his head tilted, an expression of admiration on his face. In his eyes, she wasn't just a plumber; she was a diagnostician, a problem-solver, a commander taking charge. And in that moment, she knew she wouldn't face this new uncertainty by building her walls back up. She would face it by letting him see. \"Fancy another trip to the clubhouse?\" she asked, a challenge in her voice. \"The guts of the place have sprung a leak.\"A small, genuine smile touched Liam\u2019s lips, wiping away the last traces of sleep and academic stress. There was no hesitation, no hint of a thought for his precious dissertation draft. \u201cOf course,\u201d he said, as if she had just offered him a second cup of coffee. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t miss it. I\u2019m becoming quite the connoisseur of clubhouse disasters.\u201d The ease of his acceptance, the simple fact that he saw it as an opportunity to be with her rather than an interruption, settled something deep in her chest. The cold knot of fear about his departure didn\u2019t vanish, but it loosened its grip, overshadowed by the immediate reality of his presence.\n\nThe journey in the van was a world away from the silent, solitary trips that defined her working life. Liam sat in the passenger seat, a calm presence amidst the organised chaos of her tools and spare parts, his long legs navigating the cluttered footwell with an uncomplaining grace. He didn't pepper her with questions or offer pointless observations about the traffic. Instead, he just watched the familiar streets of St Andrews slide by, occasionally asking about a particular building, his historian\u2019s curiosity piqued by the different layers of architecture. He was learning her town, not as a tourist or a student, but through her eyes, from the driver's seat of her van. The clubhouse, once the intimidating symbol of a world she observed from the outside, now felt like just another job site, albeit one that held the strange, unlikely origin story of them.\n\nThe scene at the clubhouse was one of barely suppressed panic, a distinct flavour from the sewage incident. There was no foul odour this time, but the air in the lobby was thick with humidity and a sharp, mineral smell of hot, escaped water. A fine mist seemed to cling to the polished wood and tartan carpets, and the pinched-faced manager was now a shade of pale grey that clashed with his mustard-coloured jumper. He was pacing near the main doors, his moustache twitching with agitation, and a low, ominous hissing sound echoed from the corridor that led to the east wing. A few staff members scurried about with buckets and mops, their efforts comically inadequate against the scale of the problem.\n\n\u201cThank God you\u2019re here,\u201d the manager bleated, rushing towards her. \u201cIt\u2019s a deluge! The heating\u2026 it just\u2026 exploded, I think. There\u2019s steam everywhere.\u201d His eyes flickered towards Liam, a flicker of dismissive confusion in his gaze. Sam didn\u2019t give him a chance to ask. \u201cHe\u2019s with me,\u201d she stated, her tone flat and non-negotiable. She heaved her main toolbox onto the floor, the heavy thud cutting through the manager\u2019s frantic energy. \u201cBoiler room?\u201d The manager nodded mutely, pointing a trembling finger down the corridor. \u201cRight. Stay here. Keep everyone out. And turn off the mains water stopcock for the building. Now.\u201d Her voice was pure command, crisp and clear, and the manager, for all his bluster, obeyed without question, scurrying off like a startled rabbit. She looked at Liam, her expression all business. \u201cStay behind me. Don't touch anything metal. And if I tell you to get out, you get out. No arguments.\u201d He just nodded, his eyes serious, his trust in her absolute.\n\nThe corridor was like a tropical rainforest, steam billowing from under a door at the far end, the walls slick with condensation. The hissing grew to a roar as she approached. She pulled on a pair of heavy-duty heat-resistant gloves and cautiously pushed the door open. The boiler room was a vision of chaos. A thick cloud of steam filled the upper half of the room, and a torrent of scalding water was jetting from a huge, rust-coloured pipe near the main circulation pump, hitting the opposite wall and cascading onto the floor. The concrete floor was already inches deep in steaming water. It was a dangerous, violent mess of heat and pressure. This was not a leak; this was a plumbing hemorrhage.\n\nSam\u2019s mind went into a state of cold, clear focus, the panic and noise fading into the background. Her eyes scanned the complex web of pipes, valves, and gauges, a three-dimensional blueprint forming in her head. \"It's the main return from the east wing radiators,\" she shouted to Liam over the din. \"A catastrophic joint failure. Probably corroded from the inside out for years.\" She waded into the hot water, her thick work boots providing some protection, and moved with a sure-footed purpose towards a bank of large, red-handled gate valves on the far wall. \"I need to isolate the circuit.\" She put her wrench on the first valve and threw her weight against it. It didn't budge, rusted solid by years of heat and neglect. She swore, repositioning herself and trying again, the muscles in her back and shoulders straining.\n\n\"Need a hand?\" Liam's voice was right beside her. He had followed her in, his jeans already soaked to the knee, his face beaded with sweat from the intense heat. He looked at the valve, then at her, and seemed to understand immediately. \"You pull, I'll push,\" he shouted. She reset the wrench, and he placed his hands next to hers on the long handle. \"On three,\" she grunted. \"One\u2026 two\u2026 THREE!\" They threw their combined weight into it, a synchronised burst of effort. For a heart-stopping moment, nothing happened. Then, with a great, groaning screech of tortured metal, the valve wheel began to turn. They worked together, grunting with the strain, until the valve was fully closed. The torrent of water from the ruptured pipe lessened, but didn't stop completely. \"There's a secondary loop,\" she gasped, already moving to the next valve. Working as a team, they fought with two more seized valves, their movements falling into an unspoken rhythm of effort and release. Finally, with the third valve closed, the roar from the broken pipe subsided to a gushing hiss, then a trickle, and finally a steaming dribble. The immediate crisis was over.\n\nSam sagged against the wall, breathing heavily, her hair plastered to her forehead. The room was still an oven, the air thick with the smell of rust and hot metal, but the terrifying violence had subsided. Liam was leaning against a pump beside her, equally breathless, his t-shirt soaked through with a mixture of steam and sweat. He looked from her to the now-tamed pipe, a look of profound respect on his face. \"Okay,\" he said, wiping his brow with the back of his arm. \"So that's what a rupture looks like. My dissertation suddenly feels significantly less stressful.\" His attempt at a joke was a welcome release of tension, and Sam felt a genuine laugh escape her.\n\n\"Don't get used to it. I normally charge extra for an apprentice,\" she said, her professional mask returning, though its edges were softer now. She began to assess the damage properly, her mind already calculating the parts, the time, the cost. \"It's a full section replacement. Have to drain the whole system. It'll take me the rest of the day just to make it safe and cap it off.\" Liam didn't leave. He stood by, passing her tools when she pointed to them, holding a heavy-duty torch so she could inspect the corroded joint more closely, his presence a quiet, unwavering support. He was her caddy, here in the dark, cramped, and vital underworld that was her domain.\n\nAs she worked to cut away the damaged section of pipe, the topic of his dissertation came back, unbidden. \"So, three weeks,\" she said, her voice sounding unnaturally loud in the now-quiet room. \"Then you're free. What's the plan? Off to conquer the world of medieval history?\" The question was casual, but it was weighted with the fear she had felt that morning. He stopped what he was doing \u2013 coiling a length of hose \u2013 and looked at her, his expression serious. He had heard what she was really asking.\n\n\"The plan is to sleep for a week, for a start,\" he said, his tone light but his eyes holding hers. \"And then\u2026 I don't know, Sam. The academic job market is a nightmare. I might have to look at posts in Edinburgh, Glasgow\u2026 maybe even down south. It's not like there are a lot of openings for medievalists in St Andrews.\" It was the answer she had been dreading. Her stomach tightened. He was going to leave. He saw the shift in her expression, the slight dimming in her eyes, and he took a step closer, closing the distance between them. \"Hey,\" he said softly. \"That's the 'where'. That's the logistics. That's not the plan. Freedom from the dissertation, Sam. That's all it is. Freedom from the library and my supervisor and footnotes.\" He reached out and gently took the heavy pipe wrench from her hand, setting it down on a nearby ledge. He took her hands, which were grimy and raw, in his. \"I haven't figured out the 'what next' part. But I know who it's with. That's the part of the plan I'm sure about.\"His words landed in the humid, metallic air of the boiler room and seemed to absorb all other sound. The drip of water from a dozen cooling pipes, the low hum of the circulation pump, his own breathing\u2014it all faded away, leaving only the quiet, staggering weight of his declaration. Sam stared at their joined hands. His were pale and long-fingered, a scholar\u2019s hands, now smudged with the grime of her world. Hers were calloused and capable, marked with the small nicks and burns of her trade, now held with a tenderness she had never known. The carefully constructed walls of her life, already breached and crumbling, simply dissolved into dust, leaving her standing exposed and utterly vulnerable in the ruins. She couldn\u2019t find the words for a grand reply. Her vocabulary was built of copper and steel, of pressure ratings and flow rates, not this. She swallowed hard, her throat tight, and managed a single, breathy syllable that was both a question and a surrender. \u201cAye?\u201d\n\nThe spell was broken not by him, but by the pragmatic, insistent pull of reality. The manager would be waiting. The system needed to be drained. A hundred practical problems were queuing up, demanding her attention. She gently withdrew her hands from his, the loss of contact a sudden, sharp chill. It was not a rejection, but a reclaiming of her purpose, a necessary retreat to the solid ground of her competence. She cleared her throat, her voice returning to its usual gruff register. \"Right. Well. We've stopped the flood. Now I've got to make sure it doesn't happen again tonight.\" She turned back to the wounded pipework, her focus narrowing once more to the task at hand. The emotional vertigo receded, replaced by the familiar clarity of a solvable problem.\n\nLiam watched her, a soft, knowing smile on his face. He understood. He didn\u2019t push for more words, didn't try to prolong the moment. He simply accepted her pivot back to the practical, recognising it as an essential part of who she was. He picked up the heavy wrench she had set down and held it out to her, not as a challenge, but as an offering. \u201cWhat\u2019s next, boss?\u201d he asked, his tone light, respectful, and deeply affectionate. He had seamlessly shifted from romantic lead to apprentice, and the transition felt perfectly natural. The rest of the work passed in a state of focused teamwork. He anticipated her needs, passing her tools, bracing pipes as she cut them, his presence a steady and reassuring counterpoint to the solitary nature of her usual labour. The boiler room, once a scene of violent chaos, became their shared workshop, a space where the last of the barriers between their worlds was dismantled and reassembled into a new and stronger structure.\n\nWhen they finally emerged, grimy, sweating, and exhausted, into the pristine corridor, the club manager was waiting. He looked from the now-quiet boiler room door to their filth-streaked faces, his earlier panic replaced by a kind of bewildered gratitude. \u201cIs it\u2026 is it fixed?\u201d he asked, his voice a reedy whisper. \u201cIt\u2019s safe for the night,\u201d Sam confirmed, wiping her hands on an already filthy rag. \u201cI\u2019ve isolated the circuit and capped the main line. I\u2019ll need to come back tomorrow with parts. A lot of parts.\u201d The manager nodded, his gaze flicking to Liam, who was quietly loading tools back into Sam\u2019s toolbox. The indignant moustache seemed to have lost some of its starch. \u201cWell\u2026 thank you,\u201d he said, his gaze including them both. \u201cBoth of you. The club is\u2026 very grateful.\u201d It was a small thing, but in the clubhouse of St Andrews, being acknowledged as a unit was a seismic shift.\n\nThe drive back to her flat was filled with a new kind of quiet. It wasn't the silence of strangers or the comfortable quiet of companionship; it was the charged, thoughtful silence that follows a fundamental change. They were both filthy, their clothes damp and smelling of rust. Sam drove, her hands aching on the steering wheel, her mind a churn of pipe diameters and Liam's words. It was she who broke the silence as they neared her street, her voice carefully neutral. \u201cSo. Edinburgh. Glasgow. It\u2019s a long commute for a cup of tea.\u201d She was laying the problem on the table, like a faulty valve, wanting to see all its parts, to understand the mechanics of the challenge ahead.\n\nLiam turned in his seat to look at her, his face streaked with dirt but his eyes clear. \u201cI know,\u201d he said simply. He didn\u2019t offer easy solutions or dismiss her unspoken fears. \u201cI know your business is here. Mrs Baird needs her taps fixed. The clubhouse needs you to save it from itself. Your life is here.\u201d He paused, letting the truth of that settle between them. \u201cSo we\u2019ll figure it out. It's a problem, like a seized valve. We just have to find the right tool. Maybe I can find a research post at the university here. Maybe I commute a few days a week. The point is, we\u2019re figuring it out together now. The plan starts here, with you. The rest is just logistics.\u201d The word \u2018we\u2019 was a balm, a powerful solvent that began to dissolve the hard knot of fear in her gut.\n\nIt was almost ten o\u2019clock when she unlocked her front door. The flat, which had once been her refuge from the world, now felt like a refuge for them both. Without discussion, he went straight to the shower while she ordered a curry from the local takeaway, shouting questions about his spice tolerance through the closed door. An hour later, they were sitting on her sofa, side-by-side, eating chicken tikka masala out of foil containers, both of them clean and dressed in comfortable clothes. He was wearing a spare, ridiculously oversized jumper of hers that she kept for painting, and it looked better on him than it ever had on her. The sheer domesticity of the scene\u2014the smell of curry, the low murmur of the television, his knee occasionally brushing against hers\u2014was more revolutionary to her system than any ruptured pipe.\n\nLater, as she was washing up, he spread his dissertation papers across her small dining table, a sea of footnotes and highlighted text. She watched him from the kitchen, watched as his brow furrowed in concentration, and then as his eyelids began to droop, his battle against exhaustion finally lost. His head drooped, coming to rest on his folded arms, right on top of a chapter about fifteenth-century Scottish wool tariffs. A profound tenderness, fierce and protective, swelled in her chest. She dried her hands, walked over to the sofa, and picked up the old wool blanket she had offered him the night before. Quietly, she draped it over his shoulders. He stirred, a soft murmur in his sleep, but didn't wake. Sam stood there for a long moment, watching him. The man who had faced down sewage and steam for her, who saw the world in stories, was asleep at her table. Her flat was quiet, but for the first time, it was full. This was home. And whatever came next, whatever logistics needed to be solved, they would start from here. Together.The first light of dawn was filtering through the gaps in her blinds when Sam woke, a pale, watery grey that promised another overcast Scottish day. She lay still for a moment, listening. The sound was still there: the soft, rhythmic cadence of Liam\u2019s breathing from the living room. It was the second morning she had woken to it, and already it was weaving itself into the fabric of her life, a quiet bass note beneath the melody of her own solitude. She slipped out of bed and crept to the living room doorway. He was still slumped over her dining table, his head pillowed on his arms, the wool blanket she had draped over him askew. His dissertation lay scattered around him like the aftermath of a paper explosion. A fierce, unfamiliar surge of protectiveness washed over her. He looked so young like this, stripped of his easy confidence, just a tired student wrestling with history. She retreated to the kitchen, her movements hushed, and set about making coffee, the ritual now imbued with a new sense of purpose. It was no longer just about fuelling herself for the day ahead; it was about providing for the sleeping man in her living room.\n\nHe woke with a groan as she was pouring the coffee, stretching his back with a wince that spoke of a night spent contorted over a table. He blinked at her, his eyes unfocused for a moment before recognition and a sheepish smile dawned. \u201cMorning,\u201d he mumbled, running a hand through his already anarchic hair. \u201cI think I got about four hundred words written about wool tariffs and then they turned on me.\u201d He looked at the mug of coffee she placed in front of him, then at her, and his smile softened into something warmer. \u201cYou\u2019re a lifesaver, Sam.\u201d She just grunted in response, a sound that he was beginning to learn was her primary form of affection, and pushed a plate with two slices of toast towards him. Her version of a grand romantic breakfast. \u201cEat,\u201d she ordered. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a deadline. I\u2019ve got to go back to the club and wrestle with half a ton of rusted iron. I\u2019ll be gone all day.\u201d\n\nThe unspoken part of her statement hung in the air between them: *Stay here. Work here.* It was a huge concession, an offering of trust she wouldn't have been capable of a week ago. Her flat was her sanctuary, and she was willingly leaving him in sole charge of it. He seemed to understand the magnitude of the gesture immediately. He didn't question it or make a big deal of it; he just nodded, his expression serious and grateful. \u201cOkay,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll try not to burn the place down. And I\u2019ll have this draft finished by the time you get back. I promise.\u201d As she was pulling on her work boots by the door, he came over, still holding his mug of coffee. He didn't kiss her. He just reached out and brushed a smear of toast crumb from the corner of her mouth with his thumb, a small, intimate gesture that felt more significant than any passionate embrace. \u201cBe careful,\u201d he said, his voice low. \u201cYou\u2019re the one wrestling with half a ton of rusted iron.\u201d\n\nThe clubhouse boiler room was a war zone of organised chaos. Sam had a delivery of new pipes, joints, and industrial-grade fittings waiting for her, and she set to work with a ferocious, single-minded focus. The job was complex, requiring her to cut and replace a large, integral section of the main heating circuit. It was heavy, dirty, physically demanding work, the kind that usually left her in a state of grim, solitary satisfaction. But today was different. As she measured a length of three-inch steel pipe, her mind wasn't just on the measurements. It was on the man she had left sitting at her dining table, surrounded by her plumbing manuals and his historical texts. The thought of going home no longer conjured an image of an empty, silent flat, but of him, his smile, the easy way he occupied a space that had only ever been hers. The knowledge acted like a hidden power source, fuelling her through the long, arduous hours. The physical strain was immense, but the soul-deep weariness that usually accompanied it was absent, replaced by a quiet thrum of anticipation.\n\nShe finished the final weld just as dusk was settling, the sharp, bright flare of her torch the last pocket of light in the cavernous, shadowy boiler room. The new section of pipe gleamed under her headlamp, a solid, perfect artery grafted into the old, tired system. It was a good joint, a piece of work she could be proud of. She pressure-tested the circuit, her eyes glued to the gauge. It held steady. No leaks, no weaknesses. Victory. As she packed her tools away, her muscles screaming in protest, she pulled out her phone. There were no missed calls, no texts. Just silence. For a moment, a sliver of the old doubt crept in. Maybe he\u2019d finished his paper and just left. Maybe the reality of her life, the long hours and the grime, had finally sunk in. She shoved the thought away, angry at herself for its intrusion. Trust, she reminded herself. It was a new tool in her box, and she was still learning how to use it.\n\nWhen she finally pushed open the door to her flat, weary to the bone and smelling strongly of flux and metal dust, she was met not with silence, but with the rich, comforting aroma of baked pasta. The living room was tidy, her armchair and sofa no longer draped with his clothes. The dining table was clear, his laptop closed and his papers stacked in a neat, impressive pile. And Liam was standing in her kitchen, pulling a bubbling dish of macaroni and cheese from her small oven, a clean tea towel slung over his shoulder. He looked up as she came in, his face tired but triumphant. \"Draft submitted,\" he announced, a proud grin spreading across his face. \"And I figured you might be hungry.\" He looked her up and down, taking in her exhausted posture and the fresh grime on her face and overalls. \"Go shower,\" he said, his voice soft but firm. \"Dinner will be ready when you get out. The hot water is working, I checked. I figured it had better be, in this flat of all places.\" She stood in the doorway, toolbag hanging from her hand, utterly speechless. She had left him a key under the mat, just in case, a last-minute decision she'd agonised over. He had used it not just to be here, but to build a welcome for her. This, she thought, with a clarity that cut through her exhaustion. This is what it feels like. Not to be saved, but to be met. To come home.The shower was an act of transition. The scalding water, a luxury she provided for others but rarely enjoyed herself, sluiced the grime of the clubhouse from her skin. She watched as grey rivulets of sweat, dirt, and metal dust swirled and vanished down the drain she herself had installed three years ago. It felt symbolic, washing away the evidence of her solitary, self-sufficient life. But as she scrubbed at a stubborn patch of grease on her forearm, she knew that some changes couldn't be washed away. When she stepped out into the steam-filled bathroom and caught her reflection in the misted mirror, she saw the same tired face, the same familiar lines of exhaustion around her eyes. But the eyes themselves were different. The hard, defensive wariness that had been their default setting for a decade had been replaced by something softer, something that looked suspiciously like hope. The woman in the mirror wasn't a different person, but she was a version of herself Sam had never met before.\n\nDressed in a clean, soft jumper and worn-in jeans that felt like a second skin, she walked back into the living room. The scene that met her was one of such simple, profound domesticity it almost stopped her heart. Liam had set two places at her small dining table, using her mismatched plates and the cutlery she usually just grabbed from the drawer. The bubbling dish of macaroni and cheese sat in the centre, its cheesy crust a perfect, glorious gold. He was pouring them both a glass of water, his movements as unselfconscious and natural as if he\u2019d been doing it for years. He looked up and smiled, and the warmth of it reached her across the room, wrapping around her like a blanket.\n\n\u201cI hope you like it crispy on top,\u201d he said, pulling out a chair for her. \u201cIt\u2019s my one culinary masterpiece. Years of student living have honed it to perfection.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not from a box, is it?\u201d she asked, sinking into the chair, the sarcasm a comfortable, familiar reflex.\n\n\u201cFrom scratch,\u201d he said proudly. \u201cI even found that block of cheese you were worried about. It had a few things to say for itself, but I convinced it to cooperate.\u201d\n\nThey ate in a companionable quiet at first, the only sounds the scrape of forks on plates and the low hum of the refrigerator. The food was absurdly good, a rich, comforting ballast against the day\u2019s exhaustion. He asked her about the job, and she found herself describing the satisfaction of the final, perfect weld, the way the new steel pipe gleamed amidst the old iron, a clean fix in a system full of decay. He listened, his chin propped on his hand, not just hearing the words but understanding the fierce, quiet pride she took in her craft. In turn, he described the final, frantic hours of wrestling with his conclusion, the maddening search for a single footnote, the sheer, giddy relief of hitting the \u2018send\u2019 button. They were stories from two different universes, yet they were telling the same tale: a long, hard day\u2019s work, well done.\n\nAfter they had finished, and Sam had steadfastly refused his offer to wash up, a comfortable lull settled over the room. Liam leaned back in his chair, his expression thoughtful. \u201cSo,\u201d he said, his voice softer now. \u201cThe beast is slain. The draft is in.\u201d He paused, and Sam felt a familiar tension begin to gather in her chest, a low-pressure warning of an approaching storm. \u201cI spent a bit of time today, when I wasn\u2019t writing, looking at university job portals. Just to see what the landscape looks like.\u201d The storm had arrived. This was it. The practical, unavoidable reality she had been dreading. Her first instinct, the well-worn escape route in her mind, was to stand up, to start clearing the plates, to create a physical barrier of activity. But she didn\u2019t. She held his gaze, her hands clasped in her lap, and forced herself to stay still, to face the pressure head-on.\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d she said, her voice coming out steadier than she expected. It was the voice she used with a client when explaining a costly but necessary repair. \u201cWhat\u2019s the damage? What are the going rates for a historian who knows a suspicious amount about fifteenth-century sheep?\u201d The question hung in the air, blunt and practical. It was her way of saying, *I\u2019m not running. I\u2019m here. Show me the problem.* A slow, amazed smile spread across Liam\u2019s face. It was a look of pure, unadulterated delight. He laughed, a low, happy sound. \u201cI should have known,\u201d he said, shaking his head. \u201cI should have known you\u2019d want to see the schematics before we even discussed the build.\u201d He pushed his chair back, retrieved his laptop from the sofa, and brought it to the table, placing it between their empty plates. \u201cAlright then, Sam the Plumber,\u201d he said, his eyes twinkling. \u201cLet\u2019s look at the plumbing of our future.\u201d\n\nThe screen lit up, illuminating their faces in its cool, white glow. He showed her the job sites, the long lists of posts for fellowships, lectureships, and research assistants. He pointed out the salaries, which were, as she had suspected, frighteningly low. Her pragmatic mind immediately began to calculate. She ran the numbers on rent, on bills, on the running costs of her van, her mind a flurry of mental arithmetic. The sheer impracticality of it all was daunting. She saw listings for universities in cities that were just names on a map to her: Manchester, Durham, Exeter, places that sounded as distant as the moon. \u201cExeter\u2019s out,\u201d she stated, pointing at the screen. \u201cI\u2019d need a new set of van tires every six months.\u201d He didn\u2019t laugh. He just nodded, taking her practical objection with the seriousness it deserved. \u201cOkay. Exeter\u2019s out.\u201d They were a team, troubleshooting a complex and frustrating system, and his willingness to treat her concerns as valid data points was more reassuring than any romantic promise.\n\nThey scrolled through the listings together, a strange, modern form of fortune-telling. He was the expert, explaining the arcane terminology of academia\u2014the difference between a teaching fellowship and a research grant, the brutal competition for every tenure-track position. She was the anchor, the voice of logistical reality, her mind firmly rooted in the world of fuel costs and mortgage payments. It was during their trawl through the dregs of the listings, the less prestigious, short-term contracts, that he stopped. \u201cWait a second,\u201d he murmured, leaning closer to the screen. \u201cLook at this.\u201d It was a six-month research assistant post, right there at St Andrews. The title was unglamorous: \u2018Digitisation and Archival Assistant for the East Neuk Maritime History Project\u2019. The pay was barely enough to live on. It was a footnote of a job, a temporary contract most ambitious academics would scroll right past.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a lectureship,\u201d he said, almost to himself. \u201cIt\u2019s basically just scanning old fishing ledgers and ships\u2019 manifests. But it\u2019s here. It\u2019s six months, starting in the autumn.\u201d He looked at her, and she saw not disappointment in his eyes, but a spark of genuine excitement. \u201cIt\u2019s a foot in the door,\u201d she said, understanding immediately. It wasn\u2019t the grand career he might have dreamed of, but it was a practical, workable solution. It was a piece of pipe that would fit, a temporary fix that would keep the system running. It was a plan.\n\nHe reached across the table and covered her hand with his, his thumb tracing patterns on her knuckles. \u201cIt\u2019s six more months of coming home to this,\u201d he said, his voice quiet, his gaze taking in her, the table, the small, warm room. \u201cThe rest\u2026 the rest is just logistics.\u201d Sam looked from his earnest, hopeful face to their joined hands resting on the table amidst the crumbs of their shared meal. The future was no longer an abstract, terrifying threat. It was a concrete problem, a job to be tackled. It would be complicated and difficult, and it might not work. But for the first time, she felt the quiet, solid confidence of a professional facing a challenge she was no longer afraid of. Because this time, she wasn\u2019t working alone.The weeks between the discovery of the job posting and the official offer letter were a strange limbo. Life continued, but with a low-frequency hum of anticipation beneath the surface. Liam submitted his dissertation to a flurry of congratulatory emails from his department and promptly collapsed into a state of contented exhaustion, spending his days reading novels and his nights sleeping soundly on her sofa. For Sam, the waiting was a new and uncomfortable sensation. She was a woman of action, of diagnosis and immediate repair. This passive state of hoping for a favourable outcome from a faceless university committee felt like waiting for a part to be delivered with no tracking number. She found herself checking her own phone for emails, a ridiculous and irrational habit, as if the news would somehow come to her. It was a stark reminder of how deeply her life had become entangled with his, her own peace of mind now contingent on the contents of an inbox that wasn't hers.\n\nThe news, when it came, was perfectly in character for them: anticlimactic and profoundly practical. She was halfway through replacing a leaking shower pump in a cramped en-suite, her hands covered in sealant and her temper frayed by a stripped screw, when her phone buzzed with a text from him. *Got it.* That was all it said. No exclamation points, no string of emojis. Just two words. She stared at the screen, the frustration of the stripped screw forgotten. A slow, wide grin spread across her face, a pure and unbidden reaction. She texted back a single word: *Pub.* That evening, they sat in the same booth at The Dunvegan where they\u2019d had their first drink. The air smelled of beer and frying onions, a scent she now associated with the beginning of everything. They didn\u2019t toast with champagne; they clinked his pint of Guinness against her whisky chaser. It wasn\u2019t a celebration of a great triumph, but a quiet, shared acknowledgement of a problem solved, a crisis averted. \"To six months,\" she said, her voice low. \"And to the East Neuk Maritime History Project, whatever the hell that is.\" He smiled, his eyes crinkling at the corners. \"To scanning old fishing ledgers,\" he replied, his voice full of a happiness that had nothing to do with academic prestige. \"And to having a key to the best flat in St Andrews.\"\n\nThe official moving in happened not with a van and boxes, but through a slow, organic process of accumulation, like sediment settling in a low-pressure pipe. It started with a toothbrush appearing in the mug on her bathroom shelf. Then a box of his most essential books found a home on the floor beside her armchair. Sam, watching this gradual colonisation of her space, felt a surprising lack of her old territorial defensiveness. One Saturday morning, she found herself standing in front of the small chest of drawers in her bedroom, a piece of furniture that held nothing but spare linens and old jumpers. With a sense of deliberate purpose, she emptied the top two drawers, folded the contents neatly, and put them in a cupboard. She didn't say anything when Liam came home from his last-ever caddying shift. She just nodded towards the bedroom. \"There are a couple of empty drawers in there,\" she said, her tone casual, as if she were pointing out a change in the weather. \"If you want to get your stuff out of that cardboard box.\" He stopped in the hallway, his golf bag still slung over his shoulder, and just looked at her. The gratitude in his eyes was so profound it made her feel suddenly shy, and she quickly turned away to busy herself at the kitchen sink.\n\nA few weeks later, while doing a routine check on Mrs Baird\u2019s boiler, the old woman peered at her over the top of her spectacles. \u201cYou look well, Samantha,\u201d she observed, her voice sharp as ever. \u201cLess like you\u2019re preparing for a siege. That lovely boy of yours must be a good influence.\u201d Sam, tightening a connection, didn't even bother with a denial this time. \u201cHe\u2019s alright,\u201d she mumbled, a faint blush rising on her neck. \u201cHe\u2019s starting a new job at the university next week.\u201d Mrs Baird nodded sagely, as if this confirmed a long-held theory. \u201cGood. A man needs a purpose. Just remember, dear,\u201d she added, tapping a finger on the newly serviced boiler, \u201cthe strongest systems are the ones with good circulation. Can\u2019t have one part doing all the work while the other sits cold. You have to keep the warmth flowing both ways.\u201d Sam paused, wrench in hand, struck by the simple wisdom of the old woman\u2019s metaphor. She looked at her own hands, calloused and capable, and thought of Liam\u2019s, which had learned to make spreadsheets for her chaotic invoicing system and could produce a perfect omelette from the desolate landscape of her fridge. The warmth, she realised, was already flowing both ways.\n\nThe new normal quickly established itself. It was a rhythm composed of two different melodies that somehow harmonised. Her days were governed by the urgent demands of burst pipes and broken boilers, a world of tangible emergencies and immediate fixes. His were now spent in a quiet, dusty office in a forgotten corner of the library, a world of patient research and slow, methodical digitisation. He would come home in the evenings with the faint, sweet smell of old paper clinging to his clothes, his mind full of the ghost ships and forgotten sailors he\u2019d spent the day with. He\u2019d find her at the dining table, surrounded by her own kind of archive\u2014receipts, supplier invoices, and job sheets\u2014her brow furrowed in a frustration that had nothing to do with history. He would make her tea, sit beside her, and patiently untangle the numbers, bringing the quiet order of his world to the noisy chaos of hers. She, in turn, would listen as he talked about a newly discovered ledger from a nineteenth-century herring boat, seeing in his passion a reflection of her own satisfaction in a job well done.\n\nOne rainy Tuesday, Sam found herself with a rare afternoon free, a job having cancelled at the last minute. On a sudden impulse, she drove into town and parked near the library. She didn\u2019t go in. Instead, she went to a small homeware shop on a cobbled side street, a place she had only ever entered to buy replacement tap washers. She walked past the practical items, the drain unblockers and the scrubbing brushes, and stopped in front of a display of brightly coloured mugs. They were sturdy and well-made, a world away from the novelty sheep mug he was still using. She picked up a deep blue one, a colour that reminded her of his eyes on the day they\u2019d met in the sewage-filled locker room. It felt solid and right in her hand. She bought it, along with a matching one in a warm, earthy green for herself. It was an absurdly small purchase, but as she walked back to her van, the small, clanking weight of the bag in her hand felt as significant as signing a deed. It was an investment. It was a statement. It was the quiet acknowledgement that her flat was no longer a fortress for one, but a home for two.\n\nThat evening, when Liam came through the door, shaking the rain from his coat, she didn't say a word. She just handed him a cup of tea, steaming hot, in the new blue mug. He stopped, looking down at the mug in his hands, then up at her, a slow, wonderful smile spreading across his face. He understood completely. He knew it wasn\u2019t just a mug. It was a joint, perfectly soldered. It was a binding contract, renewed and reinforced. It was the quiet, incontrovertible evidence that for the next six months\u2014and maybe, just maybe, for a long time after that\u2014they were building something to last. He raised the mug in a silent toast. She raised her new green one in reply. Outside, the rain beat down on the ancient town of St Andrews, but inside the small, warm flat, the system was stable, the pressure was perfect, and for the first time in her life, Sam felt completely, utterly, and profoundly safe.The months of autumn settled over St Andrews, bringing with them a damp chill that crept in from the sea and a low, pearlescent light that made the ancient stones of the town gleam. Inside the small, second-floor flat, however, a different climate had taken hold. It was a climate of warmth and quiet routine, of two mugs by the coffee maker and a second pair of boots by the door. Sam had discovered that living with someone was not the constant, noisy intrusion she had always feared. Instead, it was a series of quiet discoveries. It was learning that Liam hummed, a tuneless, thoughtful sound, when he was deep in a book. It was the surprising pleasure of finding he had restocked the tea bags before they ran out. It was the simple, solid presence of him sleeping on the sofa, which he still insisted on doing most nights, claiming her bed was \"too neat\" and he was afraid of messing it up.\n\nLife fell into a rhythm. She would leave in the cold, dark mornings, her van smelling of copper and coffee, off to wrestle with the town\u2019s failing infrastructure. He would walk to his dusty office in the library, his mind filled with the trade winds and fishing fleets of centuries past. They would meet again in the evenings, two weary tradespeople from different centuries, sharing stories over a meal at the small dining table that had become the centre of their world. The six-month contract, once a terrifying deadline, had faded into the background, a low-pressure system far out at sea that didn't seem to threaten their current calm.\n\nOne Sunday, a rare day of rest for them both, the flat was filled with a comfortable, lived-in silence. Sam was at the kitchen counter, methodically dismantling a faulty kettle, the familiar clicks and snaps of the plastic casing a soothing balm to her restless hands. Liam was sprawled in her armchair, surrounded by a fortress of books, his brow furrowed in concentration. The kettle's thermal cut-out switch was faulty, a simple, ten-minute fix, but she was drawing it out, enjoying the simple, solvable nature of the problem. Liam looked up from his book, breaking the quiet. \u201cProfessor Albright just emailed. He wants me to go down to London next month. There\u2019s a big postgraduate conference on maritime history. Says it would be a good networking opportunity for when this contract runs out.\u201d\n\nSam\u2019s hands stilled, a tiny screwdriver held poised over a terminal. London. The word landed in the quiet room with the heavy, jarring thud of a dropped wrench. It was a place that existed only on the news and in the addresses of the parts suppliers she sometimes had to deal with. It was the epicentre of a world utterly alien to her. \u201cNetworking?\u201d she asked, her voice carefully neutral, her attention fixed on the kettle\u2019s wiring. \u201cSounds fancy.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s mostly just drinking cheap wine and listening to people argue about thirteenth-century shipping routes,\u201d he said with a laugh, oblivious to the sudden shift in the room's atmosphere. \u201cBut it\u2019s a chance to see what\u2019s out there. Maybe hear about a proper lectureship opening up before it gets advertised.\u201d He saw it as a practical step, a scouting mission for their future. She heard something else entirely. She heard the first, faint whisper of a world pulling him away, a world of ambition and opportunity that had no place for a plumber from St Andrews. The small, safe haven of her flat suddenly felt fragile, a temporary shelter on the edge of a vast and indifferent ocean. The old, familiar chill crept back into her bones.\n\nThe next day, she found herself on a job that was, for her, the equivalent of a holiday. It was a full bathroom refit in a house that was undergoing a complete renovation. The floors were bare, the walls were stripped back to the studs, and there were no pristine carpets or anxious homeowners to worry about. It was a blank canvas. For two days, she worked with a focused, almost joyful intensity, mapping out the new pipework, her hands moving with the sure and certain grace of a master craftsman. She was alone with the work, the only sounds the hiss of her torch and the satisfying rasp of a pipe cutter. Liam would text her in the afternoons\u2014*How's it going? Don't forget to eat*\u2014and she would reply with a terse\u2014*Fine. Busy.*\u2014feeling a strange, guilty satisfaction in the solitude. She was back in her element, a world of clean angles and solvable problems, a world where she didn't need anyone.\n\nOn the third day, she was soldering the final joints for the new shower valve, a complex lattice of copper pipe she had designed and built herself. It was a beautiful piece of work, a functional sculpture of perfect ninety-degree bends and flawless seams that no one but her would ever see. She was polishing a joint with wire wool when her phone rang. It was Mrs Baird. \u201cSamantha, dear, it\u2019s my kitchen tap. It\u2019s started to drip. I know it\u2019s not an emergency, but it\u2019s making a dreadful plinking sound and it\u2019s putting me off my crosswords.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll come by in the morning, Mrs B,\u201d Sam said automatically. \u201cI\u2019m on a big job right now.\u201d \u201cOf course, dear, whenever you can.\u201d They hung up, and Sam stood there, looking at the finished pipework. She could pack up now, head home. Liam would probably have dinner waiting. He would ask about her day, and she would have to find the words to describe the fierce, solitary pride she felt in her work. It felt easier to stay here, in the cold, dusty shell of the half-finished bathroom where she was completely, uncomplicatedly herself. With a sudden, decisive movement, she dialled Mrs Baird back. \u201cActually, Mrs B,\u201d she said, her voice bright and efficient. \u201cI\u2019ve just finished up. I can be with you in twenty minutes.\u201d\n\nShe arrived home hours later, long after dark, her body aching with a satisfying weariness. The flat was warm and smelled of garlic and tomatoes. Liam was at the table, his laptop open, but he had clearly been waiting for her. \"Hey,\" he said, his smile a little strained. \"I was getting worried. Everything okay?\" \"Fine,\" she said, shrugging out of her jacket and dropping her keys in the bowl with a clatter. \"Job ran late. Then Mrs Baird's tap was dripping. Fixed it.\" She went to the fridge, grabbing a bottle of water, aware that she was avoiding his gaze. \"I saved you some pasta,\" he said, nodding towards a plate covered with foil on the counter. \"I can heat it up for you.\" And that was the moment the valve in her chest, overtightened by a day of deliberate solitude, finally gave way. \"You don't have to do that,\" she snapped, the words sharper than she intended. \"You don't have to wait up for me. You don't have to save me dinner. I'm not a child, Liam. I've been feeding myself for a long time.\"\n\nHe looked utterly taken aback, his brow furrowed in hurt and confusion. \"I know that,\" he said slowly, closing his laptop. \"I wasn't trying to... I was just... being your boyfriend. It's what people do when they live together. They make each other dinner.\" \"Well, you don't need to,\" she said, her voice tight, the old defensive walls flying up, brick by painful brick. \"My life worked just fine before you started organising it. I don't need looking after.\" \"I'm not looking after you, Sam!\" His voice rose, laced with a frustration she had never heard from him before. \"I'm living with you! Do you think me making pasta is some kind of power play? I'm trying to be a partner, not your bloody guardian.\" He stood up, running a hand through his hair in a gesture of pure exasperation. \"What is this really about? Is this about the conference in London? Do you think I'm just going to swan off and forget about all this?\" Her silence was a confession. He let out a sigh, a mixture of anger and sorrow. \"I thought we were past this,\" he said, his voice dropping, full of a weariness that had nothing to do with work. \"I thought you trusted me.\" He turned and walked into the bedroom, closing the door behind him with a quiet, devastating click. Sam was left standing alone in the kitchen, the plate of cold pasta on the counter a monument to the argument. She had her silence back. And it had never felt so empty.The quiet click of the bedroom door was the loudest sound Sam had ever heard. It was a sound of finality, a lock turning, a valve being shut. It echoed in the sudden, profound silence of the flat, a silence that rushed in to fill the space where his voice had been. She stood frozen in the middle of her kitchen, her hands still damp from the bottle of water she\u2019d grabbed. The plate of pasta on the counter, covered in foil, seemed to mock her. It was an offering of warmth and care that she had thrown back in his face, treating it like an accusation. His words ricocheted around the inside of her skull: *I thought you trusted me.* She had bristled at his phrase \u2018looking after you,\u2019 but wasn\u2019t that exactly what her fortress of solitude had always been about? Looking after herself, because trusting anyone else to be there was a fool's game. She had spent years perfecting a system designed to run on a single, independent power source. The moment he had tried to connect his own, to create a shared circuit, she had blown the main fuse.\n\nShe didn't eat the pasta. She couldn't. Instead, she wrapped it tightly in another layer of foil and put it in the fridge, a clinical, emotionless action. Then she began to clean. She scrubbed the already spotless kitchen counters with a methodical fury. She dismantled the coffee machine and descaled it. She reorganised her toolbox in the hallway, lining up spanners and wrenches in perfect, descending order of size. She worked until her hands ached and her fingernails were raw, seeking the familiar, comforting exhaustion of physical labour. But it didn't come. There was no satisfaction, no quiet pride. There was only the cold, hollow ache of self-inflicted damage. Finally, long after midnight, she gave up and sank into her armchair, the room lit only by the orange glow of a single streetlamp outside. She stared at the closed bedroom door. It was a border she had drawn, and he was on the other side of it. For the first time, she felt like an unwelcome guest in her own home.\n\nSleep, when it finally came, was fitful and shallow. She woke on the sofa, a crick in her neck and a cold dread in the pit of her stomach. The early morning light was pale and unforgiving. The flat was utterly silent. She pushed herself up and listened. There was no sound from the bedroom. The routine of the past few months\u2014the quiet pleasure of making two cups of coffee, the shared silence as they prepared for their different days\u2014was gone. The air was thick with tension, a pressure imbalance that made it hard to breathe. She was standing by the kettle, her hand hovering over the power switch, when the bedroom door opened. Liam emerged, already dressed in jeans and a jumper. His face was pale and drawn, his eyes shadowed with a sleepless night. He didn't look at her. He moved with a quiet, deliberate purpose, gathering his books and his laptop from the dining table, his movements precise and economical. He was a visitor, packing to leave.\n\nThe sight of him, so distant and contained, was more painful than any shouting match could have been. The silence stretched between them, thin and brittle. She wanted to say something, anything, but the words were jammed deep in her throat, a blockage she didn't have the tools to clear. He went into the bathroom and she heard the sound of the electric razor, a harsh, buzzing sound that grated on the morning\u2019s fragile quiet. When he came out, he walked to the front door and began to pull on his coat. He still hadn't looked at her. He was going to leave. He was going to walk out of the door without a word, and it would be over, and it would be all her fault. A wave of pure, animal panic surged through her, so powerful it almost buckled her knees. \"Liam,\" she said, her voice a raw croak. He stopped, his hand on the doorknob, his back still to her. \"I made a mistake,\" she managed to say, the words feeling foreign and clumsy on her tongue. It wasn't an apology, not yet, but it was a crack in the wall she had thrown up. He was silent for a long moment. Then, without turning around, he said, his voice flat and devoid of emotion, \"I know.\" And then he opened the door and left, the quiet click of it closing behind him a devastating echo of the night before.The silence in the flat was not a void; it was a physical presence, a heavy blanket smothering all sound. Sam stood by the door where Liam had left, her hand still outstretched as if she could somehow catch the words she should have said and pull them back. The air was cold. Her flat, once a fortress of solitude and order, was now a crime scene, and she was both the victim and the perpetrator. The evidence of her transgression was everywhere. The plate of cold pasta in the fridge, a congealed testament to her cruelty. The two mugs by the sink, one chipped and familiar, one new and blue, a pair now cruelly separated. The empty space on the sofa where he should have been sleeping. She walked through the rooms in a daze, her own home feeling alien and hostile. She had won. She had driven him out and reclaimed her fortress. She was alone and safe from the terrifying vulnerability of being loved. And the victory tasted like ash.\n\nForcing herself into motion, she grabbed her work keys and jacket, the ingrained habit of a lifetime her only guide. Work was the answer. Work was always the answer. A problem of physics and mechanics would surely silence the screaming chaos in her head. She climbed into her van, the familiar smells of oil and metal offering no comfort. She drove to the renovation site, the big job, the blank canvas where she had felt so powerful and in control just yesterday. She walked into the half-finished bathroom, her footsteps echoing in the empty house. There it was: her masterpiece. The intricate lattice of copper pipe, a testament to her skill and precision. It was perfect. And it meant nothing. She picked up a wrench, its familiar weight feeling alien and useless in her hand. She stared at the flawless joints she had soldered, and all she could see were the fractured connections in her own life. She couldn't fix this. This was a breakage of a different kind, a catastrophic failure of the heart, and she didn't have the tools or the training to even begin the repair. The wrench slipped from her numb fingers and clattered to the floor, the sound sharp and shocking in the silence. She sank down onto an overturned bucket, put her head in her hands, and for the first time since her father\u2019s funeral, she wept.\n\nShe didn't know how long she sat there, but eventually the tears subsided, leaving behind a cold, hollow clarity. She couldn't stay here. She couldn't work. On autopilot, she packed away her tools, locked up the site, and started driving, with no destination in mind. Her hands guided the van through the familiar streets until she found herself parked outside a small, neat bungalow with a well-tended rose garden. Mrs. Baird\u2019s house. She had no reason to be there. The tap was fixed. But her feet carried her up the path and her finger pressed the doorbell before her brain could register the action. The door opened, and Mrs. Baird stood there, her sharp eyes taking in Sam\u2019s red-rimmed eyes, her pale face, and the deep, raw misery etched there. \"Good heavens, child,\" the old woman said, her voice losing its usual sharp edge and softening with concern. \"You look like you've been wrestling a poltergeist.\" She stepped aside, holding the door open. \"Get in here and put the kettle on. You look like you need a proper cup of tea.\"\n\nSam found herself in Mrs. Baird's warm, lavender-scented kitchen, the familiar actions of filling the kettle and finding the mugs a fragile anchor in her swirling sea of regret. She didn\u2019t speak, but Mrs. Baird didn't seem to need her to. The old woman sat at her small kitchen table, watching her with a piercing, not-unkind gaze. \"So,\" Mrs. Baird said, once the tea was made and they were both seated. \"The lovely boy has finally seen the dragon that guards your castle, has he?\" The bluntness of the question was like a lance to a wound, painful but necessary. Sam flinched, then nodded mutely, stirring her tea so hard it slopped over the side of the mug. \"I said some things,\" Sam whispered, her voice hoarse. \"I pushed him away. I\u2026 I was scared.\" Mrs. Baird took a slow, deliberate sip of her tea. \"Of course you were, dear. Love is terrifying. It\u2019s the only thing in the world more unpredictable than old plumbing. You spend your life learning how to seal every joint, how to guard against every possible leak, and then you invite someone in who has the power to just smash the whole system to pieces.\" She placed her cup down with a soft click. \"But the trick of it, the thing nobody tells you, is that they also have the power to help you build something stronger than you ever could on your own. It's a dreadful risk. Most sensible people would run a mile.\" She fixed Sam with a stern look. \"And you, Samantha, are an eminently sensible person. Which is your problem.\"\n\nThe old woman\u2019s words hit their mark with devastating accuracy. Sam was sensible. She was practical. She had built her entire life on managing risk and avoiding unpredictable variables. And Liam was the most wonderful, unpredictable variable she had ever encountered. \"I broke it, Mrs. B,\" Sam said, her voice cracking. \"I broke it and he's gone.\" \"Nonsense,\" Mrs. Baird said sharply. \"A broken pipe can be mended. A crack can be sealed. But not if the plumber leaves her tools in the van and goes home. You are a fixer, Samantha. It is the very essence of you. You have never, in all the years I have known you, walked away from a job that was difficult. Are you going to start now, with the most important one of your life?\" The question hung in the air, a direct challenge. It was a call to arms disguised as a cup of tea. Sam looked down at her hands, the hands that knew how to fix things, and a spark of her old resolve returned. She wasn\u2019t a person who gave up.\n\nShe left Mrs. Baird\u2019s house with a renewed, albeit terrified, sense of purpose. She drove not home, but to the university, her heart hammering against her ribs with a frantic, unsteady rhythm. She parked the van, a hulking, mud-splattered beast amidst the neat little hatchbacks of the students, and walked towards the library. She had never felt more out of place in her life. The hushed, scholarly air felt like a judgment. Every student who passed, their arms full of books, seemed to look at her overalls and the grime under her fingernails with disdain. But she pushed on, fuelled by Mrs. Baird\u2019s words and a desperate, flickering hope. She found his office in a forgotten corner of the building, a small, windowless room with a door that was slightly ajar. She could hear the faint, frantic clicking of a keyboard from within. Taking a breath that did nothing to calm her nerves, she pushed the door open. He was there, hunched over his laptop, the harsh glow of the screen illuminating the strained lines of his face. He was not working on his project. He was scrolling through job listings for universities in London. The sight was a punch to the gut. She had done this. Her fear was becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy. \"Liam,\" she said, her voice barely a whisper. He started, his head snapping up, his eyes wide with shock. The hurt was still there, raw and deep, but underneath it was a flicker of something else: surprise, confusion, and a pain that mirrored her own. She stood in the doorway of his world, a plumber with no tools, about to attempt the most difficult repair of her life. \"I need to fix this,\" she said, her voice shaking but clear. \"And I don't know how. But you can't just walk away from a job this big. It's\u2026 it\u2019s against regulations.\"Liam stared at her, his face a mask of disbelief and exhaustion. The words hung in the small, dusty office, so quintessentially Sam that it was almost absurd. A problem of regulations. He gave a short, humourless laugh that was more like a cough, a sound of pure, bitter frustration. He pushed his chair back from the desk, the screech of its legs on the floor a sharp, angry sound.\n\n\u201cRegulations?\u201d he repeated, his voice dangerously quiet. \u201cIs that what this is to you? Another job? A faulty connection in need of a service? You can\u2019t just come in here, covered in the dirt of a job you chose over talking to me, and tell me our relationship is against regulations.\u201d He stood up, pacing the tiny space between his desk and a teetering pile of books. \u201cI spent the night on the floor of my office because I couldn\u2019t bear the silence in our flat. The flat you made it clear I was an intruder in. And I come in here this morning and start looking for a way out, a real way out, because you told me in no uncertain terms that there was nothing here for me. You told me you didn\u2019t need me. And now you show up talking about regulations.\u201d\n\nEvery word was a blow, a righteous and well-aimed strike against the flimsy armour she had tried to erect. She flinched but held her ground in the doorway, knowing she deserved every bit of his anger. This was the part of the job she always hated: facing the homeowner after the damage was done, when the full, messy, and expensive reality of the breakage was laid bare. \u201cAye,\u201d she said, her voice small but steady. \u201cYes. It\u2019s the only way I know how to talk about it. It\u2019s the only language I\u2019ve got, Liam. Don\u2019t you see? My whole world is made of things that are either working or broken. There\u2019s no in-between.\u201d She took a hesitant step into the room, into his territory. \u201cYou started talking about London, about networking, about a future, and all my alarms went off. A major pressure drop. A risk of catastrophic failure. And my training, my whole life, has taught me that when you see a sign like that, you shut down the system. You isolate the fault. You protect the main supply at all costs. I\u2026 I isolated you.\u201d\n\nThe confession hung in the air, raw and technical and deeply, painfully honest. He stopped pacing and just looked at her, the anger in his eyes slowly being replaced by a deep, weary sadness. He saw the truth of it. He saw the scared, sensible woman who treated her own heart like a high-pressure boiler, full of fail-safes and emergency shut-offs. \u201cI wasn\u2019t planning an escape, Sam,\u201d he said, his voice softening, losing its hard edge. \u201cI was trying to build something. I was looking for a way to make a life with you viable in the long term. A way to stay. When you pushed me away last night, you made London feel like the only option. You took the \u2018us\u2019 off the table, so all that was left was me.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause I\u2019m a coward,\u201d she whispered, the admission a shard of glass in her throat. \u201cIt\u2019s easier to cut the pipe myself than to stand around and wait for it to burst and flood the whole damn house. I\u2019ve always been the one who cleans up the mess. I didn\u2019t think I could survive a mess I couldn\u2019t fix.\u201d She looked around the small, cluttered office, at the life he was building, a life of words and ideas she felt so separate from. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to do this. I\u2019m wired wrong. All my life, if something was broken, I knew how to take it apart, find the faulty component, and replace it. But this\u2026 this is my faulty component.\u201d She tapped a finger against her own chest. \u201cAnd I can\u2019t replace it. I don\u2019t know how to fix it if I don\u2019t even understand the schematic.\u201d\n\nThat was it. The final wall turned to dust. She stood before him, completely dismantled, her internal wiring exposed for him to see. He stared at her for a long, silent moment, his expression unreadable. Then, with a slow, deliberate movement, he reached over and closed the laptop, shutting down the glowing screen of job listings for London, plunging the room into the softer, greyer light from the corridor. He walked across the small space that separated them, stopping just in front of her. She braced herself, expecting him to turn away, to walk past her and out the door. Instead, he reached out and gently took her hands. They were cold and stiff, her knuckles scraped from her work. He held them in his own, his warmth slowly seeping into her.\n\n\u201cThen we learn the schematic together,\u201d he said, his voice a low, steady murmur. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to fix it alone, Sam. That\u2019s the whole point. You let me in. You show me the bits that are rusted shut and you let me help you put the wrench on it. You\u2019re right. This is a job for two people.\u201d He looked down at their joined hands, then back up at her face, his thumb gently stroking the back of her hand. \u201cI\u2019m not going to London. Not without you. The only networking I\u2019m interested in is the one that connects this office to our flat. That\u2019s the circuit I want to make work.\u201d\n\nTears she hadn't known were left welled in her eyes, blurring his face into a soft, indistinct shape. She gave a shaky, watery laugh. \u201cIt\u2019s a complicated system,\u201d she warned him, her voice thick. \u201cOld wiring. Prone to short-outs.\u201d He smiled, a real smile this time, the one that reached his eyes and made the whole world seem brighter. \u201cI\u2019m a historian,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m good with old, complicated things.\u201d He squeezed her hand. \u201cCome on,\u201d he said softly. \u201cLet\u2019s go home. I think there\u2019s a plate of cold pasta in the fridge that needs a proper apology.\u201d He led her out of the dusty office, out of the quiet library, and back into the cold, bright light of the day. They walked side-by-side towards her van, not touching now, but connected by a new and fragile understanding. The future was still an unwritten schematic, full of potential problems and unknown variables. But they were facing the blueprint together, and for the first time, Sam believed it was a system they could actually build to last.The drive back to the flat was conducted in a fragile, resonant silence. It was the quiet of a room after a bomb has been defused, the air still thick with the memory of imminent danger. Sam drove, her hands gripping the steering wheel with a tightness that had nothing to do with the traffic. She was in her domain, the cab of her van, a space she could navigate with her eyes closed, but she felt like a novice, uncertain of every turn. Liam sat beside her, his gaze fixed on the passing grey stone buildings, giving her the space she needed. He wasn't withdrawn or angry anymore; he was simply present, a quiet co-passenger on a difficult journey back from the brink. The silence wasn\u2019t empty. It was filled with the things they had said in his small office, the raw honesty and the painful admissions, words that had dismantled them both and were now the only materials they had to build something new.\n\nWhen she unlocked the door to the flat, the space felt different. It was no longer a crime scene, but a convalescent ward. The air was still and heavy, but it was the stillness of recovery, not of absence. Liam followed her in, closing the door softly behind them. His eyes went immediately to the plate of pasta, still sitting on the counter where she had left it. It was the epicentre of the previous night\u2019s disaster, a cold, solid reminder of the hurt. Sam\u2019s first instinct was to grab it and throw it in the bin, to erase the evidence of her failure. But Liam moved first. He walked over to it, picked it up, and looked at it with a kind of mock-sombre expression. \u201cRight,\u201d he said, his voice quiet but steady, breaking the tension. \u201cI think the first order of business is a formal apology.\u201d He turned to face the plate. \u201cOn behalf of the head plumber, I would like to sincerely apologise for your unceremonious rejection. Your services were offered in good faith and were met with unwarranted hostility.\u201d\n\nThe absurdity of the moment, the sheer Liam-ness of it, was a release valve on the pressure that had been building in Sam\u2019s chest for twenty-four hours. A small, watery laugh escaped her. \u201cYou\u2019re a daft bastard,\u201d she whispered, wiping at her eyes with the back of her hand. He looked over at her, his own eyes soft. \u201cIt was a very good macaroni cheese. It deserved better.\u201d He opened the fridge and took out the second portion she had stored away. \u201cAnd I think, as part of the reconciliation process, the guilty party is required to share the meal with the chief engineer. It\u2019s in the new regulations.\u201d Sam watched him as he carefully scraped both portions into a saucepan, his movements gentle and deliberate. He was not just reheating a meal; he was performing a ritual of repair. She found herself moving to the cupboard, taking out two bowls and two forks without a word, her actions a quiet assent. They were starting over, right here, with a plate of cold pasta.\n\nThey ate standing in the kitchen, leaning against the counter, the way you do when you\u2019re too tired to sit at a table. The pasta was a bit dry from being reheated, but it didn\u2019t matter. With each mouthful, they were consuming the argument, digesting the hurt, turning a symbol of their conflict into an act of communion. When they were finished, Liam took her bowl and put it in the sink next to his. \u201cOkay,\u201d he said, turning to face her, his expression serious now. \u201cNew schematic. Rule one. When one of us feels a catastrophic pressure drop coming on, we don\u2019t perform an emergency shutdown. We issue a system-wide alert. A verbal one. No pulling the big red lever and running for the door.\u201d He was speaking her language, fluently and without artifice, and it made her heart ache with a strange and wonderful new feeling.\n\nShe nodded, taking a deep breath. It was her turn. \u201cAye. A yellow flag. Not a full stop.\u201d She looked at him, forcing herself to hold his gaze, to stay present in this difficult, necessary work. \u201cAnd rule two. The other engineer doesn't immediately start looking for jobs on another continent when the yellow flag goes up. We troubleshoot the existing system before we decide to decommission the whole site.\u201d His mouth quirked into a small, sad smile. \u201cFair enough,\u201d he said. \u201cNo preemptive relocations.\u201d They stood in silence for a moment, the unwritten clauses of their new contract hanging in the air between them: honesty, patience, and the radical decision to trust that the other person would stay and help fix the leak.\n\nAs evening drew in, a semblance of their old routine returned, but it was overlaid with a new, careful tenderness. They watched television, not really paying attention, the low murmur of it a backdrop to their shared quiet. When it was late, Liam stood up and began to gather the wool blanket and the spare pillow from the end of the sofa, his movements hesitant, as if unsure of the protocol. He was preparing his bed on the couch, retreating to his designated space. The sight of it, the familiar ritual of their separation, was suddenly intolerable to Sam. This was the last piece of the old, broken system, a physical manifestation of the wall she had kept between them.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d she said, her voice quiet but firm. He stopped, the blanket in his hands, and looked at her, his expression questioning. She stood up and walked over to him, her heart thumping a heavy, slow rhythm against her ribs. This was the final, rusted-shut valve, and she had to be the one to turn it. \u201cThe bedroom,\u201d she said, the words feeling clumsy and huge. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 warmer in there. And the bed is big enough.\u201d She saw the question in his eyes, the memory of his old excuse. \u201cAnd if it\u2019s too neat,\u201d she added, a faint, shaky smile touching her lips, \u201cthen that\u2019s a problem we can solve. Together.\u201d\n\nHe didn\u2019t say anything. He just looked at her, and in his eyes she saw the full, staggering weight of what she was offering. It wasn\u2019t about a place to sleep. It was about granting him full access, about tearing down the last barricade of her fortress and handing him a key to the keep. He slowly folded the blanket and placed it back on the arm of the sofa, a quiet, deliberate act of acceptance. He reached out and took her hand, his fingers lacing through hers, warm and solid. It wasn\u2019t a triumphant or passionate gesture. It was a silent agreement, a new contract signed and sealed. That night, for the first time, there was no closed door between them. In the quiet darkness of her bedroom, the sound of his breathing beside her was not an intrusion, but the steady, reassuring hum of a system finally, completely, brought online.Waking up was a slow, disorienting process. Sam\u2019s first conscious thought was one of warmth, a deep, radiating heat along her entire left side that was not coming from a radiator. The second was the unfamiliar weight of an arm draped loosely over her waist, and the third was the scent of him\u2014a clean, sleepy smell mixed with the faint, lingering aroma of her own laundry soap\u2014on her pillow. Her eyes snapped open. For a heart-stopping second, primal instinct took over, the intruder alert that had been her lifelong companion. But then memory flooded in, warm and steadying, and the tension in her shoulders eased for the first time she could remember upon waking. Liam. He was here. In her bed. He was still fast asleep, his face half-buried in the pillow, his breathing a soft, rhythmic puff against her neck. The sight of him, so peaceful and unguarded in the pale morning light, was both terrifyingly vulnerable and deeply, profoundly right. She lay perfectly still, afraid to move, afraid to break the spell. This was the epicentre of the risk she had spent her life avoiding, and yet, lying here in the quiet intimacy of the dawn, it felt like the safest place in the world.\n\nThe days that followed were a quiet education in the art of sharing a space. The silent, solitary routines that had been the bedrock of Sam's life were gently, irrevocably altered. Mornings were no longer a mad dash from bed to van, but a slow dance in the small kitchen, a choreography of two bodies navigating around each other to reach the kettle or the toaster. She discovered he was not a morning person, that he navigated the first twenty minutes of his day in a state of near-silent hibernation, and she found a strange, protective pleasure in handing him his first cup of coffee without speaking, a shared ritual that needed no words. He, in turn, learned to read the subtle language of her moods, to know when the frustration of a difficult job required a quiet offer of tea and twenty minutes of silence, and when the satisfaction of a fix well done could be met with questions and praise. Her flat, once a sterile extension of her van\u2014a place for sleep and basic maintenance\u2014began to transform. A second, slightly lopsided reading lamp appeared by the armchair. A pot of basil, bought by Liam on a whim, now sat on the kitchen windowsill, its fresh, peppery scent a startling new addition to the air. Her fortress was becoming a home, and the change was happening not with a bang, but with the quiet, incremental accumulation of a shared life.\n\nOne evening, about a week after their great reconciliation, they were sitting at the dining table, the remnants of a simple dinner pushed to one side. Sam was sketching out a complex pipe-run for a new job, her pencil moving with quick, sure strokes. Liam was reading, but she could feel his attention wasn't entirely on the page. Finally, he closed his book with a soft thud. \"Right,\" he said, his voice casual but deliberate. \"System-wide alert.\" Sam\u2019s hand stilled, her pencil hovering over the paper. She looked up, her heart giving a small, nervous flutter. This was it. The first test of their new regulations. She met his gaze, forcing herself to stay open, to not retreat into the safety of her schematics. \"Go ahead,\" she said, her own voice quiet. \"What's the pressure reading?\" He took a breath. \"The London conference. It's in three weeks. I have to book my train and my accommodation. My professor is expecting me to go.\" He laid the facts on the table, a clear, unvarnished statement of a logistical reality. There was no hidden meaning, no threat. It was just a problem to be solved.\n\nSam looked at him, at the open, honest expression on his face, and felt the old, reflexive fear begin to rise\u2014the fear of being left, the fear of the separate lives they led. But this time, something else rose with it: the memory of his hurt face in his office, the echo of Mrs. Baird\u2019s words, the solid weight of his hand in hers. She was a fixer. She didn\u2019t run from the job. \"Right,\" she said, putting her pencil down decisively. \"London.\" She thought for a moment, her pragmatic mind clicking through variables. He would go. He would be in a different city, surrounded by his world, and she would be here, in hers. The distance felt vast and unbridgeable. And then, a new, wild thought occurred to her, a solution so radical and unlike her it was almost laughable. It was a complete system overhaul, not a minor repair.\n\n\"What if I came with you?\" The words were out before she had fully processed them, a spontaneous and terrifying leap of faith. Liam stared at her, his eyes wide with surprise. \"You? To London?\" He wasn't questioning her right to come; he was simply stunned by the offer. \"You hate crowds. You hate cities. You said yourself you've never been further south than Newcastle.\" \"Aye, well,\" she said, a nervous energy thrumming through her. \"Maybe it's time I did. You're always showing me your world in here,\" she gestured around the flat, at his books and his laptop. \"Maybe I should come and see it for real. See what all the fuss is about.\" A slow, brilliant smile spread across Liam's face, a look of such profound joy and relief that it made her breath catch. He saw what she was offering. It wasn't just a trip; it was a choice. It was her willingly stepping out of her fortified town and into the unknown, because he was there. \"Sam,\" he said, his voice full of wonder. \"I would love that. More than anything.\" He reached across the table and took her hand, his grip warm and sure. \"Okay,\" he said, his smile turning into a determined grin. \"Okay, then. Operation London. Let's start troubleshooting.\" That night, instead of her usual plumbing catalogues, Sam found herself looking at train schedules and hotel websites, the unfamiliar names of London Underground stations looking like a complex and baffling new schematic. It was daunting. It was terrifying. But as Liam leaned over her shoulder, pointing out a hotel that was \"a bit grim but cheap and near the conference centre,\" she didn't feel alone. She felt like part of a team, about to embark on their most complicated job yet.The journey south was a steady, rhythmic assault on Sam\u2019s sense of control. She was a creature of the road, but her own road, in her own van, a self-contained world where she governed the speed, the route, and the radio station. The train was a different beast entirely. It was a metal tube hurtling through a landscape that blurred into an incomprehensible smear of green and grey, its speed dictated by an unseen driver and an unknowable schedule. She sat stiffly by the window, her hands clasped in her lap, watching the familiar, rugged contours of Scotland flatten into the neat, patchwork fields of northern England. It felt like a dilution, a weakening of the world she knew. Liam sat beside her, blissfully engrossed in a dense academic journal, his calm a stark contrast to the frantic monologue of anxieties running through her head. He would occasionally look up, catch her eye, and smile, a simple, reassuring gesture that was the only thing keeping the pressure gauge of her unease from red-lining.\n\nTheir arrival at King\u2019s Cross Station was not so much an arrival as an expulsion. The moment they stepped from the train, they were swept into a human current, a relentless tide of bodies and noise and frantic, unfocused energy. The scale of it was obscene. The station\u2019s vast, arched roof soared above them, but instead of creating a sense of space, it seemed to trap the thunderous roar of announcements, the screech of train brakes, and the echoing cacophony of a thousand simultaneous conversations. The air was thick with the smells of diesel, fast food, and a kind of generalised, urban grime. Sam felt her shoulders instinctively hunch, her personal space, which normally extended to the perimeter of her van, shrinking to the thin layer of her jacket. Liam, navigating the chaos with an ease that baffled her, grabbed her hand, his grip a solid, grounding anchor. \"Welcome to London,\" he shouted over the din. \"First, we brave the Underworld.\"\n\nThe London Underground was a special kind of hell, a complex and hostile system of pipes designed to move people instead of water, and far less efficiently. Sam, who could visualise the entire plumbing schematic of a three-storey hotel in her head, felt a dizzying sense of incompetence as she stared at the baffling, multicoloured spaghetti of the tube map. They were crammed into a carriage so tightly that she could feel the breath of the man standing behind her on her neck. The carriage swayed and screeched, plunging into a roaring darkness that was absolute. It was her worst nightmare: a cramped, dark, enclosed space that she had no understanding of and no power to fix. She focused on Liam\u2019s hand, the one solid point in a universe of suffocating chaos. He seemed to sense her rising panic, squeezing her fingers gently. \"Two more stops,\" he murmured, his voice a low, calm presence in her ear. When they finally surfaced, gasping, into the grey, drizzly light of a Bloomsbury street, Sam felt as though she had survived a near-death experience.\n\nThe hotel was exactly as Liam had advertised: grim. It was a tall, narrow building wedged between a fried chicken shop and a betting office, with a faint, dispiriting smell of damp and stale cigarette smoke in the hallway. Their room was tiny, with a sagging double bed, a single chair, and a window that looked out onto a brick wall. A persistent, rhythmic dripping sound was coming from the bathroom. Liam surveyed the room with a wry smile. \"It's not the St Andrews clubhouse, is it?\" he said. Sam, however, felt a strange sense of relief. She dropped her bag and went straight into the bathroom, her eyes immediately finding the source of the drip: a faulty washer in the hot tap of the tiny, stained basin. Her hands itched for her tools. This, she understood. This was a problem with a solution. \"The water pressure's abysmal,\" she announced, her voice filled with a professional authority that made her feel instantly more grounded. \"And this window isn't sealed properly. You can feel the draught.\" Liam laughed, a genuine, delighted sound. \"Of course,\" he said. \"Of course that's the first thing you notice. I knew you'd be fine.\"\n\nThat evening was the conference reception, held in the grand, echoing hall of a university building. Sam stood beside Liam, a glass of warm white wine in her hand, feeling like a faulty component wrongly installed in a high-end system. She had worn the black dress again, but here, surrounded by women in smart, academic-chic outfits and men in tweed jackets with leather elbow patches, it felt less like a choice and more like a surrender. The air was thick with the murmur of intellectual one-upmanship, a complex ballet of names, theories, and publications she didn't understand. Liam was a natural, moving through the crowd with an easy grace, introducing her to colleagues who would smile politely, ask her a vague question, and then immediately turn back to Liam to continue their intense debate about fourteenth-century shipping manifests. She felt invisible, an accessory, a silent plus-one in a world that had no language for what she did.\n\nThe moment she had been dreading arrived in the form of a tall, silver-haired man with a condescending smile and a name badge that read \u2018Dr. Alistair Finch\u2019. He had been holding court with Liam for several minutes, completely ignoring her presence. Finally, as if noticing her for the first time, he turned his watery gaze on her. \"And what about you, my dear?\" he asked, his tone that of a man trying to make conversation with a particularly slow child. \"Are you also in the field? A fellow historian, perhaps?\" Sam took a small sip of her terrible wine, the tartness a welcome jolt. The old Sam would have mumbled something vague and faded into the background. The new Sam, the Sam who had survived the Underground and diagnosed a faulty tap washer, looked him straight in the eye. \"No,\" she said, her voice clear and carrying in a momentary lull in the conversation. \"I'm a plumber.\"\n\nThe word landed in the middle of their little circle like a lump of lead. Dr. Finch blinked, his condescending smile faltering as he tried to process this unexpected data. \"A\u2026 plumber?\" he repeated, as if she had just claimed to be an astronaut. Before he could formulate a suitably dismissive response, Liam stepped closer, putting a proprietary arm around her shoulders. He didn't look embarrassed or flustered. He looked proud. \"Yes,\" Liam said, his voice warm and firm. \"Sam's the best plumber in Fife. She\u2019s an expert in catastrophic soil stack failures and high-pressure heating systems. She keeps St Andrews running. It's a far more important job than arguing about the price of wool in 1483, isn't it?\" He smiled directly at Dr. Finch, a bright, challenging smile that left the academic momentarily speechless. Sam felt a surge of warmth spread through her chest, a feeling so powerful it almost made her dizzy. He wasn't just defending her; he was celebrating her, right here, in the heart of his world.\n\nBack in the grim hotel room, the adrenaline of the evening wore off, leaving Sam feeling drained and hollowed out. She kicked off the uncomfortable shoes and peeled off the black dress with a sigh of relief, pulling on a comfortable, worn t-shirt and a pair of tracksuit bottoms. She felt like she had been acting a part for hours, and the performance had exhausted her. Liam was watching her, his expression thoughtful. \"You were amazing tonight,\" he said, coming to sit on the edge of the sagging bed beside her. \"The look on Finch's face. It was priceless.\" \"I felt like a spare part,\" she confessed, her voice low. \"Like a spanner at a tea party. I don't belong in that world, Liam.\" He didn't contradict her. He just nodded, accepting her feeling. \"Maybe not,\" he said. \"But you belong in my world. And my world was in that room tonight. That makes it your world too. You weren't a spare part. You were the anchor. The whole time, I just kept looking at you and thinking, 'She's the realest person in this entire building.'\"\n\nHe reached out and took her hand, his fingers lacing through hers. \"It's a two-way system, remember? You came here, into this place that\u2019s so alien to you, for me. That's a bigger deal than any conference.\" He leaned in and kissed her, a slow, gentle kiss that tasted faintly of cheap wine and had nothing to do with performance or pretence. It was a kiss that said, *we are here, together, and that is all that matters*. Later, as they lay in the lumpy bed, listening to the unfamiliar city sounds\u2014the distant wail of a siren, the rumble of a late-night bus, the incessant drip from the bathroom tap that Sam had mentally scheduled for repair\u2014she felt a profound shift within her. For years, home had been a place, a fortress with a single occupant. But lying here, in a grim, draughty room in a city she hated, wrapped in the arms of the man who saw her for exactly who she was, she finally understood. Home wasn't a set of coordinates on a map. It wasn't bricks and mortar. It was the steady, rhythmic sound of his breathing in the dark beside her. It was a portable system, and as long as they were connected, it would work anywhere.",

                                        "text": "The smell was the first clue. Not the honest stink of a blocked drain, a smell Samantha knew with the kind of intimacy a chef has for garlic, but something richer, more offensive. It was the smell of old money and festering secrets, rising from the guts of the St Andrews clubhouse. She heaved her toolbox onto the pristine tartan carpet of the lobby, ignoring the pinched face of the club manager, a man whose moustache seemed to be held up by sheer indignation.\n\n\"The blockage is in the main men's locker room, I believe,\" he said, his voice a tight, reedy thing. \"It's\u2026 rather unpleasant.\"\n\n\"Aye, they usually are,\" Sam replied, her accent thick as porridge, a deliberate tool she used to put men like him on the back foot. She wore her work, the grime under her fingernails and the faint scent of copper and flux that clung to her overalls, like a declaration. I am a plumber. I fix what you break. Deal with it.\n\nShe pushed through the polished oak doors and the smell hit her full force. A tide of raw sewage had backed up through the floor drains, sullying the gleaming tiles and lapping at the mahogany lockers. A few members, men in their sixties with faces like pink, boiled hams, stood at a safe distance, their pastel Pringle jumpers a jarring splash of colour against the brown-grey filth.\n\nSam dropped to a crouch, her eyes scanning the layout, her mind already a blueprint of pipes and junctions. This was her world. Not the sweeping green fairways outside, but the dark, cramped, and vital underworld that made it all function. She could see the problem already. A catastrophic failure in the main soil stack, probably choked with things that had no business being there. Wet wipes. Golf balls. The hubris of the wealthy.\n\n\"Need a hand with that?\"\n\nThe voice came from beside her. It was quiet, without the panicked edge of the other members. She glanced over. He was young, maybe early twenties, leaning against a locker just beyond the edge of the filth. He wasn't wearing a Pringle jumper. Just a simple grey t-shirt and worn jeans. His hair was a messy thatch of dark curls, and his eyes, a startling shade of blue, held a sort of amused curiosity. He was one of the caddies, she guessed. They had a different air about them. Less entitlement, more observation.\n\n\"I'm fine,\" she grunted, pulling a heavy wrench from her box. \"Unless you fancy a paddle.\"\n\nHe chuckled, a low, pleasant sound. \"Tempting. But I think I'll leave the heroics to the professional.\" He didn't leave, though. He just watched, his arms crossed. It was unnerving. Men usually did one of two things when she was on a job: they either ignored her completely or they offered useless advice, peering over her shoulder like she was a curious roadside accident. This one just\u2026 watched.\n\nShe found the access panel and wrenched it open. A fresh wave of stench billowed out. One of the members made a gagging sound. Sam just took a deep breath through her mouth and peered into the darkness with her headlamp. \"Aye,\" she muttered to herself. \"There you are, you bastard.\" A thick, greasy clot of who-knows-what, jammed tight where the four-inch pipe met the main drain.\n\n\"Find the monster?\" the caddy asked.\n\n\"Something like that.\" She started to work, the muscles in her arms and back straining as she fought with a rusted-on joint. The clubhouse was silent now, save for her grunts and the metallic clang of her tools. The manager and his members had retreated. Only the caddy remained. After ten minutes of sweat and swearing, the joint gave way with a great groan of tortured metal. She worked quickly then, her hands sure and practiced, feeding a heavy-duty auger into the pipe. The coiled steel screeched against the cast iron, a sound that grated on the ears of anyone but her. To Sam, it was the sound of progress.\n\nFinally, with a sickening lurch, the clog broke free. A great whoosh and gurgle echoed through the pipes as the backed-up water began to drain, pulling the filth on the floor with it. A slow, brown whirlpool formed over the drains.\n\n\"Victory,\" the caddy said softly.\n\nSam sat back on her heels, wiping a smear of something vile from her cheek with the back of her gloved hand. She was sweating, her hair stuck to her forehead, and she probably smelled worse than the drain itself. She looked at him. He was still smiling, not a mocking smile, but one of genuine appreciation.\n\n\"You're very\u2026 methodical,\" he said, searching for the word. \"It's like watching someone solve a puzzle.\"\n\nNo one had ever called her work methodical before. They called it dirty, smelly, a man's job. \"It's just pipes,\" she said, starting to pack her tools, the clatter echoing in the now-draining room.\n\n\"I'm Liam,\" he said, pushing himself off the locker and extending a clean hand.\n\nShe looked at his hand, then at her own filthy, gloved one. She just nodded. \"Sam.\"\n\n\"Well, Sam,\" he said, retracting his hand without a hint of awkwardness. \"The least I can do for saving the club from drowning in its own effluent is buy you a cup of tea. Or something stronger. My shift's done.\"\n\nSam paused. She never drank with clients. She never mixed work with anything else. Her life was a series of neat, separate pipes: work, her small flat, the quiet pint by herself at The Dunvegan. They didn't cross. They weren't supposed to. But his eyes were a very clear blue, and his smile didn't seem to have any hidden angles.\n\n\"I'm not really dressed for the clubhouse bar,\" she said, gesturing to her overalls.\n\n\"God, no,\" he laughed. \"I wouldn't inflict that on you. There's a pub down the street. Full of actual human beings.\"\n\nAgainst her better judgement, a small smile touched her lips. \"Aye, alright,\" she said. \"Give me twenty minutes to pack up and talk to the man with the moustache.\"\n\nThe pub was everything the clubhouse wasn't. It was dark and loud, smelling of spilled beer and frying onions. It was real. Liam had found a small booth in the corner, and a pint of Guinness and a whisky chaser were waiting for her when she arrived, having washed her hands and face in the clubhouse's now-functional bathroom.\n\n\"A bit presumptuous,\" she said, sliding into the booth, \"but you got it right.\"\n\n\"You looked like a whisky lass,\" he said, raising his own pint. \"To a successful unblocking.\"\n\nThey drank. He asked her about plumbing. And not in the condescending way. He asked about the pressure, the physics of it, the history of the pipes under a town as old as St Andrews. He told her he was studying history at the university, that caddying paid for his books and beer. He talked about the golf course not as a series of holes and scores, but as a living landscape, sculpted by time and weather.\n\n\"You should let me take you out,\" he said, after their second pint. \"On the course, I mean. For a round.\"\n\nSam snorted into her whisky. \"You're joking. Hitting a wee ball with a stick? It's a daft way to ruin a good walk.\"\n\n\"That's what people who've never played say,\" he challenged, his eyes twinkling. \"I'll be your caddy. I'll carry your bag. I'll teach you. No charge.\"\n\n\"I don't have clubs. Or the daft clothes.\"\n\n\"We can rent clubs. And you can wear what you want. I want to show you what I see out there.\"\n\nIt was a ridiculous idea. Her, Samantha the Plumber, on the hallowed turf of the Old Course. But the whisky was warm in her belly, and the earnestness in his face was disarming. He wasn't trying to impress her. He was trying to share something. It was a feeling she wasn't used to.\n\n\"One round,\" she said, holding up a single, still-not-entirely-clean finger. \"And if I hate it, you have to come and help me flush a sewage line.\"\n\nLiam laughed, a full, open-throated laugh that made the man at the next table look over. \"You have a deal, Sam,\" he said. \"A binding contract.\"\n\nA week later, she found herself standing on the first tee of the Jubilee course, feeling more out of place than she had in the sewage-filled locker room. The sky was a vast, moody grey, the North Sea a churning line of white in the distance. The wind whipped at her jeans and pulled strands of her ponytail loose. Liam stood beside her, a bag of rented clubs on his shoulder. He'd been right. No one seemed to care that she was wearing jeans and a scruffy jumper.\n\n\"Right,\" he said, placing a ball on a tee for her. \"The goal is simple. Just hit the ball.\"\n\nHer first swing was a complete, comical miss. The second topped the ball, sending it dribbling a pathetic ten feet into the rough. She felt a hot flush of embarrassment. This was stupid. She was a plumber. She belonged in cramped, dark spaces with a wrench in her hand.\n\n\"Hey,\" Liam's voice was soft, right by her ear. He came to stand behind her, his body close but not quite touching hers. \"You're trying to kill it. Don't kill it. Just... persuade it.\" He adjusted her grip, his fingers warm over hers. \"And your shoulders are all tense. Loosen up. Breathe the sea air.\" His presence was a strange mix of calming and electrifying. She could feel the warmth of his chest near her back, smell the faint, clean scent of his laundry soap mixed with the salt of the sea.\n\nHe guided her through the motion, a slow, fluid swing. \"Like that,\" he whispered. \"Easy.\"\n\nShe stepped back to the ball, took a breath, and tried to replicate the feeling. This time, there was a solid, satisfying *thwack*. The ball soared into the air, a small white speck against the grey sky, before landing in the middle of the fairway. It wasn't a long shot, not by a golfer's standards, but to her, it was a miracle.\n\nShe turned to him, a grin spreading across her face, wide and unbidden. He was already smiling.\n\n\"See?\" he said. \"You're a natural.\"\n\nThey didn't keep score. They didn't really play by the rules. The game was an excuse. An excuse for him to walk beside her on the springy turf, pointing out the subtle dips and rises of the land, explaining how a caddy reads the unseen contours of the green. He spoke about the gorse, the tough, prickly shrub that burst into brilliant yellow in the spring, and the way the wind, the single greatest player on any links course, could turn a simple shot into an impossible challenge. He made her see it not as a manicured park, but as a wild, beautiful piece of coastline that just happened to have flags on it.\n\nAnd she, in turn, found herself talking. She told him about the satisfaction of soldering a perfect joint, of bringing water and heat back to a cold house. She described the strange archaeology of her job, pulling ancient, Victorian pipes from behind modern plasterboard. He listened. He actually listened, his blue eyes fixed on her, making her feel like the most fascinating person in the world.\n\nBy the eighteenth hole, as the light began to fade and the sky turned a soft, bruised purple, something had shifted. The carefully constructed walls around her, the separate pipes of her life, had started to corrode. Standing there, with the wind in her hair and the smell of the sea and the damp earth all around her, she felt a crack appear in her solitary world. And through that crack, a new and terrifying light was beginning to shine. It was the light from Liam\u2019s eyes. When he took the driver from her hand, his fingers brushed against hers, and this time, the contact lingered for a second too long. It was a jolt, more powerful than any mis-wired immersion heater. It was the moment she knew she was in trouble. The kind of trouble she couldn't fix with a wrench."

The air had grown cold, and Sam found herself walking a little closer to him than was strictly necessary, as if his presence alone generated some kind of warmth. The charged moment on the green had passed, but its energy lingered between them, a low hum beneath the surface of the evening. He carried the heavy golf bag as if it were nothing, his stride easy and long, and she had to quicken her pace slightly to keep up.\n\n\"So,\" he said, as they reached the edge of the car park, the gravel crunching under their feet. \"Was it as daft as you thought?\"\n\n\"It was\u2026 less daft,\" she conceded, the words feeling inadequate. She couldn't explain that the game itself was irrelevant. What she'd remember was the way the sky looked, the feel of the wind, and the sound of his voice explaining the unseen world beneath her feet. \"I still think it's a complicated way to go for a walk.\"\n\nHe laughed, stopping by a small, beat-up hatchback that looked as out of place in the prestigious car park as she felt. \"Fair enough. I'll take 'less daft' as a roaring success.\" He dropped the golf bag into the boot with a thud and turned to face her. Under the flat, orange glare of a single lamppost, his eyes seemed darker, the blue lost to the twilight. \"I had a really good time, Sam.\"\n\n\"Aye,\" she said, her hands shoved deep in her pockets. \"Me too.\" The admission felt like a confession. This was the point where she would normally make a quick exit, a clean break. Back to her van, back to her life. But she stayed rooted to the spot, held there by the quiet intensity of his gaze.\n\n\"I don't want this to be a one-off,\" he said, his voice dropping a little. \"I'd like to see you again. Somewhere that doesn't involve sewage or golf clubs. Dinner, maybe?\"\n\nThe word hung in the air between them. Dinner. It was a proper date word. It implied tablecloths and choices and conversation that wasn't buffered by pints of Guinness or the distraction of hitting a ball. It was an escalation. The pipes in her carefully ordered life began to creak and groan under the sudden, unexpected pressure. Her first instinct, the muscle memory of a lifetime of self-preservation, was to find an excuse. Too busy. Wrong part of town. We're too different.\n\nBut she looked at his face, at the open, hopeful expression there, and the excuses died on her lips. For once, she was tired of the safety of her solitude. She was tired of knowing exactly what every day would bring. She wanted to see what would happen if she just opened the valve and let things flow. \"I'd have to wash my hair and everything,\" she said, a weak attempt at her usual deflection.\n\nA slow smile spread across his face, reaching his eyes. \"I'd appreciate that. Here.\" He pulled a crumpled receipt from his jeans pocket and borrowed a pen from his car's glovebox. He scribbled his name and number on the back, the pen scratching in the quiet of the car park. \"No pressure. But I hope you'll call.\"\n\nShe took the small piece of paper. It felt warm from his pocket. His fingers brushed hers again as she took it, and this time the jolt was expected, a familiar and yet still startling current. \"Alright, Liam,\" she said, the name feeling solid and real on her tongue. \"I will.\"\n\nThe drive home was a blur. She navigated the familiar streets of St Andrews on autopilot, her mind replaying the day in a dizzying loop of images: the green of the course, the grey of the sea, the blue of his eyes. When she let herself into her small, second-floor flat, the silence was absolute. It was usually a comforting silence, a welcome buffer against the noise of the world. Tonight, it felt empty. The air was still and smelled faintly of the fish and chips she'd had for dinner two nights ago. There was no salt, no wind, no Liam.\n\nShe dropped her keys in the bowl by the door and kicked off her muddy boots. In the bathroom mirror, her reflection looked windswept and unfamiliar. Her cheeks were flushed from the cold, her hair was a mess, and there was a smudge of dirt on her chin she'd somehow missed. But her eyes looked different. Brighter. She looked at her hands, the hands that could coax a rusted joint into submission or finesse a copper pipe into a perfect angle. They looked clumsy now, holding the flimsy piece of paper with his number on it. She smoothed it out on the side of the sink, a binding contract for a future she hadn't known she wanted until today. A future that was complicated and unpredictable and utterly terrifying. She left the receipt by the sink, a small white flag in her orderly territory, and went to run a bath, wondering if it was possible to wash away a feeling as easily as you could wash away the grime of a long day's work."

Every morning, as she brushed her teeth and scraped her hair back into its functional ponytail, her eyes would snag on it. Liam. The name was written in a quick, confident scrawl. She\u2019d go to work, wrestling with stopcocks in damp cellars and replacing washers in cramped kitchens, the physical reality of her job a welcome anchor. In those moments, with the familiar weight of a Stilson wrench in her hand and the problem clear and solvable in front of her, the receipt and the man it represented seemed like a strange dream. But then she\u2019d be back in her van, the scent of flux and builder's tea filling the cab, and the memory of his smile would surface, unbidden and disruptive. Her life, which had always felt so solid and defined, suddenly seemed full of hairline cracks.\n\nThe following day found her on her back under a leaking sink in a tiny tenement flat near the university. Water dripped with infuriating slowness onto her forehead. The residents, a trio of cheerful, chaotic students, had offered her tea and biscuits and then vanished, leaving a trail of textbooks and empty noodle packets in their wake. It was a world adjacent to Liam\u2019s, and the thought made her fumble with a compression fitting. She was used to being invisible, a functionary who came, fixed, and left. The St Andrews members ignored her out of snobbery; these students ignored her out of youthful self-absorption. Liam hadn\u2019t ignored her. He had watched, and seen. He had seen a puzzle being solved, not just a mess being cleaned. The thought was more distracting than the constant *plink, plink, plink* of water hitting her face.\n\nThat evening, she sat in her worn armchair, the television murmuring unwatched in the corner. She held the receipt in one hand and her mobile in the other. All the arguments against it paraded through her head. He was a kid. A student with a summer job who found the gritty plumber girl a charming diversion before he went back to his real life of lectures and library books. She was a novelty. She imagined the conversation with his friends: \"You'll never guess who I took for a pint, this woman who unblocked the bogs at the club!\" The thought made her stomach clench with a familiar, defensive anger. She was thirty-two years old. Her life was set. She had her work, her flat, her quiet independence. It was a fortress she had built brick by painstaking brick, and she was terrified of letting anyone near the gates, let alone inside. Tossing the receipt in the bin would be so easy. It would be a restoration of order, a plugging of a potential leak before it could cause any real damage.\n\nShe stood up and walked to the bin, her hand poised over the opening. But she didn't drop it. She thought of the eighteenth green, the purple sky, and the earnest look on his face as he talked about the gorse. He hadn\u2019t been trying to impress her; he had been trying to share something. It was the difference between talking at someone and talking with them. She had spent a decade building walls to keep people out, and in a single afternoon, he had simply walked alongside them, pointing out the view. Her solitary life was safe, yes, but it was also unchanging. The same pint at the same pub, the same takeaway on a Friday night, the same echoing quiet when she closed her front door. Suddenly, the safety of it felt less like a fortress and more like a cage. With a curse that was half frustration and half surrender, she turned from the bin and jabbed the numbers into her phone.\n\nHer heart hammered against her ribs as it rang, once, twice. She was about to hang up, her courage failing, when he answered. \"Hello?\" His voice was clear and relaxed, without the questioning tone of someone receiving a call from an unknown number. He must have saved hers. The thought sent a fresh jolt through her.\n\"It's Sam,\" she said, her own voice sounding rough and unfamiliar. \"The plumber.\"\nThere was a pause, and for a horrible second she thought she'd been right, that he was struggling to place her. But then he laughed, a warm, genuine sound that instantly eased the knot in her chest. \"Sam the Plumber! I was hoping you'd call. I was beginning to think my chat was as bad as my golf swing.\"\n\"I've seen your golf swing,\" she said, a smile creeping into her voice. \"It's not that bad.\"\n\"High praise. So, are you calling to take me up on that dinner offer, or do you have another sewage line you need help with?\"\n\"Dinner,\" she said, the word coming out more firmly than she expected. \"As long as it's not somewhere with a dress code involving tartan.\"\nHe laughed again. \"Deal. There's a little Italian place on a back street. The food's good, and the only dress code is 'wear clothes'. Would Friday at eight work for you?\"\nIt was simple. Direct. No games. She agreed, they said their goodbyes, and she ended the call. She stood in the middle of her living room, the phone still in her hand, her pulse thrumming with a potent mix of terror and elation. A binding contract. The deal had been struck. And now, she realised with a fresh wave of panic, she had absolutely nothing to wear.\n\nFriday arrived faster than a leak spreads across a new laminate floor. All day, during a tricky boiler installation that required her full concentration, her mind kept snagging on the evening ahead. She finished the job, packed her tools, and drove home feeling a nervous energy she hadn't experienced in years. In her flat, she surveyed the contents of her wardrobe with a critical eye. It was a sea of practical, durable fabrics: jeans, sturdy jumpers, flannel shirts, and a dozen work t-shirts in varying states of wear and tear. Tucked at the very back was a simple black dress she\u2019d bought for a cousin's wedding three years ago and hadn't touched since. It felt like a costume for a person she wasn't. But it was either that or her best jeans. With a sigh, she pulled out the dress. In the shower, she scrubbed at her hands, trying to banish the last of the grime from under her nails, a task she usually didn't bother with. She let her hair dry loose for once, instead of yanking it back. As she stood in front of the mirror, wearing the black dress, she felt like an imposter. This woman, with her clean hands and soft hair, didn't know the first thing about copper pipe or water pressure. This was someone else. Taking a deep, steadying breath, she grabbed her keys and her jacket. It was just dinner, she told herself. Just a conversation. It wasn't a catastrophic failure in the main soil stack. But as she walked out into the cool night air, she knew this felt infinitely more dangerous."

                                        "text": "The restaurant was called \"La Trattoria\" and was tucked down a cobbled lane that smelled of rain and garlic. It was small and crowded, the warm, noisy interior a stark contrast to the quiet chill of the evening. Every table seemed to be full of laughing students or couples leaning close over flickering candles. For a moment, Sam faltered in the doorway, the urge to turn and flee back to the safety of her van almost overwhelming. This was a world of easy intimacy, of casual connection, and she was an intruder in borrowed clothes. Then she saw him. He was at a small table in the corner, nursing a glass of red wine, his attention on the street outside. He hadn't seen her yet. He looked different here, too. Away from the wild expanse of the golf course, framed by the warm interior of the restaurant, he seemed more solid, more defined. The amused curiosity in his eyes was replaced by a quiet thoughtfulness.\n\nHe looked up then, and his face broke into the smile she was beginning to recognise, a smile that seemed to smooth out all the anxious corners of the world. He stood as she approached, his eyes doing a quick, appreciative sweep of the black dress. \"Wow,\" he said, his voice a low murmur that was just for her amidst the restaurant's clatter. \"Sam the Plumber cleans up well.\" It could have sounded glib from someone else, but from him, it was just a statement of simple, unvarnished pleasure. He pulled her chair out for her, a gesture so unexpectedly gentlemanly that she almost stumbled.\n\n\"Don't get used to it,\" she mumbled, sinking into the chair and placing her jacket on the back of it. She felt clumsy and oversized, her hands, accustomed to the heft of tools, unsure what to do on the white tablecloth. \"This dress has a very limited social calendar.\"\n\n\"Well, I'm honoured to be on it.\" The waiter arrived, and Liam ordered a bottle of the house red without consulting her, but he caught her eye as he did it. 'Is that okay?' his expression asked. She gave a tiny nod, grateful that he had taken charge, that he had spared her from having to make one more decision in this unfamiliar territory. The conversation started slowly, circling around safe topics \u2013 the town, the university, a particularly stubborn boiler she had fought with that day. But Liam, she was discovering, was a patient and skilled excavator of people. He didn't just ask questions; he listened to the answers and then asked better ones.\n\n\"So why plumbing?\" he asked, after they had ordered their food. \"It's not exactly a career they push on you at school, is it?\"\n\nSam swirled the wine in her glass, watching the dark red liquid coat the sides. \"My dad was a plumber,\" she said. It was a fact, simple and unadorned. \"He had his own business. I used to go with him on jobs during the summer holidays when I was a kid. I was small, I could get into the tight spaces he couldn't reach. I liked it.\" She paused, surprised at herself. She hadn't spoken about her father to anyone in years. \"I liked that you could see the problem right in front of you. A leak, a blockage, no heat. And at the end of the day, you'd fixed it. You'd made something work again. It was honest.\"\n\n\"He must have been proud of you, taking over the business.\"\n\nA shadow flickered across Sam's face, brief but definite. \"He died when I was nineteen. A heart attack. The business was just\u2026 gone. I was working in a call centre at the time. Hated it. A few years later, I did my apprenticeship. Started on my own.\" She took a quick sip of wine, the gesture a full stop. That was enough archaeology for one night. She didn't add the rest: the crippling debts her father had left, the struggle of being a woman in a trade that didn't want her, the fierce, lonely pride she'd felt when she finally bought her own van.\n\nLiam didn't push. He seemed to understand that she had offered him a small, fragile piece of her past and that he should handle it with care. \"An honest job,\" he said, nodding slowly. \"I get that. There's an honesty to caddying, too. The course doesn't care who you are or how much money you have. The wind blows the same on everyone. You have to respect it. You have to read what's there, not what you want to be there.\" He looked at her, his blue eyes serious. \"It's a bit like you in that locker room. You weren't panicking about the mess. you were just reading the problem.\"\n\nThe food arrived, steaming plates of pasta that smelled divine, and the intensity of the moment broke. They ate, and he made her laugh, telling her stories about the absurdly wealthy American tourists he caddied for, mimicking their accents and their outrage when a perfectly hit shot was gusted into a pot bunker by the unpredictable Scottish wind. He talked about his studies, about the thrill of holding a 500-year-old document in the university's special collections, feeling the direct, physical link to the past. He made history sound not like a collection of dusty dates, but like a series of overlapping stories, just like the pipes under the town. He wasn't just a student; he was a storyteller. And as she listened, she felt the rigid posture she'd walked in with begin to soften. The black dress felt less like a costume and more like a choice she had made.\n\nAfter they had finished their meal and he had insisted on paying, they stepped back out into the night. The lane was quieter now, the air damp and smelling of the nearby sea. \"Can I walk you home?\" he asked. It wasn't a question of safety; St Andrews was not that kind of town. It was a simple request to prolong their time together. She found herself nodding before she had even thought about it. They walked in a comfortable silence at first, their footsteps echoing on the ancient stones. He didn't take her hand, but his arm brushed against hers as they navigated the narrow pavement, and the contact was a low, steady current running through her.\n\nThey emerged onto a wider street that overlooked the sea. The tide was out, and the vast expanse of the West Sands stretched out under a sliver of moon, the distant waves a rhythmic shushing sound. They stopped, leaning against the old stone wall that separated the town from the beach. \"I still can't believe you'd never been on the course,\" he said, looking out at the dark silhouette of the clubhouse in the distance. \"Living here your whole life.\"\n\n\"My world was under the course, not on it,\" she replied, turning to look at him. In the faint moonlight, the planes of his face were softer, his expression unreadable. \"We're from different sides of the wall, you and me.\"\n\n\"It's the same wall, though,\" he said, turning to face her fully. He was closer now, close enough that she could feel the warmth radiating from him, could see the slight curl of his eyelashes. \"We're just looking at it from different directions.\" He raised a hand, and for a second, she thought he was going to touch her cheek. Her entire body tensed, bracing for an impact she wasn't sure she could withstand. But his hand went to a stray piece of her hair that the wind had whipped across her face, gently tucking it behind her ear. His fingers were warm against her skin, and the simple, tender gesture did more to dismantle her defences than a battering ram ever could. Her breath caught in her throat.\n\n\"Sam,\" he whispered, and her name on his lips was both a question and a statement. He leaned in slowly, giving her every opportunity to pull away, to rebuild the wall. She didn't. Her eyes fluttered shut, and then his lips were on hers. It wasn't a forceful kiss. It was soft, questioning at first, then deepening as she responded, a silent and astonishing communication. It was the taste of red wine and the cold, salt tang of the sea. It was the yielding of a rusted-on joint, the terrifying, exhilarating release of pressure that had been building for a lifetime. When he finally pulled back, they were both breathless. He rested his forehead against hers, his thumbs stroking her arms.\n\n\"So much for different sides of the wall,\" he murmured, his voice husky.\n\nSam couldn't speak. She could only feel the thrumming in her blood, the echo of the kiss on her lips, and the catastrophic, wonderful, terrifying realisation that the foundations of her carefully built, solitary world had just been irrevocably shaken. This wasn't a leak. This was a flood."

                                        "text": "The walk back to her flat was a disorienting journey through familiar streets that no longer felt entirely her own. She was acutely aware of the cold air on her lips, the lingering warmth where his forehead had rested against hers, the ghost of his touch on her arm. When she finally closed her front door behind her, the silence of her flat was different. It wasn't the comfortable, restorative quiet she was used to; it was a hollow, ringing silence, amplifying the frantic thrumming of her own pulse. She leaned against the door, her eyes closed, feeling the solid wood against her back as she tried to anchor herself. But the world had tilted on its axis, and she was adrift in the strange new gravity of his kiss. She didn't sleep well. Her mind, usually a clean blueprint of the next day's work, was a chaotic jumble of sensations: the taste of wine, the sound of the sea, the startling blue of his eyes in the moonlight.\n\nThe next morning, the shrill alarm felt like an assault. She swung her legs out of bed and the cold floorboards on her bare feet were a familiar, grounding shock. In the bathroom, she caught her reflection and paused. She looked the same\u2014her hair a tangled mess, sleep still clouding her eyes\u2014but something was different. A vulnerability lingered around her mouth. The woman in the mirror looked like she had a secret. Beside the sink, the crumpled receipt from the pub lay where she\u2019d left it, a relic from a different era. An era before the flood. She picked it up, smoothed it out one last time, and then, with a decisive finality, she folded it neatly and tucked it into the pocket of a clean pair of jeans. It was no longer an accusation; it was evidence.\n\nWork was a bathroom installation in a new-build house on the edge of town. It should have been a straightforward job: clean pipes, modern fittings, easy access. It was the kind of work she could usually do on autopilot, her hands moving with an intelligence of their own. But today, her focus was shot. Her mind kept drifting from pipe diameters to the exact cadence of his laugh. While soldering a joint on a copper feed to the new shower, her concentration lapsed for a fraction of a second. A blob of molten solder dripped and hissed on the floorboard, narrowly missing her boot. She swore, snatching her hand back, the smell of burnt flux filling the air. It was a rookie mistake, a lapse she hadn't made in years. She was a professional. She fixed what was broken. But now, she felt like a collection of loose fittings, rattling around with no clear purpose, a system on the verge of a critical failure. The job took her two hours longer than it should have, her frustration mounting with every misplaced washer and overtightened nut.\n\nShe was packing her tools away, her body aching with a weariness that was more mental than physical, when her phone buzzed in her pocket. She pulled it out, her heart giving a stupid, traitorous leap when she saw the unknown number. But it wasn't a number; it was a name. *Liam*. He must have saved her number when she called. The thought sent another unexpected current through her. With a greasy thumb, she opened the text. *Hope you made it back okay. The sea wall is my new favourite spot in town.* It was simple, light. It didn't demand anything. But the reference to their shared moment, to the place where he had kissed her, was as direct as a plumb line. Her mind raced. What was the protocol for this? What did you say the day after your carefully ordered world had been turned upside down by a student caddy with kind eyes?\n\nHer first instinct was to ignore it. To leave him waiting, to reclaim some of the power she felt she had lost. It was the safe move, the one that kept her behind the wall. She could retreat into the familiar silence, and eventually, the memory would fade, becoming just another strange story to file away. But the thought of that silence, which had been her comfort for so long, now felt like a punishment. She thought of his laugh in the pub, the intent look on his face as he explained the history of a patch of grass, the gentle way he\u2019d tucked her hair behind her ear. He wasn't a threat to be managed; he was an offer being made. She typed a reply, deleted it. Typed another. Too keen. Deleted. Finally, she settled on something that felt like her. It was gruff, a little defensive, but it was an answer. It was an open valve.\n\n*Aye, I got back. Don't go getting sentimental about a wall. It's just stones.*\n\nShe hit send before she could second-guess it, her thumb hovering over the screen. It felt like cutting a live pipe\u2014risky, unpredictable, with a high chance of making a mess. A minute later, her phone buzzed again. Her breath hitched.\n\n*You're right. It's the company that makes the spot. When can I see you again?*\n\nHis directness was a counterpunch to her deflection, cutting straight through her practiced defenses. It left her with nowhere to hide. A slow smile spread across her face, a genuine, unforced thing that made her tired eyes crinkle at the corners. She was in trouble. The kind of trouble she couldn't fix with a wrench. And for the first time in a very long time, she didn't want to fix it. She wanted to see how bad the leak would get."

                                        "text": "Leaning against the side of her van, the metal cool against her back, Sam stared at his last message. *When can I see you again?* It was a question that bypassed all her carefully laid tripwires and went straight for the main fuse box. There was no ambiguity, no room for misinterpretation or tactical retreat. She felt the corner of her own mouth lift in a reluctant smile. He fought fair, she had to give him that. Her thumbs, usually so sure and steady as they tightened a compression nut, felt clumsy on the tiny screen. She thought about her schedule, a mental ledger of boilers, sinks, and radiators. It was her shield and her excuse.\n\n*Working Saturday. A kitchen fit. All day.*\n\nIt was a test, and she knew it. It was a statement of fact that doubled as a challenge: This is my life. It isn't pretty or convenient. Take it or leave it. She sent the message and immediately felt a pang of regret, a cold dread that she had finally pushed too far, that she had presented a wall so high and uninviting he would simply turn and walk away. The three dots that signalled he was typing appeared and disappeared twice. Then, the reply came through, and it wasn't what she expected at all.\n\n*Perfect. I'll bring lunch. Text me the address. Don't work too hard.*\n\nThe simple, unhesitating acceptance of her reality did more to disarm her than any romantic proclamation could have. He wasn't trying to pull her into his world of manicured greens and ancient libraries; he was offering to step into hers, with sandwiches. A wave of something warm and unfamiliar washed through her, unsettling the deep, cold quiet she usually carried within herself. She typed out the address of a small bungalow in a quiet residential street and added, *Don't bring anything with pesto in it.* It was the closest she could get to saying thank you.\n\nSaturday's job was for a Mrs Baird, a woman in her late eighties whose wit was sharper than any of Sam's pipe cutters. Sam had been looking after her plumbing for years, drawn in by the old woman's fierce independence and the endless supply of surprisingly good biscuits. The job was a full kitchen sink and tap replacement, a straightforward task of isolating the water, wrestling with the old fittings, and bedding in the new stainless steel unit with a satisfying bead of silicone. Sam worked with a focused rhythm, the familiar motions a balm to her frazzled nerves. As she lay on her back under the cabinet, tightening the final connection on the hot-water feed, Mrs Baird appeared in the doorway, leaning on her walker.\n\n\"You're very quiet today, Samantha,\" she observed. \"Not nearly enough cursing at those old pipes. Are you feeling alright, dear?\"\n\n\"Just concentrating, Mrs B,\" Sam grunted, giving the nut a final, firm twist. \"Don't want to flood your lovely new floor.\"\n\n\"Nonsense. A bit of drama is good for the heart,\" the old woman said, her eyes twinkling. \"Is that young man of yours bringing you a proper lunch? A working girl needs her sustenance.\"\n\nSam froze, the wrench slipping in her hand. \"He's not my 'young man'. He's just\u2026 a lad. Bringing sandwiches.\"\n\n\"A lad who brings a plumber sandwiches is a lad worth keeping an eye on,\" Mrs Baird said sagely, just as the doorbell chimed. \"And there he is. Perfect timing. Do try to wash the sealant off your hands before you eat, dear. It's terribly unladylike.\"\n\nLiam stood on the doorstep, holding a paper bag that smelled deliciously of fresh bread and sausage rolls. He wore the same easy smile, his blue eyes crinkling in the bright sunlight. He didn't seem fazed at all to be standing at the scene of a half-finished plumbing job. Mrs Baird immediately took him in, her shrewd gaze assessing him from head to toe before a slow, approving smile spread across her face. Within minutes, Liam had been charmed into carrying a tray of tea and biscuits out to the small, sun-drenched patio in the back garden, while Sam scrubbed her hands raw at the newly-functional sink. They ate their lunch sitting on the patio steps, the scent of Mrs Baird's roses mingling with the smell of sawdust. He\u2019d brought a flask of hot, sweet tea, just the way she liked it.\n\n\"So this is a day in the life,\" he said, taking a bite of a sausage roll. \"It's\u2026 quieter than I imagined.\"\n\n\"They're not all sewage explosions,\" she admitted, feeling a strange need for him to understand. \"Most of it is just this. Making things work. Giving an old lady hot water for her dishes.\"\n\n\"That's not 'just this',\" he said, his expression serious. \"That's important. It's the stuff life is actually made of.\" He looked around the tidy garden, then back at her, her overalls smeared with dust and a smudge of silicone on her cheek. \"You're good at it. You're good at making things right.\"\n\nWhen the job was done and Mrs Baird had paid her, pressing an extra twenty-pound note into Sam\u2019s hand for \"a trip to the pictures with that lovely boy,\" Sam felt a pang of her usual end-of-day melancholy. This was normally the point where she would retreat into the solitary cocoon of her van and her empty flat. But Liam was still there, leaning against her van, waiting. He had helped her carry the old, heavy ceramic sink out to the driveway without a word of complaint. The simple act of sharing the load, of him taking one side and her the other, felt more intimate than their kiss.\n\n\"Right,\" she said, slamming the van's back doors shut. \"Thanks for the lunch.\" It was a dismissal, the automatic raising of the drawbridge.\n\n\"You're exhausted,\" he stated, ignoring her tone. \"And I'm not letting you go home to an empty flat and a microwave meal. Let's go back to yours, and I'll make you a proper cup of tea. A non-flask-based one.\"\n\nThe suggestion hung in the air. Her flat. Her sanctuary. No client had ever been to her flat. No man had been inside it in over five years. It was the one place that was entirely and exclusively hers, a fortress of solitude and order. The thought of him in her space, in her kitchen, sitting on her sofa, sent a wave of pure panic through her. It was too much, too soon. But then she looked at his face, the genuine concern in his eyes, and the thought of the echoing silence that awaited her at home seemed infinitely more terrifying.\n\n\"I've only got one mug that isn't chipped,\" she said, the words a white flag of surrender.\n\nHe just smiled. \"I'll take my chances.\"\n\nThe journey to her flat was short and silent. She drove, hyper-aware of him in the passenger seat of her cluttered van, a clean, calm presence amidst the chaos of her work life. Standing outside her own front door, key in hand, she hesitated. This was the final barrier. Once she turned this lock, there was no going back. She could feel him waiting patiently behind her, not crowding her, giving her the space to make the choice. With a deep breath that did little to calm the frantic hammering in her chest, she unlocked the door and pushed it open. \"It's not much,\" she said, the apology instinctive.\n\nHe stepped inside and looked around, his gaze taking in the small, obsessively neat living room. There was a single, well-worn armchair, a small sofa, and a bookshelf filled not with novels, but with technical manuals and catalogues, all arranged by size. On the windowsill, a lone succulent stood in a simple pot, green and thriving. He didn't see a lack of decoration or personality. He saw her.\n\n\"It's quiet,\" he said, his voice soft. \"And clean. It's a good place.\" He walked over to the bookshelf and ran a finger over the spines of the manuals. \"It's like your workshop.\" Then he turned to her, his eyes full of a soft understanding that made her throat tighten. \"Can I use your kitchen?\"\n\nShe watched, stunned into silence, as he moved around her small kitchen as if he belonged there, filling her kettle, finding the tea bags, rinsing out the two mugs she pointed to. It was a simple, domestic ballet, and it felt more profound than any grand, romantic gesture. She sank onto her sofa, her limbs heavy with the day's labour, and watched him. When he brought the tea over, he didn't sit in the armchair opposite her. He sat on the sofa, leaving a respectable distance, but still sharing the same space. The silence that settled between them wasn't empty. It was filled with the hum of the refrigerator, the distant sound of traffic, and the quiet, revolutionary presence of another person. She felt the tension she carried perpetually in her shoulders begin to dissolve, draining away like water down an unblocked pipe.\n\nShe must have dozed off, her head eventually lolling to rest against the back of the sofa, because the next thing she knew, the light outside had softened to the orange glow of late afternoon. She blinked, disoriented, and realised Liam hadn't moved. He was just sitting there, reading one of her boiler installation manuals, a small smile on his face. He looked up and saw she was awake.\n\n\"Fascinating stuff, the legal requirements for flue positioning,\" he said, his voice a low, gentle rumble. He hadn't woken her. He had simply let her rest. He had guarded her sleep. She looked at him, truly looked at him, sitting on her sofa, in her flat, in the heart of her life. The panic was gone. In its place was a quiet, terrifying, and overwhelming sense of rightness. The flood had come, it had breached every wall and washed through every room, and she had not drowned. She was floating."

The first thing she registered was the lack of an alarm blaring in her ear. The second was the quiet weight of a day\u2019s exhaustion still settled in her bones, a familiar ache that was somehow less sharp than usual. She blinked, her vision focusing on the familiar cracks in her own ceiling, and then memory came rushing back, not with a jolt, but with the quiet click of a well-seated valve. Liam. He was here. In her flat. Her head turned on the sofa cushion, and there he was, bathed in the soft, forgiving light of the late afternoon, looking utterly at home with a schematic diagram of a combination boiler.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a closed-loop system,\u201d she said, her voice thick with sleep. \u201cThe pressure needs to be between one and one-point-five bar when the system is cold.\u201d\n\nHe looked up from the manual, his mouth quirking into a smile that reached the startling blue of his eyes. There was no surprise, no awkwardness. He simply closed the manual and placed it carefully back on the coffee table. \u201cI think I was just getting to that part,\u201d he said. \u201cYou were out for a good hour. You must have been knackered.\u201d\n\n\u201cLong day,\u201d she mumbled, pushing herself into a sitting position. Her hair was a disaster, and she felt a flush of self-consciousness that was entirely new to her. She, Samantha the Plumber, who had faced down raw sewage and irate club managers without batting an eye, was flustered because a man had seen her sleep. \u201cYou should have woken me.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d he asked, his expression one of genuine curiosity. \u201cYou needed the rest. Besides, I was getting an education.\u201d He gestured to the bookshelf. \u201cIt\u2019s a whole secret language. Flow and return, heat exchangers, diverter valves. It\u2019s fascinating.\u201d\n\nNo one had ever called her work fascinating. Necessary, messy, complicated\u2014but never fascinating. She stood up, needing to move, to do something with the restless energy that was fizzing under her skin. \u201cRight. Well. Tea\u2019s probably cold.\u201d The thought of him leaving now, of the door closing and the silence rushing back in to fill the space he occupied, sent a surprising and unwelcome pang of something that felt dangerously like loneliness through her.\n\n\u201cI was thinking something more substantial than tea,\u201d he said, getting to his feet. He stretched, a lithe, easy movement that made her small living room feel even smaller. \u201cWhat\u2019s the situation in your fridge? I\u2019m a decent cook, but I can\u2019t work miracles.\u201d\n\nThe idea of him cooking in her kitchen, using her pans, was a level of intrusion she couldn\u2019t have imagined tolerating just yesterday. Her kitchen was a functional space for assembling sandwiches and brewing tea, not a place for creation. \u201cThe situation is dire,\u201d she admitted. \u201cThere\u2019s eggs. Some cheese that might be old enough to vote. A tin of beans.\u201d\n\nHe laughed, a full, open sound that seemed to warm the whole room. \u201cEggs and cheese it is. The best omelettes are born from desperation.\u201d He moved towards her kitchen, then paused and looked back at her. \u201cUnless you want me to go?\u201d His sensitivity was a constant surprise, a soft touch on the bruised and calloused parts of her. He was always giving her an out, a clean line of retreat. And for the first time, she had no desire to take it.\n\n\u201cKnock yourself out,\u201d she said, gesturing towards the kitchen with a wave of her hand. \u201cBut if you give me food poisoning, you\u2019re fixing the toilet for free.\u201d\n\nShe watched from the doorway as he navigated the small space with an easy confidence. He found a pan, cracked eggs with one hand, and grated the questionable cheese with a practiced efficiency. It was a simple act, but watching him create sustenance in the heart of her fortress was profoundly intimate. They didn\u2019t talk much. The kitchen was filled with the sizzle of the eggs, the scrape of a spatula, and the quiet sound of two people learning to share a space. He served the omelettes on her two non-chipped plates, and they ate sitting on the sofa, their knees almost touching. It was the best thing she\u2019d eaten all week.\n\nAfter they\u2019d finished, and he had insisted on washing the plates, she found herself talking, the words flowing more easily than they had in years. She told him about Mrs Baird and her surprisingly good biscuits. He told her about his dissertation on the medieval trade routes that had made St Andrews a major port, long before golf was ever imagined. They discovered a shared fascination for the hidden histories of things\u2014the story told by an ancient pipe joint, the tale revealed by a faded ship\u2019s manifest. They were from different worlds, but they were both archaeologists of a sort, digging beneath the surface to understand how things worked.\n\nAs the evening drew in, a comfortable quiet settled over them again. The sky outside the window deepened from bruised purple to inky black. The small lamp in the corner of the room cast a warm, golden glow, making the space feel like a haven against the world. He was sitting at the other end of the sofa, but the space between them no longer felt like a distance to be maintained; it felt like a connection, a tangible line of energy.\n\n\u201cI should go,\u201d he said eventually, though he made no move to stand. \u201cYou\u2019ve got work in the morning.\u201d\n\n\u201cAye,\u201d she said, her voice quiet. The thought of the morning, of the van and the tools and the solitary routine, seemed a world away. He stood up, and she did too, feeling an instinctive pull to keep him there, to stop the moment from ending. They stood by the door, the same way they had stood at the restaurant, but the air between them was different now. The frantic, questioning energy had been replaced by a low, humming certainty.\n\n\u201cI had a really good day, Sam,\u201d he said, his voice low.\n\n\u201cYou made me an omelette and read a boiler manual,\u201d she countered, her default sarcasm a flimsy shield.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d he smiled, a slow, soft smile. \u201cI did. It was one of the best days I\u2019ve had in a long time.\u201d He reached out, not to kiss her, but to gently take her hand. His fingers were long and warm, and they laced through hers with a comfortable familiarity, as if they had done it a hundred times before. He looked down at their joined hands\u2014his, smooth and clean; hers, still bearing the faint lines of ingrained dirt and the small, pale scars of her trade. He lifted her hand and pressed a soft kiss to her knuckles, a gesture of such unexpected tenderness it stole the air from her lungs.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll call you,\u201d he said, his eyes holding hers. It wasn\u2019t a promise to be vetted or a line to be tested; it was a simple statement of intent. He let go of her hand, opened the door, and was gone, leaving her in the quiet of her flat. She locked the door and leaned against it, her hand still tingling from his touch. The silence that filled the room was not empty. It was alive, humming with the echo of his laugh, the memory of his presence. The fortress hadn't just been breached; its resident had willingly left the gate standing wide open. And she realised, with a clarity that was both terrifying and exhilarating, that she had no intention of ever locking it again."

                                        "text": "The weeks that followed were a process of slow, careful acclimation, like a heating system coming online for the first time in winter. There were groans and creaks, unfamiliar noises in the quiet architecture of her life, but gradually, a steady warmth began to spread through rooms she hadn't realised were so cold. The silence in her flat was no longer a void but a space of anticipation, charged with the possibility of a text message or the sound of his footsteps on the stairs. Her life, once a series of straight, unconnected pipes, was becoming a complex and interwoven system, and Liam was the unexpected junction box at its centre.\n\nShe found herself thinking of him at odd moments during the day. While wrestling with a seized stopcock in a damp cellar, she would remember the look on his face as he\u2019d concentrated on her boiler manual and a small, private smile would touch her lips. The world, which she had always viewed in the practical, monochrome tones of a technical drawing, seemed to have acquired new shades of colour. The grey of the North Sea now held hints of blue and silver; the moody sky was a canvas of purple and slate. It was the same world, but she was seeing it through a different lens.\n\nOne afternoon, a text arrived as she was packing up her tools after replacing a radiator in a cramped student flat. The room was a chaotic testament to youthful living\u2014piles of clothes, teetering stacks of books, and half-eaten packets of biscuits that would have made Mrs Baird weep. A few years ago, the mess would have irritated her. Now, it just made her think of Liam. The text was simple: *Come to my other office. I want to show you something.* It was followed by a location pin for the main university library. Her first instinct was a visceral 'no'. The library was the heart of a world that wasn't hers, a hushed temple of intellect where she, with her grease-stained hands and steel-toed boots, would be an unwelcome pagan. But the reflexive fear was weaker now, overlaid by a current of curiosity that was stronger and more compelling.\n\nShe met him outside, feeling deeply conspicuous in her work clothes. He, on the other hand, looked perfectly at home, leaning against the ancient stone archway with a book under his arm. He didn't seem to notice or care about her overalls; he just smiled, took her hand, and led her inside. The change in atmosphere was instantaneous. The air was cool and still, smelling of old paper, floor polish, and a faint, scholarly dust. The silence was a living thing, broken only by the soft rustle of turning pages and the distant cough of a student. Her work boots, which crunched so satisfyingly on gravel, felt clumsy and loud on the polished stone floor, even though they made no sound. She was a wrench in a room full of delicate instruments.\n\nLiam led her away from the main reading room, down a quiet corridor and through a door marked 'Special Collections'. Here, the silence was even more profound. He spoke in a low whisper to a librarian, who nodded and led them to a heavy wooden table. A few moments later, the librarian returned carrying a large, flat archival box. Liam\u2019s eyes lit up with a passion Sam was beginning to recognise\u2014the same passion she felt when she finally sourced a rare part for a vintage boiler. He opened the box with a reverence that was almost religious. Inside, resting on a bed of acid-free foam, was a sheet of thick, yellowed parchment covered in elegant, looping script.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a charter from 1483,\u201d he whispered, his voice full of awe. \u201cGranting trading rights for wool and salt fish to the merchants of the town.\u201d He pointed with a careful finger, not quite touching the surface. \u201cThis is the royal seal. Look at the detail. You can almost see the fingerprint of the man who pressed it into the wax over five hundred years ago.\u201d He brought her closer, showing her the way the iron gall ink had bitten into the fibres of the parchment, the slight imperfections in the lettering. She looked from the ancient document to his face, and saw that for him, this wasn't just old paper. It was a direct line, a physical connection to the past, as real and solid as a copper pipe.\n\n\"It's like the archaeology of the job,\" she said, her own voice a low murmur. \"Sometimes you have to cut through a modern wall and you find the original Victorian leadwork behind it. It's colder, heavier. You can feel the time in it, the hands that shaped it.\" A look of profound understanding passed between them. In that quiet, hallowed room, surrounded by the ghosts of scholars, the plumber and the historian had found their common language. He hadn't just brought her to his world; he had shown her how it connected to hers.\n\nTheir relationship settled into a rhythm. She would join him for a late-night coffee in a student caf\u00e9 after a long job, the smell of solder on her clothes mingling with the aroma of espresso. He would turn up at her flat with fish and chips on a Friday, seemingly unfazed by the fact that she often had to spend the first twenty minutes of their evening on the phone, talking another tradesman through a pressure-loss problem. He learned the difference between a Stilson and a mole wrench; she learned the difference between the Plantagenets and the Tudors. He never questioned the long hours of her work, and she never mocked the arcane focus of his. Their lives, which had seemed so different, were both about understanding the hidden systems that lay beneath the surface of things.\n\nOne bright, windy Saturday, they walked along the West Sands, the tide far out, the beach a vast, empty canvas. A group of young people, laughing and shouting to each other over the wind, spotted Liam and jogged over. They were his friends from his history course, bright and articulate and effervescent with the easy confidence of youth. They were friendly enough to Sam, but their conversation was a rapid-fire volley of shared references to lectures, parties, and people she didn\u2019t know. She stood slightly outside their circle, her hands jammed in her pockets, suddenly feeling every one of her thirty-two years. She felt the scuffs on her boots, the faint lines around her eyes, the invisible weight of a life lived outside the warm, protected bubble of academia. She was Sam the Plumber, an interesting diversion, a story Liam might tell later. The old, familiar chill of the outsider crept over her.\n\nWhen the group finally moved on, calling out cheerful goodbyes, Sam was quiet, her gaze fixed on the distant horizon. Liam took her hand, his thumb stroking the back of it, but she didn't respond. He didn't press her, just walked beside her in the renewed quiet, the only sound the wind and the distant gulls. The easy comfort that had grown between them felt fragile again, threatened by the cold reality of their differences. Back in the warmth of her flat, as she mechanically made them both tea, he leaned against the kitchen counter and watched her.\n\n\u201cYou went somewhere else back there,\u201d he said, his voice gentle. \u201cOn the beach.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust tired,\u201d she said, her stock answer.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t do that,\u201d he said, his tone still soft but firm. \u201cDon\u2019t shut me out. Was it my friends?\u201d She didn't answer, just kept her back to him, busying herself with the kettle. He came to stand behind her, his presence warm and solid. \u201cSam. Talk to me.\u201d\n\nWith a sigh, she turned around, leaning back against the counter. \u201cThey\u2019re kids, Liam. They talk about things I don't know anything about. I\u2019m a decade older than them and I spend my days with my arm down a U-bend. We\u2019re not from the same planet.\u201d The words came out with a raw, bitter edge she hadn't intended.\n\nHe listened, his expression serious. He didn\u2019t offer platitudes or denials. He just nodded, accepting her words, her fear. \u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d he said, and the simple agreement surprised her. \u201cWe\u2019re not from the same planet. But I don\u2019t want to live on their planet. I want to live on the one where you know how to fix things that are broken, and you can see the history in an old pipe, and you have the quietest, most peaceful flat in all of St Andrews.\u201d He reached out and tucked a strand of hair behind her ear, his touch as gentle and certain as it had been on the sea wall. \u201cThey\u2019re my friends. You\u2019re my home.\u201d\n\nThe word hung in the air between them, more solid and real than any charter, more binding than any contract. *Home*. It was a word she had only ever associated with a place, with bricks and mortar. He used it to mean a person. He used it to mean her. The last of her internal walls didn\u2019t just crack; it turned to dust. She stepped forward, into the space he had been holding open for her all along, and wrapped her arms around him, burying her face in the warm fabric of his jumper. He held her tight, a silent, steadying pressure. This wasn't a flood anymore. This was the shore."

                                        "text": "The embrace lingered, a long, silent conversation that said more than words ever could. For Sam, it was like the slow setting of a bone, a painful alignment that finally clicked into place, promising a future of strength instead of a lifetime of compensating for an old break. When they finally separated, the air in the small flat had changed. It was no longer her solitary space, defended against intrusion; it was a shared territory, the lamplight pooling around them in a circle of warmth. He didn't leave. The unspoken question of his departure hung in the air for a moment before dissolving, an irrelevance. He would stay. It was a fact as solid and unadorned as the cast-iron pipes she worked with every day.\n\nShe gave him the spare pillow and a thick wool blanket, and he took the sofa without question or comment. The quiet choreography of preparing for the night in the same small space was a new and unnervingly domestic dance. As she lay in her own bed, the door left slightly ajar, the unfamiliar sound of another person's breathing in the next room was not the threat she would have once imagined. It was a steadying rhythm, a quiet anchor in the dark. It was the sound of not being alone. For the first time in as long as she could remember, she fell asleep without the weight of her own solitary vigilance pressing down on her.\n\nShe woke before dawn, her internal clock set to a plumber\u2019s early start. The flat was shrouded in a pre-dawn grey, and for a moment, everything felt normal. Then she saw him, a long shape under the blanket on her sofa, his dark curls a chaotic spill against her plain pillow. A wave of panic, a ghost of her old self-preservation, flickered in her chest and then died out, starved of the fear that had once sustained it. In its place was a quiet, profound sense of rightness. She moved into the kitchen, her bare feet silent on the lino, and began the familiar ritual of making coffee. But this morning, she took down two mugs. The second one, a novelty mug with a faded cartoon sheep on it left by a previous tenant, had sat at the back of the cupboard for years. Placing it on the counter next to her own chipped favourite felt like a landmark decision.\n\nHe stirred as the coffee was brewing, woken by the aroma. He padded into the kitchen, his hair an even wilder mess than usual, and scrubbed a hand over his face. \"Morning,\" he mumbled, his voice gravelly with sleep. He looked around her kitchen as if seeing it for the first time in the clear morning light. \"Morning,\" she replied, her voice softer than she intended. She pushed the cartoon sheep mug towards him. He looked at it, then at her, and a slow, sleepy smile spread across his face. He understood the gesture, the offering. They drank their coffee in a comfortable silence, the rising sun casting long shadows across the floor. It felt less like the morning after and more like the first morning.\n\n\"Big day today,\" he said, staring into his mug. \"I've got to hand in the first full draft of my dissertation. My supervisor is a demon for deadlines.\" He sighed, a gust of tired, academic stress. \"Another three weeks of this and then... freedom.\" The word hung in the air, full of promise for him and loaded with a sudden, sharp ambiguity for her. Freedom. She looked at him, at the way the morning light caught the blue of his eyes, at how perfectly he seemed to fit in her small kitchen, and a cold knot of a familiar fear began to form in her stomach. Freedom from what? From St Andrews? From the caddying job that had brought him to her? From her? The warmth of the last twelve hours suddenly felt fragile, threatened by the simple, unavoidable fact that his life here had a finish line, and hers did not. She had just found her home, and now she was faced with the terrifying possibility that it was built on a temporary lease.\n\nHer phone buzzed on the counter, a shrill, demanding sound that broke the moment. She glanced at the screen, her professional mask slipping back into place with practiced ease. It was the club manager, the man with the moustache held up by indignation. Her heart didn't sink at the thought of another job; instead, a strange sense of resolve settled over her. This was her world, her reality, the part of her life that was permanent and real. She answered, her voice all business. \"Sam here.\" She listened for a moment, her brow furrowed in concentration. \"Aye. No, a pressure drop that fast isn't a leak, it's a rupture. It'll be in the boiler room, in the main heating circuit for the east wing. I can be there in an hour.\" She ended the call and looked at Liam. He was watching her, his head tilted, an expression of admiration on his face. In his eyes, she wasn't just a plumber; she was a diagnostician, a problem-solver, a commander taking charge. And in that moment, she knew she wouldn't face this new uncertainty by building her walls back up. She would face it by letting him see. \"Fancy another trip to the clubhouse?\" she asked, a challenge in her voice. \"The guts of the place have sprung a leak.\""

                                        "text": "A small, genuine smile touched Liam\u2019s lips, wiping away the last traces of sleep and academic stress. There was no hesitation, no hint of a thought for his precious dissertation draft. \u201cOf course,\u201d he said, as if she had just offered him a second cup of coffee. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t miss it. I\u2019m becoming quite the connoisseur of clubhouse disasters.\u201d The ease of his acceptance, the simple fact that he saw it as an opportunity to be with her rather than an interruption, settled something deep in her chest. The cold knot of fear about his departure didn\u2019t vanish, but it loosened its grip, overshadowed by the immediate reality of his presence.\n\nThe journey in the van was a world away from the silent, solitary trips that defined her working life. Liam sat in the passenger seat, a calm presence amidst the organised chaos of her tools and spare parts, his long legs navigating the cluttered footwell with an uncomplaining grace. He didn't pepper her with questions or offer pointless observations about the traffic. Instead, he just watched the familiar streets of St Andrews slide by, occasionally asking about a particular building, his historian\u2019s curiosity piqued by the different layers of architecture. He was learning her town, not as a tourist or a student, but through her eyes, from the driver's seat of her van. The clubhouse, once the intimidating symbol of a world she observed from the outside, now felt like just another job site, albeit one that held the strange, unlikely origin story of them.\n\nThe scene at the clubhouse was one of barely suppressed panic, a distinct flavour from the sewage incident. There was no foul odour this time, but the air in the lobby was thick with humidity and a sharp, mineral smell of hot, escaped water. A fine mist seemed to cling to the polished wood and tartan carpets, and the pinched-faced manager was now a shade of pale grey that clashed with his mustard-coloured jumper. He was pacing near the main doors, his moustache twitching with agitation, and a low, ominous hissing sound echoed from the corridor that led to the east wing. A few staff members scurried about with buckets and mops, their efforts comically inadequate against the scale of the problem.\n\n\u201cThank God you\u2019re here,\u201d the manager bleated, rushing towards her. \u201cIt\u2019s a deluge! The heating\u2026 it just\u2026 exploded, I think. There\u2019s steam everywhere.\u201d His eyes flickered towards Liam, a flicker of dismissive confusion in his gaze. Sam didn\u2019t give him a chance to ask. \u201cHe\u2019s with me,\u201d she stated, her tone flat and non-negotiable. She heaved her main toolbox onto the floor, the heavy thud cutting through the manager\u2019s frantic energy. \u201cBoiler room?\u201d The manager nodded mutely, pointing a trembling finger down the corridor. \u201cRight. Stay here. Keep everyone out. And turn off the mains water stopcock for the building. Now.\u201d Her voice was pure command, crisp and clear, and the manager, for all his bluster, obeyed without question, scurrying off like a startled rabbit. She looked at Liam, her expression all business. \u201cStay behind me. Don't touch anything metal. And if I tell you to get out, you get out. No arguments.\u201d He just nodded, his eyes serious, his trust in her absolute.\n\nThe corridor was like a tropical rainforest, steam billowing from under a door at the far end, the walls slick with condensation. The hissing grew to a roar as she approached. She pulled on a pair of heavy-duty heat-resistant gloves and cautiously pushed the door open. The boiler room was a vision of chaos. A thick cloud of steam filled the upper half of the room, and a torrent of scalding water was jetting from a huge, rust-coloured pipe near the main circulation pump, hitting the opposite wall and cascading onto the floor. The concrete floor was already inches deep in steaming water. It was a dangerous, violent mess of heat and pressure. This was not a leak; this was a plumbing hemorrhage.\n\nSam\u2019s mind went into a state of cold, clear focus, the panic and noise fading into the background. Her eyes scanned the complex web of pipes, valves, and gauges, a three-dimensional blueprint forming in her head. \"It's the main return from the east wing radiators,\" she shouted to Liam over the din. \"A catastrophic joint failure. Probably corroded from the inside out for years.\" She waded into the hot water, her thick work boots providing some protection, and moved with a sure-footed purpose towards a bank of large, red-handled gate valves on the far wall. \"I need to isolate the circuit.\" She put her wrench on the first valve and threw her weight against it. It didn't budge, rusted solid by years of heat and neglect. She swore, repositioning herself and trying again, the muscles in her back and shoulders straining.\n\n\"Need a hand?\" Liam's voice was right beside her. He had followed her in, his jeans already soaked to the knee, his face beaded with sweat from the intense heat. He looked at the valve, then at her, and seemed to understand immediately. \"You pull, I'll push,\" he shouted. She reset the wrench, and he placed his hands next to hers on the long handle. \"On three,\" she grunted. \"One\u2026 two\u2026 THREE!\" They threw their combined weight into it, a synchronised burst of effort. For a heart-stopping moment, nothing happened. Then, with a great, groaning screech of tortured metal, the valve wheel began to turn. They worked together, grunting with the strain, until the valve was fully closed. The torrent of water from the ruptured pipe lessened, but didn't stop completely. \"There's a secondary loop,\" she gasped, already moving to the next valve. Working as a team, they fought with two more seized valves, their movements falling into an unspoken rhythm of effort and release. Finally, with the third valve closed, the roar from the broken pipe subsided to a gushing hiss, then a trickle, and finally a steaming dribble. The immediate crisis was over.\n\nSam sagged against the wall, breathing heavily, her hair plastered to her forehead. The room was still an oven, the air thick with the smell of rust and hot metal, but the terrifying violence had subsided. Liam was leaning against a pump beside her, equally breathless, his t-shirt soaked through with a mixture of steam and sweat. He looked from her to the now-tamed pipe, a look of profound respect on his face. \"Okay,\" he said, wiping his brow with the back of his arm. \"So that's what a rupture looks like. My dissertation suddenly feels significantly less stressful.\" His attempt at a joke was a welcome release of tension, and Sam felt a genuine laugh escape her.\n\n\"Don't get used to it. I normally charge extra for an apprentice,\" she said, her professional mask returning, though its edges were softer now. She began to assess the damage properly, her mind already calculating the parts, the time, the cost. \"It's a full section replacement. Have to drain the whole system. It'll take me the rest of the day just to make it safe and cap it off.\" Liam didn't leave. He stood by, passing her tools when she pointed to them, holding a heavy-duty torch so she could inspect the corroded joint more closely, his presence a quiet, unwavering support. He was her caddy, here in the dark, cramped, and vital underworld that was her domain.\n\nAs she worked to cut away the damaged section of pipe, the topic of his dissertation came back, unbidden. \"So, three weeks,\" she said, her voice sounding unnaturally loud in the now-quiet room. \"Then you're free. What's the plan? Off to conquer the world of medieval history?\" The question was casual, but it was weighted with the fear she had felt that morning. He stopped what he was doing \u2013 coiling a length of hose \u2013 and looked at her, his expression serious. He had heard what she was really asking.\n\n\"The plan is to sleep for a week, for a start,\" he said, his tone light but his eyes holding hers. \"And then\u2026 I don't know, Sam. The academic job market is a nightmare. I might have to look at posts in Edinburgh, Glasgow\u2026 maybe even down south. It's not like there are a lot of openings for medievalists in St Andrews.\" It was the answer she had been dreading. Her stomach tightened. He was going to leave. He saw the shift in her expression, the slight dimming in her eyes, and he took a step closer, closing the distance between them. \"Hey,\" he said softly. \"That's the 'where'. That's the logistics. That's not the plan. Freedom from the dissertation, Sam. That's all it is. Freedom from the library and my supervisor and footnotes.\" He reached out and gently took the heavy pipe wrench from her hand, setting it down on a nearby ledge. He took her hands, which were grimy and raw, in his. \"I haven't figured out the 'what next' part. But I know who it's with. That's the part of the plan I'm sure about.\""

The drip of water from a dozen cooling pipes, the low hum of the circulation pump, his own breathing\u2014it all faded away, leaving only the quiet, staggering weight of his declaration. Sam stared at their joined hands. His were pale and long-fingered, a scholar\u2019s hands, now smudged with the grime of her world. Hers were calloused and capable, marked with the small nicks and burns of her trade, now held with a tenderness she had never known. The carefully constructed walls of her life, already breached and crumbling, simply dissolved into dust, leaving her standing exposed and utterly vulnerable in the ruins. She couldn\u2019t find the words for a grand reply. Her vocabulary was built of copper and steel, of pressure ratings and flow rates, not this. She swallowed hard, her throat tight, and managed a single, breathy syllable that was both a question and a surrender. \u201cAye?\u201d\n\nThe spell was broken not by him, but by the pragmatic, insistent pull of reality. The manager would be waiting. The system needed to be drained. A hundred practical problems were queuing up, demanding her attention. She gently withdrew her hands from his, the loss of contact a sudden, sharp chill. It was not a rejection, but a reclaiming of her purpose, a necessary retreat to the solid ground of her competence. She cleared her throat, her voice returning to its usual gruff register. \"Right. Well. We've stopped the flood. Now I've got to make sure it doesn't happen again tonight.\" She turned back to the wounded pipework, her focus narrowing once more to the task at hand. The emotional vertigo receded, replaced by the familiar clarity of a solvable problem.\n\nLiam watched her, a soft, knowing smile on his face. He understood. He didn\u2019t push for more words, didn't try to prolong the moment. He simply accepted her pivot back to the practical, recognising it as an essential part of who she was. He picked up the heavy wrench she had set down and held it out to her, not as a challenge, but as an offering. \u201cWhat\u2019s next, boss?\u201d he asked, his tone light, respectful, and deeply affectionate. He had seamlessly shifted from romantic lead to apprentice, and the transition felt perfectly natural. The rest of the work passed in a state of focused teamwork. He anticipated her needs, passing her tools, bracing pipes as she cut them, his presence a steady and reassuring counterpoint to the solitary nature of her usual labour. The boiler room, once a scene of violent chaos, became their shared workshop, a space where the last of the barriers between their worlds was dismantled and reassembled into a new and stronger structure.\n\nWhen they finally emerged, grimy, sweating, and exhausted, into the pristine corridor, the club manager was waiting. He looked from the now-quiet boiler room door to their filth-streaked faces, his earlier panic replaced by a kind of bewildered gratitude. \u201cIs it\u2026 is it fixed?\u201d he asked, his voice a reedy whisper. \u201cIt\u2019s safe for the night,\u201d Sam confirmed, wiping her hands on an already filthy rag. \u201cI\u2019ve isolated the circuit and capped the main line. I\u2019ll need to come back tomorrow with parts. A lot of parts.\u201d The manager nodded, his gaze flicking to Liam, who was quietly loading tools back into Sam\u2019s toolbox. The indignant moustache seemed to have lost some of its starch. \u201cWell\u2026 thank you,\u201d he said, his gaze including them both. \u201cBoth of you. The club is\u2026 very grateful.\u201d It was a small thing, but in the clubhouse of St Andrews, being acknowledged as a unit was a seismic shift.\n\nThe drive back to her flat was filled with a new kind of quiet. It wasn't the silence of strangers or the comfortable quiet of companionship; it was the charged, thoughtful silence that follows a fundamental change. They were both filthy, their clothes damp and smelling of rust. Sam drove, her hands aching on the steering wheel, her mind a churn of pipe diameters and Liam's words. It was she who broke the silence as they neared her street, her voice carefully neutral. \u201cSo. Edinburgh. Glasgow. It\u2019s a long commute for a cup of tea.\u201d She was laying the problem on the table, like a faulty valve, wanting to see all its parts, to understand the mechanics of the challenge ahead.\n\nLiam turned in his seat to look at her, his face streaked with dirt but his eyes clear. \u201cI know,\u201d he said simply. He didn\u2019t offer easy solutions or dismiss her unspoken fears. \u201cI know your business is here. Mrs Baird needs her taps fixed. The clubhouse needs you to save it from itself. Your life is here.\u201d He paused, letting the truth of that settle between them. \u201cSo we\u2019ll figure it out. It's a problem, like a seized valve. We just have to find the right tool. Maybe I can find a research post at the university here. Maybe I commute a few days a week. The point is, we\u2019re figuring it out together now. The plan starts here, with you. The rest is just logistics.\u201d The word \u2018we\u2019 was a balm, a powerful solvent that began to dissolve the hard knot of fear in her gut.\n\nIt was almost ten o\u2019clock when she unlocked her front door. The flat, which had once been her refuge from the world, now felt like a refuge for them both. Without discussion, he went straight to the shower while she ordered a curry from the local takeaway, shouting questions about his spice tolerance through the closed door. An hour later, they were sitting on her sofa, side-by-side, eating chicken tikka masala out of foil containers, both of them clean and dressed in comfortable clothes. He was wearing a spare, ridiculously oversized jumper of hers that she kept for painting, and it looked better on him than it ever had on her. The sheer domesticity of the scene\u2014the smell of curry, the low murmur of the television, his knee occasionally brushing against hers\u2014was more revolutionary to her system than any ruptured pipe.\n\nLater, as she was washing up, he spread his dissertation papers across her small dining table, a sea of footnotes and highlighted text. She watched him from the kitchen, watched as his brow furrowed in concentration, and then as his eyelids began to droop, his battle against exhaustion finally lost. His head drooped, coming to rest on his folded arms, right on top of a chapter about fifteenth-century Scottish wool tariffs. A profound tenderness, fierce and protective, swelled in her chest. She dried her hands, walked over to the sofa, and picked up the old wool blanket she had offered him the night before. Quietly, she draped it over his shoulders. He stirred, a soft murmur in his sleep, but didn't wake. Sam stood there for a long moment, watching him. The man who had faced down sewage and steam for her, who saw the world in stories, was asleep at her table. Her flat was quiet, but for the first time, it was full. This was home. And whatever came next, whatever logistics needed to be solved, they would start from here. Together."

She lay still for a moment, listening. The sound was still there: the soft, rhythmic cadence of Liam\u2019s breathing from the living room. It was the second morning she had woken to it, and already it was weaving itself into the fabric of her life, a quiet bass note beneath the melody of her own solitude. She slipped out of bed and crept to the living room doorway. He was still slumped over her dining table, his head pillowed on his arms, the wool blanket she had draped over him askew. His dissertation lay scattered around him like the aftermath of a paper explosion. A fierce, unfamiliar surge of protectiveness washed over her. He looked so young like this, stripped of his easy confidence, just a tired student wrestling with history. She retreated to the kitchen, her movements hushed, and set about making coffee, the ritual now imbued with a new sense of purpose. It was no longer just about fuelling herself for the day ahead; it was about providing for the sleeping man in her living room.\n\nHe woke with a groan as she was pouring the coffee, stretching his back with a wince that spoke of a night spent contorted over a table. He blinked at her, his eyes unfocused for a moment before recognition and a sheepish smile dawned. \u201cMorning,\u201d he mumbled, running a hand through his already anarchic hair. \u201cI think I got about four hundred words written about wool tariffs and then they turned on me.\u201d He looked at the mug of coffee she placed in front of him, then at her, and his smile softened into something warmer. \u201cYou\u2019re a lifesaver, Sam.\u201d She just grunted in response, a sound that he was beginning to learn was her primary form of affection, and pushed a plate with two slices of toast towards him. Her version of a grand romantic breakfast. \u201cEat,\u201d she ordered. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a deadline. I\u2019ve got to go back to the club and wrestle with half a ton of rusted iron. I\u2019ll be gone all day.\u201d\n\nThe unspoken part of her statement hung in the air between them: *Stay here. Work here.* It was a huge concession, an offering of trust she wouldn't have been capable of a week ago. Her flat was her sanctuary, and she was willingly leaving him in sole charge of it. He seemed to understand the magnitude of the gesture immediately. He didn't question it or make a big deal of it; he just nodded, his expression serious and grateful. \u201cOkay,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll try not to burn the place down. And I\u2019ll have this draft finished by the time you get back. I promise.\u201d As she was pulling on her work boots by the door, he came over, still holding his mug of coffee. He didn't kiss her. He just reached out and brushed a smear of toast crumb from the corner of her mouth with his thumb, a small, intimate gesture that felt more significant than any passionate embrace. \u201cBe careful,\u201d he said, his voice low. \u201cYou\u2019re the one wrestling with half a ton of rusted iron.\u201d\n\nThe clubhouse boiler room was a war zone of organised chaos. Sam had a delivery of new pipes, joints, and industrial-grade fittings waiting for her, and she set to work with a ferocious, single-minded focus. The job was complex, requiring her to cut and replace a large, integral section of the main heating circuit. It was heavy, dirty, physically demanding work, the kind that usually left her in a state of grim, solitary satisfaction. But today was different. As she measured a length of three-inch steel pipe, her mind wasn't just on the measurements. It was on the man she had left sitting at her dining table, surrounded by her plumbing manuals and his historical texts. The thought of going home no longer conjured an image of an empty, silent flat, but of him, his smile, the easy way he occupied a space that had only ever been hers. The knowledge acted like a hidden power source, fuelling her through the long, arduous hours. The physical strain was immense, but the soul-deep weariness that usually accompanied it was absent, replaced by a quiet thrum of anticipation.\n\nShe finished the final weld just as dusk was settling, the sharp, bright flare of her torch the last pocket of light in the cavernous, shadowy boiler room. The new section of pipe gleamed under her headlamp, a solid, perfect artery grafted into the old, tired system. It was a good joint, a piece of work she could be proud of. She pressure-tested the circuit, her eyes glued to the gauge. It held steady. No leaks, no weaknesses. Victory. As she packed her tools away, her muscles screaming in protest, she pulled out her phone. There were no missed calls, no texts. Just silence. For a moment, a sliver of the old doubt crept in. Maybe he\u2019d finished his paper and just left. Maybe the reality of her life, the long hours and the grime, had finally sunk in. She shoved the thought away, angry at herself for its intrusion. Trust, she reminded herself. It was a new tool in her box, and she was still learning how to use it.\n\nWhen she finally pushed open the door to her flat, weary to the bone and smelling strongly of flux and metal dust, she was met not with silence, but with the rich, comforting aroma of baked pasta. The living room was tidy, her armchair and sofa no longer draped with his clothes. The dining table was clear, his laptop closed and his papers stacked in a neat, impressive pile. And Liam was standing in her kitchen, pulling a bubbling dish of macaroni and cheese from her small oven, a clean tea towel slung over his shoulder. He looked up as she came in, his face tired but triumphant. \"Draft submitted,\" he announced, a proud grin spreading across his face. \"And I figured you might be hungry.\" He looked her up and down, taking in her exhausted posture and the fresh grime on her face and overalls. \"Go shower,\" he said, his voice soft but firm. \"Dinner will be ready when you get out. The hot water is working, I checked. I figured it had better be, in this flat of all places.\" She stood in the doorway, toolbag hanging from her hand, utterly speechless. She had left him a key under the mat, just in case, a last-minute decision she'd agonised over. He had used it not just to be here, but to build a welcome for her. This, she thought, with a clarity that cut through her exhaustion. This is what it feels like. Not to be saved, but to be met. To come home."

                                        "text": "The shower was an act of transition. The scalding water, a luxury she provided for others but rarely enjoyed herself, sluiced the grime of the clubhouse from her skin. She watched as grey rivulets of sweat, dirt, and metal dust swirled and vanished down the drain she herself had installed three years ago. It felt symbolic, washing away the evidence of her solitary, self-sufficient life. But as she scrubbed at a stubborn patch of grease on her forearm, she knew that some changes couldn't be washed away. When she stepped out into the steam-filled bathroom and caught her reflection in the misted mirror, she saw the same tired face, the same familiar lines of exhaustion around her eyes. But the eyes themselves were different. The hard, defensive wariness that had been their default setting for a decade had been replaced by something softer, something that looked suspiciously like hope. The woman in the mirror wasn't a different person, but she was a version of herself Sam had never met before.\n\nDressed in a clean, soft jumper and worn-in jeans that felt like a second skin, she walked back into the living room. The scene that met her was one of such simple, profound domesticity it almost stopped her heart. Liam had set two places at her small dining table, using her mismatched plates and the cutlery she usually just grabbed from the drawer. The bubbling dish of macaroni and cheese sat in the centre, its cheesy crust a perfect, glorious gold. He was pouring them both a glass of water, his movements as unselfconscious and natural as if he\u2019d been doing it for years. He looked up and smiled, and the warmth of it reached her across the room, wrapping around her like a blanket.\n\n\u201cI hope you like it crispy on top,\u201d he said, pulling out a chair for her. \u201cIt\u2019s my one culinary masterpiece. Years of student living have honed it to perfection.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not from a box, is it?\u201d she asked, sinking into the chair, the sarcasm a comfortable, familiar reflex.\n\n\u201cFrom scratch,\u201d he said proudly. \u201cI even found that block of cheese you were worried about. It had a few things to say for itself, but I convinced it to cooperate.\u201d\n\nThey ate in a companionable quiet at first, the only sounds the scrape of forks on plates and the low hum of the refrigerator. The food was absurdly good, a rich, comforting ballast against the day\u2019s exhaustion. He asked her about the job, and she found herself describing the satisfaction of the final, perfect weld, the way the new steel pipe gleamed amidst the old iron, a clean fix in a system full of decay. He listened, his chin propped on his hand, not just hearing the words but understanding the fierce, quiet pride she took in her craft. In turn, he described the final, frantic hours of wrestling with his conclusion, the maddening search for a single footnote, the sheer, giddy relief of hitting the \u2018send\u2019 button. They were stories from two different universes, yet they were telling the same tale: a long, hard day\u2019s work, well done.\n\nAfter they had finished, and Sam had steadfastly refused his offer to wash up, a comfortable lull settled over the room. Liam leaned back in his chair, his expression thoughtful. \u201cSo,\u201d he said, his voice softer now. \u201cThe beast is slain. The draft is in.\u201d He paused, and Sam felt a familiar tension begin to gather in her chest, a low-pressure warning of an approaching storm. \u201cI spent a bit of time today, when I wasn\u2019t writing, looking at university job portals. Just to see what the landscape looks like.\u201d The storm had arrived. This was it. The practical, unavoidable reality she had been dreading. Her first instinct, the well-worn escape route in her mind, was to stand up, to start clearing the plates, to create a physical barrier of activity. But she didn\u2019t. She held his gaze, her hands clasped in her lap, and forced herself to stay still, to face the pressure head-on.\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d she said, her voice coming out steadier than she expected. It was the voice she used with a client when explaining a costly but necessary repair. \u201cWhat\u2019s the damage? What are the going rates for a historian who knows a suspicious amount about fifteenth-century sheep?\u201d The question hung in the air, blunt and practical. It was her way of saying, *I\u2019m not running. I\u2019m here. Show me the problem.* A slow, amazed smile spread across Liam\u2019s face. It was a look of pure, unadulterated delight. He laughed, a low, happy sound. \u201cI should have known,\u201d he said, shaking his head. \u201cI should have known you\u2019d want to see the schematics before we even discussed the build.\u201d He pushed his chair back, retrieved his laptop from the sofa, and brought it to the table, placing it between their empty plates. \u201cAlright then, Sam the Plumber,\u201d he said, his eyes twinkling. \u201cLet\u2019s look at the plumbing of our future.\u201d\n\nThe screen lit up, illuminating their faces in its cool, white glow. He showed her the job sites, the long lists of posts for fellowships, lectureships, and research assistants. He pointed out the salaries, which were, as she had suspected, frighteningly low. Her pragmatic mind immediately began to calculate. She ran the numbers on rent, on bills, on the running costs of her van, her mind a flurry of mental arithmetic. The sheer impracticality of it all was daunting. She saw listings for universities in cities that were just names on a map to her: Manchester, Durham, Exeter, places that sounded as distant as the moon. \u201cExeter\u2019s out,\u201d she stated, pointing at the screen. \u201cI\u2019d need a new set of van tires every six months.\u201d He didn\u2019t laugh. He just nodded, taking her practical objection with the seriousness it deserved. \u201cOkay. Exeter\u2019s out.\u201d They were a team, troubleshooting a complex and frustrating system, and his willingness to treat her concerns as valid data points was more reassuring than any romantic promise.\n\nThey scrolled through the listings together, a strange, modern form of fortune-telling. He was the expert, explaining the arcane terminology of academia\u2014the difference between a teaching fellowship and a research grant, the brutal competition for every tenure-track position. She was the anchor, the voice of logistical reality, her mind firmly rooted in the world of fuel costs and mortgage payments. It was during their trawl through the dregs of the listings, the less prestigious, short-term contracts, that he stopped. \u201cWait a second,\u201d he murmured, leaning closer to the screen. \u201cLook at this.\u201d It was a six-month research assistant post, right there at St Andrews. The title was unglamorous: \u2018Digitisation and Archival Assistant for the East Neuk Maritime History Project\u2019. The pay was barely enough to live on. It was a footnote of a job, a temporary contract most ambitious academics would scroll right past.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a lectureship,\u201d he said, almost to himself. \u201cIt\u2019s basically just scanning old fishing ledgers and ships\u2019 manifests. But it\u2019s here. It\u2019s six months, starting in the autumn.\u201d He looked at her, and she saw not disappointment in his eyes, but a spark of genuine excitement. \u201cIt\u2019s a foot in the door,\u201d she said, understanding immediately. It wasn\u2019t the grand career he might have dreamed of, but it was a practical, workable solution. It was a piece of pipe that would fit, a temporary fix that would keep the system running. It was a plan.\n\nHe reached across the table and covered her hand with his, his thumb tracing patterns on her knuckles. \u201cIt\u2019s six more months of coming home to this,\u201d he said, his voice quiet, his gaze taking in her, the table, the small, warm room. \u201cThe rest\u2026 the rest is just logistics.\u201d Sam looked from his earnest, hopeful face to their joined hands resting on the table amidst the crumbs of their shared meal. The future was no longer an abstract, terrifying threat. It was a concrete problem, a job to be tackled. It would be complicated and difficult, and it might not work. But for the first time, she felt the quiet, solid confidence of a professional facing a challenge she was no longer afraid of. Because this time, she wasn\u2019t working alone."

Life continued, but with a low-frequency hum of anticipation beneath the surface. Liam submitted his dissertation to a flurry of congratulatory emails from his department and promptly collapsed into a state of contented exhaustion, spending his days reading novels and his nights sleeping soundly on her sofa. For Sam, the waiting was a new and uncomfortable sensation. She was a woman of action, of diagnosis and immediate repair. This passive state of hoping for a favourable outcome from a faceless university committee felt like waiting for a part to be delivered with no tracking number. She found herself checking her own phone for emails, a ridiculous and irrational habit, as if the news would somehow come to her. It was a stark reminder of how deeply her life had become entangled with his, her own peace of mind now contingent on the contents of an inbox that wasn't hers.\n\nThe news, when it came, was perfectly in character for them: anticlimactic and profoundly practical. She was halfway through replacing a leaking shower pump in a cramped en-suite, her hands covered in sealant and her temper frayed by a stripped screw, when her phone buzzed with a text from him. *Got it.* That was all it said. No exclamation points, no string of emojis. Just two words. She stared at the screen, the frustration of the stripped screw forgotten. A slow, wide grin spread across her face, a pure and unbidden reaction. She texted back a single word: *Pub.* That evening, they sat in the same booth at The Dunvegan where they\u2019d had their first drink. The air smelled of beer and frying onions, a scent she now associated with the beginning of everything. They didn\u2019t toast with champagne; they clinked his pint of Guinness against her whisky chaser. It wasn\u2019t a celebration of a great triumph, but a quiet, shared acknowledgement of a problem solved, a crisis averted. \"To six months,\" she said, her voice low. \"And to the East Neuk Maritime History Project, whatever the hell that is.\" He smiled, his eyes crinkling at the corners. \"To scanning old fishing ledgers,\" he replied, his voice full of a happiness that had nothing to do with academic prestige. \"And to having a key to the best flat in St Andrews.\"\n\nThe official moving in happened not with a van and boxes, but through a slow, organic process of accumulation, like sediment settling in a low-pressure pipe. It started with a toothbrush appearing in the mug on her bathroom shelf. Then a box of his most essential books found a home on the floor beside her armchair. Sam, watching this gradual colonisation of her space, felt a surprising lack of her old territorial defensiveness. One Saturday morning, she found herself standing in front of the small chest of drawers in her bedroom, a piece of furniture that held nothing but spare linens and old jumpers. With a sense of deliberate purpose, she emptied the top two drawers, folded the contents neatly, and put them in a cupboard. She didn't say anything when Liam came home from his last-ever caddying shift. She just nodded towards the bedroom. \"There are a couple of empty drawers in there,\" she said, her tone casual, as if she were pointing out a change in the weather. \"If you want to get your stuff out of that cardboard box.\" He stopped in the hallway, his golf bag still slung over his shoulder, and just looked at her. The gratitude in his eyes was so profound it made her feel suddenly shy, and she quickly turned away to busy herself at the kitchen sink.\n\nA few weeks later, while doing a routine check on Mrs Baird\u2019s boiler, the old woman peered at her over the top of her spectacles. \u201cYou look well, Samantha,\u201d she observed, her voice sharp as ever. \u201cLess like you\u2019re preparing for a siege. That lovely boy of yours must be a good influence.\u201d Sam, tightening a connection, didn't even bother with a denial this time. \u201cHe\u2019s alright,\u201d she mumbled, a faint blush rising on her neck. \u201cHe\u2019s starting a new job at the university next week.\u201d Mrs Baird nodded sagely, as if this confirmed a long-held theory. \u201cGood. A man needs a purpose. Just remember, dear,\u201d she added, tapping a finger on the newly serviced boiler, \u201cthe strongest systems are the ones with good circulation. Can\u2019t have one part doing all the work while the other sits cold. You have to keep the warmth flowing both ways.\u201d Sam paused, wrench in hand, struck by the simple wisdom of the old woman\u2019s metaphor. She looked at her own hands, calloused and capable, and thought of Liam\u2019s, which had learned to make spreadsheets for her chaotic invoicing system and could produce a perfect omelette from the desolate landscape of her fridge. The warmth, she realised, was already flowing both ways.\n\nThe new normal quickly established itself. It was a rhythm composed of two different melodies that somehow harmonised. Her days were governed by the urgent demands of burst pipes and broken boilers, a world of tangible emergencies and immediate fixes. His were now spent in a quiet, dusty office in a forgotten corner of the library, a world of patient research and slow, methodical digitisation. He would come home in the evenings with the faint, sweet smell of old paper clinging to his clothes, his mind full of the ghost ships and forgotten sailors he\u2019d spent the day with. He\u2019d find her at the dining table, surrounded by her own kind of archive\u2014receipts, supplier invoices, and job sheets\u2014her brow furrowed in a frustration that had nothing to do with history. He would make her tea, sit beside her, and patiently untangle the numbers, bringing the quiet order of his world to the noisy chaos of hers. She, in turn, would listen as he talked about a newly discovered ledger from a nineteenth-century herring boat, seeing in his passion a reflection of her own satisfaction in a job well done.\n\nOne rainy Tuesday, Sam found herself with a rare afternoon free, a job having cancelled at the last minute. On a sudden impulse, she drove into town and parked near the library. She didn\u2019t go in. Instead, she went to a small homeware shop on a cobbled side street, a place she had only ever entered to buy replacement tap washers. She walked past the practical items, the drain unblockers and the scrubbing brushes, and stopped in front of a display of brightly coloured mugs. They were sturdy and well-made, a world away from the novelty sheep mug he was still using. She picked up a deep blue one, a colour that reminded her of his eyes on the day they\u2019d met in the sewage-filled locker room. It felt solid and right in her hand. She bought it, along with a matching one in a warm, earthy green for herself. It was an absurdly small purchase, but as she walked back to her van, the small, clanking weight of the bag in her hand felt as significant as signing a deed. It was an investment. It was a statement. It was the quiet acknowledgement that her flat was no longer a fortress for one, but a home for two.\n\nThat evening, when Liam came through the door, shaking the rain from his coat, she didn't say a word. She just handed him a cup of tea, steaming hot, in the new blue mug. He stopped, looking down at the mug in his hands, then up at her, a slow, wonderful smile spreading across his face. He understood completely. He knew it wasn\u2019t just a mug. It was a joint, perfectly soldered. It was a binding contract, renewed and reinforced. It was the quiet, incontrovertible evidence that for the next six months\u2014and maybe, just maybe, for a long time after that\u2014they were building something to last. He raised the mug in a silent toast. She raised her new green one in reply. Outside, the rain beat down on the ancient town of St Andrews, but inside the small, warm flat, the system was stable, the pressure was perfect, and for the first time in her life, Sam felt completely, utterly, and profoundly safe."

                                        "text": "The months of autumn settled over St Andrews, bringing with them a damp chill that crept in from the sea and a low, pearlescent light that made the ancient stones of the town gleam. Inside the small, second-floor flat, however, a different climate had taken hold. It was a climate of warmth and quiet routine, of two mugs by the coffee maker and a second pair of boots by the door. Sam had discovered that living with someone was not the constant, noisy intrusion she had always feared. Instead, it was a series of quiet discoveries. It was learning that Liam hummed, a tuneless, thoughtful sound, when he was deep in a book. It was the surprising pleasure of finding he had restocked the tea bags before they ran out. It was the simple, solid presence of him sleeping on the sofa, which he still insisted on doing most nights, claiming her bed was \"too neat\" and he was afraid of messing it up.\n\nLife fell into a rhythm. She would leave in the cold, dark mornings, her van smelling of copper and coffee, off to wrestle with the town\u2019s failing infrastructure. He would walk to his dusty office in the library, his mind filled with the trade winds and fishing fleets of centuries past. They would meet again in the evenings, two weary tradespeople from different centuries, sharing stories over a meal at the small dining table that had become the centre of their world. The six-month contract, once a terrifying deadline, had faded into the background, a low-pressure system far out at sea that didn't seem to threaten their current calm.\n\nOne Sunday, a rare day of rest for them both, the flat was filled with a comfortable, lived-in silence. Sam was at the kitchen counter, methodically dismantling a faulty kettle, the familiar clicks and snaps of the plastic casing a soothing balm to her restless hands. Liam was sprawled in her armchair, surrounded by a fortress of books, his brow furrowed in concentration. The kettle's thermal cut-out switch was faulty, a simple, ten-minute fix, but she was drawing it out, enjoying the simple, solvable nature of the problem. Liam looked up from his book, breaking the quiet. \u201cProfessor Albright just emailed. He wants me to go down to London next month. There\u2019s a big postgraduate conference on maritime history. Says it would be a good networking opportunity for when this contract runs out.\u201d\n\nSam\u2019s hands stilled, a tiny screwdriver held poised over a terminal. London. The word landed in the quiet room with the heavy, jarring thud of a dropped wrench. It was a place that existed only on the news and in the addresses of the parts suppliers she sometimes had to deal with. It was the epicentre of a world utterly alien to her. \u201cNetworking?\u201d she asked, her voice carefully neutral, her attention fixed on the kettle\u2019s wiring. \u201cSounds fancy.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s mostly just drinking cheap wine and listening to people argue about thirteenth-century shipping routes,\u201d he said with a laugh, oblivious to the sudden shift in the room's atmosphere. \u201cBut it\u2019s a chance to see what\u2019s out there. Maybe hear about a proper lectureship opening up before it gets advertised.\u201d He saw it as a practical step, a scouting mission for their future. She heard something else entirely. She heard the first, faint whisper of a world pulling him away, a world of ambition and opportunity that had no place for a plumber from St Andrews. The small, safe haven of her flat suddenly felt fragile, a temporary shelter on the edge of a vast and indifferent ocean. The old, familiar chill crept back into her bones.\n\nThe next day, she found herself on a job that was, for her, the equivalent of a holiday. It was a full bathroom refit in a house that was undergoing a complete renovation. The floors were bare, the walls were stripped back to the studs, and there were no pristine carpets or anxious homeowners to worry about. It was a blank canvas. For two days, she worked with a focused, almost joyful intensity, mapping out the new pipework, her hands moving with the sure and certain grace of a master craftsman. She was alone with the work, the only sounds the hiss of her torch and the satisfying rasp of a pipe cutter. Liam would text her in the afternoons\u2014*How's it going? Don't forget to eat*\u2014and she would reply with a terse\u2014*Fine. Busy.*\u2014feeling a strange, guilty satisfaction in the solitude. She was back in her element, a world of clean angles and solvable problems, a world where she didn't need anyone.\n\nOn the third day, she was soldering the final joints for the new shower valve, a complex lattice of copper pipe she had designed and built herself. It was a beautiful piece of work, a functional sculpture of perfect ninety-degree bends and flawless seams that no one but her would ever see. She was polishing a joint with wire wool when her phone rang. It was Mrs Baird. \u201cSamantha, dear, it\u2019s my kitchen tap. It\u2019s started to drip. I know it\u2019s not an emergency, but it\u2019s making a dreadful plinking sound and it\u2019s putting me off my crosswords.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll come by in the morning, Mrs B,\u201d Sam said automatically. \u201cI\u2019m on a big job right now.\u201d \u201cOf course, dear, whenever you can.\u201d They hung up, and Sam stood there, looking at the finished pipework. She could pack up now, head home. Liam would probably have dinner waiting. He would ask about her day, and she would have to find the words to describe the fierce, solitary pride she felt in her work. It felt easier to stay here, in the cold, dusty shell of the half-finished bathroom where she was completely, uncomplicatedly herself. With a sudden, decisive movement, she dialled Mrs Baird back. \u201cActually, Mrs B,\u201d she said, her voice bright and efficient. \u201cI\u2019ve just finished up. I can be with you in twenty minutes.\u201d\n\nShe arrived home hours later, long after dark, her body aching with a satisfying weariness. The flat was warm and smelled of garlic and tomatoes. Liam was at the table, his laptop open, but he had clearly been waiting for her. \"Hey,\" he said, his smile a little strained. \"I was getting worried. Everything okay?\" \"Fine,\" she said, shrugging out of her jacket and dropping her keys in the bowl with a clatter. \"Job ran late. Then Mrs Baird's tap was dripping. Fixed it.\" She went to the fridge, grabbing a bottle of water, aware that she was avoiding his gaze. \"I saved you some pasta,\" he said, nodding towards a plate covered with foil on the counter. \"I can heat it up for you.\" And that was the moment the valve in her chest, overtightened by a day of deliberate solitude, finally gave way. \"You don't have to do that,\" she snapped, the words sharper than she intended. \"You don't have to wait up for me. You don't have to save me dinner. I'm not a child, Liam. I've been feeding myself for a long time.\"\n\nHe looked utterly taken aback, his brow furrowed in hurt and confusion. \"I know that,\" he said slowly, closing his laptop. \"I wasn't trying to... I was just... being your boyfriend. It's what people do when they live together. They make each other dinner.\" \"Well, you don't need to,\" she said, her voice tight, the old defensive walls flying up, brick by painful brick. \"My life worked just fine before you started organising it. I don't need looking after.\" \"I'm not looking after you, Sam!\" His voice rose, laced with a frustration she had never heard from him before. \"I'm living with you! Do you think me making pasta is some kind of power play? I'm trying to be a partner, not your bloody guardian.\" He stood up, running a hand through his hair in a gesture of pure exasperation. \"What is this really about? Is this about the conference in London? Do you think I'm just going to swan off and forget about all this?\" Her silence was a confession. He let out a sigh, a mixture of anger and sorrow. \"I thought we were past this,\" he said, his voice dropping, full of a weariness that had nothing to do with work. \"I thought you trusted me.\" He turned and walked into the bedroom, closing the door behind him with a quiet, devastating click. Sam was left standing alone in the kitchen, the plate of cold pasta on the counter a monument to the argument. She had her silence back. And it had never felt so empty."

                                        "text": "The quiet click of the bedroom door was the loudest sound Sam had ever heard. It was a sound of finality, a lock turning, a valve being shut. It echoed in the sudden, profound silence of the flat, a silence that rushed in to fill the space where his voice had been. She stood frozen in the middle of her kitchen, her hands still damp from the bottle of water she\u2019d grabbed. The plate of pasta on the counter, covered in foil, seemed to mock her. It was an offering of warmth and care that she had thrown back in his face, treating it like an accusation. His words ricocheted around the inside of her skull: *I thought you trusted me.* She had bristled at his phrase \u2018looking after you,\u2019 but wasn\u2019t that exactly what her fortress of solitude had always been about? Looking after herself, because trusting anyone else to be there was a fool's game. She had spent years perfecting a system designed to run on a single, independent power source. The moment he had tried to connect his own, to create a shared circuit, she had blown the main fuse.\n\nShe didn't eat the pasta. She couldn't. Instead, she wrapped it tightly in another layer of foil and put it in the fridge, a clinical, emotionless action. Then she began to clean. She scrubbed the already spotless kitchen counters with a methodical fury. She dismantled the coffee machine and descaled it. She reorganised her toolbox in the hallway, lining up spanners and wrenches in perfect, descending order of size. She worked until her hands ached and her fingernails were raw, seeking the familiar, comforting exhaustion of physical labour. But it didn't come. There was no satisfaction, no quiet pride. There was only the cold, hollow ache of self-inflicted damage. Finally, long after midnight, she gave up and sank into her armchair, the room lit only by the orange glow of a single streetlamp outside. She stared at the closed bedroom door. It was a border she had drawn, and he was on the other side of it. For the first time, she felt like an unwelcome guest in her own home.\n\nSleep, when it finally came, was fitful and shallow. She woke on the sofa, a crick in her neck and a cold dread in the pit of her stomach. The early morning light was pale and unforgiving. The flat was utterly silent. She pushed herself up and listened. There was no sound from the bedroom. The routine of the past few months\u2014the quiet pleasure of making two cups of coffee, the shared silence as they prepared for their different days\u2014was gone. The air was thick with tension, a pressure imbalance that made it hard to breathe. She was standing by the kettle, her hand hovering over the power switch, when the bedroom door opened. Liam emerged, already dressed in jeans and a jumper. His face was pale and drawn, his eyes shadowed with a sleepless night. He didn't look at her. He moved with a quiet, deliberate purpose, gathering his books and his laptop from the dining table, his movements precise and economical. He was a visitor, packing to leave.\n\nThe sight of him, so distant and contained, was more painful than any shouting match could have been. The silence stretched between them, thin and brittle. She wanted to say something, anything, but the words were jammed deep in her throat, a blockage she didn't have the tools to clear. He went into the bathroom and she heard the sound of the electric razor, a harsh, buzzing sound that grated on the morning\u2019s fragile quiet. When he came out, he walked to the front door and began to pull on his coat. He still hadn't looked at her. He was going to leave. He was going to walk out of the door without a word, and it would be over, and it would be all her fault. A wave of pure, animal panic surged through her, so powerful it almost buckled her knees. \"Liam,\" she said, her voice a raw croak. He stopped, his hand on the doorknob, his back still to her. \"I made a mistake,\" she managed to say, the words feeling foreign and clumsy on her tongue. It wasn't an apology, not yet, but it was a crack in the wall she had thrown up. He was silent for a long moment. Then, without turning around, he said, his voice flat and devoid of emotion, \"I know.\" And then he opened the door and left, the quiet click of it closing behind him a devastating echo of the night before."

                                        "text": "The silence in the flat was not a void; it was a physical presence, a heavy blanket smothering all sound. Sam stood by the door where Liam had left, her hand still outstretched as if she could somehow catch the words she should have said and pull them back. The air was cold. Her flat, once a fortress of solitude and order, was now a crime scene, and she was both the victim and the perpetrator. The evidence of her transgression was everywhere. The plate of cold pasta in the fridge, a congealed testament to her cruelty. The two mugs by the sink, one chipped and familiar, one new and blue, a pair now cruelly separated. The empty space on the sofa where he should have been sleeping. She walked through the rooms in a daze, her own home feeling alien and hostile. She had won. She had driven him out and reclaimed her fortress. She was alone and safe from the terrifying vulnerability of being loved. And the victory tasted like ash.\n\nForcing herself into motion, she grabbed her work keys and jacket, the ingrained habit of a lifetime her only guide. Work was the answer. Work was always the answer. A problem of physics and mechanics would surely silence the screaming chaos in her head. She climbed into her van, the familiar smells of oil and metal offering no comfort. She drove to the renovation site, the big job, the blank canvas where she had felt so powerful and in control just yesterday. She walked into the half-finished bathroom, her footsteps echoing in the empty house. There it was: her masterpiece. The intricate lattice of copper pipe, a testament to her skill and precision. It was perfect. And it meant nothing. She picked up a wrench, its familiar weight feeling alien and useless in her hand. She stared at the flawless joints she had soldered, and all she could see were the fractured connections in her own life. She couldn't fix this. This was a breakage of a different kind, a catastrophic failure of the heart, and she didn't have the tools or the training to even begin the repair. The wrench slipped from her numb fingers and clattered to the floor, the sound sharp and shocking in the silence. She sank down onto an overturned bucket, put her head in her hands, and for the first time since her father\u2019s funeral, she wept.\n\nShe didn't know how long she sat there, but eventually the tears subsided, leaving behind a cold, hollow clarity. She couldn't stay here. She couldn't work. On autopilot, she packed away her tools, locked up the site, and started driving, with no destination in mind. Her hands guided the van through the familiar streets until she found herself parked outside a small, neat bungalow with a well-tended rose garden. Mrs. Baird\u2019s house. She had no reason to be there. The tap was fixed. But her feet carried her up the path and her finger pressed the doorbell before her brain could register the action. The door opened, and Mrs. Baird stood there, her sharp eyes taking in Sam\u2019s red-rimmed eyes, her pale face, and the deep, raw misery etched there. \"Good heavens, child,\" the old woman said, her voice losing its usual sharp edge and softening with concern. \"You look like you've been wrestling a poltergeist.\" She stepped aside, holding the door open. \"Get in here and put the kettle on. You look like you need a proper cup of tea.\"\n\nSam found herself in Mrs. Baird's warm, lavender-scented kitchen, the familiar actions of filling the kettle and finding the mugs a fragile anchor in her swirling sea of regret. She didn\u2019t speak, but Mrs. Baird didn't seem to need her to. The old woman sat at her small kitchen table, watching her with a piercing, not-unkind gaze. \"So,\" Mrs. Baird said, once the tea was made and they were both seated. \"The lovely boy has finally seen the dragon that guards your castle, has he?\" The bluntness of the question was like a lance to a wound, painful but necessary. Sam flinched, then nodded mutely, stirring her tea so hard it slopped over the side of the mug. \"I said some things,\" Sam whispered, her voice hoarse. \"I pushed him away. I\u2026 I was scared.\" Mrs. Baird took a slow, deliberate sip of her tea. \"Of course you were, dear. Love is terrifying. It\u2019s the only thing in the world more unpredictable than old plumbing. You spend your life learning how to seal every joint, how to guard against every possible leak, and then you invite someone in who has the power to just smash the whole system to pieces.\" She placed her cup down with a soft click. \"But the trick of it, the thing nobody tells you, is that they also have the power to help you build something stronger than you ever could on your own. It's a dreadful risk. Most sensible people would run a mile.\" She fixed Sam with a stern look. \"And you, Samantha, are an eminently sensible person. Which is your problem.\"\n\nThe old woman\u2019s words hit their mark with devastating accuracy. Sam was sensible. She was practical. She had built her entire life on managing risk and avoiding unpredictable variables. And Liam was the most wonderful, unpredictable variable she had ever encountered. \"I broke it, Mrs. B,\" Sam said, her voice cracking. \"I broke it and he's gone.\" \"Nonsense,\" Mrs. Baird said sharply. \"A broken pipe can be mended. A crack can be sealed. But not if the plumber leaves her tools in the van and goes home. You are a fixer, Samantha. It is the very essence of you. You have never, in all the years I have known you, walked away from a job that was difficult. Are you going to start now, with the most important one of your life?\" The question hung in the air, a direct challenge. It was a call to arms disguised as a cup of tea. Sam looked down at her hands, the hands that knew how to fix things, and a spark of her old resolve returned. She wasn\u2019t a person who gave up.\n\nShe left Mrs. Baird\u2019s house with a renewed, albeit terrified, sense of purpose. She drove not home, but to the university, her heart hammering against her ribs with a frantic, unsteady rhythm. She parked the van, a hulking, mud-splattered beast amidst the neat little hatchbacks of the students, and walked towards the library. She had never felt more out of place in her life. The hushed, scholarly air felt like a judgment. Every student who passed, their arms full of books, seemed to look at her overalls and the grime under her fingernails with disdain. But she pushed on, fuelled by Mrs. Baird\u2019s words and a desperate, flickering hope. She found his office in a forgotten corner of the building, a small, windowless room with a door that was slightly ajar. She could hear the faint, frantic clicking of a keyboard from within. Taking a breath that did nothing to calm her nerves, she pushed the door open. He was there, hunched over his laptop, the harsh glow of the screen illuminating the strained lines of his face. He was not working on his project. He was scrolling through job listings for universities in London. The sight was a punch to the gut. She had done this. Her fear was becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy. \"Liam,\" she said, her voice barely a whisper. He started, his head snapping up, his eyes wide with shock. The hurt was still there, raw and deep, but underneath it was a flicker of something else: surprise, confusion, and a pain that mirrored her own. She stood in the doorway of his world, a plumber with no tools, about to attempt the most difficult repair of her life. \"I need to fix this,\" she said, her voice shaking but clear. \"And I don't know how. But you can't just walk away from a job this big. It's\u2026 it\u2019s against regulations.\""

                                        "text": "Liam stared at her, his face a mask of disbelief and exhaustion. The words hung in the small, dusty office, so quintessentially Sam that it was almost absurd. A problem of regulations. He gave a short, humourless laugh that was more like a cough, a sound of pure, bitter frustration. He pushed his chair back from the desk, the screech of its legs on the floor a sharp, angry sound.\n\n\u201cRegulations?\u201d he repeated, his voice dangerously quiet. \u201cIs that what this is to you? Another job? A faulty connection in need of a service? You can\u2019t just come in here, covered in the dirt of a job you chose over talking to me, and tell me our relationship is against regulations.\u201d He stood up, pacing the tiny space between his desk and a teetering pile of books. \u201cI spent the night on the floor of my office because I couldn\u2019t bear the silence in our flat. The flat you made it clear I was an intruder in. And I come in here this morning and start looking for a way out, a real way out, because you told me in no uncertain terms that there was nothing here for me. You told me you didn\u2019t need me. And now you show up talking about regulations.\u201d\n\nEvery word was a blow, a righteous and well-aimed strike against the flimsy armour she had tried to erect. She flinched but held her ground in the doorway, knowing she deserved every bit of his anger. This was the part of the job she always hated: facing the homeowner after the damage was done, when the full, messy, and expensive reality of the breakage was laid bare. \u201cAye,\u201d she said, her voice small but steady. \u201cYes. It\u2019s the only way I know how to talk about it. It\u2019s the only language I\u2019ve got, Liam. Don\u2019t you see? My whole world is made of things that are either working or broken. There\u2019s no in-between.\u201d She took a hesitant step into the room, into his territory. \u201cYou started talking about London, about networking, about a future, and all my alarms went off. A major pressure drop. A risk of catastrophic failure. And my training, my whole life, has taught me that when you see a sign like that, you shut down the system. You isolate the fault. You protect the main supply at all costs. I\u2026 I isolated you.\u201d\n\nThe confession hung in the air, raw and technical and deeply, painfully honest. He stopped pacing and just looked at her, the anger in his eyes slowly being replaced by a deep, weary sadness. He saw the truth of it. He saw the scared, sensible woman who treated her own heart like a high-pressure boiler, full of fail-safes and emergency shut-offs. \u201cI wasn\u2019t planning an escape, Sam,\u201d he said, his voice softening, losing its hard edge. \u201cI was trying to build something. I was looking for a way to make a life with you viable in the long term. A way to stay. When you pushed me away last night, you made London feel like the only option. You took the \u2018us\u2019 off the table, so all that was left was me.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause I\u2019m a coward,\u201d she whispered, the admission a shard of glass in her throat. \u201cIt\u2019s easier to cut the pipe myself than to stand around and wait for it to burst and flood the whole damn house. I\u2019ve always been the one who cleans up the mess. I didn\u2019t think I could survive a mess I couldn\u2019t fix.\u201d She looked around the small, cluttered office, at the life he was building, a life of words and ideas she felt so separate from. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to do this. I\u2019m wired wrong. All my life, if something was broken, I knew how to take it apart, find the faulty component, and replace it. But this\u2026 this is my faulty component.\u201d She tapped a finger against her own chest. \u201cAnd I can\u2019t replace it. I don\u2019t know how to fix it if I don\u2019t even understand the schematic.\u201d\n\nThat was it. The final wall turned to dust. She stood before him, completely dismantled, her internal wiring exposed for him to see. He stared at her for a long, silent moment, his expression unreadable. Then, with a slow, deliberate movement, he reached over and closed the laptop, shutting down the glowing screen of job listings for London, plunging the room into the softer, greyer light from the corridor. He walked across the small space that separated them, stopping just in front of her. She braced herself, expecting him to turn away, to walk past her and out the door. Instead, he reached out and gently took her hands. They were cold and stiff, her knuckles scraped from her work. He held them in his own, his warmth slowly seeping into her.\n\n\u201cThen we learn the schematic together,\u201d he said, his voice a low, steady murmur. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to fix it alone, Sam. That\u2019s the whole point. You let me in. You show me the bits that are rusted shut and you let me help you put the wrench on it. You\u2019re right. This is a job for two people.\u201d He looked down at their joined hands, then back up at her face, his thumb gently stroking the back of her hand. \u201cI\u2019m not going to London. Not without you. The only networking I\u2019m interested in is the one that connects this office to our flat. That\u2019s the circuit I want to make work.\u201d\n\nTears she hadn't known were left welled in her eyes, blurring his face into a soft, indistinct shape. She gave a shaky, watery laugh. \u201cIt\u2019s a complicated system,\u201d she warned him, her voice thick. \u201cOld wiring. Prone to short-outs.\u201d He smiled, a real smile this time, the one that reached his eyes and made the whole world seem brighter. \u201cI\u2019m a historian,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m good with old, complicated things.\u201d He squeezed her hand. \u201cCome on,\u201d he said softly. \u201cLet\u2019s go home. I think there\u2019s a plate of cold pasta in the fridge that needs a proper apology.\u201d He led her out of the dusty office, out of the quiet library, and back into the cold, bright light of the day. They walked side-by-side towards her van, not touching now, but connected by a new and fragile understanding. The future was still an unwritten schematic, full of potential problems and unknown variables. But they were facing the blueprint together, and for the first time, Sam believed it was a system they could actually build to last."

                                        "text": "The drive back to the flat was conducted in a fragile, resonant silence. It was the quiet of a room after a bomb has been defused, the air still thick with the memory of imminent danger. Sam drove, her hands gripping the steering wheel with a tightness that had nothing to do with the traffic. She was in her domain, the cab of her van, a space she could navigate with her eyes closed, but she felt like a novice, uncertain of every turn. Liam sat beside her, his gaze fixed on the passing grey stone buildings, giving her the space she needed. He wasn't withdrawn or angry anymore; he was simply present, a quiet co-passenger on a difficult journey back from the brink. The silence wasn\u2019t empty. It was filled with the things they had said in his small office, the raw honesty and the painful admissions, words that had dismantled them both and were now the only materials they had to build something new.\n\nWhen she unlocked the door to the flat, the space felt different. It was no longer a crime scene, but a convalescent ward. The air was still and heavy, but it was the stillness of recovery, not of absence. Liam followed her in, closing the door softly behind them. His eyes went immediately to the plate of pasta, still sitting on the counter where she had left it. It was the epicentre of the previous night\u2019s disaster, a cold, solid reminder of the hurt. Sam\u2019s first instinct was to grab it and throw it in the bin, to erase the evidence of her failure. But Liam moved first. He walked over to it, picked it up, and looked at it with a kind of mock-sombre expression. \u201cRight,\u201d he said, his voice quiet but steady, breaking the tension. \u201cI think the first order of business is a formal apology.\u201d He turned to face the plate. \u201cOn behalf of the head plumber, I would like to sincerely apologise for your unceremonious rejection. Your services were offered in good faith and were met with unwarranted hostility.\u201d\n\nThe absurdity of the moment, the sheer Liam-ness of it, was a release valve on the pressure that had been building in Sam\u2019s chest for twenty-four hours. A small, watery laugh escaped her. \u201cYou\u2019re a daft bastard,\u201d she whispered, wiping at her eyes with the back of her hand. He looked over at her, his own eyes soft. \u201cIt was a very good macaroni cheese. It deserved better.\u201d He opened the fridge and took out the second portion she had stored away. \u201cAnd I think, as part of the reconciliation process, the guilty party is required to share the meal with the chief engineer. It\u2019s in the new regulations.\u201d Sam watched him as he carefully scraped both portions into a saucepan, his movements gentle and deliberate. He was not just reheating a meal; he was performing a ritual of repair. She found herself moving to the cupboard, taking out two bowls and two forks without a word, her actions a quiet assent. They were starting over, right here, with a plate of cold pasta.\n\nThey ate standing in the kitchen, leaning against the counter, the way you do when you\u2019re too tired to sit at a table. The pasta was a bit dry from being reheated, but it didn\u2019t matter. With each mouthful, they were consuming the argument, digesting the hurt, turning a symbol of their conflict into an act of communion. When they were finished, Liam took her bowl and put it in the sink next to his. \u201cOkay,\u201d he said, turning to face her, his expression serious now. \u201cNew schematic. Rule one. When one of us feels a catastrophic pressure drop coming on, we don\u2019t perform an emergency shutdown. We issue a system-wide alert. A verbal one. No pulling the big red lever and running for the door.\u201d He was speaking her language, fluently and without artifice, and it made her heart ache with a strange and wonderful new feeling.\n\nShe nodded, taking a deep breath. It was her turn. \u201cAye. A yellow flag. Not a full stop.\u201d She looked at him, forcing herself to hold his gaze, to stay present in this difficult, necessary work. \u201cAnd rule two. The other engineer doesn't immediately start looking for jobs on another continent when the yellow flag goes up. We troubleshoot the existing system before we decide to decommission the whole site.\u201d His mouth quirked into a small, sad smile. \u201cFair enough,\u201d he said. \u201cNo preemptive relocations.\u201d They stood in silence for a moment, the unwritten clauses of their new contract hanging in the air between them: honesty, patience, and the radical decision to trust that the other person would stay and help fix the leak.\n\nAs evening drew in, a semblance of their old routine returned, but it was overlaid with a new, careful tenderness. They watched television, not really paying attention, the low murmur of it a backdrop to their shared quiet. When it was late, Liam stood up and began to gather the wool blanket and the spare pillow from the end of the sofa, his movements hesitant, as if unsure of the protocol. He was preparing his bed on the couch, retreating to his designated space. The sight of it, the familiar ritual of their separation, was suddenly intolerable to Sam. This was the last piece of the old, broken system, a physical manifestation of the wall she had kept between them.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d she said, her voice quiet but firm. He stopped, the blanket in his hands, and looked at her, his expression questioning. She stood up and walked over to him, her heart thumping a heavy, slow rhythm against her ribs. This was the final, rusted-shut valve, and she had to be the one to turn it. \u201cThe bedroom,\u201d she said, the words feeling clumsy and huge. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 warmer in there. And the bed is big enough.\u201d She saw the question in his eyes, the memory of his old excuse. \u201cAnd if it\u2019s too neat,\u201d she added, a faint, shaky smile touching her lips, \u201cthen that\u2019s a problem we can solve. Together.\u201d\n\nHe didn\u2019t say anything. He just looked at her, and in his eyes she saw the full, staggering weight of what she was offering. It wasn\u2019t about a place to sleep. It was about granting him full access, about tearing down the last barricade of her fortress and handing him a key to the keep. He slowly folded the blanket and placed it back on the arm of the sofa, a quiet, deliberate act of acceptance. He reached out and took her hand, his fingers lacing through hers, warm and solid. It wasn\u2019t a triumphant or passionate gesture. It was a silent agreement, a new contract signed and sealed. That night, for the first time, there was no closed door between them. In the quiet darkness of her bedroom, the sound of his breathing beside her was not an intrusion, but the steady, reassuring hum of a system finally, completely, brought online."

                                        "text": "Waking up was a slow, disorienting process. Sam\u2019s first conscious thought was one of warmth, a deep, radiating heat along her entire left side that was not coming from a radiator. The second was the unfamiliar weight of an arm draped loosely over her waist, and the third was the scent of him\u2014a clean, sleepy smell mixed with the faint, lingering aroma of her own laundry soap\u2014on her pillow. Her eyes snapped open. For a heart-stopping second, primal instinct took over, the intruder alert that had been her lifelong companion. But then memory flooded in, warm and steadying, and the tension in her shoulders eased for the first time she could remember upon waking. Liam. He was here. In her bed. He was still fast asleep, his face half-buried in the pillow, his breathing a soft, rhythmic puff against her neck. The sight of him, so peaceful and unguarded in the pale morning light, was both terrifyingly vulnerable and deeply, profoundly right. She lay perfectly still, afraid to move, afraid to break the spell. This was the epicentre of the risk she had spent her life avoiding, and yet, lying here in the quiet intimacy of the dawn, it felt like the safest place in the world.\n\nThe days that followed were a quiet education in the art of sharing a space. The silent, solitary routines that had been the bedrock of Sam's life were gently, irrevocably altered. Mornings were no longer a mad dash from bed to van, but a slow dance in the small kitchen, a choreography of two bodies navigating around each other to reach the kettle or the toaster. She discovered he was not a morning person, that he navigated the first twenty minutes of his day in a state of near-silent hibernation, and she found a strange, protective pleasure in handing him his first cup of coffee without speaking, a shared ritual that needed no words. He, in turn, learned to read the subtle language of her moods, to know when the frustration of a difficult job required a quiet offer of tea and twenty minutes of silence, and when the satisfaction of a fix well done could be met with questions and praise. Her flat, once a sterile extension of her van\u2014a place for sleep and basic maintenance\u2014began to transform. A second, slightly lopsided reading lamp appeared by the armchair. A pot of basil, bought by Liam on a whim, now sat on the kitchen windowsill, its fresh, peppery scent a startling new addition to the air. Her fortress was becoming a home, and the change was happening not with a bang, but with the quiet, incremental accumulation of a shared life.\n\nOne evening, about a week after their great reconciliation, they were sitting at the dining table, the remnants of a simple dinner pushed to one side. Sam was sketching out a complex pipe-run for a new job, her pencil moving with quick, sure strokes. Liam was reading, but she could feel his attention wasn't entirely on the page. Finally, he closed his book with a soft thud. \"Right,\" he said, his voice casual but deliberate. \"System-wide alert.\" Sam\u2019s hand stilled, her pencil hovering over the paper. She looked up, her heart giving a small, nervous flutter. This was it. The first test of their new regulations. She met his gaze, forcing herself to stay open, to not retreat into the safety of her schematics. \"Go ahead,\" she said, her own voice quiet. \"What's the pressure reading?\" He took a breath. \"The London conference. It's in three weeks. I have to book my train and my accommodation. My professor is expecting me to go.\" He laid the facts on the table, a clear, unvarnished statement of a logistical reality. There was no hidden meaning, no threat. It was just a problem to be solved.\n\nSam looked at him, at the open, honest expression on his face, and felt the old, reflexive fear begin to rise\u2014the fear of being left, the fear of the separate lives they led. But this time, something else rose with it: the memory of his hurt face in his office, the echo of Mrs. Baird\u2019s words, the solid weight of his hand in hers. She was a fixer. She didn\u2019t run from the job. \"Right,\" she said, putting her pencil down decisively. \"London.\" She thought for a moment, her pragmatic mind clicking through variables. He would go. He would be in a different city, surrounded by his world, and she would be here, in hers. The distance felt vast and unbridgeable. And then, a new, wild thought occurred to her, a solution so radical and unlike her it was almost laughable. It was a complete system overhaul, not a minor repair.\n\n\"What if I came with you?\" The words were out before she had fully processed them, a spontaneous and terrifying leap of faith. Liam stared at her, his eyes wide with surprise. \"You? To London?\" He wasn't questioning her right to come; he was simply stunned by the offer. \"You hate crowds. You hate cities. You said yourself you've never been further south than Newcastle.\" \"Aye, well,\" she said, a nervous energy thrumming through her. \"Maybe it's time I did. You're always showing me your world in here,\" she gestured around the flat, at his books and his laptop. \"Maybe I should come and see it for real. See what all the fuss is about.\" A slow, brilliant smile spread across Liam's face, a look of such profound joy and relief that it made her breath catch. He saw what she was offering. It wasn't just a trip; it was a choice. It was her willingly stepping out of her fortified town and into the unknown, because he was there. \"Sam,\" he said, his voice full of wonder. \"I would love that. More than anything.\" He reached across the table and took her hand, his grip warm and sure. \"Okay,\" he said, his smile turning into a determined grin. \"Okay, then. Operation London. Let's start troubleshooting.\" That night, instead of her usual plumbing catalogues, Sam found herself looking at train schedules and hotel websites, the unfamiliar names of London Underground stations looking like a complex and baffling new schematic. It was daunting. It was terrifying. But as Liam leaned over her shoulder, pointing out a hotel that was \"a bit grim but cheap and near the conference centre,\" she didn't feel alone. She felt like part of a team, about to embark on their most complicated job yet."

She was a creature of the road, but her own road, in her own van, a self-contained world where she governed the speed, the route, and the radio station. The train was a different beast entirely. It was a metal tube hurtling through a landscape that blurred into an incomprehensible smear of green and grey, its speed dictated by an unseen driver and an unknowable schedule. She sat stiffly by the window, her hands clasped in her lap, watching the familiar, rugged contours of Scotland flatten into the neat, patchwork fields of northern England. It felt like a dilution, a weakening of the world she knew. Liam sat beside her, blissfully engrossed in a dense academic journal, his calm a stark contrast to the frantic monologue of anxieties running through her head. He would occasionally look up, catch her eye, and smile, a simple, reassuring gesture that was the only thing keeping the pressure gauge of her unease from red-lining.\n\nTheir arrival at King\u2019s Cross Station was not so much an arrival as an expulsion. The moment they stepped from the train, they were swept into a human current, a relentless tide of bodies and noise and frantic, unfocused energy. The scale of it was obscene. The station\u2019s vast, arched roof soared above them, but instead of creating a sense of space, it seemed to trap the thunderous roar of announcements, the screech of train brakes, and the echoing cacophony of a thousand simultaneous conversations. The air was thick with the smells of diesel, fast food, and a kind of generalised, urban grime. Sam felt her shoulders instinctively hunch, her personal space, which normally extended to the perimeter of her van, shrinking to the thin layer of her jacket. Liam, navigating the chaos with an ease that baffled her, grabbed her hand, his grip a solid, grounding anchor. \"Welcome to London,\" he shouted over the din. \"First, we brave the Underworld.\"\n\nThe London Underground was a special kind of hell, a complex and hostile system of pipes designed to move people instead of water, and far less efficiently. Sam, who could visualise the entire plumbing schematic of a three-storey hotel in her head, felt a dizzying sense of incompetence as she stared at the baffling, multicoloured spaghetti of the tube map. They were crammed into a carriage so tightly that she could feel the breath of the man standing behind her on her neck. The carriage swayed and screeched, plunging into a roaring darkness that was absolute. It was her worst nightmare: a cramped, dark, enclosed space that she had no understanding of and no power to fix. She focused on Liam\u2019s hand, the one solid point in a universe of suffocating chaos. He seemed to sense her rising panic, squeezing her fingers gently. \"Two more stops,\" he murmured, his voice a low, calm presence in her ear. When they finally surfaced, gasping, into the grey, drizzly light of a Bloomsbury street, Sam felt as though she had survived a near-death experience.\n\nThe hotel was exactly as Liam had advertised: grim. It was a tall, narrow building wedged between a fried chicken shop and a betting office, with a faint, dispiriting smell of damp and stale cigarette smoke in the hallway. Their room was tiny, with a sagging double bed, a single chair, and a window that looked out onto a brick wall. A persistent, rhythmic dripping sound was coming from the bathroom. Liam surveyed the room with a wry smile. \"It's not the St Andrews clubhouse, is it?\" he said. Sam, however, felt a strange sense of relief. She dropped her bag and went straight into the bathroom, her eyes immediately finding the source of the drip: a faulty washer in the hot tap of the tiny, stained basin. Her hands itched for her tools. This, she understood. This was a problem with a solution. \"The water pressure's abysmal,\" she announced, her voice filled with a professional authority that made her feel instantly more grounded. \"And this window isn't sealed properly. You can feel the draught.\" Liam laughed, a genuine, delighted sound. \"Of course,\" he said. \"Of course that's the first thing you notice. I knew you'd be fine.\"\n\nThat evening was the conference reception, held in the grand, echoing hall of a university building. Sam stood beside Liam, a glass of warm white wine in her hand, feeling like a faulty component wrongly installed in a high-end system. She had worn the black dress again, but here, surrounded by women in smart, academic-chic outfits and men in tweed jackets with leather elbow patches, it felt less like a choice and more like a surrender. The air was thick with the murmur of intellectual one-upmanship, a complex ballet of names, theories, and publications she didn't understand. Liam was a natural, moving through the crowd with an easy grace, introducing her to colleagues who would smile politely, ask her a vague question, and then immediately turn back to Liam to continue their intense debate about fourteenth-century shipping manifests. She felt invisible, an accessory, a silent plus-one in a world that had no language for what she did.\n\nThe moment she had been dreading arrived in the form of a tall, silver-haired man with a condescending smile and a name badge that read \u2018Dr. Alistair Finch\u2019. He had been holding court with Liam for several minutes, completely ignoring her presence. Finally, as if noticing her for the first time, he turned his watery gaze on her. \"And what about you, my dear?\" he asked, his tone that of a man trying to make conversation with a particularly slow child. \"Are you also in the field? A fellow historian, perhaps?\" Sam took a small sip of her terrible wine, the tartness a welcome jolt. The old Sam would have mumbled something vague and faded into the background. The new Sam, the Sam who had survived the Underground and diagnosed a faulty tap washer, looked him straight in the eye. \"No,\" she said, her voice clear and carrying in a momentary lull in the conversation. \"I'm a plumber.\"\n\nThe word landed in the middle of their little circle like a lump of lead. Dr. Finch blinked, his condescending smile faltering as he tried to process this unexpected data. \"A\u2026 plumber?\" he repeated, as if she had just claimed to be an astronaut. Before he could formulate a suitably dismissive response, Liam stepped closer, putting a proprietary arm around her shoulders. He didn't look embarrassed or flustered. He looked proud. \"Yes,\" Liam said, his voice warm and firm. \"Sam's the best plumber in Fife. She\u2019s an expert in catastrophic soil stack failures and high-pressure heating systems. She keeps St Andrews running. It's a far more important job than arguing about the price of wool in 1483, isn't it?\" He smiled directly at Dr. Finch, a bright, challenging smile that left the academic momentarily speechless. Sam felt a surge of warmth spread through her chest, a feeling so powerful it almost made her dizzy. He wasn't just defending her; he was celebrating her, right here, in the heart of his world.\n\nBack in the grim hotel room, the adrenaline of the evening wore off, leaving Sam feeling drained and hollowed out. She kicked off the uncomfortable shoes and peeled off the black dress with a sigh of relief, pulling on a comfortable, worn t-shirt and a pair of tracksuit bottoms. She felt like she had been acting a part for hours, and the performance had exhausted her. Liam was watching her, his expression thoughtful. \"You were amazing tonight,\" he said, coming to sit on the edge of the sagging bed beside her. \"The look on Finch's face. It was priceless.\" \"I felt like a spare part,\" she confessed, her voice low. \"Like a spanner at a tea party. I don't belong in that world, Liam.\" He didn't contradict her. He just nodded, accepting her feeling. \"Maybe not,\" he said. \"But you belong in my world. And my world was in that room tonight. That makes it your world too. You weren't a spare part. You were the anchor. The whole time, I just kept looking at you and thinking, 'She's the realest person in this entire building.'\"\n\nHe reached out and took her hand, his fingers lacing through hers. \"It's a two-way system, remember? You came here, into this place that\u2019s so alien to you, for me. That's a bigger deal than any conference.\" He leaned in and kissed her, a slow, gentle kiss that tasted faintly of cheap wine and had nothing to do with performance or pretence. It was a kiss that said, *we are here, together, and that is all that matters*. Later, as they lay in the lumpy bed, listening to the unfamiliar city sounds\u2014the distant wail of a siren, the rumble of a late-night bus, the incessant drip from the bathroom tap that Sam had mentally scheduled for repair\u2014she felt a profound shift within her. For years, home had been a place, a fortress with a single occupant. But lying here, in a grim, draughty room in a city she hated, wrapped in the arms of the man who saw her for exactly who she was, she finally understood. Home wasn't a set of coordinates on a map. It wasn't bricks and mortar. It was the steady, rhythmic sound of his breathing in the dark beside her. It was a portable system, and as long as they were connected, it would work anywhere."
