     "novel_text": "The light was a clean, white scalpel. It sliced through the hushed dimness of the spare bedroom, pinning a single, struggling point of life to a square of polished obsidian. Under the unforgiving glare of the articulated lamp, *Formica rufa*, the red wood ant, soldiered on, its antennae twitching in a frantic semaphore of confusion and alarm. Tonya watched, her breath a slow, controlled tide in her chest. Her world had shrunk to this two-inch stage, this tiny drama of one. She wore no mask, but her face was as serene and immobile as a surgeon\u2019s. Love required stillness. It demanded precision.\n\nShe\u2019d followed this one for two days. A magnificent specimen. The slight, almost imperceptible asymmetry in its gaster, the subtle russet shading on its thorax\u2014it was perfect in its imperfection. It was worthy. He would have liked this one. He would have spent an hour explaining its caste, its pheromonal language, the sheer evolutionary miracle of its existence. Tonya did not need the lecture anymore. She had absorbed it all, letting his knowledge colonize her, a new and sacred biome in the empty space he\u2019d left behind. Now, she was the curator of his passion.\n\nHer fingers, gloved in powder-free nitrile, moved with the unthinking grace of a concert pianist. She selected a pair of tweezers whose tips were ground to a near-molecular thinness. With a movement too swift for the ant to register, she nudged the tiny glass cloche covering it, creating a space just wide enough. The second instrument was a single human hair, plucked that morning, glued to the end of a delicate rod. She dipped its tip into a waiting bead of liquid glistening on a glass slide. Aconitine, extracted with painstaking effort from a single Wolf\u2019s Bane plant she cultivated in a black pot on her windowsill. It was a poison of myth. A poet\u2019s poison. It was fitting.\n\nThe ant, sensing the shift in air pressure, surged for the gap. Tonya was ready. The hair-tip applicator met the ant\u2019s antenna in a kiss of shocking intimacy. The creature froze. A tremor, a violent, microscopic shudder, ran the length of its segmented body. Its legs, so full of frantic purpose a moment ago, curled inward. It was over. The stillness that followed was profound, a vacuum. Tonya felt it in her own lungs. She held her breath with the deceased, a shared, final exhalation.\n\nThen, the second act. The art. She carefully transferred the tiny corpse to a block of black velvet, the same used by jewelers to display their finest solitaires. The posing was the most difficult part. It took an hour. Micro-forceps, stainless steel pins no thicker than a nerve ending, a magnifying visor that lowered over her eyes like a knight\u2019s helmet. She worked to arrange it not in a posture of life, but in a posture of offering. Its head was tilted, its legs arranged in a pattern of submission. And then, the lips. She preferred the term \u2018lips\u2019 to \u2018mandibles\u2019. Mandibles was a cold, chitinous word. Lips were for kissing, for speaking, for tasting. With a tool of her own design, a tiny lever of sharpened dental wire, she gently, reverently, parted them.\n\nThe camera, a hulking Canon with a macro lens the size of a fist, was already in position. She leaned in, her eye to the viewfinder. The world vanished. There was only this. The alien, terrifying, beautiful architecture of the ant\u2019s mouth. The serrated inner edges, the delicate palps, the textures invisible to the naked eye. It was a secret world. A world only she and he could ever truly appreciate. She adjusted the focus by a micron. The silence in the room was a held breath, waiting for a fever to break.\n\nClick.\n\nThe shutter\u2019s report was a soft, final punctuation. On the camera\u2019s screen, the image bloomed. A landscape of dreadful intimacy. She had captured it. The essence. The last, silent word spoken from those lips. Another photograph for the collection. Another testament to a love so large it had to be expressed in the smallest of deaths.\n\nFrom his non-place in the back corner of a Spokane library, the one on South Lincoln Street, DI Tales watched the image upload. It appeared on the photostream he monitored, a fresh wound among the old. The username was \u2018SymmetryForJ.\u2019 The photo was titled \u2018Red Word.\u2019 He felt the familiar, phantom chill, the one that had been his only constant companion for what felt like a lifetime. He was a doctor, or had been. He saw the world in terms of diagnosis. This was not art. This was a symptom.\n\nThe living moved around him like fish in a current he could not feel. A young woman with headphones on, her expression slack-jawed, walked through the space his left arm occupied. He felt nothing, of course. There was no substance to be disturbed. He was a draft of memory in a room full of warm bodies. He had long ago stopped flinching. His focus was absolute. He zoomed in on the image, not with a mouse and keyboard, but with a simple act of will. The picture filled his perception, a universe of texture and shadow.\n\n\u2018SymmetryForJ.\u2019 Tonya, he called her. He didn\u2019t know her real name, but she felt like a Tonya. Solid, grounded, with a hint of Slavic tragedy in her bones. He\u2019d built a profile in the empty chambers of his mind. Female, late 30s. Solitary. Highly intelligent, patient. Grieving. The \u2018J\u2019 was the key. J was the ghost she was trying to appease. The recipient of these macabre love letters.\n\nTales had been a diagnostician. He looked for patterns. At first, it was just the ants. Common Lasius niger. Then, the species began to diversify. Pavement ants. Carpenter ants. Now, Formica rufa, the red wood ant. The geography of her collection was expanding. The technique was improving, too. The early kills were clumsy, the carapaces sometimes crushed. Now, they were flawless. She was perfecting her craft. A surgeon honing her technique. The thought made the air in his non-lungs feel thin. Doctors, good ones, understood that a disease left untreated would metastasize. It would seek a larger host.\n\nHe had died on a Tuesday. A pulmonary embolism, silent and swift as an assassin. One moment he was complaining to his nurse, Martha, about the hospital\u2019s dreadful coffee, the next he was\u2026 observing. Watching his own body slump in his chair, watching the panic, the futile CPR, the pronouncement. He had been a man of science and substance. He was now a hypothesis, a ghost story. And the most frustrating part of his condition was the impotence. He was a detective who could not lift a fingerprint, a doctor who could not touch his patient. He could only watch. And worry.\n\nHe sifted through the data of the new photograph. She was getting bolder. The background of \u2018Red Word\u2019 was not the familiar polished obsidian. It was a piece of dark, rough-hewn wood. He willed the image to expand again, focusing on a sliver of the background. He could make out the grain. The unique, swirling pattern of a burl. Oak, maybe? And in the corner, a tiny detail she would have missed. A watermark. A faint, almost invisible stamp. A logo. He couldn\u2019t quite make it out. It was a circle with something inside. A bird? An initial?\n\nHe felt a surge of something that might have once been adrenaline. It was a lead. A tangible connection, however faint, to the physical world where she operated. He had to identify that mark. He had spent his life, his real one, solving puzzles inside the human body. This was no different. He was simply looking for the source of the infection. He had to find Tonya. He had to understand the shape of her love, the architecture of her grief. He had to stop her before she decided that ants were no longer enough. Before she looked for a larger vessel to hold all her terrible, beautiful devotion. The library was closing. The lights flickered once, a signal to the living. The patrons began to pack their bags, their movements solid and sure. Tales remained, a silent sentinel in the gathering dark, staring at a picture of a dead ant\u2019s lips, feeling the cold, inexorable certainty that he was the only one who knew a storm was coming.The janitor, a man named Gary whose weary slouch Tales had memorized like a medical chart, made his final round. His keys jangled a lonely, metallic tune as he locked the main doors, plunging the library into a cathedral-like quiet. For the living, the building was now empty. For Tales, it was finally his. He drifted from his corner, a silent eddy in the still air, and returned his full consciousness to the image of \u2018Red Word.\u2019 The physical screens had long since gone dark, but the image was seared into his perception, a slide under the microscope of his mind.\n\nHe pushed against the photograph, an act of pure will that had no physical correlation but felt like leaning into a strong wind. The watermark. The circle with the bird inside. The grain of the wood was a landscape of ridges and valleys, a topography he could almost feel. It was oak, he was almost certain, and the specific pattern was from a burl, a chaotic knot of growth that created the most beautiful, most unpredictable grains. J, the man for whom all this was done, must have appreciated such things. An appreciation for the complex beauty born from trauma and deviation. It was all of a piece. The imperfect ant, the burl wood, the grief that twisted love into this meticulous, murderous art.\n\nHis impotence was a physical ache, a phantom limb where his entire body used to be. In life, he would have been on the phone, delegating. He would have had a junior detective running license plates, an intern cross-referencing databases. He would have had his hands on the problem, palpating it for weaknesses. Now, he was reduced to this. A spectator, waiting for the world to bring him the clues he needed. The logo was a question he could not type into a search bar. He was a consciousness trapped in a bottle, and the entire internet, the greatest library in human history, was on the other side of the glass. He could only wait for someone else to turn the page.\n\n* * *\n\nAfter the final click, Tonya dismantled her world with the same reverence she had used to build it. The hulking Canon was powered down, its lens cap replaced with a soft thud. The tiny, posed corpse of the ant was transferred from the velvet block into a small glass-topped specimen box, which she labeled in a precise, architectural script: *Formica rufa, #27, Red Word*. It joined the others on a shelf in a temperature-controlled cabinet, a growing congregation of tiny martyrs. Each box was a votive, a prayer rendered in chitin and formaldehyde.\n\nShe stripped off the nitrile gloves, turning them inside out and sealing them in a small bag. Her tools were wiped down first with alcohol, then with a sterile cloth, before being laid back in their velvet-lined case. The tweezers, the micro-forceps, the hair-tip applicator, her custom-made mandible-lever\u2014they all rested in their form-fitting depressions, an arsenal of delicate violence. The obsidian square and the velvet block were polished and put away. The last piece to be moved was the block of burl wood. She ran her bare fingers over its chaotic, swirling grain. J had given it to her. It was a cheese board, meant for brie and prosciutto and gatherings with friends. A lifetime ago. He\u2019d bought it from a craftsman at a weekend market downtown. \u2018Look at the grain, Tonya,\u2019 he\u2019d said, his voice buzzing with the excitement he found in the details of the world. \u2018It\u2019s like a map of a storm.\u2019 Now, it was a stage. A beautiful, scarred landscape for her tragedies of one.\n\nHer small apartment was a testament to a life distilled to its essentials. Clean, spartan, a single black pot on the windowsill where the Wolf\u2019s Bane grew, its purple flowers a splash of royal poison against the grey Spokane sky. She didn\u2019t eat here, not really. She didn\u2019t entertain. She worked. She remembered. And she curated. She sat at her small desk and pulled up the photostream for \u2018SymmetryForJ.\u2019 She looked at \u2018Red Word\u2019 not as a photograph of a dead insect, but as a message sent into the ether. A message for an audience of one, who she knew could never see it. The intimacy of the image was the only way she could scream. The silence of her apartment was the only space vast enough to contain the echo.\n\n* * *\n\nThe sun rose, casting long, dusty fingers of light through the library\u2019s tall windows. The sounds of the city returned: the distant growl of traffic, the squeal of a bus\u2019s air brakes. Then came the rattle of Gary\u2019s keys, and the living began to trickle back in. Tales watched them, a current of purposeful bodies flowing around his stationary island of nothingness. A student, panicked about a deadline, raced to the history section. A homeless man, seeking warmth, settled into a carrel with a newspaper. A young mother steered her toddler towards the colourful promise of the children\u2019s wing. They were all closed loops, preoccupied with their own narratives.\n\nTales drifted, a disembodied observer, his focus a hunter\u2019s. He needed a specific kind of prey. Someone curious. Someone with a connection to craft, to wood, to local commerce. He floated behind a man in a flannel shirt who was poring over schematics for deck construction. For a moment, Tales felt a flicker of hope, but the man\u2019s search was purely practical, his queries filled with terms like \u2018load-bearing\u2019 and \u2018pressure-treated.\u2019 He was not looking for art. Tales moved on. He had all the time in the world, a fact that was both a comfort and a curse. His own life had been a frantic race against the clock, against the progress of disease. Now, he was suspended in an endless, agonizing waiting room.\n\nIt was well past noon when he found her. A young woman with dark-rimmed glasses and a silver stud in her nose. She sat at a terminal in the reference section, surrounded by books on Pacific Northwest art. Her posture was studious, her brow furrowed in concentration. Tales positioned himself behind her, his non-physical form perfectly placed to see her screen. She was writing a paper, the title at the top of the document read: \u2018From Totems to Tables: The Enduring Spirit of PNW Artisanship.\u2019 He felt it again, that ghost of adrenaline. This was it. She typed, her fingers flying across the keyboard. Her search query was a gift from a god he no longer believed in: \u201clocal Spokane woodcraft artisans.\u201d A page of results bloomed on the screen. A list of names and businesses. Tales scanned them, his focus narrowing. And then she clicked on a link. The website loaded, and the logo appeared, crisp and clear in the top left corner. A perfect circle. And inside, a stylized bird\u2014a wren, he now saw\u2014with its head cocked, its beak forming the cross-bar of a capital \u2018B\u2019. Below it, the words: \u2018Burl & Beak Woodcraft.\u2019 He had it. He had a name. It was a tangible piece of the world, a pin dropped on a map. For the first time since he had died, DI Tales had a destination. Now he just had to find a way to get there.The library was a cage, elegant and quiet, but a cage nonetheless. For weeks, or months\u2014time had become a viscous, unreliable fluid\u2014Tales had accepted its boundaries as the limits of his new reality. The world outside the tall arched windows was a silent film he could observe but not join. But now, with a name and a logo burned into his mind, the library\u2019s familiar silence felt like a suffocating pressure. \u2018Burl & Beak Woodcraft.\u2019 It was a location. A place of substance and sawdust, a place where Tonya had been. To a ghost, a physical coordinate was an impossible, taunting dream.\n\nHis attention snapped back to the young woman with the dark-rimmed glasses. She was his only chance. He watched as she saved her document, closed the browser tabs, and began to gather her belongings with the unhurried movements of someone whose day was winding down. A canvas tote bag, a dented metal water bottle, a worn copy of a book on forestry. Each item was a solid, real thing, a piece of a world he could no longer manipulate. She was his vessel, his unwitting ferryman. He had to try. He had spent his first life diagnosing the frailties of the human body; he would spend his second diagnosing the physics of his own dissolution.\n\nHe marshaled his focus, a power he was only beginning to understand. It felt like holding his breath and flexing a muscle that wasn't there. He concentrated everything he was, his memory, his worry, his fading identity, into a single point of intention aimed directly at her. As she slung the tote bag over her shoulder and began to walk towards the main exit, Tales pushed off from his corner, not moving through the air so much as willing himself to be adjacent to her. He felt a strange, elastic pull, as if he had become a satellite caught in the faint gravitational field of her life force.\n\nThe automatic doors slid open with a soft hiss, and the student stepped out into the late afternoon light. Tales followed, and the world exploded. For the first time since his death, he was outside. The sensory onslaught was a physical blow. The muted, dusty air of the library was replaced by a riot of smells: hot asphalt, diesel exhaust, the sweet, cloying scent of a flowering bush nearby. The quiet hum of the library\u2019s HVAC system was annihilated by the roar of a passing bus, its immense vibration passing through his formless state like a shockwave, leaving him feeling frayed and scattered. The sunlight was not the gentle, slanted beam he was used to, but a brilliant, brutal glare that seemed to make his own transparency shimmer and thin.\n\nHe fought to hold on. The pull to the student, his anchor, was the only thing that kept him from dissolving entirely or snapping back to the safe, dead quiet of the library. He was a kite in a hurricane, and she was the hand holding the string. She put her headphones on, oblivious, and crossed at the light, her head bobbing to a beat he couldn't hear. A cyclist swerved around her, and for a terrifying second, passed directly through Tales. The rush of kinetic energy and the fleeting, phantom sensation of a living, straining body was so alien, so overwhelming, that his concentration wavered. The world flickered, and for a half-second, he saw the familiar shelves of the library\u2019s biography section superimposed over the moving traffic. He clamped down with his will, the effort a silent scream. The street solidified around him again.\n\nHe was a parasite of perception, clinging to her as she walked west on Main Avenue. He didn't know where \u2018Burl & Beak\u2019 was. His knowledge of the city was a static memory from a life that felt increasingly like someone else\u2019s. He couldn't ask for directions. He couldn't pull a phone from a pocket that didn't exist and look at a map. He could only follow this oblivious stranger and pray that her path would bring him within range. He scanned the storefronts they passed, his gaze sweeping over coffee shops, boutiques, and law offices. He was hunting for a sign, a logo, a breadcrumb. He was a detective again, but his beat was now the crowded, chaotic streets of a city he could only haunt, chasing the ghost of a woman who was still very much alive.The student, his unwitting Charon, navigated the downtown grid with the aimless drift of someone with time to kill. For Tales, every step was a gamble. He had to learn the rules of this new state of being on the fly. He discovered that a crowd was a nightmare, a chaotic mass of life forces that threatened to pull him in a dozen different directions at once, diluting his will. He learned that proximity was key; if she got more than thirty feet ahead of him, the tether stretched thin and taut, and the safe, oppressive silence of the South Lincoln Street library would begin to hum at the edges of his perception, a siren call back to his cage. He was a deep-sea diver on a fragile air hose, and the library was his bell jar on the surface.\n\nShe paused to look in the window of a bakery, her attention caught by a pyramid of glazed lemon tarts. Tales drifted beside her, the phantom scent of sugar and browned butter a cruel memory. Through the glass, he watched a family laughing, a small boy smearing chocolate on his cheek. They were so vibrant, so solid. He felt a profound, hollow ache that had nothing to do with a body. It was the grief of being an annotation in the margin of a book everyone else was still living. The student, deciding against the tart, moved on, and Tales was pulled along in her wake, relieved and resentful in equal measure. Her simple, mundane choices were the arbiters of his fate.\n\nHer path took her away from the main thoroughfare and onto a quieter street of brick-fronted buildings, where the chain stores gave way to independent shops. Art galleries, a custom frame store, a shop selling hand-bound journals. The air here felt different, less frantic. It felt closer. Tales scanned every sign, every doorway, his focus a desperate searchlight. The student was walking with more purpose now, as if her destination was near. And then he saw it. Not where she was headed, but down a narrow intersecting lane she was about to pass. It was a modest sign, a disc of dark wood hanging from an iron bracket, swaying slightly in the breeze. On it, expertly carved, was the logo from the website. The wren, the circle, the elegant script beneath: *Burl & Beak Woodcraft*.\n\nIt was a moment of pure, clinical triumph, followed immediately by a surge of panic. His anchor, the student, was not turning. She was walking straight past the lane, her headphones a barrier to any plea he could never make. He could feel the distance growing, the tether stretching. Ten feet. Fifteen. The library hummed louder in his non-existent ears. He had a choice, and he had only a second to make it. He could stay with the safety of his living host, follow her wherever she was going, and hope he could find his way back to this spot another day, another week, another lifetime. Or he could let go. He could sever the connection and attempt the fifty-foot leap to the shop on his own, with no idea if his consciousness could survive such a transit untethered. It was the difference between a chronic condition and an acute, potentially fatal, event.\n\nHe made the choice a doctor makes when the conservative treatment has failed. He cut. With a final, desperate act of will, he focused everything he was\u2014the sum of his memories, his methodical mind, the full weight of his concern for the unknown Tonya\u2014on the wooden sign. He let go of the student. The sensation was terrifying, an abrupt and total disconnection. The world dissolved into a meaningless roar of sensory data. Light, sound, and motion blended into a nauseating, colorless storm. He was unmoored, a ghost in a hurricane, his very identity threatening to fray and shred into nothing. He was no longer observing the world; he was being consumed by it.\n\nThen, impact. Not physical, but existential. His fragmented perception slammed into a new focus and solidified. The chaotic noise of the street vanished, replaced by a profound, woody silence. He was inside. The air, if he could have breathed it, was thick with the clean, sharp scent of sawdust and the deeper, resinous perfume of tung oil. He had made it. He was in a small, beautifully curated showroom. Sunlight streamed through the front window, illuminating the intricate grains of finished furniture: a dining table with a live edge that flowed like a river, a set of chairs whose backs curved like human spines, shelves laden with bowls and cutting boards of every shape and size. It was a gallery of captured nature. And on a display stand near the back, he saw it. A stack of round oak burl cheese boards, their surfaces a maelstrom of swirling, chaotic patterns. One of them was missing. One of them was in Tonya\u2019s spare bedroom, serving as a stage for her tiny, perfect deaths. He was at the source.The workshop was a sanctuary of potential. Unlike the library, which was a repository of finished thoughts and closed histories, this place hummed with a silent, vibrant future. Half-finished chairs stood like skeletal promises, and massive slabs of raw, uncut lumber leaned against one wall, their bark still clinging like old memories. They were books waiting to be opened, stories waiting to be told. Tales drifted through the space, his formless state allowing him to pass through a workbench cluttered with chisels and hand planes, their steel edges gleaming under the dusty light. He felt a sense of profound, almost professional respect for the order within the chaos. This was a different kind of operating theater.\n\nHe came to a stop before the display stand. He focused on the stack of cheese boards, identical in shape but each one a unique universe of pattern. The wood grain swirled like cream in dark coffee, like weather patterns seen from space, like the intricate pathways of a neural network. He understood why J had been drawn to them, and why Tonya had chosen one as a stage. It was a beautiful scar. A geological event frozen in time. He ran his perception over the top board, imagining the weight and texture, the faint drag of its polished surface. He was a connoisseur of patterns, and this was a masterpiece of organized chaos, so much like the diseases he used to hunt.\n\nA door at the back of the showroom creaked open, and a man emerged from the dust-filled workshop beyond. He was broad-shouldered, in his late fifties maybe, with a thick grey beard that had captured a fine gilding of sawdust. He wore a heavy canvas apron over a faded flannel shirt, and his hands, as he wiped them on a rag, were wide and calloused, but moved with a surprising delicacy. He exuded a quiet, grounded energy, the polar opposite of the city's frantic pulse. This was the craftsman. The creator.\n\nThe man, oblivious to his spectral visitor, walked over to a magnificent walnut desk that was clearly his own handiwork. He grunted softly, a sound of satisfaction, as he picked up a small, hand-carved wren from its surface and blew a stray speck of dust from its wing. He then turned his attention to a tablet mounted on a wooden stand. With a swipe of a thick finger, the screen came to life. Tales drifted closer, his entire being constricting into a tight knot of focus. This was it. The point of access. The archive.\n\nThe craftsman tapped through several screens, his movements methodical. He was checking sales figures, cross-referencing them with an inventory list. Tales watched, a silent phantom hovering over his shoulder. The screen showed lists of items, prices, dates. It was a stream of raw data he was powerless to navigate himself. He could only wait, a beggar at the window of a banquet, hoping a scrap of information would be dropped. The man\u2019s finger hovered over a file labeled \u2018Spokane Weekend Market \u2013 Sales.\u2019 Tales felt the phantom charge of adrenaline again. J had bought the board at a market. This was the right vein.\n\nThe man opened the file. A list of transactions appeared, dated a little over a year ago. It was a long list, a successful weekend. The craftsman scrolled slowly, his brow furrowed slightly as he reconciled the numbers. Tales\u2019s perception devoured the screen, scanning names and item descriptions. *Cedar Box. Walnut Bowl. Cherry Spoon Set.* He saw names\u2014Miller, Chen, Rodriguez\u2014a litany of the living, the solid, the people who could buy things and take them home. He searched for a Tonya, a T., anything. Nothing. The craftsman was nearing the bottom of the list. A cold dread, the familiar feeling of a dead end, began to seep into Tales.\n\nThen the man\u2019s finger stopped. He tapped on a line, expanding it. Item: *Oak Burl Round Board, 12\u201d*. Date: a Saturday in late May. And there, under \u2018Customer,\u2019 was the name. It wasn\u2019t Tonya. It was a simple, elegant entry: J. Alistair Finch. Below it was an email address. J.A.Finch@spokane.edu.\n\nJ. Alistair Finch. The \u2018J\u2019 was no longer a variable. It was a man. A man with a name, a man with an affiliation to the local university. The entire architecture of the mystery shifted, its foundation settling into something solid. J wasn't just a ghost Tonya was grieving; he was a person who had lived and worked and bought things in this very city. Tales felt a surge of elation so pure it was almost painful. It was a diagnosis. He had found the patient\u2019s name on the chart.\n\nThe craftsman finished his task, locked the tablet, and returned to the tangible world of his workshop, the door closing behind him with a soft click. Tales was left alone in the silent showroom with the new, explosive piece of information. J. Alistair Finch. He repeated the name in his mind, engraving it into his memory. He had a name. It was the first solid thing he had held since he\u2019d died. And like everything solid, it was completely out of his reach. He was still a ghost in a locked room, but now he knew the name of the man who had built the prison. His focus shifted from the craftsman\u2019s shop to the wider world beyond the windows. Spokane University. It was another pin on the map, a place miles away. He had learned to jump, but it had nearly shredded him. Now, he had to figure out how to fly.The elation was a flash of heat, a magnesium flare that burned brightly for a moment before sputtering out, leaving behind the cold, grey ash of his reality. J. Alistair Finch. Spokane University. The information was a key, but he was standing on the wrong side of a locked and soundproofed door. The woodshop, once a thrilling destination, now felt like another room in his prison. Its quietude, once a relief from the street, was now the silence of a dead end. He had to move. The infection, he knew, was not centered here; this was merely a point of transmission. The true pathology was rooted in the life and memory of Professor Finch.\n\nHe drifted to the front window, his form shimmering in the afternoon sun. The lane outside was quiet, but at its mouth, the main street was a river of metal and intention. Cars, trucks, delivery vans\u2014each a private, sealed container moving at impossible speeds. He had nearly disintegrated making a fifty-foot jump. A cross-town journey of several miles was unthinkable. Then he saw it. A city bus, long and articulated like some gentle, herbivorous beast, pulled to a stop a block away. Its doors folded open with a pneumatic sigh, disgorging a handful of people and swallowing a new group. It was a vessel. A public, mobile container full of the very life force he\u2019d learned to use as an anchor. It wasn't one person he could lose, but a dozen he could cling to, a floating raft of souls. The plan formed in his mind with the swift, intuitive logic of a differential diagnosis. It was reckless, untried, and his only option.\n\nLeaving the sanctuary of Burl & Beak was just as jarring as his first exit from the library. He braced himself, focusing on the bus as his target, and pushed through the window. The world rushed in again, a cacophony of roaring engines, distant sirens, and the sharp, unfiltered sunlight that made him feel thin and transparent. He fought the sensory overload, his will a thread stretched to its breaking point, and threw himself toward the bus just as its doors began to close. He passed through the glass and metal shell, the transition like a gasp of cold water, and found himself inside. The chaos of the street was instantly muffled, replaced by a low, vibrating hum and a dense, soupy atmosphere of human presence. The air was thick with stale perfume, damp coats, and the collective, low-grade anxieties and daydreams of two dozen strangers. He was a virus that had successfully breached the cell wall.\n\nThe journey was a new kind of vertigo. The world slid past the windows at a speed that felt both unreal and deeply unsettling, the familiar city rendered into a fluid blur. Tales anchored himself not to a single person, but to the general, ambient life of the bus itself. He felt the dull throb of a teenager\u2019s bass-heavy music through her headphones, the weary frustration of a man who\u2019d missed his stop, the quiet contentment of an elderly woman watching the world go by. He was awash in the mundane currents of their lives, a ghost on public transport, invisible, unnoticed, and more lonely than he had ever been in his silent library. He scanned the faces, the postures, the tired expressions, seeing them all with a clinician\u2019s eye. A city of symptoms. The bus route, blessedly, angled toward the university district, and when he saw the grand, collegiate gothic architecture of the Spokane University gates loom into view, he felt a phantom relief so profound it was almost a physical sensation. As the bus sighed to a stop, he prepared himself and plunged back out into the world.\n\n* * *\n\nTonya sat in the dimness of her spare bedroom, the sacred space. The photograph of \u2018Red Word\u2019 glowed on her monitor. It was, by all technical measures, perfect. The focus was flawless, the lighting dramatic. The offering was clear. And yet, it felt inadequate. A whisper when she needed a shout. Her love for J, his passion which was now her passion, was an immense, roaring thing. An ant, no matter how magnificent, no matter how poetically dispatched, felt like a single, insufficient syllable in a vast, complex language of grief. J had been a man who saw entire ecosystems in a single drop of pond water, who could discourse for an hour on the brutal elegance of a hornet\u2019s sting or the iridescent shimmer of a dragonfly\u2019s wing. He had taught her to see the universe in the small, and now her grief demanded she find a larger microcosm.\n\nShe turned away from her own work and opened a new browser window. Her fingers, no longer gloved but just as precise, typed a search query into the bar. *Mantidae*. The screen filled with images that were both monstrous and beautiful. Praying mantises. Their triangular heads, their intelligent, alien eyes, their powerful, spiked forelegs folded in mock piety. They were predators, patient and ruthless. They were cannibals. Their postures seemed to mimic human emotion in a way that an ant\u2019s frantic scuttling never could. A posture of prayer. A posture of judgment. She clicked through the images, her face as still and focused as it was when she held the aconitine-tipped hair. She was a curator seeking a new centerpiece for her collection. Her love demanded it. It demanded precision, but it also demanded escalation. The thought settled in her with a calm, cold certainty. She would need a larger cloche.\n\n* * *\n\nThe university campus was a world unto itself. Unlike the weary, transient energy of the bus, this place thrummed with a nervous, ambitious vitality. Students flowed like blood cells through the arteries of the main quad, their minds full of deadlines, romantic entanglements, and the vast, terrifying promise of the future. Tales felt the energetic hum of it all, but it was a frequency he could no longer tune to. He was a memory haunting a place dedicated to new knowledge. He had one goal: find the digital ghost of J. Alistair Finch. He gravitated instinctively toward the largest, most imposing building on the quad, a cathedral of learning with \u2018Foley Library\u2019 carved above its stone archway. Another library. It seemed the dead were drawn to repositories of the past.\n\nInside, the atmosphere was a startling fusion of old and new. The scent of aging paper and leather bindings mingled with the faint, electronic heat of a thousand laptops. It was brighter, louder, and far more crowded than his quiet corner on South Lincoln Street. He drifted through the main reference hall, a silent observer in a hive of activity. He needed a screen, an access point. He found one in a carrel where a young man with a perpetually furrowed brow was frantically typing a paper. Tales waited, a patient predator. His opportunity came when the student, exhausted, leaned back and opened a new tab to mindlessly scroll a news feed. It was here that Tales discovered a new, subtle aspect of his condition. He couldn\u2019t touch the keyboard, but by concentrating his will, his desperate need, he could create a faint psychic pressure, a whisper of suggestion in the user\u2019s own mind. A stray thought. *Department faculty page*. *Professor name*. It was like trying to steer a ship by blowing on its sail.\n\nHe focused his intent, a silent, desperate prayer aimed at the distracted student. *Entomology. Finch.* The student\u2019s eyes glazed over for a moment, then he shook his head as if to clear it. He typed \u2018Spokane University English Department\u2019 into the search bar. A dead end. Tales recoiled, the effort leaving him feeling thin and frayed. His influence was negligible, a statistical anomaly in the noise of a human mind. He would have to wait. He drifted to the next terminal, and the next, a ghost begging for a glimpse of a memory. It took an hour, an eternity of watching students research dead poets and obscure economic theories. Finally, a young woman researching local ecological topics navigated to the university\u2019s Biology department website. From there, it was a single click to the Entomology sub-department. And there he was.\n\nThe name was at the top of a short list of faculty. *J. Alistair Finch, Professor (Emeritus)*. Next to it was a photograph. The man had a warm, intelligent face, etched with laugh lines around kind, inquisitive eyes. He wore a field shirt and a wide-brimmed hat, and he was smiling, a genuine, unforced smile that seemed to encompass the whole world. This was J. This was the man who had loved the chaotic beauty of burl wood and the pheromonal language of ants. This was the source of Tonya\u2019s terrible devotion. Below his name and title were links to his publications\u2014papers with titles like \u2018Swarm Intelligence in *Tetramorium immigrans*\u2019 and \u2018The Role of Asymmetry in Mate Selection of *Vespula pensylvanica*.\u2019 It was a map of his mind, the very knowledge that had colonized Tonya. And then Tales saw the final link, placed at the very bottom of the page. It was a simple, three-word hyperlink that felt as heavy as a tombstone. \u2018In Memoriam: Dr. Finch.\u2019 With a will that was not his own, the student clicked the link. A new page loaded. It contained the photograph again, but this time it was accompanied by a block of text. Tales drank it in, the final pieces of the diagnosis clicking into place. \u201cA brilliant entomologist, a beloved mentor\u2026 passed away suddenly last spring\u2026 a tragic hiking accident near Palouse Falls\u2026 a place he loved for its stark beauty and unique insect populations.\u201d A fall. Not a quiet, peaceful end, but a sudden, violent severance. A trauma. And in that one, awful, elegant word, DI Tales finally understood the shape of Tonya\u2019s grief. It wasn't a sickness. It was a wound. A raw, gaping wound she was trying to suture, one tiny, perfect stitch at a time.The diagnosis had been made. J. Alistair Finch. Palouse Falls. A traumatic, accidental death. Staring at the smiling, sun-weathered face on the university\u2019s memorial page, Tales felt the cold, analytical framework of his investigation dissolve. This was not a puzzle to be solved, but a wound to be understood. The morbid artistry of \u2018SymmetryForJ\u2019 was not the symptom of a deranged mind, but the desperate, ritualistic language of a shattered one. Tonya was not building a collection; she was trying to reconstruct a world, to speak to a man whose entire philosophy was contained in the minute, elegant architecture of the creatures she now sacrificed. The precision wasn't psychopathy; it was reverence.\n\nHe was a doctor again, standing over a patient he could not touch, reading a chart he could not write in. The patient was Tonya, and her sickness was grief. The locus of infection was the memory of a man, and the site of the initial trauma was a place of stark beauty and sudden violence miles away from the city. Palouse Falls. The name echoed in the silent chambers of his consciousness. To get there was to visit the scene of the crime that had created all the others. But the journey presented an obstacle that felt absolute. The chaotic, fifty-foot leap across the street from the library had nearly discorporated him. A journey of a hundred miles over open country, with nothing to anchor him but the empty sky and the rushing earth, was a form of suicide he wasn\u2019t sure he could even commit. He needed a vehicle, not of steel and glass, but of flesh and blood.\n\nHis will, a newly discovered and subtle instrument, prodded at the mind of the student staring at the screen. It wasn't control, but a gentle, targeted suggestion, like a therapist guiding a patient toward a painful memory. *Scroll down. See who remembered him.* The student\u2019s finger twitched on the mouse, and the page moved, revealing a section beneath the official eulogy. A comment thread. A digital condolence book filled with the grief of colleagues and the fond reminiscences of former students. Tales scanned the entries, his perception drinking in the words. \u201cA true mentor.\u201d \u201cHe made me see the world differently.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll never forget his lecture on parasitic wasps.\u201d Then, near the bottom, he found it. The entry was shorter than the others, its professionalism a stark contrast to the emotional outpourings around it. It was from a user named \u2018T. Vance.\u2019 It read: \u2018An irreplaceable mind. His curation of the departmental teaching collection was an inspiration.\u2019 The words were a shock of recognition. *Curation*. The very word he had used to describe Tonya\u2019s work. And the initial, T. Tonya Vance. The name felt right. It felt solid. She wasn\u2019t just a ghost\u2019s obsession; she was an apprentice who had lost her master, a curator left alone in the museum.\n\nThe decision had settled in her heart with the quiet finality of a closing door. Ants were a language of the soil, of the collective. They were prose. She needed poetry. She needed a creature whose form was a statement, whose life was a solitary drama. Her old, reliable sedan, kept as meticulously as her surgical tools, carried her away from her quiet street and toward the city's industrial periphery. She bypassed the bright, family-friendly pet stores in favor of a low, cinder-block building tucked away in a row of auto body shops and plumbing suppliers. A simple, hand-painted sign read \u2018The Reptile Annex.\u2019 Inside, the air was warm and heavy, a cocktail of damp earth, heated water, and the faint, musky scent of life held in careful suspension. It was a library of living things, their stories told in scales and carapaces instead of paper and ink.\n\nShe did not browse the terrariums filled with sleeping pythons and watchful geckos. Her purpose was too specific for idle curiosity. She approached the counter, behind which a man with heavily tattooed forearms was carefully adjusting the nozzle of a misting system. He looked up, his expression one of weary patience. Tonya spoke, and her voice, unused for hours, was a low and steady thing, devoid of hesitation. \u201cI need a *Hierodula membranacea*. A subadult female, if you have one.\u201d She used the scientific name without affectation. It was simply the correct term. The man\u2019s eyebrows rose in surprise, his practiced spiel for amateur lizard enthusiasts dying on his lips. This was not a casual customer. He nodded slowly, wiping his hands on his jeans. \"The Giant Asian. Right. We have a few. They're temperamental.\" Tonya\u2019s face remained a serene mask. \"I'm aware,\" she said. \"Temperament is what I'm looking for.\"\n\nBack at the university, Tales had a name and a destination, a combination that felt both potent and useless. He abandoned the library, a place of past knowledge, and drifted toward the source: the Entomology Department. The building was quieter, more focused. Hallways were lined with glass-fronted cabinets displaying insect collections, J. Alistair Finch\u2019s legacy in a thousand pinned specimens. Tales was a ghost haunting a mausoleum that was still, somehow, alive. He floated from office to lab, a spectre in the halls of science, searching for his ride. He observed a pair of grad students arguing cheerfully over mite classifications, and an old professor, a contemporary of Finch\u2019s, staring blankly out his window, lost in a memory Tales could only guess at. He was looking for motion, for intent, for a thread of purpose that led out of the city and toward the falls.\n\nHe found it pinned to a cork bulletin board, a low-tech node of communication in a high-tech world. It was a simple, laser-printed flyer. At the top, in a bold font, it read: \u2018Pilgrimage to Palouse.\u2019 Tales drew near, his form so close to the cork he could see the individual fibers. The text announced a field trip to Palouse Falls State Park for the upcoming weekend. \u2018To collect soil and insect samples for the new J. Alistair Finch Memorial Archive.\u2019 It was an act of communal grieving, a scientific wake. A young man with kind eyes and a nervous energy was tacking a sign-up sheet below the flyer. As he smoothed the paper, Tales saw the name at the top of the list: \u2018Ben Carter (Organizer).\u2019 Ben Carter, a grad student continuing his mentor\u2019s work in the very place his mentor had died. Tales had found his ferryman. As Ben gathered his things to leave, a backpack filled with empty vials and data sheets, Tales braced himself. This would be a long journey, tethered to a single consciousness. It was a journey into the open country of another man\u2019s grief, and to the very edge of the cliff where it all began. He prepared to make the leap.The new stage was a glass cube, a miniature world of soil, moss, and tangled branches. Tonya had spent the afternoon constructing it, her movements as deliberate as a god designing a habitat. The frantic, two-inch drama of the ant was replaced by a slow, cold-blooded theatre of stillness. Inside the terrarium, the praying mantis, the *Hierodula*, waited. It was a creature of impossible angles, a living piece of origami crafted from jade and menace. Unlike the ant, it did not scurry or panic. It moved with a liquid, unnerving slowness, or held poses of absolute stillness for minutes at a time, its triangular head swiveling in smooth, intelligent arcs. It watched Tonya with its vast, composite eyes, and she felt not like an observer, but a participant in a silent, two-sided appraisal. This was not a subject to be dispatched with a simple, poisoned kiss. This was a presence, an entity. It demanded a different kind of respect, a more complex liturgy.\n\nThe tethering to Ben Carter was nothing like the chaotic surf of the city bus. It was a deep, quiet immersion. As Ben drove his dusty university pickup out of the city and into the rolling, dun-colored hills of the Palouse, Tales felt himself sink into the young man\u2019s consciousness. He did not see Ben\u2019s memories as a film, but he felt their emotional weight, their specific gravity. The primary, overwhelming sensation was a clean, aching sadness, a student\u2019s grief for a beloved mentor. It was a healthy, uncomplicated wound, worlds away from the septic, festering trauma that defined Tonya. Woven through the sadness were threads of earnest purpose and scientific curiosity. Ben was here to honor a man by continuing his work, a stark and painful contrast to Tonya, who honored him by meticulously destroying his favorite things.\n\nThe journey east was a disembodying experience for a being already without a body. The dense tapestry of human life that made up the city thinned out, leaving Tales feeling exposed and fragile. The truck moved through a vast, empty landscape of wheat fields that stretched to the horizon, a golden sea under a pale, endless sky. He felt the psychic vacuum of the open space, the lack of ambient life force to buffer his existence. His connection to Ben was his only anchor in the immensity of the world, a single, warm point in a great coldness. He clung to the grad student\u2019s focused grief, using it as a shield against the annihilating emptiness of the plains, a ghost hiding in the shadow of another man\u2019s sorrow.\n\nIn the spartan quiet of her apartment, Tonya performed a new part of the ritual. With the same delicate forceps she had used to pose the ant, she opened a small plastic container. A single, large cricket, black and glossy, scrambled inside. She had not fed the ants; they were soldiers taken from their endless war. This was different. This was a sacrifice to a different kind of god. With a steady hand, she introduced the cricket into the glass cube. For a long moment, nothing happened. The mantis remained a statue of green blades. The cricket, sensing danger, froze. Then, in a movement too swift for the human eye to properly track, one of the mantis\u2019s serrated forelegs shot out, a biological spring-trap. It seized the cricket, impaling it. Tonya watched, her breath held, as the mantis began to eat, its alien mouthparts working with a brutal, dispassionate efficiency. She was not horrified. She was studying. She was learning the mechanics of a predator, the cold geometry of its hunger.\n\nThe first sign of Palouse Falls was not a sight but a sound, a low, persistent roar that grew from a whisper on the edge of hearing to a deep, chest-vibrating thunder. As Ben Carter pulled the truck into the gravel lot of the state park, Tales felt the raw power of the place like a physical blow. It was a wound in the earth, a massive basalt canyon carved by ancient floods, with a waterfall plunging into its depths with relentless force. The air was cool and charged with mist, carrying the scent of wet rock and sage. This was not the gentle, intellectual beauty of an insect\u2019s wing or the chaotic pattern of burl wood. This was a landscape of violence and awe, a place where a man could feel both infinite and infinitesimal. Tales did not need to see the memorial plaque to know that this was a fitting place for a life to end.\n\nBen got out of the truck, his movements losing their academic briskness, becoming slow and heavy. He walked to the viewing rail at the canyon's edge, his hands gripping the cool metal pipe so tightly his knuckles shone white. He was no longer a scientist collecting samples; he was a mourner standing at a precipice that was both literal and metaphorical. He stared out, not at the waterfall itself, but to a section of the opposing cliff face, a sheer drop of dark, hexagonal rock formations. His memory, a sharp, stabbing image, bled through to Tales\u2019s perception: a flash of a wide-brimmed hat tumbling through the air, a fleeting, terrible silhouette against the sky. Tales felt the echo of the young man\u2019s panic, the helpless shout caught in his throat. This was the spot. The place where the world had broken. He was standing at ground zero of Tonya\u2019s pain.\n\nThe mantis, having consumed its offering, began to meticulously clean itself. It drew each spiked foreleg through its mandibles, a cat grooming itself after a meal, a murderer wiping his blade. Tonya watched, her face illuminated by the soft light of the terrarium. She had given it a name. She called it Alistair. It felt right. A tribute, not a mockery. The hulking Canon camera stood on its tripod in the corner of the room, its lens cap still on, a sleeping cyclops. There was no poison on the glass slide, no velvet block waiting. This was not an execution to be performed, but a relationship to be cultivated. The stillness in the room was no longer a vacuum of loss, but a space of shared presence. In the dim light, the woman and the insect were two perfect statues of patience, two predators locked in a silent understanding, each waiting for the precise, inevitable moment when the art would demand its consummation.The roar of the falls was a constant, physical pressure. It was not a sound one simply heard; it was a force that vibrated in the rock, in the air, in the very structure of Ben Carter\u2019s bones. For Tales, it was a scouring static that threatened to overwhelm the delicate anchor of his host\u2019s consciousness. He held on, focusing on the specific, localized grief radiating from the young man, a small, warm signal in a tempest of white noise. Ben, after a long moment of silent communion with the abyss, shook himself and walked back to the truck. He returned not with recreational gear, but with the tools of his trade: a sturdy field case, a set of soil samplers, and an array of specimen jars. He was here to work. He was here to build a memorial out of data.\n\nHe began on a narrow, dusty trail that skirted the canyon\u2019s rim. With each step away from the main viewing area, the sounds of the few other tourists faded, swallowed by the waterfall\u2019s monolithic voice. Tales drifted alongside him, a silent partner on this pilgrimage. He saw the world through a dual lens: his own ghostly, detached observation, and the overlay of Ben\u2019s academic focus. Where Tales saw a scrubby bush, Ben\u2019s mind supplied the name, *Artemisia tridentata*, and noted the species of gall wasp that favored its stems. This was how Finch had seen the world, a landscape teeming with hidden languages and intricate, interlocking lives. It was a beautiful, complex vision, and Tales could feel the profound loss of it in the quiet diligence of his guide.\n\n* * *\n\nIn the artificial twilight of her apartment, Tonya\u2019s ritual had found a new rhythm. The frantic, condensed timeline of the ant\u2014the hunt, the capture, the swift execution\u2014was gone. This new phase was one of cohabitation. She sat at a small drawing table she had set up opposite the terrarium, a graphite pencil moving with slow precision across a sheet of heavy paper. She was not drawing the mantis. She was mapping it. She sketched the elegant, serrated curve of its raptorial foreleg, the exact angle of its head as it swiveled to watch her, the delicate, veined pattern of its wings. Each drawing was an anatomical study, an act of intense, unblinking observation. She was learning its architecture, its physical vocabulary.\n\nShe noted its habits. It favored a particular branch to hold its long, patient vigils. It groomed itself with an unnerving, humanoid deliberation. It ignored the water droplets she misted onto the glass, preferring to drink from the moisture collected on a moss-covered twig. These were not random behaviors; they were choices. Preferences. They were the nascent signs of a personality, a character she could distill. She was no longer a mere photographer of the dead. She was a biographer, and her subject, this silent, green predator named Alistair, was revealing its secrets to her one tiny, deliberate movement at a time. The thought of the aconitine, the violent, convulsive poison, now seemed brutish and clumsy. An insult. The art of this death would require a different science. It would have to be a quiet passage, a stillness descending upon a stillness, leaving the subject\u2019s final, perfect posture wholly intact.\n\n* * *\n\nThe trail dipped and wound its way along the basalt cliffs. Ben stopped at a point where the rock face sheered away, creating a natural alcove sheltered from the wind and mist. It was a quiet spot, a pocket of relative silence where the waterfall\u2019s roar was a background hum rather than an assault. Ben set down his case and knelt, his movements becoming reverent. Through the filter of his mind, Tales understood. This was one of J\u2019s spots. A place he would come to sit, to think, to observe the tiny, tenacious plants that clung to life in the cracks of the volcanic rock. Ben ran a hand over the cool stone, and a memory, vivid and complete, bloomed in his consciousness, pulling Tales into it like a tide.\n\nIt was from the week before the accident. Ben and Finch were sitting in this very spot, sharing a thermos of coffee. The sun was warm on the rocks. Finch was not talking about insects. He was quiet, his gaze fixed on the opposite wall of the canyon. \u201cLook at it, Ben,\u201d Finch had said, his voice softer than usual. \u201cPerfect hexagonal columns. A miracle of cooling basalt. Nature\u2019s geometry.\u201d He paused, taking a sip of coffee. \u201cAnd yet, it\u2019s not perfect, is it? Look there.\u201d He had pointed to a place where the pattern was broken, where a massive fissure fractured the neat columns. \u201cThat\u2019s the most interesting part. The flaw. The asymmetry. It\u2019s where the stress was greatest, where the change happened. People think symmetry is strength, but perfect symmetry is a kind of death. It\u2019s static. Life\u2026 life is asymmetrical.\u201d\n\nThe memory deepened, the emotional tone shifting from academic curiosity to a surprising, raw vulnerability. Finch had looked at Ben, his usual buoyant energy replaced by a deep-seated weariness. \u201cI\u2019ve spent my life studying the beautiful, logical systems of the hive, the swarm. Everything in its place. A perfect, functional whole.\u201d He gestured vaguely toward his own chest. \u201cBut my own life\u2026 so much\u2026 imbalance. Things I should have said. Roads not taken. It\u2019s all lopsided, Ben.\u201d He had forced a smile, but it didn\u2019t reach his kind eyes. \u201cOne day, you get to an age where you realize you can\u2019t go back and fix the symmetry. You\u2019re just left with the beautiful, crooked thing you\u2019ve built.\u201d\n\nThe memory faded, leaving behind the echo of that quiet confession and the sharp, present-day sting of Ben\u2019s grief. But for Tales, the words resonated with the force of a tectonic shift. *SymmetryForJ*. It wasn\u2019t a tribute to his passion for nature\u2019s perfection. It was an answer to his deepest, most personal regret. Tonya wasn\u2019t creating symmetrical art *for* J to appreciate. She was trying to create the symmetry *he felt he lacked*. She was trying to fix his life, to correct the 'beautiful, crooked thing' he\u2019d left behind. Her tiny, perfect corpses, posed in offering, were not just love letters. They were retroactive repairs. They were attempts to restore a spiritual balance, to posthumously grant a dying man\u2019s wish. And Tales felt a new, colder dread settle upon him. He had thought her grief might metastasize, that she might move from ants to a larger host. He was wrong. Her project was not about scale. It was about significance. And what could be more significant, more asymmetrical, more of a beautiful, crooked thing, than a human life?The revelation settled in Tales not like a clarifying light, but like a plunge into icy water. It stole the air from his non-existent lungs and replaced it with a dreadful, crystalline certainty. *You\u2019re just left with the beautiful, crooked thing you\u2019ve built.* J\u2019s words, echoing through the filter of Ben Carter\u2019s memory, were the final, missing piece of the diagnostic puzzle. Tonya\u2019s meticulous murders were not an act of madness, but a terrible, misguided act of restorative surgery on a dead man\u2019s soul. She was trying to un-crook the thing he had built, to grant him in death the perfect symmetry he had confessed to lacking in life. The scale of her love, and the scale of her delusion, was breathtaking.\n\nBen packed his soil samples with a quiet reverence, each labeled vial a small act of faith, a continuation. He was preserving J\u2019s world, while Tonya was perfecting it through annihilation. The two students, the two apprentices, were engaged in the same project of remembrance, but working from opposite ends of creation. As Ben began the hike back toward the parking lot, the rhythmic crunch of his boots on the gravel trail felt to Tales like the ticking of a clock, each step bringing him closer to a city where a much more dangerous experiment was underway. He could no longer afford to be a passive observer, a diagnostician reviewing a cold case. He was a doctor on call, and his patient was bleeding out.\n\nIn her quiet, temperature-controlled room, Tonya had moved beyond simple reverence. She was now an acolyte in a temple of one. The terrarium containing Alistair was no longer a cage, but an altar, and she, its humble student. She had abandoned the camera, for now. Photography was the art of the finished moment, and this was a process. On a clean, white sheet of paper, she was rendering the mantis\u2019s foreleg, the one that had snatched the cricket from its brief existence. Her graphite pencil traced the rows of needle-sharp spines with anatomical precision. It was an instrument of shocking violence, but in its design, she saw a terrible, elegant logic. It was a tool perfectly suited to its purpose.\n\nHer own tools, she now realized, had been crude. The aconitine was a cataclysm, a neurological storm that tore through its victim. It was asymmetrical. It was messy. It was wrong. Her mission was to correct imbalance, not introduce more of it. A perfect death, a truly symmetrical offering, would be a death without struggle. A gentle subtraction. A cessation. Her fingers left the drawing and moved to her laptop. She did not search for poisons. Her search terms were clinical, sterile. *Anoxia. Inert gas hypoxia. Nitrogen displacement.* She read papers on humane methods of animal euthanasia, on the physiology of oxygen deprivation. The descriptions were of a quiet, painless fading, a gentle slide into unconsciousness from which there was no return. It was a death of profound stillness, a descent into perfect, metabolic equilibrium. It was the death a curator would choose. A poet\u2019s death, fitting for the lips of a creature named Alistair.\n\nThe drive back to Spokane was a long, silent meditation. Ben Carter steered the truck through the immense, undulating landscape, his mind replaying the day, the waterfall\u2019s roar, the weight of his mentor\u2019s last confession. The grief was not sharp anymore; it was a vast, heavy blanket. Tales felt the change in the psychic atmosphere. The frantic energy of the city was a distant memory, and Ben\u2019s mind, softened by sorrow and the hypnotic emptiness of the highway, was more pliable, more open than it had ever been. This was his chance. It was a desperate, long-shot procedure, but the only one he had. He marshaled the entirety of his focus, the full force of his disembodied will, and aimed it at the quiet, grieving man behind the wheel.\n\nHe didn't try to push a sentence or a command. It would be like trying to scream a paragraph through a keyhole. He had to be a catalyst, not an author. He focused on a single, resonant word, a word that now held the key to the entire pathology: *Symmetry*. He pushed the concept, the shape of it, the feeling of it, into the quiet spaces of Ben\u2019s thoughts. He poured all of his urgency and fear into that one, perfect, balanced word. For a long moment, nothing happened. Then, Ben blinked, his brow furrowing slightly. He shook his head, a subtle, almost imperceptible motion. \"Symmetry,\" he murmured aloud to the empty cab, the word sounding strange and out of place. He frowned, trying to catch the thread of the thought. *Dr. Finch\u2026 he was talking about symmetry\u2026 the diatoms\u2026* The memory of a lecture slide showing the hypnotic, geometric beauty of microscopic algae flashed through his mind. It was close, but it wasn't the connection Tales needed.\n\nUndeterred, Tales pushed again, harder this time, the effort leaving him feeling thin and transparent, as if he were being stretched to the point of tearing. He added the second element, the catalyst for it all. *J*. The letter, the initial, the man. *Symmetry. J.* The two concepts hammered at the edge of Ben's consciousness. Ben\u2019s hand, resting on the steering wheel, tightened. A new thought surfaced, unbidden. A username he\u2019d seen somewhere. A comment on a forum? A student\u2019s online gallery? It was a flicker at the edge of his memory, an annoying, half-recalled bit of digital detritus. *SymmetryForJ*. The name came to him whole. He didn\u2019t know where he\u2019d seen it or what it meant, but it snagged in his mind like a burr, an insistent, illogical conjunction of a scientific principle and a person. He shook his head again, more forcefully this time, dismissing it as a weird artifact of a long, emotional day. But the seed was planted. It was a foreign body, an anomaly in the clean data of his thoughts, and Ben Carter was a scientist. And scientists, above all else, were trained to investigate anomalies. Tales, exhausted and frayed, held on, knowing he had done all he could. He had turned the detective into a piece of evidence, and now he could only wait for him to be discovered.The return to the city felt like a slow re-entry into a fever dream. The vast, elemental silence of the Palouse was replaced by the complex, layered hum of Spokane, a noise that felt dissonant and frantic to Tales after the clean roar of the falls. He remained a silent passenger in Ben Carter\u2019s life, a ghost haunting the passenger seat of a dusty pickup truck, his existence a fragile state of sustained observation. The seed he had planted in the young man\u2019s mind, the anomalous phrase *SymmetryForJ*, was a silent, ticking bomb, and Tales could only watch and wait for it to detonate in the quiet, orderly landscape of Ben\u2019s scientific mind.\n\nBack in the sterile confines of the entomology lab, Ben tried to lose himself in the familiar rituals of his work. He carefully transferred the soil samples from Palouse Falls into labeled petri dishes, preparing them for microscopic analysis. This was the work of continuation, the slow, methodical process of understanding a legacy. But the process was contaminated. The phrase kept surfacing, a piece of nonsensical data that defied categorization. *SymmetryForJ*. It felt like a song lyric stuck in his head, but without a tune. He\u2019d try to focus on the delicate structure of a beetle\u2019s antenna under the microscope, and the word \u2018symmetry\u2019 would assert itself, pulling his thoughts back to the strange, sad confession of his mentor on the cliff\u2019s edge, and the inexplicable username that seemed to echo it.\n\nWhile Ben struggled with the ghost of a thought, Tonya engaged with the logistics of a physical one. Her research phase was complete. The method had been chosen. Now came the acquisition of tools. On a clean sheet of paper, she made a list, her handwriting as precise and unadorned as a chemical formula. *Nitrogen Cylinder, CGA-580 Regulator, Low-Flow Meter, Silicone Tubing, Weather-strip Sealant.* It was the inventory of an engineer or a lab technician, not an artist. She spent an hour online, comparing specifications for gas regulators, ensuring the flow meter could be calibrated to a rate so slow it would be imperceptible. She was designing a system not to create something, but to create a perfect and gentle nothing. Her movements were calm, her focus absolute. She was building the chamber for her final, most meaningful act of curation.\n\nThe internal anomaly became an unbearable distraction for Ben. He pushed back from the microscope, rubbing his tired eyes. He couldn't work like this. The phrase was a burr, a point of intellectual irritation that demanded to be resolved. Rationalizing it as a necessary step to clear his mind and regain his focus, he turned to his lab computer, the glow of the monitor illuminating his troubled face. He opened a web browser, his fingers hovering over the keyboard for a moment. It felt foolish, like chasing a ghost, but the scientific imperative to investigate the unexplained was stronger than his sense of absurdity. With a sigh of resignation, he typed the fourteen characters into the search bar, the words appearing stark and alien on the screen: *SymmetryForJ*. He pressed enter.\n\nFor a moment, there was nothing but a list of obscure academic articles on bilateral symmetry and a handful of forum posts using the letter 'J'. Then, at the top of the image results, a single, compelling thumbnail. A macro photograph of an ant, its body a glossy obsidian black, set against a background of pure white. Curious, Ben clicked it. He found himself on a photostream, a sleek, minimalist gallery. The username was the phrase that haunted him. He scrolled down. There were dozens of images, all macro shots of insects, primarily ants. The technical skill was undeniable. The lighting was dramatic, the focus impossibly sharp. A fellow entomology enthusiast, he thought at first, or perhaps a student from the art department. But as he looked closer, the initial admiration curdled into a deep and profound unease.\n\nTales watched over Ben\u2019s shoulder, a phantom of pure, focused anxiety. He saw the page load, saw the gallery of Tonya\u2019s macabre work fill the screen. He watched Ben\u2019s expression shift, the clinical curiosity of a scientist morphing into the confused frown of a puzzle-solver, and then, finally, hardening into a mask of dawning horror. Ben clicked on 'Red Word', the image of the *Formica rufa* soldier. He zoomed in, his training allowing him to see what a casual observer would miss. The posture was not natural. It was not the rigor of death; it was the deliberate pose of an offering. The mandibles were parted just so, a gesture of shocking, artificial intimacy. He scrolled to another, an earlier, clumsier kill with a barely visible fracture in the thorax. He scrolled back to the newest ones, noting the flawless carapaces. He was seeing a progression. A refinement of technique. And then his eyes fell on the name of the photostream, the name that had been a meaningless string of characters a moment before, and it all coalesced with sickening clarity. Symmetry. For. J. For J. Alistair Finch. This wasn't a photography project. This was a shrine. This was a graveyard.\n\nIn her apartment, the final piece of the apparatus was secured. After a brief, professional-sounding phone call to a local welding supply depot, a delivery was scheduled for the following afternoon. A small, high-pressure cylinder of pure nitrogen, the kind used for inerting wine barrels or purging lab equipment, would be left at her doorstep. Tonya felt no thrill, no dark excitement. She felt only a quiet, profound sense of rightness, the calm of a surgeon whose operating theater was finally prepared. She stood before the glass terrarium, her gaze meeting the unblinking, composite eyes of the mantis. \"Soon,\" she whispered to it, her voice a soft tide in the still air. \"Soon, you will be perfect.\"The initial shock was a physical blow, forcing Ben back in his chair as if he\u2019d touched a live wire. The sterile, ordered world of the lab, a place of reason and measurable reality, seemed to tilt on its axis. He stared at the screen, at the gallery of tiny, perfect deaths, and felt a nausea that had nothing to do with biology. It was the sight of a beautiful, precise methodology\u2014his methodology, the discipline he had dedicated his life to\u2014twisted into an object of morbid worship. The meticulous lighting, the flawless focus, the reverent composition; it was all the language of science, but it was spelling out a word of profound and terrifying madness. This was a disease expressing itself through art.\n\nHe forced himself to breathe, to push past the horror and think like the scientist he was. Data. He needed more data. He scrolled back through the gallery, his eye no longer that of a stunned layman but of a forensic analyst. He ignored the newer, more perfect specimens and sought the older ones, the mistakes. A crushed antenna here, a slightly smudged background there. He was looking at a learning curve, the refinement of a dark craft. Then he returned to the most recent photograph, \u2018Red Word.\u2019 He zoomed in on the background, the stage for the tiny corpse. The chaotic, swirling grain of the wood. It was oak burl. A cold dread, sharp and specific, pricked at the base of his skull. He remembered Dr. Finch returning from a weekend market, triumphantly holding a round cheese board made of the exact same wood. \u2018The most beautiful patterns come from the most damaged trees, Ben,\u2019 he\u2019d said, his voice full of that infectious wonder. \u2018It\u2019s a map of a storm.\u2019 This artist hadn't just admired J. They had been in his home. They had handled his things.\n\nThe next afternoon, a plain white van with no company logo pulled up to the curb outside Tonya\u2019s apartment building. The driver, a man in a simple work uniform, wheeled a tall, grey cylinder of compressed gas on a dolly up to her door. It was heavy, and the dolly\u2019s wheels bumped noisily up the single step. The transaction was brief and impersonal. A signature on a digital screen, a curt nod. Then the driver was gone, leaving the object standing on her doorstep like a solemn, metallic sentinel. Tonya opened the door and regarded it not as a tank of gas, but as an instrument of peace. She maneuvered it inside with a surprising strength born of pure focus, its weight a grounding, reassuring presence. She rolled it into the spare bedroom, the sanctuary, and placed it in the corner. It was a monolith of potential stillness, the final, crucial component for the apparatus of her love\u2019s most perfect expression. The room was now complete.\n\nIn the lab, the name haunted him: T. Vance. Tonya Vance. The memory was hazy at first, a face at the periphery of his time in the department. She hadn't been a fellow graduate student, but a lab assistant, hired by Finch to help reorganize the university\u2019s massive, chaotic teaching collection. She was quiet, almost unnervingly so, and possessed a preternatural patience. Ben recalled seeing her hunched over a tray of dusty, hundred-year-old scarab beetles, her hands moving with the inhuman steadiness of a machine as she repaired their fragile legs with microscopic dabs of adhesive. She hadn't just done the work; she had revered it. And her devotion to Dr. Finch had been absolute, a silent, intense admiration that sometimes made the other students uncomfortable. She had left the position abruptly about a year ago, not long after Finch\u2019s accident. No one had heard from her since.\n\nTales watched, a silent tempest of frustration and hope, as Ben pieced it all together. The young man was staring at the memorial page, at the bland, professional comment from T. Vance, but his mind was elsewhere, connecting the quiet lab assistant to the burl wood, to the obsession with curation, to the terrible, secret meaning of symmetry. The ghost of J. Alistair Finch had unknowingly left behind two apprentices. One who studied his work, and one who studied his soul. Tales poured what was left of his energy into a final, desperate push, not a word this time, but a feeling: *Urgency*. A sense of a clock ticking down, of a ceremony about to begin.\n\nThe final connection snapped into place with the force of a physical impact. Ben shot to his feet, knocking his chair over with a loud clatter that echoed in the silent lab. Tonya Vance. The quiet girl who had loved the collection, who had worshipped the curator. The one person who might have twisted Finch\u2019s casual, philosophical musings on asymmetry into a sacred, terrible mission. This wasn\u2019t a mystery anymore; it was a countdown. He had no evidence that would make sense to anyone else, nothing but a series of cryptic photographs and a chain of inferences that sounded like madness. But he knew, with a certainty that chilled him to the bone, that somewhere in the city, Tonya Vance was preparing her next exhibit. And he was terrifyingly sure that this time, the specimen wouldn't be an ant. He didn't have a plan. He didn't have proof. All he had was a name, an address he could probably find in an old university directory, and the horrifying image of a dead mantis in his mind. He grabbed his keys and ran, a man of science surrendering to a desperate, primal instinct to intervene, to stop the art before it was finished.### Chapter 6\n\nThe clatter of the falling chair was a gunshot in the tomb-like silence of the lab. It was a sound of chaos, of a system breaking, and it propelled Ben Carter out of the room and into the hallway, his lab coat flapping behind him like the useless wings of a flightless bird. He was no longer a scientist; he was an antibody rushing toward an infection. Tales, dragged along in the turbulent wake of his host\u2019s panic, felt the abrupt shift. The quiet, contemplative grief he had been anchored to was gone, replaced by a roaring, adrenalized fear that was so powerful it felt like a physical force, threatening to shred his own tenuous hold on consciousness. He was a passenger in a runaway car, and the man at the wheel was driving blind.\n\nBen\u2019s destination was not the street, not yet. He skidded to a halt outside the departmental administrative office, a small, cluttered room presided over by a woman whose tenure predated most of the professors. He burst through the door, his wild-eyed appearance earning him a startled look over a pair of reading glasses. He didn\u2019t have time for pleasantries. He needed the old records, the archives of non-faculty employees from before the university had fully digitized its systems. It was a desperate, illogical lurch into the past, fueled by the certainty that Tonya Vance would be a ghost in the current digital machine. He was looking for a paper trail, an old address from an initial hiring form, anything.\n\nWhile Ben frantically explained his need to a skeptical administrator, Tonya was engaged in a silent, methodical ballet of engineering. She had rolled the cool, grey nitrogen cylinder into position beside the glass cube that served as her altar. Her gloved fingers, moving with the unthinking grace of a bomb disposal expert, threaded the brass regulator onto the cylinder\u2019s valve. She tightened it with a wrench, not with brute force, but with a precise application of torque, feeling for the exact point where the metal sealed. There was a brief, sharp hiss as the high-pressure system was charged, a sound she registered with a deep and abiding satisfaction. It was the sound of potential being brought to bear. She attached the clear silicone tubing to the regulator\u2019s outflow, its other end ready. Her movements were fluid, unhurried, each action a prayer.\n\nTales felt a splitting of his perception, a new and agonizing development in his condition. Tethered to Ben in the brightly lit, bureaucratic office, he could feel the young man\u2019s frantic impatience, the maddeningly slow pace of the administrator searching through dusty file cabinets. But his focus, his dread, his entire being was with Tonya. He could see her in his mind\u2019s eye as clearly as if he were standing in the room, watching her connect the apparatus of a perfect, silent death. He was in two places at once, a ghost stretched across the city, his consciousness a bridge between the frantic effort to save a life and the serene, unstoppable process of taking one. The strain was immense. He felt as if he were being torn in two.\n\nAn hour, an eternity, passed before the administrator surfaced from the archives with a single, yellowing sheet of paper. A personnel file from three years ago. And on it, an address. A non-descript apartment building on the north side of the river. Ben snatched the paper with a mumbled thanks that was lost as he was already turning, already running back down the hall. The drive across town was a blur of near-misses and blaring horns. Ben\u2019s knuckles were white on the steering wheel, his jaw clenched. He was a man of quiet labs and patient observation, and the violence of his own haste was a foreign country. Tales, trapped in the passenger seat, could do nothing but watch the city flash past, his own impotence a screaming void. He couldn\u2019t tell Ben that the light was about to change, couldn't warn him about the car pulling out of a blind alley. He was a navigator with no voice, a prophet with no tongue, watching the world through the eyes of a man racing toward a tragedy he had helped to set in motion.\n\nTonya sealed the terrarium. She had applied a thin, even bead of clear silicone sealant around the lid, making the glass cube airtight. Inside, the world was now a closed system. The moss, the twigs, the soil, and the single, magnificent occupant were isolated, a pocket universe ready for its final transformation. Alistair, the mantis, stood poised on its favorite branch, its head cocked, watching her with an intelligence that felt ancient and profound. Tonya placed her hand on the glass, her palm flat against the cool surface, a gesture of farewell and consummation. She felt no sadness, no remorse. She felt only the solemn, cleansing peace of a purpose about to be fulfilled. She turned to the nitrogen cylinder. Her hand rested on the small, green knob of the regulator. It was time. With a slow, steady motion, she began to turn it. There was no sound, no rush of air. The low-flow meter, calibrated with painstaking care, barely registered the movement. A gentle, invisible, and utterly final tide had begun to wash into the tiny world, a silent, nitrogenous sea that would slowly, peacefully, displace the air, carrying her beloved Alistair away on its current.\n\nThe apartment building was a shabby, three-story brick box, anonymous and weary. Ben found the address, number 2B, and took the stairs two at a time, his footsteps echoing in the narrow, linoleum-floored stairwell. He found the door, a slab of cheap wood painted an indeterminate shade of beige, a small brass \u20182B\u2019 tacked to its center. He stopped, his chest heaving, his mind a sudden, paralyzing blank. What now? He pressed his ear to the wood, expecting to hear\u2026 something. Music. A television. Movement. He heard nothing. The silence from the other side was absolute, a dead, sound-absorbing stillness that was more terrifying than any scream. He was a scientist, a man of evidence and protocol, and he had nothing. He had a theory, a terrifying, insane theory built on a username and a piece of wood. He raised his hand, his knuckles hovering an inch from the door. He could knock. He could call the police and try to explain the unexplainable. Or he could break it down. And in the profound, terrible silence from within, DI Tales, screaming his voiceless plea, knew that every second he hesitated, the tide of pure nitrogen was rising.The silence was the answer. It was not an empty silence; it was a curated one, as deliberate and precise as one of her photographs. It was the sound of a vacuum being created, the sound of air being meticulously removed. In that profound, unnatural stillness, Ben Carter\u2019s scientific skepticism was burned away, leaving only the raw, animal instinct to intervene. Protocol was a luxury for a world that made sense. This world did not. He threw his shoulder against the door. The impact was a shock of brute force, a language his body had forgotten how to speak. Wood splintered, a sound of tearing violence in the dead quiet of the hallway. The frame groaned in protest. He recoiled, his shoulder screaming, and threw himself against it again. This time, the lock gave way with a sickening crack, and the door flew inward, slamming against the wall.\n\nHe stumbled into the apartment, his breath coming in ragged, painful gasps. The space was shockingly neat, almost sterile. A single sofa, a small, empty dining table. There were no pictures on the walls, no clutter on the surfaces. It was a holding area, a place of transit, not a home. The air was cool and still. A single shaft of light emanated from an open doorway at the end of a short hall, a silent invitation into the heart of the anomaly. He followed it, his footsteps loud and clumsy on the clean floor, a barbarian crashing a tea ceremony. He was acutely aware of his own frantic, messy presence, a contaminant in this hermetically sealed environment.\n\nHe reached the doorway and froze. The room was a laboratory, a studio, a temple. In the center, on a simple black stand, sat the glass terrarium, glowing under the unforgiving glare of an articulated lamp. Beside it, like a piece of arcane medical equipment, stood the grey nitrogen cylinder, its regulator and tubing a network of veins feeding the glass box. On the wall were the drawings, anatomical studies of the mantis, rendered with the obsessive precision of a renaissance master. And standing before it all was Tonya. She turned, not with the start of a surprised victim, but with the slow, deliberate grace of a high priestess whose prayers had been interrupted. Her face, serene and immobile, showed no fear, only a profound, glacial annoyance. She was not a killer caught in the act; she was an artist whose masterpiece had just been smudged by a clumsy hand.\n\n\"Ben,\" she said, and her voice was as calm and cool as the air in the room. There was no inflection, no surprise. It was a simple statement of fact, the identification of a variable that had just entered her controlled experiment. Ben, panting, wild-eyed, could only gesture, his hand trembling as he pointed a finger at the terrarium, at the cylinder. The words came out in a strangled gasp, devoid of the coherence he valued above all else. \"Tonya\u2026 what are you doing? The gas\u2026 what is this?\" He was pointing at the evidence, but he was prosecuting the wrong crime. He was afraid of what she might do to a person, blind to the quiet atrocity happening right in front of him.\n\n\"I'm providing a stillness,\" Tonya replied, her gaze shifting from his frantic face back to the glass cube with a look of deep, maternal concern. \"Dr. Finch\u2026 he felt his life was unbalanced. Asymmetrical. This\u2026 this is a correction. A perfect, symmetrical end. No struggle, no pain. Just a gentle fading. It's a gift.\" She spoke of death as if it were a state of aesthetic grace, the final, perfect pose. The gulf between her reality and his was an uncrossable chasm, and they stood on opposite sides, shouting at each other in languages the other could not comprehend.\n\nTales, who had been violently flung into the room with Ben, felt a dizzying, nauseating relief mixed with absolute terror. He was here. He was at the site of the procedure. He could see everything. He saw the almost imperceptible flutter of the needle on the flow meter. He saw the mantis inside the glass, its alien head swiveling, but its movements were slower now, more sluggish, its usual sharp, predatory angles softened by a creeping lethargy. The silent tide was already halfway up the shore. Tonya was explaining her theology of death, and Ben was trying to argue with a ghost story, and all the while, the beautiful, terrible creature was quietly, peacefully, drowning in the air itself. The art was almost finished.The words struck Ben with the force of a physical blow, but it was Tales who understood their full, devastating import. Through the maelstrom of Ben\u2019s panic, he could see the scene with the cold, diagnostic clarity of a physician watching a slow-acting poison take hold. The victim was not some future, hypothetical human, but the magnificent, dying creature in the glass box. The mantis\u2019s movements, once sharp and deliberate, were now thick and syrupy, its head drooping as if the delicate stalk of its neck could no longer support the weight. The air inside the terrarium, once a life-sustaining medium, was becoming a tomb, and Tonya was its serene, loving architect. Tales screamed, a silent, spectral howl of pure frustration, trying to force Ben to see what was right in front of him, to look past the abstract horror of Tonya\u2019s philosophy and see the concrete, immediate fact of a life being gently, methodically, extinguished.\n\nBen barely heard her explanation. The name \u2018Dr. Finch\u2019 on her lips was a profanity. He looked at her placid, beatific expression and saw not madness, but a monstrous act of intellectual theft. She had taken J\u2019s beautiful, complex ideas about the flaws that create character, the asymmetry that defines life, and twisted them into this grotesque, nihilistic pursuit of a perfect, sterile end. She wasn't honoring him; she was erasing him, replacing his nuanced, vibrant philosophy with a child's simplistic notion of balance. A hot, protective anger, an emotion he had not felt since the day he\u2019d heard of the accident, surged through him, eclipsing his fear. This woman was not just a threat; she was a heretic, and he was the last true keeper of the faith.\n\n\"You're wrong,\" he snarled, the words tearing from his throat, raw and full of a sudden, righteous fury. \"He loved the imperfection. The crookedness. That's what you don't understand!\" But he knew, even as he said it, that he was trying to reason with a tidal wave. Words were useless. Action was the only language left. He lunged, not at her, but past her, his target the apparatus itself. His hand, accustomed to the delicate work of forceps and microscope dials, reached for the brass regulator, a clumsy, desperate grab for the control valve of this terrible machine. Tonya moved to intercept him, her stillness exploding into a surprising, wiry strength. She did not try to hurt him. Her body became a shield, a living barrier between his chaotic intervention and the sanctity of her creation.\n\nHer hands clamped onto his arm, her grip shockingly firm. \"Don't,\" she hissed, her serenity finally cracking to reveal the granite core of her conviction. \"You're ruining it. It has to be perfect.\" As they struggled, their bodies locked in a clumsy, desperate embrace, Tales threw the last vestiges of his will into Ben's reaching hand. He focused on the small, green knob of the valve, pouring his disembodied energy, his memory of life, his rage at this senseless death, into a single, kinetic impulse. *Turn!* he screamed into the psychic void. Ben, driven by his own adrenaline, felt a surge of strength, an inexplicable certainty in his movement. His fingers found purchase on the knob, the cold, knurled metal a point of absolute reality in the chaos.\n\nWith a final, desperate heave, Ben twisted his body, using his weight to wrench free from her grasp. He slammed his hand against the valve, turning it violently, far past the point of closure. The hiss of the gas ceased. He didn't stop. He ripped the silicone tube from its fitting, the plastic tearing away with a soft pop. The silence that followed was absolute, a heavy, suffocating blanket. In the struggle, the terrarium had been jostled, its contents disturbed. Tonya stared at the disconnected tube in Ben's hand, at the violated sanctity of her altar, and a look of profound, hollow devastation washed over her face. Her perfect moment, her sacred art, was corrupted. Broken. Asymmetrical.\n\nBen stood panting, his whole body trembling, the torn tube dangling from his fingers like a dead snake. He had won, but the victory tasted like ash. He had stopped the procedure, but he had shattered the priestess. He lowered his gaze to the glass cube. Tonya, her face a mask of utter desolation, looked with him. Inside, on the disturbed soil, Alistair lay on its side. For a long, terrible moment, it was still. Then, one of its delicate, thread-like antennae twitched, a faint, almost imperceptible tremor. A sign of life. A sign of imperfection. The two of them, the heretic and the true believer, stood frozen in the wreckage of their collision, their shared gaze fixed on the tiny, terrible miracle of a life that had refused, against all odds, to become perfect.### Chapter 7\n\nThe twitch was a seismic event in a world that had shrunk to the size of a glass box. It was a flicker of stubborn, asymmetrical life, a tiny, defiant pulse in a room that had been consecrated for a perfect and final stillness. For Ben, it was a gasp of air after being held underwater, a wave of relief so profound it left him weak-kneed and dizzy. For Tonya, it was a crack running through a flawless diamond, a stain on a sacred text. It was the mark of her failure. A low sound escaped her, a guttural syllable of pure, animal grief that had nothing to do with anger and everything to do with loss. Her face, for the first time, lost its serene immobility and crumpled, her body seeming to fold in on itself. She sank to her knees on the floor, her gaze fixed on the imperfect, living creature, her hands limp at her sides. The high priestess had been deposed, her altar desecrated, her god denied its sacrifice.\n\nBen\u2019s righteous fury evaporated, replaced by a bewildering, vertiginous pity. The monster he had come to slay was now a kneeling, broken woman, weeping without tears for the death that had failed to occur. He took a half-step toward her, an instinctive gesture of comfort, before freezing, his hand outstretched in the empty air. What could he possibly say? His own reality, the one of data and logic and observable phenomena, had no vocabulary for this kind of sorrow. He was a biologist, and he had just witnessed a soul fracture. He looked from her collapsed form to the broken door, to the cylinder of inert gas, to the trembling mantis, and felt the full, crushing weight of his intrusion. He had not simply averted a crisis; he had shattered a world.\n\nFrom his vantage point of pure observation, Tales felt the last of his spectral energy drain away, leaving a strange, hollow calm. He had done it. He had, through a chain of ghostly nudges and desperate, focused intentions, physically altered the course of events. He had saved a life, albeit a very small one. The relief was a clean, cool wave washing over his frayed consciousness. But as he watched Ben stand paralyzed and Tonya kneel in silent, abject misery, he understood that he had only changed the diagnosis, not cured the disease. He had stopped the fatal hemorrhage, but the patient was still on the table, her psyche a landscape of fresh, gaping wounds. He was no longer a detective; he was an accessory to a necessary act of emotional violence, and now, like Ben, he was a helpless witness to the aftermath.\n\n\u201cIt was almost\u2026 perfect,\u201d Tonya whispered to the floor, her voice a reedy thread of sound. \u201cIt was almost whole.\u201d She wasn\u2019t speaking to Ben; she was delivering a eulogy for a failed ritual. Ben finally found his voice, though it came out hoarse and uncertain. \u201cTonya\u2026 it\u2019s alive. That\u2019s what matters. It\u2019s alive.\u201d He spoke the words as a fundamental truth, a bedrock principle of his entire worldview. To him, they were a statement of victory and hope. Tonya slowly lifted her head, her eyes, dark and cavernous with a grief he couldn\u2019t begin to comprehend, fixed on his. \u201cNo,\u201d she said, her voice flat and dead. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand. Now it\u2019s just\u2026 damaged.\u201d In her world, the messy, twitching fact of survival was an uglier fate than the perfect, symmetrical stillness she had so meticulously prepared.\n\nThe chasm between them was absolute. They stood in the wreckage, two survivors of a catastrophe, speaking different languages, mourning different losses. Ben saw a life saved; she saw a prayer ruined. He saw a return to the beautiful, crooked imperfection that J. Alistair Finch had cherished; she saw a final, damning confirmation of the asymmetry he had lamented. The living mantis was not a symbol of hope. It was a monument to her failure to give the man she loved the one thing she believed he had wanted most: a final, corrected peace. The room was no longer a temple; it was just a broken laboratory, and they were just two people, lost in the quiet hum of a refrigerator in the other room, trapped with the terrible, unintended consequences of their convictions.The silence in the room stretched, thin and brittle. It was no longer a sacred silence, but the awkward, hollow quiet that follows a terrible argument. Ben stood, his breath still ragged, caught in the gravitational pull of Tonya\u2019s collapsed form. His scientific mind, trained to categorize and explain, struggled to file what he was seeing. This wasn't criminality; it was a kind of spiritual necrosis. She was not a monster; she was a system in catastrophic failure, a mind that had followed its own flawless, internal logic to a place far beyond the borders of shared reality. The quiet hum of the refrigerator from the other room, the distant wail of a passing siren\u2014the mundane sounds of the world began to seep back in, rendering the scene not just tragic, but absurd.\n\nHe took a slow, deliberate step forward, his boot scuffing softly on the floor. His first rational thought was to dismantle the stage, to turn off the lights and end the performance. He reached out and, with a decisive click, switched off the articulated lamp. The harsh, interrogating glare vanished, plunging the terrarium and Tonya\u2019s kneeling form into the soft, diffuse grey of the late afternoon. The room became less of an operating theater and more of a dimly lit tomb. It was a small act, but it was an attempt to change the context, to bring her back from the world of perfect, abstract symbols to the messy, poorly-lit reality of a second-floor apartment with a broken door.\n\nThe sudden twilight seemed to break Tonya\u2019s trance. She stirred, not looking at him, but at the darkened glass of the terrarium. \"You've trapped it,\" she said, her voice a monotone whisper, yet carrying a current of cold, accusatory venom. \"It was going to be free. Free of its body, of its hunger, of the struggle. It was going to be an idea. A perfect, final word. Now\u2026 it's just an insect again. A thing that eats and defecates and dies messily. You didn't save it. You condemned it to life.\" Her logic was a perfect, terrifying inversion of his own. She saw his act of salvation as one of profound cruelty, a sentence to the very imperfection she was trying to transcend on J\u2019s behalf.\n\nTales watched the exchange, a silent spectator at a dialogue of the deaf. He had seen the world in terms of diagnosis and treatment, but this was a pathology of the soul that resisted all medicine. He had successfully prevented a death, but in doing so, he had destroyed a religion. Tonya\u2019s grief was not a wound to be sutured; it was a carefully constructed architecture, and Ben had just sledgehammered its cornerstone. For the first time since his own death, Tales felt a new and more profound impotence. It was not the inability to touch or speak, but the inability to translate. He could see both of their worlds with perfect clarity, could understand the unassailable logic of each, and he knew with absolute certainty that there was no bridge that could ever connect them.\n\nJust then, a sharp, hesitant knock came at the broken door. \"Hello? Is everything alright in there? I heard a crash.\" A woman's voice, laced with nervous concern. The outside world, with its simple rules and nosy neighbors, had arrived. Ben froze, a deer in the headlights. The entire, insane tableau\u2014the kneeling woman, the gas cylinder, the praying mantis in its glass prison\u2014flashed before his eyes. He was standing in a stranger\u2019s apartment with a door he had just broken down. The truth was impossible. He had to lie. He moved quickly, stepping out of the room and partially closing the bedroom door behind him, shielding the scene from view. He pulled the main apartment door as closed as its splintered frame would allow and spoke through the crack. \"It's fine! Sorry! I\u2026 I tripped, fell against the door. A bit clumsy. Everything's fine, thank you for checking.\" He held his breath, praying his voice sounded more convincing than it felt.\n\nAfter a skeptical pause, the neighbor\u2019s footsteps retreated down the hall. The immediate threat was gone, but its presence had changed the dynamic completely. Ben was no longer just an intervener; he was a co-conspirator, a guardian of a terrible secret. He was now responsible for her, tethered to her by the lie he had just told. He turned back toward the dim bedroom, the silence within now heavier than before. He pushed the door open to see Tonya in the same position, a statue of grief in the gloom. His gaze fell upon the terrarium. Inside, the mantis, with a slow, Herculean effort that seemed to take an eternity, had managed to get its legs back under it. It stood unsteadily, its body swaying, a living, breathing monument to the ugly, difficult, and beautiful business of survival. The art was ruined, but the subject, against its artist\u2019s will, was beginning to live again.The lie hung in the air between them, a flimsy, makeshift patch over a gaping hole. Ben turned back from the door, his heart hammering a frantic, panicked rhythm against his ribs. The brief, mundane interaction with the outside world had irrevocably changed the nature of the crisis. He was no longer a rescuer; he was a hostage, trapped not by Tonya, but by the sheer, unexplainable reality of the situation. He couldn't call the police. He couldn't walk away. He was tethered to this quiet, grieving woman and the terrible, sacred secret contained in her spare bedroom. He felt the phantom chill of implication, the cold understanding that by breaking down her door, he had crossed a threshold and entered her story, and he could not leave until it was finished.\n\nHe stepped fully back into the dim room, the door clicking softly shut behind him. Tonya hadn\u2019t moved. She was still a cairn of sorrow on the floor, her focus entirely on the glass box. Ben\u2019s gaze followed hers. The mantis, Alistair, was slowly, painstakingly, righting itself. Each movement was a tiny, monumental effort, a testament to the stubborn, unthinking imperative of living tissue. It was ugly and clumsy and miraculous. It was everything Tonya\u2019s art was designed to erase. He understood, then, that leaving the mantis here would be an act of ongoing torture for her, a living, breathing symbol of her profound failure. He had to dismantle the altar. He had to remove the object of worship.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m taking it, Tonya,\u201d he said, his voice quiet but firm, stripped of its earlier panic. It was the tone he used in the lab when explaining a difficult but necessary procedure. He moved toward the stand, his hands reaching for the terrarium. A flicker of movement from the floor. Tonya rose, not with the explosive energy of before, but with a weary, boneless fluidity. She placed herself between him and the glass box, not as a guard, but as a final, futile supplicant. \u201cYou can\u2019t,\u201d she said, her voice hollow. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 mine. The failure is mine. I have to see it.\u201d She needed to watch it live, to study her mistake, to absorb the full measure of its imperfection. To Ben, it sounded like a vow of self-flagellation.\n\nIt was in that moment of impossible stalemate that Tales felt the change. He was still anchored to Ben, but the intense, singular focus of the chase and the confrontation had faded, leaving behind the shared, oppressive atmosphere of the room. He felt the quiet thrum of two exhausted heartbeats, the faint, chemical scent of the silicone sealant, the cool draft from the broken door. And he felt something else. A subtle loosening. The tether that had bound him so tightly to Ben\u2019s consciousness, the one he had clung to for miles, was becoming frayed. His own independent sense of self, which had been subsumed by the rush of events, was beginning to reassert itself. He was no longer just a passenger. He was a separate entity again, a silent third party in a room of two, and the strain of maintaining his connection across the city was beginning to tell. The safe, dead quiet of the South Lincoln Street library began to hum at the very edge of his perception, a distant, gravitational pull calling him home.\n\nHe fought against it, a silent, desperate struggle to hold his place. He had to see this through. He had to know what would happen next. He focused on Ben, on the warmth of his living body, the frantic but vital energy of his mind. But the pull was inexorable, a slow, cosmic tide. The edges of the room began to blur, the solid forms of Ben and Tonya shimmering as if seen through heat haze. Their voices grew distant, the sharp edges of their conflict softening into a remote murmur. He was losing his grip, his consciousness being stretched thin across an impossible distance. He was a ghost being exorcised by sheer psychic exhaustion. The last thing he saw before the world dissolved into a rush of grey static was Ben Carter, his face a mask of resolute pity, gently taking Tonya Vance by the arm, and the living, imperfect mantis in its glass prison, twitching its antennae as if testing the quality of the air, tasting the bitter, complicated reality of its own survival.Ben\u2019s touch was gentle, the careful hold of a man accustomed to handling fragile things. Tonya did not pull away. The fight had gone out of her, leaving a hollowed-out shell. She allowed him to guide her, her feet shuffling on the floor as he led her from the dim sanctuary of the spare bedroom, away from the desecrated altar and the failed miracle. He sat her down on the spartan sofa in the living room, a piece of furniture that had clearly seen little use. It was a space designed for waiting, and it seemed that its purpose had finally arrived. She sat stiffly, her hands in her lap, her gaze fixed on the empty space in front of her, seeing not the clean wall but the ghost of the perfect, still image she had almost captured.\n\nHe knelt in front of her, a gesture of supplication he did not understand himself. \u201cTonya,\u201d he began, his voice low and scraped raw, \u201cwe need to\u2026 I need to help you.\u201d He was speaking from a script of basic human decency, but the words felt like pebbles thrown against a fortress wall. She blinked slowly, her focus shifting from an inner landscape to his earnest, troubled face. \u201cHelp me?\u201d she repeated, the question holding no curiosity, only a faint, clinical detachment. \u201cYou broke it. The symmetry. It can\u2019t be fixed now. All the lines are crooked.\u201d She looked around the neat, empty room as if she could see the bent and broken lines of a great geometric proof that had been irreparably corrupted. Her grief was not for a life, but for the loss of a perfect, abstract form.\n\nThe moment the connection snapped, Tales was flung backwards through a non-space of roaring, colorless static. It was not a gentle fading but a violent recoil, the snapping of a psychic tether stretched far beyond its breaking point. He slammed back into the silent, familiar darkness of his corner in the Spokane library on South Lincoln Street. The sensory whiplash was staggering. The emotional hurricane of Tonya\u2019s apartment\u2014the fear, the rage, the profound sorrow\u2014was instantly replaced by an absolute, profound stillness. Moonlight, filtered through the tall, arched windows, laid pale rectangles on the dusty floor. The only sound was a faint, high-frequency hum from an emergency exit sign. The air tasted of old paper and settled dust. He was home. He was safe. And he had never felt more agonizingly alone.\n\nHe was no longer the same entity that had departed this place. Before, he had been a hypothesis, a draft of memory. Now, he was a cause, a catalyst. He had reached across the veil and pushed, and the world had pushed back. The effort had left him feeling thin and abraded, a ghost with phantom road rash. He had succeeded in his primary, desperate goal, but the victory was a complex, bitter thing. He had not restored order; he had simply introduced a new, more chaotic variable into the equation. He had saved a mantis, but he had shattered a mind, and he was now trapped miles away, a doctor who had performed a radical and unsanctioned surgery and was now barred from the recovery room, left to wonder if the patient would survive the cure.\n\nBen knew he couldn't leave her like this, a statue of grief in an empty room. More than that, he knew he couldn\u2019t leave the source of the obsession behind. Leaving the mantis would be like leaving a loaded gun on the table. He stood up, his resolve hardening. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back,\u201d he said, the words feeling inadequate and absurd. He walked back into the spare bedroom, the scene of the crime. The nitrogen cylinder stood silent and impotent. The drawings on the wall seemed to mock him with their obsessive beauty. He walked to the stand and looked down into the glass cube. The mantis, Alistair, had crawled onto a twig. It was cleaning one of its antennae with a slow, deliberate motion, a small act of personal maintenance in the ruins of a grand theological drama. It was the most heartbreakingly normal thing Ben had ever seen.\n\nHe braced himself and carefully, reverently, lifted the terrarium. The box was heavy, solid, a self-contained world of moss, soil, and terrible significance. As he turned to leave, he felt Tonya\u2019s presence in the doorway. She did not move to stop him. She simply watched, her face a pale, emotionless mask in the gloom. Her eyes were fixed on the glass box in his hands, not with anger, but with a look of profound and final separation, the look of a mother watching a child being taken away forever. She was letting him take her failure, her shame, her damaged, living art. It was a surrender.\n\nCarrying the terrarium like a holy relic, Ben backed out of the room. He navigated the short hallway and moved past the sofa where Tonya still sat, unmoving. He reached the splintered doorway, the jagged wound he had torn in her life. He paused on the threshold, his back to her. He wanted to say something\u2014'I'm sorry,' 'I'll get you help,' 'It will be alright'\u2014but he knew that any words from his world would be meaningless noise in hers. Without turning back, he stepped out into the hallway, pulling the broken door as closed as it would go. The latch didn't catch, leaving a dark, gaping crack. He stood for a moment in the dim, linoleum-floored corridor, holding a glass box containing a single, traumatized praying mantis, the silence of the apartment behind him now feeling like the silence of a tomb. He had won the battle, but he was terrifyingly aware that he had just abandoned the war's most tragic casualty on the field.### Chapter 8\n\nThe drive back to the university was a surreal, disjointed dream. Ben Carter drove ten miles under the speed limit, his hands trembling so violently he had to grip the steering wheel like a man holding onto the edge of a cliff. On the passenger seat beside him, the glass terrarium slid slightly with every turn, a fragile, self-contained world of trauma. Inside, the mantis, Alistair, clung to a branch, a silent, green passenger on a journey it could never comprehend. The city lights smeared past the windows, bright and meaningless. Ben felt a profound sense of dislocation, as if he had stepped out of the normal flow of time and was now moving through a parallel, silent version of his own life. The questions hammered at him, a relentless internal barrage. What had he just done? What was he supposed to do now? He had acted on pure, primal instinct, a biological imperative to prevent a death, and in doing so, had made himself the custodian of an impossible situation. He was carrying a piece of evidence he could never submit, from a crime that no one would ever understand.\n\nBack in the apartment, the silence settled like a layer of fine, suffocating dust. For a long time, Tonya did not move from the sofa. The broken door yawned into the dim hallway, a jagged mouth breathing the common air of the building into her sanctum. It was a violation. The sounds of the building\u2014a distant television, the rumble of the elevator, the faint footsteps of the neighbor who had knocked\u2014were all contaminants. Her world, once a sealed chamber of purpose and ritual, had been breached and exposed. Slowly, stiffly, she rose. Her first destination was the door. She looked at the splintered jamb, the mangled lock plate. With careful, deliberate fingers, she tried to fit the broken pieces of wood back together, an absurd, hopeless puzzle. It would not close. It would not seal. The world was in, and it could not be forced out.\n\nThis final, physical proof of her world\u2019s corruption seemed to trigger a new protocol. A quiet, methodical purpose returned to her movements, but it was not the serene energy of the artist. It was the flat, automatic behavior of a system trying to reset itself after a catastrophic error. She went to the kitchen and returned with a bucket of warm, soapy water and a sponge. Kneeling on the floor, she began to scrub the spot where Ben had stood, her strokes firm and even, erasing the prints of his shoes, the memory of his frantic, disruptive presence. She was not cleaning a floor; she was performing an exorcism, attempting to purify the space through a ritual of mundane labor. Her gaze was blank, her face impassive. The great, soaring architecture of her grief had collapsed, and she was now just a custodian, tidying the ruins.\n\nTales materialized in the familiar shadows of the library\u2019s history section, the sudden, violent transition leaving him feeling disoriented and thin. The quiet here was a physical presence, a weight of accumulated silence that was both a comfort and a torment. He was safe, but he was blind. He drifted from his corner, a restless current of anxiety in the still air, his perception straining, reaching back across the city toward the apartment on the north side of the river. But there was nothing. The connection was severed completely. The signal was lost. He was a doctor who had been thrown out of the ICU, left to stare at the blank walls of his office and wonder if the patient was stabilizing or crashing. The worry for Tonya was a sharp, focused ache. He understood her pathology better than Ben ever could. He knew that for a mind like hers, a mind that had built an entire reality around a single, driving purpose, the sudden removal of that purpose was not a release. It was an amputation. And he feared, with a cold, clear dread, what might rush in to fill the void.\n\nThe university was a ghost town, the labs and lecture halls dark and empty. Ben used his student keycard to let himself into the entomology building, the click of the electronic lock echoing loudly in the deserted corridor. He carried the terrarium down the hall to his own small lab, a space usually filled with the comforting, orderly clutter of his research. Tonight, it felt like an alien landscape. He placed the glass box in the center of a clean, stainless-steel workbench, the single overhead light turning it into a stark, theatrical display. He stood for a long moment, just looking at it. Alistair, seemingly recovered from its ordeal, was grooming its face with its forelegs, a gesture of unnerving, cat-like normalcy. Ben felt a sudden, absurd, and overwhelming wave of affection for the creature. It was a survivor. They were both survivors of a strange, private war. He found a small beaker, filled it with filtered water, and gently poured a small amount onto the moss in the corner of the terrarium, a clumsy but heartfelt offering. The mantis ignored it completely, and Ben felt a fresh pang of foolishness and failure. He looked from the mantis to the lab around him, a place of reason and light, and then thought of Tonya, alone in her dark apartment with her broken door, and knew that this long, terrible night was only just beginning.The methodical rhythm of the sponge against the floor was a form of meditation, a mantra of erasure. When the spot was clean, and the faint, soapy scent had replaced the smell of Ben Carter\u2019s frantic intrusion, Tonya rose. Her work in the living room was done. She carried the bucket into the spare bedroom, the scene of her failure, and began the second phase of the decommissioning. The nitrogen cylinder was her first target. She unscrewed the regulator with the same dispassionate precision she had used to attach it, the faint hiss of escaping gas a final, dying breath. She coiled the silicone tubing into a perfect circle, securing it with a wire twist-tie she retrieved from a kitchen drawer. The tools, her beautiful, delicate instruments of micro-forceps and custom-made levers, were wiped clean of any lingering spiritual residue and laid back in their velvet-lined case. The sound of the lid clicking shut was a note of profound finality.\n\nLastly, she turned to the drawings on the wall. They were a gallery of her devotion, a testament to the hours she had spent in silent communion with her subject. She did not tear them down. With the careful touch of a museum archivist, she removed the pins from each corner, stacking the heavy sheets of paper one on top of the other, ensuring the edges were perfectly aligned. The graphite renderings of Alistair\u2019s spiked limbs and alien eyes stared up at her, not as art, but as data from a failed experiment. She slid the neat stack into a large portfolio, zipped it closed, and pushed it under the bed. In the space of an hour, the room was stripped bare. The temple was deconsecrated, its relics hidden away. The spare bedroom was once again just a spare bedroom, a hollow, empty space waiting for a new purpose to inhabit it. Tonya stood in the center of the emptied room, feeling not relief, but a vast, clean, and terrifying emptiness. The architecture of her grief had been razed to the ground, and she was left standing alone in the vacant lot.\n\nIn his lab, the silence hummed with a different kind of energy. It was the low, electronic thrum of dormant equipment, the sound of potential waiting for a command. Ben sat staring at the terrarium, his mind a frantic scramble of competing obligations. He had a thesis to write, data to analyze, a future to build. But all of it felt trivial, thin, like a story written in a language he no longer spoke. His reality was now divided into two distinct epochs: before Tonya\u2019s apartment, and after. He pulled out his phone, its screen a bright, accusatory rectangle in the dim lab. He navigated to an old contact list, a file saved from a group project two years prior. He found her name: Tonya Vance. Beside it was a phone number. His thumb hovered over the \u2018call\u2019 icon, a small green button that felt as momentous and terrifying as a launch trigger. What would he say? \u2018Hi Tonya, it\u2019s Ben. Just wanted to make sure you\u2019re not inventing a new, even more esoteric way to process your grief?\u2019 The absurdity was paralyzing. But the image of her kneeling on the floor, her world collapsed into a point of absolute despair, was a hook he could not shake loose. He was a scientist, trained to observe and record. But he was also a human being, and he knew, with a certainty that transcended data, that leaving a wound that deep un-tended was a form of gross negligence.\n\nDr. Tales was a ghost in a ghost town. The library, once his safe harbor, now felt like a cage built of silence and shadows. He drifted aimlessly through the towering stacks of the theology section, the leather-bound titles\u2014*The Cloud of Unknowing*, *The Dark Night of the Soul*\u2014seeming to mock his own liminal, unholy state. He was a being of pure information, yet he was cut off from the only data that mattered. He replayed the last moments in the apartment endlessly, dissecting the dialogue, the body language, the shifting emotional currents. He saw Ben\u2019s well-intentioned but clumsy intervention and Tonya\u2019s retreat into a state of catatonic order. He had prevented the symptom from reaching its fatal conclusion, but the underlying disease, the deep, systemic pathology of her grief, was now festering in the dark, without witness. He tried, with a desperate, pathetic expenditure of will, to reach out, to cast a line of thought back to the north side of the city. He focused on the memory of Ben\u2019s panic, of Tonya\u2019s stillness, trying to use them as a psychic address. The effort produced nothing but a faint, internal shimmer, a flicker in his own formless state. He was a radio operator whose transmitter had burned out, left to listen to the static and imagine the frantic, unheard messages from the front.With a final, decisive movement, Ben closed the contact card on his phone, the screen going dark. The call would not be made. It was a coward\u2019s choice, and he knew it, but it was also an admission of his own profound inadequacy. He was a biologist, not a psychologist, not a priest. He had no words that could reach across the abyss of her unique and terrible grief. A phone call would be a clumsy intrusion, an offering of bland platitudes to a woman who had been communing with gods of her own creation. He could not fix her mind, but he could, perhaps, tend to the living thing he had torn from her orbit. His responsibility, for now, was to the mantis. It was a tangible problem, a biological system that required care, and in its simple, solvable needs, he saw a path through his own paralysis.\n\nHe moved with a renewed, if fragile, sense of purpose. Alistair needed a proper habitat, not this glass box that was half-altar, half-tomb. He went to a storeroom filled with the disused equipment of a dozen past experiments and found a larger, mesh-sided enclosure, the kind used for breeding studies. It was tall, allowing for climbing. He filled the bottom with a carefully layered substrate of coconut fiber and sphagnum moss to hold humidity, just as Finch had taught him. He selected a branching piece of driftwood from a supply closet, its shape complex and interesting, offering multiple perches. He worked for over an hour, his hands moving with the steady, familiar rhythm of his discipline, the methodical process of constructing a world calming the frantic storm in his mind. When it was done, he carefully coaxed the mantis from its glass prison onto the new branch. Alistair crawled slowly onto the driftwood, its antennae twitching, exploring the new topography of its expanded world. It was a small, inadequate act of restoration, but it was a start. Ben had no idea how to save Tonya, but he was determined, with a fierce and focused passion, to give this insect the best life a captive insect could possibly have.\n\nThe quiet in Tonya\u2019s apartment was no longer empty; it was pressurized. The vacuum left by the collapse of her great work was beginning to draw something new into its space. She sat at her small, clean desk, her laptop open before her. The screen was not filled with images of insects or research papers on euthanasia. It was a plain university webpage. She had spent the last hour not scrubbing floors or hiding evidence, but doing what she had always done when faced with a new subject: research. The specimen in question was no longer *Formica rufa* or *Hierodula membranacea*. It was *Ben Carter*. His name was the variable that had corrupted her data, the anomaly that had ruined her perfect symmetry. As a curator, she could not abide an uncatalogued specimen. She needed to understand its nature, its habits, its weaknesses.\n\nShe found his departmental profile easily. She saw his photograph, a candid shot from a field trip, his face earnest and smiling, his eyes lit with a guileless scientific curiosity. She read the abstract of his master\u2019s thesis, a dense, technical analysis of pollinator-plant coevolution. She scrolled through a gallery from a departmental awards ceremony and found him standing beside Dr. Finch, both of them beaming, a perfect image of mentor and devoted apprentice. She studied this image for a long time, her face impassive. Ben Carter was not a random intruder. He was part of J\u2019s world. He was another of J\u2019s imperfect, asymmetrical creations. Her gaze, once reserved for the delicate architecture of an insect\u2019s mouth, now traced the lines of Ben\u2019s face on the screen. He had inserted himself into her work, and in doing so, had become the work itself. Her project was not over. The subject had simply been upgraded.\n\nMiles away, in the deep and total silence of the closed library, DI Tales felt a change in the static. He could not see or hear, but he could feel the fundamental nature of the pathology shifting. It was a sensation he remembered from his living days, the moment a doctor realizes a patient\u2019s cancer has not been cured but has instead mutated into a new, more aggressive, and treatment-resistant form. The frantic, inward-facing grief of \u2018SymmetryForJ\u2019 had been a contained, though terrible, disease. This new silence, the silence emanating from Tonya\u2019s apartment, felt different. It was the coiled, patient silence of a predator that has identified its new prey. He did not know what she was doing, what new ritual she was planning, but he knew with the unshakeable certainty of a master diagnostician that the focus of her terrible, precise devotion had turned outward. He had been so worried about her finding a larger vessel for her grief. He had never considered that the vessel might be the very person who had tried to save her. He was a sentinel with no post, a watchman with no tower, and he knew, with a cold that seeped into the very core of his spectral being, that a new and more terrible storm was gathering in the dark.### Chapter 9\n\nThe next morning, Tonya rose with the sun. The frantic, scrubbing-clean energy of the previous night had settled into a quiet, cold resolve. The apartment, stripped of its sacred purpose, felt like a borrowed room in a stranger\u2019s house. She moved to the front door, the jagged splinters of the jamb a permanent, ugly scar on the clean lines of her world. She did not try to fix it again. Instead, she took a key from a small dish on the counter, walked outside into the cool morning air, and locked the broken door from the outside, an act that felt both absurd and necessary. She was sealing the tomb, leaving the ruins of her old religion behind. She was dressed in non-descript clothing\u2014grey jeans, a dark blue jacket, a simple baseball cap that shadowed her face. She was a field biologist preparing for an observation, and her goal was to blend into the habitat of her new subject, to become part of the background noise.\n\nThe university campus was a riot of life, a complex, teeming ecosystem that she had only ever seen from the sterile perspective of a lab assistant. Students flowed between buildings like a river of purpose, their laughter and conversation a constant, ambient hum. To Tonya, they were merely the environment, the weather patterns and foliage through which her target moved. She found a vantage point on a stone bench across the quad from the Hall of Sciences, the building that housed the entomology department. It offered a clear, unobstructed view of the main entrance. She sat, perfectly still, her hands resting in her lap, a patient predator settled in its blind. She was not waiting for an opportunity to strike; she was collecting baseline data, observing the creature in its natural habitat before she could ever hope to understand the forces that governed it.\n\nInside that same building, Ben Carter felt like a ghost haunting his own life. The familiar hum of the chromatography machines and the scent of ethanol and autoclaved soil, smells that had once meant comfort and purpose, now felt alien. He sat at his workbench, a petri dish from Palouse Falls under the lens of his microscope, but he wasn't seeing the intricate dance of nematodes and fungi. His focus kept snapping back to the night before, replaying the splintering wood, the hiss of the regulator, the look of utter devastation on Tonya\u2019s face. The secret he carried was a physical weight, isolating him from the easy camaraderie of the lab. A fellow grad student, Maya, stopped by his bench, chattering about a contaminated sample and a looming deadline, and Ben could only nod and offer vague, monosyllabic responses, his mind a million miles away in a dark apartment across the river. He was surrounded by his peers, but he had never felt more profoundly alone.\n\nHis only point of true focus, his only anchor in this new, distorted reality, was the mesh-sided enclosure that now sat on a cleared section of his workbench. Inside, Alistair moved with a slow, regal grace on its new driftwood perch. The mantis had become his secret charge, his penance, and his only confidante. Periodically, he would stop pretending to work and just watch it, his mind quieting as he observed its alien, deliberate movements. He had fed it a small, gut-loaded cricket that morning, watching with a detached biologist\u2019s fascination as the brutal, efficient predation unfolded. It was a small, perfect act of nature, a world of life and death contained in a box, and for a few minutes, it was the only thing in the universe that made any sense to him.\n\nDr. Tales was burning. The impotent rage and chilling fear had coalesced into a form of pure, focused energy. The library was a prison, and he rattled its bars with the full force of his spectral will. He could not wait for another lucky break, another unwitting ferryman to wander into his orbit. He had to hunt. He abandoned his quiet corner and swept through the vast reading rooms, a purposeful, invisible wind. He was no longer a passive observer of the living; he was a predator scanning a herd, searching for the one vessel that could carry him to his destination. He flitted past students cramming for exams, their minds a frantic buzz of dates and formulas. He bypassed history buffs and fiction readers, their thoughts meandering down paths that were useless to him. He needed a scientist. He needed a biologist. He needed someone whose trajectory was aimed directly at the heart of the crisis.\n\nHe found him in the science and technology section, a harried-looking undergraduate with a backpack spilling open, a copy of \u2018Borror and DeLong's Introduction to the Study of Insects\u2019 open on the table in front of him. The young man\u2019s mind was a messy soup of frustration over Dipteran mouthparts and anxiety about an upcoming lab practical in the Hall of Sciences. It was perfect. Tales marshaled his will, a process that was becoming more familiar, if no less costly. He focused not on a word, but on an intention, a destination. He wrapped his consciousness around the student\u2019s own ambient anxiety, becoming a parasite on his stress. When the student finally slammed his textbook shut and slung his heavy backpack over his shoulder, Tales held on with a grim, desperate tenacity. The journey out of the library was just as jarring as before, but this time he was prepared. He was not a kite in a hurricane; he was a pilot, however inexpert, deliberately flying into the storm.\n\nFrom her stone bench, Tonya saw him. Ben Carter emerged from the main doors of the science building, squinting in the bright afternoon sun. His shoulders were slumped, his gait lacking its usual energetic bounce. He carried his backpack slung over one shoulder, and he stared at the ground as he walked, oblivious to the river of students flowing around him. She cataloged the data with cold precision: signs of sleep deprivation, elevated stress, social withdrawal. Specimen #28 was exhibiting predictable, post-traumatic behavioral modifications. She felt no satisfaction, no pity. It was simply information, a new set of variables to be factored into her revised project. He walked across the quad, a solitary, troubled figure lost in a crowd, completely unaware of the patient, dispassionate eyes that were now studying his every move, learning his patterns, mapping his world. He was no longer the one who had interrupted the art. He was the canvas for the next.The journey across campus was a nauseating, high-speed ride on the choppy waves of the student\u2019s anxiety. Tales clung to the undergrad\u2019s frantic energy, a stowaway on a ship of stress. The student\u2019s mind was a chaotic pinball machine of facts and fears: the morphology of a housefly\u2019s tarsus, the terror of a low quiz score, the desperate need for caffeine. They burst through the main doors of the Hall of Sciences into a lobby buzzing with academic purpose. The student, seeing he was late for his lab section, broke into a clumsy, backpack-bouncing run down a crowded hallway. The sudden, propulsive movement was too much for Tales\u2019s tenuous grip. His connection snapped, and he was flung free, tumbling into the relative stillness of the lobby as his unwilling ferryman disappeared around a corner. He had arrived. He was back at the epicenter, a ghost haunting the halls of science, but his target was nowhere in sight.\n\nHe had missed him by less than thirty seconds. As Tales was being pulled into the building, a disoriented phantom swept up in another\u2019s panic, Ben Carter was pushing his way out through the same set of doors. For a fraction of a second, the two men\u2014one of solid, anxious flesh, the other of pure, desperate memory\u2014passed within feet of each other, an impossible intersection of two separate realities. Ben, his head down, felt nothing but the slight shift in air from the opening door. Tales, his perception still reeling from the violent disconnection, registered only a fleeting warmth, a brief spike of a familiar, grieving energy that was lost in the ambient noise before he could identify its source. He had crossed the entire city only to have his quarry slip through his nonexistent fingers at the very last moment.\n\nFrom her silent vantage point on the stone bench, Tonya registered the event with the dispassionate clarity of a motion-activated camera. She saw Ben emerge from the building, his posture a clear deviation from the baseline she had established in her mind. He did not pause to speak with anyone. He did not check his phone. He moved with a leaden, inward-facing focus, his path cutting a straight, unswerving line across the manicured lawn of the quad, heading east. She gave him a lead of fifty yards, a predator allowing its prey the illusion of solitude. Then, with a smooth, unhurried motion, she rose from the bench. She adjusted the brim of her cap, pulled the collar of her jacket up slightly, and began to follow. Her stride was even and measured, her presence designed to melt into the ebb and flow of the student body. She was a shadow detaching itself from other shadows, a hunter beginning the long, patient work of mapping her new specimen\u2019s territory.\n\nBen\u2019s destination was The Daily Grind, the perpetually crowded and noisy campus coffee shop. He sought not conversation but anonymity, the paradoxical solitude that can only be found in a crowd. He ordered a black coffee he didn't want and found a small, sticky table in a dark corner, the loud chatter and the clatter of ceramic mugs forming a wall of sound that buffered him from his own thoughts. He was a fugitive, hiding in plain sight from a crime no one knew he had witnessed. He stared into the black, reflective surface of his coffee, seeing not his own face but the splintered wood of Tonya\u2019s door, the cool grey of the nitrogen cylinder, the hollow infinity in her eyes. He had done the right thing, the only thing he could have done, but the certainty of that action was being eroded by the acid of its consequences. He felt responsible for her, a warden who had locked his prisoner in a cell of her own despair and then walked away with the key.\n\nBack in the Hall of Sciences, Tales began his hunt. The building was a labyrinth of identical hallways, lecture halls, and laboratories. He drifted through solid walls, a ghost on a methodical search pattern, his perception scanning the placards on doors, searching for the nameplate that would lead him to the heart of the matter. He found the entomology wing, a familiar territory of pinned insect displays and the faint, chemical scent of preservatives. He passed the bulletin board, the flyer for the Palouse pilgrimage still tacked to the cork, a relic from a previous lifetime. He continued down the hall, and there it was: a small, unassuming plastic sign slid into a metal bracket beside a locked door. *B. Carter, Grad. Researcher*. He had found the nest. With no need for a key, he passed through the solid wood of the door and into the silent, empty lab. His perception swept the room\u2014the microscope, the scattered research notes, the computer terminal left sleeping. And then he saw it. On the far workbench, under the soft glow of a utility lamp, stood a tall, mesh-sided enclosure. It was a new world, carefully constructed, and inside, perched on a piece of elegant driftwood, a living, breathing praying mantis was meticulously grooming its formidable foreleg.### Chapter 10\n\nThe laboratory was a sanctuary and a crime scene. To DI Tales, standing formless in its center, the small room was a complex tapestry of evidence. The primary exhibit was the mantis, Alistair, perched on a piece of elegant driftwood in its new, spacious enclosure. The meticulous construction of the habitat\u2014the careful layering of substrate, the optimal placement of the branch\u2014spoke with silent eloquence of Ben Carter\u2019s character. He was a builder, a nurturer, a man who responded to a crisis by creating a better, safer world, however small. The sight of the living, thriving creature was a profound relief, a validation of the terrible risks Tales had taken. But it was also a source of deep, chilling dread. This enclosure was Ben\u2019s confession. It was the physical manifestation of the secret that now isolated him, the secret that had made him Tonya\u2019s new obsession. Tales understood with a veteran detective\u2019s certainty that Ben had not simply taken the mantis; he had taken on Tonya\u2019s entire pathology, and he was now carrying it alone.\n\nOutside, in the bright, indifferent afternoon, Tonya watched the entrance to the coffee shop. She was a study in absolute stillness, a chameleon that had perfectly matched the color and texture of its surroundings. She registered the flow of students in and out of the building, the murmur of conversations, the clatter of skateboards, but it was all just atmospheric data, the background noise of her new specimen\u2019s environment. When Ben finally emerged, his coffee untouched, his face a mask of pale, unresolved anxiety, she felt a flicker of something that was not emotion, but a cold, clinical satisfaction. The specimen was exhibiting signs of profound distress. Its routines were disrupted. Its social patterns were fractured. The introduction of a foreign variable\u2014her\u2014had produced a measurable, predictable result. She noted the information, filed it away in the vast, silent catalog of her mind, and waited to see where the distressed creature would seek refuge.\n\nBen could not sit still. The coffee shop, once a comforting wall of sound, had become an echo chamber for his own spiraling thoughts. He had to move. He had to *do* something. The only tangible focus he had, the only part of the preceding night\u2019s madness that he could control, was the mantis. A sudden, urgent, and largely irrational thought seized him: the enclosure needed more ventilation. It was a flimsy pretext, a scientist\u2019s rationalization for a deep, emotional need to return to the only place that felt remotely safe. He abandoned his table, dumped the full cup of coffee into a trash can with a sense of finality, and pushed his way back out into the bright, overwhelming world. His feet, acting on an instinct deeper than conscious thought, carried him back across the quad, back toward the Hall of Sciences, back to his lab.\n\nAs he moved, a shadow detached itself from the crowd. Tonya began her pursuit, a patient, methodical process that was the polar opposite of Ben\u2019s frantic, headlong retreat. She kept a careful distance, using the shifting bodies of other students as moving screens. Her focus was absolute. She noted the way he clutched the strap of his backpack, the tension in his shoulders, the way he failed to deviate his path for an oncoming group, forcing them to part around him. Every gesture was a data point. Every action revealed a new facet of his compromised state. She was not just following him; she was dissecting him from afar, learning the rhythm of his distress, the architecture of his fear. She was the curator, and he was the beautiful, crooked thing she would soon collect.\n\nTales began to search. A being of pure will, untethered by gravity or solid matter, he moved through the building with the silent, relentless efficiency of a spreading gas. He swept through a bustling lecture hall where a professor droned on about mitochondrial DNA, the living minds a sea of boredom and concentration that he passed through like a cold front. He drifted through faculty offices, past professors arguing over grant proposals and staring at computer screens, their private dramas irrelevant to his singular, urgent mission. He was hunting for a specific psychic signature, the unique frequency of Ben Carter\u2019s earnest, guilt-ridden consciousness. He could feel the ambient life of the building, a low, constant hum, but he was searching for a solo instrument in the orchestra, a single, identifiable voice in the choir.\n\nThe inevitable convergence came with a heart-stopping, silent near-miss. As Ben, fumbling with his keys, approached the door to his lab at the end of a long, empty corridor, Tales was drifting out of the adjacent storeroom, having completed his sweep of that section. For a breathtaking instant, they were separated by less than five feet and the thin, permeable barrier between the living and the dead. Tales felt a sudden, sharp spike in the ambient energy, a familiar signal of focused anxiety, but it was gone before he could triangulate it, lost in the echo of his own movement. Ben, his attention fixed on the recalcitrant lock, felt a sudden, inexplicable chill, a prickling on his skin that he dismissed as a draft from the building\u2019s overzealous air conditioning. He finally turned the key, pushed the door open, and stepped inside, the heavy door swinging shut behind him.\n\nHe was safe. The quiet of the lab settled around him, a comforting blanket. His gaze went immediately to the mesh enclosure. Alistair was perched near the top, its head swiveling to watch him, a silent, living gargoyle. A small measure of the tension in Ben\u2019s shoulders eased. This was real. This was manageable. But he was not alone. From the darkest corner of the room, a silent, unseen sentinel watched him. DI Tales had ceased his search. He had found his target. The three of them\u2014the haunted, the hunter, and the ghost\u2014were now together in the same small, sealed room, a fragile ecosystem of secrets and impending doom, while just outside the walls of the building, a patient, observant predator settled in for a long, watchful wait.The lab was Ben\u2019s sanctuary, but it offered no peace. The silence was thick with unspoken fears. He moved with the jerky, inefficient motions of a man running on pure adrenaline and lack of sleep, his mind casting about for a task, any task, that could anchor him. The flimsy pretext that had brought him back here\u2014ventilation\u2014now seemed absurdly transparent even to himself. Still, he latched onto it. He found a small, battery-operated fan in a supply drawer and positioned it near the mesh-sided enclosure, angling it to create a gentle, indirect cross-breeze. It was a meaningless gesture, a nervous tic given physical form, but it was something to *do*. He watched the imperceptible movement of the air, then his gaze settled on Alistair. The mantis, oblivious, continued its patient grooming, a perfect, self-contained being of instinct and purpose. In its alien stillness, Ben saw a composure he desperately craved and knew he would never again possess.\n\nFrom his corner, Tales watched this sad, busy-work ballet with a profound and aching pity. Ben was tending to a cage while the true predator circled the perimeter of his life, unseen and unheeded. The young man\u2019s ignorance was a form of damnation. Tales could feel the frantic, scattered energy radiating from him, a psychic noise of guilt and confusion. A whispered word, a subtle suggestion\u2014those were the tools of a diagnostician trying to guide a patient toward a realization. But the time for subtlety was over. This was an emergency. The patient was bleeding out and refusing to acknowledge the wound. Tales knew he had to attempt something more direct, a warning that could cut through the fog of Ben\u2019s distress. It would be a monumental effort, a reckless expenditure of his fragile energy, but the alternative\u2014to stand by and watch the inevitable unfold\u2014was unthinkable.\n\nTonya\u2019s patience was not infinite; it was simply calibrated to the demands of the hunt. Waiting outside the building was no longer yielding useful data. The specimen had retreated into its den, and passive observation from a distance was now insufficient. She needed to assess the nest itself, to understand the interior geography of his world. A small group of students, laughing and complaining about an upcoming exam, approached the entrance to the Hall of Sciences. Tonya recognized one of them from the department, a first-year she had seen in the company of Dr. Finch. Without a flicker of hesitation, she fell into step behind them, her gait adjusting to match their rhythm, her body language shifting to mimic their casual, collegiate slouch. She became one of them, a ghost in their machine. She passed through the doors as part of the group, a predator cloaked in the harmless colors of the herd, her cold, focused purpose a silent, deadly current in the warm stream of their oblivious lives.\n\nInside the lab, Ben had finally abandoned his pretense of activity and collapsed into his desk chair, his head in his hands. The low hum of the fan and the faint whir of his computer\u2019s cooling system were the only sounds. It was in this moment of despairing quiet that Tales made his move. He gathered his will, focusing it with an intensity that felt like it might tear his very essence apart. He aimed not at Ben\u2019s mind, but at the machine on his desk. He poured all his fear, his knowledge, and his desperate, screaming urgency into the sleeping screen of the computer. For a moment, nothing happened. Then, the screen flickered to life, not with its usual login prompt, but with a cascade of garbled, nonsensical characters, a river of digital gibberish. And in the very center of the chaos, for a single, shimmering second, a string of pixels coalesced into a recognizable shape. The letters were fractured, unstable, as if typed on a keyboard submerged in water: *Symm\u2026ForJ\u2026DANGER*.\n\nBen\u2019s head snapped up at the sudden flash of light. He stared at the screen, his tired eyes struggling to process what they were seeing. The garbled text was already gone, replaced by the standard, placid blue of the login screen. He blinked. A power surge? A graphics card glitch? He rubbed his eyes, the image of the fractured words already fading, dismissed by his rational mind as a stress-induced hallucination, a phantom artifact of an exhausted brain. He sighed, shaking his head at his own frayed nerves, and turned his attention back to the mantis, missing the significance of the omen entirely. Tales, drained and ragged, felt a spectral wave of despair. He had fired his only warning shot, and it had been mistaken for a stray firework.\n\nThe hallways of the Hall of Sciences were a sterile, branching network, but Tonya navigated them with an unerring sense of direction. She moved with a quiet, fluid purpose, her eyes scanning the placards on the walls, her mind cross-referencing the information with the faculty directory she had memorized. She ignored the open doors of bustling lecture halls and the chatter spilling from common areas. She was drawn, as if by magnetism, to the quieter, more secluded corridors of the graduate research wing. The hum of the building was different here\u2014less human, more mechanical. And then she saw it. At the end of a long, quiet hall, a simple plastic nameplate slid into a metal bracket. *B. Carter, Grad. Researcher*. The hunter had arrived at the door to the lair. She stood for a long moment, perfectly still, listening. She heard nothing but the faint, high-pitched whine of the building\u2019s fluorescent lights. With a hand as steady as a surgeon\u2019s, she reached out and rested her gloved fingers on the cool, smooth metal of the doorknob.The cool, smooth metal of the doorknob was a point of absolute reality. Tonya\u2019s gloved fingers wrapped around it, and with a slow, deliberate motion born of infinite patience, she turned. The mechanism inside rotated, hit a point of resistance, and stopped. The door was locked. For a flicker of a moment, the world deviated from her plan, a slight, jarring imperfection in the flow of events. There was no surge of anger, no flicker of frustration in her expression. It was simply new data, a variable that required a revised approach. Forcing the door was a crude, asymmetrical solution, the method of a panicked animal like Ben. Her work required elegance, infiltration, a key. Her hand retreated from the knob, leaving no print, no evidence of her presence. She turned, her soft-soled shoes making no sound on the linoleum floor, and melted back into the quiet emptiness of the corridor. The objective had changed from passive observation to active acquisition.\n\nInside the lab, the almost imperceptible rattle of the knob was a sonic boom in the cathedral of Ben\u2019s anxiety. He froze, his head snapping up from his hands, every nerve ending screaming. The sound was tiny, furtive, the antithesis of a casual colleague trying the door. His heart hammered against his ribs, a frantic, trapped bird. Was it Maya, forgetting something? Was it the building\u2019s maintenance staff? Or was it her? Had she followed him? The sanctuary of the lab instantly transformed into a cage, a baited trap he had willingly walked into. Simultaneously, DI Tales, slumped in his spectral corner, felt it not as a sound but as a sudden, needle-sharp spike of cold intention pressing against the other side of the door. He felt the pure, predatory focus of Tonya Vance, and he felt the subsequent explosion of terror in Ben\u2019s mind. The warning he had failed to deliver was now being announced by the turning of a lock, and it was a language Ben understood perfectly.\n\nSlowly, silently, Ben pushed his chair back. He rose to his feet with the cautious, fluid movements of a prey animal that has sensed the predator at the edge of the clearing. He crept to the door, his own lab now a foreign and hostile territory. His eye went to the small, wire-reinforced glass window in the upper half of the door. He peered through, his breath held tight in his chest, expecting to see a face, a shadow, something. He saw nothing. The corridor was empty, sterile, bathed in the humming, indifferent light of the overhead fixtures. The absolute emptiness was a thousand times more terrifying than a confrontation. It was not his imagination. The sound had been real. She had been there. She had tested the door. And now she was gone. She knew where he was. The hunter had located his den, and now, somewhere in the labyrinth of the building, she was simply waiting.",

                                        "text": "The light was a clean, white scalpel. It sliced through the hushed dimness of the spare bedroom, pinning a single, struggling point of life to a square of polished obsidian. Under the unforgiving glare of the articulated lamp, *Formica rufa*, the red wood ant, soldiered on, its antennae twitching in a frantic semaphore of confusion and alarm. Tonya watched, her breath a slow, controlled tide in her chest. Her world had shrunk to this two-inch stage, this tiny drama of one. She wore no mask, but her face was as serene and immobile as a surgeon\u2019s. Love required stillness. It demanded precision.\n\nShe\u2019d followed this one for two days. A magnificent specimen. The slight, almost imperceptible asymmetry in its gaster, the subtle russet shading on its thorax\u2014it was perfect in its imperfection. It was worthy. He would have liked this one. He would have spent an hour explaining its caste, its pheromonal language, the sheer evolutionary miracle of its existence. Tonya did not need the lecture anymore. She had absorbed it all, letting his knowledge colonize her, a new and sacred biome in the empty space he\u2019d left behind. Now, she was the curator of his passion.\n\nHer fingers, gloved in powder-free nitrile, moved with the unthinking grace of a concert pianist. She selected a pair of tweezers whose tips were ground to a near-molecular thinness. With a movement too swift for the ant to register, she nudged the tiny glass cloche covering it, creating a space just wide enough. The second instrument was a single human hair, plucked that morning, glued to the end of a delicate rod. She dipped its tip into a waiting bead of liquid glistening on a glass slide. Aconitine, extracted with painstaking effort from a single Wolf\u2019s Bane plant she cultivated in a black pot on her windowsill. It was a poison of myth. A poet\u2019s poison. It was fitting.\n\nThe ant, sensing the shift in air pressure, surged for the gap. Tonya was ready. The hair-tip applicator met the ant\u2019s antenna in a kiss of shocking intimacy. The creature froze. A tremor, a violent, microscopic shudder, ran the length of its segmented body. Its legs, so full of frantic purpose a moment ago, curled inward. It was over. The stillness that followed was profound, a vacuum. Tonya felt it in her own lungs. She held her breath with the deceased, a shared, final exhalation.\n\nThen, the second act. The art. She carefully transferred the tiny corpse to a block of black velvet, the same used by jewelers to display their finest solitaires. The posing was the most difficult part. It took an hour. Micro-forceps, stainless steel pins no thicker than a nerve ending, a magnifying visor that lowered over her eyes like a knight\u2019s helmet. She worked to arrange it not in a posture of life, but in a posture of offering. Its head was tilted, its legs arranged in a pattern of submission. And then, the lips. She preferred the term \u2018lips\u2019 to \u2018mandibles\u2019. Mandibles was a cold, chitinous word. Lips were for kissing, for speaking, for tasting. With a tool of her own design, a tiny lever of sharpened dental wire, she gently, reverently, parted them.\n\nThe camera, a hulking Canon with a macro lens the size of a fist, was already in position. She leaned in, her eye to the viewfinder. The world vanished. There was only this. The alien, terrifying, beautiful architecture of the ant\u2019s mouth. The serrated inner edges, the delicate palps, the textures invisible to the naked eye. It was a secret world. A world only she and he could ever truly appreciate. She adjusted the focus by a micron. The silence in the room was a held breath, waiting for a fever to break.\n\nClick.\n\nThe shutter\u2019s report was a soft, final punctuation. On the camera\u2019s screen, the image bloomed. A landscape of dreadful intimacy. She had captured it. The essence. The last, silent word spoken from those lips. Another photograph for the collection. Another testament to a love so large it had to be expressed in the smallest of deaths.\n\nFrom his non-place in the back corner of a Spokane library, the one on South Lincoln Street, DI Tales watched the image upload. It appeared on the photostream he monitored, a fresh wound among the old. The username was \u2018SymmetryForJ.\u2019 The photo was titled \u2018Red Word.\u2019 He felt the familiar, phantom chill, the one that had been his only constant companion for what felt like a lifetime. He was a doctor, or had been. He saw the world in terms of diagnosis. This was not art. This was a symptom.\n\nThe living moved around him like fish in a current he could not feel. A young woman with headphones on, her expression slack-jawed, walked through the space his left arm occupied. He felt nothing, of course. There was no substance to be disturbed. He was a draft of memory in a room full of warm bodies. He had long ago stopped flinching. His focus was absolute. He zoomed in on the image, not with a mouse and keyboard, but with a simple act of will. The picture filled his perception, a universe of texture and shadow.\n\n\u2018SymmetryForJ.\u2019 Tonya, he called her. He didn\u2019t know her real name, but she felt like a Tonya. Solid, grounded, with a hint of Slavic tragedy in her bones. He\u2019d built a profile in the empty chambers of his mind. Female, late 30s. Solitary. Highly intelligent, patient. Grieving. The \u2018J\u2019 was the key. J was the ghost she was trying to appease. The recipient of these macabre love letters.\n\nTales had been a diagnostician. He looked for patterns. At first, it was just the ants. Common Lasius niger. Then, the species began to diversify. Pavement ants. Carpenter ants. Now, Formica rufa, the red wood ant. The geography of her collection was expanding. The technique was improving, too. The early kills were clumsy, the carapaces sometimes crushed. Now, they were flawless. She was perfecting her craft. A surgeon honing her technique. The thought made the air in his non-lungs feel thin. Doctors, good ones, understood that a disease left untreated would metastasize. It would seek a larger host.\n\nHe had died on a Tuesday. A pulmonary embolism, silent and swift as an assassin. One moment he was complaining to his nurse, Martha, about the hospital\u2019s dreadful coffee, the next he was\u2026 observing. Watching his own body slump in his chair, watching the panic, the futile CPR, the pronouncement. He had been a man of science and substance. He was now a hypothesis, a ghost story. And the most frustrating part of his condition was the impotence. He was a detective who could not lift a fingerprint, a doctor who could not touch his patient. He could only watch. And worry.\n\nHe sifted through the data of the new photograph. She was getting bolder. The background of \u2018Red Word\u2019 was not the familiar polished obsidian. It was a piece of dark, rough-hewn wood. He willed the image to expand again, focusing on a sliver of the background. He could make out the grain. The unique, swirling pattern of a burl. Oak, maybe? And in the corner, a tiny detail she would have missed. A watermark. A faint, almost invisible stamp. A logo. He couldn\u2019t quite make it out. It was a circle with something inside. A bird? An initial?\n\nHe felt a surge of something that might have once been adrenaline. It was a lead. A tangible connection, however faint, to the physical world where she operated. He had to identify that mark. He had spent his life, his real one, solving puzzles inside the human body. This was no different. He was simply looking for the source of the infection. He had to find Tonya. He had to understand the shape of her love, the architecture of her grief. He had to stop her before she decided that ants were no longer enough. Before she looked for a larger vessel to hold all her terrible, beautiful devotion. The library was closing. The lights flickered once, a signal to the living. The patrons began to pack their bags, their movements solid and sure. Tales remained, a silent sentinel in the gathering dark, staring at a picture of a dead ant\u2019s lips, feeling the cold, inexorable certainty that he was the only one who knew a storm was coming."

                                        "text": "The janitor, a man named Gary whose weary slouch Tales had memorized like a medical chart, made his final round. His keys jangled a lonely, metallic tune as he locked the main doors, plunging the library into a cathedral-like quiet. For the living, the building was now empty. For Tales, it was finally his. He drifted from his corner, a silent eddy in the still air, and returned his full consciousness to the image of \u2018Red Word.\u2019 The physical screens had long since gone dark, but the image was seared into his perception, a slide under the microscope of his mind.\n\nHe pushed against the photograph, an act of pure will that had no physical correlation but felt like leaning into a strong wind. The watermark. The circle with the bird inside. The grain of the wood was a landscape of ridges and valleys, a topography he could almost feel. It was oak, he was almost certain, and the specific pattern was from a burl, a chaotic knot of growth that created the most beautiful, most unpredictable grains. J, the man for whom all this was done, must have appreciated such things. An appreciation for the complex beauty born from trauma and deviation. It was all of a piece. The imperfect ant, the burl wood, the grief that twisted love into this meticulous, murderous art.\n\nHis impotence was a physical ache, a phantom limb where his entire body used to be. In life, he would have been on the phone, delegating. He would have had a junior detective running license plates, an intern cross-referencing databases. He would have had his hands on the problem, palpating it for weaknesses. Now, he was reduced to this. A spectator, waiting for the world to bring him the clues he needed. The logo was a question he could not type into a search bar. He was a consciousness trapped in a bottle, and the entire internet, the greatest library in human history, was on the other side of the glass. He could only wait for someone else to turn the page.\n\n* * *\n\nAfter the final click, Tonya dismantled her world with the same reverence she had used to build it. The hulking Canon was powered down, its lens cap replaced with a soft thud. The tiny, posed corpse of the ant was transferred from the velvet block into a small glass-topped specimen box, which she labeled in a precise, architectural script: *Formica rufa, #27, Red Word*. It joined the others on a shelf in a temperature-controlled cabinet, a growing congregation of tiny martyrs. Each box was a votive, a prayer rendered in chitin and formaldehyde.\n\nShe stripped off the nitrile gloves, turning them inside out and sealing them in a small bag. Her tools were wiped down first with alcohol, then with a sterile cloth, before being laid back in their velvet-lined case. The tweezers, the micro-forceps, the hair-tip applicator, her custom-made mandible-lever\u2014they all rested in their form-fitting depressions, an arsenal of delicate violence. The obsidian square and the velvet block were polished and put away. The last piece to be moved was the block of burl wood. She ran her bare fingers over its chaotic, swirling grain. J had given it to her. It was a cheese board, meant for brie and prosciutto and gatherings with friends. A lifetime ago. He\u2019d bought it from a craftsman at a weekend market downtown. \u2018Look at the grain, Tonya,\u2019 he\u2019d said, his voice buzzing with the excitement he found in the details of the world. \u2018It\u2019s like a map of a storm.\u2019 Now, it was a stage. A beautiful, scarred landscape for her tragedies of one.\n\nHer small apartment was a testament to a life distilled to its essentials. Clean, spartan, a single black pot on the windowsill where the Wolf\u2019s Bane grew, its purple flowers a splash of royal poison against the grey Spokane sky. She didn\u2019t eat here, not really. She didn\u2019t entertain. She worked. She remembered. And she curated. She sat at her small desk and pulled up the photostream for \u2018SymmetryForJ.\u2019 She looked at \u2018Red Word\u2019 not as a photograph of a dead insect, but as a message sent into the ether. A message for an audience of one, who she knew could never see it. The intimacy of the image was the only way she could scream. The silence of her apartment was the only space vast enough to contain the echo.\n\n* * *\n\nThe sun rose, casting long, dusty fingers of light through the library\u2019s tall windows. The sounds of the city returned: the distant growl of traffic, the squeal of a bus\u2019s air brakes. Then came the rattle of Gary\u2019s keys, and the living began to trickle back in. Tales watched them, a current of purposeful bodies flowing around his stationary island of nothingness. A student, panicked about a deadline, raced to the history section. A homeless man, seeking warmth, settled into a carrel with a newspaper. A young mother steered her toddler towards the colourful promise of the children\u2019s wing. They were all closed loops, preoccupied with their own narratives.\n\nTales drifted, a disembodied observer, his focus a hunter\u2019s. He needed a specific kind of prey. Someone curious. Someone with a connection to craft, to wood, to local commerce. He floated behind a man in a flannel shirt who was poring over schematics for deck construction. For a moment, Tales felt a flicker of hope, but the man\u2019s search was purely practical, his queries filled with terms like \u2018load-bearing\u2019 and \u2018pressure-treated.\u2019 He was not looking for art. Tales moved on. He had all the time in the world, a fact that was both a comfort and a curse. His own life had been a frantic race against the clock, against the progress of disease. Now, he was suspended in an endless, agonizing waiting room.\n\nIt was well past noon when he found her. A young woman with dark-rimmed glasses and a silver stud in her nose. She sat at a terminal in the reference section, surrounded by books on Pacific Northwest art. Her posture was studious, her brow furrowed in concentration. Tales positioned himself behind her, his non-physical form perfectly placed to see her screen. She was writing a paper, the title at the top of the document read: \u2018From Totems to Tables: The Enduring Spirit of PNW Artisanship.\u2019 He felt it again, that ghost of adrenaline. This was it. She typed, her fingers flying across the keyboard. Her search query was a gift from a god he no longer believed in: \u201clocal Spokane woodcraft artisans.\u201d A page of results bloomed on the screen. A list of names and businesses. Tales scanned them, his focus narrowing. And then she clicked on a link. The website loaded, and the logo appeared, crisp and clear in the top left corner. A perfect circle. And inside, a stylized bird\u2014a wren, he now saw\u2014with its head cocked, its beak forming the cross-bar of a capital \u2018B\u2019. Below it, the words: \u2018Burl & Beak Woodcraft.\u2019 He had it. He had a name. It was a tangible piece of the world, a pin dropped on a map. For the first time since he had died, DI Tales had a destination. Now he just had to find a way to get there."

                                        "text": "The library was a cage, elegant and quiet, but a cage nonetheless. For weeks, or months\u2014time had become a viscous, unreliable fluid\u2014Tales had accepted its boundaries as the limits of his new reality. The world outside the tall arched windows was a silent film he could observe but not join. But now, with a name and a logo burned into his mind, the library\u2019s familiar silence felt like a suffocating pressure. \u2018Burl & Beak Woodcraft.\u2019 It was a location. A place of substance and sawdust, a place where Tonya had been. To a ghost, a physical coordinate was an impossible, taunting dream.\n\nHis attention snapped back to the young woman with the dark-rimmed glasses. She was his only chance. He watched as she saved her document, closed the browser tabs, and began to gather her belongings with the unhurried movements of someone whose day was winding down. A canvas tote bag, a dented metal water bottle, a worn copy of a book on forestry. Each item was a solid, real thing, a piece of a world he could no longer manipulate. She was his vessel, his unwitting ferryman. He had to try. He had spent his first life diagnosing the frailties of the human body; he would spend his second diagnosing the physics of his own dissolution.\n\nHe marshaled his focus, a power he was only beginning to understand. It felt like holding his breath and flexing a muscle that wasn't there. He concentrated everything he was, his memory, his worry, his fading identity, into a single point of intention aimed directly at her. As she slung the tote bag over her shoulder and began to walk towards the main exit, Tales pushed off from his corner, not moving through the air so much as willing himself to be adjacent to her. He felt a strange, elastic pull, as if he had become a satellite caught in the faint gravitational field of her life force.\n\nThe automatic doors slid open with a soft hiss, and the student stepped out into the late afternoon light. Tales followed, and the world exploded. For the first time since his death, he was outside. The sensory onslaught was a physical blow. The muted, dusty air of the library was replaced by a riot of smells: hot asphalt, diesel exhaust, the sweet, cloying scent of a flowering bush nearby. The quiet hum of the library\u2019s HVAC system was annihilated by the roar of a passing bus, its immense vibration passing through his formless state like a shockwave, leaving him feeling frayed and scattered. The sunlight was not the gentle, slanted beam he was used to, but a brilliant, brutal glare that seemed to make his own transparency shimmer and thin.\n\nHe fought to hold on. The pull to the student, his anchor, was the only thing that kept him from dissolving entirely or snapping back to the safe, dead quiet of the library. He was a kite in a hurricane, and she was the hand holding the string. She put her headphones on, oblivious, and crossed at the light, her head bobbing to a beat he couldn't hear. A cyclist swerved around her, and for a terrifying second, passed directly through Tales. The rush of kinetic energy and the fleeting, phantom sensation of a living, straining body was so alien, so overwhelming, that his concentration wavered. The world flickered, and for a half-second, he saw the familiar shelves of the library\u2019s biography section superimposed over the moving traffic. He clamped down with his will, the effort a silent scream. The street solidified around him again.\n\nHe was a parasite of perception, clinging to her as she walked west on Main Avenue. He didn't know where \u2018Burl & Beak\u2019 was. His knowledge of the city was a static memory from a life that felt increasingly like someone else\u2019s. He couldn't ask for directions. He couldn't pull a phone from a pocket that didn't exist and look at a map. He could only follow this oblivious stranger and pray that her path would bring him within range. He scanned the storefronts they passed, his gaze sweeping over coffee shops, boutiques, and law offices. He was hunting for a sign, a logo, a breadcrumb. He was a detective again, but his beat was now the crowded, chaotic streets of a city he could only haunt, chasing the ghost of a woman who was still very much alive."

For Tales, every step was a gamble. He had to learn the rules of this new state of being on the fly. He discovered that a crowd was a nightmare, a chaotic mass of life forces that threatened to pull him in a dozen different directions at once, diluting his will. He learned that proximity was key; if she got more than thirty feet ahead of him, the tether stretched thin and taut, and the safe, oppressive silence of the South Lincoln Street library would begin to hum at the edges of his perception, a siren call back to his cage. He was a deep-sea diver on a fragile air hose, and the library was his bell jar on the surface.\n\nShe paused to look in the window of a bakery, her attention caught by a pyramid of glazed lemon tarts. Tales drifted beside her, the phantom scent of sugar and browned butter a cruel memory. Through the glass, he watched a family laughing, a small boy smearing chocolate on his cheek. They were so vibrant, so solid. He felt a profound, hollow ache that had nothing to do with a body. It was the grief of being an annotation in the margin of a book everyone else was still living. The student, deciding against the tart, moved on, and Tales was pulled along in her wake, relieved and resentful in equal measure. Her simple, mundane choices were the arbiters of his fate.\n\nHer path took her away from the main thoroughfare and onto a quieter street of brick-fronted buildings, where the chain stores gave way to independent shops. Art galleries, a custom frame store, a shop selling hand-bound journals. The air here felt different, less frantic. It felt closer. Tales scanned every sign, every doorway, his focus a desperate searchlight. The student was walking with more purpose now, as if her destination was near. And then he saw it. Not where she was headed, but down a narrow intersecting lane she was about to pass. It was a modest sign, a disc of dark wood hanging from an iron bracket, swaying slightly in the breeze. On it, expertly carved, was the logo from the website. The wren, the circle, the elegant script beneath: *Burl & Beak Woodcraft*.\n\nIt was a moment of pure, clinical triumph, followed immediately by a surge of panic. His anchor, the student, was not turning. She was walking straight past the lane, her headphones a barrier to any plea he could never make. He could feel the distance growing, the tether stretching. Ten feet. Fifteen. The library hummed louder in his non-existent ears. He had a choice, and he had only a second to make it. He could stay with the safety of his living host, follow her wherever she was going, and hope he could find his way back to this spot another day, another week, another lifetime. Or he could let go. He could sever the connection and attempt the fifty-foot leap to the shop on his own, with no idea if his consciousness could survive such a transit untethered. It was the difference between a chronic condition and an acute, potentially fatal, event.\n\nHe made the choice a doctor makes when the conservative treatment has failed. He cut. With a final, desperate act of will, he focused everything he was\u2014the sum of his memories, his methodical mind, the full weight of his concern for the unknown Tonya\u2014on the wooden sign. He let go of the student. The sensation was terrifying, an abrupt and total disconnection. The world dissolved into a meaningless roar of sensory data. Light, sound, and motion blended into a nauseating, colorless storm. He was unmoored, a ghost in a hurricane, his very identity threatening to fray and shred into nothing. He was no longer observing the world; he was being consumed by it.\n\nThen, impact. Not physical, but existential. His fragmented perception slammed into a new focus and solidified. The chaotic noise of the street vanished, replaced by a profound, woody silence. He was inside. The air, if he could have breathed it, was thick with the clean, sharp scent of sawdust and the deeper, resinous perfume of tung oil. He had made it. He was in a small, beautifully curated showroom. Sunlight streamed through the front window, illuminating the intricate grains of finished furniture: a dining table with a live edge that flowed like a river, a set of chairs whose backs curved like human spines, shelves laden with bowls and cutting boards of every shape and size. It was a gallery of captured nature. And on a display stand near the back, he saw it. A stack of round oak burl cheese boards, their surfaces a maelstrom of swirling, chaotic patterns. One of them was missing. One of them was in Tonya\u2019s spare bedroom, serving as a stage for her tiny, perfect deaths. He was at the source."

                                        "text": "The workshop was a sanctuary of potential. Unlike the library, which was a repository of finished thoughts and closed histories, this place hummed with a silent, vibrant future. Half-finished chairs stood like skeletal promises, and massive slabs of raw, uncut lumber leaned against one wall, their bark still clinging like old memories. They were books waiting to be opened, stories waiting to be told. Tales drifted through the space, his formless state allowing him to pass through a workbench cluttered with chisels and hand planes, their steel edges gleaming under the dusty light. He felt a sense of profound, almost professional respect for the order within the chaos. This was a different kind of operating theater.\n\nHe came to a stop before the display stand. He focused on the stack of cheese boards, identical in shape but each one a unique universe of pattern. The wood grain swirled like cream in dark coffee, like weather patterns seen from space, like the intricate pathways of a neural network. He understood why J had been drawn to them, and why Tonya had chosen one as a stage. It was a beautiful scar. A geological event frozen in time. He ran his perception over the top board, imagining the weight and texture, the faint drag of its polished surface. He was a connoisseur of patterns, and this was a masterpiece of organized chaos, so much like the diseases he used to hunt.\n\nA door at the back of the showroom creaked open, and a man emerged from the dust-filled workshop beyond. He was broad-shouldered, in his late fifties maybe, with a thick grey beard that had captured a fine gilding of sawdust. He wore a heavy canvas apron over a faded flannel shirt, and his hands, as he wiped them on a rag, were wide and calloused, but moved with a surprising delicacy. He exuded a quiet, grounded energy, the polar opposite of the city's frantic pulse. This was the craftsman. The creator.\n\nThe man, oblivious to his spectral visitor, walked over to a magnificent walnut desk that was clearly his own handiwork. He grunted softly, a sound of satisfaction, as he picked up a small, hand-carved wren from its surface and blew a stray speck of dust from its wing. He then turned his attention to a tablet mounted on a wooden stand. With a swipe of a thick finger, the screen came to life. Tales drifted closer, his entire being constricting into a tight knot of focus. This was it. The point of access. The archive.\n\nThe craftsman tapped through several screens, his movements methodical. He was checking sales figures, cross-referencing them with an inventory list. Tales watched, a silent phantom hovering over his shoulder. The screen showed lists of items, prices, dates. It was a stream of raw data he was powerless to navigate himself. He could only wait, a beggar at the window of a banquet, hoping a scrap of information would be dropped. The man\u2019s finger hovered over a file labeled \u2018Spokane Weekend Market \u2013 Sales.\u2019 Tales felt the phantom charge of adrenaline again. J had bought the board at a market. This was the right vein.\n\nThe man opened the file. A list of transactions appeared, dated a little over a year ago. It was a long list, a successful weekend. The craftsman scrolled slowly, his brow furrowed slightly as he reconciled the numbers. Tales\u2019s perception devoured the screen, scanning names and item descriptions. *Cedar Box. Walnut Bowl. Cherry Spoon Set.* He saw names\u2014Miller, Chen, Rodriguez\u2014a litany of the living, the solid, the people who could buy things and take them home. He searched for a Tonya, a T., anything. Nothing. The craftsman was nearing the bottom of the list. A cold dread, the familiar feeling of a dead end, began to seep into Tales.\n\nThen the man\u2019s finger stopped. He tapped on a line, expanding it. Item: *Oak Burl Round Board, 12\u201d*. Date: a Saturday in late May. And there, under \u2018Customer,\u2019 was the name. It wasn\u2019t Tonya. It was a simple, elegant entry: J. Alistair Finch. Below it was an email address. J.A.Finch@spokane.edu.\n\nJ. Alistair Finch. The \u2018J\u2019 was no longer a variable. It was a man. A man with a name, a man with an affiliation to the local university. The entire architecture of the mystery shifted, its foundation settling into something solid. J wasn't just a ghost Tonya was grieving; he was a person who had lived and worked and bought things in this very city. Tales felt a surge of elation so pure it was almost painful. It was a diagnosis. He had found the patient\u2019s name on the chart.\n\nThe craftsman finished his task, locked the tablet, and returned to the tangible world of his workshop, the door closing behind him with a soft click. Tales was left alone in the silent showroom with the new, explosive piece of information. J. Alistair Finch. He repeated the name in his mind, engraving it into his memory. He had a name. It was the first solid thing he had held since he\u2019d died. And like everything solid, it was completely out of his reach. He was still a ghost in a locked room, but now he knew the name of the man who had built the prison. His focus shifted from the craftsman\u2019s shop to the wider world beyond the windows. Spokane University. It was another pin on the map, a place miles away. He had learned to jump, but it had nearly shredded him. Now, he had to figure out how to fly."

                                        "text": "The elation was a flash of heat, a magnesium flare that burned brightly for a moment before sputtering out, leaving behind the cold, grey ash of his reality. J. Alistair Finch. Spokane University. The information was a key, but he was standing on the wrong side of a locked and soundproofed door. The woodshop, once a thrilling destination, now felt like another room in his prison. Its quietude, once a relief from the street, was now the silence of a dead end. He had to move. The infection, he knew, was not centered here; this was merely a point of transmission. The true pathology was rooted in the life and memory of Professor Finch.\n\nHe drifted to the front window, his form shimmering in the afternoon sun. The lane outside was quiet, but at its mouth, the main street was a river of metal and intention. Cars, trucks, delivery vans\u2014each a private, sealed container moving at impossible speeds. He had nearly disintegrated making a fifty-foot jump. A cross-town journey of several miles was unthinkable. Then he saw it. A city bus, long and articulated like some gentle, herbivorous beast, pulled to a stop a block away. Its doors folded open with a pneumatic sigh, disgorging a handful of people and swallowing a new group. It was a vessel. A public, mobile container full of the very life force he\u2019d learned to use as an anchor. It wasn't one person he could lose, but a dozen he could cling to, a floating raft of souls. The plan formed in his mind with the swift, intuitive logic of a differential diagnosis. It was reckless, untried, and his only option.\n\nLeaving the sanctuary of Burl & Beak was just as jarring as his first exit from the library. He braced himself, focusing on the bus as his target, and pushed through the window. The world rushed in again, a cacophony of roaring engines, distant sirens, and the sharp, unfiltered sunlight that made him feel thin and transparent. He fought the sensory overload, his will a thread stretched to its breaking point, and threw himself toward the bus just as its doors began to close. He passed through the glass and metal shell, the transition like a gasp of cold water, and found himself inside. The chaos of the street was instantly muffled, replaced by a low, vibrating hum and a dense, soupy atmosphere of human presence. The air was thick with stale perfume, damp coats, and the collective, low-grade anxieties and daydreams of two dozen strangers. He was a virus that had successfully breached the cell wall.\n\nThe journey was a new kind of vertigo. The world slid past the windows at a speed that felt both unreal and deeply unsettling, the familiar city rendered into a fluid blur. Tales anchored himself not to a single person, but to the general, ambient life of the bus itself. He felt the dull throb of a teenager\u2019s bass-heavy music through her headphones, the weary frustration of a man who\u2019d missed his stop, the quiet contentment of an elderly woman watching the world go by. He was awash in the mundane currents of their lives, a ghost on public transport, invisible, unnoticed, and more lonely than he had ever been in his silent library. He scanned the faces, the postures, the tired expressions, seeing them all with a clinician\u2019s eye. A city of symptoms. The bus route, blessedly, angled toward the university district, and when he saw the grand, collegiate gothic architecture of the Spokane University gates loom into view, he felt a phantom relief so profound it was almost a physical sensation. As the bus sighed to a stop, he prepared himself and plunged back out into the world.\n\n* * *\n\nTonya sat in the dimness of her spare bedroom, the sacred space. The photograph of \u2018Red Word\u2019 glowed on her monitor. It was, by all technical measures, perfect. The focus was flawless, the lighting dramatic. The offering was clear. And yet, it felt inadequate. A whisper when she needed a shout. Her love for J, his passion which was now her passion, was an immense, roaring thing. An ant, no matter how magnificent, no matter how poetically dispatched, felt like a single, insufficient syllable in a vast, complex language of grief. J had been a man who saw entire ecosystems in a single drop of pond water, who could discourse for an hour on the brutal elegance of a hornet\u2019s sting or the iridescent shimmer of a dragonfly\u2019s wing. He had taught her to see the universe in the small, and now her grief demanded she find a larger microcosm.\n\nShe turned away from her own work and opened a new browser window. Her fingers, no longer gloved but just as precise, typed a search query into the bar. *Mantidae*. The screen filled with images that were both monstrous and beautiful. Praying mantises. Their triangular heads, their intelligent, alien eyes, their powerful, spiked forelegs folded in mock piety. They were predators, patient and ruthless. They were cannibals. Their postures seemed to mimic human emotion in a way that an ant\u2019s frantic scuttling never could. A posture of prayer. A posture of judgment. She clicked through the images, her face as still and focused as it was when she held the aconitine-tipped hair. She was a curator seeking a new centerpiece for her collection. Her love demanded it. It demanded precision, but it also demanded escalation. The thought settled in her with a calm, cold certainty. She would need a larger cloche.\n\n* * *\n\nThe university campus was a world unto itself. Unlike the weary, transient energy of the bus, this place thrummed with a nervous, ambitious vitality. Students flowed like blood cells through the arteries of the main quad, their minds full of deadlines, romantic entanglements, and the vast, terrifying promise of the future. Tales felt the energetic hum of it all, but it was a frequency he could no longer tune to. He was a memory haunting a place dedicated to new knowledge. He had one goal: find the digital ghost of J. Alistair Finch. He gravitated instinctively toward the largest, most imposing building on the quad, a cathedral of learning with \u2018Foley Library\u2019 carved above its stone archway. Another library. It seemed the dead were drawn to repositories of the past.\n\nInside, the atmosphere was a startling fusion of old and new. The scent of aging paper and leather bindings mingled with the faint, electronic heat of a thousand laptops. It was brighter, louder, and far more crowded than his quiet corner on South Lincoln Street. He drifted through the main reference hall, a silent observer in a hive of activity. He needed a screen, an access point. He found one in a carrel where a young man with a perpetually furrowed brow was frantically typing a paper. Tales waited, a patient predator. His opportunity came when the student, exhausted, leaned back and opened a new tab to mindlessly scroll a news feed. It was here that Tales discovered a new, subtle aspect of his condition. He couldn\u2019t touch the keyboard, but by concentrating his will, his desperate need, he could create a faint psychic pressure, a whisper of suggestion in the user\u2019s own mind. A stray thought. *Department faculty page*. *Professor name*. It was like trying to steer a ship by blowing on its sail.\n\nHe focused his intent, a silent, desperate prayer aimed at the distracted student. *Entomology. Finch.* The student\u2019s eyes glazed over for a moment, then he shook his head as if to clear it. He typed \u2018Spokane University English Department\u2019 into the search bar. A dead end. Tales recoiled, the effort leaving him feeling thin and frayed. His influence was negligible, a statistical anomaly in the noise of a human mind. He would have to wait. He drifted to the next terminal, and the next, a ghost begging for a glimpse of a memory. It took an hour, an eternity of watching students research dead poets and obscure economic theories. Finally, a young woman researching local ecological topics navigated to the university\u2019s Biology department website. From there, it was a single click to the Entomology sub-department. And there he was.\n\nThe name was at the top of a short list of faculty. *J. Alistair Finch, Professor (Emeritus)*. Next to it was a photograph. The man had a warm, intelligent face, etched with laugh lines around kind, inquisitive eyes. He wore a field shirt and a wide-brimmed hat, and he was smiling, a genuine, unforced smile that seemed to encompass the whole world. This was J. This was the man who had loved the chaotic beauty of burl wood and the pheromonal language of ants. This was the source of Tonya\u2019s terrible devotion. Below his name and title were links to his publications\u2014papers with titles like \u2018Swarm Intelligence in *Tetramorium immigrans*\u2019 and \u2018The Role of Asymmetry in Mate Selection of *Vespula pensylvanica*.\u2019 It was a map of his mind, the very knowledge that had colonized Tonya. And then Tales saw the final link, placed at the very bottom of the page. It was a simple, three-word hyperlink that felt as heavy as a tombstone. \u2018In Memoriam: Dr. Finch.\u2019 With a will that was not his own, the student clicked the link. A new page loaded. It contained the photograph again, but this time it was accompanied by a block of text. Tales drank it in, the final pieces of the diagnosis clicking into place. \u201cA brilliant entomologist, a beloved mentor\u2026 passed away suddenly last spring\u2026 a tragic hiking accident near Palouse Falls\u2026 a place he loved for its stark beauty and unique insect populations.\u201d A fall. Not a quiet, peaceful end, but a sudden, violent severance. A trauma. And in that one, awful, elegant word, DI Tales finally understood the shape of Tonya\u2019s grief. It wasn't a sickness. It was a wound. A raw, gaping wound she was trying to suture, one tiny, perfect stitch at a time."

                                        "text": "The diagnosis had been made. J. Alistair Finch. Palouse Falls. A traumatic, accidental death. Staring at the smiling, sun-weathered face on the university\u2019s memorial page, Tales felt the cold, analytical framework of his investigation dissolve. This was not a puzzle to be solved, but a wound to be understood. The morbid artistry of \u2018SymmetryForJ\u2019 was not the symptom of a deranged mind, but the desperate, ritualistic language of a shattered one. Tonya was not building a collection; she was trying to reconstruct a world, to speak to a man whose entire philosophy was contained in the minute, elegant architecture of the creatures she now sacrificed. The precision wasn't psychopathy; it was reverence.\n\nHe was a doctor again, standing over a patient he could not touch, reading a chart he could not write in. The patient was Tonya, and her sickness was grief. The locus of infection was the memory of a man, and the site of the initial trauma was a place of stark beauty and sudden violence miles away from the city. Palouse Falls. The name echoed in the silent chambers of his consciousness. To get there was to visit the scene of the crime that had created all the others. But the journey presented an obstacle that felt absolute. The chaotic, fifty-foot leap across the street from the library had nearly discorporated him. A journey of a hundred miles over open country, with nothing to anchor him but the empty sky and the rushing earth, was a form of suicide he wasn\u2019t sure he could even commit. He needed a vehicle, not of steel and glass, but of flesh and blood.\n\nHis will, a newly discovered and subtle instrument, prodded at the mind of the student staring at the screen. It wasn't control, but a gentle, targeted suggestion, like a therapist guiding a patient toward a painful memory. *Scroll down. See who remembered him.* The student\u2019s finger twitched on the mouse, and the page moved, revealing a section beneath the official eulogy. A comment thread. A digital condolence book filled with the grief of colleagues and the fond reminiscences of former students. Tales scanned the entries, his perception drinking in the words. \u201cA true mentor.\u201d \u201cHe made me see the world differently.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll never forget his lecture on parasitic wasps.\u201d Then, near the bottom, he found it. The entry was shorter than the others, its professionalism a stark contrast to the emotional outpourings around it. It was from a user named \u2018T. Vance.\u2019 It read: \u2018An irreplaceable mind. His curation of the departmental teaching collection was an inspiration.\u2019 The words were a shock of recognition. *Curation*. The very word he had used to describe Tonya\u2019s work. And the initial, T. Tonya Vance. The name felt right. It felt solid. She wasn\u2019t just a ghost\u2019s obsession; she was an apprentice who had lost her master, a curator left alone in the museum.\n\nThe decision had settled in her heart with the quiet finality of a closing door. Ants were a language of the soil, of the collective. They were prose. She needed poetry. She needed a creature whose form was a statement, whose life was a solitary drama. Her old, reliable sedan, kept as meticulously as her surgical tools, carried her away from her quiet street and toward the city's industrial periphery. She bypassed the bright, family-friendly pet stores in favor of a low, cinder-block building tucked away in a row of auto body shops and plumbing suppliers. A simple, hand-painted sign read \u2018The Reptile Annex.\u2019 Inside, the air was warm and heavy, a cocktail of damp earth, heated water, and the faint, musky scent of life held in careful suspension. It was a library of living things, their stories told in scales and carapaces instead of paper and ink.\n\nShe did not browse the terrariums filled with sleeping pythons and watchful geckos. Her purpose was too specific for idle curiosity. She approached the counter, behind which a man with heavily tattooed forearms was carefully adjusting the nozzle of a misting system. He looked up, his expression one of weary patience. Tonya spoke, and her voice, unused for hours, was a low and steady thing, devoid of hesitation. \u201cI need a *Hierodula membranacea*. A subadult female, if you have one.\u201d She used the scientific name without affectation. It was simply the correct term. The man\u2019s eyebrows rose in surprise, his practiced spiel for amateur lizard enthusiasts dying on his lips. This was not a casual customer. He nodded slowly, wiping his hands on his jeans. \"The Giant Asian. Right. We have a few. They're temperamental.\" Tonya\u2019s face remained a serene mask. \"I'm aware,\" she said. \"Temperament is what I'm looking for.\"\n\nBack at the university, Tales had a name and a destination, a combination that felt both potent and useless. He abandoned the library, a place of past knowledge, and drifted toward the source: the Entomology Department. The building was quieter, more focused. Hallways were lined with glass-fronted cabinets displaying insect collections, J. Alistair Finch\u2019s legacy in a thousand pinned specimens. Tales was a ghost haunting a mausoleum that was still, somehow, alive. He floated from office to lab, a spectre in the halls of science, searching for his ride. He observed a pair of grad students arguing cheerfully over mite classifications, and an old professor, a contemporary of Finch\u2019s, staring blankly out his window, lost in a memory Tales could only guess at. He was looking for motion, for intent, for a thread of purpose that led out of the city and toward the falls.\n\nHe found it pinned to a cork bulletin board, a low-tech node of communication in a high-tech world. It was a simple, laser-printed flyer. At the top, in a bold font, it read: \u2018Pilgrimage to Palouse.\u2019 Tales drew near, his form so close to the cork he could see the individual fibers. The text announced a field trip to Palouse Falls State Park for the upcoming weekend. \u2018To collect soil and insect samples for the new J. Alistair Finch Memorial Archive.\u2019 It was an act of communal grieving, a scientific wake. A young man with kind eyes and a nervous energy was tacking a sign-up sheet below the flyer. As he smoothed the paper, Tales saw the name at the top of the list: \u2018Ben Carter (Organizer).\u2019 Ben Carter, a grad student continuing his mentor\u2019s work in the very place his mentor had died. Tales had found his ferryman. As Ben gathered his things to leave, a backpack filled with empty vials and data sheets, Tales braced himself. This would be a long journey, tethered to a single consciousness. It was a journey into the open country of another man\u2019s grief, and to the very edge of the cliff where it all began. He prepared to make the leap."

                                        "text": "The new stage was a glass cube, a miniature world of soil, moss, and tangled branches. Tonya had spent the afternoon constructing it, her movements as deliberate as a god designing a habitat. The frantic, two-inch drama of the ant was replaced by a slow, cold-blooded theatre of stillness. Inside the terrarium, the praying mantis, the *Hierodula*, waited. It was a creature of impossible angles, a living piece of origami crafted from jade and menace. Unlike the ant, it did not scurry or panic. It moved with a liquid, unnerving slowness, or held poses of absolute stillness for minutes at a time, its triangular head swiveling in smooth, intelligent arcs. It watched Tonya with its vast, composite eyes, and she felt not like an observer, but a participant in a silent, two-sided appraisal. This was not a subject to be dispatched with a simple, poisoned kiss. This was a presence, an entity. It demanded a different kind of respect, a more complex liturgy.\n\nThe tethering to Ben Carter was nothing like the chaotic surf of the city bus. It was a deep, quiet immersion. As Ben drove his dusty university pickup out of the city and into the rolling, dun-colored hills of the Palouse, Tales felt himself sink into the young man\u2019s consciousness. He did not see Ben\u2019s memories as a film, but he felt their emotional weight, their specific gravity. The primary, overwhelming sensation was a clean, aching sadness, a student\u2019s grief for a beloved mentor. It was a healthy, uncomplicated wound, worlds away from the septic, festering trauma that defined Tonya. Woven through the sadness were threads of earnest purpose and scientific curiosity. Ben was here to honor a man by continuing his work, a stark and painful contrast to Tonya, who honored him by meticulously destroying his favorite things.\n\nThe journey east was a disembodying experience for a being already without a body. The dense tapestry of human life that made up the city thinned out, leaving Tales feeling exposed and fragile. The truck moved through a vast, empty landscape of wheat fields that stretched to the horizon, a golden sea under a pale, endless sky. He felt the psychic vacuum of the open space, the lack of ambient life force to buffer his existence. His connection to Ben was his only anchor in the immensity of the world, a single, warm point in a great coldness. He clung to the grad student\u2019s focused grief, using it as a shield against the annihilating emptiness of the plains, a ghost hiding in the shadow of another man\u2019s sorrow.\n\nIn the spartan quiet of her apartment, Tonya performed a new part of the ritual. With the same delicate forceps she had used to pose the ant, she opened a small plastic container. A single, large cricket, black and glossy, scrambled inside. She had not fed the ants; they were soldiers taken from their endless war. This was different. This was a sacrifice to a different kind of god. With a steady hand, she introduced the cricket into the glass cube. For a long moment, nothing happened. The mantis remained a statue of green blades. The cricket, sensing danger, froze. Then, in a movement too swift for the human eye to properly track, one of the mantis\u2019s serrated forelegs shot out, a biological spring-trap. It seized the cricket, impaling it. Tonya watched, her breath held, as the mantis began to eat, its alien mouthparts working with a brutal, dispassionate efficiency. She was not horrified. She was studying. She was learning the mechanics of a predator, the cold geometry of its hunger.\n\nThe first sign of Palouse Falls was not a sight but a sound, a low, persistent roar that grew from a whisper on the edge of hearing to a deep, chest-vibrating thunder. As Ben Carter pulled the truck into the gravel lot of the state park, Tales felt the raw power of the place like a physical blow. It was a wound in the earth, a massive basalt canyon carved by ancient floods, with a waterfall plunging into its depths with relentless force. The air was cool and charged with mist, carrying the scent of wet rock and sage. This was not the gentle, intellectual beauty of an insect\u2019s wing or the chaotic pattern of burl wood. This was a landscape of violence and awe, a place where a man could feel both infinite and infinitesimal. Tales did not need to see the memorial plaque to know that this was a fitting place for a life to end.\n\nBen got out of the truck, his movements losing their academic briskness, becoming slow and heavy. He walked to the viewing rail at the canyon's edge, his hands gripping the cool metal pipe so tightly his knuckles shone white. He was no longer a scientist collecting samples; he was a mourner standing at a precipice that was both literal and metaphorical. He stared out, not at the waterfall itself, but to a section of the opposing cliff face, a sheer drop of dark, hexagonal rock formations. His memory, a sharp, stabbing image, bled through to Tales\u2019s perception: a flash of a wide-brimmed hat tumbling through the air, a fleeting, terrible silhouette against the sky. Tales felt the echo of the young man\u2019s panic, the helpless shout caught in his throat. This was the spot. The place where the world had broken. He was standing at ground zero of Tonya\u2019s pain.\n\nThe mantis, having consumed its offering, began to meticulously clean itself. It drew each spiked foreleg through its mandibles, a cat grooming itself after a meal, a murderer wiping his blade. Tonya watched, her face illuminated by the soft light of the terrarium. She had given it a name. She called it Alistair. It felt right. A tribute, not a mockery. The hulking Canon camera stood on its tripod in the corner of the room, its lens cap still on, a sleeping cyclops. There was no poison on the glass slide, no velvet block waiting. This was not an execution to be performed, but a relationship to be cultivated. The stillness in the room was no longer a vacuum of loss, but a space of shared presence. In the dim light, the woman and the insect were two perfect statues of patience, two predators locked in a silent understanding, each waiting for the precise, inevitable moment when the art would demand its consummation."

It was not a sound one simply heard; it was a force that vibrated in the rock, in the air, in the very structure of Ben Carter\u2019s bones. For Tales, it was a scouring static that threatened to overwhelm the delicate anchor of his host\u2019s consciousness. He held on, focusing on the specific, localized grief radiating from the young man, a small, warm signal in a tempest of white noise. Ben, after a long moment of silent communion with the abyss, shook himself and walked back to the truck. He returned not with recreational gear, but with the tools of his trade: a sturdy field case, a set of soil samplers, and an array of specimen jars. He was here to work. He was here to build a memorial out of data.\n\nHe began on a narrow, dusty trail that skirted the canyon\u2019s rim. With each step away from the main viewing area, the sounds of the few other tourists faded, swallowed by the waterfall\u2019s monolithic voice. Tales drifted alongside him, a silent partner on this pilgrimage. He saw the world through a dual lens: his own ghostly, detached observation, and the overlay of Ben\u2019s academic focus. Where Tales saw a scrubby bush, Ben\u2019s mind supplied the name, *Artemisia tridentata*, and noted the species of gall wasp that favored its stems. This was how Finch had seen the world, a landscape teeming with hidden languages and intricate, interlocking lives. It was a beautiful, complex vision, and Tales could feel the profound loss of it in the quiet diligence of his guide.\n\n* * *\n\nIn the artificial twilight of her apartment, Tonya\u2019s ritual had found a new rhythm. The frantic, condensed timeline of the ant\u2014the hunt, the capture, the swift execution\u2014was gone. This new phase was one of cohabitation. She sat at a small drawing table she had set up opposite the terrarium, a graphite pencil moving with slow precision across a sheet of heavy paper. She was not drawing the mantis. She was mapping it. She sketched the elegant, serrated curve of its raptorial foreleg, the exact angle of its head as it swiveled to watch her, the delicate, veined pattern of its wings. Each drawing was an anatomical study, an act of intense, unblinking observation. She was learning its architecture, its physical vocabulary.\n\nShe noted its habits. It favored a particular branch to hold its long, patient vigils. It groomed itself with an unnerving, humanoid deliberation. It ignored the water droplets she misted onto the glass, preferring to drink from the moisture collected on a moss-covered twig. These were not random behaviors; they were choices. Preferences. They were the nascent signs of a personality, a character she could distill. She was no longer a mere photographer of the dead. She was a biographer, and her subject, this silent, green predator named Alistair, was revealing its secrets to her one tiny, deliberate movement at a time. The thought of the aconitine, the violent, convulsive poison, now seemed brutish and clumsy. An insult. The art of this death would require a different science. It would have to be a quiet passage, a stillness descending upon a stillness, leaving the subject\u2019s final, perfect posture wholly intact.\n\n* * *\n\nThe trail dipped and wound its way along the basalt cliffs. Ben stopped at a point where the rock face sheered away, creating a natural alcove sheltered from the wind and mist. It was a quiet spot, a pocket of relative silence where the waterfall\u2019s roar was a background hum rather than an assault. Ben set down his case and knelt, his movements becoming reverent. Through the filter of his mind, Tales understood. This was one of J\u2019s spots. A place he would come to sit, to think, to observe the tiny, tenacious plants that clung to life in the cracks of the volcanic rock. Ben ran a hand over the cool stone, and a memory, vivid and complete, bloomed in his consciousness, pulling Tales into it like a tide.\n\nIt was from the week before the accident. Ben and Finch were sitting in this very spot, sharing a thermos of coffee. The sun was warm on the rocks. Finch was not talking about insects. He was quiet, his gaze fixed on the opposite wall of the canyon. \u201cLook at it, Ben,\u201d Finch had said, his voice softer than usual. \u201cPerfect hexagonal columns. A miracle of cooling basalt. Nature\u2019s geometry.\u201d He paused, taking a sip of coffee. \u201cAnd yet, it\u2019s not perfect, is it? Look there.\u201d He had pointed to a place where the pattern was broken, where a massive fissure fractured the neat columns. \u201cThat\u2019s the most interesting part. The flaw. The asymmetry. It\u2019s where the stress was greatest, where the change happened. People think symmetry is strength, but perfect symmetry is a kind of death. It\u2019s static. Life\u2026 life is asymmetrical.\u201d\n\nThe memory deepened, the emotional tone shifting from academic curiosity to a surprising, raw vulnerability. Finch had looked at Ben, his usual buoyant energy replaced by a deep-seated weariness. \u201cI\u2019ve spent my life studying the beautiful, logical systems of the hive, the swarm. Everything in its place. A perfect, functional whole.\u201d He gestured vaguely toward his own chest. \u201cBut my own life\u2026 so much\u2026 imbalance. Things I should have said. Roads not taken. It\u2019s all lopsided, Ben.\u201d He had forced a smile, but it didn\u2019t reach his kind eyes. \u201cOne day, you get to an age where you realize you can\u2019t go back and fix the symmetry. You\u2019re just left with the beautiful, crooked thing you\u2019ve built.\u201d\n\nThe memory faded, leaving behind the echo of that quiet confession and the sharp, present-day sting of Ben\u2019s grief. But for Tales, the words resonated with the force of a tectonic shift. *SymmetryForJ*. It wasn\u2019t a tribute to his passion for nature\u2019s perfection. It was an answer to his deepest, most personal regret. Tonya wasn\u2019t creating symmetrical art *for* J to appreciate. She was trying to create the symmetry *he felt he lacked*. She was trying to fix his life, to correct the 'beautiful, crooked thing' he\u2019d left behind. Her tiny, perfect corpses, posed in offering, were not just love letters. They were retroactive repairs. They were attempts to restore a spiritual balance, to posthumously grant a dying man\u2019s wish. And Tales felt a new, colder dread settle upon him. He had thought her grief might metastasize, that she might move from ants to a larger host. He was wrong. Her project was not about scale. It was about significance. And what could be more significant, more asymmetrical, more of a beautiful, crooked thing, than a human life?"

                                        "text": "The revelation settled in Tales not like a clarifying light, but like a plunge into icy water. It stole the air from his non-existent lungs and replaced it with a dreadful, crystalline certainty. *You\u2019re just left with the beautiful, crooked thing you\u2019ve built.* J\u2019s words, echoing through the filter of Ben Carter\u2019s memory, were the final, missing piece of the diagnostic puzzle. Tonya\u2019s meticulous murders were not an act of madness, but a terrible, misguided act of restorative surgery on a dead man\u2019s soul. She was trying to un-crook the thing he had built, to grant him in death the perfect symmetry he had confessed to lacking in life. The scale of her love, and the scale of her delusion, was breathtaking.\n\nBen packed his soil samples with a quiet reverence, each labeled vial a small act of faith, a continuation. He was preserving J\u2019s world, while Tonya was perfecting it through annihilation. The two students, the two apprentices, were engaged in the same project of remembrance, but working from opposite ends of creation. As Ben began the hike back toward the parking lot, the rhythmic crunch of his boots on the gravel trail felt to Tales like the ticking of a clock, each step bringing him closer to a city where a much more dangerous experiment was underway. He could no longer afford to be a passive observer, a diagnostician reviewing a cold case. He was a doctor on call, and his patient was bleeding out.\n\nIn her quiet, temperature-controlled room, Tonya had moved beyond simple reverence. She was now an acolyte in a temple of one. The terrarium containing Alistair was no longer a cage, but an altar, and she, its humble student. She had abandoned the camera, for now. Photography was the art of the finished moment, and this was a process. On a clean, white sheet of paper, she was rendering the mantis\u2019s foreleg, the one that had snatched the cricket from its brief existence. Her graphite pencil traced the rows of needle-sharp spines with anatomical precision. It was an instrument of shocking violence, but in its design, she saw a terrible, elegant logic. It was a tool perfectly suited to its purpose.\n\nHer own tools, she now realized, had been crude. The aconitine was a cataclysm, a neurological storm that tore through its victim. It was asymmetrical. It was messy. It was wrong. Her mission was to correct imbalance, not introduce more of it. A perfect death, a truly symmetrical offering, would be a death without struggle. A gentle subtraction. A cessation. Her fingers left the drawing and moved to her laptop. She did not search for poisons. Her search terms were clinical, sterile. *Anoxia. Inert gas hypoxia. Nitrogen displacement.* She read papers on humane methods of animal euthanasia, on the physiology of oxygen deprivation. The descriptions were of a quiet, painless fading, a gentle slide into unconsciousness from which there was no return. It was a death of profound stillness, a descent into perfect, metabolic equilibrium. It was the death a curator would choose. A poet\u2019s death, fitting for the lips of a creature named Alistair.\n\nThe drive back to Spokane was a long, silent meditation. Ben Carter steered the truck through the immense, undulating landscape, his mind replaying the day, the waterfall\u2019s roar, the weight of his mentor\u2019s last confession. The grief was not sharp anymore; it was a vast, heavy blanket. Tales felt the change in the psychic atmosphere. The frantic energy of the city was a distant memory, and Ben\u2019s mind, softened by sorrow and the hypnotic emptiness of the highway, was more pliable, more open than it had ever been. This was his chance. It was a desperate, long-shot procedure, but the only one he had. He marshaled the entirety of his focus, the full force of his disembodied will, and aimed it at the quiet, grieving man behind the wheel.\n\nHe didn't try to push a sentence or a command. It would be like trying to scream a paragraph through a keyhole. He had to be a catalyst, not an author. He focused on a single, resonant word, a word that now held the key to the entire pathology: *Symmetry*. He pushed the concept, the shape of it, the feeling of it, into the quiet spaces of Ben\u2019s thoughts. He poured all of his urgency and fear into that one, perfect, balanced word. For a long moment, nothing happened. Then, Ben blinked, his brow furrowing slightly. He shook his head, a subtle, almost imperceptible motion. \"Symmetry,\" he murmured aloud to the empty cab, the word sounding strange and out of place. He frowned, trying to catch the thread of the thought. *Dr. Finch\u2026 he was talking about symmetry\u2026 the diatoms\u2026* The memory of a lecture slide showing the hypnotic, geometric beauty of microscopic algae flashed through his mind. It was close, but it wasn't the connection Tales needed.\n\nUndeterred, Tales pushed again, harder this time, the effort leaving him feeling thin and transparent, as if he were being stretched to the point of tearing. He added the second element, the catalyst for it all. *J*. The letter, the initial, the man. *Symmetry. J.* The two concepts hammered at the edge of Ben's consciousness. Ben\u2019s hand, resting on the steering wheel, tightened. A new thought surfaced, unbidden. A username he\u2019d seen somewhere. A comment on a forum? A student\u2019s online gallery? It was a flicker at the edge of his memory, an annoying, half-recalled bit of digital detritus. *SymmetryForJ*. The name came to him whole. He didn\u2019t know where he\u2019d seen it or what it meant, but it snagged in his mind like a burr, an insistent, illogical conjunction of a scientific principle and a person. He shook his head again, more forcefully this time, dismissing it as a weird artifact of a long, emotional day. But the seed was planted. It was a foreign body, an anomaly in the clean data of his thoughts, and Ben Carter was a scientist. And scientists, above all else, were trained to investigate anomalies. Tales, exhausted and frayed, held on, knowing he had done all he could. He had turned the detective into a piece of evidence, and now he could only wait for him to be discovered."

                                        "text": "The return to the city felt like a slow re-entry into a fever dream. The vast, elemental silence of the Palouse was replaced by the complex, layered hum of Spokane, a noise that felt dissonant and frantic to Tales after the clean roar of the falls. He remained a silent passenger in Ben Carter\u2019s life, a ghost haunting the passenger seat of a dusty pickup truck, his existence a fragile state of sustained observation. The seed he had planted in the young man\u2019s mind, the anomalous phrase *SymmetryForJ*, was a silent, ticking bomb, and Tales could only watch and wait for it to detonate in the quiet, orderly landscape of Ben\u2019s scientific mind.\n\nBack in the sterile confines of the entomology lab, Ben tried to lose himself in the familiar rituals of his work. He carefully transferred the soil samples from Palouse Falls into labeled petri dishes, preparing them for microscopic analysis. This was the work of continuation, the slow, methodical process of understanding a legacy. But the process was contaminated. The phrase kept surfacing, a piece of nonsensical data that defied categorization. *SymmetryForJ*. It felt like a song lyric stuck in his head, but without a tune. He\u2019d try to focus on the delicate structure of a beetle\u2019s antenna under the microscope, and the word \u2018symmetry\u2019 would assert itself, pulling his thoughts back to the strange, sad confession of his mentor on the cliff\u2019s edge, and the inexplicable username that seemed to echo it.\n\nWhile Ben struggled with the ghost of a thought, Tonya engaged with the logistics of a physical one. Her research phase was complete. The method had been chosen. Now came the acquisition of tools. On a clean sheet of paper, she made a list, her handwriting as precise and unadorned as a chemical formula. *Nitrogen Cylinder, CGA-580 Regulator, Low-Flow Meter, Silicone Tubing, Weather-strip Sealant.* It was the inventory of an engineer or a lab technician, not an artist. She spent an hour online, comparing specifications for gas regulators, ensuring the flow meter could be calibrated to a rate so slow it would be imperceptible. She was designing a system not to create something, but to create a perfect and gentle nothing. Her movements were calm, her focus absolute. She was building the chamber for her final, most meaningful act of curation.\n\nThe internal anomaly became an unbearable distraction for Ben. He pushed back from the microscope, rubbing his tired eyes. He couldn't work like this. The phrase was a burr, a point of intellectual irritation that demanded to be resolved. Rationalizing it as a necessary step to clear his mind and regain his focus, he turned to his lab computer, the glow of the monitor illuminating his troubled face. He opened a web browser, his fingers hovering over the keyboard for a moment. It felt foolish, like chasing a ghost, but the scientific imperative to investigate the unexplained was stronger than his sense of absurdity. With a sigh of resignation, he typed the fourteen characters into the search bar, the words appearing stark and alien on the screen: *SymmetryForJ*. He pressed enter.\n\nFor a moment, there was nothing but a list of obscure academic articles on bilateral symmetry and a handful of forum posts using the letter 'J'. Then, at the top of the image results, a single, compelling thumbnail. A macro photograph of an ant, its body a glossy obsidian black, set against a background of pure white. Curious, Ben clicked it. He found himself on a photostream, a sleek, minimalist gallery. The username was the phrase that haunted him. He scrolled down. There were dozens of images, all macro shots of insects, primarily ants. The technical skill was undeniable. The lighting was dramatic, the focus impossibly sharp. A fellow entomology enthusiast, he thought at first, or perhaps a student from the art department. But as he looked closer, the initial admiration curdled into a deep and profound unease.\n\nTales watched over Ben\u2019s shoulder, a phantom of pure, focused anxiety. He saw the page load, saw the gallery of Tonya\u2019s macabre work fill the screen. He watched Ben\u2019s expression shift, the clinical curiosity of a scientist morphing into the confused frown of a puzzle-solver, and then, finally, hardening into a mask of dawning horror. Ben clicked on 'Red Word', the image of the *Formica rufa* soldier. He zoomed in, his training allowing him to see what a casual observer would miss. The posture was not natural. It was not the rigor of death; it was the deliberate pose of an offering. The mandibles were parted just so, a gesture of shocking, artificial intimacy. He scrolled to another, an earlier, clumsier kill with a barely visible fracture in the thorax. He scrolled back to the newest ones, noting the flawless carapaces. He was seeing a progression. A refinement of technique. And then his eyes fell on the name of the photostream, the name that had been a meaningless string of characters a moment before, and it all coalesced with sickening clarity. Symmetry. For. J. For J. Alistair Finch. This wasn't a photography project. This was a shrine. This was a graveyard.\n\nIn her apartment, the final piece of the apparatus was secured. After a brief, professional-sounding phone call to a local welding supply depot, a delivery was scheduled for the following afternoon. A small, high-pressure cylinder of pure nitrogen, the kind used for inerting wine barrels or purging lab equipment, would be left at her doorstep. Tonya felt no thrill, no dark excitement. She felt only a quiet, profound sense of rightness, the calm of a surgeon whose operating theater was finally prepared. She stood before the glass terrarium, her gaze meeting the unblinking, composite eyes of the mantis. \"Soon,\" she whispered to it, her voice a soft tide in the still air. \"Soon, you will be perfect.\""

                                        "text": "The initial shock was a physical blow, forcing Ben back in his chair as if he\u2019d touched a live wire. The sterile, ordered world of the lab, a place of reason and measurable reality, seemed to tilt on its axis. He stared at the screen, at the gallery of tiny, perfect deaths, and felt a nausea that had nothing to do with biology. It was the sight of a beautiful, precise methodology\u2014his methodology, the discipline he had dedicated his life to\u2014twisted into an object of morbid worship. The meticulous lighting, the flawless focus, the reverent composition; it was all the language of science, but it was spelling out a word of profound and terrifying madness. This was a disease expressing itself through art.\n\nHe forced himself to breathe, to push past the horror and think like the scientist he was. Data. He needed more data. He scrolled back through the gallery, his eye no longer that of a stunned layman but of a forensic analyst. He ignored the newer, more perfect specimens and sought the older ones, the mistakes. A crushed antenna here, a slightly smudged background there. He was looking at a learning curve, the refinement of a dark craft. Then he returned to the most recent photograph, \u2018Red Word.\u2019 He zoomed in on the background, the stage for the tiny corpse. The chaotic, swirling grain of the wood. It was oak burl. A cold dread, sharp and specific, pricked at the base of his skull. He remembered Dr. Finch returning from a weekend market, triumphantly holding a round cheese board made of the exact same wood. \u2018The most beautiful patterns come from the most damaged trees, Ben,\u2019 he\u2019d said, his voice full of that infectious wonder. \u2018It\u2019s a map of a storm.\u2019 This artist hadn't just admired J. They had been in his home. They had handled his things.\n\nThe next afternoon, a plain white van with no company logo pulled up to the curb outside Tonya\u2019s apartment building. The driver, a man in a simple work uniform, wheeled a tall, grey cylinder of compressed gas on a dolly up to her door. It was heavy, and the dolly\u2019s wheels bumped noisily up the single step. The transaction was brief and impersonal. A signature on a digital screen, a curt nod. Then the driver was gone, leaving the object standing on her doorstep like a solemn, metallic sentinel. Tonya opened the door and regarded it not as a tank of gas, but as an instrument of peace. She maneuvered it inside with a surprising strength born of pure focus, its weight a grounding, reassuring presence. She rolled it into the spare bedroom, the sanctuary, and placed it in the corner. It was a monolith of potential stillness, the final, crucial component for the apparatus of her love\u2019s most perfect expression. The room was now complete.\n\nIn the lab, the name haunted him: T. Vance. Tonya Vance. The memory was hazy at first, a face at the periphery of his time in the department. She hadn't been a fellow graduate student, but a lab assistant, hired by Finch to help reorganize the university\u2019s massive, chaotic teaching collection. She was quiet, almost unnervingly so, and possessed a preternatural patience. Ben recalled seeing her hunched over a tray of dusty, hundred-year-old scarab beetles, her hands moving with the inhuman steadiness of a machine as she repaired their fragile legs with microscopic dabs of adhesive. She hadn't just done the work; she had revered it. And her devotion to Dr. Finch had been absolute, a silent, intense admiration that sometimes made the other students uncomfortable. She had left the position abruptly about a year ago, not long after Finch\u2019s accident. No one had heard from her since.\n\nTales watched, a silent tempest of frustration and hope, as Ben pieced it all together. The young man was staring at the memorial page, at the bland, professional comment from T. Vance, but his mind was elsewhere, connecting the quiet lab assistant to the burl wood, to the obsession with curation, to the terrible, secret meaning of symmetry. The ghost of J. Alistair Finch had unknowingly left behind two apprentices. One who studied his work, and one who studied his soul. Tales poured what was left of his energy into a final, desperate push, not a word this time, but a feeling: *Urgency*. A sense of a clock ticking down, of a ceremony about to begin.\n\nThe final connection snapped into place with the force of a physical impact. Ben shot to his feet, knocking his chair over with a loud clatter that echoed in the silent lab. Tonya Vance. The quiet girl who had loved the collection, who had worshipped the curator. The one person who might have twisted Finch\u2019s casual, philosophical musings on asymmetry into a sacred, terrible mission. This wasn\u2019t a mystery anymore; it was a countdown. He had no evidence that would make sense to anyone else, nothing but a series of cryptic photographs and a chain of inferences that sounded like madness. But he knew, with a certainty that chilled him to the bone, that somewhere in the city, Tonya Vance was preparing her next exhibit. And he was terrifyingly sure that this time, the specimen wouldn't be an ant. He didn't have a plan. He didn't have proof. All he had was a name, an address he could probably find in an old university directory, and the horrifying image of a dead mantis in his mind. He grabbed his keys and ran, a man of science surrendering to a desperate, primal instinct to intervene, to stop the art before it was finished."

                                        "text": "### Chapter 6\n\nThe clatter of the falling chair was a gunshot in the tomb-like silence of the lab. It was a sound of chaos, of a system breaking, and it propelled Ben Carter out of the room and into the hallway, his lab coat flapping behind him like the useless wings of a flightless bird. He was no longer a scientist; he was an antibody rushing toward an infection. Tales, dragged along in the turbulent wake of his host\u2019s panic, felt the abrupt shift. The quiet, contemplative grief he had been anchored to was gone, replaced by a roaring, adrenalized fear that was so powerful it felt like a physical force, threatening to shred his own tenuous hold on consciousness. He was a passenger in a runaway car, and the man at the wheel was driving blind.\n\nBen\u2019s destination was not the street, not yet. He skidded to a halt outside the departmental administrative office, a small, cluttered room presided over by a woman whose tenure predated most of the professors. He burst through the door, his wild-eyed appearance earning him a startled look over a pair of reading glasses. He didn\u2019t have time for pleasantries. He needed the old records, the archives of non-faculty employees from before the university had fully digitized its systems. It was a desperate, illogical lurch into the past, fueled by the certainty that Tonya Vance would be a ghost in the current digital machine. He was looking for a paper trail, an old address from an initial hiring form, anything.\n\nWhile Ben frantically explained his need to a skeptical administrator, Tonya was engaged in a silent, methodical ballet of engineering. She had rolled the cool, grey nitrogen cylinder into position beside the glass cube that served as her altar. Her gloved fingers, moving with the unthinking grace of a bomb disposal expert, threaded the brass regulator onto the cylinder\u2019s valve. She tightened it with a wrench, not with brute force, but with a precise application of torque, feeling for the exact point where the metal sealed. There was a brief, sharp hiss as the high-pressure system was charged, a sound she registered with a deep and abiding satisfaction. It was the sound of potential being brought to bear. She attached the clear silicone tubing to the regulator\u2019s outflow, its other end ready. Her movements were fluid, unhurried, each action a prayer.\n\nTales felt a splitting of his perception, a new and agonizing development in his condition. Tethered to Ben in the brightly lit, bureaucratic office, he could feel the young man\u2019s frantic impatience, the maddeningly slow pace of the administrator searching through dusty file cabinets. But his focus, his dread, his entire being was with Tonya. He could see her in his mind\u2019s eye as clearly as if he were standing in the room, watching her connect the apparatus of a perfect, silent death. He was in two places at once, a ghost stretched across the city, his consciousness a bridge between the frantic effort to save a life and the serene, unstoppable process of taking one. The strain was immense. He felt as if he were being torn in two.\n\nAn hour, an eternity, passed before the administrator surfaced from the archives with a single, yellowing sheet of paper. A personnel file from three years ago. And on it, an address. A non-descript apartment building on the north side of the river. Ben snatched the paper with a mumbled thanks that was lost as he was already turning, already running back down the hall. The drive across town was a blur of near-misses and blaring horns. Ben\u2019s knuckles were white on the steering wheel, his jaw clenched. He was a man of quiet labs and patient observation, and the violence of his own haste was a foreign country. Tales, trapped in the passenger seat, could do nothing but watch the city flash past, his own impotence a screaming void. He couldn\u2019t tell Ben that the light was about to change, couldn't warn him about the car pulling out of a blind alley. He was a navigator with no voice, a prophet with no tongue, watching the world through the eyes of a man racing toward a tragedy he had helped to set in motion.\n\nTonya sealed the terrarium. She had applied a thin, even bead of clear silicone sealant around the lid, making the glass cube airtight. Inside, the world was now a closed system. The moss, the twigs, the soil, and the single, magnificent occupant were isolated, a pocket universe ready for its final transformation. Alistair, the mantis, stood poised on its favorite branch, its head cocked, watching her with an intelligence that felt ancient and profound. Tonya placed her hand on the glass, her palm flat against the cool surface, a gesture of farewell and consummation. She felt no sadness, no remorse. She felt only the solemn, cleansing peace of a purpose about to be fulfilled. She turned to the nitrogen cylinder. Her hand rested on the small, green knob of the regulator. It was time. With a slow, steady motion, she began to turn it. There was no sound, no rush of air. The low-flow meter, calibrated with painstaking care, barely registered the movement. A gentle, invisible, and utterly final tide had begun to wash into the tiny world, a silent, nitrogenous sea that would slowly, peacefully, displace the air, carrying her beloved Alistair away on its current.\n\nThe apartment building was a shabby, three-story brick box, anonymous and weary. Ben found the address, number 2B, and took the stairs two at a time, his footsteps echoing in the narrow, linoleum-floored stairwell. He found the door, a slab of cheap wood painted an indeterminate shade of beige, a small brass \u20182B\u2019 tacked to its center. He stopped, his chest heaving, his mind a sudden, paralyzing blank. What now? He pressed his ear to the wood, expecting to hear\u2026 something. Music. A television. Movement. He heard nothing. The silence from the other side was absolute, a dead, sound-absorbing stillness that was more terrifying than any scream. He was a scientist, a man of evidence and protocol, and he had nothing. He had a theory, a terrifying, insane theory built on a username and a piece of wood. He raised his hand, his knuckles hovering an inch from the door. He could knock. He could call the police and try to explain the unexplainable. Or he could break it down. And in the profound, terrible silence from within, DI Tales, screaming his voiceless plea, knew that every second he hesitated, the tide of pure nitrogen was rising."

                                        "text": "The silence was the answer. It was not an empty silence; it was a curated one, as deliberate and precise as one of her photographs. It was the sound of a vacuum being created, the sound of air being meticulously removed. In that profound, unnatural stillness, Ben Carter\u2019s scientific skepticism was burned away, leaving only the raw, animal instinct to intervene. Protocol was a luxury for a world that made sense. This world did not. He threw his shoulder against the door. The impact was a shock of brute force, a language his body had forgotten how to speak. Wood splintered, a sound of tearing violence in the dead quiet of the hallway. The frame groaned in protest. He recoiled, his shoulder screaming, and threw himself against it again. This time, the lock gave way with a sickening crack, and the door flew inward, slamming against the wall.\n\nHe stumbled into the apartment, his breath coming in ragged, painful gasps. The space was shockingly neat, almost sterile. A single sofa, a small, empty dining table. There were no pictures on the walls, no clutter on the surfaces. It was a holding area, a place of transit, not a home. The air was cool and still. A single shaft of light emanated from an open doorway at the end of a short hall, a silent invitation into the heart of the anomaly. He followed it, his footsteps loud and clumsy on the clean floor, a barbarian crashing a tea ceremony. He was acutely aware of his own frantic, messy presence, a contaminant in this hermetically sealed environment.\n\nHe reached the doorway and froze. The room was a laboratory, a studio, a temple. In the center, on a simple black stand, sat the glass terrarium, glowing under the unforgiving glare of an articulated lamp. Beside it, like a piece of arcane medical equipment, stood the grey nitrogen cylinder, its regulator and tubing a network of veins feeding the glass box. On the wall were the drawings, anatomical studies of the mantis, rendered with the obsessive precision of a renaissance master. And standing before it all was Tonya. She turned, not with the start of a surprised victim, but with the slow, deliberate grace of a high priestess whose prayers had been interrupted. Her face, serene and immobile, showed no fear, only a profound, glacial annoyance. She was not a killer caught in the act; she was an artist whose masterpiece had just been smudged by a clumsy hand.\n\n\"Ben,\" she said, and her voice was as calm and cool as the air in the room. There was no inflection, no surprise. It was a simple statement of fact, the identification of a variable that had just entered her controlled experiment. Ben, panting, wild-eyed, could only gesture, his hand trembling as he pointed a finger at the terrarium, at the cylinder. The words came out in a strangled gasp, devoid of the coherence he valued above all else. \"Tonya\u2026 what are you doing? The gas\u2026 what is this?\" He was pointing at the evidence, but he was prosecuting the wrong crime. He was afraid of what she might do to a person, blind to the quiet atrocity happening right in front of him.\n\n\"I'm providing a stillness,\" Tonya replied, her gaze shifting from his frantic face back to the glass cube with a look of deep, maternal concern. \"Dr. Finch\u2026 he felt his life was unbalanced. Asymmetrical. This\u2026 this is a correction. A perfect, symmetrical end. No struggle, no pain. Just a gentle fading. It's a gift.\" She spoke of death as if it were a state of aesthetic grace, the final, perfect pose. The gulf between her reality and his was an uncrossable chasm, and they stood on opposite sides, shouting at each other in languages the other could not comprehend.\n\nTales, who had been violently flung into the room with Ben, felt a dizzying, nauseating relief mixed with absolute terror. He was here. He was at the site of the procedure. He could see everything. He saw the almost imperceptible flutter of the needle on the flow meter. He saw the mantis inside the glass, its alien head swiveling, but its movements were slower now, more sluggish, its usual sharp, predatory angles softened by a creeping lethargy. The silent tide was already halfway up the shore. Tonya was explaining her theology of death, and Ben was trying to argue with a ghost story, and all the while, the beautiful, terrible creature was quietly, peacefully, drowning in the air itself. The art was almost finished."

                                        "text": "The words struck Ben with the force of a physical blow, but it was Tales who understood their full, devastating import. Through the maelstrom of Ben\u2019s panic, he could see the scene with the cold, diagnostic clarity of a physician watching a slow-acting poison take hold. The victim was not some future, hypothetical human, but the magnificent, dying creature in the glass box. The mantis\u2019s movements, once sharp and deliberate, were now thick and syrupy, its head drooping as if the delicate stalk of its neck could no longer support the weight. The air inside the terrarium, once a life-sustaining medium, was becoming a tomb, and Tonya was its serene, loving architect. Tales screamed, a silent, spectral howl of pure frustration, trying to force Ben to see what was right in front of him, to look past the abstract horror of Tonya\u2019s philosophy and see the concrete, immediate fact of a life being gently, methodically, extinguished.\n\nBen barely heard her explanation. The name \u2018Dr. Finch\u2019 on her lips was a profanity. He looked at her placid, beatific expression and saw not madness, but a monstrous act of intellectual theft. She had taken J\u2019s beautiful, complex ideas about the flaws that create character, the asymmetry that defines life, and twisted them into this grotesque, nihilistic pursuit of a perfect, sterile end. She wasn't honoring him; she was erasing him, replacing his nuanced, vibrant philosophy with a child's simplistic notion of balance. A hot, protective anger, an emotion he had not felt since the day he\u2019d heard of the accident, surged through him, eclipsing his fear. This woman was not just a threat; she was a heretic, and he was the last true keeper of the faith.\n\n\"You're wrong,\" he snarled, the words tearing from his throat, raw and full of a sudden, righteous fury. \"He loved the imperfection. The crookedness. That's what you don't understand!\" But he knew, even as he said it, that he was trying to reason with a tidal wave. Words were useless. Action was the only language left. He lunged, not at her, but past her, his target the apparatus itself. His hand, accustomed to the delicate work of forceps and microscope dials, reached for the brass regulator, a clumsy, desperate grab for the control valve of this terrible machine. Tonya moved to intercept him, her stillness exploding into a surprising, wiry strength. She did not try to hurt him. Her body became a shield, a living barrier between his chaotic intervention and the sanctity of her creation.\n\nHer hands clamped onto his arm, her grip shockingly firm. \"Don't,\" she hissed, her serenity finally cracking to reveal the granite core of her conviction. \"You're ruining it. It has to be perfect.\" As they struggled, their bodies locked in a clumsy, desperate embrace, Tales threw the last vestiges of his will into Ben's reaching hand. He focused on the small, green knob of the valve, pouring his disembodied energy, his memory of life, his rage at this senseless death, into a single, kinetic impulse. *Turn!* he screamed into the psychic void. Ben, driven by his own adrenaline, felt a surge of strength, an inexplicable certainty in his movement. His fingers found purchase on the knob, the cold, knurled metal a point of absolute reality in the chaos.\n\nWith a final, desperate heave, Ben twisted his body, using his weight to wrench free from her grasp. He slammed his hand against the valve, turning it violently, far past the point of closure. The hiss of the gas ceased. He didn't stop. He ripped the silicone tube from its fitting, the plastic tearing away with a soft pop. The silence that followed was absolute, a heavy, suffocating blanket. In the struggle, the terrarium had been jostled, its contents disturbed. Tonya stared at the disconnected tube in Ben's hand, at the violated sanctity of her altar, and a look of profound, hollow devastation washed over her face. Her perfect moment, her sacred art, was corrupted. Broken. Asymmetrical.\n\nBen stood panting, his whole body trembling, the torn tube dangling from his fingers like a dead snake. He had won, but the victory tasted like ash. He had stopped the procedure, but he had shattered the priestess. He lowered his gaze to the glass cube. Tonya, her face a mask of utter desolation, looked with him. Inside, on the disturbed soil, Alistair lay on its side. For a long, terrible moment, it was still. Then, one of its delicate, thread-like antennae twitched, a faint, almost imperceptible tremor. A sign of life. A sign of imperfection. The two of them, the heretic and the true believer, stood frozen in the wreckage of their collision, their shared gaze fixed on the tiny, terrible miracle of a life that had refused, against all odds, to become perfect."

It was a flicker of stubborn, asymmetrical life, a tiny, defiant pulse in a room that had been consecrated for a perfect and final stillness. For Ben, it was a gasp of air after being held underwater, a wave of relief so profound it left him weak-kneed and dizzy. For Tonya, it was a crack running through a flawless diamond, a stain on a sacred text. It was the mark of her failure. A low sound escaped her, a guttural syllable of pure, animal grief that had nothing to do with anger and everything to do with loss. Her face, for the first time, lost its serene immobility and crumpled, her body seeming to fold in on itself. She sank to her knees on the floor, her gaze fixed on the imperfect, living creature, her hands limp at her sides. The high priestess had been deposed, her altar desecrated, her god denied its sacrifice.\n\nBen\u2019s righteous fury evaporated, replaced by a bewildering, vertiginous pity. The monster he had come to slay was now a kneeling, broken woman, weeping without tears for the death that had failed to occur. He took a half-step toward her, an instinctive gesture of comfort, before freezing, his hand outstretched in the empty air. What could he possibly say? His own reality, the one of data and logic and observable phenomena, had no vocabulary for this kind of sorrow. He was a biologist, and he had just witnessed a soul fracture. He looked from her collapsed form to the broken door, to the cylinder of inert gas, to the trembling mantis, and felt the full, crushing weight of his intrusion. He had not simply averted a crisis; he had shattered a world.\n\nFrom his vantage point of pure observation, Tales felt the last of his spectral energy drain away, leaving a strange, hollow calm. He had done it. He had, through a chain of ghostly nudges and desperate, focused intentions, physically altered the course of events. He had saved a life, albeit a very small one. The relief was a clean, cool wave washing over his frayed consciousness. But as he watched Ben stand paralyzed and Tonya kneel in silent, abject misery, he understood that he had only changed the diagnosis, not cured the disease. He had stopped the fatal hemorrhage, but the patient was still on the table, her psyche a landscape of fresh, gaping wounds. He was no longer a detective; he was an accessory to a necessary act of emotional violence, and now, like Ben, he was a helpless witness to the aftermath.\n\n\u201cIt was almost\u2026 perfect,\u201d Tonya whispered to the floor, her voice a reedy thread of sound. \u201cIt was almost whole.\u201d She wasn\u2019t speaking to Ben; she was delivering a eulogy for a failed ritual. Ben finally found his voice, though it came out hoarse and uncertain. \u201cTonya\u2026 it\u2019s alive. That\u2019s what matters. It\u2019s alive.\u201d He spoke the words as a fundamental truth, a bedrock principle of his entire worldview. To him, they were a statement of victory and hope. Tonya slowly lifted her head, her eyes, dark and cavernous with a grief he couldn\u2019t begin to comprehend, fixed on his. \u201cNo,\u201d she said, her voice flat and dead. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand. Now it\u2019s just\u2026 damaged.\u201d In her world, the messy, twitching fact of survival was an uglier fate than the perfect, symmetrical stillness she had so meticulously prepared.\n\nThe chasm between them was absolute. They stood in the wreckage, two survivors of a catastrophe, speaking different languages, mourning different losses. Ben saw a life saved; she saw a prayer ruined. He saw a return to the beautiful, crooked imperfection that J. Alistair Finch had cherished; she saw a final, damning confirmation of the asymmetry he had lamented. The living mantis was not a symbol of hope. It was a monument to her failure to give the man she loved the one thing she believed he had wanted most: a final, corrected peace. The room was no longer a temple; it was just a broken laboratory, and they were just two people, lost in the quiet hum of a refrigerator in the other room, trapped with the terrible, unintended consequences of their convictions."

                                        "text": "The silence in the room stretched, thin and brittle. It was no longer a sacred silence, but the awkward, hollow quiet that follows a terrible argument. Ben stood, his breath still ragged, caught in the gravitational pull of Tonya\u2019s collapsed form. His scientific mind, trained to categorize and explain, struggled to file what he was seeing. This wasn't criminality; it was a kind of spiritual necrosis. She was not a monster; she was a system in catastrophic failure, a mind that had followed its own flawless, internal logic to a place far beyond the borders of shared reality. The quiet hum of the refrigerator from the other room, the distant wail of a passing siren\u2014the mundane sounds of the world began to seep back in, rendering the scene not just tragic, but absurd.\n\nHe took a slow, deliberate step forward, his boot scuffing softly on the floor. His first rational thought was to dismantle the stage, to turn off the lights and end the performance. He reached out and, with a decisive click, switched off the articulated lamp. The harsh, interrogating glare vanished, plunging the terrarium and Tonya\u2019s kneeling form into the soft, diffuse grey of the late afternoon. The room became less of an operating theater and more of a dimly lit tomb. It was a small act, but it was an attempt to change the context, to bring her back from the world of perfect, abstract symbols to the messy, poorly-lit reality of a second-floor apartment with a broken door.\n\nThe sudden twilight seemed to break Tonya\u2019s trance. She stirred, not looking at him, but at the darkened glass of the terrarium. \"You've trapped it,\" she said, her voice a monotone whisper, yet carrying a current of cold, accusatory venom. \"It was going to be free. Free of its body, of its hunger, of the struggle. It was going to be an idea. A perfect, final word. Now\u2026 it's just an insect again. A thing that eats and defecates and dies messily. You didn't save it. You condemned it to life.\" Her logic was a perfect, terrifying inversion of his own. She saw his act of salvation as one of profound cruelty, a sentence to the very imperfection she was trying to transcend on J\u2019s behalf.\n\nTales watched the exchange, a silent spectator at a dialogue of the deaf. He had seen the world in terms of diagnosis and treatment, but this was a pathology of the soul that resisted all medicine. He had successfully prevented a death, but in doing so, he had destroyed a religion. Tonya\u2019s grief was not a wound to be sutured; it was a carefully constructed architecture, and Ben had just sledgehammered its cornerstone. For the first time since his own death, Tales felt a new and more profound impotence. It was not the inability to touch or speak, but the inability to translate. He could see both of their worlds with perfect clarity, could understand the unassailable logic of each, and he knew with absolute certainty that there was no bridge that could ever connect them.\n\nJust then, a sharp, hesitant knock came at the broken door. \"Hello? Is everything alright in there? I heard a crash.\" A woman's voice, laced with nervous concern. The outside world, with its simple rules and nosy neighbors, had arrived. Ben froze, a deer in the headlights. The entire, insane tableau\u2014the kneeling woman, the gas cylinder, the praying mantis in its glass prison\u2014flashed before his eyes. He was standing in a stranger\u2019s apartment with a door he had just broken down. The truth was impossible. He had to lie. He moved quickly, stepping out of the room and partially closing the bedroom door behind him, shielding the scene from view. He pulled the main apartment door as closed as its splintered frame would allow and spoke through the crack. \"It's fine! Sorry! I\u2026 I tripped, fell against the door. A bit clumsy. Everything's fine, thank you for checking.\" He held his breath, praying his voice sounded more convincing than it felt.\n\nAfter a skeptical pause, the neighbor\u2019s footsteps retreated down the hall. The immediate threat was gone, but its presence had changed the dynamic completely. Ben was no longer just an intervener; he was a co-conspirator, a guardian of a terrible secret. He was now responsible for her, tethered to her by the lie he had just told. He turned back toward the dim bedroom, the silence within now heavier than before. He pushed the door open to see Tonya in the same position, a statue of grief in the gloom. His gaze fell upon the terrarium. Inside, the mantis, with a slow, Herculean effort that seemed to take an eternity, had managed to get its legs back under it. It stood unsteadily, its body swaying, a living, breathing monument to the ugly, difficult, and beautiful business of survival. The art was ruined, but the subject, against its artist\u2019s will, was beginning to live again."

                                        "text": "The lie hung in the air between them, a flimsy, makeshift patch over a gaping hole. Ben turned back from the door, his heart hammering a frantic, panicked rhythm against his ribs. The brief, mundane interaction with the outside world had irrevocably changed the nature of the crisis. He was no longer a rescuer; he was a hostage, trapped not by Tonya, but by the sheer, unexplainable reality of the situation. He couldn't call the police. He couldn't walk away. He was tethered to this quiet, grieving woman and the terrible, sacred secret contained in her spare bedroom. He felt the phantom chill of implication, the cold understanding that by breaking down her door, he had crossed a threshold and entered her story, and he could not leave until it was finished.\n\nHe stepped fully back into the dim room, the door clicking softly shut behind him. Tonya hadn\u2019t moved. She was still a cairn of sorrow on the floor, her focus entirely on the glass box. Ben\u2019s gaze followed hers. The mantis, Alistair, was slowly, painstakingly, righting itself. Each movement was a tiny, monumental effort, a testament to the stubborn, unthinking imperative of living tissue. It was ugly and clumsy and miraculous. It was everything Tonya\u2019s art was designed to erase. He understood, then, that leaving the mantis here would be an act of ongoing torture for her, a living, breathing symbol of her profound failure. He had to dismantle the altar. He had to remove the object of worship.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m taking it, Tonya,\u201d he said, his voice quiet but firm, stripped of its earlier panic. It was the tone he used in the lab when explaining a difficult but necessary procedure. He moved toward the stand, his hands reaching for the terrarium. A flicker of movement from the floor. Tonya rose, not with the explosive energy of before, but with a weary, boneless fluidity. She placed herself between him and the glass box, not as a guard, but as a final, futile supplicant. \u201cYou can\u2019t,\u201d she said, her voice hollow. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 mine. The failure is mine. I have to see it.\u201d She needed to watch it live, to study her mistake, to absorb the full measure of its imperfection. To Ben, it sounded like a vow of self-flagellation.\n\nIt was in that moment of impossible stalemate that Tales felt the change. He was still anchored to Ben, but the intense, singular focus of the chase and the confrontation had faded, leaving behind the shared, oppressive atmosphere of the room. He felt the quiet thrum of two exhausted heartbeats, the faint, chemical scent of the silicone sealant, the cool draft from the broken door. And he felt something else. A subtle loosening. The tether that had bound him so tightly to Ben\u2019s consciousness, the one he had clung to for miles, was becoming frayed. His own independent sense of self, which had been subsumed by the rush of events, was beginning to reassert itself. He was no longer just a passenger. He was a separate entity again, a silent third party in a room of two, and the strain of maintaining his connection across the city was beginning to tell. The safe, dead quiet of the South Lincoln Street library began to hum at the very edge of his perception, a distant, gravitational pull calling him home.\n\nHe fought against it, a silent, desperate struggle to hold his place. He had to see this through. He had to know what would happen next. He focused on Ben, on the warmth of his living body, the frantic but vital energy of his mind. But the pull was inexorable, a slow, cosmic tide. The edges of the room began to blur, the solid forms of Ben and Tonya shimmering as if seen through heat haze. Their voices grew distant, the sharp edges of their conflict softening into a remote murmur. He was losing his grip, his consciousness being stretched thin across an impossible distance. He was a ghost being exorcised by sheer psychic exhaustion. The last thing he saw before the world dissolved into a rush of grey static was Ben Carter, his face a mask of resolute pity, gently taking Tonya Vance by the arm, and the living, imperfect mantis in its glass prison, twitching its antennae as if testing the quality of the air, tasting the bitter, complicated reality of its own survival."

                                        "text": "Ben\u2019s touch was gentle, the careful hold of a man accustomed to handling fragile things. Tonya did not pull away. The fight had gone out of her, leaving a hollowed-out shell. She allowed him to guide her, her feet shuffling on the floor as he led her from the dim sanctuary of the spare bedroom, away from the desecrated altar and the failed miracle. He sat her down on the spartan sofa in the living room, a piece of furniture that had clearly seen little use. It was a space designed for waiting, and it seemed that its purpose had finally arrived. She sat stiffly, her hands in her lap, her gaze fixed on the empty space in front of her, seeing not the clean wall but the ghost of the perfect, still image she had almost captured.\n\nHe knelt in front of her, a gesture of supplication he did not understand himself. \u201cTonya,\u201d he began, his voice low and scraped raw, \u201cwe need to\u2026 I need to help you.\u201d He was speaking from a script of basic human decency, but the words felt like pebbles thrown against a fortress wall. She blinked slowly, her focus shifting from an inner landscape to his earnest, troubled face. \u201cHelp me?\u201d she repeated, the question holding no curiosity, only a faint, clinical detachment. \u201cYou broke it. The symmetry. It can\u2019t be fixed now. All the lines are crooked.\u201d She looked around the neat, empty room as if she could see the bent and broken lines of a great geometric proof that had been irreparably corrupted. Her grief was not for a life, but for the loss of a perfect, abstract form.\n\nThe moment the connection snapped, Tales was flung backwards through a non-space of roaring, colorless static. It was not a gentle fading but a violent recoil, the snapping of a psychic tether stretched far beyond its breaking point. He slammed back into the silent, familiar darkness of his corner in the Spokane library on South Lincoln Street. The sensory whiplash was staggering. The emotional hurricane of Tonya\u2019s apartment\u2014the fear, the rage, the profound sorrow\u2014was instantly replaced by an absolute, profound stillness. Moonlight, filtered through the tall, arched windows, laid pale rectangles on the dusty floor. The only sound was a faint, high-frequency hum from an emergency exit sign. The air tasted of old paper and settled dust. He was home. He was safe. And he had never felt more agonizingly alone.\n\nHe was no longer the same entity that had departed this place. Before, he had been a hypothesis, a draft of memory. Now, he was a cause, a catalyst. He had reached across the veil and pushed, and the world had pushed back. The effort had left him feeling thin and abraded, a ghost with phantom road rash. He had succeeded in his primary, desperate goal, but the victory was a complex, bitter thing. He had not restored order; he had simply introduced a new, more chaotic variable into the equation. He had saved a mantis, but he had shattered a mind, and he was now trapped miles away, a doctor who had performed a radical and unsanctioned surgery and was now barred from the recovery room, left to wonder if the patient would survive the cure.\n\nBen knew he couldn't leave her like this, a statue of grief in an empty room. More than that, he knew he couldn\u2019t leave the source of the obsession behind. Leaving the mantis would be like leaving a loaded gun on the table. He stood up, his resolve hardening. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back,\u201d he said, the words feeling inadequate and absurd. He walked back into the spare bedroom, the scene of the crime. The nitrogen cylinder stood silent and impotent. The drawings on the wall seemed to mock him with their obsessive beauty. He walked to the stand and looked down into the glass cube. The mantis, Alistair, had crawled onto a twig. It was cleaning one of its antennae with a slow, deliberate motion, a small act of personal maintenance in the ruins of a grand theological drama. It was the most heartbreakingly normal thing Ben had ever seen.\n\nHe braced himself and carefully, reverently, lifted the terrarium. The box was heavy, solid, a self-contained world of moss, soil, and terrible significance. As he turned to leave, he felt Tonya\u2019s presence in the doorway. She did not move to stop him. She simply watched, her face a pale, emotionless mask in the gloom. Her eyes were fixed on the glass box in his hands, not with anger, but with a look of profound and final separation, the look of a mother watching a child being taken away forever. She was letting him take her failure, her shame, her damaged, living art. It was a surrender.\n\nCarrying the terrarium like a holy relic, Ben backed out of the room. He navigated the short hallway and moved past the sofa where Tonya still sat, unmoving. He reached the splintered doorway, the jagged wound he had torn in her life. He paused on the threshold, his back to her. He wanted to say something\u2014'I'm sorry,' 'I'll get you help,' 'It will be alright'\u2014but he knew that any words from his world would be meaningless noise in hers. Without turning back, he stepped out into the hallway, pulling the broken door as closed as it would go. The latch didn't catch, leaving a dark, gaping crack. He stood for a moment in the dim, linoleum-floored corridor, holding a glass box containing a single, traumatized praying mantis, the silence of the apartment behind him now feeling like the silence of a tomb. He had won the battle, but he was terrifyingly aware that he had just abandoned the war's most tragic casualty on the field."

                                        "text": "### Chapter 8\n\nThe drive back to the university was a surreal, disjointed dream. Ben Carter drove ten miles under the speed limit, his hands trembling so violently he had to grip the steering wheel like a man holding onto the edge of a cliff. On the passenger seat beside him, the glass terrarium slid slightly with every turn, a fragile, self-contained world of trauma. Inside, the mantis, Alistair, clung to a branch, a silent, green passenger on a journey it could never comprehend. The city lights smeared past the windows, bright and meaningless. Ben felt a profound sense of dislocation, as if he had stepped out of the normal flow of time and was now moving through a parallel, silent version of his own life. The questions hammered at him, a relentless internal barrage. What had he just done? What was he supposed to do now? He had acted on pure, primal instinct, a biological imperative to prevent a death, and in doing so, had made himself the custodian of an impossible situation. He was carrying a piece of evidence he could never submit, from a crime that no one would ever understand.\n\nBack in the apartment, the silence settled like a layer of fine, suffocating dust. For a long time, Tonya did not move from the sofa. The broken door yawned into the dim hallway, a jagged mouth breathing the common air of the building into her sanctum. It was a violation. The sounds of the building\u2014a distant television, the rumble of the elevator, the faint footsteps of the neighbor who had knocked\u2014were all contaminants. Her world, once a sealed chamber of purpose and ritual, had been breached and exposed. Slowly, stiffly, she rose. Her first destination was the door. She looked at the splintered jamb, the mangled lock plate. With careful, deliberate fingers, she tried to fit the broken pieces of wood back together, an absurd, hopeless puzzle. It would not close. It would not seal. The world was in, and it could not be forced out.\n\nThis final, physical proof of her world\u2019s corruption seemed to trigger a new protocol. A quiet, methodical purpose returned to her movements, but it was not the serene energy of the artist. It was the flat, automatic behavior of a system trying to reset itself after a catastrophic error. She went to the kitchen and returned with a bucket of warm, soapy water and a sponge. Kneeling on the floor, she began to scrub the spot where Ben had stood, her strokes firm and even, erasing the prints of his shoes, the memory of his frantic, disruptive presence. She was not cleaning a floor; she was performing an exorcism, attempting to purify the space through a ritual of mundane labor. Her gaze was blank, her face impassive. The great, soaring architecture of her grief had collapsed, and she was now just a custodian, tidying the ruins.\n\nTales materialized in the familiar shadows of the library\u2019s history section, the sudden, violent transition leaving him feeling disoriented and thin. The quiet here was a physical presence, a weight of accumulated silence that was both a comfort and a torment. He was safe, but he was blind. He drifted from his corner, a restless current of anxiety in the still air, his perception straining, reaching back across the city toward the apartment on the north side of the river. But there was nothing. The connection was severed completely. The signal was lost. He was a doctor who had been thrown out of the ICU, left to stare at the blank walls of his office and wonder if the patient was stabilizing or crashing. The worry for Tonya was a sharp, focused ache. He understood her pathology better than Ben ever could. He knew that for a mind like hers, a mind that had built an entire reality around a single, driving purpose, the sudden removal of that purpose was not a release. It was an amputation. And he feared, with a cold, clear dread, what might rush in to fill the void.\n\nThe university was a ghost town, the labs and lecture halls dark and empty. Ben used his student keycard to let himself into the entomology building, the click of the electronic lock echoing loudly in the deserted corridor. He carried the terrarium down the hall to his own small lab, a space usually filled with the comforting, orderly clutter of his research. Tonight, it felt like an alien landscape. He placed the glass box in the center of a clean, stainless-steel workbench, the single overhead light turning it into a stark, theatrical display. He stood for a long moment, just looking at it. Alistair, seemingly recovered from its ordeal, was grooming its face with its forelegs, a gesture of unnerving, cat-like normalcy. Ben felt a sudden, absurd, and overwhelming wave of affection for the creature. It was a survivor. They were both survivors of a strange, private war. He found a small beaker, filled it with filtered water, and gently poured a small amount onto the moss in the corner of the terrarium, a clumsy but heartfelt offering. The mantis ignored it completely, and Ben felt a fresh pang of foolishness and failure. He looked from the mantis to the lab around him, a place of reason and light, and then thought of Tonya, alone in her dark apartment with her broken door, and knew that this long, terrible night was only just beginning."

When the spot was clean, and the faint, soapy scent had replaced the smell of Ben Carter\u2019s frantic intrusion, Tonya rose. Her work in the living room was done. She carried the bucket into the spare bedroom, the scene of her failure, and began the second phase of the decommissioning. The nitrogen cylinder was her first target. She unscrewed the regulator with the same dispassionate precision she had used to attach it, the faint hiss of escaping gas a final, dying breath. She coiled the silicone tubing into a perfect circle, securing it with a wire twist-tie she retrieved from a kitchen drawer. The tools, her beautiful, delicate instruments of micro-forceps and custom-made levers, were wiped clean of any lingering spiritual residue and laid back in their velvet-lined case. The sound of the lid clicking shut was a note of profound finality.\n\nLastly, she turned to the drawings on the wall. They were a gallery of her devotion, a testament to the hours she had spent in silent communion with her subject. She did not tear them down. With the careful touch of a museum archivist, she removed the pins from each corner, stacking the heavy sheets of paper one on top of the other, ensuring the edges were perfectly aligned. The graphite renderings of Alistair\u2019s spiked limbs and alien eyes stared up at her, not as art, but as data from a failed experiment. She slid the neat stack into a large portfolio, zipped it closed, and pushed it under the bed. In the space of an hour, the room was stripped bare. The temple was deconsecrated, its relics hidden away. The spare bedroom was once again just a spare bedroom, a hollow, empty space waiting for a new purpose to inhabit it. Tonya stood in the center of the emptied room, feeling not relief, but a vast, clean, and terrifying emptiness. The architecture of her grief had been razed to the ground, and she was left standing alone in the vacant lot.\n\nIn his lab, the silence hummed with a different kind of energy. It was the low, electronic thrum of dormant equipment, the sound of potential waiting for a command. Ben sat staring at the terrarium, his mind a frantic scramble of competing obligations. He had a thesis to write, data to analyze, a future to build. But all of it felt trivial, thin, like a story written in a language he no longer spoke. His reality was now divided into two distinct epochs: before Tonya\u2019s apartment, and after. He pulled out his phone, its screen a bright, accusatory rectangle in the dim lab. He navigated to an old contact list, a file saved from a group project two years prior. He found her name: Tonya Vance. Beside it was a phone number. His thumb hovered over the \u2018call\u2019 icon, a small green button that felt as momentous and terrifying as a launch trigger. What would he say? \u2018Hi Tonya, it\u2019s Ben. Just wanted to make sure you\u2019re not inventing a new, even more esoteric way to process your grief?\u2019 The absurdity was paralyzing. But the image of her kneeling on the floor, her world collapsed into a point of absolute despair, was a hook he could not shake loose. He was a scientist, trained to observe and record. But he was also a human being, and he knew, with a certainty that transcended data, that leaving a wound that deep un-tended was a form of gross negligence.\n\nDr. Tales was a ghost in a ghost town. The library, once his safe harbor, now felt like a cage built of silence and shadows. He drifted aimlessly through the towering stacks of the theology section, the leather-bound titles\u2014*The Cloud of Unknowing*, *The Dark Night of the Soul*\u2014seeming to mock his own liminal, unholy state. He was a being of pure information, yet he was cut off from the only data that mattered. He replayed the last moments in the apartment endlessly, dissecting the dialogue, the body language, the shifting emotional currents. He saw Ben\u2019s well-intentioned but clumsy intervention and Tonya\u2019s retreat into a state of catatonic order. He had prevented the symptom from reaching its fatal conclusion, but the underlying disease, the deep, systemic pathology of her grief, was now festering in the dark, without witness. He tried, with a desperate, pathetic expenditure of will, to reach out, to cast a line of thought back to the north side of the city. He focused on the memory of Ben\u2019s panic, of Tonya\u2019s stillness, trying to use them as a psychic address. The effort produced nothing but a faint, internal shimmer, a flicker in his own formless state. He was a radio operator whose transmitter had burned out, left to listen to the static and imagine the frantic, unheard messages from the front."

It was a coward\u2019s choice, and he knew it, but it was also an admission of his own profound inadequacy. He was a biologist, not a psychologist, not a priest. He had no words that could reach across the abyss of her unique and terrible grief. A phone call would be a clumsy intrusion, an offering of bland platitudes to a woman who had been communing with gods of her own creation. He could not fix her mind, but he could, perhaps, tend to the living thing he had torn from her orbit. His responsibility, for now, was to the mantis. It was a tangible problem, a biological system that required care, and in its simple, solvable needs, he saw a path through his own paralysis.\n\nHe moved with a renewed, if fragile, sense of purpose. Alistair needed a proper habitat, not this glass box that was half-altar, half-tomb. He went to a storeroom filled with the disused equipment of a dozen past experiments and found a larger, mesh-sided enclosure, the kind used for breeding studies. It was tall, allowing for climbing. He filled the bottom with a carefully layered substrate of coconut fiber and sphagnum moss to hold humidity, just as Finch had taught him. He selected a branching piece of driftwood from a supply closet, its shape complex and interesting, offering multiple perches. He worked for over an hour, his hands moving with the steady, familiar rhythm of his discipline, the methodical process of constructing a world calming the frantic storm in his mind. When it was done, he carefully coaxed the mantis from its glass prison onto the new branch. Alistair crawled slowly onto the driftwood, its antennae twitching, exploring the new topography of its expanded world. It was a small, inadequate act of restoration, but it was a start. Ben had no idea how to save Tonya, but he was determined, with a fierce and focused passion, to give this insect the best life a captive insect could possibly have.\n\nThe quiet in Tonya\u2019s apartment was no longer empty; it was pressurized. The vacuum left by the collapse of her great work was beginning to draw something new into its space. She sat at her small, clean desk, her laptop open before her. The screen was not filled with images of insects or research papers on euthanasia. It was a plain university webpage. She had spent the last hour not scrubbing floors or hiding evidence, but doing what she had always done when faced with a new subject: research. The specimen in question was no longer *Formica rufa* or *Hierodula membranacea*. It was *Ben Carter*. His name was the variable that had corrupted her data, the anomaly that had ruined her perfect symmetry. As a curator, she could not abide an uncatalogued specimen. She needed to understand its nature, its habits, its weaknesses.\n\nShe found his departmental profile easily. She saw his photograph, a candid shot from a field trip, his face earnest and smiling, his eyes lit with a guileless scientific curiosity. She read the abstract of his master\u2019s thesis, a dense, technical analysis of pollinator-plant coevolution. She scrolled through a gallery from a departmental awards ceremony and found him standing beside Dr. Finch, both of them beaming, a perfect image of mentor and devoted apprentice. She studied this image for a long time, her face impassive. Ben Carter was not a random intruder. He was part of J\u2019s world. He was another of J\u2019s imperfect, asymmetrical creations. Her gaze, once reserved for the delicate architecture of an insect\u2019s mouth, now traced the lines of Ben\u2019s face on the screen. He had inserted himself into her work, and in doing so, had become the work itself. Her project was not over. The subject had simply been upgraded.\n\nMiles away, in the deep and total silence of the closed library, DI Tales felt a change in the static. He could not see or hear, but he could feel the fundamental nature of the pathology shifting. It was a sensation he remembered from his living days, the moment a doctor realizes a patient\u2019s cancer has not been cured but has instead mutated into a new, more aggressive, and treatment-resistant form. The frantic, inward-facing grief of \u2018SymmetryForJ\u2019 had been a contained, though terrible, disease. This new silence, the silence emanating from Tonya\u2019s apartment, felt different. It was the coiled, patient silence of a predator that has identified its new prey. He did not know what she was doing, what new ritual she was planning, but he knew with the unshakeable certainty of a master diagnostician that the focus of her terrible, precise devotion had turned outward. He had been so worried about her finding a larger vessel for her grief. He had never considered that the vessel might be the very person who had tried to save her. He was a sentinel with no post, a watchman with no tower, and he knew, with a cold that seeped into the very core of his spectral being, that a new and more terrible storm was gathering in the dark."

                                        "text": "### Chapter 9\n\nThe next morning, Tonya rose with the sun. The frantic, scrubbing-clean energy of the previous night had settled into a quiet, cold resolve. The apartment, stripped of its sacred purpose, felt like a borrowed room in a stranger\u2019s house. She moved to the front door, the jagged splinters of the jamb a permanent, ugly scar on the clean lines of her world. She did not try to fix it again. Instead, she took a key from a small dish on the counter, walked outside into the cool morning air, and locked the broken door from the outside, an act that felt both absurd and necessary. She was sealing the tomb, leaving the ruins of her old religion behind. She was dressed in non-descript clothing\u2014grey jeans, a dark blue jacket, a simple baseball cap that shadowed her face. She was a field biologist preparing for an observation, and her goal was to blend into the habitat of her new subject, to become part of the background noise.\n\nThe university campus was a riot of life, a complex, teeming ecosystem that she had only ever seen from the sterile perspective of a lab assistant. Students flowed between buildings like a river of purpose, their laughter and conversation a constant, ambient hum. To Tonya, they were merely the environment, the weather patterns and foliage through which her target moved. She found a vantage point on a stone bench across the quad from the Hall of Sciences, the building that housed the entomology department. It offered a clear, unobstructed view of the main entrance. She sat, perfectly still, her hands resting in her lap, a patient predator settled in its blind. She was not waiting for an opportunity to strike; she was collecting baseline data, observing the creature in its natural habitat before she could ever hope to understand the forces that governed it.\n\nInside that same building, Ben Carter felt like a ghost haunting his own life. The familiar hum of the chromatography machines and the scent of ethanol and autoclaved soil, smells that had once meant comfort and purpose, now felt alien. He sat at his workbench, a petri dish from Palouse Falls under the lens of his microscope, but he wasn't seeing the intricate dance of nematodes and fungi. His focus kept snapping back to the night before, replaying the splintering wood, the hiss of the regulator, the look of utter devastation on Tonya\u2019s face. The secret he carried was a physical weight, isolating him from the easy camaraderie of the lab. A fellow grad student, Maya, stopped by his bench, chattering about a contaminated sample and a looming deadline, and Ben could only nod and offer vague, monosyllabic responses, his mind a million miles away in a dark apartment across the river. He was surrounded by his peers, but he had never felt more profoundly alone.\n\nHis only point of true focus, his only anchor in this new, distorted reality, was the mesh-sided enclosure that now sat on a cleared section of his workbench. Inside, Alistair moved with a slow, regal grace on its new driftwood perch. The mantis had become his secret charge, his penance, and his only confidante. Periodically, he would stop pretending to work and just watch it, his mind quieting as he observed its alien, deliberate movements. He had fed it a small, gut-loaded cricket that morning, watching with a detached biologist\u2019s fascination as the brutal, efficient predation unfolded. It was a small, perfect act of nature, a world of life and death contained in a box, and for a few minutes, it was the only thing in the universe that made any sense to him.\n\nDr. Tales was burning. The impotent rage and chilling fear had coalesced into a form of pure, focused energy. The library was a prison, and he rattled its bars with the full force of his spectral will. He could not wait for another lucky break, another unwitting ferryman to wander into his orbit. He had to hunt. He abandoned his quiet corner and swept through the vast reading rooms, a purposeful, invisible wind. He was no longer a passive observer of the living; he was a predator scanning a herd, searching for the one vessel that could carry him to his destination. He flitted past students cramming for exams, their minds a frantic buzz of dates and formulas. He bypassed history buffs and fiction readers, their thoughts meandering down paths that were useless to him. He needed a scientist. He needed a biologist. He needed someone whose trajectory was aimed directly at the heart of the crisis.\n\nHe found him in the science and technology section, a harried-looking undergraduate with a backpack spilling open, a copy of \u2018Borror and DeLong's Introduction to the Study of Insects\u2019 open on the table in front of him. The young man\u2019s mind was a messy soup of frustration over Dipteran mouthparts and anxiety about an upcoming lab practical in the Hall of Sciences. It was perfect. Tales marshaled his will, a process that was becoming more familiar, if no less costly. He focused not on a word, but on an intention, a destination. He wrapped his consciousness around the student\u2019s own ambient anxiety, becoming a parasite on his stress. When the student finally slammed his textbook shut and slung his heavy backpack over his shoulder, Tales held on with a grim, desperate tenacity. The journey out of the library was just as jarring as before, but this time he was prepared. He was not a kite in a hurricane; he was a pilot, however inexpert, deliberately flying into the storm.\n\nFrom her stone bench, Tonya saw him. Ben Carter emerged from the main doors of the science building, squinting in the bright afternoon sun. His shoulders were slumped, his gait lacking its usual energetic bounce. He carried his backpack slung over one shoulder, and he stared at the ground as he walked, oblivious to the river of students flowing around him. She cataloged the data with cold precision: signs of sleep deprivation, elevated stress, social withdrawal. Specimen #28 was exhibiting predictable, post-traumatic behavioral modifications. She felt no satisfaction, no pity. It was simply information, a new set of variables to be factored into her revised project. He walked across the quad, a solitary, troubled figure lost in a crowd, completely unaware of the patient, dispassionate eyes that were now studying his every move, learning his patterns, mapping his world. He was no longer the one who had interrupted the art. He was the canvas for the next."

Tales clung to the undergrad\u2019s frantic energy, a stowaway on a ship of stress. The student\u2019s mind was a chaotic pinball machine of facts and fears: the morphology of a housefly\u2019s tarsus, the terror of a low quiz score, the desperate need for caffeine. They burst through the main doors of the Hall of Sciences into a lobby buzzing with academic purpose. The student, seeing he was late for his lab section, broke into a clumsy, backpack-bouncing run down a crowded hallway. The sudden, propulsive movement was too much for Tales\u2019s tenuous grip. His connection snapped, and he was flung free, tumbling into the relative stillness of the lobby as his unwilling ferryman disappeared around a corner. He had arrived. He was back at the epicenter, a ghost haunting the halls of science, but his target was nowhere in sight.\n\nHe had missed him by less than thirty seconds. As Tales was being pulled into the building, a disoriented phantom swept up in another\u2019s panic, Ben Carter was pushing his way out through the same set of doors. For a fraction of a second, the two men\u2014one of solid, anxious flesh, the other of pure, desperate memory\u2014passed within feet of each other, an impossible intersection of two separate realities. Ben, his head down, felt nothing but the slight shift in air from the opening door. Tales, his perception still reeling from the violent disconnection, registered only a fleeting warmth, a brief spike of a familiar, grieving energy that was lost in the ambient noise before he could identify its source. He had crossed the entire city only to have his quarry slip through his nonexistent fingers at the very last moment.\n\nFrom her silent vantage point on the stone bench, Tonya registered the event with the dispassionate clarity of a motion-activated camera. She saw Ben emerge from the building, his posture a clear deviation from the baseline she had established in her mind. He did not pause to speak with anyone. He did not check his phone. He moved with a leaden, inward-facing focus, his path cutting a straight, unswerving line across the manicured lawn of the quad, heading east. She gave him a lead of fifty yards, a predator allowing its prey the illusion of solitude. Then, with a smooth, unhurried motion, she rose from the bench. She adjusted the brim of her cap, pulled the collar of her jacket up slightly, and began to follow. Her stride was even and measured, her presence designed to melt into the ebb and flow of the student body. She was a shadow detaching itself from other shadows, a hunter beginning the long, patient work of mapping her new specimen\u2019s territory.\n\nBen\u2019s destination was The Daily Grind, the perpetually crowded and noisy campus coffee shop. He sought not conversation but anonymity, the paradoxical solitude that can only be found in a crowd. He ordered a black coffee he didn't want and found a small, sticky table in a dark corner, the loud chatter and the clatter of ceramic mugs forming a wall of sound that buffered him from his own thoughts. He was a fugitive, hiding in plain sight from a crime no one knew he had witnessed. He stared into the black, reflective surface of his coffee, seeing not his own face but the splintered wood of Tonya\u2019s door, the cool grey of the nitrogen cylinder, the hollow infinity in her eyes. He had done the right thing, the only thing he could have done, but the certainty of that action was being eroded by the acid of its consequences. He felt responsible for her, a warden who had locked his prisoner in a cell of her own despair and then walked away with the key.\n\nBack in the Hall of Sciences, Tales began his hunt. The building was a labyrinth of identical hallways, lecture halls, and laboratories. He drifted through solid walls, a ghost on a methodical search pattern, his perception scanning the placards on doors, searching for the nameplate that would lead him to the heart of the matter. He found the entomology wing, a familiar territory of pinned insect displays and the faint, chemical scent of preservatives. He passed the bulletin board, the flyer for the Palouse pilgrimage still tacked to the cork, a relic from a previous lifetime. He continued down the hall, and there it was: a small, unassuming plastic sign slid into a metal bracket beside a locked door. *B. Carter, Grad. Researcher*. He had found the nest. With no need for a key, he passed through the solid wood of the door and into the silent, empty lab. His perception swept the room\u2014the microscope, the scattered research notes, the computer terminal left sleeping. And then he saw it. On the far workbench, under the soft glow of a utility lamp, stood a tall, mesh-sided enclosure. It was a new world, carefully constructed, and inside, perched on a piece of elegant driftwood, a living, breathing praying mantis was meticulously grooming its formidable foreleg."

                                        "text": "### Chapter 10\n\nThe laboratory was a sanctuary and a crime scene. To DI Tales, standing formless in its center, the small room was a complex tapestry of evidence. The primary exhibit was the mantis, Alistair, perched on a piece of elegant driftwood in its new, spacious enclosure. The meticulous construction of the habitat\u2014the careful layering of substrate, the optimal placement of the branch\u2014spoke with silent eloquence of Ben Carter\u2019s character. He was a builder, a nurturer, a man who responded to a crisis by creating a better, safer world, however small. The sight of the living, thriving creature was a profound relief, a validation of the terrible risks Tales had taken. But it was also a source of deep, chilling dread. This enclosure was Ben\u2019s confession. It was the physical manifestation of the secret that now isolated him, the secret that had made him Tonya\u2019s new obsession. Tales understood with a veteran detective\u2019s certainty that Ben had not simply taken the mantis; he had taken on Tonya\u2019s entire pathology, and he was now carrying it alone.\n\nOutside, in the bright, indifferent afternoon, Tonya watched the entrance to the coffee shop. She was a study in absolute stillness, a chameleon that had perfectly matched the color and texture of its surroundings. She registered the flow of students in and out of the building, the murmur of conversations, the clatter of skateboards, but it was all just atmospheric data, the background noise of her new specimen\u2019s environment. When Ben finally emerged, his coffee untouched, his face a mask of pale, unresolved anxiety, she felt a flicker of something that was not emotion, but a cold, clinical satisfaction. The specimen was exhibiting signs of profound distress. Its routines were disrupted. Its social patterns were fractured. The introduction of a foreign variable\u2014her\u2014had produced a measurable, predictable result. She noted the information, filed it away in the vast, silent catalog of her mind, and waited to see where the distressed creature would seek refuge.\n\nBen could not sit still. The coffee shop, once a comforting wall of sound, had become an echo chamber for his own spiraling thoughts. He had to move. He had to *do* something. The only tangible focus he had, the only part of the preceding night\u2019s madness that he could control, was the mantis. A sudden, urgent, and largely irrational thought seized him: the enclosure needed more ventilation. It was a flimsy pretext, a scientist\u2019s rationalization for a deep, emotional need to return to the only place that felt remotely safe. He abandoned his table, dumped the full cup of coffee into a trash can with a sense of finality, and pushed his way back out into the bright, overwhelming world. His feet, acting on an instinct deeper than conscious thought, carried him back across the quad, back toward the Hall of Sciences, back to his lab.\n\nAs he moved, a shadow detached itself from the crowd. Tonya began her pursuit, a patient, methodical process that was the polar opposite of Ben\u2019s frantic, headlong retreat. She kept a careful distance, using the shifting bodies of other students as moving screens. Her focus was absolute. She noted the way he clutched the strap of his backpack, the tension in his shoulders, the way he failed to deviate his path for an oncoming group, forcing them to part around him. Every gesture was a data point. Every action revealed a new facet of his compromised state. She was not just following him; she was dissecting him from afar, learning the rhythm of his distress, the architecture of his fear. She was the curator, and he was the beautiful, crooked thing she would soon collect.\n\nTales began to search. A being of pure will, untethered by gravity or solid matter, he moved through the building with the silent, relentless efficiency of a spreading gas. He swept through a bustling lecture hall where a professor droned on about mitochondrial DNA, the living minds a sea of boredom and concentration that he passed through like a cold front. He drifted through faculty offices, past professors arguing over grant proposals and staring at computer screens, their private dramas irrelevant to his singular, urgent mission. He was hunting for a specific psychic signature, the unique frequency of Ben Carter\u2019s earnest, guilt-ridden consciousness. He could feel the ambient life of the building, a low, constant hum, but he was searching for a solo instrument in the orchestra, a single, identifiable voice in the choir.\n\nThe inevitable convergence came with a heart-stopping, silent near-miss. As Ben, fumbling with his keys, approached the door to his lab at the end of a long, empty corridor, Tales was drifting out of the adjacent storeroom, having completed his sweep of that section. For a breathtaking instant, they were separated by less than five feet and the thin, permeable barrier between the living and the dead. Tales felt a sudden, sharp spike in the ambient energy, a familiar signal of focused anxiety, but it was gone before he could triangulate it, lost in the echo of his own movement. Ben, his attention fixed on the recalcitrant lock, felt a sudden, inexplicable chill, a prickling on his skin that he dismissed as a draft from the building\u2019s overzealous air conditioning. He finally turned the key, pushed the door open, and stepped inside, the heavy door swinging shut behind him.\n\nHe was safe. The quiet of the lab settled around him, a comforting blanket. His gaze went immediately to the mesh enclosure. Alistair was perched near the top, its head swiveling to watch him, a silent, living gargoyle. A small measure of the tension in Ben\u2019s shoulders eased. This was real. This was manageable. But he was not alone. From the darkest corner of the room, a silent, unseen sentinel watched him. DI Tales had ceased his search. He had found his target. The three of them\u2014the haunted, the hunter, and the ghost\u2014were now together in the same small, sealed room, a fragile ecosystem of secrets and impending doom, while just outside the walls of the building, a patient, observant predator settled in for a long, watchful wait."

                                        "text": "The lab was Ben\u2019s sanctuary, but it offered no peace. The silence was thick with unspoken fears. He moved with the jerky, inefficient motions of a man running on pure adrenaline and lack of sleep, his mind casting about for a task, any task, that could anchor him. The flimsy pretext that had brought him back here\u2014ventilation\u2014now seemed absurdly transparent even to himself. Still, he latched onto it. He found a small, battery-operated fan in a supply drawer and positioned it near the mesh-sided enclosure, angling it to create a gentle, indirect cross-breeze. It was a meaningless gesture, a nervous tic given physical form, but it was something to *do*. He watched the imperceptible movement of the air, then his gaze settled on Alistair. The mantis, oblivious, continued its patient grooming, a perfect, self-contained being of instinct and purpose. In its alien stillness, Ben saw a composure he desperately craved and knew he would never again possess.\n\nFrom his corner, Tales watched this sad, busy-work ballet with a profound and aching pity. Ben was tending to a cage while the true predator circled the perimeter of his life, unseen and unheeded. The young man\u2019s ignorance was a form of damnation. Tales could feel the frantic, scattered energy radiating from him, a psychic noise of guilt and confusion. A whispered word, a subtle suggestion\u2014those were the tools of a diagnostician trying to guide a patient toward a realization. But the time for subtlety was over. This was an emergency. The patient was bleeding out and refusing to acknowledge the wound. Tales knew he had to attempt something more direct, a warning that could cut through the fog of Ben\u2019s distress. It would be a monumental effort, a reckless expenditure of his fragile energy, but the alternative\u2014to stand by and watch the inevitable unfold\u2014was unthinkable.\n\nTonya\u2019s patience was not infinite; it was simply calibrated to the demands of the hunt. Waiting outside the building was no longer yielding useful data. The specimen had retreated into its den, and passive observation from a distance was now insufficient. She needed to assess the nest itself, to understand the interior geography of his world. A small group of students, laughing and complaining about an upcoming exam, approached the entrance to the Hall of Sciences. Tonya recognized one of them from the department, a first-year she had seen in the company of Dr. Finch. Without a flicker of hesitation, she fell into step behind them, her gait adjusting to match their rhythm, her body language shifting to mimic their casual, collegiate slouch. She became one of them, a ghost in their machine. She passed through the doors as part of the group, a predator cloaked in the harmless colors of the herd, her cold, focused purpose a silent, deadly current in the warm stream of their oblivious lives.\n\nInside the lab, Ben had finally abandoned his pretense of activity and collapsed into his desk chair, his head in his hands. The low hum of the fan and the faint whir of his computer\u2019s cooling system were the only sounds. It was in this moment of despairing quiet that Tales made his move. He gathered his will, focusing it with an intensity that felt like it might tear his very essence apart. He aimed not at Ben\u2019s mind, but at the machine on his desk. He poured all his fear, his knowledge, and his desperate, screaming urgency into the sleeping screen of the computer. For a moment, nothing happened. Then, the screen flickered to life, not with its usual login prompt, but with a cascade of garbled, nonsensical characters, a river of digital gibberish. And in the very center of the chaos, for a single, shimmering second, a string of pixels coalesced into a recognizable shape. The letters were fractured, unstable, as if typed on a keyboard submerged in water: *Symm\u2026ForJ\u2026DANGER*.\n\nBen\u2019s head snapped up at the sudden flash of light. He stared at the screen, his tired eyes struggling to process what they were seeing. The garbled text was already gone, replaced by the standard, placid blue of the login screen. He blinked. A power surge? A graphics card glitch? He rubbed his eyes, the image of the fractured words already fading, dismissed by his rational mind as a stress-induced hallucination, a phantom artifact of an exhausted brain. He sighed, shaking his head at his own frayed nerves, and turned his attention back to the mantis, missing the significance of the omen entirely. Tales, drained and ragged, felt a spectral wave of despair. He had fired his only warning shot, and it had been mistaken for a stray firework.\n\nThe hallways of the Hall of Sciences were a sterile, branching network, but Tonya navigated them with an unerring sense of direction. She moved with a quiet, fluid purpose, her eyes scanning the placards on the walls, her mind cross-referencing the information with the faculty directory she had memorized. She ignored the open doors of bustling lecture halls and the chatter spilling from common areas. She was drawn, as if by magnetism, to the quieter, more secluded corridors of the graduate research wing. The hum of the building was different here\u2014less human, more mechanical. And then she saw it. At the end of a long, quiet hall, a simple plastic nameplate slid into a metal bracket. *B. Carter, Grad. Researcher*. The hunter had arrived at the door to the lair. She stood for a long moment, perfectly still, listening. She heard nothing but the faint, high-pitched whine of the building\u2019s fluorescent lights. With a hand as steady as a surgeon\u2019s, she reached out and rested her gloved fingers on the cool, smooth metal of the doorknob."

Tonya\u2019s gloved fingers wrapped around it, and with a slow, deliberate motion born of infinite patience, she turned. The mechanism inside rotated, hit a point of resistance, and stopped. The door was locked. For a flicker of a moment, the world deviated from her plan, a slight, jarring imperfection in the flow of events. There was no surge of anger, no flicker of frustration in her expression. It was simply new data, a variable that required a revised approach. Forcing the door was a crude, asymmetrical solution, the method of a panicked animal like Ben. Her work required elegance, infiltration, a key. Her hand retreated from the knob, leaving no print, no evidence of her presence. She turned, her soft-soled shoes making no sound on the linoleum floor, and melted back into the quiet emptiness of the corridor. The objective had changed from passive observation to active acquisition.\n\nInside the lab, the almost imperceptible rattle of the knob was a sonic boom in the cathedral of Ben\u2019s anxiety. He froze, his head snapping up from his hands, every nerve ending screaming. The sound was tiny, furtive, the antithesis of a casual colleague trying the door. His heart hammered against his ribs, a frantic, trapped bird. Was it Maya, forgetting something? Was it the building\u2019s maintenance staff? Or was it her? Had she followed him? The sanctuary of the lab instantly transformed into a cage, a baited trap he had willingly walked into. Simultaneously, DI Tales, slumped in his spectral corner, felt it not as a sound but as a sudden, needle-sharp spike of cold intention pressing against the other side of the door. He felt the pure, predatory focus of Tonya Vance, and he felt the subsequent explosion of terror in Ben\u2019s mind. The warning he had failed to deliver was now being announced by the turning of a lock, and it was a language Ben understood perfectly.\n\nSlowly, silently, Ben pushed his chair back. He rose to his feet with the cautious, fluid movements of a prey animal that has sensed the predator at the edge of the clearing. He crept to the door, his own lab now a foreign and hostile territory. His eye went to the small, wire-reinforced glass window in the upper half of the door. He peered through, his breath held tight in his chest, expecting to see a face, a shadow, something. He saw nothing. The corridor was empty, sterile, bathed in the humming, indifferent light of the overhead fixtures. The absolute emptiness was a thousand times more terrifying than a confrontation. It was not his imagination. The sound had been real. She had been there. She had tested the door. And now she was gone. She knew where he was. The hunter had located his den, and now, somewhere in the labyrinth of the building, she was simply waiting."
