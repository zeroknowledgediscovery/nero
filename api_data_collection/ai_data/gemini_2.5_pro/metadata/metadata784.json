     "novel_text": "The heat in Perth that afternoon was a physical presence, a thick, wavering curtain of shimmering air that clung to the skin like a damp wool blanket. It wasn't just hot; it was a solid thing, a weight pressing down from a sky the colour of bleached bone. In the small, scorched patch of grass he called a backyard, Baz O\u2019Connell sat on a white plastic chair that groaned under his frame, a bead of sweat tracing a slow, deliberate path from his temple down the hard line of his jaw. The world smelled of baked concrete and the faint, salty promise of the ocean, a promise that the Fremantle Doctor would eventually arrive to offer its weak, afternoon reprieve. For now, though, there was just the heat and the low, contented hum of a city simmering under the sun.\n\nThen his phone, lying face-up on the rickety patio table, buzzed with a ferocity that seemed to violate the lethargy of the day. He squinted at the unknown number, an Eastern States area code, and felt a familiar jolt, a surge of something that was half-anxiety, half-electric hope. He snatched it up, his thumb swiping across the screen. \"Baz here.\" His voice was a low rumble, conditioned by years of shouting over the din of construction sites.\n\n\"Am I speaking with Mr. Barry O'Connell?\" The voice on the other end was crisp, formal, a woman's voice that sounded like it was wearing a freshly pressed suit.\n\n\"Yeah, that's me. Who's this?\"\n\n\"This is Janice from the board of the Australian Pie Association. I'm calling to officially congratulate you, Mr. O'Connell. Your performance in the Western Australian regional qualifier has earned you a place. You are one of the six finalists who will be competing in the National Golden Crust Championship next month in Melbourne.\"\n\nThe world stopped. The oppressive heat, the buzzing of a persistent fly, the distant rumble of traffic on the highway\u2014it all dissolved into a silent, perfect vacuum. A slow grin stretched across Baz\u2019s face, a wide, triumphant baring of teeth that crinkled the sun-weathered skin around his eyes. He stood up so fast the plastic chair screeched back and nearly toppled over. He pumped a fist into the thick, unmoving air. \"You're kidding me. The final? For real?\"\n\n\"Quite real, Mr. O'Connell. A formal invitation and travel itinerary will be emailed to you within the hour. Congratulations again. And may the best man win.\"\n\nThe line clicked dead. Baz stared at the phone for a long moment, the screen gone dark, reflecting his own dumbstruck, ecstatic face. The final. The Golden Crust. He\u2019d done it. He let out a roar that was pure, unadulterated joy, a primal sound that sent a flock of galahs screeching from the neighbour's gum tree. This was it. This was more than just a laugh, more than a weird hobby his brother teased him about. It was a monument to glorious, pointless ambition, and he, Baz O'Connell, scaffolder and dreamer, was one of its chief architects. He strode to the rusty old fridge he kept on the patio, pulled out a cold beer, and cracked it open with a satisfying hiss. The first gulp was victory itself, cold and sharp and tasting of a future paved with flaky pastry.\n\nHis first thought, after the initial wave of euphoria began to recede into a deep, thrumming satisfaction, was of Leo. He had to tell Leo. His younger brother, the sensible one, the one who\u2019d gone to uni and got a proper job in an office with air conditioning and pot plants. Leo, who called Baz\u2019s passion \u201cstructured gluttony\u201d and worried about his cholesterol with a sincerity that was both irritating and endearing. Leo would sigh, he would lecture, but underneath it all, he would be proud. He had to be. Baz thumbed through his contacts, his hands, usually so steady on steel beams twenty storeys up, feeling a little shaky. He pressed the call button next to 'Leo the Nerd' and put the phone to his ear.\n\nIt rang twice. \"Hey, big fella,\" Leo's voice came through, tinny and distant, punctuated by the unmistakable sound of road noise. \"On your fifth beer of the arvo already?\"\n\n\"Just cracked the first, you cheeky bugger. And it's a celebration,\" Baz boomed. \"You are talking to a national finalist.\"\n\nThere was a pause, just a beat of static and wind. \"Finalist for what? Biggest Bloke on Site?\"\n\n\"The Golden Crust, dickhead! The pie-eating final! They just called. I'm in. I'm flying to Melbourne next month to eat for the title.\"\n\nHe could almost hear Leo shaking his head, could picture the fond, exasperated smile. \"Jesus, Baz. You actually did it. You absolute madman. I thought you were just doing it to get a free feed at the local heats.\"\n\n\"Nah, mate, I'm serious about this. I'm the best. Now I get to prove it.\"\n\n\"The best at unhinging your jaw like a python? It's a noble pursuit,\" Leo said, the sound of his indicator clicking in the background. \"Look, mate, that's\u2026 it's something, alright. We'll have to have a proper celebration when I get back.\"\n\n\"Where you headed, anyway?\" Baz asked, taking another swig of his beer.\n\n\"Just gotta shoot down to Mandurah. Pick up some documents for work. Some old client who still thinks email is black magic. I should be back in Perth before sundown.\" There was a rustle, a sound of distraction. \"Shit, this exit... Look, Baz, I'm proud of you, you idiot. Seriously. Don't\u2026 don't have a heart attack before the main event, eh? We'll talk tonight.\"\n\n\"Yeah, you too. Just watch the road, mate. Don't text and drive.\"\n\n\"I'm on hands-free, Mum,\" Leo laughed. \"Talk later.\"\n\nThe line went dead. Baz lowered the phone, a wide, easy smile still on his face. He felt invincible. The world was his oyster, or better yet, his meat pie. He finished his beer in two long swallows and went inside, the cool of the house a sudden shock. In the kitchen, sitting on the counter, was his secret weapon. It was a pie from the small, artisan bakery downtown that he'd identified as having the closest pastry density and filling viscosity to the official contest pies. He\u2019d been studying them, training with them. This wasn\u2019t just about a big stomach; it was a science. It was about heat management, about finding the rhythm of crust and filling, the interplay of texture, the precise moment to swallow to conserve energy.\n\nHe picked it up. It was heavy, a perfect golden disc, still faintly warm. The scent of it\u2014rich, dark gravy, slow-braised beef, a hint of black pepper and thyme\u2014was the smell of his purpose. He set it down, his focus narrowing. The call from Leo had been good, but the distraction had been there in his brother's voice. That was the problem with the real world, the world of jobs and freeways and responsibilities. It was so damn distracting. His world, for the next month, had to be pure. It had to be about the pie.\n\nHis training regimen was a thing of quiet, monastic dedication. Early morning runs along the Swan River, not for fitness, but to expand his lung capacity, to teach his body to process oxygen more efficiently under duress. Hours spent chewing a specialised rubber block to strengthen his jaw muscles, an exercise that made him look like a demented bulldog to anyone who happened to glance into his living room. And the water loading. Litres and litres of water to stretch his stomach, a slow, uncomfortable process that left him feeling bloated and miserable but was essential for making the space he\u2019d need. He was a machine being calibrated for a single, absurdly specific task. A high-performance athlete whose sport nobody respected, least of all the man he most wanted to impress.\n\nAs the afternoon bled into evening, the fierce white heat of the day softened into a golden glow. The Fremantle Doctor finally made its presence known, a cool, salty breeze that rustled the leaves of the struggling lemon tree in the corner of his yard and carried the distant sound of children playing. The initial high of the phone call had settled into a low, simmering excitement. He kept checking his phone, expecting a follow-up text from Leo, probably a link to an article about the dangers of processed meats. He was waiting for the 'I'm home' call, the promise of a shared beer and a proper ribbing.\n\nThe sun was a fiery orange smudge on the horizon when the phone rang again. He grinned, assuming it was Leo, ready with a smart-arse comment. He picked it up without checking the number. \"Alright, nerd, you home yet?\"\n\nA woman's voice answered, and it was not Leo's. It was calm, professional, and utterly devoid of warmth. It was a voice that chilled the balmy evening air. \"Am I speaking to a Mr. Barry O'Connell?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Baz said, his grin faltering. The similarity to the call from the pie association was unnerving. \"Who's this?\"\n\n\"My name is Constable Davies. I'm calling from Peel Health Campus. We have your brother, Leo O'Connell, here. There's been an accident. A motor vehicle collision on the Kwinana Freeway.\"\n\nThe world, which had stopped so beautifully just a few hours ago, stopped again. But this time it was not a silent, perfect vacuum. This time it was a screech of tearing metal, a cacophony of shattering glass, a sickening, final thud. The plastic cup of water he\u2019d been holding slipped from his suddenly nerveless fingers. It didn't shatter, just hit the worn linoleum with a dull thud, the water splashing over his bare feet, cold as ice.\n\n\"Is he\u2026?\" The words wouldn't form. His throat was a knot of tight muscle.\n\n\"He's alive,\" the constable said, and Baz's knees almost buckled in relief. But she wasn't finished. \"He's alive, but his injuries are very serious, Mr. O'Connell. The doctors are with him now. They said you should come as soon as you can.\"The drive south was a blur of red tail-lights and the ghostly white glare of overhead lamps smearing across the windscreen. Baz\u2019s old ute, usually a comforting, rumbling beast, felt like a fragile cage hurtling through a hostile world. He gripped the steering wheel so hard his knuckles were white, his big frame crammed into the driver\u2019s seat, feeling for the first time in his life not powerful, but sickeningly, terrifyingly small. The Kwinana Freeway stretched out before him, a ribbon of dark asphalt that had, just hours ago, been the site of his brother's undoing. Every passing car was a potential missile, every lane change a new threat. The city simmered no longer; it snarled.\n\nHe couldn\u2019t stop replaying their last conversation. Leo\u2019s laugh, tinny and distant, echoing in his memory. *I'm on hands-free, Mum.* The casual, affectionate mockery. *Don't have a heart attack before the main event, eh?* Baz\u2019s jaw clenched so tight a bolt of pain shot up into his temple. The main event. He\u2019d been so full of it, so wrapped up in his ridiculous, gravy-soaked dream. He had boomed about being a national finalist while his brother, the sensible one, the one who looked out for him, was driving into a nightmare. The shame was a physical sensation, a hot, coiling thing in his gut that was worse than any pre-contest bloat.\n\nThe email from the Pie Association would be in his inbox now. A formal invitation. An itinerary. A flight to Melbourne. The thought was so absurd, so obscene, that he let out a short, harsh bark of a laugh that sounded more like a sob. The Golden Crust. A monument to glorious, pointless ambition. He saw it clearly now, stripped of all its self-congratulatory romance. It was just pointless. A stupid, childish game he played while real life, fragile and precious, was happening all around him, ready to be snatched away without warning. He felt a violent urge to take his phone, the source of both his triumph and his terror, and hurl it out of the window into the rushing darkness.\n\nPeel Health Campus rose out of the suburban dark, a modern, sterile block of beige brick and illuminated glass. It looked like any other building, but tonight it felt like a temple of dread. He parked the ute crookedly in a bay, the front wheel bumping up onto the curb, and didn't bother to fix it. The air outside was cooler now, the sea breeze more pronounced, but he barely felt it. The automatic doors of the Emergency Department slid open with a soft whoosh, releasing a gust of air that smelled of disinfectant and quiet desperation. The brightly lit waiting room was sparsely populated with the walking wounded and their worried companions, a tableau of late-night misery.\n\nHe strode to the reception desk, a monolith of pale laminate under the harsh fluorescent lights. A nurse with tired eyes looked up from her computer screen.\n\"I'm here to see my brother,\" Baz said, his voice a raw, tight thing that was barely recognisable as his own. \"Leo O'Connell. There was a car accident. Someone called me.\"\nThe nurse\u2019s expression softened with a practiced, professional pity that made Baz\u2019s skin crawl. She typed the name into her system, her fingers clicking softly on the keyboard. The sound seemed unnaturally loud in the hushed room. \"Yes, Mr. O'Connell. He's here. He's in surgery at the moment. If you'd like to take a seat, the doctor will be out to speak with you as soon as they can.\"\n\nSurgery. The word landed like a punch to the stomach. It wasn't a broken arm or a few stitches. It was deep, internal, a place where things could go irrevocably wrong. He found an empty chair in a designated waiting area, a small, grim alcove with faded art on the walls and a television silently flashing a news report. A woman across from him was weeping softly into a handful of tissues. A man sat staring at the floor, his leg jiggling with a frantic, nervous energy. Baz just sat, his hands on his knees, his entire body a rigid knot of tension. The world had shrunk to this single, air-conditioned room. There was no Perth, no Melbourne, no Golden Crust. There was only the before, and the agonising, uncertain now. He stared at the swinging doors the nurse had vaguely gestured towards, willing them to open, dreading the face of the person who would eventually walk through them. Time stretched and warped, each minute an hour, each tick of the institutional clock on the wall a hammer blow against his sanity.\n\nFinally, after an eternity carved from fear, a man in blue scrubs pushed through the doors. He was tall and weary-looking, with dark circles under his eyes that spoke of a long and difficult night. His eyes scanned the small group and settled on Baz. He walked over, his footsteps echoing on the polished floor.\n\"Mr. O'Connell?\" the man asked, his voice low and grave. \"I'm Dr. Reid. I'm one of the surgeons who has been working on your brother.\"\nBaz stood up, his body feeling both heavy and strangely numb. He looked at the doctor's face, searching for a sign, a flicker of hope or a shadow of doom. But the man\u2019s expression was carefully, professionally neutral.\n\"Can we talk for a moment in the family room? It's just over here.\"The family room was a small, beige lie. It was designed to look comforting, with its soft lighting and generic watercolour prints of sailboats, but the air was thick with the ghosts of bad news. A box of tissues sat pristine on a small coffee table, a silent testament to the room\u2019s true purpose. Baz didn\u2019t sit. He stood in the middle of the worn carpet, his massive frame dwarfing the space, his arms hanging limp at his sides. He felt like a bull trapped in a doll\u2019s house.\n\nDr. Reid gestured towards one of the chairs, but Baz didn\u2019t seem to notice. The doctor let it go, his gaze professional and deeply tired. \"Your brother was brought in with multiple traumatic injuries consistent with a high-speed collision,\" he began, his voice even and devoid of emotion. It was the voice of a man who had to deliver these speeches far too often. \"The primary impact was on the driver's side. We took him straight to theatre. He had significant internal bleeding from a ruptured spleen, which we have managed to control, and a compound fracture of his left femur.\"\n\nThe words were just sounds, a medical lecture that Baz couldn't quite connect to the laughing, vibrant image of his brother. Ruptured spleen. Compound fracture. It was a foreign language describing the deconstruction of the person he knew best. He stared at a faint water stain on the ceiling, a pale brown map of some long-forgotten leak, and tried to make his brain work. He felt a strange detachment, as if he were watching a scene in a movie. This wasn't happening to him. This wasn't happening to Leo.\n\n\"The more pressing concern,\" Dr. Reid continued, pulling Baz\u2019s attention back into the sterile room, \"is the head injury. He sustained a significant blow to the head, which has caused a subdural hematoma\u2014that's a bleed on the surface of the brain. We've operated to relieve the pressure, but there is still a great deal of swelling. To give his brain the best possible chance to rest and recover, we've placed him in a medically induced coma.\"\n\nComa. The word landed and exploded, silencing the medical jargon and leaving only a ringing void. A coma. Leo was here, in this building, but he was also gone. He was asleep, but it was a sleep from which he might never wake. Baz\u2019s throat worked, but no sound came out. The image of Leo\u2019s face, a fond, exasperated smile as he called him a 'madman', flashed in his mind, so clear and so vivid it was like a physical blow. He swayed slightly on his feet.\n\n\"Will he\u2026?\" Baz finally managed, his voice a hoarse whisper he didn't recognise. He couldn\u2019t finish the question. He couldn\u2019t give voice to the worst possible outcome. \"Is he going to be okay?\"\n\nThe doctor\u2019s professional mask softened for a fraction of a second, a flicker of human empathy in his exhausted eyes. \"It's too early to give you a definitive prognosis, Mr. O'Connell. With brain injuries, the first twenty-four to forty-eight hours are critical. We are doing everything we can. His youth and his general good health are on his side. But he is in a very serious condition. We have to wait and see how he responds once the swelling starts to go down.\"\n\nThe non-answer was an answer in itself. It was a confirmation of the abyss that had just opened up at Baz\u2019s feet. He finally felt his legs give way and he collapsed into one of the flimsy chairs, which protested with a sharp crack under his weight. He didn't care if it broke. He dropped his head into his hands, his thick fingers pressing into his temples. The smell of baked concrete and the promise of the ocean felt a lifetime away. The triumphant roar he\u2019d let out in his backyard now seemed like a sacrilege, a boast to a cruel and indifferent god.\n\n\"He's being moved to the Intensive Care Unit now,\" Dr. Reid said gently. \"You can see him in a little while, once he's settled. The nurses on the ward will come and get you. I'm very sorry, Mr. O'Connell.\" The doctor gave a slight, helpless nod and then he was gone, leaving Baz alone in the beige room. The silence that rushed in was absolute, a crushing weight that was far heavier than any summer heat. The joy of a few hours ago had been a cheap, hollow thing. This, right here, was real. This was the main event. And he had never felt less like a champion.## Chapter 2\n\nAn hour, or maybe it was a lifetime, passed in the beige room. Baz didn't move. He simply sat, letting the silence press down on him. The world had been reduced to the thrum of the air conditioning and the frantic, useless looping of his own thoughts. The last conversation. The sound of Leo\u2019s indicator. The pie on his kitchen counter. Each memory was a fresh turn of the knife. He was eventually retrieved by a kind-faced, middle-aged nurse named Carol, whose soft voice and gentle hand on his arm were the first touches of human kindness he had felt since the constable's call. She led him through another set of swinging doors and down a long, quiet corridor that felt different from the chaotic energy of the Emergency Department. The air here was cooler, the silence more profound, punctuated only by the soft beep and whir of unseen machines.\n\nThe Intensive Care Unit was a world unto itself. It was a place of hushed efficiency, of controlled and measured crisis. Each patient was in their own glass-walled bay, a small stage for a private drama of survival, presided over by a tangled web of technology. Monitors glowed with waterfalls of coloured lines and numbers, intravenous poles stood like metallic trees bearing bags of clear fluid, and ventilators hissed and clicked with a steady, rhythmic breath that was both life-sustaining and deeply unnatural. The smell was the same as the rest of the hospital, disinfectant and illness, but sharpened here, more concentrated, with an undercurrent of something metallic and cold.\n\nCarol led him to a bay at the far end. \"He's just in here, love. He has his own nurse with him at all times. Just press the button if you need anything at all. You can stay as long as you like.\"\n\nBaz stepped into the room and his own breath hitched in his throat. The figure in the bed was and was not Leo. The familiar shape of his brother was there, the line of his shoulders under the thin hospital blanket, the dark hair splayed against the pillow. But this version of Leo was unnervingly still, his face pale and swollen, a small white bandage taped to his temple. A tube entered his mouth, secured with tape, connected to the ventilator that rose and fell in his place, forcing air into his lungs with a soft, mechanical sigh. Wires snaked from his chest to a monitor above the bed, where a green line jaggedly traced the frantic, stubborn beat of his heart.\n\nHe looked small. Leo, who had always seemed to be vibrating with a restless, intellectual energy, who was always talking, gesturing, his mind ten steps ahead of everyone else, was utterly and completely inert. All his wit, his sarcasm, his fond exasperation, was gone, replaced by the humming and beeping of the machines that were keeping his body alive. Baz felt a wave of nausea. He wanted to tear the tubes and wires away, to shake his brother awake, to demand he stop this terrible, silent prank. He took a hesitant step closer, his work boots feeling clumsy and loud on the clean floor. He reached out a hand, calloused and huge, and gently touched Leo's arm, just above the IV line. His skin was warm. That simple fact, the warmth of his brother\u2019s body, was a small, desperate anchor in the tidal wave of horror.\n\nHe pulled a hard plastic visitor\u2019s chair to the bedside, its legs scraping against the floor with a sound that felt like a desecration of the room\u2019s quiet solemnity. He sat down, hunched forward, his elbows on his knees, and just watched. He watched the numbers on the screen, trying to decipher their meaning, trying to will them to be \u2018good\u2019 numbers. He watched the steady rise and fall of Leo\u2019s chest, a puppet\u2019s movement controlled by the machine beside him. The minutes bled into an hour, then two. The nurse, a young man named Ben, came in and out, checking readings, making notes, moving with a quiet competence that was both reassuring and terrifying. He spoke to Baz in low, respectful tones, explaining what he was doing, but the words barely registered.\n\nBaz\u2019s phone, forgotten in his pocket, vibrated against his leg. The buzz was a phantom of the earlier, joyful call, now a hateful intrusion. He pulled it out, his thumb clumsy on the screen. There was a new email. The subject line glowed with obscene cheerfulness: *Congratulations - Golden Crust Championship Finalist*. His vision tunnelled. The words seemed to mock him from the screen. A flight to Melbourne. A hotel reservation. A schedule of media appearances. A future that had ceased to exist. His thumb hovered over the delete icon, his whole body trembling with a mixture of rage and revulsion. He couldn\u2019t even bring himself to do it. Deleting it felt like an action, and he was capable of none. He just switched the phone to silent and shoved it deep into his pocket, a toxic secret weighing him down.\n\nThe call to their parents was the hardest thing he had ever had to do. They had retired to a small village in the south of England five years ago, a world away in every sense. He stepped out of the ICU, back into the quiet corridor, and dialled. Hearing his mother\u2019s cheerful, unsuspecting voice ask him how he was, how her \"two wonderful boys\" were doing, shattered the fragile composure he had been holding together. He choked on the words, his voice cracking as he relayed the doctor\u2019s sterile report. The silence on the other end of the line was a vast, echoing chasm of disbelief and pain, followed by a sound, a thin, wailing cry from his mother, that would be seared into his memory forever. They were booking the first available flight. They would be there in thirty hours. Until then, he was alone.\n\nHe returned to Leo\u2019s bedside, the weight of his parents\u2019 grief now added to his own. He leaned in close to his brother\u2019s ear, the smell of antiseptic sharp in his nostrils.\n\u201cYou hear that, you git?\u201d he whispered, his voice thick and rough. \u201cYou\u2019ve gone and made Mum cry. You better not make me tell her anything worse. You better not.\u201d\nHe started talking then, a low, rambling monologue to fill the awful silence. He talked about his day, about the oppressive heat, the call from the pie lady, his own stupid, selfish pride. \u201cI was a right idiot, Leo. A proper knob. Strutting around the yard like I\u2019d won the bloody lottery, all over a pie competition. While you were\u2026 while this was happening. I\u2019m so sorry, mate. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d\nHe talked about their childhood, about the time they\u2019d tried to build a raft to sail down the Swan River and nearly drowned, about the dog they\u2019d shared, about the first car Leo had ever bought, a beat-up Datsun he\u2019d loved more than anything. He talked until his throat was raw, his words a desperate, continuous prayer aimed at the unmoving man in the bed. He was trying to build a bridge of sound across the silent, terrifying gap that had opened between them, hoping a single word might find its way through.\n\nAs the night deepened outside, a dinner service cart rattled past the door of the ICU. Through the glass, Baz saw a nurse deliver a tray to a visitor in another bay. On it was a plate shrouded in a metal lid. The visitor lifted it, and a small puff of steam escaped. Underneath sat a meat pie, pale and institutional, its gravy thin and leaking into a mound of instant mashed potato. A jolt went through Baz, a bizarre and instantaneous reflex. *Too much moisture in the filling. The pastry will be compromised. Soggy bottom.* The thought, a fragment of the man he had been that afternoon, was so alien, so grotesquely inappropriate, that he felt a fresh wave of self-disgust wash over him. He looked from the sad, hospital pie to his brother\u2019s pale face, and the gulf between his old life and this new reality yawned wide and bottomless. His pointless ambition, his structured gluttony, his entire world of pastry and filling, had turned to ash in his mouth.The first light of dawn was a sickly grey, filtering through the blinds of the ICU window and stripping the room of its nocturnal shadows. Baz hadn't slept. He sat in the same hard chair, his spine a column of agony, his clothes smelling of stale sweat and fear. Outside, he knew Perth was waking up, the early commuters starting their journeys, the city beginning to warm for another day. It was a world he no longer belonged to. His own world was four glass walls, the rhythmic hiss of the ventilator, and the jagged green line on the monitor that proved his brother was still, somehow, fighting. He was an exhausted sentry at the gate between life and death, and he had no idea which way the traffic was flowing.\n\nA dull ache in his jaw reminded him of his training. The hours spent chewing the specialised rubber block, the single-minded focus on building strength for a task that now seemed like the definition of insanity. He had treated his body like a piece of high-performance machinery, calibrating it for the sole purpose of consuming pastry faster than anyone else. Now, that same body felt like a leaden, useless weight. The expanded lung capacity he had worked for was useless here; it was a machine breathing for Leo. The strong jaw was useless; it could not form the words to make this right. He felt like an idiot, a child who had been playing with toys while the house burned down around him, and the shame was a physical, burning presence.\n\nCarol, the nurse from the night before, appeared at his side near mid-morning, her face etched with the same gentle exhaustion as his own. She held a styrofoam cup of coffee in one hand. \"You're still here,\" she said, not as a question, but a statement of tired fact. \"You need to get some rest, love. And some food. You'll do him no good if you collapse.\" She offered the coffee, but Baz just stared at it as if it were poison. The idea of consumption, of fuelling the body he now despised, was repulsive. \"Can't,\" he mumbled, shaking his head. \"I'm not hungry.\" The thought of food, any food, but especially the rich, savoury taste of pie, brought a fresh surge of bile to the back of his throat. His former passion was now a source of deep physical revulsion, a penance he would pay with an empty stomach and the gnawing ache of hunger.\n\nHe was staring at the drip rate of the IV bag, trying to find meaning in the slow, methodical fall of each clear drop, when his phone buzzed on the chair beside him. He ignored it. It buzzed again, insistent. Annoyed, thinking it might be a friend he didn't have the strength to talk to, he glanced at the screen. The name displayed was 'Australian Pie Association'. Janice. For a second, he felt nothing but a blank confusion, as if seeing a name from a language he no longer spoke. Then, a hot, black rage surged through him, so potent it made his vision swim. He snatched the phone, his thumb swiping across the screen, his voice a low growl. \"What?\" The crisp, professional voice from the day before, from another lifetime, chirped on the other end. \"Mr. O'Connell? Janice from the APA. I just wanted to confirm you received our email and see if you had any initial questions about the travel arrangements for Melbourne\u2014\"\n\n\"My brother is in a coma,\" Baz cut her off, the words like stones in his mouth, each one a separate, heavy agony. \"He's in the ICU on a ventilator because some bastard smashed into him on the freeway. So you can take your Golden Crust, and your travel arrangements, and your whole bloody pathetic competition, and you can shove it.\" There was a stunned, sputtering silence on the other end, the beginning of a half-formed apology that he had no intention of hearing. Baz jabbed the 'end call' button with a furious finality and dropped the phone onto the vacant part of Leo\u2019s bed. It landed softly on the blanket, a silent, useless black rectangle. The great monument to his ambition had been officially demolished in a single, brutal sentence.\n\nHe felt no triumph in the act, no release. Just a vast, hollow emptiness where the pride and excitement used to be. He had shed his old identity, the champion pie-eater, the scaffolder with a dream. It had sloughed off him like a dead skin, leaving behind something raw and exposed. All that was left was the man sitting in the hard plastic chair. All that was left was Leo\u2019s brother. He reached out and wrapped his huge hand around his brother's foot, the flesh beneath the thin blanket surprisingly cool. The contact was a desperate, grounding act. \"It's just us now, mate,\" he whispered to the still figure, the sound swallowed by the hum of the machines. \"Just us.\"## Chapter 3\n\nThe next two days bled into one another, a monotonous grey smear of time measured in nursing shifts and the changing numbers on Leo\u2019s monitors. Baz became part of the ward's furniture, a large, silent figure perpetually folded into the uncomfortable visitor's chair. He learned the rhythms of the ICU: the hushed early morning handover between the night and day staff, the midday doctor\u2019s rounds, the quiet lull of the afternoon, the slow dimming of the lights as evening settled in. He spoke only when spoken to, answering the doctors\u2019 gentle, non-committal updates with a terse nod and the nurses\u2019 questions about his own wellbeing with a shake of his head. He was a statue of grief, rooted to the spot by a leaden combination of guilt and dread. His old life, the one filled with the roar of construction sites and the scent of baking pastry, felt like a story someone had once told him about a different person.\n\nHis body, once a finely tuned instrument of glorious, pointless ambition, was now just a source of dull, persistent pain. His back ached from the chair, a deep, grinding discomfort that he welcomed as a form of penance. Hunger was a hollow knot in his stomach, a constant reminder of his revulsion. He couldn\u2019t bring himself to eat. The nurses, Carol and Ben, would leave sandwiches or cups of soup on the small table by the door, but he ignored them until they were quietly cleared away, untouched. The only thing he forced himself to do was drink the water they brought him, a grim parody of his old training regimen. He would swallow the cold, tasteless liquid, feeling it fill his empty stomach not to stretch it for a competition, but simply to keep his body from shutting down completely. It was a mechanical act of self-preservation for which he felt no motivation beyond a primal instinct he couldn't quite extinguish.\n\nOn the third day, his phone, which he now kept on silent, lit up with a call from 'Mick the Mouth', his site foreman. For a moment, Baz just stared at it, the name a relic from a buried civilisation. He finally answered, stepping out into the corridor so his voice wouldn't disturb the ward\u2019s sacred quiet. \"Yeah,\" he grunted. \"Baz, mate, where the hell are you?\" Mick\u2019s voice boomed, full of gravel and worksite bonhomie. \"The lads are asking. You didn't show Monday, or yesterday. Everything alright? Pull a sickie and get lost on the piss?\" The casual assumption, so normal just a week ago, was now a profound insult. \"It's my brother,\" Baz said, his voice flat and dead. \"He's in hospital. Bad car accident.\" The line went quiet. Mick\u2019s tone, when he spoke again, was different, stripped of its usual bluster. \"Jesus, Baz. I'm sorry, mate. Shit. Is he\u2026 how is he?\" Baz recited the sterile litany\u2014ICU, coma, head injury\u2014with the tired precision of a man who had said the words too many times to himself. \"Look, mate, you just stay there,\" Mick said, his voice earnest. \"Don't you worry about work. I'll sort the roster. Just\u2026 you call me if you need anything. Anything at all, you hear?\" Baz hung up without replying, the offer of help feeling like it was coming from across an ocean. He was in a lifeboat with Leo, and everyone else was on a distant shore.\n\nWhen the suffocating quiet of Leo's room became too much, he would pace the corridors or sit in the main waiting area, a purgatory of uncomfortable chairs and outdated magazines. He started to recognise the other silent, haunted figures who shared his vigil. There was a young woman with purple-dyed hair who was always there, endlessly scrolling through pictures on her phone, her face a mask of numb despair. There was an older Italian couple who would arrive every morning with a small bag of food and sit holding hands, praying softly with a rosary. They never spoke to each other, this small, fractured community of watchers, but a silent understanding passed between them in weary, sidelong glances. They were all members of the same terrible club, initiated by a late-night phone call and bound by the hum and beep of life-sustaining machines.\n\nThe messages from his father tracked the agonisingly slow journey from the other side of the world. *Landed in Dubai. 6 hour layover.* *Boarding for Perth now. See you soon, son.* Each text was a small explosion of anxiety in Baz\u2019s chest. He had been alone in his grief, cocooned in the sterile bubble of the ICU. Soon he would have to share it. He would have to witness his mother's raw pain and his father's stoic, crumbling fa\u00e7ade. He would have to be the strong one, the one who had been on the ground, the one who knew the doctors' names and the nursing shifts. He found himself dreading their arrival almost as much as he craved it, the thought of their collective sorrow in one small room feeling like a weight that could crush them all.\n\nAn hour before they were due to arrive from the airport, Baz went into the small public bathroom near the waiting area. He splashed his face with cold water, the shock of it doing little to wake him from his stupor. He stared at his reflection in the cheap, steel-framed mirror and barely recognised the man looking back. His normally sun-browned face was pale and sallow, his eyes bloodshot and sunk deep into their sockets, ringed with dark purple smudges of exhaustion. A rough, patchy beard was invading the hard line of his jaw. He looked hollowed out, a ghost haunting his own skin. He thought of the triumphant, roaring man in the sun-scorched backyard, the man who had tasted a future paved with flaky pastry, and felt a bitter, empty laugh rise in his throat. That man was gone, maybe forever. He took a deep, shuddering breath, straightened his shoulders, and tried to arrange his features into a mask of grim competence. His parents would need him to be solid. He had to be the rock. The main event was about to begin.He saw them through the glass of the automatic doors before they saw him. They looked smaller than he remembered, and infinitely more fragile, as if the twenty-four-hour flight had aged them a decade. His mother, Mary, was leaning on his father\u2019s arm, her face a pale, crumpled mask of anxiety. His father, Frank, stood ramrod straight, but the effort of it was visible in the tight set of his jaw and the deep lines etched around his eyes. The doors hissed open and they saw him. His mother let out a small, wounded sound and rushed forward, her embrace a desperate, clinging thing that spoke of terror and a frantic need for reassurance. Baz wrapped his arms around her thin, trembling frame, smelling the faint, recycled air of the airplane cabin on her coat, and felt a fresh crack appear in his own fragile composure.\n\nFrank followed, placing a heavy hand on Baz\u2019s shoulder. His own hug was brief and awkward, the stiff embrace of a man who used actions, not affection, to express his love. \"Barry,\" he said, his voice raspy from the dry cabin air. He cleared his throat, his eyes scanning his son's face, taking in the exhaustion and despair. \"The doctor\u2026 what's the latest?\" The question was direct, a demand for facts in a situation that defied logic, a desperate attempt to find a solid handhold in a landslide of emotion. Baz\u2019s own words felt like they were dredged from the bottom of a well. He recited the cold facts\u2014the surgery, the hematoma, the induced coma\u2014his voice a monotone that barely disturbed the air.\n\n\"This way,\" Baz said finally, his voice sounding hollow to his own ears. He led them from the relative chaos of the main waiting room down the quiet, sterile corridor that had become his entire world. With each step, he could feel their dread mounting, mirroring the terror he had felt on his own first journey down this hall. He was the unwilling tour guide to the worst moment of their lives, and the responsibility was suffocating. He paused outside the glass wall of Leo\u2019s bay, taking a deep breath before he had to present his broken brother to his parents, steeling himself for the impact it would have.\n\nHe pushed the door open. Mary\u2019s hand flew to her mouth, and a strangled sob escaped, a sound of pure maternal agony that cut through the clinical beeping of the machines. She took a few stumbling steps towards the bed, her eyes fixed on Leo\u2019s still, pale face, the tube, the wires. \"Oh, my boy,\" she whispered, her voice shattering. \"My baby boy.\" She reached out a trembling hand but hesitated, as if afraid to touch him, to confirm the reality of it. Frank stood frozen in the doorway, his face ashen. The rigid control he had maintained dissolved, leaving behind a raw, naked pain that was more shocking than any tears. He stared at his younger son, the one who had gone to uni, the one with the bright future, now reduced to a collection of vital signs on a glowing screen. The sight seemed to rob him of breath, of strength, of hope.\n\n\"The machine breathes for him,\" Baz heard himself say, his voice a detached monotone. \"It helps his body rest. The doctor said the swelling in his brain is the main thing. We just\u2026 we have to wait for it to go down.\" The words were a script he had learned by heart, and reciting them now, to his parents, felt like a betrayal. He was explaining the mechanics of the tragedy, sanitising the horror. He felt his father\u2019s hand on his back, a brief, steadying pressure. Frank had moved to Mary's side, guiding her gently into the chair Baz had vacated. She finally reached out and took Leo\u2019s hand, her fingers wrapping around his, her other hand stroking his hair, murmuring to him in a low, continuous stream of love and encouragement, as if her voice alone could call him back from the silent depths.\n\nFrank pulled another chair over, and for a long moment, the three of them simply sat, a silent, grieving tableau united by the rhythmic hiss of the ventilator. The arrival of his parents had changed the room\u2019s atmosphere. It was no longer just Baz\u2019s private hell; it was a shared family catastrophe. After what felt like an eternity, Frank turned his gaze from Leo to his older son. He took in Baz's ragged appearance for the first time\u2014the sunken eyes, the stubble, the way his large frame seemed to have shrunk inside his clothes. \"Son,\" he said, his voice low and firm. \"You look like hell. When did you last eat something?\" The question, so simple and paternal, landed with the force of a physical blow. Baz just shook his head, unable to speak. The thought of food was still a violation. \"We're going to the cafeteria,\" Frank stated, not a suggestion but a command. \"You and me. Your mother will stay with him. You're no good to anyone like this.\" He stood up, a quiet, unshakeable authority radiating from him. For the first time in days, someone was telling Baz what to do, and the tired, broken part of him found he hadn't the strength to resist.The hospital cafeteria at night was a starkly-lit pocket of soulless functionality. The air smelled of burnt coffee and floor polish, a thin, unappetizing aroma that did nothing to stir the appetite. Frank navigated the short, empty queue with a grim purpose, returning with two plastic trays. On each was a plate bearing a dry-looking chicken schnitzel, a scoop of pale mashed potato, and a scattering of overcooked peas. He placed one in front of Baz and sat down opposite him, his movements economical and deliberate. \u201cEat,\u201d he commanded, picking up his own knife and fork.\n\nBaz stared at the plate. The food looked alien, an obscene offering in the face of his brother's silent battle upstairs. The schnitzel\u2019s breaded coating was the colour of sawdust, a pale mockery of the golden-brown pastry that had once been the centre of his universe. The thought made him feel sick. He pushed the tray away slightly, the plastic legs scraping on the linoleum. \"I can't, Dad.\"\n\nFrank put his cutlery down with a sharp clatter that made Baz flinch. He leaned forward, his gaze intense and unwavering. \u201cYour mother is up there, falling to pieces. Leo is fighting for his life. And you are sitting here, starving yourself like a bloody martyr. Who does that help, Barry? Does it help Leo? Does it help your mother? Does it help you?\u201d He jabbed a finger towards the plate. \u201cIt helps no one. So you will pick up that fork, you will cut that piece of chicken, and you will put it in your mouth. You will do it because I am telling you to. And you will do it because you need to be strong for them. We don't have the luxury of falling apart. Not yet.\u201d\n\nThe words were hard, brutal, and exactly what Baz needed to hear. They were a slap in the face, a violent jolt back to the world of the living. Shamed by the truth in his father's logic, Baz slowly pulled the tray back. His hands felt clumsy, his movements stiff, as if he were re-learning how to use his own body. He picked up the fork, the metal cool and heavy in his hand. He cut a small piece of the schnitzel and lifted it to his mouth. The texture was dry and tough, the taste was nothing, but he forced himself to chew, to swallow. It felt like swallowing sand. He took another bite, and then another, the mechanical action a form of obedience.\n\nThey ate in silence for several minutes. Frank seemed to sense that the spell of Baz\u2019s self-imposed fast was broken and did not push him further. Finally, his father put down his fork, his own plate half-eaten. \u201cNow,\u201d he said, his voice softer but no less firm. \u201cTell me about your day. The day it happened. Not just the accident. The whole thing.\u201d\n\nBaz kept his eyes fixed on the sad collection of peas remaining on his plate. He didn\u2019t want to revisit it, to give voice to the joy that now felt like a terrible sin. But his father\u2019s unwavering gaze demanded it. So he began. He spoke of the suffocating heat, the lethargy of the afternoon, and then the first phone call. He described the woman's crisp voice, the shock, the wild, pure elation of hearing he had made the final. He recounted his roar of triumph, the cold victory of the first beer, the feeling of invincibility. He forced himself to say the name out loud, a name that felt blasphemous in this sterile, hopeless place. \"The Golden Crust Championship,\" he mumbled, his voice thick with shame. \"It's\u2026 it was a professional pie-eating competition.\"\n\nHe braced himself for his father\u2019s reaction: a shake of the head, a dismissive sigh, a look of disappointment that his eldest son\u2019s greatest ambition was so profoundly absurd. He risked a glance at Frank, expecting to see a mask of weary disdain. But his father's expression was one of deep, quiet concentration. He was simply listening. So Baz kept talking. He told him about the call to Leo, about the teasing, the affectionate insults, the casual sign-off that was now seared into his brain. \u201cHe called me a madman,\u201d Baz whispered, the memory raw. \u201cHe was laughing.\u201d\n\nWhen he finished, the silence returned, heavier than before. Baz felt hollowed out, having confessed the full, shameful arc of his day, from its triumphant peak to its catastrophic end. Frank picked up a sachet of salt and slowly tore it open, sprinkling it over his remaining potatoes with a focused precision. \u201cThis pie thing,\u201d he said, not looking at Baz. \u201cLeo knew about it?\u201d\n\u201cYeah. He called it \u2018structured gluttony\u2019. He was always on at me about my cholesterol.\u201d\n\u201cBut he followed it, didn't he?\u201d Frank asked. \u201cHe knew you were in the qualifiers. He knew what it meant to you.\u201d\nBaz nodded, a lump forming in his throat. \u201cYeah. He did.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d his father said, finally meeting his gaze. His eyes were clear, his expression devoid of judgment. \u201cSo you had a moment of success in something you worked for. And you shared it with your brother. And he was proud of you, in his own smart-arse way. That\u2019s not a sin, Barry. That\u2019s a good memory. It might be one of the last good ones you have of him laughing. The accident didn't happen because you were happy. It just\u2026 happened.\u201d He pushed his own plate away. \u201cWhat happened to Leo is a tragedy. What you\u2019re doing to yourself is a waste. He wouldn\u2019t want that. He\u2019d be calling you a self-pitying berk and telling you to get your act together.\u201d\n\nThe words, a near-perfect imitation of Leo\u2019s own brand of tough love, hit Baz with the force of a physical blow. A dry, shuddering sob escaped him, a sound ripped from a place of grief so deep he didn\u2019t know it existed. His father didn\u2019t move to comfort him, didn't offer a platitude. He just let him cry, sitting with him in the harsh fluorescent light of the cafeteria, a silent, solid presence that asked for nothing and offered everything. For the first time in three days, Baz felt a flicker of something other than guilt and despair. It wasn't hope, not yet. It was something far simpler: a foundation. The solid, unshakeable ground of his father\u2019s pragmatism beneath his feet.## Chapter 4\n\nReturning to the ICU felt different. The air was still thick with the same clinical tension, the machines still beeped and hissed their relentless rhythm, but the crushing weight on Baz\u2019s own chest had lifted, just slightly. It was still there, a dense, heavy stone of grief, but he could breathe around it now. He looked at his mother, asleep in the chair, her hand still loosely holding Leo's, her face looking impossibly old and frail in the dim light. He looked at his father, who gave him a small, affirmative nod from the other side of the bed. And he looked at Leo, pale and still, a landscape of tubes and wires. The guilt hadn\u2019t vanished, but his father\u2019s harsh words had cauterised the wound of it, transforming the raw, weeping self-pity into a hard, functional scar. He was no longer a martyr at a vigil; he was a soldier on watch.\n\nA new, grim routine established itself. Baz became the family's anchor in the shifting tides of hospital life. He was the one who met with the doctors each morning, absorbing their cautious, jargon-filled updates and translating them into plain language for his parents. He learned the names of the nurses, the patterns of the monitors, the subtle shifts in the ward's atmosphere that signalled a change, good or bad. He forced himself to eat the bland, starchy food his father brought him, each mouthful a conscious act of defiance against the despair that threatened to consume him. He started leaving the hospital for one hour each day, striding around the concrete car parks and manicured lawns with a long, aggressive gait, not to escape, but to endure. The sun felt alien on his skin, the sounds of traffic a dispatch from another planet, but he subjected himself to it, a daily, disciplined re-entry into a world he no longer felt part of.\n\nHis phone, once a source of terror and shame, slowly became a tool again. Mick from work called to say the lads on site had passed a helmet around and wanted to know where to send the money. This time, Baz didn\u2019t snarl. He found his voice, thanked Mick, and gave him the details, his tone even and methodical. It was a conversation about logistics, and logistics were manageable. Friends from his footy club sent a stream of texts: *Thinking of you, mate. Let us know if you need anything.* He started to reply with a brief, \"Thanks. Will do.\" He was rebuilding the perimeter walls of his life, not as they were, but as they needed to be now: functional, fortified, and devoid of unnecessary sentiment.\n\nOne afternoon, sitting in the waiting room while his parents had a private moment with Leo, he idly flipped through a discarded newspaper. And there it was. A small article buried in the lifestyle section, a fluff piece about the upcoming National Golden Crust Championship in Melbourne. It featured a picture of last year\u2019s winner, a skinny man from Tasmania with a manic grin, holding a ludicrously oversized trophy shaped like a pie. Baz\u2019s stomach clenched in a familiar spasm of revulsion. He felt the heat rise in his face, the shame of his former obsession laid bare on the cheap newsprint. He started to crumple the page, to obliterate the stupid, triumphant grin and the ridiculous trophy.\n\nBut then his father\u2019s voice echoed in his mind, clear and firm as it had been in the cafeteria. *He was proud of you, in his own smart-arse way.* He stopped, his knuckles white around the crinkled paper. The last good memory. Leo's laugh, tinny over the phone. *You absolute madman.* The laughter hadn't been mocking; it had been affectionate, a celebration of his big brother's glorious, eccentric folly. Baz smoothed the page out on his knee, his calloused fingers tracing the outline of the trophy. The competition was no longer just about him. It was tangled up with Leo, with their final conversation. It was the last thing they had shared. He folded the article carefully and tucked it into his pocket, a strange and complicated secret.\n\nTwo days later, Dr. Reid found them in the family room. It was the first time they had all been summoned together since that first night, and the air crackled with a collective, held breath. \"We've been monitoring the pressure in Leo's brain,\" the doctor began, his face as professionally neutral as ever. \"The swelling has not gotten worse over the past forty-eight hours. It's stabilized. It's a small step, a very small one, but it is a step in the right direction. We're going to begin the process of slowly reducing the sedative medication to see if we can get a response.\" He held up a hand to quell the sudden, frantic surge of hope in Mary\u2019s eyes. \"This is not waking him up. It's a long process. We're just testing the waters. But it's progress.\"\n\nThe word hung in the air: *progress*. It wasn't a cure, it wasn't a promise, but it was the first piece of solid ground they had felt beneath their feet in over a week. His mother wept, but this time her tears were of relief, not just despair. His father squeezed his shoulder, a rare and powerful display of emotion. For Baz, the news landed differently. It was a signal. A crack of light in the oppressive darkness. It gave him an idea, a wild, illogical, and utterly insane plan that took root in the fertile ground of his grief and his father\u2019s advice. An idea only a madman would conceive. Leo\u2019s madman.\n\nThat night, after his parents had left for their nearby motel, exhausted but buoyed by the day's news, Baz sat alone by his brother\u2019s bed. The ICU was quiet, the lights low. He leaned in close to Leo's ear, the hiss of the ventilator a constant counterpoint to his words. \"They're gonna try and wake you up, you lazy bugger,\" he whispered, his voice thick. \"So you better be ready. You better start fighting.\" He paused, taking a deep breath. \"And I'm gonna do something, too. I'm going to get ready for Melbourne. For the Golden Crust.\" He said the words out loud for the first time since his angry phone call, and they tasted different now\u2014not of shame, but of purpose. \"I know, it's stupid. But you were laughing, mate. It was the last thing I heard you do. So I'm doing it. For you. A monument to glorious, pointless ambition, eh? Well, let's build it. You fight in here, and I'll fight out there. It's a deal.\"\n\nIt was a vow made to a silent man, a desperate bargain with an indifferent universe. It was a scaffold of purpose erected in the rubble of his life. Later, for the first time in nine days, he drove home. The small house was cold and smelled of stale air, a museum of a life that was no longer his. In the kitchen, the artisan pie still sat on the counter, a shrunken, mouldy fossil of his old ambition. He looked at it for a long moment, then picked it up without ceremony and dropped it into the bin. That part of his life was over. He wiped his hands, sat down at the rickety patio table where it had all begun, and opened his laptop. He didn't search for news on head injuries or recovery statistics. He navigated to the Australian Pie Association website and began to read, his face illuminated by the cold blue light of the screen. He studied the official pie weight, the diameter, the mandatory filling-to-pastry ratio, the specific blend of beef required. He was no longer Baz O\u2019Connell, dreamer. He was an athlete preparing for his event, an engineer studying a problem. His training was about to begin.The world outside the hospital walls became a gymnasium for Baz\u2019s grief. His morning runs along the Swan River were no longer about lung capacity; they were savage, punishing sprints. He would pound the pavement at dawn, the city\u2019s skyline a silent witness to his solitary war. He ran until his lungs burned with a fire that momentarily eclipsed the cold ache in his chest, until sweat blinded him and his legs screamed in protest. He ran for Leo, who couldn\u2019t move. He filled his lungs with the crisp morning air for Leo, whose every breath was a gift from a machine. It was a brutal, physical prayer, an act of motion against the terrifying stillness that had consumed his brother.\n\nHis house, once a refuge, transformed into a laboratory of pain and purpose. The kitchen became his training ground. After his father\u2019s words in the cafeteria, Baz had made a decision. He would not just train; he would dominate. He drove to a commercial bakery supply store and bought three dozen standard-issue foil pie tins. Then he went to the butcher and bought kilos of chuck steak, a bag of flour, a block of lard. Following the specifications he\u2019d downloaded from the APA website, he began to bake. The process was mechanical, devoid of any culinary joy. It was chemistry. He weighed the meat, measured the gravy thickeners, rolled the pastry to the precise millimetre. The first batch, ugly and imperfect, was for deconstruction. He sat at his kitchen table with a pie, a notepad, and a stopwatch, a surgeon preparing for a complex operation. He timed how long it took for the crust to yield, how long to clear the first mouthful, the optimal moment to use a gulp of water to clear his palate and throat. He catalogued heat retention, structural integrity, the way the filling sagged once the pastry shell was breached. It was the science of structured gluttony, and he was its most dedicated student.\n\nThe eating itself was a new form of torture. He would line the pies up on the counter, ten at a time, a row of identical, golden-brown discs of misery. He would start the stopwatch and begin. There was no pleasure, no savouring of flavour. It was a mechanical process of ingestion. Break, scoop, chew, swallow. Sip of water. Repeat. His jaw, strengthened by weeks of chewing the rubber block, worked with a relentless, piston-like efficiency. His stomach, stretched by litres of water, churned and rebelled. He would often finish a session leaning over the kitchen sink, his body convulsing, trying to reject the sheer volume of food he had forced into it. But he never let it. He would swallow the bile, take deep, shuddering breaths, and mark his time on the notepad. Each session was a battle fought and won, another small, agonising step on the road to Melbourne.\n\nOne afternoon, Frank let himself into the house, bringing a bag of clean laundry. He found Baz in the kitchen, halfway through a training run. Baz was pale, a sheen of sweat on his forehead, his eyes glazed with a fierce, inward focus. Six empty pie tins sat in a messy stack, and he was just starting on the seventh. He didn't seem to notice his father enter. Frank stopped in the doorway, his face a mixture of confusion and concern. He took in the scene: the almost manic intensity on his son\u2019s face, the pile of empty tins, the notepad covered in times and frantic scribbles. He looked at the pie in Baz\u2019s hand, the rich gravy dripping onto the counter, and then back at his son\u2019s hollowed-out eyes. He opened his mouth to say something, to tell him this was madness, but then he closed it. He saw not a man enjoying a feast, but a man performing a gruelling, self-inflicted task. He saw the discipline. He saw the work.\n\nFrank walked quietly to the sink, put the bag of laundry on a chair, and poured a tall glass of water from the tap. He placed it on the counter next to Baz\u2019s elbow, within easy reach. Baz flinched, startled from his trance, his eyes clearing for a moment as he saw his father. He braced himself for the lecture, the intervention. But Frank just nodded towards the glass. \"Hydration,\" he said, his voice level. \"You'll cramp up otherwise.\" He looked at the notepad. \"What's the record?\" Baz, momentarily thrown, stared at his father, then down at his notes. \"Twelve pies in ten minutes. Official record is fifteen,\" he mumbled, his mouth half-full. Frank nodded again, a flicker of something unreadable in his eyes\u2014not approval, but a kind of grim understanding. \"Well,\" he said, turning to leave. \"You'd better get back to it then. You're losing time.\"\n\nThe contrast between his two lives was a constant, dizzying shock. He would leave the house, his stomach a leaden, churning ball, the smell of baked meat clinging to his clothes, and drive back to the hushed, sterile world of the ICU. He would wash his hands with antibacterial soap until they were raw, trying to scrub away the scent of his training before he entered Leo\u2019s room. He would take his seat, his own body aching and bloated, and look at his brother, who was sustained by clear, colourless liquids in a bag. The absurdity of it all was a constant companion. One evening, after a particularly gruelling session, he leaned close to Leo's ear. \"Fourteen today, mate,\" he whispered, his voice hoarse. \"Hit a wall at twelve, but I pushed through. The pastry was a bit flaky on the last batch, cost me a few seconds. Need to add more shortening.\" He paused, placing his hand over his brother\u2019s. \"They took another tube out today. Dad said you squeezed Mum's hand. Or she thinks you did. So keep it up. You do your bit, I'll do mine. It's a deal.\"## Chapter 5\n\nThe first real sign of progress was almost imperceptible, a clinical detail that would have meant nothing to an outsider. Dr. Reid, during his morning rounds a week after Baz's parents had arrived, was performing a routine reflex test, tapping the sole of Leo's foot with a small instrument. Leo\u2019s toes curled. It was a faint, involuntary spasm, but it was a response. It was a signal from the deep, silent darkness, a flicker of neurological function where there had been none. Dr. Reid called it \"a positive development\" in his calm, measured tone, but to Baz, the words were a thunderclap. He felt a jolt of pure, electric energy, as if he had been physically struck. The deal was working. The message had been received. That afternoon, he drove to a specialty sports store and bought a weighted vest, adding ten kilos of resistance to his punishing morning runs, a new tithe of pain offered up to the god of his brother\u2019s recovery.\n\nHis training evolved from a grim duty into a fanatical obsession, a science of applied madness. He wasn\u2019t just eating anymore; he was studying. He spent hours online, not looking up medical journals, but scouring grainy footage from obscure competitive eating forums. He found videos of last year's Golden Crust champion, a wiry, frenetic man from Tasmania known as \"The Masticator,\" and watched them on a loop, his face inches from the laptop screen. He broke down the man's technique frame by frame, his notepad filling with diagrams and observations. He noted the way The Masticator used his left hand to crumple and fold the far edge of the pie crust inwards, creating a dam to stop the hot gravy from spilling. He analysed the specific angle of his head tilt to aid swallowing, the precise two-chew-one-gulp rhythm that minimized jaw fatigue. Baz would stand in front of his bathroom mirror, practicing the crimp-and-fold technique with a slice of untoasted bread, his reflection a bizarre parody of a man preparing for a title fight.\n\nHis father became his unwilling, silent accomplice. Frank started spending his afternoons not at the hospital, but in the tense, gravy-scented atmosphere of Baz\u2019s kitchen. He\u2019d arrive without a word, put the kettle on, and watch. He saw the plateaus, the moments where Baz would stare at the eighth or ninth pie, his body refusing to cooperate, his face pale with frustration and a flicker of panic. One afternoon, Frank walked over, picked up the stopwatch from the counter, and clicked it. \u201cGo again,\u201d he said, his voice flat. Baz, startled, looked up. His father\u2019s face was unreadable, but his stance was that of a coach, not a concerned parent. So Baz began. \u201cToo slow on the crust,\u201d Frank barked after the first pie. \u201cYou\u2019re losing two seconds on the turn. Stop thinking, just do it.\u201d He became Baz\u2019s timekeeper, his strategist, his corner man. He would call out splits, critique his form, and have a tall glass of water ready at the precise moment Baz\u2019s rhythm faltered. It was a strange, unspoken partnership, a father helping his son build a monument to pointless ambition because he understood, without ever saying it, that it was the only thing holding him together.\n\nThen, a setback. Leo developed a low-grade fever, a common complication, a minor infection that the doctors treated with a new course of antibiotics. They were calm, reassuring. To Baz, it was a catastrophe. The deal had been broken. He had failed. He hadn't pushed hard enough; his sacrifice had been insufficient. The guilt, which had receded to a manageable scar, tore open again, raw and bleeding. That night, he ran until the streetlights blurred into smeared lines of light, until his vision tunnelled and he collapsed, retching, onto a grass verge, his body convulsing with dry heaves. He had let his brother down. The thought was a physical torment, far worse than the ache in his muscles or the fire in his lungs.\n\nThe fever broke within thirty-six hours. Leo's condition stabilized, his vital signs returning to their previous baseline. The relief that washed over Baz was so profound it left him weak-kneed, but it was laced with a new, frantic desperation. He had to do more. The home kitchen was no longer enough. His training needed to be harder, a truer test of his resolve. One evening, he packed a cooler with a dozen freshly baked pies and several bottles of water and drove to a deserted local park. Under the lonely, buzzing glow of a single sodium lamp, surrounded by the sleeping quiet of the suburbs, he laid out his pies on a park bench and began. He ate against the clock, the night air cool on his sweat-drenched face, a lone dog-walker staring at him from the far side of the oval with a mixture of fear and bewilderment. Baz met the stranger's gaze, his own eyes wild and determined, his jaw working relentlessly. He was Leo\u2019s madman, and he would no longer hide it.\n\nThe competition was now less than two weeks away. The flights his father had quietly booked for him were a stark reality in his email inbox. It was time for a final, all-out assault. Baz declared his intention to his father: he was going to break the record. Sixteen pies. Not in Melbourne, but here, now, in his kitchen. It was his final offering before he left. Frank, his face set in a grim mask of resolve, stood ready with the stopwatch. The scene was primal. Baz was an engine of pure consumption, his movements stripped of all hesitation. Break, scoop, chew, swallow. The first ten pies went down in a blur of focused, painful efficiency. By twelve, his body was in open revolt. A wave of nausea, cold and sharp, rose in his throat. \u201cBreathe!\u201d Frank commanded, his voice cutting through the fog of pain. \u201cThrough your nose. Slower. Control it.\u201d Baz fought it down, his knuckles white where he gripped the edge of the counter. He got through thirteen, then fourteen. He slammed the fifteenth empty tin onto the stack, a clatter of triumph, and reached for the last one. His hand trembled. He couldn\u2019t. The wall was absolute. \u201cCome on, Barry!\u201d his father roared, a lifetime of stoic reserve channelled into that single, desperate command. \u201cFor Leo! Finish it!\u201d The name was a key, unlocking a final, hidden reserve of will. Baz snatched the pie, tore into it with a savage grunt, and forced it down in three monstrous, agonizing swallows. He threw the empty tin onto the pile and collapsed back into his chair, gasping, his body trembling, every muscle screaming. He had done it. Just as he dragged a ragged breath into his burning lungs, his phone, lying on the counter, began to ring. It was his mother. He stared at it, too exhausted to move, until Frank snatched it up and put it on speaker. \u201cMary? What is it?\u201d His mother\u2019s voice came through, high and broken, but not with grief. It was a sound of pure, unadulterated ecstasy. \u201cFrank! Oh, Frank! He opened his eyes! The doctor was here, he was talking to him, and he opened his eyes! He looked at me!\u201d Baz slowly lifted his head. His gaze met his father\u2019s across the wreckage of his training session. A single tear, hot and clean, cut a path through the sweat and grime on his cheek. The world was silent except for his mother\u2019s joyful, weeping voice and the frantic, triumphant beat of his own heart. The deal was real. He was going to Melbourne.The world was silent except for his mother\u2019s joyful, weeping voice and the frantic, triumphant beat of his own heart. The deal was real. He was going to Melbourne. Frank took the phone, his own voice thick as he murmured reassurances to his wife, promising they\u2019d be there soon. When he ended the call, he didn\u2019t immediately move. He stood looking at his son, at the wreckage of the sixteen pies, at the tear tracking a clean path through the grime on Baz\u2019s cheek. The stoic mask he had worn for weeks finally cracked, not with a sob, but with a slow, weary exhalation that seemed to release all the tension he had been holding in his rigid frame. He walked over to Baz, not to clap him on the back or offer a word of praise, but to place a hand on his son\u2019s trembling shoulder. The grip was firm, a silent acknowledgment of the madness he had witnessed and enabled, a shared testament to the desperate, illogical, and miraculously successful bargain they had made.\n\nThe drive to the hospital was a surreal blur. The physical agony of his training session had evaporated, replaced by a humming, high-voltage current of pure adrenaline. He felt light, untethered, as if he could float out of the driver\u2019s seat. The city lights of Perth, which for weeks had seemed like distant, mocking constellations, were now sharp and brilliant, each one a celebration. He was no longer a ghost haunting the periphery of the world; he was hurtling towards its very centre. Frank sat in the passenger seat, silent, the dark landscape flashing across his face. There was nothing to say. Words were inadequate for the strange, sacred territory they had just traversed. They had stared into the abyss of grief and offered up a sacrifice of meat and pastry, and the abyss had blinked.\n\nThe atmosphere in the ICU had been transformed. The usual hushed tension was gone, replaced by a palpable, buzzing warmth. Mary was sitting by the bed, her face illuminated by a joy so profound it seemed to make her glow. She was holding Leo\u2019s hand, talking to him in a soft, steady stream, her voice no longer a desperate plea but a happy recounting of family stories. Leo was awake. His eyes, the same intelligent, deep-set eyes as his father's, were open. They were cloudy with medication and confusion, moving slowly, struggling to focus. The ventilator was gone, replaced by a small, clear tube delivering oxygen through his nose. He was breathing on his own. The sight was so overwhelming that Baz had to stop in the doorway, his hand braced against the frame to steady himself. This was victory, raw and absolute, and it was more terrifyingly beautiful than any trophy.\n\nBaz approached the bed slowly, his heavy boots silent on the linoleum floor. His mother looked up, her tear-streaked face breaking into a radiant smile. \"He's here, Leo,\" she whispered. \"Your big brother is here.\" Leo's gaze drifted from the ceiling and found Baz. For a long, silent moment, he just looked. There was a flicker in his eyes, a spark of recognition in the hazy depths, a faint furrowing of his brow as he tried to connect the haggard, triumphant figure before him to the brother he remembered. Baz knelt by the bed, bringing his face level with Leo's. \"Hey, you cheeky bugger,\" he said, his voice a low, rough rumble. \"About time you woke up. I hit sixteen today. Broke the record. Told you I would.\" He reached out and took Leo's free hand. It was weak, but the fingers curled, a deliberate, undeniable pressure. Leo\u2019s lips moved, a dry, faint whisper of a sound, too soft to be a word but more articulate than any speech. It was an answer.\n\nThat evening, the three of them sat in the bleak hospital cafeteria, the plastic trays of food untouched. It was a family conference under the fluorescent lights. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to go, Barry,\u201d Mary said, her voice soft. \u201cNow that Leo\u2019s\u2026 now that he\u2019s awake, you could stay.\u201d She wanted her family whole, her sons safe under her watch. Baz understood, but he shook his head. The purpose that had solidified in him was now unbreakable. Before he could explain, Frank spoke, his voice firm, cutting through the emotional haze. \u201cHe has to go,\u201d he said, looking not at Baz but at his wife. \u201cHe made a deal. A promise. You don\u2019t get a miracle and then walk away from your end of the bargain.\u201d He turned to Baz, his eyes holding a new respect. \u201cYou go to Melbourne. You finish this. Your mother and I will be right here. Leo will be here. He\u2019ll be watching.\u201d He understood completely. It was no longer about winning or losing. It was about seeing it through. It was about honour.\n\nThe morning of his flight, Baz stood by Leo\u2019s bedside for the last time. His bag was packed, his ticket was on his phone, and a taxi was waiting downstairs. Leo was more alert now, the fog beginning to lift. He could track conversations, his eyes following them around the room. A speech therapist had been in, and the first raspy, single-word answers were beginning to surface. Baz leaned down, the familiar scent of antiseptic now a smell of recovery, not crisis. \u201cI\u2019m off, mate,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ll have it on one of the sports channels. Tell Dad to find it for you.\u201d He squeezed his brother\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI\u2019ll bring you back that stupid trophy.\u201d Leo\u2019s eyes were fixed on him, his expression serious. His hand lifted a few inches from the bed, a weak but determined gesture, and his fingers formed a fist. He held it there for a moment, a silent, powerful message of solidarity. Then his lips formed a single, raspy word, the first full word he had spoken to his brother since the accident. \"Win.\"The flight to Melbourne was a dislocating experience. For weeks, Baz\u2019s world had been circumscribed by the four walls of a hospital room and the punishing circuit of his training runs. Now, sealed in a pressurised cabin at thirty thousand feet, he was adrift in a sea of blue sky, suspended between the two poles of his existence: the grim reality of Perth and the absurd theatre of Melbourne. He sat crammed into a window seat, his broad shoulders pressing against the fuselage, the muted roar of the engines a monotonous hum that vibrated through his bones. He was surrounded by the casual normality of travel\u2014businessmen tapping on laptops, families shushing tired children, couples reading magazines\u2014and he felt like a foreign object, an artifact from another, harsher reality that had been mistakenly placed among them.\n\nHe looked down at his hands, resting on his knees. They were a scaffolder's hands, thick with calluses and mapped with old scars, but they felt different now. He had remade them, repurposed them. He had trained their grip and their dexterity not for steel and bolts, but for the specific task of dismantling pastry and meat with maximum efficiency. He was a weapon calibrated for a single, ludicrous purpose, and the knowledge sat strangely within the profound exhaustion that had settled deep in his marrow. The sixteen-pie ordeal had left his body feeling hollowed out and strung tight, but Leo\u2019s whispered command, \"Win,\" was a fire in the centre of that emptiness, burning away fatigue and doubt. He wasn't flying to a competition; he was flying to a reckoning.\n\nThe hotel in Melbourne was another shock to the system. It was a sleek, modern tower of glass and steel in the heart of the city, a world of hushed carpets, soft lighting, and staff who greeted him with unnervingly bright smiles. The Australian Pie Association had put the six finalists up in a place that reeked of corporate expense accounts and fleeting luxury. His room was on the 24th floor, with a floor-to-ceiling window that offered a breathtaking, panoramic view of a city that was not his own. It felt like an alien landscape, a sprawling grid of glittering lights and endless motion. He dropped his bag on the luggage rack and walked to the window, pressing his palm against the cool glass. Down below, life was moving on, oblivious. Up here, he was utterly alone, a solitary monk in a five-star cell, preparing for the most ridiculous and most important ten minutes of his life.\n\nA crisp white envelope was waiting for him on the polished desk. It contained the official schedule for the \"Finalist Weekend.\" There was a \"Welcome Mixer\" that evening, a \"Media Breakfast\" the next morning, followed by a press conference and a photo call at the competition venue. The language was upbeat and full of exclamation points, a grotesque counterpoint to the raw gravity of his mission. He crumpled the itinerary in his fist. He had no intention of mixing. He was not here to make friends or to give soundbites to lifestyle bloggers. He was here to do a job. His phone buzzed, and his heart leaped into his throat, the reflex of the past few weeks still potent. But it was just a text from his father: *Leo\u2019s asking the nurse for a real cup of tea. Being a pain in the arse. Good sign. Focus on your end.* A slow grin spread across Baz\u2019s face, the first genuine, uncomplicated smile in what felt like a lifetime. Leo was being Leo. The deal was holding. He smoothed out the crumpled schedule, his focus narrowing. The mixer was in an hour. He would go. Not to socialise, but to scout the opposition. To look his rivals in the eye.\n\nThe welcome mixer was held in a private bar on the hotel's mezzanine level, a space filled with low, jazzy music and the clinking of glasses. A large banner emblazoned with the Golden Crust logo and portraits of the finalists hung on one wall. Baz saw his own face up there, a grim, unsmiling photo taken from his driver's license, looking starkly out of place next to the grinning, publicity-shot visages of the others. He grabbed a glass of water from a passing waiter and found a shadowy corner from which to observe. It didn\u2019t take long to identify them. The Masticator\u2014real name Kevin\u2014was exactly as he appeared in the videos: a wiry, hyperactive man with darting eyes, holding court with a small group of APA officials, his hands gesturing wildly as he spoke. He radiated a nervous, crackling energy, a man who seemed to be vibrating at a higher frequency than everyone else.\n\nAcross the room, a young man with a carefully sculpted haircut and trendy glasses was taking a selfie with his plate of canap\u00e9s. This, Baz surmised, was \"Gastro-Boy\" from Sydney, a university student whose YouTube channel was dedicated to extreme eating challenges. He was all style and performative confidence, more interested in his brand than the contest itself. Then there was the old-timer, a portly, gentle-looking man in a rumpled suit named Stan, who stood quietly by the cheese platter, looking slightly bewildered by the whole affair. A woman with impressively toned arms and a competitive glint in her eye was deep in conversation with a journalist\u2014she was \"The Python\" from Queensland, a personal trainer who had crossed over from bodybuilding competitions. And finally, there was the other big bloke, a cheerful, red-faced truck driver from regional Victoria who introduced himself to everyone as \"Big Dave.\" He was loud, jovial, and seemed to be treating the entire weekend as a free holiday. They were a collection of hobbyists, show-offs, and journeymen. Baz watched them all, his face a stony, unreadable mask. They were here for a laugh, for a bit of fame, for a free feed. He was here for his brother. They weren't in the same competition at all.## Chapter 6\n\nThe media breakfast the next morning was a buffet of manufactured enthusiasm. Held in a sun-drenched conference room, it was a blur of chirpy radio hosts, earnest local news reporters, and lifestyle bloggers taking artfully arranged photos of croissants. The other finalists were in their element. Gastro-Boy was conducting an Instagram Live session, narrating his choice of fruit salad to his phone. The Masticator darted from table to table, a whirlwind of soundbites and frantic energy. Big Dave had a small crowd laughing as he recounted a story about a misadventure involving a roadhouse pie and a runaway emu. They were performers, and this was their stage.\n\nBaz sat at a table by himself, a solitary mountain of quiet menace amidst the forced conviviality. In front of him sat a single glass of water and a black coffee. He ignored the glistening pastries, the platters of cured meats, the steaming chafing dishes of scrambled eggs. His body was a machine, and this was not its fuel. He drank his water in slow, measured sips, his gaze distant, his mind a thousand miles away in a quiet hospital room in Perth. He was an observer, not a participant, and his stark disinterest was a more powerful statement than any boast. A young reporter approached him tentatively, notebook in hand. \u201cMr. O\u2019Connell? You\u2019re very focused. Any pre-game jitters?\u201d Baz\u2019s eyes met his, and the reporter visibly flinched at the cold, hard intensity he found there. \u201cNo,\u201d Baz said, his voice a low rumble. The reporter mumbled a thank you and scurried away.\n\nThe press conference was worse, a staged spectacle held in a small auditorium packed with media. The six finalists sat on a raised platform behind a long table draped in a Golden Crust banner. A slick, over-caffeinated host worked his way down the line, asking predictable questions that elicited predictable answers. Big Dave promised to \u201cdo the country proud.\u201d The Python spoke about \u201cmetabolic conditioning and mental fortitude.\u201d Gastro-Boy plugged his social media handles. When the host finally got to Baz, the last in the line, he seemed momentarily thrown by his silent, brooding presence. \u201cAnd finally, the dark horse from the West, Baz O\u2019Connell! Baz, you\u2019ve been the quiet man of the competition so far. What\u2019s your secret? What\u2019s motivating you to take home the Golden Crust?\u201d\n\nA hush fell over the room. All eyes were on him. This was the moment for a folksy anecdote, a confident boast, a charming display of ambition. Baz leaned forward, bringing his mouth close to the microphone. The air crackled with anticipation. \u201cI made a promise,\u201d he said. The two words dropped into the room like stones into a silent pond. He offered no explanation, no smile, no further detail. He just leaned back in his chair, his expression unchanging, his gaze fixed on a point on the back wall. The host, momentarily speechless, stammered for a second before quickly moving on, but a new kind of respect, mingled with confusion, had settled over the room. The other contestants glanced at him, their own easy confidence faltering for a moment in the face of his stark, unfathomable gravity.\n\nHe skipped the finalist luncheon, retreating to the sanctuary of his hotel room. The silence was a balm after the morning\u2019s circus. He stripped off the polo shirt the APA had insisted they all wear and stood in front of the vast window, looking out over the sprawling city. He wasn\u2019t seeing the towers or the traffic; he was seeing the face of his brother, the weak but determined fist, the single, raspy word: *Win*. He took out his phone and dialled. His mother answered, her voice tired but happy. Leo was out of the ICU and in a regular ward. He was complaining about the food and had argued with a nurse about the volume on the television. He was healing. He was coming back. \u201cPut him on,\u201d Baz said. There was a rustle, and then Leo\u2019s voice, stronger now, clearer, but still laced with the grit of his injuries. \u201cYou better not be calling to say you lost already.\u201d\n\nA laugh, a real, genuine laugh, escaped Baz\u2019s lips. It felt like a foreign sound. \u201cNot yet, dickhead. It\u2019s in a few hours.\u201d\n\u201cGood,\u201d Leo said. \u201cDon\u2019t come back without the stupid trophy. Dad\u2019s trying to figure out how to stream it on his phone. It\u2019s embarrassing.\u201d\n\u201cTell him I\u2019ll do my best,\u201d Baz said, his own voice thick with an emotion he couldn\u2019t name.\n\u201cDon\u2019t do your best,\u201d Leo\u2019s voice commanded, a sudden, fierce clarity cutting through the line. \u201cJust do it.\u201d\n\nThe call ended, leaving a profound stillness in the room. Just do it. The simple, brutal instruction was all he needed. He spent the next few hours in a state of meditative calm. He did the slow, deliberate stretches his father had taught him as a young footballer. He lay on the floor and practiced the deep, diaphragmatic breathing that would keep the panic at bay. He mentally rehearsed the first three minutes of the competition: the initial attack on the pie, the crimp-and-fold, the rhythm of chew and swallow, the precise timing of the first sip of water. He was a diver preparing to enter the crushing deep, a soldier field-stripping his weapon in the dark.\n\nAn hour before the event, a van collected them from the hotel lobby. The mood inside was a cacophony of nerves. The Masticator was bouncing his leg, muttering to himself. Big Dave was cracking dad jokes that no one was laughing at. Baz sat in the back, his eyes closed, a cocoon of silence in the midst of the nervous chatter. The competition was being held in a large, converted warehouse on the city\u2019s fringe, now packed with a roaring crowd and bathed in the hot, white glare of television lights. Backstage was a chaotic maze of cables, road cases, and harried-looking crew members. The smell hit him immediately: hot metal, baking pastry, and an overwhelming, industrial-grade wave of rich, dark gravy. To the others, it was the smell of glory. To Baz, it was the smell of the finish line.\n\nThey were led to a small holding area, a roped-off space with a few chairs and a table laden with bottles of water. The roar of the crowd was a constant, physical presence, a wave of sound that beat against the thin walls. The other finalists paced, stretched, and tried to psych each other out with last-minute bravado. Baz simply stood, his hands resting on the back of a chair, his breathing slow and even. He felt a strange and total calm descend upon him. He had run his race, he had paid his dues, he had offered up his sacrifice. All that was left was this final, absurd ceremony. A crew member with a headset bustled over. \u201cFive minutes, everyone! Let\u2019s get ready!\u201d The Masticator cracked his knuckles with a sound like a gunshot. The Python took a final, deep swig of water. Big Dave clapped his hands together with a loud, booming slap. Baz just closed his eyes and saw his brother\u2019s face. He was ready. A voice boomed over the PA system, cutting through the din, \"Finalists to the stage!\" and Baz O\u2019Connell, scaffolder and brother, stood up to finish the job.## Chapter 7\n\nWalking out onto the stage was like stepping into the heart of a furnace. A wall of sound from the packed crowd hit him first, a physical force that vibrated in his teeth, followed by the blinding white heat of the television lights. The air was thick with the scent of hot gravy and the electric tang of mass anticipation. The other finalists soaked it in. Big Dave waved to the crowd with both hands, a huge, folksy grin on his face. Gastro-Boy made a heart-shape with his hands, playing to a camera. The Masticator shadow-boxed the air, a bundle of frantic energy. Baz walked with the slow, deliberate tread of a man heading to a gallows or an altar. He didn't look at the crowd, didn't acknowledge the cameras. His gaze was fixed on the long table at the centre of the stage, on the empty chair with his name on it. He was a gladiator, and this was his arena. The noise, the lights, the spectacle\u2014it was all just weather.\n\nHis station was a small universe of its own. A stack of twenty pies, perfect golden discs of menace, sat to his left. Each was identical to the ones he had baked and forced down in his lonely kitchen, the official eight-centimetre diameter, the regulation 220-gram weight. To his right were four bottles of water, their labels stripped off. A large digital clock hung above the stage, its red numerals currently dark. The host, a man with a dazzling smile and a voice that never dipped below a shout, was doing his final introductions, his words a meaningless roar in the background. Baz sat down, adjusted the chair, and placed his hands flat on the table. He took one deep, slow breath, then another, pulling the air deep into the lungs he had so brutally conditioned. The world dissolved. There was no crowd, no host, no Masticator bouncing beside him. There was only the stack of pies, the water, and the promise. He heard Leo\u2019s voice, raspy but clear: *Win*. The clock above him lit up: 10:00.\n\nThe countdown began, a primal chant from the crowd led by the host. \"Ten! Nine! Eight!\" With each number, Baz's focus narrowed, the periphery of his vision greying out until all that remained was the single pie directly in front of him. \"Three! Two! One!\" A klaxon horn blared, a brutal, ugly sound that shattered the tension. In the same instant, Baz\u2019s hands moved. It wasn\u2019t a frantic grab, but a swift, practiced motion. His left hand seized the pie, his right hand, holding a plastic fork, plunged into its centre, breaking the crust with a soft, yielding crack. The Masticator was already a blur of motion beside him, shoving half a pie into his mouth at once. Big Dave attacked his with brute force, like a bear swiping at a honeycomb. Baz ignored them. He executed the crimp-and-fold, his left thumb expertly tucking the crust inwards to contain the molten filling. Break, scoop, chew twice, swallow. His movements were a brutal ballet, a sequence of violent efficiency he had rehearsed to the point of absolute instinct. The first pie was gone in twenty-two seconds. He dropped the empty tin onto the floor and his left hand was already reaching for the next.\n\nThe first three minutes were a blur of autonomous action. He was a machine performing its one, terrible function. The world was reduced to a rhythm: the soft crunch of pastry, the heat of the gravy, the muscular clench of his jaw, the hard swallow. After the third pie, he took a precisely timed sip of water, just enough to clear the accumulating clag from his throat without wasting precious stomach capacity. He could feel the heat building in his core, the first rumblings of protest from his body, but he walled it off, pushing the discomfort into a small, locked room in the back of his mind. His stack of empty tins grew with a steady, metronomic cadence. He didn't look up, didn't check the clock, didn't glance at his rivals. The plan was the plan. The only opponent was himself.\n\nAt the five-minute mark, the halfway point, the wall arrived. It was a physical sensation, a sudden, violent lurch in his gut as his stomach screamed that it was full, that any more would be a violation. Cold sweat broke out on his brow. The rich, meaty flavour that had been merely functional now became actively nauseating. He was on his ninth pie, and the mouthful he had just taken refused to go down. He could feel the panic coiling, the primal urge to retch. *Breathe! Through your nose. Control it.* His father\u2019s voice, barked across the kitchen, echoed in his ears. He closed his eyes for a split second, forcing a long, slow breath through his nostrils. He pictured the hospital, the hiss of the ventilator, the fragile, stubborn line of Leo\u2019s heartbeat on the monitor. He swallowed. The mouthful went down. He opened his eyes, picked up the fork, and went back to work.\n\nThe host\u2019s voice, amplified to a deafening roar, cut through his concentration. \u201cIt\u2019s a two-horse race, ladies and gentlemen! The Masticator from Tassie and the big man from the West are neck-and-neck at twelve pies apiece! But look at the technique! O\u2019Connell is clean, precise, a surgeon at work! Kevin is wearing half of his on his shirt!\u201d Baz risked a flicker of a glance to his side. The Masticator was a whirlwind of chaos, gravy smeared across his face and chest, his breathing ragged and shallow. He was fast, but he was losing energy, his frantic pace becoming unsustainable. Big Dave had slowed to a crawl, his face a dangerous shade of purple. Gastro-Boy had his head in his hands. The Python was steady but a full two pies behind. It was just him and the madman from Tassie.\n\nWith two minutes left on the clock, a profound and terrible clarity descended upon Baz. The pain was no longer a distraction; it was fuel. His body was a distant, screaming thing that he was no longer connected to. He was pure will. He finished his fourteenth pie, matching the number that had almost broken him in training, and reached for the fifteenth. His movements were still economical, but a new speed had entered them, an urgency born of desperation and purpose. He saw The Masticator falter, choking on a mouthful, his rhythm broken. It was the opening. This was the moment. *For Leo! Finish it!* His father\u2019s roar from that final training session detonated in his memory. He attacked the fifteenth pie with a savagery that startled even himself, demolishing it in a few monstrous, jaw-straining bites. He was reaching for the sixteenth as the clock ticked past the one-minute mark.\n\nThe final sixty seconds were an eternity of agony. Every swallow was a battle, every breath a conscious effort. The crowd was a single, continuous roar, a physical wave of sound pushing him forward. He was aware of nothing but the pie in his hand, the clock, and the promise. He finished the sixteenth pie, tying the record he had set in the lonely silence of his kitchen. The Masticator had stalled, coughing, at fifteen. Baz\u2019s hand, shaking uncontrollably, closed around the seventeenth pie. Ten seconds. He plunged his fork in. Nine. He raised it to his lips. Eight. The crowd was counting down. Seven. He forced a huge mouthful in. Six. He chewed once, a Herculean effort. Five. He swallowed, a searing, tearing motion. Four. Three. Two. He couldn't take another bite. He was done. One. The klaxon blared again, its final, deafening note cutting through the noise.\n\nSilence. In the sudden absence of the horn, the roar of the crowd seemed to double in volume, but for Baz, the world had gone utterly quiet. He dropped the half-eaten seventeenth pie onto the table. His hands, smeared with grease and gravy, were shaking violently. His entire body was trembling with a combination of massive adrenaline dump and profound physical trauma. He sagged back in his chair, his head lolling, his chest heaving as he dragged ragged, painful breaths into his tortured lungs. It was over. He had nothing left. He had given it all. He closed his eyes, and in the swirling darkness behind his eyelids, he saw a hospital room, a faint, recovering smile, and a brother who was alive.\n\nThe judges, in their crisp white coats, swarmed the stage. The host was screaming into his microphone, lost in the delirium of the moment. Baz didn\u2019t hear him. He was floating, disconnected. After what felt like a lifetime, a heavy, metallic object was thrust into his hands. It was the trophy. The ridiculous, oversized, golden pie. It was heavier than he expected. He opened his eyes and looked at it, this monument to his glorious, pointless ambition. He looked out at the roaring, faceless crowd, at the blinding lights, at the confetti that was beginning to fall from the ceiling. There was no joy, no elation, no triumphant roar. There was only a vast, bone-deep, and deeply peaceful sense of release. He had kept his promise. He had won. He lifted the trophy, not in a gesture of victory for the crowd, but as a silent salute to a hospital room a thousand miles away. He had done his part. He could finally go home.The aftermath was a strange, muffled chaos. The host was shouting something into his microphone, his voice a distorted boom in Baz\u2019s ears. People were slapping his back, their faces a blur of ecstatic grins. Flashbulbs strobed like lightning in a storm, imprinting bleached-out images onto the back of his eyelids. He felt a hand on his shoulder and turned to see The Masticator, his face wiped clean of gravy but still flushed with exertion. The wiry Tasmanian\u2019s eyes, which had been manic and wild, were now clear and held a look of profound, almost awestruck respect. He didn\u2019t say anything. He just nodded once, a sharp, definitive gesture, and clapped Baz on the shoulder before being swallowed by the throng.\n\nThe host, his professional smile unwavering, thrust the microphone back into Baz\u2019s face. \u201cUnbelievable! A new Golden Crust record! Baz O\u2019Connell, you came here as a dark horse, a man of few words. Now you\u2019re the king! What are you feeling right now? Tell Australia what this moment means to you!\u201d Baz looked past the man\u2019s perfect teeth, past the blinding lights, and found the unblinking red eye of a television camera. He knew that somewhere, on the other side of that lens, in a quiet hospital room, his brother was watching. He lifted the trophy slightly, the polished metal cool against his trembling, sticky fingers. His voice, when it came, was not a roar of victory, but a low, raw statement of fact, scraped from the very bottom of his exhausted soul. \u201cThis is for my brother, Leo,\u201d he said. And then he said no more.\n\nThe simplicity of the statement, its stark and unadorned sincerity, cut through the manufactured hype like a razor. A ripple of quiet went through the crowd nearest the stage, and the host, for the first time all night, was momentarily speechless. He recovered quickly, launching into another volley of superlatives, but the moment had passed. The circus had been punctured by a sliver of raw, undeniable truth. Janice from the APA was suddenly at his side, her face alight with a mixture of professional triumph and genuine concern. \u201cBaz, that was incredible! We need to get you to the media pen, Channel 7 wants a live cross\u2026\u201d she began, her hand on his elbow, trying to steer him. He gently but firmly shook his head, disengaging her hand. He clutched the trophy to his chest like a shield and began to push his way through the backstage crush, a single, unswerving thought in his mind: he had to get out.\n\nHe found refuge in a concrete stairwell, the air cool and smelling of dust and damp. The roar of the crowd was a muted, distant thunder. He leaned his head against the cold wall, the silence a deafening relief after the sensory assault of the stage. His hands were still shaking, so violently he could barely operate his phone. He scrolled through his contacts, past Mick the Mouth and the boys from the footy club, and pressed the call button next to \u2018Dad\u2019. It rang once. \u201cWe saw, son,\u201d Frank\u2019s voice came through, thick with an emotion Baz had never heard from him before. \u201cWe all saw. Your mother is crying her eyes out.\u201d There was a pause, a rustle. \u201cLeo\u2026 he\u2019s smiling. He\u2019s telling me you looked like a bloody pelican, but he\u2019s smiling.\u201d\n\nA sound escaped Baz\u2019s throat, a strangled half-laugh, half-sob. He slid down the wall until he was sitting on the dusty steps, the heavy trophy in his lap. \u201cI did it, Dad,\u201d he whispered, the words barely audible. \u201cI told you he would,\u201d Frank said, not to Baz, but to someone else in the room. Then, back to the phone, his voice firm and clear. \u201cWe know, son. You kept your promise. Now get some rest. It\u2019s time to come home.\u201d The line clicked dead. Baz didn't move for a long time, sitting in the quiet stairwell, the weight of the golden pie on his lap a grounding, final anchor. The deal was paid in full.\n\nHe was eventually found by an APA official and led, not to the media pen, but to a small, curtained-off medical area. A young doctor with kind, tired eyes took his blood pressure, listened to his heart, and shone a light in his eyes. \u201cWell, Mr. O\u2019Connell,\u201d he said, pulling the stethoscope from his ears. \u201cYour heart is beating like a drum kit falling down a flight of stairs and your blood pressure is\u2026 astronomical. Physically, you\u2019ve put your body through the equivalent of running a marathon while being mildly poisoned.\u201d He gave Baz a wry look. \u201cCongratulations, I guess. My professional medical advice would be to maybe not do this again. Ever.\u201d Baz just nodded, the clinical assessment a strange and fitting postscript to his absurd ordeal.\n\nThe van ride back to the hotel was silent. The other finalists had already gone. It was just Baz, the quiet driver, and the trophy sitting on the passenger seat beside him, its absurd form glinting in the passing streetlights. Back in the sterile quiet of his room, he walked over to the desk and placed the trophy down. He didn't polish it, didn't pose with it, didn't even give it a second glance. Its purpose had been served. It was no longer a monument; it was just a thing, a heavy, gilded paperweight. He stripped off his gravy-spattered shirt, walked into the bathroom, and stared at the man in the mirror. He looked like a shipwreck survivor. His face was pale and drawn, his eyes bloodshot and sunk deep in their sockets. There was a smear of dried gravy on his cheek he hadn't noticed. This was the face of a champion. This was the face of a man who had kept his promise.\n\nIgnoring the torrent of congratulatory texts that were making his phone buzz incessantly on the nightstand, he sat down at the desk. He opened his laptop, the cool blue light illuminating his exhausted face. He went to the airline\u2019s website, the movements of his fingers slow and deliberate. He found his booking, the return flight to Perth scheduled for two days\u2019 time, after the \"Champion\u2019s Parade and Farewell Brunch.\" He cancelled it without a moment\u2019s hesitation. He then booked a new ticket on the first available flight. A red-eye, leaving in four hours. His work in Melbourne was done. His real life was waiting for him.The journey to Melbourne airport in the dead of night was a passage through a ghost city. Baz sat in the back of a taxi, the Golden Crust trophy on the seat beside him, its absurd, gilded form catching the strobing colours of the traffic lights. The driver kept glancing at him in the rearview mirror, a mixture of awe and confusion on his face. \u201cSaw you on the telly, mate,\u201d he\u2019d said when Baz had loaded the trophy into the cab. \u201cUnbelievable. You looked like you were gonna explode.\u201d Baz had just grunted in response, his gaze fixed on the empty streets. He was no longer the champion, the man on the television. He was just a passenger on a journey, and the man he had been a few hours ago was already a stranger to him.\n\nAt the airport, he was an anomaly. A hulking, exhausted figure in a gravy-stained shirt, carrying a trophy the size of a car tyre through the deserted check-in hall. A few late-night travellers and weary airport staff stopped and stared, whispering and pointing. He ignored them. The trophy, which had felt so heavy on stage, now felt impossibly light, a hollow, tinny thing. It was just a prop, and the play was over. Getting it through security was a final, farcical act. The young officer at the X-ray machine stared at the screen, then at Baz, then back at the screen, his face a mask of disbelief. \"I'm gonna... I'm gonna have to swab this for explosives, mate,\" he said, trying and failing to sound professionally detached. Baz just nodded, submitting his monument to pointless ambition to the final indignity of a chemical wipe-down.\n\nOn the plane, he managed to wedge the trophy into the overhead locker after a brief, awkward struggle. He sank into his seat, the plane\u2019s recycled air a welcome, sterile coolness on his feverish skin. He didn\u2019t sleep. He couldn\u2019t. His body was a warzone of conflicting signals\u2014adrenaline, exhaustion, pain, and a profound, bone-deep relief. He leaned his forehead against the cool plastic of the window and watched as the lights of Melbourne receded, shrinking to a glittering web on a dark velvet cloth before disappearing completely. Below him, the vast, sleeping continent of Australia passed by, a dark and silent land. He was travelling from one life back to another, and the five-hour flight was a timeless, liminal space between the two. He thought of his father\u2019s words: *You don\u2019t get a miracle and then walk away from your end of the bargain.* He had held up his end. Now he was going home to see the miracle for himself.\n\nHe landed in Perth as the sun was beginning to cast its first pale, golden light across the horizon. The air that hit him as he stepped out of the terminal was instantly, comfortingly familiar\u2014dry, warm, with the faint, resinous scent of eucalyptus. It was the smell of home. He hailed a taxi, placing the trophy on the back seat with a weary sigh. \u201cWhere to, mate?\u201d the driver asked, a cheerful woman with a messy grey ponytail. \u201cRoyal Perth Hospital,\u201d Baz said. The driver\u2019s eyes met his in the rearview mirror. \u201cVisiting hours are a bit later, mate. You sure?\u201d Baz just nodded, his gaze already fixed on the familiar landmarks passing by the window. \u201cI\u2019m sure,\u201d he said.\n\nHe walked through the hospital\u2019s automatic doors just as the first shift of day nurses was arriving, their faces fresh and their coffee cups full. The corridors, which had been his purgatory for so many weeks, were quiet, filled with the soft, promising light of a new day. He didn\u2019t need to ask for directions. He knew the way by heart. He found Leo\u2019s new room on the fourth floor, in the rehabilitation ward. He stopped outside the closed door, his heart hammering against his ribs with a force that rivalled the competition\u2019s final moments. This was the real test. This was the final finish line. He took a deep breath, the clean, antiseptic smell a strange comfort, and pushed the door open.\n\nThe room was bathed in the gentle morning sun. Frank was asleep in one of the visitor\u2019s chairs, his head tilted back at an uncomfortable angle, a newspaper fallen across his lap. Mary was dozing in the other, her head resting on her arms on the edge of the bed. And in the bed, propped up by a wedge of pillows, was Leo. He wasn't looking at the door. His gaze was fixed on the window, watching the galahs squabble in a gum tree outside. He was thinner, paler, a faint scar tracing a pale line along his temple, but his eyes were clear. He was here. He was whole. Baz didn't say a word. He walked quietly into the room and placed the Golden Crust trophy on the end of the bed.\n\nThe soft thud of the trophy\u2019s base on the blanket made Leo turn his head. His eyes widened, first at the ridiculous, glittering object, and then they lifted to meet his brother\u2019s. A slow, lopsided grin spread across his face, the first one Baz had seen in what felt like a hundred years. It was the same fond, exasperated smile he had pictured so many times. \u201cJesus, Baz,\u201d Leo said, his voice a low, gravelly rasp, but unmistakably his. \u201cIt\u2019s even stupider looking in real life.\u201d\n\nBaz felt the tension of the past month, the grief, the guilt, the fanatical discipline, all dissolve in that single, perfect moment. A grin stretched across his own face, a wide, tired, triumphant baring of teeth. \"Yeah, well,\" he said, pulling the remaining visitor\u2019s chair to the bedside. \"You\u2019re the one who told me to win it.\" He sank into the chair, the exhaustion hitting him like a physical blow. Leo\u2019s eyes roamed over him, taking in the pale, gaunt face, the gravy-stained shirt, the deep, dark circles under his eyes. \"You look like shit,\" Leo stated, the affection in the insult as clear as day. \"You look worse,\" Baz shot back without missing a beat.\n\nThey sat in comfortable silence for a moment, the quiet hum of the hospital around them. Mary stirred, her eyes fluttering open. She saw Baz, and her face crumpled with a pure, uncomplicated joy. She reached out and gripped his arm, her other hand never leaving Leo\u2019s. Frank snorted and woke with a start, his eyes immediately finding his two sons, together, awake, and safe. A slow, satisfied smile touched his lips. The family was whole again. Baz leaned back in his chair, his gaze shifting from the trophy, to his parents, and finally back to his brother. The trophy was just a ridiculous piece of metal. This, right here, was the prize. This was the victory. He closed his eyes, the morning sun warm on his face, the sound of his brother\u2019s quiet, steady breathing the only sound that mattered in the world. He was home.## Chapter 8\n\nThe fragile, sacred silence of the room was broken by the soft squeak of rubber-soled shoes. A nurse Baz recognised as Carol, the kind, middle-aged woman from his first terrible night in the ICU, appeared in the doorway with a breakfast tray. She stopped dead, her practiced hospital smile faltering as she took in the scene. Her gaze went from Leo, awake and alert in the bed, to the exhausted, grime-streaked giant sitting beside him, and finally to the ludicrously large, glittering gold trophy at the foot of the bed. Her eyes widened, and a slow, bewildered smile spread across her face. \"Well,\" she said, her voice a mixture of amusement and disbelief. \"I've seen flowers, I've seen balloons, and I've seen a man try to bring in a live goat for 'therapy,' but I can honestly say that's a first.\" She placed the tray with its plastic-covered plate of scrambled eggs on the rolling table and looked at the trophy. \"Is that what I think it is? I saw a bit of it on the morning news.\"\n\nLeo pointed a weak finger at his brother. \"His,\" he croaked, a spark of mischief in his tired eyes. \"He's the idiot who won it.\" The statement, a perfect distillation of their brotherly dynamic, made Mary laugh through her tears. Frank just shook his head, a look of weary pride on his face. The story was already becoming a legend, a bizarre and unbelievable tale that would be told and retold. The trophy was no longer just a symbol of a private, desperate bargain; it was now a public artifact, a conversation piece, a shining, ridiculous testament to a brother's love. The weight of it all, the weeks of sleeplessness, the brutal training, the sheer, crushing stress, suddenly landed on Baz with the force of a physical blow. The adrenaline that had carried him across the country and through the competition finally drained away, leaving a vast, hollow emptiness in its place. The room began to tilt, the edges of his vision blurring into a soft, grey haze. He felt a hand on his shoulder and looked up to see his father\u2019s concerned face.\n\n\"Alright, son,\" Frank said, his voice firm but gentle. \"You've done your bit. Go home. Sleep.\" Baz tried to protest, to say he was fine, but the words wouldn't come. His body had made the decision for him. He felt his mother's hand on his arm, her touch a soft, insistent pressure guiding him to his feet. He allowed himself to be led from the room, his movements clumsy and slow. As he reached the door, he looked back. Leo had lifted a hand in a slow, weak wave, his eyes following his brother with a look of profound, unspoken gratitude. Baz nodded once, a promise that he would be back, and then he was gone, leaving the trophy to stand watch in his place.\n\nThe ute, which had sat silent in the hospital car park for what felt like a lifetime, coughed to life with a familiar, comforting rumble. Driving home through the bright morning traffic was an out-of-body experience. The world seemed too loud, too fast, too full of colour. His own small house felt like a stranger's when he walked in. The air was stale, and the faint, lingering smell of old gravy and baked pastry hung in the kitchen like a ghost. He walked over to the counter where his notepad still lay, covered in its frantic calculations of times and weights and consistencies. Beside it was the stack of empty tins from his final, record-breaking training session. He looked at them for a long moment, the tools of his strange and painful vocation. There was no anger, no shame, no triumph. He simply gathered them all up\u2014the notepad, the tins, the specialised rubber block he\u2019d found on the floor\u2014and walked them out to the wheelie bin in the backyard. He dropped them in, the clatter of the tins a final, percussive endnote to the whole mad symphony.\n\nHe walked back inside, stripped off his filthy, sweat-stiffened clothes, and stood under a scalding hot shower for twenty minutes, letting the water wash away the grime of Melbourne and the lingering scent of his ordeal. He didn't think. He just felt the heat on his aching muscles, the steam filling his lungs, the slow, steady release of a tension he had carried for so long it had become part of his own skeleton. He stumbled into his bedroom, the unfamiliar softness of the carpet a luxury under his bare feet, and fell into bed. He was asleep before his head fully hit the pillow, plunging into a deep, dreamless, and profound darkness. It was not the troubled, fitful sleep of a worried sentry, but the bottomless, healing oblivion of a soldier whose war was finally over.\n\nHe woke to the sun slanting low through his window, casting long, peaceful shadows across the room. A glance at the clock told him it was late afternoon. He had slept for more than eight hours, a solid, unbroken block of rest that felt more restorative than a week's worth of dozing in a hospital chair. The house was silent. The frantic energy that had filled it during his training was gone, replaced by a deep and settled calm. For the first time in a month, he felt hunger not as a gnawing emptiness or a self-inflicted punishment, but as a simple, biological need. He padded to the kitchen, his body stiff but no longer buzzing with a manic energy. He opened the fridge, bypassed the water bottles and the leftover blocks of lard, and pulled out a carton of eggs. He cooked himself a simple meal\u2014scrambled eggs on toast, with a mug of strong, milky tea. He sat at the rickety patio table in the cooling evening air and ate slowly, tasting every mouthful. It was the best thing he had ever eaten.\n\nWhen he returned to the hospital that evening, the atmosphere had shifted again. The air of crisis was completely gone, replaced by the mundane, almost boring routine of recovery. He found his parents in the cafeteria, sharing a newspaper and a pot of tea, their faces relaxed and free from the constant strain of worry. Leo, they told him, was asleep, worn out from his first session with the physiotherapist. The trophy, Frank added with a wry smile, had become a minor celebrity on the ward. Nurses and other patients had been stopping by all afternoon to look at it, to touch it, to hear the condensed, unbelievable story from Mary. It was a bizarre but welcome distraction, a splash of gold in the sea of hospital beige. Baz just listened, a quiet smile on his face. The trophy had a life of its own now, and it had nothing to do with him.\n\nThe next day, he walked into Leo\u2019s room to find him sitting up in a large armchair by the window, painstakingly trying to complete a crossword puzzle from the newspaper with a shaky hand. The physiotherapist had been working with him on fine motor skills, and the simple act of writing was a monumental effort. \"What's a nine-letter word for an idiot brother who almost gives his entire family a collective coronary?\" Leo asked without looking up, his voice still raspy but laced with its familiar dry wit. Baz pulled up a chair. \"Scaffolder,\" he answered, settling in beside him. Leo snorted, a small puff of air. \"Doesn't fit.\" He put the pen down, the effort clearly exhausting him, and turned to look at his brother. His gaze was clear and direct. \"So,\" he said, his tone shifting, becoming serious. \"Did you really eat sixteen of those things?\" The question was no longer a joke. It was a genuine inquiry, an attempt to understand the incomprehensible journey his brother had taken while he was lost in the dark.\n\nAnd so Baz told him. He told him everything. Not the heroic version, not the legend that was forming around the trophy, but the real, ugly, painful truth. He spoke of the desperate, one-sided deal he had made in the dead of night, of the brutal runs along the river, of the force-feeding sessions in the lonely kitchen, of his father standing over him with a stopwatch. He told him about the revulsion, the pain, the guilt, and the single, unwavering, illogical belief that if he just pushed himself hard enough, if he suffered enough, it would somehow matter. He spoke for a long time, his voice low and steady, confessing the full extent of his madness. When he had finished, the room was quiet. Leo just stared at him, his expression a mixture of awe, horror, and a love so profound it needed no words. He reached out a trembling hand and placed it on Baz's arm. \"You absolute madman,\" he whispered, and this time, there was no smile, no exasperation. There was only a deep and shuddering respect. \"You really are the best.\"The weight of those simple, earnest words settled over Baz, a comfort heavier and more profound than any trophy. He didn't have a clever retort, no booming comeback. He just nodded, a lump forming in his throat, and squeezed his brother\u2019s arm. For a long moment, they sat in the quiet understanding that had been forged in the crucible of the past month. The wild, desperate energy that had propelled Baz across the country had finally found its destination, not in a winner's circle under television lights, but here, in the quiet humility of a hospital room, in his brother's clear and grateful eyes. The grand, ridiculous gesture had been received, its true meaning understood completely.\n\nWeeks turned into a month, and the rhythm of their lives shifted from the frantic beat of crisis to the slow, grinding cadence of recovery. The hospital ward became a new kind of worksite for Baz. His days were no longer measured in pies consumed or kilometres run, but in the small, painstaking victories of Leo\u2019s rehabilitation. He was there for the gruelling physiotherapy sessions, watching his brother\u2019s face contort with effort as he learned to walk again, his leg a lattice of scars and surgical steel. He sat for hours in waiting rooms while Leo worked with occupational therapists, re-training his hand to hold a pen, to button a shirt. This was a different kind of endurance, a marathon of patience and quiet support that demanded no applause and offered no trophies. It was slow, monotonous, and the most important work he had ever done.\n\nThe Golden Crust trophy came home with Baz, an absurd and glittering refugee from another life. His mother, in a flush of pride, insisted on placing it in the centre of the mantelpiece in their parents\u2019 temporary rental house, where it sat between a framed photo of her sons as gap-toothed children and a porcelain shepherdess. It was a constant source of debate. Frank would occasionally polish it with a grim satisfaction, while Leo, once he was well enough for weekend leave, declared it an eyesore of monumental proportions, suggesting it would be more useful as an elaborate doorstop or a particularly gaudy birdbath. It became part of the family lore, a tangible reminder of the madness, a story they would tell with shakes of the head and disbelieving smiles for the rest of their lives.\n\nWhen Baz finally returned to the scaffolding site, he was greeted like a conquering hero. \"Here he is! The Pie King!\" Mick the Mouth had boomed, the entire crew stopping work to give him a round of applause that echoed across the concrete shell of the building. They slapped his back, made jokes about his 'secret training regimen,' and asked if he was going to defend his title next year. Baz just smiled, shook his head, and deflected their questions. He was no longer the man who had left. He picked up his tools, the familiar weight a comfort in his hands, and got back to work, the easy camaraderie and the physical exertion a welcome anchor to a reality he had almost lost. High above the city, balancing on a steel beam with the wind whistling past, he felt more grounded than he had in months. The world of pastry and glory felt a million miles away, a strange dream he had once had.\n\nSeveral months later, the fierce heat of summer had finally broken, giving way to the gentle, balmy evenings of early autumn. In the small, scorched patch of grass he called a backyard, Baz O\u2019Connell sat on a white plastic chair that no longer groaned under his frame. He was leaner, the punishing regimen and the stress having stripped away his excess bulk, leaving behind a harder, quieter strength. The rusty fridge hummed its low, contented tune. He cracked open a cold beer, the satisfying hiss a familiar sound, and passed it to the man sitting in the chair beside him. Leo took the bottle, his grip steady, a thin white scar barely visible on his temple. He still walked with a slight limp, a permanent reminder of the Kwinana Freeway, but he was here. He was whole. They sat for a long moment in comfortable silence, watching the galahs settle in the neighbour\u2019s gum tree.\n\n\"So,\" Leo said finally, taking a sip of his beer. \"You gonna defend your title? The Masticator is apparently on a strict diet of kale and revenge.\" Baz looked at his brother, at the familiar glint of humour in his eyes, and let out a low laugh. \"Nah, mate,\" he said, shaking his head. \"I'm retired. One hundred percent undefeated. Going out on top.\" He took a long swallow of his beer, the taste no longer of victory or despair, but simply of a quiet Tuesday evening with his brother. He looked around the small yard, at the rickety table, at the struggling lemon tree, at the man sitting beside him. This was his monument. Not the ridiculous gold-plated pie gathering dust on a mantelpiece, but this. This simple, fragile, and unbreakable reality. This was the glorious, pointless ambition, and he, Baz O\u2019Connell, scaffolder and brother, was its chief architect. And it was more than enough.## Chapter 9\n\nThe rhythm of ordinary life returned with a quiet, reassuring steadiness. Summer\u2019s brutal reign gave way to an autumn that draped Perth in a soft, golden light, and the city\u2019s simmering hum mellowed to a contented purr. For Baz, the change of season felt like a personal amnesty. His days found their old shape, marked by the 5 a.m. alarm, the scent of sawdust and diesel, and the satisfying ache in his shoulders after ten hours of hauling steel. High above the city, suspended between the bleached-bone sky and the sprawling geometry of the streets below, he found a profound and simple peace. The wind that whipped around the skeletal frames of new buildings stripped away the noise of the past, leaving only the clean, elemental reality of his work. The world of television cameras and ten-minute timers felt like a half-remembered fever dream, a story that had happened to someone else.\n\nHe saw Leo most evenings. His brother's recovery was a slow, stubborn march forward, each small gain a hard-won victory. The limp was less pronounced, the words came more easily, and the old, sharp wit was fully restored, now deployed to mercilessly critique the daytime television he was forced to watch. The Golden Crust trophy, retrieved from his parents\u2019 mantelpiece after Leo declared it was \"actively lowering the property value,\" now resided in Baz's spare room, shrouded in a dusty bedsheet like a retired deity whose powers were no longer required. His life had found its equilibrium. The scales, so violently upended, were balanced once more.\n\nThe disruption, when it came, started not with the ferocious buzz of an unknown number, but with a crackle over the worksite radio. Baz was twenty-two storeys up, guiding a crossbeam into place, when Mick the Mouth's voice echoed from the receiver on his belt. \"Baz, you there? Got a visitor for you down at the site office. Says it's important.\" A visitor for him, here? It was unheard of. The only people who visited were union reps or safety inspectors. A familiar jolt, a faint echo of the anxiety he thought he\u2019d buried, pricked at him. \"Who is it?\" he radioed back. There was a pause, and Mick's reply was tinged with confusion. \"Dunno, mate. Some sheila in a suit that probably costs more than my car. Says her name's Chloe. Looks like she got lost on her way to a bloody boardroom.\"\n\nHe descended in the rattling cage of the worksite lift, the city rising up to meet him as he went down. He stepped out onto the dusty, chaotic ground floor, his work boots kicking up clouds of fine cement powder. Standing beside the corrugated iron shed that served as the site office was a woman who was so out of place she seemed to have been digitally inserted into the scene. She was tall and slender, dressed in a sharp, cream-coloured pantsuit that was miraculously pristine amidst the surrounding grime. Her blonde hair was pulled back in a severe, elegant style, and she held a slim leather portfolio clutched in one hand. As Baz approached, his massive frame casting a long shadow over her, she turned, and a bright, professional smile clicked into place. It didn\u2019t reach her eyes, which were a cool, assessing blue. \"Mr. O'Connell? Baz? I\u2019m Chloe Vance. I'm a producer with Channel Nine. Thank you for coming down.\"\n\nHer voice was just like the one he remembered from Janice at the APA\u2014crisp, formal, and smelling of money. He stopped a few feet from her, wiping his dusty hands on his jeans, not offering one. \"I'm at work,\" he said, his tone flat and unwelcoming. Her smile didn't waver. \"Of course. I won't take up much of your time. I'm here because we at the network were incredibly moved by your story. By what you did at the Golden Crust Championship.\" The words, \u2018your story,\u2019 made his skin prickle. It wasn't a story; it was his life, and he didn\u2019t like the way she said it, as if it were a property she was interested in acquiring. \"It\u2019s over,\" he said. \"It was a stupid competition. I'm done with it.\"\n\n\"That's just it, Baz. May I call you Baz?\" she continued, not waiting for an answer. \"To everyone else, it might have been a competition. But what you did\u2026 winning it for your brother, Leo\u2026 that transcended sport. That was a narrative of love, of sacrifice, of pure Australian grit. It's the kind of inspirational journey our viewers connect with on a fundamental level.\" She opened her portfolio, the slick movement a stark contrast to the gritty surroundings. \"I'm the executive producer for 'Heartland Heroes,' our flagship weekly human-interest program. We want to feature you. A full, primetime segment. We'd fly you and Leo to Sydney, put you up, tell your story properly, with dignity and respect. We want to celebrate you.\"\n\nBaz felt a familiar, hot surge of anger mixed with exhaustion. They wanted to package his family\u2019s private hell, his brother's near-death, his own desperate madness, into a twenty-minute television segment between a story about a surfing dog and a profile of a charity fun-run. They wanted to put it on display, to sell it. \"No, thanks,\" he said, the words coming out as a low growl. \"We're not interested. My brother is still recovering. We just want to be left alone.\" He started to turn away, to go back to the world of steel and concrete that made sense.\n\n\"We were planning to make a fifty-thousand-dollar donation to the Royal Perth Hospital's rehabilitation wing in your name,\" she said, her voice calm and perfectly timed. Baz froze, his back to her. The noise of the worksite\u2014the whine of a circular saw, the clang of steel on steel, Mick shouting at a truck driver\u2014seemed to fade into a dull, distant hum. Fifty thousand dollars. The words hung in the dusty air. He thought of the drab, underfunded physiotherapy room, the worn-out equipment, the overworked nurses and therapists who had patiently, painstakingly pieced his brother back together. He thought of the other patients on the ward, the stroke victims and the accident survivors, all fighting their own quiet, desperate battles. \"Think of all the other Leos you could help, Baz,\" Chloe said softly, sensing she had found the chink in his armour. \"Think of the good you could do. All it would take is one weekend. One conversation.\" He slowly turned back to face her, his face a mask of conflicting emotions. The easy peace he had found high above the city had been shattered. The world, with its complicated demands and its terrible bargains, had found him again.The world seemed to tilt on its axis, the familiar noise of the worksite fading into a dull, distant roar. Fifty thousand dollars. It wasn't a number; it was a tangible thing. It was the new set of parallel bars the physio, an overworked woman named Brenda, had said they desperately needed. It was the upgraded pulley system for limb strengthening. It was salaries, resources, and relief for the very people who had dragged Leo back from the silent abyss. Chloe Vance hadn\u2019t just offered a donation; she had presented him with the full weight of his gratitude and his conscience. He looked from her pristine, expensive shoes standing on the dusty, oil-stained ground to the half-finished building behind her, a monument to commerce, and felt the simple certainties of his life begin to crumble.\n\n\"My brother makes his own decisions,\" Baz finally managed, his voice a low, rough growl. \"This isn't just about me.\" Chloe\u2019s professional smile remained fixed, but a flicker of victory registered in her cool blue eyes. She knew she had him. She slid a sleek, cream-coloured business card from her portfolio, holding it out between two fingers. The card was thick and heavy, a different species from the flimsy paper rectangles passed around on the worksite. \"Of course,\" she said smoothly. \"Talk to him. But the offer is time-sensitive. Network budgets, scheduling\u2026 I'm sure you understand. I'm at The Richardson for the next two days. My number is on the card.\" Baz took the card, the feel of it alien against his calloused, grimy fingertips. He didn't say another word, just turned his back on her and walked towards the rattling cage of the lift, the small, heavy rectangle in his hand feeling more like a grenade than a piece of paper.\n\nThe rest of the afternoon passed in a haze. The familiar, dangerous work of balancing on high steel, of guiding tons of metal into place, usually demanded his full, unwavering attention, but today his mind was elsewhere. He was back in the rehabilitation ward, a place of quiet, stubborn effort and the pervasive smell of disinfectant. He saw the faded posters on the wall, the worn linoleum floor, the shared equipment that was constantly in use. He saw the faces of the other patients\u2014the elderly man recovering from a stroke, patiently trying to stack plastic cups; the young woman in the wheelchair, her face a mask of frustration as she fought to regain movement in her legs. They were all there, fighting their quiet wars. He had won his absurd battle and received his golden prize. Theirs was a longer, harder, and far more significant fight, waged in obscurity and with limited resources.\n\nThat evening, in the familiar sanctuary of the backyard, the ritual felt different. The air was still and cool, the beer was cold, but a new tension hung between the two brothers. Baz watched Leo take a long swallow from his bottle, his movements still careful but now imbued with a casual confidence that had been absent for months. He had put on some weight, and the haunted, hollowed-out look was gone from his eyes, replaced by his old, familiar light. He was healing. He was becoming himself again. Baz took a deep breath, steeling himself. \"There was a visitor at work today,\" he began, his voice hesitant. \"A woman from a TV station in Sydney. Channel Nine.\" Leo raised an eyebrow, his interest piqued. \"Don't tell me they want to do a show about scaffolding safety. It'd be a ratings blockbuster.\"\n\nBaz ignored the jibe, his tone flat as he relayed the conversation. He laid it all out: the 'Heartland Heroes' show, the talk of their 'inspirational journey,' the 'narrative of Australian grit.' He delivered the details with a palpable distaste, describing the producer and her proposal as if he were handling something foul. He expected Leo to join in on the mockery, to tear the entire concept to shreds with his signature sarcasm. And at first, he did. A slow, incredulous grin spread across Leo\u2019s face. \"Heartland Heroes?\" he scoffed, shaking his head. \"Good God. Are you serious? They want to put us on national television, probably with some sad piano music playing in the background, and have us talk about our feelings? They want to turn this whole bloody nightmare into a Hallmark card?\" He took another swig of his beer, his disgust evident. \"Tell me you told her to get stuffed. Politely, of course.\"\n\nThis was the moment. Baz stared into the amber depths of his beer bottle, unable to meet his brother's eye. \"I was going to,\" he said, his voice quiet. \"And then she mentioned the other part of the deal. They want to make a donation to the Royal Perth rehab ward. In our name.\" He paused, letting the silence stretch. \"Fifty thousand dollars, Leo.\" The laughter died on Leo's lips. The backyard, with its chirping crickets and the distant rumble of traffic, fell completely silent. The number, so stark and significant, changed the very nature of the conversation, stripping away the sarcasm and leaving behind a complex, uncomfortable reality. Leo was no longer smiling. His gaze became distant, his eyes unfocused, and Baz knew, with a painful certainty, exactly where his brother's mind had gone. He was back on the ward, not as a patient in a bed, but as an observer, seeing the place with his newly recovered clarity.\n\nHe was seeing Brenda, the physio, taping up the frayed handle on a rowing machine because there was no budget for a new one. He was seeing the waiting list for the single anti-gravity treadmill, a crucial piece of equipment that could only be used by one person at a time. He was seeing the faces of the other patients, the ones whose recovery would be measured not in weeks, but in years, the ones whose families didn't have a national pie-eating champion to throw a spotlight on their plight. The casual cynicism fell away from him, replaced by the weight of firsthand knowledge. He had been a recipient of that strained, under-resourced, and profoundly dedicated system of care. He knew, better than Baz ever could, exactly what that money would mean.\n\nFinally, after a long, contemplative silence, Leo let out a slow breath and looked at his brother. His expression was no longer one of mockery, but of grim, pragmatic calculation. \"So let me get this straight,\" he said, his voice devoid of its earlier sarcasm. \"We have to spend a weekend in Sydney, let some producer with expensive hair ask us a bunch of intrusive questions, and pretend to be 'inspirational' for a camera crew.\" He paused, taking a final swallow of his beer and setting the empty bottle down with a decisive click. \"And in exchange for that minor humiliation, Brenda gets her new parallel bars, and the ward gets a fifty-thousand-dollar upgrade. Is that the deal?\" Baz nodded slowly, watching his brother\u2019s face. \"That's the deal,\" he confirmed. Leo leaned back in his chair, a wry, weary smile touching his lips. \"Well,\" he said, looking his big brother straight in the eye. \"When you put it like that, it sounds like we'd be idiots not to take it. Book the flights, hero. It looks like we're going into show business.\"## Chapter 10\n\nThe phone call was a transaction, pure and simple. Baz made it the next morning from the cab of his ute before the worksite had fully woken up, the business card feeling slick and foreign in his hand. Chloe Vance answered on the first ring, her voice as crisp and alert as if she had been waiting for him. Baz didn\u2019t waste time on pleasantries. \u201cIt\u2019s Baz O\u2019Connell. We\u2019ll do it. The TV show.\u201d He could almost hear the smile spreading across her face. \u201cThat\u2019s wonderful news, Baz. We\u2019re so thrilled\u2014\u201d He cut her off, his tone flat and hard. \u201cOn one condition. We get it in writing. Fifty thousand dollars to the Royal Perth rehab ward. The money is transferred before we say a word on camera.\u201d There was a fractional pause, a moment of calculation on her end. \u201cOf course,\u201d she said, her voice recovering its smooth, professional warmth. \u201cConsider it done. I\u2019ll have my assistant email the confirmation to you and the hospital\u2019s foundation this morning. We\u2019ll arrange flights for you and Leo for early next week.\u201d Baz grunted an acknowledgment and hung up, dropping the phone onto the passenger seat. The deal was done. The humiliation had been priced and purchased.\n\nThe flight to Sydney felt vastly different from the desperate, solitary journey to Melbourne. This time, he was not an athlete preparing for war, but half of a diplomatic mission on hostile territory. He sat beside Leo, a silent, imposing guardian, while his brother surveyed the cabin with the air of a visiting anthropologist studying a strange tribe. Leo was stronger now, the ordeal having left a permanent limp and a network of faint scars, but it had also forged a new, quieter kind of confidence in him. He no longer vibrated with a restless energy; he possessed a still, watchful intelligence, the kind born of having stared into the void and walked away. While Baz stared grimly out the window, seeing only the long road ahead, Leo was reading the in-flight magazine, offering a dry running commentary on the absurdity of luxury watch advertisements and articles about \"mindful travel.\" He was the strategist, the interpreter, the one who would navigate the treacherous social landscape that awaited them.\n\nSydney greeted them not with the dry, familiar heat of home, but with a humid, bustling indifference. A sullen young man in a dark suit held a sign with their name on it and led them to a black town car without a word. They sped through a labyrinth of unfamiliar streets, the city a blur of sandstone, glass, and ceaseless motion. The hotel was a monument to corporate wealth, its lobby a cavernous space of polished marble and intimidatingly minimalist furniture. Their room, a \"Harbour View Suite\" on the thirty-second floor, was so opulent it felt like a parody. A wall of glass offered a postcard-perfect panorama of the Opera House and the Harbour Bridge, a view so iconic it seemed unreal, like a screensaver. Leo walked slowly around the suite, running a hand over the ridiculously high-thread-count sheets on one of the king-sized beds. \u201cI think the bathroom is bigger than your entire house, Baz,\u201d he said, his voice echoing in the vast, silent room. \"This is what they pay for a story. Funny, isn't it? When we were living it, it wasn't worth a damn thing.\"\n\nAn hour later, they were summoned to a conference room on a lower floor. Chloe Vance was in her element here, a queen in her court. She sat at the head of a long, polished table, flanked by a young, eager assistant clutching an iPad and a weary-looking cameraman who seemed to have seen it all before. \u201cBaz, Leo, thank you for coming,\u201d she began, her smile radiating a practiced warmth that didn't reach her eyes. \u201cWe\u2019re just so excited to have you. I wanted to have a quick \u2018pre-interview\u2019 chat today, just to walk through the narrative beats and get a feel for the emotional core of your journey.\u201d The corporate jargon washed over Baz, meaningless and irritating. He just sat, a stony island of denim and plaid in a sea of tailored suits, his arms crossed over his chest. Leo, however, leaned forward slightly, a look of polite, academic interest on his face. \u201cNarrative beats,\u201d he repeated softly, as if savouring a new and exotic phrase.\n\nChloe, taking this as encouragement, launched into her vision. She spoke of the \u201ctragic inciting incident,\u201d the \u201cbrother\u2019s selfless vow,\u201d and the \u201cgruelling test of human endurance.\u201d Her language painted a picture of a heroic myth, a simple, powerful story of good versus evil, of love conquering all. She turned to Leo, her expression shifting to one of carefully calibrated sympathy. \u201cLeo, can you take us back to that moment in the hospital? The moment you first woke up and saw your brother, the champion? What was that feeling like, seeing what he had done for you?\u201d Leo paused, a thoughtful expression on his face. \u201cMostly,\u201d he said, his voice dry and factual, \u201cI was wondering who the hell had stolen my underwear and why my throat felt like I\u2019d swallowed a handful of gravel. The Golden Crust trophy was a distant third on my list of concerns. It really is a remarkably gaudy piece of metal up close.\u201d The assistant\u2019s pen froze mid-scribble. The cameraman coughed to cover a laugh. Chloe\u2019s smile tightened by a fraction of a millimetre.\n\nShe quickly pivoted to Baz. \"And Baz, your training\u2026 we see it as a kind of monastic dedication. The pain, the sacrifice\u2026 it was a physical manifestation of your love for your brother. Can you talk about the mindset you had to adopt to push through that barrier?\" All eyes turned to Baz. He stared back at Chloe, his expression unreadable. He thought of the nausea, the self-loathing, the desperate, irrational belief that his own suffering could somehow balance the scales of the universe. \u201cIt was a job,\u201d he said, his voice a low rumble. \u201cHad to be done.\u201d Leo leaned forward again, adopting the role of helpful translator. \u201cWhat my brother means,\u201d he said, his tone smooth and reasonable, \u201cis that it was a deeply unpleasant process undertaken for a specific, desired outcome. Much like, for example, chemotherapy. Effective, but you wouldn\u2019t recommend it as a hobby.\u201d\n\nThe meeting concluded shortly after. Chloe, though visibly flustered by their refusal to follow her emotional script, maintained her professional composure, handing them a printed schedule for the next day\u2019s filming. As the door to the conference room closed behind them, leaving them alone in the hushed, carpeted hallway, Baz looked at his brother. \u201cChemotherapy?\u201d he grunted. Leo shrugged, a wry smile playing on his lips. \u201cSeemed appropriate. She wants a soap opera, we give her a clinical trial report. Factual, precise, and deeply un-telegenic. It\u2019s a transaction, Baz. We give them the story, but we give it to them on our terms. They get their quotes, Brenda gets her parallel bars, and we get to go home.\u201d They stepped into the lift, the doors hissing shut, sealing them in their own private bubble. They were a team, a two-man army of cynical, pragmatic resistance, and the battle had just begun.The filming took place the next day in a studio that felt less like a television set and more like an interrogation room designed by a psychologist. The centrepiece was a fake living room, complete with two plush, cream-coloured armchairs for the brothers and a slightly more upright one for Chloe. A fake bookshelf lined the back wall, filled with colour-coordinated, unread hardbacks, and a generic abstract painting hung at a pleasing angle. The whole set was bathed in a light that was intensely bright yet soft, a clinical, shadowless glare designed to expose every flicker of emotion. Three cameras on silent dollies moved like predatory insects, their red lights glowing with an unnerving focus. Baz, who was used to the raw, chaotic honesty of a construction site, felt a profound sense of unease. The artifice was suffocating; it was a room built to manufacture a truth that didn't exist.\n\nChloe took her seat opposite them, her on-camera persona clicking into place like a new lens on a camera. Her smile was warmer, her voice softer, her posture leaning forward in an attitude of deep, empathetic listening. She started with Leo, as they had predicted. \"Leo,\" she began, her voice a gentle murmur, \"thank you for being here. I want to take you back, if you're comfortable, to that moment in the hospital. That moment when you emerged from the darkness. Can you describe what it felt like to open your eyes and realise the extraordinary thing your brother had done for you? To see that golden trophy and understand the depth of his sacrifice?\"\n\nLeo met her earnest gaze with a calm, neutral expression. He took a moment, as if carefully considering the question, before answering. \"The first thing I remember feeling was an overwhelming sense of confusion, which I'm told is common,\" he began, his tone as factual and dispassionate as a doctor's report. \"My primary sensory inputs were the harshness of the fluorescent lights, the incessant beeping of a machine to my left, and the profound discomfort of the catheter I was still attached to. My brother's victory in the pie-eating competition wasn't really on my radar at that point. I was mostly preoccupied with the fact that my entire body felt like a single, comprehensive bruise and I had a desperate, primal urge for a glass of water.\" He paused, looking at her with polite inquiry. \"The trophy came later. As I mentioned, it's quite gaudy.\"\n\nA flicker of annoyance crossed Chloe\u2019s face before being professionally suppressed. She turned to Baz, hoping to find more fertile ground. \"Baz, that power, that drive. We see it as a physical manifestation of your love. When you were there, in your kitchen, forcing down pie after pie, pushing your body to the absolute limit\u2026 what was the one image, the one thought, that kept you going through the pain?\" Her question was a baited hook, dangling the promise of a tearful, emotional confession. Baz stared at the camera lens nearest him, its red light a malevolent eye. He thought not of a single image, but of the whole grinding, nauseating process. He thought of the revulsion, the bloating, the sheer, bloody-minded will required. He translated it all into his own language, stripping it bare of all poetry. \"Just had to get the numbers up,\" he said, his voice a low, flat rumble. \"It was a training exercise. You set a target, you hit the target. That's all.\"\n\n\"But *why*?\" Chloe pressed, her voice taking on a sharper edge of frustration. \"Why that target? Why that specific, gruelling method?\" Baz shifted his massive frame in the too-small armchair. He was a bull in a doll's house, and he was beginning to feel cornered. \"Seemed like the right kind of price to pay,\" he grunted, the words an admission he hadn't intended to make, a brief, unguarded glimpse into the desperate, magical thinking that had possessed him. Chloe seized on it, her eyes lighting up. \"A price! So you did see it as a kind of bargain, a sacrifice you were making to some higher power, to the universe itself, for your brother's life?\" Her voice was triumphant, she had her soundbite.\n\nBefore Baz could retreat back into his stony silence, Leo leaned forward, intervening with the calm, precise timing of a chess master. \"Chloe, I think you're mistaking a psychological coping mechanism for a theological treatise,\" he said, his voice still gentle but now carrying a sharp, analytical edge. \"My brother, faced with a situation of complete powerlessness, created a task over which he had absolute control. He manufactured a private, brutal ordeal in order to feel like he was doing *something* in a situation where nothing could be done. It's a common response to trauma. I believe it's referred to as a 'focal substitution'.\" He looked at Baz, then back at Chloe. \"It was less about bargaining with the universe and more about my brother finding a way to not go completely insane. A fact for which I'm eternally grateful, but it's probably not the heroic narrative you're looking for.\"\n\nChloe\u2019s face was a mask of barely controlled fury. Her \"narrative beats\" were being systematically dismantled, her emotional core exposed as a clinical case study. She was losing, and she knew it. She decided to go for broke, her voice taking on a saccharine, slightly pitying tone. \"It's just so fascinating. This deep, almost primal bond. It's a story we don't often get to tell. A story of two ordinary Aussie blokes, doing something so extraordinary, all for the love of family. And the fact that you're here today, sharing it with us, allowing us to celebrate you, it\u2019s just incredibly generous.\" She smiled, a final attempt to frame them within her saccharine world. It was a mistake. It gave Leo the opening he had been waiting for all along.\n\n\"Generous?\" Leo said, a small, wry smile finally touching his lips. \"Chloe, let's not pretend we don't all know why we're really here.\" He looked directly into the main camera, bypassing her completely, as if speaking to a much larger, unseen audience. \"We're not here because we're generous. We're here because your network offered to pay fifty thousand dollars to the physiotherapy department at Royal Perth Hospital. We're here because the public health system is so chronically under-resourced that a single piece of vital equipment, like a new set of parallel bars for people learning to walk again, is considered a luxury item. The real 'Heartland Hero' is our physio, Brenda, who works sixty-hour weeks with worn-out equipment to help people like me stand up again. The story isn't about my brother eating pies. The story is about the fact that a man nearly has to kill himself on national television just so a hospital can get a donation that should be part of its standard annual budget.\"\n\nA profound and utter silence descended on the studio. The cameraman nearest them slowly lowered his camera, his face a mixture of shock and deep respect. The young assistant stared at Leo, her mouth slightly agape. Chloe Vance looked as though she had been slapped. The professional mask was gone, replaced by a blank, bloodless expression of total defeat. She had been outmanoeuvred, her sentimental narrative hijacked and replaced with a searing, undeniable indictment of the very system that made feel-good stories like hers necessary. The transaction had been laid bare for all to see. After a long, agonising moment, she turned to the floor manager, her voice a clipped, dead thing. \"I think we have everything we need,\" she said. \"We're done here.\"\n\nThey walked out of the studio and into the bright, indifferent Sydney afternoon without a backward glance. No one tried to stop them, no one offered a handshake or a hollow thank you. They had fulfilled their contract, but not in the way anyone had expected. They had delivered their story, but it was a story of systemic failure, not personal triumph. As they waited for a taxi on the busy street corner, surrounded by the rush and roar of a city that didn't know or care about their private war, Baz looked at his brother. A slow, genuine grin spread across his face, the first he had felt all day. \"Focal substitution?\" he asked, the words a low rumble of amusement. Leo shrugged, a faint smile playing on his own lips as he adjusted the collar of his shirt. \"I read a lot of pamphlets in the waiting room,\" he said. \"You pick things up.\" The taxi pulled up to the curb, and they climbed in, leaving the studio and its false narratives behind them. The job was done. The parallel bars were paid for. It was time to go home.",

It wasn't just hot; it was a solid thing, a weight pressing down from a sky the colour of bleached bone. In the small, scorched patch of grass he called a backyard, Baz O\u2019Connell sat on a white plastic chair that groaned under his frame, a bead of sweat tracing a slow, deliberate path from his temple down the hard line of his jaw. The world smelled of baked concrete and the faint, salty promise of the ocean, a promise that the Fremantle Doctor would eventually arrive to offer its weak, afternoon reprieve. For now, though, there was just the heat and the low, contented hum of a city simmering under the sun.\n\nThen his phone, lying face-up on the rickety patio table, buzzed with a ferocity that seemed to violate the lethargy of the day. He squinted at the unknown number, an Eastern States area code, and felt a familiar jolt, a surge of something that was half-anxiety, half-electric hope. He snatched it up, his thumb swiping across the screen. \"Baz here.\" His voice was a low rumble, conditioned by years of shouting over the din of construction sites.\n\n\"Am I speaking with Mr. Barry O'Connell?\" The voice on the other end was crisp, formal, a woman's voice that sounded like it was wearing a freshly pressed suit.\n\n\"Yeah, that's me. Who's this?\"\n\n\"This is Janice from the board of the Australian Pie Association. I'm calling to officially congratulate you, Mr. O'Connell. Your performance in the Western Australian regional qualifier has earned you a place. You are one of the six finalists who will be competing in the National Golden Crust Championship next month in Melbourne.\"\n\nThe world stopped. The oppressive heat, the buzzing of a persistent fly, the distant rumble of traffic on the highway\u2014it all dissolved into a silent, perfect vacuum. A slow grin stretched across Baz\u2019s face, a wide, triumphant baring of teeth that crinkled the sun-weathered skin around his eyes. He stood up so fast the plastic chair screeched back and nearly toppled over. He pumped a fist into the thick, unmoving air. \"You're kidding me. The final? For real?\"\n\n\"Quite real, Mr. O'Connell. A formal invitation and travel itinerary will be emailed to you within the hour. Congratulations again. And may the best man win.\"\n\nThe line clicked dead. Baz stared at the phone for a long moment, the screen gone dark, reflecting his own dumbstruck, ecstatic face. The final. The Golden Crust. He\u2019d done it. He let out a roar that was pure, unadulterated joy, a primal sound that sent a flock of galahs screeching from the neighbour's gum tree. This was it. This was more than just a laugh, more than a weird hobby his brother teased him about. It was a monument to glorious, pointless ambition, and he, Baz O'Connell, scaffolder and dreamer, was one of its chief architects. He strode to the rusty old fridge he kept on the patio, pulled out a cold beer, and cracked it open with a satisfying hiss. The first gulp was victory itself, cold and sharp and tasting of a future paved with flaky pastry.\n\nHis first thought, after the initial wave of euphoria began to recede into a deep, thrumming satisfaction, was of Leo. He had to tell Leo. His younger brother, the sensible one, the one who\u2019d gone to uni and got a proper job in an office with air conditioning and pot plants. Leo, who called Baz\u2019s passion \u201cstructured gluttony\u201d and worried about his cholesterol with a sincerity that was both irritating and endearing. Leo would sigh, he would lecture, but underneath it all, he would be proud. He had to be. Baz thumbed through his contacts, his hands, usually so steady on steel beams twenty storeys up, feeling a little shaky. He pressed the call button next to 'Leo the Nerd' and put the phone to his ear.\n\nIt rang twice. \"Hey, big fella,\" Leo's voice came through, tinny and distant, punctuated by the unmistakable sound of road noise. \"On your fifth beer of the arvo already?\"\n\n\"Just cracked the first, you cheeky bugger. And it's a celebration,\" Baz boomed. \"You are talking to a national finalist.\"\n\nThere was a pause, just a beat of static and wind. \"Finalist for what? Biggest Bloke on Site?\"\n\n\"The Golden Crust, dickhead! The pie-eating final! They just called. I'm in. I'm flying to Melbourne next month to eat for the title.\"\n\nHe could almost hear Leo shaking his head, could picture the fond, exasperated smile. \"Jesus, Baz. You actually did it. You absolute madman. I thought you were just doing it to get a free feed at the local heats.\"\n\n\"Nah, mate, I'm serious about this. I'm the best. Now I get to prove it.\"\n\n\"The best at unhinging your jaw like a python? It's a noble pursuit,\" Leo said, the sound of his indicator clicking in the background. \"Look, mate, that's\u2026 it's something, alright. We'll have to have a proper celebration when I get back.\"\n\n\"Where you headed, anyway?\" Baz asked, taking another swig of his beer.\n\n\"Just gotta shoot down to Mandurah. Pick up some documents for work. Some old client who still thinks email is black magic. I should be back in Perth before sundown.\" There was a rustle, a sound of distraction. \"Shit, this exit... Look, Baz, I'm proud of you, you idiot. Seriously. Don't\u2026 don't have a heart attack before the main event, eh? We'll talk tonight.\"\n\n\"Yeah, you too. Just watch the road, mate. Don't text and drive.\"\n\n\"I'm on hands-free, Mum,\" Leo laughed. \"Talk later.\"\n\nThe line went dead. Baz lowered the phone, a wide, easy smile still on his face. He felt invincible. The world was his oyster, or better yet, his meat pie. He finished his beer in two long swallows and went inside, the cool of the house a sudden shock. In the kitchen, sitting on the counter, was his secret weapon. It was a pie from the small, artisan bakery downtown that he'd identified as having the closest pastry density and filling viscosity to the official contest pies. He\u2019d been studying them, training with them. This wasn\u2019t just about a big stomach; it was a science. It was about heat management, about finding the rhythm of crust and filling, the interplay of texture, the precise moment to swallow to conserve energy.\n\nHe picked it up. It was heavy, a perfect golden disc, still faintly warm. The scent of it\u2014rich, dark gravy, slow-braised beef, a hint of black pepper and thyme\u2014was the smell of his purpose. He set it down, his focus narrowing. The call from Leo had been good, but the distraction had been there in his brother's voice. That was the problem with the real world, the world of jobs and freeways and responsibilities. It was so damn distracting. His world, for the next month, had to be pure. It had to be about the pie.\n\nHis training regimen was a thing of quiet, monastic dedication. Early morning runs along the Swan River, not for fitness, but to expand his lung capacity, to teach his body to process oxygen more efficiently under duress. Hours spent chewing a specialised rubber block to strengthen his jaw muscles, an exercise that made him look like a demented bulldog to anyone who happened to glance into his living room. And the water loading. Litres and litres of water to stretch his stomach, a slow, uncomfortable process that left him feeling bloated and miserable but was essential for making the space he\u2019d need. He was a machine being calibrated for a single, absurdly specific task. A high-performance athlete whose sport nobody respected, least of all the man he most wanted to impress.\n\nAs the afternoon bled into evening, the fierce white heat of the day softened into a golden glow. The Fremantle Doctor finally made its presence known, a cool, salty breeze that rustled the leaves of the struggling lemon tree in the corner of his yard and carried the distant sound of children playing. The initial high of the phone call had settled into a low, simmering excitement. He kept checking his phone, expecting a follow-up text from Leo, probably a link to an article about the dangers of processed meats. He was waiting for the 'I'm home' call, the promise of a shared beer and a proper ribbing.\n\nThe sun was a fiery orange smudge on the horizon when the phone rang again. He grinned, assuming it was Leo, ready with a smart-arse comment. He picked it up without checking the number. \"Alright, nerd, you home yet?\"\n\nA woman's voice answered, and it was not Leo's. It was calm, professional, and utterly devoid of warmth. It was a voice that chilled the balmy evening air. \"Am I speaking to a Mr. Barry O'Connell?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Baz said, his grin faltering. The similarity to the call from the pie association was unnerving. \"Who's this?\"\n\n\"My name is Constable Davies. I'm calling from Peel Health Campus. We have your brother, Leo O'Connell, here. There's been an accident. A motor vehicle collision on the Kwinana Freeway.\"\n\nThe world, which had stopped so beautifully just a few hours ago, stopped again. But this time it was not a silent, perfect vacuum. This time it was a screech of tearing metal, a cacophony of shattering glass, a sickening, final thud. The plastic cup of water he\u2019d been holding slipped from his suddenly nerveless fingers. It didn't shatter, just hit the worn linoleum with a dull thud, the water splashing over his bare feet, cold as ice.\n\n\"Is he\u2026?\" The words wouldn't form. His throat was a knot of tight muscle.\n\n\"He's alive,\" the constable said, and Baz's knees almost buckled in relief. But she wasn't finished. \"He's alive, but his injuries are very serious, Mr. O'Connell. The doctors are with him now. They said you should come as soon as you can.\""

Baz\u2019s old ute, usually a comforting, rumbling beast, felt like a fragile cage hurtling through a hostile world. He gripped the steering wheel so hard his knuckles were white, his big frame crammed into the driver\u2019s seat, feeling for the first time in his life not powerful, but sickeningly, terrifyingly small. The Kwinana Freeway stretched out before him, a ribbon of dark asphalt that had, just hours ago, been the site of his brother's undoing. Every passing car was a potential missile, every lane change a new threat. The city simmered no longer; it snarled.\n\nHe couldn\u2019t stop replaying their last conversation. Leo\u2019s laugh, tinny and distant, echoing in his memory. *I'm on hands-free, Mum.* The casual, affectionate mockery. *Don't have a heart attack before the main event, eh?* Baz\u2019s jaw clenched so tight a bolt of pain shot up into his temple. The main event. He\u2019d been so full of it, so wrapped up in his ridiculous, gravy-soaked dream. He had boomed about being a national finalist while his brother, the sensible one, the one who looked out for him, was driving into a nightmare. The shame was a physical sensation, a hot, coiling thing in his gut that was worse than any pre-contest bloat.\n\nThe email from the Pie Association would be in his inbox now. A formal invitation. An itinerary. A flight to Melbourne. The thought was so absurd, so obscene, that he let out a short, harsh bark of a laugh that sounded more like a sob. The Golden Crust. A monument to glorious, pointless ambition. He saw it clearly now, stripped of all its self-congratulatory romance. It was just pointless. A stupid, childish game he played while real life, fragile and precious, was happening all around him, ready to be snatched away without warning. He felt a violent urge to take his phone, the source of both his triumph and his terror, and hurl it out of the window into the rushing darkness.\n\nPeel Health Campus rose out of the suburban dark, a modern, sterile block of beige brick and illuminated glass. It looked like any other building, but tonight it felt like a temple of dread. He parked the ute crookedly in a bay, the front wheel bumping up onto the curb, and didn't bother to fix it. The air outside was cooler now, the sea breeze more pronounced, but he barely felt it. The automatic doors of the Emergency Department slid open with a soft whoosh, releasing a gust of air that smelled of disinfectant and quiet desperation. The brightly lit waiting room was sparsely populated with the walking wounded and their worried companions, a tableau of late-night misery.\n\nHe strode to the reception desk, a monolith of pale laminate under the harsh fluorescent lights. A nurse with tired eyes looked up from her computer screen.\n\"I'm here to see my brother,\" Baz said, his voice a raw, tight thing that was barely recognisable as his own. \"Leo O'Connell. There was a car accident. Someone called me.\"\nThe nurse\u2019s expression softened with a practiced, professional pity that made Baz\u2019s skin crawl. She typed the name into her system, her fingers clicking softly on the keyboard. The sound seemed unnaturally loud in the hushed room. \"Yes, Mr. O'Connell. He's here. He's in surgery at the moment. If you'd like to take a seat, the doctor will be out to speak with you as soon as they can.\"\n\nSurgery. The word landed like a punch to the stomach. It wasn't a broken arm or a few stitches. It was deep, internal, a place where things could go irrevocably wrong. He found an empty chair in a designated waiting area, a small, grim alcove with faded art on the walls and a television silently flashing a news report. A woman across from him was weeping softly into a handful of tissues. A man sat staring at the floor, his leg jiggling with a frantic, nervous energy. Baz just sat, his hands on his knees, his entire body a rigid knot of tension. The world had shrunk to this single, air-conditioned room. There was no Perth, no Melbourne, no Golden Crust. There was only the before, and the agonising, uncertain now. He stared at the swinging doors the nurse had vaguely gestured towards, willing them to open, dreading the face of the person who would eventually walk through them. Time stretched and warped, each minute an hour, each tick of the institutional clock on the wall a hammer blow against his sanity.\n\nFinally, after an eternity carved from fear, a man in blue scrubs pushed through the doors. He was tall and weary-looking, with dark circles under his eyes that spoke of a long and difficult night. His eyes scanned the small group and settled on Baz. He walked over, his footsteps echoing on the polished floor.\n\"Mr. O'Connell?\" the man asked, his voice low and grave. \"I'm Dr. Reid. I'm one of the surgeons who has been working on your brother.\"\nBaz stood up, his body feeling both heavy and strangely numb. He looked at the doctor's face, searching for a sign, a flicker of hope or a shadow of doom. But the man\u2019s expression was carefully, professionally neutral.\n\"Can we talk for a moment in the family room? It's just over here.\""

                                        "text": "The family room was a small, beige lie. It was designed to look comforting, with its soft lighting and generic watercolour prints of sailboats, but the air was thick with the ghosts of bad news. A box of tissues sat pristine on a small coffee table, a silent testament to the room\u2019s true purpose. Baz didn\u2019t sit. He stood in the middle of the worn carpet, his massive frame dwarfing the space, his arms hanging limp at his sides. He felt like a bull trapped in a doll\u2019s house.\n\nDr. Reid gestured towards one of the chairs, but Baz didn\u2019t seem to notice. The doctor let it go, his gaze professional and deeply tired. \"Your brother was brought in with multiple traumatic injuries consistent with a high-speed collision,\" he began, his voice even and devoid of emotion. It was the voice of a man who had to deliver these speeches far too often. \"The primary impact was on the driver's side. We took him straight to theatre. He had significant internal bleeding from a ruptured spleen, which we have managed to control, and a compound fracture of his left femur.\"\n\nThe words were just sounds, a medical lecture that Baz couldn't quite connect to the laughing, vibrant image of his brother. Ruptured spleen. Compound fracture. It was a foreign language describing the deconstruction of the person he knew best. He stared at a faint water stain on the ceiling, a pale brown map of some long-forgotten leak, and tried to make his brain work. He felt a strange detachment, as if he were watching a scene in a movie. This wasn't happening to him. This wasn't happening to Leo.\n\n\"The more pressing concern,\" Dr. Reid continued, pulling Baz\u2019s attention back into the sterile room, \"is the head injury. He sustained a significant blow to the head, which has caused a subdural hematoma\u2014that's a bleed on the surface of the brain. We've operated to relieve the pressure, but there is still a great deal of swelling. To give his brain the best possible chance to rest and recover, we've placed him in a medically induced coma.\"\n\nComa. The word landed and exploded, silencing the medical jargon and leaving only a ringing void. A coma. Leo was here, in this building, but he was also gone. He was asleep, but it was a sleep from which he might never wake. Baz\u2019s throat worked, but no sound came out. The image of Leo\u2019s face, a fond, exasperated smile as he called him a 'madman', flashed in his mind, so clear and so vivid it was like a physical blow. He swayed slightly on his feet.\n\n\"Will he\u2026?\" Baz finally managed, his voice a hoarse whisper he didn't recognise. He couldn\u2019t finish the question. He couldn\u2019t give voice to the worst possible outcome. \"Is he going to be okay?\"\n\nThe doctor\u2019s professional mask softened for a fraction of a second, a flicker of human empathy in his exhausted eyes. \"It's too early to give you a definitive prognosis, Mr. O'Connell. With brain injuries, the first twenty-four to forty-eight hours are critical. We are doing everything we can. His youth and his general good health are on his side. But he is in a very serious condition. We have to wait and see how he responds once the swelling starts to go down.\"\n\nThe non-answer was an answer in itself. It was a confirmation of the abyss that had just opened up at Baz\u2019s feet. He finally felt his legs give way and he collapsed into one of the flimsy chairs, which protested with a sharp crack under his weight. He didn't care if it broke. He dropped his head into his hands, his thick fingers pressing into his temples. The smell of baked concrete and the promise of the ocean felt a lifetime away. The triumphant roar he\u2019d let out in his backyard now seemed like a sacrilege, a boast to a cruel and indifferent god.\n\n\"He's being moved to the Intensive Care Unit now,\" Dr. Reid said gently. \"You can see him in a little while, once he's settled. The nurses on the ward will come and get you. I'm very sorry, Mr. O'Connell.\" The doctor gave a slight, helpless nod and then he was gone, leaving Baz alone in the beige room. The silence that rushed in was absolute, a crushing weight that was far heavier than any summer heat. The joy of a few hours ago had been a cheap, hollow thing. This, right here, was real. This was the main event. And he had never felt less like a champion."

The world had been reduced to the thrum of the air conditioning and the frantic, useless looping of his own thoughts. The last conversation. The sound of Leo\u2019s indicator. The pie on his kitchen counter. Each memory was a fresh turn of the knife. He was eventually retrieved by a kind-faced, middle-aged nurse named Carol, whose soft voice and gentle hand on his arm were the first touches of human kindness he had felt since the constable's call. She led him through another set of swinging doors and down a long, quiet corridor that felt different from the chaotic energy of the Emergency Department. The air here was cooler, the silence more profound, punctuated only by the soft beep and whir of unseen machines.\n\nThe Intensive Care Unit was a world unto itself. It was a place of hushed efficiency, of controlled and measured crisis. Each patient was in their own glass-walled bay, a small stage for a private drama of survival, presided over by a tangled web of technology. Monitors glowed with waterfalls of coloured lines and numbers, intravenous poles stood like metallic trees bearing bags of clear fluid, and ventilators hissed and clicked with a steady, rhythmic breath that was both life-sustaining and deeply unnatural. The smell was the same as the rest of the hospital, disinfectant and illness, but sharpened here, more concentrated, with an undercurrent of something metallic and cold.\n\nCarol led him to a bay at the far end. \"He's just in here, love. He has his own nurse with him at all times. Just press the button if you need anything at all. You can stay as long as you like.\"\n\nBaz stepped into the room and his own breath hitched in his throat. The figure in the bed was and was not Leo. The familiar shape of his brother was there, the line of his shoulders under the thin hospital blanket, the dark hair splayed against the pillow. But this version of Leo was unnervingly still, his face pale and swollen, a small white bandage taped to his temple. A tube entered his mouth, secured with tape, connected to the ventilator that rose and fell in his place, forcing air into his lungs with a soft, mechanical sigh. Wires snaked from his chest to a monitor above the bed, where a green line jaggedly traced the frantic, stubborn beat of his heart.\n\nHe looked small. Leo, who had always seemed to be vibrating with a restless, intellectual energy, who was always talking, gesturing, his mind ten steps ahead of everyone else, was utterly and completely inert. All his wit, his sarcasm, his fond exasperation, was gone, replaced by the humming and beeping of the machines that were keeping his body alive. Baz felt a wave of nausea. He wanted to tear the tubes and wires away, to shake his brother awake, to demand he stop this terrible, silent prank. He took a hesitant step closer, his work boots feeling clumsy and loud on the clean floor. He reached out a hand, calloused and huge, and gently touched Leo's arm, just above the IV line. His skin was warm. That simple fact, the warmth of his brother\u2019s body, was a small, desperate anchor in the tidal wave of horror.\n\nHe pulled a hard plastic visitor\u2019s chair to the bedside, its legs scraping against the floor with a sound that felt like a desecration of the room\u2019s quiet solemnity. He sat down, hunched forward, his elbows on his knees, and just watched. He watched the numbers on the screen, trying to decipher their meaning, trying to will them to be \u2018good\u2019 numbers. He watched the steady rise and fall of Leo\u2019s chest, a puppet\u2019s movement controlled by the machine beside him. The minutes bled into an hour, then two. The nurse, a young man named Ben, came in and out, checking readings, making notes, moving with a quiet competence that was both reassuring and terrifying. He spoke to Baz in low, respectful tones, explaining what he was doing, but the words barely registered.\n\nBaz\u2019s phone, forgotten in his pocket, vibrated against his leg. The buzz was a phantom of the earlier, joyful call, now a hateful intrusion. He pulled it out, his thumb clumsy on the screen. There was a new email. The subject line glowed with obscene cheerfulness: *Congratulations - Golden Crust Championship Finalist*. His vision tunnelled. The words seemed to mock him from the screen. A flight to Melbourne. A hotel reservation. A schedule of media appearances. A future that had ceased to exist. His thumb hovered over the delete icon, his whole body trembling with a mixture of rage and revulsion. He couldn\u2019t even bring himself to do it. Deleting it felt like an action, and he was capable of none. He just switched the phone to silent and shoved it deep into his pocket, a toxic secret weighing him down.\n\nThe call to their parents was the hardest thing he had ever had to do. They had retired to a small village in the south of England five years ago, a world away in every sense. He stepped out of the ICU, back into the quiet corridor, and dialled. Hearing his mother\u2019s cheerful, unsuspecting voice ask him how he was, how her \"two wonderful boys\" were doing, shattered the fragile composure he had been holding together. He choked on the words, his voice cracking as he relayed the doctor\u2019s sterile report. The silence on the other end of the line was a vast, echoing chasm of disbelief and pain, followed by a sound, a thin, wailing cry from his mother, that would be seared into his memory forever. They were booking the first available flight. They would be there in thirty hours. Until then, he was alone.\n\nHe returned to Leo\u2019s bedside, the weight of his parents\u2019 grief now added to his own. He leaned in close to his brother\u2019s ear, the smell of antiseptic sharp in his nostrils.\n\u201cYou hear that, you git?\u201d he whispered, his voice thick and rough. \u201cYou\u2019ve gone and made Mum cry. You better not make me tell her anything worse. You better not.\u201d\nHe started talking then, a low, rambling monologue to fill the awful silence. He talked about his day, about the oppressive heat, the call from the pie lady, his own stupid, selfish pride. \u201cI was a right idiot, Leo. A proper knob. Strutting around the yard like I\u2019d won the bloody lottery, all over a pie competition. While you were\u2026 while this was happening. I\u2019m so sorry, mate. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d\nHe talked about their childhood, about the time they\u2019d tried to build a raft to sail down the Swan River and nearly drowned, about the dog they\u2019d shared, about the first car Leo had ever bought, a beat-up Datsun he\u2019d loved more than anything. He talked until his throat was raw, his words a desperate, continuous prayer aimed at the unmoving man in the bed. He was trying to build a bridge of sound across the silent, terrifying gap that had opened between them, hoping a single word might find its way through.\n\nAs the night deepened outside, a dinner service cart rattled past the door of the ICU. Through the glass, Baz saw a nurse deliver a tray to a visitor in another bay. On it was a plate shrouded in a metal lid. The visitor lifted it, and a small puff of steam escaped. Underneath sat a meat pie, pale and institutional, its gravy thin and leaking into a mound of instant mashed potato. A jolt went through Baz, a bizarre and instantaneous reflex. *Too much moisture in the filling. The pastry will be compromised. Soggy bottom.* The thought, a fragment of the man he had been that afternoon, was so alien, so grotesquely inappropriate, that he felt a fresh wave of self-disgust wash over him. He looked from the sad, hospital pie to his brother\u2019s pale face, and the gulf between his old life and this new reality yawned wide and bottomless. His pointless ambition, his structured gluttony, his entire world of pastry and filling, had turned to ash in his mouth."

Baz hadn't slept. He sat in the same hard chair, his spine a column of agony, his clothes smelling of stale sweat and fear. Outside, he knew Perth was waking up, the early commuters starting their journeys, the city beginning to warm for another day. It was a world he no longer belonged to. His own world was four glass walls, the rhythmic hiss of the ventilator, and the jagged green line on the monitor that proved his brother was still, somehow, fighting. He was an exhausted sentry at the gate between life and death, and he had no idea which way the traffic was flowing.\n\nA dull ache in his jaw reminded him of his training. The hours spent chewing the specialised rubber block, the single-minded focus on building strength for a task that now seemed like the definition of insanity. He had treated his body like a piece of high-performance machinery, calibrating it for the sole purpose of consuming pastry faster than anyone else. Now, that same body felt like a leaden, useless weight. The expanded lung capacity he had worked for was useless here; it was a machine breathing for Leo. The strong jaw was useless; it could not form the words to make this right. He felt like an idiot, a child who had been playing with toys while the house burned down around him, and the shame was a physical, burning presence.\n\nCarol, the nurse from the night before, appeared at his side near mid-morning, her face etched with the same gentle exhaustion as his own. She held a styrofoam cup of coffee in one hand. \"You're still here,\" she said, not as a question, but a statement of tired fact. \"You need to get some rest, love. And some food. You'll do him no good if you collapse.\" She offered the coffee, but Baz just stared at it as if it were poison. The idea of consumption, of fuelling the body he now despised, was repulsive. \"Can't,\" he mumbled, shaking his head. \"I'm not hungry.\" The thought of food, any food, but especially the rich, savoury taste of pie, brought a fresh surge of bile to the back of his throat. His former passion was now a source of deep physical revulsion, a penance he would pay with an empty stomach and the gnawing ache of hunger.\n\nHe was staring at the drip rate of the IV bag, trying to find meaning in the slow, methodical fall of each clear drop, when his phone buzzed on the chair beside him. He ignored it. It buzzed again, insistent. Annoyed, thinking it might be a friend he didn't have the strength to talk to, he glanced at the screen. The name displayed was 'Australian Pie Association'. Janice. For a second, he felt nothing but a blank confusion, as if seeing a name from a language he no longer spoke. Then, a hot, black rage surged through him, so potent it made his vision swim. He snatched the phone, his thumb swiping across the screen, his voice a low growl. \"What?\" The crisp, professional voice from the day before, from another lifetime, chirped on the other end. \"Mr. O'Connell? Janice from the APA. I just wanted to confirm you received our email and see if you had any initial questions about the travel arrangements for Melbourne\u2014\"\n\n\"My brother is in a coma,\" Baz cut her off, the words like stones in his mouth, each one a separate, heavy agony. \"He's in the ICU on a ventilator because some bastard smashed into him on the freeway. So you can take your Golden Crust, and your travel arrangements, and your whole bloody pathetic competition, and you can shove it.\" There was a stunned, sputtering silence on the other end, the beginning of a half-formed apology that he had no intention of hearing. Baz jabbed the 'end call' button with a furious finality and dropped the phone onto the vacant part of Leo\u2019s bed. It landed softly on the blanket, a silent, useless black rectangle. The great monument to his ambition had been officially demolished in a single, brutal sentence.\n\nHe felt no triumph in the act, no release. Just a vast, hollow emptiness where the pride and excitement used to be. He had shed his old identity, the champion pie-eater, the scaffolder with a dream. It had sloughed off him like a dead skin, leaving behind something raw and exposed. All that was left was the man sitting in the hard plastic chair. All that was left was Leo\u2019s brother. He reached out and wrapped his huge hand around his brother's foot, the flesh beneath the thin blanket surprisingly cool. The contact was a desperate, grounding act. \"It's just us now, mate,\" he whispered to the still figure, the sound swallowed by the hum of the machines. \"Just us.\""

Baz became part of the ward's furniture, a large, silent figure perpetually folded into the uncomfortable visitor's chair. He learned the rhythms of the ICU: the hushed early morning handover between the night and day staff, the midday doctor\u2019s rounds, the quiet lull of the afternoon, the slow dimming of the lights as evening settled in. He spoke only when spoken to, answering the doctors\u2019 gentle, non-committal updates with a terse nod and the nurses\u2019 questions about his own wellbeing with a shake of his head. He was a statue of grief, rooted to the spot by a leaden combination of guilt and dread. His old life, the one filled with the roar of construction sites and the scent of baking pastry, felt like a story someone had once told him about a different person.\n\nHis body, once a finely tuned instrument of glorious, pointless ambition, was now just a source of dull, persistent pain. His back ached from the chair, a deep, grinding discomfort that he welcomed as a form of penance. Hunger was a hollow knot in his stomach, a constant reminder of his revulsion. He couldn\u2019t bring himself to eat. The nurses, Carol and Ben, would leave sandwiches or cups of soup on the small table by the door, but he ignored them until they were quietly cleared away, untouched. The only thing he forced himself to do was drink the water they brought him, a grim parody of his old training regimen. He would swallow the cold, tasteless liquid, feeling it fill his empty stomach not to stretch it for a competition, but simply to keep his body from shutting down completely. It was a mechanical act of self-preservation for which he felt no motivation beyond a primal instinct he couldn't quite extinguish.\n\nOn the third day, his phone, which he now kept on silent, lit up with a call from 'Mick the Mouth', his site foreman. For a moment, Baz just stared at it, the name a relic from a buried civilisation. He finally answered, stepping out into the corridor so his voice wouldn't disturb the ward\u2019s sacred quiet. \"Yeah,\" he grunted. \"Baz, mate, where the hell are you?\" Mick\u2019s voice boomed, full of gravel and worksite bonhomie. \"The lads are asking. You didn't show Monday, or yesterday. Everything alright? Pull a sickie and get lost on the piss?\" The casual assumption, so normal just a week ago, was now a profound insult. \"It's my brother,\" Baz said, his voice flat and dead. \"He's in hospital. Bad car accident.\" The line went quiet. Mick\u2019s tone, when he spoke again, was different, stripped of its usual bluster. \"Jesus, Baz. I'm sorry, mate. Shit. Is he\u2026 how is he?\" Baz recited the sterile litany\u2014ICU, coma, head injury\u2014with the tired precision of a man who had said the words too many times to himself. \"Look, mate, you just stay there,\" Mick said, his voice earnest. \"Don't you worry about work. I'll sort the roster. Just\u2026 you call me if you need anything. Anything at all, you hear?\" Baz hung up without replying, the offer of help feeling like it was coming from across an ocean. He was in a lifeboat with Leo, and everyone else was on a distant shore.\n\nWhen the suffocating quiet of Leo's room became too much, he would pace the corridors or sit in the main waiting area, a purgatory of uncomfortable chairs and outdated magazines. He started to recognise the other silent, haunted figures who shared his vigil. There was a young woman with purple-dyed hair who was always there, endlessly scrolling through pictures on her phone, her face a mask of numb despair. There was an older Italian couple who would arrive every morning with a small bag of food and sit holding hands, praying softly with a rosary. They never spoke to each other, this small, fractured community of watchers, but a silent understanding passed between them in weary, sidelong glances. They were all members of the same terrible club, initiated by a late-night phone call and bound by the hum and beep of life-sustaining machines.\n\nThe messages from his father tracked the agonisingly slow journey from the other side of the world. *Landed in Dubai. 6 hour layover.* *Boarding for Perth now. See you soon, son.* Each text was a small explosion of anxiety in Baz\u2019s chest. He had been alone in his grief, cocooned in the sterile bubble of the ICU. Soon he would have to share it. He would have to witness his mother's raw pain and his father's stoic, crumbling fa\u00e7ade. He would have to be the strong one, the one who had been on the ground, the one who knew the doctors' names and the nursing shifts. He found himself dreading their arrival almost as much as he craved it, the thought of their collective sorrow in one small room feeling like a weight that could crush them all.\n\nAn hour before they were due to arrive from the airport, Baz went into the small public bathroom near the waiting area. He splashed his face with cold water, the shock of it doing little to wake him from his stupor. He stared at his reflection in the cheap, steel-framed mirror and barely recognised the man looking back. His normally sun-browned face was pale and sallow, his eyes bloodshot and sunk deep into their sockets, ringed with dark purple smudges of exhaustion. A rough, patchy beard was invading the hard line of his jaw. He looked hollowed out, a ghost haunting his own skin. He thought of the triumphant, roaring man in the sun-scorched backyard, the man who had tasted a future paved with flaky pastry, and felt a bitter, empty laugh rise in his throat. That man was gone, maybe forever. He took a deep, shuddering breath, straightened his shoulders, and tried to arrange his features into a mask of grim competence. His parents would need him to be solid. He had to be the rock. The main event was about to begin."

They looked smaller than he remembered, and infinitely more fragile, as if the twenty-four-hour flight had aged them a decade. His mother, Mary, was leaning on his father\u2019s arm, her face a pale, crumpled mask of anxiety. His father, Frank, stood ramrod straight, but the effort of it was visible in the tight set of his jaw and the deep lines etched around his eyes. The doors hissed open and they saw him. His mother let out a small, wounded sound and rushed forward, her embrace a desperate, clinging thing that spoke of terror and a frantic need for reassurance. Baz wrapped his arms around her thin, trembling frame, smelling the faint, recycled air of the airplane cabin on her coat, and felt a fresh crack appear in his own fragile composure.\n\nFrank followed, placing a heavy hand on Baz\u2019s shoulder. His own hug was brief and awkward, the stiff embrace of a man who used actions, not affection, to express his love. \"Barry,\" he said, his voice raspy from the dry cabin air. He cleared his throat, his eyes scanning his son's face, taking in the exhaustion and despair. \"The doctor\u2026 what's the latest?\" The question was direct, a demand for facts in a situation that defied logic, a desperate attempt to find a solid handhold in a landslide of emotion. Baz\u2019s own words felt like they were dredged from the bottom of a well. He recited the cold facts\u2014the surgery, the hematoma, the induced coma\u2014his voice a monotone that barely disturbed the air.\n\n\"This way,\" Baz said finally, his voice sounding hollow to his own ears. He led them from the relative chaos of the main waiting room down the quiet, sterile corridor that had become his entire world. With each step, he could feel their dread mounting, mirroring the terror he had felt on his own first journey down this hall. He was the unwilling tour guide to the worst moment of their lives, and the responsibility was suffocating. He paused outside the glass wall of Leo\u2019s bay, taking a deep breath before he had to present his broken brother to his parents, steeling himself for the impact it would have.\n\nHe pushed the door open. Mary\u2019s hand flew to her mouth, and a strangled sob escaped, a sound of pure maternal agony that cut through the clinical beeping of the machines. She took a few stumbling steps towards the bed, her eyes fixed on Leo\u2019s still, pale face, the tube, the wires. \"Oh, my boy,\" she whispered, her voice shattering. \"My baby boy.\" She reached out a trembling hand but hesitated, as if afraid to touch him, to confirm the reality of it. Frank stood frozen in the doorway, his face ashen. The rigid control he had maintained dissolved, leaving behind a raw, naked pain that was more shocking than any tears. He stared at his younger son, the one who had gone to uni, the one with the bright future, now reduced to a collection of vital signs on a glowing screen. The sight seemed to rob him of breath, of strength, of hope.\n\n\"The machine breathes for him,\" Baz heard himself say, his voice a detached monotone. \"It helps his body rest. The doctor said the swelling in his brain is the main thing. We just\u2026 we have to wait for it to go down.\" The words were a script he had learned by heart, and reciting them now, to his parents, felt like a betrayal. He was explaining the mechanics of the tragedy, sanitising the horror. He felt his father\u2019s hand on his back, a brief, steadying pressure. Frank had moved to Mary's side, guiding her gently into the chair Baz had vacated. She finally reached out and took Leo\u2019s hand, her fingers wrapping around his, her other hand stroking his hair, murmuring to him in a low, continuous stream of love and encouragement, as if her voice alone could call him back from the silent depths.\n\nFrank pulled another chair over, and for a long moment, the three of them simply sat, a silent, grieving tableau united by the rhythmic hiss of the ventilator. The arrival of his parents had changed the room\u2019s atmosphere. It was no longer just Baz\u2019s private hell; it was a shared family catastrophe. After what felt like an eternity, Frank turned his gaze from Leo to his older son. He took in Baz's ragged appearance for the first time\u2014the sunken eyes, the stubble, the way his large frame seemed to have shrunk inside his clothes. \"Son,\" he said, his voice low and firm. \"You look like hell. When did you last eat something?\" The question, so simple and paternal, landed with the force of a physical blow. Baz just shook his head, unable to speak. The thought of food was still a violation. \"We're going to the cafeteria,\" Frank stated, not a suggestion but a command. \"You and me. Your mother will stay with him. You're no good to anyone like this.\" He stood up, a quiet, unshakeable authority radiating from him. For the first time in days, someone was telling Baz what to do, and the tired, broken part of him found he hadn't the strength to resist."

                                        "text": "The hospital cafeteria at night was a starkly-lit pocket of soulless functionality. The air smelled of burnt coffee and floor polish, a thin, unappetizing aroma that did nothing to stir the appetite. Frank navigated the short, empty queue with a grim purpose, returning with two plastic trays. On each was a plate bearing a dry-looking chicken schnitzel, a scoop of pale mashed potato, and a scattering of overcooked peas. He placed one in front of Baz and sat down opposite him, his movements economical and deliberate. \u201cEat,\u201d he commanded, picking up his own knife and fork.\n\nBaz stared at the plate. The food looked alien, an obscene offering in the face of his brother's silent battle upstairs. The schnitzel\u2019s breaded coating was the colour of sawdust, a pale mockery of the golden-brown pastry that had once been the centre of his universe. The thought made him feel sick. He pushed the tray away slightly, the plastic legs scraping on the linoleum. \"I can't, Dad.\"\n\nFrank put his cutlery down with a sharp clatter that made Baz flinch. He leaned forward, his gaze intense and unwavering. \u201cYour mother is up there, falling to pieces. Leo is fighting for his life. And you are sitting here, starving yourself like a bloody martyr. Who does that help, Barry? Does it help Leo? Does it help your mother? Does it help you?\u201d He jabbed a finger towards the plate. \u201cIt helps no one. So you will pick up that fork, you will cut that piece of chicken, and you will put it in your mouth. You will do it because I am telling you to. And you will do it because you need to be strong for them. We don't have the luxury of falling apart. Not yet.\u201d\n\nThe words were hard, brutal, and exactly what Baz needed to hear. They were a slap in the face, a violent jolt back to the world of the living. Shamed by the truth in his father's logic, Baz slowly pulled the tray back. His hands felt clumsy, his movements stiff, as if he were re-learning how to use his own body. He picked up the fork, the metal cool and heavy in his hand. He cut a small piece of the schnitzel and lifted it to his mouth. The texture was dry and tough, the taste was nothing, but he forced himself to chew, to swallow. It felt like swallowing sand. He took another bite, and then another, the mechanical action a form of obedience.\n\nThey ate in silence for several minutes. Frank seemed to sense that the spell of Baz\u2019s self-imposed fast was broken and did not push him further. Finally, his father put down his fork, his own plate half-eaten. \u201cNow,\u201d he said, his voice softer but no less firm. \u201cTell me about your day. The day it happened. Not just the accident. The whole thing.\u201d\n\nBaz kept his eyes fixed on the sad collection of peas remaining on his plate. He didn\u2019t want to revisit it, to give voice to the joy that now felt like a terrible sin. But his father\u2019s unwavering gaze demanded it. So he began. He spoke of the suffocating heat, the lethargy of the afternoon, and then the first phone call. He described the woman's crisp voice, the shock, the wild, pure elation of hearing he had made the final. He recounted his roar of triumph, the cold victory of the first beer, the feeling of invincibility. He forced himself to say the name out loud, a name that felt blasphemous in this sterile, hopeless place. \"The Golden Crust Championship,\" he mumbled, his voice thick with shame. \"It's\u2026 it was a professional pie-eating competition.\"\n\nHe braced himself for his father\u2019s reaction: a shake of the head, a dismissive sigh, a look of disappointment that his eldest son\u2019s greatest ambition was so profoundly absurd. He risked a glance at Frank, expecting to see a mask of weary disdain. But his father's expression was one of deep, quiet concentration. He was simply listening. So Baz kept talking. He told him about the call to Leo, about the teasing, the affectionate insults, the casual sign-off that was now seared into his brain. \u201cHe called me a madman,\u201d Baz whispered, the memory raw. \u201cHe was laughing.\u201d\n\nWhen he finished, the silence returned, heavier than before. Baz felt hollowed out, having confessed the full, shameful arc of his day, from its triumphant peak to its catastrophic end. Frank picked up a sachet of salt and slowly tore it open, sprinkling it over his remaining potatoes with a focused precision. \u201cThis pie thing,\u201d he said, not looking at Baz. \u201cLeo knew about it?\u201d\n\u201cYeah. He called it \u2018structured gluttony\u2019. He was always on at me about my cholesterol.\u201d\n\u201cBut he followed it, didn't he?\u201d Frank asked. \u201cHe knew you were in the qualifiers. He knew what it meant to you.\u201d\nBaz nodded, a lump forming in his throat. \u201cYeah. He did.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d his father said, finally meeting his gaze. His eyes were clear, his expression devoid of judgment. \u201cSo you had a moment of success in something you worked for. And you shared it with your brother. And he was proud of you, in his own smart-arse way. That\u2019s not a sin, Barry. That\u2019s a good memory. It might be one of the last good ones you have of him laughing. The accident didn't happen because you were happy. It just\u2026 happened.\u201d He pushed his own plate away. \u201cWhat happened to Leo is a tragedy. What you\u2019re doing to yourself is a waste. He wouldn\u2019t want that. He\u2019d be calling you a self-pitying berk and telling you to get your act together.\u201d\n\nThe words, a near-perfect imitation of Leo\u2019s own brand of tough love, hit Baz with the force of a physical blow. A dry, shuddering sob escaped him, a sound ripped from a place of grief so deep he didn\u2019t know it existed. His father didn\u2019t move to comfort him, didn't offer a platitude. He just let him cry, sitting with him in the harsh fluorescent light of the cafeteria, a silent, solid presence that asked for nothing and offered everything. For the first time in three days, Baz felt a flicker of something other than guilt and despair. It wasn't hope, not yet. It was something far simpler: a foundation. The solid, unshakeable ground of his father\u2019s pragmatism beneath his feet."

The air was still thick with the same clinical tension, the machines still beeped and hissed their relentless rhythm, but the crushing weight on Baz\u2019s own chest had lifted, just slightly. It was still there, a dense, heavy stone of grief, but he could breathe around it now. He looked at his mother, asleep in the chair, her hand still loosely holding Leo's, her face looking impossibly old and frail in the dim light. He looked at his father, who gave him a small, affirmative nod from the other side of the bed. And he looked at Leo, pale and still, a landscape of tubes and wires. The guilt hadn\u2019t vanished, but his father\u2019s harsh words had cauterised the wound of it, transforming the raw, weeping self-pity into a hard, functional scar. He was no longer a martyr at a vigil; he was a soldier on watch.\n\nA new, grim routine established itself. Baz became the family's anchor in the shifting tides of hospital life. He was the one who met with the doctors each morning, absorbing their cautious, jargon-filled updates and translating them into plain language for his parents. He learned the names of the nurses, the patterns of the monitors, the subtle shifts in the ward's atmosphere that signalled a change, good or bad. He forced himself to eat the bland, starchy food his father brought him, each mouthful a conscious act of defiance against the despair that threatened to consume him. He started leaving the hospital for one hour each day, striding around the concrete car parks and manicured lawns with a long, aggressive gait, not to escape, but to endure. The sun felt alien on his skin, the sounds of traffic a dispatch from another planet, but he subjected himself to it, a daily, disciplined re-entry into a world he no longer felt part of.\n\nHis phone, once a source of terror and shame, slowly became a tool again. Mick from work called to say the lads on site had passed a helmet around and wanted to know where to send the money. This time, Baz didn\u2019t snarl. He found his voice, thanked Mick, and gave him the details, his tone even and methodical. It was a conversation about logistics, and logistics were manageable. Friends from his footy club sent a stream of texts: *Thinking of you, mate. Let us know if you need anything.* He started to reply with a brief, \"Thanks. Will do.\" He was rebuilding the perimeter walls of his life, not as they were, but as they needed to be now: functional, fortified, and devoid of unnecessary sentiment.\n\nOne afternoon, sitting in the waiting room while his parents had a private moment with Leo, he idly flipped through a discarded newspaper. And there it was. A small article buried in the lifestyle section, a fluff piece about the upcoming National Golden Crust Championship in Melbourne. It featured a picture of last year\u2019s winner, a skinny man from Tasmania with a manic grin, holding a ludicrously oversized trophy shaped like a pie. Baz\u2019s stomach clenched in a familiar spasm of revulsion. He felt the heat rise in his face, the shame of his former obsession laid bare on the cheap newsprint. He started to crumple the page, to obliterate the stupid, triumphant grin and the ridiculous trophy.\n\nBut then his father\u2019s voice echoed in his mind, clear and firm as it had been in the cafeteria. *He was proud of you, in his own smart-arse way.* He stopped, his knuckles white around the crinkled paper. The last good memory. Leo's laugh, tinny over the phone. *You absolute madman.* The laughter hadn't been mocking; it had been affectionate, a celebration of his big brother's glorious, eccentric folly. Baz smoothed the page out on his knee, his calloused fingers tracing the outline of the trophy. The competition was no longer just about him. It was tangled up with Leo, with their final conversation. It was the last thing they had shared. He folded the article carefully and tucked it into his pocket, a strange and complicated secret.\n\nTwo days later, Dr. Reid found them in the family room. It was the first time they had all been summoned together since that first night, and the air crackled with a collective, held breath. \"We've been monitoring the pressure in Leo's brain,\" the doctor began, his face as professionally neutral as ever. \"The swelling has not gotten worse over the past forty-eight hours. It's stabilized. It's a small step, a very small one, but it is a step in the right direction. We're going to begin the process of slowly reducing the sedative medication to see if we can get a response.\" He held up a hand to quell the sudden, frantic surge of hope in Mary\u2019s eyes. \"This is not waking him up. It's a long process. We're just testing the waters. But it's progress.\"\n\nThe word hung in the air: *progress*. It wasn't a cure, it wasn't a promise, but it was the first piece of solid ground they had felt beneath their feet in over a week. His mother wept, but this time her tears were of relief, not just despair. His father squeezed his shoulder, a rare and powerful display of emotion. For Baz, the news landed differently. It was a signal. A crack of light in the oppressive darkness. It gave him an idea, a wild, illogical, and utterly insane plan that took root in the fertile ground of his grief and his father\u2019s advice. An idea only a madman would conceive. Leo\u2019s madman.\n\nThat night, after his parents had left for their nearby motel, exhausted but buoyed by the day's news, Baz sat alone by his brother\u2019s bed. The ICU was quiet, the lights low. He leaned in close to Leo's ear, the hiss of the ventilator a constant counterpoint to his words. \"They're gonna try and wake you up, you lazy bugger,\" he whispered, his voice thick. \"So you better be ready. You better start fighting.\" He paused, taking a deep breath. \"And I'm gonna do something, too. I'm going to get ready for Melbourne. For the Golden Crust.\" He said the words out loud for the first time since his angry phone call, and they tasted different now\u2014not of shame, but of purpose. \"I know, it's stupid. But you were laughing, mate. It was the last thing I heard you do. So I'm doing it. For you. A monument to glorious, pointless ambition, eh? Well, let's build it. You fight in here, and I'll fight out there. It's a deal.\"\n\nIt was a vow made to a silent man, a desperate bargain with an indifferent universe. It was a scaffold of purpose erected in the rubble of his life. Later, for the first time in nine days, he drove home. The small house was cold and smelled of stale air, a museum of a life that was no longer his. In the kitchen, the artisan pie still sat on the counter, a shrunken, mouldy fossil of his old ambition. He looked at it for a long moment, then picked it up without ceremony and dropped it into the bin. That part of his life was over. He wiped his hands, sat down at the rickety patio table where it had all begun, and opened his laptop. He didn't search for news on head injuries or recovery statistics. He navigated to the Australian Pie Association website and began to read, his face illuminated by the cold blue light of the screen. He studied the official pie weight, the diameter, the mandatory filling-to-pastry ratio, the specific blend of beef required. He was no longer Baz O\u2019Connell, dreamer. He was an athlete preparing for his event, an engineer studying a problem. His training was about to begin."

                                        "text": "The world outside the hospital walls became a gymnasium for Baz\u2019s grief. His morning runs along the Swan River were no longer about lung capacity; they were savage, punishing sprints. He would pound the pavement at dawn, the city\u2019s skyline a silent witness to his solitary war. He ran until his lungs burned with a fire that momentarily eclipsed the cold ache in his chest, until sweat blinded him and his legs screamed in protest. He ran for Leo, who couldn\u2019t move. He filled his lungs with the crisp morning air for Leo, whose every breath was a gift from a machine. It was a brutal, physical prayer, an act of motion against the terrifying stillness that had consumed his brother.\n\nHis house, once a refuge, transformed into a laboratory of pain and purpose. The kitchen became his training ground. After his father\u2019s words in the cafeteria, Baz had made a decision. He would not just train; he would dominate. He drove to a commercial bakery supply store and bought three dozen standard-issue foil pie tins. Then he went to the butcher and bought kilos of chuck steak, a bag of flour, a block of lard. Following the specifications he\u2019d downloaded from the APA website, he began to bake. The process was mechanical, devoid of any culinary joy. It was chemistry. He weighed the meat, measured the gravy thickeners, rolled the pastry to the precise millimetre. The first batch, ugly and imperfect, was for deconstruction. He sat at his kitchen table with a pie, a notepad, and a stopwatch, a surgeon preparing for a complex operation. He timed how long it took for the crust to yield, how long to clear the first mouthful, the optimal moment to use a gulp of water to clear his palate and throat. He catalogued heat retention, structural integrity, the way the filling sagged once the pastry shell was breached. It was the science of structured gluttony, and he was its most dedicated student.\n\nThe eating itself was a new form of torture. He would line the pies up on the counter, ten at a time, a row of identical, golden-brown discs of misery. He would start the stopwatch and begin. There was no pleasure, no savouring of flavour. It was a mechanical process of ingestion. Break, scoop, chew, swallow. Sip of water. Repeat. His jaw, strengthened by weeks of chewing the rubber block, worked with a relentless, piston-like efficiency. His stomach, stretched by litres of water, churned and rebelled. He would often finish a session leaning over the kitchen sink, his body convulsing, trying to reject the sheer volume of food he had forced into it. But he never let it. He would swallow the bile, take deep, shuddering breaths, and mark his time on the notepad. Each session was a battle fought and won, another small, agonising step on the road to Melbourne.\n\nOne afternoon, Frank let himself into the house, bringing a bag of clean laundry. He found Baz in the kitchen, halfway through a training run. Baz was pale, a sheen of sweat on his forehead, his eyes glazed with a fierce, inward focus. Six empty pie tins sat in a messy stack, and he was just starting on the seventh. He didn't seem to notice his father enter. Frank stopped in the doorway, his face a mixture of confusion and concern. He took in the scene: the almost manic intensity on his son\u2019s face, the pile of empty tins, the notepad covered in times and frantic scribbles. He looked at the pie in Baz\u2019s hand, the rich gravy dripping onto the counter, and then back at his son\u2019s hollowed-out eyes. He opened his mouth to say something, to tell him this was madness, but then he closed it. He saw not a man enjoying a feast, but a man performing a gruelling, self-inflicted task. He saw the discipline. He saw the work.\n\nFrank walked quietly to the sink, put the bag of laundry on a chair, and poured a tall glass of water from the tap. He placed it on the counter next to Baz\u2019s elbow, within easy reach. Baz flinched, startled from his trance, his eyes clearing for a moment as he saw his father. He braced himself for the lecture, the intervention. But Frank just nodded towards the glass. \"Hydration,\" he said, his voice level. \"You'll cramp up otherwise.\" He looked at the notepad. \"What's the record?\" Baz, momentarily thrown, stared at his father, then down at his notes. \"Twelve pies in ten minutes. Official record is fifteen,\" he mumbled, his mouth half-full. Frank nodded again, a flicker of something unreadable in his eyes\u2014not approval, but a kind of grim understanding. \"Well,\" he said, turning to leave. \"You'd better get back to it then. You're losing time.\"\n\nThe contrast between his two lives was a constant, dizzying shock. He would leave the house, his stomach a leaden, churning ball, the smell of baked meat clinging to his clothes, and drive back to the hushed, sterile world of the ICU. He would wash his hands with antibacterial soap until they were raw, trying to scrub away the scent of his training before he entered Leo\u2019s room. He would take his seat, his own body aching and bloated, and look at his brother, who was sustained by clear, colourless liquids in a bag. The absurdity of it all was a constant companion. One evening, after a particularly gruelling session, he leaned close to Leo's ear. \"Fourteen today, mate,\" he whispered, his voice hoarse. \"Hit a wall at twelve, but I pushed through. The pastry was a bit flaky on the last batch, cost me a few seconds. Need to add more shortening.\" He paused, placing his hand over his brother\u2019s. \"They took another tube out today. Dad said you squeezed Mum's hand. Or she thinks you did. So keep it up. You do your bit, I'll do mine. It's a deal.\""

Dr. Reid, during his morning rounds a week after Baz's parents had arrived, was performing a routine reflex test, tapping the sole of Leo's foot with a small instrument. Leo\u2019s toes curled. It was a faint, involuntary spasm, but it was a response. It was a signal from the deep, silent darkness, a flicker of neurological function where there had been none. Dr. Reid called it \"a positive development\" in his calm, measured tone, but to Baz, the words were a thunderclap. He felt a jolt of pure, electric energy, as if he had been physically struck. The deal was working. The message had been received. That afternoon, he drove to a specialty sports store and bought a weighted vest, adding ten kilos of resistance to his punishing morning runs, a new tithe of pain offered up to the god of his brother\u2019s recovery.\n\nHis training evolved from a grim duty into a fanatical obsession, a science of applied madness. He wasn\u2019t just eating anymore; he was studying. He spent hours online, not looking up medical journals, but scouring grainy footage from obscure competitive eating forums. He found videos of last year's Golden Crust champion, a wiry, frenetic man from Tasmania known as \"The Masticator,\" and watched them on a loop, his face inches from the laptop screen. He broke down the man's technique frame by frame, his notepad filling with diagrams and observations. He noted the way The Masticator used his left hand to crumple and fold the far edge of the pie crust inwards, creating a dam to stop the hot gravy from spilling. He analysed the specific angle of his head tilt to aid swallowing, the precise two-chew-one-gulp rhythm that minimized jaw fatigue. Baz would stand in front of his bathroom mirror, practicing the crimp-and-fold technique with a slice of untoasted bread, his reflection a bizarre parody of a man preparing for a title fight.\n\nHis father became his unwilling, silent accomplice. Frank started spending his afternoons not at the hospital, but in the tense, gravy-scented atmosphere of Baz\u2019s kitchen. He\u2019d arrive without a word, put the kettle on, and watch. He saw the plateaus, the moments where Baz would stare at the eighth or ninth pie, his body refusing to cooperate, his face pale with frustration and a flicker of panic. One afternoon, Frank walked over, picked up the stopwatch from the counter, and clicked it. \u201cGo again,\u201d he said, his voice flat. Baz, startled, looked up. His father\u2019s face was unreadable, but his stance was that of a coach, not a concerned parent. So Baz began. \u201cToo slow on the crust,\u201d Frank barked after the first pie. \u201cYou\u2019re losing two seconds on the turn. Stop thinking, just do it.\u201d He became Baz\u2019s timekeeper, his strategist, his corner man. He would call out splits, critique his form, and have a tall glass of water ready at the precise moment Baz\u2019s rhythm faltered. It was a strange, unspoken partnership, a father helping his son build a monument to pointless ambition because he understood, without ever saying it, that it was the only thing holding him together.\n\nThen, a setback. Leo developed a low-grade fever, a common complication, a minor infection that the doctors treated with a new course of antibiotics. They were calm, reassuring. To Baz, it was a catastrophe. The deal had been broken. He had failed. He hadn't pushed hard enough; his sacrifice had been insufficient. The guilt, which had receded to a manageable scar, tore open again, raw and bleeding. That night, he ran until the streetlights blurred into smeared lines of light, until his vision tunnelled and he collapsed, retching, onto a grass verge, his body convulsing with dry heaves. He had let his brother down. The thought was a physical torment, far worse than the ache in his muscles or the fire in his lungs.\n\nThe fever broke within thirty-six hours. Leo's condition stabilized, his vital signs returning to their previous baseline. The relief that washed over Baz was so profound it left him weak-kneed, but it was laced with a new, frantic desperation. He had to do more. The home kitchen was no longer enough. His training needed to be harder, a truer test of his resolve. One evening, he packed a cooler with a dozen freshly baked pies and several bottles of water and drove to a deserted local park. Under the lonely, buzzing glow of a single sodium lamp, surrounded by the sleeping quiet of the suburbs, he laid out his pies on a park bench and began. He ate against the clock, the night air cool on his sweat-drenched face, a lone dog-walker staring at him from the far side of the oval with a mixture of fear and bewilderment. Baz met the stranger's gaze, his own eyes wild and determined, his jaw working relentlessly. He was Leo\u2019s madman, and he would no longer hide it.\n\nThe competition was now less than two weeks away. The flights his father had quietly booked for him were a stark reality in his email inbox. It was time for a final, all-out assault. Baz declared his intention to his father: he was going to break the record. Sixteen pies. Not in Melbourne, but here, now, in his kitchen. It was his final offering before he left. Frank, his face set in a grim mask of resolve, stood ready with the stopwatch. The scene was primal. Baz was an engine of pure consumption, his movements stripped of all hesitation. Break, scoop, chew, swallow. The first ten pies went down in a blur of focused, painful efficiency. By twelve, his body was in open revolt. A wave of nausea, cold and sharp, rose in his throat. \u201cBreathe!\u201d Frank commanded, his voice cutting through the fog of pain. \u201cThrough your nose. Slower. Control it.\u201d Baz fought it down, his knuckles white where he gripped the edge of the counter. He got through thirteen, then fourteen. He slammed the fifteenth empty tin onto the stack, a clatter of triumph, and reached for the last one. His hand trembled. He couldn\u2019t. The wall was absolute. \u201cCome on, Barry!\u201d his father roared, a lifetime of stoic reserve channelled into that single, desperate command. \u201cFor Leo! Finish it!\u201d The name was a key, unlocking a final, hidden reserve of will. Baz snatched the pie, tore into it with a savage grunt, and forced it down in three monstrous, agonizing swallows. He threw the empty tin onto the pile and collapsed back into his chair, gasping, his body trembling, every muscle screaming. He had done it. Just as he dragged a ragged breath into his burning lungs, his phone, lying on the counter, began to ring. It was his mother. He stared at it, too exhausted to move, until Frank snatched it up and put it on speaker. \u201cMary? What is it?\u201d His mother\u2019s voice came through, high and broken, but not with grief. It was a sound of pure, unadulterated ecstasy. \u201cFrank! Oh, Frank! He opened his eyes! The doctor was here, he was talking to him, and he opened his eyes! He looked at me!\u201d Baz slowly lifted his head. His gaze met his father\u2019s across the wreckage of his training session. A single tear, hot and clean, cut a path through the sweat and grime on his cheek. The world was silent except for his mother\u2019s joyful, weeping voice and the frantic, triumphant beat of his own heart. The deal was real. He was going to Melbourne."

He was going to Melbourne. Frank took the phone, his own voice thick as he murmured reassurances to his wife, promising they\u2019d be there soon. When he ended the call, he didn\u2019t immediately move. He stood looking at his son, at the wreckage of the sixteen pies, at the tear tracking a clean path through the grime on Baz\u2019s cheek. The stoic mask he had worn for weeks finally cracked, not with a sob, but with a slow, weary exhalation that seemed to release all the tension he had been holding in his rigid frame. He walked over to Baz, not to clap him on the back or offer a word of praise, but to place a hand on his son\u2019s trembling shoulder. The grip was firm, a silent acknowledgment of the madness he had witnessed and enabled, a shared testament to the desperate, illogical, and miraculously successful bargain they had made.\n\nThe drive to the hospital was a surreal blur. The physical agony of his training session had evaporated, replaced by a humming, high-voltage current of pure adrenaline. He felt light, untethered, as if he could float out of the driver\u2019s seat. The city lights of Perth, which for weeks had seemed like distant, mocking constellations, were now sharp and brilliant, each one a celebration. He was no longer a ghost haunting the periphery of the world; he was hurtling towards its very centre. Frank sat in the passenger seat, silent, the dark landscape flashing across his face. There was nothing to say. Words were inadequate for the strange, sacred territory they had just traversed. They had stared into the abyss of grief and offered up a sacrifice of meat and pastry, and the abyss had blinked.\n\nThe atmosphere in the ICU had been transformed. The usual hushed tension was gone, replaced by a palpable, buzzing warmth. Mary was sitting by the bed, her face illuminated by a joy so profound it seemed to make her glow. She was holding Leo\u2019s hand, talking to him in a soft, steady stream, her voice no longer a desperate plea but a happy recounting of family stories. Leo was awake. His eyes, the same intelligent, deep-set eyes as his father's, were open. They were cloudy with medication and confusion, moving slowly, struggling to focus. The ventilator was gone, replaced by a small, clear tube delivering oxygen through his nose. He was breathing on his own. The sight was so overwhelming that Baz had to stop in the doorway, his hand braced against the frame to steady himself. This was victory, raw and absolute, and it was more terrifyingly beautiful than any trophy.\n\nBaz approached the bed slowly, his heavy boots silent on the linoleum floor. His mother looked up, her tear-streaked face breaking into a radiant smile. \"He's here, Leo,\" she whispered. \"Your big brother is here.\" Leo's gaze drifted from the ceiling and found Baz. For a long, silent moment, he just looked. There was a flicker in his eyes, a spark of recognition in the hazy depths, a faint furrowing of his brow as he tried to connect the haggard, triumphant figure before him to the brother he remembered. Baz knelt by the bed, bringing his face level with Leo's. \"Hey, you cheeky bugger,\" he said, his voice a low, rough rumble. \"About time you woke up. I hit sixteen today. Broke the record. Told you I would.\" He reached out and took Leo's free hand. It was weak, but the fingers curled, a deliberate, undeniable pressure. Leo\u2019s lips moved, a dry, faint whisper of a sound, too soft to be a word but more articulate than any speech. It was an answer.\n\nThat evening, the three of them sat in the bleak hospital cafeteria, the plastic trays of food untouched. It was a family conference under the fluorescent lights. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to go, Barry,\u201d Mary said, her voice soft. \u201cNow that Leo\u2019s\u2026 now that he\u2019s awake, you could stay.\u201d She wanted her family whole, her sons safe under her watch. Baz understood, but he shook his head. The purpose that had solidified in him was now unbreakable. Before he could explain, Frank spoke, his voice firm, cutting through the emotional haze. \u201cHe has to go,\u201d he said, looking not at Baz but at his wife. \u201cHe made a deal. A promise. You don\u2019t get a miracle and then walk away from your end of the bargain.\u201d He turned to Baz, his eyes holding a new respect. \u201cYou go to Melbourne. You finish this. Your mother and I will be right here. Leo will be here. He\u2019ll be watching.\u201d He understood completely. It was no longer about winning or losing. It was about seeing it through. It was about honour.\n\nThe morning of his flight, Baz stood by Leo\u2019s bedside for the last time. His bag was packed, his ticket was on his phone, and a taxi was waiting downstairs. Leo was more alert now, the fog beginning to lift. He could track conversations, his eyes following them around the room. A speech therapist had been in, and the first raspy, single-word answers were beginning to surface. Baz leaned down, the familiar scent of antiseptic now a smell of recovery, not crisis. \u201cI\u2019m off, mate,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ll have it on one of the sports channels. Tell Dad to find it for you.\u201d He squeezed his brother\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI\u2019ll bring you back that stupid trophy.\u201d Leo\u2019s eyes were fixed on him, his expression serious. His hand lifted a few inches from the bed, a weak but determined gesture, and his fingers formed a fist. He held it there for a moment, a silent, powerful message of solidarity. Then his lips formed a single, raspy word, the first full word he had spoken to his brother since the accident. \"Win.\""

                                        "text": "The flight to Melbourne was a dislocating experience. For weeks, Baz\u2019s world had been circumscribed by the four walls of a hospital room and the punishing circuit of his training runs. Now, sealed in a pressurised cabin at thirty thousand feet, he was adrift in a sea of blue sky, suspended between the two poles of his existence: the grim reality of Perth and the absurd theatre of Melbourne. He sat crammed into a window seat, his broad shoulders pressing against the fuselage, the muted roar of the engines a monotonous hum that vibrated through his bones. He was surrounded by the casual normality of travel\u2014businessmen tapping on laptops, families shushing tired children, couples reading magazines\u2014and he felt like a foreign object, an artifact from another, harsher reality that had been mistakenly placed among them.\n\nHe looked down at his hands, resting on his knees. They were a scaffolder's hands, thick with calluses and mapped with old scars, but they felt different now. He had remade them, repurposed them. He had trained their grip and their dexterity not for steel and bolts, but for the specific task of dismantling pastry and meat with maximum efficiency. He was a weapon calibrated for a single, ludicrous purpose, and the knowledge sat strangely within the profound exhaustion that had settled deep in his marrow. The sixteen-pie ordeal had left his body feeling hollowed out and strung tight, but Leo\u2019s whispered command, \"Win,\" was a fire in the centre of that emptiness, burning away fatigue and doubt. He wasn't flying to a competition; he was flying to a reckoning.\n\nThe hotel in Melbourne was another shock to the system. It was a sleek, modern tower of glass and steel in the heart of the city, a world of hushed carpets, soft lighting, and staff who greeted him with unnervingly bright smiles. The Australian Pie Association had put the six finalists up in a place that reeked of corporate expense accounts and fleeting luxury. His room was on the 24th floor, with a floor-to-ceiling window that offered a breathtaking, panoramic view of a city that was not his own. It felt like an alien landscape, a sprawling grid of glittering lights and endless motion. He dropped his bag on the luggage rack and walked to the window, pressing his palm against the cool glass. Down below, life was moving on, oblivious. Up here, he was utterly alone, a solitary monk in a five-star cell, preparing for the most ridiculous and most important ten minutes of his life.\n\nA crisp white envelope was waiting for him on the polished desk. It contained the official schedule for the \"Finalist Weekend.\" There was a \"Welcome Mixer\" that evening, a \"Media Breakfast\" the next morning, followed by a press conference and a photo call at the competition venue. The language was upbeat and full of exclamation points, a grotesque counterpoint to the raw gravity of his mission. He crumpled the itinerary in his fist. He had no intention of mixing. He was not here to make friends or to give soundbites to lifestyle bloggers. He was here to do a job. His phone buzzed, and his heart leaped into his throat, the reflex of the past few weeks still potent. But it was just a text from his father: *Leo\u2019s asking the nurse for a real cup of tea. Being a pain in the arse. Good sign. Focus on your end.* A slow grin spread across Baz\u2019s face, the first genuine, uncomplicated smile in what felt like a lifetime. Leo was being Leo. The deal was holding. He smoothed out the crumpled schedule, his focus narrowing. The mixer was in an hour. He would go. Not to socialise, but to scout the opposition. To look his rivals in the eye.\n\nThe welcome mixer was held in a private bar on the hotel's mezzanine level, a space filled with low, jazzy music and the clinking of glasses. A large banner emblazoned with the Golden Crust logo and portraits of the finalists hung on one wall. Baz saw his own face up there, a grim, unsmiling photo taken from his driver's license, looking starkly out of place next to the grinning, publicity-shot visages of the others. He grabbed a glass of water from a passing waiter and found a shadowy corner from which to observe. It didn\u2019t take long to identify them. The Masticator\u2014real name Kevin\u2014was exactly as he appeared in the videos: a wiry, hyperactive man with darting eyes, holding court with a small group of APA officials, his hands gesturing wildly as he spoke. He radiated a nervous, crackling energy, a man who seemed to be vibrating at a higher frequency than everyone else.\n\nAcross the room, a young man with a carefully sculpted haircut and trendy glasses was taking a selfie with his plate of canap\u00e9s. This, Baz surmised, was \"Gastro-Boy\" from Sydney, a university student whose YouTube channel was dedicated to extreme eating challenges. He was all style and performative confidence, more interested in his brand than the contest itself. Then there was the old-timer, a portly, gentle-looking man in a rumpled suit named Stan, who stood quietly by the cheese platter, looking slightly bewildered by the whole affair. A woman with impressively toned arms and a competitive glint in her eye was deep in conversation with a journalist\u2014she was \"The Python\" from Queensland, a personal trainer who had crossed over from bodybuilding competitions. And finally, there was the other big bloke, a cheerful, red-faced truck driver from regional Victoria who introduced himself to everyone as \"Big Dave.\" He was loud, jovial, and seemed to be treating the entire weekend as a free holiday. They were a collection of hobbyists, show-offs, and journeymen. Baz watched them all, his face a stony, unreadable mask. They were here for a laugh, for a bit of fame, for a free feed.

                                        "text": "## Chapter 6\n\nThe media breakfast the next morning was a buffet of manufactured enthusiasm. Held in a sun-drenched conference room, it was a blur of chirpy radio hosts, earnest local news reporters, and lifestyle bloggers taking artfully arranged photos of croissants. The other finalists were in their element. Gastro-Boy was conducting an Instagram Live session, narrating his choice of fruit salad to his phone. The Masticator darted from table to table, a whirlwind of soundbites and frantic energy. Big Dave had a small crowd laughing as he recounted a story about a misadventure involving a roadhouse pie and a runaway emu. They were performers, and this was their stage.\n\nBaz sat at a table by himself, a solitary mountain of quiet menace amidst the forced conviviality. In front of him sat a single glass of water and a black coffee. He ignored the glistening pastries, the platters of cured meats, the steaming chafing dishes of scrambled eggs. His body was a machine, and this was not its fuel. He drank his water in slow, measured sips, his gaze distant, his mind a thousand miles away in a quiet hospital room in Perth. He was an observer, not a participant, and his stark disinterest was a more powerful statement than any boast. A young reporter approached him tentatively, notebook in hand. \u201cMr. O\u2019Connell? You\u2019re very focused. Any pre-game jitters?\u201d Baz\u2019s eyes met his, and the reporter visibly flinched at the cold, hard intensity he found there. \u201cNo,\u201d Baz said, his voice a low rumble. The reporter mumbled a thank you and scurried away.\n\nThe press conference was worse, a staged spectacle held in a small auditorium packed with media. The six finalists sat on a raised platform behind a long table draped in a Golden Crust banner. A slick, over-caffeinated host worked his way down the line, asking predictable questions that elicited predictable answers. Big Dave promised to \u201cdo the country proud.\u201d The Python spoke about \u201cmetabolic conditioning and mental fortitude.\u201d Gastro-Boy plugged his social media handles. When the host finally got to Baz, the last in the line, he seemed momentarily thrown by his silent, brooding presence. \u201cAnd finally, the dark horse from the West, Baz O\u2019Connell! Baz, you\u2019ve been the quiet man of the competition so far. What\u2019s your secret? What\u2019s motivating you to take home the Golden Crust?\u201d\n\nA hush fell over the room. All eyes were on him. This was the moment for a folksy anecdote, a confident boast, a charming display of ambition. Baz leaned forward, bringing his mouth close to the microphone. The air crackled with anticipation. \u201cI made a promise,\u201d he said. The two words dropped into the room like stones into a silent pond. He offered no explanation, no smile, no further detail. He just leaned back in his chair, his expression unchanging, his gaze fixed on a point on the back wall. The host, momentarily speechless, stammered for a second before quickly moving on, but a new kind of respect, mingled with confusion, had settled over the room. The other contestants glanced at him, their own easy confidence faltering for a moment in the face of his stark, unfathomable gravity.\n\nHe skipped the finalist luncheon, retreating to the sanctuary of his hotel room. The silence was a balm after the morning\u2019s circus. He stripped off the polo shirt the APA had insisted they all wear and stood in front of the vast window, looking out over the sprawling city. He wasn\u2019t seeing the towers or the traffic; he was seeing the face of his brother, the weak but determined fist, the single, raspy word: *Win*. He took out his phone and dialled. His mother answered, her voice tired but happy. Leo was out of the ICU and in a regular ward. He was complaining about the food and had argued with a nurse about the volume on the television. He was healing. He was coming back. \u201cPut him on,\u201d Baz said. There was a rustle, and then Leo\u2019s voice, stronger now, clearer, but still laced with the grit of his injuries. \u201cYou better not be calling to say you lost already.\u201d\n\nA laugh, a real, genuine laugh, escaped Baz\u2019s lips. It felt like a foreign sound. \u201cNot yet, dickhead. It\u2019s in a few hours.\u201d\n\u201cGood,\u201d Leo said. \u201cDon\u2019t come back without the stupid trophy. Dad\u2019s trying to figure out how to stream it on his phone. It\u2019s embarrassing.\u201d\n\u201cTell him I\u2019ll do my best,\u201d Baz said, his own voice thick with an emotion he couldn\u2019t name.\n\u201cDon\u2019t do your best,\u201d Leo\u2019s voice commanded, a sudden, fierce clarity cutting through the line. \u201cJust do it.\u201d\n\nThe call ended, leaving a profound stillness in the room. Just do it. The simple, brutal instruction was all he needed. He spent the next few hours in a state of meditative calm. He did the slow, deliberate stretches his father had taught him as a young footballer. He lay on the floor and practiced the deep, diaphragmatic breathing that would keep the panic at bay. He mentally rehearsed the first three minutes of the competition: the initial attack on the pie, the crimp-and-fold, the rhythm of chew and swallow, the precise timing of the first sip of water. He was a diver preparing to enter the crushing deep, a soldier field-stripping his weapon in the dark.\n\nAn hour before the event, a van collected them from the hotel lobby. The mood inside was a cacophony of nerves. The Masticator was bouncing his leg, muttering to himself. Big Dave was cracking dad jokes that no one was laughing at. Baz sat in the back, his eyes closed, a cocoon of silence in the midst of the nervous chatter. The competition was being held in a large, converted warehouse on the city\u2019s fringe, now packed with a roaring crowd and bathed in the hot, white glare of television lights. Backstage was a chaotic maze of cables, road cases, and harried-looking crew members. The smell hit him immediately: hot metal, baking pastry, and an overwhelming, industrial-grade wave of rich, dark gravy. To the others, it was the smell of glory. To Baz, it was the smell of the finish line.\n\nThey were led to a small holding area, a roped-off space with a few chairs and a table laden with bottles of water. The roar of the crowd was a constant, physical presence, a wave of sound that beat against the thin walls. The other finalists paced, stretched, and tried to psych each other out with last-minute bravado. Baz simply stood, his hands resting on the back of a chair, his breathing slow and even. He felt a strange and total calm descend upon him. He had run his race, he had paid his dues, he had offered up his sacrifice. All that was left was this final, absurd ceremony. A crew member with a headset bustled over. \u201cFive minutes, everyone! Let\u2019s get ready!\u201d The Masticator cracked his knuckles with a sound like a gunshot. The Python took a final, deep swig of water. Big Dave clapped his hands together with a loud, booming slap. Baz just closed his eyes and saw his brother\u2019s face. He was ready. A voice boomed over the PA system, cutting through the din, \"Finalists to the stage!\" and Baz O\u2019Connell, scaffolder and brother, stood up to finish the job."

                                        "text": "## Chapter 7\n\nWalking out onto the stage was like stepping into the heart of a furnace. A wall of sound from the packed crowd hit him first, a physical force that vibrated in his teeth, followed by the blinding white heat of the television lights. The air was thick with the scent of hot gravy and the electric tang of mass anticipation. The other finalists soaked it in. Big Dave waved to the crowd with both hands, a huge, folksy grin on his face. Gastro-Boy made a heart-shape with his hands, playing to a camera. The Masticator shadow-boxed the air, a bundle of frantic energy. Baz walked with the slow, deliberate tread of a man heading to a gallows or an altar. He didn't look at the crowd, didn't acknowledge the cameras. His gaze was fixed on the long table at the centre of the stage, on the empty chair with his name on it. He was a gladiator, and this was his arena. The noise, the lights, the spectacle\u2014it was all just weather.\n\nHis station was a small universe of its own. A stack of twenty pies, perfect golden discs of menace, sat to his left. Each was identical to the ones he had baked and forced down in his lonely kitchen, the official eight-centimetre diameter, the regulation 220-gram weight. To his right were four bottles of water, their labels stripped off. A large digital clock hung above the stage, its red numerals currently dark. The host, a man with a dazzling smile and a voice that never dipped below a shout, was doing his final introductions, his words a meaningless roar in the background. Baz sat down, adjusted the chair, and placed his hands flat on the table. He took one deep, slow breath, then another, pulling the air deep into the lungs he had so brutally conditioned. The world dissolved. There was no crowd, no host, no Masticator bouncing beside him. There was only the stack of pies, the water, and the promise. He heard Leo\u2019s voice, raspy but clear: *Win*. The clock above him lit up: 10:00.\n\nThe countdown began, a primal chant from the crowd led by the host. \"Ten! Nine! Eight!\" With each number, Baz's focus narrowed, the periphery of his vision greying out until all that remained was the single pie directly in front of him. \"Three! Two! One!\" A klaxon horn blared, a brutal, ugly sound that shattered the tension. In the same instant, Baz\u2019s hands moved. It wasn\u2019t a frantic grab, but a swift, practiced motion. His left hand seized the pie, his right hand, holding a plastic fork, plunged into its centre, breaking the crust with a soft, yielding crack. The Masticator was already a blur of motion beside him, shoving half a pie into his mouth at once. Big Dave attacked his with brute force, like a bear swiping at a honeycomb. Baz ignored them. He executed the crimp-and-fold, his left thumb expertly tucking the crust inwards to contain the molten filling. Break, scoop, chew twice, swallow. His movements were a brutal ballet, a sequence of violent efficiency he had rehearsed to the point of absolute instinct. The first pie was gone in twenty-two seconds. He dropped the empty tin onto the floor and his left hand was already reaching for the next.\n\nThe first three minutes were a blur of autonomous action. He was a machine performing its one, terrible function. The world was reduced to a rhythm: the soft crunch of pastry, the heat of the gravy, the muscular clench of his jaw, the hard swallow. After the third pie, he took a precisely timed sip of water, just enough to clear the accumulating clag from his throat without wasting precious stomach capacity. He could feel the heat building in his core, the first rumblings of protest from his body, but he walled it off, pushing the discomfort into a small, locked room in the back of his mind. His stack of empty tins grew with a steady, metronomic cadence. He didn't look up, didn't check the clock, didn't glance at his rivals. The plan was the plan. The only opponent was himself.\n\nAt the five-minute mark, the halfway point, the wall arrived. It was a physical sensation, a sudden, violent lurch in his gut as his stomach screamed that it was full, that any more would be a violation. Cold sweat broke out on his brow. The rich, meaty flavour that had been merely functional now became actively nauseating. He was on his ninth pie, and the mouthful he had just taken refused to go down. He could feel the panic coiling, the primal urge to retch. *Breathe! Through your nose. Control it.* His father\u2019s voice, barked across the kitchen, echoed in his ears. He closed his eyes for a split second, forcing a long, slow breath through his nostrils. He pictured the hospital, the hiss of the ventilator, the fragile, stubborn line of Leo\u2019s heartbeat on the monitor. He swallowed. The mouthful went down. He opened his eyes, picked up the fork, and went back to work.\n\nThe host\u2019s voice, amplified to a deafening roar, cut through his concentration. \u201cIt\u2019s a two-horse race, ladies and gentlemen! The Masticator from Tassie and the big man from the West are neck-and-neck at twelve pies apiece! But look at the technique! O\u2019Connell is clean, precise, a surgeon at work! Kevin is wearing half of his on his shirt!\u201d Baz risked a flicker of a glance to his side. The Masticator was a whirlwind of chaos, gravy smeared across his face and chest, his breathing ragged and shallow. He was fast, but he was losing energy, his frantic pace becoming unsustainable. Big Dave had slowed to a crawl, his face a dangerous shade of purple. Gastro-Boy had his head in his hands. The Python was steady but a full two pies behind. It was just him and the madman from Tassie.\n\nWith two minutes left on the clock, a profound and terrible clarity descended upon Baz. The pain was no longer a distraction; it was fuel. His body was a distant, screaming thing that he was no longer connected to. He was pure will. He finished his fourteenth pie, matching the number that had almost broken him in training, and reached for the fifteenth. His movements were still economical, but a new speed had entered them, an urgency born of desperation and purpose. He saw The Masticator falter, choking on a mouthful, his rhythm broken. It was the opening. This was the moment. *For Leo! Finish it!* His father\u2019s roar from that final training session detonated in his memory. He attacked the fifteenth pie with a savagery that startled even himself, demolishing it in a few monstrous, jaw-straining bites. He was reaching for the sixteenth as the clock ticked past the one-minute mark.\n\nThe final sixty seconds were an eternity of agony. Every swallow was a battle, every breath a conscious effort. The crowd was a single, continuous roar, a physical wave of sound pushing him forward. He was aware of nothing but the pie in his hand, the clock, and the promise. He finished the sixteenth pie, tying the record he had set in the lonely silence of his kitchen. The Masticator had stalled, coughing, at fifteen. Baz\u2019s hand, shaking uncontrollably, closed around the seventeenth pie. Ten seconds. He plunged his fork in. Nine. He raised it to his lips. Eight. The crowd was counting down. Seven. He forced a huge mouthful in. Six. He chewed once, a Herculean effort. Five. He swallowed, a searing, tearing motion. Four. Three. Two. He couldn't take another bite. He was done. One. The klaxon blared again, its final, deafening note cutting through the noise.\n\nSilence. In the sudden absence of the horn, the roar of the crowd seemed to double in volume, but for Baz, the world had gone utterly quiet. He dropped the half-eaten seventeenth pie onto the table. His hands, smeared with grease and gravy, were shaking violently. His entire body was trembling with a combination of massive adrenaline dump and profound physical trauma. He sagged back in his chair, his head lolling, his chest heaving as he dragged ragged, painful breaths into his tortured lungs. It was over. He had nothing left. He had given it all. He closed his eyes, and in the swirling darkness behind his eyelids, he saw a hospital room, a faint, recovering smile, and a brother who was alive.\n\nThe judges, in their crisp white coats, swarmed the stage. The host was screaming into his microphone, lost in the delirium of the moment. Baz didn\u2019t hear him. He was floating, disconnected. After what felt like a lifetime, a heavy, metallic object was thrust into his hands. It was the trophy. The ridiculous, oversized, golden pie. It was heavier than he expected. He opened his eyes and looked at it, this monument to his glorious, pointless ambition. He looked out at the roaring, faceless crowd, at the blinding lights, at the confetti that was beginning to fall from the ceiling. There was no joy, no elation, no triumphant roar. There was only a vast, bone-deep, and deeply peaceful sense of release. He had kept his promise. He had won. He lifted the trophy, not in a gesture of victory for the crowd, but as a silent salute to a hospital room a thousand miles away. He had done his part. He could finally go home."

                                        "text": "The aftermath was a strange, muffled chaos. The host was shouting something into his microphone, his voice a distorted boom in Baz\u2019s ears. People were slapping his back, their faces a blur of ecstatic grins. Flashbulbs strobed like lightning in a storm, imprinting bleached-out images onto the back of his eyelids. He felt a hand on his shoulder and turned to see The Masticator, his face wiped clean of gravy but still flushed with exertion. The wiry Tasmanian\u2019s eyes, which had been manic and wild, were now clear and held a look of profound, almost awestruck respect. He didn\u2019t say anything. He just nodded once, a sharp, definitive gesture, and clapped Baz on the shoulder before being swallowed by the throng.\n\nThe host, his professional smile unwavering, thrust the microphone back into Baz\u2019s face. \u201cUnbelievable! A new Golden Crust record! Baz O\u2019Connell, you came here as a dark horse, a man of few words. Now you\u2019re the king! What are you feeling right now? Tell Australia what this moment means to you!\u201d Baz looked past the man\u2019s perfect teeth, past the blinding lights, and found the unblinking red eye of a television camera. He knew that somewhere, on the other side of that lens, in a quiet hospital room, his brother was watching. He lifted the trophy slightly, the polished metal cool against his trembling, sticky fingers. His voice, when it came, was not a roar of victory, but a low, raw statement of fact, scraped from the very bottom of his exhausted soul. \u201cThis is for my brother, Leo,\u201d he said. And then he said no more.\n\nThe simplicity of the statement, its stark and unadorned sincerity, cut through the manufactured hype like a razor. A ripple of quiet went through the crowd nearest the stage, and the host, for the first time all night, was momentarily speechless. He recovered quickly, launching into another volley of superlatives, but the moment had passed. The circus had been punctured by a sliver of raw, undeniable truth. Janice from the APA was suddenly at his side, her face alight with a mixture of professional triumph and genuine concern. \u201cBaz, that was incredible! We need to get you to the media pen, Channel 7 wants a live cross\u2026\u201d she began, her hand on his elbow, trying to steer him. He gently but firmly shook his head, disengaging her hand. He clutched the trophy to his chest like a shield and began to push his way through the backstage crush, a single, unswerving thought in his mind: he had to get out.\n\nHe found refuge in a concrete stairwell, the air cool and smelling of dust and damp. The roar of the crowd was a muted, distant thunder. He leaned his head against the cold wall, the silence a deafening relief after the sensory assault of the stage. His hands were still shaking, so violently he could barely operate his phone. He scrolled through his contacts, past Mick the Mouth and the boys from the footy club, and pressed the call button next to \u2018Dad\u2019. It rang once. \u201cWe saw, son,\u201d Frank\u2019s voice came through, thick with an emotion Baz had never heard from him before. \u201cWe all saw. Your mother is crying her eyes out.\u201d There was a pause, a rustle. \u201cLeo\u2026 he\u2019s smiling. He\u2019s telling me you looked like a bloody pelican, but he\u2019s smiling.\u201d\n\nA sound escaped Baz\u2019s throat, a strangled half-laugh, half-sob. He slid down the wall until he was sitting on the dusty steps, the heavy trophy in his lap. \u201cI did it, Dad,\u201d he whispered, the words barely audible. \u201cI told you he would,\u201d Frank said, not to Baz, but to someone else in the room. Then, back to the phone, his voice firm and clear. \u201cWe know, son. You kept your promise. Now get some rest. It\u2019s time to come home.\u201d The line clicked dead. Baz didn't move for a long time, sitting in the quiet stairwell, the weight of the golden pie on his lap a grounding, final anchor. The deal was paid in full.\n\nHe was eventually found by an APA official and led, not to the media pen, but to a small, curtained-off medical area. A young doctor with kind, tired eyes took his blood pressure, listened to his heart, and shone a light in his eyes. \u201cWell, Mr. O\u2019Connell,\u201d he said, pulling the stethoscope from his ears. \u201cYour heart is beating like a drum kit falling down a flight of stairs and your blood pressure is\u2026 astronomical. Physically, you\u2019ve put your body through the equivalent of running a marathon while being mildly poisoned.\u201d He gave Baz a wry look. \u201cCongratulations, I guess. My professional medical advice would be to maybe not do this again. Ever.\u201d Baz just nodded, the clinical assessment a strange and fitting postscript to his absurd ordeal.\n\nThe van ride back to the hotel was silent. The other finalists had already gone. It was just Baz, the quiet driver, and the trophy sitting on the passenger seat beside him, its absurd form glinting in the passing streetlights. Back in the sterile quiet of his room, he walked over to the desk and placed the trophy down. He didn't polish it, didn't pose with it, didn't even give it a second glance. Its purpose had been served. It was no longer a monument; it was just a thing, a heavy, gilded paperweight. He stripped off his gravy-spattered shirt, walked into the bathroom, and stared at the man in the mirror. He looked like a shipwreck survivor. His face was pale and drawn, his eyes bloodshot and sunk deep in their sockets. There was a smear of dried gravy on his cheek he hadn't noticed. This was the face of a champion. This was the face of a man who had kept his promise.\n\nIgnoring the torrent of congratulatory texts that were making his phone buzz incessantly on the nightstand, he sat down at the desk. He opened his laptop, the cool blue light illuminating his exhausted face. He went to the airline\u2019s website, the movements of his fingers slow and deliberate. He found his booking, the return flight to Perth scheduled for two days\u2019 time, after the \"Champion\u2019s Parade and Farewell Brunch.\" He cancelled it without a moment\u2019s hesitation. He then booked a new ticket on the first available flight. A red-eye, leaving in four hours. His work in Melbourne was done. His real life was waiting for him."

                                        "text": "The journey to Melbourne airport in the dead of night was a passage through a ghost city. Baz sat in the back of a taxi, the Golden Crust trophy on the seat beside him, its absurd, gilded form catching the strobing colours of the traffic lights. The driver kept glancing at him in the rearview mirror, a mixture of awe and confusion on his face. \u201cSaw you on the telly, mate,\u201d he\u2019d said when Baz had loaded the trophy into the cab. \u201cUnbelievable. You looked like you were gonna explode.\u201d Baz had just grunted in response, his gaze fixed on the empty streets. He was no longer the champion, the man on the television. He was just a passenger on a journey, and the man he had been a few hours ago was already a stranger to him.\n\nAt the airport, he was an anomaly. A hulking, exhausted figure in a gravy-stained shirt, carrying a trophy the size of a car tyre through the deserted check-in hall. A few late-night travellers and weary airport staff stopped and stared, whispering and pointing. He ignored them. The trophy, which had felt so heavy on stage, now felt impossibly light, a hollow, tinny thing. It was just a prop, and the play was over. Getting it through security was a final, farcical act. The young officer at the X-ray machine stared at the screen, then at Baz, then back at the screen, his face a mask of disbelief. \"I'm gonna... I'm gonna have to swab this for explosives, mate,\" he said, trying and failing to sound professionally detached. Baz just nodded, submitting his monument to pointless ambition to the final indignity of a chemical wipe-down.\n\nOn the plane, he managed to wedge the trophy into the overhead locker after a brief, awkward struggle. He sank into his seat, the plane\u2019s recycled air a welcome, sterile coolness on his feverish skin. He didn\u2019t sleep. He couldn\u2019t. His body was a warzone of conflicting signals\u2014adrenaline, exhaustion, pain, and a profound, bone-deep relief. He leaned his forehead against the cool plastic of the window and watched as the lights of Melbourne receded, shrinking to a glittering web on a dark velvet cloth before disappearing completely. Below him, the vast, sleeping continent of Australia passed by, a dark and silent land. He was travelling from one life back to another, and the five-hour flight was a timeless, liminal space between the two. He thought of his father\u2019s words: *You don\u2019t get a miracle and then walk away from your end of the bargain.* He had held up his end. Now he was going home to see the miracle for himself.\n\nHe landed in Perth as the sun was beginning to cast its first pale, golden light across the horizon. The air that hit him as he stepped out of the terminal was instantly, comfortingly familiar\u2014dry, warm, with the faint, resinous scent of eucalyptus. It was the smell of home. He hailed a taxi, placing the trophy on the back seat with a weary sigh. \u201cWhere to, mate?\u201d the driver asked, a cheerful woman with a messy grey ponytail. \u201cRoyal Perth Hospital,\u201d Baz said. The driver\u2019s eyes met his in the rearview mirror. \u201cVisiting hours are a bit later, mate. You sure?\u201d Baz just nodded, his gaze already fixed on the familiar landmarks passing by the window. \u201cI\u2019m sure,\u201d he said.\n\nHe walked through the hospital\u2019s automatic doors just as the first shift of day nurses was arriving, their faces fresh and their coffee cups full. The corridors, which had been his purgatory for so many weeks, were quiet, filled with the soft, promising light of a new day. He didn\u2019t need to ask for directions. He knew the way by heart. He found Leo\u2019s new room on the fourth floor, in the rehabilitation ward. He stopped outside the closed door, his heart hammering against his ribs with a force that rivalled the competition\u2019s final moments. This was the real test. This was the final finish line. He took a deep breath, the clean, antiseptic smell a strange comfort, and pushed the door open.\n\nThe room was bathed in the gentle morning sun. Frank was asleep in one of the visitor\u2019s chairs, his head tilted back at an uncomfortable angle, a newspaper fallen across his lap. Mary was dozing in the other, her head resting on her arms on the edge of the bed. And in the bed, propped up by a wedge of pillows, was Leo. He wasn't looking at the door. His gaze was fixed on the window, watching the galahs squabble in a gum tree outside. He was thinner, paler, a faint scar tracing a pale line along his temple, but his eyes were clear. He was here. He was whole. Baz didn't say a word. He walked quietly into the room and placed the Golden Crust trophy on the end of the bed.\n\nThe soft thud of the trophy\u2019s base on the blanket made Leo turn his head. His eyes widened, first at the ridiculous, glittering object, and then they lifted to meet his brother\u2019s. A slow, lopsided grin spread across his face, the first one Baz had seen in what felt like a hundred years. It was the same fond, exasperated smile he had pictured so many times. \u201cJesus, Baz,\u201d Leo said, his voice a low, gravelly rasp, but unmistakably his. \u201cIt\u2019s even stupider looking in real life.\u201d\n\nBaz felt the tension of the past month, the grief, the guilt, the fanatical discipline, all dissolve in that single, perfect moment. A grin stretched across his own face, a wide, tired, triumphant baring of teeth. \"Yeah, well,\" he said, pulling the remaining visitor\u2019s chair to the bedside. \"You\u2019re the one who told me to win it.\" He sank into the chair, the exhaustion hitting him like a physical blow. Leo\u2019s eyes roamed over him, taking in the pale, gaunt face, the gravy-stained shirt, the deep, dark circles under his eyes. \"You look like shit,\" Leo stated, the affection in the insult as clear as day. \"You look worse,\" Baz shot back without missing a beat.\n\nThey sat in comfortable silence for a moment, the quiet hum of the hospital around them. Mary stirred, her eyes fluttering open. She saw Baz, and her face crumpled with a pure, uncomplicated joy. She reached out and gripped his arm, her other hand never leaving Leo\u2019s. Frank snorted and woke with a start, his eyes immediately finding his two sons, together, awake, and safe. A slow, satisfied smile touched his lips. The family was whole again. Baz leaned back in his chair, his gaze shifting from the trophy, to his parents, and finally back to his brother. The trophy was just a ridiculous piece of metal. This, right here, was the prize. This was the victory. He closed his eyes, the morning sun warm on his face, the sound of his brother\u2019s quiet, steady breathing the only sound that mattered in the world. He was home."

                                        "text": "## Chapter 8\n\nThe fragile, sacred silence of the room was broken by the soft squeak of rubber-soled shoes. A nurse Baz recognised as Carol, the kind, middle-aged woman from his first terrible night in the ICU, appeared in the doorway with a breakfast tray. She stopped dead, her practiced hospital smile faltering as she took in the scene. Her gaze went from Leo, awake and alert in the bed, to the exhausted, grime-streaked giant sitting beside him, and finally to the ludicrously large, glittering gold trophy at the foot of the bed. Her eyes widened, and a slow, bewildered smile spread across her face. \"Well,\" she said, her voice a mixture of amusement and disbelief. \"I've seen flowers, I've seen balloons, and I've seen a man try to bring in a live goat for 'therapy,' but I can honestly say that's a first.\" She placed the tray with its plastic-covered plate of scrambled eggs on the rolling table and looked at the trophy. \"Is that what I think it is? I saw a bit of it on the morning news.\"\n\nLeo pointed a weak finger at his brother. \"His,\" he croaked, a spark of mischief in his tired eyes. \"He's the idiot who won it.\" The statement, a perfect distillation of their brotherly dynamic, made Mary laugh through her tears. Frank just shook his head, a look of weary pride on his face. The story was already becoming a legend, a bizarre and unbelievable tale that would be told and retold. The trophy was no longer just a symbol of a private, desperate bargain; it was now a public artifact, a conversation piece, a shining, ridiculous testament to a brother's love. The weight of it all, the weeks of sleeplessness, the brutal training, the sheer, crushing stress, suddenly landed on Baz with the force of a physical blow. The adrenaline that had carried him across the country and through the competition finally drained away, leaving a vast, hollow emptiness in its place. The room began to tilt, the edges of his vision blurring into a soft, grey haze. He felt a hand on his shoulder and looked up to see his father\u2019s concerned face.\n\n\"Alright, son,\" Frank said, his voice firm but gentle. \"You've done your bit. Go home. Sleep.\" Baz tried to protest, to say he was fine, but the words wouldn't come. His body had made the decision for him. He felt his mother's hand on his arm, her touch a soft, insistent pressure guiding him to his feet. He allowed himself to be led from the room, his movements clumsy and slow. As he reached the door, he looked back. Leo had lifted a hand in a slow, weak wave, his eyes following his brother with a look of profound, unspoken gratitude. Baz nodded once, a promise that he would be back, and then he was gone, leaving the trophy to stand watch in his place.\n\nThe ute, which had sat silent in the hospital car park for what felt like a lifetime, coughed to life with a familiar, comforting rumble. Driving home through the bright morning traffic was an out-of-body experience. The world seemed too loud, too fast, too full of colour. His own small house felt like a stranger's when he walked in. The air was stale, and the faint, lingering smell of old gravy and baked pastry hung in the kitchen like a ghost. He walked over to the counter where his notepad still lay, covered in its frantic calculations of times and weights and consistencies. Beside it was the stack of empty tins from his final, record-breaking training session. He looked at them for a long moment, the tools of his strange and painful vocation. There was no anger, no shame, no triumph. He simply gathered them all up\u2014the notepad, the tins, the specialised rubber block he\u2019d found on the floor\u2014and walked them out to the wheelie bin in the backyard. He dropped them in, the clatter of the tins a final, percussive endnote to the whole mad symphony.\n\nHe walked back inside, stripped off his filthy, sweat-stiffened clothes, and stood under a scalding hot shower for twenty minutes, letting the water wash away the grime of Melbourne and the lingering scent of his ordeal. He didn't think. He just felt the heat on his aching muscles, the steam filling his lungs, the slow, steady release of a tension he had carried for so long it had become part of his own skeleton. He stumbled into his bedroom, the unfamiliar softness of the carpet a luxury under his bare feet, and fell into bed. He was asleep before his head fully hit the pillow, plunging into a deep, dreamless, and profound darkness. It was not the troubled, fitful sleep of a worried sentry, but the bottomless, healing oblivion of a soldier whose war was finally over.\n\nHe woke to the sun slanting low through his window, casting long, peaceful shadows across the room. A glance at the clock told him it was late afternoon. He had slept for more than eight hours, a solid, unbroken block of rest that felt more restorative than a week's worth of dozing in a hospital chair. The house was silent. The frantic energy that had filled it during his training was gone, replaced by a deep and settled calm. For the first time in a month, he felt hunger not as a gnawing emptiness or a self-inflicted punishment, but as a simple, biological need. He padded to the kitchen, his body stiff but no longer buzzing with a manic energy. He opened the fridge, bypassed the water bottles and the leftover blocks of lard, and pulled out a carton of eggs. He cooked himself a simple meal\u2014scrambled eggs on toast, with a mug of strong, milky tea. He sat at the rickety patio table in the cooling evening air and ate slowly, tasting every mouthful. It was the best thing he had ever eaten.\n\nWhen he returned to the hospital that evening, the atmosphere had shifted again. The air of crisis was completely gone, replaced by the mundane, almost boring routine of recovery. He found his parents in the cafeteria, sharing a newspaper and a pot of tea, their faces relaxed and free from the constant strain of worry. Leo, they told him, was asleep, worn out from his first session with the physiotherapist. The trophy, Frank added with a wry smile, had become a minor celebrity on the ward. Nurses and other patients had been stopping by all afternoon to look at it, to touch it, to hear the condensed, unbelievable story from Mary. It was a bizarre but welcome distraction, a splash of gold in the sea of hospital beige. Baz just listened, a quiet smile on his face. The trophy had a life of its own now, and it had nothing to do with him.\n\nThe next day, he walked into Leo\u2019s room to find him sitting up in a large armchair by the window, painstakingly trying to complete a crossword puzzle from the newspaper with a shaky hand. The physiotherapist had been working with him on fine motor skills, and the simple act of writing was a monumental effort. \"What's a nine-letter word for an idiot brother who almost gives his entire family a collective coronary?\" Leo asked without looking up, his voice still raspy but laced with its familiar dry wit. Baz pulled up a chair. \"Scaffolder,\" he answered, settling in beside him. Leo snorted, a small puff of air. \"Doesn't fit.\" He put the pen down, the effort clearly exhausting him, and turned to look at his brother. His gaze was clear and direct. \"So,\" he said, his tone shifting, becoming serious. \"Did you really eat sixteen of those things?\" The question was no longer a joke. It was a genuine inquiry, an attempt to understand the incomprehensible journey his brother had taken while he was lost in the dark.\n\nAnd so Baz told him. He told him everything. Not the heroic version, not the legend that was forming around the trophy, but the real, ugly, painful truth. He spoke of the desperate, one-sided deal he had made in the dead of night, of the brutal runs along the river, of the force-feeding sessions in the lonely kitchen, of his father standing over him with a stopwatch. He told him about the revulsion, the pain, the guilt, and the single, unwavering, illogical belief that if he just pushed himself hard enough, if he suffered enough, it would somehow matter. He spoke for a long time, his voice low and steady, confessing the full extent of his madness. When he had finished, the room was quiet. Leo just stared at him, his expression a mixture of awe, horror, and a love so profound it needed no words. He reached out a trembling hand and placed it on Baz's arm. \"You absolute madman,\" he whispered, and this time, there was no smile, no exasperation. There was only a deep and shuddering respect. \"You really are the best.\""

                                        "text": "The weight of those simple, earnest words settled over Baz, a comfort heavier and more profound than any trophy. He didn't have a clever retort, no booming comeback. He just nodded, a lump forming in his throat, and squeezed his brother\u2019s arm. For a long moment, they sat in the quiet understanding that had been forged in the crucible of the past month. The wild, desperate energy that had propelled Baz across the country had finally found its destination, not in a winner's circle under television lights, but here, in the quiet humility of a hospital room, in his brother's clear and grateful eyes. The grand, ridiculous gesture had been received, its true meaning understood completely.\n\nWeeks turned into a month, and the rhythm of their lives shifted from the frantic beat of crisis to the slow, grinding cadence of recovery. The hospital ward became a new kind of worksite for Baz. His days were no longer measured in pies consumed or kilometres run, but in the small, painstaking victories of Leo\u2019s rehabilitation. He was there for the gruelling physiotherapy sessions, watching his brother\u2019s face contort with effort as he learned to walk again, his leg a lattice of scars and surgical steel. He sat for hours in waiting rooms while Leo worked with occupational therapists, re-training his hand to hold a pen, to button a shirt. This was a different kind of endurance, a marathon of patience and quiet support that demanded no applause and offered no trophies. It was slow, monotonous, and the most important work he had ever done.\n\nThe Golden Crust trophy came home with Baz, an absurd and glittering refugee from another life. His mother, in a flush of pride, insisted on placing it in the centre of the mantelpiece in their parents\u2019 temporary rental house, where it sat between a framed photo of her sons as gap-toothed children and a porcelain shepherdess. It was a constant source of debate. Frank would occasionally polish it with a grim satisfaction, while Leo, once he was well enough for weekend leave, declared it an eyesore of monumental proportions, suggesting it would be more useful as an elaborate doorstop or a particularly gaudy birdbath. It became part of the family lore, a tangible reminder of the madness, a story they would tell with shakes of the head and disbelieving smiles for the rest of their lives.\n\nWhen Baz finally returned to the scaffolding site, he was greeted like a conquering hero. \"Here he is! The Pie King!\" Mick the Mouth had boomed, the entire crew stopping work to give him a round of applause that echoed across the concrete shell of the building. They slapped his back, made jokes about his 'secret training regimen,' and asked if he was going to defend his title next year. Baz just smiled, shook his head, and deflected their questions. He was no longer the man who had left. He picked up his tools, the familiar weight a comfort in his hands, and got back to work, the easy camaraderie and the physical exertion a welcome anchor to a reality he had almost lost. High above the city, balancing on a steel beam with the wind whistling past, he felt more grounded than he had in months. The world of pastry and glory felt a million miles away, a strange dream he had once had.\n\nSeveral months later, the fierce heat of summer had finally broken, giving way to the gentle, balmy evenings of early autumn. In the small, scorched patch of grass he called a backyard, Baz O\u2019Connell sat on a white plastic chair that no longer groaned under his frame. He was leaner, the punishing regimen and the stress having stripped away his excess bulk, leaving behind a harder, quieter strength. The rusty fridge hummed its low, contented tune. He cracked open a cold beer, the satisfying hiss a familiar sound, and passed it to the man sitting in the chair beside him. Leo took the bottle, his grip steady, a thin white scar barely visible on his temple. He still walked with a slight limp, a permanent reminder of the Kwinana Freeway, but he was here. He was whole. They sat for a long moment in comfortable silence, watching the galahs settle in the neighbour\u2019s gum tree.\n\n\"So,\" Leo said finally, taking a sip of his beer. \"You gonna defend your title? The Masticator is apparently on a strict diet of kale and revenge.\" Baz looked at his brother, at the familiar glint of humour in his eyes, and let out a low laugh. \"Nah, mate,\" he said, shaking his head. \"I'm retired. One hundred percent undefeated. Going out on top.\" He took a long swallow of his beer, the taste no longer of victory or despair, but simply of a quiet Tuesday evening with his brother. He looked around the small yard, at the rickety table, at the struggling lemon tree, at the man sitting beside him. This was his monument. Not the ridiculous gold-plated pie gathering dust on a mantelpiece, but this. This simple, fragile, and unbreakable reality. This was the glorious, pointless ambition, and he, Baz O\u2019Connell, scaffolder and brother, was its chief architect. And it was more than enough."

Summer\u2019s brutal reign gave way to an autumn that draped Perth in a soft, golden light, and the city\u2019s simmering hum mellowed to a contented purr. For Baz, the change of season felt like a personal amnesty. His days found their old shape, marked by the 5 a.m. alarm, the scent of sawdust and diesel, and the satisfying ache in his shoulders after ten hours of hauling steel. High above the city, suspended between the bleached-bone sky and the sprawling geometry of the streets below, he found a profound and simple peace. The wind that whipped around the skeletal frames of new buildings stripped away the noise of the past, leaving only the clean, elemental reality of his work. The world of television cameras and ten-minute timers felt like a half-remembered fever dream, a story that had happened to someone else.\n\nHe saw Leo most evenings. His brother's recovery was a slow, stubborn march forward, each small gain a hard-won victory. The limp was less pronounced, the words came more easily, and the old, sharp wit was fully restored, now deployed to mercilessly critique the daytime television he was forced to watch. The Golden Crust trophy, retrieved from his parents\u2019 mantelpiece after Leo declared it was \"actively lowering the property value,\" now resided in Baz's spare room, shrouded in a dusty bedsheet like a retired deity whose powers were no longer required. His life had found its equilibrium. The scales, so violently upended, were balanced once more.\n\nThe disruption, when it came, started not with the ferocious buzz of an unknown number, but with a crackle over the worksite radio. Baz was twenty-two storeys up, guiding a crossbeam into place, when Mick the Mouth's voice echoed from the receiver on his belt. \"Baz, you there? Got a visitor for you down at the site office. Says it's important.\" A visitor for him, here? It was unheard of. The only people who visited were union reps or safety inspectors. A familiar jolt, a faint echo of the anxiety he thought he\u2019d buried, pricked at him. \"Who is it?\" he radioed back. There was a pause, and Mick's reply was tinged with confusion. \"Dunno, mate. Some sheila in a suit that probably costs more than my car. Says her name's Chloe. Looks like she got lost on her way to a bloody boardroom.\"\n\nHe descended in the rattling cage of the worksite lift, the city rising up to meet him as he went down. He stepped out onto the dusty, chaotic ground floor, his work boots kicking up clouds of fine cement powder. Standing beside the corrugated iron shed that served as the site office was a woman who was so out of place she seemed to have been digitally inserted into the scene. She was tall and slender, dressed in a sharp, cream-coloured pantsuit that was miraculously pristine amidst the surrounding grime. Her blonde hair was pulled back in a severe, elegant style, and she held a slim leather portfolio clutched in one hand. As Baz approached, his massive frame casting a long shadow over her, she turned, and a bright, professional smile clicked into place. It didn\u2019t reach her eyes, which were a cool, assessing blue. \"Mr. O'Connell? Baz? I\u2019m Chloe Vance. I'm a producer with Channel Nine. Thank you for coming down.\"\n\nHer voice was just like the one he remembered from Janice at the APA\u2014crisp, formal, and smelling of money. He stopped a few feet from her, wiping his dusty hands on his jeans, not offering one. \"I'm at work,\" he said, his tone flat and unwelcoming. Her smile didn't waver. \"Of course. I won't take up much of your time. I'm here because we at the network were incredibly moved by your story. By what you did at the Golden Crust Championship.\" The words, \u2018your story,\u2019 made his skin prickle. It wasn't a story; it was his life, and he didn\u2019t like the way she said it, as if it were a property she was interested in acquiring. \"It\u2019s over,\" he said. \"It was a stupid competition. I'm done with it.\"\n\n\"That's just it, Baz. May I call you Baz?\" she continued, not waiting for an answer. \"To everyone else, it might have been a competition. But what you did\u2026 winning it for your brother, Leo\u2026 that transcended sport. That was a narrative of love, of sacrifice, of pure Australian grit. It's the kind of inspirational journey our viewers connect with on a fundamental level.\" She opened her portfolio, the slick movement a stark contrast to the gritty surroundings. \"I'm the executive producer for 'Heartland Heroes,' our flagship weekly human-interest program. We want to feature you. A full, primetime segment. We'd fly you and Leo to Sydney, put you up, tell your story properly, with dignity and respect. We want to celebrate you.\"\n\nBaz felt a familiar, hot surge of anger mixed with exhaustion. They wanted to package his family\u2019s private hell, his brother's near-death, his own desperate madness, into a twenty-minute television segment between a story about a surfing dog and a profile of a charity fun-run. They wanted to put it on display, to sell it. \"No, thanks,\" he said, the words coming out as a low growl. \"We're not interested. My brother is still recovering. We just want to be left alone.\" He started to turn away, to go back to the world of steel and concrete that made sense.\n\n\"We were planning to make a fifty-thousand-dollar donation to the Royal Perth Hospital's rehabilitation wing in your name,\" she said, her voice calm and perfectly timed. Baz froze, his back to her. The noise of the worksite\u2014the whine of a circular saw, the clang of steel on steel, Mick shouting at a truck driver\u2014seemed to fade into a dull, distant hum. Fifty thousand dollars. The words hung in the dusty air. He thought of the drab, underfunded physiotherapy room, the worn-out equipment, the overworked nurses and therapists who had patiently, painstakingly pieced his brother back together. He thought of the other patients on the ward, the stroke victims and the accident survivors, all fighting their own quiet, desperate battles. \"Think of all the other Leos you could help, Baz,\" Chloe said softly, sensing she had found the chink in his armour. \"Think of the good you could do. All it would take is one weekend. One conversation.\" He slowly turned back to face her, his face a mask of conflicting emotions. The easy peace he had found high above the city had been shattered. The world, with its complicated demands and its terrible bargains, had found him again."

                                        "text": "The world seemed to tilt on its axis, the familiar noise of the worksite fading into a dull, distant roar. Fifty thousand dollars. It wasn't a number; it was a tangible thing. It was the new set of parallel bars the physio, an overworked woman named Brenda, had said they desperately needed. It was the upgraded pulley system for limb strengthening. It was salaries, resources, and relief for the very people who had dragged Leo back from the silent abyss. Chloe Vance hadn\u2019t just offered a donation; she had presented him with the full weight of his gratitude and his conscience. He looked from her pristine, expensive shoes standing on the dusty, oil-stained ground to the half-finished building behind her, a monument to commerce, and felt the simple certainties of his life begin to crumble.\n\n\"My brother makes his own decisions,\" Baz finally managed, his voice a low, rough growl. \"This isn't just about me.\" Chloe\u2019s professional smile remained fixed, but a flicker of victory registered in her cool blue eyes. She knew she had him. She slid a sleek, cream-coloured business card from her portfolio, holding it out between two fingers. The card was thick and heavy, a different species from the flimsy paper rectangles passed around on the worksite. \"Of course,\" she said smoothly. \"Talk to him. But the offer is time-sensitive. Network budgets, scheduling\u2026 I'm sure you understand. I'm at The Richardson for the next two days. My number is on the card.\" Baz took the card, the feel of it alien against his calloused, grimy fingertips. He didn't say another word, just turned his back on her and walked towards the rattling cage of the lift, the small, heavy rectangle in his hand feeling more like a grenade than a piece of paper.\n\nThe rest of the afternoon passed in a haze. The familiar, dangerous work of balancing on high steel, of guiding tons of metal into place, usually demanded his full, unwavering attention, but today his mind was elsewhere. He was back in the rehabilitation ward, a place of quiet, stubborn effort and the pervasive smell of disinfectant. He saw the faded posters on the wall, the worn linoleum floor, the shared equipment that was constantly in use. He saw the faces of the other patients\u2014the elderly man recovering from a stroke, patiently trying to stack plastic cups; the young woman in the wheelchair, her face a mask of frustration as she fought to regain movement in her legs. They were all there, fighting their quiet wars. He had won his absurd battle and received his golden prize. Theirs was a longer, harder, and far more significant fight, waged in obscurity and with limited resources.\n\nThat evening, in the familiar sanctuary of the backyard, the ritual felt different. The air was still and cool, the beer was cold, but a new tension hung between the two brothers. Baz watched Leo take a long swallow from his bottle, his movements still careful but now imbued with a casual confidence that had been absent for months. He had put on some weight, and the haunted, hollowed-out look was gone from his eyes, replaced by his old, familiar light. He was healing. He was becoming himself again. Baz took a deep breath, steeling himself. \"There was a visitor at work today,\" he began, his voice hesitant. \"A woman from a TV station in Sydney. Channel Nine.\" Leo raised an eyebrow, his interest piqued. \"Don't tell me they want to do a show about scaffolding safety. It'd be a ratings blockbuster.\"\n\nBaz ignored the jibe, his tone flat as he relayed the conversation. He laid it all out: the 'Heartland Heroes' show, the talk of their 'inspirational journey,' the 'narrative of Australian grit.' He delivered the details with a palpable distaste, describing the producer and her proposal as if he were handling something foul. He expected Leo to join in on the mockery, to tear the entire concept to shreds with his signature sarcasm. And at first, he did. A slow, incredulous grin spread across Leo\u2019s face. \"Heartland Heroes?\" he scoffed, shaking his head. \"Good God. Are you serious? They want to put us on national television, probably with some sad piano music playing in the background, and have us talk about our feelings? They want to turn this whole bloody nightmare into a Hallmark card?\" He took another swig of his beer, his disgust evident. \"Tell me you told her to get stuffed. Politely, of course.\"\n\nThis was the moment. Baz stared into the amber depths of his beer bottle, unable to meet his brother's eye. \"I was going to,\" he said, his voice quiet. \"And then she mentioned the other part of the deal. They want to make a donation to the Royal Perth rehab ward. In our name.\" He paused, letting the silence stretch. \"Fifty thousand dollars, Leo.\" The laughter died on Leo's lips. The backyard, with its chirping crickets and the distant rumble of traffic, fell completely silent. The number, so stark and significant, changed the very nature of the conversation, stripping away the sarcasm and leaving behind a complex, uncomfortable reality. Leo was no longer smiling. His gaze became distant, his eyes unfocused, and Baz knew, with a painful certainty, exactly where his brother's mind had gone. He was back on the ward, not as a patient in a bed, but as an observer, seeing the place with his newly recovered clarity.\n\nHe was seeing Brenda, the physio, taping up the frayed handle on a rowing machine because there was no budget for a new one. He was seeing the waiting list for the single anti-gravity treadmill, a crucial piece of equipment that could only be used by one person at a time. He was seeing the faces of the other patients, the ones whose recovery would be measured not in weeks, but in years, the ones whose families didn't have a national pie-eating champion to throw a spotlight on their plight. The casual cynicism fell away from him, replaced by the weight of firsthand knowledge. He had been a recipient of that strained, under-resourced, and profoundly dedicated system of care. He knew, better than Baz ever could, exactly what that money would mean.\n\nFinally, after a long, contemplative silence, Leo let out a slow breath and looked at his brother. His expression was no longer one of mockery, but of grim, pragmatic calculation. \"So let me get this straight,\" he said, his voice devoid of its earlier sarcasm. \"We have to spend a weekend in Sydney, let some producer with expensive hair ask us a bunch of intrusive questions, and pretend to be 'inspirational' for a camera crew.\" He paused, taking a final swallow of his beer and setting the empty bottle down with a decisive click. \"And in exchange for that minor humiliation, Brenda gets her new parallel bars, and the ward gets a fifty-thousand-dollar upgrade. Is that the deal?\" Baz nodded slowly, watching his brother\u2019s face. \"That's the deal,\" he confirmed. Leo leaned back in his chair, a wry, weary smile touching his lips. \"Well,\" he said, looking his big brother straight in the eye. \"When you put it like that, it sounds like we'd be idiots not to take it. Book the flights, hero. It looks like we're going into show business.\""

                                        "text": "## Chapter 10\n\nThe phone call was a transaction, pure and simple. Baz made it the next morning from the cab of his ute before the worksite had fully woken up, the business card feeling slick and foreign in his hand. Chloe Vance answered on the first ring, her voice as crisp and alert as if she had been waiting for him. Baz didn\u2019t waste time on pleasantries. \u201cIt\u2019s Baz O\u2019Connell. We\u2019ll do it. The TV show.\u201d He could almost hear the smile spreading across her face. \u201cThat\u2019s wonderful news, Baz. We\u2019re so thrilled\u2014\u201d He cut her off, his tone flat and hard. \u201cOn one condition. We get it in writing. Fifty thousand dollars to the Royal Perth rehab ward. The money is transferred before we say a word on camera.\u201d There was a fractional pause, a moment of calculation on her end. \u201cOf course,\u201d she said, her voice recovering its smooth, professional warmth. \u201cConsider it done. I\u2019ll have my assistant email the confirmation to you and the hospital\u2019s foundation this morning. We\u2019ll arrange flights for you and Leo for early next week.\u201d Baz grunted an acknowledgment and hung up, dropping the phone onto the passenger seat. The deal was done. The humiliation had been priced and purchased.\n\nThe flight to Sydney felt vastly different from the desperate, solitary journey to Melbourne. This time, he was not an athlete preparing for war, but half of a diplomatic mission on hostile territory. He sat beside Leo, a silent, imposing guardian, while his brother surveyed the cabin with the air of a visiting anthropologist studying a strange tribe. Leo was stronger now, the ordeal having left a permanent limp and a network of faint scars, but it had also forged a new, quieter kind of confidence in him. He no longer vibrated with a restless energy; he possessed a still, watchful intelligence, the kind born of having stared into the void and walked away. While Baz stared grimly out the window, seeing only the long road ahead, Leo was reading the in-flight magazine, offering a dry running commentary on the absurdity of luxury watch advertisements and articles about \"mindful travel.\" He was the strategist, the interpreter, the one who would navigate the treacherous social landscape that awaited them.\n\nSydney greeted them not with the dry, familiar heat of home, but with a humid, bustling indifference. A sullen young man in a dark suit held a sign with their name on it and led them to a black town car without a word. They sped through a labyrinth of unfamiliar streets, the city a blur of sandstone, glass, and ceaseless motion. The hotel was a monument to corporate wealth, its lobby a cavernous space of polished marble and intimidatingly minimalist furniture. Their room, a \"Harbour View Suite\" on the thirty-second floor, was so opulent it felt like a parody. A wall of glass offered a postcard-perfect panorama of the Opera House and the Harbour Bridge, a view so iconic it seemed unreal, like a screensaver. Leo walked slowly around the suite, running a hand over the ridiculously high-thread-count sheets on one of the king-sized beds. \u201cI think the bathroom is bigger than your entire house, Baz,\u201d he said, his voice echoing in the vast, silent room. \"This is what they pay for a story. Funny, isn't it? When we were living it, it wasn't worth a damn thing.\"\n\nAn hour later, they were summoned to a conference room on a lower floor. Chloe Vance was in her element here, a queen in her court. She sat at the head of a long, polished table, flanked by a young, eager assistant clutching an iPad and a weary-looking cameraman who seemed to have seen it all before. \u201cBaz, Leo, thank you for coming,\u201d she began, her smile radiating a practiced warmth that didn't reach her eyes. \u201cWe\u2019re just so excited to have you. I wanted to have a quick \u2018pre-interview\u2019 chat today, just to walk through the narrative beats and get a feel for the emotional core of your journey.\u201d The corporate jargon washed over Baz, meaningless and irritating. He just sat, a stony island of denim and plaid in a sea of tailored suits, his arms crossed over his chest. Leo, however, leaned forward slightly, a look of polite, academic interest on his face. \u201cNarrative beats,\u201d he repeated softly, as if savouring a new and exotic phrase.\n\nChloe, taking this as encouragement, launched into her vision. She spoke of the \u201ctragic inciting incident,\u201d the \u201cbrother\u2019s selfless vow,\u201d and the \u201cgruelling test of human endurance.\u201d Her language painted a picture of a heroic myth, a simple, powerful story of good versus evil, of love conquering all. She turned to Leo, her expression shifting to one of carefully calibrated sympathy. \u201cLeo, can you take us back to that moment in the hospital? The moment you first woke up and saw your brother, the champion? What was that feeling like, seeing what he had done for you?\u201d Leo paused, a thoughtful expression on his face. \u201cMostly,\u201d he said, his voice dry and factual, \u201cI was wondering who the hell had stolen my underwear and why my throat felt like I\u2019d swallowed a handful of gravel. The Golden Crust trophy was a distant third on my list of concerns. It really is a remarkably gaudy piece of metal up close.\u201d The assistant\u2019s pen froze mid-scribble. The cameraman coughed to cover a laugh. Chloe\u2019s smile tightened by a fraction of a millimetre.\n\nShe quickly pivoted to Baz. \"And Baz, your training\u2026 we see it as a kind of monastic dedication. The pain, the sacrifice\u2026 it was a physical manifestation of your love for your brother. Can you talk about the mindset you had to adopt to push through that barrier?\" All eyes turned to Baz. He stared back at Chloe, his expression unreadable. He thought of the nausea, the self-loathing, the desperate, irrational belief that his own suffering could somehow balance the scales of the universe. \u201cIt was a job,\u201d he said, his voice a low rumble. \u201cHad to be done.\u201d Leo leaned forward again, adopting the role of helpful translator. \u201cWhat my brother means,\u201d he said, his tone smooth and reasonable, \u201cis that it was a deeply unpleasant process undertaken for a specific, desired outcome. Much like, for example, chemotherapy. Effective, but you wouldn\u2019t recommend it as a hobby.\u201d\n\nThe meeting concluded shortly after. Chloe, though visibly flustered by their refusal to follow her emotional script, maintained her professional composure, handing them a printed schedule for the next day\u2019s filming. As the door to the conference room closed behind them, leaving them alone in the hushed, carpeted hallway, Baz looked at his brother. \u201cChemotherapy?\u201d he grunted. Leo shrugged, a wry smile playing on his lips. \u201cSeemed appropriate. She wants a soap opera, we give her a clinical trial report. Factual, precise, and deeply un-telegenic. It\u2019s a transaction, Baz. We give them the story, but we give it to them on our terms. They get their quotes, Brenda gets her parallel bars, and we get to go home.\u201d They stepped into the lift, the doors hissing shut, sealing them in their own private bubble. They were a team, a two-man army of cynical, pragmatic resistance, and the battle had just begun."

                                        "text": "The filming took place the next day in a studio that felt less like a television set and more like an interrogation room designed by a psychologist. The centrepiece was a fake living room, complete with two plush, cream-coloured armchairs for the brothers and a slightly more upright one for Chloe. A fake bookshelf lined the back wall, filled with colour-coordinated, unread hardbacks, and a generic abstract painting hung at a pleasing angle. The whole set was bathed in a light that was intensely bright yet soft, a clinical, shadowless glare designed to expose every flicker of emotion. Three cameras on silent dollies moved like predatory insects, their red lights glowing with an unnerving focus. Baz, who was used to the raw, chaotic honesty of a construction site, felt a profound sense of unease. The artifice was suffocating; it was a room built to manufacture a truth that didn't exist.\n\nChloe took her seat opposite them, her on-camera persona clicking into place like a new lens on a camera. Her smile was warmer, her voice softer, her posture leaning forward in an attitude of deep, empathetic listening. She started with Leo, as they had predicted. \"Leo,\" she began, her voice a gentle murmur, \"thank you for being here. I want to take you back, if you're comfortable, to that moment in the hospital. That moment when you emerged from the darkness. Can you describe what it felt like to open your eyes and realise the extraordinary thing your brother had done for you? To see that golden trophy and understand the depth of his sacrifice?\"\n\nLeo met her earnest gaze with a calm, neutral expression. He took a moment, as if carefully considering the question, before answering. \"The first thing I remember feeling was an overwhelming sense of confusion, which I'm told is common,\" he began, his tone as factual and dispassionate as a doctor's report. \"My primary sensory inputs were the harshness of the fluorescent lights, the incessant beeping of a machine to my left, and the profound discomfort of the catheter I was still attached to. My brother's victory in the pie-eating competition wasn't really on my radar at that point. I was mostly preoccupied with the fact that my entire body felt like a single, comprehensive bruise and I had a desperate, primal urge for a glass of water.\" He paused, looking at her with polite inquiry. \"The trophy came later. As I mentioned, it's quite gaudy.\"\n\nA flicker of annoyance crossed Chloe\u2019s face before being professionally suppressed. She turned to Baz, hoping to find more fertile ground. \"Baz, that power, that drive. We see it as a physical manifestation of your love. When you were there, in your kitchen, forcing down pie after pie, pushing your body to the absolute limit\u2026 what was the one image, the one thought, that kept you going through the pain?\" Her question was a baited hook, dangling the promise of a tearful, emotional confession. Baz stared at the camera lens nearest him, its red light a malevolent eye. He thought not of a single image, but of the whole grinding, nauseating process. He thought of the revulsion, the bloating, the sheer, bloody-minded will required. He translated it all into his own language, stripping it bare of all poetry. \"Just had to get the numbers up,\" he said, his voice a low, flat rumble. \"It was a training exercise. You set a target, you hit the target. That's all.\"\n\n\"But *why*?\" Chloe pressed, her voice taking on a sharper edge of frustration. \"Why that target? Why that specific, gruelling method?\" Baz shifted his massive frame in the too-small armchair. He was a bull in a doll's house, and he was beginning to feel cornered. \"Seemed like the right kind of price to pay,\" he grunted, the words an admission he hadn't intended to make, a brief, unguarded glimpse into the desperate, magical thinking that had possessed him. Chloe seized on it, her eyes lighting up. \"A price! So you did see it as a kind of bargain, a sacrifice you were making to some higher power, to the universe itself, for your brother's life?\" Her voice was triumphant, she had her soundbite.\n\nBefore Baz could retreat back into his stony silence, Leo leaned forward, intervening with the calm, precise timing of a chess master. \"Chloe, I think you're mistaking a psychological coping mechanism for a theological treatise,\" he said, his voice still gentle but now carrying a sharp, analytical edge. \"My brother, faced with a situation of complete powerlessness, created a task over which he had absolute control. He manufactured a private, brutal ordeal in order to feel like he was doing *something* in a situation where nothing could be done. It's a common response to trauma. I believe it's referred to as a 'focal substitution'.\" He looked at Baz, then back at Chloe. \"It was less about bargaining with the universe and more about my brother finding a way to not go completely insane. A fact for which I'm eternally grateful, but it's probably not the heroic narrative you're looking for.\"\n\nChloe\u2019s face was a mask of barely controlled fury. Her \"narrative beats\" were being systematically dismantled, her emotional core exposed as a clinical case study. She was losing, and she knew it. She decided to go for broke, her voice taking on a saccharine, slightly pitying tone. \"It's just so fascinating. This deep, almost primal bond. It's a story we don't often get to tell. A story of two ordinary Aussie blokes, doing something so extraordinary, all for the love of family. And the fact that you're here today, sharing it with us, allowing us to celebrate you, it\u2019s just incredibly generous.\" She smiled, a final attempt to frame them within her saccharine world. It was a mistake. It gave Leo the opening he had been waiting for all along.\n\n\"Generous?\" Leo said, a small, wry smile finally touching his lips. \"Chloe, let's not pretend we don't all know why we're really here.\" He looked directly into the main camera, bypassing her completely, as if speaking to a much larger, unseen audience. \"We're not here because we're generous. We're here because your network offered to pay fifty thousand dollars to the physiotherapy department at Royal Perth Hospital. We're here because the public health system is so chronically under-resourced that a single piece of vital equipment, like a new set of parallel bars for people learning to walk again, is considered a luxury item. The real 'Heartland Hero' is our physio, Brenda, who works sixty-hour weeks with worn-out equipment to help people like me stand up again. The story isn't about my brother eating pies. The story is about the fact that a man nearly has to kill himself on national television just so a hospital can get a donation that should be part of its standard annual budget.\"\n\nA profound and utter silence descended on the studio. The cameraman nearest them slowly lowered his camera, his face a mixture of shock and deep respect. The young assistant stared at Leo, her mouth slightly agape. Chloe Vance looked as though she had been slapped. The professional mask was gone, replaced by a blank, bloodless expression of total defeat. She had been outmanoeuvred, her sentimental narrative hijacked and replaced with a searing, undeniable indictment of the very system that made feel-good stories like hers necessary. The transaction had been laid bare for all to see. After a long, agonising moment, she turned to the floor manager, her voice a clipped, dead thing. \"I think we have everything we need,\" she said. \"We're done here.\"\n\nThey walked out of the studio and into the bright, indifferent Sydney afternoon without a backward glance. No one tried to stop them, no one offered a handshake or a hollow thank you. They had fulfilled their contract, but not in the way anyone had expected. They had delivered their story, but it was a story of systemic failure, not personal triumph. As they waited for a taxi on the busy street corner, surrounded by the rush and roar of a city that didn't know or care about their private war, Baz looked at his brother. A slow, genuine grin spread across his face, the first he had felt all day. \"Focal substitution?\" he asked, the words a low rumble of amusement. Leo shrugged, a faint smile playing on his own lips as he adjusted the collar of his shirt. \"I read a lot of pamphlets in the waiting room,\" he said. \"You pick things up.\" The taxi pulled up to the curb, and they climbed in, leaving the studio and its false narratives behind them. The job was done. The parallel bars were paid for. It was time to go home."
