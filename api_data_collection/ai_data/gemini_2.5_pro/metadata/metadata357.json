     "novel_text": "The blade sliced the water with a sound like tearing silk, a clean rip in the morning's silence. Liam pulled, his whole body a coiled spring releasing its tension in one fluid, powerful motion. The scull, a fragile needle of carbon fibre, surged forward across the Chesterfield Canal. Dawn was a rumour of pale grey and pink staining the eastern sky, and the air held the raw, damp chill of a Derbyshire spring. Mist clung to the water's surface in lazy drifts, shrouding the banks and turning the distant, iconic twist of the crooked spire into a ghostly smudge on the horizon. Out here, there was only the rhythm. The catch, the drive, the finish, the recovery. The rhythmic gasp of his own breath. The squeak of the oarlocks. For ten years, this had been his sanctuary, his church, his proving ground. The water didn't care about your day job or your family troubles; it only cared about power, technique, and endurance.\n\nBut this morning, another rhythm fought for purchase in his mind. A melody. A simple, soulful hook from an old Sam Cooke tune that had snagged in his brain and refused to let go. He found himself humming it on the recovery, a low baritone rumble in his chest that was lost to the wind. The song was a secret, a small, warm thing he carried inside him. Rowing was for his body, for the sinew and muscle he had spent a decade building. Singing was for whatever was left over. It was the part of him that didn't fit the mould of a six-foot-three, fourteen-stone athlete who could pull a two-kilometre erg test in a time that made other men weep. It was a secret garden he tended to in the shower, in his car, and on the rare Tuesday nights he had the courage to go to the open mic at The Rutland Arms.\n\nHe let the boat glide, the hiss of the hull on the water slowing as he sat up, wiping a bead of sweat from his brow with the back of his wrist. He pulled his phone from its waterproof pouch. The screen was cold against his thumb. He opened the email again, for what must have been the twentieth time since it had arrived last night. The subject line still gave him a jolt, a fizz of something that felt dangerously like hope.\n\n*Subject: Voice of the Peaks - Grand Final Confirmation*\n\n*Dear Liam Kenna,*\n*Following your incredible performance in the semi-final, we are absolutely delighted to invite you to compete in the Grand Final of Voice of the Peaks 2024...*\n\nIt was real. The words hadn't rearranged themselves overnight into a rejection. He, Liam Kenna, the quiet lad from Whittington Moor who spent most of his life going backwards down a canal, was in the final of a proper singing competition. Not just a pub karaoke night with a prize of a gallon of ale, but a real, televised-on-a-local-channel, sponsored-by-a-regional-car-dealership competition. The thought was so absurd, so far removed from the cold reality of his aching quads and blistered hands, that he almost laughed out loud. He\u2019d entered on a whim, egged on by his sister, Claire, after she\u2019d filmed him on her phone singing at a family barbecue. He\u2019d sent in the grainy video of him murdering\u2014or so he thought\u2014Otis Redding\u2019s \u2018(Sittin' On) The Dock of the Bay\u2019, and somehow, against all odds, they\u2019d invited him to an audition.\n\nThe early rounds had been a blur of nervous energy. He\u2019d stood backstage in his borrowed suit, feeling like a bear in a doll's house amongst the slender, confident drama school kids and the seasoned pub singers with their worn-out guitars. Then he\u2019d walked on stage, the lights hot on his face, and opened his mouth. And the voice that came out always surprised him. It was deeper, richer, than his speaking voice, a resonant sound that seemed to come from the soles of his feet. It felt like the only time he was ever truly expressing the entirety of himself. The judges, a panel of local radio DJs and a former West End performer who\u2019d retired to the Peak District, had been visibly taken aback. \u2018Where did *that* voice come from, young man?\u2019 one of them had asked, peering at him over her glasses as if he were some sort of geological anomaly.\n\n\"He's here. The phantom of the canal.\"\n\nLiam jolted, nearly dropping his phone in the water. Dave, his coach, was standing on the towpath, arms crossed over his chest, his stocky frame silhouetted against the brightening sky. His face, weathered and perpetually unimpressed, was fixed on Liam.\n\n\"Daydreaming, Kenna? Or admiring your reflection?\" Dave's voice was gravelly, a product of too many years of shouting encouragement through a megaphone into the wind.\n\n\"Just checking the time, coach,\" Liam lied, quickly stowing the phone. He grabbed the oars, his knuckles white.\n\n\"The time is 'time to put some bloody work in',\" Dave grunted. \"Your splits for that last five hundred were lazy. Your head's not in the boat. The Northern Regatta is in three weeks. Manchester will eat you alive if you're pulling like that. I want three sets of five-hundred-metre sprints. And I want to see the water churn.\"\n\nLiam nodded, his jaw tight. \"Yes, coach.\"\n\nHe didn't argue. You didn't argue with Dave. The man had coached rowers to national championships. He lived and breathed the sport, and he expected the same monastic devotion from his top athletes. He would not, Liam knew, understand a singing competition. To Dave, anything that wasn't geared towards making the boat go faster was a frivolous, pointless distraction. A weakness.\n\nAs he turned the scull and paddled back to his starting point, the conflict churned inside him, a messy counter-rhythm to the smooth mechanics of the stroke. Rowing was his life, the bedrock of his identity. It had given him discipline, strength, a community. He owed everything to it, and to Dave. But the singing\u2026 the singing was a new, thrilling discovery. It was a door opening into a room in his own house that he never knew existed. The Grand Final was in Sheffield, at the City Hall, in two weeks\u2019 time. Two weeks. He had to choose a song, practice, figure out what to wear. He had to drive there. His car, a battered fifteen-year-old Ford Fiesta he\u2019d nicknamed \u2018The Biscuit Tin\u2019 for its tendency to rattle, would have to be coaxed into making the journey over the moors.\n\nHe took a deep breath, the cold air burning his lungs. For now, he would row. He would make the water churn for Dave. He would give the canal the power it demanded. But as he coiled his body for the first sprint, it wasn't the thought of the finish line at the regatta that spurred him on. It was the memory of the stage lights, the hush of the crowd, and the first, terrifying, wonderful note of a song taking flight.\n\nThe boathouse smelled of damp lycra, river water, and industrial floor cleaner. It was a familiar, comforting smell to Liam, the scent of hard work and belonging. He racked his boat with the practiced ease of long habit, his muscles humming with the pleasant ache of exertion. Other members of the club were arriving now, a trickle of bodies in brightly coloured technical gear, their voices echoing in the cavernous space.\n\n\"Morning, Liam. Good session?\" It was Mark, another single sculler, a wiry accountant who rowed with a ferocious intensity that belied his day job.\n\n\"Morning. Yeah, not bad,\" Liam replied, towelling his hair dry. \"Dave was on the warpath, as usual.\"\n\nMark chuckled. \"Tells you he cares. When he stops shouting, that\u2019s when you need to worry.\" He paused, lowering his voice slightly. \"Heard a rumour on the club WhatsApp. Something about you being on the telly?\"\n\nLiam felt a hot blush creep up his neck. He\u2019d hoped to keep it quiet for a bit longer, to let the idea settle in his own mind before it became club gossip. But news, like water, always found a way to leak out. \"Ah. Yeah. Sort of. Local telly, maybe.\"\n\nMark's eyes widened. \"Don't be modest, mate! The Voice of the Peaks! My missus loves that show. She said there was a big lad from Chesterfield who sang like an angel. Didn't realise it was you! That's brilliant! What are you gonna sing in the final?\"\n\nThe question hung in the air. Liam hadn't even let himself think that far ahead. The pressure of it suddenly felt immense. \"Not sure yet. Got to pick something.\"\n\n\"Well, whatever it is, you'll smash it,\" Mark said, clapping him on the shoulder with a wet hand. \"Just don't forget us little people when you're famous.\"\n\nThe encounter left Liam feeling strangely exposed. The two halves of his life, the rower and the singer, were beginning to collide, and he wasn't sure how to manage the impact. He finished changing in a haze, nodding and murmuring vague pleasantries to his clubmates, all the while feeling their curious glances. He was no longer just Liam Kenna, the club's strongest sculler. He was a novelty. The Singing Rower.\n\nHe escaped the boathouse and got into The Biscuit Tin. The engine turned over with a phlegmy cough and a shudder that vibrated through the driver\u2019s seat. The dashboard lit up like a Christmas tree with warning lights that he\u2019d long since learned to ignore. As long as the oil light and the engine temperature light stayed off, he considered it a victory. He pulled out of the car park, the radio crackling to life. A generic pop song filled the small car. He turned it off. He needed to think.\n\nDriving through the familiar streets of Chesterfield, past the market stalls being set up and the morning commuters heading to the train station, he felt a disconnect. This was his world. Solid, predictable, real. The singing competition felt like a dream he was having, and he was terrified of waking up. What if he made a fool of himself? What if he got on that big stage and his voice cracked? What if the judges who had been so kind before were suddenly critical? The fear was a cold knot in his stomach, a stark contrast to the elation he'd felt just a few hours earlier. Rowing had taught him to manage physical pain and exhaustion, but this... this was different. This was a fear of failure that was purely about his soul.\n\nHe pulled up outside his small terraced house. His sister\u2019s car was parked outside. Claire must have dropped off her son, Leo, for him to look after while she was at work. Liam smiled. Leo, his seven-year-old nephew, would be a welcome distraction. The boy lived entirely in the moment, his world a whirlwind of Lego, football, and endless questions.\n\nHe opened the front door to the immediate assault of a small, human hurricane.\n\n\"Uncle Liam! You promised we could go to the park! And you said you'd show me your medals again! Did you win today? Did you beat everyone? Mum said you're going to be a pop star!\"\n\nLeo was already dressed in a full, slightly-too-large football kit, and was bouncing on the balls of his feet with an energy Liam envied. Claire was in the kitchen, making toast. She was two years older than Liam, a primary school teacher with a practical, no-nonsense attitude, but with the same kind eyes as their late mother.\n\n\"Morning, superstar,\" she said, grinning at him. \"Surviving the hype?\"\n\nLiam grunted, ruffling Leo\u2019s hair. \"Barely. Mark at the club already knows. I feel like a prize pig at a country fair.\"\n\n\"Get used to it,\" Claire said, handing him a mug of tea. \"I put it on the school's parent Facebook group. The whole of Brampton is rooting for you.\"\n\n\"You what?\" Liam choked on his tea. \"Claire! Why would you do that?\"\n\n\"Because I'm proud of you, you big idiot!\" she retorted, her expression softening. \"For years, all you've done is that bloody rowing. Up at five every morning, protein shakes, blisters, aches and pains. You never do anything just for fun. This is for fun. And you're brilliant at it. You need to let yourself enjoy it.\"\n\n\"It's not just for fun anymore, is it?\" Liam said, his voice quiet. \"It's the final. There's a prize. People are... watching.\"\n\nClaire came and put an arm around his broad shoulders. \"Listen to me. You've been singing since you were Leo's age. Mum used to say you sang before you could talk properly. You used to stand on that hearth, remember? Using the TV remote as a microphone, singing along to her Dusty Springfield records. Her heart would have burst seeing you on that stage.\"\n\nThe mention of their mum struck a chord deep inside him. She had been the music in their house. After she\u2019d passed away from cancer five years ago, the house had fallen silent in more ways than one. His dad, a man of few words at the best of times, had retreated further into himself. For Liam, singing the old songs they\u2019d shared had become a way of keeping her close, a private conversation with her memory. Maybe that\u2019s what this was all about.\n\n\"Just\u2026 don't let Dave from the rowing club find out,\" Liam mumbled into his mug.\n\nClaire laughed, a bright, clear sound. \"Oh, he'll be fine. Might do him good to realise there's more to life than messing about in boats. Now,\" she said, turning her attention to her son, \"Leo, be good for your uncle. No breaking anything expensive. And Liam,\" she fixed him with a mock-serious glare, \"you need to pick a song for the final. A proper showstopper. No sad ballads. Something that'll get them on their feet.\"\n\nAs she left for work, leaving a trail of perfume and cheerful chaos in her wake, Liam was left alone with his nephew and his thoughts. A showstopper. The words echoed in his head. He looked around the small living room, at the mantelpiece crowded with rowing trophies and a single, faded photograph of his smiling mother. He had two weeks to become a showman. Two weeks to bridge the chasm between the silent, powerful man in the boat and the soulful singer he was only just beginning to know. The prospect was, in a word, terrifying. And in another, completely and utterly exhilarating.The silence that followed Claire's departure was immediately filled by Leo, who began using the living room rug as a makeshift football pitch, commentating on his own imaginary game in a breathless whisper. \"And Kenna shoots... he scores! The crowd goes wild!\" Liam watched him, a faint smile on his lips. He sank into the worn armchair, the springs groaning in protest under his weight. His body felt heavy, anchored by fatigue, but his mind was a frantic buzz of conflicting demands. The regatta. The final. Dave's gravelly voice. Claire's cheerful encouragement. His mother\u2019s smile. It was too much.\n\n\"Can we see the medals now?\" Leo abandoned his game, skidding to a halt by the arm of the chair and looking up at him with wide, pleading eyes. \"Please? The shiny ones.\"\n\n\"Alright, alright, you little monster,\" Liam sighed, heaving himself up. It was a familiar ritual. He opened the glass-fronted cabinet where his prizes were kept. Dozens of them, mostly gold and silver, hung from ribbons or stood on small wooden plinths. He took down the heaviest, a gold medal from the National Championships two years prior. \"This one's from when we won the coxless fours,\" he explained, placing the cool, heavy metal in Leo\u2019s small hands. The boy\u2019s eyes were round with awe. \"It was the hardest race I've ever done. It was raining so hard you could barely see the finish line, and my hands were so raw I could feel the oar through the blisters.\" He spoke of the race with a detached reverence, as if describing a natural disaster he had survived. This, he understood. The pain, the burn, the reward. It was a simple, brutal equation.\n\nLeo traced the embossed crest on the medal. \"Is being a pop star harder than this?\" he asked, his voice full of genuine curiosity. Liam was taken aback. He looked from the medal in Leo\u2019s hand\u2014a tangible record of a decade of gruelling, single-minded effort\u2014to the memory of the stage, a fleeting, terrifying, thirty-minute blur.\n\n\"I don't know, mate,\" he said honestly. \"It's\u2026 different.\" He put the medal away, the click of the cabinet door sounding unnervingly final. \"In a race, you know what you've got to do. You pull as hard as you can. If you're strong enough and your technique's good enough, you win. On stage\u2026 you can do everything right and people still might not like it. It\u2019s not about how strong you are.\"\n\n\"But they do like it! Mum said you made Mrs. Higgins from next door cry, but in a good way,\" Leo insisted. \"What song are you going to sing? Is it the one about the boat?\" He meant '(Sittin' On) The Dock of the Bay'. Liam shook his head. \"No, Claire's right. It needs to be something\u2026 bigger. A showstopper.\" The word felt foreign and ridiculous in his mouth. He wasn't a showman; he was a sculler. He moved backwards to go forwards. He faced away from where he was going. His entire sporting life was an exercise in quiet, introverted propulsion.\n\nHe sat back down and scrolled through his phone's music library, a curated collection of soul, blues, and old-school R&B that was a world away from the aggressive punk and rock that fuelled his teammates' workouts. He needed something that had power but also vulnerability. Something that could build, that could tell a story. He skimmed past Al Green, past Bill Withers. Then his thumb hovered over an album cover. Otis Redding again. But not the gentle melancholy of 'Dock of the Bay'. He tapped on 'Try a Little Tenderness'.\n\nThe song started soft and gentle, a simple declaration. Liam closed his eyes, listening. He knew every inflection, every breath. Then came the build. The horns kicking in, the tempo increasing, Redding\u2019s voice cracking with raw, pleading emotion, building and building until it became a volcanic eruption of pure soul. It wasn't just a song; it was a three-and-a-half-minute emotional storm. It was technically demanding, vocally athletic, and utterly exposing. It was, he realised with a jolt of fear and excitement, a showstopper. It was perfect.\n\n\"Oh, young woman, they're so sweet...\" he sang quietly, just under his breath, his deep voice barely a murmur. Leo's head popped up. \"Sing it louder!\" he demanded. Liam glanced at the closed curtains, a habitual secrecy taking over. But then he looked at his nephew\u2019s expectant face, and at the photo of his mother on the mantelpiece, and something inside him loosened. He took a breath and sang the line again, this time letting his voice fill the small room. It felt good. It felt right. By the time he reached the explosive final section, he was on his feet, using a rolled-up magazine as a microphone, belting out the \"Got to, got to, got to!\" part with a passion that made Leo whoop with delight and start dancing around the coffee table. For a moment, he wasn't Liam the Rower or Liam the Finalist. He was just a man singing in his living room, his heart full, sharing a moment of pure, unadulterated joy with the small boy who idolised him. The music faded, leaving him breathless, his chest heaving, a wide grin spreading across his face. This was what Claire meant. This was for fun. This was for him. This was for her.The euphoria of the living room performance evaporated in the harsh fluorescent light of the club\u2019s gym. The next few days fell into a brutal, familiar pattern. Pre-dawn sessions on the water, followed by punishing workouts on the rowing machines in the evening. The ergometer became his penitent's stool. He would strap his feet in, set the monitor for a two-thousand-metre piece, and pull. The fan whirred like a jet engine, the chain rattled, and the digital numbers on the screen became his entire world: split time, stroke rate, power output. But now, the machine had a soundtrack. The slow, soulful intro of \u2018Try a Little Tenderness\u2019 timed itself perfectly to his warm-up strokes. The explosive, desperate pleading of the song\u2019s climax became the internal roar that accompanied his final sprint, his legs burning with lactic acid, his vision tunnelling.\n\nDave watched him like a hawk. The coach would stand with his arms crossed, his gaze flicking between Liam's strained face and the unforgiving numbers on the monitor. He didn\u2019t say much, which was more unnerving than his usual bellowing. He\u2019d just circle the machine, his presence a heavy weight, occasionally tapping the screen. \u201cPower\u2019s fluctuating, Kenna. Your drive is inconsistent. One stroke you\u2019re a god, the next you\u2019re a tourist on a pedalo. Where\u2019s your head at?\u201d Liam, gasping for air, his throat raw, could only shake his head and try to focus. But focusing meant choosing one rhythm over the other, and his mind refused to cooperate. The rower and the singer were at war, and his body was the battlefield.\n\nAfter one particularly gruelling session, where his final five-hundred-metre split was two seconds slower than his personal best, Dave followed him to the water fountain. \"Alright, Liam. Out with it.\" The coach\u2019s voice was low, devoid of its usual bluster. It was the voice he used for serious conversations, the one that could cut through any excuse. \"Something's off. You're strong, you're fit, but you're not here.\" He tapped his own temple. \"You're somewhere else. Family okay? Work?\"\n\nLiam let the cold water run over his hands, stalling. This was the moment. The moment to tell him, to explain the absurd, wonderful, terrifying thing that had happened. But the words wouldn't form. He pictured Dave's face, the inevitable dismissal, the disappointment. To Dave, this would be a betrayal of everything they had worked for. It would be a weakness. \"Just tired, coach,\" he mumbled, not meeting his eye. \"Not sleeping well.\"\n\nDave let out a long, slow breath, a sigh of profound frustration. \"Well, you'd better get it sorted. The regatta is everything we've aimed for this season. To make sure you\u2019re ready, I've booked the senior squad into a full immersion training camp at Holme Pierrepont. Starts Friday next week. We drive down after work. Two solid days. No phones, no family, no distractions. Just us, the water, and the work. I need your head completely in the boat, son. Completely.\"\n\nThe words hit Liam like a physical blow. Friday next week. The Grand Final was on the Saturday. In Sheffield. Holme Pierrepont was in Nottingham, a good hour's drive away in the wrong direction. The carefully constructed wall separating his two lives had just been demolished by a wrecking ball. He felt a wave of nausea. He just nodded dumbly, the lie he\u2019d told moments before trapping him. \"Yeah. Okay, coach. Sounds good.\"\n\nThe drive home in The Biscuit Tin was a journey through a fog of panic. The conflict was no longer a philosophical one; it was a logistical nightmare. He couldn't be in two places at once. He couldn't serve two masters, especially not when one was as demanding as Dave and the other was as seductive as a sold-out auditorium. He parked on a quiet lane overlooking the town, the crooked spire just visible through the dusk, and killed the engine. He pulled out his phone and played the Otis Redding track. He tried to sing along, to find that soaring power he\u2019d discovered in his living room. But his throat was tight, constricted by anxiety. The notes that had flown so freely were now caged in his chest, weak and breathless. He wasn't a showstopper. He was a fraud who was about to let everyone down.\n\nHe didn't go home. Instead, he drove straight to Claire's house on the other side of town. He found her in the garden, patiently trying to untangle a set of solar-powered fairy lights while Leo directed her from a small plastic chair. She took one look at his face and set the tangled mess down. \"Oh dear,\" she said. \"That's your 'world-is-ending' face. I haven't seen that since you accidentally snapped one of Dave's precious carbon-fibre oars.\"\n\nIn a torrent of words, he explained the situation. The training camp. Dave\u2019s ultimatum. The impossibility of it all. \"I have to choose,\" he finished, slumping onto the garden bench. \"And I don't know how. If I miss the camp, I'm letting the whole squad down. Dave will probably kick me out of the first boat. My season will be over. But if I don't go to the final...\" He trailed off, unable to voice the alternative. To give up on the singing felt like cutting out a part of himself.\n\nClaire listened, her brow furrowed in concentration. She picked up a stray football and bounced it on her knee, a habit she had when she was thinking hard. \"Right,\" she said finally, her tone shifting from sympathetic sister to military strategist. \"This isn't a choice. It's a scheduling problem. We're not choosing, we're managing.\" She started pacing on the small patch of lawn. \"You go to the camp on Friday. You do the sessions. You tell Dave you have a\u2026 a family commitment you can\u2019t get out of on Saturday evening. A christening. A cousin's wedding. Something boring he can't argue with.\"\n\n\"He'll know I'm lying,\" Liam groaned. \"He can smell a lie from the other side of the canal.\"\n\n\"He won't care, as long as you're there for the important sessions,\" she countered, waving a dismissive hand. \"So, you do the Saturday morning session. You give it everything you've got. Then you get in your car at, say, two o'clock. You drive to Sheffield. You check into a cheap hotel I'll find for you. You have a shower, you put on the new suit we are going to buy you, and you go to the City Hall. You walk on that stage, you sing your heart out, and you win the whole damn thing. Then,\" she took a deep breath, \"you get back in your car, you drive back to Nottingham, get three hours sleep, and you're back on the water for the Sunday morning time trial. Simple.\"\n\nLiam stared at her as if she had just suggested he row to the moon. The plan was ludicrous, a punishing marathon of driving, stress, and sleep deprivation that would leave him wrecked for both events. It was a recipe for spectacular, public failure on two separate fronts. \"Claire, that's insane. I'll be exhausted. My voice will be shot. I won't be able to row the next day. I'll crash the car. I'll\u2026 I'll fail at both.\"\n\nShe stopped pacing and came to stand in front of him, her expression fierce with a belief he couldn't begin to muster for himself. \"Liam Kenna, since when have you ever backed down from something because it was hard? You get up at five in the morning to train in the freezing rain. You've rowed until your hands bled. You push your body to its absolute limit every single day for a piece of metal on a ribbon. This is just another race. It's longer, and a bit more complicated, but it's the same thing. You just have to grit your teeth and pull.\"Claire\u2019s words hung in the evening air, a blueprint for a miracle or a disaster. Liam stared at her, his mind reeling. The sheer audacity of the plan was breathtaking. It was a house of cards built on a lie, a punishing physical ordeal, and the reliability of a fifteen-year-old Ford Fiesta. Every rational instinct, every ounce of the disciplined caution that rowing had beaten into him, screamed that it was impossible. He would be spreading himself too thin, guaranteeing failure on all fronts. He would be a subpar rower and a hoarse, exhausted singer.\n\n\"It won't work,\" he said, the words heavy with defeat. \"My body won't take it. The drive, the lack of sleep... I'll be useless for the time trial on Sunday. Dave will see right through it.\" He imagined his coach's disappointed, flinty gaze as he posted a sluggish time, the quiet 'I told you so' that would follow. The thought made his stomach clench. \"And the singing\u2026 how can I sing a song like that, a song that needs everything you've got, when I'm running on empty?\"\n\nClaire stopped her pacing and took the football from Leo, who had been watching their exchange with the solemn intensity of a referee. She tucked it under her arm. \"You're thinking like a rower, Liam. You're looking at the splits, the timings, the energy expenditure. You're not factoring in the one thing that rowing doesn't measure.\" She tapped her chest. \"Heart. Adrenaline. The buzz you'll get from walking on that stage. That will carry you. That will be your fuel. Remember when Mum used to say you had more grit than sense? This is one of those times. You just have to decide if you have the guts to try.\"\n\nShe was right. He did think in numbers and physical limits. Rowing was a science of pain management and power curves. But singing\u2026 singing was alchemy. It was turning breath and memory into something that could make a stranger feel an emotion. He looked at his sister's determined face, so like their mother's in that moment, and felt a flicker of her insane optimism. What was the alternative? To call the competition organisers and withdraw? To tell them the quiet lad from Whittington Moor with the surprisingly big voice had to go to a training camp instead? The thought was unbearable. It felt like turning his back on that secret garden he\u2019d tended for so long, letting all the flowers wither.\n\n\"A christening?\" he asked, his voice barely a whisper. The lie felt sticky and unpleasant in his mouth.\n\nClaire\u2019s face broke into a triumphant grin. \"Exactly. Your second cousin, once removed. On your dad's side. Incredibly devout family. Utterly unmissable. Dave won\u2019t know any different. Now, first things first, we're going suit shopping tomorrow. You can't sing a showstopper looking like you're about to unblock a drain.\"\n\nThe following Saturday, Liam found himself standing awkwardly in the men's department of a Debenhams in Sheffield, feeling like an overgrown bear that had wandered into a haberdashery. The world of slim-fit trousers and tailored jackets was utterly alien to him. His wardrobe consisted of technical sportswear, work jeans, and a handful of check shirts. Claire, however, was in her element, pulling jackets from rails with ruthless efficiency. \"No, not double-breasted, it'll make you look like a wardrobe,\" she muttered, discarding one option. \"That one's too shiny, you'll look like a cruise ship entertainer.\" She finally thrust a dark charcoal suit at him. \"Try this.\"\n\nHe retreated to the changing room, the space feeling laughably small. He wrestled his way into the crisp shirt and trousers, his broad shoulders and thick thighs straining against the unfamiliar fabric. When he finally put on the jacket and looked in the mirror, he barely recognised the man staring back. The suit was well-cut, slimming his frame and giving him a silhouette that was less 'brute force' and more ' quiet authority'. The charcoal fabric complimented his dark hair and the deep blue of the shirt Claire had chosen brought out the colour of his eyes. For the first time, he saw a glimmer of the man who could walk onto the stage at the City Hall. He wasn't just Liam the rower in borrowed clothes; he was someone else. A performer. The idea sent a nervous thrill right through him. He stepped out. Claire\u2019s hand flew to her mouth. \"Oh, Liam,\" she breathed. \"You look... incredible. Mum would have loved this.\" The simple, heartfelt words were the only validation he needed.\n\nThe lie was the hardest part. He cornered Dave on Tuesday, after a brutal session on the water where he\u2019d pushed himself to the point of seeing stars, determined to prove his commitment before he confessed his fictional family obligation. The coach was wiping down a boat, his movements methodical. Liam cleared his throat. \"Coach, can I have a word?\" Dave grunted an affirmative, not looking up. \"It\u2019s about the training camp. On Saturday,\" Liam began, his heart thumping against his ribs. \"I\u2019ve got a family thing I can\u2019t get out of. A christening. In the evening. I can do the morning sessions, no problem, but I\u2019ll have to leave in the afternoon.\"\n\nDave stopped wiping. He slowly straightened up and turned to face Liam, his eyes narrowed. He was silent for a long, agonising moment, his expression unreadable. \"A christening,\" he repeated, the words flat. It wasn't a question. Liam nodded, his mouth dry. He braced himself for the explosion, the accusations, the dismissal. But it didn't come. Dave just looked at him, a flicker of something\u2014disappointment, maybe even hurt\u2014in his gaze. \"Your attendance at family events has never been a problem before, Kenna.\" He picked up a rag and tossed it into a bucket with a wet slap. \"Fine. Be there for the morning. I want two faultless sessions out of you. And you be back on that water at seven a.m. Sunday for the time trial. And you had better not be tired. Your cousin\u2019s soul might be saved on Saturday, but your place in this boat won\u2019t be if you pull a lazy time. Am I clear?\"\n\n\"Crystal, coach,\" Liam said, the relief so profound it almost buckled his knees. He had his permission, conditional though it was. But Dave\u2019s final look, a long, searching stare, left him feeling cold. The coach knew something was up. He just didn\u2019t know what. The lie now felt less like a clever piece of scheduling and more like a debt that would be called in at 7 a.m. on Sunday morning.\n\nThe rest of the week was a frantic, secret balancing act. On the water, he was a machine, his focus absolute, trying to placate Dave and banish any lingering suspicion. His splits improved. The water churned. But every spare moment was consumed by Otis Redding. He\u2019d take The Biscuit Tin to the furthest corner of the supermarket car park on his lunch break, windows rolled up, and sing. He\u2019d start soft, feeling the melody in his chest, and then build, letting his voice fill the small, rattling car, pushing for that raw, desperate edge in the song's climax. He sang to the steering wheel, the faded air freshener, the cracked dashboard. He sang until his throat ached, then he\u2019d chew a throat lozenge and drive back to work, the secret rumble of the song still vibrating inside him. The two halves of his life were running in parallel, a hair's breadth from a catastrophic collision.\n\nFriday arrived with a heavy, grey sky that threatened rain. Liam packed his car, the dissonance of his luggage a perfect metaphor for his state of mind. On one side of the boot was his long rowing bag, containing his lycra, his waterproof gear, and the familiar scent of river water and effort. On the other, hanging in a pristine garment bag, was the charcoal suit. It looked impossibly sophisticated and completely out of place, a visitor from another life. Claire and Leo came out to see him off. Leo gave his leg a fierce hug. \"Break a leg, Uncle Liam!\" he shouted, slightly misquoting his mother's instructions.\n\nClaire handed him a travel mug and a bag of sandwiches. Her usual cheerful bravado was gone, replaced by a quiet intensity. \"Drive carefully. Don't think about Sunday morning, don't think about Dave. When you get to Sheffield, just think about the song. Nothing else. You can do this,\" she said, squeezing his arm. He got into The Biscuit Tin, the engine catching on the third try with a worrying cough. As he pulled away from the curb, he saw Claire and Leo in his rearview mirror, waving, a tiny island of unwavering belief. He turned the corner and they were gone. He was alone, on the road to Nottingham, to the first leg of his impossible, terrifying, exhilarating double life. The plan was in motion. There was no turning back now.The Holme Pierrepont National Water Sports Centre was a place stripped of all sentiment. It was a factory for speed, all concrete, glass, and vast, intimidating stretches of flat water, engineered for perfect racing conditions. As Liam pulled The Biscuit Tin into the car park alongside the sleek Audis and BMWs of his teammates, he felt a profound sense of alienation. The other rowers were already unloading their gear, their voices loud and confident, their conversation a familiar litany of split times, rigging adjustments, and gossip about the rival Manchester club. They were a tribe gathering for war, and Liam, with his charcoal suit hanging in the back of his car like a guilty secret, felt like a spy in their midst. He was physically present, his body going through the well-rehearsed motions of unpacking and preparing his scull, but his mind was miles away, in a different city, humming a different tune.\n\nThe Friday evening session was brutal. The sun had long set, and the course was lit by harsh floodlights that turned the water into a black, reflective oil slick. The air was cold and bitingly damp. Dave herded them through a series of relentless power drills, his voice, distorted by the megaphone, echoing across the darkness. \"Drive! Legs! Kenna, your finish is sloppy! Are you tired already?\" For two hours, Liam rowed on instinct. He let the animal part of his brain take over, the part that knew only the burn in the quads, the strain in the back, the raw, scraping gasp for air. He tried to empty his head, to make it a blank space filled only with Dave's commands and the rhythm of the boat. But the melody of 'Try a Little Tenderness' was persistent. It weaved itself between the squeak of the oarlocks and the splash of the oars, a quiet, soulful counterpoint to the violent exertion of his body. He felt split in two, a ghost in his own machine.\n\nOn Saturday morning, the atmosphere in the spartan canteen was thick with tension. Liam sat with the senior squad, methodically eating a bowl of porridge he couldn't taste. The christening lie felt flimsy and absurd in the bright morning light. Mark, the wiry accountant, sat opposite him, wolfing down toast. \"Big day for the Kenna clan, eh? Don't let the holy water make you soft for the time trial tomorrow.\" The others chuckled. Liam forced a tight smile, feeling the heat rise in his cheeks. He caught Dave\u2019s eye from across the room. The coach was watching him, his expression cold and appraising, as if trying to solve a complex equation. There was no sympathy there, only a demand. Liam knew he had to deliver on the water. It was the only currency Dave respected, the only way to pay for the lie he was about to tell.\n\nHis first session was in the single scull, his sanctuary and his proving ground. As he pushed off from the pontoon, he felt a grim sense of determination settle over him. This was a test. He paddled to the 2000-metre start line, the water calm and glassy. Dave stood on the bank, stopwatch in hand. This was it. Liam took a deep breath, coiled his body, and on Dave\u2019s sharp command, he exploded into motion. He channelled everything into the oars: the anxiety, the guilt, the fear of failure, the impossible hope for the evening ahead. He turned it all into raw, blistering power. He didn't think, he just pulled. He focused on the pain, embracing it, using it. When he finally collapsed over the finish line, his lungs screaming and his vision blurred with black spots, he knew he had left nothing in the tank. He drifted for a minute, recovering his breath, before glancing at the bank. Dave looked at his stopwatch, then back at Liam. He gave a single, sharp nod. It was the highest praise Liam could have hoped for.\n\nThe second session, in the coxless four, was a greater challenge. It was about unity, a seamless blend of four bodies and minds. His crewmates were the club\u2019s best, and they tolerated no weakness. For the first few hundred metres, Liam struggled, his timing a fraction off, his mind still reeling from the solo effort. He felt a jarring bump through the hull, a sign of his blade clashing with another's rhythm. \"Get it together, Liam!\" hissed the rower in front of him. The rebuke shocked him back to the present. He shut his eyes for a single stroke, found the shared beat, the pulsing heart of the boat, and locked in. The jarring vanished, replaced by a smooth, powerful surge. They became one entity, the eight oars dipping and pulling in perfect, silent synchronicity. They flew across the water, the boat feeling light and alive beneath them. It was the magic of rowing, the feeling he had chased for ten years, and for a few glorious minutes, it eclipsed everything else.\n\nGetting away was the most awkward part. He showered and changed quickly, his heart hammering with a new kind of nervous energy. He packed his kit, acutely aware of Dave\u2019s presence lingering by the boathouse door. \"You\u2019ll send our love to the little one, won't you, Liam?\" Mark called out with a grin. Liam just nodded, his throat too tight to speak. He loaded his bag into The Biscuit Tin, trying to act casual, as if he were just popping out for a few hours. Dave walked over, wiping his hands on a rag. He didn't mention the christening. \"Seven a.m.,\" he said, his voice low and gravelly. \"That time trial is for your seat in the boat at the regatta. Nothing else matters. Don't be late.\" The unspoken part of the sentence hung heavily between them: *And you had better be in a fit state to race.* Liam met his coach's hard gaze. \"I won't be, coach.\" He got in the car, turned the key, and held his breath. The engine sputtered, coughed, then finally rattled into life. He didn't look back as he drove out of the car park and onto the main road, leaving the world of water and work behind him.\n\nThe ninety-minute drive to Sheffield was a journey between planets. The Biscuit Tin rattled along the M1, its protests a worrying soundtrack to Liam\u2019s escalating panic. The relief of escaping the camp was quickly replaced by the terrifying reality of what lay ahead. He was driving towards the biggest performance of his life, fuelled by porridge and a lie, with the threat of a career-defining time trial hanging over him the next morning. He tried to do some vocal warm-ups, humming scales, but his voice was tight and his throat felt dry. He was a rower who had just completed two gruelling, race-pace sessions. He wasn't a singer preparing for a final. He was an athlete, and his body was crying out for rest, for protein, for an ice bath, not for a three-and-a-half-minute emotional storm on a public stage. Doubt, cold and insidious, began to creep in. Claire's plan, which had seemed so brilliantly defiant in her back garden, now felt like a fool's errand, a script for a tragedy in two acts.\n\nHe found the budget hotel Claire had booked on the outskirts of Sheffield city centre. It was a drab, functional building wedged between a tyre depot and a fast-food restaurant. The room was small and aggressively beige, with a window that overlooked a car park. The air smelled faintly of stale smoke and bleach. It was the most beautiful, most welcome place he had ever seen. The anonymity was a blessing. Here, he wasn't Kenna the rower or Kenna the finalist. He was just a man in a beige room with a suit in a bag. He had two hours until he needed to be at the City Hall. He stood under the shower for a long time, the hot water beating down on his aching shoulders, trying to wash away the scent of the river and the lingering tension of the morning. He was trying to wash the rower off and let the singer emerge.\n\nHe dried himself off and walked over to the bed where he had carefully laid out the suit. It looked impossibly dark and formal against the cheap, patterned bedspread. Slowly, methodically, as if it were a pre-race ritual, he began to dress. The crisp, clean shirt. The perfectly knotted tie. The smart trousers. Finally, he shrugged on the charcoal jacket. He turned to face the full-length mirror screwed to the back of the door. The man who stared back was a stranger. The familiar, bulky frame was still there, but the suit gave it a different shape, a different meaning. His face was pale with exhaustion and nerves, but his eyes were bright, wide with a terrifying, electric anticipation. He was no longer the phantom of the canal or Dave's errant athlete. He was Liam Kenna, finalist. He took a deep, shuddering breath. The plan, Claire's insane, impossible plan, had worked. He was here. Now, all that was left to do was walk into the light and sing.The short walk from the hotel to the Sheffield City Hall was a journey through a dreamscape. Liam moved through the Saturday evening crowds, a ghost in a sharp suit. The city was alive with the thrum of weekend nightlife; music spilled from pub doorways, and the air smelled of perfume and exhaust fumes. He felt utterly detached from it all, a bubble of quiet panic moving through the boisterous streets. His body was a catalogue of aches: his shoulders, his back, his legs, all screaming in protest from the morning\u2019s exertions. He felt hollowed out, a vessel scoured clean by effort and anxiety, and he couldn't imagine how he was going to fill it with a voice big enough to reach the back of the auditorium. Then he saw it. The City Hall was grander and more imposing than he had imagined, its stone fa\u00e7ade floodlit against the bruised twilight sky. Banners for 'Voice of the Peaks' hung between the columns. A small crowd had gathered near the entrance, held back by barriers, their phone screens held aloft. It was real. This wasn't a pub open mic; it was an event. The absurdity of his presence here, the sheer, improbable leap from a Chesterfield canal to this grand stage, hit him with the force of a physical shock. He felt a desperate urge to turn around, to get back into The Biscuit Tin and drive, not back to the rowing camp, but just away, anywhere.\n\nBackstage was a different kind of chaos from the focused tension of a regatta. It was a dizzying world of glitter, hairspray, and theatrical anxiety. Slender young women in shimmering dresses practiced vocal scales in corners, while men with carefully styled hair and worn-out guitars paced nervously, muttering lyrics to themselves. The air buzzed with a competitive energy that was both sharper and more fragile than the brute-force rivalry he knew. In the rowing world, you could see your competition\u2019s strength in their physique, in the numbers on the ergometer. Here, the weapons were hidden, carried in the larynx and the heart, and the uncertainty was terrifying. Liam felt like a Shire horse at a greyhound race, too big, too solid, his movements too economical for this frantic, glittering space. He found an unoccupied corner behind a stack of flight cases, the cool wall a welcome anchor against the dizzying swirl of it all. He was Liam Kenna, the Singing Rower. A novelty act. A geological anomaly. The judges\u2019 words came back to him, and for the first time, they felt less like a compliment and more like a label for a freak.\n\nHe pulled out his phone, his thumb clumsy on the screen. There was a text from Claire. *'Just sing it for Mum. She's in the front row of your heart. Smash it. Love you. P.S. Leo says you're better than Harry Styles.'* A small, involuntary smile touched his lips. He read the message again, the words a lifeline. *Sing it for Mum.* It cut through the noise, the fear, the impostor syndrome. It gave him a purpose beyond winning, beyond the judges, beyond the television cameras. This wasn't about them. It was about that secret garden, that part of him he\u2019d shared only with her memory. It was about standing on the hearth with a TV remote for a microphone. He closed his eyes, picturing her smiling face, and the tight knot of panic in his chest loosened just a fraction. He felt a hand on his arm and jolted. A harried-looking woman with a headset and a clipboard was looking at him. \"Liam Kenna? You're on after this act. Five minutes.\"\n\nThe walk from the wings felt like the longest journey of his life. The previous contestant, a young girl with a powerful pop voice, was taking her bow to rapturous applause. The sound washed over him, a physical wave of noise. Then the stage manager gave him a gentle push, and he was walking out into the light. It was blinding, a wall of pure heat and brightness that erased the audience, turning the vast auditorium into a deep, unknowable darkness punctuated by the faint red glow of recording lights. He could just make out the judges' table, a long, dark shape where the three arbiters of his fate sat in silhouette. He found his mark in the centre of the stage, a simple piece of tape on the floor that felt like the loneliest spot on earth. The applause for the previous singer died away, replaced by an expectant, cavernous silence. In that silence, his exhaustion roared back. A profound, bone-deep weariness. He could feel the two sessions from that morning in every screaming muscle fibre. He was running on nothing.\n\nThen, the soft, familiar notes of the introduction to 'Try a Little Tenderness' floated out from the house band. The simple piano melody was a balm, a familiar friend in this terrifyingly alien environment. He gripped the microphone, the metal cool and solid in his sweaty palm. He brought it to his lips. This was it. No more hiding. No more rowing backwards. He had to face the music. He took a breath, not the sharp, gasping breath of a rower, but a slow, deep intake from the diaphragm, just as he'd practiced in the front seat of The Biscuit Tin. He thought of his mother, of Claire and Leo, of the quiet lad from Whittington Moor who had a secret to tell. And he sang. The first line was quiet, almost hesitant, his voice husky with nerves and fatigue. *\u201cOh, she may be weary\u2026\u201d* The sound felt small, swallowed by the vastness of the hall. He could feel the judges shifting, perhaps sensing his lack of power, and a cold spike of fear lanced through him. He was failing. Claire\u2019s insane plan was crumbling.\n\nBut then he sang the next line. *\u201c...and young girls, they do get weary, wearing that same old shabby dress.\u201d* He wasn't just singing the words; he was living them. He *was* weary. He felt the truth of it in his aching back, in the burn in his thighs. The raw honesty of his own physical state connected with the song's emotion, and something shifted. He wasn't performing anymore; he was testifying. He drew on the rower's discipline, the ingrained ability to push through pain, to find another gear when the body is screaming to stop. He channelled that grit not into an oar, but into his voice. As the song began its famous build, the horns kicking in, his voice found its true place. It deepened, strengthened, filled with a richness and power that surprised even him. It was the sound he had found in his living room, but amplified, electrified by the stage and the moment.\n\nHe felt the atmosphere in the hall change. The silence was no longer empty; it was charged, attentive. He could feel thousands of people leaning in, listening. He risked a glance at the judges' table. The woman who had called him a geological anomaly was leaning forward, her glasses pushed up on her head, her mouth slightly agape. He had their attention. The song moved into its final, explosive section. It was now or never. He let go of the last vestiges of control, the last shred of self-consciousness. He poured the exhaustion, the conflict, the hope, the grief for his mother, the love for his sister, all of it, into the music. *\u201cYou got to, got to, got to\u2026 try a little tenderness!\u201d* The words were a roar, a desperate, passionate plea torn from the very soles of his feet. It was the raw, unvarnished sound of his soul. He held the final, soaring note until his lungs burned and his vision swam, giving every last ounce of breath and energy he possessed. Then, as the band crashed to a halt, he let the microphone drop to his side, his chest heaving, his head bowed, utterly spent. For a heartbeat, there was absolute, profound silence. Then, the darkness in front of him erupted. The sound of a thousand people on their feet, the roar of applause and cheers, hit him like a tidal wave, a thunderous, undeniable answer to the question he had been too afraid to ask.The wave of sound was a physical thing, washing over him, pressing him down. Liam stood with his head bowed, his chest a mess of aching muscles and heaving lungs, as the roar of the crowd filled every inch of the vast auditorium. It was nothing like the cheers at a regatta finish line, which were a shared, communal explosion of relief and victory. This was different. This was a thousand separate moments of connection aimed directly at him, a thousand strangers telling him they had heard his secret. He was utterly, profoundly alone in the centre of that storm of approval, and it was the most terrifying and beautiful feeling of his life.\n\nHe forced himself to look up, blinking against the stage lights that now seemed less aggressive, more warming. Through the glare, he could see them: a sea of blurred, smiling faces, a forest of hands clapping above their heads. People were standing not just in the front rows, but all the way to the back of the stalls, up into the grand circle. He saw a woman in the third row openly weeping, her friend's arm around her shoulder. He saw a man who looked like a retired steelworker, built like a brick outhouse, nodding slowly, a look of profound respect on his weathered face. It was too much to process. It was a language of emotion he was only just beginning to understand.\n\nThe show\u2019s host, a man with a smile so bright it seemed to have its own power source, glided over and put a companionable arm around Liam's shoulders. The gesture felt strange against his sweat-dampened suit. \"Liam Kenna, ladies and gentlemen! Let's hear it one more time!\" The host held his microphone out to the audience, and the roar swelled again. \"Wow,\" the host said, his voice a professional blend of awe and bonhomie. \"Liam, I think it's safe to say you left a piece of your soul on that stage tonight. The judges are speechless, but I'm going to make them speak. Let's go to the panel.\" The lights shifted, and Liam found himself facing the three silhouettes, now leaning forward into their own pools of light.\n\nThe woman who had peered at him over her glasses in the auditions spoke first, her voice hushed with emotion. \"Liam, I've been doing this a long time. I have heard technically perfect singers, I have heard powerful singers, and I have heard singers with great stage presence. It is a rare, rare thing to hear a singer with truth. What you did with that song... it wasn't a performance. It was a confession. It was the most honest three and a half minutes of music I have ever had the privilege to witness on this stage.\" The other judges echoed her sentiments, speaking of vocal power and emotional depth, but Liam barely heard their words. He was fixated on the phrase 'a singer with truth'. It resonated deep within him, naming the very thing he had been striving for without even knowing it. He mumbled his thanks, his head swimming, the words of praise blurring into the applause, all of it becoming a single, overwhelming sensory experience.\n\nHe walked off the stage in a daze, guided by a gentle hand on his back. The applause followed him into the wings, finally fading as he passed back into the glitter-and-hairspray chaos of the backstage area. The atmosphere had changed. The other contestants, his rivals, no longer looked at him with polite curiosity. They looked at him with wide-eyed awe. A couple of them patted him on the back as he passed, murmuring \"Incredible, man,\" and \"That was something else.\" The praise from his peers, who knew what it took to stand on that stage, felt more real than the roar of the crowd. He found his quiet corner behind the flight cases and sagged against the cool wall. And then, as if a switch had been flicked, the adrenaline vanished. A wave of exhaustion so profound it was nauseating washed through him. His legs began to tremble uncontrollably. The aches from his two rowing sessions, which had been masked by the stage lights, returned with a ferocious, biting intensity. He was no longer a showstopper; he was just an exhausted athlete who had pushed himself far, far beyond his limits.\n\nHe knew he couldn't stay. He couldn't wait for the public vote, for the final results. His grand final was over, but his ordeal was not. He had another race to run. He found the harried stage manager, who was now looking at him with a new level of respect. \"I have to go,\" he said, the lie feeling worn and familiar now. \"Family emergency.\" She nodded instantly, her expression full of sympathy. \"Of course. Oh, gosh, I'm so sorry. Is everything okay? We'll call you, of course. You're... you're a shoo-in for the top two, at least.\" He just nodded, unable to think about winning. \"Thank you,\" he managed, before slipping out of a heavy fire door and back into the anonymity of the Sheffield night. The cool air was a shock. The sounds of the city felt muted and distant. He walked back to the aggressively beige hotel, his movements slow and stiff, a man twice his age. He changed out of the charcoal suit with a tenderness that bordered on reverence, folding it carefully, as if it were a relic from a life he had lived only for a single evening.\n\nThe Biscuit Tin started on the fourth try, its phlegmy roar a welcome, familiar sound in the silent hotel car park. The journey back to Nottingham was a surreal battle against sleep. With the windows down and the cold night air blasting his face, he drove south on a near-empty M1. The motorway lights became hypnotic, dangerous comets streaking past. He cranked the radio, a cacophony of late-night pop and talk shows filling the small car, a desperate attempt to keep the fog of exhaustion at bay. He drank the last of the lukewarm water from his bottle and thought of Dave's cold stare. *Seven a.m.* The deadline was a beacon in the darkness, a point on the map he had to reach. It was the most gruelling endurance event of his life, a slow, rattling crawl back to his other reality.\n\nWhen he finally pulled into the deserted car park at Holme Pierrepont, it was almost two in the morning. The facility was a collection of dark, brutalist shapes under a cold, starry sky. The silence was absolute, a crushing weight after the noise of the city, the stage, and his rattling car. He felt like an astronaut returning to a silent, sleeping earth after a mission to a loud and vibrant planet. He let himself into his shared room, moving with practiced stealth. His roommate was a dark lump under a thin duvet, his deep, rhythmic breathing the only sound. Liam didn't have the energy to undress. He kicked off his battered trainers, peeled off his jeans, and collapsed onto the narrow, unyielding mattress in his hoodie and t-shirt. Sleep, he thought, would be a mercy, a sweet oblivion. But it wouldn't come. His body was a thrumming network of aches and pains, and his mind was a battlefield. The roar of the crowd clashed with the squeak of his oarlocks. His mother\u2019s smile flickered behind his eyelids, followed by Dave\u2019s unimpressed glower. He lay in the darkness, trapped between two worlds, too tired to sleep, too wired to rest, as the precious hours ticked away.\n\nThe shrill, digital scream of his phone alarm at six o\u2019clock was an act of violence. For a moment, he had no idea where he was. The thin, grey light, the smell of damp sportswear, the spartan room\u2014it all came flooding back with a crushing weight. He swung his legs over the side of the bed and every muscle in his body screamed in a unified chorus of protest. He felt brittle, scoured out, profoundly unwell. He stumbled to the small sink and looked in the mirror. The man who stared back was a stranger. His face was pale and drawn, his eyes bloodshot and sunk deep in their sockets, circled by bruises of exhaustion. The victorious singer, the man who had looked so sharp in a charcoal suit, was gone. In his place was a haggard, haunted-looking rower on the verge of collapse. He pulled on his lycra, the tight fabric feeling less like a second skin and more like a straitjacket. He was an empty cup, and he was about to be asked to pour a gallon. The time was 6:35 a.m. His reckoning with Dave was less than half an hour away.The walk from his room to the boathouse felt like crossing a vast, unforgiving desert. The concrete path was a mile long, the damp morning air a physical weight on his chest. Other rowers, fresh from a full night's sleep, jogged past him, their bodies loose and ready, their banter sharp and bright in the pre-dawn gloom. They were coiled springs, and he was a length of frayed, overstretched rope. He nodded and grunted in response to their \"Morning, Kenna\" greetings, his own voice a dry rasp. He felt their glances linger on him, noting the pallor of his skin, the dark hollows under his eyes. He was a piece of faulty equipment, a boat with a slow leak, and everyone could see it.\n\nHe found his scull, a sleek black needle of carbon fibre that usually felt like an extension of his own body. This morning, it felt alien, a finely-tuned instrument he no longer knew how to play. As he began checking his riggers, a shadow fell over him. It was Dave. The coach stood with his arms crossed, a steaming mug of tea in one hand, a stopwatch in the other. He didn't speak for a long moment, simply observing Liam's slow, stiff movements. His silence was more damning than any tirade.\n\n\"The christening go well, Kenna?\" Dave asked, his voice deceptively mild, the gravelly edge smoothed away into something far more dangerous. \"Must have been a long service. You look like you've been wrestling with the devil all night and lost.\"\n\nLiam\u2019s hands froze on the rigger bolt. He couldn\u2019t bring himself to look up. \"It was... a long drive, coach,\" he mumbled to the hull of his boat.\n\n\"Right,\" Dave said, taking a slow sip of his tea. \"A long drive.\" He took a step closer, lowering his voice so only Liam could hear. \"I don't know where you were last night, son. And right now, I don't care. All I care about is what happens in the next seven minutes on that stretch of water. You told me you wouldn't be tired. You're a liar. Your face is a mess, and you look like you're about to fall over. But you're here. You're in your kit. So you're going to race.\" He pointed the stopwatch at Liam like a weapon. \"This little clock doesn't care about your excuses. It only tells the truth. Let's see what kind of truth you've got left in you.\"\n\nHe walked away without another word, leaving Liam feeling stripped bare, his lie exposed and worthless. The coach knew. He knew he'd been played for a fool, and now he was going to watch Liam pay the price in the only currency that mattered: time. The shame was a physical burn, worse than the ache in his muscles. He felt a surge of anger\u2014at Dave, at Claire, but mostly at himself for thinking he could pull this off. He finished his preparations on autopilot, his mind a numb void, and carried his boat to the pontoon. The water was flat and grey, a black mirror that reflected the miserable sky. It felt like an ending.\n\nPushing off from the pontoon, he paddled slowly towards the start line. Each stroke was a negotiation with his protesting body. His back was a rigid plank, his legs felt like they were filled with wet sand, and his head throbbed in time with his strained heartbeat. He lined up next to the other single scullers, each man in his own lane, a picture of coiled, focused power. Liam felt like a ghost among them. When the starter's electronic horn blared, his body reacted out of pure, deep-seated instinct. He launched into the first powerful strokes, the initial 'drive' phase of the race. But the explosion he expected from his legs wasn't there. It was a dull, muffled push. The boat felt heavy, sluggish, stuck in the water. Within two hundred metres, he could see the other scullers pulling away from him, their puddles of disturbed water already a boat-length ahead. The panic he\u2019d been holding at bay crashed over him. He was failing. Publicly and spectacularly.\n\nThe first five hundred metres were a private hell. His technique, usually so fluid and powerful, fell apart. He was pulling with his arms, his back straining, his legs unresponsive. The digital monitor at his feet showed a split time that was five, then six, then seven seconds slower than his worst training pace. It was a time that would see him relegated to the second boat, his season\u2019s ambitions turning to dust. He could almost feel Dave\u2019s cold, triumphant gaze from the towpath. *This is what you get for your lies. This is the truth.* The thought made him want to stop, to just let the oars drift and slump over, defeated. But then another voice cut through the fog of pain and shame. A judge's voice. *A singer with truth.*\n\nWhat was the truth now? The truth was that he was exhausted. The truth was that he was in pain. The truth was that he was failing. He had sung that truth last night. He hadn't hidden his weariness; he had poured it into the song. Could he do that here? Could he row the truth? He stopped fighting his body, stopped trying to force a power that wasn't there. He eased off for a single stroke, taking one deep, ragged breath. He closed his eyes and thought not of the finish line, but of the stage lights. He thought of the roar of the crowd, the feeling of a thousand people hearing him, really hearing him. He remembered the raw, desperate cry of Otis Redding's voice, the sheer force of will that pushed the song to its climax. *Got to, got to, got to...*\n\nThe phrase became a mantra, a new rhythm for the boat. He found a different gear, not of power, but of relentless, stubborn endurance. He stopped thinking about his split time and started thinking about the beat. *Catch... (Got to)... Drive... (Got to)... Finish... (Got to)... Recover.* His strokes were not beautiful. They were not efficient. They were ugly, guttural, a raw and desperate heave. He was no longer a technician; he was a labourer, digging his blades into the water and dragging the boat forward with whatever he had left. He was rowing with his heart, with the memory of the song, with the ghost of his mother\u2019s pride. He was channelling the singer, the man who stood and delivered when he had nothing left, into the rower's exhausted body.\n\nHe didn't know if he was getting faster. He had stopped looking at the monitor. His world had shrunk to the grey water, the hiss of the hull, and the three-word mantra driving him forward. He entered the final five hundred metres, the 'red zone' where races are won and lost. A primal roar built in his chest. He pulled with a ferocity that came from somewhere beyond his muscles, from the same deep well of emotion he had drawn from on stage. He saw the orange buoys of the finish line, a blurred smear in his tunnel vision. He pulled one last, agonising stroke, then another, and then he was through. He collapsed forward, the oars slipping from his numb fingers, his head and chest slumping onto the deck of the boat. He lay there, gasping, his body convulsing, utterly and completely spent. He had nothing left. He had given the water the only truth he had.The world returned to Liam in fragments. First, the frantic, scraping sound of his own breathing. Then, the gentle slap of water against the hull of the scull, a sound that was usually a comfort but now felt like a mocking pat on the back. A profound trembling started in his legs and spread through his entire body, a seismic release of a strain his system could no longer contain. He tried to sit up, to regain some semblance of a rower's posture, but his core muscles refused the command, sending sharp, protesting signals of failure. He remained slumped over, his cheek pressed against the cold, wet carbon fibre, a beached whale in a skin-tight suit. He had rowed the truth, and the truth had broken him.\n\nHe heard the gentle crunch of footsteps on the gravel towpath, slowing and then stopping beside his boat. He didn't need to look up to know who it was. The silence that followed was heavy and absolute, a judgment in itself. Liam squeezed his eyes shut, bracing for the inevitable storm of Dave\u2019s fury. He deserved it. He had lied, he had been foolish, and he had posted a time that was almost certainly a disgrace.\n\n\"Your time was four seconds off your personal best.\"\n\nThe statement was so unexpected, so contrary to the catastrophe he had felt, that Liam thought he had misheard. He pushed himself up with a groan, his arms shaking, and finally looked at his coach. Dave was standing there, staring not at Liam, but at the stopwatch in his hand, his brow furrowed as if the device had presented him with an impossible paradox. Four seconds. It wasn't good. For an elite rower, it was a significant margin. But it wasn't the disaster Liam had expected. It wasn't the time of a man who should have been ten, fifteen seconds slower. It was the time of a man who had fought.\n\n\"I don't know how,\" Dave said, finally looking up. His gaze was no longer cold or angry. It was something far more unnerving: analytical and intensely curious. \"For the first six hundred metres, you were rowing like a novice. You were tense, your rhythm was shot, you were bleeding speed with every stroke. I was about to pull you off the course. And then... something changed. Your technique was still a mess. It was ugly. But your power output spiked. You held it all the way to the line. It was the ugliest, most inefficient, most stubborn piece of rowing I have ever seen in my life.\" He paused, shaking his head slightly. \"So I'll ask you again. Where were you last night, Kenna?\"\n\nThe lie had dissolved. There was no point to it anymore. Liam let out a long, shuddering breath that was half-sob, half-laugh. \"I was in Sheffield. At the City Hall. I was in the final of a singing competition.\" He said the words to the water, to the boat, to himself as much as to Dave. They sounded even more ridiculous out loud in the cold morning light.\n\nDave was silent for a long moment. He looked from Liam's haggard face to the boat, then back again, as if trying to reconcile the two realities. \"Right,\" he said, the single word laden with a decade of accumulated disbelief. He tucked the stopwatch into his pocket. \"A singing competition.\" He didn't mock. He didn't shout. He just stated it as a fact he was now forced to incorporate into his worldview. \"Get your boat out of the water. You look like death. Go and get something to eat. And then you and I are going to have a conversation about your commitment to this crew.\" He turned and walked away, his stiff-backed posture radiating a complex mix of disappointment and reluctant respect that was far more potent than pure anger.\n\nThe act of getting the boat out of the water was a Herculean effort. Mark, his face a mixture of concern and mischievous curiosity, came to help him lift the scull onto the trestles. \"Blimey, Liam. That christening take it out of you? You look like you've been on a three-day bender with the devil's choir.\" Liam just grunted, his body too broken for banter. As he wiped down the hull, his hands moving with slow, deliberate care, news of his performance began to ripple through the squad. Whispers followed him into the changing rooms. Someone had seen an article on a local news site. Someone else had a cousin who'd been watching. The secret was out, and it was spreading like wildfire.\n\nHe collapsed onto a bench, peeling off his wet lycra with a groan. His phone lay in the bottom of his bag, a small, black rectangle of judgement. He had deliberately ignored it, terrified of what it might tell him. Had he won? Had he lost? Had he made a fool of himself in front of a television audience? Part of him didn't want to know. The performance itself, the act of singing his truth, felt like the only thing that mattered. The result was just an administrative detail. But he was also human. He had to know. With trembling fingers, he pulled it out. The screen lit up with a blizzard of notifications. Dozens of WhatsApp messages from the club group chat, a flurry of texts, and five missed calls from Claire. And one email. The subject line read: *A Message from the Voice of the Peaks Team.*\n\nHis heart hammered against his ribs. He ignored Claire's calls for a moment and opened the email.\n\n*Dear Liam,*\n*On behalf of the entire production, we wanted to thank you for what was, by any measure, one of the most memorable and moving final performances we have ever had. The public vote was incredibly close. In the end, the title of Voice of the Peaks 2024 was awarded to Sasha Jones. We are absolutely thrilled, however, to name you as our runner-up. The judges were unanimous in their praise for your unique talent and emotional honesty...*\n\nRunner-up. He read the words again. Not the winner. He felt a sharp, surprising pang of disappointment, a competitor\u2019s instinctive reaction to second place. He had lost. But as he read on, the formal, corporate language of the email faded, and the meaning settled in. Runner-up. In a real, televised singing competition. He, Liam Kenna, the quiet lad from the canal. A smile, slow and genuine, spread across his exhausted face. He hadn't won. And it was okay. More than okay. It was brilliant. He hadn't failed. He had stood on a stage and sung his heart out and people had listened. He had raced in a boat when his body was broken and had found a way not to quit. In a single, impossible twenty-four-hour period, he had come in second in two different lives, and somehow, it felt more like a victory than any gold medal he had ever won. He leaned his head back against the cold tiles of the changing room wall and closed his eyes, the roar of the crowd and the hiss of his hull on the water finally finding a strange, quiet harmony in his mind.He let his head rest against the cool, damp tiles of the changing room wall for a long moment, the phone still clutched in his hand. Runner-up. The two words seemed to hum with a quiet, steady energy, a counterbalance to the screaming exhaustion in his limbs. Before he could overthink it, before the disappointment could curdle the strange joy, he tapped on Claire\u2019s name and raised the phone to his ear. It was answered before the first ring had even finished, an explosion of sound that made him pull the receiver away from his head.\n\n\"LIAM! OH MY GOD, LIAM! YOU WERE AMAZING! I'M CRYING, LEO'S HYPERVENTILATING, DAD ACTUALLY SMILED! WE WERE AT THE RUTLAND AND THE ENTIRE PUB WENT SILENT WHEN YOU STARTED, AND THEN WHEN YOU FINISHED, THEY WERE STANDING ON THE TABLES! ON THE TABLES, LIAM! I'VE GOT IT ON VIDEO! YOU WERE ROBBED, ABSOLUTELY ROBBED, BUT WHO CARES, YOU WERE INCREDIBLE!\"\n\nHer voice, a breathless, joyous torrent, was the purest form of victory he could imagine. He found himself laughing, a cracked, hoarse sound that hurt his throat but felt wonderful. \"Claire, calm down,\" he managed, his own voice thick with emotion. \"I can't... I didn't win, Claire.\"\n\n\"Don't you dare say that!\" she retorted, her voice fierce with pride. \"You won. You walked onto that stage looking like James Bond's bigger, better-looking brother from Derbyshire, and you sang like an absolute god. Everyone knows you won. Sasha was brilliant, but you... you were something else. You were real. Mum would have... she would have been so, so proud.\" There was a catch in her voice now, and Liam felt his own eyes sting. In the background, he could hear Leo shouting, \"Uncle Liam is a pop star! He's a pop star!\"\n\nHe stayed on the phone for ten minutes, basking in the uncomplicated warmth of his sister\u2019s pride, letting it soak into his bones and begin the slow work of healing his frayed spirit. She told him about the prize\u2014a recording session at a professional studio and a not-insignificant sum of money that would more than cover the cost of a new engine for The Biscuit Tin. The practicalities of it were grounding, making the dreamlike events of the night before feel solid and tangible. When he finally hung up, the small, sterile changing room no longer felt like a cell. It felt like a chrysalis from which he was, painfully and slowly, beginning to emerge.\n\nHe dressed with the deliberate movements of an old man, pulling on his jeans and a clean hoodie. When he finally pushed open the door and walked back into the main boathouse, the atmosphere had undergone a seismic shift. The earlier whispers had been replaced by a quiet, buzzing curiosity. A group of the younger rowers stopped their conversation and just watched him walk past. Mark detached himself from a group and came over, phone in hand, a wide, incredulous grin on his face.\n\n\"Kenna,\" he said, shaking his head in disbelief. \"I've got three missed calls from my wife. She says if I don't get your autograph, I'm sleeping in the shed.\" He held up his phone, showing Liam a clip from the final, filmed from a TV screen. It was the climax of the song, his face contorted in a mask of raw emotion, his voice a powerful roar that seemed impossible coming from the exhausted man standing there now. \"Mate, we all thought you were just a big lump who could pull an oar. We didn't know you had *that* in you. That was... mega.\" Another rower, one of the serious, taciturn giants from the coxless four, clapped him on the shoulder, a gesture that almost sent Liam staggering. \"Good on you, mate,\" he said, his voice gruff with an approval that meant more than a thousand standing ovations. They didn't mock him. They didn't see weakness. They saw a different kind of strength, and in their own blunt, understated way, they were in awe of it.\n\nThe final trial, however, was yet to come. Dave\u2019s office was a small, cluttered cave at the end of the boathouse, a place smelling of old paper, damp wool, and industrial-strength coffee. Race plans and tide tables were pinned to a corkboard, and trophies from bygone eras gathered dust on a high shelf. It was the nerve centre of Dave's world. Liam knocked on the open door. Dave was at his desk, staring at a spreadsheet on his computer screen. He didn\u2019t look up. \"Shut the door,\" he said. The quiet command sent a chill through Liam. He did as he was told, the click of the latch sounding unnervingly final.\n\n\"So,\" Dave began, swivelling his chair around. \"You're a singer.\" He said the word 'singer' as if it were a newly discovered species of insect he was trying to classify. \"You lied to me, you jeopardised your place in the boat, you risked the whole crew's performance at the regatta, and you turned up this morning looking like something the cat dragged in. All for a karaoke contest.\"\n\nLiam stood before the desk, his hands hanging uselessly at his sides. He didn't offer an excuse. He owed his coach the truth, ugly and complicated as it was. \"It wasn't karaoke, coach. And it wasn't just for a contest.\" He took a breath. \"My mum... she loved music. We used to sing all the time. After she died, the house went quiet. Singing those old songs was... it was my way of remembering her. Of keeping that part of her alive. It was just for me. I never meant for it to become this.\" He gestured vaguely, indicating the whole impossible situation. \"But it did. And last night, I had to see it through. I had to.\"\n\nDave listened, his expression unreadable, his steepled fingers hiding his mouth. He was a man who dealt in quantifiable metrics: power, speed, endurance. He was being presented with data he couldn't plot on a graph. \"Your mother,\" he said, his voice losing some of its edge. \"She was a good woman. Came to every race.\" The unexpected memory seemed to hang in the air between them. He looked down at his desk, at the spreadsheet of split times and power curves, then back up at Liam.\n\n\"I saw the video,\" Dave admitted, his voice low. \"Mark showed me. In the final minute of that race this morning, when you had nothing left, your face looked exactly like it did on that stage. Like you were tearing it out of yourself. I've spent ten years trying to teach you how to dig that deep, how to find that place where you go beyond what you think you're capable of. And you found it. Not on the water. But in a theatre, singing some old love song.\" He leaned back in his chair, a long, slow sigh escaping him. It was the sound of a fundamental belief system rearranging itself. \"I don't understand it. And I don't have to. But I saw what it did for you this morning. You should have been dead on your feet. You should have been fifteen seconds slower. But you weren't. You found a way.\"\n\nHe stood up and walked to the corkboard, staring at the crew list for the Northern Regatta. Liam\u2019s name was at the top, under 'Single Scull' and 'Coxless Four'. \"Your place in this boat isn't about loyalty, Kenna. It's about speed. And it's my job to make you faster. If singing songs in a suit makes you faster, then sing your bloody songs.\" He turned around, his eyes locking with Liam\u2019s. There was no smile, but the hard, flinty disappointment was gone, replaced by a new, grudging understanding. \"But if your time slips by even one second because of it, you're out. And you're cleaning the toilets for a month. Are we clear?\"\n\n\"Crystal, coach,\" Liam said, the relief so profound it felt like a physical release, a muscle unclenched after a decade of tension.\n\nHe walked out of Dave's office and back into the boathouse, which was now bustling with the post-training activity of a normal Sunday morning. But nothing felt normal. He felt lighter, as if he'd been rowing with a weighted vest on for years and had only just taken it off. He walked out of the boathouse doors and into the full light of the day. The sun had finally broken through the grey cloud, and the river, his place of work and worship, shimmered with a new, welcoming brilliance. He got into The Biscuit Tin and turned the key. The engine, for once, started on the first try, settling into a steady, reliable rattle. He pulled out of the car park and onto the open road, driving not towards home, but just driving. He didn't turn on the radio. He didn't need to. For the first time, there was no conflict, no counter-rhythm. There was only the steady beat of the engine and the quiet, harmonious rhythm of his own heart, a rhythm that finally belonged to a man who was whole.The road back to Chesterfield unravelled before The Biscuit Tin in a ribbon of grey tarmac under a now-brilliant sky. The familiar landmarks of his home county\u2014a distant view of Bolsover Castle, the gentle roll of the fields near Calow\u2014seemed new, as if he were seeing them for the first time with both eyes open. The profound exhaustion remained, a deep, resonant hum in his bones, but the frantic, panicked edge had gone. It was a clean fatigue, the satisfying ache of a body and soul that had been pushed to their absolute limits and had, somehow, held. He felt scoured clean, hollowed out, but ready to be filled again. For the first time in as long as he could remember, there was no war inside his head. There was only a quiet, spacious peace.\n\nHe pulled into a lay-by that overlooked the valley where the town was nestled, the crooked spire a familiar, reassuring punctuation mark against the sky. He killed the engine and the sudden silence was welcome. He scrolled through his phone and found his dad\u2019s number. He hesitated for a moment. Their calls were usually brief, functional affairs about shopping lists or boiler repairs. Since his mum had died, they communicated mostly through a shared, unspoken grief, a quiet understanding that the most important thing had been taken from their lives and words were a poor substitute. But Claire had said he\u2019d smiled. That single image was an invitation. He pressed the call button.\n\nIt rang four times before his dad picked up, his voice a gruff, questioning \"Liam?\"\n\"Hi, Dad. I'm on my way back,\" Liam said, his own voice sounding foreign, softer than usual.\n\"Right,\" his dad replied. A pause stretched between them, filled with the static of years of unsaid things. Liam could picture him perfectly, sitting in his worn armchair, the remote control on the arm, the racing pages open on his lap.\n\"Claire said you were at The Rutland last night,\" Liam prompted gently.\nAnother pause. \"Aye. Place was packed. Had to stand.\"\n\"Oh. Right.\" Liam searched for what to say next. \"So... you saw it then?\"\n\"I saw it,\" his dad confirmed. The silence that followed was different this time. It felt less like an absence and more like a space being held. Liam waited. \"That song,\" his dad said finally, his voice thick, as if the words were being dredged up from a deep, rusty well. \"That Otis Redding one. Your mother loved that song. Used to play it on the record player on a Sunday morning while she was cooking.\"\n\nThe simple statement landed with the force of a revelation. It was an acknowledgement, a connection, a shared memory offered up like a priceless gift. It was his father\u2019s way of saying *I heard you. I understood.* It was everything. \"Yeah,\" Liam managed, his throat tight. \"Yeah, I know, Dad.\"\n\"You did alright,\" his dad added, the highest praise in his limited emotional vocabulary. \"She'd have liked it.\" And then, as if he had expended his entire quota of sentiment for the decade, he cleared his throat. \"Your auntie Jean's asking if you can take a look at her lawnmower next week. Says it's making a funny noise.\" The familiar territory of the mundane was a relief for both of them. They talked for another minute about the lawnmower, then said their goodbyes. Liam ended the call and leaned his forehead against the steering wheel, a single, hot tear tracing a path through the grime on his cheek. He hadn't won a trophy, but he had gotten his dad to talk about a Sunday morning.\n\nWhen he finally pulled up outside his small terraced house, it felt more like a home than it had in years. The silence within its walls was no longer one of absence, but one of peace. He walked into the living room and his eyes went straight to the mantelpiece, to the crowded rowing trophies standing guard around the single, faded photograph of his mother. She was smiling, her head tilted slightly, a look of amused affection in her eyes. He felt he could finally meet her gaze without the familiar, accompanying pang of guilt for all the music that had died with her. He had sung her song. He had brought it back. He walked upstairs, stripped off his clothes, and fell into bed. The sleep that took him was not the fitful, anxious rest of a man at war with himself, but a deep, dreamless, healing oblivion.\n\nHe woke hours later to the gentle light of late afternoon slanting through his window and the persistent buzzing of his phone on the bedside table. He felt groggy but fundamentally different, as if some crucial part of his internal machinery had been taken out, cleaned, and slotted back into its rightful place. The phone buzzed again. It was a message from Mark. *'The video of you in the final is doing the rounds on a massive rowing forum. They're calling you The Sculling Soulman. You're a legend, mate.'* Liam stared at the words, a slow smile spreading across his face. The Sculling Soulman. It was ridiculous, but it was also perfect. He was no longer two separate, warring entities. He was one thing.\n\nCuriosity finally got the better of him. He showered, pulled on a pair of old jeans and a t-shirt, and walked down to the corner shop for a pint of milk and a newspaper. He felt a strange self-consciousness as he walked, a new awareness of how people saw him. He was no longer anonymous. As he put the milk on the counter, the woman behind the till, Mrs. Evans, a woman who had sold him sweets and comics since he was Leo\u2019s age, peered at him over her glasses. \"It is you!\" she exclaimed, her voice loud in the quiet shop. \"Off the telly last night! Oh, you were wonderful, love! Had a tear in my eye. You were robbed, you were. That girl was good, but you... you had soul!\" She leaned forward conspiratorially. \"My Brenda's getting married in August. We need a wedding singer...\" Liam laughed, a genuine, easy laugh, feeling a blush creep up his neck. He stammered something about being busy with training and made his escape, clutching his milk and the local paper, his heart thumping with a strange mixture of embarrassment and pleasure. The secret was out, and he was beginning to realize that maybe it wasn't a cage he had escaped, but a door he had finally walked through. His secret garden now had an open gate.Back home, the newspaper sat on his kitchen table, its headline a testament to the surreal turn his life had taken. *\u2018Local Rower\u2019s Soulful Surprise at Peaks Final\u2019*. There was a slightly grainy picture of him on stage, his face a mask of passion, the smart charcoal suit looking impossibly formal. He read the article, a mixture of local news reporting and breathless praise, and it felt like reading about a stranger. He had spent his entire adult life cultivating a kind of invisibility, his identity defined by the brute, anonymous force required to move a boat backwards. To be seen so clearly, to have the most private part of himself laid bare for public consumption, was a dizzying, disorienting experience. The quiet lad from Whittington Moor was gone, and in his place was this \u2018Sculling Soulman\u2019, a public figure, albeit on a very small, very local scale. He wasn't sure if he was ready for the promotion.\n\nThe following Tuesday, as he walked into the boathouse for the evening session, the change was palpable. Someone had pinned the newspaper article to the club noticeboard, right next to the regatta sign-up sheets. As he passed, a young novice rower, barely eighteen, nervously asked him to sign the edge of the clipping. The request was so absurd that Liam almost laughed, but the boy\u2019s earnest, hero-worshipping expression stopped him. He scribbled his name awkwardly with a biro, his signature looking clunky and unfamiliar, the scrawl of a man more used to gripping an oar than a pen. The old locker room banter had shifted, too. The usual jibes about his pre-dawn training or his monstrous appetite had been replaced by a new, recurring theme. As he was changing, Mark's phone, placed pointedly on a bench, began to play the opening bars of 'Try a Little Tenderness'. A ripple of snickering went through the room. Liam, expecting the familiar hot blush of embarrassment, was surprised to find himself just shaking his head and smiling. The joke had lost its power to wound him; the secret was no longer his to protect.\n\nHe carried that new, lighter feeling with him down to the water. As he launched his scull into the cool, dark river, the evening felt charged with a different kind of energy. For years, these sessions had been a form of penance, a physical grind to atone for a day spent sitting at a desk. Now, it felt like something else. It felt like expression. He pushed off, the boat gliding smoothly, and as he began to row, he didn't fight the music in his head. He invited it in. The catch, the drive, the finish, the recovery\u2014it was no longer just a sequence of movements. It was a four-beat bar of music. He found the rhythm of the song that was always playing in his mind, Al Green's 'Let's Stay Together', and matched his stroke to its steady, soulful pulse. He wasn't rowing against his nature anymore; he was rowing with it. The boat seemed to respond, surging forward with a smooth, powerful grace that felt effortless, a perfect harmony of muscle and melody.\n\nDave stood on the towpath, his familiar silhouette a fixed point in the deepening dusk. Liam was doing timed one-thousand-metre pieces, and he knew the coach's stopwatch was tracking every stroke. He finished his first piece, his breathing deep but controlled, his muscles burning with a clean, efficient fire. He paddled gently, waiting for the inevitable critique to be barked across the water. But it didn't come. Dave just clicked his stopwatch and made a note on his clipboard. \"Again,\" was all he shouted. Liam completed a second piece, and a third, each one feeling as strong and fluid as the last, his body and mind working in a rare, seamless partnership. As he paddled back towards the boathouse, Dave walked alongside him on the path. \"Your consistency has improved,\" the coach grunted, his gaze fixed straight ahead. \"Your times for those three pieces were within half a second of each other. Strong times.\" He was silent for a few paces. \"I got a call,\" he said, so quietly Liam had to strain to hear. \"From a fella at the National Rowing Magazine. They want to do a feature. On the club. On you. 'The Singing Rower Who Found An Extra Gear'.\" Dave said the phrase with the same distaste as if he were describing a piece of mouldy bread. \"I told them to call back next week.\"\n\nLater that evening, Claire came over, brandishing a bottle of Prosecco and a USB stick. \"Official celebration,\" she announced, shooing him onto the sofa. \"Dad's babysitting, the hype has died down just enough for us to have a proper moment, and I have the evidence.\" She plugged the stick into his television, and a shaky, cacophonous video filled the screen. It was the footage from The Rutland Arms. He watched, mesmerised, as the camera panned across the packed pub, across the faces of people he'd known his whole life. He saw his neighbours, old school friends, fellow parents from Leo's football team, all of them standing, their conversations stilled, their eyes fixed on the pub's television where his own face was singing. And then the camera found his dad, standing by the bar, a half-empty pint in his hand, his expression uncharacteristically open, his gaze locked on the screen. He wasn't smiling, but he was *watching*. He was present. As the song on the television reached its climax, the pub erupted, a roar of pure, communal joy. Liam watched himself on the screen, a man he barely knew, and then watched the reaction of the people who knew him best, and finally understood. It wasn't about the prize, or the judges, or the fame. It was about this. It was about connection. It was about making the people in your small corner of the world feel something.\n\nThe bottle of Prosecco was half-empty when he finally checked his emails. Tucked between work memos and spam was a message from a 'Phoenix Sound Studios'. The email was professional and to the point, detailing the prize: two full eight-hour days in a state-of-the-art studio with a house producer to record and mix two songs of his choice. They proposed a weekend a month from now. A month. It seemed both an age away and terrifyingly close. \"Two songs,\" he said out loud, the words feeling heavy and significant. \"What would I even sing?\" The first was obvious. 'Try a Little Tenderness' was his song now, the anthem of his transformation. But the second? He needed something that wasn't a showstopper, something that showed a different side. Something quieter, more intimate. He thought of his dad's words, of the Sunday mornings of his childhood. \"Claire,\" he said, turning to his sister, who was happily scrolling through comments on the pub video. \"Do you remember that Sam Cooke song Mum always used to sing when she was trying to get us to tidy our rooms? The one she'd change the words to?\" Claire looked up, her brow furrowed in concentration for a moment before her face lit up. \"A Change Is Gonna Come,\" she said, her voice soft. \"She used to sing 'A change is gonna come... to this messy bedroom'.\" The memory, so specific and so tender, was perfect. It was a song of struggle, but also of profound hope. It was a conversation with his mother, and a promise to himself.\n\nHe drove to his morning session a few days later, The Biscuit Tin rattling along the quiet Derbyshire lanes. The radio was on, playing some forgettable chart song, but Liam wasn't listening. He was humming, a low baritone rumble in his chest. He was working through the melody of 'A Change Is Gonna Come', feeling its gentle rise and fall, its quiet power. He pulled into the boathouse car park and saw Mark getting his boat off his car roof. Mark heard the humming as Liam got out of the car and grinned. \"Morning, Sculling Soulman. Warming up the golden pipes?\" Two months ago, the comment would have sent Liam into a spiral of self-conscious silence. This morning, he just smiled back. \"Got to, mate,\" he said, his voice easy and confident. \"Big session ahead.\" He walked towards the boathouse, the melody still on his lips, the cool morning air filling his lungs, ready for the work. He was no longer two halves of a person fighting for control. He was a rower. He was a singer. And for the first time, it felt like the most natural thing in the world.The week between the regatta and the recording session passed in a dreamlike haze. The gold medal, heavy and cool, sat on his mantelpiece, but it felt different from the others. It wasn't just a symbol of physical victory; it was a validation of his entire, chaotic journey. It was a tangible piece of proof that the Sculling Soulman was not a novelty act, but a formidable competitor. The win had cemented his status at the club, transforming him from a curiosity into a quiet leader. Younger rowers would ask him for advice, not just on technique, but on managing race-day nerves, their questions betraying a new respect for his mental fortitude. He found he had answers for them, speaking not in the cold, technical terms Dave used, but in metaphors of rhythm and focus that he was only just discovering himself. He was, to his own astonishment, becoming a mentor.\n\nHis first act with the prize money was a pilgrimage to a garage on the outskirts of Chesterfield, a place recommended by his dad, run by an old mechanic who allegedly spoke the language of failing engines. Liam left The Biscuit Tin with him, along with a significant portion of his winnings, feeling a strange pang of anxiety, like leaving a sick, elderly relative in a nursing home. He spent the rest of the week borrowing Claire\u2019s car, a sensible, silent Toyota that felt utterly devoid of character. The quiet hum of its modern engine only made him miss the familiar, complaining rattle of his own car. The Biscuit Tin, for all its faults, was part of his story, its percussive engine a backing track to his secret singing practice. He hoped the mechanic wouldn't fix the soul out of it.\n\nHe drove to Phoenix Sound Studios on a bright Saturday morning in Claire\u2019s unnervingly reliable car. The studio was located in a converted Victorian mill in a fashionable part of Sheffield, a world of exposed brickwork, artisan coffee shops, and people who looked effortlessly creative. It was a far cry from the functional brutality of Holme Pierrepont or the damp, earthy smell of the Chesterfield canal. Liam walked into the reception area, his old guitar case in one hand\u2014containing not a guitar, but a change of clothes and a packed lunch\u2014and felt a fresh wave of impostor syndrome. The walls were lined with gold and platinum discs, monuments to albums he had grown up with. This was a place where real musicians came, where magic was made, and he was a rower who had gotten lucky on a local TV show.\n\nA young man with bright pink hair and a friendly, open face came out to greet him. \"Liam? I'm Ben, the producer. Massive fan of your performance in the final, man. That was epic. Ready to make some noise?\" Ben\u2019s easy, unaffected enthusiasm was a welcome antidote to Liam\u2019s nerves. He led him through a corridor and into the main studio. The room took Liam\u2019s breath away. It was a huge, wood-panelled space, dominated by a grand piano and a forest of microphone stands. On the other side of a vast window was the control room, a dizzying array of buttons, faders, and screens that looked like the cockpit of a spaceship. It was both terrifying and beautiful. \"Right,\" Ben said, clapping his hands together. \"Let's get some levels. We'll start with 'Tenderness', get you warmed up with the big one. Just stand in the middle there, and sing a bit of the chorus for me.\"\n\nLiam stood in the centre of the cavernous room, a pair of heavy headphones over his ears. He felt small and exposed under the studio lights. He cleared his throat and sang the explosive climax of the song. The sound in his headphones was extraordinary. It was his own voice, but magnified, clarified, stripped of all echo and room noise. He could hear every breath, every tiny imperfection, every nuance of his tone. It was like seeing his reflection in a perfectly still lake for the first time. For a moment, he faltered, intimidated by the sheer clarity of the sound. \"That's great, mate, lovely warm tone,\" Ben's voice crackled in his ears from the control room. \"Don't be afraid of it. Just give it what you gave it on the telly. From the top.\" Liam took a deep breath, closed his eyes, and sang. He poured the memory of the stage lights, the roar of the crowd, and the recent victory at the regatta into the performance. He sang with a new confidence, a new control, the song feeling less like a desperate plea and more like a joyful declaration.\n\nThe day was a revelation. Ben was a genius, a patient and intuitive guide who knew exactly how to get the best out of him. He pushed Liam to try different phrasings, to experiment with the dynamics, to find the quiet vulnerability in the opening verses as well as the raw power in the climax. By lunchtime, they had a vocal take for 'Tenderness' that made the hairs on Liam\u2019s arms stand up. It was him, but it was bigger, better, the version of the song he had always heard in his head but had never quite been able to produce. After a lunch of Claire's cheese-and-pickle sandwiches, they moved on to 'A Change Is Gonna Come'. The atmosphere in the studio shifted. The energetic, rock-and-roll vibe was replaced by a quiet, almost reverent concentration.\n\nThis song was harder. It couldn\u2019t be conquered with power; it had to be inhabited with feeling. Liam\u2019s first few takes were technically sound but emotionally hollow. He was singing the notes, but he wasn't telling the story. \"Okay, let's take a break,\" Ben said, his voice calm and encouraging in the headphones. \"Tell me about this song. Why did you pick it?\" Liam, feeling strangely comfortable in the intimate space created by the headphones, found himself telling Ben about his mum, about the Sunday mornings, about her changing the lyrics to make him tidy his room. He spoke of his dad's reaction, of the feeling of bringing music back into a silent house. Ben listened without interrupting. \"Right,\" he said when Liam had finished. \"That's what the song is about. It's not about the civil rights movement, not for you. It's about your mum. It's about your dad. It's about Sunday morning. Forget the studio, forget me. Close your eyes and sing it to her.\"\n\nLiam stood in the silence of the vocal booth, the weight of the headphones a comforting presence. He closed his eyes and he was no longer in a Sheffield recording studio. He was a small boy again, standing in the doorway of his parents' kitchen, the smell of a roast in the air, the sound of his mother's voice, clear and happy, filling the room. He sang from that place. He sang with a quiet, trembling intensity, his voice imbued with a lifetime of love and loss. The performance was stripped bare of all artifice, a simple, heartbreakingly honest conversation with a memory. When he sang the final, hopeful line, \"It's been a long time coming, but I know a change is gonna come,\" his voice cracked with an emotion he didn't try to hide. He held the last note until it faded into the profound silence of the studio. For a long moment, there was no sound from the control room. Then, Ben's voice came through the headphones, thick with feeling. \"Yeah,\" he said softly. \"That's the one.\"A month slipped by, the seasons turning in that indecisive way of an English spring shifting towards summer. Life for Liam settled into a new kind of normal, a rhythm that was both familiar and fundamentally altered. The days were still marked by the early morning pilgrimage to the canal and the quiet hum of his office job designing drainage systems for the council, a profession so prosaic it felt like the perfect cover for a man with a secret life. But the secret was out, and the pressure that had built for years inside him had been released, leaving behind a sense of quiet confidence, a comfortable occupation of his own skin. He no longer felt like two people living in one body, but a single man with a wide and varied landscape inside him.\n\nThe email from Ben arrived on a Tuesday afternoon, a bright spot in the grey landscape of spreadsheets and technical drawings. The subject line was simple: *'Your Finished Tracks'*. Liam\u2019s heart gave a theatrical lurch. He waited until his colleagues had left for lunch before plugging his headphones into his computer, the office\u2019s low-level hum fading to nothing. He clicked the link for \u2018Try a Little Tenderness\u2019 first. The opening piano chords, crisp and clear, filled his ears. Then the bass and drums kicked in, warmer and richer than he remembered. Ben had worked his magic, adding subtle layers of organ and a richer, fuller horn section that made the track swell with a professional, radio-ready polish. And then his own voice entered, deep and resonant. He listened, utterly mesmerised, a strange sense of dissociation washing over him. It was him, undeniably, but it was a version of him amplified and illuminated, the sound of the man he had only just discovered he could be. He was listening to his own potential, recorded and mastered, and it was a humbling, exhilarating experience.\n\nWith a trembling finger, he clicked on the second track. The gentle, melancholic guitar intro of 'A Change Is Gonna Come' began, and the mood shifted instantly. Ben had kept the production sparse, creating a vast, intimate space around his voice. He had added a soft halo of strings that didn't appear until the second verse, lifting the melody like a gentle updraft. Liam closed his eyes, leaning back in his squeaky office chair, and was transported back to the vocal booth, to that quiet, sacred space where he had sung to his mother\u2019s memory. The recording had captured it all: the ache, the hope, the quiet tremor of unshed tears. The final, cracked note hung in the air and faded to silence, and Liam sat completely still for a full minute, a single tear tracing a path down his cheek before he hastily wiped it away, his chest tight with an emotion that was equal parts grief and gratitude.\n\nThat evening, he went to Claire's. The three of them, Liam, Claire, and a wildly excited Leo, huddled around his laptop in the living room like conspirators. He played 'Tenderness' first. Leo, who had been bouncing on the sofa, instantly launched into a frantic, flailing dance, using a cushion as an air guitar during the horn solos. Claire just watched the screen, her hand over her mouth, her eyes shining with tears of pure, unadulterated pride. \"Liam, it's... it's a proper record,\" she whispered, as if she couldn't quite believe it. Then he played 'A Change Is Gonna Come'. The effect was immediate. Leo\u2019s dancing ceased. He sat down quietly beside his mum, his usual whirlwind energy stilled by the song's solemn power. Claire\u2019s silent tears began to fall freely, and she reached out and squeezed his hand, a fierce, protective grip that said everything. There were no grand pronouncements, just a shared, sacred silence in the song\u2019s aftermath, a family listening to its own heart.\n\nThe next day, he went to his dad's. He didn't make a big announcement. He just walked into the living room where his dad was watching the afternoon racing and placed a small Bluetooth speaker on the coffee table. \"Just wanted you to hear this, Dad,\" he said, and pressed play. His dad didn't move from his armchair, his gaze remaining on the television where silent, brightly coloured horses were parading in a paddock. He didn't seem to be listening. 'Tenderness' filled the quiet room, its power and passion a stark contrast to the room's dusty, muted stillness. Then 'Change' began. As the opening chords played, Liam saw his dad's hand, resting on the arm of the chair, subtly begin to tap in time with the slow, deliberate rhythm. His gaze drifted from the television to a spot on the wall, a place of memory. He remained completely still until the very last note faded. The ticking of the mantelpiece clock was the only sound. \"It's good,\" his dad said finally, his voice gruff. He cleared his throat. \"Clear as a bell. You can hear all the words.\" He picked up the TV remote. \"Your mother would have liked that.\" It was all he said, but it was more than enough.\n\nOn Saturday morning, he got the call. The Biscuit Tin was ready. He took a bus to the garage on the industrial estate, a cavernous, oil-scented workshop run by a gnarled mechanic named Frank who looked like he had been assembled from spare engine parts. \"Right,\" Frank grunted, wiping his hands on a rag that had seen better decades. \"Your big end was shot. Skimmed the head, new gaskets, new water pump. Had to rebuild half the carburettor out of bits I had from an old Cortina.\" He looked at Liam with a kind of weary pity. \"She's a wreck, this thing. But she's got a bit of heart.\" He handed Liam the keys. \"Don't go thrashing her.\" Liam got into the familiar, worn driver's seat. He turned the key. The engine coughed once, then caught, settling not into its usual death-rattle, but into a steady, healthier thrum. The violent shaking was gone, but it wasn't silent. It still had its voice, a distinctive, gravelly rumble. It sounded like a grizzled old bluesman who'd given up whiskey but still smoked sixty a day.\n\nHe drove away from the garage, the car feeling more responsive, more alive. He merged onto the Chesterfield bypass, accelerating with a smoothness he hadn't felt in years. The sun was bright, the sky was a deep, cloudless blue, and the road was clear. He plugged his phone into the car's crackly stereo system and, for the first time, played his own finished songs in the car that had served as his first rehearsal room. As his own voice, clear and strong, filled the small, rattling space, a profound sense of rightness settled over him. The car was healed. He was healed. He was the Sculling Soulman, driving his beloved, battered Biscuit Tin into the wide, unknown territory of the rest of his life, the road ahead shimmering with possibility.Summer arrived in earnest, laying a thick, warm blanket over the Derbyshire hills and turning the water of the Chesterfield Canal a deep, lazy green. Liam\u2019s life, which had once been a rigid, monochrome routine of work and training, was now saturated with colour and complexity. His newfound local fame was a strange, low-level hum in the background of his days. He couldn\u2019t go for a pint in town or do a weekly shop without someone stopping him to talk about \u2018the show\u2019, their praise a warm but slightly discomfiting reminder of his public vulnerability. He was no longer just Liam Kenna; he was a story people told each other, a piece of shared local pride.\n\nClaire, revelling in her self-appointed role as his manager and publicist, insisted he had to make a return to the place where it had all started: the open mic night at The Rutland Arms. Liam was hesitant. The thought of performing there again felt different. Before, it had been a secret act of courage, a quiet test in a room full of strangers. Now, he knew the room would not be full of strangers. It would be full of people who had come specifically to see him, their expectations shaped by a dramatic, televised performance. The pressure felt immense, and he almost backed out, but Claire was relentless. \u201cIt\u2019s a thank you,\u201d she\u2019d insisted. \u201cTo the pub, to the people who supported you. You owe them a song, you big lump.\u201d\n\nThe Tuesday night he walked into the pub, the air was thick with anticipation. It was packed to the rafters, a buzzing, sweaty, cheerful crowd that spilled out into the beer garden. The usual handful of hopeful performers and their patient friends had been swallowed by a sea of familiar faces from every corner of his life. He saw his dad in a corner, nursing a pint, deep in an uncharacteristically animated conversation with Mark from the rowing club. He saw Mrs. Evans from the corner shop, and Frank the mechanic, who gave him a gruff nod. It felt less like a gig and more like a surprise party he was expected to provide the entertainment for. When the host, a genial man named Phil with a magnificent beard, called his name, a roar went up that made the glasses on the bar rattle.\n\nHe walked to the small, makeshift stage, his heart thumping a nervous rhythm against his ribs. He didn't bring a big production. He just nodded to the house guitarist, a talented player he'd spoken to earlier, and they began the gentle, soulful introduction to Bill Withers\u2019 \u2018Lovely Day\u2019. He chose it deliberately. It wasn't a showstopper; it wasn't a cry of pain or a desperate plea. It was a simple, joyful expression of gratitude. As he began to sing, a hush fell over the rowdy pub. He wasn't trying to impress anyone. He was just singing to his friends, to his neighbours, to his town. He looked out at the faces in the crowd, saw them smiling, saw them mouthing the words along with him. He sang the famous, impossibly long note in the middle of the song, holding it with the lung capacity of a national-level rower, and the crowd went wild, cheering him on, their energy lifting him, carrying him. When the song finished, the applause was warm, genuine, and deeply personal. It was the sound of belonging.\n\nHe stayed for the rest of the night, sipping a pint of ale, enjoying the anonymity that had returned now his \u2018turn\u2019 was over. He listened to the other performers\u2014a nervous young woman with a beautiful folk voice, a grizzled old bluesman on a harmonica\u2014with a new appreciation for their courage. As he was getting ready to leave, a woman approached him, her face vaguely familiar. She was older, with intelligent, sharp eyes and a cascade of silver hair. \"Liam Kenna?\" she asked, her voice quiet but clear. \"My name is Eleanor Vance. I help organise the Edale Folk & Blues Festival.\" The name registered immediately. It was one of the most respected small festivals in the North of England, a curated event known for its authenticity and high-quality musicianship. \"I was here tonight,\" she continued. \"A friend told me to come. I don't usually book acts based on TV competitions; they're often all flash and no substance. But what you have... it's genuine. It's honest.\" She handed him a business card. \"We have a spot on the main stage, Saturday afternoon. It\u2019s a paid slot. We\u2019d be honoured if you\u2019d consider it.\"\n\nLiam stared at the card in his hand, the embossed letters feeling heavy and significant. The Edale Festival. It wasn't a competition. It was an invitation to be considered a real artist, to share a bill with musicians he deeply admired. The thought was so overwhelming he felt dizzy. \"Thank you,\" he stammered. \"I... I'd have to check my schedule.\" Eleanor Vance smiled, a knowing, patient smile. \"I imagine you would. Your rowing schedule, I mean. The festival is the last weekend in July.\" The words hit Liam with the force of a physical blow. The last weekend in July. It was the same weekend as the Henley Royal Regatta, the most prestigious, most iconic, most important event in the British rowing calendar. For a competitive rower, Henley wasn't just another race; it was the ultimate goal, the culmination of a year's, or even a lifetime's, work. To be selected to race there was the pinnacle of the sport.\n\nHe drove home in The Biscuit Tin, the familiar rattle of the engine a counterpoint to the frantic buzzing in his mind. The old conflict, which he thought he had resolved, had returned with a vengeance, bigger and more complex than before. This wasn't a choice between a training camp and a TV final. This was a choice between the two highest peaks of his two separate worlds. To race at Henley was the rower's ultimate dream. To play on the main stage at Edale was a musician's dream he hadn't even dared to have. The two dreams could not coexist. The house of cards Claire had built for him for the final had been a one-time miracle; there was no way to be in two such demanding places, hundreds of miles apart, on the same weekend. He had to choose.\n\nThe next day, he found Dave by the boat racks, meticulously polishing an oar. Liam knew he had to address it head-on. \"Coach,\" he began, his voice steady. \"I've been offered a slot at the Edale Festival.\" Dave stopped polishing, but didn't look at him. \"Right,\" he said, his tone neutral. \"When is it?\" Liam took a breath. \"The last weekend of July.\" Dave slowly placed the oar down and finally turned to face him, his expression unreadable. \"Henley,\" he said. It wasn't a question. \"They're paying you?\" Liam nodded. \"It's a proper gig.\" Dave picked up his rag again, turning his attention back to the oar, his movements slow and deliberate. \"Well, Kenna,\" he said, his voice a low gravelly rumble that seemed to come from the centre of the earth. \"Looks like you have to decide what you are. Are you a professional rower who sings a bit? Or are you a professional singer who messes about in boats?\" He didn't say another word, but the weight of the choice, and of his coach\u2019s unspoken disappointment, settled on Liam\u2019s shoulders, heavy and suffocating. He walked home, opened his calendar, and stared at the two dates, circled in red, on opposing pages of his life. The choice was stark, brutal, and entirely his.The blade sliced the water, but the sound was no longer a clean rip in the silence. It was a dull thud, the sound of an obligation being met. The canal, his timeless confidante, felt different now, its surface reflecting not the dawn sky but the stark, binary choice that had fractured his world. Henley or Edale. The past or the future. The man he had built or the man he was discovering. Dave's words echoed with every stroke, a brutal, unforgiving rhythm that drowned out any melody. *Are you a professional rower who sings a bit? Or are you a professional singer who messes about in boats?* The question wasn't about scheduling; it was an interrogation of his very soul, and the water offered no answers, only a cold, indifferent reflection of his own turmoil.\n\nFor a decade, this rhythm had been the answer to everything. When he was stressed, he rowed. When he was grieving, he rowed. When he needed to feel strong, he rowed. The simple, punishing mechanics of the stroke had always been enough to scour his mind clean. But now, the magic was gone. The motion felt hollow, the burn in his muscles just a familiar ache, not a cleansing fire. He found himself looking at the banks, at the familiar trees and the distant smudge of the crooked spire, with the eyes of a tourist. He was a visitor in his own life, a ghost going through the motions. The thought of Henley, which should have been a blazing sun on his horizon, now felt like a colossal, crushing weight. It represented the culmination of everything he had worked for, the respect of his peers, the approval of his coach. To turn away from it felt like a betrayal, an act of profound self-sabotage. But the thought of turning down Edale, of letting that invitation to a new world expire, felt like a slow, quiet death. It was the closing of a door he had only just found the courage to open.\n\nHe tried to talk to Claire about it, but the conversation felt like a foregone conclusion. They sat in her small, chaotic garden, the late afternoon sun casting long shadows, while Leo chased a football around them. Liam laid out the impossible choice, and Claire, ever the pragmatist, saw no dilemma at all. \"Liam, it's not a choice,\" she said, her tone firm, as if explaining a simple sum to a struggling pupil. \"Henley is a race you've already won a dozen times in a dozen different boats. It's more of the same. More aching muscles, more 5 a.m. starts, more of Dave grunting at you. Edale... Edale is a beginning. It's a stage full of people who want to hear *you*, not just watch your back while you pull an oar. It's the world opening up for you. Rowing is what you're good at. Singing is what you love. When do you get to choose what you love?\" Her logic was flawless, her passion infectious, but it didn't ease the knot in his stomach. She saw it as a simple equation of head versus heart. She didn't feel the weight of ten years of loyalty, the phantom ache of blisters on his hands, or the heavy burden of Dave's conditional respect.\n\nThe conflict followed him home, a constant, low-level hum of anxiety. He stood in his living room, staring at the mantelpiece, a museum of his former life. He picked up his national championship medal, its weight familiar and substantial in his palm. He remembered the feeling of that win: the lung-searing agony of the final sprint, the explosion of relief at the finish line, the shared, exhausted triumph with his crewmates. It was a brutal, powerful joy. Then his gaze fell on the small, unassuming business card from Eleanor Vance, which he had propped against his mother's photograph. Edale. He imagined standing on that stage, not with a crew, but alone with a guitar and a microphone. He imagined the silence of a listening crowd in an open field, the sun setting behind the Peak District hills. He imagined the connection, the vulnerability, the quiet, profound joy of sharing a story through a song. It was a different kind of victory, one that couldn't be measured by a stopwatch.\n\nHe knew who he needed to talk to. He drove to his dad's house on a Thursday evening, finding him in the greenhouse at the bottom of the garden, tending to his tomato plants. The air was warm and smelled of earth and growing things. Liam didn't know how to begin. He ended up just stating the facts, his voice sounding flat and emotionless in the quiet greenhouse. \"I've been invited to race at Henley,\" he said, pinching a stray leaf from a plant. \"And I've been asked to sing at the Edale festival. They're on the same weekend.\" His dad continued his work, carefully tying a sagging stem to a cane. He didn't speak for a long time, his movements slow and methodical. \"Henley,\" he said finally, the name itself a recognition of its importance. \"That's the big one, isn't it? The one with the blazers.\" \"Yeah, Dad. That's the one.\" \"And this festival?\" \"That's a big one, too. For music.\" His dad finished tying the knot and straightened up, wiping his earthy hands on his trousers. He looked at Liam, his gaze direct and clear. \"When you were a lad,\" he began, \"you and your mother, you were always singing. She'd be in the kitchen, you'd be in the living room, singing back and forth to each other. I never understood half of it. But I understood the look on her face.\" He paused, looking past Liam, back into a memory. \"When you won your first big race, she was proud. Fit to burst. Told everyone she met. But when she heard you sing... proper sing, like at your cousin's wedding... she didn't just look proud. She looked... happy. Like a part of her she thought was lost had turned up in you.\" He picked up his watering can. \"There's a difference between what makes you proud and what makes you happy, lad. You've spent a long time making other people proud. Might be time to do what makes you happy.\"\n\nThe simple words, spoken without sentiment but with a profound, quiet truth, landed like a key turning in a lock. It was permission. Not just from his dad, but from the memory of his mother, from a part of himself he had kept quiet for too long. He drove home, the conflict gone, replaced by a calm, terrifying certainty. The decision was made. He sat at his kitchen table and composed an email to Eleanor Vance, his fingers moving with a newfound confidence. He accepted her offer. Then, he picked up the phone. The harder call was to Dave. But he knew it couldn't be a call. It had to be face to face.\n\nThe next morning, he found Dave in his office, staring at the crew lists pinned to the corkboard. Liam stood in the doorway, his heart a slow, heavy drum. He didn't wait for an invitation. \"Coach, I've made my decision,\" he said, his voice clear and steady. \"I won't be going to Henley. I'm going to sing at the festival.\" Dave didn't turn around. He remained staring at the board, his back a rigid wall of disapproval. \"I see,\" he said, his voice cold and flat. \"So you've decided. You're a singer.\" \"No,\" Liam said, taking a step into the room. \"I'm a man who is going to sing at a festival. It doesn't mean I'm not a rower. It just means I have to do this.\" Dave finally turned, and the look on his face was not anger, but a deep, weary disappointment that was infinitely worse. \"Rowing isn't something you just 'do', Kenna. Not at this level. It's everything. It demands everything. You can't be a part-time contender. It's all or nothing. I thought you understood that.\" He turned back to the corkboard, took a pen from his desk, and drew a single, thick, black line through Liam Kenna's name on the Henley crew list. The sound of the pen scratching across the paper was the only sound in the room, a brutal, final act of severance. \"The squad is my responsibility,\" Dave said, his back still to him. \"And the squad needs athletes who are fully committed. I wish you luck with your... music.\" The word was dropped like a stone. It was a dismissal. Liam stood for a moment, the finality of the act washing over him. He had made his choice, and the consequences were real and immediate. He felt a profound sense of loss, a grief for the life he was leaving behind. But underneath it, buried deep, was a flicker of something else. A terrifying, exhilarating spark of freedom. \"Thank you, coach,\" he said quietly to the man's unrelenting back. Then he turned and walked out of the boathouse, leaving a decade of his life behind him, stepping out into the bright, uncertain light of a future he would have to write himself.The boathouse door clicked shut behind him, a sound no louder than a snapping twig, yet it echoed in his mind with the finality of a prison gate slamming. Liam stood in the car park, the morning sun feeling unnaturally bright and hostile on his face. The familiar, comforting scent of river water and damp earth was replaced by the acrid smell of tarmac and exhaust fumes. He felt profoundly out of place, a deep-sea creature suddenly stranded on a sun-bleached beach. His car keys felt heavy and useless in his hand. He couldn\u2019t get in The Biscuit Tin, couldn't drive away. That would be an escape, an admission of defeat. He needed to walk, to feel the solid ground beneath his feet, to process the tectonic shift that had just occurred. He turned not towards the road, but towards the canal towpath, the path he had pounded into submission on a thousand pre-dawn runs.\n\nHe walked for miles, a man in a trance. The path was different from this perspective, at this time of day. It was alive with dog walkers, cheerful cyclists, and families feeding the ducks. They moved through a world of casual leisure, oblivious to the fact that they were treading on his church, his battlefield. He was an observer now, an outsider looking in. He saw a novice crew from the club out on the water, their movements clumsy and uncoordinated, their coach shouting encouragement from a bicycle. A wave of something that felt painfully like pity, both for them and for himself, washed over him. They were at the beginning of the journey he had just been ejected from. He watched them until they were out of sight, then sat on a cold stone bench, the same bench where Dave had once told him he had the makings of a champion. He stared at the slow-moving, indifferent water, the surface a murky green-brown, no longer a pristine track but just a neglected waterway cutting through the heart of the country. He had given it ten years of his life, his sweat and his soul, and it had taken it all without comment. It owed him nothing. The freedom he had felt a flicker of in Dave\u2019s office was, out here in the open, a vast, terrifying emptiness.\n\nHe ended up at Claire's, drawn by an instinct for sanctuary. She opened the door, took one look at his pale, drawn face, and her triumphant smile faltered. \"Oh, Liam,\" she said, her voice soft with a sympathy that was almost his undoing. She led him into the kitchen and made him a mug of tea so strong it could have dissolved the spoon. He told her what had happened, the words coming out in a flat, detached monotone. He told her about the black line Dave had drawn through his name, the finality of it, the cold dismissal. Claire listened, her expression hardening from sympathy to a fierce, protective anger. \"Good,\" she said, when he had finished, slamming the sugar bowl down on the table. \"Good riddance to him. And to all of it. Liam, that place was a cage, and you were too big for it. You just couldn't see it. He didn't kick you out. You outgrew him. You outgrew the whole damn sport.\" Her certainty was a comfort, a warm blanket thrown over his shivering shoulders, but it didn't quite reach the cold spot deep inside him, the place that was grieving the loss of his tribe, the death of the man he had been.\n\nThe next morning, the digital alarm on his bedside table blared its shrill, familiar summons at 5:00 a.m. For a fraction of a second, his body responded with the ingrained muscle memory of a decade. His legs tensed, his mind snapping into a state of pre-dawn readiness, already calculating the air temperature and the river conditions. Then, reality hit him like a physical blow. He didn't have to go. There was no water waiting, no boat to rig, no coach to appease. The purpose that had dragged him from his bed every morning for ten years was gone. He reached out and slapped the snooze button, but the silence that followed was more jarring than the alarm had been. It was a cavernous, empty silence, filled with the ghost of a life he no longer lived. He lay in the darkness, feeling the absence of the familiar pre-training aches in his muscles. His body felt alien, rested and unprepared for a battle that was no longer his to fight. The freedom he had chosen felt, in the stark reality of this new, unstructured dawn, like a profound and terrifying loneliness.\n\nHe eventually got up, not to row, but because lying in bed felt like a surrender. He made tea and sat in his quiet living room as the pale grey light of dawn seeped through the curtains. The house felt too big, the morning too long. The empty hours stretched before him, a vast, uncharted territory. His gaze fell on his guitar, propped in the corner. It looked less like a hobby now and more like a tool, a piece of equipment for a job he had only just started. He picked it up, the smooth wood of the neck cool and solid in his hand. He didn't play a song. He just played chords, simple, open chords, letting them ring out and fill the silence. E major. A major. G. He wasn't performing, wasn't practicing. He was just making a sound, a deliberate act of filling the void, of replacing the old rhythm with a new one. The squeak of the oarlocks was gone. The rhythmic gasp of his own breath on the water was gone. There was only this: the vibration of six steel strings against his fingertips, a small, hopeful noise in the quiet of a new day.\n\nThe official contract from the Edale festival arrived in his inbox a few days later, a stark, professional document that made it all terrifyingly real. A forty-five-minute set on the main stage. He scrolled through his phone's music library, a collection of beloved songs that now looked like a dauntingly small pool of material. He could play for fifteen, maybe twenty minutes, but forty-five? He needed more songs, more variety, more substance. He needed a band. The thought was paralyzing. He was a solitary creature, a single sculler used to the monastic discipline of training alone. The idea of collaborating, of relying on other people, of leading a group, was entirely alien. But the choice had been made, and the path led forward, not back. He thought of the open mic night, of the easy confidence of the house guitarist. Phil, the host, had called him Jamie. With a sense of leaping into the void, Liam found the number for The Rutland Arms and asked for him.\n\nHe met Jamie in a different pub, a musician's haunt in the centre of Sheffield with sticky floors and a jukebox full of classic rock. Jamie was younger than him by at least ten years, with bright, intelligent eyes and the restless energy of someone whose fingers were always itching to play. Liam, feeling like a giant in the small, crowded room, explained the situation, the words feeling clunky and inadequate. He felt like a fraud, a rower playing dress-up in a musician's world. But Jamie listened with an infectious enthusiasm, his eyes lighting up when Liam mentioned Edale. \"Mate, that's huge! Their main stage is legendary. So, you need a band?\" Liam nodded, feeling a blush creep up his neck. \"I don't know the first thing about it.\" Jamie grinned, a wide, easy smile. \"Don't worry about that. That's the easy part. I know a rhythm section that's tighter than a submarine door. A bassist, Steve, and a drummer, Chloe. They're amazing. We've been looking for a proper singer, someone with real pipes, not another indie kid mumbling into his fringe.\" The casual compliment landed with surprising force. *A proper singer.* It was a validation from a world he was desperate to belong to. \"Let's have a jam,\" Jamie said, pulling a notebook from his pocket. \"Let's see what we can build.\"\n\nTheir first rehearsal was in a dingy, soundproofed room above a Sheffield pub, a space that smelled of stale beer, old carpets, and electricity. It was chaotic and loud. Chloe, the drummer, sat behind a battered kit, a whirlwind of focused energy, while Steve, the bassist, stood quietly, a calm anchor in the sonic storm, his fingers dancing effortlessly on the fretboard. Liam felt utterly out of his depth. He was used to silence and solitude, to the clean, straight lines of a race course. This was a messy, collaborative art, a conversation shouted in a language of chords and drum fills. They tried 'Try a Little Tenderness' first, and it was a train wreck. Liam was used to singing it with a polished house band that followed his lead; this was different. This was a negotiation. They stopped and started, the song falling apart as they struggled to find a common rhythm. Liam felt a surge of panic, a feeling of total incompetence. But Jamie just laughed. \"Alright, let's take it from the build-up. Chloe, watch him. He sings like a boxer. Follow his breathing.\" They tried again. Jamie hit the chords, Chloe came in with a thunderous, rolling fill, and Steve locked into a groove that was a solid, pulsing heartbeat. Liam took a breath and sang, and this time, the band was with him. They weren't just backing him; they were lifting him, pushing him, answering his vocal lines with their own musical declarations. He felt the raw power of it, a force far greater than his own, a surge of energy that was like catching a perfect stroke with three other rowers in perfect sync. It was a different kind of boat, a different kind of crew, but the feeling of shared, explosive power was the same.\n\nHe drove home from the rehearsal late that night, his ears ringing and his throat raw from pushing his voice over the joyful noise of a full band. The Biscuit Tin\u2019s radio was off, the silence a welcome relief. He was tired, but it was a new kind of tired, a creative exhaustion that buzzed with energy rather than leaden fatigue. He pulled over at his usual vantage point, the quiet lane overlooking the sleeping town. For weeks, this spot had been a place of turmoil and difficult decisions. Tonight, it felt different. He looked out at the familiar pattern of orange streetlights and dark rooftops, the crooked spire a steadfast silhouette against a starry sky. He thought of the rowing club, of Dave, of the black line through his name. The ache of that loss was still there, a faint, phantom limb of a past life. But it was no longer the dominant feeling. It was being replaced by the thrill of the new, the terror and excitement of the path he was now on. He was no longer a rower mourning his past. He was a singer, and he had a festival to prepare for. He had a band to lead. He put the car in gear and drove towards home, a new set of rhythms playing in his head, a new set of proving grounds waiting.The weeks leading up to the Edale festival took on a rhythm of their own, a vibrant, chaotic cadence that was a world away from the metronomic precision of his rowing life. Liam\u2019s mornings were no longer defined by the shrill scream of a 5 a.m. alarm and the cold shock of canal water. He still rose early, the discipline of a decade too deeply ingrained to abandon, but his purpose had shifted. Instead of the towpath, he took to the trails of the Linacre Woods, running not against a stopwatch but for the simple, burning pleasure of it, his lungs expanding, his heart hammering out a steady beat. He was still an athlete, but his body was no longer just an engine for propulsion; it was an instrument he was learning to tune for a different kind of endurance, the stamina to hold a note, to command a stage, to give a forty-five-minute performance his all. He ran with music in his headphones, not as a distraction, but as a study, dissecting arrangements, internalising rhythms, his mind a constant, buzzing workshop of musical ideas.\n\nThe rehearsal space above the pub became their boathouse, their proving ground. It was a cramped, stuffy room that perpetually smelled of the ghosts of spilled beer and forgotten cigarettes, the walls covered in egg cartons that did a questionable job of soundproofing. But within those four walls, a kind of magic began to happen. The initial chaos of four musicians trying to find a common language slowly coalesced into a dynamic, a conversation. Liam, used to the clear, hierarchical structure of a rowing squad, struggled at first with the messy democracy of a band. He found it difficult to articulate the sounds he heard in his head, often falling back on the only vocabulary he had. \u201cIt needs more\u2026 drive here,\u201d he\u2019d say, gesturing with his hands. \u201cLike the beginning of the stroke, that first big leg push.\u201d Jamie, ever the enthusiastic translator, would grin. \u201cYou mean you want the bass and drums to really lean into the downbeat? Hit it hard?\u201d And Chloe, from behind her fortress of cymbals, would unleash a thunderous fill that was exactly the right kind of power, making Liam break into a grateful smile.\n\nThey built their setlist piece by piece, an exercise in shared archaeology, digging up classic soul and R&B gems and breathing new life into them. They transformed Wilson Pickett\u2019s \u2018In the Midnight Hour\u2019 into a gritty, blues-stomp, and found a swampy, menacing groove in Bill Withers\u2019 \u2018Who Is He (And What Is He to You)?\u2019. Steve, the quiet bassist, proved to be their secret weapon, a walking encyclopaedia of music who would suggest a subtle chord change or a different bassline that would unlock an entire song. But their biggest breakthrough came not from a cover, but from a moment of pure, unplanned creation. During a break, while Liam was sipping a bottle of water, Jamie started playing a simple, melancholic guitar riff, a phrase that felt like a question mark hanging in the dusty air. Without thinking, Liam began to hum along, a low, soulful melody taking shape over the chords. The words that emerged were simple, drawn from the landscape of his old life. *\u201cWater like glass, a grey morning sky\u2026 another mile to go before the sun gets high\u2026\u201d*\n\nThe room fell silent. Jamie\u2019s fingers stilled on the strings. Chloe and Steve looked at him, their expressions a mixture of surprise and intense interest. \"What was that, mate?\" Jamie asked, his voice soft. Liam felt a hot blush of self-consciousness, the feeling of having been caught in a private moment. \"Nothing. Just messing about,\" he mumbled, turning back to his water. \"No,\" Steve said, his quiet voice cutting through the awkwardness. \"That was something. Play the riff again, Jamie.\" Jamie obliged, and this time, Liam, nudged by their expectant silence, sang the lines again, his voice hesitant at first, then growing in confidence. Chloe joined in with a soft, subtle beat on the ride cymbal, a gentle pulse like a distant train. Steve added a low, looping bassline that gave the melody an anchor. It wasn't a song yet. It was a sketch, a feeling, a fragment of a new story. But it was *his*. For the first time, he wasn't just interpreting someone else's truth; he was beginning to articulate his own. They worked on it for an hour, building a structure, finding a chorus, the music flowing from a place of genuine, collaborative excitement. They called it 'Canal Song'.\n\nThe world outside the rehearsal room continued to turn, and one Saturday afternoon, while loading groceries into the boot of Claire\u2019s car, Liam saw a familiar figure jogging towards him. It was Mark, his old rowing partner, his face leaner and more strained than Liam remembered. The encounter was awkward, a meeting of ghosts from different timelines. \"Liam! Blimey, didn't recognise you without an oar in your hand,\" Mark panted, slowing to a stop. \"Heard you're a rock star now. How's it going?\" The question was friendly, but tinged with a curiosity that felt like a probe. \"It's going alright,\" Liam said, leaning against the car. \"We're playing Edale in a few weeks.\" \"Edale, right,\" Mark nodded, his eyes flicking away. \"We're at Henley next weekend. Dave's got us on a brutal schedule. Killing us. We could have used your weight in the eight.\" The words hung in the air, a casual statement that landed like a small, sharp stone. A pang of guilt, of nostalgia for the simple camaraderie of the crew, hit Liam unexpectedly. \"Good luck,\" Liam said, and was surprised by the sincerity in his own voice. \"I hope you win.\" Mark gave him a strange look, a mixture of gratitude and confusion. \"Cheers, mate. You too. Break a leg, or whatever it is you lot say.\" He jogged off, leaving Liam standing in the supermarket car park, feeling the last, fraying thread connecting him to his old life finally snap.\n\nThe final rehearsal before the festival was less a practice and more a declaration of intent. They ran through the entire forty-five-minute set, from the explosive opening of 'Hold On, I'm Comin'' to the quiet, soulful encore of 'Canal Song'. They were no longer four separate musicians; they were a single entity, a tight, powerful unit that breathed and moved as one. They crashed through the final chords of their last song, the sound ringing out in the small, sweaty room, and ended in a sudden, breathless silence. They looked at each other, grinning, exhausted, and united by the shared, electric thrill of creation. They had done the work. They had found their sound. They were a band. \"Well,\" Jamie said, wiping sweat from his brow with the back of his hand. \"I reckon we're ready to scare some folk singers.\" Liam laughed, a deep, easy sound of pure joy. He felt a familiar ache in his muscles and a satisfying rawness in his throat. It was the feeling of having given everything, of having left it all on the floor. He was ready. He was no longer a rower who sang, or a singer who used to row. He was Liam Kenna, and he had a festival to play.The air in the Hope Valley tasted different. It was cleaner, sharper, scented with wild thyme, damp earth, and the distant, enticing aroma of woodsmoke and fried onions. Gone was the familiar, brackish tang of the canal; this was the air of mountains and open spaces, of freedom and possibility. The Edale festival was not just an event; it was a temporary, sprawling city of canvas and colour, pitched in a vast green bowl of a valley and thrumming with a bohemian, life-affirming energy. Colourful flags snapped in the breeze, and the low, rolling thunder of a distant soundcheck mixed with the laughter of children and the gentle cadence of a hundred different conversations. Liam, navigating the crowded, slightly muddy pathways with his bandmates, felt a world away from the manicured lawns and rigid etiquette of a regatta. This was a gathering of tribes, but the uniforms were tie-dye and worn denim, not lycra and club blazers, and the competition was a joyful battle of melodies, not a grim war of attrition against a stopwatch.\n\nThey made their way to the main stage, a colossal structure of steel scaffolding and black canvas that seemed to have landed from another planet in the middle of the picturesque valley. It was far bigger than Liam had imagined, a huge, yawning mouth that would soon demand to be filled with sound. Standing at the side of it, looking out at the empty field where thousands of people would soon gather, he felt a familiar, cold spike of fear, a dizzying sense of vertigo. But it was different from the solitary terror of the Voice of the Peaks final. He wasn't alone. Jamie clapped him on the shoulder, a wide, excited grin on his face. \u201cBit bigger than The Rutland, eh?\u201d Chloe was methodically taping her fingers, her expression one of intense, professional focus, while Steve was quietly tuning his bass, a small, calm smile on his lips. They were a crew, facing their Henley, and the shared sense of purpose was a powerful anchor against the rising tide of his nerves.\n\nBackstage was a controlled, friendly chaos. Roadies in black t-shirts moved with practiced efficiency, coiling cables and checking microphones. Seasoned musicians with faces like road maps and guitars that bore the scars of a thousand gigs nodded a hello as they passed. There was no glitter, no hairspray, just a deep, unspoken respect for the craft. Liam found his family huddled by a catering tent, looking slightly overwhelmed but thrilled. Leo was staring, wide-eyed, at a man with a beard down to his chest who was playing a mandolin. Claire hugged him tightly, her nervous energy a vibrating current. \u201cYou okay? You\u2019re not going to be sick, are you?\u201d she whispered fiercely. Liam shook his head, a smile touching his lips. And then he saw his dad, standing slightly apart from the backstage bustle, holding a plastic cup of tea and looking distinctly out of place in his sensible slacks and clean windbreaker. He looked at Liam, then at the huge, empty stage, then back again. He didn\u2019t offer words of encouragement. He just held out a bottle of water he\u2019d been keeping for him. \u201cYou\u2019ll be needing this,\u201d was all he said. Liam took it, their hands brushing, the simple, practical gesture a more profound expression of support than any speech could have been.\n\nThe forty-five minutes before their set was a blur. They were led to the stage by a cheerful woman with a clipboard. The field was no longer empty; it was a vast, sprawling sea of humanity, a kaleidoscope of picnic blankets, camping chairs, and expectant faces under the bright afternoon sun. This was no darkened auditorium where the audience was an anonymous void. He could see them. He could see their faces, their expressions of curiosity, their smiles. There was nowhere to hide. He took his place at the centre microphone, the stage feeling as wide as a football pitch. He glanced back at Chloe, who gave him a sharp, confident nod. To his left, Steve gave him a thumbs-up. To his right, Jamie grinned, hit a single, loud, defiant chord on his guitar, and the sound exploded from the giant speakers, a declaration that they had arrived. And then Chloe\u2019s drums kicked in, a thunderous, irresistible beat, and they launched into the explosive opening of \u2018Hold On, I\u2019m Comin\u2019\u2019.\n\nFor the first few moments, Liam was just a passenger, carried along by the sheer power of the band. The sound was immense, a physical force that vibrated through the floorboards of the stage and into the soles of his feet. He opened his mouth and let his voice ride on top of it, a raw, joyful roar that felt like a release of every ounce of pent-up energy and anxiety he possessed. He saw the crowd react, saw their heads turn, saw a ripple of surprise and interest spread through the field. He saw people who had been lying on their blankets sit up, their attention captured. He wasn't just a big man with a surprisingly soulful voice anymore; he was the frontman of a tight, powerful, blues-drenched rock and roll band, and they were a force to be reckoned with. They crashed through the first two songs, a high-octane medley that demanded a physical response, and by the third song, a slinky, groove-laden version of \u2018Who Is He (And What Is He to You)?\u2019, a space had opened up at the front of the crowd, and people were dancing, a fluid, joyful mass moving to the rhythm they were creating.\n\nHe felt himself relax into it, the performance becoming a conversation, not a test. He moved with the music, feeding off the energy of his bandmates, catching Jamie\u2019s eye and grinning as the guitarist unleashed a blistering solo. He watched Chloe, a blur of motion and concentration, driving the beat forward with a ferocious intensity. He felt Steve\u2019s bassline, a solid, unshakeable foundation that allowed him the freedom to soar. They were a single, living organism, speaking a language of pure, unfiltered emotion. And then, it was time. The high-energy songs faded, and a quiet anticipation settled over the field. Jamie switched to his acoustic guitar, playing the simple, questioning riff they had discovered in the rehearsal room. Liam stepped closer to the microphone, the vast crowd seeming to lean in as one. \u201cThis is a new song,\u201d he said, his voice quiet but carrying across the field. \u201cIt\u2019s one of ours. It\u2019s about the place I\u2019m from, and the life I used to know. It\u2019s called \u2018Canal Song\u2019.\u201d\n\nHe sang, and the story of his old life, of the grey dawns and the silent, solitary work, filled the warm summer air of the Hope Valley. The lyrics were a watercolour painting of a world he had left behind, full of images of tearing silk and misty mornings, of aching muscles and the relentless rhythm of the stroke. He sang not with regret, but with a deep, tender understanding, a farewell to the man he had been. The crowd fell utterly silent, a field of thousands holding a collective breath. They weren\u2019t just listening to a song; they were hearing a confession, a testimony, a story of transformation. In the quietest moments of the song, the only sound was his voice, the gentle strum of the guitar, and the whisper of the wind in the festival banners. He was laying his soul bare, not in a theatre under the glare of competitive lights, but in a field, under an open sky, in front of a community of strangers. It was the most honest thing he had ever done.\n\nWhen the final, gentle chord faded into the afternoon air, the silence held for a beat, a moment of profound, shared resonance. Then, the applause came. It wasn\u2019t the explosive, percussive roar of the TV final. It was a wave, a swell of deep, heartfelt appreciation that grew and grew, washing over the stage. He saw Eleanor Vance at the side of the stage, her arms crossed, a small, profound smile on her face. They finished their set with a triumphant, joyful rendition of \u2018Lovely Day\u2019, the entire field singing the chorus back at him, their voices joining his in a huge, harmonious choir. He walked off stage, his legs trembling, his shirt soaked through with sweat, his throat raw, and fell into the waiting, triumphant hugs of his band. They had done it. They had flown.\n\nLater, he stood in the middle of the crowd with his family, just another face in the sea of festival-goers, watching another band on the main stage. The setting sun painted the clouds in shades of pink and orange, the same colours he used to see mirrored on the surface of the canal at dawn. Leo was asleep on his shoulder, a small, warm weight of pure contentment. Claire was leaning against him, her face glowing with happiness. His dad stood beside him, holding a plastic cup of beer, watching the band on stage with a look of quiet concentration. During a break in the music, his dad turned to him. He didn't speak. He just looked at Liam, a long, searching look, and then he raised his plastic cup in a small, almost imperceptible toast. It was a gesture of acknowledgement, of respect, of a quiet, hard-won pride. Liam raised his own bottle of water in return, a silent understanding passing between them. Miles away, in the manicured grounds of Henley-on-Thames, boats were being racked, medals were being awarded, and a life he once thought was his everything was concluding without him. He felt no loss, no regret. He was here, in a field in Derbyshire, surrounded by his family and a new tribe, his ears ringing with music, his heart full. He had found his finish line. It wasn't a line on the water. It was a stage, a song, and a new, wide-open horizon.",

                                        "text": "The blade sliced the water with a sound like tearing silk, a clean rip in the morning's silence. Liam pulled, his whole body a coiled spring releasing its tension in one fluid, powerful motion. The scull, a fragile needle of carbon fibre, surged forward across the Chesterfield Canal. Dawn was a rumour of pale grey and pink staining the eastern sky, and the air held the raw, damp chill of a Derbyshire spring. Mist clung to the water's surface in lazy drifts, shrouding the banks and turning the distant, iconic twist of the crooked spire into a ghostly smudge on the horizon. Out here, there was only the rhythm. The catch, the drive, the finish, the recovery. The rhythmic gasp of his own breath. The squeak of the oarlocks. For ten years, this had been his sanctuary, his church, his proving ground. The water didn't care about your day job or your family troubles; it only cared about power, technique, and endurance.\n\nBut this morning, another rhythm fought for purchase in his mind. A melody. A simple, soulful hook from an old Sam Cooke tune that had snagged in his brain and refused to let go. He found himself humming it on the recovery, a low baritone rumble in his chest that was lost to the wind. The song was a secret, a small, warm thing he carried inside him. Rowing was for his body, for the sinew and muscle he had spent a decade building. Singing was for whatever was left over. It was the part of him that didn't fit the mould of a six-foot-three, fourteen-stone athlete who could pull a two-kilometre erg test in a time that made other men weep. It was a secret garden he tended to in the shower, in his car, and on the rare Tuesday nights he had the courage to go to the open mic at The Rutland Arms.\n\nHe let the boat glide, the hiss of the hull on the water slowing as he sat up, wiping a bead of sweat from his brow with the back of his wrist. He pulled his phone from its waterproof pouch. The screen was cold against his thumb. He opened the email again, for what must have been the twentieth time since it had arrived last night. The subject line still gave him a jolt, a fizz of something that felt dangerously like hope.\n\n*Subject: Voice of the Peaks - Grand Final Confirmation*\n\n*Dear Liam Kenna,*\n*Following your incredible performance in the semi-final, we are absolutely delighted to invite you to compete in the Grand Final of Voice of the Peaks 2024...*\n\nIt was real. The words hadn't rearranged themselves overnight into a rejection. He, Liam Kenna, the quiet lad from Whittington Moor who spent most of his life going backwards down a canal, was in the final of a proper singing competition. Not just a pub karaoke night with a prize of a gallon of ale, but a real, televised-on-a-local-channel, sponsored-by-a-regional-car-dealership competition. The thought was so absurd, so far removed from the cold reality of his aching quads and blistered hands, that he almost laughed out loud. He\u2019d entered on a whim, egged on by his sister, Claire, after she\u2019d filmed him on her phone singing at a family barbecue. He\u2019d sent in the grainy video of him murdering\u2014or so he thought\u2014Otis Redding\u2019s \u2018(Sittin' On) The Dock of the Bay\u2019, and somehow, against all odds, they\u2019d invited him to an audition.\n\nThe early rounds had been a blur of nervous energy. He\u2019d stood backstage in his borrowed suit, feeling like a bear in a doll's house amongst the slender, confident drama school kids and the seasoned pub singers with their worn-out guitars. Then he\u2019d walked on stage, the lights hot on his face, and opened his mouth. And the voice that came out always surprised him. It was deeper, richer, than his speaking voice, a resonant sound that seemed to come from the soles of his feet. It felt like the only time he was ever truly expressing the entirety of himself. The judges, a panel of local radio DJs and a former West End performer who\u2019d retired to the Peak District, had been visibly taken aback. \u2018Where did *that* voice come from, young man?\u2019 one of them had asked, peering at him over her glasses as if he were some sort of geological anomaly.\n\n\"He's here. The phantom of the canal.\"\n\nLiam jolted, nearly dropping his phone in the water. Dave, his coach, was standing on the towpath, arms crossed over his chest, his stocky frame silhouetted against the brightening sky. His face, weathered and perpetually unimpressed, was fixed on Liam.\n\n\"Daydreaming, Kenna? Or admiring your reflection?\" Dave's voice was gravelly, a product of too many years of shouting encouragement through a megaphone into the wind.\n\n\"Just checking the time, coach,\" Liam lied, quickly stowing the phone. He grabbed the oars, his knuckles white.\n\n\"The time is 'time to put some bloody work in',\" Dave grunted. \"Your splits for that last five hundred were lazy. Your head's not in the boat. The Northern Regatta is in three weeks. Manchester will eat you alive if you're pulling like that. I want three sets of five-hundred-metre sprints. And I want to see the water churn.\"\n\nLiam nodded, his jaw tight. \"Yes, coach.\"\n\nHe didn't argue. You didn't argue with Dave. The man had coached rowers to national championships. He lived and breathed the sport, and he expected the same monastic devotion from his top athletes. He would not, Liam knew, understand a singing competition. To Dave, anything that wasn't geared towards making the boat go faster was a frivolous, pointless distraction. A weakness.\n\nAs he turned the scull and paddled back to his starting point, the conflict churned inside him, a messy counter-rhythm to the smooth mechanics of the stroke. Rowing was his life, the bedrock of his identity. It had given him discipline, strength, a community. He owed everything to it, and to Dave. But the singing\u2026 the singing was a new, thrilling discovery. It was a door opening into a room in his own house that he never knew existed. The Grand Final was in Sheffield, at the City Hall, in two weeks\u2019 time. Two weeks. He had to choose a song, practice, figure out what to wear. He had to drive there. His car, a battered fifteen-year-old Ford Fiesta he\u2019d nicknamed \u2018The Biscuit Tin\u2019 for its tendency to rattle, would have to be coaxed into making the journey over the moors.\n\nHe took a deep breath, the cold air burning his lungs. For now, he would row. He would make the water churn for Dave. He would give the canal the power it demanded. But as he coiled his body for the first sprint, it wasn't the thought of the finish line at the regatta that spurred him on. It was the memory of the stage lights, the hush of the crowd, and the first, terrifying, wonderful note of a song taking flight.\n\nThe boathouse smelled of damp lycra, river water, and industrial floor cleaner. It was a familiar, comforting smell to Liam, the scent of hard work and belonging. He racked his boat with the practiced ease of long habit, his muscles humming with the pleasant ache of exertion. Other members of the club were arriving now, a trickle of bodies in brightly coloured technical gear, their voices echoing in the cavernous space.\n\n\"Morning, Liam. Good session?\" It was Mark, another single sculler, a wiry accountant who rowed with a ferocious intensity that belied his day job.\n\n\"Morning. Yeah, not bad,\" Liam replied, towelling his hair dry. \"Dave was on the warpath, as usual.\"\n\nMark chuckled. \"Tells you he cares. When he stops shouting, that\u2019s when you need to worry.\" He paused, lowering his voice slightly. \"Heard a rumour on the club WhatsApp. Something about you being on the telly?\"\n\nLiam felt a hot blush creep up his neck. He\u2019d hoped to keep it quiet for a bit longer, to let the idea settle in his own mind before it became club gossip. But news, like water, always found a way to leak out. \"Ah. Yeah. Sort of. Local telly, maybe.\"\n\nMark's eyes widened. \"Don't be modest, mate! The Voice of the Peaks! My missus loves that show. She said there was a big lad from Chesterfield who sang like an angel. Didn't realise it was you! That's brilliant! What are you gonna sing in the final?\"\n\nThe question hung in the air. Liam hadn't even let himself think that far ahead. The pressure of it suddenly felt immense. \"Not sure yet. Got to pick something.\"\n\n\"Well, whatever it is, you'll smash it,\" Mark said, clapping him on the shoulder with a wet hand. \"Just don't forget us little people when you're famous.\"\n\nThe encounter left Liam feeling strangely exposed. The two halves of his life, the rower and the singer, were beginning to collide, and he wasn't sure how to manage the impact. He finished changing in a haze, nodding and murmuring vague pleasantries to his clubmates, all the while feeling their curious glances. He was no longer just Liam Kenna, the club's strongest sculler. He was a novelty. The Singing Rower.\n\nHe escaped the boathouse and got into The Biscuit Tin. The engine turned over with a phlegmy cough and a shudder that vibrated through the driver\u2019s seat. The dashboard lit up like a Christmas tree with warning lights that he\u2019d long since learned to ignore. As long as the oil light and the engine temperature light stayed off, he considered it a victory. He pulled out of the car park, the radio crackling to life. A generic pop song filled the small car. He turned it off. He needed to think.\n\nDriving through the familiar streets of Chesterfield, past the market stalls being set up and the morning commuters heading to the train station, he felt a disconnect. This was his world. Solid, predictable, real. The singing competition felt like a dream he was having, and he was terrified of waking up. What if he made a fool of himself? What if he got on that big stage and his voice cracked? What if the judges who had been so kind before were suddenly critical? The fear was a cold knot in his stomach, a stark contrast to the elation he'd felt just a few hours earlier. Rowing had taught him to manage physical pain and exhaustion, but this... this was different. This was a fear of failure that was purely about his soul.\n\nHe pulled up outside his small terraced house. His sister\u2019s car was parked outside. Claire must have dropped off her son, Leo, for him to look after while she was at work. Liam smiled. Leo, his seven-year-old nephew, would be a welcome distraction. The boy lived entirely in the moment, his world a whirlwind of Lego, football, and endless questions.\n\nHe opened the front door to the immediate assault of a small, human hurricane.\n\n\"Uncle Liam! You promised we could go to the park! And you said you'd show me your medals again! Did you win today? Did you beat everyone? Mum said you're going to be a pop star!\"\n\nLeo was already dressed in a full, slightly-too-large football kit, and was bouncing on the balls of his feet with an energy Liam envied. Claire was in the kitchen, making toast. She was two years older than Liam, a primary school teacher with a practical, no-nonsense attitude, but with the same kind eyes as their late mother.\n\n\"Morning, superstar,\" she said, grinning at him. \"Surviving the hype?\"\n\nLiam grunted, ruffling Leo\u2019s hair. \"Barely. Mark at the club already knows. I feel like a prize pig at a country fair.\"\n\n\"Get used to it,\" Claire said, handing him a mug of tea. \"I put it on the school's parent Facebook group. The whole of Brampton is rooting for you.\"\n\n\"You what?\" Liam choked on his tea. \"Claire! Why would you do that?\"\n\n\"Because I'm proud of you, you big idiot!\" she retorted, her expression softening. \"For years, all you've done is that bloody rowing. Up at five every morning, protein shakes, blisters, aches and pains. You never do anything just for fun. This is for fun. And you're brilliant at it. You need to let yourself enjoy it.\"\n\n\"It's not just for fun anymore, is it?\" Liam said, his voice quiet. \"It's the final. There's a prize. People are... watching.\"\n\nClaire came and put an arm around his broad shoulders. \"Listen to me. You've been singing since you were Leo's age. Mum used to say you sang before you could talk properly. You used to stand on that hearth, remember? Using the TV remote as a microphone, singing along to her Dusty Springfield records. Her heart would have burst seeing you on that stage.\"\n\nThe mention of their mum struck a chord deep inside him. She had been the music in their house. After she\u2019d passed away from cancer five years ago, the house had fallen silent in more ways than one. His dad, a man of few words at the best of times, had retreated further into himself. For Liam, singing the old songs they\u2019d shared had become a way of keeping her close, a private conversation with her memory. Maybe that\u2019s what this was all about.\n\n\"Just\u2026 don't let Dave from the rowing club find out,\" Liam mumbled into his mug.\n\nClaire laughed, a bright, clear sound. \"Oh, he'll be fine. Might do him good to realise there's more to life than messing about in boats. Now,\" she said, turning her attention to her son, \"Leo, be good for your uncle. No breaking anything expensive. And Liam,\" she fixed him with a mock-serious glare, \"you need to pick a song for the final. A proper showstopper. No sad ballads. Something that'll get them on their feet.\"\n\nAs she left for work, leaving a trail of perfume and cheerful chaos in her wake, Liam was left alone with his nephew and his thoughts. A showstopper. The words echoed in his head. He looked around the small living room, at the mantelpiece crowded with rowing trophies and a single, faded photograph of his smiling mother. He had two weeks to become a showman. Two weeks to bridge the chasm between the silent, powerful man in the boat and the soulful singer he was only just beginning to know. The prospect was, in a word, terrifying. And in another, completely and utterly exhilarating."

                                        "text": "The silence that followed Claire's departure was immediately filled by Leo, who began using the living room rug as a makeshift football pitch, commentating on his own imaginary game in a breathless whisper. \"And Kenna shoots... he scores! The crowd goes wild!\" Liam watched him, a faint smile on his lips. He sank into the worn armchair, the springs groaning in protest under his weight. His body felt heavy, anchored by fatigue, but his mind was a frantic buzz of conflicting demands. The regatta. The final. Dave's gravelly voice. Claire's cheerful encouragement. His mother\u2019s smile. It was too much.\n\n\"Can we see the medals now?\" Leo abandoned his game, skidding to a halt by the arm of the chair and looking up at him with wide, pleading eyes. \"Please? The shiny ones.\"\n\n\"Alright, alright, you little monster,\" Liam sighed, heaving himself up. It was a familiar ritual. He opened the glass-fronted cabinet where his prizes were kept. Dozens of them, mostly gold and silver, hung from ribbons or stood on small wooden plinths. He took down the heaviest, a gold medal from the National Championships two years prior. \"This one's from when we won the coxless fours,\" he explained, placing the cool, heavy metal in Leo\u2019s small hands. The boy\u2019s eyes were round with awe. \"It was the hardest race I've ever done. It was raining so hard you could barely see the finish line, and my hands were so raw I could feel the oar through the blisters.\" He spoke of the race with a detached reverence, as if describing a natural disaster he had survived. This, he understood. The pain, the burn, the reward. It was a simple, brutal equation.\n\nLeo traced the embossed crest on the medal. \"Is being a pop star harder than this?\" he asked, his voice full of genuine curiosity. Liam was taken aback. He looked from the medal in Leo\u2019s hand\u2014a tangible record of a decade of gruelling, single-minded effort\u2014to the memory of the stage, a fleeting, terrifying, thirty-minute blur.\n\n\"I don't know, mate,\" he said honestly. \"It's\u2026 different.\" He put the medal away, the click of the cabinet door sounding unnervingly final. \"In a race, you know what you've got to do. You pull as hard as you can. If you're strong enough and your technique's good enough, you win. On stage\u2026 you can do everything right and people still might not like it. It\u2019s not about how strong you are.\"\n\n\"But they do like it! Mum said you made Mrs. Higgins from next door cry, but in a good way,\" Leo insisted. \"What song are you going to sing? Is it the one about the boat?\" He meant '(Sittin' On) The Dock of the Bay'. Liam shook his head. \"No, Claire's right. It needs to be something\u2026 bigger. A showstopper.\" The word felt foreign and ridiculous in his mouth. He wasn't a showman; he was a sculler. He moved backwards to go forwards. He faced away from where he was going. His entire sporting life was an exercise in quiet, introverted propulsion.\n\nHe sat back down and scrolled through his phone's music library, a curated collection of soul, blues, and old-school R&B that was a world away from the aggressive punk and rock that fuelled his teammates' workouts. He needed something that had power but also vulnerability. Something that could build, that could tell a story. He skimmed past Al Green, past Bill Withers. Then his thumb hovered over an album cover. Otis Redding again. But not the gentle melancholy of 'Dock of the Bay'. He tapped on 'Try a Little Tenderness'.\n\nThe song started soft and gentle, a simple declaration. Liam closed his eyes, listening. He knew every inflection, every breath. Then came the build. The horns kicking in, the tempo increasing, Redding\u2019s voice cracking with raw, pleading emotion, building and building until it became a volcanic eruption of pure soul. It wasn't just a song; it was a three-and-a-half-minute emotional storm. It was technically demanding, vocally athletic, and utterly exposing. It was, he realised with a jolt of fear and excitement, a showstopper. It was perfect.\n\n\"Oh, young woman, they're so sweet...\" he sang quietly, just under his breath, his deep voice barely a murmur. Leo's head popped up. \"Sing it louder!\" he demanded. Liam glanced at the closed curtains, a habitual secrecy taking over. But then he looked at his nephew\u2019s expectant face, and at the photo of his mother on the mantelpiece, and something inside him loosened. He took a breath and sang the line again, this time letting his voice fill the small room. It felt good. It felt right. By the time he reached the explosive final section, he was on his feet, using a rolled-up magazine as a microphone, belting out the \"Got to, got to, got to!\" part with a passion that made Leo whoop with delight and start dancing around the coffee table. For a moment, he wasn't Liam the Rower or Liam the Finalist. He was just a man singing in his living room, his heart full, sharing a moment of pure, unadulterated joy with the small boy who idolised him. The music faded, leaving him breathless, his chest heaving, a wide grin spreading across his face. This was what Claire meant. This was for fun. This was for him. This was for her."

                                        "text": "The euphoria of the living room performance evaporated in the harsh fluorescent light of the club\u2019s gym. The next few days fell into a brutal, familiar pattern. Pre-dawn sessions on the water, followed by punishing workouts on the rowing machines in the evening. The ergometer became his penitent's stool. He would strap his feet in, set the monitor for a two-thousand-metre piece, and pull. The fan whirred like a jet engine, the chain rattled, and the digital numbers on the screen became his entire world: split time, stroke rate, power output. But now, the machine had a soundtrack. The slow, soulful intro of \u2018Try a Little Tenderness\u2019 timed itself perfectly to his warm-up strokes. The explosive, desperate pleading of the song\u2019s climax became the internal roar that accompanied his final sprint, his legs burning with lactic acid, his vision tunnelling.\n\nDave watched him like a hawk. The coach would stand with his arms crossed, his gaze flicking between Liam's strained face and the unforgiving numbers on the monitor. He didn\u2019t say much, which was more unnerving than his usual bellowing. He\u2019d just circle the machine, his presence a heavy weight, occasionally tapping the screen. \u201cPower\u2019s fluctuating, Kenna. Your drive is inconsistent. One stroke you\u2019re a god, the next you\u2019re a tourist on a pedalo. Where\u2019s your head at?\u201d Liam, gasping for air, his throat raw, could only shake his head and try to focus. But focusing meant choosing one rhythm over the other, and his mind refused to cooperate. The rower and the singer were at war, and his body was the battlefield.\n\nAfter one particularly gruelling session, where his final five-hundred-metre split was two seconds slower than his personal best, Dave followed him to the water fountain. \"Alright, Liam. Out with it.\" The coach\u2019s voice was low, devoid of its usual bluster. It was the voice he used for serious conversations, the one that could cut through any excuse. \"Something's off. You're strong, you're fit, but you're not here.\" He tapped his own temple. \"You're somewhere else. Family okay? Work?\"\n\nLiam let the cold water run over his hands, stalling. This was the moment. The moment to tell him, to explain the absurd, wonderful, terrifying thing that had happened. But the words wouldn't form. He pictured Dave's face, the inevitable dismissal, the disappointment. To Dave, this would be a betrayal of everything they had worked for. It would be a weakness. \"Just tired, coach,\" he mumbled, not meeting his eye. \"Not sleeping well.\"\n\nDave let out a long, slow breath, a sigh of profound frustration. \"Well, you'd better get it sorted. The regatta is everything we've aimed for this season. To make sure you\u2019re ready, I've booked the senior squad into a full immersion training camp at Holme Pierrepont. Starts Friday next week. We drive down after work. Two solid days. No phones, no family, no distractions. Just us, the water, and the work. I need your head completely in the boat, son. Completely.\"\n\nThe words hit Liam like a physical blow. Friday next week. The Grand Final was on the Saturday. In Sheffield. Holme Pierrepont was in Nottingham, a good hour's drive away in the wrong direction. The carefully constructed wall separating his two lives had just been demolished by a wrecking ball. He felt a wave of nausea. He just nodded dumbly, the lie he\u2019d told moments before trapping him. \"Yeah. Okay, coach. Sounds good.\"\n\nThe drive home in The Biscuit Tin was a journey through a fog of panic. The conflict was no longer a philosophical one; it was a logistical nightmare. He couldn't be in two places at once. He couldn't serve two masters, especially not when one was as demanding as Dave and the other was as seductive as a sold-out auditorium. He parked on a quiet lane overlooking the town, the crooked spire just visible through the dusk, and killed the engine. He pulled out his phone and played the Otis Redding track. He tried to sing along, to find that soaring power he\u2019d discovered in his living room. But his throat was tight, constricted by anxiety. The notes that had flown so freely were now caged in his chest, weak and breathless. He wasn't a showstopper. He was a fraud who was about to let everyone down.\n\nHe didn't go home. Instead, he drove straight to Claire's house on the other side of town. He found her in the garden, patiently trying to untangle a set of solar-powered fairy lights while Leo directed her from a small plastic chair. She took one look at his face and set the tangled mess down. \"Oh dear,\" she said. \"That's your 'world-is-ending' face. I haven't seen that since you accidentally snapped one of Dave's precious carbon-fibre oars.\"\n\nIn a torrent of words, he explained the situation. The training camp. Dave\u2019s ultimatum. The impossibility of it all. \"I have to choose,\" he finished, slumping onto the garden bench. \"And I don't know how. If I miss the camp, I'm letting the whole squad down. Dave will probably kick me out of the first boat. My season will be over. But if I don't go to the final...\" He trailed off, unable to voice the alternative. To give up on the singing felt like cutting out a part of himself.\n\nClaire listened, her brow furrowed in concentration. She picked up a stray football and bounced it on her knee, a habit she had when she was thinking hard. \"Right,\" she said finally, her tone shifting from sympathetic sister to military strategist. \"This isn't a choice. It's a scheduling problem. We're not choosing, we're managing.\" She started pacing on the small patch of lawn. \"You go to the camp on Friday. You do the sessions. You tell Dave you have a\u2026 a family commitment you can\u2019t get out of on Saturday evening. A christening. A cousin's wedding. Something boring he can't argue with.\"\n\n\"He'll know I'm lying,\" Liam groaned. \"He can smell a lie from the other side of the canal.\"\n\n\"He won't care, as long as you're there for the important sessions,\" she countered, waving a dismissive hand. \"So, you do the Saturday morning session. You give it everything you've got. Then you get in your car at, say, two o'clock. You drive to Sheffield. You check into a cheap hotel I'll find for you. You have a shower, you put on the new suit we are going to buy you, and you go to the City Hall. You walk on that stage, you sing your heart out, and you win the whole damn thing. Then,\" she took a deep breath, \"you get back in your car, you drive back to Nottingham, get three hours sleep, and you're back on the water for the Sunday morning time trial. Simple.\"\n\nLiam stared at her as if she had just suggested he row to the moon. The plan was ludicrous, a punishing marathon of driving, stress, and sleep deprivation that would leave him wrecked for both events. It was a recipe for spectacular, public failure on two separate fronts. \"Claire, that's insane. I'll be exhausted. My voice will be shot. I won't be able to row the next day. I'll crash the car. I'll\u2026 I'll fail at both.\"\n\nShe stopped pacing and came to stand in front of him, her expression fierce with a belief he couldn't begin to muster for himself. \"Liam Kenna, since when have you ever backed down from something because it was hard? You get up at five in the morning to train in the freezing rain. You've rowed until your hands bled. You push your body to its absolute limit every single day for a piece of metal on a ribbon. This is just another race. It's longer, and a bit more complicated, but it's the same thing. You just have to grit your teeth and pull.\""

                                        "text": "Claire\u2019s words hung in the evening air, a blueprint for a miracle or a disaster. Liam stared at her, his mind reeling. The sheer audacity of the plan was breathtaking. It was a house of cards built on a lie, a punishing physical ordeal, and the reliability of a fifteen-year-old Ford Fiesta. Every rational instinct, every ounce of the disciplined caution that rowing had beaten into him, screamed that it was impossible. He would be spreading himself too thin, guaranteeing failure on all fronts. He would be a subpar rower and a hoarse, exhausted singer.\n\n\"It won't work,\" he said, the words heavy with defeat. \"My body won't take it. The drive, the lack of sleep... I'll be useless for the time trial on Sunday. Dave will see right through it.\" He imagined his coach's disappointed, flinty gaze as he posted a sluggish time, the quiet 'I told you so' that would follow. The thought made his stomach clench. \"And the singing\u2026 how can I sing a song like that, a song that needs everything you've got, when I'm running on empty?\"\n\nClaire stopped her pacing and took the football from Leo, who had been watching their exchange with the solemn intensity of a referee. She tucked it under her arm. \"You're thinking like a rower, Liam. You're looking at the splits, the timings, the energy expenditure. You're not factoring in the one thing that rowing doesn't measure.\" She tapped her chest. \"Heart. Adrenaline. The buzz you'll get from walking on that stage. That will carry you. That will be your fuel. Remember when Mum used to say you had more grit than sense? This is one of those times. You just have to decide if you have the guts to try.\"\n\nShe was right. He did think in numbers and physical limits. Rowing was a science of pain management and power curves. But singing\u2026 singing was alchemy. It was turning breath and memory into something that could make a stranger feel an emotion. He looked at his sister's determined face, so like their mother's in that moment, and felt a flicker of her insane optimism. What was the alternative? To call the competition organisers and withdraw? To tell them the quiet lad from Whittington Moor with the surprisingly big voice had to go to a training camp instead? The thought was unbearable. It felt like turning his back on that secret garden he\u2019d tended for so long, letting all the flowers wither.\n\n\"A christening?\" he asked, his voice barely a whisper. The lie felt sticky and unpleasant in his mouth.\n\nClaire\u2019s face broke into a triumphant grin. \"Exactly. Your second cousin, once removed. On your dad's side. Incredibly devout family. Utterly unmissable. Dave won\u2019t know any different. Now, first things first, we're going suit shopping tomorrow. You can't sing a showstopper looking like you're about to unblock a drain.\"\n\nThe following Saturday, Liam found himself standing awkwardly in the men's department of a Debenhams in Sheffield, feeling like an overgrown bear that had wandered into a haberdashery. The world of slim-fit trousers and tailored jackets was utterly alien to him. His wardrobe consisted of technical sportswear, work jeans, and a handful of check shirts. Claire, however, was in her element, pulling jackets from rails with ruthless efficiency. \"No, not double-breasted, it'll make you look like a wardrobe,\" she muttered, discarding one option. \"That one's too shiny, you'll look like a cruise ship entertainer.\" She finally thrust a dark charcoal suit at him. \"Try this.\"\n\nHe retreated to the changing room, the space feeling laughably small. He wrestled his way into the crisp shirt and trousers, his broad shoulders and thick thighs straining against the unfamiliar fabric. When he finally put on the jacket and looked in the mirror, he barely recognised the man staring back. The suit was well-cut, slimming his frame and giving him a silhouette that was less 'brute force' and more ' quiet authority'. The charcoal fabric complimented his dark hair and the deep blue of the shirt Claire had chosen brought out the colour of his eyes. For the first time, he saw a glimmer of the man who could walk onto the stage at the City Hall. He wasn't just Liam the rower in borrowed clothes; he was someone else. A performer. The idea sent a nervous thrill right through him. He stepped out. Claire\u2019s hand flew to her mouth. \"Oh, Liam,\" she breathed. \"You look... incredible. Mum would have loved this.\" The simple, heartfelt words were the only validation he needed.\n\nThe lie was the hardest part. He cornered Dave on Tuesday, after a brutal session on the water where he\u2019d pushed himself to the point of seeing stars, determined to prove his commitment before he confessed his fictional family obligation. The coach was wiping down a boat, his movements methodical. Liam cleared his throat. \"Coach, can I have a word?\" Dave grunted an affirmative, not looking up. \"It\u2019s about the training camp. On Saturday,\" Liam began, his heart thumping against his ribs. \"I\u2019ve got a family thing I can\u2019t get out of. A christening. In the evening. I can do the morning sessions, no problem, but I\u2019ll have to leave in the afternoon.\"\n\nDave stopped wiping. He slowly straightened up and turned to face Liam, his eyes narrowed. He was silent for a long, agonising moment, his expression unreadable. \"A christening,\" he repeated, the words flat. It wasn't a question. Liam nodded, his mouth dry. He braced himself for the explosion, the accusations, the dismissal. But it didn't come. Dave just looked at him, a flicker of something\u2014disappointment, maybe even hurt\u2014in his gaze. \"Your attendance at family events has never been a problem before, Kenna.\" He picked up a rag and tossed it into a bucket with a wet slap. \"Fine. Be there for the morning. I want two faultless sessions out of you. And you be back on that water at seven a.m. Sunday for the time trial. And you had better not be tired. Your cousin\u2019s soul might be saved on Saturday, but your place in this boat won\u2019t be if you pull a lazy time. Am I clear?\"\n\n\"Crystal, coach,\" Liam said, the relief so profound it almost buckled his knees. He had his permission, conditional though it was. But Dave\u2019s final look, a long, searching stare, left him feeling cold. The coach knew something was up. He just didn\u2019t know what. The lie now felt less like a clever piece of scheduling and more like a debt that would be called in at 7 a.m. on Sunday morning.\n\nThe rest of the week was a frantic, secret balancing act. On the water, he was a machine, his focus absolute, trying to placate Dave and banish any lingering suspicion. His splits improved. The water churned. But every spare moment was consumed by Otis Redding. He\u2019d take The Biscuit Tin to the furthest corner of the supermarket car park on his lunch break, windows rolled up, and sing. He\u2019d start soft, feeling the melody in his chest, and then build, letting his voice fill the small, rattling car, pushing for that raw, desperate edge in the song's climax. He sang to the steering wheel, the faded air freshener, the cracked dashboard. He sang until his throat ached, then he\u2019d chew a throat lozenge and drive back to work, the secret rumble of the song still vibrating inside him. The two halves of his life were running in parallel, a hair's breadth from a catastrophic collision.\n\nFriday arrived with a heavy, grey sky that threatened rain. Liam packed his car, the dissonance of his luggage a perfect metaphor for his state of mind. On one side of the boot was his long rowing bag, containing his lycra, his waterproof gear, and the familiar scent of river water and effort. On the other, hanging in a pristine garment bag, was the charcoal suit. It looked impossibly sophisticated and completely out of place, a visitor from another life. Claire and Leo came out to see him off. Leo gave his leg a fierce hug. \"Break a leg, Uncle Liam!\" he shouted, slightly misquoting his mother's instructions.\n\nClaire handed him a travel mug and a bag of sandwiches. Her usual cheerful bravado was gone, replaced by a quiet intensity. \"Drive carefully. Don't think about Sunday morning, don't think about Dave. When you get to Sheffield, just think about the song. Nothing else. You can do this,\" she said, squeezing his arm. He got into The Biscuit Tin, the engine catching on the third try with a worrying cough. As he pulled away from the curb, he saw Claire and Leo in his rearview mirror, waving, a tiny island of unwavering belief. He turned the corner and they were gone. He was alone, on the road to Nottingham, to the first leg of his impossible, terrifying, exhilarating double life. The plan was in motion. There was no turning back now."

                                        "text": "The Holme Pierrepont National Water Sports Centre was a place stripped of all sentiment. It was a factory for speed, all concrete, glass, and vast, intimidating stretches of flat water, engineered for perfect racing conditions. As Liam pulled The Biscuit Tin into the car park alongside the sleek Audis and BMWs of his teammates, he felt a profound sense of alienation. The other rowers were already unloading their gear, their voices loud and confident, their conversation a familiar litany of split times, rigging adjustments, and gossip about the rival Manchester club. They were a tribe gathering for war, and Liam, with his charcoal suit hanging in the back of his car like a guilty secret, felt like a spy in their midst. He was physically present, his body going through the well-rehearsed motions of unpacking and preparing his scull, but his mind was miles away, in a different city, humming a different tune.\n\nThe Friday evening session was brutal. The sun had long set, and the course was lit by harsh floodlights that turned the water into a black, reflective oil slick. The air was cold and bitingly damp. Dave herded them through a series of relentless power drills, his voice, distorted by the megaphone, echoing across the darkness. \"Drive! Legs! Kenna, your finish is sloppy! Are you tired already?\" For two hours, Liam rowed on instinct. He let the animal part of his brain take over, the part that knew only the burn in the quads, the strain in the back, the raw, scraping gasp for air. He tried to empty his head, to make it a blank space filled only with Dave's commands and the rhythm of the boat. But the melody of 'Try a Little Tenderness' was persistent. It weaved itself between the squeak of the oarlocks and the splash of the oars, a quiet, soulful counterpoint to the violent exertion of his body. He felt split in two, a ghost in his own machine.\n\nOn Saturday morning, the atmosphere in the spartan canteen was thick with tension. Liam sat with the senior squad, methodically eating a bowl of porridge he couldn't taste. The christening lie felt flimsy and absurd in the bright morning light. Mark, the wiry accountant, sat opposite him, wolfing down toast. \"Big day for the Kenna clan, eh? Don't let the holy water make you soft for the time trial tomorrow.\" The others chuckled. Liam forced a tight smile, feeling the heat rise in his cheeks. He caught Dave\u2019s eye from across the room. The coach was watching him, his expression cold and appraising, as if trying to solve a complex equation. There was no sympathy there, only a demand. Liam knew he had to deliver on the water. It was the only currency Dave respected, the only way to pay for the lie he was about to tell.\n\nHis first session was in the single scull, his sanctuary and his proving ground. As he pushed off from the pontoon, he felt a grim sense of determination settle over him. This was a test. He paddled to the 2000-metre start line, the water calm and glassy. Dave stood on the bank, stopwatch in hand. This was it. Liam took a deep breath, coiled his body, and on Dave\u2019s sharp command, he exploded into motion. He channelled everything into the oars: the anxiety, the guilt, the fear of failure, the impossible hope for the evening ahead. He turned it all into raw, blistering power. He didn't think, he just pulled. He focused on the pain, embracing it, using it. When he finally collapsed over the finish line, his lungs screaming and his vision blurred with black spots, he knew he had left nothing in the tank. He drifted for a minute, recovering his breath, before glancing at the bank. Dave looked at his stopwatch, then back at Liam. He gave a single, sharp nod. It was the highest praise Liam could have hoped for.\n\nThe second session, in the coxless four, was a greater challenge. It was about unity, a seamless blend of four bodies and minds. His crewmates were the club\u2019s best, and they tolerated no weakness. For the first few hundred metres, Liam struggled, his timing a fraction off, his mind still reeling from the solo effort. He felt a jarring bump through the hull, a sign of his blade clashing with another's rhythm. \"Get it together, Liam!\" hissed the rower in front of him. The rebuke shocked him back to the present. He shut his eyes for a single stroke, found the shared beat, the pulsing heart of the boat, and locked in. The jarring vanished, replaced by a smooth, powerful surge. They became one entity, the eight oars dipping and pulling in perfect, silent synchronicity. They flew across the water, the boat feeling light and alive beneath them. It was the magic of rowing, the feeling he had chased for ten years, and for a few glorious minutes, it eclipsed everything else.\n\nGetting away was the most awkward part. He showered and changed quickly, his heart hammering with a new kind of nervous energy. He packed his kit, acutely aware of Dave\u2019s presence lingering by the boathouse door. \"You\u2019ll send our love to the little one, won't you, Liam?\" Mark called out with a grin. Liam just nodded, his throat too tight to speak. He loaded his bag into The Biscuit Tin, trying to act casual, as if he were just popping out for a few hours. Dave walked over, wiping his hands on a rag. He didn't mention the christening. \"Seven a.m.,\" he said, his voice low and gravelly. \"That time trial is for your seat in the boat at the regatta. Nothing else matters. Don't be late.\" The unspoken part of the sentence hung heavily between them: *And you had better be in a fit state to race.* Liam met his coach's hard gaze. \"I won't be, coach.\" He got in the car, turned the key, and held his breath. The engine sputtered, coughed, then finally rattled into life. He didn't look back as he drove out of the car park and onto the main road, leaving the world of water and work behind him.\n\nThe ninety-minute drive to Sheffield was a journey between planets. The Biscuit Tin rattled along the M1, its protests a worrying soundtrack to Liam\u2019s escalating panic. The relief of escaping the camp was quickly replaced by the terrifying reality of what lay ahead. He was driving towards the biggest performance of his life, fuelled by porridge and a lie, with the threat of a career-defining time trial hanging over him the next morning. He tried to do some vocal warm-ups, humming scales, but his voice was tight and his throat felt dry. He was a rower who had just completed two gruelling, race-pace sessions. He wasn't a singer preparing for a final. He was an athlete, and his body was crying out for rest, for protein, for an ice bath, not for a three-and-a-half-minute emotional storm on a public stage. Doubt, cold and insidious, began to creep in. Claire's plan, which had seemed so brilliantly defiant in her back garden, now felt like a fool's errand, a script for a tragedy in two acts.\n\nHe found the budget hotel Claire had booked on the outskirts of Sheffield city centre. It was a drab, functional building wedged between a tyre depot and a fast-food restaurant. The room was small and aggressively beige, with a window that overlooked a car park. The air smelled faintly of stale smoke and bleach. It was the most beautiful, most welcome place he had ever seen. The anonymity was a blessing. Here, he wasn't Kenna the rower or Kenna the finalist. He was just a man in a beige room with a suit in a bag. He had two hours until he needed to be at the City Hall. He stood under the shower for a long time, the hot water beating down on his aching shoulders, trying to wash away the scent of the river and the lingering tension of the morning. He was trying to wash the rower off and let the singer emerge.\n\nHe dried himself off and walked over to the bed where he had carefully laid out the suit. It looked impossibly dark and formal against the cheap, patterned bedspread. Slowly, methodically, as if it were a pre-race ritual, he began to dress. The crisp, clean shirt. The perfectly knotted tie. The smart trousers. Finally, he shrugged on the charcoal jacket. He turned to face the full-length mirror screwed to the back of the door. The man who stared back was a stranger. The familiar, bulky frame was still there, but the suit gave it a different shape, a different meaning. His face was pale with exhaustion and nerves, but his eyes were bright, wide with a terrifying, electric anticipation. He was no longer the phantom of the canal or Dave's errant athlete. He was Liam Kenna, finalist. He took a deep, shuddering breath. The plan, Claire's insane, impossible plan, had worked. He was here. Now, all that was left to do was walk into the light and sing."

                                        "text": "The short walk from the hotel to the Sheffield City Hall was a journey through a dreamscape. Liam moved through the Saturday evening crowds, a ghost in a sharp suit. The city was alive with the thrum of weekend nightlife; music spilled from pub doorways, and the air smelled of perfume and exhaust fumes. He felt utterly detached from it all, a bubble of quiet panic moving through the boisterous streets. His body was a catalogue of aches: his shoulders, his back, his legs, all screaming in protest from the morning\u2019s exertions. He felt hollowed out, a vessel scoured clean by effort and anxiety, and he couldn't imagine how he was going to fill it with a voice big enough to reach the back of the auditorium. Then he saw it. The City Hall was grander and more imposing than he had imagined, its stone fa\u00e7ade floodlit against the bruised twilight sky. Banners for 'Voice of the Peaks' hung between the columns. A small crowd had gathered near the entrance, held back by barriers, their phone screens held aloft. It was real. This wasn't a pub open mic; it was an event. The absurdity of his presence here, the sheer, improbable leap from a Chesterfield canal to this grand stage, hit him with the force of a physical shock. He felt a desperate urge to turn around, to get back into The Biscuit Tin and drive, not back to the rowing camp, but just away, anywhere.\n\nBackstage was a different kind of chaos from the focused tension of a regatta. It was a dizzying world of glitter, hairspray, and theatrical anxiety. Slender young women in shimmering dresses practiced vocal scales in corners, while men with carefully styled hair and worn-out guitars paced nervously, muttering lyrics to themselves. The air buzzed with a competitive energy that was both sharper and more fragile than the brute-force rivalry he knew. In the rowing world, you could see your competition\u2019s strength in their physique, in the numbers on the ergometer. Here, the weapons were hidden, carried in the larynx and the heart, and the uncertainty was terrifying. Liam felt like a Shire horse at a greyhound race, too big, too solid, his movements too economical for this frantic, glittering space. He found an unoccupied corner behind a stack of flight cases, the cool wall a welcome anchor against the dizzying swirl of it all. He was Liam Kenna, the Singing Rower. A novelty act. A geological anomaly. The judges\u2019 words came back to him, and for the first time, they felt less like a compliment and more like a label for a freak.\n\nHe pulled out his phone, his thumb clumsy on the screen. There was a text from Claire. *'Just sing it for Mum. She's in the front row of your heart. Smash it. Love you. P.S. Leo says you're better than Harry Styles.'* A small, involuntary smile touched his lips. He read the message again, the words a lifeline. *Sing it for Mum.* It cut through the noise, the fear, the impostor syndrome. It gave him a purpose beyond winning, beyond the judges, beyond the television cameras. This wasn't about them. It was about that secret garden, that part of him he\u2019d shared only with her memory. It was about standing on the hearth with a TV remote for a microphone. He closed his eyes, picturing her smiling face, and the tight knot of panic in his chest loosened just a fraction. He felt a hand on his arm and jolted. A harried-looking woman with a headset and a clipboard was looking at him. \"Liam Kenna? You're on after this act. Five minutes.\"\n\nThe walk from the wings felt like the longest journey of his life. The previous contestant, a young girl with a powerful pop voice, was taking her bow to rapturous applause. The sound washed over him, a physical wave of noise. Then the stage manager gave him a gentle push, and he was walking out into the light. It was blinding, a wall of pure heat and brightness that erased the audience, turning the vast auditorium into a deep, unknowable darkness punctuated by the faint red glow of recording lights. He could just make out the judges' table, a long, dark shape where the three arbiters of his fate sat in silhouette. He found his mark in the centre of the stage, a simple piece of tape on the floor that felt like the loneliest spot on earth. The applause for the previous singer died away, replaced by an expectant, cavernous silence. In that silence, his exhaustion roared back. A profound, bone-deep weariness. He could feel the two sessions from that morning in every screaming muscle fibre. He was running on nothing.\n\nThen, the soft, familiar notes of the introduction to 'Try a Little Tenderness' floated out from the house band. The simple piano melody was a balm, a familiar friend in this terrifyingly alien environment. He gripped the microphone, the metal cool and solid in his sweaty palm. He brought it to his lips. This was it. No more hiding. No more rowing backwards. He had to face the music. He took a breath, not the sharp, gasping breath of a rower, but a slow, deep intake from the diaphragm, just as he'd practiced in the front seat of The Biscuit Tin. He thought of his mother, of Claire and Leo, of the quiet lad from Whittington Moor who had a secret to tell. And he sang. The first line was quiet, almost hesitant, his voice husky with nerves and fatigue. *\u201cOh, she may be weary\u2026\u201d* The sound felt small, swallowed by the vastness of the hall. He could feel the judges shifting, perhaps sensing his lack of power, and a cold spike of fear lanced through him. He was failing. Claire\u2019s insane plan was crumbling.\n\nBut then he sang the next line. *\u201c...and young girls, they do get weary, wearing that same old shabby dress.\u201d* He wasn't just singing the words; he was living them. He *was* weary. He felt the truth of it in his aching back, in the burn in his thighs. The raw honesty of his own physical state connected with the song's emotion, and something shifted. He wasn't performing anymore; he was testifying. He drew on the rower's discipline, the ingrained ability to push through pain, to find another gear when the body is screaming to stop. He channelled that grit not into an oar, but into his voice. As the song began its famous build, the horns kicking in, his voice found its true place. It deepened, strengthened, filled with a richness and power that surprised even him. It was the sound he had found in his living room, but amplified, electrified by the stage and the moment.\n\nHe felt the atmosphere in the hall change. The silence was no longer empty; it was charged, attentive. He could feel thousands of people leaning in, listening. He risked a glance at the judges' table. The woman who had called him a geological anomaly was leaning forward, her glasses pushed up on her head, her mouth slightly agape. He had their attention. The song moved into its final, explosive section. It was now or never. He let go of the last vestiges of control, the last shred of self-consciousness. He poured the exhaustion, the conflict, the hope, the grief for his mother, the love for his sister, all of it, into the music. *\u201cYou got to, got to, got to\u2026 try a little tenderness!\u201d* The words were a roar, a desperate, passionate plea torn from the very soles of his feet. It was the raw, unvarnished sound of his soul. He held the final, soaring note until his lungs burned and his vision swam, giving every last ounce of breath and energy he possessed. Then, as the band crashed to a halt, he let the microphone drop to his side, his chest heaving, his head bowed, utterly spent. For a heartbeat, there was absolute, profound silence. Then, the darkness in front of him erupted. The sound of a thousand people on their feet, the roar of applause and cheers, hit him like a tidal wave, a thunderous, undeniable answer to the question he had been too afraid to ask."

                                        "text": "The wave of sound was a physical thing, washing over him, pressing him down. Liam stood with his head bowed, his chest a mess of aching muscles and heaving lungs, as the roar of the crowd filled every inch of the vast auditorium. It was nothing like the cheers at a regatta finish line, which were a shared, communal explosion of relief and victory. This was different. This was a thousand separate moments of connection aimed directly at him, a thousand strangers telling him they had heard his secret. He was utterly, profoundly alone in the centre of that storm of approval, and it was the most terrifying and beautiful feeling of his life.\n\nHe forced himself to look up, blinking against the stage lights that now seemed less aggressive, more warming. Through the glare, he could see them: a sea of blurred, smiling faces, a forest of hands clapping above their heads. People were standing not just in the front rows, but all the way to the back of the stalls, up into the grand circle. He saw a woman in the third row openly weeping, her friend's arm around her shoulder. He saw a man who looked like a retired steelworker, built like a brick outhouse, nodding slowly, a look of profound respect on his weathered face. It was too much to process. It was a language of emotion he was only just beginning to understand.\n\nThe show\u2019s host, a man with a smile so bright it seemed to have its own power source, glided over and put a companionable arm around Liam's shoulders. The gesture felt strange against his sweat-dampened suit. \"Liam Kenna, ladies and gentlemen! Let's hear it one more time!\" The host held his microphone out to the audience, and the roar swelled again. \"Wow,\" the host said, his voice a professional blend of awe and bonhomie. \"Liam, I think it's safe to say you left a piece of your soul on that stage tonight. The judges are speechless, but I'm going to make them speak. Let's go to the panel.\" The lights shifted, and Liam found himself facing the three silhouettes, now leaning forward into their own pools of light.\n\nThe woman who had peered at him over her glasses in the auditions spoke first, her voice hushed with emotion. \"Liam, I've been doing this a long time. I have heard technically perfect singers, I have heard powerful singers, and I have heard singers with great stage presence. It is a rare, rare thing to hear a singer with truth. What you did with that song... it wasn't a performance. It was a confession. It was the most honest three and a half minutes of music I have ever had the privilege to witness on this stage.\" The other judges echoed her sentiments, speaking of vocal power and emotional depth, but Liam barely heard their words. He was fixated on the phrase 'a singer with truth'. It resonated deep within him, naming the very thing he had been striving for without even knowing it. He mumbled his thanks, his head swimming, the words of praise blurring into the applause, all of it becoming a single, overwhelming sensory experience.\n\nHe walked off the stage in a daze, guided by a gentle hand on his back. The applause followed him into the wings, finally fading as he passed back into the glitter-and-hairspray chaos of the backstage area. The atmosphere had changed. The other contestants, his rivals, no longer looked at him with polite curiosity. They looked at him with wide-eyed awe. A couple of them patted him on the back as he passed, murmuring \"Incredible, man,\" and \"That was something else.\" The praise from his peers, who knew what it took to stand on that stage, felt more real than the roar of the crowd. He found his quiet corner behind the flight cases and sagged against the cool wall. And then, as if a switch had been flicked, the adrenaline vanished. A wave of exhaustion so profound it was nauseating washed through him. His legs began to tremble uncontrollably. The aches from his two rowing sessions, which had been masked by the stage lights, returned with a ferocious, biting intensity. He was no longer a showstopper; he was just an exhausted athlete who had pushed himself far, far beyond his limits.\n\nHe knew he couldn't stay. He couldn't wait for the public vote, for the final results. His grand final was over, but his ordeal was not. He had another race to run. He found the harried stage manager, who was now looking at him with a new level of respect. \"I have to go,\" he said, the lie feeling worn and familiar now. \"Family emergency.\" She nodded instantly, her expression full of sympathy. \"Of course. Oh, gosh, I'm so sorry. Is everything okay? We'll call you, of course. You're... you're a shoo-in for the top two, at least.\" He just nodded, unable to think about winning. \"Thank you,\" he managed, before slipping out of a heavy fire door and back into the anonymity of the Sheffield night. The cool air was a shock. The sounds of the city felt muted and distant. He walked back to the aggressively beige hotel, his movements slow and stiff, a man twice his age. He changed out of the charcoal suit with a tenderness that bordered on reverence, folding it carefully, as if it were a relic from a life he had lived only for a single evening.\n\nThe Biscuit Tin started on the fourth try, its phlegmy roar a welcome, familiar sound in the silent hotel car park. The journey back to Nottingham was a surreal battle against sleep. With the windows down and the cold night air blasting his face, he drove south on a near-empty M1. The motorway lights became hypnotic, dangerous comets streaking past. He cranked the radio, a cacophony of late-night pop and talk shows filling the small car, a desperate attempt to keep the fog of exhaustion at bay. He drank the last of the lukewarm water from his bottle and thought of Dave's cold stare. *Seven a.m.* The deadline was a beacon in the darkness, a point on the map he had to reach. It was the most gruelling endurance event of his life, a slow, rattling crawl back to his other reality.\n\nWhen he finally pulled into the deserted car park at Holme Pierrepont, it was almost two in the morning. The facility was a collection of dark, brutalist shapes under a cold, starry sky. The silence was absolute, a crushing weight after the noise of the city, the stage, and his rattling car. He felt like an astronaut returning to a silent, sleeping earth after a mission to a loud and vibrant planet. He let himself into his shared room, moving with practiced stealth. His roommate was a dark lump under a thin duvet, his deep, rhythmic breathing the only sound. Liam didn't have the energy to undress. He kicked off his battered trainers, peeled off his jeans, and collapsed onto the narrow, unyielding mattress in his hoodie and t-shirt. Sleep, he thought, would be a mercy, a sweet oblivion. But it wouldn't come. His body was a thrumming network of aches and pains, and his mind was a battlefield. The roar of the crowd clashed with the squeak of his oarlocks. His mother\u2019s smile flickered behind his eyelids, followed by Dave\u2019s unimpressed glower. He lay in the darkness, trapped between two worlds, too tired to sleep, too wired to rest, as the precious hours ticked away.\n\nThe shrill, digital scream of his phone alarm at six o\u2019clock was an act of violence. For a moment, he had no idea where he was. The thin, grey light, the smell of damp sportswear, the spartan room\u2014it all came flooding back with a crushing weight. He swung his legs over the side of the bed and every muscle in his body screamed in a unified chorus of protest. He felt brittle, scoured out, profoundly unwell. He stumbled to the small sink and looked in the mirror. The man who stared back was a stranger. His face was pale and drawn, his eyes bloodshot and sunk deep in their sockets, circled by bruises of exhaustion. The victorious singer, the man who had looked so sharp in a charcoal suit, was gone. In his place was a haggard, haunted-looking rower on the verge of collapse. He pulled on his lycra, the tight fabric feeling less like a second skin and more like a straitjacket. He was an empty cup, and he was about to be asked to pour a gallon. The time was 6:35 a.m. His reckoning with Dave was less than half an hour away."

                                        "text": "The walk from his room to the boathouse felt like crossing a vast, unforgiving desert. The concrete path was a mile long, the damp morning air a physical weight on his chest. Other rowers, fresh from a full night's sleep, jogged past him, their bodies loose and ready, their banter sharp and bright in the pre-dawn gloom. They were coiled springs, and he was a length of frayed, overstretched rope. He nodded and grunted in response to their \"Morning, Kenna\" greetings, his own voice a dry rasp. He felt their glances linger on him, noting the pallor of his skin, the dark hollows under his eyes. He was a piece of faulty equipment, a boat with a slow leak, and everyone could see it.\n\nHe found his scull, a sleek black needle of carbon fibre that usually felt like an extension of his own body. This morning, it felt alien, a finely-tuned instrument he no longer knew how to play. As he began checking his riggers, a shadow fell over him. It was Dave. The coach stood with his arms crossed, a steaming mug of tea in one hand, a stopwatch in the other. He didn't speak for a long moment, simply observing Liam's slow, stiff movements. His silence was more damning than any tirade.\n\n\"The christening go well, Kenna?\" Dave asked, his voice deceptively mild, the gravelly edge smoothed away into something far more dangerous. \"Must have been a long service. You look like you've been wrestling with the devil all night and lost.\"\n\nLiam\u2019s hands froze on the rigger bolt. He couldn\u2019t bring himself to look up. \"It was... a long drive, coach,\" he mumbled to the hull of his boat.\n\n\"Right,\" Dave said, taking a slow sip of his tea. \"A long drive.\" He took a step closer, lowering his voice so only Liam could hear. \"I don't know where you were last night, son. And right now, I don't care. All I care about is what happens in the next seven minutes on that stretch of water. You told me you wouldn't be tired. You're a liar. Your face is a mess, and you look like you're about to fall over. But you're here. You're in your kit. So you're going to race.\" He pointed the stopwatch at Liam like a weapon. \"This little clock doesn't care about your excuses. It only tells the truth. Let's see what kind of truth you've got left in you.\"\n\nHe walked away without another word, leaving Liam feeling stripped bare, his lie exposed and worthless. The coach knew. He knew he'd been played for a fool, and now he was going to watch Liam pay the price in the only currency that mattered: time. The shame was a physical burn, worse than the ache in his muscles. He felt a surge of anger\u2014at Dave, at Claire, but mostly at himself for thinking he could pull this off. He finished his preparations on autopilot, his mind a numb void, and carried his boat to the pontoon. The water was flat and grey, a black mirror that reflected the miserable sky. It felt like an ending.\n\nPushing off from the pontoon, he paddled slowly towards the start line. Each stroke was a negotiation with his protesting body. His back was a rigid plank, his legs felt like they were filled with wet sand, and his head throbbed in time with his strained heartbeat. He lined up next to the other single scullers, each man in his own lane, a picture of coiled, focused power. Liam felt like a ghost among them. When the starter's electronic horn blared, his body reacted out of pure, deep-seated instinct. He launched into the first powerful strokes, the initial 'drive' phase of the race. But the explosion he expected from his legs wasn't there. It was a dull, muffled push. The boat felt heavy, sluggish, stuck in the water. Within two hundred metres, he could see the other scullers pulling away from him, their puddles of disturbed water already a boat-length ahead. The panic he\u2019d been holding at bay crashed over him. He was failing. Publicly and spectacularly.\n\nThe first five hundred metres were a private hell. His technique, usually so fluid and powerful, fell apart. He was pulling with his arms, his back straining, his legs unresponsive. The digital monitor at his feet showed a split time that was five, then six, then seven seconds slower than his worst training pace. It was a time that would see him relegated to the second boat, his season\u2019s ambitions turning to dust. He could almost feel Dave\u2019s cold, triumphant gaze from the towpath. *This is what you get for your lies. This is the truth.* The thought made him want to stop, to just let the oars drift and slump over, defeated. But then another voice cut through the fog of pain and shame. A judge's voice. *A singer with truth.*\n\nWhat was the truth now? The truth was that he was exhausted. The truth was that he was in pain. The truth was that he was failing. He had sung that truth last night. He hadn't hidden his weariness; he had poured it into the song. Could he do that here? Could he row the truth? He stopped fighting his body, stopped trying to force a power that wasn't there. He eased off for a single stroke, taking one deep, ragged breath. He closed his eyes and thought not of the finish line, but of the stage lights. He thought of the roar of the crowd, the feeling of a thousand people hearing him, really hearing him. He remembered the raw, desperate cry of Otis Redding's voice, the sheer force of will that pushed the song to its climax. *Got to, got to, got to...*\n\nThe phrase became a mantra, a new rhythm for the boat. He found a different gear, not of power, but of relentless, stubborn endurance. He stopped thinking about his split time and started thinking about the beat. *Catch... (Got to)... Drive... (Got to)... Finish... (Got to)... Recover.* His strokes were not beautiful. They were not efficient. They were ugly, guttural, a raw and desperate heave. He was no longer a technician; he was a labourer, digging his blades into the water and dragging the boat forward with whatever he had left. He was rowing with his heart, with the memory of the song, with the ghost of his mother\u2019s pride. He was channelling the singer, the man who stood and delivered when he had nothing left, into the rower's exhausted body.\n\nHe didn't know if he was getting faster. He had stopped looking at the monitor. His world had shrunk to the grey water, the hiss of the hull, and the three-word mantra driving him forward. He entered the final five hundred metres, the 'red zone' where races are won and lost. A primal roar built in his chest. He pulled with a ferocity that came from somewhere beyond his muscles, from the same deep well of emotion he had drawn from on stage. He saw the orange buoys of the finish line, a blurred smear in his tunnel vision. He pulled one last, agonising stroke, then another, and then he was through. He collapsed forward, the oars slipping from his numb fingers, his head and chest slumping onto the deck of the boat. He lay there, gasping, his body convulsing, utterly and completely spent. He had nothing left. He had given the water the only truth he had."

                                        "text": "The world returned to Liam in fragments. First, the frantic, scraping sound of his own breathing. Then, the gentle slap of water against the hull of the scull, a sound that was usually a comfort but now felt like a mocking pat on the back. A profound trembling started in his legs and spread through his entire body, a seismic release of a strain his system could no longer contain. He tried to sit up, to regain some semblance of a rower's posture, but his core muscles refused the command, sending sharp, protesting signals of failure. He remained slumped over, his cheek pressed against the cold, wet carbon fibre, a beached whale in a skin-tight suit. He had rowed the truth, and the truth had broken him.\n\nHe heard the gentle crunch of footsteps on the gravel towpath, slowing and then stopping beside his boat. He didn't need to look up to know who it was. The silence that followed was heavy and absolute, a judgment in itself. Liam squeezed his eyes shut, bracing for the inevitable storm of Dave\u2019s fury. He deserved it. He had lied, he had been foolish, and he had posted a time that was almost certainly a disgrace.\n\n\"Your time was four seconds off your personal best.\"\n\nThe statement was so unexpected, so contrary to the catastrophe he had felt, that Liam thought he had misheard. He pushed himself up with a groan, his arms shaking, and finally looked at his coach. Dave was standing there, staring not at Liam, but at the stopwatch in his hand, his brow furrowed as if the device had presented him with an impossible paradox. Four seconds. It wasn't good. For an elite rower, it was a significant margin. But it wasn't the disaster Liam had expected. It wasn't the time of a man who should have been ten, fifteen seconds slower. It was the time of a man who had fought.\n\n\"I don't know how,\" Dave said, finally looking up. His gaze was no longer cold or angry. It was something far more unnerving: analytical and intensely curious. \"For the first six hundred metres, you were rowing like a novice. You were tense, your rhythm was shot, you were bleeding speed with every stroke. I was about to pull you off the course. And then... something changed. Your technique was still a mess. It was ugly. But your power output spiked. You held it all the way to the line. It was the ugliest, most inefficient, most stubborn piece of rowing I have ever seen in my life.\" He paused, shaking his head slightly. \"So I'll ask you again. Where were you last night, Kenna?\"\n\nThe lie had dissolved. There was no point to it anymore. Liam let out a long, shuddering breath that was half-sob, half-laugh. \"I was in Sheffield. At the City Hall. I was in the final of a singing competition.\" He said the words to the water, to the boat, to himself as much as to Dave. They sounded even more ridiculous out loud in the cold morning light.\n\nDave was silent for a long moment. He looked from Liam's haggard face to the boat, then back again, as if trying to reconcile the two realities. \"Right,\" he said, the single word laden with a decade of accumulated disbelief. He tucked the stopwatch into his pocket. \"A singing competition.\" He didn't mock. He didn't shout. He just stated it as a fact he was now forced to incorporate into his worldview. \"Get your boat out of the water. You look like death. Go and get something to eat. And then you and I are going to have a conversation about your commitment to this crew.\" He turned and walked away, his stiff-backed posture radiating a complex mix of disappointment and reluctant respect that was far more potent than pure anger.\n\nThe act of getting the boat out of the water was a Herculean effort. Mark, his face a mixture of concern and mischievous curiosity, came to help him lift the scull onto the trestles. \"Blimey, Liam. That christening take it out of you? You look like you've been on a three-day bender with the devil's choir.\" Liam just grunted, his body too broken for banter. As he wiped down the hull, his hands moving with slow, deliberate care, news of his performance began to ripple through the squad. Whispers followed him into the changing rooms. Someone had seen an article on a local news site. Someone else had a cousin who'd been watching. The secret was out, and it was spreading like wildfire.\n\nHe collapsed onto a bench, peeling off his wet lycra with a groan. His phone lay in the bottom of his bag, a small, black rectangle of judgement. He had deliberately ignored it, terrified of what it might tell him. Had he won? Had he lost? Had he made a fool of himself in front of a television audience? Part of him didn't want to know. The performance itself, the act of singing his truth, felt like the only thing that mattered. The result was just an administrative detail. But he was also human. He had to know. With trembling fingers, he pulled it out. The screen lit up with a blizzard of notifications. Dozens of WhatsApp messages from the club group chat, a flurry of texts, and five missed calls from Claire. And one email. The subject line read: *A Message from the Voice of the Peaks Team.*\n\nHis heart hammered against his ribs. He ignored Claire's calls for a moment and opened the email.\n\n*Dear Liam,*\n*On behalf of the entire production, we wanted to thank you for what was, by any measure, one of the most memorable and moving final performances we have ever had. The public vote was incredibly close. In the end, the title of Voice of the Peaks 2024 was awarded to Sasha Jones. We are absolutely thrilled, however, to name you as our runner-up. The judges were unanimous in their praise for your unique talent and emotional honesty...*\n\nRunner-up. He read the words again. Not the winner. He felt a sharp, surprising pang of disappointment, a competitor\u2019s instinctive reaction to second place. He had lost. But as he read on, the formal, corporate language of the email faded, and the meaning settled in. Runner-up. In a real, televised singing competition. He, Liam Kenna, the quiet lad from the canal. A smile, slow and genuine, spread across his exhausted face. He hadn't won. And it was okay. More than okay. It was brilliant. He hadn't failed. He had stood on a stage and sung his heart out and people had listened. He had raced in a boat when his body was broken and had found a way not to quit. In a single, impossible twenty-four-hour period, he had come in second in two different lives, and somehow, it felt more like a victory than any gold medal he had ever won. He leaned his head back against the cold tiles of the changing room wall and closed his eyes, the roar of the crowd and the hiss of his hull on the water finally finding a strange, quiet harmony in his mind."

                                        "text": "He let his head rest against the cool, damp tiles of the changing room wall for a long moment, the phone still clutched in his hand. Runner-up. The two words seemed to hum with a quiet, steady energy, a counterbalance to the screaming exhaustion in his limbs. Before he could overthink it, before the disappointment could curdle the strange joy, he tapped on Claire\u2019s name and raised the phone to his ear. It was answered before the first ring had even finished, an explosion of sound that made him pull the receiver away from his head.\n\n\"LIAM! OH MY GOD, LIAM! YOU WERE AMAZING! I'M CRYING, LEO'S HYPERVENTILATING, DAD ACTUALLY SMILED! WE WERE AT THE RUTLAND AND THE ENTIRE PUB WENT SILENT WHEN YOU STARTED, AND THEN WHEN YOU FINISHED, THEY WERE STANDING ON THE TABLES! ON THE TABLES, LIAM! I'VE GOT IT ON VIDEO! YOU WERE ROBBED, ABSOLUTELY ROBBED, BUT WHO CARES, YOU WERE INCREDIBLE!\"\n\nHer voice, a breathless, joyous torrent, was the purest form of victory he could imagine. He found himself laughing, a cracked, hoarse sound that hurt his throat but felt wonderful. \"Claire, calm down,\" he managed, his own voice thick with emotion. \"I can't... I didn't win, Claire.\"\n\n\"Don't you dare say that!\" she retorted, her voice fierce with pride. \"You won. You walked onto that stage looking like James Bond's bigger, better-looking brother from Derbyshire, and you sang like an absolute god. Everyone knows you won. Sasha was brilliant, but you... you were something else. You were real. Mum would have... she would have been so, so proud.\" There was a catch in her voice now, and Liam felt his own eyes sting. In the background, he could hear Leo shouting, \"Uncle Liam is a pop star! He's a pop star!\"\n\nHe stayed on the phone for ten minutes, basking in the uncomplicated warmth of his sister\u2019s pride, letting it soak into his bones and begin the slow work of healing his frayed spirit. She told him about the prize\u2014a recording session at a professional studio and a not-insignificant sum of money that would more than cover the cost of a new engine for The Biscuit Tin. The practicalities of it were grounding, making the dreamlike events of the night before feel solid and tangible. When he finally hung up, the small, sterile changing room no longer felt like a cell. It felt like a chrysalis from which he was, painfully and slowly, beginning to emerge.\n\nHe dressed with the deliberate movements of an old man, pulling on his jeans and a clean hoodie. When he finally pushed open the door and walked back into the main boathouse, the atmosphere had undergone a seismic shift. The earlier whispers had been replaced by a quiet, buzzing curiosity. A group of the younger rowers stopped their conversation and just watched him walk past. Mark detached himself from a group and came over, phone in hand, a wide, incredulous grin on his face.\n\n\"Kenna,\" he said, shaking his head in disbelief. \"I've got three missed calls from my wife. She says if I don't get your autograph, I'm sleeping in the shed.\" He held up his phone, showing Liam a clip from the final, filmed from a TV screen. It was the climax of the song, his face contorted in a mask of raw emotion, his voice a powerful roar that seemed impossible coming from the exhausted man standing there now. \"Mate, we all thought you were just a big lump who could pull an oar. We didn't know you had *that* in you. That was... mega.\" Another rower, one of the serious, taciturn giants from the coxless four, clapped him on the shoulder, a gesture that almost sent Liam staggering. \"Good on you, mate,\" he said, his voice gruff with an approval that meant more than a thousand standing ovations. They didn't mock him. They didn't see weakness. They saw a different kind of strength, and in their own blunt, understated way, they were in awe of it.\n\nThe final trial, however, was yet to come. Dave\u2019s office was a small, cluttered cave at the end of the boathouse, a place smelling of old paper, damp wool, and industrial-strength coffee. Race plans and tide tables were pinned to a corkboard, and trophies from bygone eras gathered dust on a high shelf. It was the nerve centre of Dave's world. Liam knocked on the open door. Dave was at his desk, staring at a spreadsheet on his computer screen. He didn\u2019t look up. \"Shut the door,\" he said. The quiet command sent a chill through Liam. He did as he was told, the click of the latch sounding unnervingly final.\n\n\"So,\" Dave began, swivelling his chair around. \"You're a singer.\" He said the word 'singer' as if it were a newly discovered species of insect he was trying to classify. \"You lied to me, you jeopardised your place in the boat, you risked the whole crew's performance at the regatta, and you turned up this morning looking like something the cat dragged in. All for a karaoke contest.\"\n\nLiam stood before the desk, his hands hanging uselessly at his sides. He didn't offer an excuse. He owed his coach the truth, ugly and complicated as it was. \"It wasn't karaoke, coach. And it wasn't just for a contest.\" He took a breath. \"My mum... she loved music. We used to sing all the time. After she died, the house went quiet. Singing those old songs was... it was my way of remembering her. Of keeping that part of her alive. It was just for me. I never meant for it to become this.\" He gestured vaguely, indicating the whole impossible situation. \"But it did. And last night, I had to see it through. I had to.\"\n\nDave listened, his expression unreadable, his steepled fingers hiding his mouth. He was a man who dealt in quantifiable metrics: power, speed, endurance. He was being presented with data he couldn't plot on a graph. \"Your mother,\" he said, his voice losing some of its edge. \"She was a good woman. Came to every race.\" The unexpected memory seemed to hang in the air between them. He looked down at his desk, at the spreadsheet of split times and power curves, then back up at Liam.\n\n\"I saw the video,\" Dave admitted, his voice low. \"Mark showed me. In the final minute of that race this morning, when you had nothing left, your face looked exactly like it did on that stage. Like you were tearing it out of yourself. I've spent ten years trying to teach you how to dig that deep, how to find that place where you go beyond what you think you're capable of. And you found it. Not on the water. But in a theatre, singing some old love song.\" He leaned back in his chair, a long, slow sigh escaping him. It was the sound of a fundamental belief system rearranging itself. \"I don't understand it. And I don't have to. But I saw what it did for you this morning. You should have been dead on your feet. You should have been fifteen seconds slower. But you weren't. You found a way.\"\n\nHe stood up and walked to the corkboard, staring at the crew list for the Northern Regatta. Liam\u2019s name was at the top, under 'Single Scull' and 'Coxless Four'. \"Your place in this boat isn't about loyalty, Kenna. It's about speed. And it's my job to make you faster. If singing songs in a suit makes you faster, then sing your bloody songs.\" He turned around, his eyes locking with Liam\u2019s. There was no smile, but the hard, flinty disappointment was gone, replaced by a new, grudging understanding. \"But if your time slips by even one second because of it, you're out. And you're cleaning the toilets for a month. Are we clear?\"\n\n\"Crystal, coach,\" Liam said, the relief so profound it felt like a physical release, a muscle unclenched after a decade of tension.\n\nHe walked out of Dave's office and back into the boathouse, which was now bustling with the post-training activity of a normal Sunday morning. But nothing felt normal. He felt lighter, as if he'd been rowing with a weighted vest on for years and had only just taken it off. He walked out of the boathouse doors and into the full light of the day. The sun had finally broken through the grey cloud, and the river, his place of work and worship, shimmered with a new, welcoming brilliance. He got into The Biscuit Tin and turned the key. The engine, for once, started on the first try, settling into a steady, reliable rattle. He pulled out of the car park and onto the open road, driving not towards home, but just driving. He didn't turn on the radio. He didn't need to. For the first time, there was no conflict, no counter-rhythm. There was only the steady beat of the engine and the quiet, harmonious rhythm of his own heart, a rhythm that finally belonged to a man who was whole."

                                        "text": "The road back to Chesterfield unravelled before The Biscuit Tin in a ribbon of grey tarmac under a now-brilliant sky. The familiar landmarks of his home county\u2014a distant view of Bolsover Castle, the gentle roll of the fields near Calow\u2014seemed new, as if he were seeing them for the first time with both eyes open. The profound exhaustion remained, a deep, resonant hum in his bones, but the frantic, panicked edge had gone. It was a clean fatigue, the satisfying ache of a body and soul that had been pushed to their absolute limits and had, somehow, held. He felt scoured clean, hollowed out, but ready to be filled again. For the first time in as long as he could remember, there was no war inside his head. There was only a quiet, spacious peace.\n\nHe pulled into a lay-by that overlooked the valley where the town was nestled, the crooked spire a familiar, reassuring punctuation mark against the sky. He killed the engine and the sudden silence was welcome. He scrolled through his phone and found his dad\u2019s number. He hesitated for a moment. Their calls were usually brief, functional affairs about shopping lists or boiler repairs. Since his mum had died, they communicated mostly through a shared, unspoken grief, a quiet understanding that the most important thing had been taken from their lives and words were a poor substitute. But Claire had said he\u2019d smiled. That single image was an invitation. He pressed the call button.\n\nIt rang four times before his dad picked up, his voice a gruff, questioning \"Liam?\"\n\"Hi, Dad. I'm on my way back,\" Liam said, his own voice sounding foreign, softer than usual.\n\"Right,\" his dad replied. A pause stretched between them, filled with the static of years of unsaid things. Liam could picture him perfectly, sitting in his worn armchair, the remote control on the arm, the racing pages open on his lap.\n\"Claire said you were at The Rutland last night,\" Liam prompted gently.\nAnother pause. \"Aye. Place was packed. Had to stand.\"\n\"Oh. Right.\" Liam searched for what to say next. \"So... you saw it then?\"\n\"I saw it,\" his dad confirmed. The silence that followed was different this time. It felt less like an absence and more like a space being held. Liam waited. \"That song,\" his dad said finally, his voice thick, as if the words were being dredged up from a deep, rusty well. \"That Otis Redding one. Your mother loved that song. Used to play it on the record player on a Sunday morning while she was cooking.\"\n\nThe simple statement landed with the force of a revelation. It was an acknowledgement, a connection, a shared memory offered up like a priceless gift. It was his father\u2019s way of saying *I heard you. I understood.* It was everything. \"Yeah,\" Liam managed, his throat tight. \"Yeah, I know, Dad.\"\n\"You did alright,\" his dad added, the highest praise in his limited emotional vocabulary. \"She'd have liked it.\" And then, as if he had expended his entire quota of sentiment for the decade, he cleared his throat. \"Your auntie Jean's asking if you can take a look at her lawnmower next week. Says it's making a funny noise.\" The familiar territory of the mundane was a relief for both of them. They talked for another minute about the lawnmower, then said their goodbyes. Liam ended the call and leaned his forehead against the steering wheel, a single, hot tear tracing a path through the grime on his cheek. He hadn't won a trophy, but he had gotten his dad to talk about a Sunday morning.\n\nWhen he finally pulled up outside his small terraced house, it felt more like a home than it had in years. The silence within its walls was no longer one of absence, but one of peace. He walked into the living room and his eyes went straight to the mantelpiece, to the crowded rowing trophies standing guard around the single, faded photograph of his mother. She was smiling, her head tilted slightly, a look of amused affection in her eyes. He felt he could finally meet her gaze without the familiar, accompanying pang of guilt for all the music that had died with her. He had sung her song. He had brought it back. He walked upstairs, stripped off his clothes, and fell into bed. The sleep that took him was not the fitful, anxious rest of a man at war with himself, but a deep, dreamless, healing oblivion.\n\nHe woke hours later to the gentle light of late afternoon slanting through his window and the persistent buzzing of his phone on the bedside table. He felt groggy but fundamentally different, as if some crucial part of his internal machinery had been taken out, cleaned, and slotted back into its rightful place. The phone buzzed again. It was a message from Mark. *'The video of you in the final is doing the rounds on a massive rowing forum. They're calling you The Sculling Soulman. You're a legend, mate.'* Liam stared at the words, a slow smile spreading across his face. The Sculling Soulman. It was ridiculous, but it was also perfect. He was no longer two separate, warring entities. He was one thing.\n\nCuriosity finally got the better of him. He showered, pulled on a pair of old jeans and a t-shirt, and walked down to the corner shop for a pint of milk and a newspaper. He felt a strange self-consciousness as he walked, a new awareness of how people saw him. He was no longer anonymous. As he put the milk on the counter, the woman behind the till, Mrs. Evans, a woman who had sold him sweets and comics since he was Leo\u2019s age, peered at him over her glasses. \"It is you!\" she exclaimed, her voice loud in the quiet shop. \"Off the telly last night! Oh, you were wonderful, love! Had a tear in my eye. You were robbed, you were. That girl was good, but you... you had soul!\" She leaned forward conspiratorially. \"My Brenda's getting married in August. We need a wedding singer...\" Liam laughed, a genuine, easy laugh, feeling a blush creep up his neck. He stammered something about being busy with training and made his escape, clutching his milk and the local paper, his heart thumping with a strange mixture of embarrassment and pleasure. The secret was out, and he was beginning to realize that maybe it wasn't a cage he had escaped, but a door he had finally walked through. His secret garden now had an open gate."

                                        "text": "Back home, the newspaper sat on his kitchen table, its headline a testament to the surreal turn his life had taken. *\u2018Local Rower\u2019s Soulful Surprise at Peaks Final\u2019*. There was a slightly grainy picture of him on stage, his face a mask of passion, the smart charcoal suit looking impossibly formal. He read the article, a mixture of local news reporting and breathless praise, and it felt like reading about a stranger. He had spent his entire adult life cultivating a kind of invisibility, his identity defined by the brute, anonymous force required to move a boat backwards. To be seen so clearly, to have the most private part of himself laid bare for public consumption, was a dizzying, disorienting experience. The quiet lad from Whittington Moor was gone, and in his place was this \u2018Sculling Soulman\u2019, a public figure, albeit on a very small, very local scale. He wasn't sure if he was ready for the promotion.\n\nThe following Tuesday, as he walked into the boathouse for the evening session, the change was palpable. Someone had pinned the newspaper article to the club noticeboard, right next to the regatta sign-up sheets. As he passed, a young novice rower, barely eighteen, nervously asked him to sign the edge of the clipping. The request was so absurd that Liam almost laughed, but the boy\u2019s earnest, hero-worshipping expression stopped him. He scribbled his name awkwardly with a biro, his signature looking clunky and unfamiliar, the scrawl of a man more used to gripping an oar than a pen. The old locker room banter had shifted, too. The usual jibes about his pre-dawn training or his monstrous appetite had been replaced by a new, recurring theme. As he was changing, Mark's phone, placed pointedly on a bench, began to play the opening bars of 'Try a Little Tenderness'. A ripple of snickering went through the room. Liam, expecting the familiar hot blush of embarrassment, was surprised to find himself just shaking his head and smiling. The joke had lost its power to wound him; the secret was no longer his to protect.\n\nHe carried that new, lighter feeling with him down to the water. As he launched his scull into the cool, dark river, the evening felt charged with a different kind of energy. For years, these sessions had been a form of penance, a physical grind to atone for a day spent sitting at a desk. Now, it felt like something else. It felt like expression. He pushed off, the boat gliding smoothly, and as he began to row, he didn't fight the music in his head. He invited it in. The catch, the drive, the finish, the recovery\u2014it was no longer just a sequence of movements. It was a four-beat bar of music. He found the rhythm of the song that was always playing in his mind, Al Green's 'Let's Stay Together', and matched his stroke to its steady, soulful pulse. He wasn't rowing against his nature anymore; he was rowing with it. The boat seemed to respond, surging forward with a smooth, powerful grace that felt effortless, a perfect harmony of muscle and melody.\n\nDave stood on the towpath, his familiar silhouette a fixed point in the deepening dusk. Liam was doing timed one-thousand-metre pieces, and he knew the coach's stopwatch was tracking every stroke. He finished his first piece, his breathing deep but controlled, his muscles burning with a clean, efficient fire. He paddled gently, waiting for the inevitable critique to be barked across the water. But it didn't come. Dave just clicked his stopwatch and made a note on his clipboard. \"Again,\" was all he shouted. Liam completed a second piece, and a third, each one feeling as strong and fluid as the last, his body and mind working in a rare, seamless partnership. As he paddled back towards the boathouse, Dave walked alongside him on the path. \"Your consistency has improved,\" the coach grunted, his gaze fixed straight ahead. \"Your times for those three pieces were within half a second of each other. Strong times.\" He was silent for a few paces. \"I got a call,\" he said, so quietly Liam had to strain to hear. \"From a fella at the National Rowing Magazine. They want to do a feature. On the club. On you. 'The Singing Rower Who Found An Extra Gear'.\" Dave said the phrase with the same distaste as if he were describing a piece of mouldy bread. \"I told them to call back next week.\"\n\nLater that evening, Claire came over, brandishing a bottle of Prosecco and a USB stick. \"Official celebration,\" she announced, shooing him onto the sofa. \"Dad's babysitting, the hype has died down just enough for us to have a proper moment, and I have the evidence.\" She plugged the stick into his television, and a shaky, cacophonous video filled the screen. It was the footage from The Rutland Arms. He watched, mesmerised, as the camera panned across the packed pub, across the faces of people he'd known his whole life. He saw his neighbours, old school friends, fellow parents from Leo's football team, all of them standing, their conversations stilled, their eyes fixed on the pub's television where his own face was singing. And then the camera found his dad, standing by the bar, a half-empty pint in his hand, his expression uncharacteristically open, his gaze locked on the screen. He wasn't smiling, but he was *watching*. He was present. As the song on the television reached its climax, the pub erupted, a roar of pure, communal joy. Liam watched himself on the screen, a man he barely knew, and then watched the reaction of the people who knew him best, and finally understood. It wasn't about the prize, or the judges, or the fame. It was about this. It was about connection. It was about making the people in your small corner of the world feel something.\n\nThe bottle of Prosecco was half-empty when he finally checked his emails. Tucked between work memos and spam was a message from a 'Phoenix Sound Studios'. The email was professional and to the point, detailing the prize: two full eight-hour days in a state-of-the-art studio with a house producer to record and mix two songs of his choice. They proposed a weekend a month from now. A month. It seemed both an age away and terrifyingly close. \"Two songs,\" he said out loud, the words feeling heavy and significant. \"What would I even sing?\" The first was obvious. 'Try a Little Tenderness' was his song now, the anthem of his transformation. But the second? He needed something that wasn't a showstopper, something that showed a different side. Something quieter, more intimate. He thought of his dad's words, of the Sunday mornings of his childhood. \"Claire,\" he said, turning to his sister, who was happily scrolling through comments on the pub video. \"Do you remember that Sam Cooke song Mum always used to sing when she was trying to get us to tidy our rooms? The one she'd change the words to?\" Claire looked up, her brow furrowed in concentration for a moment before her face lit up. \"A Change Is Gonna Come,\" she said, her voice soft. \"She used to sing 'A change is gonna come... to this messy bedroom'.\" The memory, so specific and so tender, was perfect. It was a song of struggle, but also of profound hope. It was a conversation with his mother, and a promise to himself.\n\nHe drove to his morning session a few days later, The Biscuit Tin rattling along the quiet Derbyshire lanes. The radio was on, playing some forgettable chart song, but Liam wasn't listening. He was humming, a low baritone rumble in his chest. He was working through the melody of 'A Change Is Gonna Come', feeling its gentle rise and fall, its quiet power. He pulled into the boathouse car park and saw Mark getting his boat off his car roof. Mark heard the humming as Liam got out of the car and grinned. \"Morning, Sculling Soulman. Warming up the golden pipes?\" Two months ago, the comment would have sent Liam into a spiral of self-conscious silence. This morning, he just smiled back. \"Got to, mate,\" he said, his voice easy and confident. \"Big session ahead.\" He walked towards the boathouse, the melody still on his lips, the cool morning air filling his lungs, ready for the work. He was no longer two halves of a person fighting for control. He was a rower. He was a singer. And for the first time, it felt like the most natural thing in the world."

                                        "text": "The week between the regatta and the recording session passed in a dreamlike haze. The gold medal, heavy and cool, sat on his mantelpiece, but it felt different from the others. It wasn't just a symbol of physical victory; it was a validation of his entire, chaotic journey. It was a tangible piece of proof that the Sculling Soulman was not a novelty act, but a formidable competitor. The win had cemented his status at the club, transforming him from a curiosity into a quiet leader. Younger rowers would ask him for advice, not just on technique, but on managing race-day nerves, their questions betraying a new respect for his mental fortitude. He found he had answers for them, speaking not in the cold, technical terms Dave used, but in metaphors of rhythm and focus that he was only just discovering himself. He was, to his own astonishment, becoming a mentor.\n\nHis first act with the prize money was a pilgrimage to a garage on the outskirts of Chesterfield, a place recommended by his dad, run by an old mechanic who allegedly spoke the language of failing engines. Liam left The Biscuit Tin with him, along with a significant portion of his winnings, feeling a strange pang of anxiety, like leaving a sick, elderly relative in a nursing home. He spent the rest of the week borrowing Claire\u2019s car, a sensible, silent Toyota that felt utterly devoid of character. The quiet hum of its modern engine only made him miss the familiar, complaining rattle of his own car. The Biscuit Tin, for all its faults, was part of his story, its percussive engine a backing track to his secret singing practice. He hoped the mechanic wouldn't fix the soul out of it.\n\nHe drove to Phoenix Sound Studios on a bright Saturday morning in Claire\u2019s unnervingly reliable car. The studio was located in a converted Victorian mill in a fashionable part of Sheffield, a world of exposed brickwork, artisan coffee shops, and people who looked effortlessly creative. It was a far cry from the functional brutality of Holme Pierrepont or the damp, earthy smell of the Chesterfield canal. Liam walked into the reception area, his old guitar case in one hand\u2014containing not a guitar, but a change of clothes and a packed lunch\u2014and felt a fresh wave of impostor syndrome. The walls were lined with gold and platinum discs, monuments to albums he had grown up with. This was a place where real musicians came, where magic was made, and he was a rower who had gotten lucky on a local TV show.\n\nA young man with bright pink hair and a friendly, open face came out to greet him. \"Liam? I'm Ben, the producer. Massive fan of your performance in the final, man. That was epic. Ready to make some noise?\" Ben\u2019s easy, unaffected enthusiasm was a welcome antidote to Liam\u2019s nerves. He led him through a corridor and into the main studio. The room took Liam\u2019s breath away. It was a huge, wood-panelled space, dominated by a grand piano and a forest of microphone stands. On the other side of a vast window was the control room, a dizzying array of buttons, faders, and screens that looked like the cockpit of a spaceship. It was both terrifying and beautiful. \"Right,\" Ben said, clapping his hands together. \"Let's get some levels. We'll start with 'Tenderness', get you warmed up with the big one. Just stand in the middle there, and sing a bit of the chorus for me.\"\n\nLiam stood in the centre of the cavernous room, a pair of heavy headphones over his ears. He felt small and exposed under the studio lights. He cleared his throat and sang the explosive climax of the song. The sound in his headphones was extraordinary. It was his own voice, but magnified, clarified, stripped of all echo and room noise. He could hear every breath, every tiny imperfection, every nuance of his tone. It was like seeing his reflection in a perfectly still lake for the first time. For a moment, he faltered, intimidated by the sheer clarity of the sound. \"That's great, mate, lovely warm tone,\" Ben's voice crackled in his ears from the control room. \"Don't be afraid of it. Just give it what you gave it on the telly. From the top.\" Liam took a deep breath, closed his eyes, and sang. He poured the memory of the stage lights, the roar of the crowd, and the recent victory at the regatta into the performance. He sang with a new confidence, a new control, the song feeling less like a desperate plea and more like a joyful declaration.\n\nThe day was a revelation. Ben was a genius, a patient and intuitive guide who knew exactly how to get the best out of him. He pushed Liam to try different phrasings, to experiment with the dynamics, to find the quiet vulnerability in the opening verses as well as the raw power in the climax. By lunchtime, they had a vocal take for 'Tenderness' that made the hairs on Liam\u2019s arms stand up. It was him, but it was bigger, better, the version of the song he had always heard in his head but had never quite been able to produce. After a lunch of Claire's cheese-and-pickle sandwiches, they moved on to 'A Change Is Gonna Come'. The atmosphere in the studio shifted. The energetic, rock-and-roll vibe was replaced by a quiet, almost reverent concentration.\n\nThis song was harder. It couldn\u2019t be conquered with power; it had to be inhabited with feeling. Liam\u2019s first few takes were technically sound but emotionally hollow. He was singing the notes, but he wasn't telling the story. \"Okay, let's take a break,\" Ben said, his voice calm and encouraging in the headphones. \"Tell me about this song. Why did you pick it?\" Liam, feeling strangely comfortable in the intimate space created by the headphones, found himself telling Ben about his mum, about the Sunday mornings, about her changing the lyrics to make him tidy his room. He spoke of his dad's reaction, of the feeling of bringing music back into a silent house. Ben listened without interrupting. \"Right,\" he said when Liam had finished. \"That's what the song is about. It's not about the civil rights movement, not for you. It's about your mum. It's about your dad. It's about Sunday morning. Forget the studio, forget me. Close your eyes and sing it to her.\"\n\nLiam stood in the silence of the vocal booth, the weight of the headphones a comforting presence. He closed his eyes and he was no longer in a Sheffield recording studio. He was a small boy again, standing in the doorway of his parents' kitchen, the smell of a roast in the air, the sound of his mother's voice, clear and happy, filling the room. He sang from that place. He sang with a quiet, trembling intensity, his voice imbued with a lifetime of love and loss. The performance was stripped bare of all artifice, a simple, heartbreakingly honest conversation with a memory. When he sang the final, hopeful line, \"It's been a long time coming, but I know a change is gonna come,\" his voice cracked with an emotion he didn't try to hide. He held the last note until it faded into the profound silence of the studio. For a long moment, there was no sound from the control room. Then, Ben's voice came through the headphones, thick with feeling. \"Yeah,\" he said softly. \"That's the one.\""

                                        "text": "A month slipped by, the seasons turning in that indecisive way of an English spring shifting towards summer. Life for Liam settled into a new kind of normal, a rhythm that was both familiar and fundamentally altered. The days were still marked by the early morning pilgrimage to the canal and the quiet hum of his office job designing drainage systems for the council, a profession so prosaic it felt like the perfect cover for a man with a secret life. But the secret was out, and the pressure that had built for years inside him had been released, leaving behind a sense of quiet confidence, a comfortable occupation of his own skin. He no longer felt like two people living in one body, but a single man with a wide and varied landscape inside him.\n\nThe email from Ben arrived on a Tuesday afternoon, a bright spot in the grey landscape of spreadsheets and technical drawings. The subject line was simple: *'Your Finished Tracks'*. Liam\u2019s heart gave a theatrical lurch. He waited until his colleagues had left for lunch before plugging his headphones into his computer, the office\u2019s low-level hum fading to nothing. He clicked the link for \u2018Try a Little Tenderness\u2019 first. The opening piano chords, crisp and clear, filled his ears. Then the bass and drums kicked in, warmer and richer than he remembered. Ben had worked his magic, adding subtle layers of organ and a richer, fuller horn section that made the track swell with a professional, radio-ready polish. And then his own voice entered, deep and resonant. He listened, utterly mesmerised, a strange sense of dissociation washing over him. It was him, undeniably, but it was a version of him amplified and illuminated, the sound of the man he had only just discovered he could be. He was listening to his own potential, recorded and mastered, and it was a humbling, exhilarating experience.\n\nWith a trembling finger, he clicked on the second track. The gentle, melancholic guitar intro of 'A Change Is Gonna Come' began, and the mood shifted instantly. Ben had kept the production sparse, creating a vast, intimate space around his voice. He had added a soft halo of strings that didn't appear until the second verse, lifting the melody like a gentle updraft. Liam closed his eyes, leaning back in his squeaky office chair, and was transported back to the vocal booth, to that quiet, sacred space where he had sung to his mother\u2019s memory. The recording had captured it all: the ache, the hope, the quiet tremor of unshed tears. The final, cracked note hung in the air and faded to silence, and Liam sat completely still for a full minute, a single tear tracing a path down his cheek before he hastily wiped it away, his chest tight with an emotion that was equal parts grief and gratitude.\n\nThat evening, he went to Claire's. The three of them, Liam, Claire, and a wildly excited Leo, huddled around his laptop in the living room like conspirators. He played 'Tenderness' first. Leo, who had been bouncing on the sofa, instantly launched into a frantic, flailing dance, using a cushion as an air guitar during the horn solos. Claire just watched the screen, her hand over her mouth, her eyes shining with tears of pure, unadulterated pride. \"Liam, it's... it's a proper record,\" she whispered, as if she couldn't quite believe it. Then he played 'A Change Is Gonna Come'. The effect was immediate. Leo\u2019s dancing ceased. He sat down quietly beside his mum, his usual whirlwind energy stilled by the song's solemn power. Claire\u2019s silent tears began to fall freely, and she reached out and squeezed his hand, a fierce, protective grip that said everything. There were no grand pronouncements, just a shared, sacred silence in the song\u2019s aftermath, a family listening to its own heart.\n\nThe next day, he went to his dad's. He didn't make a big announcement. He just walked into the living room where his dad was watching the afternoon racing and placed a small Bluetooth speaker on the coffee table. \"Just wanted you to hear this, Dad,\" he said, and pressed play. His dad didn't move from his armchair, his gaze remaining on the television where silent, brightly coloured horses were parading in a paddock. He didn't seem to be listening. 'Tenderness' filled the quiet room, its power and passion a stark contrast to the room's dusty, muted stillness. Then 'Change' began. As the opening chords played, Liam saw his dad's hand, resting on the arm of the chair, subtly begin to tap in time with the slow, deliberate rhythm. His gaze drifted from the television to a spot on the wall, a place of memory. He remained completely still until the very last note faded. The ticking of the mantelpiece clock was the only sound. \"It's good,\" his dad said finally, his voice gruff. He cleared his throat. \"Clear as a bell. You can hear all the words.\" He picked up the TV remote. \"Your mother would have liked that.\" It was all he said, but it was more than enough.\n\nOn Saturday morning, he got the call. The Biscuit Tin was ready. He took a bus to the garage on the industrial estate, a cavernous, oil-scented workshop run by a gnarled mechanic named Frank who looked like he had been assembled from spare engine parts. \"Right,\" Frank grunted, wiping his hands on a rag that had seen better decades. \"Your big end was shot. Skimmed the head, new gaskets, new water pump. Had to rebuild half the carburettor out of bits I had from an old Cortina.\" He looked at Liam with a kind of weary pity. \"She's a wreck, this thing. But she's got a bit of heart.\" He handed Liam the keys. \"Don't go thrashing her.\" Liam got into the familiar, worn driver's seat. He turned the key. The engine coughed once, then caught, settling not into its usual death-rattle, but into a steady, healthier thrum. The violent shaking was gone, but it wasn't silent. It still had its voice, a distinctive, gravelly rumble. It sounded like a grizzled old bluesman who'd given up whiskey but still smoked sixty a day.\n\nHe drove away from the garage, the car feeling more responsive, more alive. He merged onto the Chesterfield bypass, accelerating with a smoothness he hadn't felt in years. The sun was bright, the sky was a deep, cloudless blue, and the road was clear. He plugged his phone into the car's crackly stereo system and, for the first time, played his own finished songs in the car that had served as his first rehearsal room. As his own voice, clear and strong, filled the small, rattling space, a profound sense of rightness settled over him. The car was healed. He was healed. He was the Sculling Soulman, driving his beloved, battered Biscuit Tin into the wide, unknown territory of the rest of his life, the road ahead shimmering with possibility."

                                        "text": "Summer arrived in earnest, laying a thick, warm blanket over the Derbyshire hills and turning the water of the Chesterfield Canal a deep, lazy green. Liam\u2019s life, which had once been a rigid, monochrome routine of work and training, was now saturated with colour and complexity. His newfound local fame was a strange, low-level hum in the background of his days. He couldn\u2019t go for a pint in town or do a weekly shop without someone stopping him to talk about \u2018the show\u2019, their praise a warm but slightly discomfiting reminder of his public vulnerability. He was no longer just Liam Kenna; he was a story people told each other, a piece of shared local pride.\n\nClaire, revelling in her self-appointed role as his manager and publicist, insisted he had to make a return to the place where it had all started: the open mic night at The Rutland Arms. Liam was hesitant. The thought of performing there again felt different. Before, it had been a secret act of courage, a quiet test in a room full of strangers. Now, he knew the room would not be full of strangers. It would be full of people who had come specifically to see him, their expectations shaped by a dramatic, televised performance. The pressure felt immense, and he almost backed out, but Claire was relentless. \u201cIt\u2019s a thank you,\u201d she\u2019d insisted. \u201cTo the pub, to the people who supported you. You owe them a song, you big lump.\u201d\n\nThe Tuesday night he walked into the pub, the air was thick with anticipation. It was packed to the rafters, a buzzing, sweaty, cheerful crowd that spilled out into the beer garden. The usual handful of hopeful performers and their patient friends had been swallowed by a sea of familiar faces from every corner of his life. He saw his dad in a corner, nursing a pint, deep in an uncharacteristically animated conversation with Mark from the rowing club. He saw Mrs. Evans from the corner shop, and Frank the mechanic, who gave him a gruff nod. It felt less like a gig and more like a surprise party he was expected to provide the entertainment for. When the host, a genial man named Phil with a magnificent beard, called his name, a roar went up that made the glasses on the bar rattle.\n\nHe walked to the small, makeshift stage, his heart thumping a nervous rhythm against his ribs. He didn't bring a big production. He just nodded to the house guitarist, a talented player he'd spoken to earlier, and they began the gentle, soulful introduction to Bill Withers\u2019 \u2018Lovely Day\u2019. He chose it deliberately. It wasn't a showstopper; it wasn't a cry of pain or a desperate plea. It was a simple, joyful expression of gratitude. As he began to sing, a hush fell over the rowdy pub. He wasn't trying to impress anyone. He was just singing to his friends, to his neighbours, to his town. He looked out at the faces in the crowd, saw them smiling, saw them mouthing the words along with him. He sang the famous, impossibly long note in the middle of the song, holding it with the lung capacity of a national-level rower, and the crowd went wild, cheering him on, their energy lifting him, carrying him. When the song finished, the applause was warm, genuine, and deeply personal. It was the sound of belonging.\n\nHe stayed for the rest of the night, sipping a pint of ale, enjoying the anonymity that had returned now his \u2018turn\u2019 was over. He listened to the other performers\u2014a nervous young woman with a beautiful folk voice, a grizzled old bluesman on a harmonica\u2014with a new appreciation for their courage. As he was getting ready to leave, a woman approached him, her face vaguely familiar. She was older, with intelligent, sharp eyes and a cascade of silver hair. \"Liam Kenna?\" she asked, her voice quiet but clear. \"My name is Eleanor Vance. I help organise the Edale Folk & Blues Festival.\" The name registered immediately. It was one of the most respected small festivals in the North of England, a curated event known for its authenticity and high-quality musicianship. \"I was here tonight,\" she continued. \"A friend told me to come. I don't usually book acts based on TV competitions; they're often all flash and no substance. But what you have... it's genuine. It's honest.\" She handed him a business card. \"We have a spot on the main stage, Saturday afternoon. It\u2019s a paid slot. We\u2019d be honoured if you\u2019d consider it.\"\n\nLiam stared at the card in his hand, the embossed letters feeling heavy and significant. The Edale Festival. It wasn't a competition. It was an invitation to be considered a real artist, to share a bill with musicians he deeply admired. The thought was so overwhelming he felt dizzy. \"Thank you,\" he stammered. \"I... I'd have to check my schedule.\" Eleanor Vance smiled, a knowing, patient smile. \"I imagine you would. Your rowing schedule, I mean. The festival is the last weekend in July.\" The words hit Liam with the force of a physical blow. The last weekend in July. It was the same weekend as the Henley Royal Regatta, the most prestigious, most iconic, most important event in the British rowing calendar. For a competitive rower, Henley wasn't just another race; it was the ultimate goal, the culmination of a year's, or even a lifetime's, work. To be selected to race there was the pinnacle of the sport.\n\nHe drove home in The Biscuit Tin, the familiar rattle of the engine a counterpoint to the frantic buzzing in his mind. The old conflict, which he thought he had resolved, had returned with a vengeance, bigger and more complex than before. This wasn't a choice between a training camp and a TV final. This was a choice between the two highest peaks of his two separate worlds. To race at Henley was the rower's ultimate dream. To play on the main stage at Edale was a musician's dream he hadn't even dared to have. The two dreams could not coexist. The house of cards Claire had built for him for the final had been a one-time miracle; there was no way to be in two such demanding places, hundreds of miles apart, on the same weekend. He had to choose.\n\nThe next day, he found Dave by the boat racks, meticulously polishing an oar. Liam knew he had to address it head-on. \"Coach,\" he began, his voice steady. \"I've been offered a slot at the Edale Festival.\" Dave stopped polishing, but didn't look at him. \"Right,\" he said, his tone neutral. \"When is it?\" Liam took a breath. \"The last weekend of July.\" Dave slowly placed the oar down and finally turned to face him, his expression unreadable. \"Henley,\" he said. It wasn't a question. \"They're paying you?\" Liam nodded. \"It's a proper gig.\" Dave picked up his rag again, turning his attention back to the oar, his movements slow and deliberate. \"Well, Kenna,\" he said, his voice a low gravelly rumble that seemed to come from the centre of the earth. \"Looks like you have to decide what you are. Are you a professional rower who sings a bit? Or are you a professional singer who messes about in boats?\" He didn't say another word, but the weight of the choice, and of his coach\u2019s unspoken disappointment, settled on Liam\u2019s shoulders, heavy and suffocating. He walked home, opened his calendar, and stared at the two dates, circled in red, on opposing pages of his life. The choice was stark, brutal, and entirely his."

                                        "text": "The blade sliced the water, but the sound was no longer a clean rip in the silence. It was a dull thud, the sound of an obligation being met. The canal, his timeless confidante, felt different now, its surface reflecting not the dawn sky but the stark, binary choice that had fractured his world. Henley or Edale. The past or the future. The man he had built or the man he was discovering. Dave's words echoed with every stroke, a brutal, unforgiving rhythm that drowned out any melody. *Are you a professional rower who sings a bit? Or are you a professional singer who messes about in boats?* The question wasn't about scheduling; it was an interrogation of his very soul, and the water offered no answers, only a cold, indifferent reflection of his own turmoil.\n\nFor a decade, this rhythm had been the answer to everything. When he was stressed, he rowed. When he was grieving, he rowed. When he needed to feel strong, he rowed. The simple, punishing mechanics of the stroke had always been enough to scour his mind clean. But now, the magic was gone. The motion felt hollow, the burn in his muscles just a familiar ache, not a cleansing fire. He found himself looking at the banks, at the familiar trees and the distant smudge of the crooked spire, with the eyes of a tourist. He was a visitor in his own life, a ghost going through the motions. The thought of Henley, which should have been a blazing sun on his horizon, now felt like a colossal, crushing weight. It represented the culmination of everything he had worked for, the respect of his peers, the approval of his coach. To turn away from it felt like a betrayal, an act of profound self-sabotage. But the thought of turning down Edale, of letting that invitation to a new world expire, felt like a slow, quiet death. It was the closing of a door he had only just found the courage to open.\n\nHe tried to talk to Claire about it, but the conversation felt like a foregone conclusion. They sat in her small, chaotic garden, the late afternoon sun casting long shadows, while Leo chased a football around them. Liam laid out the impossible choice, and Claire, ever the pragmatist, saw no dilemma at all. \"Liam, it's not a choice,\" she said, her tone firm, as if explaining a simple sum to a struggling pupil. \"Henley is a race you've already won a dozen times in a dozen different boats. It's more of the same. More aching muscles, more 5 a.m. starts, more of Dave grunting at you. Edale... Edale is a beginning. It's a stage full of people who want to hear *you*, not just watch your back while you pull an oar. It's the world opening up for you. Rowing is what you're good at. Singing is what you love. When do you get to choose what you love?\" Her logic was flawless, her passion infectious, but it didn't ease the knot in his stomach. She saw it as a simple equation of head versus heart. She didn't feel the weight of ten years of loyalty, the phantom ache of blisters on his hands, or the heavy burden of Dave's conditional respect.\n\nThe conflict followed him home, a constant, low-level hum of anxiety. He stood in his living room, staring at the mantelpiece, a museum of his former life. He picked up his national championship medal, its weight familiar and substantial in his palm. He remembered the feeling of that win: the lung-searing agony of the final sprint, the explosion of relief at the finish line, the shared, exhausted triumph with his crewmates. It was a brutal, powerful joy. Then his gaze fell on the small, unassuming business card from Eleanor Vance, which he had propped against his mother's photograph. Edale. He imagined standing on that stage, not with a crew, but alone with a guitar and a microphone. He imagined the silence of a listening crowd in an open field, the sun setting behind the Peak District hills. He imagined the connection, the vulnerability, the quiet, profound joy of sharing a story through a song. It was a different kind of victory, one that couldn't be measured by a stopwatch.\n\nHe knew who he needed to talk to. He drove to his dad's house on a Thursday evening, finding him in the greenhouse at the bottom of the garden, tending to his tomato plants. The air was warm and smelled of earth and growing things. Liam didn't know how to begin. He ended up just stating the facts, his voice sounding flat and emotionless in the quiet greenhouse. \"I've been invited to race at Henley,\" he said, pinching a stray leaf from a plant. \"And I've been asked to sing at the Edale festival. They're on the same weekend.\" His dad continued his work, carefully tying a sagging stem to a cane. He didn't speak for a long time, his movements slow and methodical. \"Henley,\" he said finally, the name itself a recognition of its importance. \"That's the big one, isn't it? The one with the blazers.\" \"Yeah, Dad. That's the one.\" \"And this festival?\" \"That's a big one, too. For music.\" His dad finished tying the knot and straightened up, wiping his earthy hands on his trousers. He looked at Liam, his gaze direct and clear. \"When you were a lad,\" he began, \"you and your mother, you were always singing. She'd be in the kitchen, you'd be in the living room, singing back and forth to each other. I never understood half of it. But I understood the look on her face.\" He paused, looking past Liam, back into a memory. \"When you won your first big race, she was proud. Fit to burst. Told everyone she met. But when she heard you sing... proper sing, like at your cousin's wedding... she didn't just look proud. She looked... happy. Like a part of her she thought was lost had turned up in you.\" He picked up his watering can. \"There's a difference between what makes you proud and what makes you happy, lad. You've spent a long time making other people proud. Might be time to do what makes you happy.\"\n\nThe simple words, spoken without sentiment but with a profound, quiet truth, landed like a key turning in a lock. It was permission. Not just from his dad, but from the memory of his mother, from a part of himself he had kept quiet for too long. He drove home, the conflict gone, replaced by a calm, terrifying certainty. The decision was made. He sat at his kitchen table and composed an email to Eleanor Vance, his fingers moving with a newfound confidence. He accepted her offer. Then, he picked up the phone. The harder call was to Dave. But he knew it couldn't be a call. It had to be face to face.\n\nThe next morning, he found Dave in his office, staring at the crew lists pinned to the corkboard. Liam stood in the doorway, his heart a slow, heavy drum. He didn't wait for an invitation. \"Coach, I've made my decision,\" he said, his voice clear and steady. \"I won't be going to Henley. I'm going to sing at the festival.\" Dave didn't turn around. He remained staring at the board, his back a rigid wall of disapproval. \"I see,\" he said, his voice cold and flat. \"So you've decided. You're a singer.\" \"No,\" Liam said, taking a step into the room. \"I'm a man who is going to sing at a festival. It doesn't mean I'm not a rower. It just means I have to do this.\" Dave finally turned, and the look on his face was not anger, but a deep, weary disappointment that was infinitely worse. \"Rowing isn't something you just 'do', Kenna. Not at this level. It's everything. It demands everything. You can't be a part-time contender. It's all or nothing. I thought you understood that.\" He turned back to the corkboard, took a pen from his desk, and drew a single, thick, black line through Liam Kenna's name on the Henley crew list. The sound of the pen scratching across the paper was the only sound in the room, a brutal, final act of severance. \"The squad is my responsibility,\" Dave said, his back still to him. \"And the squad needs athletes who are fully committed. I wish you luck with your... music.\" The word was dropped like a stone. It was a dismissal. Liam stood for a moment, the finality of the act washing over him. He had made his choice, and the consequences were real and immediate. He felt a profound sense of loss, a grief for the life he was leaving behind. But underneath it, buried deep, was a flicker of something else. A terrifying, exhilarating spark of freedom. \"Thank you, coach,\" he said quietly to the man's unrelenting back. Then he turned and walked out of the boathouse, leaving a decade of his life behind him, stepping out into the bright, uncertain light of a future he would have to write himself."

Liam stood in the car park, the morning sun feeling unnaturally bright and hostile on his face. The familiar, comforting scent of river water and damp earth was replaced by the acrid smell of tarmac and exhaust fumes. He felt profoundly out of place, a deep-sea creature suddenly stranded on a sun-bleached beach. His car keys felt heavy and useless in his hand. He couldn\u2019t get in The Biscuit Tin, couldn't drive away. That would be an escape, an admission of defeat. He needed to walk, to feel the solid ground beneath his feet, to process the tectonic shift that had just occurred. He turned not towards the road, but towards the canal towpath, the path he had pounded into submission on a thousand pre-dawn runs.\n\nHe walked for miles, a man in a trance. The path was different from this perspective, at this time of day. It was alive with dog walkers, cheerful cyclists, and families feeding the ducks. They moved through a world of casual leisure, oblivious to the fact that they were treading on his church, his battlefield. He was an observer now, an outsider looking in. He saw a novice crew from the club out on the water, their movements clumsy and uncoordinated, their coach shouting encouragement from a bicycle. A wave of something that felt painfully like pity, both for them and for himself, washed over him. They were at the beginning of the journey he had just been ejected from. He watched them until they were out of sight, then sat on a cold stone bench, the same bench where Dave had once told him he had the makings of a champion. He stared at the slow-moving, indifferent water, the surface a murky green-brown, no longer a pristine track but just a neglected waterway cutting through the heart of the country. He had given it ten years of his life, his sweat and his soul, and it had taken it all without comment. It owed him nothing. The freedom he had felt a flicker of in Dave\u2019s office was, out here in the open, a vast, terrifying emptiness.\n\nHe ended up at Claire's, drawn by an instinct for sanctuary. She opened the door, took one look at his pale, drawn face, and her triumphant smile faltered. \"Oh, Liam,\" she said, her voice soft with a sympathy that was almost his undoing. She led him into the kitchen and made him a mug of tea so strong it could have dissolved the spoon. He told her what had happened, the words coming out in a flat, detached monotone. He told her about the black line Dave had drawn through his name, the finality of it, the cold dismissal. Claire listened, her expression hardening from sympathy to a fierce, protective anger. \"Good,\" she said, when he had finished, slamming the sugar bowl down on the table. \"Good riddance to him. And to all of it. Liam, that place was a cage, and you were too big for it. You just couldn't see it. He didn't kick you out. You outgrew him. You outgrew the whole damn sport.\" Her certainty was a comfort, a warm blanket thrown over his shivering shoulders, but it didn't quite reach the cold spot deep inside him, the place that was grieving the loss of his tribe, the death of the man he had been.\n\nThe next morning, the digital alarm on his bedside table blared its shrill, familiar summons at 5:00 a.m. For a fraction of a second, his body responded with the ingrained muscle memory of a decade. His legs tensed, his mind snapping into a state of pre-dawn readiness, already calculating the air temperature and the river conditions. Then, reality hit him like a physical blow. He didn't have to go. There was no water waiting, no boat to rig, no coach to appease. The purpose that had dragged him from his bed every morning for ten years was gone. He reached out and slapped the snooze button, but the silence that followed was more jarring than the alarm had been. It was a cavernous, empty silence, filled with the ghost of a life he no longer lived. He lay in the darkness, feeling the absence of the familiar pre-training aches in his muscles. His body felt alien, rested and unprepared for a battle that was no longer his to fight. The freedom he had chosen felt, in the stark reality of this new, unstructured dawn, like a profound and terrifying loneliness.\n\nHe eventually got up, not to row, but because lying in bed felt like a surrender. He made tea and sat in his quiet living room as the pale grey light of dawn seeped through the curtains. The house felt too big, the morning too long. The empty hours stretched before him, a vast, uncharted territory. His gaze fell on his guitar, propped in the corner. It looked less like a hobby now and more like a tool, a piece of equipment for a job he had only just started. He picked it up, the smooth wood of the neck cool and solid in his hand. He didn't play a song. He just played chords, simple, open chords, letting them ring out and fill the silence. E major. A major. G. He wasn't performing, wasn't practicing. He was just making a sound, a deliberate act of filling the void, of replacing the old rhythm with a new one. The squeak of the oarlocks was gone. The rhythmic gasp of his own breath on the water was gone. There was only this: the vibration of six steel strings against his fingertips, a small, hopeful noise in the quiet of a new day.\n\nThe official contract from the Edale festival arrived in his inbox a few days later, a stark, professional document that made it all terrifyingly real. A forty-five-minute set on the main stage. He scrolled through his phone's music library, a collection of beloved songs that now looked like a dauntingly small pool of material. He could play for fifteen, maybe twenty minutes, but forty-five? He needed more songs, more variety, more substance. He needed a band. The thought was paralyzing. He was a solitary creature, a single sculler used to the monastic discipline of training alone. The idea of collaborating, of relying on other people, of leading a group, was entirely alien. But the choice had been made, and the path led forward, not back. He thought of the open mic night, of the easy confidence of the house guitarist. Phil, the host, had called him Jamie. With a sense of leaping into the void, Liam found the number for The Rutland Arms and asked for him.\n\nHe met Jamie in a different pub, a musician's haunt in the centre of Sheffield with sticky floors and a jukebox full of classic rock. Jamie was younger than him by at least ten years, with bright, intelligent eyes and the restless energy of someone whose fingers were always itching to play. Liam, feeling like a giant in the small, crowded room, explained the situation, the words feeling clunky and inadequate. He felt like a fraud, a rower playing dress-up in a musician's world. But Jamie listened with an infectious enthusiasm, his eyes lighting up when Liam mentioned Edale. \"Mate, that's huge! Their main stage is legendary. So, you need a band?\" Liam nodded, feeling a blush creep up his neck. \"I don't know the first thing about it.\" Jamie grinned, a wide, easy smile. \"Don't worry about that. That's the easy part. I know a rhythm section that's tighter than a submarine door. A bassist, Steve, and a drummer, Chloe. They're amazing. We've been looking for a proper singer, someone with real pipes, not another indie kid mumbling into his fringe.\" The casual compliment landed with surprising force. *A proper singer.* It was a validation from a world he was desperate to belong to. \"Let's have a jam,\" Jamie said, pulling a notebook from his pocket. \"Let's see what we can build.\"\n\nTheir first rehearsal was in a dingy, soundproofed room above a Sheffield pub, a space that smelled of stale beer, old carpets, and electricity. It was chaotic and loud. Chloe, the drummer, sat behind a battered kit, a whirlwind of focused energy, while Steve, the bassist, stood quietly, a calm anchor in the sonic storm, his fingers dancing effortlessly on the fretboard. Liam felt utterly out of his depth. He was used to silence and solitude, to the clean, straight lines of a race course. This was a messy, collaborative art, a conversation shouted in a language of chords and drum fills. They tried 'Try a Little Tenderness' first, and it was a train wreck. Liam was used to singing it with a polished house band that followed his lead; this was different. This was a negotiation. They stopped and started, the song falling apart as they struggled to find a common rhythm. Liam felt a surge of panic, a feeling of total incompetence. But Jamie just laughed. \"Alright, let's take it from the build-up. Chloe, watch him. He sings like a boxer. Follow his breathing.\" They tried again. Jamie hit the chords, Chloe came in with a thunderous, rolling fill, and Steve locked into a groove that was a solid, pulsing heartbeat. Liam took a breath and sang, and this time, the band was with him. They weren't just backing him; they were lifting him, pushing him, answering his vocal lines with their own musical declarations. He felt the raw power of it, a force far greater than his own, a surge of energy that was like catching a perfect stroke with three other rowers in perfect sync. It was a different kind of boat, a different kind of crew, but the feeling of shared, explosive power was the same.\n\nHe drove home from the rehearsal late that night, his ears ringing and his throat raw from pushing his voice over the joyful noise of a full band. The Biscuit Tin\u2019s radio was off, the silence a welcome relief. He was tired, but it was a new kind of tired, a creative exhaustion that buzzed with energy rather than leaden fatigue. He pulled over at his usual vantage point, the quiet lane overlooking the sleeping town. For weeks, this spot had been a place of turmoil and difficult decisions. Tonight, it felt different. He looked out at the familiar pattern of orange streetlights and dark rooftops, the crooked spire a steadfast silhouette against a starry sky. He thought of the rowing club, of Dave, of the black line through his name. The ache of that loss was still there, a faint, phantom limb of a past life. But it was no longer the dominant feeling. It was being replaced by the thrill of the new, the terror and excitement of the path he was now on. He was no longer a rower mourning his past. He was a singer, and he had a festival to prepare for. He had a band to lead. He put the car in gear and drove towards home, a new set of rhythms playing in his head, a new set of proving grounds waiting."

                                        "text": "The weeks leading up to the Edale festival took on a rhythm of their own, a vibrant, chaotic cadence that was a world away from the metronomic precision of his rowing life. Liam\u2019s mornings were no longer defined by the shrill scream of a 5 a.m. alarm and the cold shock of canal water. He still rose early, the discipline of a decade too deeply ingrained to abandon, but his purpose had shifted. Instead of the towpath, he took to the trails of the Linacre Woods, running not against a stopwatch but for the simple, burning pleasure of it, his lungs expanding, his heart hammering out a steady beat. He was still an athlete, but his body was no longer just an engine for propulsion; it was an instrument he was learning to tune for a different kind of endurance, the stamina to hold a note, to command a stage, to give a forty-five-minute performance his all. He ran with music in his headphones, not as a distraction, but as a study, dissecting arrangements, internalising rhythms, his mind a constant, buzzing workshop of musical ideas.\n\nThe rehearsal space above the pub became their boathouse, their proving ground. It was a cramped, stuffy room that perpetually smelled of the ghosts of spilled beer and forgotten cigarettes, the walls covered in egg cartons that did a questionable job of soundproofing. But within those four walls, a kind of magic began to happen. The initial chaos of four musicians trying to find a common language slowly coalesced into a dynamic, a conversation. Liam, used to the clear, hierarchical structure of a rowing squad, struggled at first with the messy democracy of a band. He found it difficult to articulate the sounds he heard in his head, often falling back on the only vocabulary he had. \u201cIt needs more\u2026 drive here,\u201d he\u2019d say, gesturing with his hands. \u201cLike the beginning of the stroke, that first big leg push.\u201d Jamie, ever the enthusiastic translator, would grin. \u201cYou mean you want the bass and drums to really lean into the downbeat? Hit it hard?\u201d And Chloe, from behind her fortress of cymbals, would unleash a thunderous fill that was exactly the right kind of power, making Liam break into a grateful smile.\n\nThey built their setlist piece by piece, an exercise in shared archaeology, digging up classic soul and R&B gems and breathing new life into them. They transformed Wilson Pickett\u2019s \u2018In the Midnight Hour\u2019 into a gritty, blues-stomp, and found a swampy, menacing groove in Bill Withers\u2019 \u2018Who Is He (And What Is He to You)?\u2019. Steve, the quiet bassist, proved to be their secret weapon, a walking encyclopaedia of music who would suggest a subtle chord change or a different bassline that would unlock an entire song. But their biggest breakthrough came not from a cover, but from a moment of pure, unplanned creation. During a break, while Liam was sipping a bottle of water, Jamie started playing a simple, melancholic guitar riff, a phrase that felt like a question mark hanging in the dusty air. Without thinking, Liam began to hum along, a low, soulful melody taking shape over the chords. The words that emerged were simple, drawn from the landscape of his old life. *\u201cWater like glass, a grey morning sky\u2026 another mile to go before the sun gets high\u2026\u201d*\n\nThe room fell silent. Jamie\u2019s fingers stilled on the strings. Chloe and Steve looked at him, their expressions a mixture of surprise and intense interest. \"What was that, mate?\" Jamie asked, his voice soft. Liam felt a hot blush of self-consciousness, the feeling of having been caught in a private moment. \"Nothing. Just messing about,\" he mumbled, turning back to his water. \"No,\" Steve said, his quiet voice cutting through the awkwardness. \"That was something. Play the riff again, Jamie.\" Jamie obliged, and this time, Liam, nudged by their expectant silence, sang the lines again, his voice hesitant at first, then growing in confidence. Chloe joined in with a soft, subtle beat on the ride cymbal, a gentle pulse like a distant train. Steve added a low, looping bassline that gave the melody an anchor. It wasn't a song yet. It was a sketch, a feeling, a fragment of a new story. But it was *his*. For the first time, he wasn't just interpreting someone else's truth; he was beginning to articulate his own. They worked on it for an hour, building a structure, finding a chorus, the music flowing from a place of genuine, collaborative excitement. They called it 'Canal Song'.\n\nThe world outside the rehearsal room continued to turn, and one Saturday afternoon, while loading groceries into the boot of Claire\u2019s car, Liam saw a familiar figure jogging towards him. It was Mark, his old rowing partner, his face leaner and more strained than Liam remembered. The encounter was awkward, a meeting of ghosts from different timelines. \"Liam! Blimey, didn't recognise you without an oar in your hand,\" Mark panted, slowing to a stop. \"Heard you're a rock star now. How's it going?\" The question was friendly, but tinged with a curiosity that felt like a probe. \"It's going alright,\" Liam said, leaning against the car. \"We're playing Edale in a few weeks.\" \"Edale, right,\" Mark nodded, his eyes flicking away. \"We're at Henley next weekend. Dave's got us on a brutal schedule. Killing us. We could have used your weight in the eight.\" The words hung in the air, a casual statement that landed like a small, sharp stone. A pang of guilt, of nostalgia for the simple camaraderie of the crew, hit Liam unexpectedly. \"Good luck,\" Liam said, and was surprised by the sincerity in his own voice. \"I hope you win.\" Mark gave him a strange look, a mixture of gratitude and confusion. \"Cheers, mate. You too. Break a leg, or whatever it is you lot say.\" He jogged off, leaving Liam standing in the supermarket car park, feeling the last, fraying thread connecting him to his old life finally snap.\n\nThe final rehearsal before the festival was less a practice and more a declaration of intent. They ran through the entire forty-five-minute set, from the explosive opening of 'Hold On, I'm Comin'' to the quiet, soulful encore of 'Canal Song'. They were no longer four separate musicians; they were a single entity, a tight, powerful unit that breathed and moved as one. They crashed through the final chords of their last song, the sound ringing out in the small, sweaty room, and ended in a sudden, breathless silence. They looked at each other, grinning, exhausted, and united by the shared, electric thrill of creation. They had done the work. They had found their sound. They were a band. \"Well,\" Jamie said, wiping sweat from his brow with the back of his hand. \"I reckon we're ready to scare some folk singers.\" Liam laughed, a deep, easy sound of pure joy. He felt a familiar ache in his muscles and a satisfying rawness in his throat. It was the feeling of having given everything, of having left it all on the floor. He was ready. He was no longer a rower who sang, or a singer who used to row. He was Liam Kenna, and he had a festival to play."

                                        "text": "The air in the Hope Valley tasted different. It was cleaner, sharper, scented with wild thyme, damp earth, and the distant, enticing aroma of woodsmoke and fried onions. Gone was the familiar, brackish tang of the canal; this was the air of mountains and open spaces, of freedom and possibility. The Edale festival was not just an event; it was a temporary, sprawling city of canvas and colour, pitched in a vast green bowl of a valley and thrumming with a bohemian, life-affirming energy. Colourful flags snapped in the breeze, and the low, rolling thunder of a distant soundcheck mixed with the laughter of children and the gentle cadence of a hundred different conversations. Liam, navigating the crowded, slightly muddy pathways with his bandmates, felt a world away from the manicured lawns and rigid etiquette of a regatta. This was a gathering of tribes, but the uniforms were tie-dye and worn denim, not lycra and club blazers, and the competition was a joyful battle of melodies, not a grim war of attrition against a stopwatch.\n\nThey made their way to the main stage, a colossal structure of steel scaffolding and black canvas that seemed to have landed from another planet in the middle of the picturesque valley. It was far bigger than Liam had imagined, a huge, yawning mouth that would soon demand to be filled with sound. Standing at the side of it, looking out at the empty field where thousands of people would soon gather, he felt a familiar, cold spike of fear, a dizzying sense of vertigo. But it was different from the solitary terror of the Voice of the Peaks final. He wasn't alone. Jamie clapped him on the shoulder, a wide, excited grin on his face. \u201cBit bigger than The Rutland, eh?\u201d Chloe was methodically taping her fingers, her expression one of intense, professional focus, while Steve was quietly tuning his bass, a small, calm smile on his lips. They were a crew, facing their Henley, and the shared sense of purpose was a powerful anchor against the rising tide of his nerves.\n\nBackstage was a controlled, friendly chaos. Roadies in black t-shirts moved with practiced efficiency, coiling cables and checking microphones. Seasoned musicians with faces like road maps and guitars that bore the scars of a thousand gigs nodded a hello as they passed. There was no glitter, no hairspray, just a deep, unspoken respect for the craft. Liam found his family huddled by a catering tent, looking slightly overwhelmed but thrilled. Leo was staring, wide-eyed, at a man with a beard down to his chest who was playing a mandolin. Claire hugged him tightly, her nervous energy a vibrating current. \u201cYou okay? You\u2019re not going to be sick, are you?\u201d she whispered fiercely. Liam shook his head, a smile touching his lips. And then he saw his dad, standing slightly apart from the backstage bustle, holding a plastic cup of tea and looking distinctly out of place in his sensible slacks and clean windbreaker. He looked at Liam, then at the huge, empty stage, then back again. He didn\u2019t offer words of encouragement. He just held out a bottle of water he\u2019d been keeping for him. \u201cYou\u2019ll be needing this,\u201d was all he said. Liam took it, their hands brushing, the simple, practical gesture a more profound expression of support than any speech could have been.\n\nThe forty-five minutes before their set was a blur. They were led to the stage by a cheerful woman with a clipboard. The field was no longer empty; it was a vast, sprawling sea of humanity, a kaleidoscope of picnic blankets, camping chairs, and expectant faces under the bright afternoon sun. This was no darkened auditorium where the audience was an anonymous void. He could see them. He could see their faces, their expressions of curiosity, their smiles. There was nowhere to hide. He took his place at the centre microphone, the stage feeling as wide as a football pitch. He glanced back at Chloe, who gave him a sharp, confident nod. To his left, Steve gave him a thumbs-up. To his right, Jamie grinned, hit a single, loud, defiant chord on his guitar, and the sound exploded from the giant speakers, a declaration that they had arrived. And then Chloe\u2019s drums kicked in, a thunderous, irresistible beat, and they launched into the explosive opening of \u2018Hold On, I\u2019m Comin\u2019\u2019.\n\nFor the first few moments, Liam was just a passenger, carried along by the sheer power of the band. The sound was immense, a physical force that vibrated through the floorboards of the stage and into the soles of his feet. He opened his mouth and let his voice ride on top of it, a raw, joyful roar that felt like a release of every ounce of pent-up energy and anxiety he possessed. He saw the crowd react, saw their heads turn, saw a ripple of surprise and interest spread through the field. He saw people who had been lying on their blankets sit up, their attention captured. He wasn't just a big man with a surprisingly soulful voice anymore; he was the frontman of a tight, powerful, blues-drenched rock and roll band, and they were a force to be reckoned with. They crashed through the first two songs, a high-octane medley that demanded a physical response, and by the third song, a slinky, groove-laden version of \u2018Who Is He (And What Is He to You)?\u2019, a space had opened up at the front of the crowd, and people were dancing, a fluid, joyful mass moving to the rhythm they were creating.\n\nHe felt himself relax into it, the performance becoming a conversation, not a test. He moved with the music, feeding off the energy of his bandmates, catching Jamie\u2019s eye and grinning as the guitarist unleashed a blistering solo. He watched Chloe, a blur of motion and concentration, driving the beat forward with a ferocious intensity. He felt Steve\u2019s bassline, a solid, unshakeable foundation that allowed him the freedom to soar. They were a single, living organism, speaking a language of pure, unfiltered emotion. And then, it was time. The high-energy songs faded, and a quiet anticipation settled over the field. Jamie switched to his acoustic guitar, playing the simple, questioning riff they had discovered in the rehearsal room. Liam stepped closer to the microphone, the vast crowd seeming to lean in as one. \u201cThis is a new song,\u201d he said, his voice quiet but carrying across the field. \u201cIt\u2019s one of ours. It\u2019s about the place I\u2019m from, and the life I used to know. It\u2019s called \u2018Canal Song\u2019.\u201d\n\nHe sang, and the story of his old life, of the grey dawns and the silent, solitary work, filled the warm summer air of the Hope Valley. The lyrics were a watercolour painting of a world he had left behind, full of images of tearing silk and misty mornings, of aching muscles and the relentless rhythm of the stroke. He sang not with regret, but with a deep, tender understanding, a farewell to the man he had been. The crowd fell utterly silent, a field of thousands holding a collective breath. They weren\u2019t just listening to a song; they were hearing a confession, a testimony, a story of transformation. In the quietest moments of the song, the only sound was his voice, the gentle strum of the guitar, and the whisper of the wind in the festival banners. He was laying his soul bare, not in a theatre under the glare of competitive lights, but in a field, under an open sky, in front of a community of strangers. It was the most honest thing he had ever done.\n\nWhen the final, gentle chord faded into the afternoon air, the silence held for a beat, a moment of profound, shared resonance. Then, the applause came. It wasn\u2019t the explosive, percussive roar of the TV final. It was a wave, a swell of deep, heartfelt appreciation that grew and grew, washing over the stage. He saw Eleanor Vance at the side of the stage, her arms crossed, a small, profound smile on her face. They finished their set with a triumphant, joyful rendition of \u2018Lovely Day\u2019, the entire field singing the chorus back at him, their voices joining his in a huge, harmonious choir. He walked off stage, his legs trembling, his shirt soaked through with sweat, his throat raw, and fell into the waiting, triumphant hugs of his band. They had done it. They had flown.\n\nLater, he stood in the middle of the crowd with his family, just another face in the sea of festival-goers, watching another band on the main stage. The setting sun painted the clouds in shades of pink and orange, the same colours he used to see mirrored on the surface of the canal at dawn. Leo was asleep on his shoulder, a small, warm weight of pure contentment. Claire was leaning against him, her face glowing with happiness. His dad stood beside him, holding a plastic cup of beer, watching the band on stage with a look of quiet concentration. During a break in the music, his dad turned to him. He didn't speak. He just looked at Liam, a long, searching look, and then he raised his plastic cup in a small, almost imperceptible toast. It was a gesture of acknowledgement, of respect, of a quiet, hard-won pride. Liam raised his own bottle of water in return, a silent understanding passing between them. Miles away, in the manicured grounds of Henley-on-Thames, boats were being racked, medals were being awarded, and a life he once thought was his everything was concluding without him. He felt no loss, no regret. He was here, in a field in Derbyshire, surrounded by his family and a new tribe, his ears ringing with music, his heart full. He had found his finish line. It wasn't a line on the water. It was a stage, a song, and a new, wide-open horizon."
