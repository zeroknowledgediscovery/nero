     "novel_text": "The rain came down in sheets, not cleansing, never cleansing in this city, but simply moving the grime around. From his third-floor window, Peter watched the water turn the back court into a slick, grey mirror reflecting a sky the colour of a day-old bruise. The world was a tenement square, bounded by soot-stained sandstone and the private lives stacked one on top of the other, all breathing the same coal-thick air. And across that square, directly opposite, was Ewan\u2019s window. A mirror to his own.\n\nMost days, it was just a dark rectangle. But sometimes, especially in the gloaming when the lights began to flicker on, he\u2019d see a silhouette. A shape moving, broad-shouldered and quick. Ewan. The name was a secret currency Peter traded only with himself, a smooth, worn coin in the pocket of his mind. He\u2019d been there six months, renting the room from old Mrs Gable, and in that time, he\u2019d rewired the whole of Peter\u2019s small world. It wasn\u2019t a thing Ewan had done, not actively. It was in the way he\u2019d take the stairs two at a time, the sound of his boots on the stone a kind of brutalist music. It was in the rare, lopsided smile he\u2019d throw over his shoulder if he caught Peter watching from the landing. It was in the smell of woodsmoke and something sharp, like pine, that clung to his jacket, a scent of forests and open spaces that had no place here in the Gallowgate.\n\nPeter worked at the shipyards, a place of noise and fire, of men shouting over the shriek of metal being rent and tortured into shape. He came home each night with a ringing in his ears and a fine dust of steel in his hair, in his throat. He\u2019d wash at the sink in the kitchen, the cold water failing to scrub the feeling of it all away. Then he would sit with a book, borrowed and dog-eared, and try to find a silence the yard hadn\u2019t stolen. But the real quiet, the only quiet that mattered, came from watching the window opposite. It was a meditation. A prayer to a god he wasn't sure he believed in, for a thing he was sure he was not allowed to want.\n\nOne Tuesday, the sky weeping a miserable, persistent drizzle, the meeting happened. Not at the window, but in the close, the cavernous, echoing stairwell that smelled of damp and boiled cabbage. Peter was heading out for messages, his coat collar turned up against the chill, when the main door swung open and Ewan stumbled in, laughing. He wasn't alone. A girl, her hair the colour of cheap butter, was clinging to his arm, her own laughter a high, sharp sound that scraped against the stone walls. Peter froze on the landing, halfway down.\n\nEwan saw him. His laughter didn't stop, but it changed. It became something performed. \"Alright, Peter?\" he called up, his voice booming in the enclosed space. The girl giggled and hid her face in Ewan's shoulder.\n\n\"Aye,\" Peter managed, his own voice a dry whisper. He felt like an intruder, a ghost at their feast. He forced his feet to move, to carry him down the last few steps, past them. The scent of Ewan was stronger here, mixed with the girl's cloying perfume. It made his stomach clench. He didn't look at them as he passed, just stared at the tiled floor, at the intricate, grimy pattern of fleurs-de-lis worn smooth by a century of feet. He pushed the heavy door and escaped into the rain, the cold a welcome shock against his hot face. He didn't know why it felt like a betrayal. Ewan was a stranger. Less than a stranger. He was a shape in a window. A sound on the stairs. But the feeling was there all the same, a cold stone in his gut.\n\nHe walked without purpose, past the pub where the men were already escaping the day, past the butcher\u2019s with its grim, pale carcasses, past the baker\u2019s whose warmth couldn\u2019t reach him. He thought he could walk it off, this feeling. But it clung to him, as persistent as the Glasgow damp. When he finally returned, the close was empty. The ghost of perfume and laughter was gone. There was only the familiar scent of boiled vegetables and, fainter now, the lingering hint of pine. He climbed the stairs slowly, his boots heavy. As he reached his own door, he saw it. Leaning against the jamb, a single, hand-rolled cigarette. It was Ewan's. He always had one tucked behind his ear. Peter looked around. The landings above and below were empty. The silence was absolute. He picked it up. It was still a little damp from the air, but the tobacco was dry. A peace offering? An apology? Or just a dropped cigarette? He didn\u2019t know. But he slipped it into his pocket, and it felt like a key.\n\nLater, when the city was dark and the only sounds were a distant siren and the lonely clatter of a late-night tram, he stood at his window. He smoked the cigarette, letting the unfamiliar taste of the cheap, strong tobacco coat his tongue. He didn't cough. He smoked it like he'd been doing it his whole life. And as he watched the smoke curl and vanish into the blackness, a light flickered on in the window opposite. Ewan\u2019s silhouette appeared. He stood there for a moment, looking out. Looking, Peter was certain, right at him. Peter\u2019s heart hammered against his ribs, a frantic bird in a cage. He didn't move, didn't breathe. He just stood there, a boy in a window, with a stolen cigarette and a secret hope that was as dangerous and beautiful as a shard of broken glass. And across the chasm of the back court, Ewan raised a hand in a slow, deliberate wave.\n\nThe wave changed everything. It was a thread thrown across the void, and Peter grasped it with all the strength of his lonely soul. The next day, he didn't just listen for Ewan\u2019s boots on the stairs; he waited for them. He timed his own departure for the yard to coincide, manufacturing an accident. It was clumsy. He almost fell over him on the first-floor landing.\n\n\"Whoa there, lad. In a hurry to get to the fire and brimstone?\" Ewan's voice was amused, a low rumble that vibrated through the floor. He steadied Peter with a hand on his arm. His grip was firm, warm through the thin fabric of Peter\u2019s shirt. The contact was a jolt, a brand.\n\n\"Sorry. Daydreaming,\" Peter mumbled, his face burning. He could smell the pine scent again, clean and sharp.\n\n\"Aye, you do a lot of that,\" Ewan said, but there was no mockery in it. His eyes, the colour of peat smoke, held Peter\u2019s for a second too long. \"Walk with me a bit.\" It wasn't a question. They walked out of the tenement and into the pale morning light, falling into step beside each other. The street was already teeming with men heading for the yards and the factories, a river of grey caps and weary shoulders. But for Peter, it was a bubble of silence with Ewan at its centre.\n\n\"Saw you last night,\" Ewan said, not looking at him, his gaze fixed ahead. \"At your window.\"\n\n\"I was just\u2026\"\n\n\"It\u2019s alright.\" Ewan gave that lopsided smile, a flash of white in his tanned face. \"Good to know someone\u2019s keeping watch.\" He said it like a joke, but his tone was serious. They didn't talk much more, just walked. But it was a conversation all the same. The rhythm of their steps, the way Ewan angled himself slightly, as if to shield Peter from the jostling crowd, the shared glances at a headline on a news-seller's board about troops and borders. When they reached the corner where their paths diverged, Ewan to the delivery depot and Peter to the inferno of the shipyards, Ewan stopped.\n\n\"Tonight,\" he said, his voice low, for Peter\u2019s ears only. \"The roof. After it\u2019s dark.\"\n\nPeter just nodded, his throat too tight for words. The rest of the day was a dream. The roar of the yard was a distant hum, the molten rivets arcing through the air were slow, lazy fireflies. He moved like an automaton, his body performing the tasks his mind had long since abandoned. His mind was on the roof. The roof was a place of myth, accessed by a rusty ladder in the top-floor washhouse. It was a windswept desert of slate and lead, dotted with chimney pots that exhaled the building\u2019s smoky breath. It was a place to be alone, above everything. To be there with Ewan felt like a transgression of a different order entirely.\n\nWhen night fell, he waited until the sounds of the tenement settled, until the shouts and the wireless radios faded into a low murmur. He crept up the stairs, his heart a frantic drum against his ribs. The ladder was cold and slick with damp. He climbed, emerging into the vast, cold darkness of the Glasgow night. The city was spread out below, a carpet of scattered, smudgy lights under a starless, cloud-heavy sky. And Ewan was there, a dark shape against the lesser dark, sitting on the coping stones, his legs dangling over the edge.\n\n\"Thought you might not come,\" Ewan said, his voice quiet, almost carried away by the wind that swept across the slates.\n\n\"You said to,\" Peter replied, the words simple, but they held the weight of a vow. He walked over and sat beside Ewan, careful not to look down at the sheer drop to the back court.\n\n\"Look at it,\" Ewan gestured out at the city. \"Like a spilled jar of embers. All that life down there. All those people in their little boxes. And they haven't a clue we're up here.\" He turned to look at Peter, and in the faint, reflected glow from the city, his eyes were deep and serious. \"Do you ever want to just\u2026 fly away from it, Peter?\"\n\n\"There's nowhere to fly to,\" Peter said, his voice barely a whisper.\n\n\"There's always somewhere.\" Ewan\u2019s gaze was intense. He reached out, not quickly, but with a slow deliberation that gave Peter a universe of time to pull away. He didn't. Ewan's fingers brushed a stray lock of hair from Peter\u2019s forehead. The touch was feather-light, yet it anchored him to the spot. \"I don\u2019t want to fly away from all of it,\" Ewan said, his voice dropping even lower, a rough, intimate sound. \"Not all of it.\" And then he leaned in, and the world dissolved into the press of his lips against Peter's. It was not like the kiss he had imagined. It was better. It was softer, more questioning. It tasted of tobacco and the cold night air, and it was the first true thing that had ever happened to him. When they broke apart, the city lights below seemed to blur and swim, and Peter knew, with a terrifying certainty, that he was lost. Or found. He wasn't sure which. He only knew he was Ewan's.The silence that followed was more profound than any quiet Peter had ever known. It was not an absence of sound\u2014the city still hummed its ceaseless, mechanical lullaby, the wind still whispered over the slates\u2014but an absence of noise in his own head. The ringing from the shipyard was gone. The anxious static of his own thoughts was gone. There was only the solid warmth of Ewan beside him, the lingering taste of him, and the dizzying panorama of the lights below that no longer looked like a spilled jar of embers, but like a promise. He felt Ewan\u2019s thumb trace a slow line along his jaw, a simple, grounding gesture that said more than words ever could. It said, *I am here. This is real.*\n\n\"See?\" Ewan\u2019s voice was a low murmur, close to his ear. \"Not so hard to fly, is it?\" He pulled back a little, though his hand remained, cupping Peter's cheek. His peat-smoke eyes searched Peter\u2019s face in the gloom, looking for something\u2014reassurance, maybe, or a reflection of his own recklessness. \"I\u2019ve been watching you, too, Peter. From my window. Wondering what you were reading. Wondering what you were thinking, looking out at all this.\" He let out a short, soft laugh, a sound utterly different from the booming performance in the close. \"Figured I was going mad. Seeing a story in a window that wasn't there.\"\n\n\"The story was there,\" Peter heard himself say, his voice steadier than he expected. It felt momentous to admit it, to give voice to the silent longing that had structured his days. He dared to look away from Ewan\u2019s eyes and back towards their two windows, twin black squares in the sandstone cliffs of the tenement. They were no longer a mirror and a mystery, but two ends of a secret, a shared geography that only they understood. \"I saw you with the girl,\" he added, the words slipping out before he could stop them, tasting of ash. It wasn't an accusation, just a statement of fact, a piece of the puzzle that didn't fit.\n\nEwan didn\u2019t flinch. He let his hand drop from Peter\u2019s face and picked up a loose piece of slate, turning it over and over in his fingers. \"Mary? She\u2019s\u2026 a friend. Sometimes it\u2019s easier to be seen with a friend like that. Keeps the questions away.\" He glanced at Peter, his expression unreadable. \"This world, our world,\" he gestured vaguely at the tenement, at the city, \"it only lets you live in certain ways. You know that. Sometimes you have to build a wall so you can have a garden behind it.\" He tossed the piece of slate, and they watched it skitter down the roof and disappear into the darkness. \"This,\" he said, turning back to Peter, his meaning clear in the space between them, \"is the garden.\"\n\nThey stayed up there for what felt like hours, though it may have been only one. The cold began to seep into their bones, a damp, insistent chill that the warmth between them couldn't entirely banish. Ewan talked. He spoke of a life before Glasgow, of forestry work in the Highlands, of vast, silent hills and the smell of sawdust, of a sky so full of stars it could break your heart. He spoke of leaving, not because he wanted to, but because a small town has more eyes than a city, and less room to hide. Peter, in turn, spoke of his books, of the worlds he escaped into, of the quiet hunger for something more than the grime and the noise. They were just words, but they were building a bridge, plank by plank, across the chasm of the back court, a bridge that felt more real than the stone and steel of the city around them.\n\nThe descent was a reversal of the magic. Back down the slick ladder, into the familiar, stale air of the washhouse, the spell of the rooftop began to fray. Every creak of the floorboards, every distant cough from another flat, was a reminder of the world they had to return to. At the landing between their floors, they paused in the thick darkness. There were no words left. Ewan reached out and squeezed Peter\u2019s shoulder, a quick, firm pressure that was both a promise and a warning. Then he was gone, his boots making a soft, retreating sound on the stone steps leading up to his floor. Peter stood alone in the dark, his shoulder tingling where Ewan had touched him, the silence of the close pressing in on him once more.\n\nBack in his room, he didn't turn on the light. He went straight to the window, his old habit, his old ritual. But everything was changed. The back court was no longer a chasm of loneliness. Ewan\u2019s window was no longer a dark rectangle of unknowing. It was an anchor. As he watched, a match flared in the darkness opposite, briefly illuminating Ewan\u2019s face as he lit a cigarette. He didn't wave this time. He didn't have to. He just stood there, a point of light in the gloom, and Peter stood with him, two sentinels guarding a fragile, new-born secret. The city was still grimy, the air still thick, but for the first time since he\u2019d arrived, Peter felt like he was breathing. He was no longer just a boy in a window; he was one half of a story, and he knew, with a certainty that was both thrilling and terrifying, that the first chapter had just come to a close.The following morning, the grey light that filtered through his window felt less like an accusation and more like a soft blanket. The tenement square was still a slick mirror of damp stone, but Peter saw it differently now. He saw it not as a chasm, but as the space that defined the distance between two specific points: his window and Ewan\u2019s. The memory of the rooftop was a low, steady hum beneath the surface of his thoughts. He could still feel the phantom press of Ewan\u2019s lips, the rough texture of his jacket, the astonishing, terrifying safety of his hand on his cheek. When he washed his face, the cold water didn\u2019t feel like a punishment; it was a shock that made the memories sharper, more real. The day ahead, with its noise and its fire, didn\u2019t loom with the same dread. It was simply the price of admission for the night to come.\n\nHe didn't have to manufacture an encounter this time. As he pulled on his boots, he heard the familiar, heavy tread on the stairs above. It was a signal. He opened his door and stepped onto the landing just as Ewan was descending. Their eyes met, and the charged silence from the rooftop was there between them again, an invisible, crackling field. Ewan\u2019s lopsided smile was there, too, but it was different now. It was for Peter alone, a private acknowledgment of all that had passed between them in the dark. He didn\u2019t stop, but as he passed, his knuckles brushed against Peter\u2019s, a deliberate, fleeting contact that sent a bolt of heat straight up his arm. \"Morning, lad,\" he said, his voice the same low rumble, but the words were a caress. Peter just nodded, unable to speak, and watched him take the stairs two at a time, the brutalist music now a symphony. He followed a few moments later, walking through the ghost of Ewan\u2019s pine scent as if it were a benediction.\n\nAt the shipyard, the cacophony was the same, the air just as thick with the metallic tang of tortured steel. But Peter felt insulated from it, encased in a bubble of memory and anticipation. He worked with a fierce, focused energy he hadn't possessed before, his movements sure and rhythmic. The other men, with their rough jokes and their casual complaints about wives and the price of beer, seemed to be speaking a foreign language. He was one of them, wearing the same grime-stiffened overalls, his hands calloused from the same labour, but he was no longer of them. He had a secret garden, and the shrieking, fiery hell of the yard was the wall that surrounded it. He found himself smiling once, a small, involuntary quirk of his lips, as he guided a white-hot rivet into place, and caught one of the older men, Davie, watching him with a curious expression. Peter quickly looked away, his heart thumping. The garden was a beautiful thing, but its walls were thin.\n\nThey fell into a silent routine, a language without words. A book left on the top step of Peter\u2019s flight meant the roof, if the weather held. A single chalk mark on the brick by the main door, low down where only someone looking for it would see, meant to wait by the window after dark. Sometimes, Ewan would leave him things. A perfectly ripe apple on his windowsill, discovered in the morning. A small, intricately carved wooden bird, left tucked into the hinge of his door, smelling faintly of the forest. These were not peace offerings or apologies; they were sentences in a conversation, tangible proof that Peter was not imagining it, that the man with peat-smoke eyes was thinking of him even when they were apart. Peter, in return, would leave a passage marked in a book, a poem about stars or the sea, a story of a distant, kinder land. He\u2019d leave it where he knew Ewan would find it, a quiet offering from his world to Ewan\u2019s.\n\nOne evening, as Peter was climbing the stairs, he ran into Mrs Gable coming down from the top-floor washhouse, a wicker basket of damp laundry propped on her hip. She was a woman made of faded floral prints and the smell of carbolic soap, her eyes small and sharp behind her spectacles. \"Ah, Peter,\" she said, her voice a reedy counterpoint to the close's usual echoes. \"You're looking\u2026 brighter, these days. Got a spring in your step.\" She smiled, a small, knowing crinkle around her eyes. \"It's that friend you've made, I expect. The big lad from upstairs, Mr Scott. It\u2019s good to have a pal in a place like this.\" Peter\u2019s blood ran cold. He felt the heat rise in his face, a traitorous blush. \"He's a nice boy,\" she continued, oblivious. \"Always has a kind word. Though I do wish he'd wipe his boots. He tracks the whole of the Highlands in with him.\" She chuckled and continued her slow descent. Peter stood frozen, his hand gripping the bannister. *A pal. A friend.* The words were so simple, so normal. So utterly wrong. It was a reminder of the wall, of the performance. And a warning that even the most innocent eyes were watching.The chill from the iron bannister seeped into his palm, a cold that spread up his arm and settled in his chest, far deeper than the Glasgow damp. *A pal*. The word was a perfectly cut key for a lock that didn't exist, a convenient label for something wild and unnameable. Mrs Gable, in her floral, soap-scented innocence, had held up a mirror, and in it Peter saw not himself and Ewan, but how the world saw them. Two lads, two friends. A safe, understandable equation. He understood, with a sickening lurch, that Ewan\u2019s performance with Mary in the close hadn't just been for him; it was for the entire building. It was part of the wall around the garden, and Peter had been too lost in the beauty of the flowers to even notice the bricks. Back in his room, the window felt different. It was no longer a private vantage point, but a stage. He felt a hundred pairs of eyes on his back, the collective, unseen gaze of the tenement.\n\nThe chalk mark appeared two days later. A faint white dash on the grimy brick, a whisper in their silent language. It meant the roof. A week ago, his heart would have soared. Now, it beat a frantic, trapped rhythm against his ribs, a frantic bird that had suddenly realised the dimensions of its cage. Every step he took up the final flights of stairs that evening felt reckless. He imagined doors opening, heads peering out, a voice calling, \"Where are you off to, lad, at this hour?\" The air in the close, thick with the ghosts of a hundred dinners and a thousand conversations, seemed to press in on him, heavy with judgment. When he pushed open the heavy door to the washhouse, the familiar smell of damp linen and cold stone did nothing to calm him. He was a trespasser, and the magic of the ascent had been replaced by the grim anxiety of being caught.\n\nEwan was already there, a silhouette against a sky that had been washed clean by an earlier rain, leaving behind a deep, bruised purple pricked with a few, determined stars. He was smoking, the red tip of his cigarette a tiny, defiant ember in the gloom. He didn't speak as Peter approached, just watched him, his gaze steady. Peter sat beside him on the coping stones, the drop to the back court below seeming more perilous than ever before. He couldn't shake the feeling that they were utterly exposed, two figures picked out against the skyline for all of Glasgow to see.\n\"You're jumpy tonight,\" Ewan said, his voice a low rumble that barely disturbed the quiet. He flicked the butt of his cigarette into the darkness, a falling star that extinguished itself. \"Like a hare that's heard the dogs.\"\n\n\"Mrs Gable spoke to me,\" Peter said, the words coming out in a rush. \"She called you my friend. My pal.\" He hated how small his voice sounded, how fraught with panic. Ewan was quiet for a long moment, his gaze on the sprawling lights of the city. When he finally turned to Peter, his expression wasn't mocking, or dismissive. It was weary, and older than Peter had ever seen it. \"Aye,\" he said softly. \"And that's what we'll be, to her. To all of them. It's the only story they'll buy, so it's the only one we can sell.\" He reached out and tucked a piece of Peter's hair behind his ear, a gesture so gentle it almost broke him. \"Doesn't change the story we tell each other, up here.\"\n\nSuddenly, from below, came the sharp, metallic clang of the washhouse door slamming shut, followed by the sound of a woman's voice, raised in complaint, the words indistinct but the tone sharp as vinegar. They both froze. In an instant, Ewan\u2019s hand was on Peter\u2019s arm, pulling him back from the edge, down into the deeper shadows of a chimney stack. They crouched there, side by side in the dark, barely breathing. The sounds from below faded, replaced once more by the wind and the distant city hum. The danger had passed. But in the close, shared darkness, Peter could feel the hammering of Ewan's heart, or perhaps it was his own; he couldn't tell where one began and the other ended. The thrill was gone, replaced by the cold, hard reality of fear.\n\nWhen the silence had stretched out long enough to feel safe again, Ewan let out a slow breath. He didn't move away. Instead, he turned in the narrow space, his knee brushing Peter's, his face so close Peter could see the faint starlight reflected in his eyes. The fear had stripped away the performance, the easy confidence, leaving something more raw and essential. \"This is the price, Peter,\" he whispered, his voice rough with an emotion Peter couldn't name. \"This is it. Hiding in the shadows. Always listening for footsteps on the stairs.\" He leaned in, and this time there was no questioning softness in the kiss. It was desperate and deep, a frantic affirmation in the face of all the things that would deny them. It tasted of fear and cheap tobacco and a fierce, defiant tenderness. It wasn't about flying; it was about holding on, a grim anchor in a storm.\n\nThe journey down was silent, a retreat from a battlefield. They parted on the landing with a shared look that was heavier than any embrace, an acknowledgment of the new weight they both carried. Back in his room, Peter stood at the window, but he wasn't looking at Ewan's dark square opposite. He was looking at all the other windows, the dozens of dim, curtained squares stacked one on top of the other. They were no longer just the backdrop to his private world; they were watchtowers. He saw Mrs Gable\u2019s window, and the flat of the man who shouted at his wireless, and the home of the young couple whose baby cried through the night. He saw a city full of walls and rules, and he and Ewan were on the wrong side of all of them. The hope that had bloomed so brightly on the rooftop now had thorns, and he knew, with a certainty that was as cold and hard as the shipyard steel, that their secret garden was a beautiful, impossible, and desperately dangerous place to live.The fear, he discovered, did not recede with the morning light. It was a new colour added to his world, a sickly yellow-grey that stained the dawn and tainted the familiar taste of his tea. Peter woke with the echo of the washhouse door in his bones, his sleep having been a shallow, restless affair punctuated by dreams of falling. When he looked out his window, he no longer saw just the slick, rain-washed stone of the back court. He saw sightlines. He saw angles of observation. He noted the way Mrs Gable\u2019s net curtains never hung quite straight, leaving a gap just wide enough for an eye, and how the window of the flat below Ewan\u2019s, a family with three noisy children, was almost always propped open an inch, like a listening ear. The tenement was no longer a stack of private lives; it was a panopticon of grimy sandstone, and he felt pinned by its unseen, collective gaze.\n\nTheir silent language faltered. There were no more chalk marks by the door, no more carved birds or surprise apples on his sill. The steps on the landing where he might have left a book with a marked page felt too exposed, the act itself imbued with a new and terrible significance. The meetings on the stairs ceased to be manufactured accidents and became instead exercises in avoidance. If he heard Ewan's boots, he would wait behind his door, his hand on the knob, until the sound had faded completely. He told himself it was caution, the lesson learned in the cold shadows of the chimney stack. But a darker, colder thought whispered that perhaps the garden had been abandoned, its single, fragile bloom left to wither on the vine. The silence from Ewan\u2019s side of the court was absolute, and Peter\u2019s loneliness, which had been briefly banished, returned with a vengeance, sharper and more painful for its absence.\n\nThe change in him did not go unnoticed at the yard. Where before he had been quiet but competent, he was now jumpy and distracted, his hands fumbling, his mind miles away. The roar of the furnaces, the shriek of the metal, no longer formed a dull, insulating wall but a cacophony that frayed his already raw nerves. The casual, crude banter of the other men, once just background noise, now felt like a constant interrogation. Every joke about a lass, every boast of a weekend conquest, seemed directed at him, a test he was failing. One afternoon, during a lull, Davie, the old riveter with eyes that had seen too many winters, sidled up to him. \"Everything alright with you, son?\" he asked, his voice surprisingly gentle amid the din. \"You're a million miles away. Got troubles at home?\" Peter flinched as if struck. The simple, kindly meant question felt like a spotlight. \"No. Just tired,\" he mumbled, turning his attention fiercely to a coil of rope, his face burning. The lie felt flimsy, pathetic. He could feel Davie's gaze on him for a long moment before the old man sighed and moved away. Peter knew then that the walls of the garden were not just outside; they had to be built inside himself, and his were proving to be made of glass.\n\nAfter nearly a week of this suffocating silence, a week in which Peter felt himself shrinking, turning back into the ghost he was before Ewan, he broke. He could not bear the not-knowing. The fear of being caught was terrible, but the fear of being abandoned was worse. That evening, he listened for the tell-tale sound of Ewan\u2019s return, his heart a frantic drum. He heard the main door groan open and slam shut, followed by the heavy, familiar tread on the stone. He didn\u2019t hesitate. He pulled open his own door and stepped out onto the landing, blocking the way. Ewan was halfway up the flight of stairs, his head down, and he almost walked into Peter before he stopped, looking up in surprise. His face was shadowed in the gloom, his expression unreadable. For a terrible second, Peter thought he saw a stranger.\n\n\"You've been avoiding me,\" Peter said. The words came out sounding more like an accusation than he intended, his voice tight and low. Ewan didn't answer immediately. He looked past Peter, up the stairs and then down, his eyes scanning the shadowed landings, a soldier checking for snipers. Only when he seemed satisfied that they were alone did he meet Peter\u2019s gaze. The weariness Peter had seen on the roof was there again, etched into the lines around his eyes. \"I've been careful,\" he corrected, his voice a near whisper. \"There's a difference.\" He took the last few steps until he was standing on the same landing, so close Peter could smell the damp wool of his jacket and the cold night air clinging to him. The scent of pine was faint, almost lost. \"You think I want this quiet? This hiding?\" Ewan\u2019s voice was rough, laced with a frustration that mirrored Peter's own. \"I saw Davie talking to you at the yard gate yesterday. I saw Mrs Gable watch you all the way down the street this morning from her window. They're not looking for anything, Peter. Not yet. But they're looking. And that's how it starts.\" He reached out, not to touch, but his hand hovered in the space between them, a gesture of aborted comfort. \"This isn't a story in one of your books, lad. The world doesn't just let you be. You have to be cleverer than it is. You have to be quieter. It means\u2026 going without. So we don't lose everything.\" He finally let his hand drop. The space between them felt vast and cold, a chasm of brutal reality. Peter understood then. This wasn't a retreat; it was a strategy. It wasn't the end of their story, but the grim, unwritten rules of its telling.Ewan's words were a cold, hard key turning in a lock Peter hadn't known was rusted shut. He went back into his room and closed the door, the soft click of the latch sounding like a cell door sliding home. *It means going without.* The phrase echoed in the sudden, profound quiet of his small room. It wasn't the romantic, pining silence of before, filled with daydreams and unspoken hopes. This was a tactical silence, a necessary barrenness. The garden wasn't abandoned; it had been plunged into a perpetual winter to protect its roots. Peter went to the window, his familiar post, but he felt no comfort there. He understood now that his vigil had been naive, a blissful ignorance. He had been admiring the view from the battlefield, mistaking the glint of enemy spyglasses for friendly stars. He looked at Ewan\u2019s window, a dark, inscrutable rectangle, and for the first time, he felt the true weight of the chasm between them. It wasn\u2019t just a distance of stone and air, but of risk and consequence.\n\nThe days that followed were an education in this new quiet. It was a language of absences. The absence of a timed departure in the morning, the absence of a lingering scent of pine in the stairwell, the absence of a hand-rolled cigarette or a piece of carved wood. They became two ghosts haunting the same tenement, their paths weaving around each other with a precision that was heartbreaking in its skill. Peter would hear Ewan\u2019s boots on the stone and press his back against his door, holding his breath until the sound passed. He learned to read the building's rhythms, to know when the landings would be empty, when Mrs Gable was occupied with her washing, when the men from the lower floors had all departed for the pubs. He moved through the close with a furtive grace he hadn't known he possessed, his world shrinking to the path between his door, the stairs, and the street. Life became a series of subtractions, and he felt himself being pared down to his essential, fearful self.\n\nThe shipyard was no longer a hell he escaped from, but a place of strange respite. Amid the deafening, all-consuming noise, he could not hear the silence that screamed at him back in the tenement. The fire and the fury of the work demanded his full attention, and for eight hours a day, he could almost forget the constant, low-level hum of anxiety. He became a better worker. His movements were swift and certain because his mind had no room for daydreams. He was present, anchored in the brutal reality of the forge, and the men, sensing this shift, began to treat him with a different kind of respect. He was no longer the quiet, bookish lad, but one of them, a man who pulled his weight and kept his head down. Davie clapped him on the shoulder one afternoon, a gesture of rough approval. \"That's it, son,\" he'd grunted over the noise. \"Whatever was eating at you, you've sweated it out.\" Peter didn't have the heart to tell him that he hadn't sweated it out; he'd just learned to hide it better.\n\nTheir only point of contact was the windows, and even that changed. There were no more waves, no more silhouettes lingering for long moments. It became a silent, nightly check-in, as austere and necessary as a soldier's watch. Just after the last of the tenement's lights were extinguished, Peter would stand in the darkness of his room and wait. And across the court, a match would flare. One single, brief ignition. Ewan would light a cigarette, the tiny flame illuminating his face for no more than a second, just long enough for Peter to see that he was there, that he was watching. Ewan wouldn't stay at the window; he would retreat into the darkness of his own room. But the glowing red ember of his cigarette would move back and forth in the blackness, a tiny, restless planet in their shared, secret solar system. Peter would watch until the ember was finally extinguished, and only then would he feel a measure of peace, enough to allow sleep to claim him. It was a conversation stripped to its barest element: *I am here. You are there. We are still here.* It was everything, and it was almost nothing at all.\n\nOne Tuesday, a month into this silent siege, the routine was broken. Peter was returning late from an errand, a new book tucked under his arm, the sky already the colour of lead. As he pushed open the heavy main door, he saw a cluster of people on the first-floor landing. It was the family from below Ewan\u2019s flat, the mother holding a crying baby, the father looking grim, and beside them, a stout man in a dark suit. A doctor. Peter\u2019s first instinct was to retreat, to make himself invisible, but he was already in the close, his presence noted by the father's weary glance. He began to climb the stairs, his head down, murmuring a quiet \"Evening.\" As he drew level with them, the doctor was speaking in low, serious tones. \"...keep him warm, plenty of fluids. This fever is a nasty one. It's going through the whole Gallowgate like a bad rumour.\" Peter\u2019s heart seized. He chanced a look up the stairs, towards Ewan\u2019s floor, a frantic, unspoken question in his eyes. The doctor, packing his bag, caught the look. \"Don't you worry, lad,\" he said, mistaking the direction of Peter\u2019s concern. \"Your friend upstairs is tough as an old boot. I was just up there. Same thing, a bad chill and a devil of a cough. But he'll be right as rain in a few days.\" The doctor snapped his bag shut. \"Seems to be sharing it with half the building.\" The words hit Peter with the force of a physical blow. Ewan was sick. Alone in his room. And Peter was trapped on the other side of a few feet of stone and a wall of suffocating caution. The fear he had been living with for weeks was suddenly dwarfed by a new, more terrifying one. The fear of loss, real and absolute. The rules of their quiet game suddenly seemed like the most foolish, pointless thing in the world.The doctor and the family dispersed, their footsteps and hushed worries fading into the tenement\u2019s low hum, leaving Peter alone on the landing. The air, moments before just stale and damp, now felt thin, unbreathable. All the caution he had so painstakingly cultivated, all the lessons in silence and avoidance, evaporated like steam in the cold air. The intricate chess game he and Ewan had been playing against the world was swept from the board by a single, brutal fact: Ewan was sick. He was one floor away, burning with a fever, in a room as solitary as Peter\u2019s own. The image of Ewan, the strong, vital man who smelled of forests and took the stairs two at a time, laid low and alone, was an agony that dwarfed every other fear. The risk of a curious glance or a piece of idle gossip seemed a paltry price to pay compared to the cost of inaction, of leaving Ewan to suffer in the name of a strategy that had already failed to bring them anything but a colder, more profound isolation.\n\nHe didn't return to his room to hide. He went back with a purpose that felt like a fire in his veins, melting the ice of the past weeks. The small, sparse room was no longer a prison cell but a base of operations. He moved with a decisiveness that surprised himself. From his small larder, he took the last of his tea, a precious quarter-ounce wrapped in paper. He found the lemon he had bought on a whim two days ago, a small extravagance he had been saving, its bright, sharp scent a promise of something clean and restorative. He filled his kettle with fresh water from the sink and grabbed the cleanest cloth he owned from a drawer. These were meagre offerings, the humble provisions of a shipyard worker, but as he gathered them, they felt like weapons. Each item was an act of defiance, a clear, unequivocal statement against the tyranny of their self-imposed silence. He was no longer just a boy in a window, or a ghost on the stairs; he was a friend, a pal, and he was about to prove what that truly meant.\n\nThe single flight of stairs leading to Ewan\u2019s floor had never seemed so long. It was a vertical no-man's-land, exposed and treacherous. With the kettle of water in one hand and his small collection of supplies in the other, he began the ascent. Every creak of the ancient wooden treads under his boots was a gunshot in the quiet. He could feel the eyes of the building on him, Mrs Gable\u2019s, the man with the wireless, the family with the crying baby. He imagined their doors opening, their faces appearing, their questions hanging in the air. *You're breaking the rules*, a voice in his head screamed, Ewan\u2019s voice. *This is not clever. This is not quiet.* But he pushed the voice down. Cleverness had left Ewan alone and shivering. Quiet had built a wall between them when what they needed was a bridge. He reached the landing outside Ewan\u2019s door, his heart hammering against his ribs not with fear of being caught, but with the terrifying, beautiful certainty of what he was about to do.\n\nHe stood there for a moment, the kettle growing heavy in his hand, the smell of damp stone and boiled cabbage filling his lungs. He listened. From inside the room, he could hear a sound he had never associated with Ewan: a rough, ragged cough that spoke of deep-seated illness. The sound cut through his last vestiges of hesitation. He raised his free hand, the knuckles white, and knocked. The sound was soft, just three quick taps, but in the echoing cavern of the close it sounded like a declaration of war. He waited, holding his breath. For a long moment, there was only the sound of that terrible cough in reply. Then, a shuffling noise, a muttered curse, and the slow, heavy scrape of footsteps. The lock turned with a loud, metallic clunk, and the door opened a few inches, revealing a sliver of darkness. Ewan\u2019s face appeared in the gap, pale and slick with sweat in the gloom, his peat-smoke eyes clouded with fever and confusion. \"Peter? What the hell are you doing?\" his voice was a raw, broken rasp. He looked not just sick, but angry, his gaze darting past Peter to the empty stairwell behind him.\n\n\"The doctor told me,\" Peter said, his own voice low and steady, a stark contrast to the panic roiling inside him. He held up the lemon and the packet of tea. \"He said you had the fever. I brought you something.\" He didn't wait for permission. He pushed gently against the door, an undeniable pressure that was both a question and a demand. Ewan, his strength sapped by the illness, offered no resistance. He stumbled back, letting Peter into the room, and closed the door behind him, plunging them into near-total darkness. The room was cold, the air thick and stale with the scent of sickness, though underneath it all, the faint, ghostly trace of pine lingered like a memory. As his eyes adjusted, Peter could make out the spartan details: a narrow iron bed, a single wooden chair, a small table cluttered with tools for woodcarving, and dozens of tiny, intricately carved birds, perched on every available surface. Ewan leaned heavily against the closed door, his body wracked by a shiver. He looked utterly spent, the solid, unshakeable man reduced to a fragile shadow. \"You shouldn't be here,\" Ewan rasped, though the words lacked their usual force. \"It's not safe.\" Peter ignored him. He walked past him to the small table, set down his supplies, and turned to face him, the small, carved birds his silent audience. \"No,\" Peter said, his voice imbued with a quiet authority he didn't know he possessed. \"It's not safe for you to be alone.\"A flicker of anger in Ewan\u2019s fever-bright eyes died out, replaced by a profound weariness, as if the effort of being angry was simply too much to sustain. He watched, swaying slightly, as Peter moved about the small, cold room with a quiet, unnerving competence. Peter\u2019s eyes swept over the space, noting the tiny, grate-fronted fireplace, its black maw empty and cold, a bucket of coal and a handful of kindling beside it. There was no hesitation in his movements. He knelt on the grimy hearthrug, his back to Ewan, and began to arrange the kindling with the focused precision of a man building a bomb, or a prayer. The scratch of the match, the tiny burst of sulphur and flame, was the only sound besides Ewan's shallow, ragged breathing.\n\nEwan didn't protest further. The fight had gone out of him, leeched away by the fever. He sank onto the edge of his narrow iron bed, the frame groaning under his weight, and watched Peter as if he were a strange apparition. He watched as Peter coaxed the small flame, feeding it scraps of paper and then splinters of wood until it caught, a small, hungry thing that began to throw a dancing, uncertain light onto the walls. The shadows of the carved birds leaped and swayed. Peter filled a small, soot-blackened pot with water from his kettle and set it on the grate to warm, then meticulously sliced the lemon on a clean plate he found on the windowsill. The sharp, clean scent of the citrus cut through the stale air of the sickroom, a bright, defiant note in the fug of illness and coal smoke. It was an act of such simple, domestic care that it felt more intimate, more shockingly profound, than any kiss in the dark.\n\nWhen the water was steaming, Peter poured it into a tin mug, adding the tea and a thick slice of lemon, the steam rising in a fragrant cloud. He carried it over to the bed. Ewan was shivering now, a deep, uncontrollable tremor that shook his broad frame. His hands, when he reached for the mug, were unsteady. Peter\u2019s own hands closed around Ewan\u2019s, steadying them, feeling the burning, dry heat of his skin. The contact was electric, a jolt of pure information: *fever, weakness, life*. \"Drink,\" Peter said, his voice soft but firm, and he held the mug for Ewan, tilting it to his lips as if he were a child. Ewan drank, his eyes closing, a low groan of relief escaping his throat. After a few sips, he sagged back against the thin pillow. Peter took the cloth he\u2019d brought, dipped it in the remaining cool water from the kettle, wrung it out, and gently laid it across Ewan\u2019s forehead. Ewan flinched at the initial shock of the cold, then relaxed into it with a sigh that seemed to come from the very depths of his soul.\n\nWith Ewan finally still, his breathing a little easier, Peter had a moment to truly see the room. It was Ewan\u2019s whole world. The walls were bare but for the birds. They were everywhere. A flock of gulls perched on the high shelf above the bed, their wings half-spread as if ready for flight. A tiny, perfect wren sat on the corner of the table. An owl, its wooden eyes seeming to hold a deep, ancient knowledge, was tucked beside a pile of books. They weren\u2019t just carvings; they were personalities, each one captured in a moment of life. This was the forest Ewan carried inside him, the open space he had spoken of on the roof. It was his escape, his secret language made tangible. Reaching out, Peter gently touched the smooth, polished head of a blackbird resting on the bedpost. He felt the patient hours of work in the wood, the love. He was no longer just standing in Ewan\u2019s room; he had been allowed into the heart of the garden.\n\n\"You\u2019re a damn fool, Peter,\" Ewan\u2019s voice was a rough whisper from the bed, his eyes still closed. The words held no anger now, only a raw, gravelly exhaustion. \"A bloody, stubborn fool.\"\n\nPeter turned from the birds and looked at the man on the bed, at the damp cloth on his forehead, at the vulnerability in the line of his jaw. He thought of the weeks of silence, the fear, the cold expanse of the back court. He thought of the doctor\u2019s casual words on the stairs and the terror that had bloomed in his chest, a terror that had proven stronger than any rule. He walked back to the bedside and sat on the single wooden chair, pulling it close.\n\n\"Aye,\" Peter said quietly, his voice full of a feeling he couldn't name. \"Maybe I am.\" He reached out and adjusted the blanket, pulling it higher over Ewan\u2019s shoulder. \"But you were alone.\"Ewan didn\u2019t answer, but the tension in his shoulders seemed to dissolve, a quiet surrender. He let his head fall back against the pillow, his breath a ragged sigh. The small fire Peter had built spat and crackled in the grate, a living, breathing thing in the cold room. It threw a warm, flickering glow on the bare floorboards and the flock of wooden birds, making their shadows dance like restless spirits. Outside, the city hummed its indifferent tune, but inside this small, fourth-floor room, a new kind of silence settled. It was not the strained, fearful quiet of the past weeks, but a shared stillness, deep and resonant, a space where two people could simply be, without pretence or performance. The world had been shrunk down to the dimensions of this room, to the sound of the fire and the rhythm of a fevered man\u2019s breathing.\n\nPeter stayed in the chair, a sentry at his post. He watched the rise and fall of Ewan\u2019s chest, the slight twitch of his eyelids. The anger and defiance that had propelled him up the stairs had subsided, replaced by a low, steady hum of purpose. He was where he was supposed to be. He got up quietly and added a few more lumps of coal to the fire, coaxing it into a stronger, more consistent heat that began to push back the room\u2019s bone-deep chill. He refilled the mug with warm water, this time lacing it with a squeeze of lemon and a spoonful of the precious sugar he\u2019d thought to grab from his own cupboard. He saw Ewan's carving tools lying on the table, a jumble of well-worn knives and gouges next to a half-finished hawk, its wings poised in an intricate state of arrested motion. He ran a finger over the smooth, sanded wood, feeling the ghost of Ewan\u2019s hands, the same hands that were now too weak to hold a mug steady. The contrast was a sharp, painful ache in his chest.\n\nHours passed. The tenement outside fell into a deeper quiet as the last of the wireless sets were switched off and the final arguments faded behind closed doors. Peter must have dozed, his head nodding forward, for he startled awake to the sound of a low murmur. Ewan was moving restlessly, his head thrashing on the pillow, his hands plucking at the thin blanket. He was muttering, his voice thick with delirium. \"Too many eyes\u2026 the trees have eyes\u2026 can\u2019t see the stars\u2026\" Peter was at his side in an instant. He took the cloth, which had grown warm, dipped it again in the basin of cool water, and laid it gently on Ewan's brow. \"Shhh, Ewan,\" he whispered, his voice close to Ewan's ear. \"You're alright. It's just me. It\u2019s Peter. You\u2019re safe.\" He wasn't sure if the words registered, but he repeated them like an incantation, a shield against the fever-dreams. He took one of Ewan\u2019s hot, restless hands in his own. His grip was surprisingly strong, clinging to Peter\u2019s as if he were a lifeline in a storm-tossed sea. Peter held on, an anchor in the dark.\n\nSometime in the deepest part of the night, when the only sound was the lonely rattle of a far-off tram, Ewan\u2019s eyes opened. The fever-glaze was gone, replaced by a lucid exhaustion. He looked at Peter, at their joined hands, at the flickering fire, and then around the small, warm room. He seemed to be taking in the scene from a great distance, as if seeing it for the first time. His throat worked for a moment before he spoke, his voice a dry rasp. \"You stayed.\" It wasn't a question. \"Of course I stayed,\" Peter said, his own voice thick with sleeplessness. He felt a blush creep up his neck, a strange mix of shyness and pride. Ewan squeezed his hand, a faint but deliberate pressure. \"My da,\" he said, his gaze fixed on the ceiling, \"he used to say the only thing worse than being sick was being sick alone.\" He turned his head on the pillow to look at Peter, and in the faint firelight, his peat-smoke eyes were dark pools of a raw, unguarded emotion Peter had never seen before. \"Thank you.\" The words were simple, scraped from the depths of his weariness, but they landed with the weight of a sacred vow.\n\nThe first hint of dawn began to bleed into the sky, turning the black of the window to a bruised, watery grey. The reality of the outside world, of the coming day, began to press at the edges of their small sanctuary. The shipyard. His own empty room. The questions. Peter felt a familiar knot of anxiety tighten in his stomach. He should go. He should slip back down the stairs before the building woke up, resume his post, maintain the fiction. But the thought of leaving Ewan, of letting the cold and the silence creep back into this room, was unbearable. He looked at Ewan, who seemed to have drifted into a true, healing sleep at last, his breathing deep and even, the tremors gone. The fever had broken. He couldn't leave him. Not yet. Making a decision that felt both insane and completely necessary, Peter gently disentangled his hand from Ewan's. He crept to the door, opened it a crack, and listened. The close was silent. He slipped out, his boots silent on the stone, and went not down, but up. To the top-floor washhouse. He soaked his own handkerchief in the cold, scummy water from the basin, then crept back down to his own floor. He unlocked his door, went inside for only a moment, and then re-emerged, locking it behind him. He returned to Ewan's room as a thief returns to the scene of a crime, his heart pounding. Back inside, he went to the window, the one that mirrored his own. He waited. Soon, he knew, Davie or one of the other men from the yard who lived nearby would pass, and seeing his dark window, would assume he was gone. Then, Peter took the damp handkerchief and, with a grim sense of purpose, began to rub it against his own face and neck, forcing a clammy, artificial chill onto his skin. He would not go to the shipyard. When Mrs Gable eventually knocked to ask after him, he would be sick. He would have the same fever that was sweeping the Gallowgate. He would build the wall higher, but this time, he would be on the same side of it as Ewan.The first hour of daylight was the longest of Peter\u2019s life. He sat in the chair by Ewan\u2019s bed, a conspirator in a crime that hadn\u2019t yet been discovered, every sound from the close magnified a hundredfold. He heard the first of the shipyard men clattering down the stairs, their gruff voices and loud boots a familiar part of a morning he had chosen to betray. He heard the milkman\u2019s clinking bottles, Mrs Gable\u2019s door opening and closing on the floor below, the city waking up to a day he would not be a part of. With each sound, his stomach clenched. He was an absence in his own life, a ghost in his own room, a boy who had deliberately vanished from the world in order to exist more fully in this one small, fire-warmed space. Ewan slept on, oblivious, his breathing the only steady, reassuring rhythm in the tense, waiting silence.\n\nThe knock came just after eight, three sharp, brisk raps that were unmistakably Mrs Gable\u2019s. It was not on Ewan\u2019s door, but on his own, one floor below. Peter froze, his hand tightening on the arm of the chair. He heard her knock again, more insistently this time, followed by a pause. \"Peter? Lad, you'll be late for the yard!\" Her reedy voice, muffled by two floors, carried up the stairwell with perfect, dreadful clarity. He held his breath. He heard her tutting, a sound of mild exasperation, and then her footsteps retreating. He allowed himself a slow, shaky exhale. He had cleared the first hurdle. But he knew it was only a reprieve.\n\nA half-hour later, the footsteps returned, slower this time, climbing past his own floor. They stopped directly outside Ewan's door. The knock, when it came, was softer, more hesitant. Ewan stirred, his brow furrowing in sleep. Peter was on his feet in an instant, his heart a frantic bird against his ribs. He crossed to the door and leaned his ear against the cold wood. \"Mr Scott?\" Mrs Gable's voice was gentle, laced with concern. \"I know you're unwell, dear, but I'm worried about the lad below you. He's not gone to work and he's not answering his door. I just wanted to be sure he wasn't\u2026\" She let the thought hang, unfinished and grim. This was it. The performance. Peter took a deep, steadying breath, opened the door a crack, and peered out, blinking as if the weak light of the landing was a painful glare.\n\nHe let his shoulders slump, forcing a shiver into his frame. \"Mrs Gable,\" he croaked, his voice a deliberately weak and scratchy imitation of Ewan's. He coughed, a dry, pathetic sound that scraped his throat. \"I'm sorry. I think\u2026 I think I've got it too.\" He watched her face, a mask of practised misery fixed on his own. The landlady's sharp eyes softened with a mixture of sympathy and weary resignation. She peered past him into the gloom of the room, where Ewan was now sitting up in bed, looking pale and confused. \"Oh, you poor lambs,\" she sighed, shaking her head. \"The pair of you. It's a wicked flu. Well, at least you're not alone. One of you can fetch for the other.\" She looked from Peter's wan face to Ewan's shadowed one. \"Is there anything I can get for you both? A bit of broth, perhaps?\" Her gaze was kind, her concern genuine. There was no suspicion, only a tired acceptance of the tenement's communal miseries. The relief was so profound it made Peter feel dizzy. \"No, thank you, Mrs Gable. We'll manage,\" he said, his voice barely a whisper. \"Just need to sleep it off.\" He offered her a weak, grateful smile and slowly closed the door, leaning his forehead against the wood, his entire body trembling with the aftermath of the lie.\n\nWhen he turned back into the room, Ewan was watching him, his expression a complex mixture of awe and alarm. He had swung his legs over the side of the bed, his bare feet on the cold floorboards. The fire had warmed the room enough that he was no longer shivering, and the lucid light of recovery was fully back in his eyes. \"Peter,\" he said, his voice still rough but stronger now. \"What in God's name have you done?\" It wasn\u2019t an accusation. It was a question born of pure disbelief. He gestured around the room, at the simmering pot, the neatly folded blanket, at Peter himself, standing there like a dishevelled, triumphant actor who had just walked off stage. \"You can't just\u2026 not go to the yard. They'll sack you. You can't just move in here. What were you thinking?\"\n\n\"I was thinking you were going to die alone in a cold room,\" Peter retorted, his own voice sharper than he intended, the residual adrenaline of the performance making him bold. \"I was thinking that all our cleverness and our quiet and our rules meant nothing if I let that happen.\" He walked over to the fire and busied himself with the poker, prodding the coals with unnecessary force. \"So I stopped being clever. I left my door locked from the inside and I came here.\" He looked over his shoulder at Ewan. \"Mrs Gable thinks I'm sick in my own room. Now she thinks we're both sick, and we're looking after each other. Like pals.\" He spat the last word out, a bitter echo of the fear that had driven them apart. But here, in the safety of their shared confinement, the word was not a disguise; it was a shield. It was the story they had sold the world, and for now, the world had bought it. The sheer, insane genius of it was just beginning to dawn on him. They hadn't just built a wall. Peter had found a door, and he'd locked it from the inside.For a long moment, Ewan just stared, his mind trying to catch up with the sheer, breathtaking audacity of what Peter had done. The carefully constructed fortress of caution he had built around himself, rule by painstaking rule, had just been stormed not by an enemy, but by this quiet, determined boy with shipyard dust in his hair and a strategist\u2019s mind hidden behind a poet\u2019s eyes. He should have been angry. He should have been terrified. The risk was monumental, a gamble that could bring the whole flimsy structure of their lives crashing down. But as he looked at Peter, standing there flushed with defiance and the heat from the hearth, a slow, unfamiliar warmth spread through his own chest, a warmth that had nothing to do with the fading fever. A laugh, a real one, unperformed and incredulous, bubbled up from deep inside him. It was a rusty, cracked sound, but it was genuine.\n\n\"You're mad,\" Ewan said, the words catching in his throat. He shook his head slowly, a dawning smile finally breaking across his face. \"Completely and utterly mad.\" He pushed himself up straighter, the strength returning to his limbs now that the immediate threat of solitude had been so thoroughly vanquished. He looked around the room, at the small fire burning brightly, the scent of lemon and steam in the air, the general air of order that Peter had imposed on his bachelor's chaos. It felt less like his own grim room and more like a corner of the world that had been claimed and defended. \"And Mrs Gable just\u2026 believed you?\"\n\n\"Why wouldn't she?\" Peter replied, a spark of pride in his voice. \"It's the perfect story. The whole street is sick. Why not us? And everyone knows it's good to have a pal.\" He leaned against the mantelpiece, the firelight catching the determined set of his jaw. \"Now she'll leave us alone. She might even leave us broth.\" The pragmatism of it, the simple, devastating logic, struck Ewan with the force of a revelation. He had been so focused on hiding, on being invisible, that he had never considered the power of a plausible, visible lie. Peter hadn't built a higher wall; he'd created a smoke screen, a piece of theatre so mundane and believable that no one would ever think to look behind the curtain.\n\nAnd so began their period of stolen time. Their world shrank to the four walls of Ewan\u2019s room, and in doing so, it became infinite. The first day, Ewan was still weak, and Peter played the role of caregiver with a solemn dedication. Just as he\u2019d predicted, a pot of thin, salty mutton broth appeared outside the door mid-morning, a testament to Mrs Gable\u2019s kindness and the success of their deception. They shared it, sitting on the edge of the bed, a quiet, conspiratorial glee passing between them with every spoonful. The constant, low-level fear that had been Peter\u2019s companion for weeks was replaced by a humming, vigilant contentment. He was no longer waiting for a signal or dreading a footstep; he was inside the fortress, guarding the gate.\n\nAs Ewan\u2019s strength returned over the next day, the dynamic shifted from patient and nurse to that of two people simply sharing a life. The enforced proximity, which should have been awkward, was instead a catalyst for a new kind of intimacy. They moved around each other in the small space with an unconscious, fluid grace, their shoulders brushing as one tended the fire while the other made tea. They talked. They talked for hours, filling the silence they had so long endured with the stories of their lives. Peter spoke of his childhood in a fishing village on the coast, of his mother who had loved books and his father who had been lost to the sea, the reason he\u2019d come to the city to find work that was tied to solid ground. He confessed his dreams of one day seeing the world beyond the pages, of finding a place where the air wasn\u2019t thick with coal.\n\nIn return, Ewan, his hands finally steady enough to pick up his carving tools, began to unlock his own past. He told Peter about the birds. Each one had a name and a story. He picked up the half-finished hawk, its feathers intricately detailed. \"This one's for my brother, Cal,\" he said, his voice soft. \"He's up in the Highlands. Always said I saw things he couldn't, that I could find the bird inside the wood.\" He explained that the carving was the only thing that quieted his mind, the only way he knew how to pray. He spoke of his own departure from his small town, not of forestry work, but of a quiet, brutal shunning after a rumour started, a story about him and another boy that had spread like wildfire. He\u2019d left to protect his family from the talk, trading the vast, open sky for the anonymity of the Gallowgate\u2019s grimy canyons. Peter listened, his heart aching with a fierce, protective tenderness. He looked at the flock of silent, wooden birds, and he understood. This wasn't just a hobby; it was an act of survival, a way of populating his loneliness with beautiful, wild things that could not be caged by the judgment of others.\n\nOn the third night, the fever was a distant memory. The city outside was quiet, the fire had burned down to a deep, pulsating bed of embers that filled the room with a soft, red glow. They sat on the floor, their backs against the side of the bed, sharing the last of Ewan\u2019s tobacco in a hand-rolled cigarette that passed between them. The conversation had dwindled, the stories told, leaving a comfortable, humming silence in their wake. Peter watched the smoke curl from Ewan\u2019s lips and vanish into the shadows. He felt Ewan\u2019s gaze on him, steady and intense in the dim light. The constant physical closeness of the past days had re-calibrated his senses; he was acutely aware of the warmth of Ewan\u2019s shoulder pressed against his own, the rhythm of his breathing. Ewan reached out, his fingers tracing the line of Peter's jaw, a touch that was no longer tentative or questioning. It was a touch that knew its destination. He leaned in, and the kiss was nothing like the desperate, frantic ones on the rooftop. It was slow, and deep, and sure. It tasted of tobacco and woodsmoke and the quiet triumph of their shared sanctuary. It was not a kiss of defiance against the world, but a kiss of coming home.The world, when Peter woke, came to him slowly, filtered through the unfamiliar warmth of another body. He was curled on his side, his back pressed against the solid wall of Ewan\u2019s chest, one of Ewan\u2019s arms draped possessively over his waist. The grey morning light, usually so accusatory, was soft and forgiving as it filtered through the grimy windowpane, illuminating dust motes dancing in a lazy column. For the first time since coming to this city, Peter felt the quiet not as an absence, but as a presence. It was the soft sound of Ewan\u2019s breathing in his ear, the gentle ticking of a clock he hadn't noticed before, the distant, muffled rumble of Glasgow starting its day. He lay perfectly still, memorising the feeling of Ewan\u2019s hand resting on his stomach, the rough texture of the wool blanket, the faint scent of woodsmoke that clung to the pillow. This was not the desperate, fever-pitch of the rooftop, nor the stolen, fearful moments on the stairs. This was something else entirely. It was a quiet, profound, and terrifyingly normal morning.\n\nTheir stolen days bled into a week, a small lifetime lived within the confines of a single room. The pretence of sickness became their new reality, a shield that allowed for a fragile, impossible domesticity to bloom. Peter learned the landscape of Ewan\u2019s body as intimately as he knew the pages of his favourite books, and Ewan learned the rhythms of Peter\u2019s thoughts, anticipating his moods from the way he turned a page or stared into the fire. They existed in a bubble of shared tasks and easy silence. Mornings were for brewing strong tea and sharing a piece of toast, their movements a choreographed dance in the cramped space. In the afternoons, Ewan would sit by the window, the light falling on his hands as he carved, the soft scrape and whisper of his knife a counterpoint to Peter reading aloud from his book of sea voyages and distant lands. Peter\u2019s voice would fill the room with tales of open water and star-filled skies, and Ewan would make the stories real, coaxing a diving gannet or a soaring albatross from a block of unassuming limewood. It was a perfect, self-contained world, and the knowledge of its impermanence made every moment unbearably precious.\n\nThe first tremor that shook their sanctuary came not as a knock, but as a thin, white sliver sliding under the door. It was a Tuesday morning, a full ten days since Peter had last set foot in the shipyard. They both saw it at the same time, a pale rectangle against the dark floorboards. An official-looking envelope from the Gallowgate postal service, misdelivered to Ewan\u2019s door instead of his own. Ewan retrieved it, his expression hardening as he recognised the shipyard\u2019s insignia stamped in the corner. He handed it to Peter without a word. Peter\u2019s hands, which had been so steady making their breakfast minutes before, trembled as he broke the seal. The language was formal, cold, and final. His position had been terminated due to unexplained absence. His final wages could be collected from the foreman\u2019s office. The paper felt heavy in his hand, a death sentence for the life he had known. The noise of the shipyard, the security of the wage packet, the grim purpose of his days\u2014all of it, gone. He looked up at Ewan, the small room suddenly feeling like a cage, the walls closing in. The world they had so carefully kept at bay had just kicked down the door.\n\n\"I knew this would happen,\" Peter said, his voice hollow. He sank onto the edge of the bed, the letter crumpled in his fist. \"It's over. I've got nothing, Ewan. No job. No money coming in.\" The reality of his recklessness crashed over him, a cold, sickening wave. Their week of stolen time had been bought at the cost of his entire future. All he had was this room, and this room wasn\u2019t even his. He felt a familiar, desperate panic rising, the old fear that he would be swept away, lost in the city's unforgiving currents. He had flown too close to the sun, and now he was falling, the wax of his wings melting away.\n\nEwan crossed the room and knelt in front of him, taking the crumpled letter from his hand and smoothing it out on his knee. He looked not at the words, but at Peter\u2019s face, his peat-smoke eyes serious and calm. \"No,\" he said, his voice low and firm, a steady anchor in the storm of Peter\u2019s panic. \"It's not over. It's just changed.\" He reached for the table and picked up the hawk he had been carving, the one for his brother. It was nearly finished, its wings perfectly poised, its wooden eyes sharp and focused. \"This city, this yard\u2026 it was never your sky, Peter. It was a cage you happened to find food in. I told you once, there's always somewhere else to fly to.\" He held the hawk out. It wasn't a gift; it was a promise, an argument. \"My brother, Cal. He works a timber plantation, north of Aberdeen. They're always looking for men. Hard work, but the air is clean and the pay is honest. And the foremen don't care about anything but how well you can swing an axe.\" He looked Peter straight in the eye, his grip tightening on the wooden bird. \"They don't care who you share your roof with.\"\n\nThe proposition hung in the air, audacious and terrifying. To leave Glasgow. To abandon the only life he knew, grim as it was, for a place he\u2019d only read about on maps. It was one thing to dream of escape from the pages of a book, another entirely to pack a bag and walk out into the cold reality of it. It was the sea calling to his father all over again, a siren song of the unknown. But then he looked at Ewan, kneeling before him, offering not just a half-formed dream but a tangible plan, a destination. He looked at the life they had managed to carve out in this tiny, besieged room\u2014the shared meals, the stories, the quiet understanding, the breathtaking normalcy of waking up in Ewan\u2019s arms. The thought of losing that, of returning to his own cold, empty room, of watching Ewan become just a shape in a window again\u2014that was a fear greater than any unknown. It was the difference between falling and flying.\n\n\"What about\u2026 all this?\" Peter asked, gesturing vaguely at the room, the flock of birds, the small universe Ewan had built. Ewan followed his gaze, a flicker of sadness in his eyes. \"They're just wood,\" he said softly. \"The real birds are out there.\" He placed the hawk into Peter\u2019s hands. Its weight was solid, real. A plan. A future. Peter curled his fingers around it, the smooth, carved feathers pressing into his palm. He took a deep breath, the air tasting of hope and fear in equal measure, and he nodded. \"Alright,\" he said, the word a quiet vow. \"When do we leave?\" A slow, brilliant smile spread across Ewan\u2019s face, the real, lopsided smile that had started it all. He stood up, pulling Peter to his feet with him. \"As soon as we've sold what we can and packed what we can't,\" he said, his voice alive with a sudden, fierce energy. \"We leave at night. We'll be ghosts, gone by morning.\" They stood in the centre of the room, no longer a sanctuary but a launching pad, the shipyard's dismissal letter lying discarded on the floor like a shed skin. Together, they turned and looked out the window, not at each other's separate worlds, but at the sprawling, grimy city below, a place that had almost broken them. It was not their home. It was just a place they were leaving.The decision, once made, electrified the air in the small room. The lethargy of their false sickness and the paralysis of fear were burned away by a sudden, fierce blaze of purpose. Their sanctuary was no longer a place to hide, but a temporary camp from which to plan a great expedition. The world, which had been a threat to be kept out, was now a thing to be navigated, conquered. Ewan, imbued with a restless energy that seemed to flow back into his limbs with the plan's formation, hauled a dusty tin trunk from beneath his bed. Its metal feet scraped a harsh, decisive line across the floorboards, a sound that was not an ending, but a beginning. He clicked open the rusted latches, the noise echoing in the quiet room. \"Right,\" he said, his voice crisp and clear, a captain\u2019s voice. \"Inventory. We take what we can carry, what has a purpose. Everything else is a ghost. We leave the ghosts behind.\"\n\nThe first sacrifice was the flock. For two hours, Ewan sat on the floor, his back straight, and presided over the dispersal of his wooden children. He handled each one with a tender reverence, his calloused fingers tracing the lines he had so patiently carved into them. He was not just packing; he was saying goodbye. Peter watched in silence, his heart aching with a shared sense of loss. He understood that these were not just objects; they were the silent companions of Ewan\u2019s lonely years, the population of his solitude. Ewan set aside three small figures: the nearly-finished hawk for his brother, a tiny, perfect wren which he pressed into Peter\u2019s palm without a word, and a sleek, diving otter that he tucked deep into his own satchel. The rest\u2014gulls and finches, owls and blackbirds\u2014were wrapped carefully in old newspaper and arranged in a cardboard box. \"There\u2019s a man near the Barras,\" Ewan explained, his voice carefully neutral. \"Deals in oddities. He knows my work. He\u2019ll give us a fair price.\" He didn\u2019t look at Peter as he spoke, his gaze fixed on the box, and Peter knew that a fair price for such a thing did not exist.\n\nThey walked to the dealer\u2019s shop through a part of the city Peter had never seen, a labyrinth of narrow streets where the tenements leaned in so close they seemed to be whispering secrets to one another. The shop was a dusty cave of forgotten things, smelling of decaying paper and furniture polish. The dealer, a small, bird-like man with spectacles perched on the end of his nose, unwrapped each carving with greedy, appreciative fingers. He hummed and nodded, holding them up to the weak light. The haggling was brief and quiet. Ewan stood firm, his jaw set, and the dealer, sensing a resolve that went beyond mere commerce, eventually agreed. They left the shop with a thin sheaf of banknotes in Ewan\u2019s pocket, the weight of the money feeling insignificant compared to the sudden lightness of the box he no longer carried. As they walked away, Peter glanced back and saw the dealer placing one of the gulls in the shop window, its wings spread, forever poised for a flight it would never take.\n\nThe next trial fell to Peter alone. He had to return to the shipyard, a final descent into the inferno to claim the wages that would fund their escape. Ewan had wanted to go with him, but Peter refused. This was his ghost to lay to rest. Walking through the familiar, grimy streets towards the yard felt like walking into a dream he\u2019d already woken from. The deafening roar reached him blocks away, a sound that no longer filled him with dread, but with a strange, detached pity. He was an outsider now, a tourist in his own former life. At the gate, he saw Davie, sharing a cigarette with another man. The old riveter saw him, and his weathered face registered a flicker of surprise, then something else, something softer. He ambled over, his expression unreadable. \"Heard you were down with the fever, lad,\" Davie said, his voice a low rumble. He looked Peter up and down, taking in his pale face and the dark circles under his eyes, the genuine signs of sleeplessness and anxiety that passed perfectly for the lingering effects of illness. \"Still look half-drowned. You should be at your bed.\" There was no anger, no judgment, only a gruff, paternal concern. \"I\u2019m away, Davie,\" Peter said, the words feeling momentous. \"Leaving the city.\" Davie nodded slowly, as if he\u2019d been expecting it. \"Aye,\" he said, and clapped a heavy hand on Peter\u2019s shoulder. \"Some birds aren't meant for this kind of cage. Good luck to you, son.\" And with that, he turned and walked back to his companion, the conversation over. The foreman in the office was less sentimental. He was a creature of ledgers and timetables, and Peter was merely a name to be crossed off a list. He slid the small brown envelope of wages across the counter without meeting Peter\u2019s eye, already turning his attention to the next piece of paperwork. Peter took the money, the tangible price of his freedom, and walked out of the shipyard gates without a backward glance, the shriek of metal being tortured into shape fading behind him for the last time.\n\nTheir final night in Glasgow was quiet and purposeful. With the money from the birds and Peter\u2019s wages secured in the tin trunk, they packed their few belongings. Peter discarded his oil-stained shipyard clothes in a corner, leaving them like a shed skin. He packed his handful of books, his clean shirts, and the small wooden wren Ewan had given him, which he wrapped in a spare sock for protection. The room, stripped of most of its carvings and their personal effects, felt large and empty, a hollowed-out space that held only the echo of the life they had lived within it. After a last meal of bread and cheese, they stood together at the window. The back court below was a slick, black mirror, reflecting nothing. In the tenement opposite, Peter\u2019s own window was a dark, vacant eye. For months, he had stared across this chasm, projecting all his loneliness and longing onto the figure on the other side. Now, that figure was standing beside him, his arm warm and solid around Peter\u2019s shoulders, and together they looked out at the empty space. \"Funny,\" Peter whispered. \"I used to think that was the whole world.\" Ewan pulled him closer. \"We were just reading the map,\" he said. \"Now we go find the place.\" They waited as the tenement settled, as the last lights blinked out, until the only sound was the wind sighing in the chimney pots. The time had come. With Ewan carrying the trunk and Peter his own satchel, they opened the door one last time. The air in the close was cold and smelled, as always, of damp and boiled cabbage. It was the scent of a life they were leaving forever. They descended the stairs, each step a silent farewell, their boots making no sound on the worn stone. They passed Peter\u2019s floor, and he did not look at his own door. They passed Mrs Gable's, and imagined her sleeping, oblivious to the flight of her two sick birds. At the main door, Ewan paused and set down the trunk. He looked at Peter, a question in his eyes. Peter simply nodded. Together, they put their shoulders to the heavy wooden door and pushed it open, stepping out into the cold, empty street. A light drizzle was beginning to fall, but it was cleansing now, washing the grime from the air as they turned their backs on the Gallowgate and began to walk towards the east, towards the distant promise of the sea and the clean, sharp scent of pine.The walk through the sleeping city was a journey through a graveyard of their own making. Every street corner, every shadowed close, was a monument to a life they had just buried. The sound of their footsteps, amplified in the pre-dawn stillness, seemed shockingly loud, a desecration of the quiet. Peter felt like a phantom, his satchel a sack of pilfered memories, while Ewan strode forward with a grim purpose, the tin trunk in his hand a ballast against the pull of the past. The light, persistent rain plastered Peter\u2019s hair to his forehead and trickled down his collar, a cold baptism into this new, untethered existence. He kept glancing over his shoulder, half-expecting to see the tenement looming behind them, a great, soot-stained beast unwilling to let them go. But there was nothing. The city dissolved behind them into a smear of weak, yellow light and misty darkness, its familiar scents of coal smoke and river damp giving way to the cleaner, sharper smell of wet roads and open, empty spaces. They were erasing themselves, footstep by footstep, from the only map they had ever known.\n\nThey reached the main artery leading north just as the sky began to bleed from black to a thin, watery grey. The road was a slick ribbon of asphalt, humming with the promise of distance. Here, they were no longer ghosts, but something far more vulnerable: two men with their lives in a box, waiting on the charity of strangers. Lorries began to appear, their headlamps cutting through the gloom like the eyes of monstrous, mythical beasts, their engines a growing roar that vibrated through the soles of Peter\u2019s boots. He stood back, feeling small and exposed, but Ewan stepped forward to the edge of the road, his posture confident, his thumb jutting out with a practiced, almost arrogant, flick. The first few lorries thundered past, spraying them with a fine mist of road-grime. But then one, a heavy flatbed carrying a load of timber shrouded in tarpaulin, slowed with a loud hiss of air brakes. The driver, a burly man with a face like a crumpled map and a cigarette dangling from his lips, leaned across the cab. \"Where to?\" he yelled over the idling engine. \"North,\" Ewan called back, his voice steady. \"As far as you're going.\" The man grunted, nodded at the back. \"Perth. Chuck your gear in the back. Get in.\" The relief was a physical thing, unknotting a tight coil of fear in Peter\u2019s chest. They heaved the trunk onto the flatbed and scrambled into the high, warm cab, the smell of diesel and stale tobacco a welcome fug against the morning\u2019s chill.\n\nAs the lorry gained speed, the world outside the wide windscreen began to change with a speed that left Peter breathless. The last of the city\u2019s industrial suburbs, with their skeletal gantries and grim-faced factories, fell away, replaced by rolling fields of winter-brown grass, patchworked with low stone walls and dotted with stoic, lonely-looking sheep. For the first time in his life, Peter saw the horizon as a clean, unbroken line. The sky, vast and bruised with cloud, was a revelation. It wasn't the small, framed square he was used to seeing from his window, but a great, arching dome that dwarfed everything beneath it. He had read descriptions of landscapes like this, of hills that 'rolled like the sea', but the words were a pale, flimsy substitute for the reality of it, for the sheer, staggering scale of the world beyond the Gallowgate. He sat pressed against the passenger door, his face turned to the window, utterly rapt. He felt Ewan\u2019s gaze on him and turned to see a soft, knowing smile on his face. Ewan didn\u2019t speak, he just gave a slight nod, a silent acknowledgment that said, *See? This is it. This is the place.* And in that shared, silent moment, Peter felt the last of the city\u2019s grime being washed from his soul.\n\nThe driver dropped them at a crossroads somewhere south of Perth as the sun was beginning its descent, painting the undersides of the clouds in shades of bruised orange and purple. The sudden silence after the lorry\u2019s departure was deafening, broken only by the whisper of the wind through a stand of skeletal birch trees. The air was cold and sharp, smelling of damp earth and something else, a clean, peaty scent that was the very essence of the countryside. They were truly alone. With the light failing, a new, more primal anxiety set in. Hunger, and the need for shelter. They walked for half a mile down a narrow side road until they spotted it: a derelict stone barn, its roof sagging in the middle but mostly intact, its doorway a gaping black mouth. It was not a home, but it was a reprieve. Inside, the air was thick with the ghost-scent of old hay and livestock. As Ewan set the trunk down with a weary thud, a handful of startled pigeons burst from the rafters and fled into the twilight. They made their camp in a dry corner, the trunk serving as their table. They ate bread and hard cheese, the simple food tasting better than any hot meal Peter had ever had. As the last of the light died, leaving them in a profound, starless dark, they unrolled their single blanket and huddled together for warmth, their backs against the cold stone wall. The world outside was vast and wild and unknown, but here, in the dark, with the solid weight of Ewan beside him, Peter felt a sense of safety more absolute than any he had ever known.Peter woke to a cold so profound it felt like a solid thing, a block of ice he was encased in. It was a different cold from the city\u2019s damp, insidious chill that seeped into the lungs; this was a clean, sharp, absolute cold that bit at his exposed cheeks and turned his breath into a cloud of white vapour. He was pressed against Ewan\u2019s back, their shared blanket a pitifully thin barrier against the pre-dawn frost that had silvered the broken flagstones of the barn floor. For a moment, disoriented, he thought he was back in his room in the Gallowgate, the cold a familiar enemy. But then he smelled it: not soot and damp stone, but the rich, loamy scent of earth, the ghost of hay, and the sharp tang of frost on sleeping fields. He was free. And this was the price of it. He shifted slightly, and Ewan stirred, a low grunt escaping him as he pulled the blanket tighter around them, his arm instinctively tightening around Peter\u2019s waist. In the deep, resonant stillness, Peter could hear the rustle of a mouse in the straw and, far away, the lonely cry of a curlew. The fear was still there, a small, cold stone in his gut, but it was overshadowed by a feeling so vast and new he had no name for it, a feeling of being utterly alive in the immensity of the world.\n\nTheir morning ablutions were a spartan affair at a cattle trough in a nearby field, the water so cold it made Peter\u2019s teeth ache and his skin sting. They shared the last of their bread, which was stale, and a piece of hard cheese, their hands blue and clumsy with the cold. Yet, there was an easy grace to their movements, a wordless communication that had been forged in the crucible of their confined week. Ewan broke the cheese with his thumbs and handed half to Peter. Peter uncorked their water bottle and passed it to Ewan. These simple acts of sharing felt more significant than any grand declaration, a testament to their new reality. They were a single unit of two, adrift in the world, their survival dependent on this quiet, instinctive partnership. Ewan, his face etched with weariness but his eyes clear and focused, studied the crumpled map he had bought with the last of his own money before they left. He traced a line with his finger, his brow furrowed in concentration. \"There's a main road about two miles east of here,\" he said, his voice a low rumble in the cold air. \"Goes all the way to Aberdeen. If we can get a ride on that, we'll be there by nightfall.\" He folded the map and looked at Peter, a silent question in his eyes. *Are you ready?* Peter simply nodded, pulling his thin coat tighter around him, and they set off, their breath pluming in front of them as they walked into the rising sun.\n\nThe walk was harder than Peter had imagined. The road was a muddy track, and the two miles felt more like ten, his city-softened muscles protesting with every step. But the landscape was a constant, unfolding miracle that distracted him from the ache in his legs. He saw hills that were the colour of old tweed, swaths of dark, brooding forest, and burns that chattered over stones, the water a startling, clear amber. He was seeing the country that Ewan had spoken of, the world that had shaped him. He watched Ewan stride ahead, his long-legged gait eating up the ground, his posture relaxed and confident. Here, Ewan was not the furtive, watchful man of the Gallowgate; he was a native, his senses attuned to the wind and the sky. He pointed out the distant shape of a buzzard circling high above, identified the tracks of a fox in the mud, and named the trees that clustered in the hollows. It was a language Peter didn't speak, but he listened with a hungry intensity, feeling his understanding of Ewan deepening with every shared observation. The pine-scented man from the tenement was finally in his forest, and Peter was seeing him whole for the first time.\n\nThey reached the main road, a wider, busier artery, and the waiting began again. This time, it was a lorry hauling livestock, the air around it thick with the smell of the animals and the road. The driver was a wiry, older man with a suspicious squint who barely spoke, but he was heading to Aberdeen and, for the price of one of Peter\u2019s last few shillings, he grunted and nodded them into the cab. The journey was loud and rattling, the cab filled with the driver\u2019s tuneless whistling and the constant, mournful complaints of the sheep in the back. The driver\u2019s silence was more unnerving than the last one\u2019s garrulousness; his eyes kept flicking to them in the rearview mirror, a silent, ongoing assessment. Peter sat rigidly, hyper-aware of his hand resting on the seat close to Ewan\u2019s, conscious of the easy way Ewan leaned his shoulder against the cab door. He felt the old city fear prickle at him, the ingrained habit of hiding. But Ewan seemed oblivious. He stared out at the passing landscape, a calm, proprietary look on his face, as if he owned every hill and river they passed. When the driver finally dropped them at a desolate roundabout on the outskirts of Aberdeen, Peter felt a wave of relief so strong his knees almost buckled as he jumped down from the cab.\n\nAberdeen was a shock. It was a city, but a city made of granite, not soot-stained sandstone. The buildings were grey and glittering, hard-edged and severe under a sky that was scoured clean by a relentless wind blowing in from the North Sea. The air tasted of salt and fish, a stark, bracing contrast to Glasgow\u2019s thick, industrial fug. They were exhausted, bone-weary and hungry, the last of their money having gone to the lorry driver. The reality of their situation hit Peter with renewed force. They had made it, but they had arrived with nothing but the clothes on their backs, a tin trunk, and the name of a timber plantation somewhere up the coast. The brief euphoria of the journey gave way to the cold, hard facts of survival. He saw a baker\u2019s shop, its window piled high with golden rolls and pastries, and his stomach cramped with a hunger so sharp it was almost a pain. He looked at Ewan, a question and a flicker of his old panic in his eyes. Ewan followed his gaze to the bakery, and his jaw tightened. \"Cal's place is another six miles up the coast,\" he said, his voice low. \"We walk. We'll be there before it's fully dark.\" He shouldered the strap of his satchel, his expression grim. \"No more stopping. We get there.\" There was no choice. They turned their backs on the city\u2019s tantalising warmth and started the long walk north, the roar of the unseen sea growing louder with every step.\n\nThe final six miles were a pilgrimage. The road clung to the coastline, a narrow track with the furious, grey sea on one side and a rising wall of dark, dense forest on the other. The wind was a physical force, tearing at their clothes and trying to push them from the path. It carried the scream of gulls and the deep, percussive boom of waves crashing against rocks below. This was a different world entirely, a place of raw, elemental power that made the city\u2019s dangers seem small and petty. Peter leaned into the wind, his head down, his body a single, aching protest. He was running on nothing but fumes and the sheer, stubborn refusal to be the one who fell behind. He focused on the steady rhythm of Ewan\u2019s boots on the gravel in front of him, using it as a metronome to drive his own exhausted legs forward. Just as he felt he could not take another step, Ewan stopped. He had paused at a gap in the stone wall, his hand resting on the top stone, his gaze fixed on the land that sloped down towards the sea. Peter came to a halt beside him, panting, and followed his gaze.\n\nBelow them, stretching for as far as the eye could see, was the forest. It was a vast, dark green ocean of pine trees, their ranks marching down the rugged hillsides right to the edge of the cliffs, where the sea gnawed at the land. The sheer scale of it was breathtaking. Through the dense canopy, Peter could see cleared tracks and the distant, glinting roofs of a few low buildings clustered in a hollow near the shore. A plume of woodsmoke rose from a chimney, a thin, vertical line of grey against the deep green, a sign of life in the immense wilderness. The air was thick with the scent Ewan had always carried with him, a powerful, intoxicating perfume of pine resin, salt, and damp earth. This was it. This was the place from the stories, the source of the carved birds, the heart of Ewan\u2019s secret world. It was wilder, bigger, and more intimidating than anything Peter could have imagined. Ewan turned to him, his face weathered by the wind, his eyes alight with a fierce, proprietary pride. \"Well,\" he said, his voice almost carried away by the wind. \"This is it, Peter. This is the garden.\" Peter looked from the vast, roaring sea to the endless, whispering forest, then back to the man standing beside him. He was exhausted, hungry, and had not a penny to his name. But as he stood there, with the wooden wren safe in his pocket and Ewan's solid presence beside him, he felt not fear, but a quiet, trembling sense of arrival. He had walked off the edge of his old map and, impossibly, had found his way home.The descent from the road was a journey into another element. The wind that had scoured the cliffs above softened to a soughing whisper as they entered the shelter of the pines. The path was a treacherous track of slick, dark earth and tangled roots, and Peter, clumsy with exhaustion, stumbled several times, his hands brushing against bark that was rough and sticky with resin. The air grew thick and cool, heavy with the powerful, cathedral-like scent of a million pine needles, a scent so pure and overwhelming it seemed to scour the last of the city\u2019s pollution from his lungs. The roar of the sea faded, replaced by the creak and groan of the trees, the distant chatter of a hidden burn, and the soft crunch of their own boots on the forest floor. Peter watched Ewan move ahead of him, and it was like watching a man step back into his own skin. The last vestiges of the city\u2019s coiled tension fell away from his shoulders. He moved with an easy, silent grace, his head up, reading the signs of the forest as easily as Peter would read a printed page. He belonged here, and the rightness of it was as absolute and undeniable as the towering trees around them.\n\nThe settlement appeared suddenly in a wide clearing, a small cluster of rugged, functional buildings that seemed to have grown from the earth itself. There were long, low bunkhouses built from rough-hewn logs, a larger structure from which the scent of cooking food emanated, and an open-sided workshop where the air was hazy with sawdust and the clean, sharp smell of freshly cut wood. A few men, their faces weathered and bearded, their clothes stained with sweat and resin, stopped what they were doing to watch their approach. Their stillness was unnerving, their gazes direct and assessing, utterly different from the furtive, sideways glances of the Gallowgate. They looked at Ewan, and a flicker of recognition, of surprise, passed among them. They looked at Peter, and their faces were blank, unreadable masks. There was no welcome here, but no immediate hostility either; just the patient, watchful curiosity of men who lived by their own rules in a world far removed from any Peter had ever known.\n\nA man emerged from the largest cabin, wiping his hands on a greasy rag tucked into his belt. He was built on the same generous scale as Ewan, with the same broad shoulders, but where Ewan was a wanderer, this man was an anchor. His hair was a darker shade of brown, his face leaner, carved by wind and work into something harder and more severe. He stopped dead when he saw them, the rag in his hands stilled. For a long moment, the two brothers just looked at each other across the clearing, the twenty yards between them filled with years of unspoken history. \"Thought a bad penny always turned up,\" the man said, his voice a low, gravelly rumble that was an echo of Ewan\u2019s own. Ewan\u2019s mouth quirked into a ghost of his lopsided smile. \"Only when it's spent, Cal,\" he replied. He took the last few steps forward and gestured with his head towards Peter, who had come to a halt a few feet behind him, feeling intensely out of place. \"This is Peter,\" Ewan said, the introduction simple, declarative. \"He\u2019s with me.\"\n\nCal\u2019s eyes, a paler, flintier grey than Ewan's, shifted to Peter. He subjected him to a long, slow appraisal that travelled from his worn-out city boots to his pale, exhausted face and back again. It was not an unkind look, but it was utterly devoid of sentiment. It was the look a man gives a piece of timber to judge its strength, or the sky to judge the coming weather. Peter felt himself being weighed and measured, and found wanting. He stood his ground, his chin up, his hand unconsciously checking for the small, hard shape of the wooden wren in his pocket. The silence stretched, thick and uncomfortable. Finally, Cal\u2019s gaze moved back to Ewan, and a silent, lightning-fast conversation seemed to pass between them, an exchange of questions and answers that needed no words. At last, Cal gave a short, sharp nod, his judgment made. \"He looks half-dead from the cold,\" he said, his voice flat. \"Both of you. Get inside. Annie\u2019s made stew.\" He turned his back on them without another word and strode back towards the cabin, the dismissal and the invitation delivered in the same brusque, practical gesture.\n\nThe inside of the cookhouse was a haven of warmth and light. A huge, cast-iron stove dominated one wall, radiating a heat that felt like a physical blessing, and the air was thick with the rich, savoury smell of roasting meat and onions. A long, scarred wooden table, big enough to seat twenty men, ran down the centre of the room. A stout, grey-haired woman with kind eyes and flour on her forearms\u2014Annie, Peter presumed\u2014nodded at them as Cal ladled two deep bowls of stew from a cavernous pot. They sat at the end of the long table, and Peter ate with a ravenous, desperate speed, the thick, hot stew a miracle in his throat. It was simple food, just meat and barley and root vegetables, but it was the most delicious thing he had ever tasted. The warmth spread through him, chasing out the last of the cold, and with it, a wave of exhaustion so profound it was all he could do to keep his head from falling forward into the empty bowl. He had made it. They had made it. The sheer, impossible reality of it was as overwhelming as the food and the heat.\n\nAfter the bowls were empty, Cal sat down opposite them with a mug of black, steaming tea. He looked at Ewan, his expression less guarded now that the duties of a host had been fulfilled. \"So,\" he began, his voice low. \"The city finally spit you out?\" Ewan leaned back, stretching his long legs under the table. He didn't recount the fever, or the hiding, or the desperate flight. He distilled the entire complex tragedy into a few, spare words. \"The work dried up,\" he said. \"It was time for a change of air.\" Cal nodded slowly, accepting the edited version. He knew his brother. He didn't need the details, only the truth that lay beneath them. He took a long sip of his tea, his flinty eyes moving to Peter once more. \"We can always use another pair of hands, if he's not afraid of the work. There's an empty bunk in the east cabin. You can share it.\" He said it casually, as if it were the most natural thing in the world. \"Sawmill starts at six. Can you handle an axe, Peter?\" The direct question, the casual offer of a shared space, a shared life, all delivered in the same practical, no-nonsense tone. Peter looked at Ewan, who gave him a barely perceptible nod, and then he met Cal\u2019s gaze directly. \"I can learn,\" he said, his voice hoarse but steady. And with that simple exchange, the final brick of their new life clicked into place.Cal led them from the cookhouse into the biting night air. The sudden cold was a shock after the fug of the stove, and Peter drew his thin coat tighter, the warmth of the stew a fading memory in his belly. The stars overhead were a brilliant, scattered dust of ice, a sight so vast and clear it made him feel dizzy. Their destination was a long, low building identical to the others, its log walls dark against the frosted ground. Cal pushed open the heavy plank door, and a wall of scent hit them: the dense, animal smell of sleeping men, of damp wool, sawdust, and the sharp, clean bite of pine sap that seemed to have permeated the very wood of the structure. The interior was a cavern of shadows, a single lantern at the far end casting long, dancing shapes. A row of rough-hewn bunk beds lined each wall, each a small territory of rumpled blankets and scant possessions. A chorus of snores and heavy breathing rose and fell in the gloom. It was a space stripped of all privacy, a communal den built for the sole purpose of rest after labour.\n\n\"Bunk in the far corner's free,\" Cal said, his voice a low rumble that didn't disturb the sleeping men. \"It's wider. Should fit the two of you.\" He turned to leave, then paused, his hand on the door. \"The bell rings at five. Breakfast is at half-past. Sawmill starts at six. Don't be late.\" Then he was gone, pulling the door shut behind him, leaving them standing in the near-darkness, the casual weight of his words settling around Peter like a heavy blanket. *Should fit the two of you.* It wasn't a question or a judgment. It was a simple, practical statement of fact, as mundane as the starting time for the sawmill. There was one empty bunk and two men. The solution was obvious. In this world, driven by the hard logic of work and weather, their secret was not a secret at all, but a simple matter of logistics. A wave of relief so profound it felt like a physical impact washed over Peter, and for a moment he had to steady himself against the central beam, the sheer, unassuming acceptance of it all more disarming than any shouted accusation could ever have been.\n\nThey found the bunk in the corner, a wide platform with a mattress stuffed thick with straw that rustled as Ewan threw their satchels onto it. Cal had left two coarse, heavy wool blankets folded at the foot. As they stripped off their damp outer layers in the frigid air, the momentousness of the simple act struck Peter with full force. They were not hiding in the dark, stealing a moment of desperate intimacy. They were simply two men preparing for bed at the end of a long day, their place in this small, rough world sanctioned and defined. When they finally slid under the blankets, the shared space felt both impossibly vast and deeply comforting. The straw-filled mattress was lumpy, the blankets smelled faintly of sheep, but the solid, radiating warmth of Ewan\u2019s body next to his was the most luxurious thing Peter had ever felt. He curled on his side, his back pressed against Ewan\u2019s chest, and felt an arm slide around his waist, pulling him close. Exhaustion, deep and absolute, claimed him instantly. He fell into a profound, dreamless sleep, anchored by the weight of the man beside him and the symphony of the forest outside\u2014the whisper of wind in the pines and the distant, rhythmic roar of the sea.\n\nThe bell was a brutal, jarring clang that shattered the darkness. For a confused second, Peter thought it was the shriek of metal from the shipyard, a sound from a past life. Then the cold hit him, and the chorus of groans and curses from the other men as they stirred from their bunks. His body was a single, unified protest of aches. Muscles he hadn't known he possessed screamed in rebellion from the long walk. Ewan was already moving, swinging his legs out of the bunk with an economy of motion that spoke of long familiarity with such mornings. He saw Peter grimacing as he tried to sit up and tossed him a thick, felted wool shirt. \"Put this on,\" he said, his voice a low rasp. \"It gets colder before the sun is properly up. And your city boots won't last a day. I'll find you a spare pair.\" The advice was practical, devoid of sentiment, but it was a lifeline. In the dim, smoky light of the newly-lit lanterns, Peter watched the other men pull on heavy boots and thick trousers, their movements slow and deliberate, conserving energy for the day ahead. This was his new life: a bell in the dark, a borrowed shirt, and a day of labour he was utterly unprepared for.\n\nCal was true to his word. After a quick, silent breakfast of thick, hot porridge and black tea, he led Peter not to the sawmill, but to the edge of the clearing where a dozen enormous pine trees lay like felled giants. He handed Peter a felling axe, its handle worn smooth with use, its head a heavy, wicked-looking wedge of steel. \"The yard work made your arms strong, but this is different,\" Cal said, his tone that of a teacher, not a tyrant. \"It's about rhythm, not brute force. Your job is limbing. Strip every branch from these trunks, clean to the wood. Stack the branches by size. The small stuff for Annie's stove, the thick stuff for the charcoal kilns. Watch the others. And for God's sake, mind your footing. This ground is treacherous.\" He demonstrated a single, perfect swing, the axe head biting deep into the base of a thick branch, shearing it off with a sharp crack. The motion was fluid, powerful, and deceptively easy. Then he left Peter alone with a fallen tree that looked as long as a Gallowgate street.\n\nThe first hour was a lesson in humility. The axe felt like a clumsy, unwieldy club in Peter\u2019s hands. His swings were awkward, either glancing off the resilient branches or biting in too deep, jarring his arms and shoulders with every mistimed blow. The shipyard had been about noise and fire, the taming of molten metal in a confined, deafening space. This was a battle against something organic and obstinate, fought in the cold, open air. The other men worked around him, their movements a blur of terrifying efficiency. He could feel their silent judgment, the occasional pause in their own work to watch the clumsy efforts of the newcomer. Once, he lost his grip entirely, the axe flying from his hands and burying itself in the soft earth a few feet away. A low chuckle rippled from a nearby pair of workers, and the shame was a hot, stinging flush on his cold cheeks. He wanted the ground to swallow him. But then he saw Ewan, working on a parallel tree, who caught his eye and gave a slight, almost imperceptible shake of his head, a silent command: *Ignore them. Keep going.* Peter retrieved the axe, his jaw set in a hard line, and forced himself to focus, not on the men, but on the tree, on the memory of Cal\u2019s perfect, fluid swing.\n\nAt mid-day, Annie appeared with a cart, dispensing thick sandwiches of bread and cold meat, and a huge metal churn of hot, sweet tea. The men dropped their tools and gathered, eating quickly and talking in low, guttural bursts about timber yields and a predicted change in the weather. Peter found a spot on a log beside Ewan, his hands so stiff and raw he could barely hold his sandwich. He had blisters forming on both palms, angry red welts that promised a world of pain to come. Ewan took one of his hands, turning it over to inspect the damage with a practiced eye. \"You're gripping too tight,\" he said, his voice quiet, for Peter\u2019s ears only. \"You're fighting the axe. Let its weight do the work for you. Guide it, don't force it.\" He pulled a small tin of foul-smelling, greenish salve from his pocket\u2014the same one he'd used on his own hands\u2014and wordlessly began to rub it into Peter\u2019s raw palms. The gesture was so open, so un-selfconscious, that none of the other men paid it the slightest attention. It was simply one man tending to another, a practical act in a world governed by practicality.\n\nBy the time the bell rang to signal the end of the day, Peter felt a weariness so profound it was almost a spiritual state. His entire body was a single, throbbing ache. He trudged back to the bunkhouse in a stupor, his footsteps heavy and leaden. The simple acts of pulling off his new, heavy boots and washing his face in a basin of icy water required a monumental effort of will. But as he sat in the cookhouse that evening, a bowl of rich, thick soup warming his hands and the scent of woodsmoke in his hair, a new feeling began to surface beneath the exhaustion. It was a feeling of deep, bone-felt satisfaction. He had survived. He had faced the forest, the work, and the silent judgment of the men, and he had not broken. Later, lying in their bunk in the warm darkness, the aches in his body a dull, rhythmic thrum, Ewan\u2019s arm came around him. \"You did well today,\" Ewan murmured into his hair, his voice thick with sleep. \"You didn't quit.\" Peter was too tired to form a reply. He simply leaned back into the solid warmth of Ewan's body, his mind empty, his body spent. He had endured his first day in the garden, and as he drifted into a heavy, healing sleep, he knew, with a certainty that settled deep in his marrow, that he had finally, truly, begun to put down roots.The days that followed fell into a brutal, simple rhythm, governed by the clang of the bell and the slow, circling passage of the sun above the pines. Each morning, Peter woke in the warm haven of the bunk to a body that screamed a litany of new and inventive pains. The dull ache of the first day had sharpened into a fierce, articulate agony in his shoulders, his lower back, and most of all, his hands. The blisters had broken, leaving raw, weeping patches of skin on his palms that seared with pain at the slightest touch. Getting dressed was an ordeal of stiff, protesting limbs, and the walk to the cookhouse a slow, hobbling procession. The romance of their escape had been burned away by the harsh, unyielding reality of the work, leaving only the grim necessity of survival. He saw the doubt in the eyes of the other men, a silent wager on how long the city boy would last before he broke.\n\nOut in the forest clearing, the axe was an instrument of torture. Every swing sent a shockwave of pain from his raw hands up his arms. His initial attempts to replicate Cal\u2019s effortless grace were clumsy, pathetic failures. He was fighting a war on two fronts: one against the stubborn resilience of the pine branches, the other against the mutiny of his own body. He felt a rising tide of despair, a frustration so keen it brought hot tears to his eyes, which he angrily blinked away before anyone could see. He was a fraud, a boy who read about heroes, utterly useless when faced with the simple, honest challenge of a felled tree. He was just another piece of city grime that had washed up on their shore, and soon the tide of the work would drag him back out to sea.\n\nThe change came not as a sudden epiphany, but as a slow, painful surrender. Halfway through the third morning, his hands on fire, his back a knot of searing pain, he simply stopped. He leaned against the rough bark of the trunk, the axe hanging limply from his fingers, and closed his eyes, breathing in the cold, resinous air. He remembered Ewan's quiet words by the log pile: *Guide it, don't force it.* He had been trying to conquer the tree, to impose his will upon it through sheer, desperate effort. He opened his eyes, looked at the axe, and then at the smooth, flowing grain of the wood. He took a breath, adjusted his grip as Ewan had shown him, relaxing his fingers, and lifted the axe. This time, he didn't aim for a powerful, shattering blow. He aimed for a single point, letting the heavy head of the axe fall in a natural arc, his body moving with it, not against it. The blade hit with a clean, satisfying *thwack*, shearing a thick branch away with a sound like a breaking bone. There was no jarring shock, only a smooth transfer of energy, a feeling of rightness that was as surprising as it was profound. He did it again, and then again, slowly finding the rhythm, the secret cadence of the work.\n\nFrom that moment on, the days began to transform. The work was still brutally hard, the exhaustion at the end of each day absolute, but the sharp edges of his despair began to wear away. He learned to read the language of the wood, to see the lines of force in a branch, to anticipate how it would split. The axe, once an enemy, became a familiar extension of his own arms, its weight a comfort, its worn handle a familiar landscape beneath his slowly toughening hands. His body, in turn, began its own slow transformation. The soft, pale skin of his palms thickened into a protective layer of callus. The undefined muscles of his arms and back hardened into taut, functional cords. He grew leaner, harder, the last of the city\u2019s pallor scoured from his face by the wind and the sun. He was being remade by the forest, stripped down to his essential self and rebuilt with stronger materials. The other men, who had initially watched him with a mixture of pity and contempt, began to nod at him in the mornings, their greetings gruff but genuine. One afternoon, an older man named Findlay, a giant with a beard like a tangled bird's nest, paused by his tree. \"You're holding the handle wrong for that angle, lad,\" he grunted, and spent two minutes demonstrating a different grip that saved Peter\u2019s back from a world of unnecessary strain. The small, freely-given lesson was a quiet act of acceptance, an acknowledgment that he was no longer a guest, but part of the crew.\n\nTheir evenings in the bunkhouse became the anchor of his new life. The small, shared bunk in the corner was a world unto itself, a private island in the public sea of the sleeping quarters. After the exhaustion of the day, there was little energy for long conversations. Their intimacy was a thing of quiet, practical gestures. It was Ewan checking Peter\u2019s hands each night, his rough fingers surprisingly gentle as he applied the pungent green salve to the new calluses. It was Peter saving a portion of his own tea for Ewan when he was late back from a task for Cal. It was the simple, unspoken comfort of lying in the dark, their tired bodies pressed together, a silent bulwark against the cold and the immense, wild darkness outside. Sometimes, when the ache in his muscles was too loud to allow for immediate sleep, Peter would lie awake and watch the slow, rhythmic rise and fall of Ewan\u2019s chest, and a feeling of profound, quiet gratitude would wash over him. He had followed this man from a world of shadows and whispers into a world of hard truths and clean, sharp air, and in doing so, he had found not just a refuge, but a foundation.\n\nOne evening, a week into his new life, as Ewan was tending to a small cut on Peter\u2019s forearm, a splinter from a rogue branch, Peter looked down at his own hands. They were almost unrecognizable. They were stained with pine tar, criss-crossed with small, healing scratches, the nails permanently grimed with earth. They were not the hands of a boy who turned the delicate pages of a book; they were the hands of a man who worked. He thought of the Peter in Glasgow, the lonely, fearful observer who lived vicariously through the stories of others, and he felt a vast, unbridgeable distance from that person. The fear that had been the constant background noise of his life had been replaced by the honest ache of labour, the anxiety of survival replaced by the simple, driving need to meet the bell in the morning. He flexed his fingers, feeling the pull of new muscle, the toughness of his own skin. He was still tired, still sore, but he was no longer fragile. The garden, he realized, was not just the forest around him. It was the new ground he was claiming inside himself, a place where he was learning not just to survive, but to grow.The pain did not vanish. It simply changed its nature, transforming from the sharp, insistent cry of abused muscles into a dull, thrumming baseline, the familiar song of his own body\u2019s strength. A month after their arrival, Peter moved through the forest with a competence that astonished him. The axe was no longer a foreign object but a part of him, its rhythm ingrained in his sinews. He worked alongside Findlay, the old giant, their two axes rising and falling in a steady, hypnotic cadence, a percussive duet that was their only necessary conversation. He learned to feel the weather in the ache of his joints, to gauge the time by the slant of the sun through the high canopy, to find a deep, almost spiritual satisfaction in the neat, orderly stacks of timber he left in his wake. The city boy was a ghost, a half-remembered story he might have read about someone else. The man who took his place was leaner, quieter, and as tough and resilient as the roots that snaked beneath his feet.\n\nThe routine was the bedrock of their lives, a predictable cycle of work, food, and sleep that left little room for uncertainty. But one evening, as the bell\u2019s final clang echoed through the trees, Ewan broke the pattern. As the other men trudged wearily towards the promise of Annie\u2019s stew, he caught Peter\u2019s arm, his grip firm. \"Not yet,\" he said, his voice low. \"Walk with me.\" There was no command in his tone, only an invitation, a quiet offering of something outside the routine. Peter, his own weariness momentarily forgotten, simply nodded. The prospect of a few stolen minutes alone with Ewan, away from the communal warmth and noise of the cookhouse, was a luxury more tempting than any hot meal.\n\nEwan led him away from the main camp, following a narrow, winding deer-track that Peter had never taken before. The forest was a different creature in the gloaming. The shadows between the trees deepened from grey to a rich, velvety black, and the air grew still and cold, holding the scent of damp moss and decaying leaves. The boisterous sounds of the camp faded behind them, replaced by the deep, resonant silence of the woods, a silence punctuated by the snap of a twig underfoot or the distant, mournful hoot of an early-rising owl. They walked without speaking, their shoulders occasionally brushing, the shared silence as comfortable and familiar as the blankets on their bunk. After a ten-minute walk, the trees began to thin, and the roar of the sea, which was a constant, muted background hum at the camp, grew louder, more immediate. They emerged from the tree line onto a high, windswept headland of granite and tough, salt-strafed grass.\n\nBelow them, the North Sea was a vast, turbulent expanse of churning pewter, its white-crested waves crashing against the black, jagged rocks at the base of the cliffs with a force that seemed to shake the very ground they stood on. The sky was a masterpiece of bruised purple and faded rose, the last light of the sun bleeding away at the far horizon. The wind was a wild, untamed thing here, tearing at their clothes and whipping their hair across their faces. They found shelter in the lee of a monolithic granite boulder, a natural wall that shielded them from the worst of the gale. Ewan cupped his hands against the wind, his back to Peter, and with a few tries, managed to light one of their thinly-rolled cigarettes. He took a long drag, the red tip glowing brightly in the deepening twilight, and then passed it to Peter. The smoke, harsh and familiar, was a small, warm anchor in the immensity of the scene.\n\nPeter took a slow, deep lungful, the smoke momentarily steadying him against the breathtaking scale of the view. He looked down at his hand holding the cigarette, at the hard-earned calluses, the ingrained dirt, the network of fine, silvery scars. \"These don't feel like my hands anymore,\" he said, the words snatched from his lips by the wind. \"I look at them, and I don't recognise the person they belong to. He knows how to use an axe. He isn't afraid of the cold. He isn't\u2026 afraid.\" He looked at Ewan, whose face was a mask of shadows, only his eyes catching the last of the light. \"I spent my whole life in Glasgow being afraid. Of the noise, of the silence, of what people would think, of what I was. I didn't even realise how much space it took up inside me until it was gone.\"\n\nEwan was quiet for a long time, watching the endless, rhythmic assault of the waves on the shore below. He took the cigarette back from Peter, his fingers brushing against Peter's. \"I was afraid, too,\" he confessed, his voice so low Peter had to lean in to hear it over the wind. \"When we first got here. I watched you with that axe, and you looked like a sapling in a storm. I thought\u2026 I thought this place was going to break you.\" He turned to face Peter, his gaze intense, stripped of all pretence. \"This forest, this coast\u2026 it\u2019s the only place I ever felt I belonged. I brought you here, into the one part of the world that was truly mine, and I was terrified it wouldn't be big enough for you. That it would chew you up and spit you out, and I'd be alone in it again.\" It was the most vulnerable Peter had ever seen him, a confession that laid bare the deep fear of loss that underpinned his quiet strength.\n\nThis was a truth far deeper than any whispered endearment in the dark of their bunk. It was the bedrock on which their shared life was built. Peter reached out, not with the hesitant touch of the boy in the tenement, but with the steady confidence of the man he was becoming. He took Ewan\u2019s hand, lacing his calloused fingers through Ewan\u2019s own. It was a meeting of equals, a joining of two people who had been remade, both by their shared past and by this hard, beautiful place. It was a silent, binding promise. As they stood there, hands clasped, a new sound joined the roar of the sea\u2014a faint, high-pitched, lonely cry from high above. Ewan tilted his head, his gaze sweeping the darkening sky. He pointed. \"Look.\" A long, wavering V-formation of geese was etched against the last vestiges of colour in the sky, heading resolutely south. \"They're leaving,\" Ewan said, his voice quiet, matter-of-fact. \"Winter's coming.\" The sight was beautiful and profoundly desolate, a stark reminder that their small, hard-won sanctuary was about to be tested by a force far greater than any foreman or suspicious landlady.\n\nThey walked back to the camp in a deep, companionable silence, the shared knowledge of the coming challenge hanging between them not as a threat, but as the next chapter they would face together. The cookhouse was a beacon of light and warmth, the boisterous shouts and laughter of the men a welcome shield against the vast, cold darkness outside. Later, as they lay in their bunk, the sounds of the other men\u2019s sleep a familiar chorus around them, Peter felt the press of the wind against the log walls, a low, mournful howl that promised colder nights to come. But curled against Ewan\u2019s back, feeling the steady, slow rhythm of his breathing, he felt no fear. The city had been a cage that kept the world out. This place was a wilderness that invited the world in, demanding strength and resilience in return. They had survived the fall; now they would endure the winter. Together. The garden was being prepared for a long, deep sleep, and they would guard its roots until the spring.The winter did not arrive with the gentle grace of a dusting on a postcard. It descended like a siege. For days, the sky had been a low, oppressive ceiling of bruised, colourless cloud, and the wind, which had been their constant companion on the cliffs, fell away into an unnerving, absolute stillness. The sea\u2019s roar became a muffled, distant thunder, as if the world were holding its breath. The men in the camp grew quiet, their usual boisterous energy replaced by a watchful, introspective mood. They checked the seals on the windows, stacked firewood higher against the bunkhouse walls, and oiled their tools with a grim, focused industry. They were shoring up the ramparts against a known and respected enemy. Then, one afternoon as the light was already beginning to fail, it began. The first flakes were not small and delicate, but large and wet, like scraps of sodden linen falling from the grey sky. They melted as they hit the ground, turning the clearing into a dark, muddy slurry. But they did not stop. As the last of the twilight vanished, the temperature plummeted, and the wet flakes became a hard, dry, silent torrent of white.\n\nPeter stood at the small, grimy window of the bunkhouse, watching the world disappear. The familiar shapes of the cookhouse and the workshop blurred, softened, and then were erased completely, swallowed by the swirling, hypnotic curtain of snow. The noise of the camp vanished, the world outside muffled into a profound, humming silence that was more absolute than anything he had ever experienced. The only sounds were the whisper of the snow against the glass and the low crackle of the stove inside, a sound that seemed impossibly fragile against the immense, silent power of the storm. The other men, finished with their evening meal, settled into the long night. Some played cards by the weak light of a lantern, their faces grimly focused. Others sat mending torn clothes or sharpening their axes, their movements economical and meditative. An air of quiet endurance filled the room. This was not a novelty; it was a known hardship to be weathered. Peter felt a hand on his shoulder and turned to see Ewan standing behind him, two steaming mugs of tea in his hands. Ewan didn't speak, just nodded towards the window, his expression a mixture of respect and grim resignation for the elemental force outside. They stood side-by-side, watching the blizzard rage, two silent sentinels guarding the small, warm pocket of life they had found against the vast, indifferent white of the world.\n\nThe morning bell was a muffled, distant clang, as if ringing from another country. When Cal heaved open the bunkhouse door, it was to a world remade, a landscape of impossible, sculptural beauty and stark, new dangers. The snow had stopped, leaving behind a deep, pristine blanket of white that had buried every familiar contour of the clearing. It lay in heavy, precarious drifts against the cabins and had transformed the felled logs and piles of branches into strange, organic mounds. The air was eye-wateringly cold and so still that the smoke from the cookhouse chimney rose in a perfectly straight, grey column against a sky of pale, washed-out blue. The beauty of it was breathtaking, an artist\u2019s dream of pure form and light, but it was a hostile beauty. Every step was a struggle through thigh-deep powder. Every tool handle was a shock of vicious, biting cold. The trees in the forest were no longer just trees; they were laden with a crushing weight of snow, their branches bowed, creaking and groaning under the strain, each one a potential \"widow-maker,\" ready to snap and fall without warning. The work had to continue, but the rules of engagement had changed completely.\n\nFor Peter, the first days after the snowfall were the hardest he had yet endured. The physical exertion of simply moving through the deep snow was exhausting, and the cold was a relentless, insidious enemy. It found its way through the layers of his woollen clothes, numbing his fingers and toes until they were clumsy, aching lumps. The sweat from his labour would freeze against his skin, creating a miserable, clammy chill that no amount of work could seem to burn away. He learned the hard way about the dangers of snow-blindness from the relentless glare off the white ground, and about the precariousness of his footing on hidden patches of ice. But he also learned the winter skills of the other men. He learned from Findlay how to wrap his boots in burlap for better grip, and from Cal he learned the art of looking up, of reading the stress on a branch and knowing which trees to give a wide berth. He learned to work in a new way, with a heightened awareness, his senses not dulled by the cold but sharpened by the constant, low-level threat of it. He was no longer just learning to work with wood; he was learning to work with winter.\n\nThe evenings became longer, darker, and more vital. The bunkhouse, once just a place to sleep, transformed into the heart of their small, isolated community. With the darkness falling by mid-afternoon, the men would gather around the pot-bellied stove, its heat a sacred circle in the freezing room. This was the time for stories. Men who were silent and stoic all day would open up in the warm, smoky gloom, their voices low as they spun tales of legendary storms, of close calls with death in the woods, of strange lights seen over the sea. Findlay, it turned in, had a fine, rumbling singing voice, and he would lead them in mournful ballads of lost love and shipwrecks, their voices a rough but moving chorus against the howl of the wind outside. In these moments, Peter felt the threads of community being woven tight around him. He was no longer the outsider, but a part of this collective, a keeper of the same fire. And later, in the absolute privacy of their shared bunk, burrowed deep under the heavy blankets, he would feel Ewan's cold feet seeking out the warmth of his own, and Ewan\u2019s arms would wrap around him, a solid, living shield against the cold. In the profound, shared darkness, they would talk in whispers, their breath clouding in the tiny space between their faces, reaffirming their own small, tenacious existence against the overwhelming power of the season.\n\nThe first real test came a week after the snow, on a day so cold the trees themselves seemed to groan in protest. They were working a steep, difficult slope, felling a stand of old, thick-girthed pines. The snow was particularly deep, concealing treacherous hollows and loose rocks. Peter was working beside Findlay, their axes rising and falling, their breathing a harsh, rhythmic rasp in the still air. A team further up the slope, including Ewan and Cal, was preparing to bring down a true giant, a tree that had stood for a century. The warning shouts went up\u2014\"Timber!\"\u2014and Peter and Findlay paused, moving back to what they thought was a safe distance, their eyes on the magnificent tree as it began its slow, majestic, terrifying fall. But something was wrong. Its descent was not clean. Weighed down by an immense, unbalanced load of snow on one side, it began to twist, its great trunk groaning in protest. It wasn't falling where it was supposed to. It was coming their way, a monstrous, unstoppable force, its massive branches sweeping a deadly arc through the smaller trees, sending a shower of splintered wood and ice through the air. Findlay, who had been standing a few feet from Peter, gave a shout of pure, primal alarm. He had been caught on the wrong side of a deep snowdrift, his path of retreat blocked. He was directly in the path of the falling giant.Time did not slow. It fractured. The world, which had been a steady rhythm of breath and axe-falls, shattered into a million sharp, chaotic fragments of sensory information. There was Findlay\u2019s face, his mouth open in a silent, terrified \u2018O\u2019, his eyes wide with the stark knowledge of his own imminent death. There was the sound, a horrifying, drawn-out scream of wood fibres tearing apart, a sound that went straight to the bone. There was the sight of the giant pine, impossibly vast, seeming to hang in the air for a terrible, eternal second before it began its inexorable, twisting descent. And there was the snow, the deep, treacherous snowdrift that held Findlay in place as surely as if he were manacled to the ground. Peter\u2019s mind was a blank, white void. The city boy, the boy who observed and feared and retreated, was gone, burned away in an instant of pure, animal instinct. His body moved, untethered from thought.\n\nHe launched himself forward, a desperate, lunging dive through the thigh-deep snow that felt like wading through thick, freezing treacle. Every step was a monumental effort, his lungs burning with the sudden, violent exertion. He heard shouts from the top of the slope, Ewan\u2019s voice, a raw, terrified cry of his own name, but it was a sound from another world, distant and meaningless. The only reality was the few feet of snow between him and Findlay, and the monstrous, roaring shadow that was swallowing the sky above them. He reached the old giant, his hands grabbing a fistful of Findlay\u2019s thick woollen jacket. There was no time for words, no time for anything but brute, desperate force. He planted his feet, digging for purchase he couldn\u2019t find, and shoved with every ounce of strength his remade body possessed. It was like trying to move a mountain. Findlay, frozen in terror, stumbled, his weight a dead, uncooperative anchor. \"Move!\" Peter screamed, the word a raw, guttural bark he didn\u2019t recognise as his own. He shoved again, a frantic, adrenaline-fuelled heave that sent them both staggering, falling sideways into the deep, soft powder of the snowdrift.\n\nThe world ended in a cataclysm of sound and fury. The roar of the falling tree was a physical force, a wave of displaced air that hit them like a solid object. The ground bucked and shuddered as the immense trunk impacted, a world-shattering *whump* that vibrated through Peter\u2019s teeth and bones. A storm of snow, splintered wood, and frozen earth erupted around them, a blinding, choking chaos. A branch, thick as a man\u2019s thigh, scythed through the air just inches above their heads with a sound like a tearing sheet, showering them with sharp splinters of bark and needles. Then, as suddenly as it had begun, there was a ringing, profound silence, broken only by the soft, settling sigh of displaced snow and the distant, panicked shouts of the other men. Peter lay half-buried in the snow, his face pressed into the cold, clean powder, his ears ringing, his mind a complete blank. He was alive. The thought was a small, flickering candle in the vast, dark emptiness of the shock.\n\nHe pushed himself up, his limbs trembling uncontrollably, a fine dusting of snow and pine needles clinging to his hair and clothes. The scene was one of utter devastation. The giant pine lay like a slain god, its massive trunk having carved a deep, raw wound in the earth, exactly where Findlay had been standing moments before. The air was thick with the powerful, funereal scent of crushed pine. A few feet away, Findlay was stirring, groaning, his face a mask of grey shock. He was trying to sit up, but one of his legs was trapped beneath a smaller, secondary branch that had snapped off in the fall, pinning him to the ground at an unnatural angle. Peter scrambled over to him, his hands patting him down, checking for injuries with a frantic urgency. \"Findlay? Are you alright? Talk to me!\" Findlay\u2019s eyes, clouded with pain, focused on Peter. \"My leg,\" he gasped, his voice thin and reedy. \"God, Peter\u2026 my leg.\" Just then, the rest of the crew arrived, crashing through the undergrowth, their faces pale with terror. Ewan was at the forefront, his eyes wild, scanning the wreckage until they locked on Peter, alive and moving. The relief that washed over his face was so profound it was almost a mask of pain. He stumbled the last few feet and grabbed Peter\u2019s arms, his grip bruising, his knuckles white. \"I thought\u2026\" he started, his voice a choked, broken thing. \"I saw you go for him. I thought you were both\u2026\" He couldn't finish, just pulled Peter into a fierce, desperate embrace that was less a hug and more an anchor, a frantic confirmation of life.\n\nThe moment was shattered by Cal\u2019s voice, sharp and commanding, cutting through the chaos. \"He's trapped. Ewan, get the big saw. The rest of you, clear this debris. Now!\" The men, shaken but professional, instantly fell into their roles. The shock was replaced by a grim, focused purpose. They worked with a swift, coordinated efficiency that was a testament to their long experience with the forest\u2019s dangers. Peter, released from Ewan\u2019s grip, found himself working alongside them, his own shock suppressed by the urgent need for action. He helped clear the smaller branches, his hands, clumsy and trembling a moment before, now finding a steady rhythm. They worked to free Findlay\u2019s leg, Cal directing the delicate operation with a calm authority, his face a grim, unreadable mask of responsibility. It took ten agonizing minutes to saw through the heavy branch and gently ease the old man free. His leg was a ruin, the bone clearly shattered below the knee, but he was alive. Cal fashioned a crude but effective splint from two straight branches and ripped strips of cloth from his own shirt, his movements quick and sure. The journey back to the camp was an arduous, silent procession. They made a makeshift stretcher from two poles and a stack of their own coats, and four of the strongest men, including Ewan, carried the injured man, their steps careful and slow through the deep snow. Peter walked alongside, carrying a handful of discarded axes, his mind still numb, the image of the falling tree replaying itself over and over behind his eyes. He had acted without thinking, a puppet pulled by some instinct he hadn\u2019t known he possessed. He had stared into the face of death, and he had not flinched. He did not feel like a hero. He felt hollowed out, scoured clean, a stranger to himself.\n\nThat evening, the bunkhouse was a place of subdued, quiet reverence. Findlay lay on his bunk, his face pale but his eyes clear, his leg immobilised. Annie had come from the cookhouse, bringing with her not just food, but laudanum for the pain and a quiet, maternal authority that soothed the raw edges of the men\u2019s nerves. A decision had been made: at first light, Cal and another man would take a sledge down to the nearest town to fetch the doctor. For now, all they could do was wait. The usual boisterous card games and storytelling were absent. The men sat quietly, smoking their pipes, the air thick with the unspoken acknowledgment of their shared mortality and their collective relief. As Peter sat on the edge of his own bunk, trying to coax feeling back into his numb hands, Cal came and stood before him. The big man looked down at him, his flinty eyes holding a new, unreadable light. \"That was a damn fool thing to do,\" he said, his voice a low rumble. He paused, then added, \"It was also the bravest damn thing I've ever seen.\" He clapped a heavy, calloused hand on Peter\u2019s shoulder, a gesture that was both a commendation and a benediction. \"You're one of us now, lad. For better or worse.\" He squeezed Peter's shoulder once, hard, and then walked away.\n\nLater, in the profound, shared darkness of their bunk, curled under the heavy blankets, Ewan\u2019s arm was not just a comfort, but a shield. He held Peter with a fierce, protective stillness, his body a solid line against Peter's back. For a long time, neither of them spoke. The events of the day lay between them, too large and raw for words. Finally, Ewan\u2019s voice came, a rough whisper in the dark. \"Don't you ever do that again.\" There was no anger in his voice, only the ragged, frayed edge of a terror he had been holding back all day. \"Don't you ever scare me like that again, Peter.\" Peter didn't reply. He simply reached back and took Ewan\u2019s hand, his newly calloused fingers lacing through Ewan's own. He held on tight, an anchor in the dark. He had faced the forest's fury and had not been found wanting. He had earned his place, not with the strength of his arms, but with the instinctive, unthinking loyalty of his heart. Winter had tested their small community, and they had held. He had been tested, and he had not broken. He was home.The morning after the accident was born into a world of muffled silence and stark, crystalline light. The ringing of the bell seemed a violation of the profound quiet that had settled over the snow-bound clearing. In the bunkhouse, the men moved with a subdued gravity, the usual grumbled complaints and rough-housing absent. All eyes were on Cal and a wiry, taciturn man named Torquil as they made their preparations. They strapped snowshoes to their heavy boots and loaded a small, sturdy sledge with blankets, a flask of hot tea, and a bottle of whisky, provisions for a journey that was both a rescue mission and a gamble against the elements. The entire camp stood in the piercing cold to watch them depart, a silent, collective sending-off. There were no grand farewells, only a single, sharp nod from Cal before he and Torquil leaned into their harnesses and began the long, arduous trek towards the coast road, their dark figures shrinking against the vast, indifferent white until the forest swallowed them whole.\n\nThe work that day was different. The forest, which had begun to feel like a challenging but familiar partner, was once again an antagonist. The memory of the falling tree haunted the spaces between the pines, and every creak of a snow-laden branch was a fresh jolt of alarm. The men worked with a grim, sober focus, their movements more deliberate, their gazes constantly scanning the canopy above. The workload was heavier, the absence of three men\u2014Findlay, Cal, and Torquil\u2014a palpable gap in their ranks. Ewan, now the de facto leader, moved through the work teams with a quiet, anxious energy, his eyes everywhere at once. He assigned Peter to a task in a relatively clear, flat area, away from the treacherous slopes. It was the necessary work of splitting logs for the cookhouse stove, a job that was physically demanding but carried none of the immediate dangers of felling. Peter understood the unspoken motive behind the assignment. It was an act of protection, a manifestation of the terror that still lived behind Ewan\u2019s eyes. A part of him, the new, capable part, bristled at being handled so carefully, but he said nothing, seeing the raw fear that Ewan was trying to master. He picked up the heavy splitting maul and set to work, the rhythmic, percussive thud of splitting wood a steadying counterpoint to the anxious thrumming in his own chest.\n\nThe subtle shift in his own status was undeniable. He was no longer the apprentice, the outsider to be tolerated. He was Peter, the man who had dived into the path of death to save one of their own. The change was not in grand pronouncements, but in the small, almost imperceptible gestures that formed the currency of respect among these quiet men. As he worked, a man named Angus, who had been one of the most openly dismissive of the \"city boy\" in the early days, walked over, silently took Peter\u2019s axe, and spent a minute expertly honing its edge on a whetstone he produced from his pocket, before handing it back with a gruff, almost inaudible grunt. Later, during the mid-day break, as Peter sat alone on a log, nursing his still-sore hands, another man silently placed a second, thicker sandwich beside him. No words were exchanged, but the message was clear. He had paid a price, and in doing so, had earned his membership. He belonged not just to Ewan, but to the whole, ragged, hard-bitten family of the camp. It was a strange and unsettling feeling, this sense of belonging that had been forged in a moment of sheer, unthinking terror.\n\nEwan found him during that break, his face etched with the strain of command and a deeper, more personal worry. He sat beside Peter on the log, the silence stretching between them for a long minute before he spoke. \"My first thought this morning,\" Ewan said, his gaze fixed on the distant, snow-shrouded hills, \"was to tell you to stay in the cookhouse with Annie. To keep you out of the woods entirely.\" He let out a short, harsh breath. \"I don't think I've ever been more afraid in my life than I was yesterday, watching you run towards that tree.\" He finally turned to look at Peter, his peat-smoke eyes dark with the memory. \"But I couldn't. It wouldn't be right. You're not a guest here. You're a woodsman.\" Peter met his gaze, seeing the conflict raging within him\u2014the fierce, protective instinct warring with his respect for the man Peter was becoming. \"I'm not made of glass, Ewan,\" Peter said, his voice quiet but firm. Ewan\u2019s mouth twisted into a wry, sad smile. \"I know,\" he said, his voice rough with emotion. \"I know you're not. That's what scares me.\"\n\nLate in the afternoon, a shout went up from the man posted as a lookout. Two figures were emerging from the forest edge, pulling the sledge behind them. A third figure, small and dark-clad, walked beside them. The doctor. A wave of collective relief rippled through the clearing as the men abandoned their work and converged on the camp. Cal and Torquil looked utterly spent, their faces grey with exhaustion and rimmed with ice from their own breath. The doctor, a small, neat man with a clipped moustache and a face that seemed perpetually pinched against the cold, looked absurdly out of place, his black leather bag a strange, alien object in this world of wood and steel. He stamped the snow from his immaculate boots and disappeared into the bunkhouse where Findlay lay, his expression a mask of professional neutrality that offered neither hope nor despair. The men waited outside in the biting cold, a silent, anxious vigil, their rough camaraderie a solid, unspoken wall around their fallen comrade.\n\nPeter and Ewan stood together, slightly apart from the main group, the steam from their own breath mingling in the frigid air. Peter felt the camp\u2019s collective anxiety as a physical weight in his own chest. This was no longer just Findlay\u2019s fate; it was a communal burden. The life they had here was hard, but it was honest and self-contained. The doctor, with his bag and his city knowledge, was a necessary intrusion, a reminder of a world beyond the pines where bodies were more easily mended but lives were, perhaps, more easily broken. After what felt like an eternity, the bunkhouse door opened, and Cal emerged, his face grim, followed by the doctor, who was wiping his hands on a small, clean handkerchief. The men pressed forward, a silent, questioning mob. The doctor addressed them all, his voice crisp and clear, cutting through the cold air. \"It's a bad break. A spiral fracture of both the tibia and the fibula.\" The medical terms meant little to them, but the gravity of his tone was unmistakable. \"I've set it as best I can and given him a strong dose of laudanum. But he can't stay here. As soon as a path is cleared, he needs to be taken to the infirmary in Aberdeen. He won't be climbing any hills for a very long time. If ever.\"\n\nThe finality of the verdict settled over the clearing like a fresh fall of snow, cold and heavy. Findlay, a man whose entire identity was tied to his physical strength and his mastery of the forest, had been severed from his purpose in a single, brutal moment. The thought was a chilling one, a reminder of the precariousness of their existence, of how quickly everything could be taken away. That night, the bunkhouse was hushed. Findlay was in a deep, drug-induced sleep, his leg a rigid, splinted shape beneath the blankets. The community had absorbed the blow and had a plan. They would care for him, they would get him to the city, they would see that he was provided for. The covenant held. In the deep, sheltering dark of their own bunk, Peter lay awake, listening to the wind howl around the corners of the cabin. The raw, physical ache of his own body was a comforting, grounding presence, a testament to his own wholeness. He thought of Findlay, of the life that had been so irrevocably altered. He turned, pressing his face into the warmth of Ewan\u2019s shoulder. \"What will happen to him?\" he whispered into the darkness. Ewan\u2019s arm tightened around him, a solid, reassuring weight. \"We'll look after him,\" he murmured, his voice thick with sleep. \"He's one of us.\" The words, the same ones Cal had spoken to Peter, were not just a statement, but a creed. It was the fundamental law of this place: you did not abandon your own. In the heart of the unforgiving winter, in a world stripped down to its barest essentials, Peter understood that he had stumbled into a family, bound not by blood, but by the shared, unspoken promise to catch one another when they fell.The doctor left at dawn, a small, dark figure receding into the vast white landscape, a brief, sterile intrusion of the outside world that was now over. He left behind him a diagnosis and a death sentence for a way of life. The silence in the cookhouse that morning was as thick and heavy as the porridge in the bowls. The men ate without speaking, the scrape of spoons the only sound. Findlay, sedated and still in the bunkhouse, was a ghost at their table, his absence a gaping hole in their small fellowship. Cal, having returned with the doctor and snatched only a few hours of sleep, sat at the head of the table, his face a mask of grim authority. He drank his tea in slow, deliberate gulps, his flinty eyes scanning the faces of his crew, taking their measure in the wake of the crisis. The time for shock was over. Now was the time for logistics.\n\n\"We move him tomorrow, at first light,\" Cal announced into the silence, his voice flat and final, leaving no room for argument. \"The snow has hardened. A sledge can make it to the coast road if we follow the riverbed. From there, we pray for a lorry.\" He outlined the plan with brutal simplicity. It would be a two-day journey, at best. A team of four to manage the sledge, which they would have to build that day. They would need to break trail through untouched snow, navigate treacherous ice on the frozen river, and camp one night in the open. It was a journey fraught with peril, undertaken for one of their own. \"I'll lead,\" he continued, \"and I'll take Torquil, he knows the river better than any man. I need two more. Strong backs, steady heads.\" The men at the table stirred, a low murmur of assent. Hands were ready to be raised. This was a duty, not a choice. Cal\u2019s eyes moved down the table, assessing, calculating. He looked past men who had been with him for a decade, his gaze finally settling on Peter. \"Angus,\" he said, nodding to the powerfully built woodsman who had sharpened Peter\u2019s axe. Then, \"And Peter.\"\n\nA stunned silence fell over the table. Every eye turned to Peter. He felt the weight of their collective gaze, a mixture of surprise, doubt, and a new, grudging respect. He was the newest, the least experienced, the one who just yesterday was still considered an apprentice at best. To be chosen for such a crucial, dangerous task was an honour so profound it was terrifying. He saw Ewan, across the table, stiffen as if struck. \"Cal, no,\" Ewan said, his voice a low, tight command. It was the first time Peter had ever heard him challenge his brother so directly in front of the others. \"The lad\u2019s not seasoned for this. It's two days in the open, in this cold. He'll break.\" The protective fury in Ewan\u2019s voice was palpable, a raw, exposed nerve. But Cal\u2019s expression did not soften. He met his brother\u2019s gaze, his own eyes as hard and unyielding as granite. \"He was seasoned enough yesterday,\" Cal said, his voice dropping, but carrying an edge that cut through the room. \"He's light, which is good for the deep drifts. He's quick. And when the sky was falling, he didn't run. He ran towards it. I need a man who doesn't break. He goes.\"\n\nThe finality in his brother's voice left no room for appeal. Ewan stared at Cal for a long, tense moment, a silent battle of wills fought across the scarred wooden table, before he finally dropped his gaze, his jaw tight with a barely suppressed anger. The decision was made. Peter felt a strange, dizzying mixture of pride and pure, cold dread. He was being trusted with a life, with the honour of the camp. He had to be equal to it. The rest of the day was a blur of focused, purposeful activity. Under Cal\u2019s direction, they constructed the sledge, a low, sturdy platform of seasoned pine fitted with smooth wooden runners. Peter worked alongside Angus and Torquil, his own clumsiness a stark contrast to their ingrained, effortless skill. But they did not mock him. They corrected him, their instructions gruff and minimal, accepting his presence as a fact decreed by their leader. He was part of the team. He watched them pack the supplies: dried meat, hard biscuits, ropes, extra blankets, a small medical kit prepared by Annie, and the precious bottle of whisky for emergencies. Every item was chosen with a stoic pragmatism that acknowledged the thin line between survival and disaster.\n\nThe departure was a quiet, solemn ritual in the blue, pre-dawn light. The whole camp turned out, their breath misting in the frigid air. Findlay, heavily sedated and wrapped in a cocoon of blankets and furs, was carefully lashed to the sledge. He was a still, silent passenger, his face pale and waxy in the dim light. Peter took his place at one of the four guide ropes, the rough hemp cold and stiff in his hands. He felt a touch on his arm and turned to see Ewan. He had come not to say goodbye, but to make a final inspection. He ran a critical eye over Peter\u2019s gear, tugging the scarf tighter around his neck, checking the straps on his snowshoes. His movements were brusque, almost angry, but his hands lingered for a fraction of a second too long on Peter's shoulder. \"Stay behind Cal,\" Ewan said, his voice a low, urgent murmur for Peter\u2019s ears alone. \"Watch his feet. Put your boots exactly where he puts his. Don't think, just follow.\" He pressed a small, flat metal flask into Peter\u2019s hand, its contents sloshing softly. \"For the cold,\" he said. It was an order, not a gift. He met Peter\u2019s eyes, and in their peat-smoke depths, Peter saw a universe of unspoken fear. \"Come back,\" Ewan whispered, the words so soft they were almost lost in the cold air.\n\nPeter could only nod, his throat too tight for words. He gripped the flask, its cold metal a tangible link to the man he was leaving behind. Cal gave a single, sharp command, and the four men leaned into their ropes, taking the strain. The sledge runners groaned in protest against the snow, and then, slowly, ponderously, they began to move. Peter fell into step behind Cal, his eyes fixed on the back of the older man's boots, the rhythmic crunch of their snowshoes the only sound. He did not look back. He knew that if he did, he would see Ewan standing there, a solitary figure watching them go, growing smaller and smaller until the vast, silent, white forest reclaimed him. The garden, for the first time since he'd arrived, was now behind him, and ahead lay only the stark, unforgiving wilderness and a long road back to a world he had tried so hard to escape.",

From his third-floor window, Peter watched the water turn the back court into a slick, grey mirror reflecting a sky the colour of a day-old bruise. The world was a tenement square, bounded by soot-stained sandstone and the private lives stacked one on top of the other, all breathing the same coal-thick air. And across that square, directly opposite, was Ewan\u2019s window. A mirror to his own.\n\nMost days, it was just a dark rectangle. But sometimes, especially in the gloaming when the lights began to flicker on, he\u2019d see a silhouette. A shape moving, broad-shouldered and quick. Ewan. The name was a secret currency Peter traded only with himself, a smooth, worn coin in the pocket of his mind. He\u2019d been there six months, renting the room from old Mrs Gable, and in that time, he\u2019d rewired the whole of Peter\u2019s small world. It wasn\u2019t a thing Ewan had done, not actively. It was in the way he\u2019d take the stairs two at a time, the sound of his boots on the stone a kind of brutalist music. It was in the rare, lopsided smile he\u2019d throw over his shoulder if he caught Peter watching from the landing. It was in the smell of woodsmoke and something sharp, like pine, that clung to his jacket, a scent of forests and open spaces that had no place here in the Gallowgate.\n\nPeter worked at the shipyards, a place of noise and fire, of men shouting over the shriek of metal being rent and tortured into shape. He came home each night with a ringing in his ears and a fine dust of steel in his hair, in his throat. He\u2019d wash at the sink in the kitchen, the cold water failing to scrub the feeling of it all away. Then he would sit with a book, borrowed and dog-eared, and try to find a silence the yard hadn\u2019t stolen. But the real quiet, the only quiet that mattered, came from watching the window opposite. It was a meditation. A prayer to a god he wasn't sure he believed in, for a thing he was sure he was not allowed to want.\n\nOne Tuesday, the sky weeping a miserable, persistent drizzle, the meeting happened. Not at the window, but in the close, the cavernous, echoing stairwell that smelled of damp and boiled cabbage. Peter was heading out for messages, his coat collar turned up against the chill, when the main door swung open and Ewan stumbled in, laughing. He wasn't alone. A girl, her hair the colour of cheap butter, was clinging to his arm, her own laughter a high, sharp sound that scraped against the stone walls. Peter froze on the landing, halfway down.\n\nEwan saw him. His laughter didn't stop, but it changed. It became something performed. \"Alright, Peter?\" he called up, his voice booming in the enclosed space. The girl giggled and hid her face in Ewan's shoulder.\n\n\"Aye,\" Peter managed, his own voice a dry whisper. He felt like an intruder, a ghost at their feast. He forced his feet to move, to carry him down the last few steps, past them. The scent of Ewan was stronger here, mixed with the girl's cloying perfume. It made his stomach clench. He didn't look at them as he passed, just stared at the tiled floor, at the intricate, grimy pattern of fleurs-de-lis worn smooth by a century of feet. He pushed the heavy door and escaped into the rain, the cold a welcome shock against his hot face. He didn't know why it felt like a betrayal. Ewan was a stranger. Less than a stranger. He was a shape in a window. A sound on the stairs. But the feeling was there all the same, a cold stone in his gut.\n\nHe walked without purpose, past the pub where the men were already escaping the day, past the butcher\u2019s with its grim, pale carcasses, past the baker\u2019s whose warmth couldn\u2019t reach him. He thought he could walk it off, this feeling. But it clung to him, as persistent as the Glasgow damp. When he finally returned, the close was empty. The ghost of perfume and laughter was gone. There was only the familiar scent of boiled vegetables and, fainter now, the lingering hint of pine. He climbed the stairs slowly, his boots heavy. As he reached his own door, he saw it. Leaning against the jamb, a single, hand-rolled cigarette. It was Ewan's. He always had one tucked behind his ear. Peter looked around. The landings above and below were empty. The silence was absolute. He picked it up. It was still a little damp from the air, but the tobacco was dry. A peace offering? An apology? Or just a dropped cigarette? He didn\u2019t know. But he slipped it into his pocket, and it felt like a key.\n\nLater, when the city was dark and the only sounds were a distant siren and the lonely clatter of a late-night tram, he stood at his window. He smoked the cigarette, letting the unfamiliar taste of the cheap, strong tobacco coat his tongue. He didn't cough. He smoked it like he'd been doing it his whole life. And as he watched the smoke curl and vanish into the blackness, a light flickered on in the window opposite. Ewan\u2019s silhouette appeared. He stood there for a moment, looking out. Looking, Peter was certain, right at him. Peter\u2019s heart hammered against his ribs, a frantic bird in a cage. He didn't move, didn't breathe. He just stood there, a boy in a window, with a stolen cigarette and a secret hope that was as dangerous and beautiful as a shard of broken glass. And across the chasm of the back court, Ewan raised a hand in a slow, deliberate wave.\n\nThe wave changed everything. It was a thread thrown across the void, and Peter grasped it with all the strength of his lonely soul. The next day, he didn't just listen for Ewan\u2019s boots on the stairs; he waited for them. He timed his own departure for the yard to coincide, manufacturing an accident. It was clumsy. He almost fell over him on the first-floor landing.\n\n\"Whoa there, lad. In a hurry to get to the fire and brimstone?\" Ewan's voice was amused, a low rumble that vibrated through the floor. He steadied Peter with a hand on his arm. His grip was firm, warm through the thin fabric of Peter\u2019s shirt. The contact was a jolt, a brand.\n\n\"Sorry. Daydreaming,\" Peter mumbled, his face burning. He could smell the pine scent again, clean and sharp.\n\n\"Aye, you do a lot of that,\" Ewan said, but there was no mockery in it. His eyes, the colour of peat smoke, held Peter\u2019s for a second too long. \"Walk with me a bit.\" It wasn't a question. They walked out of the tenement and into the pale morning light, falling into step beside each other. The street was already teeming with men heading for the yards and the factories, a river of grey caps and weary shoulders. But for Peter, it was a bubble of silence with Ewan at its centre.\n\n\"Saw you last night,\" Ewan said, not looking at him, his gaze fixed ahead. \"At your window.\"\n\n\"I was just\u2026\"\n\n\"It\u2019s alright.\" Ewan gave that lopsided smile, a flash of white in his tanned face. \"Good to know someone\u2019s keeping watch.\" He said it like a joke, but his tone was serious. They didn't talk much more, just walked. But it was a conversation all the same. The rhythm of their steps, the way Ewan angled himself slightly, as if to shield Peter from the jostling crowd, the shared glances at a headline on a news-seller's board about troops and borders. When they reached the corner where their paths diverged, Ewan to the delivery depot and Peter to the inferno of the shipyards, Ewan stopped.\n\n\"Tonight,\" he said, his voice low, for Peter\u2019s ears only. \"The roof. After it\u2019s dark.\"\n\nPeter just nodded, his throat too tight for words. The rest of the day was a dream. The roar of the yard was a distant hum, the molten rivets arcing through the air were slow, lazy fireflies. He moved like an automaton, his body performing the tasks his mind had long since abandoned. His mind was on the roof. The roof was a place of myth, accessed by a rusty ladder in the top-floor washhouse. It was a windswept desert of slate and lead, dotted with chimney pots that exhaled the building\u2019s smoky breath. It was a place to be alone, above everything. To be there with Ewan felt like a transgression of a different order entirely.\n\nWhen night fell, he waited until the sounds of the tenement settled, until the shouts and the wireless radios faded into a low murmur. He crept up the stairs, his heart a frantic drum against his ribs. The ladder was cold and slick with damp. He climbed, emerging into the vast, cold darkness of the Glasgow night. The city was spread out below, a carpet of scattered, smudgy lights under a starless, cloud-heavy sky. And Ewan was there, a dark shape against the lesser dark, sitting on the coping stones, his legs dangling over the edge.\n\n\"Thought you might not come,\" Ewan said, his voice quiet, almost carried away by the wind that swept across the slates.\n\n\"You said to,\" Peter replied, the words simple, but they held the weight of a vow. He walked over and sat beside Ewan, careful not to look down at the sheer drop to the back court.\n\n\"Look at it,\" Ewan gestured out at the city. \"Like a spilled jar of embers. All that life down there. All those people in their little boxes. And they haven't a clue we're up here.\" He turned to look at Peter, and in the faint, reflected glow from the city, his eyes were deep and serious. \"Do you ever want to just\u2026 fly away from it, Peter?\"\n\n\"There's nowhere to fly to,\" Peter said, his voice barely a whisper.\n\n\"There's always somewhere.\" Ewan\u2019s gaze was intense. He reached out, not quickly, but with a slow deliberation that gave Peter a universe of time to pull away. He didn't. Ewan's fingers brushed a stray lock of hair from Peter\u2019s forehead. The touch was feather-light, yet it anchored him to the spot. \"I don\u2019t want to fly away from all of it,\" Ewan said, his voice dropping even lower, a rough, intimate sound. \"Not all of it.\" And then he leaned in, and the world dissolved into the press of his lips against Peter's. It was not like the kiss he had imagined. It was better. It was softer, more questioning. It tasted of tobacco and the cold night air, and it was the first true thing that had ever happened to him. When they broke apart, the city lights below seemed to blur and swim, and Peter knew, with a terrifying certainty, that he was lost. Or found. He wasn't sure which. He only knew he was Ewan's."

                                        "text": "The silence that followed was more profound than any quiet Peter had ever known. It was not an absence of sound\u2014the city still hummed its ceaseless, mechanical lullaby, the wind still whispered over the slates\u2014but an absence of noise in his own head. The ringing from the shipyard was gone. The anxious static of his own thoughts was gone. There was only the solid warmth of Ewan beside him, the lingering taste of him, and the dizzying panorama of the lights below that no longer looked like a spilled jar of embers, but like a promise. He felt Ewan\u2019s thumb trace a slow line along his jaw, a simple, grounding gesture that said more than words ever could. It said, *I am here. This is real.*\n\n\"See?\" Ewan\u2019s voice was a low murmur, close to his ear. \"Not so hard to fly, is it?\" He pulled back a little, though his hand remained, cupping Peter's cheek. His peat-smoke eyes searched Peter\u2019s face in the gloom, looking for something\u2014reassurance, maybe, or a reflection of his own recklessness. \"I\u2019ve been watching you, too, Peter. From my window. Wondering what you were reading. Wondering what you were thinking, looking out at all this.\" He let out a short, soft laugh, a sound utterly different from the booming performance in the close. \"Figured I was going mad. Seeing a story in a window that wasn't there.\"\n\n\"The story was there,\" Peter heard himself say, his voice steadier than he expected. It felt momentous to admit it, to give voice to the silent longing that had structured his days. He dared to look away from Ewan\u2019s eyes and back towards their two windows, twin black squares in the sandstone cliffs of the tenement. They were no longer a mirror and a mystery, but two ends of a secret, a shared geography that only they understood. \"I saw you with the girl,\" he added, the words slipping out before he could stop them, tasting of ash. It wasn't an accusation, just a statement of fact, a piece of the puzzle that didn't fit.\n\nEwan didn\u2019t flinch. He let his hand drop from Peter\u2019s face and picked up a loose piece of slate, turning it over and over in his fingers. \"Mary? She\u2019s\u2026 a friend. Sometimes it\u2019s easier to be seen with a friend like that. Keeps the questions away.\" He glanced at Peter, his expression unreadable. \"This world, our world,\" he gestured vaguely at the tenement, at the city, \"it only lets you live in certain ways. You know that. Sometimes you have to build a wall so you can have a garden behind it.\" He tossed the piece of slate, and they watched it skitter down the roof and disappear into the darkness. \"This,\" he said, turning back to Peter, his meaning clear in the space between them, \"is the garden.\"\n\nThey stayed up there for what felt like hours, though it may have been only one. The cold began to seep into their bones, a damp, insistent chill that the warmth between them couldn't entirely banish. Ewan talked. He spoke of a life before Glasgow, of forestry work in the Highlands, of vast, silent hills and the smell of sawdust, of a sky so full of stars it could break your heart. He spoke of leaving, not because he wanted to, but because a small town has more eyes than a city, and less room to hide. Peter, in turn, spoke of his books, of the worlds he escaped into, of the quiet hunger for something more than the grime and the noise. They were just words, but they were building a bridge, plank by plank, across the chasm of the back court, a bridge that felt more real than the stone and steel of the city around them.\n\nThe descent was a reversal of the magic. Back down the slick ladder, into the familiar, stale air of the washhouse, the spell of the rooftop began to fray. Every creak of the floorboards, every distant cough from another flat, was a reminder of the world they had to return to. At the landing between their floors, they paused in the thick darkness. There were no words left. Ewan reached out and squeezed Peter\u2019s shoulder, a quick, firm pressure that was both a promise and a warning. Then he was gone, his boots making a soft, retreating sound on the stone steps leading up to his floor. Peter stood alone in the dark, his shoulder tingling where Ewan had touched him, the silence of the close pressing in on him once more.\n\nBack in his room, he didn't turn on the light. He went straight to the window, his old habit, his old ritual. But everything was changed. The back court was no longer a chasm of loneliness. Ewan\u2019s window was no longer a dark rectangle of unknowing. It was an anchor. As he watched, a match flared in the darkness opposite, briefly illuminating Ewan\u2019s face as he lit a cigarette. He didn't wave this time. He didn't have to. He just stood there, a point of light in the gloom, and Peter stood with him, two sentinels guarding a fragile, new-born secret. The city was still grimy, the air still thick, but for the first time since he\u2019d arrived, Peter felt like he was breathing. He was no longer just a boy in a window; he was one half of a story, and he knew, with a certainty that was both thrilling and terrifying, that the first chapter had just come to a close."

                                        "text": "The following morning, the grey light that filtered through his window felt less like an accusation and more like a soft blanket. The tenement square was still a slick mirror of damp stone, but Peter saw it differently now. He saw it not as a chasm, but as the space that defined the distance between two specific points: his window and Ewan\u2019s. The memory of the rooftop was a low, steady hum beneath the surface of his thoughts. He could still feel the phantom press of Ewan\u2019s lips, the rough texture of his jacket, the astonishing, terrifying safety of his hand on his cheek. When he washed his face, the cold water didn\u2019t feel like a punishment; it was a shock that made the memories sharper, more real. The day ahead, with its noise and its fire, didn\u2019t loom with the same dread. It was simply the price of admission for the night to come.\n\nHe didn't have to manufacture an encounter this time. As he pulled on his boots, he heard the familiar, heavy tread on the stairs above. It was a signal. He opened his door and stepped onto the landing just as Ewan was descending. Their eyes met, and the charged silence from the rooftop was there between them again, an invisible, crackling field. Ewan\u2019s lopsided smile was there, too, but it was different now. It was for Peter alone, a private acknowledgment of all that had passed between them in the dark. He didn\u2019t stop, but as he passed, his knuckles brushed against Peter\u2019s, a deliberate, fleeting contact that sent a bolt of heat straight up his arm. \"Morning, lad,\" he said, his voice the same low rumble, but the words were a caress. Peter just nodded, unable to speak, and watched him take the stairs two at a time, the brutalist music now a symphony. He followed a few moments later, walking through the ghost of Ewan\u2019s pine scent as if it were a benediction.\n\nAt the shipyard, the cacophony was the same, the air just as thick with the metallic tang of tortured steel. But Peter felt insulated from it, encased in a bubble of memory and anticipation. He worked with a fierce, focused energy he hadn't possessed before, his movements sure and rhythmic. The other men, with their rough jokes and their casual complaints about wives and the price of beer, seemed to be speaking a foreign language. He was one of them, wearing the same grime-stiffened overalls, his hands calloused from the same labour, but he was no longer of them. He had a secret garden, and the shrieking, fiery hell of the yard was the wall that surrounded it. He found himself smiling once, a small, involuntary quirk of his lips, as he guided a white-hot rivet into place, and caught one of the older men, Davie, watching him with a curious expression. Peter quickly looked away, his heart thumping. The garden was a beautiful thing, but its walls were thin.\n\nThey fell into a silent routine, a language without words. A book left on the top step of Peter\u2019s flight meant the roof, if the weather held. A single chalk mark on the brick by the main door, low down where only someone looking for it would see, meant to wait by the window after dark. Sometimes, Ewan would leave him things. A perfectly ripe apple on his windowsill, discovered in the morning. A small, intricately carved wooden bird, left tucked into the hinge of his door, smelling faintly of the forest. These were not peace offerings or apologies; they were sentences in a conversation, tangible proof that Peter was not imagining it, that the man with peat-smoke eyes was thinking of him even when they were apart. Peter, in return, would leave a passage marked in a book, a poem about stars or the sea, a story of a distant, kinder land. He\u2019d leave it where he knew Ewan would find it, a quiet offering from his world to Ewan\u2019s.\n\nOne evening, as Peter was climbing the stairs, he ran into Mrs Gable coming down from the top-floor washhouse, a wicker basket of damp laundry propped on her hip. She was a woman made of faded floral prints and the smell of carbolic soap, her eyes small and sharp behind her spectacles. \"Ah, Peter,\" she said, her voice a reedy counterpoint to the close's usual echoes. \"You're looking\u2026 brighter, these days. Got a spring in your step.\" She smiled, a small, knowing crinkle around her eyes. \"It's that friend you've made, I expect. The big lad from upstairs, Mr Scott. It\u2019s good to have a pal in a place like this.\" Peter\u2019s blood ran cold. He felt the heat rise in his face, a traitorous blush. \"He's a nice boy,\" she continued, oblivious. \"Always has a kind word. Though I do wish he'd wipe his boots. He tracks the whole of the Highlands in with him.\" She chuckled and continued her slow descent. Peter stood frozen, his hand gripping the bannister. *A pal. A friend.* The words were so simple, so normal. So utterly wrong. It was a reminder of the wall, of the performance. And a warning that even the most innocent eyes were watching."

                                        "text": "The chill from the iron bannister seeped into his palm, a cold that spread up his arm and settled in his chest, far deeper than the Glasgow damp. *A pal*. The word was a perfectly cut key for a lock that didn't exist, a convenient label for something wild and unnameable. Mrs Gable, in her floral, soap-scented innocence, had held up a mirror, and in it Peter saw not himself and Ewan, but how the world saw them. Two lads, two friends. A safe, understandable equation. He understood, with a sickening lurch, that Ewan\u2019s performance with Mary in the close hadn't just been for him; it was for the entire building. It was part of the wall around the garden, and Peter had been too lost in the beauty of the flowers to even notice the bricks. Back in his room, the window felt different. It was no longer a private vantage point, but a stage. He felt a hundred pairs of eyes on his back, the collective, unseen gaze of the tenement.\n\nThe chalk mark appeared two days later. A faint white dash on the grimy brick, a whisper in their silent language. It meant the roof. A week ago, his heart would have soared. Now, it beat a frantic, trapped rhythm against his ribs, a frantic bird that had suddenly realised the dimensions of its cage. Every step he took up the final flights of stairs that evening felt reckless. He imagined doors opening, heads peering out, a voice calling, \"Where are you off to, lad, at this hour?\" The air in the close, thick with the ghosts of a hundred dinners and a thousand conversations, seemed to press in on him, heavy with judgment. When he pushed open the heavy door to the washhouse, the familiar smell of damp linen and cold stone did nothing to calm him. He was a trespasser, and the magic of the ascent had been replaced by the grim anxiety of being caught.\n\nEwan was already there, a silhouette against a sky that had been washed clean by an earlier rain, leaving behind a deep, bruised purple pricked with a few, determined stars. He was smoking, the red tip of his cigarette a tiny, defiant ember in the gloom. He didn't speak as Peter approached, just watched him, his gaze steady. Peter sat beside him on the coping stones, the drop to the back court below seeming more perilous than ever before. He couldn't shake the feeling that they were utterly exposed, two figures picked out against the skyline for all of Glasgow to see.\n\"You're jumpy tonight,\" Ewan said, his voice a low rumble that barely disturbed the quiet. He flicked the butt of his cigarette into the darkness, a falling star that extinguished itself. \"Like a hare that's heard the dogs.\"\n\n\"Mrs Gable spoke to me,\" Peter said, the words coming out in a rush. \"She called you my friend. My pal.\" He hated how small his voice sounded, how fraught with panic. Ewan was quiet for a long moment, his gaze on the sprawling lights of the city. When he finally turned to Peter, his expression wasn't mocking, or dismissive. It was weary, and older than Peter had ever seen it. \"Aye,\" he said softly. \"And that's what we'll be, to her. To all of them. It's the only story they'll buy, so it's the only one we can sell.\" He reached out and tucked a piece of Peter's hair behind his ear, a gesture so gentle it almost broke him. \"Doesn't change the story we tell each other, up here.\"\n\nSuddenly, from below, came the sharp, metallic clang of the washhouse door slamming shut, followed by the sound of a woman's voice, raised in complaint, the words indistinct but the tone sharp as vinegar. They both froze. In an instant, Ewan\u2019s hand was on Peter\u2019s arm, pulling him back from the edge, down into the deeper shadows of a chimney stack. They crouched there, side by side in the dark, barely breathing. The sounds from below faded, replaced once more by the wind and the distant city hum. The danger had passed. But in the close, shared darkness, Peter could feel the hammering of Ewan's heart, or perhaps it was his own; he couldn't tell where one began and the other ended. The thrill was gone, replaced by the cold, hard reality of fear.\n\nWhen the silence had stretched out long enough to feel safe again, Ewan let out a slow breath. He didn't move away. Instead, he turned in the narrow space, his knee brushing Peter's, his face so close Peter could see the faint starlight reflected in his eyes. The fear had stripped away the performance, the easy confidence, leaving something more raw and essential. \"This is the price, Peter,\" he whispered, his voice rough with an emotion Peter couldn't name. \"This is it. Hiding in the shadows. Always listening for footsteps on the stairs.\" He leaned in, and this time there was no questioning softness in the kiss. It was desperate and deep, a frantic affirmation in the face of all the things that would deny them. It tasted of fear and cheap tobacco and a fierce, defiant tenderness. It wasn't about flying; it was about holding on, a grim anchor in a storm.\n\nThe journey down was silent, a retreat from a battlefield. They parted on the landing with a shared look that was heavier than any embrace, an acknowledgment of the new weight they both carried. Back in his room, Peter stood at the window, but he wasn't looking at Ewan's dark square opposite. He was looking at all the other windows, the dozens of dim, curtained squares stacked one on top of the other. They were no longer just the backdrop to his private world; they were watchtowers. He saw Mrs Gable\u2019s window, and the flat of the man who shouted at his wireless, and the home of the young couple whose baby cried through the night. He saw a city full of walls and rules, and he and Ewan were on the wrong side of all of them. The hope that had bloomed so brightly on the rooftop now had thorns, and he knew, with a certainty that was as cold and hard as the shipyard steel, that their secret garden was a beautiful, impossible, and desperately dangerous place to live."

                                        "text": "The fear, he discovered, did not recede with the morning light. It was a new colour added to his world, a sickly yellow-grey that stained the dawn and tainted the familiar taste of his tea. Peter woke with the echo of the washhouse door in his bones, his sleep having been a shallow, restless affair punctuated by dreams of falling. When he looked out his window, he no longer saw just the slick, rain-washed stone of the back court. He saw sightlines. He saw angles of observation. He noted the way Mrs Gable\u2019s net curtains never hung quite straight, leaving a gap just wide enough for an eye, and how the window of the flat below Ewan\u2019s, a family with three noisy children, was almost always propped open an inch, like a listening ear. The tenement was no longer a stack of private lives; it was a panopticon of grimy sandstone, and he felt pinned by its unseen, collective gaze.\n\nTheir silent language faltered. There were no more chalk marks by the door, no more carved birds or surprise apples on his sill. The steps on the landing where he might have left a book with a marked page felt too exposed, the act itself imbued with a new and terrible significance. The meetings on the stairs ceased to be manufactured accidents and became instead exercises in avoidance. If he heard Ewan's boots, he would wait behind his door, his hand on the knob, until the sound had faded completely. He told himself it was caution, the lesson learned in the cold shadows of the chimney stack. But a darker, colder thought whispered that perhaps the garden had been abandoned, its single, fragile bloom left to wither on the vine. The silence from Ewan\u2019s side of the court was absolute, and Peter\u2019s loneliness, which had been briefly banished, returned with a vengeance, sharper and more painful for its absence.\n\nThe change in him did not go unnoticed at the yard. Where before he had been quiet but competent, he was now jumpy and distracted, his hands fumbling, his mind miles away. The roar of the furnaces, the shriek of the metal, no longer formed a dull, insulating wall but a cacophony that frayed his already raw nerves. The casual, crude banter of the other men, once just background noise, now felt like a constant interrogation. Every joke about a lass, every boast of a weekend conquest, seemed directed at him, a test he was failing. One afternoon, during a lull, Davie, the old riveter with eyes that had seen too many winters, sidled up to him. \"Everything alright with you, son?\" he asked, his voice surprisingly gentle amid the din. \"You're a million miles away. Got troubles at home?\" Peter flinched as if struck. The simple, kindly meant question felt like a spotlight. \"No. Just tired,\" he mumbled, turning his attention fiercely to a coil of rope, his face burning. The lie felt flimsy, pathetic. He could feel Davie's gaze on him for a long moment before the old man sighed and moved away. Peter knew then that the walls of the garden were not just outside; they had to be built inside himself, and his were proving to be made of glass.\n\nAfter nearly a week of this suffocating silence, a week in which Peter felt himself shrinking, turning back into the ghost he was before Ewan, he broke. He could not bear the not-knowing. The fear of being caught was terrible, but the fear of being abandoned was worse. That evening, he listened for the tell-tale sound of Ewan\u2019s return, his heart a frantic drum. He heard the main door groan open and slam shut, followed by the heavy, familiar tread on the stone. He didn\u2019t hesitate. He pulled open his own door and stepped out onto the landing, blocking the way. Ewan was halfway up the flight of stairs, his head down, and he almost walked into Peter before he stopped, looking up in surprise. His face was shadowed in the gloom, his expression unreadable. For a terrible second, Peter thought he saw a stranger.\n\n\"You've been avoiding me,\" Peter said. The words came out sounding more like an accusation than he intended, his voice tight and low. Ewan didn't answer immediately. He looked past Peter, up the stairs and then down, his eyes scanning the shadowed landings, a soldier checking for snipers. Only when he seemed satisfied that they were alone did he meet Peter\u2019s gaze. The weariness Peter had seen on the roof was there again, etched into the lines around his eyes. \"I've been careful,\" he corrected, his voice a near whisper. \"There's a difference.\" He took the last few steps until he was standing on the same landing, so close Peter could smell the damp wool of his jacket and the cold night air clinging to him. The scent of pine was faint, almost lost. \"You think I want this quiet? This hiding?\" Ewan\u2019s voice was rough, laced with a frustration that mirrored Peter's own. \"I saw Davie talking to you at the yard gate yesterday. I saw Mrs Gable watch you all the way down the street this morning from her window. They're not looking for anything, Peter. Not yet. But they're looking. And that's how it starts.\" He reached out, not to touch, but his hand hovered in the space between them, a gesture of aborted comfort. \"This isn't a story in one of your books, lad. The world doesn't just let you be. You have to be cleverer than it is. You have to be quieter. It means\u2026 going without. So we don't lose everything.\" He finally let his hand drop. The space between them felt vast and cold, a chasm of brutal reality. Peter understood then. This wasn't a retreat; it was a strategy. It wasn't the end of their story, but the grim, unwritten rules of its telling."

                                        "text": "Ewan's words were a cold, hard key turning in a lock Peter hadn't known was rusted shut. He went back into his room and closed the door, the soft click of the latch sounding like a cell door sliding home. *It means going without.* The phrase echoed in the sudden, profound quiet of his small room. It wasn't the romantic, pining silence of before, filled with daydreams and unspoken hopes. This was a tactical silence, a necessary barrenness. The garden wasn't abandoned; it had been plunged into a perpetual winter to protect its roots. Peter went to the window, his familiar post, but he felt no comfort there. He understood now that his vigil had been naive, a blissful ignorance. He had been admiring the view from the battlefield, mistaking the glint of enemy spyglasses for friendly stars. He looked at Ewan\u2019s window, a dark, inscrutable rectangle, and for the first time, he felt the true weight of the chasm between them. It wasn\u2019t just a distance of stone and air, but of risk and consequence.\n\nThe days that followed were an education in this new quiet. It was a language of absences. The absence of a timed departure in the morning, the absence of a lingering scent of pine in the stairwell, the absence of a hand-rolled cigarette or a piece of carved wood. They became two ghosts haunting the same tenement, their paths weaving around each other with a precision that was heartbreaking in its skill. Peter would hear Ewan\u2019s boots on the stone and press his back against his door, holding his breath until the sound passed. He learned to read the building's rhythms, to know when the landings would be empty, when Mrs Gable was occupied with her washing, when the men from the lower floors had all departed for the pubs. He moved through the close with a furtive grace he hadn't known he possessed, his world shrinking to the path between his door, the stairs, and the street. Life became a series of subtractions, and he felt himself being pared down to his essential, fearful self.\n\nThe shipyard was no longer a hell he escaped from, but a place of strange respite. Amid the deafening, all-consuming noise, he could not hear the silence that screamed at him back in the tenement. The fire and the fury of the work demanded his full attention, and for eight hours a day, he could almost forget the constant, low-level hum of anxiety. He became a better worker. His movements were swift and certain because his mind had no room for daydreams. He was present, anchored in the brutal reality of the forge, and the men, sensing this shift, began to treat him with a different kind of respect. He was no longer the quiet, bookish lad, but one of them, a man who pulled his weight and kept his head down. Davie clapped him on the shoulder one afternoon, a gesture of rough approval. \"That's it, son,\" he'd grunted over the noise. \"Whatever was eating at you, you've sweated it out.\" Peter didn't have the heart to tell him that he hadn't sweated it out; he'd just learned to hide it better.\n\nTheir only point of contact was the windows, and even that changed. There were no more waves, no more silhouettes lingering for long moments. It became a silent, nightly check-in, as austere and necessary as a soldier's watch. Just after the last of the tenement's lights were extinguished, Peter would stand in the darkness of his room and wait. And across the court, a match would flare. One single, brief ignition. Ewan would light a cigarette, the tiny flame illuminating his face for no more than a second, just long enough for Peter to see that he was there, that he was watching. Ewan wouldn't stay at the window; he would retreat into the darkness of his own room. But the glowing red ember of his cigarette would move back and forth in the blackness, a tiny, restless planet in their shared, secret solar system. Peter would watch until the ember was finally extinguished, and only then would he feel a measure of peace, enough to allow sleep to claim him. It was a conversation stripped to its barest element: *I am here. You are there. We are still here.* It was everything, and it was almost nothing at all.\n\nOne Tuesday, a month into this silent siege, the routine was broken. Peter was returning late from an errand, a new book tucked under his arm, the sky already the colour of lead. As he pushed open the heavy main door, he saw a cluster of people on the first-floor landing. It was the family from below Ewan\u2019s flat, the mother holding a crying baby, the father looking grim, and beside them, a stout man in a dark suit. A doctor. Peter\u2019s first instinct was to retreat, to make himself invisible, but he was already in the close, his presence noted by the father's weary glance. He began to climb the stairs, his head down, murmuring a quiet \"Evening.\" As he drew level with them, the doctor was speaking in low, serious tones. \"...keep him warm, plenty of fluids. This fever is a nasty one. It's going through the whole Gallowgate like a bad rumour.\" Peter\u2019s heart seized. He chanced a look up the stairs, towards Ewan\u2019s floor, a frantic, unspoken question in his eyes. The doctor, packing his bag, caught the look. \"Don't you worry, lad,\" he said, mistaking the direction of Peter\u2019s concern. \"Your friend upstairs is tough as an old boot. I was just up there. Same thing, a bad chill and a devil of a cough. But he'll be right as rain in a few days.\" The doctor snapped his bag shut. \"Seems to be sharing it with half the building.\" The words hit Peter with the force of a physical blow. Ewan was sick. Alone in his room. And Peter was trapped on the other side of a few feet of stone and a wall of suffocating caution. The fear he had been living with for weeks was suddenly dwarfed by a new, more terrifying one. The fear of loss, real and absolute. The rules of their quiet game suddenly seemed like the most foolish, pointless thing in the world."

                                        "text": "The doctor and the family dispersed, their footsteps and hushed worries fading into the tenement\u2019s low hum, leaving Peter alone on the landing. The air, moments before just stale and damp, now felt thin, unbreathable. All the caution he had so painstakingly cultivated, all the lessons in silence and avoidance, evaporated like steam in the cold air. The intricate chess game he and Ewan had been playing against the world was swept from the board by a single, brutal fact: Ewan was sick. He was one floor away, burning with a fever, in a room as solitary as Peter\u2019s own. The image of Ewan, the strong, vital man who smelled of forests and took the stairs two at a time, laid low and alone, was an agony that dwarfed every other fear. The risk of a curious glance or a piece of idle gossip seemed a paltry price to pay compared to the cost of inaction, of leaving Ewan to suffer in the name of a strategy that had already failed to bring them anything but a colder, more profound isolation.\n\nHe didn't return to his room to hide. He went back with a purpose that felt like a fire in his veins, melting the ice of the past weeks. The small, sparse room was no longer a prison cell but a base of operations. He moved with a decisiveness that surprised himself. From his small larder, he took the last of his tea, a precious quarter-ounce wrapped in paper. He found the lemon he had bought on a whim two days ago, a small extravagance he had been saving, its bright, sharp scent a promise of something clean and restorative. He filled his kettle with fresh water from the sink and grabbed the cleanest cloth he owned from a drawer. These were meagre offerings, the humble provisions of a shipyard worker, but as he gathered them, they felt like weapons. Each item was an act of defiance, a clear, unequivocal statement against the tyranny of their self-imposed silence. He was no longer just a boy in a window, or a ghost on the stairs; he was a friend, a pal, and he was about to prove what that truly meant.\n\nThe single flight of stairs leading to Ewan\u2019s floor had never seemed so long. It was a vertical no-man's-land, exposed and treacherous. With the kettle of water in one hand and his small collection of supplies in the other, he began the ascent. Every creak of the ancient wooden treads under his boots was a gunshot in the quiet. He could feel the eyes of the building on him, Mrs Gable\u2019s, the man with the wireless, the family with the crying baby. He imagined their doors opening, their faces appearing, their questions hanging in the air. *You're breaking the rules*, a voice in his head screamed, Ewan\u2019s voice. *This is not clever. This is not quiet.* But he pushed the voice down. Cleverness had left Ewan alone and shivering. Quiet had built a wall between them when what they needed was a bridge. He reached the landing outside Ewan\u2019s door, his heart hammering against his ribs not with fear of being caught, but with the terrifying, beautiful certainty of what he was about to do.\n\nHe stood there for a moment, the kettle growing heavy in his hand, the smell of damp stone and boiled cabbage filling his lungs. He listened. From inside the room, he could hear a sound he had never associated with Ewan: a rough, ragged cough that spoke of deep-seated illness. The sound cut through his last vestiges of hesitation. He raised his free hand, the knuckles white, and knocked. The sound was soft, just three quick taps, but in the echoing cavern of the close it sounded like a declaration of war. He waited, holding his breath. For a long moment, there was only the sound of that terrible cough in reply. Then, a shuffling noise, a muttered curse, and the slow, heavy scrape of footsteps. The lock turned with a loud, metallic clunk, and the door opened a few inches, revealing a sliver of darkness. Ewan\u2019s face appeared in the gap, pale and slick with sweat in the gloom, his peat-smoke eyes clouded with fever and confusion. \"Peter? What the hell are you doing?\" his voice was a raw, broken rasp. He looked not just sick, but angry, his gaze darting past Peter to the empty stairwell behind him.\n\n\"The doctor told me,\" Peter said, his own voice low and steady, a stark contrast to the panic roiling inside him. He held up the lemon and the packet of tea. \"He said you had the fever. I brought you something.\" He didn't wait for permission. He pushed gently against the door, an undeniable pressure that was both a question and a demand. Ewan, his strength sapped by the illness, offered no resistance. He stumbled back, letting Peter into the room, and closed the door behind him, plunging them into near-total darkness. The room was cold, the air thick and stale with the scent of sickness, though underneath it all, the faint, ghostly trace of pine lingered like a memory. As his eyes adjusted, Peter could make out the spartan details: a narrow iron bed, a single wooden chair, a small table cluttered with tools for woodcarving, and dozens of tiny, intricately carved birds, perched on every available surface. Ewan leaned heavily against the closed door, his body wracked by a shiver. He looked utterly spent, the solid, unshakeable man reduced to a fragile shadow. \"You shouldn't be here,\" Ewan rasped, though the words lacked their usual force. \"It's not safe.\" Peter ignored him. He walked past him to the small table, set down his supplies, and turned to face him, the small, carved birds his silent audience. \"No,\" Peter said, his voice imbued with a quiet authority he didn't know he possessed. \"It's not safe for you to be alone.\""

He watched, swaying slightly, as Peter moved about the small, cold room with a quiet, unnerving competence. Peter\u2019s eyes swept over the space, noting the tiny, grate-fronted fireplace, its black maw empty and cold, a bucket of coal and a handful of kindling beside it. There was no hesitation in his movements. He knelt on the grimy hearthrug, his back to Ewan, and began to arrange the kindling with the focused precision of a man building a bomb, or a prayer. The scratch of the match, the tiny burst of sulphur and flame, was the only sound besides Ewan's shallow, ragged breathing.\n\nEwan didn't protest further. The fight had gone out of him, leeched away by the fever. He sank onto the edge of his narrow iron bed, the frame groaning under his weight, and watched Peter as if he were a strange apparition. He watched as Peter coaxed the small flame, feeding it scraps of paper and then splinters of wood until it caught, a small, hungry thing that began to throw a dancing, uncertain light onto the walls. The shadows of the carved birds leaped and swayed. Peter filled a small, soot-blackened pot with water from his kettle and set it on the grate to warm, then meticulously sliced the lemon on a clean plate he found on the windowsill. The sharp, clean scent of the citrus cut through the stale air of the sickroom, a bright, defiant note in the fug of illness and coal smoke. It was an act of such simple, domestic care that it felt more intimate, more shockingly profound, than any kiss in the dark.\n\nWhen the water was steaming, Peter poured it into a tin mug, adding the tea and a thick slice of lemon, the steam rising in a fragrant cloud. He carried it over to the bed. Ewan was shivering now, a deep, uncontrollable tremor that shook his broad frame. His hands, when he reached for the mug, were unsteady. Peter\u2019s own hands closed around Ewan\u2019s, steadying them, feeling the burning, dry heat of his skin. The contact was electric, a jolt of pure information: *fever, weakness, life*. \"Drink,\" Peter said, his voice soft but firm, and he held the mug for Ewan, tilting it to his lips as if he were a child. Ewan drank, his eyes closing, a low groan of relief escaping his throat. After a few sips, he sagged back against the thin pillow. Peter took the cloth he\u2019d brought, dipped it in the remaining cool water from the kettle, wrung it out, and gently laid it across Ewan\u2019s forehead. Ewan flinched at the initial shock of the cold, then relaxed into it with a sigh that seemed to come from the very depths of his soul.\n\nWith Ewan finally still, his breathing a little easier, Peter had a moment to truly see the room. It was Ewan\u2019s whole world. The walls were bare but for the birds. They were everywhere. A flock of gulls perched on the high shelf above the bed, their wings half-spread as if ready for flight. A tiny, perfect wren sat on the corner of the table. An owl, its wooden eyes seeming to hold a deep, ancient knowledge, was tucked beside a pile of books. They weren\u2019t just carvings; they were personalities, each one captured in a moment of life. This was the forest Ewan carried inside him, the open space he had spoken of on the roof. It was his escape, his secret language made tangible. Reaching out, Peter gently touched the smooth, polished head of a blackbird resting on the bedpost. He felt the patient hours of work in the wood, the love. He was no longer just standing in Ewan\u2019s room; he had been allowed into the heart of the garden.\n\n\"You\u2019re a damn fool, Peter,\" Ewan\u2019s voice was a rough whisper from the bed, his eyes still closed. The words held no anger now, only a raw, gravelly exhaustion. \"A bloody, stubborn fool.\"\n\nPeter turned from the birds and looked at the man on the bed, at the damp cloth on his forehead, at the vulnerability in the line of his jaw. He thought of the weeks of silence, the fear, the cold expanse of the back court. He thought of the doctor\u2019s casual words on the stairs and the terror that had bloomed in his chest, a terror that had proven stronger than any rule. He walked back to the bedside and sat on the single wooden chair, pulling it close.\n\n\"Aye,\" Peter said quietly, his voice full of a feeling he couldn't name. \"Maybe I am.\" He reached out and adjusted the blanket, pulling it higher over Ewan\u2019s shoulder. \"But you were alone.\""

                                        "text": "Ewan didn\u2019t answer, but the tension in his shoulders seemed to dissolve, a quiet surrender. He let his head fall back against the pillow, his breath a ragged sigh. The small fire Peter had built spat and crackled in the grate, a living, breathing thing in the cold room. It threw a warm, flickering glow on the bare floorboards and the flock of wooden birds, making their shadows dance like restless spirits. Outside, the city hummed its indifferent tune, but inside this small, fourth-floor room, a new kind of silence settled. It was not the strained, fearful quiet of the past weeks, but a shared stillness, deep and resonant, a space where two people could simply be, without pretence or performance. The world had been shrunk down to the dimensions of this room, to the sound of the fire and the rhythm of a fevered man\u2019s breathing.\n\nPeter stayed in the chair, a sentry at his post. He watched the rise and fall of Ewan\u2019s chest, the slight twitch of his eyelids. The anger and defiance that had propelled him up the stairs had subsided, replaced by a low, steady hum of purpose. He was where he was supposed to be. He got up quietly and added a few more lumps of coal to the fire, coaxing it into a stronger, more consistent heat that began to push back the room\u2019s bone-deep chill. He refilled the mug with warm water, this time lacing it with a squeeze of lemon and a spoonful of the precious sugar he\u2019d thought to grab from his own cupboard. He saw Ewan's carving tools lying on the table, a jumble of well-worn knives and gouges next to a half-finished hawk, its wings poised in an intricate state of arrested motion. He ran a finger over the smooth, sanded wood, feeling the ghost of Ewan\u2019s hands, the same hands that were now too weak to hold a mug steady. The contrast was a sharp, painful ache in his chest.\n\nHours passed. The tenement outside fell into a deeper quiet as the last of the wireless sets were switched off and the final arguments faded behind closed doors. Peter must have dozed, his head nodding forward, for he startled awake to the sound of a low murmur. Ewan was moving restlessly, his head thrashing on the pillow, his hands plucking at the thin blanket. He was muttering, his voice thick with delirium. \"Too many eyes\u2026 the trees have eyes\u2026 can\u2019t see the stars\u2026\" Peter was at his side in an instant. He took the cloth, which had grown warm, dipped it again in the basin of cool water, and laid it gently on Ewan's brow. \"Shhh, Ewan,\" he whispered, his voice close to Ewan's ear. \"You're alright. It's just me. It\u2019s Peter. You\u2019re safe.\" He wasn't sure if the words registered, but he repeated them like an incantation, a shield against the fever-dreams. He took one of Ewan\u2019s hot, restless hands in his own. His grip was surprisingly strong, clinging to Peter\u2019s as if he were a lifeline in a storm-tossed sea. Peter held on, an anchor in the dark.\n\nSometime in the deepest part of the night, when the only sound was the lonely rattle of a far-off tram, Ewan\u2019s eyes opened. The fever-glaze was gone, replaced by a lucid exhaustion. He looked at Peter, at their joined hands, at the flickering fire, and then around the small, warm room. He seemed to be taking in the scene from a great distance, as if seeing it for the first time. His throat worked for a moment before he spoke, his voice a dry rasp. \"You stayed.\" It wasn't a question. \"Of course I stayed,\" Peter said, his own voice thick with sleeplessness. He felt a blush creep up his neck, a strange mix of shyness and pride. Ewan squeezed his hand, a faint but deliberate pressure. \"My da,\" he said, his gaze fixed on the ceiling, \"he used to say the only thing worse than being sick was being sick alone.\" He turned his head on the pillow to look at Peter, and in the faint firelight, his peat-smoke eyes were dark pools of a raw, unguarded emotion Peter had never seen before. \"Thank you.\" The words were simple, scraped from the depths of his weariness, but they landed with the weight of a sacred vow.\n\nThe first hint of dawn began to bleed into the sky, turning the black of the window to a bruised, watery grey. The reality of the outside world, of the coming day, began to press at the edges of their small sanctuary. The shipyard. His own empty room. The questions. Peter felt a familiar knot of anxiety tighten in his stomach. He should go. He should slip back down the stairs before the building woke up, resume his post, maintain the fiction. But the thought of leaving Ewan, of letting the cold and the silence creep back into this room, was unbearable. He looked at Ewan, who seemed to have drifted into a true, healing sleep at last, his breathing deep and even, the tremors gone. The fever had broken. He couldn't leave him. Not yet. Making a decision that felt both insane and completely necessary, Peter gently disentangled his hand from Ewan's. He crept to the door, opened it a crack, and listened. The close was silent. He slipped out, his boots silent on the stone, and went not down, but up. To the top-floor washhouse. He soaked his own handkerchief in the cold, scummy water from the basin, then crept back down to his own floor. He unlocked his door, went inside for only a moment, and then re-emerged, locking it behind him. He returned to Ewan's room as a thief returns to the scene of a crime, his heart pounding. Back inside, he went to the window, the one that mirrored his own. He waited. Soon, he knew, Davie or one of the other men from the yard who lived nearby would pass, and seeing his dark window, would assume he was gone. Then, Peter took the damp handkerchief and, with a grim sense of purpose, began to rub it against his own face and neck, forcing a clammy, artificial chill onto his skin. He would not go to the shipyard. When Mrs Gable eventually knocked to ask after him, he would be sick. He would have the same fever that was sweeping the Gallowgate. He would build the wall higher, but this time, he would be on the same side of it as Ewan."

                                        "text": "The first hour of daylight was the longest of Peter\u2019s life. He sat in the chair by Ewan\u2019s bed, a conspirator in a crime that hadn\u2019t yet been discovered, every sound from the close magnified a hundredfold. He heard the first of the shipyard men clattering down the stairs, their gruff voices and loud boots a familiar part of a morning he had chosen to betray. He heard the milkman\u2019s clinking bottles, Mrs Gable\u2019s door opening and closing on the floor below, the city waking up to a day he would not be a part of. With each sound, his stomach clenched. He was an absence in his own life, a ghost in his own room, a boy who had deliberately vanished from the world in order to exist more fully in this one small, fire-warmed space. Ewan slept on, oblivious, his breathing the only steady, reassuring rhythm in the tense, waiting silence.\n\nThe knock came just after eight, three sharp, brisk raps that were unmistakably Mrs Gable\u2019s. It was not on Ewan\u2019s door, but on his own, one floor below. Peter froze, his hand tightening on the arm of the chair. He heard her knock again, more insistently this time, followed by a pause. \"Peter? Lad, you'll be late for the yard!\" Her reedy voice, muffled by two floors, carried up the stairwell with perfect, dreadful clarity. He held his breath. He heard her tutting, a sound of mild exasperation, and then her footsteps retreating. He allowed himself a slow, shaky exhale. He had cleared the first hurdle. But he knew it was only a reprieve.\n\nA half-hour later, the footsteps returned, slower this time, climbing past his own floor. They stopped directly outside Ewan's door. The knock, when it came, was softer, more hesitant. Ewan stirred, his brow furrowing in sleep. Peter was on his feet in an instant, his heart a frantic bird against his ribs. He crossed to the door and leaned his ear against the cold wood. \"Mr Scott?\" Mrs Gable's voice was gentle, laced with concern. \"I know you're unwell, dear, but I'm worried about the lad below you. He's not gone to work and he's not answering his door. I just wanted to be sure he wasn't\u2026\" She let the thought hang, unfinished and grim. This was it. The performance. Peter took a deep, steadying breath, opened the door a crack, and peered out, blinking as if the weak light of the landing was a painful glare.\n\nHe let his shoulders slump, forcing a shiver into his frame. \"Mrs Gable,\" he croaked, his voice a deliberately weak and scratchy imitation of Ewan's. He coughed, a dry, pathetic sound that scraped his throat. \"I'm sorry. I think\u2026 I think I've got it too.\" He watched her face, a mask of practised misery fixed on his own. The landlady's sharp eyes softened with a mixture of sympathy and weary resignation. She peered past him into the gloom of the room, where Ewan was now sitting up in bed, looking pale and confused. \"Oh, you poor lambs,\" she sighed, shaking her head. \"The pair of you. It's a wicked flu. Well, at least you're not alone. One of you can fetch for the other.\" She looked from Peter's wan face to Ewan's shadowed one. \"Is there anything I can get for you both? A bit of broth, perhaps?\" Her gaze was kind, her concern genuine. There was no suspicion, only a tired acceptance of the tenement's communal miseries. The relief was so profound it made Peter feel dizzy. \"No, thank you, Mrs Gable. We'll manage,\" he said, his voice barely a whisper. \"Just need to sleep it off.\" He offered her a weak, grateful smile and slowly closed the door, leaning his forehead against the wood, his entire body trembling with the aftermath of the lie.\n\nWhen he turned back into the room, Ewan was watching him, his expression a complex mixture of awe and alarm. He had swung his legs over the side of the bed, his bare feet on the cold floorboards. The fire had warmed the room enough that he was no longer shivering, and the lucid light of recovery was fully back in his eyes. \"Peter,\" he said, his voice still rough but stronger now. \"What in God's name have you done?\" It wasn\u2019t an accusation. It was a question born of pure disbelief. He gestured around the room, at the simmering pot, the neatly folded blanket, at Peter himself, standing there like a dishevelled, triumphant actor who had just walked off stage. \"You can't just\u2026 not go to the yard. They'll sack you. You can't just move in here. What were you thinking?\"\n\n\"I was thinking you were going to die alone in a cold room,\" Peter retorted, his own voice sharper than he intended, the residual adrenaline of the performance making him bold. \"I was thinking that all our cleverness and our quiet and our rules meant nothing if I let that happen.\" He walked over to the fire and busied himself with the poker, prodding the coals with unnecessary force. \"So I stopped being clever. I left my door locked from the inside and I came here.\" He looked over his shoulder at Ewan. \"Mrs Gable thinks I'm sick in my own room. Now she thinks we're both sick, and we're looking after each other. Like pals.\" He spat the last word out, a bitter echo of the fear that had driven them apart. But here, in the safety of their shared confinement, the word was not a disguise; it was a shield. It was the story they had sold the world, and for now, the world had bought it. The sheer, insane genius of it was just beginning to dawn on him. They hadn't just built a wall. Peter had found a door, and he'd locked it from the inside."

The carefully constructed fortress of caution he had built around himself, rule by painstaking rule, had just been stormed not by an enemy, but by this quiet, determined boy with shipyard dust in his hair and a strategist\u2019s mind hidden behind a poet\u2019s eyes. He should have been angry. He should have been terrified. The risk was monumental, a gamble that could bring the whole flimsy structure of their lives crashing down. But as he looked at Peter, standing there flushed with defiance and the heat from the hearth, a slow, unfamiliar warmth spread through his own chest, a warmth that had nothing to do with the fading fever. A laugh, a real one, unperformed and incredulous, bubbled up from deep inside him. It was a rusty, cracked sound, but it was genuine.\n\n\"You're mad,\" Ewan said, the words catching in his throat. He shook his head slowly, a dawning smile finally breaking across his face. \"Completely and utterly mad.\" He pushed himself up straighter, the strength returning to his limbs now that the immediate threat of solitude had been so thoroughly vanquished. He looked around the room, at the small fire burning brightly, the scent of lemon and steam in the air, the general air of order that Peter had imposed on his bachelor's chaos. It felt less like his own grim room and more like a corner of the world that had been claimed and defended. \"And Mrs Gable just\u2026 believed you?\"\n\n\"Why wouldn't she?\" Peter replied, a spark of pride in his voice. \"It's the perfect story. The whole street is sick. Why not us? And everyone knows it's good to have a pal.\" He leaned against the mantelpiece, the firelight catching the determined set of his jaw. \"Now she'll leave us alone. She might even leave us broth.\" The pragmatism of it, the simple, devastating logic, struck Ewan with the force of a revelation. He had been so focused on hiding, on being invisible, that he had never considered the power of a plausible, visible lie. Peter hadn't built a higher wall; he'd created a smoke screen, a piece of theatre so mundane and believable that no one would ever think to look behind the curtain.\n\nAnd so began their period of stolen time. Their world shrank to the four walls of Ewan\u2019s room, and in doing so, it became infinite. The first day, Ewan was still weak, and Peter played the role of caregiver with a solemn dedication. Just as he\u2019d predicted, a pot of thin, salty mutton broth appeared outside the door mid-morning, a testament to Mrs Gable\u2019s kindness and the success of their deception. They shared it, sitting on the edge of the bed, a quiet, conspiratorial glee passing between them with every spoonful. The constant, low-level fear that had been Peter\u2019s companion for weeks was replaced by a humming, vigilant contentment. He was no longer waiting for a signal or dreading a footstep; he was inside the fortress, guarding the gate.\n\nAs Ewan\u2019s strength returned over the next day, the dynamic shifted from patient and nurse to that of two people simply sharing a life. The enforced proximity, which should have been awkward, was instead a catalyst for a new kind of intimacy. They moved around each other in the small space with an unconscious, fluid grace, their shoulders brushing as one tended the fire while the other made tea. They talked. They talked for hours, filling the silence they had so long endured with the stories of their lives. Peter spoke of his childhood in a fishing village on the coast, of his mother who had loved books and his father who had been lost to the sea, the reason he\u2019d come to the city to find work that was tied to solid ground. He confessed his dreams of one day seeing the world beyond the pages, of finding a place where the air wasn\u2019t thick with coal.\n\nIn return, Ewan, his hands finally steady enough to pick up his carving tools, began to unlock his own past. He told Peter about the birds. Each one had a name and a story. He picked up the half-finished hawk, its feathers intricately detailed. \"This one's for my brother, Cal,\" he said, his voice soft. \"He's up in the Highlands. Always said I saw things he couldn't, that I could find the bird inside the wood.\" He explained that the carving was the only thing that quieted his mind, the only way he knew how to pray. He spoke of his own departure from his small town, not of forestry work, but of a quiet, brutal shunning after a rumour started, a story about him and another boy that had spread like wildfire. He\u2019d left to protect his family from the talk, trading the vast, open sky for the anonymity of the Gallowgate\u2019s grimy canyons. Peter listened, his heart aching with a fierce, protective tenderness. He looked at the flock of silent, wooden birds, and he understood. This wasn't just a hobby; it was an act of survival, a way of populating his loneliness with beautiful, wild things that could not be caged by the judgment of others.\n\nOn the third night, the fever was a distant memory. The city outside was quiet, the fire had burned down to a deep, pulsating bed of embers that filled the room with a soft, red glow. They sat on the floor, their backs against the side of the bed, sharing the last of Ewan\u2019s tobacco in a hand-rolled cigarette that passed between them. The conversation had dwindled, the stories told, leaving a comfortable, humming silence in their wake. Peter watched the smoke curl from Ewan\u2019s lips and vanish into the shadows. He felt Ewan\u2019s gaze on him, steady and intense in the dim light. The constant physical closeness of the past days had re-calibrated his senses; he was acutely aware of the warmth of Ewan\u2019s shoulder pressed against his own, the rhythm of his breathing. Ewan reached out, his fingers tracing the line of Peter's jaw, a touch that was no longer tentative or questioning. It was a touch that knew its destination. He leaned in, and the kiss was nothing like the desperate, frantic ones on the rooftop. It was slow, and deep, and sure. It tasted of tobacco and woodsmoke and the quiet triumph of their shared sanctuary. It was not a kiss of defiance against the world, but a kiss of coming home."

                                        "text": "The world, when Peter woke, came to him slowly, filtered through the unfamiliar warmth of another body. He was curled on his side, his back pressed against the solid wall of Ewan\u2019s chest, one of Ewan\u2019s arms draped possessively over his waist. The grey morning light, usually so accusatory, was soft and forgiving as it filtered through the grimy windowpane, illuminating dust motes dancing in a lazy column. For the first time since coming to this city, Peter felt the quiet not as an absence, but as a presence. It was the soft sound of Ewan\u2019s breathing in his ear, the gentle ticking of a clock he hadn't noticed before, the distant, muffled rumble of Glasgow starting its day. He lay perfectly still, memorising the feeling of Ewan\u2019s hand resting on his stomach, the rough texture of the wool blanket, the faint scent of woodsmoke that clung to the pillow. This was not the desperate, fever-pitch of the rooftop, nor the stolen, fearful moments on the stairs. This was something else entirely. It was a quiet, profound, and terrifyingly normal morning.\n\nTheir stolen days bled into a week, a small lifetime lived within the confines of a single room. The pretence of sickness became their new reality, a shield that allowed for a fragile, impossible domesticity to bloom. Peter learned the landscape of Ewan\u2019s body as intimately as he knew the pages of his favourite books, and Ewan learned the rhythms of Peter\u2019s thoughts, anticipating his moods from the way he turned a page or stared into the fire. They existed in a bubble of shared tasks and easy silence. Mornings were for brewing strong tea and sharing a piece of toast, their movements a choreographed dance in the cramped space. In the afternoons, Ewan would sit by the window, the light falling on his hands as he carved, the soft scrape and whisper of his knife a counterpoint to Peter reading aloud from his book of sea voyages and distant lands. Peter\u2019s voice would fill the room with tales of open water and star-filled skies, and Ewan would make the stories real, coaxing a diving gannet or a soaring albatross from a block of unassuming limewood. It was a perfect, self-contained world, and the knowledge of its impermanence made every moment unbearably precious.\n\nThe first tremor that shook their sanctuary came not as a knock, but as a thin, white sliver sliding under the door. It was a Tuesday morning, a full ten days since Peter had last set foot in the shipyard. They both saw it at the same time, a pale rectangle against the dark floorboards. An official-looking envelope from the Gallowgate postal service, misdelivered to Ewan\u2019s door instead of his own. Ewan retrieved it, his expression hardening as he recognised the shipyard\u2019s insignia stamped in the corner. He handed it to Peter without a word. Peter\u2019s hands, which had been so steady making their breakfast minutes before, trembled as he broke the seal. The language was formal, cold, and final. His position had been terminated due to unexplained absence. His final wages could be collected from the foreman\u2019s office. The paper felt heavy in his hand, a death sentence for the life he had known. The noise of the shipyard, the security of the wage packet, the grim purpose of his days\u2014all of it, gone. He looked up at Ewan, the small room suddenly feeling like a cage, the walls closing in. The world they had so carefully kept at bay had just kicked down the door.\n\n\"I knew this would happen,\" Peter said, his voice hollow. He sank onto the edge of the bed, the letter crumpled in his fist. \"It's over. I've got nothing, Ewan. No job. No money coming in.\" The reality of his recklessness crashed over him, a cold, sickening wave. Their week of stolen time had been bought at the cost of his entire future. All he had was this room, and this room wasn\u2019t even his. He felt a familiar, desperate panic rising, the old fear that he would be swept away, lost in the city's unforgiving currents. He had flown too close to the sun, and now he was falling, the wax of his wings melting away.\n\nEwan crossed the room and knelt in front of him, taking the crumpled letter from his hand and smoothing it out on his knee. He looked not at the words, but at Peter\u2019s face, his peat-smoke eyes serious and calm. \"No,\" he said, his voice low and firm, a steady anchor in the storm of Peter\u2019s panic. \"It's not over. It's just changed.\" He reached for the table and picked up the hawk he had been carving, the one for his brother. It was nearly finished, its wings perfectly poised, its wooden eyes sharp and focused. \"This city, this yard\u2026 it was never your sky, Peter. It was a cage you happened to find food in. I told you once, there's always somewhere else to fly to.\" He held the hawk out. It wasn't a gift; it was a promise, an argument. \"My brother, Cal. He works a timber plantation, north of Aberdeen. They're always looking for men. Hard work, but the air is clean and the pay is honest. And the foremen don't care about anything but how well you can swing an axe.\" He looked Peter straight in the eye, his grip tightening on the wooden bird. \"They don't care who you share your roof with.\"\n\nThe proposition hung in the air, audacious and terrifying. To leave Glasgow. To abandon the only life he knew, grim as it was, for a place he\u2019d only read about on maps. It was one thing to dream of escape from the pages of a book, another entirely to pack a bag and walk out into the cold reality of it. It was the sea calling to his father all over again, a siren song of the unknown. But then he looked at Ewan, kneeling before him, offering not just a half-formed dream but a tangible plan, a destination. He looked at the life they had managed to carve out in this tiny, besieged room\u2014the shared meals, the stories, the quiet understanding, the breathtaking normalcy of waking up in Ewan\u2019s arms. The thought of losing that, of returning to his own cold, empty room, of watching Ewan become just a shape in a window again\u2014that was a fear greater than any unknown. It was the difference between falling and flying.\n\n\"What about\u2026 all this?\" Peter asked, gesturing vaguely at the room, the flock of birds, the small universe Ewan had built. Ewan followed his gaze, a flicker of sadness in his eyes. \"They're just wood,\" he said softly. \"The real birds are out there.\" He placed the hawk into Peter\u2019s hands. Its weight was solid, real. A plan. A future. Peter curled his fingers around it, the smooth, carved feathers pressing into his palm. He took a deep breath, the air tasting of hope and fear in equal measure, and he nodded. \"Alright,\" he said, the word a quiet vow. \"When do we leave?\" A slow, brilliant smile spread across Ewan\u2019s face, the real, lopsided smile that had started it all. He stood up, pulling Peter to his feet with him. \"As soon as we've sold what we can and packed what we can't,\" he said, his voice alive with a sudden, fierce energy. \"We leave at night. We'll be ghosts, gone by morning.\" They stood in the centre of the room, no longer a sanctuary but a launching pad, the shipyard's dismissal letter lying discarded on the floor like a shed skin. Together, they turned and looked out the window, not at each other's separate worlds, but at the sprawling, grimy city below, a place that had almost broken them. It was not their home. It was just a place they were leaving."

                                        "text": "The decision, once made, electrified the air in the small room. The lethargy of their false sickness and the paralysis of fear were burned away by a sudden, fierce blaze of purpose. Their sanctuary was no longer a place to hide, but a temporary camp from which to plan a great expedition. The world, which had been a threat to be kept out, was now a thing to be navigated, conquered. Ewan, imbued with a restless energy that seemed to flow back into his limbs with the plan's formation, hauled a dusty tin trunk from beneath his bed. Its metal feet scraped a harsh, decisive line across the floorboards, a sound that was not an ending, but a beginning. He clicked open the rusted latches, the noise echoing in the quiet room. \"Right,\" he said, his voice crisp and clear, a captain\u2019s voice. \"Inventory. We take what we can carry, what has a purpose. Everything else is a ghost. We leave the ghosts behind.\"\n\nThe first sacrifice was the flock. For two hours, Ewan sat on the floor, his back straight, and presided over the dispersal of his wooden children. He handled each one with a tender reverence, his calloused fingers tracing the lines he had so patiently carved into them. He was not just packing; he was saying goodbye. Peter watched in silence, his heart aching with a shared sense of loss. He understood that these were not just objects; they were the silent companions of Ewan\u2019s lonely years, the population of his solitude. Ewan set aside three small figures: the nearly-finished hawk for his brother, a tiny, perfect wren which he pressed into Peter\u2019s palm without a word, and a sleek, diving otter that he tucked deep into his own satchel. The rest\u2014gulls and finches, owls and blackbirds\u2014were wrapped carefully in old newspaper and arranged in a cardboard box. \"There\u2019s a man near the Barras,\" Ewan explained, his voice carefully neutral. \"Deals in oddities. He knows my work. He\u2019ll give us a fair price.\" He didn\u2019t look at Peter as he spoke, his gaze fixed on the box, and Peter knew that a fair price for such a thing did not exist.\n\nThey walked to the dealer\u2019s shop through a part of the city Peter had never seen, a labyrinth of narrow streets where the tenements leaned in so close they seemed to be whispering secrets to one another. The shop was a dusty cave of forgotten things, smelling of decaying paper and furniture polish. The dealer, a small, bird-like man with spectacles perched on the end of his nose, unwrapped each carving with greedy, appreciative fingers. He hummed and nodded, holding them up to the weak light. The haggling was brief and quiet. Ewan stood firm, his jaw set, and the dealer, sensing a resolve that went beyond mere commerce, eventually agreed. They left the shop with a thin sheaf of banknotes in Ewan\u2019s pocket, the weight of the money feeling insignificant compared to the sudden lightness of the box he no longer carried. As they walked away, Peter glanced back and saw the dealer placing one of the gulls in the shop window, its wings spread, forever poised for a flight it would never take.\n\nThe next trial fell to Peter alone. He had to return to the shipyard, a final descent into the inferno to claim the wages that would fund their escape. Ewan had wanted to go with him, but Peter refused. This was his ghost to lay to rest. Walking through the familiar, grimy streets towards the yard felt like walking into a dream he\u2019d already woken from. The deafening roar reached him blocks away, a sound that no longer filled him with dread, but with a strange, detached pity. He was an outsider now, a tourist in his own former life. At the gate, he saw Davie, sharing a cigarette with another man. The old riveter saw him, and his weathered face registered a flicker of surprise, then something else, something softer. He ambled over, his expression unreadable. \"Heard you were down with the fever, lad,\" Davie said, his voice a low rumble. He looked Peter up and down, taking in his pale face and the dark circles under his eyes, the genuine signs of sleeplessness and anxiety that passed perfectly for the lingering effects of illness. \"Still look half-drowned. You should be at your bed.\" There was no anger, no judgment, only a gruff, paternal concern. \"I\u2019m away, Davie,\" Peter said, the words feeling momentous. \"Leaving the city.\" Davie nodded slowly, as if he\u2019d been expecting it. \"Aye,\" he said, and clapped a heavy hand on Peter\u2019s shoulder. \"Some birds aren't meant for this kind of cage. Good luck to you, son.\" And with that, he turned and walked back to his companion, the conversation over. The foreman in the office was less sentimental. He was a creature of ledgers and timetables, and Peter was merely a name to be crossed off a list. He slid the small brown envelope of wages across the counter without meeting Peter\u2019s eye, already turning his attention to the next piece of paperwork. Peter took the money, the tangible price of his freedom, and walked out of the shipyard gates without a backward glance, the shriek of metal being tortured into shape fading behind him for the last time.\n\nTheir final night in Glasgow was quiet and purposeful. With the money from the birds and Peter\u2019s wages secured in the tin trunk, they packed their few belongings. Peter discarded his oil-stained shipyard clothes in a corner, leaving them like a shed skin. He packed his handful of books, his clean shirts, and the small wooden wren Ewan had given him, which he wrapped in a spare sock for protection. The room, stripped of most of its carvings and their personal effects, felt large and empty, a hollowed-out space that held only the echo of the life they had lived within it. After a last meal of bread and cheese, they stood together at the window. The back court below was a slick, black mirror, reflecting nothing. In the tenement opposite, Peter\u2019s own window was a dark, vacant eye. For months, he had stared across this chasm, projecting all his loneliness and longing onto the figure on the other side. Now, that figure was standing beside him, his arm warm and solid around Peter\u2019s shoulders, and together they looked out at the empty space. \"Funny,\" Peter whispered. \"I used to think that was the whole world.\" Ewan pulled him closer. \"We were just reading the map,\" he said. \"Now we go find the place.\" They waited as the tenement settled, as the last lights blinked out, until the only sound was the wind sighing in the chimney pots. The time had come. With Ewan carrying the trunk and Peter his own satchel, they opened the door one last time. The air in the close was cold and smelled, as always, of damp and boiled cabbage. It was the scent of a life they were leaving forever. They descended the stairs, each step a silent farewell, their boots making no sound on the worn stone. They passed Peter\u2019s floor, and he did not look at his own door. They passed Mrs Gable's, and imagined her sleeping, oblivious to the flight of her two sick birds. At the main door, Ewan paused and set down the trunk. He looked at Peter, a question in his eyes. Peter simply nodded. Together, they put their shoulders to the heavy wooden door and pushed it open, stepping out into the cold, empty street. A light drizzle was beginning to fall, but it was cleansing now, washing the grime from the air as they turned their backs on the Gallowgate and began to walk towards the east, towards the distant promise of the sea and the clean, sharp scent of pine."

                                        "text": "The walk through the sleeping city was a journey through a graveyard of their own making. Every street corner, every shadowed close, was a monument to a life they had just buried. The sound of their footsteps, amplified in the pre-dawn stillness, seemed shockingly loud, a desecration of the quiet. Peter felt like a phantom, his satchel a sack of pilfered memories, while Ewan strode forward with a grim purpose, the tin trunk in his hand a ballast against the pull of the past. The light, persistent rain plastered Peter\u2019s hair to his forehead and trickled down his collar, a cold baptism into this new, untethered existence. He kept glancing over his shoulder, half-expecting to see the tenement looming behind them, a great, soot-stained beast unwilling to let them go. But there was nothing. The city dissolved behind them into a smear of weak, yellow light and misty darkness, its familiar scents of coal smoke and river damp giving way to the cleaner, sharper smell of wet roads and open, empty spaces. They were erasing themselves, footstep by footstep, from the only map they had ever known.\n\nThey reached the main artery leading north just as the sky began to bleed from black to a thin, watery grey. The road was a slick ribbon of asphalt, humming with the promise of distance. Here, they were no longer ghosts, but something far more vulnerable: two men with their lives in a box, waiting on the charity of strangers. Lorries began to appear, their headlamps cutting through the gloom like the eyes of monstrous, mythical beasts, their engines a growing roar that vibrated through the soles of Peter\u2019s boots. He stood back, feeling small and exposed, but Ewan stepped forward to the edge of the road, his posture confident, his thumb jutting out with a practiced, almost arrogant, flick. The first few lorries thundered past, spraying them with a fine mist of road-grime. But then one, a heavy flatbed carrying a load of timber shrouded in tarpaulin, slowed with a loud hiss of air brakes. The driver, a burly man with a face like a crumpled map and a cigarette dangling from his lips, leaned across the cab. \"Where to?\" he yelled over the idling engine. \"North,\" Ewan called back, his voice steady. \"As far as you're going.\" The man grunted, nodded at the back. \"Perth. Chuck your gear in the back. Get in.\" The relief was a physical thing, unknotting a tight coil of fear in Peter\u2019s chest. They heaved the trunk onto the flatbed and scrambled into the high, warm cab, the smell of diesel and stale tobacco a welcome fug against the morning\u2019s chill.\n\nAs the lorry gained speed, the world outside the wide windscreen began to change with a speed that left Peter breathless. The last of the city\u2019s industrial suburbs, with their skeletal gantries and grim-faced factories, fell away, replaced by rolling fields of winter-brown grass, patchworked with low stone walls and dotted with stoic, lonely-looking sheep. For the first time in his life, Peter saw the horizon as a clean, unbroken line. The sky, vast and bruised with cloud, was a revelation. It wasn't the small, framed square he was used to seeing from his window, but a great, arching dome that dwarfed everything beneath it. He had read descriptions of landscapes like this, of hills that 'rolled like the sea', but the words were a pale, flimsy substitute for the reality of it, for the sheer, staggering scale of the world beyond the Gallowgate. He sat pressed against the passenger door, his face turned to the window, utterly rapt. He felt Ewan\u2019s gaze on him and turned to see a soft, knowing smile on his face. Ewan didn\u2019t speak, he just gave a slight nod, a silent acknowledgment that said, *See? This is it. This is the place.* And in that shared, silent moment, Peter felt the last of the city\u2019s grime being washed from his soul.\n\nThe driver dropped them at a crossroads somewhere south of Perth as the sun was beginning its descent, painting the undersides of the clouds in shades of bruised orange and purple. The sudden silence after the lorry\u2019s departure was deafening, broken only by the whisper of the wind through a stand of skeletal birch trees. The air was cold and sharp, smelling of damp earth and something else, a clean, peaty scent that was the very essence of the countryside. They were truly alone. With the light failing, a new, more primal anxiety set in. Hunger, and the need for shelter. They walked for half a mile down a narrow side road until they spotted it: a derelict stone barn, its roof sagging in the middle but mostly intact, its doorway a gaping black mouth. It was not a home, but it was a reprieve. Inside, the air was thick with the ghost-scent of old hay and livestock. As Ewan set the trunk down with a weary thud, a handful of startled pigeons burst from the rafters and fled into the twilight. They made their camp in a dry corner, the trunk serving as their table. They ate bread and hard cheese, the simple food tasting better than any hot meal Peter had ever had. As the last of the light died, leaving them in a profound, starless dark, they unrolled their single blanket and huddled together for warmth, their backs against the cold stone wall. The world outside was vast and wild and unknown, but here, in the dark, with the solid weight of Ewan beside him, Peter felt a sense of safety more absolute than any he had ever known."

                                        "text": "Peter woke to a cold so profound it felt like a solid thing, a block of ice he was encased in. It was a different cold from the city\u2019s damp, insidious chill that seeped into the lungs; this was a clean, sharp, absolute cold that bit at his exposed cheeks and turned his breath into a cloud of white vapour. He was pressed against Ewan\u2019s back, their shared blanket a pitifully thin barrier against the pre-dawn frost that had silvered the broken flagstones of the barn floor. For a moment, disoriented, he thought he was back in his room in the Gallowgate, the cold a familiar enemy. But then he smelled it: not soot and damp stone, but the rich, loamy scent of earth, the ghost of hay, and the sharp tang of frost on sleeping fields. He was free. And this was the price of it. He shifted slightly, and Ewan stirred, a low grunt escaping him as he pulled the blanket tighter around them, his arm instinctively tightening around Peter\u2019s waist. In the deep, resonant stillness, Peter could hear the rustle of a mouse in the straw and, far away, the lonely cry of a curlew. The fear was still there, a small, cold stone in his gut, but it was overshadowed by a feeling so vast and new he had no name for it, a feeling of being utterly alive in the immensity of the world.\n\nTheir morning ablutions were a spartan affair at a cattle trough in a nearby field, the water so cold it made Peter\u2019s teeth ache and his skin sting. They shared the last of their bread, which was stale, and a piece of hard cheese, their hands blue and clumsy with the cold. Yet, there was an easy grace to their movements, a wordless communication that had been forged in the crucible of their confined week. Ewan broke the cheese with his thumbs and handed half to Peter. Peter uncorked their water bottle and passed it to Ewan. These simple acts of sharing felt more significant than any grand declaration, a testament to their new reality. They were a single unit of two, adrift in the world, their survival dependent on this quiet, instinctive partnership. Ewan, his face etched with weariness but his eyes clear and focused, studied the crumpled map he had bought with the last of his own money before they left. He traced a line with his finger, his brow furrowed in concentration. \"There's a main road about two miles east of here,\" he said, his voice a low rumble in the cold air. \"Goes all the way to Aberdeen. If we can get a ride on that, we'll be there by nightfall.\" He folded the map and looked at Peter, a silent question in his eyes. *Are you ready?* Peter simply nodded, pulling his thin coat tighter around him, and they set off, their breath pluming in front of them as they walked into the rising sun.\n\nThe walk was harder than Peter had imagined. The road was a muddy track, and the two miles felt more like ten, his city-softened muscles protesting with every step. But the landscape was a constant, unfolding miracle that distracted him from the ache in his legs. He saw hills that were the colour of old tweed, swaths of dark, brooding forest, and burns that chattered over stones, the water a startling, clear amber. He was seeing the country that Ewan had spoken of, the world that had shaped him. He watched Ewan stride ahead, his long-legged gait eating up the ground, his posture relaxed and confident. Here, Ewan was not the furtive, watchful man of the Gallowgate; he was a native, his senses attuned to the wind and the sky. He pointed out the distant shape of a buzzard circling high above, identified the tracks of a fox in the mud, and named the trees that clustered in the hollows. It was a language Peter didn't speak, but he listened with a hungry intensity, feeling his understanding of Ewan deepening with every shared observation. The pine-scented man from the tenement was finally in his forest, and Peter was seeing him whole for the first time.\n\nThey reached the main road, a wider, busier artery, and the waiting began again. This time, it was a lorry hauling livestock, the air around it thick with the smell of the animals and the road. The driver was a wiry, older man with a suspicious squint who barely spoke, but he was heading to Aberdeen and, for the price of one of Peter\u2019s last few shillings, he grunted and nodded them into the cab. The journey was loud and rattling, the cab filled with the driver\u2019s tuneless whistling and the constant, mournful complaints of the sheep in the back. The driver\u2019s silence was more unnerving than the last one\u2019s garrulousness; his eyes kept flicking to them in the rearview mirror, a silent, ongoing assessment. Peter sat rigidly, hyper-aware of his hand resting on the seat close to Ewan\u2019s, conscious of the easy way Ewan leaned his shoulder against the cab door. He felt the old city fear prickle at him, the ingrained habit of hiding. But Ewan seemed oblivious. He stared out at the passing landscape, a calm, proprietary look on his face, as if he owned every hill and river they passed. When the driver finally dropped them at a desolate roundabout on the outskirts of Aberdeen, Peter felt a wave of relief so strong his knees almost buckled as he jumped down from the cab.\n\nAberdeen was a shock. It was a city, but a city made of granite, not soot-stained sandstone. The buildings were grey and glittering, hard-edged and severe under a sky that was scoured clean by a relentless wind blowing in from the North Sea. The air tasted of salt and fish, a stark, bracing contrast to Glasgow\u2019s thick, industrial fug. They were exhausted, bone-weary and hungry, the last of their money having gone to the lorry driver. The reality of their situation hit Peter with renewed force. They had made it, but they had arrived with nothing but the clothes on their backs, a tin trunk, and the name of a timber plantation somewhere up the coast. The brief euphoria of the journey gave way to the cold, hard facts of survival. He saw a baker\u2019s shop, its window piled high with golden rolls and pastries, and his stomach cramped with a hunger so sharp it was almost a pain. He looked at Ewan, a question and a flicker of his old panic in his eyes. Ewan followed his gaze to the bakery, and his jaw tightened. \"Cal's place is another six miles up the coast,\" he said, his voice low. \"We walk. We'll be there before it's fully dark.\" He shouldered the strap of his satchel, his expression grim. \"No more stopping. We get there.\" There was no choice. They turned their backs on the city\u2019s tantalising warmth and started the long walk north, the roar of the unseen sea growing louder with every step.\n\nThe final six miles were a pilgrimage. The road clung to the coastline, a narrow track with the furious, grey sea on one side and a rising wall of dark, dense forest on the other. The wind was a physical force, tearing at their clothes and trying to push them from the path. It carried the scream of gulls and the deep, percussive boom of waves crashing against rocks below. This was a different world entirely, a place of raw, elemental power that made the city\u2019s dangers seem small and petty. Peter leaned into the wind, his head down, his body a single, aching protest. He was running on nothing but fumes and the sheer, stubborn refusal to be the one who fell behind. He focused on the steady rhythm of Ewan\u2019s boots on the gravel in front of him, using it as a metronome to drive his own exhausted legs forward. Just as he felt he could not take another step, Ewan stopped. He had paused at a gap in the stone wall, his hand resting on the top stone, his gaze fixed on the land that sloped down towards the sea. Peter came to a halt beside him, panting, and followed his gaze.\n\nBelow them, stretching for as far as the eye could see, was the forest. It was a vast, dark green ocean of pine trees, their ranks marching down the rugged hillsides right to the edge of the cliffs, where the sea gnawed at the land. The sheer scale of it was breathtaking. Through the dense canopy, Peter could see cleared tracks and the distant, glinting roofs of a few low buildings clustered in a hollow near the shore. A plume of woodsmoke rose from a chimney, a thin, vertical line of grey against the deep green, a sign of life in the immense wilderness. The air was thick with the scent Ewan had always carried with him, a powerful, intoxicating perfume of pine resin, salt, and damp earth. This was it. This was the place from the stories, the source of the carved birds, the heart of Ewan\u2019s secret world. It was wilder, bigger, and more intimidating than anything Peter could have imagined. Ewan turned to him, his face weathered by the wind, his eyes alight with a fierce, proprietary pride. \"Well,\" he said, his voice almost carried away by the wind. \"This is it, Peter. This is the garden.\" Peter looked from the vast, roaring sea to the endless, whispering forest, then back to the man standing beside him. He was exhausted, hungry, and had not a penny to his name. But as he stood there, with the wooden wren safe in his pocket and Ewan's solid presence beside him, he felt not fear, but a quiet, trembling sense of arrival. He had walked off the edge of his old map and, impossibly, had found his way home."

                                        "text": "The descent from the road was a journey into another element. The wind that had scoured the cliffs above softened to a soughing whisper as they entered the shelter of the pines. The path was a treacherous track of slick, dark earth and tangled roots, and Peter, clumsy with exhaustion, stumbled several times, his hands brushing against bark that was rough and sticky with resin. The air grew thick and cool, heavy with the powerful, cathedral-like scent of a million pine needles, a scent so pure and overwhelming it seemed to scour the last of the city\u2019s pollution from his lungs. The roar of the sea faded, replaced by the creak and groan of the trees, the distant chatter of a hidden burn, and the soft crunch of their own boots on the forest floor. Peter watched Ewan move ahead of him, and it was like watching a man step back into his own skin. The last vestiges of the city\u2019s coiled tension fell away from his shoulders. He moved with an easy, silent grace, his head up, reading the signs of the forest as easily as Peter would read a printed page. He belonged here, and the rightness of it was as absolute and undeniable as the towering trees around them.\n\nThe settlement appeared suddenly in a wide clearing, a small cluster of rugged, functional buildings that seemed to have grown from the earth itself. There were long, low bunkhouses built from rough-hewn logs, a larger structure from which the scent of cooking food emanated, and an open-sided workshop where the air was hazy with sawdust and the clean, sharp smell of freshly cut wood. A few men, their faces weathered and bearded, their clothes stained with sweat and resin, stopped what they were doing to watch their approach. Their stillness was unnerving, their gazes direct and assessing, utterly different from the furtive, sideways glances of the Gallowgate. They looked at Ewan, and a flicker of recognition, of surprise, passed among them. They looked at Peter, and their faces were blank, unreadable masks. There was no welcome here, but no immediate hostility either; just the patient, watchful curiosity of men who lived by their own rules in a world far removed from any Peter had ever known.\n\nA man emerged from the largest cabin, wiping his hands on a greasy rag tucked into his belt. He was built on the same generous scale as Ewan, with the same broad shoulders, but where Ewan was a wanderer, this man was an anchor. His hair was a darker shade of brown, his face leaner, carved by wind and work into something harder and more severe. He stopped dead when he saw them, the rag in his hands stilled. For a long moment, the two brothers just looked at each other across the clearing, the twenty yards between them filled with years of unspoken history. \"Thought a bad penny always turned up,\" the man said, his voice a low, gravelly rumble that was an echo of Ewan\u2019s own. Ewan\u2019s mouth quirked into a ghost of his lopsided smile. \"Only when it's spent, Cal,\" he replied. He took the last few steps forward and gestured with his head towards Peter, who had come to a halt a few feet behind him, feeling intensely out of place. \"This is Peter,\" Ewan said, the introduction simple, declarative. \"He\u2019s with me.\"\n\nCal\u2019s eyes, a paler, flintier grey than Ewan's, shifted to Peter. He subjected him to a long, slow appraisal that travelled from his worn-out city boots to his pale, exhausted face and back again. It was not an unkind look, but it was utterly devoid of sentiment. It was the look a man gives a piece of timber to judge its strength, or the sky to judge the coming weather. Peter felt himself being weighed and measured, and found wanting. He stood his ground, his chin up, his hand unconsciously checking for the small, hard shape of the wooden wren in his pocket. The silence stretched, thick and uncomfortable. Finally, Cal\u2019s gaze moved back to Ewan, and a silent, lightning-fast conversation seemed to pass between them, an exchange of questions and answers that needed no words. At last, Cal gave a short, sharp nod, his judgment made. \"He looks half-dead from the cold,\" he said, his voice flat. \"Both of you. Get inside. Annie\u2019s made stew.\" He turned his back on them without another word and strode back towards the cabin, the dismissal and the invitation delivered in the same brusque, practical gesture.\n\nThe inside of the cookhouse was a haven of warmth and light. A huge, cast-iron stove dominated one wall, radiating a heat that felt like a physical blessing, and the air was thick with the rich, savoury smell of roasting meat and onions. A long, scarred wooden table, big enough to seat twenty men, ran down the centre of the room. A stout, grey-haired woman with kind eyes and flour on her forearms\u2014Annie, Peter presumed\u2014nodded at them as Cal ladled two deep bowls of stew from a cavernous pot. They sat at the end of the long table, and Peter ate with a ravenous, desperate speed, the thick, hot stew a miracle in his throat. It was simple food, just meat and barley and root vegetables, but it was the most delicious thing he had ever tasted. The warmth spread through him, chasing out the last of the cold, and with it, a wave of exhaustion so profound it was all he could do to keep his head from falling forward into the empty bowl. He had made it. They had made it. The sheer, impossible reality of it was as overwhelming as the food and the heat.\n\nAfter the bowls were empty, Cal sat down opposite them with a mug of black, steaming tea. He looked at Ewan, his expression less guarded now that the duties of a host had been fulfilled. \"So,\" he began, his voice low. \"The city finally spit you out?\" Ewan leaned back, stretching his long legs under the table. He didn't recount the fever, or the hiding, or the desperate flight. He distilled the entire complex tragedy into a few, spare words. \"The work dried up,\" he said. \"It was time for a change of air.\" Cal nodded slowly, accepting the edited version. He knew his brother. He didn't need the details, only the truth that lay beneath them. He took a long sip of his tea, his flinty eyes moving to Peter once more. \"We can always use another pair of hands, if he's not afraid of the work. There's an empty bunk in the east cabin. You can share it.\" He said it casually, as if it were the most natural thing in the world. \"Sawmill starts at six. Can you handle an axe, Peter?\" The direct question, the casual offer of a shared space, a shared life, all delivered in the same practical, no-nonsense tone. Peter looked at Ewan, who gave him a barely perceptible nod, and then he met Cal\u2019s gaze directly. \"I can learn,\" he said, his voice hoarse but steady. And with that simple exchange, the final brick of their new life clicked into place."

                                        "text": "Cal led them from the cookhouse into the biting night air. The sudden cold was a shock after the fug of the stove, and Peter drew his thin coat tighter, the warmth of the stew a fading memory in his belly. The stars overhead were a brilliant, scattered dust of ice, a sight so vast and clear it made him feel dizzy. Their destination was a long, low building identical to the others, its log walls dark against the frosted ground. Cal pushed open the heavy plank door, and a wall of scent hit them: the dense, animal smell of sleeping men, of damp wool, sawdust, and the sharp, clean bite of pine sap that seemed to have permeated the very wood of the structure. The interior was a cavern of shadows, a single lantern at the far end casting long, dancing shapes. A row of rough-hewn bunk beds lined each wall, each a small territory of rumpled blankets and scant possessions. A chorus of snores and heavy breathing rose and fell in the gloom. It was a space stripped of all privacy, a communal den built for the sole purpose of rest after labour.\n\n\"Bunk in the far corner's free,\" Cal said, his voice a low rumble that didn't disturb the sleeping men. \"It's wider. Should fit the two of you.\" He turned to leave, then paused, his hand on the door. \"The bell rings at five. Breakfast is at half-past. Sawmill starts at six. Don't be late.\" Then he was gone, pulling the door shut behind him, leaving them standing in the near-darkness, the casual weight of his words settling around Peter like a heavy blanket. *Should fit the two of you.* It wasn't a question or a judgment. It was a simple, practical statement of fact, as mundane as the starting time for the sawmill. There was one empty bunk and two men. The solution was obvious. In this world, driven by the hard logic of work and weather, their secret was not a secret at all, but a simple matter of logistics. A wave of relief so profound it felt like a physical impact washed over Peter, and for a moment he had to steady himself against the central beam, the sheer, unassuming acceptance of it all more disarming than any shouted accusation could ever have been.\n\nThey found the bunk in the corner, a wide platform with a mattress stuffed thick with straw that rustled as Ewan threw their satchels onto it. Cal had left two coarse, heavy wool blankets folded at the foot. As they stripped off their damp outer layers in the frigid air, the momentousness of the simple act struck Peter with full force. They were not hiding in the dark, stealing a moment of desperate intimacy. They were simply two men preparing for bed at the end of a long day, their place in this small, rough world sanctioned and defined. When they finally slid under the blankets, the shared space felt both impossibly vast and deeply comforting. The straw-filled mattress was lumpy, the blankets smelled faintly of sheep, but the solid, radiating warmth of Ewan\u2019s body next to his was the most luxurious thing Peter had ever felt. He curled on his side, his back pressed against Ewan\u2019s chest, and felt an arm slide around his waist, pulling him close. Exhaustion, deep and absolute, claimed him instantly. He fell into a profound, dreamless sleep, anchored by the weight of the man beside him and the symphony of the forest outside\u2014the whisper of wind in the pines and the distant, rhythmic roar of the sea.\n\nThe bell was a brutal, jarring clang that shattered the darkness. For a confused second, Peter thought it was the shriek of metal from the shipyard, a sound from a past life. Then the cold hit him, and the chorus of groans and curses from the other men as they stirred from their bunks. His body was a single, unified protest of aches. Muscles he hadn't known he possessed screamed in rebellion from the long walk. Ewan was already moving, swinging his legs out of the bunk with an economy of motion that spoke of long familiarity with such mornings. He saw Peter grimacing as he tried to sit up and tossed him a thick, felted wool shirt. \"Put this on,\" he said, his voice a low rasp. \"It gets colder before the sun is properly up. And your city boots won't last a day. I'll find you a spare pair.\" The advice was practical, devoid of sentiment, but it was a lifeline. In the dim, smoky light of the newly-lit lanterns, Peter watched the other men pull on heavy boots and thick trousers, their movements slow and deliberate, conserving energy for the day ahead. This was his new life: a bell in the dark, a borrowed shirt, and a day of labour he was utterly unprepared for.\n\nCal was true to his word. After a quick, silent breakfast of thick, hot porridge and black tea, he led Peter not to the sawmill, but to the edge of the clearing where a dozen enormous pine trees lay like felled giants. He handed Peter a felling axe, its handle worn smooth with use, its head a heavy, wicked-looking wedge of steel. \"The yard work made your arms strong, but this is different,\" Cal said, his tone that of a teacher, not a tyrant. \"It's about rhythm, not brute force. Your job is limbing. Strip every branch from these trunks, clean to the wood. Stack the branches by size. The small stuff for Annie's stove, the thick stuff for the charcoal kilns. Watch the others. And for God's sake, mind your footing. This ground is treacherous.\" He demonstrated a single, perfect swing, the axe head biting deep into the base of a thick branch, shearing it off with a sharp crack. The motion was fluid, powerful, and deceptively easy. Then he left Peter alone with a fallen tree that looked as long as a Gallowgate street.\n\nThe first hour was a lesson in humility. The axe felt like a clumsy, unwieldy club in Peter\u2019s hands. His swings were awkward, either glancing off the resilient branches or biting in too deep, jarring his arms and shoulders with every mistimed blow. The shipyard had been about noise and fire, the taming of molten metal in a confined, deafening space. This was a battle against something organic and obstinate, fought in the cold, open air. The other men worked around him, their movements a blur of terrifying efficiency. He could feel their silent judgment, the occasional pause in their own work to watch the clumsy efforts of the newcomer. Once, he lost his grip entirely, the axe flying from his hands and burying itself in the soft earth a few feet away. A low chuckle rippled from a nearby pair of workers, and the shame was a hot, stinging flush on his cold cheeks. He wanted the ground to swallow him. But then he saw Ewan, working on a parallel tree, who caught his eye and gave a slight, almost imperceptible shake of his head, a silent command: *Ignore them. Keep going.* Peter retrieved the axe, his jaw set in a hard line, and forced himself to focus, not on the men, but on the tree, on the memory of Cal\u2019s perfect, fluid swing.\n\nAt mid-day, Annie appeared with a cart, dispensing thick sandwiches of bread and cold meat, and a huge metal churn of hot, sweet tea. The men dropped their tools and gathered, eating quickly and talking in low, guttural bursts about timber yields and a predicted change in the weather. Peter found a spot on a log beside Ewan, his hands so stiff and raw he could barely hold his sandwich. He had blisters forming on both palms, angry red welts that promised a world of pain to come. Ewan took one of his hands, turning it over to inspect the damage with a practiced eye. \"You're gripping too tight,\" he said, his voice quiet, for Peter\u2019s ears only. \"You're fighting the axe. Let its weight do the work for you. Guide it, don't force it.\" He pulled a small tin of foul-smelling, greenish salve from his pocket\u2014the same one he'd used on his own hands\u2014and wordlessly began to rub it into Peter\u2019s raw palms. The gesture was so open, so un-selfconscious, that none of the other men paid it the slightest attention. It was simply one man tending to another, a practical act in a world governed by practicality.\n\nBy the time the bell rang to signal the end of the day, Peter felt a weariness so profound it was almost a spiritual state. His entire body was a single, throbbing ache. He trudged back to the bunkhouse in a stupor, his footsteps heavy and leaden. The simple acts of pulling off his new, heavy boots and washing his face in a basin of icy water required a monumental effort of will. But as he sat in the cookhouse that evening, a bowl of rich, thick soup warming his hands and the scent of woodsmoke in his hair, a new feeling began to surface beneath the exhaustion. It was a feeling of deep, bone-felt satisfaction. He had survived. He had faced the forest, the work, and the silent judgment of the men, and he had not broken. Later, lying in their bunk in the warm darkness, the aches in his body a dull, rhythmic thrum, Ewan\u2019s arm came around him. \"You did well today,\" Ewan murmured into his hair, his voice thick with sleep. \"You didn't quit.\" Peter was too tired to form a reply. He simply leaned back into the solid warmth of Ewan's body, his mind empty, his body spent. He had endured his first day in the garden, and as he drifted into a heavy, healing sleep, he knew, with a certainty that settled deep in his marrow, that he had finally, truly, begun to put down roots."

                                        "text": "The days that followed fell into a brutal, simple rhythm, governed by the clang of the bell and the slow, circling passage of the sun above the pines. Each morning, Peter woke in the warm haven of the bunk to a body that screamed a litany of new and inventive pains. The dull ache of the first day had sharpened into a fierce, articulate agony in his shoulders, his lower back, and most of all, his hands. The blisters had broken, leaving raw, weeping patches of skin on his palms that seared with pain at the slightest touch. Getting dressed was an ordeal of stiff, protesting limbs, and the walk to the cookhouse a slow, hobbling procession. The romance of their escape had been burned away by the harsh, unyielding reality of the work, leaving only the grim necessity of survival. He saw the doubt in the eyes of the other men, a silent wager on how long the city boy would last before he broke.\n\nOut in the forest clearing, the axe was an instrument of torture. Every swing sent a shockwave of pain from his raw hands up his arms. His initial attempts to replicate Cal\u2019s effortless grace were clumsy, pathetic failures. He was fighting a war on two fronts: one against the stubborn resilience of the pine branches, the other against the mutiny of his own body. He felt a rising tide of despair, a frustration so keen it brought hot tears to his eyes, which he angrily blinked away before anyone could see. He was a fraud, a boy who read about heroes, utterly useless when faced with the simple, honest challenge of a felled tree. He was just another piece of city grime that had washed up on their shore, and soon the tide of the work would drag him back out to sea.\n\nThe change came not as a sudden epiphany, but as a slow, painful surrender. Halfway through the third morning, his hands on fire, his back a knot of searing pain, he simply stopped. He leaned against the rough bark of the trunk, the axe hanging limply from his fingers, and closed his eyes, breathing in the cold, resinous air. He remembered Ewan's quiet words by the log pile: *Guide it, don't force it.* He had been trying to conquer the tree, to impose his will upon it through sheer, desperate effort. He opened his eyes, looked at the axe, and then at the smooth, flowing grain of the wood. He took a breath, adjusted his grip as Ewan had shown him, relaxing his fingers, and lifted the axe. This time, he didn't aim for a powerful, shattering blow. He aimed for a single point, letting the heavy head of the axe fall in a natural arc, his body moving with it, not against it. The blade hit with a clean, satisfying *thwack*, shearing a thick branch away with a sound like a breaking bone. There was no jarring shock, only a smooth transfer of energy, a feeling of rightness that was as surprising as it was profound. He did it again, and then again, slowly finding the rhythm, the secret cadence of the work.\n\nFrom that moment on, the days began to transform. The work was still brutally hard, the exhaustion at the end of each day absolute, but the sharp edges of his despair began to wear away. He learned to read the language of the wood, to see the lines of force in a branch, to anticipate how it would split. The axe, once an enemy, became a familiar extension of his own arms, its weight a comfort, its worn handle a familiar landscape beneath his slowly toughening hands. His body, in turn, began its own slow transformation. The soft, pale skin of his palms thickened into a protective layer of callus. The undefined muscles of his arms and back hardened into taut, functional cords. He grew leaner, harder, the last of the city\u2019s pallor scoured from his face by the wind and the sun. He was being remade by the forest, stripped down to his essential self and rebuilt with stronger materials. The other men, who had initially watched him with a mixture of pity and contempt, began to nod at him in the mornings, their greetings gruff but genuine. One afternoon, an older man named Findlay, a giant with a beard like a tangled bird's nest, paused by his tree. \"You're holding the handle wrong for that angle, lad,\" he grunted, and spent two minutes demonstrating a different grip that saved Peter\u2019s back from a world of unnecessary strain. The small, freely-given lesson was a quiet act of acceptance, an acknowledgment that he was no longer a guest, but part of the crew.\n\nTheir evenings in the bunkhouse became the anchor of his new life. The small, shared bunk in the corner was a world unto itself, a private island in the public sea of the sleeping quarters. After the exhaustion of the day, there was little energy for long conversations. Their intimacy was a thing of quiet, practical gestures. It was Ewan checking Peter\u2019s hands each night, his rough fingers surprisingly gentle as he applied the pungent green salve to the new calluses. It was Peter saving a portion of his own tea for Ewan when he was late back from a task for Cal. It was the simple, unspoken comfort of lying in the dark, their tired bodies pressed together, a silent bulwark against the cold and the immense, wild darkness outside. Sometimes, when the ache in his muscles was too loud to allow for immediate sleep, Peter would lie awake and watch the slow, rhythmic rise and fall of Ewan\u2019s chest, and a feeling of profound, quiet gratitude would wash over him. He had followed this man from a world of shadows and whispers into a world of hard truths and clean, sharp air, and in doing so, he had found not just a refuge, but a foundation.\n\nOne evening, a week into his new life, as Ewan was tending to a small cut on Peter\u2019s forearm, a splinter from a rogue branch, Peter looked down at his own hands. They were almost unrecognizable. They were stained with pine tar, criss-crossed with small, healing scratches, the nails permanently grimed with earth. They were not the hands of a boy who turned the delicate pages of a book; they were the hands of a man who worked. He thought of the Peter in Glasgow, the lonely, fearful observer who lived vicariously through the stories of others, and he felt a vast, unbridgeable distance from that person. The fear that had been the constant background noise of his life had been replaced by the honest ache of labour, the anxiety of survival replaced by the simple, driving need to meet the bell in the morning. He flexed his fingers, feeling the pull of new muscle, the toughness of his own skin. He was still tired, still sore, but he was no longer fragile. The garden, he realized, was not just the forest around him. It was the new ground he was claiming inside himself, a place where he was learning not just to survive, but to grow."

It simply changed its nature, transforming from the sharp, insistent cry of abused muscles into a dull, thrumming baseline, the familiar song of his own body\u2019s strength. A month after their arrival, Peter moved through the forest with a competence that astonished him. The axe was no longer a foreign object but a part of him, its rhythm ingrained in his sinews. He worked alongside Findlay, the old giant, their two axes rising and falling in a steady, hypnotic cadence, a percussive duet that was their only necessary conversation. He learned to feel the weather in the ache of his joints, to gauge the time by the slant of the sun through the high canopy, to find a deep, almost spiritual satisfaction in the neat, orderly stacks of timber he left in his wake. The city boy was a ghost, a half-remembered story he might have read about someone else. The man who took his place was leaner, quieter, and as tough and resilient as the roots that snaked beneath his feet.\n\nThe routine was the bedrock of their lives, a predictable cycle of work, food, and sleep that left little room for uncertainty. But one evening, as the bell\u2019s final clang echoed through the trees, Ewan broke the pattern. As the other men trudged wearily towards the promise of Annie\u2019s stew, he caught Peter\u2019s arm, his grip firm. \"Not yet,\" he said, his voice low. \"Walk with me.\" There was no command in his tone, only an invitation, a quiet offering of something outside the routine. Peter, his own weariness momentarily forgotten, simply nodded. The prospect of a few stolen minutes alone with Ewan, away from the communal warmth and noise of the cookhouse, was a luxury more tempting than any hot meal.\n\nEwan led him away from the main camp, following a narrow, winding deer-track that Peter had never taken before. The forest was a different creature in the gloaming. The shadows between the trees deepened from grey to a rich, velvety black, and the air grew still and cold, holding the scent of damp moss and decaying leaves. The boisterous sounds of the camp faded behind them, replaced by the deep, resonant silence of the woods, a silence punctuated by the snap of a twig underfoot or the distant, mournful hoot of an early-rising owl. They walked without speaking, their shoulders occasionally brushing, the shared silence as comfortable and familiar as the blankets on their bunk. After a ten-minute walk, the trees began to thin, and the roar of the sea, which was a constant, muted background hum at the camp, grew louder, more immediate. They emerged from the tree line onto a high, windswept headland of granite and tough, salt-strafed grass.\n\nBelow them, the North Sea was a vast, turbulent expanse of churning pewter, its white-crested waves crashing against the black, jagged rocks at the base of the cliffs with a force that seemed to shake the very ground they stood on. The sky was a masterpiece of bruised purple and faded rose, the last light of the sun bleeding away at the far horizon. The wind was a wild, untamed thing here, tearing at their clothes and whipping their hair across their faces. They found shelter in the lee of a monolithic granite boulder, a natural wall that shielded them from the worst of the gale. Ewan cupped his hands against the wind, his back to Peter, and with a few tries, managed to light one of their thinly-rolled cigarettes. He took a long drag, the red tip glowing brightly in the deepening twilight, and then passed it to Peter. The smoke, harsh and familiar, was a small, warm anchor in the immensity of the scene.\n\nPeter took a slow, deep lungful, the smoke momentarily steadying him against the breathtaking scale of the view. He looked down at his hand holding the cigarette, at the hard-earned calluses, the ingrained dirt, the network of fine, silvery scars. \"These don't feel like my hands anymore,\" he said, the words snatched from his lips by the wind. \"I look at them, and I don't recognise the person they belong to. He knows how to use an axe. He isn't afraid of the cold. He isn't\u2026 afraid.\" He looked at Ewan, whose face was a mask of shadows, only his eyes catching the last of the light. \"I spent my whole life in Glasgow being afraid. Of the noise, of the silence, of what people would think, of what I was. I didn't even realise how much space it took up inside me until it was gone.\"\n\nEwan was quiet for a long time, watching the endless, rhythmic assault of the waves on the shore below. He took the cigarette back from Peter, his fingers brushing against Peter's. \"I was afraid, too,\" he confessed, his voice so low Peter had to lean in to hear it over the wind. \"When we first got here. I watched you with that axe, and you looked like a sapling in a storm. I thought\u2026 I thought this place was going to break you.\" He turned to face Peter, his gaze intense, stripped of all pretence. \"This forest, this coast\u2026 it\u2019s the only place I ever felt I belonged. I brought you here, into the one part of the world that was truly mine, and I was terrified it wouldn't be big enough for you. That it would chew you up and spit you out, and I'd be alone in it again.\" It was the most vulnerable Peter had ever seen him, a confession that laid bare the deep fear of loss that underpinned his quiet strength.\n\nThis was a truth far deeper than any whispered endearment in the dark of their bunk. It was the bedrock on which their shared life was built. Peter reached out, not with the hesitant touch of the boy in the tenement, but with the steady confidence of the man he was becoming. He took Ewan\u2019s hand, lacing his calloused fingers through Ewan\u2019s own. It was a meeting of equals, a joining of two people who had been remade, both by their shared past and by this hard, beautiful place. It was a silent, binding promise. As they stood there, hands clasped, a new sound joined the roar of the sea\u2014a faint, high-pitched, lonely cry from high above. Ewan tilted his head, his gaze sweeping the darkening sky. He pointed. \"Look.\" A long, wavering V-formation of geese was etched against the last vestiges of colour in the sky, heading resolutely south. \"They're leaving,\" Ewan said, his voice quiet, matter-of-fact. \"Winter's coming.\" The sight was beautiful and profoundly desolate, a stark reminder that their small, hard-won sanctuary was about to be tested by a force far greater than any foreman or suspicious landlady.\n\nThey walked back to the camp in a deep, companionable silence, the shared knowledge of the coming challenge hanging between them not as a threat, but as the next chapter they would face together. The cookhouse was a beacon of light and warmth, the boisterous shouts and laughter of the men a welcome shield against the vast, cold darkness outside. Later, as they lay in their bunk, the sounds of the other men\u2019s sleep a familiar chorus around them, Peter felt the press of the wind against the log walls, a low, mournful howl that promised colder nights to come. But curled against Ewan\u2019s back, feeling the steady, slow rhythm of his breathing, he felt no fear. The city had been a cage that kept the world out. This place was a wilderness that invited the world in, demanding strength and resilience in return. They had survived the fall; now they would endure the winter. Together. The garden was being prepared for a long, deep sleep, and they would guard its roots until the spring."

                                        "text": "The winter did not arrive with the gentle grace of a dusting on a postcard. It descended like a siege. For days, the sky had been a low, oppressive ceiling of bruised, colourless cloud, and the wind, which had been their constant companion on the cliffs, fell away into an unnerving, absolute stillness. The sea\u2019s roar became a muffled, distant thunder, as if the world were holding its breath. The men in the camp grew quiet, their usual boisterous energy replaced by a watchful, introspective mood. They checked the seals on the windows, stacked firewood higher against the bunkhouse walls, and oiled their tools with a grim, focused industry. They were shoring up the ramparts against a known and respected enemy. Then, one afternoon as the light was already beginning to fail, it began. The first flakes were not small and delicate, but large and wet, like scraps of sodden linen falling from the grey sky. They melted as they hit the ground, turning the clearing into a dark, muddy slurry. But they did not stop. As the last of the twilight vanished, the temperature plummeted, and the wet flakes became a hard, dry, silent torrent of white.\n\nPeter stood at the small, grimy window of the bunkhouse, watching the world disappear. The familiar shapes of the cookhouse and the workshop blurred, softened, and then were erased completely, swallowed by the swirling, hypnotic curtain of snow. The noise of the camp vanished, the world outside muffled into a profound, humming silence that was more absolute than anything he had ever experienced. The only sounds were the whisper of the snow against the glass and the low crackle of the stove inside, a sound that seemed impossibly fragile against the immense, silent power of the storm. The other men, finished with their evening meal, settled into the long night. Some played cards by the weak light of a lantern, their faces grimly focused. Others sat mending torn clothes or sharpening their axes, their movements economical and meditative. An air of quiet endurance filled the room. This was not a novelty; it was a known hardship to be weathered. Peter felt a hand on his shoulder and turned to see Ewan standing behind him, two steaming mugs of tea in his hands. Ewan didn't speak, just nodded towards the window, his expression a mixture of respect and grim resignation for the elemental force outside. They stood side-by-side, watching the blizzard rage, two silent sentinels guarding the small, warm pocket of life they had found against the vast, indifferent white of the world.\n\nThe morning bell was a muffled, distant clang, as if ringing from another country. When Cal heaved open the bunkhouse door, it was to a world remade, a landscape of impossible, sculptural beauty and stark, new dangers. The snow had stopped, leaving behind a deep, pristine blanket of white that had buried every familiar contour of the clearing. It lay in heavy, precarious drifts against the cabins and had transformed the felled logs and piles of branches into strange, organic mounds. The air was eye-wateringly cold and so still that the smoke from the cookhouse chimney rose in a perfectly straight, grey column against a sky of pale, washed-out blue. The beauty of it was breathtaking, an artist\u2019s dream of pure form and light, but it was a hostile beauty. Every step was a struggle through thigh-deep powder. Every tool handle was a shock of vicious, biting cold. The trees in the forest were no longer just trees; they were laden with a crushing weight of snow, their branches bowed, creaking and groaning under the strain, each one a potential \"widow-maker,\" ready to snap and fall without warning. The work had to continue, but the rules of engagement had changed completely.\n\nFor Peter, the first days after the snowfall were the hardest he had yet endured. The physical exertion of simply moving through the deep snow was exhausting, and the cold was a relentless, insidious enemy. It found its way through the layers of his woollen clothes, numbing his fingers and toes until they were clumsy, aching lumps. The sweat from his labour would freeze against his skin, creating a miserable, clammy chill that no amount of work could seem to burn away. He learned the hard way about the dangers of snow-blindness from the relentless glare off the white ground, and about the precariousness of his footing on hidden patches of ice. But he also learned the winter skills of the other men. He learned from Findlay how to wrap his boots in burlap for better grip, and from Cal he learned the art of looking up, of reading the stress on a branch and knowing which trees to give a wide berth. He learned to work in a new way, with a heightened awareness, his senses not dulled by the cold but sharpened by the constant, low-level threat of it. He was no longer just learning to work with wood; he was learning to work with winter.\n\nThe evenings became longer, darker, and more vital. The bunkhouse, once just a place to sleep, transformed into the heart of their small, isolated community. With the darkness falling by mid-afternoon, the men would gather around the pot-bellied stove, its heat a sacred circle in the freezing room. This was the time for stories. Men who were silent and stoic all day would open up in the warm, smoky gloom, their voices low as they spun tales of legendary storms, of close calls with death in the woods, of strange lights seen over the sea. Findlay, it turned in, had a fine, rumbling singing voice, and he would lead them in mournful ballads of lost love and shipwrecks, their voices a rough but moving chorus against the howl of the wind outside. In these moments, Peter felt the threads of community being woven tight around him. He was no longer the outsider, but a part of this collective, a keeper of the same fire. And later, in the absolute privacy of their shared bunk, burrowed deep under the heavy blankets, he would feel Ewan's cold feet seeking out the warmth of his own, and Ewan\u2019s arms would wrap around him, a solid, living shield against the cold. In the profound, shared darkness, they would talk in whispers, their breath clouding in the tiny space between their faces, reaffirming their own small, tenacious existence against the overwhelming power of the season.\n\nThe first real test came a week after the snow, on a day so cold the trees themselves seemed to groan in protest. They were working a steep, difficult slope, felling a stand of old, thick-girthed pines. The snow was particularly deep, concealing treacherous hollows and loose rocks. Peter was working beside Findlay, their axes rising and falling, their breathing a harsh, rhythmic rasp in the still air. A team further up the slope, including Ewan and Cal, was preparing to bring down a true giant, a tree that had stood for a century. The warning shouts went up\u2014\"Timber!\"\u2014and Peter and Findlay paused, moving back to what they thought was a safe distance, their eyes on the magnificent tree as it began its slow, majestic, terrifying fall. But something was wrong. Its descent was not clean. Weighed down by an immense, unbalanced load of snow on one side, it began to twist, its great trunk groaning in protest. It wasn't falling where it was supposed to. It was coming their way, a monstrous, unstoppable force, its massive branches sweeping a deadly arc through the smaller trees, sending a shower of splintered wood and ice through the air. Findlay, who had been standing a few feet from Peter, gave a shout of pure, primal alarm. He had been caught on the wrong side of a deep snowdrift, his path of retreat blocked. He was directly in the path of the falling giant."

                                        "text": "Time did not slow. It fractured. The world, which had been a steady rhythm of breath and axe-falls, shattered into a million sharp, chaotic fragments of sensory information. There was Findlay\u2019s face, his mouth open in a silent, terrified \u2018O\u2019, his eyes wide with the stark knowledge of his own imminent death. There was the sound, a horrifying, drawn-out scream of wood fibres tearing apart, a sound that went straight to the bone. There was the sight of the giant pine, impossibly vast, seeming to hang in the air for a terrible, eternal second before it began its inexorable, twisting descent. And there was the snow, the deep, treacherous snowdrift that held Findlay in place as surely as if he were manacled to the ground. Peter\u2019s mind was a blank, white void. The city boy, the boy who observed and feared and retreated, was gone, burned away in an instant of pure, animal instinct. His body moved, untethered from thought.\n\nHe launched himself forward, a desperate, lunging dive through the thigh-deep snow that felt like wading through thick, freezing treacle. Every step was a monumental effort, his lungs burning with the sudden, violent exertion. He heard shouts from the top of the slope, Ewan\u2019s voice, a raw, terrified cry of his own name, but it was a sound from another world, distant and meaningless. The only reality was the few feet of snow between him and Findlay, and the monstrous, roaring shadow that was swallowing the sky above them. He reached the old giant, his hands grabbing a fistful of Findlay\u2019s thick woollen jacket. There was no time for words, no time for anything but brute, desperate force. He planted his feet, digging for purchase he couldn\u2019t find, and shoved with every ounce of strength his remade body possessed. It was like trying to move a mountain. Findlay, frozen in terror, stumbled, his weight a dead, uncooperative anchor. \"Move!\" Peter screamed, the word a raw, guttural bark he didn\u2019t recognise as his own. He shoved again, a frantic, adrenaline-fuelled heave that sent them both staggering, falling sideways into the deep, soft powder of the snowdrift.\n\nThe world ended in a cataclysm of sound and fury. The roar of the falling tree was a physical force, a wave of displaced air that hit them like a solid object. The ground bucked and shuddered as the immense trunk impacted, a world-shattering *whump* that vibrated through Peter\u2019s teeth and bones. A storm of snow, splintered wood, and frozen earth erupted around them, a blinding, choking chaos. A branch, thick as a man\u2019s thigh, scythed through the air just inches above their heads with a sound like a tearing sheet, showering them with sharp splinters of bark and needles. Then, as suddenly as it had begun, there was a ringing, profound silence, broken only by the soft, settling sigh of displaced snow and the distant, panicked shouts of the other men. Peter lay half-buried in the snow, his face pressed into the cold, clean powder, his ears ringing, his mind a complete blank. He was alive. The thought was a small, flickering candle in the vast, dark emptiness of the shock.\n\nHe pushed himself up, his limbs trembling uncontrollably, a fine dusting of snow and pine needles clinging to his hair and clothes. The scene was one of utter devastation. The giant pine lay like a slain god, its massive trunk having carved a deep, raw wound in the earth, exactly where Findlay had been standing moments before. The air was thick with the powerful, funereal scent of crushed pine. A few feet away, Findlay was stirring, groaning, his face a mask of grey shock. He was trying to sit up, but one of his legs was trapped beneath a smaller, secondary branch that had snapped off in the fall, pinning him to the ground at an unnatural angle. Peter scrambled over to him, his hands patting him down, checking for injuries with a frantic urgency. \"Findlay? Are you alright? Talk to me!\" Findlay\u2019s eyes, clouded with pain, focused on Peter. \"My leg,\" he gasped, his voice thin and reedy. \"God, Peter\u2026 my leg.\" Just then, the rest of the crew arrived, crashing through the undergrowth, their faces pale with terror. Ewan was at the forefront, his eyes wild, scanning the wreckage until they locked on Peter, alive and moving. The relief that washed over his face was so profound it was almost a mask of pain. He stumbled the last few feet and grabbed Peter\u2019s arms, his grip bruising, his knuckles white. \"I thought\u2026\" he started, his voice a choked, broken thing. \"I saw you go for him. I thought you were both\u2026\" He couldn't finish, just pulled Peter into a fierce, desperate embrace that was less a hug and more an anchor, a frantic confirmation of life.\n\nThe moment was shattered by Cal\u2019s voice, sharp and commanding, cutting through the chaos. \"He's trapped. Ewan, get the big saw. The rest of you, clear this debris. Now!\" The men, shaken but professional, instantly fell into their roles. The shock was replaced by a grim, focused purpose. They worked with a swift, coordinated efficiency that was a testament to their long experience with the forest\u2019s dangers. Peter, released from Ewan\u2019s grip, found himself working alongside them, his own shock suppressed by the urgent need for action. He helped clear the smaller branches, his hands, clumsy and trembling a moment before, now finding a steady rhythm. They worked to free Findlay\u2019s leg, Cal directing the delicate operation with a calm authority, his face a grim, unreadable mask of responsibility. It took ten agonizing minutes to saw through the heavy branch and gently ease the old man free. His leg was a ruin, the bone clearly shattered below the knee, but he was alive. Cal fashioned a crude but effective splint from two straight branches and ripped strips of cloth from his own shirt, his movements quick and sure. The journey back to the camp was an arduous, silent procession. They made a makeshift stretcher from two poles and a stack of their own coats, and four of the strongest men, including Ewan, carried the injured man, their steps careful and slow through the deep snow. Peter walked alongside, carrying a handful of discarded axes, his mind still numb, the image of the falling tree replaying itself over and over behind his eyes. He had acted without thinking, a puppet pulled by some instinct he hadn\u2019t known he possessed. He had stared into the face of death, and he had not flinched. He did not feel like a hero. He felt hollowed out, scoured clean, a stranger to himself.\n\nThat evening, the bunkhouse was a place of subdued, quiet reverence. Findlay lay on his bunk, his face pale but his eyes clear, his leg immobilised. Annie had come from the cookhouse, bringing with her not just food, but laudanum for the pain and a quiet, maternal authority that soothed the raw edges of the men\u2019s nerves. A decision had been made: at first light, Cal and another man would take a sledge down to the nearest town to fetch the doctor. For now, all they could do was wait. The usual boisterous card games and storytelling were absent. The men sat quietly, smoking their pipes, the air thick with the unspoken acknowledgment of their shared mortality and their collective relief. As Peter sat on the edge of his own bunk, trying to coax feeling back into his numb hands, Cal came and stood before him. The big man looked down at him, his flinty eyes holding a new, unreadable light. \"That was a damn fool thing to do,\" he said, his voice a low rumble. He paused, then added, \"It was also the bravest damn thing I've ever seen.\" He clapped a heavy, calloused hand on Peter\u2019s shoulder, a gesture that was both a commendation and a benediction. \"You're one of us now, lad. For better or worse.\" He squeezed Peter's shoulder once, hard, and then walked away.\n\nLater, in the profound, shared darkness of their bunk, curled under the heavy blankets, Ewan\u2019s arm was not just a comfort, but a shield. He held Peter with a fierce, protective stillness, his body a solid line against Peter's back. For a long time, neither of them spoke. The events of the day lay between them, too large and raw for words. Finally, Ewan\u2019s voice came, a rough whisper in the dark. \"Don't you ever do that again.\" There was no anger in his voice, only the ragged, frayed edge of a terror he had been holding back all day. \"Don't you ever scare me like that again, Peter.\" Peter didn't reply. He simply reached back and took Ewan\u2019s hand, his newly calloused fingers lacing through Ewan's own. He held on tight, an anchor in the dark. He had faced the forest's fury and had not been found wanting. He had earned his place, not with the strength of his arms, but with the instinctive, unthinking loyalty of his heart. Winter had tested their small community, and they had held. He had been tested, and he had not broken. He was home."

The ringing of the bell seemed a violation of the profound quiet that had settled over the snow-bound clearing. In the bunkhouse, the men moved with a subdued gravity, the usual grumbled complaints and rough-housing absent. All eyes were on Cal and a wiry, taciturn man named Torquil as they made their preparations. They strapped snowshoes to their heavy boots and loaded a small, sturdy sledge with blankets, a flask of hot tea, and a bottle of whisky, provisions for a journey that was both a rescue mission and a gamble against the elements. The entire camp stood in the piercing cold to watch them depart, a silent, collective sending-off. There were no grand farewells, only a single, sharp nod from Cal before he and Torquil leaned into their harnesses and began the long, arduous trek towards the coast road, their dark figures shrinking against the vast, indifferent white until the forest swallowed them whole.\n\nThe work that day was different. The forest, which had begun to feel like a challenging but familiar partner, was once again an antagonist. The memory of the falling tree haunted the spaces between the pines, and every creak of a snow-laden branch was a fresh jolt of alarm. The men worked with a grim, sober focus, their movements more deliberate, their gazes constantly scanning the canopy above. The workload was heavier, the absence of three men\u2014Findlay, Cal, and Torquil\u2014a palpable gap in their ranks. Ewan, now the de facto leader, moved through the work teams with a quiet, anxious energy, his eyes everywhere at once. He assigned Peter to a task in a relatively clear, flat area, away from the treacherous slopes. It was the necessary work of splitting logs for the cookhouse stove, a job that was physically demanding but carried none of the immediate dangers of felling. Peter understood the unspoken motive behind the assignment. It was an act of protection, a manifestation of the terror that still lived behind Ewan\u2019s eyes. A part of him, the new, capable part, bristled at being handled so carefully, but he said nothing, seeing the raw fear that Ewan was trying to master. He picked up the heavy splitting maul and set to work, the rhythmic, percussive thud of splitting wood a steadying counterpoint to the anxious thrumming in his own chest.\n\nThe subtle shift in his own status was undeniable. He was no longer the apprentice, the outsider to be tolerated. He was Peter, the man who had dived into the path of death to save one of their own. The change was not in grand pronouncements, but in the small, almost imperceptible gestures that formed the currency of respect among these quiet men. As he worked, a man named Angus, who had been one of the most openly dismissive of the \"city boy\" in the early days, walked over, silently took Peter\u2019s axe, and spent a minute expertly honing its edge on a whetstone he produced from his pocket, before handing it back with a gruff, almost inaudible grunt. Later, during the mid-day break, as Peter sat alone on a log, nursing his still-sore hands, another man silently placed a second, thicker sandwich beside him. No words were exchanged, but the message was clear. He had paid a price, and in doing so, had earned his membership. He belonged not just to Ewan, but to the whole, ragged, hard-bitten family of the camp. It was a strange and unsettling feeling, this sense of belonging that had been forged in a moment of sheer, unthinking terror.\n\nEwan found him during that break, his face etched with the strain of command and a deeper, more personal worry. He sat beside Peter on the log, the silence stretching between them for a long minute before he spoke. \"My first thought this morning,\" Ewan said, his gaze fixed on the distant, snow-shrouded hills, \"was to tell you to stay in the cookhouse with Annie. To keep you out of the woods entirely.\" He let out a short, harsh breath. \"I don't think I've ever been more afraid in my life than I was yesterday, watching you run towards that tree.\" He finally turned to look at Peter, his peat-smoke eyes dark with the memory. \"But I couldn't. It wouldn't be right. You're not a guest here. You're a woodsman.\" Peter met his gaze, seeing the conflict raging within him\u2014the fierce, protective instinct warring with his respect for the man Peter was becoming. \"I'm not made of glass, Ewan,\" Peter said, his voice quiet but firm. Ewan\u2019s mouth twisted into a wry, sad smile. \"I know,\" he said, his voice rough with emotion. \"I know you're not. That's what scares me.\"\n\nLate in the afternoon, a shout went up from the man posted as a lookout. Two figures were emerging from the forest edge, pulling the sledge behind them. A third figure, small and dark-clad, walked beside them. The doctor. A wave of collective relief rippled through the clearing as the men abandoned their work and converged on the camp. Cal and Torquil looked utterly spent, their faces grey with exhaustion and rimmed with ice from their own breath. The doctor, a small, neat man with a clipped moustache and a face that seemed perpetually pinched against the cold, looked absurdly out of place, his black leather bag a strange, alien object in this world of wood and steel. He stamped the snow from his immaculate boots and disappeared into the bunkhouse where Findlay lay, his expression a mask of professional neutrality that offered neither hope nor despair. The men waited outside in the biting cold, a silent, anxious vigil, their rough camaraderie a solid, unspoken wall around their fallen comrade.\n\nPeter and Ewan stood together, slightly apart from the main group, the steam from their own breath mingling in the frigid air. Peter felt the camp\u2019s collective anxiety as a physical weight in his own chest. This was no longer just Findlay\u2019s fate; it was a communal burden. The life they had here was hard, but it was honest and self-contained. The doctor, with his bag and his city knowledge, was a necessary intrusion, a reminder of a world beyond the pines where bodies were more easily mended but lives were, perhaps, more easily broken. After what felt like an eternity, the bunkhouse door opened, and Cal emerged, his face grim, followed by the doctor, who was wiping his hands on a small, clean handkerchief. The men pressed forward, a silent, questioning mob. The doctor addressed them all, his voice crisp and clear, cutting through the cold air. \"It's a bad break. A spiral fracture of both the tibia and the fibula.\" The medical terms meant little to them, but the gravity of his tone was unmistakable. \"I've set it as best I can and given him a strong dose of laudanum. But he can't stay here. As soon as a path is cleared, he needs to be taken to the infirmary in Aberdeen. He won't be climbing any hills for a very long time. If ever.\"\n\nThe finality of the verdict settled over the clearing like a fresh fall of snow, cold and heavy. Findlay, a man whose entire identity was tied to his physical strength and his mastery of the forest, had been severed from his purpose in a single, brutal moment. The thought was a chilling one, a reminder of the precariousness of their existence, of how quickly everything could be taken away. That night, the bunkhouse was hushed. Findlay was in a deep, drug-induced sleep, his leg a rigid, splinted shape beneath the blankets. The community had absorbed the blow and had a plan. They would care for him, they would get him to the city, they would see that he was provided for. The covenant held. In the deep, sheltering dark of their own bunk, Peter lay awake, listening to the wind howl around the corners of the cabin. The raw, physical ache of his own body was a comforting, grounding presence, a testament to his own wholeness. He thought of Findlay, of the life that had been so irrevocably altered. He turned, pressing his face into the warmth of Ewan\u2019s shoulder. \"What will happen to him?\" he whispered into the darkness. Ewan\u2019s arm tightened around him, a solid, reassuring weight. \"We'll look after him,\" he murmured, his voice thick with sleep. \"He's one of us.\" The words, the same ones Cal had spoken to Peter, were not just a statement, but a creed. It was the fundamental law of this place: you did not abandon your own. In the heart of the unforgiving winter, in a world stripped down to its barest essentials, Peter understood that he had stumbled into a family, bound not by blood, but by the shared, unspoken promise to catch one another when they fell."

He left behind him a diagnosis and a death sentence for a way of life. The silence in the cookhouse that morning was as thick and heavy as the porridge in the bowls. The men ate without speaking, the scrape of spoons the only sound. Findlay, sedated and still in the bunkhouse, was a ghost at their table, his absence a gaping hole in their small fellowship. Cal, having returned with the doctor and snatched only a few hours of sleep, sat at the head of the table, his face a mask of grim authority. He drank his tea in slow, deliberate gulps, his flinty eyes scanning the faces of his crew, taking their measure in the wake of the crisis. The time for shock was over. Now was the time for logistics.\n\n\"We move him tomorrow, at first light,\" Cal announced into the silence, his voice flat and final, leaving no room for argument. \"The snow has hardened. A sledge can make it to the coast road if we follow the riverbed. From there, we pray for a lorry.\" He outlined the plan with brutal simplicity. It would be a two-day journey, at best. A team of four to manage the sledge, which they would have to build that day. They would need to break trail through untouched snow, navigate treacherous ice on the frozen river, and camp one night in the open. It was a journey fraught with peril, undertaken for one of their own. \"I'll lead,\" he continued, \"and I'll take Torquil, he knows the river better than any man. I need two more. Strong backs, steady heads.\" The men at the table stirred, a low murmur of assent. Hands were ready to be raised. This was a duty, not a choice. Cal\u2019s eyes moved down the table, assessing, calculating. He looked past men who had been with him for a decade, his gaze finally settling on Peter. \"Angus,\" he said, nodding to the powerfully built woodsman who had sharpened Peter\u2019s axe. Then, \"And Peter.\"\n\nA stunned silence fell over the table. Every eye turned to Peter. He felt the weight of their collective gaze, a mixture of surprise, doubt, and a new, grudging respect. He was the newest, the least experienced, the one who just yesterday was still considered an apprentice at best. To be chosen for such a crucial, dangerous task was an honour so profound it was terrifying. He saw Ewan, across the table, stiffen as if struck. \"Cal, no,\" Ewan said, his voice a low, tight command. It was the first time Peter had ever heard him challenge his brother so directly in front of the others. \"The lad\u2019s not seasoned for this. It's two days in the open, in this cold. He'll break.\" The protective fury in Ewan\u2019s voice was palpable, a raw, exposed nerve. But Cal\u2019s expression did not soften. He met his brother\u2019s gaze, his own eyes as hard and unyielding as granite. \"He was seasoned enough yesterday,\" Cal said, his voice dropping, but carrying an edge that cut through the room. \"He's light, which is good for the deep drifts. He's quick. And when the sky was falling, he didn't run. He ran towards it. I need a man who doesn't break. He goes.\"\n\nThe finality in his brother's voice left no room for appeal. Ewan stared at Cal for a long, tense moment, a silent battle of wills fought across the scarred wooden table, before he finally dropped his gaze, his jaw tight with a barely suppressed anger. The decision was made. Peter felt a strange, dizzying mixture of pride and pure, cold dread. He was being trusted with a life, with the honour of the camp. He had to be equal to it. The rest of the day was a blur of focused, purposeful activity. Under Cal\u2019s direction, they constructed the sledge, a low, sturdy platform of seasoned pine fitted with smooth wooden runners. Peter worked alongside Angus and Torquil, his own clumsiness a stark contrast to their ingrained, effortless skill. But they did not mock him. They corrected him, their instructions gruff and minimal, accepting his presence as a fact decreed by their leader. He was part of the team. He watched them pack the supplies: dried meat, hard biscuits, ropes, extra blankets, a small medical kit prepared by Annie, and the precious bottle of whisky for emergencies. Every item was chosen with a stoic pragmatism that acknowledged the thin line between survival and disaster.\n\nThe departure was a quiet, solemn ritual in the blue, pre-dawn light. The whole camp turned out, their breath misting in the frigid air. Findlay, heavily sedated and wrapped in a cocoon of blankets and furs, was carefully lashed to the sledge. He was a still, silent passenger, his face pale and waxy in the dim light. Peter took his place at one of the four guide ropes, the rough hemp cold and stiff in his hands. He felt a touch on his arm and turned to see Ewan. He had come not to say goodbye, but to make a final inspection. He ran a critical eye over Peter\u2019s gear, tugging the scarf tighter around his neck, checking the straps on his snowshoes. His movements were brusque, almost angry, but his hands lingered for a fraction of a second too long on Peter's shoulder. \"Stay behind Cal,\" Ewan said, his voice a low, urgent murmur for Peter\u2019s ears alone. \"Watch his feet. Put your boots exactly where he puts his. Don't think, just follow.\" He pressed a small, flat metal flask into Peter\u2019s hand, its contents sloshing softly. \"For the cold,\" he said. It was an order, not a gift. He met Peter\u2019s eyes, and in their peat-smoke depths, Peter saw a universe of unspoken fear. \"Come back,\" Ewan whispered, the words so soft they were almost lost in the cold air.\n\nPeter could only nod, his throat too tight for words. He gripped the flask, its cold metal a tangible link to the man he was leaving behind. Cal gave a single, sharp command, and the four men leaned into their ropes, taking the strain. The sledge runners groaned in protest against the snow, and then, slowly, ponderously, they began to move. Peter fell into step behind Cal, his eyes fixed on the back of the older man's boots, the rhythmic crunch of their snowshoes the only sound. He did not look back. He knew that if he did, he would see Ewan standing there, a solitary figure watching them go, growing smaller and smaller until the vast, silent, white forest reclaimed him. The garden, for the first time since he'd arrived, was now behind him, and ahead lay only the stark, unforgiving wilderness and a long road back to a world he had tried so hard to escape."
