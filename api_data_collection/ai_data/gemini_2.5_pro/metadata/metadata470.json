     "novel_text": "The rain didn't so much fall on Blackburn as it was wrung out of a perpetually sodden flannel sky. A grey, greasy sort of wetness that clung to brickwork and seeped through the soles of sensible shoes. Sergeant Cassia Ptolomey felt it in her bones, a familiar ache that mapped the hairline fractures from a fall she\u2019d taken as a young sparky, years before the uniform. The wipers on her unmarked Mondeo fought a losing battle, smearing the drizzle and the strobing blue light against the windscreen. Another one. Another girl. The call had been terse, coded, but she knew. They all knew.\n\nThe old Jubilee Mill stood skeletal against the bruised twilight, its windows like vacant eyes. Tape, stark and yellow, barred the way. A uniformed constable, barely old enough to shave, nodded at her, his face pale and glistening. \u201cSergeant. She\u2019s\u2026 up on the third floor. The old weaving room.\u201d\n\n\u201cForensics on site?\u201d Cassia asked, her voice flat. She didn't want the answer.\n\n\u201cJust arrived. DI Coulson\u2019s up there. He said to wait for you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure he did,\u201d she muttered, pulling a pair of disposable blue gloves from her coat pocket and snapping them on. The air inside the mill tasted of rust, damp rot, and dead pigeons. It was a cathedral of decay, vast and silent but for the drip-drip-drip of water finding its way through the ruined roof. Her footsteps echoed on the concrete floor. She ignored the creaking goods lift and took the stairs, her hand skimming the cold, gritty iron of the banister. Third floor. The weaving room. Of course. She liked open spaces. She liked an audience, even if it was only the ghosts of a dead industry.\n\nThe scene was bathed in a brilliant, almost holy light. It was the first thing she noticed, the first thing that was always wrong. Standard procedure was to preserve a scene as found, but the killer\u2019s scenes were never found in darkness. A half-dozen industrial floodlights, precariously wired and clamped to rusted looms, were all aimed at the centre of the room. At the canvas.\n\nA young woman was seated on a lone, antique chair, her head tilted to one side as if listening to a secret. Her skin was the canvas. She was a tableau of impossible colour, swirls of cobalt and viridian that coiled around her limbs, intricate patterns of crimson and ochre that bloomed across her chest. It wasn't just paint. It was enamel, thick and glossy, catching the harsh light. The artist had taken her time. The air smelled faintly of linseed oil and something sharper, an acrid chemical tang that tickled the back of Cassia\u2019s throat.\n\nDetective Inspector Coulson, a man whose frame seemed perpetually hunched against a coming blow, was standing by one of the looms, his gaze fixed on the horror. \u201cCassia,\u201d he breathed, a puff of steam in the cold air. \u201cIt\u2019s her. No doubt.\u201d\n\nCassia didn't reply. She walked a slow, deliberate circle around the scene, her eyes missing nothing. The victim was barefoot. Her left foot was untouched, pale and perfect. Her right foot was a mess of smeared, half-finished red, and the toes were gone. All five of them. Neatly severed.\n\n\u201cName?\u201d Cassia\u2019s voice was a rasp.\n\n\u201cWe think it\u2019s a Holly Vance. Reported missing two days ago by her flatmate. A student at the college.\u201d\n\n\u201cA student.\u201d Cassia knelt, her gaze drawn not to the lurid artwork of the body but to the floor. Wires snaked from the floodlights to a junction box on the far wall. The wiring was a mess, a dangerous, amateurish tangle of extension leads and piggy-backed plugs. But the lights themselves were perfectly angled, creating a studio effect, eliminating shadows from the subject. Contradictions. The killer was a chaotic artist and a meticulous technician.\n\n\u201cAnything else?\u201d Coulson asked, shuffling his feet. \u201cForensics are about to do their sweep.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe power,\u201d Cassia said, pointing with her chin at the junction box. \u201cTell them not to touch that. Not yet. I want to see how it\u2019s wired.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe wiring? Cass, she\u2019s been turned into a bloody Faberg\u00e9 egg, and you\u2019re worried about the electrics?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe needed the light to work, Jim. She brought it with her. She set it up. It\u2019s part of her ritual. It\u2019s part of *her*. I want to know how she thinks.\u201d Cassia stood up, her knees cracking in protest. Her gaze fell on the young woman\u2019s face. Beneath a delicate filigree of gold paint across one cheek, her eyes were open. They were wide with a terror that time and death had failed to erase. The hatred was the one thing the killer didn't bother to paint over. She wanted them to see it. She wanted the world to see it.\n\nCassia turned away. She\u2019d been an electrician for ten years before joining the force. She understood circuits. Power in, power out. A logical flow. You could trace a fault from the symptom back to the source. This killer, this woman the papers were starting to call \u2018The Collector\u2019, defied logic. Her circuit was all wrong, a catastrophic short somewhere in her soul that was blowing fuses all over the town. Holly Vance was the third. The third girl found posed, painted, and partially disassembled. And Cassia Ptolomey knew, with a certainty that felt like ice in her gut, that she would not be the last. This wasn't just murder. It was a declaration of war, and the battleground was the bodies of the women of Blackburn.\n\nBack at the station, the air was thick with the fug of cheap coffee and quiet desperation. The incident room was a chaos of whiteboards, tangled phone cords, and stacks of files that seemed to grow of their own accord. Holly Vance\u2019s face, a smiling, vibrant graduation photo, was now pinned to the board next to the others. Chloe Ashton, a barmaid. Jessica Riley, a trainee solicitor. Three bright, promising lives, reduced to evidence bags and post-mortem reports. And freezer parts. Cassia shuddered, the thought of the toes surfacing unbidden. The pathologist\u2019s report on the first two victims had been chillingly specific. Surgically precise amputation, post-mortem. Kept, not discarded. The Collector was collecting.\n\nHer junior, DC Alistair Evans, a fresh-faced lad from Burnley with earnest eyes and an unfortunate moustache, handed her a mug of tea. It was milky and sweet, the way she hated it, but she took it anyway. \u201cAnything from the wiring, sarge?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s clever,\u201d Cassia said, staring at the board. \u201cUsed a portable generator at the first two scenes. This time, she tapped directly into the mill\u2019s mains. Bypassed the meter, ran a new feed to that junction box. It\u2019s a sparky\u2019s job. Not a professional, maybe, but someone who knows their way around a high-voltage supply. Someone who isn\u2019t afraid of it.\u201d She took a scalding sip of the tea. \u201cDid we get a list of tenants from Holly Vance\u2019s building?\u201d\n\n\u201cOn your desk,\u201d Evans said. \u201cNothing jumps out. Families, a couple of other students. We\u2019re running background now.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd friends? Social media?\u201d\n\n\u201cBeing scrubbed as we speak. She was in the university art club. That\u2019s a\u2026 a thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cAn art club,\u201d Cassia repeated, the words tasting like ash. \u201cOf course she was.\u201d It felt too obvious, like a trap. The killer was displaying her work, a grotesque public gallery. Was she hiding in plain sight, critiquing her own masterpieces in a student union bar? The audacity of it made Cassia\u2019s teeth ache. She looked at the three smiling photos. Chloe, Jessica, Holly. What was the connection? They didn\u2019t know each other. Different ages, different social circles, different parts of town. The only thing they had in common was that they were women, and that they were now dead. The wiring was faulty. She couldn\u2019t find the source.\n\nThe door to the incident room slammed open and Detective Chief Inspector Corrigan strode in. He was a bull of a man, with a face the colour of raw steak and a temper to match. He ignored the rest of the room and fixed his small, piggy eyes on Cassia.\n\n\u201cPtolomey. My office. Now.\u201d\n\nThe DCI\u2019s office was neat to the point of neurosis, a stark contrast to the man himself. He stood by the window, his back to her, looking down at the glistening streets. \u201cThree of them, Cassia. Three young women mutilated in my town. The press are having a field day. \u2018The Toe Collector\u2019. It sounds like something out of a penny dreadful. They\u2019re making her a bloody folk hero.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s no hero, sir,\u201d Cassia said, her voice tight.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need your commentary, I need a result!\u201d Corrigan spun around, his face mottled with fury. \u201cI\u2019ve got the Chief Constable on the phone every hour, asking why a former electrician is leading the hunt for a serial killer. I keep telling him you have a unique insight. A different perspective.\u201d He leaned over his desk, his bulk threatening to splinter the wood. \u201cStart having some unique insights that lead to a bloody arrest, or I\u2019ll find someone who sees things the old-fashioned way.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re chasing a ghost, sir. There\u2019s no DNA, no prints, no witnesses. She\u2019s meticulous.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen be more meticulous!\u201d he roared. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a faulty light switch, Ptolomey! You can\u2019t just jiggle the wires until it works! Rip this town apart, I don\u2019t care. I want a name on my desk by the end of the week.\u201d\n\nCassia stood her ground, her jaw set. \u201cAnd if we don\u2019t have one?\u201d\n\nCorrigan\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cThen you\u2019ll be back on traffic duty, writing parking tickets. Maybe you\u2019ll have better luck finding a pattern there.\u201d\n\nShe left his office without another word, the threat hanging in the air. The pressure was no longer just a creeping dread; it was a physical weight, a hand squeezing her throat. Back in the incident room, she ignored the sympathetic glances from her team and walked to her desk. It was buried under files, photos, and forensic reports. Chloe. Jessica. Holly. She picked up the file for the first victim, Chloe Ashton. A barmaid, found in an abandoned textile warehouse six weeks ago. Cassia started reading again, from the very beginning. The list of personal effects found at her flat. Clothes, books, makeup, laptop. A receipt from a pharmacy. A flyer for a yoga class. A half-finished painting on an easel in her spare room. Wait. She frowned, flipping through the pages. The crime scene report for Jessica Riley. Personal effects. A half-eaten takeaway. A stack of legal textbooks. A flyer for a new caf\u00e9 opening. A half-finished watercolour of a canal boat on her kitchen table.\n\nHer heart started to beat a little faster. She grabbed the preliminary list from Holly Vance\u2019s flat, still warm from the printer. She scanned down the page. Bills. A library book. A flyer for a local theatre production. And there it was. Item 14: \u2018Sketchbook and box of charcoal pencils on bedside table.\u2019\n\nThey weren\u2019t just in an art club. They weren\u2019t just the canvas. They were artists themselves. Amateurs. Hobbyists. It wasn\u2019t the connection. Not the whole thing. But it was a current. A faint, low-voltage whisper in the static. And for the first time in weeks, Cassia Ptolomey felt like she\u2019d finally found a wire she could follow. The killer wasn\u2019t just destroying women. She was destroying their creativity. She was stealing their art, and then making her own. The hatred wasn\u2019t random. It was targeted. It was personal. This wasn't a monster. A monster is a myth. This was a person, twisted into something foul. A person with a reason. And Cassia would find it.The thought solidified, hard and sharp as a shard of glass. She slammed the files shut, the sound cracking through the weary hum of the incident room. Evans jumped, slopping tea onto his hand. Coulson looked up from a map he was studying, his eyebrows raised.\n\n\u201cAlistair,\u201d Cassia\u2019s voice was clipped, energised. \u201cForget social media for a minute. I want every art class, every evening course, every amateur painting group in Blackburn and the surrounding towns for the past five years. I want membership lists, tutors, attendees. Cross-reference them with our victims. All three of them.\u201d\n\n\u201cArt classes, sarge?\u201d Evans asked, wiping his hand on his trousers. \u201cYou think she\u2019s in one?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Cassia said, striding over to the main whiteboard and wiping a section clean with the sleeve of her coat. \u201cI think our victims were. Chloe Ashton had an easel set up. Jessica Riley was painting watercolours. Holly Vance had a sketchbook. They were all hobbyists. Dabblers. Our killer isn\u2019t just killing women. She\u2019s killing artists. Or at least, women who are trying to be.\u201d She turned to face the room, her eyes burning with a cold fire. \u201cThis isn\u2019t random. It\u2019s a critique. A final, fatal review. Find me the link. Find me the place where they might have shown their work, or taken a class, or bought their supplies. Find me the common ground where our three budding artists might have crossed paths with a failed one.\u201d\n\nDI Coulson pushed himself away from the map table, a glimmer of something other than exhaustion in his eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s thin, Cass.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s more than we had an hour ago,\u201d she retorted. \u201cAn hour ago we were looking for a monster. Now, we\u2019re looking for a person. A bitter, jealous, talented person who knows her way around a fuse box and a colour wheel. She thinks she\u2019s a genius, and she\u2019s angry that no one else sees it. She\u2019s punishing these women for daring to create, for their simple, harmless joy in making something. It\u2019s the worst kind of envy. The kind that curdles into hate.\u201d\n\nCassia left the team to their new, monumental task. The frantic energy of the discovery was already fading, replaced by the gnawing need to see, to understand. She needed to look at their art. Not as evidence, but as they had intended it. She signed out the keys to the first victim\u2019s flat. Chloe Ashton. The barmaid. The first canvas. The building was a grim, 1970s block overlooking a patch of sodden grass. The police tape on the door was faded, the official seal brittle. Inside, the air was stale, a time capsule of a life cut short. It smelled of lavender air freshener and old takeaway.\n\nIn the spare room, just as the report had stated, was the easel. The half-finished painting was a landscape, a view of Darwen Tower from the moors. It was\u2026 okay. The perspective was a little off, the colours of the heather a bit muddy, but there was a warmth to it. A genuine attempt to capture a moment of beauty in a grey world. It was hopeful. Naive, even. Cassia ran a gloved finger over the untouched part of the canvas, the rough, blank texture waiting for a colour that would never come. This was what the killer had seen. This simple, unpretentious effort. And her reaction had been to snatch the life from the person who made it, to mock their gentle ambition by turning their own body into a grotesque, screaming masterpiece of technical brilliance and utter depravity.\n\nShe stood there for a long time, in the silent, sad little room, the landscape of the painting a stark contrast to the urban decay outside the window. The ache in her bones flared, a dull throb that echoed the deeper ache in her soul. She wasn't just chasing a killer anymore. She was hunting a critic. And the reviews were getting worse. The circuit was still a mess, but she could feel the heat from it now. It wasn't a cold case, a logical puzzle of inputs and outputs. It was a live wire, spitting and arcing in the dark, and she knew she was getting closer to touching it. The only question was whether she could earth the fault before it surged again, before it claimed another fuse.Chapter 2\n\nThe drive back from Chloe Ashton\u2019s flat was a smear of sodium orange and relentless rain. Cassia saw the town not as a collection of streets and buildings, but as a vast, faulty circuit board. The murders were power surges, blowing through the lives of unsuspecting components. Her job was to trace the wiring back to the corrupted source. Chloe\u2019s painting, so full of hesitant optimism, had been the key. It wasn\u2019t just a clue; it was a statement of intent from the victim, an echo of a life that the killer had tried to silence completely. The Collector hadn\u2019t just stolen a life; she had stolen a nascent dream and twisted it into a nightmare.\n\nBy the time she returned to the station, the grim energy of the initial discovery had curdled into the low-grade, caffeinated slog of a major investigation going nowhere fast. DC Evans looked up as she entered, his youthful face etched with fatigue. A mountain of printouts sat on the table in front of him, a paper representation of the impossible task she\u2019d set them. He looked like a man trying to empty the ocean with a teaspoon.\n\n\u201cSarge. We\u2019ve got lists from twenty-three different art groups, evening classes, and community workshops going back five years,\u201d he said, his voice flat with exhaustion. \u201cWe\u2019re talking hundreds of names. We\u2019ve started cross-referencing, but Chloe Ashton and Jessica Riley don\u2019t seem to have ever attended the same class. We haven\u2019t even properly started on Holly Vance\u2019s potential overlaps yet. The Venn diagrams are coming up empty.\u201d\n\nCassia nodded, unsurprised. She dumped her wet coat over the back of her chair and stared at the whiteboard, at the three smiling faces that now seemed to mock their efforts. \u201cYou\u2019re thinking about it like a cop, Alistair. You\u2019re looking for a direct connection, a shared space. Think like an artist. Or a critic. She\u2019s not their classmate.\u201d She picked up a dry-wipe marker, the squeak on the board making Evans wince. \u201cShe\u2019s their audience.\u201d\n\nShe drew three circles on the board, labelling them C, J, and H. She left them separate, with no overlapping sections. \u201cThey don't have to have been in the same room. They just needed to be visible. To her. They put their art out there, somewhere. Or they were about to. Where do amateurs show their work? Where do they compete? Not just classes. Think bigger. Exhibitions. Local competitions. Fairs.\u201d\n\nCoulson, who had been on the phone, his voice a low, placating murmur, hung up and walked over. \u201cThe DCI\u2019s getting itchy, Cass. He wants to see the wires, not the theory.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is the theory that will show us the wires, Jim,\u201d she said, not taking her eyes off the board. \u201cAlistair, change the search parameters. Look for annual events. Competitions. Get me lists of entrants, not just attendees. Find me a stage where our three victims put themselves on display.\u201d\n\nThe hours bled into one another. The fug of stale coffee was joined by the smell of microwaved curries and burnt toast. The incident room became a pressurised chamber of quiet, frantic work. Cassia felt the old familiar ache in her bones settle into a deep, rhythmic throb, a metronome marking the time the killer had to find her next subject. She went through the victims\u2019 files again, looking for anything she\u2019d missed. She read the pathologist's notes on the amputations until the clinical language became meaningless, just words on a page. Post-mortem. No defensive wounds. The toes were not at the scene. They were trophies. A collection.\n\nIt was almost 3 a.m. when Evans\u2019s voice, hoarse with a mixture of fatigue and excitement, cut through the quiet hum of computer fans. \u201cSarge. I think I\u2019ve got it.\u201d\n\nCassia was at his side in an instant, Coulson looming behind her. On the screen was a website, its design cheap and cheerful, for an event called the \u2018Lancashire Amateur Artist of the Year\u2019. It was a yearly competition, culminating in a week-long exhibition at the Blackburn Museum and Art Gallery. Evans scrolled through an archived page from two years ago. \u201cThere. Entrant list. Chloe Ashton. She submitted a landscape. \u2018Darwen Tower at Sunset\u2019.\u201d\n\nCassia\u2019s breath caught in her throat. The very painting on the easel. \u201cKeep going.\u201d\n\nEvans clicked another link. Last year\u2019s competition. \u201cJessica Riley. Submitted a watercolour. \u2018Canal Life at Eanam Wharf\u2019.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd Holly Vance?\u201d Cassia asked, her voice barely a whisper.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the thing,\u201d Evans said, tapping a final key. He brought up a screenshot of Holly\u2019s laptop desktop, taken by the forensics team. A file sat there, an application form. \u2018LAAOTY_2023_Entry_Form.docx\u2019. \u201cShe was in the middle of filling it out when she was taken. She was going to enter this year.\u201d\n\nThe room was silent. It wasn\u2019t a class. It was a competition. A public declaration of their artistic ambition. Chloe and Jessica had been contestants. Holly was about to be. They had put their creative, hopeful souls on a public stage to be judged. And someone had judged them. Harshly. The connection wasn\u2019t just a wire; it was a high-voltage cable, humming with lethal potential.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a hunting ground,\u201d Coulson breathed, staring at the screen. \u201cShe\u2019s not finding them by chance. She\u2019s shopping for them.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s not just shopping,\u201d Cassia corrected, her mind racing, the pieces clicking into place with the satisfying certainty of a circuit breaker resetting. \u201cShe\u2019s eliminating the competition. Or what she perceives as competition. Alistair, I need to know everything about this event. Who organises it? Who are the judges? And more importantly, give me a list of every single person who has entered for the last five years and never won. Especially the ones who enter year, after year, after year.\u201d\n\nThe search narrowed, became focused. The organiser was a man named Julian Finch, the owner of a small, private gallery in the town centre. He was also the head judge. The lists of entrants were a public record, posted on the competition\u2019s website. Cassia stared at the names, scrolling back through the years. Dozens of them. Hopefuls. Hobbyists. Dreamers. And somewhere among them, a killer.\n\n\u201cWe start with Finch,\u201d Cassia declared, grabbing her coat. The rain had finally stopped, leaving the pre-dawn streets slick and black, reflecting a sky the colour of a fading bruise. \u201cShe needs supplies. Enamel paints. Linseed oil. Specific things. A gallery owner would know who buys that stuff. He'd know the serious amateurs from the dabblers.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt this hour, Cass?\u201d Coulson asked, though he was already pulling on his own jacket.\n\n\u201cShe works at night, Jim,\u201d Cassia said, her hand on the door. \u201cSo do we.\u201d The fatigue had vanished, burned away by a surge of adrenaline. She was no longer just tracing the fault. She could hear the buzz of the live wire, feel the heat radiating from it. She was getting close enough to touch it.The Finch Gallery was an island of minimalist white in a sea of Victorian red brick. Housed in a converted bank, its large, plate-glass windows glowed with a cold, internal luminescence, showcasing a single, spiky metal sculpture that looked like a mechanical sea urchin. It was a place that felt deliberately alien to its surroundings, a monument to artistic pretension. Julian Finch, when he finally opened the heavy glass door, fit his gallery perfectly. He was a tall, slender man in a silk dressing gown, his silver hair artfully tousled, his face a mask of weary annoyance.\n\n\u201cDetective Inspector,\u201d he said, his voice a cultivated baritone that seemed to resent being used before breakfast. \u201cTo what do I owe this\u2026 unspeakably early pleasure?\u201d He barely glanced at Cassia, his eyes dismissing her as part of the operational drabness.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re here about the murders, Mr. Finch,\u201d Coulson said, stepping inside, his solid presence an affront to the gallery\u2019s delicate emptiness. \u201cHolly Vance. Chloe Ashton. Jessica Riley.\u201d\n\n\u201cA terrible business. A tragedy for the arts community,\u201d Finch said, gesturing vaguely. \u201cI knew the names, of course. From the competition. Such\u2026 enthusiastic amateurs.\u201d The condescension dripped from the last two words. \u201cI\u2019ve already given a statement to one of your constables.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not here for a statement, Mr. Finch. We\u2019re here for your expert opinion,\u201d Cassia cut in, her flat tone silencing him. She walked past him, her boots loud on the polished concrete floor. \u201cThe killer is an artist. A very, very good one, technically speaking. She favours enamels. She has a flair for dramatic lighting. Who buys that kind of material locally? Who has that kind of skill set?\u201d\n\nFinch bristled at her directness. \u201cMy dear Sergeant, enamel is a specialist medium. And anyone with a plug can create dramatic lighting. I deal in fine art, not hobbyist supplies. There\u2019s an art shop on the market, they might be able to help you.\u201d He was already turning away, eager to usher them out.\n\n\u201cChloe and Jessica both entered your competition,\u201d Cassia pressed, stopping him in his tracks. \u201cHolly Vance was about to. This isn\u2019t a coincidence. The killer is using your event as a catalogue.\u201d\n\nFinch went very still. The performance fell away, and for a moment, a flicker of genuine fear showed in his eyes. \u201cThat\u2019s a monstrous accusation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese are monstrous murders,\u201d Cassia countered. \u201cWe\u2019re not interested in the winners, Mr. Finch. We\u2019re interested in the losers. The ones who enter every year. The ones who think they\u2019re geniuses but never get a prize. The ones you have to let down, year after year. Who gets angry? Who makes a scene? Who is brilliant, but not brilliant enough?\u201d\n\nThe silence in the sterile white room stretched, thick and uncomfortable. Finch ran a hand through his perfect hair, dislodging it for the first time. He seemed to shrink a little, the silk robe hanging loose on his thin frame. \u201cThere are always\u2026 difficult personalities. Passion can curdle into resentment. It\u2019s the nature of art.\u201d He paused, his gaze becoming distant. \u201cThere was one. A woman. She entered for four years straight. Her technique was\u2026 astonishing. Hyper-realistic. She painted on ceramic tiles, using enamels. The level of detail was surgical, but it was utterly without life. Cold as a mortuary slab.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat was her name?\u201d Cassia\u2019s voice was low, intense.\n\n\u201cVale,\u201d Finch said, the name tasting like something unpleasant in his mouth. \u201cAgnes Vale. Her submissions were always portraits. Terribly beautiful and terribly empty. I tried to give her constructive criticism, to encourage her to find some\u2026 heart. She didn\u2019t take it well. The last time she entered, two years ago, I didn\u2019t even shortlist her. She\u2026 accused me of destroying her career. Said she would find another canvas for her talents. One that the world couldn\u2019t ignore.\u201d He shuddered. \u201cI had to ask her to leave. I haven\u2019t seen her since.\u201d\n\nThe name hung in the air of the incident room like a charged particle. AGNES VALE. Cassia wrote it in big, block letters on the whiteboard, underlining it twice. The vague shape of the ghost they were hunting had a name. The energy in the room shifted, the exhaustion replaced by a tense, focused hum. The flood of data from the art classes became a targeted stream.\n\n\u201cAgnes Vale,\u201d Evans called out from his computer half an hour later, his voice tight. \u201cGot her. Born in Blackburn, 1983. No criminal record. She\u2019s been off-grid for the last eighteen months. No credit card activity, no tax records, no benefits. It's like she fell off the face of the earth after that last competition.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat did she do before she dropped out?\u201d Cassia asked, walking over to his desk.\n\nEvans clicked through a few screens. \u201cShe had a few dead-end jobs. Cleaner, factory work\u2026 but before that, for about five years\u2026 sarge, you\u2019re not going to believe this.\u201d He turned to look at her, his eyes wide. \u201cShe was an apprentice electrician. Worked for her father\u2019s firm, Vale Electricals, until he retired.\u201d\n\nCassia felt a jolt, a strange, dissonant shock of recognition. It wasn't just a suspect anymore; it was a mirror image, distorted and grotesque. A sparky. Someone who understood circuits, power, and flow. Someone who, like her, had traded a world of wires and schematics for another calling. Only their paths had diverged catastrophically. One had chosen to uphold the law; the other to twist it into a new, horrific form of art.\n\n\u201cShe knows what she\u2019s doing,\u201d Cassia said, more to herself than anyone else. \u201cShe knows how to bypass a meter, how to rig a generator, how to wire up those floodlights without blowing every fuse in the building. She\u2019s not just a chaotic artist and a meticulous technician. She\u2019s both. The same person. The same skills.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an address,\u201d Coulson said, pointing at the screen over Evans\u2019s shoulder. \u201cNot a residence. It\u2019s a commercial property, registered to the now-defunct Vale Electricals. A lock-up. Unit 7, on the old canal-side industrial estate. She never sold it.\u201d\n\nAn isolated workshop. Near the water. Plenty of space, plenty of power, and no neighbours to hear a scream. It was perfect. The final piece of the circuit diagram slotted into place. Cassia looked at the whiteboard, at the three smiling faces, and then at the name, Agnes Vale. She could see the entire schematic now: the festering resentment, the technical skill, the artistic ambition, all wired together into a deadly, closed loop, short-circuiting into murder.\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d Cassia said, her voice cutting through the room with absolute authority. \u201cJim, get on to the DCI. I want a full briefing for an armed response unit in one hour. No sirens, silent approach. Evans, get me every schematic you can find for that industrial estate. I want to know the power grid, access points, everything. This is her workshop. Her studio. Her gallery.\u201d Cassia pulled on her coat, the familiar weight settling on her shoulders. The ache in her bones was gone, replaced by a cold, sharp certainty. She had traced the fault all the way back to the source. Now, she just had to pull the master switch before the whole system blew.The briefing room was airless and crammed with the black-clad bulk of the Armed Response Unit. They were a different breed of police; where Cassia\u2019s team ran on caffeine and intuition, these men were coiled springs of kinetic energy, smelling of weapon oil and barely suppressed aggression. They listened to Cassia with a professional stillness, their eyes, accustomed to assessing immediate, physical threats, trying to compute the strange new data she was feeding them.\n\n\u201cThe target\u2019s name is Agnes Vale,\u201d Cassia began, her voice steady and devoid of emotion. Her gaze swept over them, meeting every eye. \u201cShe is an artist, and she is an electrician. Do not treat those as separate facts. The two are intertwined. We are not just entering a suspect\u2019s hideout; we are entering her studio and her workshop. Expect the lighting to be unconventional. Expect wiring that makes no sense. Do not touch light switches. Do not assume any power source is standard or safe. She knows how to weaponise a building\u2019s nervous system. The primary threat may not be a firearm, it might be the floor you\u2019re standing on.\u201d\n\nA burly ARU lead, a man with a jaw like a breeze block, grunted. \u201cSo we watch our step. Is she considered armed and dangerous, Sergeant?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe has murdered three women and dismembered them,\u201d Cassia replied, her voice dropping a notch, the coldness in it silencing any further questions. \u201cConsider her the most dangerous person you have ever met. But our priority is containment and preservation of evidence. We go in silent. We take her alive if possible. DI Coulson and I will be on your heels. This is my scene. You are my tools. Do exactly as I say. Any questions?\u201d The room remained silent.\n\nThe convoy of unmarked cars slipped through the sleeping town like grey ghosts. There were no sirens, just the soft swish of tyres on wet tarmac and the crackle of heavily encrypted comms. They crossed the canal, the black water swallowing the reflections of the streetlights, and entered the industrial estate. It was a place of forgotten commerce, a graveyard of small enterprises. Rusted signs for scaffolding firms and wholesale plumbing supplies hung askew on corrugated fences. It was a place designed to be ignored.\n\nUnit 7 was anonymous, a tin-clad box identical to its neighbours. But as Cassia got out of the car, she saw it. A single, thick-gauge armoured cable, newer than the rest, running from a junction pole directly to the unit\u2019s side wall, bypassing the rusted meter box completely. A professional, illegal tap. Her heart hammered against her ribs. Agnes was here. She was drawing power. The beast was in its lair.\n\nThe ARU moved with a terrifying, fluid grace, melting into the shadows around the building\u2019s perimeter. The lock on the main roller door was snipped with a silent hydraulic cutter. With a low groan of metal, the door was raised just enough for them to slide under. Cassia took a deep, steadying breath, the air cold and sharp in her lungs, and followed Coulson into the darkness. The first thing that hit her was the smell. It was the same toxic cocktail from the Jubilee Mill\u2014linseed oil, enamel, and the acrid tang of chemical solvent\u2014but beneath it was something else. A cloying, metallic sweetness. The smell of old blood.\n\nEmergency lights from the ARU helmets cut sharp, mobile cones through the cavernous space. It was a workshop, meticulously organised. Tools hung on pegboards in neat silhouettes. Spools of wire in every colour and thickness were stacked on shelves. On the other side of the space, it transformed into a studio. A large, professional-grade easel stood empty. Shelves were lined with hundreds of tins of paint, arranged in a perfect chromatic scale, a rainbow of potential malice. And on a large corkboard that covered an entire wall, the investigation was laid bare from the killer\u2019s perspective.\n\nIt was a gallery of hate. There were photos of Chloe, Jessica, and Holly. Next to their smiling faces were photos of their artwork, the hopeful little paintings Cassia had only seen in evidence files. Scrawled across each one in vicious red marker were critiques. \u2018Derivative composition.\u2019 \u2018Pathetic use of colour.\u2019 \u2018No soul. No ambition. WASTE.\u2019 It was a shrine to her own sick genius, a justification for her crimes. She wasn\u2019t just killing them; she was grading them. And they had all failed.\n\nCassia tore her eyes from the board, her stomach churning. In the far corner of the unit, a section had been walled off with plasterboard, a crudely built room within a room. A heavy-duty power cable snaked across the floor and disappeared under the door. It was humming. A low, constant thrum of energy. \u201cThere,\u201d Cassia said, her voice a rasp. \u201cThat\u2019s the circuit she\u2019s hiding.\u201d\n\nTwo of the ARU officers put their shoulders to the flimsy door and it burst inwards with a crack of splintering wood. The room inside was freezing. The source of the cold and the hum was a large, walk-in freezer unit, the kind used by butchers. Its thick, insulated door was secured with a heavy industrial padlock. But it wasn\u2019t the freezer that made Cassia\u2019s blood run cold. It was the walls. They were covered, floor to ceiling, with exquisitely detailed anatomical drawings. Sketches of feet. Hundreds of them, rendered with the cold precision of a medical textbook. And hands. And faces. It was a library of future work.\n\nWhile one of the officers used bolt cutters on the padlock, Cassia\u2019s gaze fell on a small workbench in the corner. On it, a single, antique porcelain doll\u2019s foot sat in a vice. It was partially painted in a familiar shade of crimson. Agnes was practising. Honing her technique on a substitute before moving on to a living canvas. The level of detached, obsessive preparation was more terrifying than any act of frantic violence. The padlock snapped. Coulson, his face pale and grim, pulled open the heavy freezer door.\n\nA wave of refrigerated air washed over them, thick with the smell of death. It was exactly as Cassia had feared, but infinitely worse. On stainless steel shelves, arranged with the sterile precision of a museum exhibit, were the trophies. The toes of Chloe Ashton, Jessica Riley, and Holly Vance. Each set of five was encased in a clear block of resin, polished to a glass-like sheen. Each block was on its own small, labelled plinth, like a piece of precious sculpture. \u2018Exhibit A: Chloe A.\u2019 \u2018Exhibit B: Jessica R.\u2019 \u2018Exhibit C: Holly V.\u2019 It was a gallery of stolen parts.\n\nBut the horror didn\u2019t stop there. On the next shelf down, a fourth plinth sat waiting. It was empty, but a neatly printed label was already in place. It read: \u2018Exhibit D.\u2019 And next to it, pinned to the freezer\u2019s interior wall, was a new photograph. A smiling, confident young woman with dark, curly hair, captured laughing outside the Blackburn Art Shop. She was holding a bag of supplies. Underneath the photo, a single word was written in that same, vicious red ink. \u2018Pretentious.\u2019\n\nDI Coulson swore, a low, guttural sound of pure dread. Cassia just stared, the ice in her gut solidifying into a block of cold, hard certainty. They had found the studio. They had found the gallery. They had found the killer\u2019s soul, laid bare in all its monstrous, obsessive detail. But they had not found the killer. Agnes Vale wasn\u2019t there. She was out. The empty plinth wasn\u2019t a plan; it was a promise. The fault hadn't been earthed. The circuit was still live. And somewhere out in the sleeping town, a fourth girl had just been moved from a shopping list to a death warrant.Chapter 3\n\nThe cold from the freezer was not a temperature; it was a presence. It leeched the warmth from the air and the hope from the room, leaving behind a vacuum filled only by the sight of that fourth, empty plinth. The label, \u2018Exhibit D\u2019, was not a clue; it was a tombstone waiting for a name. DI Coulson let out a string of quiet, venomous curses, the words swallowed by the insulated walls of Agnes\u2019s horrific little gallery. The ARU officers, men trained for firefights and bomb threats, stood frozen, their tactical gear suddenly seeming inadequate against a horror so meticulously curated. This was not the chaotic aftermath of violence; this was a statement of profound and patient evil.\n\nCassia didn't speak. She felt the name Agnes Vale burn itself into her memory, no longer just a suspect but a dark reflection. An electrician. A woman who had walked a similar path of wires and logic, but whose circuit had broken in a way Cassia could barely comprehend. She saw the schematic clearly now: the failed ambition, the technical skill, the roaring furnace of envy, all meticulously wired together to create this monstrous output. She reached out and, with a gloved finger, gently touched the photo of the new girl, the intended \u2018Exhibit D\u2019. The laughing face was a spark of life in a chamber of death, and Cassia felt a surge of cold, protective fury that was more potent than any fear.\n\nBack at the station, the atmosphere had transformed. The sluggish, weary slog was gone, replaced by the frantic, high-frequency energy of a race against a ticking clock. The photo of the unknown woman was on every screen, a ghost they had to find before she became one for real. DCI Corrigan stormed into the incident room, his face no longer mottled with rage but tight with a new, grim purpose. He looked at the photo, then at the empty plinth Cassia had insisted on bringing back, and finally, his gaze settled on her. The usual animosity in his eyes was replaced with something that looked almost like respect, or at least a desperate reliance.\n\n\u201cThe Chief Constable just called,\u201d Corrigan said, his voice a low growl that cut through the noise. \u201cHe asked me if the former electrician was still jiggling the wires. I told him she\u2019d found the whole damn power station.\u201d He jabbed a thick finger towards Cassia. \u201cThis is yours, Ptolomey. All of it. You know how she thinks. You know what she can do. I don't care what you need or who you have to tread on. Find this girl. Find Vale. End this. Now.\u201d The threat was gone, replaced by a command that was also a plea. For the first time, Corrigan wasn't fighting her; he was arming her.\n\nWhile Evans and the rest of the team worked feverishly to identify \u2018Exhibit D\u2019\u2014sending officers to the art shop, running the image through facial recognition databases, cross-referencing with local college records\u2014Cassia stood before a massive map of Blackburn that had been pinned to the wall. She wasn't just looking at streets and landmarks. She was trying to see the city\u2019s unseen skeleton, its nervous system. She had Coulson pull up schematics of the electrical grid, old ones from the council archives. She overlaid them on the map, marking the locations of the three murders and Agnes\u2019s workshop with red pins.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s not random, Jim,\u201d she murmured, tracing a line on the plastic overlay with a dry-erase marker. \u201cThe Jubilee Mill, the warehouse, Holly\u2019s body at the weaving room\u2026 they\u2019re all old industrial sites. Places with heavy-duty power infrastructure. Places a sparky would know about.\u201d She stepped back, her eyes narrowed. The red pins weren\u2019t a random scattering. They formed a distinct, deliberate pattern. \u201cThey\u2019re all connected to the old industrial feeder line. The one that used to power the looms when this town actually made things. Her father\u2019s firm would have worked on it for decades. She knows it like the back of her hand. She\u2019s not just finding locations; she\u2019s following a circuit.\u201d\n\n\u201cSarge!\u201d Evans\u2019s voice cracked with a breakthrough. \u201cWe\u2019ve got her. The girl in the photo. Name\u2019s Sarah Jenkins. She\u2019s a textile design student at the college. The art shop owner recognised her, said she\u2019d been in yesterday afternoon buying specialist dyes.\u201d He typed furiously, bringing her details up on the main screen. \u201cLives alone in a flat just off the town centre. We sent a unit. No answer. Neighbours haven\u2019t seen her since yesterday. Her car is gone.\u201d The words hung in the air, each one another shovelful of dirt on a grave that wasn't yet filled.\n\nThe final piece slotted into place with a sickening click. A textile student. Another creator, another young woman daring to make art. Cassia turned back to her map, her mind racing. Sarah Jenkins was already gone. Agnes had her. She was setting up her new studio right now. Cassia\u2019s eyes scanned the path of the old feeder line, past the mill, past the warehouse, looking for the next logical point in the sequence. And then she saw it. A place so obvious, so poetically perfect for Agnes\u2019s grand, terrible design that a shiver traced its way down Cassia\u2019s spine.\n\nIt was a disused electrical substation, right on the canal. A brick fortress built to contain and control immense power, now decommissioned and left to rot. It was isolated, it was secure, and it was a temple to the very force Agnes had mastered. It was the heart of the old industrial circuit. A place to make a final, shocking statement. A place to turn a woman into a masterpiece using the very power that once drove the town. \u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d Cassia said, her voice ringing with absolute conviction. \u201cThe old canal substation. That\u2019s where she is.\u201d\n\nShe didn\u2019t wait for an argument. She was already grabbing her coat, the weight of it a familiar comfort. Coulson was right behind her, shouting into his radio, scrambling the ARU. The mood was different this time. They weren\u2019t raiding an empty workshop. They were racing towards an active performance, a private exhibition that could turn lethal at any second. As Cassia slid into the passenger seat of the unmarked car, the first strobes of blue light began to paint the wet streets. She stared ahead into the darkness, ignoring the ache in her bones, ignoring the churning in her gut. She could feel the current humming, the circuit reaching its catastrophic peak. She had found the fault, and now she was heading straight for the arc.The old substation rose from the canal-side mist like a blunt, brick tombstone. Its windows were high, narrow slits, bricked up long ago, making it a blind, featureless monolith. But it wasn't dead. A low, resonant hum vibrated in the air, a sound Cassia felt more than heard, travelling through the soles of her boots. It was the song of stolen electricity, a deep-throated chorus of immense power being drawn from the grid and contained within those walls. A single, thick armoured cable, identical to the one at the workshop, snaked out of a manhole cover and disappeared into a newly drilled hole in the brickwork, a black artery feeding the monster within.\n\nThe ARU team fanned out, their movements economical and silent, their black gear absorbing the faint moonlight. The team lead looked at Cassia, his helmet-mounted camera glinting. \"Doors are reinforced steel. No easy entry.\"\n\n\"She won't have used the doors,\" Cassia said, her eyes scanning the building's structure, thinking not like a cop but like a tradeswoman looking for an access point. \"She needs to get her equipment in, but she's paranoid. She'll have made her own way.\" Her gaze followed the new power line. It ran alongside a fat, rusted drainage pipe. Above it, ten feet up, was a metal grille covering a ventilation shaft. The grille was slightly askew, one corner bent outwards. \"There. The ventilation shaft. It'll lead down into the main transformer hall.\"\n\nIt was a risk. A dark, confined space that could be easily booby-trapped. But it was the only way in that didn't involve a battering ram, which would give Agnes all the warning she needed. While the ARU deployed a lightweight ladder, Cassia conferred with Coulson in a low whisper. \"When we get in, the lights go off. All of them. She needs light to work; it's her stage. Plunge her into darkness, and we take away her power. Literally.\" She pointed to the junction pole down the embankment. \"There's a manual cut-off on that pole. Once I give the signal, I want you to have someone kill the feed. It'll cut the mains to the whole block, but it'll cut her illegal tap too.\"\n\nCoulson nodded, his face grim. \"And what's the signal?\"\n\n\"You'll know,\" she said, her expression hardening as she looked up at the dark maw of the ventilation shaft.\n\nClimbing the ladder and squeezing into the shaft felt like entering a coffin. The air was thick with the dust of decades and the metallic tang of ozone. The low hum of the substation grew louder, vibrating through the metal ductwork until it was a physical pressure against her ears. After twenty yards, the shaft opened onto a mesh catwalk high above a cavernous space. Cassia peered down through the grate. Her breath caught in her chest. It was exactly as she had pictured, and a thousand times worse. The transformer hall was vast, a cathedral of decaying technology. But in the centre, Agnes Vale had built her theatre. A dozen floodlights were clamped to the old steel gantries, all focused on a single point, creating a pool of brilliant, sterile white light. And on the stage, Sarah Jenkins was bound to a heavy wooden chair, her face a mask of silent, weeping terror. She was alive. She was awake.\n\nBefore her, a woman knelt, her back to the catwalk. She was dressed in practical, paint-spattered overalls, her dark hair tied back severely. This was Agnes. In one hand, she held a delicate paintbrush; in the other, a small pot of vibrant, glossy blue. She was working on Sarah\u2019s arm, her movements precise and utterly absorbed, like a watchmaker assembling a delicate movement. She was humming softly, the sound lost in the greater hum of the transformers. Around the central tableau, the scene was a chaotic web of wires. Extension leads snaked across the floor, daisy-chained into overloaded sockets that were plugged into a makeshift distribution board wired directly into the substation\u2019s main busbars. It was a monstrous, beautiful fire hazard, a tangle of genius and insanity. Cassia saw it instantly: the sheer, reckless arrogance of the setup. Agnes hadn't just tapped the power; she had harnessed the dragon, convinced of her absolute mastery over it.\n\nCassia keyed her radio, her voice a barely audible whisper. \"All units hold. Do not engage. I'm going down. I'm going to talk to her.\"\n\n\"Cassia, no!\" Coulson's voice crackled in her ear. \"That's a negative. Wait for my signal to cut the power.\"\n\n\"If you cut the power now, she panics,\" Cassia hissed back. \"Look at that wiring. A surge, a short circuit... that whole place could go up. She's wired Sarah into it. Look at her feet.\" Cassia\u2019s torch beam found the base of the chair. Sarah\u2019s bare feet were not on the concrete. They were in two shallow, metal trays filled with water. Wires ran from the overloaded distribution board and were clipped to the side of each tray. It was a crude, horrifyingly effective circuit. A switch, a surge, and Sarah would be the fuse. \"She's not just the canvas, Jim. She's the kill switch. I have to talk her down. On my mark.\"\n\nBefore Coulson could protest, she swung her legs over the side of the catwalk and dropped the ten feet to the concrete floor below, landing with a practiced roll that absorbed the impact. The sound, small as it was, cut through Agnes's concentration. She rose slowly, turning not with a start, but with a languid, irritated grace, like a genius interrupted. Her face was sharp and intelligent, her eyes a pale, piercing grey. There was no madness in them, only a chilling, absolute certainty. She looked at Cassia, taking in the police vest, and then she smiled. It was a thin, dismissive smile.\n\n\"A critic,\" Agnes Vale said, her voice calm and clear. \"I suppose it was inevitable. Come to review the work in progress?\"\n\n\"I'm here to shut you down, Agnes,\" Cassia said, taking a slow step into the pool of light. She kept her hands open and visible. \"It's over.\"\n\n\"Over?\" Agnes laughed, a short, sharp bark of contempt. \"My dear, I'm only just getting started. The others were just studies. This...\" she gestured towards the weeping Sarah, \"...this is the beginning of my major phase. I'm finally working with a medium that has some life in it. You have to be so careful not to break them before the work is complete.\"\n\n\"They weren't just material, Agnes. They were people,\" Cassia said, her voice low and even. She had to keep the circuit stable, prevent a surge of emotion. \"Chloe Ashton painted landscapes. Jessica Riley liked boats.\"\n\n\"They had hobbies,\" Agnes sneered, the word dripping with venom. \"They were amateurs, scribbling their pathetic little feelings and calling it art. They clogged up the world with their mediocrity. They were praised for their 'enthusiasm'. While I...\" Her voice tightened, the first crack in the cold facade. \"...I have perfect technique. I have vision. And I was dismissed. Told to find some 'heart'.\" She spat the word out. \"I am giving them truth. I am giving them beauty that is terrible and perfect. Something they can't ignore.\"\n\nCassia took another step, her eyes flicking to the tangle of wires on the floor, tracing the paths, assessing the load. It was a work of insane brilliance, but it had a flaw. A single point of failure. \"You're an electrician, Agnes. So was I. We understand how things work. Power in, power out. But your circuit is wrong. It's overloaded. You're going to blow a fuse.\"\n\nFor the first time, a flicker of interest showed in Agnes's eyes. \"You were a sparky?\" The contempt lessened slightly, replaced by a kind of professional curiosity. \"Then you, of all people, should appreciate this. The control. The raw power, shaped by my will. This building was the heart of the town's industry. I've given it a new purpose. I've turned it into a gallery. My gallery.\"\n\n\"You've turned it into a bomb,\" Cassia said bluntly. Her eyes met Sarah's, trying to convey a silent message of hope. \"And you've wired a young woman to the detonator. That's not control, Agnes. That's desperation. That's a fault you can't fix.\"\n\nAgnes\u2019s face tightened. \"It is a failsafe. To protect the art from interruption.\"\n\nCassia saw her opening. It was a single, frayed extension cord, plugged into the very heart of the distribution board and snaking away towards a bank of high-intensity sodium lamps Agnes was using for ambient colour. The cord was old, the insulation cracked, and it was lying in a small puddle of water from a leaking roof pipe. It was the weakest link. The point of catastrophic failure.\n\n\"You're right about one thing,\" Cassia said, her voice dropping, becoming almost conspiratorial. She took one last, deliberate step, putting herself between Agnes and the frayed wire. \"They couldn't see the genius in the wiring.\" She nodded towards the board. \"It's a masterpiece of improvisation. But you've overloaded the primary busbar feed. The resistance on that gauge of wire... you're pulling nearly 200 amps through a system designed for 100. It's beautiful, but it's going to burn.\"\n\nAgnes frowned, her artist's pride stung by a technical critique. She took the bait. Her eyes left Cassia, flicking to the distribution board, mentally re-calculating the loads, the doubt planted. In that instant of distraction, Cassia dropped to one knee. She didn't draw her weapon. She reached for a heavy rubber-handled wrench left on the floor from Agnes's setup. With a single, fluid movement, she swung it down, not at Agnes, but at the puddle of water, driving the frayed, live extension cord deep into it.\n\nThe effect was instantaneous and spectacular. There was a deafening CRACK-BOOM as the water flashed to steam and the overloaded circuit shorted out. A shower of brilliant blue and white sparks erupted from the distribution board. The floodlights, the sodium lamps, the entire magnificent theatre of light died in a split second, plunging the vast hall into absolute, terrifying darkness. The deep hum of the transformers was replaced by a sudden, profound silence, broken only by Sarah Jenkins's ragged gasp.\n\nIn the disorienting blackness, Cassia didn't hesitate. \"NOW!\" she roared into her radio, the signal for Coulson.\n\nAgnes screamed, a sound of pure fury and thwarted ambition. She was blinded, her masterpiece ruined, her stage gone dark. The ARU team, equipped with night-vision, stormed the hall from three directions, a whirlwind of disciplined violence. Red laser dots danced across the space, converging on the screaming, thrashing silhouette. Cassia scrambled towards the chair, using her small torch to find her way. Sarah was shaking uncontrollably, and Cassia\u2019s hands, sure and steady, found the clips on the metal trays and ripped them off, breaking the circuit for good. She wrapped her coat around the girl's trembling shoulders. \"It's okay,\" she said, her voice rough with adrenaline. \"It's over. You're safe.\"\n\nAcross the hall, the fight was already finished. Agnes Vale, the Collector, the brilliant, twisted artist of Blackburn, was pinned to the floor under the weight of three ARU officers, her face pressed into the grimy concrete. The lights were out. The show was over. The critic had delivered her final review. As emergency lights flooded the hall with a flat, unforgiving glare, Cassia looked from the terrified, living face of Sarah Jenkins to the defeated, broken form of Agnes Vale. The faulty circuit was finally broken. The current was earthed. The terrible, humming silence that followed felt, for the first time in weeks, like peace.Chapter 4\n\nThe sudden, flat glare of the emergency lights was a brutalist assault after the curated brilliance of Agnes\u2019s stage. It stripped the scene of all its dark theatre, revealing it for what it was: a filthy, damp industrial space littered with the tools of a deranged obsession. The smell of burnt plastic and ozone from the short-circuited board was thick and acrid, a chemical post-mortem on the death of Agnes\u2019s grand design. Cassia kept her coat wrapped around Sarah Jenkins, a thin shield against the cold and the encroaching reality of the last few hours. The girl was shivering violently, her teeth chattering in a frantic, percussive rhythm, her wide, terrified eyes fixed on the empty space where her tormentor had knelt moments before. Paramedics moved in with a practiced, gentle efficiency, their calm voices a soothing balm in the charged air, and began to lead Sarah towards the promise of warmth and safety.\n\nDI Coulson appeared at Cassia\u2019s side, his face slick with sweat under the harsh lighting, a massive wave of relief washing the tension from his features. He looked from the departing paramedics to the tangled mess of wires at their feet, and then to Cassia, a slow shake of his head conveying a mixture of awe and profound exasperation. \u201cYou\u2019re a bloody lunatic, Ptolomey. You know that, right? A certifiable, Grade A lunatic.\u201d He let out a long, shuddering breath. \u201cThat was the single most reckless and brilliant thing I have ever seen. If it had gone wrong\u2026\u201d He didn\u2019t need to finish the sentence. They both knew the cost of failure, measured in amps and volts, was absolute.\n\n\u201cShe wired her to the mains, Jim,\u201d Cassia said, her voice flat and exhausted, the adrenaline beginning to recede, leaving a hollow ache in its wake. \u201cThere was no other way. It was her logic. I just used it against her.\u201d Her gaze was drawn across the hall, where Agnes Vale was being hauled to her feet by the ARU officers. Her face was smudged with dirt, her overalls torn at the shoulder, but her eyes, when they found Cassia\u2019s, were not filled with fear or despair. They were blazing with a pure, intellectual fury, the outrage of a master craftsman whose masterpiece has been vandalised by a philistine. As they led her past, she stopped, straining against the officers\u2019 grip.\n\n\"You,\" Agnes hissed, her voice low and venomous. \"You didn't beat my art. You didn't understand it. You just cut the power. Any fool can flip a switch.\" She stared at Cassia, a look of profound, chilling condescension on her face. \"You're not a critic. You're just another city maintenance worker, turning out the lights when the exhibition is over.\" The officers pulled her away then, her final, delusional critique echoing in the vast, empty space. Cassia didn't respond. She just watched her go, a dark, distorted reflection of her own past, a sparky who had short-circuited on the world and tried to rewire it to her own monstrous design.\n\nWith the victim safe and the killer in custody, the atmosphere in the substation shifted again. The forensics team, who had been waiting patiently outside, now moved in, their white suits stark against the grime. They began the slow, methodical process of deconstruction, turning Agnes's grand, terrible theatre back into a collection of mundane exhibits. The perfectly angled floodlights became evidence tag #47. The antique chair, #48. The pots of enamel paint, #49 through #73. The magic was gone, the horror dissected and catalogued. Cassia walked a slow perimeter of the dead stage, her eyes tracing the paths of the wires she now understood so well. Power in, chaos out. She had followed the schematic, found the inherent flaw in the design, and exploited it. It was a good piece of diagnostic work. The thought brought her no joy, only a deep, soul-crushing weariness.\n\nBack at the station, the dawn was a grey, watery smear against the windows. The fug of desperation had been replaced by the smell of relief and bacon sandwiches from the canteen. The incident room was quiet, the frantic energy replaced by the low hum of report-writing. DC Evans looked up as she walked in, his unfortunate moustache unable to hide a wide, exhausted grin. Even DCI Corrigan was there, leaning against the doorframe of his office. He caught Cassia\u2019s eye and gave a single, curt nod. It was the closest to a commendation she would ever get from him, and it was more than enough. On the main whiteboard, someone had already drawn a thick, definitive line through the name AGNES VALE. The three smiling photos of Chloe, Jessica, and Holly remained, but they seemed different now. Not just victims in a puzzle, but lives that could finally be mourned, their cases closed, their memory no longer part of an active hunt.\n\nCassia sat down at her desk, the cheap office chair groaning in protest. The ache in her bones had returned, a familiar, dull throb mapping the old hairline fractures. She looked out of the window at the town. The rain was still falling, a steady, persistent drizzle that washed the streets clean. It was the same grey, greasy wetness from the day before, but it felt different. Less like a sodden flannel, and more like a simple, honest rain. The circuit was closed, the fault was earthed, the terrible energy that had been arcing across the town finally dissipated. She was just an electrician, after all. And the lights of Blackburn, for now, were safe.Chapter 5\n\nTwo days later, the incident room was a ghost of its former self. The whiteboards had been wiped clean, the frantic energy bled out of the air, leaving only the lingering smell of cold coffee and the quiet rustle of final reports being collated. The faces of Chloe, Jessica, and Holly had been taken down, their images moved from the wall of active investigation to the sad, permanent archives of closed cases. DC Evans, his moustache looking slightly less calamitous in the absence of overwhelming stress, was meticulously filing away the last of the witness statements. The great, roaring engine of the murder investigation had been throttled back to an administrative hum, the methodical and necessary process of putting the horror into a box and sealing the lid. For the first time in weeks, Cassia drank a cup of tea that wasn\u2019t scalding or overly sweet; it was just a cup of tea, a small return to normalcy in a world that had been tilted on its axis.\n\nThe paperwork was a mountain, a testament in triplicate to the chaos they had clawed their way through. Cassia\u2019s final report was a dense, technical document, detailing the logic of the electrical circuits, the psychology of the unsub, the chain of deduction that had led them to the substation. It was dry, factual, and completely inadequate. It captured the what and the how, but it couldn't touch the chilling, arrogant \u2018why\u2019 that still echoed in the corners of her mind. Agnes Vale was in custody, remanded to a high-security facility, her plea yet to be entered but her guilt as certain as a sunrise. But Cassia felt an unnerving sense of an incomplete circuit. There was one last connection to be checked, one final diagnostic to be run. She needed to see her one more time, not in a storm of sparks and darkness, but under the flat, unwavering light of a formal interview.\n\nThe interview room was the architectural opposite of everything Agnes Vale created. It was a cube of oppressive grey, soundproofed and featureless, devoid of artifice or drama. It was a room designed to strip everything away, leaving only the truth. When they brought Agnes in, dressed in a standard-issue grey tracksuit that seemed to infuriate her with its lack of form and intent, she looked smaller, less formidable. But her eyes, as they locked on Cassia sitting opposite the steel table, were unchanged. They were chips of ice, burning with the same undiluted contempt, the same intellectual arrogance. The artist was deprived of her studio and her medium, but she was still convinced of her own genius. She sat, her posture ramrod straight, a queen holding court in a peasant\u2019s hovel.\n\n\u201cI was wondering when the maintenance crew would be back for a final inspection,\u201d Agnes began, her voice dripping with cultivated disdain. She didn\u2019t look at the uniformed officer in the corner or the recording equipment on the table. Her entire, ferocious attention was fixed on Cassia. \u201cHave you come to catalogue my tools? To write a tedious report on my methods? You can't possibly hope to understand my motives.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not here to understand your motives, Agnes,\u201d Cassia said, her voice calm and level. It was vital she didn't engage on Agnes\u2019s terms, not to be drawn into her world of perverse aesthetics. \u201cI\u2019m here to finalise the inventory. Your collection. The toes you took from Chloe, Jessica, and Holly. Encased in resin. Why? Why keep them?\u201d\n\nA flicker of a smile touched Agnes's lips. \u201cProof of concept. A sculptor keeps his maquettes. A writer keeps his first editions. They were the first tangible results of my new process. The most perfect part of the canvas, preserved. You wouldn't understand. It\u2019s about posterity. They were my first reviews, you see. Tangible, perfect little critiques of a world that failed to see me.\u201d She leaned forward slightly, the grey tracksuit crinkling. \"Those women, their so-called art, it was all feeling and no skill. Muddy, sentimental rubbish. I gave them form. I gave their meaningless lives a final, perfect, terrible structure. I made them important.\"\n\n\u201cTheir lives were already important,\u201d Cassia countered, her voice hardening almost imperceptibly. \u201cChloe Ashton\u2019s parents thought her life was important. Holly Vance\u2019s friends thought her life was important. The art they made was for them. It was a conversation they were having with themselves. It wasn't for you. It wasn't for anyone. You didn\u2019t just kill them, Agnes. You interrupted them. You read a stranger's diary and then burned the house down because you didn't like their handwriting.\u201d\n\nThe smile on Agnes's face vanished, replaced by a flash of raw fury. \u201cYou reduce it all to such banal domesticity! You see a circuit and you just see a light switch. You don't see the power! The potential! I was a god in those rooms. I was a creator, using the basest materials\u2014flesh and fear and electricity\u2014and I was making something eternal. And you, a common tradeswoman, came in and threw a wrench in the works. You didn\u2019t defeat me. You just broke my equipment. You are, and will always be, nothing more than a saboteur.\u201d\n\nCassia stood up, the interview concluded. She had what she needed. She had looked into the abyss and seen not a complex, misunderstood genius, but a spoiled child throwing a lethal tantrum. The circuit wasn\u2019t complex at all; it was pathetically simple. A failure of ego, shorting out into rage. \u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Cassia said, turning for the door. \u201cI am a tradeswoman. I see a faulty circuit that\u2019s a danger to the public, and I shut it down. That\u2019s the job.\u201d She paused at the door, looking back at Agnes one last time. \u201cYou weren\u2019t a god, Agnes. You were just a fault. And now you\u2019ve been repaired.\u201d She walked out, closing the door on the soundproofed grey box, leaving Agnes Vale alone with the one thing she couldn\u2019t stand: an audience of absolutely no one.\n\nDriving home that evening, the rain had finally stopped. The sky over Blackburn was a canvas of bruised purples and soft greys, the setting sun finding cracks in the cloud cover to send down pale, watery shafts of light. The streets, washed clean, gleamed. Cassia thought of Sarah Jenkins, who she'd heard had been released from hospital into the care of her family, the intricate blue enamel scrubbed from her skin, the terror slowly beginning to recede from her eyes. She thought of the three boxes of evidence from Agnes\u2019s freezer, the grotesque resin sculptures that would be handled by pathologists and psychologists, analysed for meaning before being consigned to a final, quiet resting place with the bodies they belonged to. A measure of peace. A restoration of order.\n\nThe familiar ache in Cassia\u2019s bones was still there as she unlocked her front door. It was a part of her, a permanent schematic of old damage. But for the first time in a long time, it didn\u2019t feel like a harbinger of rain or a premonition of dread. It was just an ache. A reminder that some things, once broken, never heal perfectly. They just find a new way to bear the load. She stood by her window, looking out at the town's grid of lights flickering on against the encroaching twilight. A vast, complex, and functioning circuit. For tonight, at least, all the fuses were holding. The system was stable. And the maintenance worker could finally rest.Two days later, the incident room was a ghost of its former self.

For tonight, at least, all the fuses were holding. The system was stable. And the maintenance worker could finally rest.Chapter 6\n\nA fortnight after the sparks died in the old substation, the silence was, in its own way, louder than the chaos had been. The incident room had been returned to its default state of low-grade operational hum, now focused on a string of catalytic converter thefts that felt both laughably mundane and blessedly simple. Cassia sat at her desk, the mountain of paperwork from the Vale case now condensed into a single, thick, book-bound report that sat on the corner of her desk like a tombstone. The press had had their field day. They had christened her \u2018The Sparky Detective,\u2019 a moniker she loathed with a quiet, burning intensity. They ran lurid, speculative pieces about her past, her methods, her supposed \u2018sixth sense\u2019 for electricity. They turned her methodical, grinding police work into a cheap superpower, missing the point as spectacularly as Agnes Vale had.\n\nDCI Corrigan\u2019s summons came, as always, like a barked command. But when she entered his neurotically neat office, the atmosphere was different. The raw steak colour had faded from his face, replaced by a weary professionalism. He didn\u2019t pace or stand with his back to her. He sat behind his desk, a rare sign of equilibrium, and gestured for her to take the chair opposite. The seat was still uncomfortable. \u201cThe Chief Constable sends his congratulations,\u201d Corrigan began, skipping the preamble. \u201cThe Home Office is interested. The press, God help us, think you\u2019re some kind of wizard. You\u2019ve made a bloody name for yourself, Ptolomey. And for me, which is a small mercy.\u201d He leaned forward, his piggy eyes fixing on her with an unreadable expression. \u201cThey want to make it official. They\u2019re floating the idea of a new unit. Small, reactive. The \u2018Atypical Crimes Taskforce\u2019 is the working title, which sounds like something out of a comic book. Essentially, when a case comes in that smells wrong, that doesn\u2019t fit the template, it goes to you. You\u2019d get your own budget. Hand-pick your own team.\u201d\n\nCassia processed the words without letting any reaction show on her face. It was everything a detective could want: autonomy, resources, the most challenging cases. It was also a gilded cage, a formalisation of her otherness. She would no longer be just a DS in the chain of command; she\u2019d be the specialist, the odd one, the woman they called when the circuits went haywire. She\u2019d be permanently on the hunt for monsters like Agnes Vale. \u201cWho would I report to?\u201d she asked, the practical question a shield against the enormity of the offer.\n\n\u201cMe,\u201d Corrigan said, with a look that managed to be both a warning and a vote of confidence. \u201cI\u2019d keep the wolves off your back. You\u2019d do the work. No more arguments about methodology. You follow the wires, wherever they lead. You want it?\u201d The question hung in the air, heavy with consequence. It was a promotion born from three dead women and a fourth who would carry the scars for the rest of her life. It was a career path paved with trauma. Cassia thought of the endless, fruitless searches, the dead ends, the feeling of chasing a ghost. Then she thought of the click of understanding when she saw the art competition lists, the cold certainty in the substation. She had found a current she could follow in the darkest of waters. To refuse would be to turn her back on the one thing she was uniquely, terribly good at. \u201cYes, sir,\u201d she said, her voice a flat, steady signal. \u201cI want it.\u201d\n\nLeaving his office, she almost collided with DI Coulson, who was hovering in the corridor. He gave her a knowing look, a slight smile touching his tired eyes. \u201cSo, you\u2019re the new queen of the weird,\u201d he said, his tone gentle. \u201cCongratulations, I think. If you\u2019re hand-picking a team, I hope you\u2019ll have a spot for an old-fashioned copper who knows how to fill out the paperwork and keep the DCI happy.\u201d Cassia felt a rare, genuine warmth spread through her chest. The thought of having Coulson\u2019s steady, grounding presence at her side made the prospect of the new unit feel less like an exile and more like a fortification. \u201cI\u2019ll need a good DI, Jim,\u201d she said, the corner of her mouth twitching into something resembling a smile. \u201cSomeone to translate my theories about faulty wiring into actual police work.\u201d His smile broadened. \u201cIt\u2019s a deal. First round of recruits should be Evans, then. The lad\u2019s been unbearable since his Venn diagrams paid off. Thinks he\u2019s a genius.\u201d\n\nThe weight of her new reality settled later that day when she went to retrieve her car. A journalist, a sharp-faced woman with an aggressively cheerful scarf, detached herself from the wall opposite the station entrance and intercepted her. \u201cSergeant Ptolomey? A quick word for the Echo? People want to know about the woman who caught the Collector. They\u2019re saying you have a unique gift\u2026\u201d The woman\u2019s words faded into a meaningless buzz in Cassia\u2019s ears. All she could see was the hunger in the reporter\u2019s eyes, the desire to package the horror into a neat, sensational story. She saw Agnes\u2019s obsession with audience, with critics, with public perception, reflected in this woman\u2019s predatory smile. \u201cNo comment,\u201d Cassia said, her voice clipped and cold as she pushed past, the simple, official phrase a shield against the intrusive questions. The encounter left a foul taste in her mouth. She wasn't a hero or a wizard. She was a police officer who had traced a fault, and the cost of that discovery was written in three morgue reports.\n\nThat night, sleep offered no refuge. She found herself back in the substation, the air thick with ozone, but this time she was strapped to the chair, the cold water rising around her ankles. Agnes Vale knelt before her, paintbrush in hand, her face a mask of serene concentration. \u201cSuch a flawed canvas,\u201d Agnes murmured, her voice echoing in the vast hall. \u201cSo many old breaks and fractures. But we can make them beautiful. We can trace the damage in gold.\u201d Cassia woke up with a jolt, her heart hammering, the phantom ache in her bones singing with a sharp, electric intensity. Agnes\u2019s final, sneering words from the interview room came back to her: \"You\u2019re just another city maintenance worker.\" Maybe she was right. Maybe Cassia didn\u2019t have a gift for finding monsters, but simply a tradeswoman\u2019s knack for spotting shoddy, dangerous work. The thought was strangely comforting. It grounded her. She wasn't a hero locked in an epic battle with evil; she was a public servant with a very specific, and very necessary, skill set.\n\nThe next day, she broke her own rule. She used her police credentials to get an update on Sarah Jenkins. The liaison officer told her that Sarah was with her family in the countryside, away from Blackburn and the prying eyes of the media. She was talking, eating, sleeping in fits and starts. She had asked her parents to throw out all her art supplies. The news hit Cassia with an unexpected force. She had saved Sarah\u2019s life, but Agnes had still succeeded in her own twisted way. She had destroyed an artist. The simple, harmless joy in making something, which Cassia had identified as the motive, had been snuffed out. The circuit of creativity had been broken. It was a partial victory, a flawed repair. It was a reminder that even when you catch the killer, you can\u2019t erase the damage. The fault lines remained, scarring the landscape, a permanent part of the town\u2019s schematic. The new unit would not be about winning. It would be about containing the damage, earthing the faults, and trying to keep the lights on for as many people as possible, for as long as possible. It was a maintenance worker\u2019s job, after all. And Cassia Ptolomey, for better or worse, was reporting for duty.A fortnight after the sparks died in the old substation, the silence was, in its own way, louder than the chaos had been. The incident room had been returned to its default state of low-grade operational hum, now focused on a string of catalytic converter thefts that felt both laughably mundane and blessedly simple. Cassia sat at her desk, the mountain of paperwork from the Vale case now condensed into a single, thick, book-bound report that sat on the corner of her desk like a tombstone. The press had had their field day. They had christened her \u2018The Sparky Detective,\u2019 a moniker she loathed with a quiet, burning intensity. They ran lurid, speculative pieces about her past, her methods, her supposed \u2018sixth sense\u2019 for electricity. They turned her methodical, grinding police work into a cheap superpower, missing the point as spectacularly as Agnes Vale had.\n\nDCI Corrigan\u2019s summons came, as always, like a barked command. But when she entered his neurotically neat office, the atmosphere was different. The raw steak colour had faded from his face, replaced by a weary professionalism. He didn\u2019t pace or stand with his back to her. He sat behind his desk, a rare sign of equilibrium, and gestured for her to take the chair opposite. The seat was still uncomfortable. \u201cThe Chief Constable sends his congratulations,\u201d Corrigan began, skipping the preamble. \u201cThe Home Office is interested. The press, God help us, think you\u2019re some kind of wizard. You\u2019ve made a bloody name for yourself, Ptolomey. And for me, which is a small mercy.\u201d He leaned forward, his piggy eyes fixing on her with an unreadable expression. \u201cThey want to make it official. They\u2019re floating the idea of a new unit. Small, reactive. The \u2018Atypical Crimes Taskforce\u2019 is the working title, which sounds like something out of a comic book. Essentially, when a case comes in that smells wrong, that doesn\u2019t fit the template, it goes to you. You\u2019d get your own budget. Hand-pick your own team.\u201d\n\nCassia processed the words without letting any reaction show on her face. It was everything a detective could want: autonomy, resources, the most challenging cases. It was also a gilded cage, a formalisation of her otherness. She would no longer be just a DS in the chain of command; she\u2019d be the specialist, the odd one, the woman they called when the circuits went haywire. She\u2019d be permanently on the hunt for monsters like Agnes Vale. \u201cWho would I report to?\u201d she asked, the practical question a shield against the enormity of the offer. \u201cMe,\u201d Corrigan said, with a look that managed to be both a warning and a vote of confidence. \u201cI\u2019d keep the wolves off your back. You\u2019d do the work. No more arguments about methodology. You follow the wires, wherever they lead. You want it?\u201d The question hung in the air, heavy with consequence. It was a promotion born from three dead women and a fourth who would carry the scars for the rest of her life. It was a career path paved with trauma. Cassia thought of the endless, fruitless searches, the dead ends, the feeling of chasing a ghost. Then she thought of the click of understanding when she saw the art competition lists, the cold certainty in the substation. She had found a current she could follow in the darkest of waters. To refuse would be to turn her back on the one thing she was uniquely, terribly good at. \u201cYes, sir,\u201d she said, her voice a flat, steady signal. \u201cI want it.\u201d\n\nLeaving his office, she almost collided with DI Coulson, who was hovering in the corridor. He gave her a knowing look, a slight smile touching his tired eyes. \u201cSo, you\u2019re the new queen of the weird,\u201d he said, his tone gentle. \u201cCongratulations, I think. If you\u2019re hand-picking a team, I hope you\u2019ll have a spot for an old-fashioned copper who knows how to fill out the paperwork and keep the DCI happy.\u201d Cassia felt a rare, genuine warmth spread through her chest. The thought of having Coulson\u2019s steady, grounding presence at her side made the prospect of the new unit feel less like an exile and more like a fortification. \u201cI\u2019ll need a good DI, Jim,\u201d she said, the corner of her mouth twitching into something resembling a smile. \u201cSomeone to translate my theories about faulty wiring into actual police work.\u201d His smile broadened. \u201cIt\u2019s a deal. First round of recruits should be Evans, then. The lad\u2019s been unbearable since his Venn diagrams paid off. Thinks he\u2019s a genius.\u201d\n\nThe weight of her new reality settled later that day when she went to retrieve her car.

It was a maintenance worker\u2019s job, after all. And Cassia Ptolomey, for better or worse, was reporting for duty.Chapter 7\n\nThree months after the rain had washed Agnes Vale\u2019s name from the streets, the Atypical Crimes Taskforce came into being not with a bang, but with the squeal of a protesting caster wheel and the smell of industrial cleaner. Their new domain was a set of forgotten offices on the top floor of the station, a space that had once housed the canteen staff records and had since been relegated to a dumping ground for obsolete computer monitors and broken chairs. It was a place with its own history of decay, which felt fitting. Cassia, now a Detective Inspector, stood in the middle of the largest room, her hands on her hips, watching as a newly promoted Detective Sergeant Alistair Evans wrestled with a flat-pack desk that seemed to have more screws than structural components. The ache in her bones was a low, familiar hum, a baseline to the new reality.\n\nDI Jim Coulson, who had made the lateral move to be her second with a quiet lack of fuss that spoke volumes, leaned against a doorframe, a mug of tea in hand. \u201cYou know, when they said \u2018hand-pick your own team and resources,\u2019 I pictured something more than an Allen key and a room that smells of damp pigeons.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe budget covers personnel and tech, Jim. Not d\u00e9cor,\u201d Cassia said, a faint smile touching her lips. \u201cBesides, it\u2019s got good bones. Solid wiring, separate fuse board. I checked.\u201d She had spent the first day here not with files, but with a multimeter and a head torch, mapping the building\u2019s nervous system, understanding its faults and quirks. It was the only way she knew how to claim a space. It was her own ritual.\n\n\u201cGood to know we won\u2019t get electrocuted filing our reports, boss,\u201d Evans grunted, finally slotting a piece of MDF into place with a satisfying thud. He looked up, his face flushed with effort, the moustache still a work in progress but now worn with the confidence of his new rank. \u201cIt\u2019s a blank canvas, isn\u2019t it? We can make it our own.\u201d Cassia noted his use of the word \u2018canvas\u2019 and the slight, involuntary tightening in her gut that came with it. The ghost of Agnes Vale was a silent partner in this new venture, the reason for its existence, the standard against which all future strangeness would be measured.\n\nTheir first official case arrived via a terse email from Corrigan, forwarded without comment. It was a welfare check that had turned sideways. Dr. Ewan Carlisle, a respected local historian and retired professor, had missed two days of lectures at the local historical society. When uniformed officers had gained entry to his large Victorian house near the park, they\u2019d found him in his study. He was physically unharmed but completely unresponsive, sitting in his armchair and staring into the middle distance. A suspected stroke, the initial report suggested, but the paramedics had found no clear physical cause. He was now at the infirmary, in a state the doctors were cautiously labelling as a profound catatonic stupor. The local CID team had done a cursory sweep, found no signs of forced entry, no theft, nothing to indicate a crime, and had been ready to close the file. But one of the responding constables, a bright young PC, had noted something odd. Something that didn\u2019t fit. And so the file had been kicked up the chain until it landed on Corrigan\u2019s desk, who had immediately shunted it to the station\u2019s new home for lost causes.\n\nThe Carlisle house smelled of beeswax, old paper, and sherry. It was a time capsule of a quiet, academic life. The study was the heart of the home, a magnificent room lined from floor to ceiling with dark wood shelves groaning under the weight of thousands of books. It was in here that the two constables had found Dr. Carlisle. As Cassia stepped into the room, she felt a shift in the atmosphere, a subtle wrongness that reminded her of the too-perfect lighting in the Jubilee Mill. The room was immaculate. Not a speck of dust on the polished desk, not a pen out of place. It was the unnerving, sterile tidiness of a space that has been scrubbed of its personality.\n\n\u201cForensics found nothing,\u201d Coulson said, reading from his tablet. \u201cNo prints other than Carlisle\u2019s, no fibres, no signs of a struggle. The only thing they took away was the sherry decanter, but they\u2019re not expecting much. The man was seventy-two. It looks like a medical episode.\u201d\n\nCassia didn\u2019t answer. She walked slowly along the bookshelves, her eyes scanning the spines. The books were all related to history, thousands of them. Biographies, social histories, dense academic texts. But the order was chaotic. A book on Roman Britain was wedged between a biography of George V and a treatise on the Poor Laws of 1834. It was a mess. \u201cThe PC who flagged this,\u201d Cassia said, her voice quiet. \u201cWhat did she notice?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe books,\u201d Evans supplied, pointing to the shelves. \u201cShe\u2019d been here before, a few years back, for a school project. She said Dr. Carlisle was obsessive about his library. He had his own unique cataloguing system, a mix of subject, chronology, and personal significance. He could supposedly find any book in the dark. She said it looked like a bomb had gone off in his system.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a mess,\u201d Cassia murmured, pulling a book from the shelf. It was a biography of Isambard Kingdom Brunel. She looked at the copyright page. Then she pulled out another, a history of the Peterloo Massacre by E.P. Thompson. She didn\u2019t need to be a historian to see it. It wasn\u2019t chaos. It was a new system. An imposed order that was meticulous, labour-intensive, and utterly insane. She turned to her team, her eyes lit with the cold fire of dawning comprehension. \u201cThey\u2019re organised by the author\u2019s date of death.\u201d The other two detectives stared at her, then at the shelves, the implication slowly dawning on them. Someone had come into this room, a library containing a lifetime of curated knowledge, and had systematically dismantled it. They had spent hours, possibly days, cross-referencing thousands of books and rearranging them into a morbid, pointless sequence. They hadn\u2019t stolen a thing. They hadn\u2019t laid a hand on Carlisle. They had simply taken his life\u2019s work, the architecture of his own mind, and rewritten it in the language of the graveyard.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 why?\u201d Coulson breathed, looking at the shelves with a new sense of horror. \u201cWhat kind of person does that?\u201d\n\n\u201cA person who wants to make a statement,\u201d Cassia said, her mind already tracing the circuit. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t a burglary. It was an execution. They didn't kill his body; they killed his mind. They showed him what they had done to his life\u2019s work, and the shock of it\u2026 it just broke him. Blew a fuse in his brain.\u201d She looked around the silent, violated room. This was their first case. Not a collector of body parts, but a collector of intellects. A saboteur of legacies. The ache in her bones sharpened. It was Agnes Vale\u2019s methodology, her core principle of vindictive, intimate destruction, translated into a different medium. The Atypical Crimes Taskforce was officially open for business, and their first client was already a ghost.The statement hung in the dusty air of the library, as quiet and as devastating as the act it described. Coulson stared at the shelves, his expression shifting from confusion to a dawning, grim comprehension. He was a man who understood broken doors, stolen wallets, and the brutal physics of a fistfight. This was different. This was a violation on a level he had no template for, a silent, intellectual evisceration. Evans, younger and more impressionable, looked physically ill, as if he could feel the sheer, painstaking malice that had been poured into the room over countless hours. To rearrange a few books was a prank; to do this to a whole library, to a whole life, was an act of profound psychological warfare.\n\n\u201cIt would have taken days,\u201d Coulson said, his voice a low rumble. \u201cQuietly. Methodically. The man must have let them in. Trusted them.\u201d He ran a hand over his face, the gesture conveying a weariness that went beyond lack of sleep. \u201cSo we\u2019re looking for a librarian from hell? Someone with a grudge and a terrifying amount of free time?\u201d The sarcasm in his voice was a flimsy defense against the creeping strangeness of the scene.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking for a student,\u201d Cassia corrected, her focus absolute as she scanned the room, seeing it not as a collection of objects but as a schematic of the crime. \u201cOr a rival. Someone who knew Carlisle. Someone who knew what this library represented. This wasn't a random act of vandalism. This was a bespoke piece of cruelty, designed specifically for him.\u201d She walked over to the large oak desk. It was empty apart from a leather blotter, a pen stand, and a single, sealed envelope, placed perfectly in the centre. Carlisle\u2019s name was written on it in elegant, looping calligraphy. \u201cWas this here when the uniforms arrived?\u201d\n\nEvans checked the initial report on his tablet. \u201cYes, boss. They logged it but didn\u2019t open it. Assumed it was personal mail.\u201d Cassia carefully slit the envelope open with a pen from the stand. Inside was not a letter, but a small, stiff square of card. Printed on it in the same calligraphic script was a short phrase: *\u2018Ars longa, vita brevis.\u2019* Art is long, life is short. Below it was a small, exquisitely detailed drawing of an Ouroboros, the snake eating its own tail. It was a message, a signature, a mission statement. This was a killer who saw themselves as a philosopher, a corrector of vanities.\n\nBack in their new, half-assembled office, the blank whiteboards were put to immediate use. Evans wrote the Latin phrase and drew a surprisingly accurate copy of the Ouroboros in the centre of the board. The symbol stared back at them, a perfect, closed loop of self-consuming logic. They had a name for their unsub now, one born from his own pretentious calling card: The Philosopher. The name felt different from \u2018The Collector.\u2019 It lacked the visceral, grubby horror, but it carried a chilling, intellectual coldness that was just as unsettling. While Evans began digging into Carlisle\u2019s life\u2014finances, family, any hint of conflict\u2014Cassia and Coulson headed to the Blackburn Historical Society, a grandly named institution housed in a few rooms above a bookmaker\u2019s shop.\n\nThe society\u2019s chairman, a flustered man named Bernard, wrung his hands as he recounted Carlisle\u2019s standing. Ewan Carlisle had been a giant, a man whose knowledge of local history was encyclopedic. He was respected, admired, even loved. A feud? An academic rival? Bernard paled at the suggestion. \u201cEwan was a gentleman of the old school,\u201d he insisted. \u201cHe could be\u2026 exacting. His standards were incredibly high. He didn't suffer fools gladly. But he was never unkind.\u201d Cassia\u2019s internal circuitry sparked at the phrase. \u2018Exacting standards.\u2019 \u2018Didn\u2019t suffer fools gladly.\u2019 This was the kind of polite language used to describe a man who likely had a razor-sharp tongue for anyone he considered intellectually inferior. It was fertile ground for a festering grudge.\n\n\u201cWho were his students?\u201d Cassia asked, cutting through the eulogy. \u201cHis prot\u00e9g\u00e9s? Was there anyone he had a falling out with? Someone whose work he\u2019d perhaps\u2026 critiqued harshly?\u201d The parallel to the Agnes Vale case was impossible to ignore. A public humiliation, a perceived injustice, a monstrous ego seeking validation through destruction. Bernard hesitated, his loyalty to his friend warring with the serious expressions on the detectives\u2019 faces. \u201cThere was a young man,\u201d he said finally, his voice dropping. \u201cA few years ago. Incredibly bright. Ambitious. His name was Gideon Price. He was writing a monograph on the decline of the Lancashire textile industry, a subject Ewan considered his own. Gideon\u2019s thesis was\u2026 radical. It flew in the face of Ewan\u2019s own published work. Ewan publicly dismantled it at a society meeting. Called it \u2018historically illiterate\u2019 and \u2018an exercise in juvenile contrarianism.\u2019 It was brutal. Gideon was humiliated. He resigned from the society that night and, well, nobody has seen him since.\u201d\n\nThe name \u2018Gideon Price\u2019 went up on the whiteboard next to the Ouroboros. Evans quickly found him. Price had been a star postgraduate student at the university until he abruptly dropped out shortly after the incident Bernard described. He had no social media presence, no current address, no digital footprint for the last two years. He had, like Agnes Vale, simply fallen off the grid. He\u2019d become a ghost. Cassia stared at the name, at the story of public humiliation, at the academic subject matter \u2013 the decline of industry, the death of a way of life. The connections were faint, low-voltage whispers in the static, but they were there. She felt the same cold certainty she had felt in the Jubilee Mill. They weren\u2019t hunting for a random intellectual vandal. They were hunting for a failed historian who had decided to become the final, definitive editor of his old professor\u2019s life. The Philosopher hadn\u2019t just rearranged the books. He had been making a point about obsolescence, about a history that consumes itself, leaving nothing behind. And Cassia suspected, with a chill that had nothing to do with the office\u2019s poor heating, that Dr. Carlisle was only the first volume in his new, terrible collection.The hunt for a ghost began not with sirens and warrants, but with the quiet rustle of paper and the ghosts of lives already lived. Gideon Price had erased his present, but his past was an indelible stain on public records. The team worked backwards, pulling old tenancy agreements, university records, and employment histories. He had been a library assistant, a part-time tutor, a researcher for a local author. He had lived in a succession of cheap, transient flats. He was a man who had moved through the city\u2019s academic underbelly like a phantom, leaving behind little more than a name on a faded ledger. His family, a mother and sister in Leeds, hadn\u2019t heard from him in over two years, not since his \u2018troubles at the university\u2019. They painted a picture of a sensitive, fiercely intelligent, and prideful young man who could not bear to fail, least of all publicly.\n\nIt was Coulson, doggedly working through a list of old landlords, who got the hit. A letting agent for a block of grim 1960s flats remembered Price. \u201cOdd lad. Paid six months\u2019 rent up front, in cash. That was about eighteen months ago. Haven\u2019t seen him since. As long as the rent turned up in a bank transfer every quarter, we left him be.\u201d The last payment had been a week ago. The flat, located on the edge of town overlooking a railway cutting, was the first concrete location they had for him in two years. It was his base of operations, the nerve centre for his intellectual war. Cassia knew, with the same cold certainty she'd felt in the substation, that they wouldn't find him there. They would find his plan.\n\nThe tactical team was a formality. Cassia knew this entry would be silent and unopposed. The air inside Gideon Price\u2019s flat was stale and cold, thick with the dry, sweet scent of decaying paper. It wasn\u2019t a home; it was a monk\u2019s cell dedicated to a single, consuming ideology. There was a mattress on the floor, a single hotplate in the kitchenette, and books. Stacks of them, piles of them, walls of them. But unlike Carlisle\u2019s grand library, these were not treasured possessions. They were ammunition. Their spines were cracked, their pages filled with angry, spidery annotations. This was not a place of learning; it was a place of obsessive, furious study.\n\nOn the largest wall of the living room, Gideon had constructed his manifesto. It was a vast, sprawling timeline, meticulously drawn by hand. It wasn't a history of Blackburn, but a history of its decline, starting with the first mill closures in the 1930s and ending with the present day. Key dates were circled in red, connected by lines of thread to newspaper clippings, photocopied book chapters, and black-and-white photographs of derelict factories and forgotten men in flat caps. It was the work of a man drowning in nostalgia for a past he had never known, a man enraged by the slow, inevitable creep of decay and irrelevance. And at the very end of the timeline, there were three photographs. The first was of Dr. Ewan Carlisle.\n\n\u201cBoss, look at this,\u201d Evans called from the small bedroom. Cassia and Coulson followed him in. The room contained a single desk and a chair. On the desk sat an old, heavy manual typewriter. A half-finished page was still rolled into it. It was a list of names, each one followed by a short, damning critique. It read like a twisted set of judging notes. *\u2018Ewan Carlisle: The Curator. Preserves the dead body of history but despises its living spirit. A monument to stasis.\u2019* Below his name was another. *\u2018Eleanor Vance: The Matriarch. Governs the city\u2019s last bastion of unearned privilege. Her family built their fortune on the bones of the industry she now pretends to celebrate through charity.\u2019* The name Vance struck a chord with Coulson. \u201cEleanor Vance is the chairwoman of the Blackburn Heritage Trust,\u201d he said, his voice grim. \u201cAn old mill-owning family. They own half the historic buildings in the town centre. She\u2019s in her late eighties. A local treasure.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnother monument,\u201d Cassia murmured, staring at the typewritten words. The Philosopher wasn\u2019t just targeting academics. He was targeting figures he saw as symbols of a hollowed-out history, gatekeepers of a past he believed they had betrayed. He was a historical corrective, pruning the dead wood. This wasn't just revenge; it was a crusade. The Ouroboros on the calling card suddenly made perfect, terrifying sense. History consuming itself. He was accelerating the process. On the desk, next to the typewriter, was a small, leather-bound diary. It wasn\u2019t Gideon\u2019s. The flyleaf was inscribed with the name \u2018Eleanor Vance, 1952\u2019. He already had a personal effect. He had already breached her life.\n\nA sudden, frantic energy seized the room. Coulson was already on his phone, his voice sharp and urgent as he dispatched a patrol car to Eleanor Vance\u2019s address, a large manor house on the outskirts of the town. Cassia\u2019s mind was racing, connecting the circuits. Gideon was a ghost. He moved without a trace. He had been in Carlisle\u2019s house for days without anyone knowing. He could be in Eleanor Vance\u2019s house right now, silently moving through the rooms, a phantom editor preparing to delete another chapter of the city\u2019s history. \u201cHe\u2019s not going to do the same thing twice,\u201d she said, her voice tight with urgency. \u201cRearranging books was for the academic. For the Matriarch, the symbol of property and inheritance, he\u2019ll do something else. Something that attacks the very foundation of who she is.\u201d\n\nThe patrol car\u2019s radio crackled through on Coulson\u2019s phone. The officer\u2019s voice was strained. \u201cWe\u2019re at the Vance residence, sir. There\u2019s no answer at the door, but\u2026 the lights are on. And the front door is slightly ajar.\u201d Cassia felt a familiar spike of cold adrenaline. The trap was already sprung. \u201cTell them not to go in,\u201d she commanded, grabbing her coat. \u201cSecure the perimeter and wait for us. He\u2019s still in there. He\u2019s putting on a performance.\u201d As they raced from the flat, the stale air giving way to the shock of the cold evening, Cassia knew they were no longer just chasing a ghost. They were walking into his carefully curated exhibition, and the price of admission was terrifyingly high.Chapter 8\n\nThe Vance Manor stood silhouetted against the bruised purple of the evening sky, a grand Victorian folly of turrets and dark stone. It was a fortress of old money and older secrets, but tonight, its defenses were down. The wrought-iron gates were open, and a single light burned in a downstairs window, a lonely beacon in the oppressive dark. The patrol car was parked discreetly down the drive, its occupants staying back as ordered, their presence little more than a whisper in the vast, manicured grounds. The silence was the first thing Cassia noticed. It wasn't the quiet of a peaceful evening; it was a held breath, a predatory stillness that coiled around the ancient oak trees and seeped from the very stones of the house. The front door, a monstrous slab of dark, carved wood, was ajar, a black slash of void that served as an explicit and unnerving invitation.\n\n\"He wants an audience,\" Coulson murmured, his voice low as they approached the house, boots crunching softly on the gravel. \"Just like Agnes.\"\n\n\"Agnes wanted her work to be seen after the fact,\" Cassia corrected, her eyes fixed on the dark opening of the doorway. \"He wants us to watch him do it. This isn't a gallery viewing; it's a live lecture.\" She led the way, pushing the heavy door open further. The entrance hall was cavernous, a museum of a dead dynasty. A sweeping staircase carpeted in faded claret rose into the shadows. The walls were lined with portraits of stern-faced men and pale, corseted women, their painted eyes following the intrusion with silent disapproval. The air smelled of furniture polish, potpourri, and something else, something sharp and out of place. It was the scent of wet paper and a faint, chemical tang that reminded Cassia of a print workshop.\n\nA trail of destruction, subtle but deliberate, led them from the hall. A silver-framed photograph of a young family had been turned to face the wall. A glass display case containing military medals had been opened and the medals rearranged into a nonsensical order. They were small acts of desecration, breadcrumbs leading them deeper into the maze. The chemical smell grew stronger, drawing them towards a set of double doors at the end of a long corridor. From behind the doors came a low, rhythmic, mechanical sound: a methodical, grinding churn. Cassia gestured for Coulson and Evans to hold back. She drew her sidearm, the familiar weight a cold comfort, and pushed the door open.\n\nThe room had once been the family library, a smaller, more intimate version of Carlisle\u2019s grand collection. But Gideon Price had transformed it into a workshop for his own terrible art form. In the centre of the room, under the harsh, focused beam of a single angle-poise lamp he had brought with him, was the source of the noise. It was a heavy-duty industrial shredder and a large, stainless-steel vat filled with a churning, grey slurry, powered by a long extension cord plugged into a wall socket. And sitting in a high-backed wing chair, facing the grotesque machine, was Eleanor Vance. She was a tiny, bird-like woman, her hands clenched in her lap, but her back was ramrod straight and her eyes, fixed on the man operating the machine, burned with a cold, undiluted fury. She was not a victim in stupor; she was a queen forced to watch the sack of her own city.\n\nGideon Price didn't seem to notice their entry. He was dressed in a neat tweed jacket, over which he wore a thick rubber apron. He was calmly feeding pages from a thick, leather-bound book into the shredder. The machine whined as its teeth bit into the paper, spitting confetti-like strips into the vat. He then poured a chemical from a beaker into the slurry, and the churning intensified. He was so absorbed in his work, so professorial and precise, that he could have been conducting a chemistry experiment. He looked up only when Cassia spoke his name, her voice cutting through the mechanical drone. \u201cGideon Price. It\u2019s over.\u201d\n\nHe looked at her, his expression not of fear, but of mild irritation, the look a lecturer gives a student who has interrupted a crucial point. \u201cDetective Inspector Ptolomey,\u201d he said, his voice calm and academic. \u201cYou are just in time for the final revision. I am correcting a historical imbalance. The Vance family fortune was built on paper \u2013 paper mills, paper profits, paper promises to their workers. I'm simply returning it to its most elemental state: a worthless, grey pulp.\u201d He gestured with a stirring rod towards the churning vat. \u201cThis was their first ledger from 1888. These,\u201d he pointed to a stack of photo albums, \u201care their family portraits from the turn of the century. All paper tigers. *Ars longa, vita brevis*, but inherited wealth, Detective, should be the briefest of all.\u201d\n\n\u201cTurn off the machine, Gideon,\u201d Cassia ordered, her weapon still trained on him, her eyes flicking between him, the frail woman in the chair, and the churning vat. He was not physically imposing, but his serene, fanatical calm was more frightening than any overt threat. He was a man who had already calculated all the outcomes and was satisfied with them.\n\nGideon simply smiled, a thin, patronising curve of his lips. \u201cYou mistake my purpose. This is not an act of destruction. It is an act of creation. From this pulp, this slurry of forgotten lies and unearned privilege, I will make new paper. Blank paper. A truly fresh start for this city's history, free from the stains of the past.\u201d He picked up another leather-bound book from a pile on the floor. It was the diary Cassia had seen in his flat. Eleanor Vance\u2019s diary. A small, choked sound escaped the old woman\u2019s lips, the first sign of a crack in her composure.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not erasing history, Gideon,\u201d Cassia said, taking a slow step into the room, trying to find the flaw in his terrible logic, the loose wire in his intellectual circuit. \u201cYou\u2019re just making yourself a footnote in hers. They won\u2019t remember your thesis on the textile industry. They\u2019ll remember you as the man who tormented an old woman in her library. You\u2019re trading your entire legacy, the one thing you care about, for a single, pathetic act of vandalism. That's not a historical correction, Gideon. That's a bad trade.\u201d\n\nFor the first time, a flash of anger broke through his calm exterior. His eyes narrowed. \u201cThis is not vandalism! It is a purification! An essential, final edit!\u201d His voice rose, losing its academic detachment and taking on a shrill, desperate edge. He gestured wildly around the room, at the piles of ledgers, photo albums, and letters waiting to be fed to the machine. \u201cAnd it will be final!\u201d His hand darted towards a large, red metal canister sitting next to the desk, a can of industrial solvent, its flammable warning label stark under the lamplight. His fingers hovered over the cap. \u201cI will not be a footnote. I will be the fire that cleanses the library. My work will be complete, and you will all bear witness to the end of an age.\u201d His eyes were alight with a terrifying, ecstatic fire. He was no longer a failed historian. He was an avenging angel, ready to burn down the temple with everyone inside it.Chapter 9\n\nThe air in the library grew thick and volatile, charged with the flammable promise of Gideon\u2019s threat. The serene philosopher was gone, replaced by a wild-eyed zealot poised on the edge of a final, self-immolating act. His hand trembled over the solvent can, a finger\u2019s twitch away from turning his meticulous intellectual exercise into a crude and deadly inferno. Coulson and Evans tensed, their training screaming at them to close the distance, but the geometry of the room was a death trap. Any sudden move would trigger the fire Gideon so desperately craved. Cassia, however, remained unnaturally still, her weapon held steady, her mind racing not to find a point of attack, but a point of failure in his logic. Fire was the flaw.\n\n\u201cFire, Gideon?\u201d Her voice was unexpectedly calm, not pleading but analytical, as if discussing a poorly reasoned chapter in a thesis. \u201cHow profoundly unoriginal. It\u2019s the last resort of the vandal, not the grand statement of a philosopher. It's an admission that you\u2019ve lost the argument.\u201d Gideon\u2019s wild eyes flickered towards her, his martyrdom momentarily interrupted by the critique. \u201cThink about it,\u201d she pressed on, taking a slow, deliberate half-step. \u201cFire is indiscriminate. It destroys everything, including your point. That pulp,\u201d she nodded towards the churning vat, \u201cthe blank paper you\u2019re so proud of, your great act of creation\u2026 it all just burns. There\u2019s no thesis in ash. No legacy. You won\u2019t be the man who rewrote history. You\u2019ll just be the man who burned down a library with an old woman in it. A common arsonist. A footnote.\u201d\n\nThe word \u2018common\u2019 struck him with the force of a physical blow. His entire crusade was a war against his own perceived commonness, his failure to ascend into the academic pantheon. But before he could retort, another voice, thin but sharp as broken glass, cut through the tension. \u201cHe\u2019s right, you know,\u201d Eleanor Vance said, her voice devoid of fear, filled instead with a lifetime of aristocratic disdain. She hadn't moved from her chair, but her gaze pinned Gideon to the spot. \u201cYou\u2019re just a grubby little boy with a box of matches. My husband dealt with striking mill workers who had more conviction than you. They at least believed they were building something. You\u2019re just throwing a tantrum because a better man told you your homework wasn\u2019t good enough.\u201d\n\nThe dual assault was devastating. Cassia had attacked his intellect, the foundation of his fantasy. Eleanor Vance had attacked his class and his manhood, the source of his real-world insecurity. The ecstatic fire in Gideon\u2019s eyes sputtered, replaced by a contorted mask of pure, impotent rage. He looked from Cassia\u2019s cold logic to Eleanor\u2019s colder contempt, his grand historical narrative crumbling into dust around him. He glanced down at the solvent can, his instrument of apotheosis, as if seeing for the first time that it was just a can, not a vessel of divine justice. His certainty faltered. And in that single, crucial second of hesitation, the circuit broke.\n\nCoulson moved. He was a silent, sudden force, covering the ten feet between them in three long strides. There was no shout, no warning. Just a heavy, practiced hand clamping down on Gideon\u2019s wrist, twisting it brutally until his fingers spasmed open. Another hand seized the collar of his tweed jacket, spinning him away from the desk and the precious solvent. The can clattered to the floor, rolling harmlessly under a bookshelf. Evans was there an instant later, helping to force the struggling, sputtering historian to the ground. The fight went out of Gideon almost immediately, his body going limp as the reality of his failure crashed down upon him. He lay on the floor amidst the scattered pages of his own ambition, no longer a philosopher king, just a defeated man in a dirty apron.\n\nAs her officers secured the scene, Cassia holstered her weapon and walked over to the wing chair. Eleanor Vance was watching the methodical process of Gideon\u2019s arrest with an unnerving, regal composure. She followed Cassia\u2019s gaze to the vat, where the pulped remains of her family\u2019s history continued to churn with a quiet, indifferent rhythm. \u201cAre you alright, Mrs. Vance?\u201d Cassia asked, her voice soft. The old woman took a deep, steadying breath and then turned her piercing eyes on Cassia. \u201cI am quite alright, Inspector. Annoyed, but alright. It has been a very long time since a man raised his voice to me in my own home.\u201d A flicker of something\u2014dark humour, perhaps, or simply steel\u2014showed in her eyes. \u201cThank you for taking out the trash.\u201d\n\nThe quiet respect between the two women\u2014the old matriarch who had faced down her own erasure with unbending will, and the detective who had dismantled the threat with logic instead of force\u2014was a silent, solid presence in the chaos. Cassia gave a curt nod and then moved to the humming shredder. She found the plug and pulled it from the wall, and the mechanical churning finally ceased. The sudden silence that filled the library was immense, broken only by the sound of Coulson reading a subdued Gideon Price his rights.\n\nLeaving the house an hour later, the scene now swarming with the forensics team who would catalogue this new, strange form of violation, Cassia felt the familiar wave of post-adrenaline exhaustion. The cool night air felt clean in her lungs. She had traced another fault, earthed another dangerous current. But this one felt different. Agnes Vale had been a short circuit of pure, narcissistic envy. Gideon Price was a more complex malfunction: a feedback loop of intellectual rage, a man so obsessed with the past that he was willing to destroy the present to \u2018correct\u2019 it. As she got into the car, Cassia looked back at the grand old house, a bastion of a history that was both real and imagined, a place that had almost become a pyre. Her new unit was only two cases old, and already it was clear she was not just hunting criminals. She was diagnosing souls, and the wiring was getting more complicated with every call.The air in the library grew thick and volatile, charged with the flammable promise of Gideon\u2019s threat.

Her new unit was only two cases old, and already it was clear she was not just hunting criminals. She was diagnosing souls, and the wiring was getting more complicated with every call.Chapter 10\n\nThe silence in the top-floor offices of the Atypical Crimes Taskforce was a fragile, temporary state. It was the quiet of a system between surges, a brief respite before the next inevitable fault. Two weeks after the arrest of Gideon Price, the smell of damp pigeons had been replaced by the faint, optimistic scent of new paint. The flat-pack desks were assembled, the network was live, and a state-of-the-art digital whiteboard\u2014a concession to Evans\u2019s persistent lobbying\u2014covered one wall, its blank, white screen a stark contrast to the chaotic, ink-stained boards of the Vale case. Cassia stood before it, a mug of tea warming her hands, and stared at the two case summaries that Evans had uploaded. \u2018The Collector\u2019 and \u2018The Philosopher\u2019. One represented by a clinical 3D model of a resin-encased toe, the other by the looping, self-devouring Ouroboros. One was a crime of visceral, artistic envy; the other, a crime of cold, intellectual rage. Both were born from the same source: the corrosive power of a failed ambition.\n\n\u201cThe paperwork on Price is a nightmare,\u201d Coulson grumbled from his desk, which was already an island of meticulously ordered files in the sea of their new, sterile office space. \u201cHe\u2019s refusing to speak. Just sits in his cell, staring at the wall. His solicitor is arguing diminished responsibility due to a 'narcissistic academic fixation'. The shrinks are having a field day. We\u2019ve got more psychological reports than witness statements.\u201d He sighed, the sound of a man who longed for a simple breaking-and-entering case. \u201cAt least with Agnes Vale, the malice was straightforward. She wanted to hurt people. Price seems to genuinely believe he was improving them.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was,\u201d Cassia said quietly, her gaze still fixed on the whiteboard. \u201cIn his own mind. He was editing them. Removing what he saw as their flaws. The problem is, his definition of a flaw was their entire existence.\u201d Her thoughts drifted to the victims. Dr. Carlisle remained lost in the silent prison of his own mind, his great library now a crime scene, its unique order a testament to the man it had broken. Eleanor Vance, however, was a different story. She had called Cassia two days ago, her voice as crisp and clear as a winter morning. She hadn't called to talk about victim support or the ongoing case; she had called to inform Cassia that she had established a private fund to ensure Dr. Carlisle received the best possible neurological care for the rest of his life. \u201cA mind like that, Inspector,\u201d she had said, her tone leaving no room for argument, \u201cis a civic resource. We don\u2019t let our historic buildings crumble, and we won't let him crumble either.\u201d The call had been a stark reminder that while some victims were shattered by a crime, others were forged by it into something harder.\n\nIt was Evans who broke the contemplative silence, his fingers flying across a keyboard. \u201cBoss, you might want to see this.\u201d His voice held a note of professional curiosity that Cassia was learning to recognise as the prelude to something strange. \u201cCorrigan just forwarded a preliminary report from city division. They\u2019ve got a DOA. Thirty-two-year-old software developer named Liam Farrell. Found by a cleaner in his apartment at the new Quay Point development. No signs of forced entry, no struggle, no apparent injuries. Pathologist is putting the preliminary cause of death as acute cardiac failure, probably stress-induced. They\u2019re calling it SADS\u2014Sudden Adult Death Syndrome\u2014and are getting ready to close the file.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo why has it landed on our desk?\u201d Coulson asked, leaning back in his chair, already weary of the inevitable answer.\n\n\u201cBecause of the responding officer,\u201d Evans said, swivelling in his chair to face them. \u201cHe was a new lad, a tech nerd before he joined the force. He noticed that Farrell\u2019s apartment was a top-of-the-line \u2018smart\u2019 home, fully automated. On a hunch, he pulled the system\u2019s environmental logs for the last forty-eight hours.\u201d Evans projected the log onto the digital whiteboard. It was a chaotic scribble of vertical lines and jagged peaks. \u201cAccording to this,\u201d he continued, tracing a line with his finger, \u201cfor the two days leading up to his death, the apartment\u2019s systems went haywire. The lights would strobe at random intervals. The temperature would fluctuate from five degrees Celsius to forty. The sound system would blast a single, high-frequency note for seconds at a time. The automated blinds would snap open and shut. The logs show it was happening for sixty seconds every fifteen minutes, around the clock. The place was a purpose-built torture chamber.\u201d He looked up at them, his eyes wide. \u201cThe house tortured him to death.\u201d\n\nThe Quay Point development was the architectural antithesis of old Blackburn. It was a gleaming temple of glass and steel, a monument to the digital economy that had been bolted onto the town\u2019s industrial carcass. Liam Farrell\u2019s apartment was on the twentieth floor, a minimalist white box with panoramic views of the very mills and canals that Gideon Price had mourned. The air inside was sterile, controlled, lacking any of the human scents of beeswax or old paper. This was a place where life was curated by an algorithm. Cassia felt a profound sense of dislocation. Her expertise was in the physical world of copper wires, rusted junction boxes, and faulty circuits you could trace with your hands. This crime was ethereal, committed by signals she couldn't see and a language she didn't speak.\n\n\u201cThe whole place is run from this,\u201d Evans said, gesturing to a sleek, black server unit humming quietly in a utility closet. \u201cThe 'Aethel' Home System. It controls everything from the coffee machine to the shower temperature. It\u2019s a closed network, supposedly unhackable from the outside. Triple-encrypted, military-grade firewall.\u201d He tapped at his tablet, his face grim. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to find a breach, a backdoor, any sign of an external intrusion. There\u2019s nothing. The firewall is completely intact. The system logs don't show a single unauthorised access attempt.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo it was a malfunction?\u201d Coulson suggested, looking around the pristine apartment as if expecting a fuse to blow. \u201cA catastrophic system failure?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Evans said, shaking his head. \u201cThe commands weren't random glitches. They were specific, deliberate, and correctly coded instructions. They were just malicious. It wasn\u2019t a malfunction. It was a perfectly executed program. According to the system, the house did exactly what it was told to do.\u201d He looked at Cassia, the implications of his discovery sinking in. \u201cWhoever did this didn\u2019t have to break in. The commands that killed Liam Farrell originated from *inside* the network. The ghost wasn\u2019t in the machine, boss. The ghost *was* the machine.\u201d\n\nCassia stood in the centre of the sterile living room, the city spread out below her like a circuit board she no longer understood. Agnes Vale\u2019s wiring had been crude but brilliant. Gideon Price\u2019s methods had been archaic but psychologically devastating. This was something else entirely. A silent, invisible killer who didn't need a workshop or a library, just a few lines of malevolent code. A murder weapon with no fingerprints, no material form, just a series of ones and zeros. The familiar, dull ache in her bones felt distant, muted, as if the analogue pain couldn't get a signal in this digital space. For the first time, Cassia Ptolomey, the sparky detective, felt the cold, creeping dread of obsolescence. She was facing a faulty circuit, and she had no idea where the wires even began.The silence in Liam Farrell's apartment was absolute, broken only by the quiet, methodical hum of the server that had orchestrated his death. Cassia felt a profound disconnect, a professional vertigo. Her instincts, honed on the physical evidence of frayed wires, jimmied locks, and the lingering scent of decay, were useless here. She was a master of analogue trauma in a world that had just presented her with a digital murder. The fault wasn\u2019t in the wiring; it was in the ones and zeros, a language she couldn't read, a current she couldn't trace.\n\nBack in their top-floor sanctuary, the mood was subdued, the initial excitement of a new case replaced by a creeping sense of inadequacy. The smart home\u2019s chaotic log was still displayed on the whiteboard, a meaningless digital scream. \"I'm out of my depth here,\" Cassia admitted, the words tasting like metal in her mouth. It wasn\u2019t a confession of weakness, but a statement of fact, a recalibration of the team's strategy. She looked at Evans, who was practically vibrating with a mixture of horror and intense professional fascination. \"This is your world, Alistair. Forget physical entry points and forensics. I need a digital footprint. Find out who built this Aethel system. Find out who wrote the original code. This wasn't a stranger throwing rocks at a window; this was an architect who knew about a secret door.\"\n\nWhile Evans plunged himself into the digital abyss of source code and developer forums, Cassia and Coulson did the legwork that felt comfortingly familiar. They visited Farrell\u2019s employer, a tech startup called 'Sentient Logic' housed in a converted mill that had been gutted and filled with glass walls, neon signs, and an espresso machine that cost more than Cassia's first car. The CEO, a man barely thirty with a designer hoodie and the overconfident patter of a TED talk, described Liam Farrell in terms that were both glowing and damning. He was their star developer, the lead architect of their most successful products, a man who could make code sing. He was also, the CEO admitted with a shrug, a \"purist\" who was notoriously difficult to work with, a man who treated inefficient code not as a problem to be fixed, but as a personal insult to be obliterated.\n\n\"Liam didn't debug; he purged,\" the CEO explained, sipping a ludicrously complicated coffee. \"If he took over a project, he'd often rip out everything that came before and start again from scratch. Said it was quicker than trying to fix someone else's 'sentimental mess'.\" The phrase landed like a dropped wrench in the quiet hum of the office. It was the voice of the critic, the dismissive verdict that had echoed through the crimes of both Agnes Vale and Gideon Price. It was the sound of a fuse being lit. Cassia and Coulson exchanged a look. They had found their point of friction. Liam Farrell hadn't just been a programmer; he'd been a ruthless editor with the power to delete people's work, and by extension, their professional identities.\n\nTheir return to the station was met with a breakthrough from Evans. He hadn't found a hack. He'd found an absence. \"The original build of the Aethel operating system had a master command sequence,\" he explained, his fingers flying across his keyboard to bring up lines of elegant, complex code on the main screen. \"It's like a secret handshake. It's not a bug; it's a developer's signature. A sort of hidden 'God Mode'. The original programmer built a back door for themselves, a way to get root access to any Aethel system, anywhere, bypassing all the security protocols.\" Evans looked at them, a hint of admiration in his voice. \"It's a beautiful piece of work. Untraceable, if you knew how to use it. A private key to the kingdom.\"\n\nThe pieces began to slot together with a chilling, inexorable logic. \"Farrell's last big project was the 'Aethel 2.0' security patch,\" Cassia said, the theory forming in her mind. \"He was a purist. He purged. He would have seen a back door not as a clever signature, but as a catastrophic security flaw.\" Evans nodded grimly, clicking a final time. \"Exactly. Work logs show that two months ago, Farrell found the sequence during a deep system audit. And he deleted it. Patched it out of existence across the entire network. He bricked the 'God Mode' key for good.\" The motive was no longer a mystery. Someone had built a secret kingdom, and Liam Farrell had not only seized the throne but had melted down the key, locking the original creator out forever.\n\nThe final connection was a formality. A quick search of Sentient Logic's employment records against the known original developers of the Aethel OS. \"Got her,\" Evans said, his voice quiet. A picture of a woman with dark, intelligent eyes and a wry smile appeared on the screen. \"Maya Sharma. One of the two founding programmers of the Aethel system. She was pushed out of the company six months ago. The reason cited in her exit review, signed by Liam Farrell, was 'an unwillingness to adapt to modern security protocols and a sentimental attachment to obsolete, inefficient code'.\" The echo was now a roar. The Collector, The Philosopher, and now\u2026 The Ghost. All of them artists of a kind, all of them geniuses in their own worlds, all of them undone by a single, devastating critique.\n\nCassia stared at the smiling face on the screen. The helplessness she had felt in the apartment was gone, burned away by the cold, clear fire of understanding. The wiring was different, the circuit was digital, but the human fault was exactly the same. \"She didn't have to hack her way in,\" Cassia said, her voice low and certain. \"She was already inside. This whole system was her house. Farrell didn't just fire her and delete a line of code. He evicted her, boarded up the windows, and changed the locks. So she found a way to turn his new, perfect house into his tomb.\" Cassia looked at her team, the task ahead now clear and terrifyingly familiar. \"We're not looking for a hacker. We're looking for a creator who has decided to un-create. Find me Maya Sharma. Find the place a ghost goes when you erase her world.\"The hunt for a ghost began not in the rain-slicked streets of Blackburn, but in the shimmering, infinite corridors of the internet, a territory where Cassia was a tourist and DS Evans was a native guide. They couldn't track Maya\u2019s digital presence because, for all intents and purposes, she didn't have one. She moved through the web like a phantom, her traces so faint and expertly covered that they were indistinguishable from background noise. For two days, Evans fell down a rabbit hole of encrypted forums, archived developer chats, and the dark web, searching for a whisper of her name or a hint of her unique coding style. He found nothing. She had built the digital world she inhabited and she knew every secret passage, every hidden bolt-hole.\n\nIt was Coulson, with his steadfast belief in the tangible world of receipts and paperwork, who provided the anchor. \u201cShe can be a ghost online, but she still has to plug her modem in somewhere,\u201d he argued, surrounded by printouts of Maya Sharma\u2019s old financial records. \u201cShe needs power. She needs a connection. And that costs money.\u201d He traced a line on a bank statement with a thick finger. \u201cFor the last six months, ever since she was forced out of Sentient Logic, there\u2019s been a regular monthly payment. A direct debit to a holding company called \u2018Northern Digital Secure Solutions\u2019.\u201d A quick search revealed the company\u2019s sole asset: a large, windowless, featureless building on an industrial estate on the far side of town. It was a co-location data centre, a place where companies rent secure, climate-controlled space to house their servers. It was an anonymous digital fortress, the perfect hiding place for a deposed queen of code.\n\nThe building itself was an architectural shrug, a grey box designed to be ignored, surrounded by high-security fencing and bristling with cameras. There would be no kicking down doors here. Cassia, Coulson, and Evans met the site manager, a nervous man who paled when he saw their warrant. He led them through cooled corridors lined with racks of humming servers, the combined drone a deafening chorus of pure data. Each locked cage contained the digital heart of a different company. \u201cSuite 3B,\u201d the manager said, pointing to a cage at the far end of a row. \u201cIt\u2019s rented to a one-woman consultancy firm. She\u2019s in there now. We see her come and go, but she keeps to herself. Very quiet.\u201d\n\nCassia looked through the mesh of the cage. Inside was a spartan setup: a single server rack, a desk, a chair, and a woman. It was Maya Sharma. She was sitting at her terminal, bathed in the cool blue light of the screen, her fingers moving with fluid, silent grace across the keyboard. She didn't look like a killer. She looked like a musician composing a symphony. She hadn't even looked up at their approach, utterly absorbed in her world of light and logic. When Cassia\u2019s voice called her name, she didn\u2019t startle. She simply finished typing a line of code, pressed \u2018enter\u2019 with a final, definitive click, and then slowly turned her chair to face them, her expression calm and unreadable.\n\n\"Detective Inspector Ptolomey,\" Maya said, her voice as cool and controlled as the air in the server room. \"I was wondering when you'd arrive. Your digital forensics team is... surprisingly persistent, if a little clumsy.\" It wasn't a boast; it was a simple observation, a master craftsman critiquing an apprentice's work. Coulson moved to open the cage door, but Maya held up a single, slender hand. \"I wouldn't,\" she said, her voice dropping a fraction but losing none of its calm authority. \"The moment this cage is breached, a daemon I uploaded to the Aethel network will activate. It's a rather elegant piece of recursive code. It will instruct every Aethel system in the country to execute a single, final command: lock all doors and windows, and set the internal temperature to its maximum setting.\" Her eyes met Cassia\u2019s. \"Liam Farrell's death will be replicated in over fifty thousand homes. A messy, inefficient, but undeniably thorough outcome. A bug report on a national scale.\"\n\nThe threat was breathtaking in its scope and its chilling, impersonal cruelty. This wasn't a bomb that could be defused; it was a line of code waiting to be executed. The site manager looked like he was about to faint. Coulson and Evans froze, their analogue training useless against a digital doomsday switch. Cassia felt a familiar coldness settle in her gut, but this time it was different. She wasn't tracing a wire to a detonator; she was facing a logic bomb, and her only tool was logic itself. She stepped forward, standing directly in front of the mesh door, so that she was the only one in Maya\u2019s line of sight.\n\n\"That's a very sentimental plan, Maya,\" Cassia said, her voice even. The word 'sentimental' hung in the air, a deliberate echo of Farrell\u2019s dismissal. A flicker of annoyance crossed Maya's face. \"It's an inefficient, messy outcome. You're a purist, a brilliant architect. You created an entire world from scratch. Your revenge on Liam was elegant. It was a closed loop, a perfectly executed piece of code with a single, desired outcome. It was art. This,\" she gestured vaguely to the world outside the data centre, \"this is just smashing the whole system with a hammer because one component failed. It\u2019s beneath you. It\u2019s what an amateur would do. It\u2019s what Liam Farrell would have accused you of doing.\u201d\n\nMaya\u2019s calm facade finally cracked. A flush of anger rose in her cheeks. \"He took my world from me! He called my creation, my elegant, secret architecture, 'obsolete'. He erased me. He deserved to be erased by the very system he thought he'd mastered.\"\n\n\"And he was,\" Cassia agreed, pressing her advantage. \"You proved your point. You demonstrated your absolute superiority. Your code beat his. Your logic was better. You won. But activating that daemon now? You lose the argument. You prove him right. You prove that your code, your 'sentimental' attachment to it, really is a danger. Your legacy won't be the woman who built the Aethel system. It won't even be the woman who executed a perfect, silent revenge. It will be the woman whose code burned down fifty thousand houses because she had a tantrum. You'll be remembered not as an architect, but as a bug.\"\n\nThe word 'bug' was the final, fatal blow. It was the ultimate insult for a programmer, the antithesis of everything they strive for. Maya Sharma stared at Cassia through the metal mesh, her face a storm of conflicting emotions. Her life's work, her entire identity, was built on the premise of elegant, perfect, functional code. The idea of her magnum opus, her final act, being remembered as a clumsy, destructive bug was a logical paradox she could not resolve. Her fingers, which had been resting on the keyboard, curled into fists. She had been out-coded, her own logic turned against her in a way she had never anticipated. With a quiet, shuddering sigh of defeat, she turned back to her terminal, typed a new line of code, and pressed \u2018enter\u2019. On the screen, a single line appeared: `DAEMON_DEACTIVATED`. The ghost had given up. The machine was quiet.",

A grey, greasy sort of wetness that clung to brickwork and seeped through the soles of sensible shoes. Sergeant Cassia Ptolomey felt it in her bones, a familiar ache that mapped the hairline fractures from a fall she\u2019d taken as a young sparky, years before the uniform. The wipers on her unmarked Mondeo fought a losing battle, smearing the drizzle and the strobing blue light against the windscreen. Another one. Another girl. The call had been terse, coded, but she knew. They all knew.\n\nThe old Jubilee Mill stood skeletal against the bruised twilight, its windows like vacant eyes. Tape, stark and yellow, barred the way. A uniformed constable, barely old enough to shave, nodded at her, his face pale and glistening. \u201cSergeant. She\u2019s\u2026 up on the third floor. The old weaving room.\u201d\n\n\u201cForensics on site?\u201d Cassia asked, her voice flat. She didn't want the answer.\n\n\u201cJust arrived. DI Coulson\u2019s up there. He said to wait for you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure he did,\u201d she muttered, pulling a pair of disposable blue gloves from her coat pocket and snapping them on. The air inside the mill tasted of rust, damp rot, and dead pigeons. It was a cathedral of decay, vast and silent but for the drip-drip-drip of water finding its way through the ruined roof. Her footsteps echoed on the concrete floor. She ignored the creaking goods lift and took the stairs, her hand skimming the cold, gritty iron of the banister. Third floor. The weaving room. Of course. She liked open spaces. She liked an audience, even if it was only the ghosts of a dead industry.\n\nThe scene was bathed in a brilliant, almost holy light. It was the first thing she noticed, the first thing that was always wrong. Standard procedure was to preserve a scene as found, but the killer\u2019s scenes were never found in darkness. A half-dozen industrial floodlights, precariously wired and clamped to rusted looms, were all aimed at the centre of the room. At the canvas.\n\nA young woman was seated on a lone, antique chair, her head tilted to one side as if listening to a secret. Her skin was the canvas. She was a tableau of impossible colour, swirls of cobalt and viridian that coiled around her limbs, intricate patterns of crimson and ochre that bloomed across her chest. It wasn't just paint. It was enamel, thick and glossy, catching the harsh light. The artist had taken her time. The air smelled faintly of linseed oil and something sharper, an acrid chemical tang that tickled the back of Cassia\u2019s throat.\n\nDetective Inspector Coulson, a man whose frame seemed perpetually hunched against a coming blow, was standing by one of the looms, his gaze fixed on the horror. \u201cCassia,\u201d he breathed, a puff of steam in the cold air. \u201cIt\u2019s her. No doubt.\u201d\n\nCassia didn't reply. She walked a slow, deliberate circle around the scene, her eyes missing nothing. The victim was barefoot. Her left foot was untouched, pale and perfect. Her right foot was a mess of smeared, half-finished red, and the toes were gone. All five of them. Neatly severed.\n\n\u201cName?\u201d Cassia\u2019s voice was a rasp.\n\n\u201cWe think it\u2019s a Holly Vance. Reported missing two days ago by her flatmate. A student at the college.\u201d\n\n\u201cA student.\u201d Cassia knelt, her gaze drawn not to the lurid artwork of the body but to the floor. Wires snaked from the floodlights to a junction box on the far wall. The wiring was a mess, a dangerous, amateurish tangle of extension leads and piggy-backed plugs. But the lights themselves were perfectly angled, creating a studio effect, eliminating shadows from the subject. Contradictions. The killer was a chaotic artist and a meticulous technician.\n\n\u201cAnything else?\u201d Coulson asked, shuffling his feet. \u201cForensics are about to do their sweep.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe power,\u201d Cassia said, pointing with her chin at the junction box. \u201cTell them not to touch that. Not yet. I want to see how it\u2019s wired.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe wiring? Cass, she\u2019s been turned into a bloody Faberg\u00e9 egg, and you\u2019re worried about the electrics?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe needed the light to work, Jim. She brought it with her. She set it up. It\u2019s part of her ritual. It\u2019s part of *her*. I want to know how she thinks.\u201d Cassia stood up, her knees cracking in protest. Her gaze fell on the young woman\u2019s face. Beneath a delicate filigree of gold paint across one cheek, her eyes were open. They were wide with a terror that time and death had failed to erase. The hatred was the one thing the killer didn't bother to paint over. She wanted them to see it. She wanted the world to see it.\n\nCassia turned away. She\u2019d been an electrician for ten years before joining the force. She understood circuits. Power in, power out. A logical flow. You could trace a fault from the symptom back to the source. This killer, this woman the papers were starting to call \u2018The Collector\u2019, defied logic. Her circuit was all wrong, a catastrophic short somewhere in her soul that was blowing fuses all over the town. Holly Vance was the third. The third girl found posed, painted, and partially disassembled. And Cassia Ptolomey knew, with a certainty that felt like ice in her gut, that she would not be the last. This wasn't just murder. It was a declaration of war, and the battleground was the bodies of the women of Blackburn.\n\nBack at the station, the air was thick with the fug of cheap coffee and quiet desperation. The incident room was a chaos of whiteboards, tangled phone cords, and stacks of files that seemed to grow of their own accord. Holly Vance\u2019s face, a smiling, vibrant graduation photo, was now pinned to the board next to the others. Chloe Ashton, a barmaid. Jessica Riley, a trainee solicitor. Three bright, promising lives, reduced to evidence bags and post-mortem reports. And freezer parts. Cassia shuddered, the thought of the toes surfacing unbidden. The pathologist\u2019s report on the first two victims had been chillingly specific. Surgically precise amputation, post-mortem. Kept, not discarded. The Collector was collecting.\n\nHer junior, DC Alistair Evans, a fresh-faced lad from Burnley with earnest eyes and an unfortunate moustache, handed her a mug of tea. It was milky and sweet, the way she hated it, but she took it anyway. \u201cAnything from the wiring, sarge?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s clever,\u201d Cassia said, staring at the board. \u201cUsed a portable generator at the first two scenes. This time, she tapped directly into the mill\u2019s mains. Bypassed the meter, ran a new feed to that junction box. It\u2019s a sparky\u2019s job. Not a professional, maybe, but someone who knows their way around a high-voltage supply. Someone who isn\u2019t afraid of it.\u201d She took a scalding sip of the tea. \u201cDid we get a list of tenants from Holly Vance\u2019s building?\u201d\n\n\u201cOn your desk,\u201d Evans said. \u201cNothing jumps out. Families, a couple of other students. We\u2019re running background now.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd friends? Social media?\u201d\n\n\u201cBeing scrubbed as we speak. She was in the university art club. That\u2019s a\u2026 a thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cAn art club,\u201d Cassia repeated, the words tasting like ash. \u201cOf course she was.\u201d It felt too obvious, like a trap. The killer was displaying her work, a grotesque public gallery. Was she hiding in plain sight, critiquing her own masterpieces in a student union bar? The audacity of it made Cassia\u2019s teeth ache. She looked at the three smiling photos. Chloe, Jessica, Holly. What was the connection? They didn\u2019t know each other. Different ages, different social circles, different parts of town. The only thing they had in common was that they were women, and that they were now dead. The wiring was faulty. She couldn\u2019t find the source.\n\nThe door to the incident room slammed open and Detective Chief Inspector Corrigan strode in. He was a bull of a man, with a face the colour of raw steak and a temper to match. He ignored the rest of the room and fixed his small, piggy eyes on Cassia.\n\n\u201cPtolomey. My office. Now.\u201d\n\nThe DCI\u2019s office was neat to the point of neurosis, a stark contrast to the man himself. He stood by the window, his back to her, looking down at the glistening streets. \u201cThree of them, Cassia. Three young women mutilated in my town. The press are having a field day. \u2018The Toe Collector\u2019. It sounds like something out of a penny dreadful. They\u2019re making her a bloody folk hero.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s no hero, sir,\u201d Cassia said, her voice tight.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need your commentary, I need a result!\u201d Corrigan spun around, his face mottled with fury. \u201cI\u2019ve got the Chief Constable on the phone every hour, asking why a former electrician is leading the hunt for a serial killer. I keep telling him you have a unique insight. A different perspective.\u201d He leaned over his desk, his bulk threatening to splinter the wood. \u201cStart having some unique insights that lead to a bloody arrest, or I\u2019ll find someone who sees things the old-fashioned way.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re chasing a ghost, sir. There\u2019s no DNA, no prints, no witnesses. She\u2019s meticulous.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen be more meticulous!\u201d he roared. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a faulty light switch, Ptolomey! You can\u2019t just jiggle the wires until it works! Rip this town apart, I don\u2019t care. I want a name on my desk by the end of the week.\u201d\n\nCassia stood her ground, her jaw set. \u201cAnd if we don\u2019t have one?\u201d\n\nCorrigan\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cThen you\u2019ll be back on traffic duty, writing parking tickets. Maybe you\u2019ll have better luck finding a pattern there.\u201d\n\nShe left his office without another word, the threat hanging in the air. The pressure was no longer just a creeping dread; it was a physical weight, a hand squeezing her throat. Back in the incident room, she ignored the sympathetic glances from her team and walked to her desk. It was buried under files, photos, and forensic reports. Chloe. Jessica. Holly. She picked up the file for the first victim, Chloe Ashton. A barmaid, found in an abandoned textile warehouse six weeks ago. Cassia started reading again, from the very beginning. The list of personal effects found at her flat. Clothes, books, makeup, laptop. A receipt from a pharmacy. A flyer for a yoga class. A half-finished painting on an easel in her spare room. Wait. She frowned, flipping through the pages. The crime scene report for Jessica Riley. Personal effects. A half-eaten takeaway. A stack of legal textbooks. A flyer for a new caf\u00e9 opening. A half-finished watercolour of a canal boat on her kitchen table.\n\nHer heart started to beat a little faster. She grabbed the preliminary list from Holly Vance\u2019s flat, still warm from the printer. She scanned down the page. Bills. A library book. A flyer for a local theatre production. And there it was. Item 14: \u2018Sketchbook and box of charcoal pencils on bedside table.\u2019\n\nThey weren\u2019t just in an art club. They weren\u2019t just the canvas. They were artists themselves. Amateurs. Hobbyists. It wasn\u2019t the connection. Not the whole thing. But it was a current. A faint, low-voltage whisper in the static. And for the first time in weeks, Cassia Ptolomey felt like she\u2019d finally found a wire she could follow. The killer wasn\u2019t just destroying women. She was destroying their creativity. She was stealing their art, and then making her own. The hatred wasn\u2019t random. It was targeted. It was personal. This wasn't a monster. A monster is a myth. This was a person, twisted into something foul. A person with a reason. And Cassia would find it."

Evans jumped, slopping tea onto his hand. Coulson looked up from a map he was studying, his eyebrows raised.\n\n\u201cAlistair,\u201d Cassia\u2019s voice was clipped, energised. \u201cForget social media for a minute. I want every art class, every evening course, every amateur painting group in Blackburn and the surrounding towns for the past five years. I want membership lists, tutors, attendees. Cross-reference them with our victims. All three of them.\u201d\n\n\u201cArt classes, sarge?\u201d Evans asked, wiping his hand on his trousers. \u201cYou think she\u2019s in one?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Cassia said, striding over to the main whiteboard and wiping a section clean with the sleeve of her coat. \u201cI think our victims were. Chloe Ashton had an easel set up. Jessica Riley was painting watercolours. Holly Vance had a sketchbook. They were all hobbyists. Dabblers. Our killer isn\u2019t just killing women. She\u2019s killing artists. Or at least, women who are trying to be.\u201d She turned to face the room, her eyes burning with a cold fire. \u201cThis isn\u2019t random. It\u2019s a critique. A final, fatal review. Find me the link. Find me the place where they might have shown their work, or taken a class, or bought their supplies. Find me the common ground where our three budding artists might have crossed paths with a failed one.\u201d\n\nDI Coulson pushed himself away from the map table, a glimmer of something other than exhaustion in his eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s thin, Cass.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s more than we had an hour ago,\u201d she retorted. \u201cAn hour ago we were looking for a monster. Now, we\u2019re looking for a person. A bitter, jealous, talented person who knows her way around a fuse box and a colour wheel. She thinks she\u2019s a genius, and she\u2019s angry that no one else sees it. She\u2019s punishing these women for daring to create, for their simple, harmless joy in making something. It\u2019s the worst kind of envy. The kind that curdles into hate.\u201d\n\nCassia left the team to their new, monumental task. The frantic energy of the discovery was already fading, replaced by the gnawing need to see, to understand. She needed to look at their art. Not as evidence, but as they had intended it. She signed out the keys to the first victim\u2019s flat. Chloe Ashton. The barmaid. The first canvas. The building was a grim, 1970s block overlooking a patch of sodden grass. The police tape on the door was faded, the official seal brittle. Inside, the air was stale, a time capsule of a life cut short. It smelled of lavender air freshener and old takeaway.\n\nIn the spare room, just as the report had stated, was the easel. The half-finished painting was a landscape, a view of Darwen Tower from the moors. It was\u2026 okay. The perspective was a little off, the colours of the heather a bit muddy, but there was a warmth to it. A genuine attempt to capture a moment of beauty in a grey world. It was hopeful. Naive, even. Cassia ran a gloved finger over the untouched part of the canvas, the rough, blank texture waiting for a colour that would never come. This was what the killer had seen. This simple, unpretentious effort. And her reaction had been to snatch the life from the person who made it, to mock their gentle ambition by turning their own body into a grotesque, screaming masterpiece of technical brilliance and utter depravity.\n\nShe stood there for a long time, in the silent, sad little room, the landscape of the painting a stark contrast to the urban decay outside the window. The ache in her bones flared, a dull throb that echoed the deeper ache in her soul. She wasn't just chasing a killer anymore. She was hunting a critic. And the reviews were getting worse. The circuit was still a mess, but she could feel the heat from it now. It wasn't a cold case, a logical puzzle of inputs and outputs. It was a live wire, spitting and arcing in the dark, and she knew she was getting closer to touching it. The only question was whether she could earth the fault before it surged again, before it claimed another fuse."

Cassia saw the town not as a collection of streets and buildings, but as a vast, faulty circuit board. The murders were power surges, blowing through the lives of unsuspecting components. Her job was to trace the wiring back to the corrupted source. Chloe\u2019s painting, so full of hesitant optimism, had been the key. It wasn\u2019t just a clue; it was a statement of intent from the victim, an echo of a life that the killer had tried to silence completely. The Collector hadn\u2019t just stolen a life; she had stolen a nascent dream and twisted it into a nightmare.\n\nBy the time she returned to the station, the grim energy of the initial discovery had curdled into the low-grade, caffeinated slog of a major investigation going nowhere fast. DC Evans looked up as she entered, his youthful face etched with fatigue. A mountain of printouts sat on the table in front of him, a paper representation of the impossible task she\u2019d set them. He looked like a man trying to empty the ocean with a teaspoon.\n\n\u201cSarge. We\u2019ve got lists from twenty-three different art groups, evening classes, and community workshops going back five years,\u201d he said, his voice flat with exhaustion. \u201cWe\u2019re talking hundreds of names. We\u2019ve started cross-referencing, but Chloe Ashton and Jessica Riley don\u2019t seem to have ever attended the same class. We haven\u2019t even properly started on Holly Vance\u2019s potential overlaps yet. The Venn diagrams are coming up empty.\u201d\n\nCassia nodded, unsurprised. She dumped her wet coat over the back of her chair and stared at the whiteboard, at the three smiling faces that now seemed to mock their efforts. \u201cYou\u2019re thinking about it like a cop, Alistair. You\u2019re looking for a direct connection, a shared space. Think like an artist. Or a critic. She\u2019s not their classmate.\u201d She picked up a dry-wipe marker, the squeak on the board making Evans wince. \u201cShe\u2019s their audience.\u201d\n\nShe drew three circles on the board, labelling them C, J, and H. She left them separate, with no overlapping sections. \u201cThey don't have to have been in the same room. They just needed to be visible. To her. They put their art out there, somewhere. Or they were about to. Where do amateurs show their work? Where do they compete? Not just classes. Think bigger. Exhibitions. Local competitions. Fairs.\u201d\n\nCoulson, who had been on the phone, his voice a low, placating murmur, hung up and walked over. \u201cThe DCI\u2019s getting itchy, Cass. He wants to see the wires, not the theory.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is the theory that will show us the wires, Jim,\u201d she said, not taking her eyes off the board. \u201cAlistair, change the search parameters. Look for annual events. Competitions. Get me lists of entrants, not just attendees. Find me a stage where our three victims put themselves on display.\u201d\n\nThe hours bled into one another. The fug of stale coffee was joined by the smell of microwaved curries and burnt toast. The incident room became a pressurised chamber of quiet, frantic work. Cassia felt the old familiar ache in her bones settle into a deep, rhythmic throb, a metronome marking the time the killer had to find her next subject. She went through the victims\u2019 files again, looking for anything she\u2019d missed. She read the pathologist's notes on the amputations until the clinical language became meaningless, just words on a page. Post-mortem. No defensive wounds. The toes were not at the scene. They were trophies. A collection.\n\nIt was almost 3 a.m. when Evans\u2019s voice, hoarse with a mixture of fatigue and excitement, cut through the quiet hum of computer fans. \u201cSarge. I think I\u2019ve got it.\u201d\n\nCassia was at his side in an instant, Coulson looming behind her. On the screen was a website, its design cheap and cheerful, for an event called the \u2018Lancashire Amateur Artist of the Year\u2019. It was a yearly competition, culminating in a week-long exhibition at the Blackburn Museum and Art Gallery. Evans scrolled through an archived page from two years ago. \u201cThere. Entrant list. Chloe Ashton. She submitted a landscape. \u2018Darwen Tower at Sunset\u2019.\u201d\n\nCassia\u2019s breath caught in her throat. The very painting on the easel. \u201cKeep going.\u201d\n\nEvans clicked another link. Last year\u2019s competition. \u201cJessica Riley. Submitted a watercolour. \u2018Canal Life at Eanam Wharf\u2019.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd Holly Vance?\u201d Cassia asked, her voice barely a whisper.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the thing,\u201d Evans said, tapping a final key. He brought up a screenshot of Holly\u2019s laptop desktop, taken by the forensics team. A file sat there, an application form. \u2018LAAOTY_2023_Entry_Form.docx\u2019. \u201cShe was in the middle of filling it out when she was taken. She was going to enter this year.\u201d\n\nThe room was silent. It wasn\u2019t a class. It was a competition. A public declaration of their artistic ambition. Chloe and Jessica had been contestants. Holly was about to be. They had put their creative, hopeful souls on a public stage to be judged. And someone had judged them. Harshly. The connection wasn\u2019t just a wire; it was a high-voltage cable, humming with lethal potential.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a hunting ground,\u201d Coulson breathed, staring at the screen. \u201cShe\u2019s not finding them by chance. She\u2019s shopping for them.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s not just shopping,\u201d Cassia corrected, her mind racing, the pieces clicking into place with the satisfying certainty of a circuit breaker resetting. \u201cShe\u2019s eliminating the competition. Or what she perceives as competition. Alistair, I need to know everything about this event. Who organises it? Who are the judges? And more importantly, give me a list of every single person who has entered for the last five years and never won. Especially the ones who enter year, after year, after year.\u201d\n\nThe search narrowed, became focused. The organiser was a man named Julian Finch, the owner of a small, private gallery in the town centre. He was also the head judge. The lists of entrants were a public record, posted on the competition\u2019s website. Cassia stared at the names, scrolling back through the years. Dozens of them. Hopefuls. Hobbyists. Dreamers. And somewhere among them, a killer.\n\n\u201cWe start with Finch,\u201d Cassia declared, grabbing her coat. The rain had finally stopped, leaving the pre-dawn streets slick and black, reflecting a sky the colour of a fading bruise. \u201cShe needs supplies. Enamel paints. Linseed oil. Specific things. A gallery owner would know who buys that stuff. He'd know the serious amateurs from the dabblers.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt this hour, Cass?\u201d Coulson asked, though he was already pulling on his own jacket.\n\n\u201cShe works at night, Jim,\u201d Cassia said, her hand on the door. \u201cSo do we.\u201d The fatigue had vanished, burned away by a surge of adrenaline. She was no longer just tracing the fault. She could hear the buzz of the live wire, feel the heat radiating from it. She was getting close enough to touch it."

He was a tall, slender man in a silk dressing gown, his silver hair artfully tousled, his face a mask of weary annoyance.\n\n\u201cDetective Inspector,\u201d he said, his voice a cultivated baritone that seemed to resent being used before breakfast. \u201cTo what do I owe this\u2026 unspeakably early pleasure?\u201d He barely glanced at Cassia, his eyes dismissing her as part of the operational drabness.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re here about the murders, Mr. Finch,\u201d Coulson said, stepping inside, his solid presence an affront to the gallery\u2019s delicate emptiness. \u201cHolly Vance. Chloe Ashton. Jessica Riley.\u201d\n\n\u201cA terrible business. A tragedy for the arts community,\u201d Finch said, gesturing vaguely. \u201cI knew the names, of course. From the competition. Such\u2026 enthusiastic amateurs.\u201d The condescension dripped from the last two words. \u201cI\u2019ve already given a statement to one of your constables.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not here for a statement, Mr. Finch. We\u2019re here for your expert opinion,\u201d Cassia cut in, her flat tone silencing him. She walked past him, her boots loud on the polished concrete floor. \u201cThe killer is an artist. A very, very good one, technically speaking. She favours enamels. She has a flair for dramatic lighting. Who buys that kind of material locally? Who has that kind of skill set?\u201d\n\nFinch bristled at her directness. \u201cMy dear Sergeant, enamel is a specialist medium. And anyone with a plug can create dramatic lighting. I deal in fine art, not hobbyist supplies. There\u2019s an art shop on the market, they might be able to help you.\u201d He was already turning away, eager to usher them out.\n\n\u201cChloe and Jessica both entered your competition,\u201d Cassia pressed, stopping him in his tracks. \u201cHolly Vance was about to. This isn\u2019t a coincidence. The killer is using your event as a catalogue.\u201d\n\nFinch went very still. The performance fell away, and for a moment, a flicker of genuine fear showed in his eyes. \u201cThat\u2019s a monstrous accusation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese are monstrous murders,\u201d Cassia countered. \u201cWe\u2019re not interested in the winners, Mr. Finch. We\u2019re interested in the losers. The ones who enter every year. The ones who think they\u2019re geniuses but never get a prize. The ones you have to let down, year after year. Who gets angry? Who makes a scene? Who is brilliant, but not brilliant enough?\u201d\n\nThe silence in the sterile white room stretched, thick and uncomfortable. Finch ran a hand through his perfect hair, dislodging it for the first time. He seemed to shrink a little, the silk robe hanging loose on his thin frame. \u201cThere are always\u2026 difficult personalities. Passion can curdle into resentment. It\u2019s the nature of art.\u201d He paused, his gaze becoming distant. \u201cThere was one. A woman. She entered for four years straight. Her technique was\u2026 astonishing. Hyper-realistic. She painted on ceramic tiles, using enamels. The level of detail was surgical, but it was utterly without life. Cold as a mortuary slab.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat was her name?\u201d Cassia\u2019s voice was low, intense.\n\n\u201cVale,\u201d Finch said, the name tasting like something unpleasant in his mouth. \u201cAgnes Vale. Her submissions were always portraits. Terribly beautiful and terribly empty. I tried to give her constructive criticism, to encourage her to find some\u2026 heart. She didn\u2019t take it well. The last time she entered, two years ago, I didn\u2019t even shortlist her. She\u2026 accused me of destroying her career. Said she would find another canvas for her talents. One that the world couldn\u2019t ignore.\u201d He shuddered. \u201cI had to ask her to leave. I haven\u2019t seen her since.\u201d\n\nThe name hung in the air of the incident room like a charged particle. AGNES VALE. Cassia wrote it in big, block letters on the whiteboard, underlining it twice. The vague shape of the ghost they were hunting had a name. The energy in the room shifted, the exhaustion replaced by a tense, focused hum. The flood of data from the art classes became a targeted stream.\n\n\u201cAgnes Vale,\u201d Evans called out from his computer half an hour later, his voice tight. \u201cGot her. Born in Blackburn, 1983. No criminal record. She\u2019s been off-grid for the last eighteen months. No credit card activity, no tax records, no benefits. It's like she fell off the face of the earth after that last competition.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat did she do before she dropped out?\u201d Cassia asked, walking over to his desk.\n\nEvans clicked through a few screens. \u201cShe had a few dead-end jobs. Cleaner, factory work\u2026 but before that, for about five years\u2026 sarge, you\u2019re not going to believe this.\u201d He turned to look at her, his eyes wide. \u201cShe was an apprentice electrician. Worked for her father\u2019s firm, Vale Electricals, until he retired.\u201d\n\nCassia felt a jolt, a strange, dissonant shock of recognition. It wasn't just a suspect anymore; it was a mirror image, distorted and grotesque. A sparky. Someone who understood circuits, power, and flow. Someone who, like her, had traded a world of wires and schematics for another calling. Only their paths had diverged catastrophically. One had chosen to uphold the law; the other to twist it into a new, horrific form of art.\n\n\u201cShe knows what she\u2019s doing,\u201d Cassia said, more to herself than anyone else. \u201cShe knows how to bypass a meter, how to rig a generator, how to wire up those floodlights without blowing every fuse in the building. She\u2019s not just a chaotic artist and a meticulous technician. She\u2019s both. The same person. The same skills.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an address,\u201d Coulson said, pointing at the screen over Evans\u2019s shoulder. \u201cNot a residence. It\u2019s a commercial property, registered to the now-defunct Vale Electricals. A lock-up. Unit 7, on the old canal-side industrial estate. She never sold it.\u201d\n\nAn isolated workshop. Near the water. Plenty of space, plenty of power, and no neighbours to hear a scream. It was perfect. The final piece of the circuit diagram slotted into place. Cassia looked at the whiteboard, at the three smiling faces, and then at the name, Agnes Vale. She could see the entire schematic now: the festering resentment, the technical skill, the artistic ambition, all wired together into a deadly, closed loop, short-circuiting into murder.\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d Cassia said, her voice cutting through the room with absolute authority. \u201cJim, get on to the DCI. I want a full briefing for an armed response unit in one hour. No sirens, silent approach. Evans, get me every schematic you can find for that industrial estate. I want to know the power grid, access points, everything. This is her workshop. Her studio. Her gallery.\u201d Cassia pulled on her coat, the familiar weight settling on her shoulders. The ache in her bones was gone, replaced by a cold, sharp certainty. She had traced the fault all the way back to the source. Now, she just had to pull the master switch before the whole system blew."

                                        "text": "The briefing room was airless and crammed with the black-clad bulk of the Armed Response Unit. They were a different breed of police; where Cassia\u2019s team ran on caffeine and intuition, these men were coiled springs of kinetic energy, smelling of weapon oil and barely suppressed aggression. They listened to Cassia with a professional stillness, their eyes, accustomed to assessing immediate, physical threats, trying to compute the strange new data she was feeding them.\n\n\u201cThe target\u2019s name is Agnes Vale,\u201d Cassia began, her voice steady and devoid of emotion. Her gaze swept over them, meeting every eye. \u201cShe is an artist, and she is an electrician. Do not treat those as separate facts. The two are intertwined. We are not just entering a suspect\u2019s hideout; we are entering her studio and her workshop. Expect the lighting to be unconventional. Expect wiring that makes no sense. Do not touch light switches. Do not assume any power source is standard or safe. She knows how to weaponise a building\u2019s nervous system. The primary threat may not be a firearm, it might be the floor you\u2019re standing on.\u201d\n\nA burly ARU lead, a man with a jaw like a breeze block, grunted. \u201cSo we watch our step. Is she considered armed and dangerous, Sergeant?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe has murdered three women and dismembered them,\u201d Cassia replied, her voice dropping a notch, the coldness in it silencing any further questions. \u201cConsider her the most dangerous person you have ever met. But our priority is containment and preservation of evidence. We go in silent. We take her alive if possible. DI Coulson and I will be on your heels. This is my scene. You are my tools. Do exactly as I say. Any questions?\u201d The room remained silent.\n\nThe convoy of unmarked cars slipped through the sleeping town like grey ghosts. There were no sirens, just the soft swish of tyres on wet tarmac and the crackle of heavily encrypted comms. They crossed the canal, the black water swallowing the reflections of the streetlights, and entered the industrial estate. It was a place of forgotten commerce, a graveyard of small enterprises. Rusted signs for scaffolding firms and wholesale plumbing supplies hung askew on corrugated fences. It was a place designed to be ignored.\n\nUnit 7 was anonymous, a tin-clad box identical to its neighbours. But as Cassia got out of the car, she saw it. A single, thick-gauge armoured cable, newer than the rest, running from a junction pole directly to the unit\u2019s side wall, bypassing the rusted meter box completely. A professional, illegal tap. Her heart hammered against her ribs. Agnes was here. She was drawing power. The beast was in its lair.\n\nThe ARU moved with a terrifying, fluid grace, melting into the shadows around the building\u2019s perimeter. The lock on the main roller door was snipped with a silent hydraulic cutter. With a low groan of metal, the door was raised just enough for them to slide under. Cassia took a deep, steadying breath, the air cold and sharp in her lungs, and followed Coulson into the darkness. The first thing that hit her was the smell. It was the same toxic cocktail from the Jubilee Mill\u2014linseed oil, enamel, and the acrid tang of chemical solvent\u2014but beneath it was something else. A cloying, metallic sweetness. The smell of old blood.\n\nEmergency lights from the ARU helmets cut sharp, mobile cones through the cavernous space. It was a workshop, meticulously organised. Tools hung on pegboards in neat silhouettes. Spools of wire in every colour and thickness were stacked on shelves. On the other side of the space, it transformed into a studio. A large, professional-grade easel stood empty. Shelves were lined with hundreds of tins of paint, arranged in a perfect chromatic scale, a rainbow of potential malice. And on a large corkboard that covered an entire wall, the investigation was laid bare from the killer\u2019s perspective.\n\nIt was a gallery of hate. There were photos of Chloe, Jessica, and Holly. Next to their smiling faces were photos of their artwork, the hopeful little paintings Cassia had only seen in evidence files. Scrawled across each one in vicious red marker were critiques. \u2018Derivative composition.\u2019 \u2018Pathetic use of colour.\u2019 \u2018No soul. No ambition. WASTE.\u2019 It was a shrine to her own sick genius, a justification for her crimes. She wasn\u2019t just killing them; she was grading them. And they had all failed.\n\nCassia tore her eyes from the board, her stomach churning. In the far corner of the unit, a section had been walled off with plasterboard, a crudely built room within a room. A heavy-duty power cable snaked across the floor and disappeared under the door. It was humming. A low, constant thrum of energy. \u201cThere,\u201d Cassia said, her voice a rasp. \u201cThat\u2019s the circuit she\u2019s hiding.\u201d\n\nTwo of the ARU officers put their shoulders to the flimsy door and it burst inwards with a crack of splintering wood. The room inside was freezing. The source of the cold and the hum was a large, walk-in freezer unit, the kind used by butchers. Its thick, insulated door was secured with a heavy industrial padlock. But it wasn\u2019t the freezer that made Cassia\u2019s blood run cold. It was the walls. They were covered, floor to ceiling, with exquisitely detailed anatomical drawings. Sketches of feet. Hundreds of them, rendered with the cold precision of a medical textbook. And hands. And faces. It was a library of future work.\n\nWhile one of the officers used bolt cutters on the padlock, Cassia\u2019s gaze fell on a small workbench in the corner. On it, a single, antique porcelain doll\u2019s foot sat in a vice. It was partially painted in a familiar shade of crimson. Agnes was practising. Honing her technique on a substitute before moving on to a living canvas. The level of detached, obsessive preparation was more terrifying than any act of frantic violence. The padlock snapped. Coulson, his face pale and grim, pulled open the heavy freezer door.\n\nA wave of refrigerated air washed over them, thick with the smell of death. It was exactly as Cassia had feared, but infinitely worse. On stainless steel shelves, arranged with the sterile precision of a museum exhibit, were the trophies. The toes of Chloe Ashton, Jessica Riley, and Holly Vance. Each set of five was encased in a clear block of resin, polished to a glass-like sheen. Each block was on its own small, labelled plinth, like a piece of precious sculpture. \u2018Exhibit A: Chloe A.\u2019 \u2018Exhibit B: Jessica R.\u2019 \u2018Exhibit C: Holly V.\u2019 It was a gallery of stolen parts.\n\nBut the horror didn\u2019t stop there. On the next shelf down, a fourth plinth sat waiting. It was empty, but a neatly printed label was already in place. It read: \u2018Exhibit D.\u2019 And next to it, pinned to the freezer\u2019s interior wall, was a new photograph. A smiling, confident young woman with dark, curly hair, captured laughing outside the Blackburn Art Shop. She was holding a bag of supplies. Underneath the photo, a single word was written in that same, vicious red ink. \u2018Pretentious.\u2019\n\nDI Coulson swore, a low, guttural sound of pure dread. Cassia just stared, the ice in her gut solidifying into a block of cold, hard certainty. They had found the studio. They had found the gallery. They had found the killer\u2019s soul, laid bare in all its monstrous, obsessive detail. But they had not found the killer. Agnes Vale wasn\u2019t there. She was out. The empty plinth wasn\u2019t a plan; it was a promise. The fault hadn't been earthed. The circuit was still live. And somewhere out in the sleeping town, a fourth girl had just been moved from a shopping list to a death warrant."

It leeched the warmth from the air and the hope from the room, leaving behind a vacuum filled only by the sight of that fourth, empty plinth. The label, \u2018Exhibit D\u2019, was not a clue; it was a tombstone waiting for a name. DI Coulson let out a string of quiet, venomous curses, the words swallowed by the insulated walls of Agnes\u2019s horrific little gallery. The ARU officers, men trained for firefights and bomb threats, stood frozen, their tactical gear suddenly seeming inadequate against a horror so meticulously curated. This was not the chaotic aftermath of violence; this was a statement of profound and patient evil.\n\nCassia didn't speak. She felt the name Agnes Vale burn itself into her memory, no longer just a suspect but a dark reflection. An electrician. A woman who had walked a similar path of wires and logic, but whose circuit had broken in a way Cassia could barely comprehend. She saw the schematic clearly now: the failed ambition, the technical skill, the roaring furnace of envy, all meticulously wired together to create this monstrous output. She reached out and, with a gloved finger, gently touched the photo of the new girl, the intended \u2018Exhibit D\u2019. The laughing face was a spark of life in a chamber of death, and Cassia felt a surge of cold, protective fury that was more potent than any fear.\n\nBack at the station, the atmosphere had transformed. The sluggish, weary slog was gone, replaced by the frantic, high-frequency energy of a race against a ticking clock. The photo of the unknown woman was on every screen, a ghost they had to find before she became one for real. DCI Corrigan stormed into the incident room, his face no longer mottled with rage but tight with a new, grim purpose. He looked at the photo, then at the empty plinth Cassia had insisted on bringing back, and finally, his gaze settled on her. The usual animosity in his eyes was replaced with something that looked almost like respect, or at least a desperate reliance.\n\n\u201cThe Chief Constable just called,\u201d Corrigan said, his voice a low growl that cut through the noise. \u201cHe asked me if the former electrician was still jiggling the wires. I told him she\u2019d found the whole damn power station.\u201d He jabbed a thick finger towards Cassia. \u201cThis is yours, Ptolomey. All of it. You know how she thinks. You know what she can do. I don't care what you need or who you have to tread on. Find this girl. Find Vale. End this. Now.\u201d The threat was gone, replaced by a command that was also a plea. For the first time, Corrigan wasn't fighting her; he was arming her.\n\nWhile Evans and the rest of the team worked feverishly to identify \u2018Exhibit D\u2019\u2014sending officers to the art shop, running the image through facial recognition databases, cross-referencing with local college records\u2014Cassia stood before a massive map of Blackburn that had been pinned to the wall. She wasn't just looking at streets and landmarks. She was trying to see the city\u2019s unseen skeleton, its nervous system. She had Coulson pull up schematics of the electrical grid, old ones from the council archives. She overlaid them on the map, marking the locations of the three murders and Agnes\u2019s workshop with red pins.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s not random, Jim,\u201d she murmured, tracing a line on the plastic overlay with a dry-erase marker. \u201cThe Jubilee Mill, the warehouse, Holly\u2019s body at the weaving room\u2026 they\u2019re all old industrial sites. Places with heavy-duty power infrastructure. Places a sparky would know about.\u201d She stepped back, her eyes narrowed. The red pins weren\u2019t a random scattering. They formed a distinct, deliberate pattern. \u201cThey\u2019re all connected to the old industrial feeder line. The one that used to power the looms when this town actually made things. Her father\u2019s firm would have worked on it for decades. She knows it like the back of her hand. She\u2019s not just finding locations; she\u2019s following a circuit.\u201d\n\n\u201cSarge!\u201d Evans\u2019s voice cracked with a breakthrough. \u201cWe\u2019ve got her. The girl in the photo. Name\u2019s Sarah Jenkins. She\u2019s a textile design student at the college. The art shop owner recognised her, said she\u2019d been in yesterday afternoon buying specialist dyes.\u201d He typed furiously, bringing her details up on the main screen. \u201cLives alone in a flat just off the town centre. We sent a unit. No answer. Neighbours haven\u2019t seen her since yesterday. Her car is gone.\u201d The words hung in the air, each one another shovelful of dirt on a grave that wasn't yet filled.\n\nThe final piece slotted into place with a sickening click. A textile student. Another creator, another young woman daring to make art. Cassia turned back to her map, her mind racing. Sarah Jenkins was already gone. Agnes had her. She was setting up her new studio right now. Cassia\u2019s eyes scanned the path of the old feeder line, past the mill, past the warehouse, looking for the next logical point in the sequence. And then she saw it. A place so obvious, so poetically perfect for Agnes\u2019s grand, terrible design that a shiver traced its way down Cassia\u2019s spine.\n\nIt was a disused electrical substation, right on the canal. A brick fortress built to contain and control immense power, now decommissioned and left to rot. It was isolated, it was secure, and it was a temple to the very force Agnes had mastered. It was the heart of the old industrial circuit. A place to make a final, shocking statement. A place to turn a woman into a masterpiece using the very power that once drove the town. \u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d Cassia said, her voice ringing with absolute conviction. \u201cThe old canal substation. That\u2019s where she is.\u201d\n\nShe didn\u2019t wait for an argument. She was already grabbing her coat, the weight of it a familiar comfort. Coulson was right behind her, shouting into his radio, scrambling the ARU. The mood was different this time. They weren\u2019t raiding an empty workshop. They were racing towards an active performance, a private exhibition that could turn lethal at any second. As Cassia slid into the passenger seat of the unmarked car, the first strobes of blue light began to paint the wet streets. She stared ahead into the darkness, ignoring the ache in her bones, ignoring the churning in her gut. She could feel the current humming, the circuit reaching its catastrophic peak. She had found the fault, and now she was heading straight for the arc."

                                        "text": "The old substation rose from the canal-side mist like a blunt, brick tombstone. Its windows were high, narrow slits, bricked up long ago, making it a blind, featureless monolith. But it wasn't dead. A low, resonant hum vibrated in the air, a sound Cassia felt more than heard, travelling through the soles of her boots. It was the song of stolen electricity, a deep-throated chorus of immense power being drawn from the grid and contained within those walls. A single, thick armoured cable, identical to the one at the workshop, snaked out of a manhole cover and disappeared into a newly drilled hole in the brickwork, a black artery feeding the monster within.\n\nThe ARU team fanned out, their movements economical and silent, their black gear absorbing the faint moonlight. The team lead looked at Cassia, his helmet-mounted camera glinting. \"Doors are reinforced steel. No easy entry.\"\n\n\"She won't have used the doors,\" Cassia said, her eyes scanning the building's structure, thinking not like a cop but like a tradeswoman looking for an access point. \"She needs to get her equipment in, but she's paranoid. She'll have made her own way.\" Her gaze followed the new power line. It ran alongside a fat, rusted drainage pipe. Above it, ten feet up, was a metal grille covering a ventilation shaft. The grille was slightly askew, one corner bent outwards. \"There. The ventilation shaft. It'll lead down into the main transformer hall.\"\n\nIt was a risk. A dark, confined space that could be easily booby-trapped. But it was the only way in that didn't involve a battering ram, which would give Agnes all the warning she needed. While the ARU deployed a lightweight ladder, Cassia conferred with Coulson in a low whisper. \"When we get in, the lights go off. All of them. She needs light to work; it's her stage. Plunge her into darkness, and we take away her power. Literally.\" She pointed to the junction pole down the embankment. \"There's a manual cut-off on that pole. Once I give the signal, I want you to have someone kill the feed. It'll cut the mains to the whole block, but it'll cut her illegal tap too.\"\n\nCoulson nodded, his face grim. \"And what's the signal?\"\n\n\"You'll know,\" she said, her expression hardening as she looked up at the dark maw of the ventilation shaft.\n\nClimbing the ladder and squeezing into the shaft felt like entering a coffin. The air was thick with the dust of decades and the metallic tang of ozone. The low hum of the substation grew louder, vibrating through the metal ductwork until it was a physical pressure against her ears. After twenty yards, the shaft opened onto a mesh catwalk high above a cavernous space. Cassia peered down through the grate. Her breath caught in her chest. It was exactly as she had pictured, and a thousand times worse. The transformer hall was vast, a cathedral of decaying technology. But in the centre, Agnes Vale had built her theatre. A dozen floodlights were clamped to the old steel gantries, all focused on a single point, creating a pool of brilliant, sterile white light. And on the stage, Sarah Jenkins was bound to a heavy wooden chair, her face a mask of silent, weeping terror. She was alive. She was awake.\n\nBefore her, a woman knelt, her back to the catwalk. She was dressed in practical, paint-spattered overalls, her dark hair tied back severely. This was Agnes. In one hand, she held a delicate paintbrush; in the other, a small pot of vibrant, glossy blue. She was working on Sarah\u2019s arm, her movements precise and utterly absorbed, like a watchmaker assembling a delicate movement. She was humming softly, the sound lost in the greater hum of the transformers. Around the central tableau, the scene was a chaotic web of wires. Extension leads snaked across the floor, daisy-chained into overloaded sockets that were plugged into a makeshift distribution board wired directly into the substation\u2019s main busbars. It was a monstrous, beautiful fire hazard, a tangle of genius and insanity. Cassia saw it instantly: the sheer, reckless arrogance of the setup. Agnes hadn't just tapped the power; she had harnessed the dragon, convinced of her absolute mastery over it.\n\nCassia keyed her radio, her voice a barely audible whisper. \"All units hold. Do not engage. I'm going down. I'm going to talk to her.\"\n\n\"Cassia, no!\" Coulson's voice crackled in her ear. \"That's a negative. Wait for my signal to cut the power.\"\n\n\"If you cut the power now, she panics,\" Cassia hissed back. \"Look at that wiring. A surge, a short circuit... that whole place could go up. She's wired Sarah into it. Look at her feet.\" Cassia\u2019s torch beam found the base of the chair. Sarah\u2019s bare feet were not on the concrete. They were in two shallow, metal trays filled with water. Wires ran from the overloaded distribution board and were clipped to the side of each tray. It was a crude, horrifyingly effective circuit. A switch, a surge, and Sarah would be the fuse. \"She's not just the canvas, Jim. She's the kill switch. I have to talk her down. On my mark.\"\n\nBefore Coulson could protest, she swung her legs over the side of the catwalk and dropped the ten feet to the concrete floor below, landing with a practiced roll that absorbed the impact. The sound, small as it was, cut through Agnes's concentration. She rose slowly, turning not with a start, but with a languid, irritated grace, like a genius interrupted. Her face was sharp and intelligent, her eyes a pale, piercing grey. There was no madness in them, only a chilling, absolute certainty. She looked at Cassia, taking in the police vest, and then she smiled. It was a thin, dismissive smile.\n\n\"A critic,\" Agnes Vale said, her voice calm and clear. \"I suppose it was inevitable. Come to review the work in progress?\"\n\n\"I'm here to shut you down, Agnes,\" Cassia said, taking a slow step into the pool of light. She kept her hands open and visible. \"It's over.\"\n\n\"Over?\" Agnes laughed, a short, sharp bark of contempt. \"My dear, I'm only just getting started. The others were just studies. This...\" she gestured towards the weeping Sarah, \"...this is the beginning of my major phase. I'm finally working with a medium that has some life in it. You have to be so careful not to break them before the work is complete.\"\n\n\"They weren't just material, Agnes. They were people,\" Cassia said, her voice low and even. She had to keep the circuit stable, prevent a surge of emotion. \"Chloe Ashton painted landscapes. Jessica Riley liked boats.\"\n\n\"They had hobbies,\" Agnes sneered, the word dripping with venom. \"They were amateurs, scribbling their pathetic little feelings and calling it art. They clogged up the world with their mediocrity. They were praised for their 'enthusiasm'. While I...\" Her voice tightened, the first crack in the cold facade. \"...I have perfect technique. I have vision. And I was dismissed. Told to find some 'heart'.\" She spat the word out. \"I am giving them truth. I am giving them beauty that is terrible and perfect. Something they can't ignore.\"\n\nCassia took another step, her eyes flicking to the tangle of wires on the floor, tracing the paths, assessing the load. It was a work of insane brilliance, but it had a flaw. A single point of failure. \"You're an electrician, Agnes. So was I. We understand how things work. Power in, power out. But your circuit is wrong. It's overloaded. You're going to blow a fuse.\"\n\nFor the first time, a flicker of interest showed in Agnes's eyes. \"You were a sparky?\" The contempt lessened slightly, replaced by a kind of professional curiosity. \"Then you, of all people, should appreciate this. The control. The raw power, shaped by my will. This building was the heart of the town's industry. I've given it a new purpose. I've turned it into a gallery. My gallery.\"\n\n\"You've turned it into a bomb,\" Cassia said bluntly. Her eyes met Sarah's, trying to convey a silent message of hope. \"And you've wired a young woman to the detonator. That's not control, Agnes. That's desperation. That's a fault you can't fix.\"\n\nAgnes\u2019s face tightened. \"It is a failsafe. To protect the art from interruption.\"\n\nCassia saw her opening. It was a single, frayed extension cord, plugged into the very heart of the distribution board and snaking away towards a bank of high-intensity sodium lamps Agnes was using for ambient colour. The cord was old, the insulation cracked, and it was lying in a small puddle of water from a leaking roof pipe. It was the weakest link. The point of catastrophic failure.\n\n\"You're right about one thing,\" Cassia said, her voice dropping, becoming almost conspiratorial. She took one last, deliberate step, putting herself between Agnes and the frayed wire. \"They couldn't see the genius in the wiring.\" She nodded towards the board. \"It's a masterpiece of improvisation. But you've overloaded the primary busbar feed. The resistance on that gauge of wire... you're pulling nearly 200 amps through a system designed for 100. It's beautiful, but it's going to burn.\"\n\nAgnes frowned, her artist's pride stung by a technical critique. She took the bait. Her eyes left Cassia, flicking to the distribution board, mentally re-calculating the loads, the doubt planted. In that instant of distraction, Cassia dropped to one knee. She didn't draw her weapon. She reached for a heavy rubber-handled wrench left on the floor from Agnes's setup. With a single, fluid movement, she swung it down, not at Agnes, but at the puddle of water, driving the frayed, live extension cord deep into it.\n\nThe effect was instantaneous and spectacular. There was a deafening CRACK-BOOM as the water flashed to steam and the overloaded circuit shorted out. A shower of brilliant blue and white sparks erupted from the distribution board. The floodlights, the sodium lamps, the entire magnificent theatre of light died in a split second, plunging the vast hall into absolute, terrifying darkness. The deep hum of the transformers was replaced by a sudden, profound silence, broken only by Sarah Jenkins's ragged gasp.\n\nIn the disorienting blackness, Cassia didn't hesitate. \"NOW!\" she roared into her radio, the signal for Coulson.\n\nAgnes screamed, a sound of pure fury and thwarted ambition. She was blinded, her masterpiece ruined, her stage gone dark. The ARU team, equipped with night-vision, stormed the hall from three directions, a whirlwind of disciplined violence. Red laser dots danced across the space, converging on the screaming, thrashing silhouette. Cassia scrambled towards the chair, using her small torch to find her way. Sarah was shaking uncontrollably, and Cassia\u2019s hands, sure and steady, found the clips on the metal trays and ripped them off, breaking the circuit for good. She wrapped her coat around the girl's trembling shoulders. \"It's okay,\" she said, her voice rough with adrenaline. \"It's over. You're safe.\"\n\nAcross the hall, the fight was already finished. Agnes Vale, the Collector, the brilliant, twisted artist of Blackburn, was pinned to the floor under the weight of three ARU officers, her face pressed into the grimy concrete. The lights were out. The show was over. The critic had delivered her final review. As emergency lights flooded the hall with a flat, unforgiving glare, Cassia looked from the terrified, living face of Sarah Jenkins to the defeated, broken form of Agnes Vale. The faulty circuit was finally broken. The current was earthed. The terrible, humming silence that followed felt, for the first time in weeks, like peace."

It stripped the scene of all its dark theatre, revealing it for what it was: a filthy, damp industrial space littered with the tools of a deranged obsession. The smell of burnt plastic and ozone from the short-circuited board was thick and acrid, a chemical post-mortem on the death of Agnes\u2019s grand design. Cassia kept her coat wrapped around Sarah Jenkins, a thin shield against the cold and the encroaching reality of the last few hours. The girl was shivering violently, her teeth chattering in a frantic, percussive rhythm, her wide, terrified eyes fixed on the empty space where her tormentor had knelt moments before. Paramedics moved in with a practiced, gentle efficiency, their calm voices a soothing balm in the charged air, and began to lead Sarah towards the promise of warmth and safety.\n\nDI Coulson appeared at Cassia\u2019s side, his face slick with sweat under the harsh lighting, a massive wave of relief washing the tension from his features. He looked from the departing paramedics to the tangled mess of wires at their feet, and then to Cassia, a slow shake of his head conveying a mixture of awe and profound exasperation. \u201cYou\u2019re a bloody lunatic, Ptolomey. You know that, right? A certifiable, Grade A lunatic.\u201d He let out a long, shuddering breath. \u201cThat was the single most reckless and brilliant thing I have ever seen. If it had gone wrong\u2026\u201d He didn\u2019t need to finish the sentence. They both knew the cost of failure, measured in amps and volts, was absolute.\n\n\u201cShe wired her to the mains, Jim,\u201d Cassia said, her voice flat and exhausted, the adrenaline beginning to recede, leaving a hollow ache in its wake. \u201cThere was no other way. It was her logic. I just used it against her.\u201d Her gaze was drawn across the hall, where Agnes Vale was being hauled to her feet by the ARU officers. Her face was smudged with dirt, her overalls torn at the shoulder, but her eyes, when they found Cassia\u2019s, were not filled with fear or despair. They were blazing with a pure, intellectual fury, the outrage of a master craftsman whose masterpiece has been vandalised by a philistine. As they led her past, she stopped, straining against the officers\u2019 grip.\n\n\"You,\" Agnes hissed, her voice low and venomous. \"You didn't beat my art. You didn't understand it. You just cut the power. Any fool can flip a switch.\" She stared at Cassia, a look of profound, chilling condescension on her face. \"You're not a critic. You're just another city maintenance worker, turning out the lights when the exhibition is over.\" The officers pulled her away then, her final, delusional critique echoing in the vast, empty space. Cassia didn't respond. She just watched her go, a dark, distorted reflection of her own past, a sparky who had short-circuited on the world and tried to rewire it to her own monstrous design.\n\nWith the victim safe and the killer in custody, the atmosphere in the substation shifted again. The forensics team, who had been waiting patiently outside, now moved in, their white suits stark against the grime. They began the slow, methodical process of deconstruction, turning Agnes's grand, terrible theatre back into a collection of mundane exhibits. The perfectly angled floodlights became evidence tag #47. The antique chair, #48. The pots of enamel paint, #49 through #73. The magic was gone, the horror dissected and catalogued. Cassia walked a slow perimeter of the dead stage, her eyes tracing the paths of the wires she now understood so well. Power in, chaos out. She had followed the schematic, found the inherent flaw in the design, and exploited it. It was a good piece of diagnostic work. The thought brought her no joy, only a deep, soul-crushing weariness.\n\nBack at the station, the dawn was a grey, watery smear against the windows. The fug of desperation had been replaced by the smell of relief and bacon sandwiches from the canteen. The incident room was quiet, the frantic energy replaced by the low hum of report-writing. DC Evans looked up as she walked in, his unfortunate moustache unable to hide a wide, exhausted grin. Even DCI Corrigan was there, leaning against the doorframe of his office. He caught Cassia\u2019s eye and gave a single, curt nod. It was the closest to a commendation she would ever get from him, and it was more than enough. On the main whiteboard, someone had already drawn a thick, definitive line through the name AGNES VALE. The three smiling photos of Chloe, Jessica, and Holly remained, but they seemed different now. Not just victims in a puzzle, but lives that could finally be mourned, their cases closed, their memory no longer part of an active hunt.\n\nCassia sat down at her desk, the cheap office chair groaning in protest. The ache in her bones had returned, a familiar, dull throb mapping the old hairline fractures. She looked out of the window at the town. The rain was still falling, a steady, persistent drizzle that washed the streets clean. It was the same grey, greasy wetness from the day before, but it felt different. Less like a sodden flannel, and more like a simple, honest rain. The circuit was closed, the fault was earthed, the terrible energy that had been arcing across the town finally dissipated. She was just an electrician, after all. And the lights of Blackburn, for now, were safe."

The whiteboards had been wiped clean, the frantic energy bled out of the air, leaving only the lingering smell of cold coffee and the quiet rustle of final reports being collated.

DC Evans, his moustache looking slightly less calamitous in the absence of overwhelming stress, was meticulously filing away the last of the witness statements. The great, roaring engine of the murder investigation had been throttled back to an administrative hum, the methodical and necessary process of putting the horror into a box and sealing the lid.

Cassia\u2019s final report was a dense, technical document, detailing the logic of the electrical circuits, the psychology of the unsub, the chain of deduction that had led them to the substation. It was dry, factual, and completely inadequate. It captured the what and the how, but it couldn't touch the chilling, arrogant \u2018why\u2019 that still echoed in the corners of her mind. Agnes Vale was in custody, remanded to a high-security facility, her plea yet to be entered but her guilt as certain as a sunrise. But Cassia felt an unnerving sense of an incomplete circuit. There was one last connection to be checked, one final diagnostic to be run. She needed to see her one more time, not in a storm of sparks and darkness, but under the flat, unwavering light of a formal interview.\n\nThe interview room was the architectural opposite of everything Agnes Vale created. It was a cube of oppressive grey, soundproofed and featureless, devoid of artifice or drama. It was a room designed to strip everything away, leaving only the truth. When they brought Agnes in, dressed in a standard-issue grey tracksuit that seemed to infuriate her with its lack of form and intent, she looked smaller, less formidable. But her eyes, as they locked on Cassia sitting opposite the steel table, were unchanged. They were chips of ice, burning with the same undiluted contempt, the same intellectual arrogance. The artist was deprived of her studio and her medium, but she was still convinced of her own genius. She sat, her posture ramrod straight, a queen holding court in a peasant\u2019s hovel.\n\n\u201cI was wondering when the maintenance crew would be back for a final inspection,\u201d Agnes began, her voice dripping with cultivated disdain. She didn\u2019t look at the uniformed officer in the corner or the recording equipment on the table. Her entire, ferocious attention was fixed on Cassia. \u201cHave you come to catalogue my tools? To write a tedious report on my methods? You can't possibly hope to understand my motives.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not here to understand your motives, Agnes,\u201d Cassia said, her voice calm and level. It was vital she didn't engage on Agnes\u2019s terms, not to be drawn into her world of perverse aesthetics. \u201cI\u2019m here to finalise the inventory. Your collection. The toes you took from Chloe, Jessica, and Holly. Encased in resin. Why? Why keep them?\u201d\n\nA flicker of a smile touched Agnes's lips. \u201cProof of concept. A sculptor keeps his maquettes. A writer keeps his first editions. They were the first tangible results of my new process. The most perfect part of the canvas, preserved. You wouldn't understand. It\u2019s about posterity. They were my first reviews, you see. Tangible, perfect little critiques of a world that failed to see me.\u201d She leaned forward slightly, the grey tracksuit crinkling. \"Those women, their so-called art, it was all feeling and no skill. Muddy, sentimental rubbish. I gave them form. I gave their meaningless lives a final, perfect, terrible structure. I made them important.\"\n\n\u201cTheir lives were already important,\u201d Cassia countered, her voice hardening almost imperceptibly. \u201cChloe Ashton\u2019s parents thought her life was important. Holly Vance\u2019s friends thought her life was important. The art they made was for them. It was a conversation they were having with themselves. It wasn't for you. It wasn't for anyone. You didn\u2019t just kill them, Agnes. You interrupted them. You read a stranger's diary and then burned the house down because you didn't like their handwriting.\u201d\n\nThe smile on Agnes's face vanished, replaced by a flash of raw fury. \u201cYou reduce it all to such banal domesticity! You see a circuit and you just see a light switch. You don't see the power! The potential! I was a god in those rooms. I was a creator, using the basest materials\u2014flesh and fear and electricity\u2014and I was making something eternal. And you, a common tradeswoman, came in and threw a wrench in the works. You didn\u2019t defeat me. You just broke my equipment. You are, and will always be, nothing more than a saboteur.\u201d\n\nCassia stood up, the interview concluded. She had what she needed. She had looked into the abyss and seen not a complex, misunderstood genius, but a spoiled child throwing a lethal tantrum. The circuit wasn\u2019t complex at all; it was pathetically simple. A failure of ego, shorting out into rage. \u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Cassia said, turning for the door. \u201cI am a tradeswoman. I see a faulty circuit that\u2019s a danger to the public, and I shut it down. That\u2019s the job.\u201d She paused at the door, looking back at Agnes one last time. \u201cYou weren\u2019t a god, Agnes. You were just a fault. And now you\u2019ve been repaired.\u201d She walked out, closing the door on the soundproofed grey box, leaving Agnes Vale alone with the one thing she couldn\u2019t stand: an audience of absolutely no one.\n\nDriving home that evening, the rain had finally stopped. The sky over Blackburn was a canvas of bruised purples and soft greys, the setting sun finding cracks in the cloud cover to send down pale, watery shafts of light. The streets, washed clean, gleamed. Cassia thought of Sarah Jenkins, who she'd heard had been released from hospital into the care of her family, the intricate blue enamel scrubbed from her skin, the terror slowly beginning to recede from her eyes. She thought of the three boxes of evidence from Agnes\u2019s freezer, the grotesque resin sculptures that would be handled by pathologists and psychologists, analysed for meaning before being consigned to a final, quiet resting place with the bodies they belonged to. A measure of peace. A restoration of order.\n\nThe familiar ache in Cassia\u2019s bones was still there as she unlocked her front door. It was a part of her, a permanent schematic of old damage. But for the first time in a long time, it didn\u2019t feel like a harbinger of rain or a premonition of dread. It was just an ache. A reminder that some things, once broken, never heal perfectly. They just find a new way to bear the load. She stood by her window, looking out at the town's grid of lights flickering on against the encroaching twilight. A vast, complex, and functioning circuit. For tonight, at least, all the fuses were holding. The system was stable. And the maintenance worker could finally rest."

                                        "text": "Two days later, the incident room was a ghost of its former self. The whiteboards had been wiped clean, the frantic energy bled out of the air, leaving only the lingering smell of cold coffee and the quiet rustle of final reports being collated. The faces of Chloe, Jessica, and Holly had been taken down, their images moved from the wall of active investigation to the sad, permanent archives of closed cases. DC Evans, his moustache looking slightly less calamitous in the absence of overwhelming stress, was meticulously filing away the last of the witness statements. The great, roaring engine of the murder investigation had been throttled back to an administrative hum, the methodical and necessary process of putting the horror into a box and sealing the lid. For the first time in weeks, Cassia drank a cup of tea that wasn\u2019t scalding or overly sweet; it was just a cup of tea, a small return to normalcy in a world that had been tilted on its axis.\n\nThe paperwork was a mountain, a testament in triplicate to the chaos they had clawed their way through. Cassia\u2019s final report was a dense, technical document, detailing the logic of the electrical circuits, the psychology of the unsub, the chain of deduction that had led them to the substation. It was dry, factual, and completely inadequate. It captured the what and the how, but it couldn't touch the chilling, arrogant \u2018why\u2019 that still echoed in the corners of her mind. Agnes Vale was in custody, remanded to a high-security facility, her plea yet to be entered but her guilt as certain as a sunrise. But Cassia felt an unnerving sense of an incomplete circuit. There was one last connection to be checked, one final diagnostic to be run. She needed to see her one more time, not in a storm of sparks and darkness, but under the flat, unwavering light of a formal interview.\n\nThe interview room was the architectural opposite of everything Agnes Vale created. It was a cube of oppressive grey, soundproofed and featureless, devoid of artifice or drama. It was a room designed to strip everything away, leaving only the truth. When they brought Agnes in, dressed in a standard-issue grey tracksuit that seemed to infuriate her with its lack of form and intent, she looked smaller, less formidable. But her eyes, as they locked on Cassia sitting opposite the steel table, were unchanged. They were chips of ice, burning with the same undiluted contempt, the same intellectual arrogance. The artist was deprived of her studio and her medium, but she was still convinced of her own genius. She sat, her posture ramrod straight, a queen holding court in a peasant\u2019s hovel.\n\n\u201cI was wondering when the maintenance crew would be back for a final inspection,\u201d Agnes began, her voice dripping with cultivated disdain. She didn\u2019t look at the uniformed officer in the corner or the recording equipment on the table. Her entire, ferocious attention was fixed on Cassia. \u201cHave you come to catalogue my tools? To write a tedious report on my methods? You can't possibly hope to understand my motives.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not here to understand your motives, Agnes,\u201d Cassia said, her voice calm and level. It was vital she didn't engage on Agnes\u2019s terms, not to be drawn into her world of perverse aesthetics. \u201cI\u2019m here to finalise the inventory. Your collection. The toes you took from Chloe, Jessica, and Holly. Encased in resin. Why? Why keep them?\u201d\n\nA flicker of a smile touched Agnes's lips. \u201cProof of concept. A sculptor keeps his maquettes. A writer keeps his first editions. They were the first tangible results of my new process. The most perfect part of the canvas, preserved. You wouldn't understand. It\u2019s about posterity. They were my first reviews, you see. Tangible, perfect little critiques of a world that failed to see me.\u201d She leaned forward slightly, the grey tracksuit crinkling. \"Those women, their so-called art, it was all feeling and no skill. Muddy, sentimental rubbish. I gave them form. I gave their meaningless lives a final, perfect, terrible structure. I made them important.\"\n\n\u201cTheir lives were already important,\u201d Cassia countered, her voice hardening almost imperceptibly. \u201cChloe Ashton\u2019s parents thought her life was important. Holly Vance\u2019s friends thought her life was important. The art they made was for them. It was a conversation they were having with themselves. It wasn't for you. It wasn't for anyone. You didn\u2019t just kill them, Agnes. You interrupted them. You read a stranger's diary and then burned the house down because you didn't like their handwriting.\u201d\n\nThe smile on Agnes's face vanished, replaced by a flash of raw fury. \u201cYou reduce it all to such banal domesticity! You see a circuit and you just see a light switch. You don't see the power! The potential! I was a god in those rooms. I was a creator, using the basest materials\u2014flesh and fear and electricity\u2014and I was making something eternal. And you, a common tradeswoman, came in and threw a wrench in the works. You didn\u2019t defeat me. You just broke my equipment. You are, and will always be, nothing more than a saboteur.\u201d\n\nCassia stood up, the interview concluded. She had what she needed. She had looked into the abyss and seen not a complex, misunderstood genius, but a spoiled child throwing a lethal tantrum. The circuit wasn\u2019t complex at all; it was pathetically simple. A failure of ego, shorting out into rage. \u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Cassia said, turning for the door. \u201cI am a tradeswoman. I see a faulty circuit that\u2019s a danger to the public, and I shut it down. That\u2019s the job.\u201d She paused at the door, looking back at Agnes one last time. \u201cYou weren\u2019t a god, Agnes. You were just a fault. And now you\u2019ve been repaired.\u201d She walked out, closing the door on the soundproofed grey box, leaving Agnes Vale alone with the one thing she couldn\u2019t stand: an audience of absolutely no one.\n\nDriving home that evening, the rain had finally stopped. The sky over Blackburn was a canvas of bruised purples and soft greys, the setting sun finding cracks in the cloud cover to send down pale, watery shafts of light. The streets, washed clean, gleamed. Cassia thought of Sarah Jenkins, who she'd heard had been released from hospital into the care of her family, the intricate blue enamel scrubbed from her skin, the terror slowly beginning to recede from her eyes. She thought of the three boxes of evidence from Agnes\u2019s freezer, the grotesque resin sculptures that would be handled by pathologists and psychologists, analysed for meaning before being consigned to a final, quiet resting place with the bodies they belonged to. A measure of peace. A restoration of order.\n\nThe familiar ache in Cassia\u2019s bones was still there as she unlocked her front door. It was a part of her, a permanent schematic of old damage. But for the first time in a long time, it didn\u2019t feel like a harbinger of rain or a premonition of dread. It was just an ache. A reminder that some things, once broken, never heal perfectly. They just find a new way to bear the load. She stood by her window, looking out at the town's grid of lights flickering on against the encroaching twilight. A vast, complex, and functioning circuit.

                                        "text": "Chapter 6\n\nA fortnight after the sparks died in the old substation, the silence was, in its own way, louder than the chaos had been. The incident room had been returned to its default state of low-grade operational hum, now focused on a string of catalytic converter thefts that felt both laughably mundane and blessedly simple. Cassia sat at her desk, the mountain of paperwork from the Vale case now condensed into a single, thick, book-bound report that sat on the corner of her desk like a tombstone. The press had had their field day. They had christened her \u2018The Sparky Detective,\u2019 a moniker she loathed with a quiet, burning intensity. They ran lurid, speculative pieces about her past, her methods, her supposed \u2018sixth sense\u2019 for electricity. They turned her methodical, grinding police work into a cheap superpower, missing the point as spectacularly as Agnes Vale had.\n\nDCI Corrigan\u2019s summons came, as always, like a barked command. But when she entered his neurotically neat office, the atmosphere was different. The raw steak colour had faded from his face, replaced by a weary professionalism. He didn\u2019t pace or stand with his back to her. He sat behind his desk, a rare sign of equilibrium, and gestured for her to take the chair opposite. The seat was still uncomfortable. \u201cThe Chief Constable sends his congratulations,\u201d Corrigan began, skipping the preamble. \u201cThe Home Office is interested. The press, God help us, think you\u2019re some kind of wizard. You\u2019ve made a bloody name for yourself, Ptolomey. And for me, which is a small mercy.\u201d He leaned forward, his piggy eyes fixing on her with an unreadable expression. \u201cThey want to make it official. They\u2019re floating the idea of a new unit. Small, reactive. The \u2018Atypical Crimes Taskforce\u2019 is the working title, which sounds like something out of a comic book. Essentially, when a case comes in that smells wrong, that doesn\u2019t fit the template, it goes to you. You\u2019d get your own budget. Hand-pick your own team.\u201d\n\nCassia processed the words without letting any reaction show on her face. It was everything a detective could want: autonomy, resources, the most challenging cases. It was also a gilded cage, a formalisation of her otherness. She would no longer be just a DS in the chain of command; she\u2019d be the specialist, the odd one, the woman they called when the circuits went haywire. She\u2019d be permanently on the hunt for monsters like Agnes Vale. \u201cWho would I report to?\u201d she asked, the practical question a shield against the enormity of the offer.\n\n\u201cMe,\u201d Corrigan said, with a look that managed to be both a warning and a vote of confidence. \u201cI\u2019d keep the wolves off your back. You\u2019d do the work. No more arguments about methodology. You follow the wires, wherever they lead. You want it?\u201d The question hung in the air, heavy with consequence. It was a promotion born from three dead women and a fourth who would carry the scars for the rest of her life. It was a career path paved with trauma. Cassia thought of the endless, fruitless searches, the dead ends, the feeling of chasing a ghost. Then she thought of the click of understanding when she saw the art competition lists, the cold certainty in the substation. She had found a current she could follow in the darkest of waters. To refuse would be to turn her back on the one thing she was uniquely, terribly good at. \u201cYes, sir,\u201d she said, her voice a flat, steady signal. \u201cI want it.\u201d\n\nLeaving his office, she almost collided with DI Coulson, who was hovering in the corridor. He gave her a knowing look, a slight smile touching his tired eyes. \u201cSo, you\u2019re the new queen of the weird,\u201d he said, his tone gentle. \u201cCongratulations, I think. If you\u2019re hand-picking a team, I hope you\u2019ll have a spot for an old-fashioned copper who knows how to fill out the paperwork and keep the DCI happy.\u201d Cassia felt a rare, genuine warmth spread through her chest. The thought of having Coulson\u2019s steady, grounding presence at her side made the prospect of the new unit feel less like an exile and more like a fortification. \u201cI\u2019ll need a good DI, Jim,\u201d she said, the corner of her mouth twitching into something resembling a smile. \u201cSomeone to translate my theories about faulty wiring into actual police work.\u201d His smile broadened. \u201cIt\u2019s a deal. First round of recruits should be Evans, then. The lad\u2019s been unbearable since his Venn diagrams paid off. Thinks he\u2019s a genius.\u201d\n\nThe weight of her new reality settled later that day when she went to retrieve her car. A journalist, a sharp-faced woman with an aggressively cheerful scarf, detached herself from the wall opposite the station entrance and intercepted her. \u201cSergeant Ptolomey? A quick word for the Echo? People want to know about the woman who caught the Collector. They\u2019re saying you have a unique gift\u2026\u201d The woman\u2019s words faded into a meaningless buzz in Cassia\u2019s ears. All she could see was the hunger in the reporter\u2019s eyes, the desire to package the horror into a neat, sensational story. She saw Agnes\u2019s obsession with audience, with critics, with public perception, reflected in this woman\u2019s predatory smile. \u201cNo comment,\u201d Cassia said, her voice clipped and cold as she pushed past, the simple, official phrase a shield against the intrusive questions. The encounter left a foul taste in her mouth. She wasn't a hero or a wizard. She was a police officer who had traced a fault, and the cost of that discovery was written in three morgue reports.\n\nThat night, sleep offered no refuge. She found herself back in the substation, the air thick with ozone, but this time she was strapped to the chair, the cold water rising around her ankles. Agnes Vale knelt before her, paintbrush in hand, her face a mask of serene concentration. \u201cSuch a flawed canvas,\u201d Agnes murmured, her voice echoing in the vast hall. \u201cSo many old breaks and fractures. But we can make them beautiful. We can trace the damage in gold.\u201d Cassia woke up with a jolt, her heart hammering, the phantom ache in her bones singing with a sharp, electric intensity. Agnes\u2019s final, sneering words from the interview room came back to her: \"You\u2019re just another city maintenance worker.\" Maybe she was right. Maybe Cassia didn\u2019t have a gift for finding monsters, but simply a tradeswoman\u2019s knack for spotting shoddy, dangerous work. The thought was strangely comforting. It grounded her. She wasn't a hero locked in an epic battle with evil; she was a public servant with a very specific, and very necessary, skill set.\n\nThe next day, she broke her own rule. She used her police credentials to get an update on Sarah Jenkins. The liaison officer told her that Sarah was with her family in the countryside, away from Blackburn and the prying eyes of the media. She was talking, eating, sleeping in fits and starts. She had asked her parents to throw out all her art supplies. The news hit Cassia with an unexpected force. She had saved Sarah\u2019s life, but Agnes had still succeeded in her own twisted way. She had destroyed an artist. The simple, harmless joy in making something, which Cassia had identified as the motive, had been snuffed out. The circuit of creativity had been broken. It was a partial victory, a flawed repair. It was a reminder that even when you catch the killer, you can\u2019t erase the damage. The fault lines remained, scarring the landscape, a permanent part of the town\u2019s schematic. The new unit would not be about winning. It would be about containing the damage, earthing the faults, and trying to keep the lights on for as many people as possible, for as long as possible. It was a maintenance worker\u2019s job, after all. And Cassia Ptolomey, for better or worse, was reporting for duty."

                                        "text": "A fortnight after the sparks died in the old substation, the silence was, in its own way, louder than the chaos had been. The incident room had been returned to its default state of low-grade operational hum, now focused on a string of catalytic converter thefts that felt both laughably mundane and blessedly simple. Cassia sat at her desk, the mountain of paperwork from the Vale case now condensed into a single, thick, book-bound report that sat on the corner of her desk like a tombstone. The press had had their field day. They had christened her \u2018The Sparky Detective,\u2019 a moniker she loathed with a quiet, burning intensity. They ran lurid, speculative pieces about her past, her methods, her supposed \u2018sixth sense\u2019 for electricity. They turned her methodical, grinding police work into a cheap superpower, missing the point as spectacularly as Agnes Vale had.\n\nDCI Corrigan\u2019s summons came, as always, like a barked command. But when she entered his neurotically neat office, the atmosphere was different. The raw steak colour had faded from his face, replaced by a weary professionalism. He didn\u2019t pace or stand with his back to her. He sat behind his desk, a rare sign of equilibrium, and gestured for her to take the chair opposite. The seat was still uncomfortable. \u201cThe Chief Constable sends his congratulations,\u201d Corrigan began, skipping the preamble. \u201cThe Home Office is interested. The press, God help us, think you\u2019re some kind of wizard. You\u2019ve made a bloody name for yourself, Ptolomey. And for me, which is a small mercy.\u201d He leaned forward, his piggy eyes fixing on her with an unreadable expression. \u201cThey want to make it official. They\u2019re floating the idea of a new unit. Small, reactive. The \u2018Atypical Crimes Taskforce\u2019 is the working title, which sounds like something out of a comic book. Essentially, when a case comes in that smells wrong, that doesn\u2019t fit the template, it goes to you. You\u2019d get your own budget. Hand-pick your own team.\u201d\n\nCassia processed the words without letting any reaction show on her face. It was everything a detective could want: autonomy, resources, the most challenging cases. It was also a gilded cage, a formalisation of her otherness. She would no longer be just a DS in the chain of command; she\u2019d be the specialist, the odd one, the woman they called when the circuits went haywire. She\u2019d be permanently on the hunt for monsters like Agnes Vale. \u201cWho would I report to?\u201d she asked, the practical question a shield against the enormity of the offer. \u201cMe,\u201d Corrigan said, with a look that managed to be both a warning and a vote of confidence. \u201cI\u2019d keep the wolves off your back. You\u2019d do the work. No more arguments about methodology. You follow the wires, wherever they lead. You want it?\u201d The question hung in the air, heavy with consequence. It was a promotion born from three dead women and a fourth who would carry the scars for the rest of her life. It was a career path paved with trauma. Cassia thought of the endless, fruitless searches, the dead ends, the feeling of chasing a ghost. Then she thought of the click of understanding when she saw the art competition lists, the cold certainty in the substation. She had found a current she could follow in the darkest of waters. To refuse would be to turn her back on the one thing she was uniquely, terribly good at. \u201cYes, sir,\u201d she said, her voice a flat, steady signal. \u201cI want it.\u201d\n\nLeaving his office, she almost collided with DI Coulson, who was hovering in the corridor. He gave her a knowing look, a slight smile touching his tired eyes. \u201cSo, you\u2019re the new queen of the weird,\u201d he said, his tone gentle. \u201cCongratulations, I think. If you\u2019re hand-picking a team, I hope you\u2019ll have a spot for an old-fashioned copper who knows how to fill out the paperwork and keep the DCI happy.\u201d Cassia felt a rare, genuine warmth spread through her chest. The thought of having Coulson\u2019s steady, grounding presence at her side made the prospect of the new unit feel less like an exile and more like a fortification. \u201cI\u2019ll need a good DI, Jim,\u201d she said, the corner of her mouth twitching into something resembling a smile. \u201cSomeone to translate my theories about faulty wiring into actual police work.\u201d His smile broadened. \u201cIt\u2019s a deal. First round of recruits should be Evans, then. The lad\u2019s been unbearable since his Venn diagrams paid off. Thinks he\u2019s a genius.\u201d\n\nThe weight of her new reality settled later that day when she went to retrieve her car. A journalist, a sharp-faced woman with an aggressively cheerful scarf, detached herself from the wall opposite the station entrance and intercepted her. \u201cSergeant Ptolomey? A quick word for the Echo? People want to know about the woman who caught the Collector. They\u2019re saying you have a unique gift\u2026\u201d The woman\u2019s words faded into a meaningless buzz in Cassia\u2019s ears. All she could see was the hunger in the reporter\u2019s eyes, the desire to package the horror into a neat, sensational story. She saw Agnes\u2019s obsession with audience, with critics, with public perception, reflected in this woman\u2019s predatory smile. \u201cNo comment,\u201d Cassia said, her voice clipped and cold as she pushed past, the simple, official phrase a shield against the intrusive questions. The encounter left a foul taste in her mouth. She wasn't a hero or a wizard. She was a police officer who had traced a fault, and the cost of that discovery was written in three morgue reports.\n\nThat night, sleep offered no refuge. She found herself back in the substation, the air thick with ozone, but this time she was strapped to the chair, the cold water rising around her ankles. Agnes Vale knelt before her, paintbrush in hand, her face a mask of serene concentration. \u201cSuch a flawed canvas,\u201d Agnes murmured, her voice echoing in the vast hall. \u201cSo many old breaks and fractures. But we can make them beautiful. We can trace the damage in gold.\u201d Cassia woke up with a jolt, her heart hammering, the phantom ache in her bones singing with a sharp, electric intensity. Agnes\u2019s final, sneering words from the interview room came back to her: \"You\u2019re just another city maintenance worker.\" Maybe she was right. Maybe Cassia didn\u2019t have a gift for finding monsters, but simply a tradeswoman\u2019s knack for spotting shoddy, dangerous work. The thought was strangely comforting. It grounded her. She wasn't a hero locked in an epic battle with evil; she was a public servant with a very specific, and very necessary, skill set.\n\nThe next day, she broke her own rule. She used her police credentials to get an update on Sarah Jenkins. The liaison officer told her that Sarah was with her family in the countryside, away from Blackburn and the prying eyes of the media. She was talking, eating, sleeping in fits and starts. She had asked her parents to throw out all her art supplies. The news hit Cassia with an unexpected force. She had saved Sarah\u2019s life, but Agnes had still succeeded in her own twisted way. She had destroyed an artist. The simple, harmless joy in making something, which Cassia had identified as the motive, had been snuffed out. The circuit of creativity had been broken. It was a partial victory, a flawed repair. It was a reminder that even when you catch the killer, you can\u2019t erase the damage. The fault lines remained, scarring the landscape, a permanent part of the town\u2019s schematic. The new unit would not be about winning. It would be about containing the damage, earthing the faults, and trying to keep the lights on for as many people as possible, for as long as possible. It was a maintenance worker\u2019s job, after all. And Cassia Ptolomey, for better or worse, was reporting for duty."

                                        "text": "Chapter 7\n\nThree months after the rain had washed Agnes Vale\u2019s name from the streets, the Atypical Crimes Taskforce came into being not with a bang, but with the squeal of a protesting caster wheel and the smell of industrial cleaner. Their new domain was a set of forgotten offices on the top floor of the station, a space that had once housed the canteen staff records and had since been relegated to a dumping ground for obsolete computer monitors and broken chairs. It was a place with its own history of decay, which felt fitting. Cassia, now a Detective Inspector, stood in the middle of the largest room, her hands on her hips, watching as a newly promoted Detective Sergeant Alistair Evans wrestled with a flat-pack desk that seemed to have more screws than structural components. The ache in her bones was a low, familiar hum, a baseline to the new reality.\n\nDI Jim Coulson, who had made the lateral move to be her second with a quiet lack of fuss that spoke volumes, leaned against a doorframe, a mug of tea in hand. \u201cYou know, when they said \u2018hand-pick your own team and resources,\u2019 I pictured something more than an Allen key and a room that smells of damp pigeons.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe budget covers personnel and tech, Jim. Not d\u00e9cor,\u201d Cassia said, a faint smile touching her lips. \u201cBesides, it\u2019s got good bones. Solid wiring, separate fuse board. I checked.\u201d She had spent the first day here not with files, but with a multimeter and a head torch, mapping the building\u2019s nervous system, understanding its faults and quirks. It was the only way she knew how to claim a space. It was her own ritual.\n\n\u201cGood to know we won\u2019t get electrocuted filing our reports, boss,\u201d Evans grunted, finally slotting a piece of MDF into place with a satisfying thud. He looked up, his face flushed with effort, the moustache still a work in progress but now worn with the confidence of his new rank. \u201cIt\u2019s a blank canvas, isn\u2019t it? We can make it our own.\u201d Cassia noted his use of the word \u2018canvas\u2019 and the slight, involuntary tightening in her gut that came with it. The ghost of Agnes Vale was a silent partner in this new venture, the reason for its existence, the standard against which all future strangeness would be measured.\n\nTheir first official case arrived via a terse email from Corrigan, forwarded without comment. It was a welfare check that had turned sideways. Dr. Ewan Carlisle, a respected local historian and retired professor, had missed two days of lectures at the local historical society. When uniformed officers had gained entry to his large Victorian house near the park, they\u2019d found him in his study. He was physically unharmed but completely unresponsive, sitting in his armchair and staring into the middle distance. A suspected stroke, the initial report suggested, but the paramedics had found no clear physical cause. He was now at the infirmary, in a state the doctors were cautiously labelling as a profound catatonic stupor. The local CID team had done a cursory sweep, found no signs of forced entry, no theft, nothing to indicate a crime, and had been ready to close the file. But one of the responding constables, a bright young PC, had noted something odd. Something that didn\u2019t fit. And so the file had been kicked up the chain until it landed on Corrigan\u2019s desk, who had immediately shunted it to the station\u2019s new home for lost causes.\n\nThe Carlisle house smelled of beeswax, old paper, and sherry. It was a time capsule of a quiet, academic life. The study was the heart of the home, a magnificent room lined from floor to ceiling with dark wood shelves groaning under the weight of thousands of books. It was in here that the two constables had found Dr. Carlisle. As Cassia stepped into the room, she felt a shift in the atmosphere, a subtle wrongness that reminded her of the too-perfect lighting in the Jubilee Mill. The room was immaculate. Not a speck of dust on the polished desk, not a pen out of place. It was the unnerving, sterile tidiness of a space that has been scrubbed of its personality.\n\n\u201cForensics found nothing,\u201d Coulson said, reading from his tablet. \u201cNo prints other than Carlisle\u2019s, no fibres, no signs of a struggle. The only thing they took away was the sherry decanter, but they\u2019re not expecting much. The man was seventy-two. It looks like a medical episode.\u201d\n\nCassia didn\u2019t answer. She walked slowly along the bookshelves, her eyes scanning the spines. The books were all related to history, thousands of them. Biographies, social histories, dense academic texts. But the order was chaotic. A book on Roman Britain was wedged between a biography of George V and a treatise on the Poor Laws of 1834. It was a mess. \u201cThe PC who flagged this,\u201d Cassia said, her voice quiet. \u201cWhat did she notice?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe books,\u201d Evans supplied, pointing to the shelves. \u201cShe\u2019d been here before, a few years back, for a school project. She said Dr. Carlisle was obsessive about his library. He had his own unique cataloguing system, a mix of subject, chronology, and personal significance. He could supposedly find any book in the dark. She said it looked like a bomb had gone off in his system.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a mess,\u201d Cassia murmured, pulling a book from the shelf. It was a biography of Isambard Kingdom Brunel. She looked at the copyright page. Then she pulled out another, a history of the Peterloo Massacre by E.P. Thompson. She didn\u2019t need to be a historian to see it. It wasn\u2019t chaos. It was a new system. An imposed order that was meticulous, labour-intensive, and utterly insane. She turned to her team, her eyes lit with the cold fire of dawning comprehension. \u201cThey\u2019re organised by the author\u2019s date of death.\u201d The other two detectives stared at her, then at the shelves, the implication slowly dawning on them. Someone had come into this room, a library containing a lifetime of curated knowledge, and had systematically dismantled it. They had spent hours, possibly days, cross-referencing thousands of books and rearranging them into a morbid, pointless sequence. They hadn\u2019t stolen a thing. They hadn\u2019t laid a hand on Carlisle. They had simply taken his life\u2019s work, the architecture of his own mind, and rewritten it in the language of the graveyard.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 why?\u201d Coulson breathed, looking at the shelves with a new sense of horror. \u201cWhat kind of person does that?\u201d\n\n\u201cA person who wants to make a statement,\u201d Cassia said, her mind already tracing the circuit. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t a burglary. It was an execution. They didn't kill his body; they killed his mind. They showed him what they had done to his life\u2019s work, and the shock of it\u2026 it just broke him. Blew a fuse in his brain.\u201d She looked around the silent, violated room. This was their first case. Not a collector of body parts, but a collector of intellects. A saboteur of legacies. The ache in her bones sharpened. It was Agnes Vale\u2019s methodology, her core principle of vindictive, intimate destruction, translated into a different medium. The Atypical Crimes Taskforce was officially open for business, and their first client was already a ghost."

                                        "text": "The statement hung in the dusty air of the library, as quiet and as devastating as the act it described. Coulson stared at the shelves, his expression shifting from confusion to a dawning, grim comprehension. He was a man who understood broken doors, stolen wallets, and the brutal physics of a fistfight. This was different. This was a violation on a level he had no template for, a silent, intellectual evisceration. Evans, younger and more impressionable, looked physically ill, as if he could feel the sheer, painstaking malice that had been poured into the room over countless hours. To rearrange a few books was a prank; to do this to a whole library, to a whole life, was an act of profound psychological warfare.\n\n\u201cIt would have taken days,\u201d Coulson said, his voice a low rumble. \u201cQuietly. Methodically. The man must have let them in. Trusted them.\u201d He ran a hand over his face, the gesture conveying a weariness that went beyond lack of sleep. \u201cSo we\u2019re looking for a librarian from hell? Someone with a grudge and a terrifying amount of free time?\u201d The sarcasm in his voice was a flimsy defense against the creeping strangeness of the scene.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking for a student,\u201d Cassia corrected, her focus absolute as she scanned the room, seeing it not as a collection of objects but as a schematic of the crime. \u201cOr a rival. Someone who knew Carlisle. Someone who knew what this library represented. This wasn't a random act of vandalism. This was a bespoke piece of cruelty, designed specifically for him.\u201d She walked over to the large oak desk. It was empty apart from a leather blotter, a pen stand, and a single, sealed envelope, placed perfectly in the centre. Carlisle\u2019s name was written on it in elegant, looping calligraphy. \u201cWas this here when the uniforms arrived?\u201d\n\nEvans checked the initial report on his tablet. \u201cYes, boss. They logged it but didn\u2019t open it. Assumed it was personal mail.\u201d Cassia carefully slit the envelope open with a pen from the stand. Inside was not a letter, but a small, stiff square of card. Printed on it in the same calligraphic script was a short phrase: *\u2018Ars longa, vita brevis.\u2019* Art is long, life is short. Below it was a small, exquisitely detailed drawing of an Ouroboros, the snake eating its own tail. It was a message, a signature, a mission statement. This was a killer who saw themselves as a philosopher, a corrector of vanities.\n\nBack in their new, half-assembled office, the blank whiteboards were put to immediate use. Evans wrote the Latin phrase and drew a surprisingly accurate copy of the Ouroboros in the centre of the board. The symbol stared back at them, a perfect, closed loop of self-consuming logic. They had a name for their unsub now, one born from his own pretentious calling card: The Philosopher. The name felt different from \u2018The Collector.\u2019 It lacked the visceral, grubby horror, but it carried a chilling, intellectual coldness that was just as unsettling. While Evans began digging into Carlisle\u2019s life\u2014finances, family, any hint of conflict\u2014Cassia and Coulson headed to the Blackburn Historical Society, a grandly named institution housed in a few rooms above a bookmaker\u2019s shop.\n\nThe society\u2019s chairman, a flustered man named Bernard, wrung his hands as he recounted Carlisle\u2019s standing. Ewan Carlisle had been a giant, a man whose knowledge of local history was encyclopedic. He was respected, admired, even loved. A feud? An academic rival? Bernard paled at the suggestion. \u201cEwan was a gentleman of the old school,\u201d he insisted. \u201cHe could be\u2026 exacting. His standards were incredibly high. He didn't suffer fools gladly. But he was never unkind.\u201d Cassia\u2019s internal circuitry sparked at the phrase. \u2018Exacting standards.\u2019 \u2018Didn\u2019t suffer fools gladly.\u2019 This was the kind of polite language used to describe a man who likely had a razor-sharp tongue for anyone he considered intellectually inferior. It was fertile ground for a festering grudge.\n\n\u201cWho were his students?\u201d Cassia asked, cutting through the eulogy. \u201cHis prot\u00e9g\u00e9s? Was there anyone he had a falling out with? Someone whose work he\u2019d perhaps\u2026 critiqued harshly?\u201d The parallel to the Agnes Vale case was impossible to ignore. A public humiliation, a perceived injustice, a monstrous ego seeking validation through destruction. Bernard hesitated, his loyalty to his friend warring with the serious expressions on the detectives\u2019 faces. \u201cThere was a young man,\u201d he said finally, his voice dropping. \u201cA few years ago. Incredibly bright. Ambitious. His name was Gideon Price. He was writing a monograph on the decline of the Lancashire textile industry, a subject Ewan considered his own. Gideon\u2019s thesis was\u2026 radical. It flew in the face of Ewan\u2019s own published work. Ewan publicly dismantled it at a society meeting. Called it \u2018historically illiterate\u2019 and \u2018an exercise in juvenile contrarianism.\u2019 It was brutal. Gideon was humiliated. He resigned from the society that night and, well, nobody has seen him since.\u201d\n\nThe name \u2018Gideon Price\u2019 went up on the whiteboard next to the Ouroboros. Evans quickly found him. Price had been a star postgraduate student at the university until he abruptly dropped out shortly after the incident Bernard described. He had no social media presence, no current address, no digital footprint for the last two years. He had, like Agnes Vale, simply fallen off the grid. He\u2019d become a ghost. Cassia stared at the name, at the story of public humiliation, at the academic subject matter \u2013 the decline of industry, the death of a way of life. The connections were faint, low-voltage whispers in the static, but they were there. She felt the same cold certainty she had felt in the Jubilee Mill. They weren\u2019t hunting for a random intellectual vandal. They were hunting for a failed historian who had decided to become the final, definitive editor of his old professor\u2019s life. The Philosopher hadn\u2019t just rearranged the books. He had been making a point about obsolescence, about a history that consumes itself, leaving nothing behind. And Cassia suspected, with a chill that had nothing to do with the office\u2019s poor heating, that Dr. Carlisle was only the first volume in his new, terrible collection."

                                        "text": "The hunt for a ghost began not with sirens and warrants, but with the quiet rustle of paper and the ghosts of lives already lived. Gideon Price had erased his present, but his past was an indelible stain on public records. The team worked backwards, pulling old tenancy agreements, university records, and employment histories. He had been a library assistant, a part-time tutor, a researcher for a local author. He had lived in a succession of cheap, transient flats. He was a man who had moved through the city\u2019s academic underbelly like a phantom, leaving behind little more than a name on a faded ledger. His family, a mother and sister in Leeds, hadn\u2019t heard from him in over two years, not since his \u2018troubles at the university\u2019. They painted a picture of a sensitive, fiercely intelligent, and prideful young man who could not bear to fail, least of all publicly.\n\nIt was Coulson, doggedly working through a list of old landlords, who got the hit. A letting agent for a block of grim 1960s flats remembered Price. \u201cOdd lad. Paid six months\u2019 rent up front, in cash. That was about eighteen months ago. Haven\u2019t seen him since. As long as the rent turned up in a bank transfer every quarter, we left him be.\u201d The last payment had been a week ago. The flat, located on the edge of town overlooking a railway cutting, was the first concrete location they had for him in two years. It was his base of operations, the nerve centre for his intellectual war. Cassia knew, with the same cold certainty she'd felt in the substation, that they wouldn't find him there. They would find his plan.\n\nThe tactical team was a formality. Cassia knew this entry would be silent and unopposed. The air inside Gideon Price\u2019s flat was stale and cold, thick with the dry, sweet scent of decaying paper. It wasn\u2019t a home; it was a monk\u2019s cell dedicated to a single, consuming ideology. There was a mattress on the floor, a single hotplate in the kitchenette, and books. Stacks of them, piles of them, walls of them. But unlike Carlisle\u2019s grand library, these were not treasured possessions. They were ammunition. Their spines were cracked, their pages filled with angry, spidery annotations. This was not a place of learning; it was a place of obsessive, furious study.\n\nOn the largest wall of the living room, Gideon had constructed his manifesto. It was a vast, sprawling timeline, meticulously drawn by hand. It wasn't a history of Blackburn, but a history of its decline, starting with the first mill closures in the 1930s and ending with the present day. Key dates were circled in red, connected by lines of thread to newspaper clippings, photocopied book chapters, and black-and-white photographs of derelict factories and forgotten men in flat caps. It was the work of a man drowning in nostalgia for a past he had never known, a man enraged by the slow, inevitable creep of decay and irrelevance. And at the very end of the timeline, there were three photographs. The first was of Dr. Ewan Carlisle.\n\n\u201cBoss, look at this,\u201d Evans called from the small bedroom. Cassia and Coulson followed him in. The room contained a single desk and a chair. On the desk sat an old, heavy manual typewriter. A half-finished page was still rolled into it. It was a list of names, each one followed by a short, damning critique. It read like a twisted set of judging notes. *\u2018Ewan Carlisle: The Curator. Preserves the dead body of history but despises its living spirit. A monument to stasis.\u2019* Below his name was another. *\u2018Eleanor Vance: The Matriarch. Governs the city\u2019s last bastion of unearned privilege. Her family built their fortune on the bones of the industry she now pretends to celebrate through charity.\u2019* The name Vance struck a chord with Coulson. \u201cEleanor Vance is the chairwoman of the Blackburn Heritage Trust,\u201d he said, his voice grim. \u201cAn old mill-owning family. They own half the historic buildings in the town centre. She\u2019s in her late eighties. A local treasure.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnother monument,\u201d Cassia murmured, staring at the typewritten words. The Philosopher wasn\u2019t just targeting academics. He was targeting figures he saw as symbols of a hollowed-out history, gatekeepers of a past he believed they had betrayed. He was a historical corrective, pruning the dead wood. This wasn't just revenge; it was a crusade. The Ouroboros on the calling card suddenly made perfect, terrifying sense. History consuming itself. He was accelerating the process. On the desk, next to the typewriter, was a small, leather-bound diary. It wasn\u2019t Gideon\u2019s. The flyleaf was inscribed with the name \u2018Eleanor Vance, 1952\u2019. He already had a personal effect. He had already breached her life.\n\nA sudden, frantic energy seized the room. Coulson was already on his phone, his voice sharp and urgent as he dispatched a patrol car to Eleanor Vance\u2019s address, a large manor house on the outskirts of the town. Cassia\u2019s mind was racing, connecting the circuits. Gideon was a ghost. He moved without a trace. He had been in Carlisle\u2019s house for days without anyone knowing. He could be in Eleanor Vance\u2019s house right now, silently moving through the rooms, a phantom editor preparing to delete another chapter of the city\u2019s history. \u201cHe\u2019s not going to do the same thing twice,\u201d she said, her voice tight with urgency. \u201cRearranging books was for the academic. For the Matriarch, the symbol of property and inheritance, he\u2019ll do something else. Something that attacks the very foundation of who she is.\u201d\n\nThe patrol car\u2019s radio crackled through on Coulson\u2019s phone. The officer\u2019s voice was strained. \u201cWe\u2019re at the Vance residence, sir. There\u2019s no answer at the door, but\u2026 the lights are on. And the front door is slightly ajar.\u201d Cassia felt a familiar spike of cold adrenaline. The trap was already sprung. \u201cTell them not to go in,\u201d she commanded, grabbing her coat. \u201cSecure the perimeter and wait for us. He\u2019s still in there. He\u2019s putting on a performance.\u201d As they raced from the flat, the stale air giving way to the shock of the cold evening, Cassia knew they were no longer just chasing a ghost. They were walking into his carefully curated exhibition, and the price of admission was terrifyingly high."

                                        "text": "Chapter 8\n\nThe Vance Manor stood silhouetted against the bruised purple of the evening sky, a grand Victorian folly of turrets and dark stone. It was a fortress of old money and older secrets, but tonight, its defenses were down. The wrought-iron gates were open, and a single light burned in a downstairs window, a lonely beacon in the oppressive dark. The patrol car was parked discreetly down the drive, its occupants staying back as ordered, their presence little more than a whisper in the vast, manicured grounds. The silence was the first thing Cassia noticed. It wasn't the quiet of a peaceful evening; it was a held breath, a predatory stillness that coiled around the ancient oak trees and seeped from the very stones of the house. The front door, a monstrous slab of dark, carved wood, was ajar, a black slash of void that served as an explicit and unnerving invitation.\n\n\"He wants an audience,\" Coulson murmured, his voice low as they approached the house, boots crunching softly on the gravel. \"Just like Agnes.\"\n\n\"Agnes wanted her work to be seen after the fact,\" Cassia corrected, her eyes fixed on the dark opening of the doorway. \"He wants us to watch him do it. This isn't a gallery viewing; it's a live lecture.\" She led the way, pushing the heavy door open further. The entrance hall was cavernous, a museum of a dead dynasty. A sweeping staircase carpeted in faded claret rose into the shadows. The walls were lined with portraits of stern-faced men and pale, corseted women, their painted eyes following the intrusion with silent disapproval. The air smelled of furniture polish, potpourri, and something else, something sharp and out of place. It was the scent of wet paper and a faint, chemical tang that reminded Cassia of a print workshop.\n\nA trail of destruction, subtle but deliberate, led them from the hall. A silver-framed photograph of a young family had been turned to face the wall. A glass display case containing military medals had been opened and the medals rearranged into a nonsensical order. They were small acts of desecration, breadcrumbs leading them deeper into the maze. The chemical smell grew stronger, drawing them towards a set of double doors at the end of a long corridor. From behind the doors came a low, rhythmic, mechanical sound: a methodical, grinding churn. Cassia gestured for Coulson and Evans to hold back. She drew her sidearm, the familiar weight a cold comfort, and pushed the door open.\n\nThe room had once been the family library, a smaller, more intimate version of Carlisle\u2019s grand collection. But Gideon Price had transformed it into a workshop for his own terrible art form. In the centre of the room, under the harsh, focused beam of a single angle-poise lamp he had brought with him, was the source of the noise. It was a heavy-duty industrial shredder and a large, stainless-steel vat filled with a churning, grey slurry, powered by a long extension cord plugged into a wall socket. And sitting in a high-backed wing chair, facing the grotesque machine, was Eleanor Vance. She was a tiny, bird-like woman, her hands clenched in her lap, but her back was ramrod straight and her eyes, fixed on the man operating the machine, burned with a cold, undiluted fury. She was not a victim in stupor; she was a queen forced to watch the sack of her own city.\n\nGideon Price didn't seem to notice their entry. He was dressed in a neat tweed jacket, over which he wore a thick rubber apron. He was calmly feeding pages from a thick, leather-bound book into the shredder. The machine whined as its teeth bit into the paper, spitting confetti-like strips into the vat. He then poured a chemical from a beaker into the slurry, and the churning intensified. He was so absorbed in his work, so professorial and precise, that he could have been conducting a chemistry experiment. He looked up only when Cassia spoke his name, her voice cutting through the mechanical drone. \u201cGideon Price. It\u2019s over.\u201d\n\nHe looked at her, his expression not of fear, but of mild irritation, the look a lecturer gives a student who has interrupted a crucial point. \u201cDetective Inspector Ptolomey,\u201d he said, his voice calm and academic. \u201cYou are just in time for the final revision. I am correcting a historical imbalance. The Vance family fortune was built on paper \u2013 paper mills, paper profits, paper promises to their workers. I'm simply returning it to its most elemental state: a worthless, grey pulp.\u201d He gestured with a stirring rod towards the churning vat. \u201cThis was their first ledger from 1888. These,\u201d he pointed to a stack of photo albums, \u201care their family portraits from the turn of the century. All paper tigers. *Ars longa, vita brevis*, but inherited wealth, Detective, should be the briefest of all.\u201d\n\n\u201cTurn off the machine, Gideon,\u201d Cassia ordered, her weapon still trained on him, her eyes flicking between him, the frail woman in the chair, and the churning vat. He was not physically imposing, but his serene, fanatical calm was more frightening than any overt threat. He was a man who had already calculated all the outcomes and was satisfied with them.\n\nGideon simply smiled, a thin, patronising curve of his lips. \u201cYou mistake my purpose. This is not an act of destruction. It is an act of creation. From this pulp, this slurry of forgotten lies and unearned privilege, I will make new paper. Blank paper. A truly fresh start for this city's history, free from the stains of the past.\u201d He picked up another leather-bound book from a pile on the floor. It was the diary Cassia had seen in his flat. Eleanor Vance\u2019s diary. A small, choked sound escaped the old woman\u2019s lips, the first sign of a crack in her composure.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not erasing history, Gideon,\u201d Cassia said, taking a slow step into the room, trying to find the flaw in his terrible logic, the loose wire in his intellectual circuit. \u201cYou\u2019re just making yourself a footnote in hers. They won\u2019t remember your thesis on the textile industry. They\u2019ll remember you as the man who tormented an old woman in her library. You\u2019re trading your entire legacy, the one thing you care about, for a single, pathetic act of vandalism. That's not a historical correction, Gideon. That's a bad trade.\u201d\n\nFor the first time, a flash of anger broke through his calm exterior. His eyes narrowed. \u201cThis is not vandalism! It is a purification! An essential, final edit!\u201d His voice rose, losing its academic detachment and taking on a shrill, desperate edge. He gestured wildly around the room, at the piles of ledgers, photo albums, and letters waiting to be fed to the machine. \u201cAnd it will be final!\u201d His hand darted towards a large, red metal canister sitting next to the desk, a can of industrial solvent, its flammable warning label stark under the lamplight. His fingers hovered over the cap. \u201cI will not be a footnote. I will be the fire that cleanses the library. My work will be complete, and you will all bear witness to the end of an age.\u201d His eyes were alight with a terrifying, ecstatic fire. He was no longer a failed historian. He was an avenging angel, ready to burn down the temple with everyone inside it."

The serene philosopher was gone, replaced by a wild-eyed zealot poised on the edge of a final, self-immolating act. His hand trembled over the solvent can, a finger\u2019s twitch away from turning his meticulous intellectual exercise into a crude and deadly inferno. Coulson and Evans tensed, their training screaming at them to close the distance, but the geometry of the room was a death trap. Any sudden move would trigger the fire Gideon so desperately craved. Cassia, however, remained unnaturally still, her weapon held steady, her mind racing not to find a point of attack, but a point of failure in his logic. Fire was the flaw.\n\n\u201cFire, Gideon?\u201d Her voice was unexpectedly calm, not pleading but analytical, as if discussing a poorly reasoned chapter in a thesis. \u201cHow profoundly unoriginal. It\u2019s the last resort of the vandal, not the grand statement of a philosopher. It's an admission that you\u2019ve lost the argument.\u201d Gideon\u2019s wild eyes flickered towards her, his martyrdom momentarily interrupted by the critique. \u201cThink about it,\u201d she pressed on, taking a slow, deliberate half-step. \u201cFire is indiscriminate. It destroys everything, including your point. That pulp,\u201d she nodded towards the churning vat, \u201cthe blank paper you\u2019re so proud of, your great act of creation\u2026 it all just burns. There\u2019s no thesis in ash. No legacy. You won\u2019t be the man who rewrote history. You\u2019ll just be the man who burned down a library with an old woman in it. A common arsonist. A footnote.\u201d\n\nThe word \u2018common\u2019 struck him with the force of a physical blow. His entire crusade was a war against his own perceived commonness, his failure to ascend into the academic pantheon. But before he could retort, another voice, thin but sharp as broken glass, cut through the tension. \u201cHe\u2019s right, you know,\u201d Eleanor Vance said, her voice devoid of fear, filled instead with a lifetime of aristocratic disdain. She hadn't moved from her chair, but her gaze pinned Gideon to the spot. \u201cYou\u2019re just a grubby little boy with a box of matches. My husband dealt with striking mill workers who had more conviction than you. They at least believed they were building something. You\u2019re just throwing a tantrum because a better man told you your homework wasn\u2019t good enough.\u201d\n\nThe dual assault was devastating. Cassia had attacked his intellect, the foundation of his fantasy. Eleanor Vance had attacked his class and his manhood, the source of his real-world insecurity. The ecstatic fire in Gideon\u2019s eyes sputtered, replaced by a contorted mask of pure, impotent rage. He looked from Cassia\u2019s cold logic to Eleanor\u2019s colder contempt, his grand historical narrative crumbling into dust around him. He glanced down at the solvent can, his instrument of apotheosis, as if seeing for the first time that it was just a can, not a vessel of divine justice. His certainty faltered. And in that single, crucial second of hesitation, the circuit broke.\n\nCoulson moved. He was a silent, sudden force, covering the ten feet between them in three long strides. There was no shout, no warning. Just a heavy, practiced hand clamping down on Gideon\u2019s wrist, twisting it brutally until his fingers spasmed open. Another hand seized the collar of his tweed jacket, spinning him away from the desk and the precious solvent. The can clattered to the floor, rolling harmlessly under a bookshelf. Evans was there an instant later, helping to force the struggling, sputtering historian to the ground. The fight went out of Gideon almost immediately, his body going limp as the reality of his failure crashed down upon him. He lay on the floor amidst the scattered pages of his own ambition, no longer a philosopher king, just a defeated man in a dirty apron.\n\nAs her officers secured the scene, Cassia holstered her weapon and walked over to the wing chair. Eleanor Vance was watching the methodical process of Gideon\u2019s arrest with an unnerving, regal composure. She followed Cassia\u2019s gaze to the vat, where the pulped remains of her family\u2019s history continued to churn with a quiet, indifferent rhythm. \u201cAre you alright, Mrs. Vance?\u201d Cassia asked, her voice soft. The old woman took a deep, steadying breath and then turned her piercing eyes on Cassia. \u201cI am quite alright, Inspector. Annoyed, but alright. It has been a very long time since a man raised his voice to me in my own home.\u201d A flicker of something\u2014dark humour, perhaps, or simply steel\u2014showed in her eyes. \u201cThank you for taking out the trash.\u201d\n\nThe quiet respect between the two women\u2014the old matriarch who had faced down her own erasure with unbending will, and the detective who had dismantled the threat with logic instead of force\u2014was a silent, solid presence in the chaos. Cassia gave a curt nod and then moved to the humming shredder. She found the plug and pulled it from the wall, and the mechanical churning finally ceased. The sudden silence that filled the library was immense, broken only by the sound of Coulson reading a subdued Gideon Price his rights.\n\nLeaving the house an hour later, the scene now swarming with the forensics team who would catalogue this new, strange form of violation, Cassia felt the familiar wave of post-adrenaline exhaustion. The cool night air felt clean in her lungs. She had traced another fault, earthed another dangerous current. But this one felt different. Agnes Vale had been a short circuit of pure, narcissistic envy. Gideon Price was a more complex malfunction: a feedback loop of intellectual rage, a man so obsessed with the past that he was willing to destroy the present to \u2018correct\u2019 it. As she got into the car, Cassia looked back at the grand old house, a bastion of a history that was both real and imagined, a place that had almost become a pyre. Her new unit was only two cases old, and already it was clear she was not just hunting criminals. She was diagnosing souls, and the wiring was getting more complicated with every call."

He glanced down at the solvent can, his instrument of apotheosis, as if seeing for the first time that it was just a can, not a vessel of divine justice. His certainty faltered. And in that single, crucial second of hesitation, the circuit broke.\n\nCoulson moved. He was a silent, sudden force, covering the ten feet between them in three long strides. There was no shout, no warning. Just a heavy, practiced hand clamping down on Gideon\u2019s wrist, twisting it brutally until his fingers spasmed open. Another hand seized the collar of his tweed jacket, spinning him away from the desk and the precious solvent. The can clattered to the floor, rolling harmlessly under a bookshelf. Evans was there an instant later, helping to force the struggling, sputtering historian to the ground. The fight went out of Gideon almost immediately, his body going limp as the reality of his failure crashed down upon him. He lay on the floor amidst the scattered pages of his own ambition, no longer a philosopher king, just a defeated man in a dirty apron.\n\nAs her officers secured the scene, Cassia holstered her weapon and walked over to the wing chair. Eleanor Vance was watching the methodical process of Gideon\u2019s arrest with an unnerving, regal composure. She followed Cassia\u2019s gaze to the vat, where the pulped remains of her family\u2019s history continued to churn with a quiet, indifferent rhythm. \u201cAre you alright, Mrs. Vance?\u201d Cassia asked, her voice soft. The old woman took a deep, steadying breath and then turned her piercing eyes on Cassia. \u201cI am quite alright, Inspector. Annoyed, but alright. It has been a very long time since a man raised his voice to me in my own home.\u201d A flicker of something\u2014dark humour, perhaps, or simply steel\u2014showed in her eyes. \u201cThank you for taking out the trash.\u201d\n\nThe quiet respect between the two women\u2014the old matriarch who had faced down her own erasure with unbending will, and the detective who had dismantled the threat with logic instead of force\u2014was a silent, solid presence in the chaos. Cassia gave a curt nod and then moved to the humming shredder. She found the plug and pulled it from the wall, and the mechanical churning finally ceased. The sudden silence that filled the library was immense, broken only by the sound of Coulson reading a subdued Gideon Price his rights. Leaving the house an hour later, the scene now swarming with the forensics team who would catalogue this new, strange form of violation, Cassia felt the familiar wave of post-adrenaline exhaustion. The cool night air felt clean in her lungs. She had traced another fault, earthed another dangerous current. But this one felt different. Agnes Vale had been a short circuit of pure, narcissistic envy. Gideon Price was a more complex malfunction: a feedback loop of intellectual rage, a man so obsessed with the past that he was willing to destroy the present to \u2018correct\u2019 it. As she got into the car, Cassia looked back at the grand old house, a bastion of a history that was both real and imagined, a place that had almost become a pyre. Her new unit was only two cases old, and already it was clear she was not just hunting criminals. She was diagnosing souls, and the wiring was getting more complicated with every call."

                                        "text": "Chapter 10\n\nThe silence in the top-floor offices of the Atypical Crimes Taskforce was a fragile, temporary state. It was the quiet of a system between surges, a brief respite before the next inevitable fault. Two weeks after the arrest of Gideon Price, the smell of damp pigeons had been replaced by the faint, optimistic scent of new paint. The flat-pack desks were assembled, the network was live, and a state-of-the-art digital whiteboard\u2014a concession to Evans\u2019s persistent lobbying\u2014covered one wall, its blank, white screen a stark contrast to the chaotic, ink-stained boards of the Vale case. Cassia stood before it, a mug of tea warming her hands, and stared at the two case summaries that Evans had uploaded. \u2018The Collector\u2019 and \u2018The Philosopher\u2019. One represented by a clinical 3D model of a resin-encased toe, the other by the looping, self-devouring Ouroboros. One was a crime of visceral, artistic envy; the other, a crime of cold, intellectual rage. Both were born from the same source: the corrosive power of a failed ambition.\n\n\u201cThe paperwork on Price is a nightmare,\u201d Coulson grumbled from his desk, which was already an island of meticulously ordered files in the sea of their new, sterile office space. \u201cHe\u2019s refusing to speak. Just sits in his cell, staring at the wall. His solicitor is arguing diminished responsibility due to a 'narcissistic academic fixation'. The shrinks are having a field day. We\u2019ve got more psychological reports than witness statements.\u201d He sighed, the sound of a man who longed for a simple breaking-and-entering case. \u201cAt least with Agnes Vale, the malice was straightforward. She wanted to hurt people. Price seems to genuinely believe he was improving them.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was,\u201d Cassia said quietly, her gaze still fixed on the whiteboard. \u201cIn his own mind. He was editing them. Removing what he saw as their flaws. The problem is, his definition of a flaw was their entire existence.\u201d Her thoughts drifted to the victims. Dr. Carlisle remained lost in the silent prison of his own mind, his great library now a crime scene, its unique order a testament to the man it had broken. Eleanor Vance, however, was a different story. She had called Cassia two days ago, her voice as crisp and clear as a winter morning. She hadn't called to talk about victim support or the ongoing case; she had called to inform Cassia that she had established a private fund to ensure Dr. Carlisle received the best possible neurological care for the rest of his life. \u201cA mind like that, Inspector,\u201d she had said, her tone leaving no room for argument, \u201cis a civic resource. We don\u2019t let our historic buildings crumble, and we won't let him crumble either.\u201d The call had been a stark reminder that while some victims were shattered by a crime, others were forged by it into something harder.\n\nIt was Evans who broke the contemplative silence, his fingers flying across a keyboard. \u201cBoss, you might want to see this.\u201d His voice held a note of professional curiosity that Cassia was learning to recognise as the prelude to something strange. \u201cCorrigan just forwarded a preliminary report from city division. They\u2019ve got a DOA. Thirty-two-year-old software developer named Liam Farrell. Found by a cleaner in his apartment at the new Quay Point development. No signs of forced entry, no struggle, no apparent injuries. Pathologist is putting the preliminary cause of death as acute cardiac failure, probably stress-induced. They\u2019re calling it SADS\u2014Sudden Adult Death Syndrome\u2014and are getting ready to close the file.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo why has it landed on our desk?\u201d Coulson asked, leaning back in his chair, already weary of the inevitable answer.\n\n\u201cBecause of the responding officer,\u201d Evans said, swivelling in his chair to face them. \u201cHe was a new lad, a tech nerd before he joined the force. He noticed that Farrell\u2019s apartment was a top-of-the-line \u2018smart\u2019 home, fully automated. On a hunch, he pulled the system\u2019s environmental logs for the last forty-eight hours.\u201d Evans projected the log onto the digital whiteboard. It was a chaotic scribble of vertical lines and jagged peaks. \u201cAccording to this,\u201d he continued, tracing a line with his finger, \u201cfor the two days leading up to his death, the apartment\u2019s systems went haywire. The lights would strobe at random intervals. The temperature would fluctuate from five degrees Celsius to forty. The sound system would blast a single, high-frequency note for seconds at a time. The automated blinds would snap open and shut. The logs show it was happening for sixty seconds every fifteen minutes, around the clock. The place was a purpose-built torture chamber.\u201d He looked up at them, his eyes wide. \u201cThe house tortured him to death.\u201d\n\nThe Quay Point development was the architectural antithesis of old Blackburn. It was a gleaming temple of glass and steel, a monument to the digital economy that had been bolted onto the town\u2019s industrial carcass. Liam Farrell\u2019s apartment was on the twentieth floor, a minimalist white box with panoramic views of the very mills and canals that Gideon Price had mourned. The air inside was sterile, controlled, lacking any of the human scents of beeswax or old paper. This was a place where life was curated by an algorithm. Cassia felt a profound sense of dislocation. Her expertise was in the physical world of copper wires, rusted junction boxes, and faulty circuits you could trace with your hands. This crime was ethereal, committed by signals she couldn't see and a language she didn't speak.\n\n\u201cThe whole place is run from this,\u201d Evans said, gesturing to a sleek, black server unit humming quietly in a utility closet. \u201cThe 'Aethel' Home System. It controls everything from the coffee machine to the shower temperature. It\u2019s a closed network, supposedly unhackable from the outside. Triple-encrypted, military-grade firewall.\u201d He tapped at his tablet, his face grim. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to find a breach, a backdoor, any sign of an external intrusion. There\u2019s nothing. The firewall is completely intact. The system logs don't show a single unauthorised access attempt.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo it was a malfunction?\u201d Coulson suggested, looking around the pristine apartment as if expecting a fuse to blow. \u201cA catastrophic system failure?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Evans said, shaking his head. \u201cThe commands weren't random glitches. They were specific, deliberate, and correctly coded instructions. They were just malicious. It wasn\u2019t a malfunction. It was a perfectly executed program. According to the system, the house did exactly what it was told to do.\u201d He looked at Cassia, the implications of his discovery sinking in. \u201cWhoever did this didn\u2019t have to break in. The commands that killed Liam Farrell originated from *inside* the network. The ghost wasn\u2019t in the machine, boss. The ghost *was* the machine.\u201d\n\nCassia stood in the centre of the sterile living room, the city spread out below her like a circuit board she no longer understood. Agnes Vale\u2019s wiring had been crude but brilliant. Gideon Price\u2019s methods had been archaic but psychologically devastating. This was something else entirely. A silent, invisible killer who didn't need a workshop or a library, just a few lines of malevolent code. A murder weapon with no fingerprints, no material form, just a series of ones and zeros. The familiar, dull ache in her bones felt distant, muted, as if the analogue pain couldn't get a signal in this digital space. For the first time, Cassia Ptolomey, the sparky detective, felt the cold, creeping dread of obsolescence. She was facing a faulty circuit, and she had no idea where the wires even began."

                                        "text": "The silence in Liam Farrell's apartment was absolute, broken only by the quiet, methodical hum of the server that had orchestrated his death. Cassia felt a profound disconnect, a professional vertigo. Her instincts, honed on the physical evidence of frayed wires, jimmied locks, and the lingering scent of decay, were useless here. She was a master of analogue trauma in a world that had just presented her with a digital murder. The fault wasn\u2019t in the wiring; it was in the ones and zeros, a language she couldn't read, a current she couldn't trace.\n\nBack in their top-floor sanctuary, the mood was subdued, the initial excitement of a new case replaced by a creeping sense of inadequacy. The smart home\u2019s chaotic log was still displayed on the whiteboard, a meaningless digital scream. \"I'm out of my depth here,\" Cassia admitted, the words tasting like metal in her mouth. It wasn\u2019t a confession of weakness, but a statement of fact, a recalibration of the team's strategy. She looked at Evans, who was practically vibrating with a mixture of horror and intense professional fascination. \"This is your world, Alistair. Forget physical entry points and forensics. I need a digital footprint. Find out who built this Aethel system. Find out who wrote the original code. This wasn't a stranger throwing rocks at a window; this was an architect who knew about a secret door.\"\n\nWhile Evans plunged himself into the digital abyss of source code and developer forums, Cassia and Coulson did the legwork that felt comfortingly familiar. They visited Farrell\u2019s employer, a tech startup called 'Sentient Logic' housed in a converted mill that had been gutted and filled with glass walls, neon signs, and an espresso machine that cost more than Cassia's first car. The CEO, a man barely thirty with a designer hoodie and the overconfident patter of a TED talk, described Liam Farrell in terms that were both glowing and damning. He was their star developer, the lead architect of their most successful products, a man who could make code sing. He was also, the CEO admitted with a shrug, a \"purist\" who was notoriously difficult to work with, a man who treated inefficient code not as a problem to be fixed, but as a personal insult to be obliterated.\n\n\"Liam didn't debug; he purged,\" the CEO explained, sipping a ludicrously complicated coffee. \"If he took over a project, he'd often rip out everything that came before and start again from scratch. Said it was quicker than trying to fix someone else's 'sentimental mess'.\" The phrase landed like a dropped wrench in the quiet hum of the office. It was the voice of the critic, the dismissive verdict that had echoed through the crimes of both Agnes Vale and Gideon Price. It was the sound of a fuse being lit. Cassia and Coulson exchanged a look. They had found their point of friction. Liam Farrell hadn't just been a programmer; he'd been a ruthless editor with the power to delete people's work, and by extension, their professional identities.\n\nTheir return to the station was met with a breakthrough from Evans. He hadn't found a hack. He'd found an absence. \"The original build of the Aethel operating system had a master command sequence,\" he explained, his fingers flying across his keyboard to bring up lines of elegant, complex code on the main screen. \"It's like a secret handshake. It's not a bug; it's a developer's signature. A sort of hidden 'God Mode'. The original programmer built a back door for themselves, a way to get root access to any Aethel system, anywhere, bypassing all the security protocols.\" Evans looked at them, a hint of admiration in his voice. \"It's a beautiful piece of work. Untraceable, if you knew how to use it. A private key to the kingdom.\"\n\nThe pieces began to slot together with a chilling, inexorable logic. \"Farrell's last big project was the 'Aethel 2.0' security patch,\" Cassia said, the theory forming in her mind. \"He was a purist. He purged. He would have seen a back door not as a clever signature, but as a catastrophic security flaw.\" Evans nodded grimly, clicking a final time. \"Exactly. Work logs show that two months ago, Farrell found the sequence during a deep system audit. And he deleted it. Patched it out of existence across the entire network. He bricked the 'God Mode' key for good.\" The motive was no longer a mystery. Someone had built a secret kingdom, and Liam Farrell had not only seized the throne but had melted down the key, locking the original creator out forever.\n\nThe final connection was a formality. A quick search of Sentient Logic's employment records against the known original developers of the Aethel OS. \"Got her,\" Evans said, his voice quiet. A picture of a woman with dark, intelligent eyes and a wry smile appeared on the screen. \"Maya Sharma. One of the two founding programmers of the Aethel system. She was pushed out of the company six months ago. The reason cited in her exit review, signed by Liam Farrell, was 'an unwillingness to adapt to modern security protocols and a sentimental attachment to obsolete, inefficient code'.\" The echo was now a roar. The Collector, The Philosopher, and now\u2026 The Ghost. All of them artists of a kind, all of them geniuses in their own worlds, all of them undone by a single, devastating critique.\n\nCassia stared at the smiling face on the screen. The helplessness she had felt in the apartment was gone, burned away by the cold, clear fire of understanding. The wiring was different, the circuit was digital, but the human fault was exactly the same. \"She didn't have to hack her way in,\" Cassia said, her voice low and certain. \"She was already inside. This whole system was her house. Farrell didn't just fire her and delete a line of code. He evicted her, boarded up the windows, and changed the locks. So she found a way to turn his new, perfect house into his tomb.\" Cassia looked at her team, the task ahead now clear and terrifyingly familiar. \"We're not looking for a hacker. We're looking for a creator who has decided to un-create. Find me Maya Sharma. Find the place a ghost goes when you erase her world.\""

They couldn't track Maya\u2019s digital presence because, for all intents and purposes, she didn't have one. She moved through the web like a phantom, her traces so faint and expertly covered that they were indistinguishable from background noise. For two days, Evans fell down a rabbit hole of encrypted forums, archived developer chats, and the dark web, searching for a whisper of her name or a hint of her unique coding style. He found nothing. She had built the digital world she inhabited and she knew every secret passage, every hidden bolt-hole.\n\nIt was Coulson, with his steadfast belief in the tangible world of receipts and paperwork, who provided the anchor. \u201cShe can be a ghost online, but she still has to plug her modem in somewhere,\u201d he argued, surrounded by printouts of Maya Sharma\u2019s old financial records. \u201cShe needs power. She needs a connection. And that costs money.\u201d He traced a line on a bank statement with a thick finger. \u201cFor the last six months, ever since she was forced out of Sentient Logic, there\u2019s been a regular monthly payment. A direct debit to a holding company called \u2018Northern Digital Secure Solutions\u2019.\u201d A quick search revealed the company\u2019s sole asset: a large, windowless, featureless building on an industrial estate on the far side of town. It was a co-location data centre, a place where companies rent secure, climate-controlled space to house their servers. It was an anonymous digital fortress, the perfect hiding place for a deposed queen of code.\n\nThe building itself was an architectural shrug, a grey box designed to be ignored, surrounded by high-security fencing and bristling with cameras. There would be no kicking down doors here. Cassia, Coulson, and Evans met the site manager, a nervous man who paled when he saw their warrant. He led them through cooled corridors lined with racks of humming servers, the combined drone a deafening chorus of pure data. Each locked cage contained the digital heart of a different company. \u201cSuite 3B,\u201d the manager said, pointing to a cage at the far end of a row. \u201cIt\u2019s rented to a one-woman consultancy firm. She\u2019s in there now. We see her come and go, but she keeps to herself. Very quiet.\u201d\n\nCassia looked through the mesh of the cage. Inside was a spartan setup: a single server rack, a desk, a chair, and a woman. It was Maya Sharma. She was sitting at her terminal, bathed in the cool blue light of the screen, her fingers moving with fluid, silent grace across the keyboard. She didn't look like a killer. She looked like a musician composing a symphony. She hadn't even looked up at their approach, utterly absorbed in her world of light and logic. When Cassia\u2019s voice called her name, she didn\u2019t startle. She simply finished typing a line of code, pressed \u2018enter\u2019 with a final, definitive click, and then slowly turned her chair to face them, her expression calm and unreadable.\n\n\"Detective Inspector Ptolomey,\" Maya said, her voice as cool and controlled as the air in the server room. \"I was wondering when you'd arrive. Your digital forensics team is... surprisingly persistent, if a little clumsy.\" It wasn't a boast; it was a simple observation, a master craftsman critiquing an apprentice's work. Coulson moved to open the cage door, but Maya held up a single, slender hand. \"I wouldn't,\" she said, her voice dropping a fraction but losing none of its calm authority. \"The moment this cage is breached, a daemon I uploaded to the Aethel network will activate. It's a rather elegant piece of recursive code. It will instruct every Aethel system in the country to execute a single, final command: lock all doors and windows, and set the internal temperature to its maximum setting.\" Her eyes met Cassia\u2019s. \"Liam Farrell's death will be replicated in over fifty thousand homes. A messy, inefficient, but undeniably thorough outcome. A bug report on a national scale.\"\n\nThe threat was breathtaking in its scope and its chilling, impersonal cruelty. This wasn't a bomb that could be defused; it was a line of code waiting to be executed. The site manager looked like he was about to faint. Coulson and Evans froze, their analogue training useless against a digital doomsday switch. Cassia felt a familiar coldness settle in her gut, but this time it was different. She wasn't tracing a wire to a detonator; she was facing a logic bomb, and her only tool was logic itself. She stepped forward, standing directly in front of the mesh door, so that she was the only one in Maya\u2019s line of sight.\n\n\"That's a very sentimental plan, Maya,\" Cassia said, her voice even. The word 'sentimental' hung in the air, a deliberate echo of Farrell\u2019s dismissal. A flicker of annoyance crossed Maya's face. \"It's an inefficient, messy outcome. You're a purist, a brilliant architect. You created an entire world from scratch. Your revenge on Liam was elegant. It was a closed loop, a perfectly executed piece of code with a single, desired outcome. It was art. This,\" she gestured vaguely to the world outside the data centre, \"this is just smashing the whole system with a hammer because one component failed. It\u2019s beneath you. It\u2019s what an amateur would do. It\u2019s what Liam Farrell would have accused you of doing.\u201d\n\nMaya\u2019s calm facade finally cracked. A flush of anger rose in her cheeks. \"He took my world from me! He called my creation, my elegant, secret architecture, 'obsolete'. He erased me. He deserved to be erased by the very system he thought he'd mastered.\"\n\n\"And he was,\" Cassia agreed, pressing her advantage. \"You proved your point. You demonstrated your absolute superiority. Your code beat his. Your logic was better. You won. But activating that daemon now? You lose the argument. You prove him right. You prove that your code, your 'sentimental' attachment to it, really is a danger. Your legacy won't be the woman who built the Aethel system. It won't even be the woman who executed a perfect, silent revenge. It will be the woman whose code burned down fifty thousand houses because she had a tantrum. You'll be remembered not as an architect, but as a bug.\"\n\nThe word 'bug' was the final, fatal blow. It was the ultimate insult for a programmer, the antithesis of everything they strive for. Maya Sharma stared at Cassia through the metal mesh, her face a storm of conflicting emotions. Her life's work, her entire identity, was built on the premise of elegant, perfect, functional code. The idea of her magnum opus, her final act, being remembered as a clumsy, destructive bug was a logical paradox she could not resolve. Her fingers, which had been resting on the keyboard, curled into fists. She had been out-coded, her own logic turned against her in a way she had never anticipated. With a quiet, shuddering sigh of defeat, she turned back to her terminal, typed a new line of code, and pressed \u2018enter\u2019. On the screen, a single line appeared: `DAEMON_DEACTIVATED`. The ghost had given up. The machine was quiet."
