     "novel_text": "The hiss of the grill was a constant serpent in the background of Lucie\u2019s life. It was the sound of another plate of eggs going cold, another trucker\u2019s special being born into a world of beige and grease. The Gopher Hole Diner on Gaetz Avenue wasn\u2019t a career; it was a holding pattern, a purgatory of sticky ketchup bottles and coffee brewed to the consistency of crude oil. Her hands, perpetually chapped, smelled of fried onions and the lemon-scented disinfectant she used to wipe down the vinyl booths. She moved through the narrow aisles with an economy of motion learned over two years of balancing hot plates and dodging the wandering hands of regulars who thought a tip bought them a piece of her. Most days, Lucie didn't mind. She could turn a part of her brain off, the part that dreamt, and just become a pair of hands, a voice that said, \"More coffee, hon?\"\n\nBut tonight, the serpent on the grill seemed to be whispering a name. *Finch. Alistair Finch.* The name was all wrong for Red Deer. It belonged in a leather-bound book, not on a class roster at the community college. She swiped a damp cloth over a table, chasing a smear of syrup into oblivion, but his voice was in her head, a low current beneath the diner's clatter. It wasn't a voice for ordering a lumberjack breakfast. It was a voice that could make a Tuesday night poetry class feel like a secret confession. A voice that took the dead words of Keats and breathed a feverish, desperate life back into them.\n\nHe had read from 'Ode on a Grecian Urn' last night. The other students, a mix of welders upgrading their high school English and bored housewives looking for a diversion, had stared blankly at their photocopied sheets. Their pens were still. But Lucie had felt the words land inside her like stones dropped into a deep well, the ripples spreading out into the forgotten, silent corners of her. *\"Bold Lover, never, never canst thou kiss, Though winning near the goal\u2014yet, do not grieve; She cannot fade, though thou hast not thy bliss, For ever wilt thou love, and she be fair!\"*\n\nMr. Finch had looked up then, his gaze sweeping over the fluorescent-lit room, his eyes a tired, intelligent gray. They were the color of a winter sky just before the snow begins to fall. He had a way of looking at you that made you feel utterly exposed, as though he could see the title of every unread book on your soul\u2019s shelf. His eyes had passed over Brenda from accounting and fat old Gary who snored in the back row, and then they had stopped. On her. Lucie Moreau, in her worn-out hoodie, her pen clutched so tight her knuckles were white.\n\n\"Miss Moreau,\" he'd said, and the 'Moreau' had sounded exotic, French, not the flat, anglicized 'Morrow' everyone else used. \"What do you make of that? This eternal, unfulfilled love. Is it a tragedy or a kind of perfection?\"\n\nThe whole room had turned to look at her. She felt a hot blush creep up her neck, a betrayal. She was the waitress, the background character. She wasn't supposed to have an opinion on Grecian urns. She could feel the sticky residue of the diner on her skin, imagined she smelled of bacon.\n\n\"I think...\" she'd started, her voice a reedy thing, \"I think it\u2019s the saddest thing I\u2019ve ever heard.\"\n\nA few people had snickered. But Mr. Finch hadn't. He had leaned forward slightly, resting his elbows on the lectern, his worn tweed jacket bunching at the shoulders. \"Go on,\" he\u2019d urged, his voice soft, coaxing.\n\n\"It\u2019s not perfect,\" she'd said, the words coming out in a rush, a jumble. \"It\u2019s a trap. They're stuck. He never gets her, but she never gets to leave. She\u2019s just\u2026 decoration. For his forever love. It's not her life anymore. It\u2019s just part of his story.\"\n\nThe room was silent. Utterly. The hum of the projector fan was the only sound. Mr. Finch had stared at her for a long, unblinking moment. A strange, small smile played on his lips, a flicker of warmth in the cool gray of his eyes. \"That,\" he had said, very quietly, \"is an exceptionally insightful reading, Miss Moreau. Thank you.\" And then he had moved on, but the connection, the brief, intense current that had passed between the lectern and her desk in the third row, had lingered in the air like an electrical charge.\n\n\"Order up!\" barked Sal from the kitchen window, shattering the memory. A platter with a steak, bleeding slightly onto a pile of limp fries, slid onto the pass.\n\nLucie grabbed it. \"Table four, got it,\" she called back, her diner-voice seamlessly taking over. She delivered the plate to a man whose face was a roadmap of broken capillaries and whose hands were calloused from a lifetime of turning wrenches. He grunted without looking up. She refilled his coffee, smiled her practiced, empty smile, and walked back towards the kitchen, the echo of Mr. Finch's \"Thank you\" a secret music only she could hear.\n\nHer life was a world of such stark contrasts. There was the Gopher Hole, all noise and grease and blunt needs. Then there were those two hours every Tuesday and Thursday night, a sterile classroom made sacred by the presence of one man and the ghosts of long-dead poets he summoned. He was maybe forty, with fine lines around his eyes and threads of silver in his dark, untidy hair. He looked tired. Not the physical exhaustion Lucie knew from being on her feet for ten hours, but a deeper, more profound weariness. A weariness of the soul. He wore his clothes like they were a costume he'd been forced into and had long since given up trying to fill properly. Ink stains on his cuffs. A faint, pleasant scent of old paper, tobacco, and something else\u2014something clean and wintry, like gin.\n\nAfter that class, as she was stuffing her notebook into her bag, he\u2019d called her name again. \"Miss Moreau. A moment.\"\n\nShe had approached the desk, her heart doing a nervous little tap dance against her ribs. The other students were a departing stream, their chatter about weekend plans and the hockey game fading down the hall.\n\n\"Your last essay,\" he said, pulling a thin sheaf of papers from a folder. Hers. \"On Wordsworth.\" He tapped it with a long finger. \"You write with a very\u2026 raw honesty. It\u2019s unpolished, but it\u2019s there. The feeling.\" He handed it to her. At the top, in a spidery, elegant script, he\u2019d written *A+*, but it was the comment at the end she read later, under the dim light of a bus stop, that made her stop breathing for a second. *'You see the world as a poet does, even if you don't know it yet. Don't let the world grind that out of you.'*\n\nHis fingers had brushed hers as she took the paper. A static shock, no bigger than a pinprick, but it shot up her arm and settled somewhere deep in her chest. She\u2019d looked up at him, and in the empty classroom, under the cold lights, he seemed less like a teacher and more like just a man. A sad, tired man who saw something in her that no one else had ever bothered to look for.\n\n\"Thank you, sir,\" she\u2019d managed to whisper.\n\n\"Alistair,\" he\u2019d corrected her, his voice even lower than usual. \"In the hall. Outside of class. My name is Alistair.\"\n\nAlistair. The name felt heavy and strange on her tongue, a word from a foreign language she was only just beginning to learn. She hadn\u2019t dared to say it. She\u2019d just nodded, clutched her essay to her chest like a holy relic, and fled. She walked all the way home that night, ignoring the bus, the cold prairie wind whipping at her face. The streets of Red Deer, usually so drab and familiar, seemed charged with a new, thrilling strangeness. The sodium lights of the strip malls cast long, dramatic shadows. The distant train whistle was a lonely, romantic cry. The world hadn't changed, but she had. A door had been opened a crack, showing her a glimpse of a room she never knew existed, and a man named Alistair was holding the key. Now, even the hiss of the grill sounded like the beginning of a song.The song of the grill played on, a percussive counterpoint to the jukebox\u2019s tired rotation of classic rock. But for Lucie, the diner\u2019s soundscape was muted, filtered through the memory of Alistair\u2019s voice. She refilled sugar dispensers, her hands moving with their own ingrained intelligence, while her mind was miles and hours away, dissecting every word, every glance. The comment on her essay was seared into her brain: *You see the world as a poet does*. No one had ever said anything like that to her. Her parents had seen a future dental hygienist. Her ex-boyfriend, a guy who worked on the rigs, had seen a convenient, warm body for his two weeks back in town. The customers at the Gopher Hole saw a function, a human mechanism for delivering coffee. Alistair Finch saw a poet. The idea was so foreign, so ludicrously beautiful, that it made her chest ache.\n\nA hand shot out and grabbed her wrist as she passed by Booth 7. It was Earl, a trucker with a gut that strained the buttons of his plaid shirt and a leering grin that always made Lucie\u2019s skin crawl. He was one of the \u201cwandering hands\u201d regulars.\n\u201cHey there, Lucy-Goosey,\u201d he slurred, his breath a foul mix of stale beer and coffee. \u201cYou\u2019re lookin\u2019 mighty serious tonight. Smile a little. It ain\u2019t gonna kill ya.\u201d\nUsually, she would pull her arm away with a tight, forced smile and a placating, \u201cComin\u2019 right up with that pie, Earl.\u201d It was part of the uniform, the practiced de-escalation. But tonight, the words from the Grecian Urn echoed in her head. *She cannot fade*. She felt the heat of his skin against hers, the greasy pressure of his thumb. She thought of the girl on the urn, a decoration for someone else\u2019s story. A hot, unfamiliar anger surged through her, sharp and clean. She stopped, turned her head slowly, and met his gaze. She didn\u2019t smile.\n\u201cLet go of my arm, Earl,\u201d she said. Her voice wasn\u2019t loud, but it was flat and cold, entirely stripped of its usual \u201chon\u201d and \u201csweetie\u201d affectations. The man\u2019s grin faltered. He blinked, surprised by the directness, the lack of a playful retreat. He saw something new in her eyes, a hardness he wasn\u2019t used to. After a beat, his hand dropped away.\n\u201cJust bein\u2019 friendly,\u201d he mumbled, turning his attention back to his half-eaten burger, suddenly looking defensive. Lucie walked away without another word, her heart hammering, not with fear, but with a wild, exhilarating sense of power. The serpent on the grill seemed to hiss its approval.\n\nSal watched the exchange from his window, one bushy eyebrow raised. When Lucie came back to the pass to grab a check, he grunted. \u201cYou finally growin\u2019 a spine, Moreau?\u201d\n\u201cJust tired of it,\u201d she said, not looking at him as she scribbled the total for table two.\n\u201c\u2019Bout time,\u201d he said, turning back to his flat-top and scraping it down with a vengeance, sending a shower of greasy sparks into the hood vent. \u201cThis place\u2019ll eat you alive if you let it.\u201d Sal had been at the Gopher Hole for fifteen years. He was as much a fixture as the cracked linoleum floor. He rarely spoke more than three words to her at a time, but in his gruff way, Lucie knew he watched out for her. He saw her, too, but not as a poet. He saw her as a younger, less-scarred version of himself, another soul caught in the Gopher Hole\u2019s gravitational pull. His concern, unlike Alistair\u2019s praise, felt like an anchor.\n\nThe last of the late-night crowd shuffled out after midnight, leaving behind a wake of dirty dishes and crumpled napkins. The fluorescent lights hummed into the quiet, making the streaks on the floor and the grime in the corners seem more pronounced. This was Lucie\u2019s favorite and least favorite part of the night. The work was mindless\u2014stacking chairs, mopping the sticky floors, marrying the half-empty ketchup bottles\u2014but the silence was a vacuum that was usually filled with her own exhaustion and a bleak accounting of her dwindling savings. Tonight, however, the silence was a canvas. She wiped down the last of the vinyl seats, the smell of lemon disinfectant failing to mask the phantom scent of old paper and gin that clung to her memory. She saw Alistair\u2019s tired, intelligent eyes, the way his worn jacket hung on his frame, the ink on his fingers. He was a puzzle, a man who spoke of eternal beauty but seemed steeped in a profound, personal melancholy.\n\nFinally, she untied the stained apron, stuffing it into her locker along with the smell of fried onions and the ghost of Earl\u2019s unwelcome touch. Shrugging on her thin jacket, she stepped out of the back door into the sharp, clean shock of the autumn night. The air was cold, smelling of approaching winter. The diner was a box of garish light and noise behind her, and the street was a quiet ribbon of darkness. She pulled her essay from her bag, the pages cool against her fingers. Under a streetlight, she read his comment again, the spidery script a secret code just for her. *'Don't let the world grind that out of you.'* It was a plea. A command. A promise. She clutched the papers to her chest, the A+ a distant second to the validation of those twelve words. The world he was talking about, the one that grinds you down, was the Gopher Hole. It was Earl\u2019s hand and cold eggs and a life lived in a holding pattern. Alistair didn\u2019t know the specifics, but he had seen the pressure of it on her, and he had told her to resist. He had given her a weapon. She started the long walk home, the city no longer drab but full of dark, poetic corners, each shadow a verse waiting to be read.The wind bit at her cheeks, a dry, prairie cold that carried the scent of distant fields and diesel fumes. But tonight, Lucie didn't huddle into her jacket. She walked with her head up, her gaze tracing the geometric tangle of power lines against the star-dusted sky. She saw them not as urban blight but as a kind of stark, industrial lace. The pawn shop on the corner, its windows barred and its neon sign flickering a desperate pink, wasn't just a place of last resorts; it was a museum of forgotten dreams, full of gold rings and guitars that had once promised stardom. She was seeing what he saw. Or, more terrifyingly, she was seeing what she had always seen, but had never had the language, or the permission, to articulate. His words weren't a key; they were a mirror, showing her a self she hadn't known was there.\n\nHer apartment was a basement suite in a squat bungalow on a street of identical squat bungalows. The air inside was always a little damp and smelled of the old carpet and the faint, persistent mildew that bloomed in the corners of the single, high window. It was the epitome of her holding-pattern life: cheap, functional, and devoid of personality. Usually, she walked in, dropped her keys in the bowl by the door, and fell onto the lumpy futon, too tired to do anything but stare at the water-stained ceiling. But tonight was different. She turned on the single lamp, its weak yellow light a poor substitute for the moon, and the small space seemed not just bleak, but unbearable. It was a physical manifestation of the life he had warned her against letting herself be ground down into.\n\nShe shed her jacket and the lingering scent of the Gopher Hole with it. In the tiny, cramped bathroom, she stared at her reflection in the cheap, clouded mirror. Her face was pale with fatigue, her hair pulled back in a messy bun from which strands had escaped over the course of her shift. She saw the faint lines of exhaustion around her eyes, the chapped texture of her lips. This was the face that belonged to \"hon\" and \"sweetie,\" the face that poured endless cups of coffee. But for a moment, under the hum of the bathroom fan, she saw something else flicker in her own eyes. The hardness that had stared down Earl. The focused intensity that had found the trap in Keats\u2019s eternal love. The raw honesty Alistair had seen on the page. She was both people, the waitress and the poet, and the space between them was a chasm she was suddenly, desperately afraid she might fall into.\n\nIgnoring the hunger gnawing at her stomach, she bypassed the kitchen and sat on the edge of her futon, her essay on Wordsworth spread on her lap. She had written about his ability to find profundity in the common, the way he elevated a field of daffodils or a solitary reaper into something monumental. She\u2019d connected it to her own life, writing about the fleeting, unexpected moments of grace she sometimes witnessed in the diner\u2014the silent kindness of a trucker paying for a younger man\u2019s meal, the way the morning light hit a glass of water and shattered into a rainbow on the table. She had thought it was sentimental nonsense, the kind of thing you write for an easy grade. She hadn't realized she was writing a manifesto for her own survival. *'You see the world as a poet does, even if you don't know it yet.'* She traced his script with her finger. He hadn't just given her an A+; he had given her a name for the part of herself she had always kept hidden, the part that dreamt. Now, the question was what to do with it. The Gopher Hole loomed tomorrow, a thirteen-hour double shift. But beyond that, forty-eight hours away, was Thursday. Two hours in a sterile room that had become the most alive place she knew. Two hours with the tired, sad man who held the key.The next morning, the alarm clock was a brutal dentist\u2019s drill to the skull. For a fleeting, blissful moment, Lucie lay tangled in her thin sheets, her mind still adrift in a sea of Grecian urns and wintry gray eyes. Then the reality of the thirteen-hour double shift landed with the thud of a sack of potatoes in her gut. Wednesday. The long, hard middle of the week, a mountain of grease and drudgery that had to be scaled to get to the small, sacred plateau of Thursday night. She swung her legs out of bed, her muscles aching in protest, the phantom weight of heavy platters already settling on her forearms. The poetic musings of the night before felt like a dream belonging to someone else, someone rested and clean and not facing a day that would be measured in coffee pots and bacon platters.\n\nAs she pulled on her uniform\u2014the black pants that were shiny at the knees and the faded pink polo shirt with the Gopher Hole logo embroidered over the heart\u2014she caught her reflection again. This time, she didn't see a poet. She saw a tired girl bracing for a long day. But the memory of Alistair\u2019s comment was a small, defiant pilot light glowing in the back of her mind. *Don\u2019t let the world grind that out of you.* Today, the world would be trying its absolute best. She braided her hair tightly, a practical, war-like measure against the heat and steam of the kitchen, and for the first time, she packed a small, slim notebook and a pen into her bag, tucking them into the side pocket, away from her wallet and keys. It felt like a ridiculous, hopeful gesture, like bringing a flower to a battlefield.\n\nThe Gopher Hole smelled the same as it always did at seven in the morning: stale coffee, bleach, and the anticipatory heat of the grill coming to life. Sal was already there, a silhouette moving in the dim kitchen, his radio tuned to a classic rock station that was just loud enough to be an irritant. The day began not with a bang, but with the familiar, grinding rhythm of the breakfast rush. The booths filled with construction workers and early-starting truckers, men who wanted their coffee hot, black, and now. Lucie\u2019s body took over, a well-oiled machine of efficiency. She moved, she poured, she wrote down orders in her looping, shorthand scrawl. \"Two eggs over-easy, bacon crisp, side of rye,\" she called to Sal, her voice slipping into the easy, professional cadence of the diner. She was the waitress again, a pair of hands and a voice that said, \"You got it, sweetie.\"\n\nYet, something was different. The separation she usually maintained, the part of her brain she could switch off, wasn't fully offline. It was observing, taking notes. She watched a young couple in a corner booth, barely twenty, sharing a plate of pancakes because it was all they could afford. He would cut a piece, load it with syrup, and slide it onto her fork. She would look at him with an adoration so naked and unguarded it was almost painful to watch. Lucie felt a pang, not of envy, but of a strange, tender recognition. It was a Wordsworth poem unfolding in Booth 3, a moment of sublime, unselfconscious beauty amid the clatter. She found herself smiling at them, a real smile, not the one she wore for tips. The girl, catching her eye, blushed and smiled back.\n\nLater, during the lull between breakfast and lunch, she found herself wiping down the counter, her gaze lost in the swirling patterns of the Formica. The surface was a universe of tiny scratches and faded stains, each one a fossil of a thousand forgotten meals. She thought of Alistair\u2019s hands, the long fingers stained with ink. She imagined him at his own desk, surrounded by towers of books, a cup of tea going cold as he got lost in a sentence, his brow furrowed in concentration. The image was so clear, so vivid, it felt like a memory. He was from a different world, a world where thoughts were the most important commodity, where the state of one\u2019s soul mattered more than the state of one\u2019s bank account. And he had invited her, just for a moment, to stand at the doorway to that world.\n\n\"Earth to Moreau,\" Sal\u2019s voice rasped, breaking the spell. \"Refill on three. Man looks like he's about to die of thirst.\" Lucie blinked, the diner snapping back into sharp, greasy focus. She grabbed the coffee pot, the heat warming her chapped hands. \"On it,\" she said. As she poured the black liquid into the man's thick ceramic mug, he grunted and slid a book he'd been reading to the side. It was a dog-eared paperback thriller, the cover depicting a shadowy man with a gun. It wasn't Keats, but it was a story. She saw the ink on the page, the way the man's thumb had smudged the cheap print. She saw the hunger for a world outside his own, a need for a narrative to lift him, for an hour, out of his life. For the first time, she didn't see the customer as just an empty cup to be filled. She saw a fellow traveler, looking for his own kind of escape. The thought was so surprising, so deeply empathetic, it almost made her stop pouring.The thirteen-hour shift unspooled like a roll of dirty bandages. By the time the lunch rush gave way to the afternoon lull, Lucie\u2019s feet were swollen and her smile felt like a mask hardening on her face. Yet, her mind was a hive of activity. She saw the lonely desperation in the eyes of the salesman nursing a single cup of coffee for two hours, his territory map spread on the table like a battle plan. She heard the music in the rhythmic clink of Sal\u2019s spatula against the grill, a frantic, greasy jazz. She felt the weight of the unspoken stories that hung in the air, thick as the smoke from a forgotten cigarette. The world hadn't changed, but her attention to it had become a sharp, focused instrument. The grinding down felt less like a destruction and more like a sharpening, honing her to a fine, dangerous point. When she finally stumbled into her basement apartment late that night, the exhaustion was so profound it was almost a spiritual state.\n\nIgnoring the lumpy futon\u2019s siren call, she dropped her bag on the small, wobbly table that served as her desk. She pulled out the new notebook. The clean, lined pages seemed to mock the grime under her fingernails. For a long time, she just stared at the first empty sheet, the cheap ballpoint pen feeling alien and heavy in her hand. What was she supposed to write? A poem? The idea was laughable. But the command from Alistair\u2019s essay comment echoed: *Don\u2019t let the world grind that out of you.* This, then, was an act of resistance. Her hand began to move, hesitantly at first, then with more confidence. She didn\u2019t write a poem. She wrote fragments, captions for the images stored in her head. *Booth 3: two kids, one fork. Love as a shared plate of pancakes.* *Formica counter: a galaxy of knife-scars.* *Sal\u2019s radio: AC/DC at 8 a.m. is the sound of giving up.* *The man with the thriller. His thumb smudging the words, wanting to be in the story.* She filled a page, then another. The words were simple, unadorned, but they were hers. They were proof. When she finally fell into a dreamless sleep, the pen was still uncapped on the table, a sentinel guarding her reclaimed thoughts.\n\nThursday arrived, cloaked in a nervous, electric hum. The shift at the diner was an exercise in suspended animation. Every customer was an obstacle, every order a delay, every hour a year standing between her and the community college. She moved through her tasks with a distracted air that earned her a sharp \"Get your head in the game, Moreau\" from Sal when she nearly sent a stack of clean plates crashing to the floor. She felt a frantic need to wash the day off her, to scrub away the scent of the Gopher Hole before she entered that classroom. After her shift, she raced home, showering quickly, the hot water stinging her chapped hands. She stared at her meager wardrobe with an unfamiliar anxiety. The worn-out hoodie felt like a costume from her old life. She settled on a plain black sweater, the nicest thing she owned. It was still anonymous, but it felt like a deliberate choice, a small signal to herself that tonight was different. She was not just a body in a chair; she was Miss Moreau, who had an exceptionally insightful reading.\n\nThe hallways of the college were quiet, smelling of floor wax and old paper. The fluorescent lights seemed less cold tonight, more like a gentle, clarifying glow. When she walked into the classroom, he was already there, leaning against the lectern, staring out the large window at the encroaching darkness. He looked even more tired than she remembered, the lines around his gray eyes etched deeper. He turned as the students began to file in, and his gaze swept the room with that same unnerving perception. It passed over her, then snagged, and for a heartbeat, his expression softened. There was no smile, just a flicker of recognition, a silent acknowledgment that passed between them like a secret handshake. Lucie\u2019s heart did its familiar nervous flutter, and she slid into her usual seat, her hands trembling slightly as she took out her notebook\u2014the one filled with her diner observations.\n\nTonight\u2019s photocopied sheets were a poem by Robert Frost, 'After Apple-Picking.' Alistair began to read, and the room fell away. His voice, that low current, wrapped around the words, filling them with the poet's bone-deep weariness and the strange, hallucinatory beauty of the harvest. *\"My instep arch not only keeps the ache, It keeps the pressure of a ladder-round. I feel the ladder sway as the boughs bend. And I keep hearing from the cellar bin The rumbling sound Of load on load of apples coming in.\"* Lucie felt the words in her own aching arches, in the phantom weight of platters on her arms. It was the same exhaustion she had felt last night, the same dream-like state where the day\u2019s work haunts the beginning of sleep. The poem wasn't about apples; it was about being consumed by your labor, about the residue of a life of physical toil that seeps into the soul.\n\nWhen he finished, the silence in the room was heavy, contemplative. \"This isn't just about a day's work, is it?\" Alistair asked the room at large, his eyes scanning the faces. \"Frost is talking about a kind of spiritual exhaustion. A life so full of sensory input, of *doing*, that sleep itself becomes just another landscape of the day's labor. What do you suppose he means by 'this sleep of mine, whatever sleep it is'?\" Brenda from accounting suggested it was about burnout. Gary, awake for once, mumbled something about retirement. Alistair listened patiently, nodding, but his gaze kept drifting back to Lucie. It wasn\u2019t a demand, but a quiet question. He was giving her the space to speak if she chose. She felt the words rising in her throat\u2014words about crude oil coffee and the hiss of the grill becoming the serpent in your dreams\u2014but they caught there, a knot of fear and exhilaration. She clutched her pen, her knuckles white, and said nothing, letting the moment pass.\n\nThe class ended, and the spell was broken. The students shuffled out, their chatter about the coming weekend filling the quiet space Alistair had created. Lucie packed her bag slowly, her mind replaying her own silence, her cowardice. She had a page full of notes connecting Frost's ladder-rungs to the worn linoleum of the Gopher Hole, and she had said nothing. She was the last one left. She risked a glance at the front of the room. He was still at the lectern, not packing his things, just standing there as if waiting. He looked directly at her, and the noise of the hallway, her own frantic heartbeat, everything seemed to fade. \"You were quiet tonight, Miss Moreau,\" he said, his voice soft in the now-empty room. \"I thought Frost might have spoken to you.\" He wasn't accusing; he was curious. He was asking why she hadn't shared.\n\nLucie swallowed, her throat dry. She walked towards the lectern, the few steps feeling like a mile-long journey across a swaying tightrope. She stopped a few feet away, clutching the strap of her bag. \"It was...\" she started, her voice barely a whisper. \"It was too close.\" The admission hung in the air between them, vulnerable and absolute. A strange look crossed his face\u2014not pity, but a deep, somber understanding. He pushed himself away from the lectern, closing the small distance between them. The faint scent of old paper and winter gin was there again, a clean, sharp scent in the sterile room. \"I know what you mean,\" he said, his voice dropping even lower. \"Sometimes a poem isn't a curiosity. Sometimes it\u2019s a diagnosis.\" He paused, his gray eyes holding hers. \"You said my name was Alistair outside of class. I think perhaps we're outside of class now.\"The name hung in the air, an offering and a challenge. *Alistair*. Lucie\u2019s tongue felt thick and useless in her mouth, the single word an impossible weight to lift. He was giving her permission to cross a line she hadn't even known was there, and the sudden proximity was dizzying, terrifying. She could only manage a small, jerky nod, her eyes wide, her knuckles white where she gripped the strap of her bag. He seemed to understand. He didn\u2019t press, didn\u2019t wait for her to parrot his name back to him. Instead, he leaned back against the lectern, creating a sliver of distance, a breath of air. His gaze, however, remained fixed on her, a steady, unwavering line of connection in the empty room.\n\n\"The residue of labor,\" he murmured, his voice a low counterpoint to the hum of the fluorescent lights. He picked up the thread of the poem as if it were a conversation they\u2019d been having for years. \"Frost knew. It gets under your fingernails, into the lines on your hands. But it\u2019s more than that. It seeps into your sleep, stains your dreams. You close your eyes and you're still on the ladder.\" He glanced down at his own hands, at the faint, bluish smudges of ink that haloed his nails and cuffs. \"Just a different kind of ladder.\"\n\nThe shared vulnerability in his words was a key turning a lock deep inside her. The fear receded, replaced by a powerful, magnetic pull of understanding. She was not alone in this feeling. He knew. He actually knew. \"It gets in your hearing,\" she said, the words surprising her with their clarity. \"I hear it even when it's quiet. The hiss of the grill. The clatter of plates. The order wheel spinning. It\u2019s a soundtrack that never stops.\" She was confessing a piece of her secret world, the bleak landscape of the Gopher Hole she guarded so carefully, and she watched his face for any sign of pity or revulsion. There was none. There was only a profound, listening stillness.\n\nHe absorbed her words, his tired gray eyes holding a deep, resonant empathy. He wasn\u2019t just hearing her; he was translating her experience into his own language, finding the universal truth within the specific, greasy detail. \"A constant serpent in the background,\" he mused, the phrase so perfect it was as if he\u2019d plucked it directly from her soul. He had no way of knowing she had thought those exact words. The coincidence was a small, sharp shock, a spark of static electricity in the charged air. He began packing his worn leather briefcase, his movements slow and deliberate, a stark contrast to the frantic energy that pulsed beneath Lucie\u2019s skin. He snapped the tarnished brass locks shut. \"I'm parked over on Ross Street. Are you walking that way?\"\n\nIt wasn't a question about directions. It was an invitation to let this moment, this strange and sacred bubble of quiet understanding, continue just a little longer. \"Yes,\" she breathed, the word coming out softer than she intended. He gave a slight nod, slinging the briefcase strap over his shoulder. The worn tweed of his jacket bunched up, and she had a sudden, absurd urge to smooth it down. They walked out of the classroom together, their footsteps echoing in the cavernous, empty hall. The sound was lonely but also intimate, a rhythm for two in the sleeping building. He didn't try to fill the silence with small talk. He seemed as comfortable in it as he was with the words of long-dead poets. For Lucie, who was used to the constant, demanding noise of the diner, the shared quiet was a new and profound form of communication.\n\nOutside, the night was cold and sharp. Their breath plumed in the air under the orange glow of the streetlights. The familiar streets of Red Deer seemed transformed, the mundane facades of insurance offices and vacant storefronts imbued with a shadowy, cinematic mystery. \"It's a strange town,\" Alistair said, as if reading her mind. \"All this frantic boom-and-bust energy, but underneath it feels\u2026 transient. As if everyone is just waiting for a signal to move on to somewhere else.\" He glanced at her. \"Do you feel that?\"\n\n\"It\u2019s a holding pattern,\" Lucie said without thinking, the phrase a cornerstone of her private vocabulary for her life. \"A purgatory of sticky ketchup bottles.\" The words were out before she could stop them, too raw, too specific. A hot blush crept up her neck. She had revealed too much of the Gopher Hole, of her own bitterness. But Alistair didn't laugh or recoil. A small, sad smile touched his lips. \"That\u2019s a poet\u2019s description, Miss Moreau.\" He paused, then corrected himself, his voice softer. \"Lucie.\"\n\nHer first name, spoken in his low cadence, was a revelation. It sounded new, polished, like an object of value. They reached the corner of Ross Street, the point where their paths would diverge. The moment was ending. A frantic panic seized her; she couldn't let it end like this. \"You should write that down,\" he said, gesturing vaguely with his free hand. \"The ketchup bottles. The serpent on the grill. It's good. It\u2019s real.\" In a rush of terrifying, exhilarating courage, Lucie stopped under the streetlight and clutched her bag. \"I did,\" she said, her voice shaking slightly. \"After the other night. I started writing it down.\"\n\nHe stopped and turned fully toward her. The streetlight carved his tired, intelligent face out of the darkness, illuminating the silver in his hair and the deep lines of weariness around his eyes. He looked at her, and then at the bag she was clutching as if it held the crown jewels. He understood the monumental effort of her admission. He didn't ask to see the notebook; he seemed to know that would be a violation, a step too far, too soon. The small, strange smile returned to his lips, but this time it reached his eyes, a flicker of genuine warmth in the cool gray. \"Good,\" he said, the word full of quiet approval. \"That\u2019s the most important part. Don\u2019t stop.\" He held her gaze for one more long, charged moment, a moment that felt like it contained entire volumes of unspoken conversation. Then he nodded once, a gesture of farewell and encouragement, and turned, his footsteps receding down the dark street, leaving Lucie standing alone in a halo of light, the sound of her own name echoing in the frozen air.Lucie walked the rest of the way home in a state of suspended grace. The cold prairie air was a blade, but she didn't feel it. She was insulated by a strange, humming warmth that had settled deep in her chest, a low, constant vibration. The echo of her name, *Lucie*, spoken in his voice, was a shield against the wind. It wasn't the flat, serviceable sound she was used to, the name barked by Sal or cooed by a customer; it was a word with texture and weight, a thing of substance. She walked past the darkened storefronts, their familiar drabness washed away by the lingering glow of the streetlight where he had stood. The world hadn't changed, but her place in it had been redrawn. She wasn't just a figure in the background anymore. She was Lucie. And a man named Alistair had seen her. He had not only seen her, he had given her a command: *Don't stop*.\n\nHer basement suite no longer felt like a cell. When she shut the door behind her, the damp, familiar quiet was not oppressive but private. It was a secret workshop, a darkroom where the images she had collected could be developed. She shed her coat and boots, the chill of the outside world sloughing away, and went directly to the wobbly table. The notebook lay waiting. She opened it to a fresh page, the ballpoint pen feeling less like an alien object and more like a proper tool. Her hand was steady now. She wrote the date, and then, without hesitation, she wrote his name. *Alistair*. The letters looked as strange and elegant on the page as they had sounded in the air. Beneath it, she began to write, trying to capture the conversation not just as a transcript, but as a scene. *The space between us in the empty classroom. The smell of gin and paper. He said a poem can be a diagnosis. He said my name.* She wrote until her eyelids were heavy, until the words began to blur, her small, cramped handwriting filling the page with the evidence of her own existence.\n\nThe next day, the hiss of the grill was not a serpent, but a subject. The Gopher Hole, in the harsh light of Friday morning, was exactly as she had left it\u2014a world of beige and grease. But Lucie was no longer its prisoner. She was its anthropologist, its secret chronicler. As she poured coffee for a table of men in grease-stained coveralls discussing the price of oil, she wasn't just a waitress; she was collecting data. She noted the way their hands, calloused and scarred, cradled the thick ceramic mugs with a surprising tenderness. She heard the forced bravado in their laughter and the deep weariness underneath it. She was a spy in the house of blunt needs, and her notebook, tucked safely in her locker, was her unseen intelligence report.\n\nDuring the mid-afternoon lull, she saw Sal leaning against the stainless-steel counter by the kitchen\u2019s back door, which was propped open to the alley. A thin stream of cold air and gray light cut into the kitchen\u2019s fug. He wasn\u2019t cleaning or prepping. He was just standing there, a lit cigarette held loosely between two fingers, staring out at the rust-stained wall of the building opposite. The rock station on his radio was playing a slow, mournful ballad she didn\u2019t recognize. His shoulders, usually squared in a posture of gruff defiance, were slumped. In that moment, he wasn\u2019t Sal, the cantankerous short-order cook. He was a man of fifty-something, trapped in a life he\u2019d likely never planned, stealing a ninety-second reprieve in a bleak alleyway. The image was so stark, so full of a quiet, unarticulated sorrow, that Lucie felt an ache of recognition. It was a poem. A Robert Frost poem about a different kind of wall. She felt a desperate urge to capture it, to pin the moment to a page before it vanished. On her next break, she didn't smoke or stare blankly at her phone. She retrieved her notebook from her locker and, hiding in the relative privacy of the staff bathroom, she wrote: *Sal in the alley. The cigarette smoke and his breath making the same ghost in the cold. A whole life in one tired slump.*\n\nThat weekend, for the first time in years, Lucie did not spend her day off sleeping until noon and then dreading her next shift. Saturday morning found her walking downtown with a strange sense of purpose. She bypassed the cheap clothing stores and the dollar shops and pushed open the heavy glass doors of the Red Deer Public Library. The sudden, hushed quiet was a shock to her system, a welcome balm after the diner\u2019s constant clamor. The air smelled of aging paper, binding glue, and floor polish\u2014a cleaner, more institutional version of Alistair\u2019s scent. She felt clumsy and out of place, her worn boots squeaking softly on the polished floor. For a moment, she almost turned and fled, feeling like an imposter. But the thought of Alistair\u2019s encouraging nod propelled her forward.\n\nShe wandered through the stacks, her fingers trailing along the spines of books, the sheer volume of words, of stories and ideas, was overwhelming. She found the poetry section, a quiet, dusty aisle near a large window overlooking the city park. She found the worn copies of Keats and Frost, their pages softened by the hands of countless readers. Then, on a whim, her heart thumping a nervous rhythm against her ribs, she went to the catalogue computer. Her fingers hovered over the keyboard. It felt like an invasion of privacy, a transgression. But her curiosity was a physical hunger. She typed his name into the author search: *Finch, Alistair*. The screen blinked, processed, and then returned the stark, disappointing result: *No entries found*. A part of her was crestfallen, the romantic notion of him as a famous, hidden poet deflating instantly. But another, larger part of her felt a strange sense of relief. He wasn't a commodity to be looked up and consumed. He was just a man. A tired, sad, intelligent man who taught a night class at a community college. This made the connection between them feel more real, less like a fan\u2019s admiration and more like a meeting of two solitary people in a transient town. She turned away from the computer, not with disappointment, but with a new resolve. If she couldn't read his words, she would read the words that had shaped him. She went back to the poetry aisle and, running her hand along the spines, she chose a book not by its famous author, but by its title: *The Winged Life*. She checked it out, the librarian stamping the card with a satisfying thud, and walked out into the bright, cold afternoon with the book held tightly in her hands. It was a key she had found for herself.The book was called *The Winged Life*, and its cover was a simple, stark blue, the title embossed in plain white letters. There was no author photo, no glowing reviews, just the promise of its name. Back in the quiet of her basement suite, the world of the Gopher Hole locked out for the night, Lucie handled the book as if it were a delicate, living thing. She opened it to a random page, the crisp paper cool beneath her fingers. The poems inside were not like the grand, sweeping odes of Keats or the earthy narratives of Frost. They were short, sharp, and dense, like splinters of glass. They spoke of cracks in the pavement where weeds grew, of the flicker of a television seen through a stranger\u2019s window, of the particular sadness of a child\u2019s lost mitten on a snow-covered bench. The poet, a woman named Eleanor Vance she had never heard of, seemed to find the whole of human experience in these tiny, overlooked details. One poem, just six lines long, made Lucie read it over and over again: *The cage is not the bars, / but the forgetting of the sky. / So I study the small patch / visible from my window, / memorize its shifting moods, / and call that flight.* Lucie closed her eyes, the words echoing in the quiet room. She called that flight.\n\nThe next few days at the diner were a quiet revolution. Lucie moved through the familiar chaos, but with a new lens screwed tight over her vision. She was a student of the small patch of sky visible from her cage. The rhythmic drip of the faulty faucet in the back sink wasn\u2019t an annoyance; it was a water clock, measuring out her life in tiny, silver increments. The constellation of cigarette burns on the vinyl seat of Booth 9 wasn\u2019t just vandalism; it was a star chart of late-night anxieties and lonely conversations. Earl, the trucker with the wandering hands, came in for his usual lunch special, but Lucie no longer saw just a lecherous old man. She saw the profound loneliness in the way he stared at the salt shaker, turning it over and over in his hands as if it held an answer, his need for contact so desperate and clumsy it could only express itself as a violation. She felt not forgiveness, but a cold, clear-eyed pity that was far more unnerving. The world had not become more beautiful, but it had become infinitely more interesting, and every detail was a piece of evidence for a truth she was just beginning to understand.\n\nHer notebook became a constant companion, a place of refuge and labor. The initial fragments and observations started to coalesce into something more deliberate. She would sit on her break, the scent of bleach and onions clinging to her clothes, and struggle to find the precise word. The coffee wasn't just 'strong'; it was 'aggressively bitter', a 'liquid grudge'. The morning light didn't just 'hit' a glass of water; it 'detonated', throwing 'shrapnel of rainbow' across the table. She wrote about the young couple sharing pancakes again, but this time she tried to describe the careful geometry of their shared meal, the way his fork shielded hers. She wrote about Sal and his cigarette, trying to capture the exact shade of gray of the alley wall and the smoke and his mood. Most of what she wrote felt clumsy, overwrought, a pale imitation of the effortless clarity in *The Winged Life*. But the act of trying, of wrestling with language, was itself a kind of flight. She was no longer just letting the world happen to her; she was meeting it head-on, armed with a pen.\n\nThe hours leading up to Tuesday night\u2019s class were stretched taut with a nervous energy unlike anything she had felt before. It was no longer just about seeing him, about basking in the brief glow of his attention. It was about returning to that room as a different person. She had done the work. She had read the book, she had filled the pages of her notebook. She was coming back not as an empty vessel waiting to be filled, but as someone with her own small, fiercely-won store of knowledge. She showered with meticulous care, scrubbing the diner from her skin, and put on the same black sweater, which now felt less like her nicest thing and more like a uniform for this other, truer self. As she walked to the college, the cold air bracing, she felt a tremor of fear. What if he saw no difference? What if her insights were just sentimental nonsense after all? The thought was a cold stone in her stomach.\n\nShe slipped into the classroom and took her seat. He was there, as always, leaning against the side of his desk, nursing a cup of tea in a paper cup. He looked up as she came in, and his eyes found hers across the room. The silent acknowledgment was there again, but deeper this time, imbued with the memory of their shared walk, of her name spoken in the cold night air. It was a confirmation that the connection was not a thing she had imagined. A quiet confidence settled over her, displacing the fear. He began the class, his voice washing over the room, and on the photocopied handout was a poem she had never seen before, by William Carlos Williams. It was breathtakingly simple. *so much depends / upon / a red wheel / barrow / glazed with rain / water / beside the white / chickens.* He read it twice, then looked up, his expression patient, waiting.\n\nThe usual silence descended, thicker than ever. Brenda from accounting stared at the page as if it were a faulty invoice. Gary in the back was already breathing heavily, his eyes half-closed. The poem, with its stark simplicity, offered no obvious hooks for interpretation. \"Well?\" Alistair asked, a hint of amusement in his voice. \"Is that it? Is that a poem? Or did Williams just write down his shopping list?\" A few nervous chuckles rippled through the room. His gaze drifted, as it always did, and finally came to rest on Lucie. It was not a demand. It was an open door. He had seen the way she clutched her pen, the focused intensity on her face. He was waiting.\n\nTaking a slow, deliberate breath, Lucie heard her own voice, steady and clear, fill the quiet. \"It's about paying attention,\" she said. The entire room seemed to turn in slow motion. \"It's not about the wheelbarrow, not really. It could have been anything. It could have been a coffee cup, or a salt shaker.\" She felt a flush rise in her cheeks, but she pushed on, the words from her notebook and her heart aligning. \"So much depends on it because he *chose* to look at it. He stopped and he really saw it. The color, the texture of the rainwater, everything. The poem is the act of seeing. That\u2019s what makes it important.\" She stopped, her heart pounding, the confession of her own secret project laid bare in her analysis. The room was utterly still. She looked at Alistair. The tiredness in his face had been replaced by a look of sharp, arrested concentration. The small, sad smile was gone. In its place was a look of profound, undisguised astonishment, as if he had planted a common seed in a forgotten corner of a garden and had come back to find it had grown into a strange and exotic flower.Alistair\u2019s face, for a long, unblinking moment, was a mask of pure, unguarded surprise. The faint, weary lines around his eyes seemed to smooth out, his posture straightened, and the teacher receded, leaving only the man, utterly arrested by her words. The silence in the classroom was no longer heavy or awkward; it was electric, charged with the weight of her revelation. He blinked once, slowly, as if coming out of a trance. A strange, small smile played on his lips, but it was unlike the sad, fleeting ones she had seen before. This one was sharp with intellectual delight and something that looked almost like pride.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said, and the single word resonated in the quiet room, a low note of confirmation. He didn't look at the rest of the class, his gaze remained locked on her. \"That is it, precisely. The poem isn't the wheelbarrow. The poem is the act of attention. It is a declaration that this, this one small, ordinary thing, is worthy of being seen. It's an act of rescue. Of consecration.\" He leaned forward, his voice dropping slightly, becoming more intimate, a secret shared with her in a room full of people. \"Thank you, Lucie. That was an exceptional reading. Perfectly put.\" Then, as if remembering his duty, he reluctantly pulled his gaze away from her and addressed the blank faces of the other students, but the thread between the lectern and her desk in the third row remained, humming with an invisible current that made the air around her feel warm.\n\nThe rest of the class passed in a blur. Alistair spoke about Imagism, about precision and the rejection of sentimentality, but for Lucie, his words were just a distant soundtrack to the echoing loop of his praise. *Perfectly put.* She had done it. She had taken the chaotic, greasy details of her life, filtered them through the lens of a half-understood poem, and articulated a truth that he, a man of books and learning, had recognized as his own. When the class was dismissed, the usual shuffling of bags and scraping of chairs felt jarring, an intrusion from a different, less vibrant world. Brenda from accounting shot Lucie a look of pure, unadulterated confusion as she passed, a look that said, *Who do you think you are?* Lucie barely noticed.\n\nShe packed her bag with deliberate slowness, her hands steady. She did not feel the need to flee this time. She felt rooted, solid, a quiet confidence settling into her bones. As she knew he would, he waited until the last student had disappeared down the hall. \"Lucie,\" he said, and she turned to face him, her bag clutched in her hand not as a shield, but as an anchor. He had already packed his briefcase but was making no move to leave. \"That was more than just a good answer tonight. What you described\u2026 the act of seeing. That\u2019s the work. That\u2019s all there is, in the end.\"\n\n\"I've been practicing,\" she confessed, her voice soft but sure. \"At my job. I started writing things down.\" The admission was terrifying, but necessary. He needed to know that his words had not fallen into a void. \"I found a book at the library, too. A poet named Eleanor Vance.\"\n\nA flicker of recognition, and then a profound sadness, passed through his eyes. He knew the name. Of course he knew. He ran a hand through his untidy dark hair, the silver threads catching the light. \"Ah, Eleanor Vance,\" he said, his voice quiet. \"*The Winged Life*. She knew a thing or two about cages.\" The way he said it implied a personal connection, another piece of his own private, melancholy history. He looked at her then, with an intensity that made her feel as though he could see the scribbled pages of her notebook right through the canvas of her bag. \"You're building your own ladder, aren't you? Out of what you see.\"\n\nThe metaphor, a direct echo from Frost\u2019s poem, was so perfect, so deeply understanding, that it took her breath away. All she could do was nod. He studied her for a moment longer, a silent debate seeming to play out behind his eyes. The teacher, the sad, tired man, the intellectual\u2014all the facets of him she had glimpsed seemed to be in conversation. Finally, he came to a decision. \"I would be very interested to talk with you about what you're writing,\" he said, the words careful, deliberate. \"Not as a teacher with a student. But just as\u2026 two people who are interested in the same things. In paying attention.\" He paused, and the air grew thick with unspoken possibility. \"There's a quiet coffee shop on Little Gaetz, The Red Burl. Would you be willing to meet me there this Saturday? Around two?\"\n\nIt was not a date. It was not a lesson. It was something else entirely, a category of invitation for which Lucie had no name. It was an offer to step out of the roles they had been assigned, out of the holding pattern of her life and the weariness of his, and meet on neutral ground. The ground of poetry. The ground of paying attention. \"Yes,\" she said, her voice a reedy whisper, but her heart shouting the word. \"I'd like that very much.\"\n\n\"Good,\" he said, a genuine, unguarded smile finally breaking through the weariness. It transformed his face, making him look younger. \"Saturday, then.\" He gave her a final nod, a gesture that was no longer just one of encouragement, but one of anticipation, and then he was gone. Lucie stood alone in the empty classroom, the silence now a ringing, joyful thing. She had a destination. Saturday. For the first time in as long as she could remember, the future was not a monotonous, repeating loop of shifts at the Gopher Hole. It was a single, shining point of light, a time and a place she could walk toward. The serpent on the grill could hiss all it wanted. She was learning to fly.The days between Tuesday\u2019s promise and Saturday\u2019s destination were a strange, suspended reality. The Gopher Hole was no longer a purgatory; it was a waiting room. The hiss of the grill was not a serpent but the ticking of a clock, counting down the hours. Lucie moved through the familiar chaos of the breakfast and lunch rushes with a new, serene detachment. She poured coffee, she balanced plates, she smiled her waitress-smile, but a vital part of her was held in reserve, kept clean and safe for Saturday. She was performing a role she now knew was temporary, and this knowledge lent her movements a strange, fluid grace. She was not a prisoner pacing her cell; she was a traveler with a confirmed ticket, waiting patiently for her departure. The grease, the noise, the blunt needs of the customers\u2014none of it could truly touch her.\n\nSal, from his grease-spattered kingdom behind the pass, watched her with narrowed eyes. He was accustomed to her rhythms, the subtle shifts in her posture that signaled fatigue or frustration. This new calm was foreign, unsettling. She was efficient, more so than ever, but her eyes were distant, focused on a landscape he couldn't see. On Friday, during a lull, he wiped down his stainless-steel counter and grunted in her direction. \"Something you're not tellin' me, Moreau?\" he asked, his voice a low rasp. \"You been floatin' around here for two days like you hit the lottery.\" Lucie, who was refilling salt shakers, looked up and gave him a small, genuine smile that didn't quite reach her guarded eyes. \"Just a good week, Sal,\" she said. He grunted again, unconvinced. \"Uh-huh. Looks more like you got a secret.\" He turned away, scraping the grill with a sharp, aggressive clang, as if trying to shatter her peaceful new world with the diner's harsh music. He was right. She did have a secret, and it was a language he would never understand.\n\nThe night before the meeting was a torment of quiet anxiety. In her basement suite, the silence was not a canvas but a mirror, reflecting her own insecurities back at her. She sat with her notebook open on the wobbly table, the pages filled with her cramped, earnest handwriting. She read over her descriptions of the diner, and a hot wave of shame washed over her. *'Liquid grudge.' 'Shrapnel of rainbow.'* It sounded childish, melodramatic, the work of an amateur trying on a poet\u2019s voice and finding it didn't fit. What would he think of this? He, who spoke of Keats and Frost as if they were old friends. He, whose sadness seemed so deep and authentic. She was about to show him this messy, pathetic little book, her soul\u2019s unread shelf exposed completely. The gulf between his world of quiet, scholarly dignity and her world of sticky ketchup bottles seemed impossibly wide. For a terrifying hour, she considered not going. She could call the college and leave a message, feigning sickness. She could retreat to the safety of her anonymity. But then she read the last thing she had written, after Tuesday\u2019s class: *He said my name.* It was a fact, solid and real. She closed the notebook. She would go.\n\nSaturday dawned bright and cold, the sky a vast, unforgiving blue. The day stretched before her, an expanse of empty hours leading to two o\u2019clock. She cleaned her small apartment with a frantic energy, scrubbing away the phantom grime of the Gopher Hole, trying to make her own small space worthy of the person she hoped to be when she left it. When the time came to get ready, she chose the black sweater with the care of a bride choosing her wedding dress. It was simple, anonymous, but it was a choice. It was her uniform for this other life. Her biggest struggle was with the notebook. It felt both like the most important thing she owned and a source of profound embarrassment. To bring it was an act of audacious hope; to leave it behind would be an act of cowardice. With a deep breath, she slipped it into her canvas bag, where it lay against her hip like a small, dense weight, a talisman of her own making.\n\nShe walked to the coffee shop, choosing to be early. The route took her along a quieter street than her usual path home from the diner, a stretch called Little Gaetz Avenue, lined with old brick buildings that housed small, independent businesses\u2014a bookstore, an antique shop, a law office. The Red Burl was nestled between them, its sign a simple piece of carved wood, its large front window clean and inviting. It was a world away from the Gopher Hole\u2019s buzzing neon and peeling vinyl. This was a place built for lingering, for conversation, for quiet contemplation. It was a place where a cup of coffee wasn't just fuel, but an event. Her heart hammered against her ribs as she pushed open the heavy wooden door, a small bell announcing her arrival with a gentle chime.\n\nThe air inside was warm and smelled of dark roast coffee, cinnamon, and old wood. Soft, instrumental music played from unseen speakers. And there he was. He was sitting at a small, round table in the back corner, next to a tall, leafy plant and a window that looked out onto a small, brick-paved alley. He was not reading, as she had expected. He was simply staring into his half-full mug, his shoulders slightly slumped, lost in a private thought. In the soft, natural light of the coffee shop, away from the harsh fluorescence of the classroom, the sadness she had always sensed in him was even more pronounced. He seemed terribly alone. Then he looked up, as if sensing her presence, and his eyes met hers. A slow, genuine smile spread across his face, erasing the weariness for a moment. He stood, his worn tweed jacket seeming perfectly at home among the dark wood and old brick. \"Lucie,\" he said, his voice a low, warm welcome. \"I'm so glad you came.\"\n\nThe initial few minutes were a study in gentle awkwardness. They stood in line to get her a coffee, the mundane transaction a strange interruption to the intensity that had brought them there. They spoke of the weather, of the surprising quality of the coffee. But when they sat down at the small table, the small talk evaporated, leaving a silence that was both comfortable and freighted with anticipation. Alistair cradled his mug in both hands, his long fingers looking pale against the dark ceramic. \"I\u2019ve been thinking about your comment in class,\" he began, his voice low and serious. \"About the act of seeing. It\u2019s stayed with me.\" He looked at her, his gray eyes clear and direct. \"You said you\u2019d been writing things down.\" It was not an accusation, but a gentle prompt, an opening of a door.\n\nHer hand went instinctively to her bag. This was the moment. Her throat was dry, but she met his gaze. \"It's not poetry,\" she said, the words a familiar, protective mantra. \"I told you, it\u2019s just notes. About\u2026 work. About things I see.\" He simply nodded, his expression patient, understanding. He did not ask to see it. He waited. Taking a shaky breath, Lucie pulled the thin, cheap notebook from her bag and laid it on the polished wood of the table between them. It looked small and insignificant, a child\u2019s diary. \"It's probably silly,\" she whispered, a last-ditch effort to manage his expectations. \"No,\" he said softly, his eyes on the book. \"It\u2019s not. May I?\" She swallowed and nodded, pushing it the last few inches across the table.\n\nHe opened the notebook with a reverence that stunned her. He handled it not like a teacher correcting a student\u2019s homework, but like an archivist examining a rare and delicate manuscript. His eyes scanned the first page, then the second. Lucie held her breath, watching his face for any sign of judgment or disappointment. She watched him read her description of the pancake-sharing couple, the note about the Formica galaxy, the six lines she had scribbled about Sal in the alleyway. He read for a long time, the only sound the quiet murmur of the other patrons and the soft rustle of the page as he turned it. His expression was unreadable, a mask of deep, scholarly concentration. He was not skimming. He was reading. He was paying attention.\n\nFinally, he looked up. His gray eyes were bright with an emotion she couldn't name. It was not pity. It was not mere academic interest. It was a profound, startling recognition. \"Lucie,\" he said, his voice hushed with a kind of awe. \"This is it. This is the work. 'The cigarette smoke and his breath making the same ghost in the cold.' That's not a note. That's a line of real poetry. You're not just observing things; you're feeling them. You\u2019re finding the human truth inside the detail.\" He tapped a finger on the page where she had described the diner\u2019s coffee as a 'liquid grudge.' \"This,\" he said, \"is what most writers spend their entire lives trying to learn. How to tell the truth with a single, perfect image. You're already doing it. You just don't know it yet.\"Lucie\u2019s world, which for two years had been a small, contained universe of beige and grease, suddenly tilted on its axis and expanded into an infinite, terrifying blackness studded with distant, burning stars. The quiet murmur of the coffee shop, the clink of a spoon against ceramic, the soft instrumental music\u2014it all faded into a roaring silence. The only sound was the echo of his words in her head, a repeating, seismic shockwave. *That's a line of real poetry. You're already doing it.* The praise was not a gentle pat on the head; it was a detonation. It was a validation so absolute, so unexpected, that it felt like a physical blow, knocking the air from her lungs. She stared at him, her lips parted, unable to form a response. This was the moment of exposure she had feared, but instead of mockery, she had been met with a reverence that left her utterly stripped of her defenses. She was seen. Not the waitress, not the tired girl in the worn-out hoodie. The hidden, secret self she had barely dared to acknowledge had been called out into the light, and he had pronounced it real.\n\nAlistair seemed to sense her overload. He gently closed the notebook, the cover a plain, unassuming brown, and slid it back to the center of the table. His hand rested near it, not quite touching, as if respecting the boundary of a sacred object. He leaned back in his chair, giving her space to breathe, but his eyes never left hers. \u201cIt\u2019s a rare thing, you know,\u201d he continued, his voice softer now, coaxing her back from the shock. \u201cTo have that instinct. Most people, when they start to write, they try to sound like poets. They use big words, they describe sunsets and broken hearts. They write about what they think poetry is supposed to be about. But you\u2026 you wrote about the way a man holds a salt shaker. You wrote about the sound of a faulty faucet. You\u2019re starting with the truth. That\u2019s everything.\u201d He picked up his coffee mug, a grounding, normal motion that helped tether her back to the room. He took a slow sip, his gaze still holding hers over the rim.\n\nThe roaring in her ears subsided, replaced by the frantic thrum of her own heart. She had to say something, anything, to keep from dissolving completely. She couldn\u2019t talk about her own writing anymore; the subject was too raw, too bright. She needed to turn the lens away from herself. Her mind snagged on the one thread he had offered that led away from her and towards him. \u201cEleanor Vance,\u201d she said, her voice raspy. \u201cWhen I mentioned her name, in class\u2026 you looked sad.\u201d It was a bold, terribly intimate question, and as soon as the words were out, she felt a fresh wave of panic. She was overstepping, prying into the carefully guarded melancholy she had only ever observed from a distance. She was a trespasser in the quiet country of his sadness.\n\nHe didn't flinch. He didn\u2019t deflect or demur. He simply lowered his mug to the table with a soft click and looked down into its dark surface for a moment, as if the answer were floating there. The small smile he wore was gone, replaced by the familiar, profound weariness that seemed to be his natural state. \u201cShe was my thesis advisor in grad school,\u201d he said, his voice flat, stripped of its usual poetic cadence. \u201cA long time ago. She was\u2026 brilliant. Ferocious. She saw the world with a clarity that was terrifying. She could dissect a poem, or a person, in three sentences and leave you feeling utterly exposed and completely understood all at once.\u201d He paused, his gaze distant. \u201cShe taught me how to read. Not just books. Everything.\u201d\n\nHe looked up from his mug and met Lucie\u2019s eyes, and in their gray depths, she saw not just sadness, but a deep, abiding frustration. \u201cShe wrote one perfect, small book. *The Winged Life*. And then she spent the next twenty years trying to write another one. The university, the department heads\u2026 they all wanted another book. They wanted articles, conference papers, quantifiable output. They didn't care that she had already created a flawless thing. They just wanted more product. They put her in a cage of their own making\u2014the pressure, the deadlines, the petty academic politics. They took this woman who taught us all how to see, and they made her world smaller and smaller until she couldn\u2019t see anything at all.\u201d He stopped, his jaw tight. \u201cShe stopped writing. And then, a few years after I left, she stopped everything else, too.\u201d\n\nThe unspoken end of the story hung in the warm, coffee-scented air, a ghost at their table. The quiet tragedy of it settled over Lucie, a cold weight of understanding. This was the source of his weariness, the wellspring of his sadness. He had seen firsthand what happened when the world, with its blunt and stupid demands, was allowed to grind a poet down. His praise of her notebook, his command to *not stop*, was not just casual encouragement. It was a desperate, personal plea. He was trying to save her from a fate he had already witnessed. He was seeing a ghost in her, the ghost of a brilliant woman he had once known, and he was trying to rewrite the ending. The connection between them was suddenly deeper, darker, and more complex than she could ever have imagined.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d she whispered, the words utterly inadequate. He just shook his head, a quick, dismissive gesture, as if to ward off her sympathy. \u201cIt was a long time ago. But it taught me that cages come in many forms. Some are made of grease and sticky ketchup bottles. Others are made of tweed jackets and mahogany-paneled offices.\u201d He looked directly at her, and the intensity was back, a fire banked low. \u201cThe work\u2026 the *real* work of paying attention\u2026 is the only way to keep a piece of the sky for yourself. No matter what cage you\u2019re in. That notebook,\u201d he nodded toward it, \u201cis your piece of the sky. Don't ever let anyone take it from you. And don't ever trade it for a bigger cage they promise you is a palace.\u201d\n\nHe pushed the notebook the final inch across the table until her hand, resting on the wood, could feel the corner of it. It was a transfer of responsibility, a passing of a torch. She curled her fingers around it, the cheap cardboard cover feeling more precious than anything she had ever owned. The bell over the coffee shop door chimed, and a gust of cold air briefly disturbed the warm bubble of their conversation. The moment was shifting, drawing to a close. \u201cThank you,\u201d she said, her voice full of an emotion she couldn't name. \u201cFor\u2026 all of it. For seeing it.\u201d He gave her a small, tired smile, the warmth returning to his eyes. \u201cThank you for letting me see it, Lucie.\u201d They sat in a final, shared silence, the unspoken understanding between them a solid, palpable thing. Then he glanced at his watch and the spell was broken. \u201cI have papers to grade,\u201d he said with a sigh, the weary teacher returning. \u201cA life of quantifiable output.\u201d He stood, and Lucie stood with him. \"I'll see you Tuesday,\" he said. But it wasn't a question, and it wasn't just about class. It was a promise of continuation, a confirmation that this conversation was only the beginning. He gave her one last, long look, a look that said he was entrusting her with something vital, then turned and walked out of the shop, the bell chiming his departure. Lucie stood by the table for a moment, her hand pressed flat on the cover of her notebook, and felt the unmistakable, terrifying, and exhilarating sensation of her whole life beginning to change.Lucie didn\u2019t remember the walk home. It was as if she had been lifted out of the bright, cold reality of a Red Deer afternoon and deposited on the worn welcome mat of her own front door, the key already in her hand. The intervening blocks, the traffic, the passersby\u2014all of it had been a dreamscape she had floated through, insulated from the world by the force field of his words. The cheap canvas bag felt heavy, not with the weight of the book and her notebook, but with the gravitas of the responsibility he had placed in her hands. She stepped into her basement suite and the familiar scent of damp carpet and old plumbing didn't register as bleakness, but as the smell of her own private territory, her sanctuary. She walked directly to the wobbly table and carefully placed the notebook in the center, not tossing it aside as she usually would, but arranging it with the precision of a priest placing a holy text upon an altar. She looked at its plain cover, this ten-dollar book of paper that now contained the blueprint for a new life. *Don't ever trade it for a bigger cage they promise you is a palace.* It was the most profound advice she had ever received, a map and a warning all in one.\n\nThe next day was Sunday, the diner\u2019s busiest. It was a brutal onslaught of church crowds and hungover oil-patch workers, a cacophony of crying children, clattering plates, and Sal bellowing orders like a beleaguered sergeant in a losing battle. In the past, these shifts had been a kind of torture, a physical and spiritual beatdown that left her hollowed out and aching. But today, Lucie moved through the storm with a preternatural calm. She was the quiet eye of the hurricane. The chaos couldn't touch the still, silent core of her that was holding onto the memory of a quiet coffee shop and a conversation that had remade her world. She was no longer a victim of the noise; she was its archivist. She saw the forced piety of the after-church families, the men in their too-tight Sunday shirts, the women with their exhausted eyes, and she jotted a line on her order pad: *God feels far away on a Sunday morning in a vinyl booth.* She saw a young boy methodically drowning his French fries in a puddle of ketchup, creating a small, bloody tableau on his plate, and she felt not annoyance, but a flicker of recognition for his small, desperate act of creation. The world was a text, and she was finally learning how to read it.\n\nSal watched her from his fiery pulpit, his brow furrowed in suspicion. Her unflappable serenity was unnatural. She navigated the narrow, crowded aisles with an unhurried, almost balletic grace, her diner-smile replaced by a look of distant, focused concentration. She didn\u2019t snap back when table twelve complained their eggs were too runny, she simply nodded and took the plate, her calm more unnerving to the belligerent customer than any argument would have been. During a rare moment of quiet, as she was loading the industrial dishwasher, Sal came over, wiping his greasy hands on his apron. He leaned against the metal counter, his presence blocking her path. \"Alright, Moreau,\" he said, his voice low and gravelly. \"Spill it. You joined a cult? Find Jesus? That English class of yours teachin' you how to levitate?\" The questions were sarcastic, but underneath there was a genuine, almost worried curiosity. He was testing the bounds of her new reality, trying to find a familiar foothold. Lucie simply turned, her hands dripping with rinse water, and looked at him. \"Something like that, Sal,\" she said, her voice even and quiet. \"I guess you could say I'm learning a new language.\" He stared at her for a long moment, searching for the old Lucie in her calm, clear eyes and finding no trace. He grunted, a sound of defeat and confusion, and turned back to his grill. He didn't understand her secret, but he knew enough to recognize that it had taken her somewhere he could not follow.\n\nThe rest of the day, and all of Monday, she felt the weight and power of that secret in her pocket. She had started carrying a smaller, folded notebook and a pen in the pocket of her black work pants. During a break, or in a stolen two-minute lull, she would retreat to the alley behind the diner, the same place she had seen Sal have his moment of quiet despair. The air smelled of stale beer from the overflowing dumpsters and the cold, metallic tang of the prairie winter. There, leaning against the cold brick, she would write. It was no longer just about passive observation. It was a discipline. She wrestled with the words, trying to capture the exact, grimy poetry of her surroundings. She wrote about the fragile, greasy rainbows in the dishwater, the way the ancient jukebox sang of heartbreak to a roomful of people too tired to dance, the desperate optimism of the handwritten \u201cHELP WANTED\u201d sign taped to the front door. The work was hard, frustrating. Most of the lines she wrote felt clumsy and false, and she would strike them out with a vicious slash of her pen. But the effort itself was the point. She was building her ladder, rung by painful, hard-won rung. Each successful phrase, each line that felt true, was another small piece of the sky she was claiming for herself.\n\nTuesday couldn't come soon enough. The anticipation was a constant, low-grade fever. This was no longer about a student hoping for the teacher\u2019s approval. This was a conversation between two people who knew the terrible importance of the work. She didn't want to just impress him; she wanted to bring him an offering. An artifact from her world, translated. She arrived at the college early, her heart a frantic drum against her ribs. She took her seat and pulled out her new, smaller notebook, placing it on the desk beside the official class handouts. When Alistair walked in, his eyes immediately found hers, and then flickered down to the notebook on her desk. A small, almost imperceptible nod of acknowledgment passed between them. He had seen. He understood. The class began, the topic was Emily Dickinson. He read from one of her poems, his voice giving the strange, spiky verses their full, disquieting power. *\"I measure every Grief I meet / With narrow, probing, Eyes - / I wonder if It weighs like Mine - / Or has an Easier size.\"* He looked up from the page, his gaze sweeping the room before landing, inevitably, on her. \"What is she doing here?\" he asked the class, but the question was only for Lucie. \"Why this need to measure, to compare?\" The question hung in the air, a direct query into the work they had discussed on Saturday. He was asking her to explain their shared secret to a room full of strangers.The silence in the classroom was a living thing, thick with the blank incomprehension of the other students and the focused, patient weight of Alistair\u2019s question. Lucie felt their gazes, a dozen pinpricks of confusion and indifference, but they were a distant irritation, like static from a radio in another room. Her entire universe had contracted to the space between her desk and the lectern. She looked at Alistair, and saw not a teacher waiting for an answer, but a fellow cartographer asking her to describe a shared, secret map. She took a slow breath, the air tasting of chalk dust and old paper, and the words came, not from her intellect, but from a deeper place, the place where she had stored the images of the past week.\n\n\"She's not just comparing,\" Lucie said, her voice quiet but carrying in the stillness. \"She's trying to survive. When you\u2019re surrounded by grief, by a world that doesn\u2019t make sense, you start to feel like you\u2019re the only one. Like your sadness is a freakish, heavy thing that no one else could possibly understand.\" Her gaze flickered to Brenda from accounting, who was frowning at her pen as if it had personally offended her. \"But if you measure, if you look at the person next to you with those \u2018narrow, probing, Eyes,\u2019 you start to see it everywhere. You see it in the way a man holds his coffee cup when he thinks no one is watching. You see it in the slump of a cook\u2019s shoulders in an alleyway. You see it even in the people you don\u2019t like.\" She thought of Earl and his clumsy, pathetic loneliness. \"And when you see it, you realize your grief isn't a solitary confinement. It's a shared language. It might not make it lighter, but it gives it an \u2018Easier size.\u2019 It makes it something you can carry, because you know you\u2019re not carrying it alone.\"\n\nWhen she finished, the silence that followed was different. It was no longer empty; it was dense with the meaning of her words, even if only one other person in the room could fully decipher them. Gary snorted softly in his sleep in the back row. Brenda shook her head slightly, a gesture of complete bewilderment. But Alistair\u2026 Alistair simply stood there, his hands resting on the open book. He didn\u2019t offer praise. He didn\u2019t say, \"Thank you, Miss Moreau.\" He just held her gaze, and in his eyes was a look of such profound, startling kinship that it was more intimate than any touch. It was a look that said, *I know exactly the alleyway you mean. I have measured that grief myself.* After a long, suspended moment, he cleared his throat and continued the lesson, his voice a little rougher than before, but the connection between them remained, a brilliant, invisible thread woven through the dry fabric of the class.\n\nThe walk after class had become a silent, mutual assumption. They fell into step in the quiet hallway, the familiar rhythm of their footsteps the only sound between them. The night was sharp and cold, the stars hard and bright in the black sky. They walked without speaking for several blocks, the shared comfort of the silence a testament to how far they had come from their first, awkward encounter. The space between them was no longer filled with questions and uncertainties, but with a deep, resonant understanding. As they approached the corner where their paths diverged, the corner that had become a kind of informal landmark in Lucie\u2019s new life, she knew she had to do more than just talk. The conversation had to become tangible. Her heart began to beat a hard, frantic rhythm against her ribs.\n\n\"Wait,\" she said, her voice small in the vast, cold quiet. He stopped and turned to her, his breath a white plume in the streetlight\u2019s glow. Her hand trembled as she reached into the pocket of her coat, bypassing the bag with its larger, more intimidating notebook. She pulled out the small, folded pad she now carried with her everywhere. It was dog-eared and smudged with diner grease. \"I, uh\u2026 I wrote something,\" she stammered, feeling a fresh wave of paralyzing vulnerability. \"It\u2019s not for class. It\u2019s just\u2026 from the alley.\" With shaking fingers, she tore a single page from the spiral binding. The sound of the paper ripping was violently loud in the stillness. She held it out to him, a small, wrinkled offering. \"You said not to trade my piece of the sky,\" she whispered. \"This is a little piece of it. For Eleanor.\"\n\nHe looked from her face to the small, folded piece of paper she was holding out to him. He didn't move for a moment, as if he understood the immense weight of the gesture. Then, with infinite care, he reached out and took it from her, his fingers brushing hers. The brief touch was a jolt of warmth against the cold. He didn\u2019t put it in his pocket for later. He unfolded it right there, under the orange halo of the streetlight, and held it up to read. Lucie watched his eyes move across her cramped handwriting, her soul laid bare on a flimsy, grease-stained sheet. She had written down the lines about Sal. *Sal in the alley. The cigarette smoke and his breath making the same ghost in the cold. A whole life in one tired slump. He looks at the wall like it\u2019s a mirror he\u2019s afraid to look into.* Alistair read it once, and then again. He lowered the paper, his face a mask of quiet, profound emotion. He looked at her, and the sadness in his eyes was mingled with a fierce, burning light.\n\n\"This is not a little piece, Lucie,\" he said, his voice thick with feeling. \"This is the whole thing. The whole world. This is what she was trying to teach us.\" He carefully folded the page and slipped it into the inside pocket of his tweed jacket, placing it over his heart as if it were a precious photograph. \"This is the most valuable thing I have been given in a very long time.\" The sincerity of his words was absolute, a foundational truth that settled deep into Lucie\u2019s bones, reinforcing everything that had shifted within her. He stood there for a moment longer, looking at her as if she were a miracle he was struggling to comprehend. \"Don't stop,\" he said again, but this time it wasn't a command. It was a plea from one survivor to another. \"Whatever you do, don't you ever stop.\" He gave a final, sharp nod, a gesture of profound respect, and then he turned and walked away into the darkness, leaving Lucie standing alone on the corner, the cold air on her face a stark contrast to the brilliant, blazing warmth that was spreading through her entire being. She was not just a poet. She was a poet with a reader.The world did not dissolve into a blur on the walk home. On the contrary, for the first time, it snapped into hyper-focus. Lucie felt the biting cold on her cheeks not as an assault, but as a clarifying sensation, a sharp reminder that she was alive and present in this one, specific moment. The sodium streetlights didn't cast a sickly orange glow; they were beacons, each one illuminating a small stage on which the quiet dramas of the night unfolded. She saw the frost creeping in intricate, feathery patterns across a parked car's windshield and recognized it as a form of writing. She heard the low hum of a city settling into sleep and understood it as a kind of hushed, collective breathing. She was no longer just an observer; she felt like a collaborator, a part of the world\u2019s quiet, constant poetry. He had taken her small, smudged piece of paper and placed it over his heart. The gesture was a coronation. In the kingdom of one, in the quiet republic of his esteem, she was not just a poet. She was a poet whose work was valued, cherished, and protected.\n\nWhen she reached her basement suite, the space felt different. The familiar dampness in the air was the cool atmosphere of a grotto, a secret, subterranean place for creation. The single high window, usually a sad reminder of her submerged existence, now seemed like a strategic vantage point, a periscope through which she could observe the world above. She didn't turn on the television or even her small lamp. She sat in the darkness, the faint light from the street filtering in, and let the feeling of the night settle into her. He had called her offering \"the whole world.\" He had held it as if it were precious. He had connected it to Eleanor. He had made her part of a lineage, a secret society of people who paid attention. The weight of this new identity was immense, but it was not a burden. It was ballast, giving her a new and profound sense of gravity, of purpose. She was no longer just Lucie Moreau, a waitress drifting through life. She was the person who wrote the poem that was now folded in Alistair Finch's pocket.\n\nThe next few days at the Gopher Hole were an exercise in dual existence. On the surface, she was the same efficient waitress, moving with an economy of motion, refilling coffees, and calling out orders. But underneath, a revolution was taking place. She felt an almost tender pity for the world around her, for the blunt, unexamined lives that played out in the vinyl booths. She saw Earl come in and order his trucker\u2019s special, and instead of steeling herself for his inevitable leering, she watched the way his hands, thick and clumsy, fumbled with the small packets of sugar, and she felt a wave of crushing sadness for his inability to connect in any way that was not a trespass. The anger she had once felt was gone, replaced by the cold, clear insight of a diagnosis. Her notebook entries changed. She was no longer just capturing images; she was trying to understand the mechanics of the cage. She wrote about the desperate cheerfulness of the jukebox, the way it played songs of love and freedom into a room thick with exhaustion and quiet resignation. She wrote about the thinness of the walls, both literal and metaphorical, between the lives crammed into the diner.\n\nHer calm was a strange, unreadable force in the diner\u2019s ecosystem. Customers who tried to bully her found their anger deflating against the soft, unyielding surface of her serenity. Sal continued to watch her, his suspicion morphing into a kind of grudging respect. He saw that whatever secret she was holding was making her better at her job\u2014more focused, more resilient, untouchable. He stopped his probing questions and instead would occasionally leave a perfectly cooked steak on the pass for her at the end of a long shift, a gesture he would never acknowledge, his own gruff, unspoken form of measurement. He didn't know what her grief was, or her joy, but he could see that it had a weight and a size, and he had decided it was something to be respected.\n\nThe anticipation for their next meeting was a quiet, steady flame. It was no longer fraught with the anxiety of seeking approval. Now, it felt like a necessary communion, a return to her home country. On Tuesday, she walked into the classroom feeling not like a student, but like an equal. She took her seat, her heart beating a calm, steady rhythm. When Alistair entered, his eyes found hers instantly, a silent acknowledgment that passed between them like a warm current. He looked subtly different. The deep lines of weariness around his eyes seemed a fraction softer, the slump in his shoulders a little less pronounced. It was as if the small piece of her sky she had given him had let a little light into his own world. He began the class, the topic for the night a selection of modern love poems. As he read a particularly raw and honest piece by a contemporary poet, Lucie felt the words not as an academic exercise, but as a continuation of the conversation she and Alistair were having with the world, and with each other.\n\nThe walk after class was steeped in a new, comfortable intimacy. The silence between them was no longer a space to be filled, but a shared territory they inhabited together. As they walked through the cold, quiet streets, he finally spoke, his voice low and thoughtful. \u201cI\u2019ve read your poem a hundred times,\u201d he said, not looking at her, but staring ahead at the dark ribbon of the street. \u201cIt\u2019s sitting on my desk. It makes the stacks of ungraded essays seem\u2026 less significant.\u201d He glanced at her, a quick, almost shy look. \u201cIt reminds me what the point of all this is. The point of the words.\u201d He paused as they reached their corner, the familiar streetlight casting its amber glow. \u201cI was wondering, Lucie. What do you want? Beyond the Gopher Hole. When you think of the future, what do you see?\u201d\n\nThe question was direct, practical, and terrifying. It demanded that she look beyond the next shift, the next paycheck, the next class. It assumed she had a future to envision. Her mind, for so long focused only on the granular details of the present, went blank. She thought of her holding pattern, of the purgatory of ketchup bottles, and for the first time, she truly believed it was a temporary state. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she confessed, her voice barely a whisper. \u201cA year ago, I wouldn\u2019t have even known how to answer that. I just thought\u2026 this was it.\u201d She looked up at him, her face earnest in the dim light. \u201cNow, I just know that I want to keep doing this. The writing. I want to get better at it. I want to build the ladder, like you said.\u201d\n\nAlistair nodded, a slow, thoughtful gesture. He seemed to be weighing his next words with immense care. \"Getting better requires two things,\" he said. \"Practice, which you are doing with a ferocious honesty that reminds me very much of Eleanor. And it requires community. It requires being in conversation with other people who are doing the same work.\" He reached into his briefcase and pulled out a thin, folded flyer. \"There\u2019s a small literary festival in Edmonton next month. A Saturday. It\u2019s not a big, fancy affair. It\u2019s just writers and readers, crammed into a few rooms at the university. There are readings, panel discussions. A lot of bad coffee.\u201d He offered the flyer to her. \u201cI\u2019m driving up for the day. I have an extra seat in my car. I thought\u2026 if you were interested\u2026 you could see what that world looks like. You could listen. You could measure.\u201d\n\nLucie took the flyer, her fingers numb with cold and shock. An entire day. A trip out of Red Deer. A festival of writers. It was an invitation not just into his car, but into his world. It was a door swinging open, revealing a room she had never known existed, a room she was now being personally invited to enter. It was the next, unimaginable rung on the ladder, and he was holding it steady for her. \u201cYes,\u201d she breathed, the word a plume of white in the frozen air, absolute and immediate. \u201cYes, I would be very interested.\u201d A broad, unguarded smile broke across his face, a smile of pure, unadulterated delight. It was the first time she had ever seen him look truly happy. \u201cGood,\u201d he said, the single word brimming with promise. \u201cIt\u2019s a long drive. We\u2019ll have time to talk.\u201dThe weeks leading up to the literary festival were a fever dream of anticipation. The trip to Edmonton became a fixed point in Lucie\u2019s future, a brilliant, blazing sun around which the dull planets of her workdays revolved. Time, which had once been a thick, slow-moving river of grease, now had a current, a direction. Every shift she worked was one less shift standing between her and that Saturday. The Gopher Hole, with its endless, grinding demands, became a training ground. She was an athlete preparing for a marathon, and every plate she carried, every coffee she poured, was strengthening her for the long journey ahead. She felt a strange, detached fondness for the place. It was her subject, her muse, the source of the raw material she was learning to transmute. She was no longer drowning in it; she was mining it for gold.\n\nHer notebook became her most treasured and most terrifying possession. She filled its pages with a frantic energy, a desperate need to have something to show, to prove that she was worthy of the seat in his car. She wrote about the way the winter sun, low and weak, would strike the chrome napkin dispensers, creating a brief, blinding flash of painful beauty. She wrote about the vocabulary of sighs she heard from the lonely men at the counter, each one a different dialect of despair. But as the day of the festival approached, a paralyzing self-doubt began to creep in. She would read her lines and the raw honesty she had been so proud of would curdle into what she feared was sentimental foolishness. Who was she to be riding in a car with Alistair Finch, to be walking into a festival of real writers? She was a waitress who smelled of onions, with chapped hands and a high school diploma. The black sweater she had worn to their meetings, her one good thing, now seemed hopelessly inadequate, a pathetic costume that would instantly betray her as an imposter.\n\nThe night before the trip, she didn\u2019t sleep. She sat on the edge of her lumpy futon in the dark, the Eleanor Vance book open but unread on her lap. The fear was a cold, heavy knot in her stomach. It would be so easy to call in sick to this new life, to retreat to the grim, predictable comfort of the Gopher Hole. But then she remembered the look on Alistair\u2019s face when he had taken her small, grease-stained poem. He had seen something real. He had seen not an imposter, but a peer. The memory was an anchor in the swirling sea of her anxiety. She was not going to this festival to prove she was a writer. She was going because he already believed she was one. The thought did not banish the fear, but it gave her the courage to face it. She stood up, turned on the light, and with a steady hand, packed her canvas bag, placing her notebook inside with the care of someone packing their only valid passport.\n\nShe was waiting on the curb in the pre-dawn darkness when the headlights of his car cut through the gloom, illuminating the street of identical, sleeping bungalows. The car was an older, dark green sedan, sensible and unassuming, much like the man himself. He pulled up and leaned over to push open the passenger door for her, the small gesture of courtesy feeling incredibly gallant in the cold, dark morning. The interior of the car was a revelation. It was tidy, but lived-in, and it smelled exactly as she knew it would: a rich, comforting blend of old paper, leather from the worn seats, and the faint, clean scent of winter that clung to him like a second skin. A small, precarious stack of books was wedged between the back seat and the door. \"Morning, Lucie,\" he said, his voice a low, warm rumble in the quiet of the car. He was wearing a dark grey woolen coat over a simple sweater, his tweed jacket left behind. He looked less like a professor and more like a man on a journey, and the sight of him, so calm and solid in the driver's seat, settled the frantic fluttering in her chest.\n\nAs they drove out of Red Deer, leaving the familiar, sleeping city behind, a comfortable silence settled between them. The prairie landscape unfolded around them, a vast, monochromatic expanse of snow-covered fields under a sky that was slowly bruising from black to a deep, pearlescent purple. The rhythmic thump of the tires on the highway was a peaceful, meditative sound. After a time, he broke the silence, his question gentle. \"Are you nervous?\" Lucie looked at her own hands, clasped tightly in her lap. \"Terrified,\" she admitted, the confession a relief. He nodded, his eyes on the road. \"Good,\" he said, and she looked at him in surprise. \"It means you understand what's at stake. The day you walk into a room full of poets and you're not at least a little bit terrified is the day you've lost the plot.\" He glanced at her, a small, reassuring smile on his lips. \"The secret is that they are all just as terrified as you are. They're just better at hiding it.\"\n\nThe long drive unspooled before them, and with it, the conversation. They moved beyond the safe territory of poetry and into the uncharted landscape of their own lives. He asked her about her family, and for the first time, she spoke of it plainly, without shame or bitterness. She told him about her well-meaning parents who wanted her to have a sensible, secure life as a dental hygienist, about their complete inability to understand the hungry, restless part of her that felt starved by the idea of such a safe, small existence. She spoke of the string of dead-end jobs and a failed relationship, not as a list of failures, but as the geography of the holding pattern she was finally escaping. He listened with that same profound, quiet attention he brought to a poem, his occasional, insightful questions making her feel not judged, but deeply and completely heard.\n\nHe, in turn, offered small, carefully chosen pieces of his own story. He spoke of growing up in a small town in the Maritimes, a bookish, quiet boy who felt perpetually out of sync with the world around him. He talked about his own escape, first to university, and then into the rarefied, often suffocating world of academia. He never mentioned Eleanor Vance by name again, but Lucie could hear her ghost in the way he spoke of his early, passionate belief in the power of literature, and the slow, grinding disillusionment that had followed. He was not just the sad, tired professor anymore. He was Alistair, a man who had fought his own battles and bore his own scars, a man who had almost forgotten what the point of it all was until a waitress in his night class had reminded him by talking about a Grecian urn. The car became a confessional, a sanctuary moving at one hundred kilometers an hour, and with every mile they traveled, the distance between their two disparate worlds shrank until it was barely there at all.\n\nAs they approached the outskirts of Edmonton, the flat, empty prairie gave way to the sprawling geometry of the city. Buildings rose up to meet the sky, a vertical landscape that was a stark contrast to the horizontal world Lucie knew. The sheer scale of it, the endless streams of cars, the anonymous rush of people, was both exhilarating and overwhelming. Alistair navigated the unfamiliar streets with a quiet confidence, his hands resting easily on the wheel. \"We're almost there,\" he said, sensing her quiet awe. \"The university is like a city within the city. You'll see.\" He drove them onto a sprawling campus of old stone buildings and modern glass structures, a place that hummed with a purpose and energy that was entirely foreign to her. He found a parking spot in a crowded lot, the other cars seeming to disgorge people who all looked exactly as he had described: bundled in scarves, clutching tote bags filled with books, their faces alight with conversation and purpose. They were a tribe, and she was an outsider. He turned off the engine, and the sudden silence in the car was immense.\n\nHe turned to her, his expression serious, his gray eyes searching hers. \"Ready?\" he asked. The terror she had felt earlier returned with a vengeance, a cold wave that threatened to drown her. This was it. The moment of truth. She was about to step out of the safety of his car and into a world where she did not belong, where her notebook and her chapped hands would surely betray her. She could only manage a small, jerky nod. He seemed to understand completely. He reached over, not to touch her, but just to tap a finger lightly on the canvas of her bag, where her notebook rested. \"Just remember,\" he said, his voice a low, steady anchor. \"You have as much right to be here as any of them. You're doing the work. Now, let's go listen.\"Lucie\u2019s hand was on the door handle, but for a long, frozen moment, she couldn\u2019t bring herself to move. The interior of the car was a known world, a bubble of quiet understanding that smelled of paper and him. Outside was the vast, unknowable territory of the festival, populated by the very people she was trying to become and whose judgment she feared most. It was one thing to be a poet in the secret workshop of her basement suite, or in the rarefied audience of one that was Alistair. It was another thing entirely to step out into the cold, bright light and risk being seen by the professionals. Taking a deep, shaky breath that did little to calm the frantic hummingbird of her heart, she pushed the door open. The air that rushed in was frigid and sharp, a slap of reality. She stepped out onto the gritty, snow-dusted asphalt, the solid ground feeling precarious beneath her feet, and shut the door behind her, the sound a final, definitive click. The sanctuary was gone.\n\nThey walked together across the sprawling parking lot towards a large, imposing building of old grey stone, its arched windows looking down like thoughtful, ancient eyes. The people flowing around them all seemed to move with a similar purpose, their heads bent together in intense conversation, their laughter sharp and intelligent on the cold air. Lucie clutched the strap of her canvas bag, the corner of her notebook a hard, reassuring pressure against her hip. She felt utterly transparent, convinced that everyone could see the Gopher Hole clinging to her like a second skin, that her worn boots and plain black sweater marked her as a tourist in a land of natives. Alistair walked beside her, his long, easy strides a stark contrast to her own stiff, nervous steps. He seemed entirely unperturbed by the bustling scene, navigating it with the quiet confidence of a man returning to his home country after a long time away. He glanced at her, sensing her tension, and gave a slight, almost imperceptible nod towards a group of people laughing loudly near the entrance. \u201cPoets,\u201d he murmured, his voice laced with a dry amusement. \u201cThey\u2019re a dramatic bunch. Try not to let them intimidate you. Their bark is almost always worse than their bite.\u201d\n\nThe entrance hall was a warm, overwhelming cacophony of sound and motion. The air was thick with the competing smells of brewing coffee, damp wool, and the dry, papery scent of thousands of books. People were everywhere\u2014milling around tables piled high with literary journals and slender volumes of poetry, clustering in tight, animated groups, checking their programs with furrowed brows. It was a hive, and Lucie felt like a clumsy, bewildered bee from a different colony. Alistair guided her through the throng with a gentle hand on the small of her back, a brief, grounding touch that kept her from being swept away by the current of bodies. They made their way to a large board where the day's schedule was posted. His long finger traced down the list of events. \u201cThere\u2019s a reading in Room 204 that might be a good place to start,\u201d he said. \u201cA new voice. Supposedly very\u2026 deconstructionist.\u201d He said the last word with an inflection that made it clear he was not endorsing it. \u201cLet\u2019s go be deconstructed.\u201d\n\nThey found the room, slipping into two seats near the back just as the reading was beginning. The room was stuffy and overheated, packed with people leaning forward in their chairs with expressions of intense concentration. The poet on stage was a young man with a severe haircut and black-rimmed glasses, who read from a tablet in a flat, affected monotone. His poems were a dense thicket of academic theory and fragmented, disjointed images. They were clever, Lucie could sense that, but they were also cold and airless, with no blood or heart in them. She listened, her brow furrowed, trying to find a way in, a single image she could hold onto, but the words skittered off the surface of her understanding, leaving no trace. A familiar, sinking feeling began to set in. This was it. This was the secret language, the high intellectual art form she could never hope to master. This was real poetry, and her own small, simple observations about coffee cups and tired cooks were the pathetic scribbles of a child.\n\nAs the young man finished a particularly obtuse poem about the semiotics of a barcode, Alistair leaned towards her, his voice a barely audible whisper against her ear. \u201cHe\u2019s terrified of being understood,\u201d he murmured. \u201cHe thinks if people understand him, they\u2019ll realize he has nothing to say.\u201d The comment was a lifeline thrown to her in the middle of a vast, confusing sea. It wasn\u2019t that she was too simple to understand the poem; it was that the poem itself was a fortress, designed to keep people out. The realization was a quiet, thrilling revelation. She had a right to her own judgment. She had a right to expect a poem to offer a human connection, not a puzzle box with no key. When the reading ended to a smattering of polite, intellectual applause, she felt not defeated, but strangely validated, as if she had passed a secret test. She and Alistair shared a quick, conspiratorial glance, a silent agreement that was more meaningful than any of the applause in the room.\n\nThey emerged back into the crowded hallway, the brief respite of the reading room over. The energy of the crowd seemed to have intensified. As they navigated their way towards the main hall, a woman with a sleek, architectural haircut and a brightly colored scarf materialized in front of them. \u201cAlistair Finch, you hermit! I thought you\u2019d fallen off the face of the earth,\u201d she said, her voice loud and theatrical. Alistair\u2019s polite smile seemed to tighten at the edges. \u201cHello, Catherine,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve just been busy.\u201d Catherine\u2019s sharp, intelligent eyes flicked from Alistair to Lucie, taking in her plain sweater and nervous posture in a single, swift, and dismissive glance. \u201cAnd you are?\u201d she asked, the question less an inquiry and more a demand for Lucie to justify her presence at Alistair\u2019s side. The moment stretched, and Lucie\u2019s blood ran cold. This was it. He would say \u2018my student,\u2019 or \u2018a friend,\u2019 and she would be neatly categorized and put aside. But Alistair didn\u2019t hesitate. He met Catherine\u2019s gaze directly, his expression unreadable. \u201cThis is Lucie Moreau,\u201d he said, his voice clear and steady. \u201cShe\u2019s a writer from Red Deer.\u201d\n\nThe words hit Lucie with the force of a physical impact. *A writer.* He had said it. He had spoken the secret name she barely dared to whisper to herself, spoken it aloud in this temple of literature, to this high priestess of the tribe. The world seemed to tilt and then resettle on a new, more solid foundation. For a breathless moment, she was no longer a waitress playing dress-up. She was Lucie Moreau, a writer from Red Deer. The title, bestowed by him, felt like a cloak of legitimacy, an armor against the judging eyes of the world. Catherine\u2019s perfectly plucked eyebrows rose a fraction of an inch, her gaze flickering back to Lucie with a renewed, if still skeptical, interest. \u201cOh?\u201d she said, the single syllable dripping with a world of meaning. \u201cHow fascinating.\u201d She clearly didn\u2019t believe it, but the claim had been made, the territory marked. She turned her attention back to Alistair, launching into a stream of literary gossip, but Lucie was no longer listening. She was standing slightly outside their circle, invisible again, but it didn't matter. Inside, where no one could see, she was glowing.\n\nAfter they had extricated themselves from Catherine, Alistair guided them to another reading. The atmosphere in this second room was entirely different. It was smaller, less crowded, and filled with a quiet, respectful attention. The reader was an older woman with a kind, deeply lined face and a quiet, unassuming presence. She wore a simple dress and comfortable-looking shoes, and when she began to read, her voice was low and clear, without a trace of artifice. Her poems were about her garden, about the memory of her mother\u2019s hands, about the particular quality of light in a hospital room, about the surprising weight of a small, sleeping bird that had flown into her house. They were poems built of the same raw material Lucie was mining from her own life: the profound, heartbreaking beauty hidden in the ordinary. Every word was a revelation, a confirmation. This was the work. This was the truth. It was the language of Eleanor Vance, and it was the language Lucie was trying to learn. As the woman read a poem about finding a single, perfect seashell in the pocket of a dead man\u2019s coat, Lucie felt an ache of recognition so deep it was almost painful. Her hand, of its own accord, slipped into her bag and found the hard spine of her notebook, her fingers tracing the familiar edges. She looked over at Alistair. He was already watching her, a soft, knowing smile on his face, his grey eyes full of a shared, quiet joy. He had brought her here not to be deconstructed, but to be found. He had brought her home.The applause that followed the older woman\u2019s final poem was nothing like the polite, intellectual spattering that had followed the first reading. It was a warm, rolling wave of genuine appreciation, a collective exhalation of a room full of people who had been held, rapt, by the quiet power of her words. Lucie found herself clapping until her palms stung, a hot, grateful sting. She felt tears pricking at the corners of her eyes, a startling overflow of emotion she hadn't anticipated. It was the feeling of profound recognition, of having a deep, unarticulated part of herself spoken back to her in a language she was only just learning she knew. She wasn\u2019t being deconstructed; she was being reassembled, put together in a way that felt truer and more solid than before. She felt a deep, fierce kinship with the quiet woman on the stage, a woman who had taken the small, domestic sorrows and joys of a life and held them up to the light until they became universal, until they became art. This, Lucie knew with a certainty that settled deep in her bones, was the work. This was the sky.\n\nWhen they shuffled out of the room and back into the bustling hallway, the noise of the festival seemed less chaotic. It was just the sound of a thousand different conversations about the thing that mattered most. Alistair was quiet for a long moment, a contemplative look on his face. \u201cMarion Croft,\u201d he said, his voice soft with a kind of reverence. \u201cShe\u2019s the real thing. No fortress, no affectation. Just a direct line to the human heart.\u201d He looked at Lucie, and his gray eyes were bright with the shared understanding. \u201cThat\u2019s a lesson that takes most people a lifetime to learn. Some never do.\u201d His words felt like a quiet consecration of the moment they had just shared. He had brought her here to see this, to know that her own instincts, her own leanings toward the simple, resonant truth of the everyday, were not a sign of naivety, but the very essence of the craft. She was not on the wrong path; she was, impossibly, already on the right one.\n\nHe suggested they wander through the bookfair, a sprawling affair set up in the university's grand central hall. The sheer volume of books was intoxicating, a physical manifestation of the world of words she had only ever glimpsed. Tables were piled high with books of every shape and size, their covers a riot of color and design, their titles whispering promises of other worlds, other lives. The air smelled thick and rich with paper and ink. Alistair watched her as she drifted from table to table, her fingers trailing reverently over the spines, her eyes wide with a hungry, unjaded wonder. He saw her pick up a slim volume, open it, and become so lost in a single page that the noisy room around her seemed to fade away. For him, a man who had grown weary of this world, who had seen its vanities and its pettiness up close, watching Lucie discover it for the first time was like drinking cool, clean water after years of thirst. He was not just her guide; she was his, reminding him of the magic he had long ago begun to take for granted.\n\nAs they rounded a corner, Lucie\u2019s heart gave a sudden, sharp jolt. There, sitting at a small, unassuming table with a modest stack of her books, was Marion Croft. She was signing a book for a young woman, her head bent, her kind, lined face softened by a gentle smile. There was no theatricality about her, no air of importance. She looked like someone\u2019s grandmother, a woman you might sit next to on a bus, and yet she held entire worlds in her head. Alistair followed Lucie\u2019s gaze and understood at once. \"You should get one,\" he said, his voice a gentle nudge. \"You should have her sign it for you.\" The terror was immediate and paralyzing. The idea of approaching this woman, of speaking to her, felt like an impossible transgression. \"I can't,\" Lucie whispered, her throat closing up. \"What would I even say?\" Alistair looked at her, his expression patient and kind. \"You don't have to say anything profound,\" he said. \"You're a writer. Go meet another writer. Buy her book. It's how we keep each other going.\"\n\nPropelled by his words and a surge of desperate courage, Lucie found herself moving forward, her legs feeling unsteady beneath her. She joined the short, quiet line, her heart hammering a frantic rhythm against her ribs. She picked up a copy of the book, the same one Marion Croft had been reading from, its cover a simple illustration of a bird in flight. The paper felt cool and vital in her trembling hands. When it was her turn, she stepped forward and placed the book on the table, unable to meet the older woman\u2019s eyes. \"Did you enjoy the reading, dear?\" Marion Croft asked, her voice as warm and clear as it had been on stage. Lucie could only manage a choked nod, her gaze fixed on the woman\u2019s hands, the skin wrinkled and dotted with age spots, hands that had gardened and cooked and written these poems that had cracked her own heart open. \"And who should I make it out to?\" the poet asked. Lucie finally looked up, meeting the woman's clear, intelligent eyes. \"To Lucie,\" she whispered. Marion Croft smiled, a genuine, crinkling smile that reached her eyes, and in a steady, elegant script, she wrote, *For Lucie, May you always find the birds.* She slid the book back across the table. \"Thank you for listening so closely,\" she said, as if she had seen Lucie in the back row, had felt the intensity of her attention. Stunned into silence, Lucie clutched the book to her chest like a holy relic and retreated, her mind reeling.\n\nThe drive home was a descent from the stratosphere. The sun was setting, slanting low across the snow-covered fields and painting the vast prairie sky in impossible shades of rose and gold and violet. The car was filled with a quiet, contemplative peace. The frenzy of the festival was behind them, and now there was only the steady hum of the engine and the immense, beautiful emptiness of the landscape. They didn't speak for a long time, each lost in the day's reverberations. Lucie held the signed book in her lap, her thumb stroking the embossed title. *May you always find the birds.* It wasn\u2019t a platitude; it was a blessing, a passing of the torch. It was permission. Finally, Alistair spoke, his voice thoughtful. \u201cIt\u2019s a strange thing,\u201d he said. \u201cYou spend so much time in that world, you start to forget that a voice like Marion Croft\u2019s is the exception, not the rule. You get bogged down in the politics and the posturing, the Catherines of the world. You forget that the whole point is to just tell the truth as beautifully as you can.\u201d He glanced over at her, his profile outlined against the dying light. \u201cThank you for reminding me of that today, Lucie.\u201d\n\nHis gratitude was a disarming, humbling thing. It cemented the shift that had been happening between them all day, leveling the ground until there was no longer a teacher and a student, but two travelers who had found each other on the same road. \"What happens now?\" she asked, the question not about the next class, but about the rest of her life. The future, which had once been a terrifying blank, now seemed like a landscape of possibility, and she needed a map. \"Now,\" he said, \"you keep doing the work. You fill that notebook, and then you fill another one. And when you have a handful of poems that feel true, that feel like they can stand on their own, you send them out.\" He said it so simply, as if it were the most natural thing in the world. \"There are journals, the kind you saw today. Little magazines that are hungry for real voices. I can make you a list.\" He was giving her a practical, concrete plan, a set of instructions for building her own wings. The idea of sending her work out, of having it judged by faceless editors, was terrifying, but it was no longer impossible.\n\nBy the time they reached the familiar streets of Red Deer, the sky was a deep, star-dusted indigo. The city seemed smaller, quieter, a town she was returning to from a foreign country. When he pulled up in front of her bungalow, he didn't just push the door open. He turned off the engine, plunging them into a final, intimate silence. \u201cLucie,\u201d he said, turning to face her in the darkness, \u201ctoday was important. Not just for you. For me, too.\u201d In the dim light from the dashboard, she could see the earnestness in his face, the profound sincerity in his tired gray eyes. The professional distance was gone, replaced by a raw, human connection that was more powerful than anything she had ever known. \"Thank you for letting me see the world through your eyes today,\" he said. \"It was a gift.\" Unable to speak past the lump in her throat, she simply nodded, her heart full to bursting. She gathered her bag, her hand closing around the precious, signed book, and stepped out of the car. He waited until she had unlocked her door and was safely inside before starting the engine and driving away, his headlights sweeping across her window and then disappearing into the night.\n\nLucie stood in the middle of her small, dark room, the silence ringing in her ears. She could still feel the hum of the car, still smell the faint scent of old paper and coffee. She walked to her table and switched on the single lamp, its yellow light filling the room. With deliberate care, she placed Marion Croft's book on the table. Then she took out her own grease-stained, dog-eared notebook and placed it right beside it. They didn't look like they belonged to two different worlds. They looked like they were part of the same story, a beginning and a continuation. The inscription echoed in her mind: *May you always find the birds.* The hiss of the grill, the clatter of plates, the loneliness of the vinyl booths\u2014they were not a cage. They were a landscape. And it was teeming with birds. She opened her notebook to the next blank page, uncapped her pen, and with a hand that did not tremble, she began to write.The Monday morning after the festival was a brutal reentry. The alarm clock shrieked, dragging Lucie up from a deep, dreamless sleep and back into the cold, dim reality of her basement suite. For a disorienting moment, the lingering scent of old paper from Alistair\u2019s car seemed to hang in the air, a ghost of a better world. Then the familiar dampness of her own apartment asserted itself, and the thirteen-hour double shift loomed, a mountain of Sisyphean drudgery. But as she pulled on her uniform, the familiar black pants and faded pink polo, she felt a profound and irreversible shift. The uniform was no longer her skin; it was a costume. The Gopher Hole was no longer her life; it was a temporary research post, a place she was studying before moving on to her real work. The knowledge was a secret, joyful rebellion. She was a spy, gathering intelligence from deep within enemy territory, and her tour of duty had an end date, even if she didn\u2019t know it yet.\n\nThis new perspective changed her relationship to the diner\u2019s daily grind. It was no longer a cage to be endured, but a puzzle to be solved, a text to be deciphered. The frantic energy of the lunch rush, once a source of overwhelming stress, now seemed like a complex, chaotic ballet. She saw the intricate patterns in the chaos: the way customers unconsciously mirrored each other\u2019s gestures, the way Sal\u2019s movements at the grill were a masterclass in brutal efficiency, a dance of spatula and steel honed over thousands of hours. She found herself smiling at the absurdity of it all, a quiet, knowing smile that had nothing to do with earning a tip. Her calm was so absolute, so otherworldly, that it began to warp the reality around her. Earl came in, took his usual seat, but when he tried to catch her eye with his customary leer, he found her gaze so clear, so distant and compassionately analytical, that he faltered, looking away first and mumbling his order at the menu. She had ceased to be a participant in his small, grubby drama; she was now its audience, and the knowledge seemed to rob him of his power.\n\nTuesday night arrived, and with it, a new kind of anticipation. The walk to the college felt different, less like a pilgrimage to an oracle and more like a meeting with a collaborator. When she walked into the classroom, their eyes met with the familiar, silent acknowledgment, but this time it was underscored with the shared memory of an entire day, of a long car ride and a hundred small confidences. The class itself felt almost like a formality, the public part of a conversation that had become deeply private. Alistair taught with his usual quiet passion, but Lucie could feel his awareness of her in the room, could sense the way he would occasionally phrase a question that seemed aimed directly at her, a continuation of their dialogue disguised as a lesson for the others. She participated more freely now, her voice steady, her insights sharp, unburdened by the fear of being wrong. She wasn't guessing anymore; she was speaking from a place of growing certainty. Brenda from accounting had given up her confused glares and now simply ignored Lucie with a focused, almost hostile intensity, as if her very presence in the room was a personal affront.\n\nThe walk after class was steeped in purpose. The cold air was sharp and clean, a welcome antidote to the stuffy classroom. They fell into their familiar rhythm, their footsteps echoing in the quiet streets, but the silence was not empty. It was filled with the things that now existed between them: the literary festival, Marion Croft\u2019s blessing, his quiet confession about Eleanor. As they reached the corner that had become their unofficial meeting point, Alistair stopped and pulled a folded piece of paper from the inside pocket of his coat. It was not the poem she had given him; it was a crisp, white sheet, neatly typed. \u201cThe list,\u201d he said simply, holding it out to her. \u201cIt\u2019s a start. A few of the better Canadian journals that are known for being open to new voices. I\u2019ve marked the ones I think might be a particularly good fit for your work.\u201d\n\nLucie took the paper, her fingers trembling slightly. The list was an artifact from another universe. The names of the journals were poetry in themselves: *The Fiddlehead*, *Grain*, *The Malahat Review*, *Prairie Fire*. They sounded earthy and old, like names of constellations or wildflowers. Beside a few of them, Alistair had made small, spidery notes in his elegant script. Next to a journal called *Event*, he had written, *Honest, muscular prose poetry. They would understand Sal.* Next to another, *Contemporary Verse 2*, he\u2019d noted, *Likes the sharp, resonant image. The rainbow shrapnel.* He had remembered her lines. He had not only read her work, he had studied it, analyzed it, and was now providing her with a strategic map for its deployment into the world. The care and thought behind the gesture, the profound respect it implied, was overwhelming. She looked up at him, the typed page clutched in her hand. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to thank you,\u201d she whispered. He just smiled, a small, tired, but deeply kind smile. \u201cYou thank me by using it,\u201d he said. \u201cYou thank me by being brave.\u201d\n\nThe bravery he spoke of proved to be a far more complicated thing than she had imagined. Back in her suite, the list spread on her table like a sacred text, a new and more sophisticated terror took hold. It was the paralysis of choice. Her notebook, once a private sanctuary, now felt like a portfolio to be judged. She read through her entries with a cold, critical eye, and the lines that had once felt true and sharp now seemed amateurish and clumsy. The act of choosing which poems to send felt like a betrayal of the others, and the idea of typing them up, of formatting them according to submission guidelines she would have to look up, felt like forcing a wild, living thing into a sterile laboratory jar. For two days, she was frozen, unable to write anything new and unable to choose from the old. The fear of rejection was no longer an abstract concept; it had a dozen names on a list, a dozen post office boxes waiting to receive and dismiss her heart. The freedom Alistair had given her had revealed itself as a new, more terrifying kind of cage: the cage of her own ambition and self-doubt.\n\nShe finally broke the paralysis by focusing on the one thing she could control: the work. She decided not to choose, not yet. Instead, she would prepare. On her next day off, she went to the library, not to borrow a book, but to sit at a public computer. For hours, she meticulously typed up a dozen of her short prose poems, the ones that felt the most complete. The act of seeing her words on the screen, in the clean, anonymous font of Times New Roman, was transformative. Stripped of her cramped, emotional handwriting, they looked different: more objective, more real. The one about Sal, the one about the pancake-sharing couple, the one about the jukebox singing to the exhausted. She printed them out, the warm pages emerging from the machine smelling of hot toner and possibility. Back in her apartment, she spread the twelve poems on her floor, a tarot deck of her own making. She moved them around, trying different combinations, searching for the three or four that spoke to each other, that created a story when placed side by side. It was no longer about her personal feelings; it was about building the strongest possible offering. She chose four. The poem about Sal. The one about the greasy rainbow in the dishwater. The one about the geometry of the shared pancake breakfast. And a new, short one she had written after the festival, about the impossible blue of the prairie sky seen from the passenger seat of a car. She put them in a folder, her heart beating a slow, steady rhythm. The decision was made.\n\nThe final act was a quiet, solitary ritual. She bought a box of crisp, manila envelopes and a book of stamps. In her small, quiet room, she printed a cover letter, her hands shaking only slightly as she typed her name, Lucie Moreau, followed by her address, the address of this basement suite that had been both her prison and her chrysalis. She addressed the envelope to *Event*, the journal Alistair had marked with the note about Sal. It felt right to start there. She folded the poems and the letter, slid them into the envelope, and sealed the flap, her own DNA now a part of the package. The next morning, on her way to the diner in the cold, grey dawn, she stopped at a corner mailbox. The street was empty. The world was still asleep. She held the envelope in her hand for a long, weighted moment. It contained so much more than four pieces of paper. It contained the hiss of the grill, the exhaustion in a cook\u2019s shoulders, a flicker of light on a chrome napkin dispenser, a teacher\u2019s belief, a stranger\u2019s blessing. It was her entire new world, condensed into a single, flat object. With a final, deep breath, she pushed it through the metal slot. The soft thud as it landed inside was the only sound in the quiet street. The work was out of her hands. It was in the mail. It was on its way.The day after she mailed the poems, the world felt strangely quiet, as if a constant background hum she hadn\u2019t even been aware of had suddenly ceased. The act of letting the envelope fall into the dark mouth of the mailbox had been a severing. The poems were no longer hers. They were untethered, floating out in the vast, indifferent postal system, and a part of her had gone with them. She walked into the Gopher Hole that morning feeling hollowed out, strangely light. The familiar weight of the diner\u2014the thick, greasy air, the perpetual clatter, the psychic burden of a thousand small demands\u2014rushed in to fill the void, and for the first time in weeks, it was almost a comfort. The weight of a stack of hot plates was a verifiable fact in a world that had become entirely hypothetical. The simple, transactional nature of pouring a cup of coffee was a relief from the vast, unknowable journey her four small pages were now undertaking.\n\nA new ritual quickly established itself, a daily pilgrimage of hope and dread. Her walk home from the bus stop now included a detour to the small bank of community mailboxes at the end of her street. Her heart would begin to hammer as she approached, her hand fumbling with the small key. She would pull open the little metal door with a sense of fatalistic ceremony, expecting\u2026 she didn\u2019t know what. A thin, official-looking envelope that would signal a swift, brutal rejection? Nothing? The latter was what she always found. Just the usual junk mail, flyers for pizza and local politicians, an electricity bill. Each day of emptiness was both a reprieve and a small, accumulating torture. The silence stretched. She began to imagine the journey of her envelope, picturing it in a canvas bin in a rumbling truck, being sorted by indifferent machines, landing in a pile on a desk in an office she couldn\u2019t even picture. She imagined an editor, a faceless, tired person like Alistair, picking it up, sighing, and slitting it open. And then, her imagination would go blank. The scene would refuse to play out, leaving her suspended in a state of pure, anxious potential.\n\nHer writing stalled. The creative energy that had been buzzing through her for weeks seemed to have been sealed in the manila envelope along with the poems. When she sat down with her notebook, her mind was not in the alleyway with Sal or in the corner booth with the young lovers. It was in a hypothetical office in another province, waiting for a verdict. The act of paying attention, which had become a joyful discipline, now felt pointless. Why describe the way the morning light hit the sugar dispenser when her best, most polished words were already out in the world, being ignored or judged? The silence from the journal was a mirror, reflecting her own insignificance back at her. The confidence she had felt after the festival began to fray at the edges, the vibrant colors of that day fading into a muted, anxious grey. She had been brave, as Alistair had urged. But she had not been prepared for the profound loneliness of bravery\u2019s aftermath.\n\nWhen Tuesday came, her anxiety was a sharp, physical thing. She felt a desperate need to see Alistair, to confess her paralysis, to ask him how long this purgatory was supposed to last. She walked into the classroom, and when their eyes met, he seemed to read the frantic question in her gaze. He gave her a small, almost imperceptible nod, a silent message of reassurance that helped her breathe a little easier. The class was on the raw, confessional poetry of Sylvia Plath, and the furious, desperate energy of the poems felt like a perfect match for Lucie\u2019s own taut, frayed nerves. He spoke of Plath\u2019s relentless drive, her ambition, her rage at the world\u2019s indifference. For the first time, Lucie understood that ambition and fear were two sides of the same coin, that the hunger to be heard was inextricably linked to the terror of being ignored.\n\nThe walk after class was a lifeline. The cold air bit at her cheeks, a welcome, grounding shock. They walked in their now-familiar silence for a few blocks before she finally found the courage to speak. \u201cI did it,\u201d she said, her voice small against the quiet hum of the sleeping city. \u201cI sent four of them. To *Event*.\u201d He didn\u2019t stop walking, but she saw his shoulders relax slightly, a subtle release of a tension she hadn\u2019t even known he was carrying. \u201cThat\u2019s a brave first step, Lucie,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the hardest part.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d she said, the word coming out with more force than she intended. \u201cThe silence is the hardest part. It\u2019s been a week. I can\u2019t write. I can\u2019t think about anything else. It feels\u2026 like I\u2019m holding my breath, and I don\u2019t know when I\u2019m allowed to breathe again.\u201d The confession tumbled out, a torrent of anxiety she had been holding back for days. She finally looked at him, her face pleading for an answer. \u201cHow long does it last?\u201d\n\nAlistair stopped under a streetlight, turning to face her. The familiar weariness was back in his eyes, but it was now mingled with a deep, knowing empathy. \u201cOh, Lucie,\u201d he sighed, and the sound was full of a shared, historical pain. \u201cIt never lasts. And it lasts forever.\u201d He saw the confusion on her face and elaborated. \u201cThe waiting for this specific envelope will end. But the waiting itself\u2026 that\u2019s the job. You send a part of your soul out into the world, and you wait. And you wait. And most of the time, the world doesn\u2019t write back. And if it does, it\u2019s usually just to say, \u2018No, thank you.\u2019\u201d He told her about his own first submission, a handful of overwrought poems he\u2019d sent to a prestigious journal when he was nineteen. He described the same ritual of checking the mail, the same agonizing silence. \u201cI waited for six months,\u201d he said, a faint, wry smile on his lips. \u201cSix months of my life, orbiting around this one submission. And then one day, I got it back. A form letter. A photocopied rejection slip, not even a handwritten note. My name wasn't even on it. It just said, \u2018Thank you for your interest.\u2019\u201d\n\nHe saw the look of horror on Lucie\u2019s face and his smile softened. \u201cI was devastated. I thought it was a verdict on my soul. I threw out all my notebooks. I didn\u2019t write a single line for almost a year. I thought, \u2018I\u2019m not a writer. They said so.\u2019\u201d He paused, his gaze turning inward, remembering the sting of that long-ago failure. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the test, you see. The rejection isn\u2019t the test. Everyone gets rejected. The silence is the test. The waiting is the test. It\u2019s designed to weed out the people who are only in it for the applause. It\u2019s a filter for the ones who need to write like they need to breathe. The ones who will keep doing the work even when the world is profoundly, insultingly silent.\u201d He looked at her, his expression serious, his gray eyes holding hers. \u201cThe only way to survive the waiting is to make it irrelevant. You have to start the next poem. And the next one. You have to fall back in love with the work itself, not with the hope of its reception. The work is the only part you can control. It is the only part that is truly yours.\u201d\n\nHis words were not a comforting balm; they were a dose of strong, bitter medicine. He wasn't promising her that her poems would be accepted. He was telling her that, in all likelihood, they wouldn't be. He was welcoming her not into the community of success, but into the far larger, more honorable community of shared artistic struggle. He was telling her that this agonizing period of waiting was not a temporary state of torment, but a fundamental, recurring condition of the life she had chosen. He was telling her it was normal. The realization was a profound, grounding relief. She was not alone in this feeling. He had felt it. Eleanor Vance had felt it. Marion Croft had felt it. The silence wasn\u2019t a personal failing; it was a rite of passage. She took a deep breath, and for the first time in a week, it felt like she was truly drawing air into her lungs. The waiting was not a void. It was part of the process. It was a room in the house of writing, and Alistair had just shown her where the light switch was. \u201cOkay,\u201d she said, her voice a quiet whisper, but steady now. \u201cOkay. The next poem.\u201d He nodded, a look of immense pride in his eyes. He had given her a far greater gift than a list of journals. He had given her a strategy for survival.Alistair\u2019s words had been a key, but it was up to Lucie to turn it in the lock. That night, back in her basement suite, the silence was no longer an accusation. It was a space waiting to be filled. She sat at her wobbly table, the notebook open to a fresh, terrifyingly blank page. The urge to think about her four lost poems, to track their imaginary journey across the country, was a powerful gravitational pull. But she resisted, anchoring herself in the present moment with a deliberate act of memory. She closed her eyes and summoned the Gopher Hole, not as a place of drudgery, but as a territory to be explored. She thought of a small detail from her last shift: an elderly man sitting alone, meticulously, almost surgically, separating the peas from the carrots on his plate. She\u2019d watched him for a full five minutes, fascinated by the quiet intensity of his task, the strange, solitary order he was imposing on his small, beige world. Her pen, which had felt heavy and useless for days, began to move. *The old man wages a quiet war against the chaos of his plate. Each pea a prisoner rounded up, each carrot a collaborator pushed aside. This is his last, tiny kingdom.* The words were not perfect, but they were a start. They were a new breath.\n\nThe work became the antidote to the waiting. At the diner, she moved with a renewed, almost predatory focus. She was no longer just observing; she was hunting for the precise, telling detail, the line that would unlock a larger truth. She saw a teenage girl in a booth, furiously texting, her face illuminated by the phone\u2019s cold blue light, oblivious to her mother who sat opposite her, staring at her daughter\u2019s averted face with an expression of such naked, heartbreaking longing that Lucie had to turn away. That night, she wrote: *Her mother\u2019s love is a message left on read.* She saw the way the first real snowfall of the deep winter silenced the city, muffling the usual sounds of traffic and transforming the grimy alley behind the diner into a place of stark, monastic beauty. The work became a muscle she exercised daily, and the more she used it, the stronger it grew, pushing the anxious static of the waiting further and further into the background.\n\nThe daily trip to the mailbox became a different kind of ritual. The frantic hope and dread were replaced by a kind of detached, scientific curiosity. She would unlock the small metal door, her heart no longer hammering, and pull out the inevitable collection of junk mail. She would look at the glossy flyers promising impossible weight loss and effortless wealth, at the urgent political mailings full of manufactured outrage, and she would see them not as an annoyance, but as a different kind of poetry\u2014a poetry of desperation, of empty promises and the loud, frantic noise a world makes when it has nothing true to say. The silence from *Event* continued. A week became three weeks, then a month. The deep snows of December gave way to the brutal, biting cold of January. The silence was no longer an agonizing suspense; it was just a fact, a feature of the winter landscape, as constant and as unremarkable as the frozen ground.\n\nTheir Tuesday walks deepened, evolving from mentorship into a true, collaborative exchange. The power dynamic had subtly but irrevocably shifted. She was no longer coming to him for validation, but for consultation. One evening, she read him a new piece, one she was struggling with, about the way the regulars at the diner used nicknames for her\u2014Lucy-Goosey, Sweetcheeks, Hon\u2014as a way of claiming a small, harmless piece of her, and the strange, cumulative weight of all that casual ownership. \u201cThe ending feels wrong,\u201d she told him, not as a confession of failure, but as a statement of a technical problem. \u201cIt\u2019s too sentimental.\u201d He listened, his head cocked, and then offered not a solution, but a question. \u201cWhat if the ending isn\u2019t about how it makes you feel? What if it\u2019s about what it reveals about them?\u201d They spent twenty minutes under a streetlight, two literary mechanics taking apart an engine, their breath pluming in the frigid air as they debated the merits of a single word, the placement of a line break. He had given her a map, and now she was helping him chart new territories within it.\n\nIt was a Tuesday in late February, nearly two months after she had mailed the envelope. The cold had a damp, weary edge to it, the first hint of a distant, unimaginable spring. She was walking home from the bus, her mind on a line she was trying to get right, and she checked the mail with the same detached habit she had cultivated for weeks. She pulled out the usual flyers, and then her fingers brushed against something different. A standard, business-sized envelope. White. Thinner than she would have expected. Her heart, which had been so well-behaved for weeks, gave a single, violent lurch, like a car engine seizing. Her breath caught in her throat. In the top left corner, in a simple, san-serif font, was the return address. *Event Magazine. Department of English. Simon Fraser University. Burnaby, BC.* It was real. It was here. The world, which had been so profoundly silent, had finally written back.\n\nShe did not rip it open there on the cold, windswept street. She walked the rest of the way to her apartment in a state of suspended animation, the envelope clutched in her gloved hand. It felt impossibly light, as if it contained nothing at all. She let herself into her suite, the quiet of the room a stark contrast to the roaring in her ears. She went through her rituals with a slow, deliberate precision, a conscious effort to delay the inevitable. She took off her coat and hung it on the hook. She placed her keys in the bowl by the door. She took off her wet boots and lined them up neatly on the mat. Only then did she walk to the table, her sanctuary, and place the envelope in the center, under the warm circle of light from the lamp. It lay there, white and silent and full of power, a verdict waiting to be read.\n\nHer fingers, numb with cold and adrenaline, were clumsy as she slid a thumb under the flap and tore it open. The sound was small, but it felt as loud as a gunshot in the quiet room. She pulled out the contents. Her own four poems, neatly folded, looking like they had been on a long, tired journey. And clipped to the top with a small, silver paperclip was a piece of paper, a half-sheet, smaller than a postcard. She knew instantly what it was. It was a form. There were checkboxes and printed lines of text. A single box was checked with a crisp, blue X. *We are sorry, but this submission is not a fit for us at this time. We wish you the best of luck in placing your work elsewhere.* Underneath, a generic, printed \u201cThank you for your interest.\u201d It was the photocopied dismissal, the empty, impersonal rejection he had warned her about. It was exactly as he had said it would be.\n\nA hot, sickening wave of disappointment washed over her, a physical blow that made her want to curl in on herself. The sting of tears was sharp and immediate. The work she had bled for, the lines she had wrestled into existence, had been weighed, measured, and dismissed with a blue X in a box. Her first impulse was to crumple the whole package in her fist, to hurl it into the garbage, to erase the evidence of her foolish, audacious hope. The shame was a visceral thing, a burning in her cheeks. But then, through the hot static of her own failure, Alistair\u2019s voice echoed, calm and steady. *The rejection isn\u2019t the test. Everyone gets rejected. The silence is the test\u2026 The waiting is the test.* This small, sterile piece of paper was not a verdict on her soul. It was not the end of the story. It was just a plot point. It was a closed door. She let out a long, shuddering breath, the air she had been holding since she saw the envelope. She unclipped the rejection slip. She looked at it for a long moment, this artifact from the world of letters, her first one. Then she set it aside on the table, not as a mark of shame, but as a souvenir of her first expedition. She took her four poems, her brave little soldiers returning from a lost battle, and smoothed them out. They were still good. The truth in them was still true. They were still hers. With a steady hand, she picked up the typed list Alistair had given her. She drew a neat, firm line through the name *Event*. Then her eyes moved to the next name on the list. *Prairie Fire*. She stood up, walked to the drawer where she kept her stationery, and pulled out a fresh, clean manila envelope.The journey to the corner mailbox the next morning was a different kind of pilgrimage. The raw hope of the first sending had been replaced by something harder and more durable: resolve. The air was cold and thin, stinging Lucie\u2019s lungs, and the sky was a flat, unforgiving sheet of grey. The world seemed stripped of its poetry, reduced to its bare, functional elements. But the envelope in her hand was a counter-argument. It was not a desperate plea flung into the void; it was a deliberate act, a strategic redeployment. She did not linger at the mailbox. She did not whisper a prayer as she pushed the envelope through the slot. She simply executed the task with a quiet, grim efficiency. The soft thud of its landing was not a sound of release, but a sound of reset. It was the click of a chamber being reloaded. The campaign had begun again.\n\nThat evening, a frigid, blustery Tuesday, their walk after class felt charged with a new, unspoken agenda. The wind whipped around the corners of the silent downtown buildings, a mournful, wailing sound that seemed to mirror the loneliness of the writer\u2019s life. Lucie walked with her hands shoved deep in her pockets, the rejection slip folded into a small, neat square in her wallet, a secret she was carrying to confession. They walked two full blocks in a silence that was heavier than usual before she found the words. \u201cI heard back from *Event*,\u201d she said, her voice steady, her gaze fixed on the cracked pavement in front of her. \u201cIt was a no.\u201d She did not elaborate. She did not describe the blue X or the hollow feeling it had carved in her chest. She stated it as a fact, a piece of data. She felt Alistair\u2019s gaze on her, studying her profile, searching, she knew, for the tell-tale signs of devastation.\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d he said after a moment, his voice calm and matter-of-fact. \u201cWelcome to the club. The first one is a bastard.\u201d The bluntness of his language, the casual, almost cheerful acceptance of her failure as a rite of passage, was more comforting than any expression of sympathy could have been. \u201cWhat did you do?\u201d The question was the real test. He was not asking how she felt; he was asking what action she had taken. She finally turned to look at him, a small, weary smile touching her lips for the first time. \u201cI crossed it off the list,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I sent the poems to *Prairie Fire* this morning.\u201d For the first time since she had known him, Alistair Finch stopped walking and laughed. It was not a loud laugh, but a low, rumbling sound of pure, unadulterated delight and pride. It was the sound of a teacher seeing his most difficult, most important lesson land perfectly. \u201cLucie Moreau,\u201d he said, shaking his head in wry admiration, his breath pluming in the frigid air. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be dangerous.\u201d\n\nThe waiting began again, but it was a different beast. The first period of silence had been a frantic, desperate vigil. This new silence was a low, steady hum in the background of her life, a condition she was learning to live with. It was the new normal. Spring arrived on the prairies not as a gentle awakening, but as a muddy, reluctant truce. The mountains of grey, exhaust-stained snow melted, revealing the winter-killed grass and a season\u2019s worth of forgotten trash. The Gopher Hole smelled of wet wool and damp boots. But Lucie was insulated from the bleakness of the season by the fierce, internal fire of her work. She had followed Alistair\u2019s advice to the letter. She had made the waiting irrelevant by falling back in love with the work itself. Her notebook filled with the poetry of the thaw: the melancholic drip of water from awnings, the dirty puddles that reflected the grey sky with a startling, perfect clarity, the first, tentative song of a bird returning to a barren-looking tree.\n\nHer collection of poems grew. She typed them up at the library, building a small, respectable manuscript of a dozen, then fifteen, then twenty pieces. Following her own strategic logic, she sent out another packet of four poems to *The Malahat Review*, and a week later, another to *The Fiddlehead*. She was no longer sending out her only children; she was deploying troops on multiple fronts. The rejections began to trickle in. *Prairie Fire* sent back a form slip after six weeks. *The Malahat Review* took nearly three months to return her work with the same polite, impersonal dismissal. She would open the envelopes, register the familiar, faint sting of disappointment, and then she would file the slip in a small box she now kept on her desk. The box was becoming a tangible record of her efforts, a testament to her resilience. Each slip was a scar, and she was beginning to see them not as blemishes, but as marks of a veteran, proof that she was in the fight.\n\nIt was a Tuesday in early April. The air was still cool, but it held the unmistakable, loamy scent of damp earth and new growth. Lucie was on her way to class, having stopped at her mailbox on the way. There was another envelope, this one bearing the elegant, old-fashioned script of *The Fiddlehead*\u2019s logo. She had opened it without ceremony, standing right there on the street, expecting another form slip for her collection. Her poems were inside, folded as always. The rejection slip was the standard format. A blue X in the box next to *We are sorry, but this submission is not a fit for us at this time.* She had been about to fold it and put it in her bag with the others when she saw it. At the very bottom of the slip, below the printed lines, was a tiny, almost illegible scrawl in blue pen, written so small it was clearly an afterthought, a hurried impulse. She had to hold the paper close to her face, her breath catching as she deciphered the script. *Not for us, but \u201cThe Geometry of a Shared Meal\u201d has a lovely, quiet power. Keep going. -S.K.*\n\nShe stood frozen on the sidewalk, the world receding into a muted blur. It was a no. But it was a no that had looked her in the eye. It was a no that had learned her name. A person. A real, living person with the initials S.K. had read her poem and had been moved enough to break protocol, to scrawl a ten-word message of encouragement. The words were a key turning in a lock she hadn\u2019t even known was there. It wasn\u2019t just Alistair\u2019s kindness. It wasn\u2019t just her own stubborn belief. This was external, objective proof from a stranger, a gatekeeper, a person whose job it was to say no. And they had taken the time to whisper, *Keep going*. A hot, sudden tear escaped and traced a path down her cold cheek. It was not a tear of sadness or frustration, but of a dizzying, overwhelming gratitude. She walked the rest of the way to the college in a daze, the small half-sheet of paper clutched in her hand like a winning lottery ticket. When she walked into the classroom, Alistair looked up, and he must have seen the dazed, luminous joy on her face. A slow, questioning smile spread across his lips. She walked straight to his desk, bypassing her own seat, and placed the small slip of paper on the lectern in front of him. He looked down, read the brief, scrawled message, and then looked back up at her, his own eyes shining with a fierce, reflected pride. \u201cSee?\u201d he whispered, his voice full of a quiet, triumphant joy. \u201cThe world is starting to write back.\u201d",

It was the sound of another plate of eggs going cold, another trucker\u2019s special being born into a world of beige and grease. The Gopher Hole Diner on Gaetz Avenue wasn\u2019t a career; it was a holding pattern, a purgatory of sticky ketchup bottles and coffee brewed to the consistency of crude oil. Her hands, perpetually chapped, smelled of fried onions and the lemon-scented disinfectant she used to wipe down the vinyl booths. She moved through the narrow aisles with an economy of motion learned over two years of balancing hot plates and dodging the wandering hands of regulars who thought a tip bought them a piece of her. Most days, Lucie didn't mind. She could turn a part of her brain off, the part that dreamt, and just become a pair of hands, a voice that said, \"More coffee, hon?\"\n\nBut tonight, the serpent on the grill seemed to be whispering a name. *Finch. Alistair Finch.* The name was all wrong for Red Deer. It belonged in a leather-bound book, not on a class roster at the community college. She swiped a damp cloth over a table, chasing a smear of syrup into oblivion, but his voice was in her head, a low current beneath the diner's clatter. It wasn't a voice for ordering a lumberjack breakfast. It was a voice that could make a Tuesday night poetry class feel like a secret confession. A voice that took the dead words of Keats and breathed a feverish, desperate life back into them.\n\nHe had read from 'Ode on a Grecian Urn' last night. The other students, a mix of welders upgrading their high school English and bored housewives looking for a diversion, had stared blankly at their photocopied sheets. Their pens were still. But Lucie had felt the words land inside her like stones dropped into a deep well, the ripples spreading out into the forgotten, silent corners of her. *\"Bold Lover, never, never canst thou kiss, Though winning near the goal\u2014yet, do not grieve; She cannot fade, though thou hast not thy bliss, For ever wilt thou love, and she be fair!\"*\n\nMr. Finch had looked up then, his gaze sweeping over the fluorescent-lit room, his eyes a tired, intelligent gray. They were the color of a winter sky just before the snow begins to fall. He had a way of looking at you that made you feel utterly exposed, as though he could see the title of every unread book on your soul\u2019s shelf. His eyes had passed over Brenda from accounting and fat old Gary who snored in the back row, and then they had stopped. On her. Lucie Moreau, in her worn-out hoodie, her pen clutched so tight her knuckles were white.\n\n\"Miss Moreau,\" he'd said, and the 'Moreau' had sounded exotic, French, not the flat, anglicized 'Morrow' everyone else used. \"What do you make of that? This eternal, unfulfilled love. Is it a tragedy or a kind of perfection?\"\n\nThe whole room had turned to look at her. She felt a hot blush creep up her neck, a betrayal. She was the waitress, the background character. She wasn't supposed to have an opinion on Grecian urns. She could feel the sticky residue of the diner on her skin, imagined she smelled of bacon.\n\n\"I think...\" she'd started, her voice a reedy thing, \"I think it\u2019s the saddest thing I\u2019ve ever heard.\"\n\nA few people had snickered. But Mr. Finch hadn't. He had leaned forward slightly, resting his elbows on the lectern, his worn tweed jacket bunching at the shoulders. \"Go on,\" he\u2019d urged, his voice soft, coaxing.\n\n\"It\u2019s not perfect,\" she'd said, the words coming out in a rush, a jumble. \"It\u2019s a trap. They're stuck. He never gets her, but she never gets to leave. She\u2019s just\u2026 decoration. For his forever love. It's not her life anymore. It\u2019s just part of his story.\"\n\nThe room was silent. Utterly. The hum of the projector fan was the only sound. Mr. Finch had stared at her for a long, unblinking moment. A strange, small smile played on his lips, a flicker of warmth in the cool gray of his eyes. \"That,\" he had said, very quietly, \"is an exceptionally insightful reading, Miss Moreau. Thank you.\" And then he had moved on, but the connection, the brief, intense current that had passed between the lectern and her desk in the third row, had lingered in the air like an electrical charge.\n\n\"Order up!\" barked Sal from the kitchen window, shattering the memory. A platter with a steak, bleeding slightly onto a pile of limp fries, slid onto the pass.\n\nLucie grabbed it. \"Table four, got it,\" she called back, her diner-voice seamlessly taking over. She delivered the plate to a man whose face was a roadmap of broken capillaries and whose hands were calloused from a lifetime of turning wrenches. He grunted without looking up. She refilled his coffee, smiled her practiced, empty smile, and walked back towards the kitchen, the echo of Mr. Finch's \"Thank you\" a secret music only she could hear.\n\nHer life was a world of such stark contrasts. There was the Gopher Hole, all noise and grease and blunt needs. Then there were those two hours every Tuesday and Thursday night, a sterile classroom made sacred by the presence of one man and the ghosts of long-dead poets he summoned. He was maybe forty, with fine lines around his eyes and threads of silver in his dark, untidy hair. He looked tired. Not the physical exhaustion Lucie knew from being on her feet for ten hours, but a deeper, more profound weariness. A weariness of the soul. He wore his clothes like they were a costume he'd been forced into and had long since given up trying to fill properly. Ink stains on his cuffs. A faint, pleasant scent of old paper, tobacco, and something else\u2014something clean and wintry, like gin.\n\nAfter that class, as she was stuffing her notebook into her bag, he\u2019d called her name again. \"Miss Moreau. A moment.\"\n\nShe had approached the desk, her heart doing a nervous little tap dance against her ribs. The other students were a departing stream, their chatter about weekend plans and the hockey game fading down the hall.\n\n\"Your last essay,\" he said, pulling a thin sheaf of papers from a folder. Hers. \"On Wordsworth.\" He tapped it with a long finger. \"You write with a very\u2026 raw honesty. It\u2019s unpolished, but it\u2019s there. The feeling.\" He handed it to her. At the top, in a spidery, elegant script, he\u2019d written *A+*, but it was the comment at the end she read later, under the dim light of a bus stop, that made her stop breathing for a second. *'You see the world as a poet does, even if you don't know it yet. Don't let the world grind that out of you.'*\n\nHis fingers had brushed hers as she took the paper. A static shock, no bigger than a pinprick, but it shot up her arm and settled somewhere deep in her chest. She\u2019d looked up at him, and in the empty classroom, under the cold lights, he seemed less like a teacher and more like just a man. A sad, tired man who saw something in her that no one else had ever bothered to look for.\n\n\"Thank you, sir,\" she\u2019d managed to whisper.\n\n\"Alistair,\" he\u2019d corrected her, his voice even lower than usual. \"In the hall. Outside of class. My name is Alistair.\"\n\nAlistair. The name felt heavy and strange on her tongue, a word from a foreign language she was only just beginning to learn. She hadn\u2019t dared to say it. She\u2019d just nodded, clutched her essay to her chest like a holy relic, and fled. She walked all the way home that night, ignoring the bus, the cold prairie wind whipping at her face. The streets of Red Deer, usually so drab and familiar, seemed charged with a new, thrilling strangeness. The sodium lights of the strip malls cast long, dramatic shadows. The distant train whistle was a lonely, romantic cry. The world hadn't changed, but she had. A door had been opened a crack, showing her a glimpse of a room she never knew existed, and a man named Alistair was holding the key. Now, even the hiss of the grill sounded like the beginning of a song."

But for Lucie, the diner\u2019s soundscape was muted, filtered through the memory of Alistair\u2019s voice. She refilled sugar dispensers, her hands moving with their own ingrained intelligence, while her mind was miles and hours away, dissecting every word, every glance. The comment on her essay was seared into her brain: *You see the world as a poet does*. No one had ever said anything like that to her. Her parents had seen a future dental hygienist. Her ex-boyfriend, a guy who worked on the rigs, had seen a convenient, warm body for his two weeks back in town. The customers at the Gopher Hole saw a function, a human mechanism for delivering coffee. Alistair Finch saw a poet. The idea was so foreign, so ludicrously beautiful, that it made her chest ache.\n\nA hand shot out and grabbed her wrist as she passed by Booth 7. It was Earl, a trucker with a gut that strained the buttons of his plaid shirt and a leering grin that always made Lucie\u2019s skin crawl. He was one of the \u201cwandering hands\u201d regulars.\n\u201cHey there, Lucy-Goosey,\u201d he slurred, his breath a foul mix of stale beer and coffee. \u201cYou\u2019re lookin\u2019 mighty serious tonight. Smile a little. It ain\u2019t gonna kill ya.\u201d\nUsually, she would pull her arm away with a tight, forced smile and a placating, \u201cComin\u2019 right up with that pie, Earl.\u201d It was part of the uniform, the practiced de-escalation. But tonight, the words from the Grecian Urn echoed in her head. *She cannot fade*. She felt the heat of his skin against hers, the greasy pressure of his thumb. She thought of the girl on the urn, a decoration for someone else\u2019s story. A hot, unfamiliar anger surged through her, sharp and clean. She stopped, turned her head slowly, and met his gaze. She didn\u2019t smile.\n\u201cLet go of my arm, Earl,\u201d she said. Her voice wasn\u2019t loud, but it was flat and cold, entirely stripped of its usual \u201chon\u201d and \u201csweetie\u201d affectations. The man\u2019s grin faltered. He blinked, surprised by the directness, the lack of a playful retreat. He saw something new in her eyes, a hardness he wasn\u2019t used to. After a beat, his hand dropped away.\n\u201cJust bein\u2019 friendly,\u201d he mumbled, turning his attention back to his half-eaten burger, suddenly looking defensive. Lucie walked away without another word, her heart hammering, not with fear, but with a wild, exhilarating sense of power. The serpent on the grill seemed to hiss its approval.\n\nSal watched the exchange from his window, one bushy eyebrow raised. When Lucie came back to the pass to grab a check, he grunted. \u201cYou finally growin\u2019 a spine, Moreau?\u201d\n\u201cJust tired of it,\u201d she said, not looking at him as she scribbled the total for table two.\n\u201c\u2019Bout time,\u201d he said, turning back to his flat-top and scraping it down with a vengeance, sending a shower of greasy sparks into the hood vent. \u201cThis place\u2019ll eat you alive if you let it.\u201d Sal had been at the Gopher Hole for fifteen years. He was as much a fixture as the cracked linoleum floor. He rarely spoke more than three words to her at a time, but in his gruff way, Lucie knew he watched out for her. He saw her, too, but not as a poet. He saw her as a younger, less-scarred version of himself, another soul caught in the Gopher Hole\u2019s gravitational pull. His concern, unlike Alistair\u2019s praise, felt like an anchor.\n\nThe last of the late-night crowd shuffled out after midnight, leaving behind a wake of dirty dishes and crumpled napkins. The fluorescent lights hummed into the quiet, making the streaks on the floor and the grime in the corners seem more pronounced. This was Lucie\u2019s favorite and least favorite part of the night. The work was mindless\u2014stacking chairs, mopping the sticky floors, marrying the half-empty ketchup bottles\u2014but the silence was a vacuum that was usually filled with her own exhaustion and a bleak accounting of her dwindling savings. Tonight, however, the silence was a canvas. She wiped down the last of the vinyl seats, the smell of lemon disinfectant failing to mask the phantom scent of old paper and gin that clung to her memory. She saw Alistair\u2019s tired, intelligent eyes, the way his worn jacket hung on his frame, the ink on his fingers. He was a puzzle, a man who spoke of eternal beauty but seemed steeped in a profound, personal melancholy.\n\nFinally, she untied the stained apron, stuffing it into her locker along with the smell of fried onions and the ghost of Earl\u2019s unwelcome touch. Shrugging on her thin jacket, she stepped out of the back door into the sharp, clean shock of the autumn night. The air was cold, smelling of approaching winter. The diner was a box of garish light and noise behind her, and the street was a quiet ribbon of darkness. She pulled her essay from her bag, the pages cool against her fingers. Under a streetlight, she read his comment again, the spidery script a secret code just for her. *'Don't let the world grind that out of you.'* It was a plea. A command. A promise. She clutched the papers to her chest, the A+ a distant second to the validation of those twelve words. The world he was talking about, the one that grinds you down, was the Gopher Hole. It was Earl\u2019s hand and cold eggs and a life lived in a holding pattern. Alistair didn\u2019t know the specifics, but he had seen the pressure of it on her, and he had told her to resist. He had given her a weapon. She started the long walk home, the city no longer drab but full of dark, poetic corners, each shadow a verse waiting to be read."

But tonight, Lucie didn't huddle into her jacket. She walked with her head up, her gaze tracing the geometric tangle of power lines against the star-dusted sky. She saw them not as urban blight but as a kind of stark, industrial lace. The pawn shop on the corner, its windows barred and its neon sign flickering a desperate pink, wasn't just a place of last resorts; it was a museum of forgotten dreams, full of gold rings and guitars that had once promised stardom. She was seeing what he saw. Or, more terrifyingly, she was seeing what she had always seen, but had never had the language, or the permission, to articulate. His words weren't a key; they were a mirror, showing her a self she hadn't known was there.\n\nHer apartment was a basement suite in a squat bungalow on a street of identical squat bungalows. The air inside was always a little damp and smelled of the old carpet and the faint, persistent mildew that bloomed in the corners of the single, high window. It was the epitome of her holding-pattern life: cheap, functional, and devoid of personality. Usually, she walked in, dropped her keys in the bowl by the door, and fell onto the lumpy futon, too tired to do anything but stare at the water-stained ceiling. But tonight was different. She turned on the single lamp, its weak yellow light a poor substitute for the moon, and the small space seemed not just bleak, but unbearable. It was a physical manifestation of the life he had warned her against letting herself be ground down into.\n\nShe shed her jacket and the lingering scent of the Gopher Hole with it. In the tiny, cramped bathroom, she stared at her reflection in the cheap, clouded mirror. Her face was pale with fatigue, her hair pulled back in a messy bun from which strands had escaped over the course of her shift. She saw the faint lines of exhaustion around her eyes, the chapped texture of her lips. This was the face that belonged to \"hon\" and \"sweetie,\" the face that poured endless cups of coffee. But for a moment, under the hum of the bathroom fan, she saw something else flicker in her own eyes. The hardness that had stared down Earl. The focused intensity that had found the trap in Keats\u2019s eternal love. The raw honesty Alistair had seen on the page. She was both people, the waitress and the poet, and the space between them was a chasm she was suddenly, desperately afraid she might fall into.\n\nIgnoring the hunger gnawing at her stomach, she bypassed the kitchen and sat on the edge of her futon, her essay on Wordsworth spread on her lap. She had written about his ability to find profundity in the common, the way he elevated a field of daffodils or a solitary reaper into something monumental. She\u2019d connected it to her own life, writing about the fleeting, unexpected moments of grace she sometimes witnessed in the diner\u2014the silent kindness of a trucker paying for a younger man\u2019s meal, the way the morning light hit a glass of water and shattered into a rainbow on the table. She had thought it was sentimental nonsense, the kind of thing you write for an easy grade. She hadn't realized she was writing a manifesto for her own survival. *'You see the world as a poet does, even if you don't know it yet.'* She traced his script with her finger. He hadn't just given her an A+; he had given her a name for the part of herself she had always kept hidden, the part that dreamt. Now, the question was what to do with it. The Gopher Hole loomed tomorrow, a thirteen-hour double shift. But beyond that, forty-eight hours away, was Thursday. Two hours in a sterile room that had become the most alive place she knew. Two hours with the tired, sad man who held the key."

For a fleeting, blissful moment, Lucie lay tangled in her thin sheets, her mind still adrift in a sea of Grecian urns and wintry gray eyes. Then the reality of the thirteen-hour double shift landed with the thud of a sack of potatoes in her gut. Wednesday. The long, hard middle of the week, a mountain of grease and drudgery that had to be scaled to get to the small, sacred plateau of Thursday night. She swung her legs out of bed, her muscles aching in protest, the phantom weight of heavy platters already settling on her forearms. The poetic musings of the night before felt like a dream belonging to someone else, someone rested and clean and not facing a day that would be measured in coffee pots and bacon platters.\n\nAs she pulled on her uniform\u2014the black pants that were shiny at the knees and the faded pink polo shirt with the Gopher Hole logo embroidered over the heart\u2014she caught her reflection again. This time, she didn't see a poet. She saw a tired girl bracing for a long day. But the memory of Alistair\u2019s comment was a small, defiant pilot light glowing in the back of her mind. *Don\u2019t let the world grind that out of you.* Today, the world would be trying its absolute best. She braided her hair tightly, a practical, war-like measure against the heat and steam of the kitchen, and for the first time, she packed a small, slim notebook and a pen into her bag, tucking them into the side pocket, away from her wallet and keys. It felt like a ridiculous, hopeful gesture, like bringing a flower to a battlefield.\n\nThe Gopher Hole smelled the same as it always did at seven in the morning: stale coffee, bleach, and the anticipatory heat of the grill coming to life. Sal was already there, a silhouette moving in the dim kitchen, his radio tuned to a classic rock station that was just loud enough to be an irritant. The day began not with a bang, but with the familiar, grinding rhythm of the breakfast rush. The booths filled with construction workers and early-starting truckers, men who wanted their coffee hot, black, and now. Lucie\u2019s body took over, a well-oiled machine of efficiency. She moved, she poured, she wrote down orders in her looping, shorthand scrawl. \"Two eggs over-easy, bacon crisp, side of rye,\" she called to Sal, her voice slipping into the easy, professional cadence of the diner. She was the waitress again, a pair of hands and a voice that said, \"You got it, sweetie.\"\n\nYet, something was different. The separation she usually maintained, the part of her brain she could switch off, wasn't fully offline. It was observing, taking notes. She watched a young couple in a corner booth, barely twenty, sharing a plate of pancakes because it was all they could afford. He would cut a piece, load it with syrup, and slide it onto her fork. She would look at him with an adoration so naked and unguarded it was almost painful to watch. Lucie felt a pang, not of envy, but of a strange, tender recognition. It was a Wordsworth poem unfolding in Booth 3, a moment of sublime, unselfconscious beauty amid the clatter. She found herself smiling at them, a real smile, not the one she wore for tips. The girl, catching her eye, blushed and smiled back.\n\nLater, during the lull between breakfast and lunch, she found herself wiping down the counter, her gaze lost in the swirling patterns of the Formica. The surface was a universe of tiny scratches and faded stains, each one a fossil of a thousand forgotten meals. She thought of Alistair\u2019s hands, the long fingers stained with ink. She imagined him at his own desk, surrounded by towers of books, a cup of tea going cold as he got lost in a sentence, his brow furrowed in concentration. The image was so clear, so vivid, it felt like a memory. He was from a different world, a world where thoughts were the most important commodity, where the state of one\u2019s soul mattered more than the state of one\u2019s bank account. And he had invited her, just for a moment, to stand at the doorway to that world.\n\n\"Earth to Moreau,\" Sal\u2019s voice rasped, breaking the spell. \"Refill on three. Man looks like he's about to die of thirst.\" Lucie blinked, the diner snapping back into sharp, greasy focus. She grabbed the coffee pot, the heat warming her chapped hands. \"On it,\" she said. As she poured the black liquid into the man's thick ceramic mug, he grunted and slid a book he'd been reading to the side. It was a dog-eared paperback thriller, the cover depicting a shadowy man with a gun. It wasn't Keats, but it was a story. She saw the ink on the page, the way the man's thumb had smudged the cheap print. She saw the hunger for a world outside his own, a need for a narrative to lift him, for an hour, out of his life. For the first time, she didn't see the customer as just an empty cup to be filled. She saw a fellow traveler, looking for his own kind of escape. The thought was so surprising, so deeply empathetic, it almost made her stop pouring."

By the time the lunch rush gave way to the afternoon lull, Lucie\u2019s feet were swollen and her smile felt like a mask hardening on her face. Yet, her mind was a hive of activity. She saw the lonely desperation in the eyes of the salesman nursing a single cup of coffee for two hours, his territory map spread on the table like a battle plan. She heard the music in the rhythmic clink of Sal\u2019s spatula against the grill, a frantic, greasy jazz. She felt the weight of the unspoken stories that hung in the air, thick as the smoke from a forgotten cigarette. The world hadn't changed, but her attention to it had become a sharp, focused instrument. The grinding down felt less like a destruction and more like a sharpening, honing her to a fine, dangerous point. When she finally stumbled into her basement apartment late that night, the exhaustion was so profound it was almost a spiritual state.\n\nIgnoring the lumpy futon\u2019s siren call, she dropped her bag on the small, wobbly table that served as her desk. She pulled out the new notebook. The clean, lined pages seemed to mock the grime under her fingernails. For a long time, she just stared at the first empty sheet, the cheap ballpoint pen feeling alien and heavy in her hand. What was she supposed to write? A poem? The idea was laughable. But the command from Alistair\u2019s essay comment echoed: *Don\u2019t let the world grind that out of you.* This, then, was an act of resistance. Her hand began to move, hesitantly at first, then with more confidence. She didn\u2019t write a poem. She wrote fragments, captions for the images stored in her head. *Booth 3: two kids, one fork. Love as a shared plate of pancakes.* *Formica counter: a galaxy of knife-scars.* *Sal\u2019s radio: AC/DC at 8 a.m. is the sound of giving up.* *The man with the thriller. His thumb smudging the words, wanting to be in the story.* She filled a page, then another. The words were simple, unadorned, but they were hers. They were proof. When she finally fell into a dreamless sleep, the pen was still uncapped on the table, a sentinel guarding her reclaimed thoughts.\n\nThursday arrived, cloaked in a nervous, electric hum. The shift at the diner was an exercise in suspended animation. Every customer was an obstacle, every order a delay, every hour a year standing between her and the community college. She moved through her tasks with a distracted air that earned her a sharp \"Get your head in the game, Moreau\" from Sal when she nearly sent a stack of clean plates crashing to the floor. She felt a frantic need to wash the day off her, to scrub away the scent of the Gopher Hole before she entered that classroom. After her shift, she raced home, showering quickly, the hot water stinging her chapped hands. She stared at her meager wardrobe with an unfamiliar anxiety. The worn-out hoodie felt like a costume from her old life. She settled on a plain black sweater, the nicest thing she owned. It was still anonymous, but it felt like a deliberate choice, a small signal to herself that tonight was different. She was not just a body in a chair; she was Miss Moreau, who had an exceptionally insightful reading.\n\nThe hallways of the college were quiet, smelling of floor wax and old paper. The fluorescent lights seemed less cold tonight, more like a gentle, clarifying glow. When she walked into the classroom, he was already there, leaning against the lectern, staring out the large window at the encroaching darkness. He looked even more tired than she remembered, the lines around his gray eyes etched deeper. He turned as the students began to file in, and his gaze swept the room with that same unnerving perception. It passed over her, then snagged, and for a heartbeat, his expression softened. There was no smile, just a flicker of recognition, a silent acknowledgment that passed between them like a secret handshake. Lucie\u2019s heart did its familiar nervous flutter, and she slid into her usual seat, her hands trembling slightly as she took out her notebook\u2014the one filled with her diner observations.\n\nTonight\u2019s photocopied sheets were a poem by Robert Frost, 'After Apple-Picking.' Alistair began to read, and the room fell away. His voice, that low current, wrapped around the words, filling them with the poet's bone-deep weariness and the strange, hallucinatory beauty of the harvest. *\"My instep arch not only keeps the ache, It keeps the pressure of a ladder-round. I feel the ladder sway as the boughs bend. And I keep hearing from the cellar bin The rumbling sound Of load on load of apples coming in.\"* Lucie felt the words in her own aching arches, in the phantom weight of platters on her arms. It was the same exhaustion she had felt last night, the same dream-like state where the day\u2019s work haunts the beginning of sleep. The poem wasn't about apples; it was about being consumed by your labor, about the residue of a life of physical toil that seeps into the soul.\n\nWhen he finished, the silence in the room was heavy, contemplative. \"This isn't just about a day's work, is it?\" Alistair asked the room at large, his eyes scanning the faces. \"Frost is talking about a kind of spiritual exhaustion. A life so full of sensory input, of *doing*, that sleep itself becomes just another landscape of the day's labor. What do you suppose he means by 'this sleep of mine, whatever sleep it is'?\" Brenda from accounting suggested it was about burnout. Gary, awake for once, mumbled something about retirement. Alistair listened patiently, nodding, but his gaze kept drifting back to Lucie. It wasn\u2019t a demand, but a quiet question. He was giving her the space to speak if she chose. She felt the words rising in her throat\u2014words about crude oil coffee and the hiss of the grill becoming the serpent in your dreams\u2014but they caught there, a knot of fear and exhilaration. She clutched her pen, her knuckles white, and said nothing, letting the moment pass.\n\nThe class ended, and the spell was broken. The students shuffled out, their chatter about the coming weekend filling the quiet space Alistair had created. Lucie packed her bag slowly, her mind replaying her own silence, her cowardice. She had a page full of notes connecting Frost's ladder-rungs to the worn linoleum of the Gopher Hole, and she had said nothing. She was the last one left. She risked a glance at the front of the room. He was still at the lectern, not packing his things, just standing there as if waiting. He looked directly at her, and the noise of the hallway, her own frantic heartbeat, everything seemed to fade. \"You were quiet tonight, Miss Moreau,\" he said, his voice soft in the now-empty room. \"I thought Frost might have spoken to you.\" He wasn't accusing; he was curious. He was asking why she hadn't shared.\n\nLucie swallowed, her throat dry. She walked towards the lectern, the few steps feeling like a mile-long journey across a swaying tightrope. She stopped a few feet away, clutching the strap of her bag. \"It was...\" she started, her voice barely a whisper. \"It was too close.\" The admission hung in the air between them, vulnerable and absolute. A strange look crossed his face\u2014not pity, but a deep, somber understanding. He pushed himself away from the lectern, closing the small distance between them. The faint scent of old paper and winter gin was there again, a clean, sharp scent in the sterile room. \"I know what you mean,\" he said, his voice dropping even lower. \"Sometimes a poem isn't a curiosity. Sometimes it\u2019s a diagnosis.\" He paused, his gray eyes holding hers. \"You said my name was Alistair outside of class. I think perhaps we're outside of class now.\""

Lucie\u2019s tongue felt thick and useless in her mouth, the single word an impossible weight to lift. He was giving her permission to cross a line she hadn't even known was there, and the sudden proximity was dizzying, terrifying. She could only manage a small, jerky nod, her eyes wide, her knuckles white where she gripped the strap of her bag. He seemed to understand. He didn\u2019t press, didn\u2019t wait for her to parrot his name back to him. Instead, he leaned back against the lectern, creating a sliver of distance, a breath of air. His gaze, however, remained fixed on her, a steady, unwavering line of connection in the empty room.\n\n\"The residue of labor,\" he murmured, his voice a low counterpoint to the hum of the fluorescent lights. He picked up the thread of the poem as if it were a conversation they\u2019d been having for years. \"Frost knew. It gets under your fingernails, into the lines on your hands. But it\u2019s more than that. It seeps into your sleep, stains your dreams. You close your eyes and you're still on the ladder.\" He glanced down at his own hands, at the faint, bluish smudges of ink that haloed his nails and cuffs. \"Just a different kind of ladder.\"\n\nThe shared vulnerability in his words was a key turning a lock deep inside her. The fear receded, replaced by a powerful, magnetic pull of understanding. She was not alone in this feeling. He knew. He actually knew. \"It gets in your hearing,\" she said, the words surprising her with their clarity. \"I hear it even when it's quiet. The hiss of the grill. The clatter of plates. The order wheel spinning. It\u2019s a soundtrack that never stops.\" She was confessing a piece of her secret world, the bleak landscape of the Gopher Hole she guarded so carefully, and she watched his face for any sign of pity or revulsion. There was none. There was only a profound, listening stillness.\n\nHe absorbed her words, his tired gray eyes holding a deep, resonant empathy. He wasn\u2019t just hearing her; he was translating her experience into his own language, finding the universal truth within the specific, greasy detail. \"A constant serpent in the background,\" he mused, the phrase so perfect it was as if he\u2019d plucked it directly from her soul. He had no way of knowing she had thought those exact words. The coincidence was a small, sharp shock, a spark of static electricity in the charged air. He began packing his worn leather briefcase, his movements slow and deliberate, a stark contrast to the frantic energy that pulsed beneath Lucie\u2019s skin. He snapped the tarnished brass locks shut. \"I'm parked over on Ross Street. Are you walking that way?\"\n\nIt wasn't a question about directions. It was an invitation to let this moment, this strange and sacred bubble of quiet understanding, continue just a little longer. \"Yes,\" she breathed, the word coming out softer than she intended. He gave a slight nod, slinging the briefcase strap over his shoulder. The worn tweed of his jacket bunched up, and she had a sudden, absurd urge to smooth it down. They walked out of the classroom together, their footsteps echoing in the cavernous, empty hall. The sound was lonely but also intimate, a rhythm for two in the sleeping building. He didn't try to fill the silence with small talk. He seemed as comfortable in it as he was with the words of long-dead poets. For Lucie, who was used to the constant, demanding noise of the diner, the shared quiet was a new and profound form of communication.\n\nOutside, the night was cold and sharp. Their breath plumed in the air under the orange glow of the streetlights. The familiar streets of Red Deer seemed transformed, the mundane facades of insurance offices and vacant storefronts imbued with a shadowy, cinematic mystery. \"It's a strange town,\" Alistair said, as if reading her mind. \"All this frantic boom-and-bust energy, but underneath it feels\u2026 transient. As if everyone is just waiting for a signal to move on to somewhere else.\" He glanced at her. \"Do you feel that?\"\n\n\"It\u2019s a holding pattern,\" Lucie said without thinking, the phrase a cornerstone of her private vocabulary for her life. \"A purgatory of sticky ketchup bottles.\" The words were out before she could stop them, too raw, too specific. A hot blush crept up her neck. She had revealed too much of the Gopher Hole, of her own bitterness. But Alistair didn't laugh or recoil. A small, sad smile touched his lips. \"That\u2019s a poet\u2019s description, Miss Moreau.\" He paused, then corrected himself, his voice softer. \"Lucie.\"\n\nHer first name, spoken in his low cadence, was a revelation. It sounded new, polished, like an object of value. They reached the corner of Ross Street, the point where their paths would diverge. The moment was ending. A frantic panic seized her; she couldn't let it end like this. \"You should write that down,\" he said, gesturing vaguely with his free hand. \"The ketchup bottles. The serpent on the grill. It's good. It\u2019s real.\" In a rush of terrifying, exhilarating courage, Lucie stopped under the streetlight and clutched her bag. \"I did,\" she said, her voice shaking slightly. \"After the other night. I started writing it down.\"\n\nHe stopped and turned fully toward her. The streetlight carved his tired, intelligent face out of the darkness, illuminating the silver in his hair and the deep lines of weariness around his eyes. He looked at her, and then at the bag she was clutching as if it held the crown jewels. He understood the monumental effort of her admission. He didn't ask to see the notebook; he seemed to know that would be a violation, a step too far, too soon. The small, strange smile returned to his lips, but this time it reached his eyes, a flicker of genuine warmth in the cool gray. \"Good,\" he said, the word full of quiet approval. \"That\u2019s the most important part. Don\u2019t stop.\" He held her gaze for one more long, charged moment, a moment that felt like it contained entire volumes of unspoken conversation. Then he nodded once, a gesture of farewell and encouragement, and turned, his footsteps receding down the dark street, leaving Lucie standing alone in a halo of light, the sound of her own name echoing in the frozen air."

She was insulated by a strange, humming warmth that had settled deep in her chest, a low, constant vibration. The echo of her name, *Lucie*, spoken in his voice, was a shield against the wind. It wasn't the flat, serviceable sound she was used to, the name barked by Sal or cooed by a customer; it was a word with texture and weight, a thing of substance. She walked past the darkened storefronts, their familiar drabness washed away by the lingering glow of the streetlight where he had stood. The world hadn't changed, but her place in it had been redrawn. She wasn't just a figure in the background anymore. She was Lucie. And a man named Alistair had seen her. He had not only seen her, he had given her a command: *Don't stop*.\n\nHer basement suite no longer felt like a cell. When she shut the door behind her, the damp, familiar quiet was not oppressive but private. It was a secret workshop, a darkroom where the images she had collected could be developed. She shed her coat and boots, the chill of the outside world sloughing away, and went directly to the wobbly table. The notebook lay waiting. She opened it to a fresh page, the ballpoint pen feeling less like an alien object and more like a proper tool. Her hand was steady now. She wrote the date, and then, without hesitation, she wrote his name. *Alistair*. The letters looked as strange and elegant on the page as they had sounded in the air. Beneath it, she began to write, trying to capture the conversation not just as a transcript, but as a scene. *The space between us in the empty classroom. The smell of gin and paper. He said a poem can be a diagnosis. He said my name.* She wrote until her eyelids were heavy, until the words began to blur, her small, cramped handwriting filling the page with the evidence of her own existence.\n\nThe next day, the hiss of the grill was not a serpent, but a subject. The Gopher Hole, in the harsh light of Friday morning, was exactly as she had left it\u2014a world of beige and grease. But Lucie was no longer its prisoner. She was its anthropologist, its secret chronicler. As she poured coffee for a table of men in grease-stained coveralls discussing the price of oil, she wasn't just a waitress; she was collecting data. She noted the way their hands, calloused and scarred, cradled the thick ceramic mugs with a surprising tenderness. She heard the forced bravado in their laughter and the deep weariness underneath it. She was a spy in the house of blunt needs, and her notebook, tucked safely in her locker, was her unseen intelligence report.\n\nDuring the mid-afternoon lull, she saw Sal leaning against the stainless-steel counter by the kitchen\u2019s back door, which was propped open to the alley. A thin stream of cold air and gray light cut into the kitchen\u2019s fug. He wasn\u2019t cleaning or prepping. He was just standing there, a lit cigarette held loosely between two fingers, staring out at the rust-stained wall of the building opposite. The rock station on his radio was playing a slow, mournful ballad she didn\u2019t recognize. His shoulders, usually squared in a posture of gruff defiance, were slumped. In that moment, he wasn\u2019t Sal, the cantankerous short-order cook. He was a man of fifty-something, trapped in a life he\u2019d likely never planned, stealing a ninety-second reprieve in a bleak alleyway. The image was so stark, so full of a quiet, unarticulated sorrow, that Lucie felt an ache of recognition. It was a poem. A Robert Frost poem about a different kind of wall. She felt a desperate urge to capture it, to pin the moment to a page before it vanished. On her next break, she didn't smoke or stare blankly at her phone. She retrieved her notebook from her locker and, hiding in the relative privacy of the staff bathroom, she wrote: *Sal in the alley. The cigarette smoke and his breath making the same ghost in the cold. A whole life in one tired slump.*\n\nThat weekend, for the first time in years, Lucie did not spend her day off sleeping until noon and then dreading her next shift. Saturday morning found her walking downtown with a strange sense of purpose. She bypassed the cheap clothing stores and the dollar shops and pushed open the heavy glass doors of the Red Deer Public Library. The sudden, hushed quiet was a shock to her system, a welcome balm after the diner\u2019s constant clamor. The air smelled of aging paper, binding glue, and floor polish\u2014a cleaner, more institutional version of Alistair\u2019s scent. She felt clumsy and out of place, her worn boots squeaking softly on the polished floor. For a moment, she almost turned and fled, feeling like an imposter. But the thought of Alistair\u2019s encouraging nod propelled her forward.\n\nShe wandered through the stacks, her fingers trailing along the spines of books, the sheer volume of words, of stories and ideas, was overwhelming. She found the poetry section, a quiet, dusty aisle near a large window overlooking the city park. She found the worn copies of Keats and Frost, their pages softened by the hands of countless readers. Then, on a whim, her heart thumping a nervous rhythm against her ribs, she went to the catalogue computer. Her fingers hovered over the keyboard. It felt like an invasion of privacy, a transgression. But her curiosity was a physical hunger. She typed his name into the author search: *Finch, Alistair*. The screen blinked, processed, and then returned the stark, disappointing result: *No entries found*. A part of her was crestfallen, the romantic notion of him as a famous, hidden poet deflating instantly. But another, larger part of her felt a strange sense of relief. He wasn't a commodity to be looked up and consumed. He was just a man. A tired, sad, intelligent man who taught a night class at a community college. This made the connection between them feel more real, less like a fan\u2019s admiration and more like a meeting of two solitary people in a transient town. She turned away from the computer, not with disappointment, but with a new resolve. If she couldn't read his words, she would read the words that had shaped him. She went back to the poetry aisle and, running her hand along the spines, she chose a book not by its famous author, but by its title: *The Winged Life*. She checked it out, the librarian stamping the card with a satisfying thud, and walked out into the bright, cold afternoon with the book held tightly in her hands. It was a key she had found for herself."

                                        "text": "The book was called *The Winged Life*, and its cover was a simple, stark blue, the title embossed in plain white letters. There was no author photo, no glowing reviews, just the promise of its name. Back in the quiet of her basement suite, the world of the Gopher Hole locked out for the night, Lucie handled the book as if it were a delicate, living thing. She opened it to a random page, the crisp paper cool beneath her fingers. The poems inside were not like the grand, sweeping odes of Keats or the earthy narratives of Frost. They were short, sharp, and dense, like splinters of glass. They spoke of cracks in the pavement where weeds grew, of the flicker of a television seen through a stranger\u2019s window, of the particular sadness of a child\u2019s lost mitten on a snow-covered bench. The poet, a woman named Eleanor Vance she had never heard of, seemed to find the whole of human experience in these tiny, overlooked details. One poem, just six lines long, made Lucie read it over and over again: *The cage is not the bars, / but the forgetting of the sky. / So I study the small patch / visible from my window, / memorize its shifting moods, / and call that flight.* Lucie closed her eyes, the words echoing in the quiet room. She called that flight.\n\nThe next few days at the diner were a quiet revolution. Lucie moved through the familiar chaos, but with a new lens screwed tight over her vision. She was a student of the small patch of sky visible from her cage. The rhythmic drip of the faulty faucet in the back sink wasn\u2019t an annoyance; it was a water clock, measuring out her life in tiny, silver increments. The constellation of cigarette burns on the vinyl seat of Booth 9 wasn\u2019t just vandalism; it was a star chart of late-night anxieties and lonely conversations. Earl, the trucker with the wandering hands, came in for his usual lunch special, but Lucie no longer saw just a lecherous old man. She saw the profound loneliness in the way he stared at the salt shaker, turning it over and over in his hands as if it held an answer, his need for contact so desperate and clumsy it could only express itself as a violation. She felt not forgiveness, but a cold, clear-eyed pity that was far more unnerving. The world had not become more beautiful, but it had become infinitely more interesting, and every detail was a piece of evidence for a truth she was just beginning to understand.\n\nHer notebook became a constant companion, a place of refuge and labor. The initial fragments and observations started to coalesce into something more deliberate. She would sit on her break, the scent of bleach and onions clinging to her clothes, and struggle to find the precise word. The coffee wasn't just 'strong'; it was 'aggressively bitter', a 'liquid grudge'. The morning light didn't just 'hit' a glass of water; it 'detonated', throwing 'shrapnel of rainbow' across the table. She wrote about the young couple sharing pancakes again, but this time she tried to describe the careful geometry of their shared meal, the way his fork shielded hers. She wrote about Sal and his cigarette, trying to capture the exact shade of gray of the alley wall and the smoke and his mood. Most of what she wrote felt clumsy, overwrought, a pale imitation of the effortless clarity in *The Winged Life*. But the act of trying, of wrestling with language, was itself a kind of flight. She was no longer just letting the world happen to her; she was meeting it head-on, armed with a pen.\n\nThe hours leading up to Tuesday night\u2019s class were stretched taut with a nervous energy unlike anything she had felt before. It was no longer just about seeing him, about basking in the brief glow of his attention. It was about returning to that room as a different person. She had done the work. She had read the book, she had filled the pages of her notebook. She was coming back not as an empty vessel waiting to be filled, but as someone with her own small, fiercely-won store of knowledge. She showered with meticulous care, scrubbing the diner from her skin, and put on the same black sweater, which now felt less like her nicest thing and more like a uniform for this other, truer self. As she walked to the college, the cold air bracing, she felt a tremor of fear. What if he saw no difference? What if her insights were just sentimental nonsense after all? The thought was a cold stone in her stomach.\n\nShe slipped into the classroom and took her seat. He was there, as always, leaning against the side of his desk, nursing a cup of tea in a paper cup. He looked up as she came in, and his eyes found hers across the room. The silent acknowledgment was there again, but deeper this time, imbued with the memory of their shared walk, of her name spoken in the cold night air. It was a confirmation that the connection was not a thing she had imagined. A quiet confidence settled over her, displacing the fear. He began the class, his voice washing over the room, and on the photocopied handout was a poem she had never seen before, by William Carlos Williams. It was breathtakingly simple. *so much depends / upon / a red wheel / barrow / glazed with rain / water / beside the white / chickens.* He read it twice, then looked up, his expression patient, waiting.\n\nThe usual silence descended, thicker than ever. Brenda from accounting stared at the page as if it were a faulty invoice. Gary in the back was already breathing heavily, his eyes half-closed. The poem, with its stark simplicity, offered no obvious hooks for interpretation. \"Well?\" Alistair asked, a hint of amusement in his voice. \"Is that it? Is that a poem? Or did Williams just write down his shopping list?\" A few nervous chuckles rippled through the room. His gaze drifted, as it always did, and finally came to rest on Lucie. It was not a demand. It was an open door. He had seen the way she clutched her pen, the focused intensity on her face. He was waiting.\n\nTaking a slow, deliberate breath, Lucie heard her own voice, steady and clear, fill the quiet. \"It's about paying attention,\" she said. The entire room seemed to turn in slow motion. \"It's not about the wheelbarrow, not really. It could have been anything. It could have been a coffee cup, or a salt shaker.\" She felt a flush rise in her cheeks, but she pushed on, the words from her notebook and her heart aligning. \"So much depends on it because he *chose* to look at it. He stopped and he really saw it. The color, the texture of the rainwater, everything. The poem is the act of seeing. That\u2019s what makes it important.\" She stopped, her heart pounding, the confession of her own secret project laid bare in her analysis. The room was utterly still. She looked at Alistair. The tiredness in his face had been replaced by a look of sharp, arrested concentration. The small, sad smile was gone. In its place was a look of profound, undisguised astonishment, as if he had planted a common seed in a forgotten corner of a garden and had come back to find it had grown into a strange and exotic flower."

                                        "text": "Alistair\u2019s face, for a long, unblinking moment, was a mask of pure, unguarded surprise. The faint, weary lines around his eyes seemed to smooth out, his posture straightened, and the teacher receded, leaving only the man, utterly arrested by her words. The silence in the classroom was no longer heavy or awkward; it was electric, charged with the weight of her revelation. He blinked once, slowly, as if coming out of a trance. A strange, small smile played on his lips, but it was unlike the sad, fleeting ones she had seen before. This one was sharp with intellectual delight and something that looked almost like pride.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said, and the single word resonated in the quiet room, a low note of confirmation. He didn't look at the rest of the class, his gaze remained locked on her. \"That is it, precisely. The poem isn't the wheelbarrow. The poem is the act of attention. It is a declaration that this, this one small, ordinary thing, is worthy of being seen. It's an act of rescue. Of consecration.\" He leaned forward, his voice dropping slightly, becoming more intimate, a secret shared with her in a room full of people. \"Thank you, Lucie. That was an exceptional reading. Perfectly put.\" Then, as if remembering his duty, he reluctantly pulled his gaze away from her and addressed the blank faces of the other students, but the thread between the lectern and her desk in the third row remained, humming with an invisible current that made the air around her feel warm.\n\nThe rest of the class passed in a blur. Alistair spoke about Imagism, about precision and the rejection of sentimentality, but for Lucie, his words were just a distant soundtrack to the echoing loop of his praise. *Perfectly put.* She had done it. She had taken the chaotic, greasy details of her life, filtered them through the lens of a half-understood poem, and articulated a truth that he, a man of books and learning, had recognized as his own. When the class was dismissed, the usual shuffling of bags and scraping of chairs felt jarring, an intrusion from a different, less vibrant world. Brenda from accounting shot Lucie a look of pure, unadulterated confusion as she passed, a look that said, *Who do you think you are?* Lucie barely noticed.\n\nShe packed her bag with deliberate slowness, her hands steady. She did not feel the need to flee this time. She felt rooted, solid, a quiet confidence settling into her bones. As she knew he would, he waited until the last student had disappeared down the hall. \"Lucie,\" he said, and she turned to face him, her bag clutched in her hand not as a shield, but as an anchor. He had already packed his briefcase but was making no move to leave. \"That was more than just a good answer tonight. What you described\u2026 the act of seeing. That\u2019s the work. That\u2019s all there is, in the end.\"\n\n\"I've been practicing,\" she confessed, her voice soft but sure. \"At my job. I started writing things down.\" The admission was terrifying, but necessary. He needed to know that his words had not fallen into a void. \"I found a book at the library, too. A poet named Eleanor Vance.\"\n\nA flicker of recognition, and then a profound sadness, passed through his eyes. He knew the name. Of course he knew. He ran a hand through his untidy dark hair, the silver threads catching the light. \"Ah, Eleanor Vance,\" he said, his voice quiet. \"*The Winged Life*. She knew a thing or two about cages.\" The way he said it implied a personal connection, another piece of his own private, melancholy history. He looked at her then, with an intensity that made her feel as though he could see the scribbled pages of her notebook right through the canvas of her bag. \"You're building your own ladder, aren't you? Out of what you see.\"\n\nThe metaphor, a direct echo from Frost\u2019s poem, was so perfect, so deeply understanding, that it took her breath away. All she could do was nod. He studied her for a moment longer, a silent debate seeming to play out behind his eyes. The teacher, the sad, tired man, the intellectual\u2014all the facets of him she had glimpsed seemed to be in conversation. Finally, he came to a decision. \"I would be very interested to talk with you about what you're writing,\" he said, the words careful, deliberate. \"Not as a teacher with a student. But just as\u2026 two people who are interested in the same things. In paying attention.\" He paused, and the air grew thick with unspoken possibility. \"There's a quiet coffee shop on Little Gaetz, The Red Burl. Would you be willing to meet me there this Saturday? Around two?\"\n\nIt was not a date. It was not a lesson. It was something else entirely, a category of invitation for which Lucie had no name. It was an offer to step out of the roles they had been assigned, out of the holding pattern of her life and the weariness of his, and meet on neutral ground. The ground of poetry. The ground of paying attention. \"Yes,\" she said, her voice a reedy whisper, but her heart shouting the word. \"I'd like that very much.\"\n\n\"Good,\" he said, a genuine, unguarded smile finally breaking through the weariness. It transformed his face, making him look younger. \"Saturday, then.\" He gave her a final nod, a gesture that was no longer just one of encouragement, but one of anticipation, and then he was gone. Lucie stood alone in the empty classroom, the silence now a ringing, joyful thing. She had a destination. Saturday. For the first time in as long as she could remember, the future was not a monotonous, repeating loop of shifts at the Gopher Hole. It was a single, shining point of light, a time and a place she could walk toward. The serpent on the grill could hiss all it wanted. She was learning to fly."

The Gopher Hole was no longer a purgatory; it was a waiting room. The hiss of the grill was not a serpent but the ticking of a clock, counting down the hours. Lucie moved through the familiar chaos of the breakfast and lunch rushes with a new, serene detachment. She poured coffee, she balanced plates, she smiled her waitress-smile, but a vital part of her was held in reserve, kept clean and safe for Saturday. She was performing a role she now knew was temporary, and this knowledge lent her movements a strange, fluid grace. She was not a prisoner pacing her cell; she was a traveler with a confirmed ticket, waiting patiently for her departure. The grease, the noise, the blunt needs of the customers\u2014none of it could truly touch her.\n\nSal, from his grease-spattered kingdom behind the pass, watched her with narrowed eyes. He was accustomed to her rhythms, the subtle shifts in her posture that signaled fatigue or frustration. This new calm was foreign, unsettling. She was efficient, more so than ever, but her eyes were distant, focused on a landscape he couldn't see. On Friday, during a lull, he wiped down his stainless-steel counter and grunted in her direction. \"Something you're not tellin' me, Moreau?\" he asked, his voice a low rasp. \"You been floatin' around here for two days like you hit the lottery.\" Lucie, who was refilling salt shakers, looked up and gave him a small, genuine smile that didn't quite reach her guarded eyes. \"Just a good week, Sal,\" she said. He grunted again, unconvinced. \"Uh-huh. Looks more like you got a secret.\" He turned away, scraping the grill with a sharp, aggressive clang, as if trying to shatter her peaceful new world with the diner's harsh music. He was right. She did have a secret, and it was a language he would never understand.\n\nThe night before the meeting was a torment of quiet anxiety. In her basement suite, the silence was not a canvas but a mirror, reflecting her own insecurities back at her. She sat with her notebook open on the wobbly table, the pages filled with her cramped, earnest handwriting. She read over her descriptions of the diner, and a hot wave of shame washed over her. *'Liquid grudge.' 'Shrapnel of rainbow.'* It sounded childish, melodramatic, the work of an amateur trying on a poet\u2019s voice and finding it didn't fit. What would he think of this? He, who spoke of Keats and Frost as if they were old friends. He, whose sadness seemed so deep and authentic. She was about to show him this messy, pathetic little book, her soul\u2019s unread shelf exposed completely. The gulf between his world of quiet, scholarly dignity and her world of sticky ketchup bottles seemed impossibly wide. For a terrifying hour, she considered not going. She could call the college and leave a message, feigning sickness. She could retreat to the safety of her anonymity. But then she read the last thing she had written, after Tuesday\u2019s class: *He said my name.* It was a fact, solid and real. She closed the notebook. She would go.\n\nSaturday dawned bright and cold, the sky a vast, unforgiving blue. The day stretched before her, an expanse of empty hours leading to two o\u2019clock. She cleaned her small apartment with a frantic energy, scrubbing away the phantom grime of the Gopher Hole, trying to make her own small space worthy of the person she hoped to be when she left it. When the time came to get ready, she chose the black sweater with the care of a bride choosing her wedding dress. It was simple, anonymous, but it was a choice. It was her uniform for this other life. Her biggest struggle was with the notebook. It felt both like the most important thing she owned and a source of profound embarrassment. To bring it was an act of audacious hope; to leave it behind would be an act of cowardice. With a deep breath, she slipped it into her canvas bag, where it lay against her hip like a small, dense weight, a talisman of her own making.\n\nShe walked to the coffee shop, choosing to be early. The route took her along a quieter street than her usual path home from the diner, a stretch called Little Gaetz Avenue, lined with old brick buildings that housed small, independent businesses\u2014a bookstore, an antique shop, a law office. The Red Burl was nestled between them, its sign a simple piece of carved wood, its large front window clean and inviting. It was a world away from the Gopher Hole\u2019s buzzing neon and peeling vinyl. This was a place built for lingering, for conversation, for quiet contemplation. It was a place where a cup of coffee wasn't just fuel, but an event. Her heart hammered against her ribs as she pushed open the heavy wooden door, a small bell announcing her arrival with a gentle chime.\n\nThe air inside was warm and smelled of dark roast coffee, cinnamon, and old wood. Soft, instrumental music played from unseen speakers. And there he was. He was sitting at a small, round table in the back corner, next to a tall, leafy plant and a window that looked out onto a small, brick-paved alley. He was not reading, as she had expected. He was simply staring into his half-full mug, his shoulders slightly slumped, lost in a private thought. In the soft, natural light of the coffee shop, away from the harsh fluorescence of the classroom, the sadness she had always sensed in him was even more pronounced. He seemed terribly alone. Then he looked up, as if sensing her presence, and his eyes met hers. A slow, genuine smile spread across his face, erasing the weariness for a moment. He stood, his worn tweed jacket seeming perfectly at home among the dark wood and old brick. \"Lucie,\" he said, his voice a low, warm welcome. \"I'm so glad you came.\"\n\nThe initial few minutes were a study in gentle awkwardness. They stood in line to get her a coffee, the mundane transaction a strange interruption to the intensity that had brought them there. They spoke of the weather, of the surprising quality of the coffee. But when they sat down at the small table, the small talk evaporated, leaving a silence that was both comfortable and freighted with anticipation. Alistair cradled his mug in both hands, his long fingers looking pale against the dark ceramic. \"I\u2019ve been thinking about your comment in class,\" he began, his voice low and serious. \"About the act of seeing. It\u2019s stayed with me.\" He looked at her, his gray eyes clear and direct. \"You said you\u2019d been writing things down.\" It was not an accusation, but a gentle prompt, an opening of a door.\n\nHer hand went instinctively to her bag. This was the moment. Her throat was dry, but she met his gaze. \"It's not poetry,\" she said, the words a familiar, protective mantra. \"I told you, it\u2019s just notes. About\u2026 work. About things I see.\" He simply nodded, his expression patient, understanding. He did not ask to see it. He waited. Taking a shaky breath, Lucie pulled the thin, cheap notebook from her bag and laid it on the polished wood of the table between them. It looked small and insignificant, a child\u2019s diary. \"It's probably silly,\" she whispered, a last-ditch effort to manage his expectations. \"No,\" he said softly, his eyes on the book. \"It\u2019s not. May I?\" She swallowed and nodded, pushing it the last few inches across the table.\n\nHe opened the notebook with a reverence that stunned her. He handled it not like a teacher correcting a student\u2019s homework, but like an archivist examining a rare and delicate manuscript. His eyes scanned the first page, then the second. Lucie held her breath, watching his face for any sign of judgment or disappointment. She watched him read her description of the pancake-sharing couple, the note about the Formica galaxy, the six lines she had scribbled about Sal in the alleyway. He read for a long time, the only sound the quiet murmur of the other patrons and the soft rustle of the page as he turned it. His expression was unreadable, a mask of deep, scholarly concentration. He was not skimming. He was reading. He was paying attention.\n\nFinally, he looked up. His gray eyes were bright with an emotion she couldn't name. It was not pity. It was not mere academic interest. It was a profound, startling recognition. \"Lucie,\" he said, his voice hushed with a kind of awe. \"This is it. This is the work. 'The cigarette smoke and his breath making the same ghost in the cold.' That's not a note. That's a line of real poetry. You're not just observing things; you're feeling them. You\u2019re finding the human truth inside the detail.\" He tapped a finger on the page where she had described the diner\u2019s coffee as a 'liquid grudge.' \"This,\" he said, \"is what most writers spend their entire lives trying to learn. How to tell the truth with a single, perfect image. You're already doing it. You just don't know it yet.\""

                                        "text": "Lucie\u2019s world, which for two years had been a small, contained universe of beige and grease, suddenly tilted on its axis and expanded into an infinite, terrifying blackness studded with distant, burning stars. The quiet murmur of the coffee shop, the clink of a spoon against ceramic, the soft instrumental music\u2014it all faded into a roaring silence. The only sound was the echo of his words in her head, a repeating, seismic shockwave. *That's a line of real poetry. You're already doing it.* The praise was not a gentle pat on the head; it was a detonation. It was a validation so absolute, so unexpected, that it felt like a physical blow, knocking the air from her lungs. She stared at him, her lips parted, unable to form a response. This was the moment of exposure she had feared, but instead of mockery, she had been met with a reverence that left her utterly stripped of her defenses. She was seen. Not the waitress, not the tired girl in the worn-out hoodie. The hidden, secret self she had barely dared to acknowledge had been called out into the light, and he had pronounced it real.\n\nAlistair seemed to sense her overload. He gently closed the notebook, the cover a plain, unassuming brown, and slid it back to the center of the table. His hand rested near it, not quite touching, as if respecting the boundary of a sacred object. He leaned back in his chair, giving her space to breathe, but his eyes never left hers. \u201cIt\u2019s a rare thing, you know,\u201d he continued, his voice softer now, coaxing her back from the shock. \u201cTo have that instinct. Most people, when they start to write, they try to sound like poets. They use big words, they describe sunsets and broken hearts. They write about what they think poetry is supposed to be about. But you\u2026 you wrote about the way a man holds a salt shaker. You wrote about the sound of a faulty faucet. You\u2019re starting with the truth. That\u2019s everything.\u201d He picked up his coffee mug, a grounding, normal motion that helped tether her back to the room. He took a slow sip, his gaze still holding hers over the rim.\n\nThe roaring in her ears subsided, replaced by the frantic thrum of her own heart. She had to say something, anything, to keep from dissolving completely. She couldn\u2019t talk about her own writing anymore; the subject was too raw, too bright. She needed to turn the lens away from herself. Her mind snagged on the one thread he had offered that led away from her and towards him. \u201cEleanor Vance,\u201d she said, her voice raspy. \u201cWhen I mentioned her name, in class\u2026 you looked sad.\u201d It was a bold, terribly intimate question, and as soon as the words were out, she felt a fresh wave of panic. She was overstepping, prying into the carefully guarded melancholy she had only ever observed from a distance. She was a trespasser in the quiet country of his sadness.\n\nHe didn't flinch. He didn\u2019t deflect or demur. He simply lowered his mug to the table with a soft click and looked down into its dark surface for a moment, as if the answer were floating there. The small smile he wore was gone, replaced by the familiar, profound weariness that seemed to be his natural state. \u201cShe was my thesis advisor in grad school,\u201d he said, his voice flat, stripped of its usual poetic cadence. \u201cA long time ago. She was\u2026 brilliant. Ferocious. She saw the world with a clarity that was terrifying. She could dissect a poem, or a person, in three sentences and leave you feeling utterly exposed and completely understood all at once.\u201d He paused, his gaze distant. \u201cShe taught me how to read. Not just books. Everything.\u201d\n\nHe looked up from his mug and met Lucie\u2019s eyes, and in their gray depths, she saw not just sadness, but a deep, abiding frustration. \u201cShe wrote one perfect, small book. *The Winged Life*. And then she spent the next twenty years trying to write another one. The university, the department heads\u2026 they all wanted another book. They wanted articles, conference papers, quantifiable output. They didn't care that she had already created a flawless thing. They just wanted more product. They put her in a cage of their own making\u2014the pressure, the deadlines, the petty academic politics. They took this woman who taught us all how to see, and they made her world smaller and smaller until she couldn\u2019t see anything at all.\u201d He stopped, his jaw tight. \u201cShe stopped writing. And then, a few years after I left, she stopped everything else, too.\u201d\n\nThe unspoken end of the story hung in the warm, coffee-scented air, a ghost at their table. The quiet tragedy of it settled over Lucie, a cold weight of understanding. This was the source of his weariness, the wellspring of his sadness. He had seen firsthand what happened when the world, with its blunt and stupid demands, was allowed to grind a poet down. His praise of her notebook, his command to *not stop*, was not just casual encouragement. It was a desperate, personal plea. He was trying to save her from a fate he had already witnessed. He was seeing a ghost in her, the ghost of a brilliant woman he had once known, and he was trying to rewrite the ending. The connection between them was suddenly deeper, darker, and more complex than she could ever have imagined.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d she whispered, the words utterly inadequate. He just shook his head, a quick, dismissive gesture, as if to ward off her sympathy. \u201cIt was a long time ago. But it taught me that cages come in many forms. Some are made of grease and sticky ketchup bottles. Others are made of tweed jackets and mahogany-paneled offices.\u201d He looked directly at her, and the intensity was back, a fire banked low. \u201cThe work\u2026 the *real* work of paying attention\u2026 is the only way to keep a piece of the sky for yourself. No matter what cage you\u2019re in. That notebook,\u201d he nodded toward it, \u201cis your piece of the sky. Don't ever let anyone take it from you. And don't ever trade it for a bigger cage they promise you is a palace.\u201d\n\nHe pushed the notebook the final inch across the table until her hand, resting on the wood, could feel the corner of it. It was a transfer of responsibility, a passing of a torch. She curled her fingers around it, the cheap cardboard cover feeling more precious than anything she had ever owned. The bell over the coffee shop door chimed, and a gust of cold air briefly disturbed the warm bubble of their conversation. The moment was shifting, drawing to a close. \u201cThank you,\u201d she said, her voice full of an emotion she couldn't name. \u201cFor\u2026 all of it. For seeing it.\u201d He gave her a small, tired smile, the warmth returning to his eyes. \u201cThank you for letting me see it, Lucie.\u201d They sat in a final, shared silence, the unspoken understanding between them a solid, palpable thing. Then he glanced at his watch and the spell was broken. \u201cI have papers to grade,\u201d he said with a sigh, the weary teacher returning. \u201cA life of quantifiable output.\u201d He stood, and Lucie stood with him. \"I'll see you Tuesday,\" he said. But it wasn't a question, and it wasn't just about class. It was a promise of continuation, a confirmation that this conversation was only the beginning. He gave her one last, long look, a look that said he was entrusting her with something vital, then turned and walked out of the shop, the bell chiming his departure. Lucie stood by the table for a moment, her hand pressed flat on the cover of her notebook, and felt the unmistakable, terrifying, and exhilarating sensation of her whole life beginning to change."

                                        "text": "Lucie didn\u2019t remember the walk home. It was as if she had been lifted out of the bright, cold reality of a Red Deer afternoon and deposited on the worn welcome mat of her own front door, the key already in her hand. The intervening blocks, the traffic, the passersby\u2014all of it had been a dreamscape she had floated through, insulated from the world by the force field of his words. The cheap canvas bag felt heavy, not with the weight of the book and her notebook, but with the gravitas of the responsibility he had placed in her hands. She stepped into her basement suite and the familiar scent of damp carpet and old plumbing didn't register as bleakness, but as the smell of her own private territory, her sanctuary. She walked directly to the wobbly table and carefully placed the notebook in the center, not tossing it aside as she usually would, but arranging it with the precision of a priest placing a holy text upon an altar. She looked at its plain cover, this ten-dollar book of paper that now contained the blueprint for a new life. *Don't ever trade it for a bigger cage they promise you is a palace.* It was the most profound advice she had ever received, a map and a warning all in one.\n\nThe next day was Sunday, the diner\u2019s busiest. It was a brutal onslaught of church crowds and hungover oil-patch workers, a cacophony of crying children, clattering plates, and Sal bellowing orders like a beleaguered sergeant in a losing battle. In the past, these shifts had been a kind of torture, a physical and spiritual beatdown that left her hollowed out and aching. But today, Lucie moved through the storm with a preternatural calm. She was the quiet eye of the hurricane. The chaos couldn't touch the still, silent core of her that was holding onto the memory of a quiet coffee shop and a conversation that had remade her world. She was no longer a victim of the noise; she was its archivist. She saw the forced piety of the after-church families, the men in their too-tight Sunday shirts, the women with their exhausted eyes, and she jotted a line on her order pad: *God feels far away on a Sunday morning in a vinyl booth.* She saw a young boy methodically drowning his French fries in a puddle of ketchup, creating a small, bloody tableau on his plate, and she felt not annoyance, but a flicker of recognition for his small, desperate act of creation. The world was a text, and she was finally learning how to read it.\n\nSal watched her from his fiery pulpit, his brow furrowed in suspicion. Her unflappable serenity was unnatural. She navigated the narrow, crowded aisles with an unhurried, almost balletic grace, her diner-smile replaced by a look of distant, focused concentration. She didn\u2019t snap back when table twelve complained their eggs were too runny, she simply nodded and took the plate, her calm more unnerving to the belligerent customer than any argument would have been. During a rare moment of quiet, as she was loading the industrial dishwasher, Sal came over, wiping his greasy hands on his apron. He leaned against the metal counter, his presence blocking her path. \"Alright, Moreau,\" he said, his voice low and gravelly. \"Spill it. You joined a cult? Find Jesus? That English class of yours teachin' you how to levitate?\" The questions were sarcastic, but underneath there was a genuine, almost worried curiosity. He was testing the bounds of her new reality, trying to find a familiar foothold. Lucie simply turned, her hands dripping with rinse water, and looked at him. \"Something like that, Sal,\" she said, her voice even and quiet. \"I guess you could say I'm learning a new language.\" He stared at her for a long moment, searching for the old Lucie in her calm, clear eyes and finding no trace. He grunted, a sound of defeat and confusion, and turned back to his grill. He didn't understand her secret, but he knew enough to recognize that it had taken her somewhere he could not follow.\n\nThe rest of the day, and all of Monday, she felt the weight and power of that secret in her pocket. She had started carrying a smaller, folded notebook and a pen in the pocket of her black work pants. During a break, or in a stolen two-minute lull, she would retreat to the alley behind the diner, the same place she had seen Sal have his moment of quiet despair. The air smelled of stale beer from the overflowing dumpsters and the cold, metallic tang of the prairie winter. There, leaning against the cold brick, she would write. It was no longer just about passive observation. It was a discipline. She wrestled with the words, trying to capture the exact, grimy poetry of her surroundings. She wrote about the fragile, greasy rainbows in the dishwater, the way the ancient jukebox sang of heartbreak to a roomful of people too tired to dance, the desperate optimism of the handwritten \u201cHELP WANTED\u201d sign taped to the front door. The work was hard, frustrating. Most of the lines she wrote felt clumsy and false, and she would strike them out with a vicious slash of her pen. But the effort itself was the point. She was building her ladder, rung by painful, hard-won rung. Each successful phrase, each line that felt true, was another small piece of the sky she was claiming for herself.\n\nTuesday couldn't come soon enough. The anticipation was a constant, low-grade fever. This was no longer about a student hoping for the teacher\u2019s approval. This was a conversation between two people who knew the terrible importance of the work. She didn't want to just impress him; she wanted to bring him an offering. An artifact from her world, translated. She arrived at the college early, her heart a frantic drum against her ribs. She took her seat and pulled out her new, smaller notebook, placing it on the desk beside the official class handouts. When Alistair walked in, his eyes immediately found hers, and then flickered down to the notebook on her desk. A small, almost imperceptible nod of acknowledgment passed between them. He had seen. He understood. The class began, the topic was Emily Dickinson. He read from one of her poems, his voice giving the strange, spiky verses their full, disquieting power. *\"I measure every Grief I meet / With narrow, probing, Eyes - / I wonder if It weighs like Mine - / Or has an Easier size.\"* He looked up from the page, his gaze sweeping the room before landing, inevitably, on her. \"What is she doing here?\" he asked the class, but the question was only for Lucie. \"Why this need to measure, to compare?\" The question hung in the air, a direct query into the work they had discussed on Saturday. He was asking her to explain their shared secret to a room full of strangers."

Lucie felt their gazes, a dozen pinpricks of confusion and indifference, but they were a distant irritation, like static from a radio in another room. Her entire universe had contracted to the space between her desk and the lectern. She looked at Alistair, and saw not a teacher waiting for an answer, but a fellow cartographer asking her to describe a shared, secret map. She took a slow breath, the air tasting of chalk dust and old paper, and the words came, not from her intellect, but from a deeper place, the place where she had stored the images of the past week.\n\n\"She's not just comparing,\" Lucie said, her voice quiet but carrying in the stillness. \"She's trying to survive. When you\u2019re surrounded by grief, by a world that doesn\u2019t make sense, you start to feel like you\u2019re the only one. Like your sadness is a freakish, heavy thing that no one else could possibly understand.\" Her gaze flickered to Brenda from accounting, who was frowning at her pen as if it had personally offended her. \"But if you measure, if you look at the person next to you with those \u2018narrow, probing, Eyes,\u2019 you start to see it everywhere. You see it in the way a man holds his coffee cup when he thinks no one is watching. You see it in the slump of a cook\u2019s shoulders in an alleyway. You see it even in the people you don\u2019t like.\" She thought of Earl and his clumsy, pathetic loneliness. \"And when you see it, you realize your grief isn't a solitary confinement. It's a shared language. It might not make it lighter, but it gives it an \u2018Easier size.\u2019 It makes it something you can carry, because you know you\u2019re not carrying it alone.\"\n\nWhen she finished, the silence that followed was different. It was no longer empty; it was dense with the meaning of her words, even if only one other person in the room could fully decipher them. Gary snorted softly in his sleep in the back row. Brenda shook her head slightly, a gesture of complete bewilderment. But Alistair\u2026 Alistair simply stood there, his hands resting on the open book. He didn\u2019t offer praise. He didn\u2019t say, \"Thank you, Miss Moreau.\" He just held her gaze, and in his eyes was a look of such profound, startling kinship that it was more intimate than any touch. It was a look that said, *I know exactly the alleyway you mean. I have measured that grief myself.* After a long, suspended moment, he cleared his throat and continued the lesson, his voice a little rougher than before, but the connection between them remained, a brilliant, invisible thread woven through the dry fabric of the class.\n\nThe walk after class had become a silent, mutual assumption. They fell into step in the quiet hallway, the familiar rhythm of their footsteps the only sound between them. The night was sharp and cold, the stars hard and bright in the black sky. They walked without speaking for several blocks, the shared comfort of the silence a testament to how far they had come from their first, awkward encounter. The space between them was no longer filled with questions and uncertainties, but with a deep, resonant understanding. As they approached the corner where their paths diverged, the corner that had become a kind of informal landmark in Lucie\u2019s new life, she knew she had to do more than just talk. The conversation had to become tangible. Her heart began to beat a hard, frantic rhythm against her ribs.\n\n\"Wait,\" she said, her voice small in the vast, cold quiet. He stopped and turned to her, his breath a white plume in the streetlight\u2019s glow. Her hand trembled as she reached into the pocket of her coat, bypassing the bag with its larger, more intimidating notebook. She pulled out the small, folded pad she now carried with her everywhere. It was dog-eared and smudged with diner grease. \"I, uh\u2026 I wrote something,\" she stammered, feeling a fresh wave of paralyzing vulnerability. \"It\u2019s not for class. It\u2019s just\u2026 from the alley.\" With shaking fingers, she tore a single page from the spiral binding. The sound of the paper ripping was violently loud in the stillness. She held it out to him, a small, wrinkled offering. \"You said not to trade my piece of the sky,\" she whispered. \"This is a little piece of it. For Eleanor.\"\n\nHe looked from her face to the small, folded piece of paper she was holding out to him. He didn't move for a moment, as if he understood the immense weight of the gesture. Then, with infinite care, he reached out and took it from her, his fingers brushing hers. The brief touch was a jolt of warmth against the cold. He didn\u2019t put it in his pocket for later. He unfolded it right there, under the orange halo of the streetlight, and held it up to read. Lucie watched his eyes move across her cramped handwriting, her soul laid bare on a flimsy, grease-stained sheet. She had written down the lines about Sal. *Sal in the alley. The cigarette smoke and his breath making the same ghost in the cold. A whole life in one tired slump. He looks at the wall like it\u2019s a mirror he\u2019s afraid to look into.* Alistair read it once, and then again. He lowered the paper, his face a mask of quiet, profound emotion. He looked at her, and the sadness in his eyes was mingled with a fierce, burning light.\n\n\"This is not a little piece, Lucie,\" he said, his voice thick with feeling. \"This is the whole thing. The whole world. This is what she was trying to teach us.\" He carefully folded the page and slipped it into the inside pocket of his tweed jacket, placing it over his heart as if it were a precious photograph. \"This is the most valuable thing I have been given in a very long time.\" The sincerity of his words was absolute, a foundational truth that settled deep into Lucie\u2019s bones, reinforcing everything that had shifted within her. He stood there for a moment longer, looking at her as if she were a miracle he was struggling to comprehend. \"Don't stop,\" he said again, but this time it wasn't a command. It was a plea from one survivor to another. \"Whatever you do, don't you ever stop.\" He gave a final, sharp nod, a gesture of profound respect, and then he turned and walked away into the darkness, leaving Lucie standing alone on the corner, the cold air on her face a stark contrast to the brilliant, blazing warmth that was spreading through her entire being. She was not just a poet. She was a poet with a reader."

                                        "text": "The world did not dissolve into a blur on the walk home. On the contrary, for the first time, it snapped into hyper-focus. Lucie felt the biting cold on her cheeks not as an assault, but as a clarifying sensation, a sharp reminder that she was alive and present in this one, specific moment. The sodium streetlights didn't cast a sickly orange glow; they were beacons, each one illuminating a small stage on which the quiet dramas of the night unfolded. She saw the frost creeping in intricate, feathery patterns across a parked car's windshield and recognized it as a form of writing. She heard the low hum of a city settling into sleep and understood it as a kind of hushed, collective breathing. She was no longer just an observer; she felt like a collaborator, a part of the world\u2019s quiet, constant poetry. He had taken her small, smudged piece of paper and placed it over his heart. The gesture was a coronation. In the kingdom of one, in the quiet republic of his esteem, she was not just a poet. She was a poet whose work was valued, cherished, and protected.\n\nWhen she reached her basement suite, the space felt different. The familiar dampness in the air was the cool atmosphere of a grotto, a secret, subterranean place for creation. The single high window, usually a sad reminder of her submerged existence, now seemed like a strategic vantage point, a periscope through which she could observe the world above. She didn't turn on the television or even her small lamp. She sat in the darkness, the faint light from the street filtering in, and let the feeling of the night settle into her. He had called her offering \"the whole world.\" He had held it as if it were precious. He had connected it to Eleanor. He had made her part of a lineage, a secret society of people who paid attention. The weight of this new identity was immense, but it was not a burden. It was ballast, giving her a new and profound sense of gravity, of purpose. She was no longer just Lucie Moreau, a waitress drifting through life. She was the person who wrote the poem that was now folded in Alistair Finch's pocket.\n\nThe next few days at the Gopher Hole were an exercise in dual existence. On the surface, she was the same efficient waitress, moving with an economy of motion, refilling coffees, and calling out orders. But underneath, a revolution was taking place. She felt an almost tender pity for the world around her, for the blunt, unexamined lives that played out in the vinyl booths. She saw Earl come in and order his trucker\u2019s special, and instead of steeling herself for his inevitable leering, she watched the way his hands, thick and clumsy, fumbled with the small packets of sugar, and she felt a wave of crushing sadness for his inability to connect in any way that was not a trespass. The anger she had once felt was gone, replaced by the cold, clear insight of a diagnosis. Her notebook entries changed. She was no longer just capturing images; she was trying to understand the mechanics of the cage. She wrote about the desperate cheerfulness of the jukebox, the way it played songs of love and freedom into a room thick with exhaustion and quiet resignation. She wrote about the thinness of the walls, both literal and metaphorical, between the lives crammed into the diner.\n\nHer calm was a strange, unreadable force in the diner\u2019s ecosystem. Customers who tried to bully her found their anger deflating against the soft, unyielding surface of her serenity. Sal continued to watch her, his suspicion morphing into a kind of grudging respect. He saw that whatever secret she was holding was making her better at her job\u2014more focused, more resilient, untouchable. He stopped his probing questions and instead would occasionally leave a perfectly cooked steak on the pass for her at the end of a long shift, a gesture he would never acknowledge, his own gruff, unspoken form of measurement. He didn't know what her grief was, or her joy, but he could see that it had a weight and a size, and he had decided it was something to be respected.\n\nThe anticipation for their next meeting was a quiet, steady flame. It was no longer fraught with the anxiety of seeking approval. Now, it felt like a necessary communion, a return to her home country. On Tuesday, she walked into the classroom feeling not like a student, but like an equal. She took her seat, her heart beating a calm, steady rhythm. When Alistair entered, his eyes found hers instantly, a silent acknowledgment that passed between them like a warm current. He looked subtly different. The deep lines of weariness around his eyes seemed a fraction softer, the slump in his shoulders a little less pronounced. It was as if the small piece of her sky she had given him had let a little light into his own world. He began the class, the topic for the night a selection of modern love poems. As he read a particularly raw and honest piece by a contemporary poet, Lucie felt the words not as an academic exercise, but as a continuation of the conversation she and Alistair were having with the world, and with each other.\n\nThe walk after class was steeped in a new, comfortable intimacy. The silence between them was no longer a space to be filled, but a shared territory they inhabited together. As they walked through the cold, quiet streets, he finally spoke, his voice low and thoughtful. \u201cI\u2019ve read your poem a hundred times,\u201d he said, not looking at her, but staring ahead at the dark ribbon of the street. \u201cIt\u2019s sitting on my desk. It makes the stacks of ungraded essays seem\u2026 less significant.\u201d He glanced at her, a quick, almost shy look. \u201cIt reminds me what the point of all this is. The point of the words.\u201d He paused as they reached their corner, the familiar streetlight casting its amber glow. \u201cI was wondering, Lucie. What do you want? Beyond the Gopher Hole. When you think of the future, what do you see?\u201d\n\nThe question was direct, practical, and terrifying. It demanded that she look beyond the next shift, the next paycheck, the next class. It assumed she had a future to envision. Her mind, for so long focused only on the granular details of the present, went blank. She thought of her holding pattern, of the purgatory of ketchup bottles, and for the first time, she truly believed it was a temporary state. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she confessed, her voice barely a whisper. \u201cA year ago, I wouldn\u2019t have even known how to answer that. I just thought\u2026 this was it.\u201d She looked up at him, her face earnest in the dim light. \u201cNow, I just know that I want to keep doing this. The writing. I want to get better at it. I want to build the ladder, like you said.\u201d\n\nAlistair nodded, a slow, thoughtful gesture. He seemed to be weighing his next words with immense care. \"Getting better requires two things,\" he said. \"Practice, which you are doing with a ferocious honesty that reminds me very much of Eleanor. And it requires community. It requires being in conversation with other people who are doing the same work.\" He reached into his briefcase and pulled out a thin, folded flyer. \"There\u2019s a small literary festival in Edmonton next month. A Saturday. It\u2019s not a big, fancy affair. It\u2019s just writers and readers, crammed into a few rooms at the university. There are readings, panel discussions. A lot of bad coffee.\u201d He offered the flyer to her. \u201cI\u2019m driving up for the day. I have an extra seat in my car. I thought\u2026 if you were interested\u2026 you could see what that world looks like. You could listen. You could measure.\u201d\n\nLucie took the flyer, her fingers numb with cold and shock. An entire day. A trip out of Red Deer. A festival of writers. It was an invitation not just into his car, but into his world. It was a door swinging open, revealing a room she had never known existed, a room she was now being personally invited to enter. It was the next, unimaginable rung on the ladder, and he was holding it steady for her. \u201cYes,\u201d she breathed, the word a plume of white in the frozen air, absolute and immediate. \u201cYes, I would be very interested.\u201d A broad, unguarded smile broke across his face, a smile of pure, unadulterated delight. It was the first time she had ever seen him look truly happy. \u201cGood,\u201d he said, the single word brimming with promise. \u201cIt\u2019s a long drive. We\u2019ll have time to talk.\u201d"

                                        "text": "The weeks leading up to the literary festival were a fever dream of anticipation. The trip to Edmonton became a fixed point in Lucie\u2019s future, a brilliant, blazing sun around which the dull planets of her workdays revolved. Time, which had once been a thick, slow-moving river of grease, now had a current, a direction. Every shift she worked was one less shift standing between her and that Saturday. The Gopher Hole, with its endless, grinding demands, became a training ground. She was an athlete preparing for a marathon, and every plate she carried, every coffee she poured, was strengthening her for the long journey ahead. She felt a strange, detached fondness for the place. It was her subject, her muse, the source of the raw material she was learning to transmute. She was no longer drowning in it; she was mining it for gold.\n\nHer notebook became her most treasured and most terrifying possession. She filled its pages with a frantic energy, a desperate need to have something to show, to prove that she was worthy of the seat in his car. She wrote about the way the winter sun, low and weak, would strike the chrome napkin dispensers, creating a brief, blinding flash of painful beauty. She wrote about the vocabulary of sighs she heard from the lonely men at the counter, each one a different dialect of despair. But as the day of the festival approached, a paralyzing self-doubt began to creep in. She would read her lines and the raw honesty she had been so proud of would curdle into what she feared was sentimental foolishness. Who was she to be riding in a car with Alistair Finch, to be walking into a festival of real writers? She was a waitress who smelled of onions, with chapped hands and a high school diploma. The black sweater she had worn to their meetings, her one good thing, now seemed hopelessly inadequate, a pathetic costume that would instantly betray her as an imposter.\n\nThe night before the trip, she didn\u2019t sleep. She sat on the edge of her lumpy futon in the dark, the Eleanor Vance book open but unread on her lap. The fear was a cold, heavy knot in her stomach. It would be so easy to call in sick to this new life, to retreat to the grim, predictable comfort of the Gopher Hole. But then she remembered the look on Alistair\u2019s face when he had taken her small, grease-stained poem. He had seen something real. He had seen not an imposter, but a peer. The memory was an anchor in the swirling sea of her anxiety. She was not going to this festival to prove she was a writer. She was going because he already believed she was one. The thought did not banish the fear, but it gave her the courage to face it. She stood up, turned on the light, and with a steady hand, packed her canvas bag, placing her notebook inside with the care of someone packing their only valid passport.\n\nShe was waiting on the curb in the pre-dawn darkness when the headlights of his car cut through the gloom, illuminating the street of identical, sleeping bungalows. The car was an older, dark green sedan, sensible and unassuming, much like the man himself. He pulled up and leaned over to push open the passenger door for her, the small gesture of courtesy feeling incredibly gallant in the cold, dark morning. The interior of the car was a revelation. It was tidy, but lived-in, and it smelled exactly as she knew it would: a rich, comforting blend of old paper, leather from the worn seats, and the faint, clean scent of winter that clung to him like a second skin. A small, precarious stack of books was wedged between the back seat and the door. \"Morning, Lucie,\" he said, his voice a low, warm rumble in the quiet of the car. He was wearing a dark grey woolen coat over a simple sweater, his tweed jacket left behind. He looked less like a professor and more like a man on a journey, and the sight of him, so calm and solid in the driver's seat, settled the frantic fluttering in her chest.\n\nAs they drove out of Red Deer, leaving the familiar, sleeping city behind, a comfortable silence settled between them. The prairie landscape unfolded around them, a vast, monochromatic expanse of snow-covered fields under a sky that was slowly bruising from black to a deep, pearlescent purple. The rhythmic thump of the tires on the highway was a peaceful, meditative sound. After a time, he broke the silence, his question gentle. \"Are you nervous?\" Lucie looked at her own hands, clasped tightly in her lap. \"Terrified,\" she admitted, the confession a relief. He nodded, his eyes on the road. \"Good,\" he said, and she looked at him in surprise. \"It means you understand what's at stake. The day you walk into a room full of poets and you're not at least a little bit terrified is the day you've lost the plot.\" He glanced at her, a small, reassuring smile on his lips. \"The secret is that they are all just as terrified as you are. They're just better at hiding it.\"\n\nThe long drive unspooled before them, and with it, the conversation. They moved beyond the safe territory of poetry and into the uncharted landscape of their own lives. He asked her about her family, and for the first time, she spoke of it plainly, without shame or bitterness. She told him about her well-meaning parents who wanted her to have a sensible, secure life as a dental hygienist, about their complete inability to understand the hungry, restless part of her that felt starved by the idea of such a safe, small existence. She spoke of the string of dead-end jobs and a failed relationship, not as a list of failures, but as the geography of the holding pattern she was finally escaping. He listened with that same profound, quiet attention he brought to a poem, his occasional, insightful questions making her feel not judged, but deeply and completely heard.\n\nHe, in turn, offered small, carefully chosen pieces of his own story. He spoke of growing up in a small town in the Maritimes, a bookish, quiet boy who felt perpetually out of sync with the world around him. He talked about his own escape, first to university, and then into the rarefied, often suffocating world of academia. He never mentioned Eleanor Vance by name again, but Lucie could hear her ghost in the way he spoke of his early, passionate belief in the power of literature, and the slow, grinding disillusionment that had followed. He was not just the sad, tired professor anymore. He was Alistair, a man who had fought his own battles and bore his own scars, a man who had almost forgotten what the point of it all was until a waitress in his night class had reminded him by talking about a Grecian urn. The car became a confessional, a sanctuary moving at one hundred kilometers an hour, and with every mile they traveled, the distance between their two disparate worlds shrank until it was barely there at all.\n\nAs they approached the outskirts of Edmonton, the flat, empty prairie gave way to the sprawling geometry of the city. Buildings rose up to meet the sky, a vertical landscape that was a stark contrast to the horizontal world Lucie knew. The sheer scale of it, the endless streams of cars, the anonymous rush of people, was both exhilarating and overwhelming. Alistair navigated the unfamiliar streets with a quiet confidence, his hands resting easily on the wheel. \"We're almost there,\" he said, sensing her quiet awe. \"The university is like a city within the city. You'll see.\" He drove them onto a sprawling campus of old stone buildings and modern glass structures, a place that hummed with a purpose and energy that was entirely foreign to her. He found a parking spot in a crowded lot, the other cars seeming to disgorge people who all looked exactly as he had described: bundled in scarves, clutching tote bags filled with books, their faces alight with conversation and purpose. They were a tribe, and she was an outsider. He turned off the engine, and the sudden silence in the car was immense.\n\nHe turned to her, his expression serious, his gray eyes searching hers. \"Ready?\" he asked. The terror she had felt earlier returned with a vengeance, a cold wave that threatened to drown her. This was it. The moment of truth. She was about to step out of the safety of his car and into a world where she did not belong, where her notebook and her chapped hands would surely betray her. She could only manage a small, jerky nod. He seemed to understand completely. He reached over, not to touch her, but just to tap a finger lightly on the canvas of her bag, where her notebook rested. \"Just remember,\" he said, his voice a low, steady anchor. \"You have as much right to be here as any of them. You're doing the work. Now, let's go listen.\""

The interior of the car was a known world, a bubble of quiet understanding that smelled of paper and him. Outside was the vast, unknowable territory of the festival, populated by the very people she was trying to become and whose judgment she feared most. It was one thing to be a poet in the secret workshop of her basement suite, or in the rarefied audience of one that was Alistair. It was another thing entirely to step out into the cold, bright light and risk being seen by the professionals. Taking a deep, shaky breath that did little to calm the frantic hummingbird of her heart, she pushed the door open. The air that rushed in was frigid and sharp, a slap of reality. She stepped out onto the gritty, snow-dusted asphalt, the solid ground feeling precarious beneath her feet, and shut the door behind her, the sound a final, definitive click. The sanctuary was gone.\n\nThey walked together across the sprawling parking lot towards a large, imposing building of old grey stone, its arched windows looking down like thoughtful, ancient eyes. The people flowing around them all seemed to move with a similar purpose, their heads bent together in intense conversation, their laughter sharp and intelligent on the cold air. Lucie clutched the strap of her canvas bag, the corner of her notebook a hard, reassuring pressure against her hip. She felt utterly transparent, convinced that everyone could see the Gopher Hole clinging to her like a second skin, that her worn boots and plain black sweater marked her as a tourist in a land of natives. Alistair walked beside her, his long, easy strides a stark contrast to her own stiff, nervous steps. He seemed entirely unperturbed by the bustling scene, navigating it with the quiet confidence of a man returning to his home country after a long time away. He glanced at her, sensing her tension, and gave a slight, almost imperceptible nod towards a group of people laughing loudly near the entrance. \u201cPoets,\u201d he murmured, his voice laced with a dry amusement. \u201cThey\u2019re a dramatic bunch. Try not to let them intimidate you. Their bark is almost always worse than their bite.\u201d\n\nThe entrance hall was a warm, overwhelming cacophony of sound and motion. The air was thick with the competing smells of brewing coffee, damp wool, and the dry, papery scent of thousands of books. People were everywhere\u2014milling around tables piled high with literary journals and slender volumes of poetry, clustering in tight, animated groups, checking their programs with furrowed brows. It was a hive, and Lucie felt like a clumsy, bewildered bee from a different colony. Alistair guided her through the throng with a gentle hand on the small of her back, a brief, grounding touch that kept her from being swept away by the current of bodies. They made their way to a large board where the day's schedule was posted. His long finger traced down the list of events. \u201cThere\u2019s a reading in Room 204 that might be a good place to start,\u201d he said. \u201cA new voice. Supposedly very\u2026 deconstructionist.\u201d He said the last word with an inflection that made it clear he was not endorsing it. \u201cLet\u2019s go be deconstructed.\u201d\n\nThey found the room, slipping into two seats near the back just as the reading was beginning. The room was stuffy and overheated, packed with people leaning forward in their chairs with expressions of intense concentration. The poet on stage was a young man with a severe haircut and black-rimmed glasses, who read from a tablet in a flat, affected monotone. His poems were a dense thicket of academic theory and fragmented, disjointed images. They were clever, Lucie could sense that, but they were also cold and airless, with no blood or heart in them. She listened, her brow furrowed, trying to find a way in, a single image she could hold onto, but the words skittered off the surface of her understanding, leaving no trace. A familiar, sinking feeling began to set in. This was it. This was the secret language, the high intellectual art form she could never hope to master. This was real poetry, and her own small, simple observations about coffee cups and tired cooks were the pathetic scribbles of a child.\n\nAs the young man finished a particularly obtuse poem about the semiotics of a barcode, Alistair leaned towards her, his voice a barely audible whisper against her ear. \u201cHe\u2019s terrified of being understood,\u201d he murmured. \u201cHe thinks if people understand him, they\u2019ll realize he has nothing to say.\u201d The comment was a lifeline thrown to her in the middle of a vast, confusing sea. It wasn\u2019t that she was too simple to understand the poem; it was that the poem itself was a fortress, designed to keep people out. The realization was a quiet, thrilling revelation. She had a right to her own judgment. She had a right to expect a poem to offer a human connection, not a puzzle box with no key. When the reading ended to a smattering of polite, intellectual applause, she felt not defeated, but strangely validated, as if she had passed a secret test. She and Alistair shared a quick, conspiratorial glance, a silent agreement that was more meaningful than any of the applause in the room.\n\nThey emerged back into the crowded hallway, the brief respite of the reading room over. The energy of the crowd seemed to have intensified. As they navigated their way towards the main hall, a woman with a sleek, architectural haircut and a brightly colored scarf materialized in front of them. \u201cAlistair Finch, you hermit! I thought you\u2019d fallen off the face of the earth,\u201d she said, her voice loud and theatrical. Alistair\u2019s polite smile seemed to tighten at the edges. \u201cHello, Catherine,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve just been busy.\u201d Catherine\u2019s sharp, intelligent eyes flicked from Alistair to Lucie, taking in her plain sweater and nervous posture in a single, swift, and dismissive glance. \u201cAnd you are?\u201d she asked, the question less an inquiry and more a demand for Lucie to justify her presence at Alistair\u2019s side. The moment stretched, and Lucie\u2019s blood ran cold. This was it. He would say \u2018my student,\u2019 or \u2018a friend,\u2019 and she would be neatly categorized and put aside. But Alistair didn\u2019t hesitate. He met Catherine\u2019s gaze directly, his expression unreadable. \u201cThis is Lucie Moreau,\u201d he said, his voice clear and steady. \u201cShe\u2019s a writer from Red Deer.\u201d\n\nThe words hit Lucie with the force of a physical impact. *A writer.* He had said it. He had spoken the secret name she barely dared to whisper to herself, spoken it aloud in this temple of literature, to this high priestess of the tribe. The world seemed to tilt and then resettle on a new, more solid foundation. For a breathless moment, she was no longer a waitress playing dress-up. She was Lucie Moreau, a writer from Red Deer. The title, bestowed by him, felt like a cloak of legitimacy, an armor against the judging eyes of the world. Catherine\u2019s perfectly plucked eyebrows rose a fraction of an inch, her gaze flickering back to Lucie with a renewed, if still skeptical, interest. \u201cOh?\u201d she said, the single syllable dripping with a world of meaning. \u201cHow fascinating.\u201d She clearly didn\u2019t believe it, but the claim had been made, the territory marked. She turned her attention back to Alistair, launching into a stream of literary gossip, but Lucie was no longer listening. She was standing slightly outside their circle, invisible again, but it didn't matter. Inside, where no one could see, she was glowing.\n\nAfter they had extricated themselves from Catherine, Alistair guided them to another reading. The atmosphere in this second room was entirely different. It was smaller, less crowded, and filled with a quiet, respectful attention. The reader was an older woman with a kind, deeply lined face and a quiet, unassuming presence. She wore a simple dress and comfortable-looking shoes, and when she began to read, her voice was low and clear, without a trace of artifice. Her poems were about her garden, about the memory of her mother\u2019s hands, about the particular quality of light in a hospital room, about the surprising weight of a small, sleeping bird that had flown into her house. They were poems built of the same raw material Lucie was mining from her own life: the profound, heartbreaking beauty hidden in the ordinary. Every word was a revelation, a confirmation. This was the work. This was the truth. It was the language of Eleanor Vance, and it was the language Lucie was trying to learn. As the woman read a poem about finding a single, perfect seashell in the pocket of a dead man\u2019s coat, Lucie felt an ache of recognition so deep it was almost painful. Her hand, of its own accord, slipped into her bag and found the hard spine of her notebook, her fingers tracing the familiar edges. She looked over at Alistair. He was already watching her, a soft, knowing smile on his face, his grey eyes full of a shared, quiet joy. He had brought her here not to be deconstructed, but to be found. He had brought her home."

It was a warm, rolling wave of genuine appreciation, a collective exhalation of a room full of people who had been held, rapt, by the quiet power of her words. Lucie found herself clapping until her palms stung, a hot, grateful sting. She felt tears pricking at the corners of her eyes, a startling overflow of emotion she hadn't anticipated. It was the feeling of profound recognition, of having a deep, unarticulated part of herself spoken back to her in a language she was only just learning she knew. She wasn\u2019t being deconstructed; she was being reassembled, put together in a way that felt truer and more solid than before. She felt a deep, fierce kinship with the quiet woman on the stage, a woman who had taken the small, domestic sorrows and joys of a life and held them up to the light until they became universal, until they became art. This, Lucie knew with a certainty that settled deep in her bones, was the work. This was the sky.\n\nWhen they shuffled out of the room and back into the bustling hallway, the noise of the festival seemed less chaotic. It was just the sound of a thousand different conversations about the thing that mattered most. Alistair was quiet for a long moment, a contemplative look on his face. \u201cMarion Croft,\u201d he said, his voice soft with a kind of reverence. \u201cShe\u2019s the real thing. No fortress, no affectation. Just a direct line to the human heart.\u201d He looked at Lucie, and his gray eyes were bright with the shared understanding. \u201cThat\u2019s a lesson that takes most people a lifetime to learn. Some never do.\u201d His words felt like a quiet consecration of the moment they had just shared. He had brought her here to see this, to know that her own instincts, her own leanings toward the simple, resonant truth of the everyday, were not a sign of naivety, but the very essence of the craft. She was not on the wrong path; she was, impossibly, already on the right one.\n\nHe suggested they wander through the bookfair, a sprawling affair set up in the university's grand central hall. The sheer volume of books was intoxicating, a physical manifestation of the world of words she had only ever glimpsed. Tables were piled high with books of every shape and size, their covers a riot of color and design, their titles whispering promises of other worlds, other lives. The air smelled thick and rich with paper and ink. Alistair watched her as she drifted from table to table, her fingers trailing reverently over the spines, her eyes wide with a hungry, unjaded wonder. He saw her pick up a slim volume, open it, and become so lost in a single page that the noisy room around her seemed to fade away. For him, a man who had grown weary of this world, who had seen its vanities and its pettiness up close, watching Lucie discover it for the first time was like drinking cool, clean water after years of thirst. He was not just her guide; she was his, reminding him of the magic he had long ago begun to take for granted.\n\nAs they rounded a corner, Lucie\u2019s heart gave a sudden, sharp jolt. There, sitting at a small, unassuming table with a modest stack of her books, was Marion Croft. She was signing a book for a young woman, her head bent, her kind, lined face softened by a gentle smile. There was no theatricality about her, no air of importance. She looked like someone\u2019s grandmother, a woman you might sit next to on a bus, and yet she held entire worlds in her head. Alistair followed Lucie\u2019s gaze and understood at once. \"You should get one,\" he said, his voice a gentle nudge. \"You should have her sign it for you.\" The terror was immediate and paralyzing. The idea of approaching this woman, of speaking to her, felt like an impossible transgression. \"I can't,\" Lucie whispered, her throat closing up. \"What would I even say?\" Alistair looked at her, his expression patient and kind. \"You don't have to say anything profound,\" he said. \"You're a writer. Go meet another writer. Buy her book. It's how we keep each other going.\"\n\nPropelled by his words and a surge of desperate courage, Lucie found herself moving forward, her legs feeling unsteady beneath her. She joined the short, quiet line, her heart hammering a frantic rhythm against her ribs. She picked up a copy of the book, the same one Marion Croft had been reading from, its cover a simple illustration of a bird in flight. The paper felt cool and vital in her trembling hands. When it was her turn, she stepped forward and placed the book on the table, unable to meet the older woman\u2019s eyes. \"Did you enjoy the reading, dear?\" Marion Croft asked, her voice as warm and clear as it had been on stage. Lucie could only manage a choked nod, her gaze fixed on the woman\u2019s hands, the skin wrinkled and dotted with age spots, hands that had gardened and cooked and written these poems that had cracked her own heart open. \"And who should I make it out to?\" the poet asked. Lucie finally looked up, meeting the woman's clear, intelligent eyes. \"To Lucie,\" she whispered. Marion Croft smiled, a genuine, crinkling smile that reached her eyes, and in a steady, elegant script, she wrote, *For Lucie, May you always find the birds.* She slid the book back across the table. \"Thank you for listening so closely,\" she said, as if she had seen Lucie in the back row, had felt the intensity of her attention. Stunned into silence, Lucie clutched the book to her chest like a holy relic and retreated, her mind reeling.\n\nThe drive home was a descent from the stratosphere. The sun was setting, slanting low across the snow-covered fields and painting the vast prairie sky in impossible shades of rose and gold and violet. The car was filled with a quiet, contemplative peace. The frenzy of the festival was behind them, and now there was only the steady hum of the engine and the immense, beautiful emptiness of the landscape. They didn't speak for a long time, each lost in the day's reverberations. Lucie held the signed book in her lap, her thumb stroking the embossed title. *May you always find the birds.* It wasn\u2019t a platitude; it was a blessing, a passing of the torch. It was permission. Finally, Alistair spoke, his voice thoughtful. \u201cIt\u2019s a strange thing,\u201d he said. \u201cYou spend so much time in that world, you start to forget that a voice like Marion Croft\u2019s is the exception, not the rule. You get bogged down in the politics and the posturing, the Catherines of the world. You forget that the whole point is to just tell the truth as beautifully as you can.\u201d He glanced over at her, his profile outlined against the dying light. \u201cThank you for reminding me of that today, Lucie.\u201d\n\nHis gratitude was a disarming, humbling thing. It cemented the shift that had been happening between them all day, leveling the ground until there was no longer a teacher and a student, but two travelers who had found each other on the same road. \"What happens now?\" she asked, the question not about the next class, but about the rest of her life. The future, which had once been a terrifying blank, now seemed like a landscape of possibility, and she needed a map. \"Now,\" he said, \"you keep doing the work. You fill that notebook, and then you fill another one. And when you have a handful of poems that feel true, that feel like they can stand on their own, you send them out.\" He said it so simply, as if it were the most natural thing in the world. \"There are journals, the kind you saw today. Little magazines that are hungry for real voices. I can make you a list.\" He was giving her a practical, concrete plan, a set of instructions for building her own wings. The idea of sending her work out, of having it judged by faceless editors, was terrifying, but it was no longer impossible.\n\nBy the time they reached the familiar streets of Red Deer, the sky was a deep, star-dusted indigo. The city seemed smaller, quieter, a town she was returning to from a foreign country. When he pulled up in front of her bungalow, he didn't just push the door open. He turned off the engine, plunging them into a final, intimate silence. \u201cLucie,\u201d he said, turning to face her in the darkness, \u201ctoday was important. Not just for you. For me, too.\u201d In the dim light from the dashboard, she could see the earnestness in his face, the profound sincerity in his tired gray eyes. The professional distance was gone, replaced by a raw, human connection that was more powerful than anything she had ever known. \"Thank you for letting me see the world through your eyes today,\" he said. \"It was a gift.\" Unable to speak past the lump in her throat, she simply nodded, her heart full to bursting. She gathered her bag, her hand closing around the precious, signed book, and stepped out of the car. He waited until she had unlocked her door and was safely inside before starting the engine and driving away, his headlights sweeping across her window and then disappearing into the night.\n\nLucie stood in the middle of her small, dark room, the silence ringing in her ears. She could still feel the hum of the car, still smell the faint scent of old paper and coffee. She walked to her table and switched on the single lamp, its yellow light filling the room. With deliberate care, she placed Marion Croft's book on the table. Then she took out her own grease-stained, dog-eared notebook and placed it right beside it. They didn't look like they belonged to two different worlds. They looked like they were part of the same story, a beginning and a continuation. The inscription echoed in her mind: *May you always find the birds.* The hiss of the grill, the clatter of plates, the loneliness of the vinyl booths\u2014they were not a cage. They were a landscape. And it was teeming with birds. She opened her notebook to the next blank page, uncapped her pen, and with a hand that did not tremble, she began to write."

                                        "text": "The Monday morning after the festival was a brutal reentry. The alarm clock shrieked, dragging Lucie up from a deep, dreamless sleep and back into the cold, dim reality of her basement suite. For a disorienting moment, the lingering scent of old paper from Alistair\u2019s car seemed to hang in the air, a ghost of a better world. Then the familiar dampness of her own apartment asserted itself, and the thirteen-hour double shift loomed, a mountain of Sisyphean drudgery. But as she pulled on her uniform, the familiar black pants and faded pink polo, she felt a profound and irreversible shift. The uniform was no longer her skin; it was a costume. The Gopher Hole was no longer her life; it was a temporary research post, a place she was studying before moving on to her real work. The knowledge was a secret, joyful rebellion. She was a spy, gathering intelligence from deep within enemy territory, and her tour of duty had an end date, even if she didn\u2019t know it yet.\n\nThis new perspective changed her relationship to the diner\u2019s daily grind. It was no longer a cage to be endured, but a puzzle to be solved, a text to be deciphered. The frantic energy of the lunch rush, once a source of overwhelming stress, now seemed like a complex, chaotic ballet. She saw the intricate patterns in the chaos: the way customers unconsciously mirrored each other\u2019s gestures, the way Sal\u2019s movements at the grill were a masterclass in brutal efficiency, a dance of spatula and steel honed over thousands of hours. She found herself smiling at the absurdity of it all, a quiet, knowing smile that had nothing to do with earning a tip. Her calm was so absolute, so otherworldly, that it began to warp the reality around her. Earl came in, took his usual seat, but when he tried to catch her eye with his customary leer, he found her gaze so clear, so distant and compassionately analytical, that he faltered, looking away first and mumbling his order at the menu. She had ceased to be a participant in his small, grubby drama; she was now its audience, and the knowledge seemed to rob him of his power.\n\nTuesday night arrived, and with it, a new kind of anticipation. The walk to the college felt different, less like a pilgrimage to an oracle and more like a meeting with a collaborator. When she walked into the classroom, their eyes met with the familiar, silent acknowledgment, but this time it was underscored with the shared memory of an entire day, of a long car ride and a hundred small confidences. The class itself felt almost like a formality, the public part of a conversation that had become deeply private. Alistair taught with his usual quiet passion, but Lucie could feel his awareness of her in the room, could sense the way he would occasionally phrase a question that seemed aimed directly at her, a continuation of their dialogue disguised as a lesson for the others. She participated more freely now, her voice steady, her insights sharp, unburdened by the fear of being wrong. She wasn't guessing anymore; she was speaking from a place of growing certainty. Brenda from accounting had given up her confused glares and now simply ignored Lucie with a focused, almost hostile intensity, as if her very presence in the room was a personal affront.\n\nThe walk after class was steeped in purpose. The cold air was sharp and clean, a welcome antidote to the stuffy classroom. They fell into their familiar rhythm, their footsteps echoing in the quiet streets, but the silence was not empty. It was filled with the things that now existed between them: the literary festival, Marion Croft\u2019s blessing, his quiet confession about Eleanor. As they reached the corner that had become their unofficial meeting point, Alistair stopped and pulled a folded piece of paper from the inside pocket of his coat. It was not the poem she had given him; it was a crisp, white sheet, neatly typed. \u201cThe list,\u201d he said simply, holding it out to her. \u201cIt\u2019s a start. A few of the better Canadian journals that are known for being open to new voices. I\u2019ve marked the ones I think might be a particularly good fit for your work.\u201d\n\nLucie took the paper, her fingers trembling slightly. The list was an artifact from another universe. The names of the journals were poetry in themselves: *The Fiddlehead*, *Grain*, *The Malahat Review*, *Prairie Fire*. They sounded earthy and old, like names of constellations or wildflowers. Beside a few of them, Alistair had made small, spidery notes in his elegant script. Next to a journal called *Event*, he had written, *Honest, muscular prose poetry. They would understand Sal.* Next to another, *Contemporary Verse 2*, he\u2019d noted, *Likes the sharp, resonant image. The rainbow shrapnel.* He had remembered her lines. He had not only read her work, he had studied it, analyzed it, and was now providing her with a strategic map for its deployment into the world. The care and thought behind the gesture, the profound respect it implied, was overwhelming. She looked up at him, the typed page clutched in her hand. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to thank you,\u201d she whispered. He just smiled, a small, tired, but deeply kind smile. \u201cYou thank me by using it,\u201d he said. \u201cYou thank me by being brave.\u201d\n\nThe bravery he spoke of proved to be a far more complicated thing than she had imagined. Back in her suite, the list spread on her table like a sacred text, a new and more sophisticated terror took hold. It was the paralysis of choice. Her notebook, once a private sanctuary, now felt like a portfolio to be judged. She read through her entries with a cold, critical eye, and the lines that had once felt true and sharp now seemed amateurish and clumsy. The act of choosing which poems to send felt like a betrayal of the others, and the idea of typing them up, of formatting them according to submission guidelines she would have to look up, felt like forcing a wild, living thing into a sterile laboratory jar. For two days, she was frozen, unable to write anything new and unable to choose from the old. The fear of rejection was no longer an abstract concept; it had a dozen names on a list, a dozen post office boxes waiting to receive and dismiss her heart. The freedom Alistair had given her had revealed itself as a new, more terrifying kind of cage: the cage of her own ambition and self-doubt.\n\nShe finally broke the paralysis by focusing on the one thing she could control: the work. She decided not to choose, not yet. Instead, she would prepare. On her next day off, she went to the library, not to borrow a book, but to sit at a public computer. For hours, she meticulously typed up a dozen of her short prose poems, the ones that felt the most complete. The act of seeing her words on the screen, in the clean, anonymous font of Times New Roman, was transformative. Stripped of her cramped, emotional handwriting, they looked different: more objective, more real. The one about Sal, the one about the pancake-sharing couple, the one about the jukebox singing to the exhausted. She printed them out, the warm pages emerging from the machine smelling of hot toner and possibility. Back in her apartment, she spread the twelve poems on her floor, a tarot deck of her own making. She moved them around, trying different combinations, searching for the three or four that spoke to each other, that created a story when placed side by side. It was no longer about her personal feelings; it was about building the strongest possible offering. She chose four. The poem about Sal. The one about the greasy rainbow in the dishwater. The one about the geometry of the shared pancake breakfast. And a new, short one she had written after the festival, about the impossible blue of the prairie sky seen from the passenger seat of a car. She put them in a folder, her heart beating a slow, steady rhythm. The decision was made.\n\nThe final act was a quiet, solitary ritual. She bought a box of crisp, manila envelopes and a book of stamps. In her small, quiet room, she printed a cover letter, her hands shaking only slightly as she typed her name, Lucie Moreau, followed by her address, the address of this basement suite that had been both her prison and her chrysalis. She addressed the envelope to *Event*, the journal Alistair had marked with the note about Sal. It felt right to start there. She folded the poems and the letter, slid them into the envelope, and sealed the flap, her own DNA now a part of the package. The next morning, on her way to the diner in the cold, grey dawn, she stopped at a corner mailbox. The street was empty. The world was still asleep. She held the envelope in her hand for a long, weighted moment. It contained so much more than four pieces of paper. It contained the hiss of the grill, the exhaustion in a cook\u2019s shoulders, a flicker of light on a chrome napkin dispenser, a teacher\u2019s belief, a stranger\u2019s blessing. It was her entire new world, condensed into a single, flat object. With a final, deep breath, she pushed it through the metal slot. The soft thud as it landed inside was the only sound in the quiet street. The work was out of her hands. It was in the mail. It was on its way."

                                        "text": "The day after she mailed the poems, the world felt strangely quiet, as if a constant background hum she hadn\u2019t even been aware of had suddenly ceased. The act of letting the envelope fall into the dark mouth of the mailbox had been a severing. The poems were no longer hers. They were untethered, floating out in the vast, indifferent postal system, and a part of her had gone with them. She walked into the Gopher Hole that morning feeling hollowed out, strangely light. The familiar weight of the diner\u2014the thick, greasy air, the perpetual clatter, the psychic burden of a thousand small demands\u2014rushed in to fill the void, and for the first time in weeks, it was almost a comfort. The weight of a stack of hot plates was a verifiable fact in a world that had become entirely hypothetical. The simple, transactional nature of pouring a cup of coffee was a relief from the vast, unknowable journey her four small pages were now undertaking.\n\nA new ritual quickly established itself, a daily pilgrimage of hope and dread. Her walk home from the bus stop now included a detour to the small bank of community mailboxes at the end of her street. Her heart would begin to hammer as she approached, her hand fumbling with the small key. She would pull open the little metal door with a sense of fatalistic ceremony, expecting\u2026 she didn\u2019t know what. A thin, official-looking envelope that would signal a swift, brutal rejection? Nothing? The latter was what she always found. Just the usual junk mail, flyers for pizza and local politicians, an electricity bill. Each day of emptiness was both a reprieve and a small, accumulating torture. The silence stretched. She began to imagine the journey of her envelope, picturing it in a canvas bin in a rumbling truck, being sorted by indifferent machines, landing in a pile on a desk in an office she couldn\u2019t even picture. She imagined an editor, a faceless, tired person like Alistair, picking it up, sighing, and slitting it open. And then, her imagination would go blank. The scene would refuse to play out, leaving her suspended in a state of pure, anxious potential.\n\nHer writing stalled. The creative energy that had been buzzing through her for weeks seemed to have been sealed in the manila envelope along with the poems. When she sat down with her notebook, her mind was not in the alleyway with Sal or in the corner booth with the young lovers. It was in a hypothetical office in another province, waiting for a verdict. The act of paying attention, which had become a joyful discipline, now felt pointless. Why describe the way the morning light hit the sugar dispenser when her best, most polished words were already out in the world, being ignored or judged? The silence from the journal was a mirror, reflecting her own insignificance back at her. The confidence she had felt after the festival began to fray at the edges, the vibrant colors of that day fading into a muted, anxious grey. She had been brave, as Alistair had urged. But she had not been prepared for the profound loneliness of bravery\u2019s aftermath.\n\nWhen Tuesday came, her anxiety was a sharp, physical thing. She felt a desperate need to see Alistair, to confess her paralysis, to ask him how long this purgatory was supposed to last. She walked into the classroom, and when their eyes met, he seemed to read the frantic question in her gaze. He gave her a small, almost imperceptible nod, a silent message of reassurance that helped her breathe a little easier. The class was on the raw, confessional poetry of Sylvia Plath, and the furious, desperate energy of the poems felt like a perfect match for Lucie\u2019s own taut, frayed nerves. He spoke of Plath\u2019s relentless drive, her ambition, her rage at the world\u2019s indifference. For the first time, Lucie understood that ambition and fear were two sides of the same coin, that the hunger to be heard was inextricably linked to the terror of being ignored.\n\nThe walk after class was a lifeline. The cold air bit at her cheeks, a welcome, grounding shock. They walked in their now-familiar silence for a few blocks before she finally found the courage to speak. \u201cI did it,\u201d she said, her voice small against the quiet hum of the sleeping city. \u201cI sent four of them. To *Event*.\u201d He didn\u2019t stop walking, but she saw his shoulders relax slightly, a subtle release of a tension she hadn\u2019t even known he was carrying. \u201cThat\u2019s a brave first step, Lucie,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the hardest part.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d she said, the word coming out with more force than she intended. \u201cThe silence is the hardest part. It\u2019s been a week. I can\u2019t write. I can\u2019t think about anything else. It feels\u2026 like I\u2019m holding my breath, and I don\u2019t know when I\u2019m allowed to breathe again.\u201d The confession tumbled out, a torrent of anxiety she had been holding back for days. She finally looked at him, her face pleading for an answer. \u201cHow long does it last?\u201d\n\nAlistair stopped under a streetlight, turning to face her. The familiar weariness was back in his eyes, but it was now mingled with a deep, knowing empathy. \u201cOh, Lucie,\u201d he sighed, and the sound was full of a shared, historical pain. \u201cIt never lasts. And it lasts forever.\u201d He saw the confusion on her face and elaborated. \u201cThe waiting for this specific envelope will end. But the waiting itself\u2026 that\u2019s the job. You send a part of your soul out into the world, and you wait. And you wait. And most of the time, the world doesn\u2019t write back. And if it does, it\u2019s usually just to say, \u2018No, thank you.\u2019\u201d He told her about his own first submission, a handful of overwrought poems he\u2019d sent to a prestigious journal when he was nineteen. He described the same ritual of checking the mail, the same agonizing silence. \u201cI waited for six months,\u201d he said, a faint, wry smile on his lips. \u201cSix months of my life, orbiting around this one submission. And then one day, I got it back. A form letter. A photocopied rejection slip, not even a handwritten note. My name wasn't even on it. It just said, \u2018Thank you for your interest.\u2019\u201d\n\nHe saw the look of horror on Lucie\u2019s face and his smile softened. \u201cI was devastated. I thought it was a verdict on my soul. I threw out all my notebooks. I didn\u2019t write a single line for almost a year. I thought, \u2018I\u2019m not a writer. They said so.\u2019\u201d He paused, his gaze turning inward, remembering the sting of that long-ago failure. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the test, you see. The rejection isn\u2019t the test. Everyone gets rejected. The silence is the test. The waiting is the test. It\u2019s designed to weed out the people who are only in it for the applause. It\u2019s a filter for the ones who need to write like they need to breathe. The ones who will keep doing the work even when the world is profoundly, insultingly silent.\u201d He looked at her, his expression serious, his gray eyes holding hers. \u201cThe only way to survive the waiting is to make it irrelevant. You have to start the next poem. And the next one. You have to fall back in love with the work itself, not with the hope of its reception. The work is the only part you can control. It is the only part that is truly yours.\u201d\n\nHis words were not a comforting balm; they were a dose of strong, bitter medicine. He wasn't promising her that her poems would be accepted. He was telling her that, in all likelihood, they wouldn't be. He was welcoming her not into the community of success, but into the far larger, more honorable community of shared artistic struggle. He was telling her that this agonizing period of waiting was not a temporary state of torment, but a fundamental, recurring condition of the life she had chosen. He was telling her it was normal. The realization was a profound, grounding relief. She was not alone in this feeling. He had felt it. Eleanor Vance had felt it. Marion Croft had felt it. The silence wasn\u2019t a personal failing; it was a rite of passage. She took a deep breath, and for the first time in a week, it felt like she was truly drawing air into her lungs. The waiting was not a void. It was part of the process. It was a room in the house of writing, and Alistair had just shown her where the light switch was. \u201cOkay,\u201d she said, her voice a quiet whisper, but steady now. \u201cOkay. The next poem.\u201d He nodded, a look of immense pride in his eyes. He had given her a far greater gift than a list of journals. He had given her a strategy for survival."

That night, back in her basement suite, the silence was no longer an accusation. It was a space waiting to be filled. She sat at her wobbly table, the notebook open to a fresh, terrifyingly blank page. The urge to think about her four lost poems, to track their imaginary journey across the country, was a powerful gravitational pull. But she resisted, anchoring herself in the present moment with a deliberate act of memory. She closed her eyes and summoned the Gopher Hole, not as a place of drudgery, but as a territory to be explored. She thought of a small detail from her last shift: an elderly man sitting alone, meticulously, almost surgically, separating the peas from the carrots on his plate. She\u2019d watched him for a full five minutes, fascinated by the quiet intensity of his task, the strange, solitary order he was imposing on his small, beige world. Her pen, which had felt heavy and useless for days, began to move. *The old man wages a quiet war against the chaos of his plate. Each pea a prisoner rounded up, each carrot a collaborator pushed aside. This is his last, tiny kingdom.* The words were not perfect, but they were a start. They were a new breath.\n\nThe work became the antidote to the waiting. At the diner, she moved with a renewed, almost predatory focus. She was no longer just observing; she was hunting for the precise, telling detail, the line that would unlock a larger truth. She saw a teenage girl in a booth, furiously texting, her face illuminated by the phone\u2019s cold blue light, oblivious to her mother who sat opposite her, staring at her daughter\u2019s averted face with an expression of such naked, heartbreaking longing that Lucie had to turn away. That night, she wrote: *Her mother\u2019s love is a message left on read.* She saw the way the first real snowfall of the deep winter silenced the city, muffling the usual sounds of traffic and transforming the grimy alley behind the diner into a place of stark, monastic beauty. The work became a muscle she exercised daily, and the more she used it, the stronger it grew, pushing the anxious static of the waiting further and further into the background.\n\nThe daily trip to the mailbox became a different kind of ritual. The frantic hope and dread were replaced by a kind of detached, scientific curiosity. She would unlock the small metal door, her heart no longer hammering, and pull out the inevitable collection of junk mail. She would look at the glossy flyers promising impossible weight loss and effortless wealth, at the urgent political mailings full of manufactured outrage, and she would see them not as an annoyance, but as a different kind of poetry\u2014a poetry of desperation, of empty promises and the loud, frantic noise a world makes when it has nothing true to say. The silence from *Event* continued. A week became three weeks, then a month. The deep snows of December gave way to the brutal, biting cold of January. The silence was no longer an agonizing suspense; it was just a fact, a feature of the winter landscape, as constant and as unremarkable as the frozen ground.\n\nTheir Tuesday walks deepened, evolving from mentorship into a true, collaborative exchange. The power dynamic had subtly but irrevocably shifted. She was no longer coming to him for validation, but for consultation. One evening, she read him a new piece, one she was struggling with, about the way the regulars at the diner used nicknames for her\u2014Lucy-Goosey, Sweetcheeks, Hon\u2014as a way of claiming a small, harmless piece of her, and the strange, cumulative weight of all that casual ownership. \u201cThe ending feels wrong,\u201d she told him, not as a confession of failure, but as a statement of a technical problem. \u201cIt\u2019s too sentimental.\u201d He listened, his head cocked, and then offered not a solution, but a question. \u201cWhat if the ending isn\u2019t about how it makes you feel? What if it\u2019s about what it reveals about them?\u201d They spent twenty minutes under a streetlight, two literary mechanics taking apart an engine, their breath pluming in the frigid air as they debated the merits of a single word, the placement of a line break. He had given her a map, and now she was helping him chart new territories within it.\n\nIt was a Tuesday in late February, nearly two months after she had mailed the envelope. The cold had a damp, weary edge to it, the first hint of a distant, unimaginable spring. She was walking home from the bus, her mind on a line she was trying to get right, and she checked the mail with the same detached habit she had cultivated for weeks. She pulled out the usual flyers, and then her fingers brushed against something different. A standard, business-sized envelope. White. Thinner than she would have expected. Her heart, which had been so well-behaved for weeks, gave a single, violent lurch, like a car engine seizing. Her breath caught in her throat. In the top left corner, in a simple, san-serif font, was the return address. *Event Magazine. Department of English. Simon Fraser University. Burnaby, BC.* It was real. It was here. The world, which had been so profoundly silent, had finally written back.\n\nShe did not rip it open there on the cold, windswept street. She walked the rest of the way to her apartment in a state of suspended animation, the envelope clutched in her gloved hand. It felt impossibly light, as if it contained nothing at all. She let herself into her suite, the quiet of the room a stark contrast to the roaring in her ears. She went through her rituals with a slow, deliberate precision, a conscious effort to delay the inevitable. She took off her coat and hung it on the hook. She placed her keys in the bowl by the door. She took off her wet boots and lined them up neatly on the mat. Only then did she walk to the table, her sanctuary, and place the envelope in the center, under the warm circle of light from the lamp. It lay there, white and silent and full of power, a verdict waiting to be read.\n\nHer fingers, numb with cold and adrenaline, were clumsy as she slid a thumb under the flap and tore it open. The sound was small, but it felt as loud as a gunshot in the quiet room. She pulled out the contents. Her own four poems, neatly folded, looking like they had been on a long, tired journey. And clipped to the top with a small, silver paperclip was a piece of paper, a half-sheet, smaller than a postcard. She knew instantly what it was. It was a form. There were checkboxes and printed lines of text. A single box was checked with a crisp, blue X. *We are sorry, but this submission is not a fit for us at this time. We wish you the best of luck in placing your work elsewhere.* Underneath, a generic, printed \u201cThank you for your interest.\u201d It was the photocopied dismissal, the empty, impersonal rejection he had warned her about. It was exactly as he had said it would be.\n\nA hot, sickening wave of disappointment washed over her, a physical blow that made her want to curl in on herself. The sting of tears was sharp and immediate. The work she had bled for, the lines she had wrestled into existence, had been weighed, measured, and dismissed with a blue X in a box. Her first impulse was to crumple the whole package in her fist, to hurl it into the garbage, to erase the evidence of her foolish, audacious hope. The shame was a visceral thing, a burning in her cheeks. But then, through the hot static of her own failure, Alistair\u2019s voice echoed, calm and steady. *The rejection isn\u2019t the test. Everyone gets rejected. The silence is the test\u2026 The waiting is the test.* This small, sterile piece of paper was not a verdict on her soul. It was not the end of the story. It was just a plot point. It was a closed door. She let out a long, shuddering breath, the air she had been holding since she saw the envelope. She unclipped the rejection slip. She looked at it for a long moment, this artifact from the world of letters, her first one. Then she set it aside on the table, not as a mark of shame, but as a souvenir of her first expedition. She took her four poems, her brave little soldiers returning from a lost battle, and smoothed them out. They were still good. The truth in them was still true. They were still hers. With a steady hand, she picked up the typed list Alistair had given her. She drew a neat, firm line through the name *Event*. Then her eyes moved to the next name on the list. *Prairie Fire*. She stood up, walked to the drawer where she kept her stationery, and pulled out a fresh, clean manila envelope."

                                        "text": "The journey to the corner mailbox the next morning was a different kind of pilgrimage. The raw hope of the first sending had been replaced by something harder and more durable: resolve. The air was cold and thin, stinging Lucie\u2019s lungs, and the sky was a flat, unforgiving sheet of grey. The world seemed stripped of its poetry, reduced to its bare, functional elements. But the envelope in her hand was a counter-argument. It was not a desperate plea flung into the void; it was a deliberate act, a strategic redeployment. She did not linger at the mailbox. She did not whisper a prayer as she pushed the envelope through the slot. She simply executed the task with a quiet, grim efficiency. The soft thud of its landing was not a sound of release, but a sound of reset. It was the click of a chamber being reloaded. The campaign had begun again.\n\nThat evening, a frigid, blustery Tuesday, their walk after class felt charged with a new, unspoken agenda. The wind whipped around the corners of the silent downtown buildings, a mournful, wailing sound that seemed to mirror the loneliness of the writer\u2019s life. Lucie walked with her hands shoved deep in her pockets, the rejection slip folded into a small, neat square in her wallet, a secret she was carrying to confession. They walked two full blocks in a silence that was heavier than usual before she found the words. \u201cI heard back from *Event*,\u201d she said, her voice steady, her gaze fixed on the cracked pavement in front of her. \u201cIt was a no.\u201d She did not elaborate. She did not describe the blue X or the hollow feeling it had carved in her chest. She stated it as a fact, a piece of data. She felt Alistair\u2019s gaze on her, studying her profile, searching, she knew, for the tell-tale signs of devastation.\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d he said after a moment, his voice calm and matter-of-fact. \u201cWelcome to the club. The first one is a bastard.\u201d The bluntness of his language, the casual, almost cheerful acceptance of her failure as a rite of passage, was more comforting than any expression of sympathy could have been. \u201cWhat did you do?\u201d The question was the real test. He was not asking how she felt; he was asking what action she had taken. She finally turned to look at him, a small, weary smile touching her lips for the first time. \u201cI crossed it off the list,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I sent the poems to *Prairie Fire* this morning.\u201d For the first time since she had known him, Alistair Finch stopped walking and laughed. It was not a loud laugh, but a low, rumbling sound of pure, unadulterated delight and pride. It was the sound of a teacher seeing his most difficult, most important lesson land perfectly. \u201cLucie Moreau,\u201d he said, shaking his head in wry admiration, his breath pluming in the frigid air. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be dangerous.\u201d\n\nThe waiting began again, but it was a different beast. The first period of silence had been a frantic, desperate vigil. This new silence was a low, steady hum in the background of her life, a condition she was learning to live with. It was the new normal. Spring arrived on the prairies not as a gentle awakening, but as a muddy, reluctant truce. The mountains of grey, exhaust-stained snow melted, revealing the winter-killed grass and a season\u2019s worth of forgotten trash. The Gopher Hole smelled of wet wool and damp boots. But Lucie was insulated from the bleakness of the season by the fierce, internal fire of her work. She had followed Alistair\u2019s advice to the letter. She had made the waiting irrelevant by falling back in love with the work itself. Her notebook filled with the poetry of the thaw: the melancholic drip of water from awnings, the dirty puddles that reflected the grey sky with a startling, perfect clarity, the first, tentative song of a bird returning to a barren-looking tree.\n\nHer collection of poems grew. She typed them up at the library, building a small, respectable manuscript of a dozen, then fifteen, then twenty pieces. Following her own strategic logic, she sent out another packet of four poems to *The Malahat Review*, and a week later, another to *The Fiddlehead*. She was no longer sending out her only children; she was deploying troops on multiple fronts. The rejections began to trickle in. *Prairie Fire* sent back a form slip after six weeks. *The Malahat Review* took nearly three months to return her work with the same polite, impersonal dismissal. She would open the envelopes, register the familiar, faint sting of disappointment, and then she would file the slip in a small box she now kept on her desk. The box was becoming a tangible record of her efforts, a testament to her resilience. Each slip was a scar, and she was beginning to see them not as blemishes, but as marks of a veteran, proof that she was in the fight.\n\nIt was a Tuesday in early April. The air was still cool, but it held the unmistakable, loamy scent of damp earth and new growth. Lucie was on her way to class, having stopped at her mailbox on the way. There was another envelope, this one bearing the elegant, old-fashioned script of *The Fiddlehead*\u2019s logo. She had opened it without ceremony, standing right there on the street, expecting another form slip for her collection. Her poems were inside, folded as always. The rejection slip was the standard format. A blue X in the box next to *We are sorry, but this submission is not a fit for us at this time.* She had been about to fold it and put it in her bag with the others when she saw it. At the very bottom of the slip, below the printed lines, was a tiny, almost illegible scrawl in blue pen, written so small it was clearly an afterthought, a hurried impulse. She had to hold the paper close to her face, her breath catching as she deciphered the script. *Not for us, but \u201cThe Geometry of a Shared Meal\u201d has a lovely, quiet power. Keep going. -S.K.*\n\nShe stood frozen on the sidewalk, the world receding into a muted blur. It was a no. But it was a no that had looked her in the eye. It was a no that had learned her name. A person. A real, living person with the initials S.K. had read her poem and had been moved enough to break protocol, to scrawl a ten-word message of encouragement. The words were a key turning in a lock she hadn\u2019t even known was there. It wasn\u2019t just Alistair\u2019s kindness. It wasn\u2019t just her own stubborn belief. This was external, objective proof from a stranger, a gatekeeper, a person whose job it was to say no. And they had taken the time to whisper, *Keep going*. A hot, sudden tear escaped and traced a path down her cold cheek. It was not a tear of sadness or frustration, but of a dizzying, overwhelming gratitude. She walked the rest of the way to the college in a daze, the small half-sheet of paper clutched in her hand like a winning lottery ticket. When she walked into the classroom, Alistair looked up, and he must have seen the dazed, luminous joy on her face. A slow, questioning smile spread across his lips. She walked straight to his desk, bypassing her own seat, and placed the small slip of paper on the lectern in front of him. He looked down, read the brief, scrawled message, and then looked back up at her, his own eyes shining with a fierce, reflected pride. \u201cSee?\u201d he whispered, his voice full of a quiet, triumphant joy. \u201cThe world is starting to write back.\u201d"
