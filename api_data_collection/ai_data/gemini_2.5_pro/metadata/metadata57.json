     "novel_text": "The letter, when it arrived, didn't feel real. It was just a slip of thick, cream-coloured cardstock, nestled between a power bill and a flyer for a pizza place that promised two for the price of one. For a full minute, Maia Hart just stared at the crisp, embossed logo at the top: a stylised whisk and rolling pin encircled by a wreath of silver fern. The Great Kiwi Bake Off. Finalist. The words seemed to shimmer, refusing to be absorbed by her brain. She read them once, then twice. She traced the letters with a flour-dusted finger.\n\nHer flat, a tiny one-bedroom shoebox above a laundromat in Kingsland, was suddenly too small to contain the frantic energy that erupted inside her chest. It was a feeling like proving dough, a warmth that expanded until it pressed against her ribs, threatening to burst. She let out a laugh that was more of a gasp, a sound that felt foreign in the quiet of her usually solitary mornings. She was in. The final. After weeks of televised, sugar-fuelled anxiety, of piping bags splitting at the worst possible moment and jellies that refused to set under the hot studio lights, she had actually made it.\n\nAuckland stretched out beyond her window, a familiar panorama of grey slate roofs, lush green volcanic cones, and the distant, needle-like point of the Sky Tower. It was a city she knew in her bones, a city that had raised her in a patchwork of foster homes and, finally, the St. Cuthbert\u2019s Group Home for Girls. It had never quite felt like hers, more like a place she was just passing through. She was a ghost in its bustling laneways, a silent observer on its crowded buses. But now, holding this letter, she felt a flicker of belonging. Maia Hart, the orphan from nowhere, was a finalist. People knew her name. They\u2019d cheered for her rose and pistachio Battenberg, wept with her when she\u2019d dedicated her Signature Bake to Mrs Gable, the care home volunteer who had first put a wooden spoon in her hand.\n\nBaking was the one constant, the one controllable science in a life defined by chaos. You measured the flour, you creamed the butter and sugar until it was pale and fluffy, you trusted the heat of the oven. Follow the steps, and something beautiful, something whole, would emerge. It was an alchemy she\u2019d clung to, a way to create warmth where there was none, to build a home one gingerbread brick at a time. The grand prize, a hundred thousand dollars and a magazine spread, wasn't just money. It was a down payment on a dream. A little caf\u00e9, maybe in Devonport, with a sea-green door and the smell of coffee and cardamom buns spilling onto the pavement. A place that was hers. A foundation.\n\nHer phone buzzed on the counter, rattling against a stray crumb of yesterday's sourdough experiment. The screen lit up with a picture of a grinning idiot covered in grease. Liam.\n\n\"You'd better not be calling to tell me you've glued your hand to a carburettor again,\" she answered, the smile evident in her voice.\n\n\"Very funny, Hart,\" his voice crackled back, warm and familiar as her oldest cardigan. \"Just calling for the pre-game pep talk. Are we in a state of mortal terror, or have we ascended to a zen-like plane of buttercream acceptance?\"\n\nMaia clutched the letter to her chest. \"I'm holding the official letter, Liam. It's on fancy paper and everything. It feels\u2026 heavy.\"\n\n\"That's because it's heavy with the weight of your impending victory. And probably the cost of the fancy paper. So, what\u2019s the plan? You packed? The Biscuit ready to roll? I told you I could come get you, you know. My ute might smell of oil rags and desperation, but she runs.\"\n\n\"The Biscuit is fine,\" she said, a little too defensively. The Biscuit was her 1998 Toyota Corolla, a dented, sea-mist green vessel of questionable reliability. It was the first thing she'd ever bought for herself, saved up from two years of waitressing. It was freedom, even if that freedom sometimes stalled at traffic lights. \"She's all packed up. Coolers in the back for the pre-made elements, my lucky apron on the passenger seat. Everything is under control.\"\n\n\"\u2018Everything is under control\u2019,\" Liam mimicked, his tone laced with fond amusement. \"Famous last words of every baker before the showstopper melts. Just\u2026 be careful on the motorway, okay? Call me when you get to the studio. And Maia?\"\n\n\"Yeah?\"\n\n\"You've already won, you know. Just by being you.\"\n\nThe sincerity in his voice made her throat tighten. Liam was the closest thing to family she had. They\u2019d met at St. Cuthbert\u2019s, two scrawny kids clinging to the edges of a world that didn't seem to want them. He was the one who\u2019d held her hand at Mrs Gable\u2019s funeral, the one who\u2019d taught her how to change a tyre, the one who\u2019d tasted every single one of her practice bakes, from the disastrous first attempt at a pavlova (more of a meringue puddle) to the triumphant twelve-layer opera cake that had got her through the semi-final. He saw her, not as the orphan or the charity case, but as Maia.\n\n\"Don't get sappy on me now, McCarthy,\" she mumbled, blinking back a sudden prickle of tears. \"You'll ruin my eyeliner before I've even left the house.\"\n\n\"Right. Tough girl. Go get 'em, Hart. I'll be watching. Shouting at the telly like a proper nutter.\"\n\nAfter they hung up, she took a deep breath. He was right. Zen-like plane of buttercream acceptance. She walked over to the small bookshelf in her living room and picked up a worn, faded recipe book. The cover was gone, the spine held together with yellowing tape. Mrs Gable's book. It was filled with her spidery, elegant handwriting, with notes in the margins and flour smudges on every page. Maia opened it to a random page. *Madeira Cake. The secret, my dear girl, is not to rush the creaming.*\n\nShe ran her thumb over the words. This final bake was for Mrs Gable. A tribute, a thank you. Her showstopper was a confectionary recreation of the Auckland skyline, a towering masterpiece of lemon and elderflower sponge, white chocolate glacage, and spun sugar details. The Sky Tower, a delicate shard of pulled isomalt. It was ambitious. It was terrifying. It was everything.\n\nWith a final check of her tiny apartment\u2014everything neat, everything in its place, a fortress against the untidiness of the world\u2014she grabbed her keys from the bowl by the door. The little silver key for The Biscuit felt cool and solid in her palm. A key to her car. A key to the final. A key to her future.\n\nDownstairs, the air was thick with the scent of warm laundry and chemical softener from the laundromat. The Biscuit was parked in its usual spot, looking small and slightly weary under the glare of the morning sun. Maia gave the bonnet a reassuring pat.\n\n\"Don't you let me down today,\" she whispered to the car, feeling only slightly ridiculous. \"We've got a date with destiny, you and I.\"\n\nShe loaded the last of her bags, the cooler bags containing her precious, perfectly tempered chocolate and delicate cr\u00e8me p\u00e2tissi\u00e8re, into the back seat with the reverence of a bomb disposal expert. She settled into the driver's seat, the familiar worn fabric a comfort. The lucky apron, a cheerful yellow and white gingham, sat beside her. She turned the key. The engine sputtered, coughed, then reluctantly turned over with a long, pained groan that sounded suspiciously like its owner on a Monday morning. It settled into a rough, rattling idle. Good enough.\n\nMaia pulled out of the parking spot, her heart thumping a steady, nervous rhythm against her ribs. She navigated the familiar streets of Kingsland, past caf\u00e9s just opening up, their signs promising flat whites and cronuts. The journey to the film studio out in West Auckland should take forty-five minutes. The final started in three hours. Plenty of time. She allowed herself a small, genuine smile. For the first time, the road ahead felt clear. It was a straight shot, a direct line from here to the start of the rest of her life. The sun was out, a good omen. The radio was playing a cheerful, upbeat song. Nothing could possibly go wrong.The Northwestern Motorway was a river of metal and light, flowing steadily towards the city. Maia merged into the current, The Biscuit chugging along gamely in the middle lane. She even allowed herself to turn up the radio, a jaunty pop song filling the small car. Out to her left, the suburbs of West Auckland unfolded, a patchwork of tile and timber. To her right, the familiar form of the city skyline shimmered in the morning haze, the very same skyline she intended to build from sugar and hope. The anxiety in her chest had eased, replaced by a thrum of pure, unadulterated excitement. This was happening. It was real.\n\nThe first hint of trouble was a subtle one, a slight hesitation as she pressed the accelerator to overtake a truck. The engine, which had been rattling along with a familiar rhythm, seemed to miss a beat. The radio crackled, the singer\u2019s voice dissolving into a burst of static before returning. Maia frowned, her fingers tightening on the steering wheel. She gave the dashboard a light, cautionary tap, a silent plea for cooperation. The car gave a violent shudder in response, a full-body convulsion that sent a jolt of alarm through her. The pained groan from her driveway returned, deeper this time, a guttural, metallic sound of something vital giving up.\n\nPanic, cold and sharp, pierced through her excitement. The accelerator was suddenly limp and useless beneath her foot. The car was losing speed, fast. In her rearview mirror, a silver SUV loomed, its driver\u2019s mouth already open in an angry shout. She flicked on her hazard lights, the frantic clicking sound a weak counterpoint to the roar of the motorway. The power steering died, and the wheel became heavy and obstinate in her hands. With all the strength in her arms, she began to wrench the car towards the left-hand shoulder, a desperate, clumsy manoeuvre across two lanes of fast-moving traffic. Horns blared around her, a cacophony of outrage and alarm. She didn't dare look at the faces of the other drivers, keeping her eyes fixed on the narrow strip of gravel and weeds that represented safety.\n\nWith a final, dying lurch, The Biscuit rolled onto the shoulder and came to a dead stop. The engine fell silent. The sudden absence of its rattling hum was more terrifying than the noise had been. All she could hear now was the thunder of cars hurtling past just feet away, the force of their passage rocking her little car. She switched the hazard lights off and on again, but they were dead. The whole car was dead. Maia stared through the windscreen, her breath coming in short, sharp gasps. The sun, which had felt like a blessing minutes ago, was now a malevolent force, beating down on the car's thin metal roof. She glanced at the clock on her phone. 8:47 AM. The minutes were already starting to bleed away. Her gaze drifted to the back seat, to the cooler bags sitting in a neat row. Her cr\u00e8me p\u00e2tissi\u00e8re, her tempered chocolate collars, her delicate lemon curd. They were on a timer. The warmth of the car was no longer a comfort; it was a ticking bomb.\n\nThe familiar, crushing feeling of helplessness washed over her, a ghost from her past. This was the chaos she had spent her life trying to outrun, the unpredictable disaster that always lurked just around the corner, ready to undo all her careful planning. Control was an illusion. Her confident words to Liam echoed in her head, a bitter mockery. *\u2018Everything is under control.\u2019* She wanted to laugh, or maybe scream. She was stranded, a ghost on the edge of the city once more, invisible to the thousands of people rushing past on their way to their solid, reliable lives. The caf\u00e9 in Devonport, the sea-green door, the foundation she was so close to building\u2014it all seemed to be dissolving like spun sugar in the rain.\n\nWith a shaking hand, she found Liam\u2019s contact in her phone and pressed call. It rang twice before he picked up, his voice still cheerful. \"Change of heart? Want me to bring the ute and a brass band to welcome you?\"\n\n\"Liam,\" she said, and was horrified to hear her own voice, thin and tight with unshed tears. \"Liam, it happened.\"\n\nThe cheer vanished from his voice, replaced by an immediate, sharp concern. \"What happened? Are you okay? Did someone hit you?\"\n\n\"No, I\u2019m fine. It's The Biscuit.\" She swallowed, trying to force the lump in her throat down. \"She's dead. Completely dead. I'm on the side of the Northwestern, just before the Te Atat\u016b exit.\"\n\nThere was a moment of silence on his end, then the sound of a muffled curse and the clatter of what sounded like a wrench hitting a concrete floor. \"Okay. Okay, don't panic. Stay in the car, doors locked. I'm on my way. Traffic is a nightmare heading west, but I'll get there. Can you call roadside assistance?\"\n\n\"I\u2026 yes. I think so.\" The thought hadn't even occurred to her. Her mind had gone blank, filled only with the image of her perfect showstopper melting into a puddle in the back seat. \"Liam, the final starts in less than three hours. My ingredients\u2026\"\n\n\"We'll figure it out, Maia,\" he said, his voice firm, trying to project a confidence neither of them felt. \"One problem at a time. First, let's get you and your sugar off the side of a motorway. Call the tow service. I'm leaving now. Just\u2026 hang tight, Hart. I'm coming.\"After hanging up, Maia took a shaky breath and tried to follow Liam\u2019s instructions. One problem at a time. Roadside assistance. She fumbled through the glove compartment, her fingers clumsy with adrenaline, past old service receipts and a crumpled map of the Coromandel Peninsula. She found the membership card, its plastic flimsy and worn. The automated voice on the other end of the line was maddeningly calm, asking her to press one for this, two for that. Each menu option was a fresh wave of frustration. When she finally reached a human operator, a man with a bored, monotone voice, she had to repeat her location three times over the roar of passing trucks.\n\n\u201cOkay, ma\u2019am. We\u2019ve got a truck en route. Should be there within sixty to ninety minutes.\u201d\n\n\u201cNinety minutes?\u201d The words came out as a squeak. \u201cI can\u2019t wait that long! It\u2019s an emergency!\u201d\n\n\u201cIs the vehicle on fire, ma\u2019am? Are you or any passengers injured?\u201d the man asked, his tone unchanged.\n\n\u201cNo, but\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThen it\u2019s not a priority-one callout. The driver will be there as soon as he can. Please remain in your vehicle with your hazard lights on.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy hazard lights don\u2019t work! The whole car is dead!\u201d she cried, but the line had already clicked off, replaced by a dial tone. Sixty to ninety minutes. It was a death sentence. Her grand final, her dream, would be over before the tow truck even arrived. A wave of nausea rolled through her. She leaned her forehead against the steering wheel, the cheap plastic hot against her skin. The smell of hot vinyl and old dust filled her nostrils. She was going to fail. Not because her sponge wasn\u2019t light enough, or her ganache hadn't emulsified, but because of a faulty alternator in a twenty-year-old car. It was so mundane, so pathetic.\n\nShe forced herself to sit up, her gaze falling once more on the cooler bags in the back. Her beautiful, stable Italian meringue buttercream would be weeping. Her cr\u00e8me p\u00e2tissi\u00e8re, a delicate custard that relied on cold to maintain its integrity, would be turning slack and grainy. The chocolate collars, tempered to a perfect, glossy snap, would be softening, losing their shine, becoming dull and pedestrian. She could almost feel the heat radiating from the car's roof, a malevolent oven undoing all her work. Desperate, she twisted around and unzipped the largest cooler bag. The ice packs inside were already slick with condensation, their hard-frozen shapes beginning to soften at the edges. The containers of cream and curd felt cool, but not cold. It wouldn't last.\n\nTime stretched and warped. Every minute that ticked by on her phone felt like an hour. The stream of traffic was relentless, a hypnotising blur of colour and motion. No one looked. No one saw her. She was just another breakdown, a temporary inconvenience in the day of a thousand strangers. A flash of blue and red in her rearview mirror made her jump. A police car, lights flashing silently, pulled in behind The Biscuit. A tall, broad-shouldered officer got out, his face unreadable behind a pair of reflective sunglasses. He walked towards her window with a purposeful stride, his hand resting lightly on his belt. Maia\u2019s heart hammered against her ribs. She fumbled to wind down the window, the manual crank stiff and protesting.\n\n\u201cMorning, miss,\u201d he said, his voice loud but not unkind over the traffic noise. \u201cHaving a bit of trouble?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy car just died,\u201d she said, her voice trembling slightly. \u201cThe whole electrical system, I think. I\u2019ve called for a tow truck, but they said it could be an hour and a half.\u201d\n\nThe officer nodded, his gaze sweeping over the interior of the car, lingering for a moment on the cooler bags in the back. \u201cRight. Well, you\u2019re in a dangerous spot here. The longer you\u2019re on the shoulder, the higher the risk of someone drifting over. We need to get this vehicle cleared as soon as possible.\u201d He spoke with the calm authority of someone who dealt with this every day. To him, her crisis was just a box to be ticked.\n\n\u201cI know, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d she stammered. \u201cI\u2019m a finalist in the Great Kiwi Bake Off. The final is this morning. All my ingredients are in the back\u2026 they\u2019re going to spoil in the heat.\u201d The words tumbled out, sounding foolish and desperate even to her own ears.\n\nThe officer\u2019s expression didn't change. The reflection in his sunglasses showed a distorted, wide-angle view of the motorway. \u201cIs that so? Well, congratulations. But my priority right now is road safety. I\u2019ll see if I can\u2019t hurry your tow along.\u201d He walked back to his car and spoke into his radio. Maia watched him, a knot of dread tightening in her stomach. He wasn't her saviour; he was just another complication, another person in a uniform who saw her not as a person, but as a problem to be managed. The dreams of her Devonport caf\u00e9, with its sea-green door and the smell of cardamom, felt like a fantasy from another lifetime.The officer returned to her window, his expression still neutral. The mirrored sunglasses made it impossible to tell if her plea had registered at all. He leaned down, placing his hands on the doorframe. \u201cRight, Miss Hart. I\u2019ve spoken with dispatch. The best I can do is get the motorway patrol tow here, but they\u2019re still twenty minutes out, minimum. We can\u2019t leave the vehicle here for that long. It\u2019s a hazard.\u201d\n\nTwenty minutes. In twenty minutes, the delicate balance of her cr\u00e8me p\u00e2tissi\u00e8re would be a lost cause. \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d Maia asked, her voice small. \u201cWhere will they take it?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll tow it to the nearest impound yard. You can collect it from there once you\u2019ve paid the fee.\u201d He said it so matter-of-factly, as if he were explaining the rules of a simple game. An impound yard. A fee. More chaos, more complications, more money she didn\u2019t have. It was all spiralling away from her. He must have seen the despair on her face, because he paused, his head tilting slightly. \u201cThe Great Kiwi Bake Off, you said? With the posh judges?\u201d\n\nMaia nodded numbly, not trusting herself to speak.\n\n\u201cMy wife loves that show,\u201d the officer said, a hint of something human entering his voice. \u201cNever misses it. She\u2019s a terrible baker, mind you. Sets the smoke alarm off trying to make toast.\u201d He looked back at the cooler bags again. \u201cShe was very impressed with that rose Battenberg you made. Said it looked too good to eat.\u201d A ghost of a smile touched his lips. \u201cI reckon she\u2019d be gutted if you didn\u2019t make the final because of a dodgy alternator.\u201d\n\nThe unexpected kindness was like a crack in a dam. A single, hot tear escaped and slid down Maia\u2019s cheek. She hastily wiped it away with the back of her hand. \u201cI just\u2026 I don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI can\u2019t lose this.\u201d\n\nThe officer\u2019s face softened. \u201cRight. Okay. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do. We can\u2019t save the car right now, but we can save the cake stuff. Have you got a friend who can come and get you? Or I can call you a taxi? You can take your gear and go. I\u2019ll wait with the vehicle until the tow arrives and handle the paperwork.\u201d\n\nIt was an offer of such simple, practical help that it stunned her. He was giving her a way out. A chance. \u201cMy friend is on his way,\u201d she said, her voice thick with gratitude. \u201cHe\u2019s a mechanic. He\u2019s coming from his workshop in Avondale.\u201d\n\nAs if summoned by her words, a vehicle swerved aggressively from the fast lane, cutting across two lanes of traffic with a squeal of tyres and a chorus of angry horns. It was a battered, rust-pocked ute that might have once been blue, but was now a patchwork of primer grey and grime. It shuddered to a halt behind the police car, its engine rattling like a can full of bolts. Liam. He vaulted out of the driver's side before the engine had even fully cut out, his lanky frame radiating frantic energy. He was wearing his work overalls, a smudge of black grease cutting a sharp line across his cheekbone. He took one look at Maia in the car, the police officer beside her, and his face was a mask of alarm.\n\n\u201cMaia! Are you okay? What\u2019s going on?\u201d he yelled, jogging towards them, dodging the wing mirror of a passing bus.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Liam! I\u2019m fine!\u201d she called out, a wave of profound relief washing over her. He was here. Her family was here.\n\nThe police officer held up a hand to slow him down. \u201cEasy does it, son. No need to cause another accident.\u201d He turned back to Maia. \u201cIs this your mechanic?\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is Liam,\u201d she said, managing a real smile for the first time that morning.\n\nLiam skidded to a stop beside the officer, breathing heavily. \u201cThe car\u2019s dead,\u201d Maia explained quickly. \u201cThe electrics are gone. This officer was just helping me. We have to get my ingredients out and go. The tow is coming to take The Biscuit away.\u201d\n\nLiam\u2019s eyes darted from Maia to the cooler bags and back again. The mechanic in him visibly mourned the car for a split second, but the friend took over immediately. \u201cRight. Operation Sugar Lift is a go.\u201d He gave the officer a quick, respectful nod. \u201cThanks, officer. For looking after her.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust doing my job,\u201d the officer replied gruffly, though his gaze had softened. \u201cNow let\u2019s get this done. The sooner you\u2019re out of the live lane, the better.\u201d\n\nWhat followed was a frantic, coordinated ballet of desperation on the narrow motorway shoulder. Liam threw open the passenger door of his ute, revealing a cab that smelled strongly of oil and was littered with stray sockets and crumpled coffee cups. He cleared the passenger seat with a single swipe of his arm, tossing a greasy rag into the back. Maia unbuckled and scrambled out of The Biscuit, the heat and noise of the traffic hitting her with physical force. Together, they began transferring the precious cargo. Each cooler bag was lifted with the utmost care, a fragile parcel of hope passed from her hands to his.\n\n\u201cCareful with the blue one!\u201d she instructed, her voice high with stress. \u201cThat\u2019s the cr\u00e8me p\u00e2t and the lemon curd. They need to stay flat!\u201d\n\n\u201cGot it, got it. Treating them like unstable nitroglycerin,\u201d Liam muttered, carefully sliding the bag onto the floor of his ute. They worked in silence for a moment, the roar of the traffic their only soundtrack. With the last bag safely transferred, Maia paused and looked back at The Biscuit. Her little sea-mist green car looked forlorn and abandoned, its journey over. A lump formed in her throat. It was just a car, but it was her car. Her freedom.\n\n\u201cHey,\u201d Liam said softly, touching her arm. \u201cIt\u2019s just metal, Hart. We\u2019ll get her back later. Right now, you\u2019ve got a bake-off to win.\u201d He pulled her into a quick, one-armed hug that smelled of engine oil and unwavering loyalty.\n\nShe nodded, taking a deep, fortifying breath. He was right. She slammed the door of The Biscuit shut, a final, sad goodbye. She turned to the police officer, who was watching them with his arms crossed. \u201cThank you,\u201d she said, the words feeling utterly inadequate. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I would have done.\u201d\n\nHe gave a slight nod. \u201cMy wife will be watching tonight. Don\u2019t make me tell her you got disqualified. Name\u2019s Officer Miller, by the way.\u201d He permitted himself another small smile. \u201cGood luck, Miss Hart.\u201d\n\nMaia clambered into the passenger seat of the ute, pulling the door shut. Liam was already behind the wheel, turning the key. The engine coughed back to life with its familiar, unhealthy rattle. He checked the mirror, then with a boldness that bordered on suicidal, he pulled out into the traffic, flooring the accelerator. The ute roared in protest but lurched forward, merging into the river of cars. In the wing mirror, Maia saw Officer Miller standing beside her dead car, a solid, reassuring figure diminishing in the distance. They were moving. They were on their way. She glanced at her phone. 9:15 AM. They had lost almost forty-five minutes. The race was far from over.## Chapter 2\n\nThe journey in Liam's ute was a violent, rattling assault on the senses. The cabin smelled overwhelmingly of metal, oil, and the faint, sweet scent of the industrial-strength hand-cleaner Liam used. Every pothole and lane change was a jolt that threatened to send the precariously balanced cooler bags tumbling. Liam drove with a focused intensity, his knuckles white on the steering wheel, weaving through the traffic with a terrifying lack of regard for indicators or the angry shouts of other drivers. He was a man with a mission, and the mission was getting his best friend and her precious cargo of dairy and sugar to their destination in one piece. Maia found herself bracing her feet against the floor and holding a protective arm over the cooler bag on her lap, as if she could personally absorb the shocks of the road.\n\n\"How's the cargo holding up?\" Liam asked, his eyes flicking from the road to her face and back again. \"Is the buttercream still\u2026 butter and creamy?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" Maia said, her voice tight. \"I'm too scared to look. The ice packs felt like they were turning into sad bags of lukewarm water.\" Resisting the urge was impossible. With fumbling fingers, she unzipped the nearest cooler. The blast of air that emerged was cool, not cold. The containers were beaded with sweat. She picked up the tub of her Italian meringue buttercream. It looked stable, miraculously. But then she lifted the container of cr\u00e8me p\u00e2tissi\u00e8re. She gave it a gentle tilt. It moved too quickly, a slack, unhappy wobble that told her the starch structure was beginning to break down. It wasn't ruined, not yet, but it was compromised. A deep, sick feeling settled in her stomach.\n\n\"It's not good, Liam. The cr\u00e8me p\u00e2t is going to be soupy.\" She fought to keep the tremor out of her voice. \"And my chocolate collars for the base of the towers\u2026 if they've lost their temper in this heat, they'll have no snap. They'll be dull and soft.\"\n\n\"Okay,\" Liam said, his voice level. \"So you'll have to re-whisk the custard over an ice bath. You can do that. And the chocolate? You're the chocolate whisperer, Hart. You can re-temper it in ten minutes flat. This is just an extra little challenge to prove you're the best. A handicap, to make it fair on the other two.\" His determined optimism was so quintessentially Liam that she almost smiled. He refused to entertain the possibility of failure, and for a moment, his belief was infectious.\n\nThey screeched into the film studio's car park with ten minutes to spare before filming was scheduled to begin. Before Liam had even killed the noisy engine, a young woman with a headset and a panicked expression was running towards them, clipboard clutched to her chest. \"Maia! Oh my god, Maia! We were about to send out a search party! The producers are having kittens. Where have you been?\"\n\n\"Car trouble,\" Maia said, throwing her door open and practically falling out of the high seat of the ute. \"Long story.\" Liam was already out and halfway to the back, lowering the tailgate with a rusty screech. He began passing the cooler bags to Maia and the frantic production assistant, whose name was Sarah. The other two finalists, a stern-faced architect from Christchurch named David and a bubbly, ruthlessly competent retiree from the Hawke's Bay named June, were visible through the open doors of the studio. They were already at their stations, aprons on, equipment laid out in neat, orderly rows. They looked calm, prepared, and impossibly clean. Maia, in contrast, felt like she\u2019d just survived a natural disaster, her hair coming loose from its bun, her cheek smudged with dirt from where she'd leaned against the ute's grimy door.\n\nLiam, a grease-stained apparition in a world of pastel-coloured stand mixers, helped her haul the last of the bags into the vast, brightly-lit studio. The familiar scent of the Bake Off tent\u2014a strange but comforting mix of warm sugar, industrial cleaning supplies, and ozone from the lighting rigs\u2014filled her lungs. The set was exactly as she\u2019d left it, but seeing it now, in her state of high alert, it felt alien and intimidating. The judges were in a huddle with the director, casting anxious glances her way. Liam set the final bag down on the stainless-steel workbench of her station, the one with her name on it. He squeezed her shoulder, his hand warm and solid. \"This is your house,\" he murmured, his voice low so only she could hear. \"You own this place. Now go show them what you're made of.\" He gave her a final, crooked grin before turning to be politely but firmly escorted from the set by Sarah.\n\nLeft alone at her station, the full weight of the morning's catastrophe crashed down on her. Her neat rows of pre-weighed ingredients were gone, replaced by a jumble of cooler bags. Her perfectly planned schedule was in tatters. She had five hours to create a masterpiece, and she was starting with a forty-five-minute deficit and compromised ingredients. With trembling hands, she began to unpack. The buttercream was, thankfully, fine. The lemon and elderflower sponges she'd baked last night were still wrapped and perfect. But her fears about the chocolate were confirmed. She peeled back the baking paper from one of the tall, elegant collars she had painstakingly crafted. The deep, glossy brown was gone, replaced by a chalky, greyish bloom. When she lifted it, it felt soft, bending slightly in her hand instead of holding its rigid shape. It had no snap. It was useless. A fresh wave of despair washed over her. She would have to melt it all down and start the entire, painstaking tempering process again.\n\n\"Bakers, one minute to the start of your final Showstopper!\" The host's booming, cheerful voice echoed through the studio, making her flinch. \"I trust we've all had a calm and relaxing morning?\" He gave her a pointed look and a theatrical wink, and a ripple of polite laughter went through the crew. Maia felt her cheeks burn. She wasn't an object of sympathy; she was a dramatic anecdote, a bit of colour for the show's narrative. She took a deep breath, her eyes falling on the lucky gingham apron sitting on top of one of her bags. She untied the messy bun, quickly re-did it into a tight knot, and tied the apron around her waist. The familiar ritual was grounding. She laid out her tools. Whisk, bowls, spatula. She thought of Mrs Gable's patient hands guiding her own. *The secret, my dear girl, is not to rush.* She thought of the sea-green door of her imaginary caf\u00e9. It wasn't just a bake. It was a foundation. The noise of the studio faded into a low hum. It was just her, her bench, and the ingredients.\n\n\"Your final challenge,\" announced the head judge, his voice resonating with gravitas, \"is to create a Showstopper spectacle that pays tribute to your hometown. It must be a towering work of edible art, telling us a story about the place that made you. You have five hours. On your marks\u2026 get set\u2026\" Maia closed her eyes for a fraction of a second, a silent prayer sent out to no one in particular. The chaos was behind her. The future was on this bench.\n\n\"BAKE!\"## Chapter 3\n\nThe sound of the starting call was a physical blow, a sonic boom that seemed to push all the air from Maia\u2019s lungs. Around her, the studio erupted into a quiet, purposeful hum. To her left, June, the retiree, was already tipping flour into a sifter, her movements economical and practiced. To her right, David the architect was laying out rulers and a set square against a piece of parchment paper, preparing to cut his sponges with surgical precision. They moved with the unhurried grace of people whose mornings had been calm, whose ingredients were resting at the perfect temperature in the on-set fridges. Maia, by contrast, felt like she was in the middle of a controlled demolition. Her bench was a disaster zone of half-unpacked bags and condensation-slicked containers.\n\nFor a terrifying, frozen moment, she couldn't move. Her mind was a white-out of panic. The five-hour clock on the large studio screen seemed to be mocking her, the red digits already counting down a life she was no longer living. Then, Mrs. Gable\u2019s voice, a gentle murmur from a long-ago memory, surfaced through the noise. *When the kitchen is chaos, dear girl, clean your station. A tidy bench is a tidy mind.* It wasn't a solution, but it was an action. With a surge of desperate energy, Maia began to move. She ripped the remaining containers from the cooler bags, sloshing water onto the floor. She slammed the bloomed chocolate onto a chopping board, threw the soupy cr\u00e8me p\u00e2tissi\u00e8re into a blast chiller, hoping the sudden shock of cold might slow its demise, and shoved the empty bags under her bench. It wasn't tidy, but it was a start. It was a declaration of war against the chaos.\n\nOne problem at a time. Liam\u2019s voice this time, steady and sure. The chocolate was the biggest problem. It was the foundation of her entire structure, the elegant, dark collars that would form the base of her sponge towers. Without their structural integrity, the entire edible skyline would collapse. There was no alternative but to re-temper the whole batch. With a heavy chef\u2019s knife, she began to attack the soft, chalky blocks of chocolate, the rhythmic *thump-thump-thump* on the board a counterpoint to the frantic beating of her heart. She worked with furious precision, her movements sharp and angry, chopping the chocolate into fine, even shards that would melt quickly. She filled a saucepan with an inch of water and set it on her induction hob, placing a glass bowl over the top. The science of it was a small, solid island in her sea of panic. Heat, but not too much. Melt two-thirds of the chocolate, stirring constantly. When it's smooth, take it off the heat, add the remaining third, the seed chocolate, to cool it down. Stir, stir, stir until it reaches the magic number. Thirty-one degrees Celsius for dark chocolate. A number she knew as well as her own name.\n\n\u201cQuite the dramatic entrance, Maia.\u201d A deep, familiar voice startled her. She looked up to see the judges, Paul and Sue, standing before her bench. Paul, the head judge, was a man whose formidable reputation was built on his piercing blue eyes and his intolerance for imperfection. His gaze swept over her chaotic bench, his lips a thin, unimpressed line. Sue, whose warmth was the perfect foil to Paul\u2019s steel, looked at her with genuine concern. \u201cSarah told us you had a bit of a breakdown. Are you alright, my dear?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m fine, thank you,\u201d Maia said, trying to keep her voice steady as she scraped the sides of her chocolate bowl. \u201cThe Biscuit decided to retire on the Northwestern Motorway, that\u2019s all.\u201d\n\nPaul leaned forward, his eyes narrowing on the bowl of melting chocolate. \u201cAnd your ingredients? I assume they weren't enjoying the morning sun.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome of them are a little\u2026 compromised,\u201d she admitted, refusing to let her gaze drop. \u201cI\u2019m having to re-temper my chocolate and I\u2019m hoping to salvage the cr\u00e8me p\u00e2tissi\u00e8re. I\u2019ve lost some time, but the plan is still the same.\u201d\n\n\u201cAmbitious,\u201d Paul noted, his tone giving nothing away. He gestured towards the sponges she\u2019d frantically unwrapped. \u201cYour Auckland skyline. The sponges are lemon and elderflower, the towers will be supported by these chocolate collars, and the Sky Tower is pulled sugar?\u201d She nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge undertaking on a good day, Maia. Today, it might just be impossible. You\u2019re leaving yourself with no room for error.\u201d His words were not cruel, but they were factual, and the truth of them landed like a lead weight in her gut.\n\n\u201cMaia has a habit of thriving under pressure, Paul,\u201d Sue interjected gently. \u201cHer opera cake in the semi-final was a masterclass in composure.\u201d She gave Maia a small, encouraging smile. \u201cJust focus on one step at a time. We\u2019ll be very interested to see if you can pull this off.\u201d They moved on, leaving a wake of silence behind them. Impossible. The word echoed in her head. She glanced at the clock. Thirty-five minutes gone. Thirty-five minutes, and all she had was a bowl of melting chocolate.\n\nWith the judges gone, she worked with a new intensity, fuelled by a potent mix of fear and spite. She would not let Paul be right. She would not be the sob story of the final. She focused on the thermometer in the chocolate, watching the numbers climb. Once the chocolate was melted, she pulled it from the heat and tipped in the remaining shards, beginning the crucial cooling process. The rhythmic scrape and fold of the spatula was hypnotic. While she stirred, she pulled the cr\u00e8me p\u00e2tissi\u00e8re from the blast chiller. It was colder, but still tragically loose. She tipped it into a metal bowl set over an ice bath and picked up a whisk. Then began the most gruelling task of all: re-emulsifying the custard by hand. Her arm screamed in protest as she whipped furiously, the thin, grainy mixture resisting her efforts. It was a battle of wills, her against a bowl of rogue starch molecules.\n\nMinutes blurred. Her world shrank to the bowl of chocolate, the bowl of custard, and the ticking clock. Out of the corner of her eye, she saw David begin to assemble his structure, a crystalline representation of Christchurch's Cardboard Cathedral, his movements maddeningly precise. June was piping a cascade of buttercream wisteria onto her bake, a tribute to Hamilton Gardens. They were building. She was still just fixing. Her arm ached, her back was stiff, and a single bead of sweat traced a path down her temple. Just as she felt her arm was about to give out, she felt a change in the custard. The whisk met more resistance. The liquid began to thicken, the grainy texture smoothing out. It was working. A small gasp of relief escaped her. It was thick, silky, and stable. She tasted it. Still delicious. She shoved it into the fridge, a small victory won.\n\nShe turned her full attention back to the chocolate. It was thick, glossy, and had cooled to thirty-three degrees. Almost there. She continued to stir, gently, patiently, nudging it down, degree by agonising degree. Thirty-two. Thirty-one point five. Finally, thirty-one. The magic number. There was no time to celebrate. She grabbed the acetate sheets she\u2019d cut for her collars and began to work, spreading the warm, liquid chocolate in smooth, even layers. Her hands, which had been shaking minutes before, were now rock-steady. This was her alchemy. This was her control. She worked quickly, the muscle memory from a thousand hours of practice taking over. As she placed the final, perfectly coated sheet onto a tray to set, she dipped a clean spatula into the leftover chocolate in the bowl and set it on the bench. The test. If it set quickly with a glossy finish and a sharp snap, she had done it. If it was dull or soft, the last hour of her life had been for nothing. She didn't have time to watch it. She had to trust the science. She had towers to build.With the chocolate work setting, there was no time to breathe. Maia turned to her sponges, her movements economical and stripped of all hesitation. She had three tall, cylindrical towers to build, representing the cluster of buildings at the heart of the city. She grabbed her serrated knife and began to torte the lemon and elderflower sponges, levelling the tops and slicing them into neat, even layers. The sweet, floral scent of the elderflower rose up to meet her, a familiar comfort. This was her territory.\n\nWhile her left hand sliced, her right hand was already pulling bowls from the fridge. The salvaged cr\u00e8me p\u00e2tissi\u00e8re, now beautifully thick and holding its shape, was dolloped into a piping bag. Her Italian meringue buttercream, which had mercifully survived the journey, was a cloud of pale, rose-scented perfection. She began to assemble the first tower with a speed that bordered on violent. A layer of sponge, a quick brush of lemon syrup to keep it moist, a perfect piped ring of buttercream to act as a dam, and then a generous filling of the elderflower cr\u00e8me p\u00e2t. Another layer of sponge, press down gently, repeat. Sponge, syrup, dam, fill. It became a mantra, a frantic, repetitive dance of hands and ingredients. She wasn\u2019t thinking, just doing. Her mind was blessedly empty of everything but the task in front of her.\n\nA camera operator drifted closer, the red light on his camera a small, intrusive eye. He zoomed in on her hands as she worked, capturing the blur of motion. She ignored him, her focus absolute. She glanced over at David\u2019s bench. His Cardboard Cathedral was already standing, a complex and beautiful structure of gingerbread panels held together with flawless royal icing. He was now painstakingly applying edible silver leaf to the details. June was arranging a tumble of glistening, sugared berries around the base of her wisteria-covered bake. They were on to decoration. She was still on construction. The thought, which should have sent a fresh spike of panic through her, was instead clarifying. It was her against the clock. Nothing else mattered.\n\nHer gaze fell on the spatula she\u2019d coated with the test chocolate. It was no longer a liquid smear. It was a solid, dark, gleaming shell. She picked it up. With a slight pressure from her thumb, it broke with a clean, sharp *snap*. The sound was as beautiful as a symphony. It was perfect. A surge of pure, unadulterated triumph shot through her, a hit of adrenaline more potent than caffeine. Paul could say it was impossible, the clock could count down to zero, but she had wrestled this chocolate into submission. She was back in the fight.\n\nThe three towers of sponge and cream stood on her bench, looking naked and vulnerable. The next step was the one she dreaded most. She carefully carried the tray of chocolate collars from the cooling rack. They had set into beautiful, semi-flexible sheets of glossy dark chocolate. This was the point of no return. If they cracked, or if they were too soft and smudged, the entire aesthetic of her bake would be ruined. She would have clean, modern towers or she would have a mess. Holding her breath, she picked up the first collar. She measured it against the tower, trimmed the top with a hot knife, and then, in one smooth, fluid motion, wrapped it around the cake. It was like dressing a doll, a very fragile, very edible doll. The acetate backing peeled away cleanly, revealing a flawless, gleaming chocolate surface. It held. It was perfect.\n\nOne down. Two to go. She repeated the process, her hands working with a new confidence. The second tower was wrapped just as smoothly. And then the third. They stood in a neat row, three sleek, dark cylinders filled with the promise of lemon and elderflower. They looked architectural, solid, intentional. They looked like the start of a skyline. She allowed herself the briefest glance at the clock. An hour and fifteen minutes had passed. She had lost so much time, but looking at the three towers standing proud on her bench, she hadn't just salvaged her bake. She had clawed her way back from disaster. Now for the hard part: making it a masterpiece.Now, for the artistry. The three towers were a bold, minimalist statement, but her vision was of the Auckland skyline at dawn, when the first light hits the city, painting it in soft, ethereal shades. This required the white chocolate glacage, a mirror glaze so notoriously temperamental that many professional pastry chefs avoided it. It needed to be fluid enough to pour in a thin, even sheet, yet viscous enough to cling to the sides of the towers without dripping into a puddle at the base. The temperature had to be exact, a narrow window of only a degree or two. Too hot, and it would be transparent and melt the chocolate collars beneath. Too cold, and it would be a thick, lumpy mess.\n\nWith the confidence of her small victory fuelling her, Maia worked with renewed focus. She bloomed her gelatin leaves in ice water while she gently heated a mixture of water, sugar, and glucose syrup. Once dissolved, she poured the hot liquid over a bowl of high-quality white chocolate and condensed milk, whisking until the chocolate melted completely. The mixture was a pale, creamy yellow. She added the softened gelatin and then, using an immersion blender held at a precise angle to avoid introducing air bubbles, she blitzed the glacage until it was impossibly smooth. The final touch was a few drops of titanium dioxide, a whitener that would turn the glaze a brilliant, opaque white. Now came the worst part: the waiting. The glaze had to cool to exactly thirty-five degrees Celsius. She set the bowl aside, a thermometer clipped to its side, and got to work arranging her towers on a wire rack set over a clean baking tray.\n\n\u201cFeeling brave today with a mirror glaze, I see!\u201d It was the host, a woman with a permanently sunny disposition and a love for a good baking pun. \u201cAre you hoping your chances are as smooth as your finish?\u201d\n\nMaia offered a tight, distracted smile, her eyes fixed on the thermometer. Thirty-eight degrees. \u201cSomething like that. Just hoping it doesn't turn into a sticky situation.\u201d The thermometer crept down. Thirty-seven. Thirty-six. The studio lights felt impossibly hot on the back of her neck. Come on. She gave the glaze a final, gentle stir. Thirty-five. Now. There was no time to hesitate. She lifted the bowl, her arm steady, and in one long, continuous motion, poured the pristine white liquid over the top of the first tower. It flowed down the sides like a sheet of liquid silk, clinging perfectly to the dark chocolate, a beautiful, stark contrast. She moved immediately to the second, then the third. The excess glaze pooled on the tray below, leaving three perfectly coated, gleaming white towers. They looked like polished marble. It had worked.\n\nThe final, and most terrifying, element was the Sky Tower. The crowning glory of her bake, a delicate, needle-thin shard of pulled isomalt sugar that had to be both elegant and structurally sound enough to stand on its own. This was where art met high-risk chemistry. She pulled on a pair of thick, heat-proof gloves and poured isomalt nibs into a heavy-bottomed pan, heating them until they melted into a clear, bubbling liquid that looked as innocuous as water but was hotter than boiling oil. Carefully, she poured the molten sugar onto a silicone mat to cool slightly. As soon as it was cool enough to handle\u2014a stage that lasted only a minute or two\u2014she began to work it. She pulled and folded the sugar, stretching it out into long ropes and looping it back on itself. The motion incorporated millions of tiny air bubbles, transforming the clear sugar into an opaque, pearlescent mass with the sheen of satin. It was hot, exhausting work. Her gloved hands burned with the radiant heat, and the muscles in her arms and back screamed in protest.\n\nWith the sugar pulled to a perfect satin finish, the race against time began. As it cooled, it would become brittle and unworkable. She had to shape it now. With swift, practiced movements, she began to stretch and taper the mass of sugar, her fingers gently coaxing it into the iconic shape of the Sky Tower. It was a dance of immense pressure and delicate touch. Too much force and it would shatter; too little and she would lose the shape. She formed the base, the main shaft, and finally, the delicate, needle-like spire at the very top. It was fragile, a whisper of spun sugar that looked as though a breath could destroy it. With infinite care, she transferred it to a clean mat to cool completely, her heart hammering in her chest.\n\nThe voice of the host boomed through the studio. \u201cBakers, you have two minutes remaining! Two minutes!\u201d The words jolted Maia from her sugar-induced trance. She looked at her bench. She had three white towers on a wire rack, a fragile sugar sculpture, and an empty presentation board. With frantic haste, she used a palette knife to lift each tower, one by one, and arrange them on the board, clustering them together to create a sense of a dense city center. Her hands were shaking now, the adrenaline of the last five hours hitting her all at once. She carefully lifted the isomalt Sky Tower. It felt weightless and terrifyingly fragile. She positioned it in the center of the cluster, its spire reaching high above the other buildings. It stood. It was a skyline. With the final seconds ticking away, she took a pinch of edible silver dust and blew it gently over the towers, a fine shimmer of light on a new day.\n\n\u201cTen, nine, eight\u2026\u201d The entire crew was counting down. Maia took a step back from her bench, her hands covered in chocolate, buttercream, and the ghosts of near-disasters. She looked at her creation. The Auckland skyline, born of chaos and desperation, stood proud and gleaming under the hot studio lights. It was everything she had imagined. It was ambitious. It was terrifying. And it was finished.\n\n\u201cThree, two, one\u2026 BAKE!\u201dThe moment the final \"BAKE!\" echoed through the studio, a profound silence fell over Maia's world. The frantic energy that had propelled her for five straight hours evaporated, leaving a hollow, buzzing exhaustion in its wake. Her legs felt unsteady, her arms as heavy as lead. She took a staggering step back from her bench, her gaze locked on the gleaming white and silver skyline she had somehow pulled from the jaws of disaster. It stood there, shimmering under the lights, a testament to a morning of sheer, unadulterated panic and a lifetime of clinging to the reliable alchemy of flour and sugar. It was her city, not the one that had ignored her, but the one she was claiming for herself, built from memory, hope, and a near-miraculous mirror glaze.\n\nThe studio slowly came back to life around her. A ripple of applause broke out from the crew members lining the walls. The other two finalists, June and David, were sagging against their own benches, their faces pale with a similar mix of relief and fatigue. Maia allowed her eyes to drift to their creations. June's tribute to the Hamilton Gardens was an explosion of life and colour. A multi-layered pistachio and rosewater cake formed a lush, green hillock, from which a cascade of impossibly delicate lavender buttercream wisteria flowers tumbled. Glistening, sugar-dusted berries were scattered at its base like fallen jewels. It was joyful, generous, and quintessentially June.\n\nThen there was David's. His showstopper was exactly what you would expect from a perfectionist architect. A scale model of Christchurch's Cardboard Cathedral, rendered in intricately spiced gingerbread and translucent panes of amber-coloured sugar glass. The lines were razor-sharp, the angles perfect, the royal icing piping so precise it looked as though it had been applied by a machine. It was a masterpiece of technical brilliance, a stunning, sombre tribute to resilience. Looking at the two of them, a fresh wave of doubt washed over Maia. June\u2019s bake had heart. David\u2019s had genius. Hers was just a story of survival.\n\nThe judges, trailed by the hosts, began their slow walk to the front of the tent for the final judging. They started with June. She explained her bake in her warm, bubbly voice, her hands fluttering with excitement. Paul cut into the cake, revealing perfect, even layers of pale green and pink. He nodded slowly as he chewed, his expression unreadable. \u201cThe pistachio is beautifully toasted, June,\u201d he said, his voice carrying through the silent studio. \u201cAnd the rosewater is there, but it\u2019s not fighting for attention. It\u2019s a garden party in a slice. Well done.\u201d Sue was even more effusive, praising the artistry of the buttercream flowers. June beamed, her face flushed with pride. The bar was set high.\n\nNext, they moved to David\u2019s bench. He stood ramrod straight, his hands clasped behind his back, as he explained the geometric principles behind his construction. Paul used a small hammer to tap one of the sugar glass panes, which shattered with a satisfying crackle. He examined a slice of the gingerbread. \u201cThe precision is, as we\u2019ve come to expect, flawless, David,\u201d Paul conceded. \u201cStructurally, it\u2019s an engineering marvel. The spicing in the gingerbread is complex and warming.\u201d He took a bite. \u201cIt\u2019s an incredible piece of work. My only slight critique is that it\u2019s almost\u2026 too perfect. It\u2019s a bake you admire more than you desire to eat.\u201d It was a small criticism, but a significant one. David\u2019s face tightened almost imperceptibly.\n\nThen, they were standing in front of her. All the cameras seemed to swivel in her direction, their dark lenses like a dozen unblinking eyes. Her heart, which had settled into a slow, heavy rhythm, began to pound against her ribs again. \u201cSo, Maia,\u201d Sue began, her voice soft. \u201cAuckland. Tell us what you\u2019ve made.\u201d\n\nMaia swallowed, her throat suddenly dry. \u201cThis is the Auckland skyline at dawn,\u201d she began, her voice barely a whisper. She cleared her throat and tried again, forcing strength into her words. \u201cIt\u2019s a city I know in my bones, but one that\u2019s never quite felt like mine. I wanted to build my own version of it, a place of possibility. The towers are lemon and elderflower sponge, filled with cr\u00e8me p\u00e2tissi\u00e8re and an Italian meringue buttercream. They\u2019re encased in tempered dark chocolate and a white chocolate mirror glaze. And the Sky Tower is pulled isomalt.\u201d She didn't mention the car, the motorway, the melting ingredients. She wanted the bake to stand on its own, not as an excuse.\n\nPaul leaned in, his piercing gaze scrutinising every detail. He ran a finger over the base of one tower, then inspected his fingertip. It was clean. The glaze had set perfectly. He peered at the delicate sugar tower, its spire so fine it was almost invisible. \u201cYou had a catastrophic start to your day,\u201d he stated, looking up to meet her eyes. \u201cAnd you chose to attempt not one, but three of the most difficult techniques in patisserie. Re-tempering chocolate under pressure, a mirror glaze, and pulled sugar work. Were you trying to fail?\u201d\n\n\u201cI was trying to win,\u201d she replied, the answer surprising even herself with its boldness.\n\nA flicker of something\u2014respect, perhaps\u2014crossed his face. He picked up a long, sharp knife. The studio was so quiet she could hear the faint hum of the lighting rigs. He positioned the knife over the tallest tower and, with one clean, decisive movement, sliced straight down. There was a sharp crack as the knife broke through the tempered chocolate collar, followed by the soft sigh of it gliding through sponge and cream. He pulled the slice away, revealing a perfect cross-section. The layers were even, the filling was contained, the dark chocolate and white glaze forming a perfect, clean frame. She had done it.\n\nHe placed the slice on a plate and pushed it towards Sue before taking one for himself. Sue took the first bite, her eyes closing in concentration. A slow smile spread across her face. \u201cOh, Maia,\u201d she said softly. \u201cThat\u2019s beautiful. The elderflower is so fragrant, and the lemon cuts through the richness of the buttercream perfectly. It tastes like spring. And your cr\u00e8me p\u00e2tissi\u00e8re\u2026 it\u2019s like silk. Absolutely flawless.\u201d\n\nNow it was Paul\u2019s turn. He tapped the chocolate collar with his fork, which broke with another satisfying snap. He took a forkful that included every element\u2014glaze, chocolate, sponge, and filling. He chewed slowly, his expression a mask of intense concentration. He swallowed. The silence stretched, becoming thin and unbearable. Maia felt as though her entire life was suspended in that single moment of judgement.\n\n\u201cThe sponge,\u201d he said finally, his voice measured, \u201cis incredibly light. The syrup is well-judged. The chocolate has the snap. The glaze is perfect. The fillings are balanced.\u201d He laid his fork down. \u201cYou were forty-five minutes behind, with compromised ingredients. What you have produced here is not just technically brilliant\u2026 it is, frankly, impossible.\u201d He looked directly at her, and for the first time, his blue eyes were not judging her, but simply seeing her. \u201cYou didn\u2019t just build a skyline, Maia. You fought a battle on this bench today. And you won.\u201d\n\nA choked sob escaped Maia\u2019s lips. She pressed her hands to her mouth, the tears she had held back all day finally spilling over, hot and cleansing. Through the blur, she saw Liam in the small, cordoned-off audience section. He was on his feet, his face split in a wide, triumphant grin, shouting something she couldn't hear. The exhaustion, the fear, the desperate hope\u2014it all poured out of her. Whatever happened next, whatever the final result, Paul\u2019s words were enough. She had faced down the chaos and created something beautiful. She had built her home.## Chapter 4\n\nThe minutes that followed the judging were a strange, timeless limbo. The three of them, Maia, June, and David, were gently ushered away from their benches and into a small, quiet green room off the main studio. The adrenaline had completely abandoned them, leaving behind a profound, bone-deep weariness. June sank onto a soft sofa and let out a long, shuddering sigh. David, for the first time all day, leaned against a wall, his perfect posture finally breaking. Maia just stood in the middle of the room, feeling strangely disconnected from her own body, as if she were watching herself from a great distance. The silence wasn\u2019t awkward; it was a shared space of immense, unspoken respect. They had been competitors, but now, on the other side of the battle, they were simply three people who had survived the same beautiful, terrifying ordeal.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d June said finally, her voice raspy with emotion. \u201cI need a very large gin. And a very long nap.\u201d She smiled at Maia, her eyes shining with unshed tears. \u201cYour bake, my dear. It was just\u2026 breathtaking. When Paul\u2019s voice cracked, I think my heart stopped.\u201d\n\nDavid pushed himself off the wall and walked over to Maia. He looked her directly in the eye, his usually stern face softened by exhaustion and something that looked like genuine admiration. \u201cHe was right. It was impossible. I was watching you. I wouldn\u2019t have thought it could be done.\u201d He extended a hand. \u201cCongratulations on a phenomenal bake, Maia. You earned every word of that praise.\u201d Maia took his hand, surprised by the warmth and strength of his grip. In that moment, the result didn\u2019t seem to matter as much. To have earned the respect of this brilliant, exacting man felt like a victory in itself.\n\nTheir quiet truce was broken by the return of Sarah, the production assistant, her headset firmly in place. \u201cIt\u2019s time,\u201d she said, her voice softer than it had been all day. \u201cThey\u2019re ready for you.\u201d The three of them shared a final, weighted look before following her back into the glare of the studio lights. The crew, the judges, and the hosts were all assembled in the center of the room, arranged in a semi-circle. The three winning showstoppers were displayed on a table in front of them, looking like edible museum pieces. Maia, June, and David were guided to stand in a line, facing the judges, their hands clasped in front of them in a subconscious echo of each other. The air was thick with anticipation. Maia focused on a scuff mark on the floor, her heart thumping a slow, heavy rhythm that she could feel in her throat.\n\nSue stepped forward, her smile warm and encompassing all three of them. \u201cBefore we announce the winner,\u201d she began, her voice full of emotion, \u201cwe just want to say what an extraordinary final this has been. June, your bake was a masterpiece of joy and artistry, a testament to a lifetime of skill and love. David, your creation was a work of architectural genius, a tribute filled with precision and power.\u201d Her gaze landed on Maia, and her smile deepened. \u201cAnd Maia, yours was a story of pure, unadulterated grit. You showed us that sometimes the most beautiful things are born from the most chaotic of circumstances.\u201d\n\nPaul took a step forward, his hands clasped behind his back. He looked at each of them in turn, his gaze intense. \u201cThe standard this year has been the highest we have ever seen. Any one of you would be a worthy winner. But a decision had to be made.\u201d He paused, and in that split second of silence, Maia\u2019s entire life seemed to flash before her eyes: the grey walls of St. Cuthbert\u2019s, the scent of flour in Mrs Gable\u2019s warm kitchen, the rattling engine of The Biscuit, the gleam of her finished skyline under the lights. \u201cWe judged on technical skill, on artistry, and on flavour. But today, we also judged on something more. We judged on heart.\u201d He took a deep breath. \u201cThe winner of the Great Kiwi Bake Off\u2026 is Maia.\u201d\n\nThe name didn\u2019t compute. It was just a sound, a word she knew belonged to her but which felt utterly foreign in this context. It hung in the air, shimmering and unreal, just like the words on the finalist letter. She saw Liam leap to his feet. She saw the judges smiling. She felt June\u2019s arms wrap around her in a fierce, loving hug. She heard the thunderous applause and the sudden, explosive pop of confetti cannons, which sent a shower of shimmering silver paper raining down around them. But it was all happening on the other side of a thick pane of glass. It wasn't until David shook her hand again, a wide, genuine smile on his face, that the first crack appeared in the glass. And when Liam barrelled through the crew and wrapped her in a hug that lifted her clean off the floor, the glass shattered completely.\n\n\u201cYOU DID IT, HART! YOU ACTUALLY, BLOODY DID IT!\u201d he yelled into her ear, his voice hoarse with emotion. He smelled of oil and victory. She buried her face in his shoulder, her body shaking with silent, heaving sobs of pure, unadulterated joy. He was her family, her foundation, and he was here to see her win. This was real. It was all real. When he finally set her down, Sue was standing there with a large, heavy glass trophy shaped like a stylized whisk. Her name was engraved on its base. A moment later, Paul was beside her, holding a comically oversized cheque. The numbers seemed to dance before her eyes: One Hundred Thousand Dollars.\n\nHer hands were shaking so badly she could barely hold the trophy. She stared at the cheque, at the clean, printed letters of her own name, Maia Hart. It wasn\u2019t just money. It was a key. It was the sea-green door of a little caf\u00e9 in Devonport. It was the scent of coffee and cardamom buns. It was a foundation, solid and real, that she had built for herself with sugar, butter, and a will of pure iron. She looked up and caught her reflection in the glass of the trophy. A tear-streaked, confetti-dusted, utterly exhausted girl stared back at her. A girl who was no longer a ghost in her own city. She was a baker. She was a winner. She thought of Mrs Gable, and a fresh wave of tears welled. *Thank you*, she whispered to the quiet memory of the woman who had first put a spoon in her hand. *This was for you.*\n\nMuch later, when the lights had been dimmed and the confetti swept away, the vast studio was quiet and cavernous. Most of the crew had gone home, leaving only a skeleton staff to finish packing up. Maia, changed out of her flour-dusted clothes and back into her jeans, stood before the wreckage of her showstopper. Someone had cut away more slices for the crew to share, leaving her skyline looking like a city after an earthquake. Liam appeared at her side, carrying a cardboard box with her mixing bowls and lucky apron inside. \u201cReady to go, champ?\u201d he asked softly. He gestured with his chin towards the cake. \u201cSome day you\u2019ve had.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have no idea,\u201d she breathed, a tired, happy laugh bubbling up inside her. She looked at the half-demolished towers, the broken shard of the Sky Tower lying on its side. It wasn\u2019t a disaster anymore. It was a monument. It was the day she had faced down the chaos and won. Liam slung a companionable arm around her shoulders. \u201cCome on. I\u2019ll give you a lift. The ute might smell of desperation, but she runs.\u201d Maia leaned her head against his shoulder, the oversized cheque tucked safely under her arm. As they walked out of the studio and into the cool, dark night, she thought of The Biscuit, sitting alone in an impound lot somewhere. She would get her back tomorrow. Maybe she\u2019d even pay to have the engine properly fixed. For the first time in her life, the road ahead didn\u2019t feel like a dangerous, unpredictable motorway. It was a quiet street, leading down to the sea. It was a straight shot, a direct line from here to the start of the rest of her life. And this time, nothing could possibly go wrong.## Chapter 5\n\nThe first thing Maia was aware of was the light. It wasn\u2019t the usual thin, grey light that filtered through the single window of her shoebox flat, but a soft, golden haze, diffused by the dusty leaves of a large p\u014dhutukawa tree outside. She was lying on a sofa that smelled faintly of Liam\u2019s dog, Buster, and was cocooned in an old, scratchy wool blanket. For a moment, she was disoriented, the events of the previous day a jumbled, fantastical dream. Then her eyes landed on the coffee table. The heavy glass trophy sat there, its polished surface catching the morning light and fracturing it into a dozen tiny rainbows on the ceiling. Beside it, propped up against a stack of car magazines, was the oversized cheque. Maia Hart. One Hundred Thousand Dollars. It was real. A low, breathless laugh escaped her, a sound of pure wonder in the quiet of the small living room.\n\nShe had no memory of getting here. She vaguely recalled Liam steering her through a throng of well-wishers, the weight of the trophy in her arms, the crinkle of the cheque, and then the familiar rattle of his ute. He must have taken one look at her shell-shocked face and decided her tiny, lonely flat was no place for her to be. He\u2019d guided her inside his small house in Avondale, sat her on the sofa, and put a mug of sweet tea in her hands before she\u2019d promptly fallen asleep, the TV still murmuring in the background. Now, in the quiet of the morning, the enormity of it all began to sink in, not as a tidal wave of emotion, but as a slow, steady tide rising within her. The frantic energy was gone, replaced by a deep, resonant calm. It felt like the moment after you pull a perfect cake from the oven, when the kitchen is warm and fragrant and filled with a sense of quiet accomplishment.\n\nThe sound of clattering in the kitchen was followed by the rich, comforting scent of coffee. Liam appeared in the doorway, a mug in each hand. He was still in yesterday\u2019s grease-stained overalls, his hair sticking up at odd angles. He looked as exhausted and happy as she felt. He gave her a slow, sleepy smile. \u201cMorning, champ. Thought you might be needing this.\u201d He handed her a mug. It was hot and strong, exactly how she liked it. He sat down in the battered armchair opposite her, his gaze lingering on the trophy. \u201cStill doesn\u2019t feel real, does it?\u201d\n\nMaia shook her head, clutching the warm mug in both hands. \u201cNo. I keep expecting to wake up on the side of the motorway.\u201d They sat in a comfortable silence for a few minutes, just sipping their coffee, the shared quiet more intimate than any conversation. Liam finally broke it, his voice practical. \u201cSo. First things first. We gotta go bail The Biscuit out of jail. She\u2019s at the impound yard in Henderson. Then, I reckon, a proper celebration. My treat. Fish and chips on the beach?\u201d\n\nThe mundanity of it was perfect. After the glamour and the pressure and the confetti, the thought of retrieving her sad, broken-down car felt grounding. It was a link between the extraordinary day she\u2019d just had and the ordinary life she was about to build. \u201cOkay,\u201d she agreed, a real smile spreading across her face. \u201cBut I\u2019m paying for the fish and chips. I think I can afford it.\u201d The words felt strange and wonderful on her tongue.\n\nThe impound yard was as grim as its name suggested. A vast, soulless expanse of asphalt enclosed by a high chain-link fence, it was a graveyard for cars that had met unfortunate ends. The air smelled of hot tarmac and defeat. After navigating a bureaucratic maze of paperwork and paying a fee that made her wince, a forklift trundled out and deposited The Biscuit in a designated pick-up zone. Her little sea-mist green car looked even smaller and more pathetic than Maia remembered, covered in a fine layer of dust, a bright yellow impound sticker slapped on its windscreen. A pang of unexpected affection went through her. This car had been her first taste of freedom, her partner in crime. It had failed her at the worst possible moment, but it had also carried her towards the start of her new life.\n\nLiam popped the bonnet with the weary familiarity of a doctor examining a chronically ill patient. He poked and prodded for a few minutes, his expression grim. \u201cYep. Alternator\u2019s completely fried. Probably took the battery with it. She\u2019s not going anywhere under her own steam.\u201d He sighed, wiping his hands on a rag. \u201cI\u2019ll get her towed to the workshop. I can fix her up, but it\u2019ll take a few days.\u201d He looked at Maia. \u201cSo, plans have changed. I\u2019m your chauffeur for the day. Where to, Miss Hart? The world is your oyster.\u201d\n\nMaia looked from her broken-down car to Liam\u2019s solid, reassuring presence. She should have been frustrated, but she wasn't. It was just another problem to be solved, and for the first time, she had the resources to solve it without panic. She thought of the oversized cheque, now safely tucked into her bag. An idea, bold and exciting, began to form. \u201cYou know where I\u2019ve always wanted to go?\u201d she said, a new energy in her voice. \u201cDevonport.\u201d\n\nLiam raised a greasy eyebrow. \u201cThe fancy place with the old houses? What\u2019s in Devonport?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy future,\u201d she said, and the word didn\u2019t sound foolish or naive. It sounded like a plan. \u201cLet\u2019s just go for a drive. Let\u2019s go and see the sea.\u201d\n\nThe ferry ride from the city to Devonport was a short journey into another world. The bustling, modern metropolis of glass and steel gave way to a quaint, village-like suburb nestled on the North Shore. White-painted Victorian villas with intricate fretwork lined the streets, their gardens overflowing with roses and hydrangeas. The pace of life seemed slower here, more deliberate. As they walked along the main street, the air was salty and clean. Maia\u2019s gaze darted everywhere, taking in the small, independent bookshops, the art galleries, and the cafes with their tables spilling onto the pavement. It was exactly as she had pictured it. Better, even.\n\n\u201cI could live here,\u201d she breathed, stopping to look at a small bakery. Through the window, she could see a baker dusting a tray of croissants with icing sugar. She could almost smell the warm, yeasty air, feel the flour under her fingernails.\n\n\u201cYou could,\u201d Liam agreed, watching her face. \u201cYou could do anything you want.\u201d\n\nThey ambled down a side street that led towards the water, away from the main tourist hub. The shops here were quieter, a little older. And then she saw it. Tucked between a real estate agent and a shop selling nautical-themed homewares was a small, vacant storefront. It was sad and neglected, the paint on its window frames peeling, the glass dusty. A faded \u2018For Lease\u2019 sign was taped to the inside of the door, its edges curled with age. It wasn't grand or beautiful, but it had a wide front window perfect for displaying cakes, and a deep-set doorway that offered shelter from the rain. The door itself was a mess of flaking, pale blue paint. But Maia looked at it and saw something else entirely. She saw it painted a deep, welcoming sea-green. She saw her name, handwritten in gold leaf on the glass. She saw a warm light spilling out onto the pavement on a grey afternoon.\n\nShe walked right up to the glass and peered inside, her hands cupped around her face to block the glare. The interior was a dusty, empty shell, but she could see the shape of it. A long, narrow space, perfect for a counter along one side, with a few small tables along the other. There was even a small, separate room at the back that could be the kitchen. It was a blank canvas. It was a foundation. \u201cLiam,\u201d she said, her voice quiet with awe. \u201cLook.\u201d\n\nHe came to stand beside her, peering in. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a wreck, Hart. Needs a lot of work.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s perfect,\u201d she whispered, a grin spreading across her face. It wasn\u2019t the end of a journey. It wasn\u2019t a finish line. It was a starting block. The competition, the prize money, the trophy\u2014they had all just been ingredients. This was the bake. The rest of her life. She pulled her phone from her pocket and, with a hand that was perfectly steady, she took a photo of the phone number on the \u2018For Lease\u2019 sign.The first thing Maia was aware of was the light. It wasn\u2019t the usual thin, grey light that filtered through the single window of her shoebox flat, but a soft, golden haze, diffused by the dusty leaves of a large p\u014dhutukawa tree outside.

There was even a small, separate room at the back that could be the kitchen. It was a blank canvas. It was a foundation. \u201cLiam,\u201d she said, her voice quiet with awe. \u201cLook.\u201d\n\nHe came to stand beside her, peering in. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a wreck, Hart. Needs a lot of work.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s perfect,\u201d she whispered, a grin spreading across her face. It wasn\u2019t the end of a journey. It wasn\u2019t a finish line. It was a starting block. The competition, the prize money, the trophy\u2014they had all just been ingredients. This was the bake. The rest of her life. She pulled her phone from her pocket and, with a hand that was perfectly steady, she took a photo of the phone number on the \u2018For Lease\u2019 sign.## Chapter 6\n\nLiam watched her, a half-smile playing on his lips as she stared at the photograph on her phone. He could see the cogs turning in her head, the same focused, intense look she got when she was mapping out the complex architecture of a multi-layered cake. He recognised the shift from dreamer to doer. \"You're going to call it, aren't you?\" he said, not as a question, but as a statement of fact. \"Right now.\"\n\n\"There's no point waiting,\" Maia replied, her thumb already hovering over the call button. The chaos of the past twenty-four hours had burned away a layer of lifelong hesitation she hadn't even realised was there. She had won. She had the money. The only thing standing between her and this dusty, neglected shop was a phone call, and after facing down Paul's terrifyingly silent judgement, a real estate agent held no fear for her. She pressed the button and held the phone to her ear, her heart giving a little skip as it began to ring.\n\nA gruff, world-weary voice answered on the third ring. \"Henderson.\"\n\n\"Hello,\" Maia began, forcing a confidence she didn't entirely feel into her voice. \"My name is Maia Hart. I'm calling about the commercial property for lease on King Edward Parade in Devonport.\"\n\nThere was a huff on the other end of the line. \"The old dairy? Been empty for the better part of a year. You sure you're calling about the right place, love? It's a bit of a fixer-upper.\"\n\n\"I'm standing outside it right now,\" she said steadily. \"I'm very interested. I was wondering if it would be possible to see the inside today?\"\n\nThere was a pause, and Maia could hear the rustle of papers. \"Today? Keen, aren't you? Look, I'm on the Shore already. Got a valuation in Takapuna in an hour. I can swing by in about twenty minutes if you're serious.\"\n\n\"Twenty minutes is perfect,\" Maia said, a thrill running through her. \"We'll be here.\" She hung up, a wide, incredulous grin spreading across her face. \"He's coming. In twenty minutes.\"\n\nLiam whistled, low and long. \"Things are moving fast, Hart. You sure about this? We haven't even had our celebratory fish and chips.\" But his eyes were crinkling with pride, and he nudged her shoulder with his. \"Okay. Let's do a pre-game analysis. What are we looking for?\"\n\n\"You're looking for dodgy wiring, rising damp, and structural impossibilities,\" Maia retorted, her smile not faltering. \"I'm looking for the ghost of a floor plan and enough space for a double-stack convection oven.\"\n\nExactly nineteen minutes later, a sensible silver sedan pulled up and a man who looked exactly like his voice sounded got out. Mr. Henderson was in his late sixties, with a crumpled suit, a kind but tired face, and a handshake like a vice. He grunted a hello and fumbled with a large ring of keys, eventually finding the one that fit the grimy lock. The door opened with a groan of protest, releasing a wave of stale, dusty air. He flicked a switch by the door, and a single, bare bulb flickered to life, illuminating the cavernous space. It was worse than she'd imagined. The linoleum on the floor was cracked and peeling, revealing dark, stained concrete beneath. The walls were a patchwork of dirty cream paint and shadowy outlines where shelves and coolers had once stood. A long, dilapidated counter ran down one side, its formica top chipped and stained.\n\nLiam immediately went into mechanic mode, his gaze sweeping the ceiling. \"Water damage in that corner,\" he announced, pointing. \"And these outlets look pre-historic. You'd need to completely rewire the place to run commercial appliances. And the plumbing for the sinks and a coffee machine...\" He trailed off, shaking his head.\n\nBut Maia was barely listening. She stepped past him, her footsteps echoing in the empty room. She walked to the back, where a doorway led into another, smaller room. It was dark and smelled of mouse droppings, but it was a decent size. She could see it all. This would be the kitchen, her engine room. A long stainless-steel bench here for prep, the ovens against that wall, the sinks over there. Out in the main space, she would rip out the lino and polish the concrete floor. The ugly counter would go, replaced with a warm, solid timber one. The walls would be painted a clean, gallery white to make the space feel bigger. Little round tables for two would line the wall opposite the counter. She walked to the large front window, dusty as it was, and looked out at the street. She could see people walking by, the ferry gliding into the wharf, the green cone of North Head in the distance. The light was beautiful, even on this overcast day. It was perfect.\n\n\"It's a lot of work,\" Mr. Henderson said from the doorway, watching her with a shrewd expression. \"Last two tenants, a vape shop and a souvenir store, didn't even last six months. It's a tough spot.\"\n\nMaia turned to face him, her eyes shining with a conviction that took both him and Liam by surprise. \"They were selling the wrong thing,\" she said simply. \"This street doesn't need another souvenir shop. It needs a place that smells like coffee and fresh bread. It needs a place for people to come and sit on a rainy day with a cup of tea and a piece of cake that makes them feel better. I can make that place.\" She took a deep breath. \"I know it needs work. I won the Great Kiwi Bake Off yesterday. The prize money is my start-up capital. I'm not afraid of hard work, and I have the funds for the bond, the first few months' rent, and the renovations. I want it.\"\n\nMr. Henderson's bushy eyebrows shot up. \"The Bake Off? With the scary judge? My wife, Shirley, she was glued to it. She'd kill me if she knew I was here.\" A slow smile spread across his face, transforming his gruff features. \"The girl with the car trouble? The one who made the skyline? That was you?\" Maia nodded, her cheeks flushing. He let out a bark of a laugh. \"Well, I'll be. Shirley said you had guts.\" He looked around the dusty shop again, but this time he seemed to be seeing it through her eyes. \"You know what? This old place needs someone with guts.\" He named a monthly figure for the rent that was surprisingly, almost shockingly, reasonable. \"And look, you sign a two-year lease, and I'll give you the first two months rent-free. For renovations. Can't have Shirley's favourite baker serving cakes out of a hovel, can I?\"\n\nMaia stared at him, speechless. The simple, unexpected kindness of it almost made her want to cry again. She looked at Liam, who was grinning so wide it looked like his face might split. \"I'll take it,\" she said, her voice thick with emotion. \"Thank you, Mr. Henderson. Thank you.\"\n\nAn hour later, they were sitting on a bench on the Devonport waterfront, a warm, greasy parcel of fish and chips open between them. In Maia's bag was a freshly signed lease agreement, and in her hand was a single, solitary key. The key to her future. It felt impossibly heavy. She looked across the sparkling water at the city skyline she had so painstakingly recreated in sugar and hope. From here, it looked different. Smaller. More distant. Her world was no longer over there. It was right here, in this quiet village, in the promise of a dusty, empty shop and the key that was growing warm in her palm.\n\n\"So,\" Liam said, nudging her with his elbow as he stole one of her chips. \"You've got the prize, you've got the shop, you've got the world's best mechanic on speed dial for when you inevitably block the drains with buttercream.\" He grinned. \"What are you going to call it?\"\n\nMaia looked at the key, then back at the water. She thought of Mrs Gable's faded recipe book, held together with yellowing tape. She thought of the warmth of her kitchen, the first place she had ever felt safe, the first place that had ever felt like a home. A name came to her, simple and true, a quiet tribute and a public promise. \"The Gable,\" she said softly. \"I'm going to call it The Gable.\"## Chapter 6\n\nLiam went very still, a chip halfway to his mouth. He looked at her, then out at the water, then back at her face, which was illuminated by a quiet, steady certainty. \"The Gable,\" he repeated softly, the name settling between them. \"Of course.\" It wasn't a question or a statement of surprise, but an acknowledgement of something that, once spoken, felt like it had always been true. It was more than a tribute; it was an anchor, securing her terrifyingly new future to the one part of her past that had been safe and warm. It gave her dream a history, a soul. He put the chip down and nudged her gently with his shoulder, a silent gesture of profound understanding that said more than a hundred words of encouragement ever could. In that moment, sitting on a public bench with a parcel of greasy paper between them, they felt less like two orphans who had found each other and more like a family laying the first stone of a home.\n\nThey finished their food in a comfortable silence, the gulls crying overhead, the salty air crisp and clean. But the quiet pull of the shop was irresistible. It was one thing to hold the key; it was another to use it. They walked back down the quiet side street, their footsteps echoing slightly. Standing before the flaking blue door, Maia\u2019s hand trembled as she slid the cool metal key into the lock. It was stiff from disuse, and for a heart-stopping second, she thought it wouldn't turn. Then, with a firm twist from Liam\u2019s hand over hers, there was a loud, satisfying clunk as the old lock gave way. She pushed the door open and stepped inside, not as a hopeful spectator, but as the proprietor. The air was thick with the scent of dust and damp and decay, but to Maia, it smelled like potential. It smelled like hers.\n\nThe initial awe quickly gave way to the daunting reality of the task ahead. The single bare bulb did little to flatter the peeling walls and the grimy floor. The space, which had seemed full of promise from the outside, now felt overwhelmingly dilapidated. Liam, ever the pragmatist, had already retrieved a notepad and a stubby pencil from the glovebox of his ute. He walked the perimeter of the room, making notes, his brow furrowed in concentration. \u201cOkay,\u201d he said, tapping the pencil against his teeth. \u201cThe wiring is a total write-off, you\u2019ll need a commercial electrician. Same for the plumbing; we\u2019ll need to run new lines for a three-compartment sink and a coffee machine hook-up. That back wall is load-bearing, so we can\u2019t knock it through to the kitchen, but we can widen the doorway. And this floor\u2026\u201d He scuffed at the curling linoleum with his boot. \u201cIt\u2019ll take a grinder and a whole lot of elbow grease to get this back to polished concrete.\u201d\n\nAs he spoke, Maia felt a cold knot of panic begin to form in her stomach. The list grew longer with every observation. Electrician, plumber, grinder, permits, licenses, equipment. The hundred thousand dollars, which had felt like an impossible fortune just hours ago, began to shrink with terrifying speed. She pictured the gleaming, stainless-steel convection ovens she\u2019d coveted in magazines, the beautiful espresso machine, the planetary mixer. Each item was a monumental expense. This wasn't like baking a cake, where the steps were clear and the outcome, if you were careful, was guaranteed. This was a vast, sprawling project with a thousand ways to fail. The old, familiar fear, the one that whispered she wasn\u2019t good enough, that the world would always pull the rug out from under her, began to creep back in.\n\nLiam must have seen the colour drain from her face. He stopped his relentless cataloguing of problems and put a hand on her shoulder. \u201cHey,\u201d he said gently. \u201cOne thing at a time, Hart. Remember? Today, we don't worry about the plumbing or the wiring. Today, we make a start. Today, we just make some noise.\u201d He grinned, a flash of white in his grease-smudged face. \u201cLet's go smash something.\u201d He disappeared out to his ute and returned a moment later with a crowbar and a pair of heavy-duty work gloves, tossing the gloves to her. The simple, physical task was an antidote to her spiralling anxiety. Together, they attacked the long, ugly counter. It was a battle. The formica splintered, old nails screeched in protest as Liam wrenched them from the wood, and decades of accumulated dust rained down on them. It was filthy, exhausting, back-breaking work, and it was the most fun Maia had had in years. With a final, groan of splintering timber, the last section of the counter crashed to the floor. They stood back, panting and covered in grime, in a space that was suddenly twice as big and full of light. They hadn't just cleared a counter; they had demolished the past, making way for the future.\n\nThe noise had not gone unnoticed. An elderly woman with a cloud of perfectly coiffed white hair and bright, inquisitive eyes poked her head around the door. \u201cGoodness me, what\u2019s all the commotion? I thought this old place was going to crumble into the sea.\u201d Her gaze fell on Maia, and her eyes widened in recognition. \u201cWait a minute. You\u2019re\u2026 you\u2019re the cake girl! From the television! Shirley! It\u2019s me, Shirley Henderson. My husband, Bill, he leased you the shop! Oh, he\u2019ll be so thrilled I met you. I told him you had spunk!\u201d She bustled in, holding a tartan-patterned flask. \u201cI was just on my way to my garden club, but I saw the lights on and heard the racket. I brought you both a cup of tea. You look like you could use it.\u201d She poured two cups of steaming, milky tea into plastic cups she produced from a cavernous handbag, chattering away about Maia\u2019s rose and pistachio Battenberg. It was the first time a stranger had spoken to her not with pity or professional detachment, but with genuine warmth and excitement. She was no longer Maia Hart, the orphan from nowhere; she was Shirley\u2019s favourite baker, a new, welcome part of the fabric of this village.\n\nAs evening fell, painting the sky outside in shades of orange and purple, Liam packed his tools away. The shop was transformed. A huge pile of splintered wood and debris sat in one corner, ready to be hauled away, but the rest of the space was open and clear. It was no longer a sad, abandoned dairy; it was a building site, humming with the promise of what was to come. \u201cNot a bad day\u2019s work,\u201d Liam said, surveying their handiwork with satisfaction. \u201cI\u2019ll get a skip bin delivered tomorrow. You sure you\u2019re okay to get home? I can give you a lift.\u201d Maia shook her head. Her own flat above the laundromat felt a million miles away. \u201cI think I\u2019m going to stay for a bit,\u201d she said. \u201cJust\u2026 to think.\u201d He understood. With a final, tired grin, he left, promising to be back in the morning.\n\nMaia was alone. She walked to the center of the empty room, the single key now feeling warm and familiar in her pocket. The setting sun streamed through the filthy front window, casting long, golden shafts of light through the dancing dust motes. She ran her hand along a section of the wall where the old counter had been, feeling the rough texture of the exposed brick beneath the peeling paint. She thought of Mrs Gable's kitchen, a place of warmth and science and safety. This was different. This was bigger and scarier and entirely her own. She was tired, she ached in muscles she didn't know she had, and she was covered in a century of dust. But as she stood there, in the quiet heart of her chaotic, beautiful, perfect mess, she felt a profound sense of peace settle over her. She was home.## Chapter 7\n\nThe next morning, Maia returned to the shop before the sun had fully risen over North Head. She let herself in with her own key, the sound of the lock echoing in the pre-dawn stillness. In the grey light, the destruction of the previous day looked less like a triumph and more like a terrible mistake. The mountain of splintered wood and broken formica seemed larger, the dust thicker, the emptiness of the space more profound. The initial thrill of demolition had worn off, leaving a sober reality in its place. This wasn't just a symbolic act; it was a real mess, and she was the one who had to clean it up. For a moment, she felt a pang of nostalgia for the simplicity of her old life, for mornings that began with the familiar science of sourdough starter rather than the overwhelming chaos of a building site.\n\nBut she was a baker, and a baker\u2019s trade was turning chaos into order. Pushing down the flicker of apprehension, she found a relatively clean patch of floor, sat down cross-legged, and pulled a fresh, crisp notebook and a pen from her bag. This was a language she understood. She opened to the first page and wrote *The Gable* at the top in neat, careful letters. Beneath it, she began to break the monumental task down into manageable steps, just as she would deconstruct a complex recipe. The page divided into columns: 'Must-Haves', 'Nice-to-Haves', 'Liam Jobs', and 'Pro Jobs'. Under 'Must-Haves', she wrote *Double-stack convection oven, 20qt planetary mixer, commercial coffee machine, sinks, refrigeration*. Each item was a small word representing a mountain of research and a terrifyingly large sum of money. The 'Pro Jobs' list was even more daunting: *Full electrical re-wire, commercial plumbing installation, ventilation/extraction system*. She was building a home one gingerbread brick at a time, but it turned out the bricks were made of gold and held together with council permits.\n\nOn the next page, she wrote the number '$100,000' at the top. It looked magnificent for a single, glorious second. Then, with a grim sense of purpose, she began the subtractions. She deducted the bond and the first month's rent she would owe once the free period was over. She pencilled in a rough, terrifying estimate for the electrical and plumbing work based on a frantic internet search the night before. She added another large sum for the extraction system, a legal necessity she hadn't even considered. Suddenly, her fortune had been cut in half before she had even bought a single spatula. The remaining number looked shockingly small, unequal to the task of filling this empty shell with the gleaming, reliable equipment of her dreams. The old panic, cold and familiar, began to prickle at the edges of her resolve.\n\nHer anxious trance was broken by a loud, metallic bang from the street that made her jump. A moment later, Liam\u2019s lanky frame filled the doorway, silhouetted against the rising sun. He was holding two steaming takeaway coffees and grinning. \u201cThe cavalry, and a large yellow skip bin, have arrived,\u201d he announced, placing a cup beside her. Outside, a truck was depositing a huge, bright yellow bin right in front of the shop. Liam\u2019s cheerful, pragmatic energy was a physical force, pushing back against her rising tide of doubt. \u201cRight. Drink your coffee. Then we fill that bin. The sooner we get the old junk out, the sooner we can start bringing the good stuff in.\u201d\n\nThe work was brutal and profoundly satisfying. They hauled armfuls of splintered timber and jagged pieces of old counter out to the skip bin, their movements falling into an easy rhythm. The physical exertion was a balm to Maia's anxious mind. You couldn't worry about budgets when you were trying to manoeuvre a six-foot section of rotten wood through a narrow doorway. As they worked, the village of Devonport began to wake up around them. People on their morning walks would slow as they passed, their curiosity piqued by the activity in the long-dormant shop. Most just offered a nod or a curious smile, but one elderly man with a terrier on a leash stopped, leaning on the doorframe. \u201cFinally someone\u2019s doing something with old Mrs. Gable\u2019s place,\u201d he said, his eyes twinkling. Maia froze, a piece of wood in her hands. \"I'm sorry, what did you say?\" she asked. \"Mrs. Gable,\" the man repeated. \"Agnes Gable. She and her husband ran the dairy here for forty years. Best ice creams in Auckland. She passed away, oh, must be ten years ago now. The place has never been the same since.\" He tipped his hat. \"Glad to see it getting a new lease on life.\" He ambled off, leaving Maia standing in a cloud of dust, her heart pounding. It was a coincidence. A wild, impossible coincidence. Or perhaps, it was a sign.\n\nReeling from the revelation, Maia retreated to the relative quiet of the back room to make the phone call she had been dreading. The call to the restaurant supply company. A smooth, professional voice ran her through the features of the Italian convection oven she had coveted for years, the one with the superior steam-injection system and the rock-solid temperature consistency. It was the heart of her kitchen, the one piece of equipment she refused to compromise on. \u201cSo, for the double-stack model, fully installed,\u201d the salesman concluded cheerfully, \u201cyou\u2019re looking at thirty-two thousand, five hundred dollars, plus GST.\u201d The number landed like a physical blow, knocking the air from her lungs. It was more than a third of her entire remaining capital, for one single appliance. The dream, which had felt so close, suddenly seemed to be receding at an alarming rate. All the confidence, all the joy, drained out of her, replaced by the hollow feeling of being an imposter, a little girl playing dress-up in a world of serious, expensive business she didn't understand.\n\nLiam found her a few minutes later, sitting on an overturned bucket in the kitchen-to-be, staring blankly at the wall. The skip was full, and he was covered in a thick layer of grime, but his eyes were bright with accomplishment until he saw her face. He didn\u2019t need to ask what was wrong. He simply wiped his dusty hands on his overalls and retrieved the stub of chalk from his pocket. He walked into the main room, Maia trailing silently behind him. \u201cOkay,\u201d he said, his voice quiet but firm. \u201cForget the oven for a minute. Forget the money. Show me where the counter goes. Your counter.\u201d She hesitated, then walked to a spot near the front and pointed. \u201cHere,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI want it to run along this wall, so I can see the door while I\u2019m working.\u201d Liam knelt, and with a focused intensity, drew a long, straight, white line on the dusty concrete floor, from the front of the shop almost to the back. He stood up and brushed the chalk from his hands. \u201cThere,\u201d he said, looking not at her, but at the line. \u201cThat\u2019s the start. That\u2019s the first piece of The Gable.\u201d Maia stared at the chalk line. It was just a mark on a dirty floor, but it was also a boundary, a blueprint, a declaration. It was the first new thing in the old space, a clean, straight line of hope drawn right through the heart of the chaos.The chalk line was an anchor in the swirling vortex of her anxiety. Maia ran her finger along the floor next to it, the fine white powder clinging to her skin. It was simple, straight, and real. Unlike the terrifying, abstract numbers in her notebook, this was a mark she had made on her own space, a tangible piece of the future. The salesman's voice, quoting a price that was more than her first car had cost ten times over, had almost shattered her resolve. But the chalk line held her fast. It was the first step in the recipe. Follow the steps, and something beautiful would emerge. She had always believed that. She had to believe it now.\n\nShe took a deep breath, the air thick with the ghosts of dust and decay, and closed the notebook on the page of shrinking numbers. The dream of a brand-new, top-of-the-line kitchen was just that\u2014a dream. Her reality, like it had always been, was about making do, about being resourceful, about finding value where others saw none. She pulled out her phone, sat back down on the dusty floor, and opened a new browser window. Her search terms were no longer the names of gleaming Italian brands. They were \"restaurant equipment auction,\" \"commercial kitchen liquidation,\" and \"second-hand planetary mixer Auckland.\" The results were a world away from the glossy corporate websites. The new pages were cluttered and functional, with grainy photos of dented stainless-steel tables and mixers with paint chipped from their casings. It was the unglamorous, working-class underbelly of the hospitality industry, a place of failed dreams and closing-down sales. It felt, to Maia, strangely like coming home.\n\nLiam found her an hour later, hunched over her phone, scrolling intently. The skip bin outside was now overflowing, a testament to their morning\u2019s work. He had swept the main floor, and the absence of the worst of the debris made the space feel even larger and more full of potential. He looked at the frantic scribbles she was now making in her notebook\u2014a list of websites, auction dates, and model numbers. \"Change of plan?\" he asked, already knowing the answer. \"The shiny Italian oven costs more than a small planet,\" she said without looking up. \"So, we're going treasure hunting instead.\" Liam pulled over an overturned bucket and sat beside her, peering at the screen. His eyes, accustomed to spotting a cracked engine block or a worn-out bearing from twenty paces, scanned the listings with a professional's critique. \"That mixer's got a wobble in the housing, see how it's sitting uneven? Stay away. But this one\u2026 Kenwood, 30-quart, looks like it's been through a war, but the motor on those things is indestructible. If the price is right, that's a good workhorse.\"\n\nThey fell into a new rhythm, a partnership of baker and mechanic. She knew what the equipment needed to do; he knew how to tell if it was on its last legs. They were a team, their shared history of scarcity now their greatest asset. It was during a lull in their search that Maia finally voiced the thought that had been echoing in her mind since the man with the terrier had spoken to her. \u201cLiam,\u201d she began, her voice quiet. \u201cThat old man who stopped by this morning. He said this place used to be a dairy. He said it was run by a woman named Agnes Gable.\u201d Liam stopped scrolling and looked at her, his expression unreadable. \"Gable,\" he repeated slowly. \"Like\u2026 *our* Mrs. Gable?\" Maia nodded, a lump forming in her throat. \"It has to be a coincidence, right? It's not a super uncommon name. It can't be.\" But even as she said it, a powerful, electric feeling coursed through her, the dizzying sensation of disparate parts of her life suddenly clicking into place. St. Cuthbert\u2019s, the woman who had taught her how to bake, the city that had raised her, and this dusty, forgotten shop on a quiet street by the sea\u2014they were all connected. The name she had chosen as a simple tribute was, in fact, the shop\u2019s own history, waiting to be reclaimed. It wasn\u2019t a coincidence. It was a legacy.\n\nA new listing caught her eye, interrupting her reverie. An Italian restaurant in Manukau had gone into sudden liquidation. The entire contents of the kitchen were being sold in a single, unreserved auction in two days. The list was a treasure trove: stainless steel prep benches, speed racks, a twin-deck pizza oven, and, halfway down the page, a 'Convection Oven, Commercial, European Brand, Good Working Order'. The photo was dark and blurry, taken in a hurry, but she could just make out the shape of it. It wasn't the gleaming new model from her dreams, but it was big, solid, and had the right configuration of dials. \"Liam, look,\" she said, her voice sharp with excitement. \"This is it. This could be the whole kitchen, right here.\" They spent the next hour cross-referencing the model numbers they could decipher, scrutinising the grainy photos for any signs of terminal damage. It was a gamble. Auctions were notoriously unpredictable, and buying \"as is, where is\" was a huge risk. But if the prices were right, she could potentially outfit her entire kitchen for the price of that one new oven.\n\nThe decision was made. The next day was for viewing. They would drive out to Manukau, inspect every piece of equipment on their list, and prepare for battle. The rest of the afternoon was spent on less exciting, but equally vital tasks. With Liam\u2019s help, Maia took precise measurements of the space, mapping out the floor plan in her notebook. The chalk line for the counter was joined by squares for the oven, the mixer, the fridges, and the sinks. Slowly, painstakingly, the empty shell began to resemble a kitchen on paper. As the sun began to dip low in the sky, casting long shadows across the floor, Shirley Henderson appeared in the doorway, this time carrying a plate covered in a tea towel. \u201cI saw the light on,\u201d she announced. \u201cAnd I thought you two might be flagging.\u201d She whipped off the tea towel to reveal a plate of scones. They were slightly burnt on the bottom and lopsided, but they were made with care. \"My contribution to the cause,\" she beamed. \"Now, I remember Agnes used to have her big mixer right over there,\" she said, pointing to the exact spot Maia had just marked in her notebook. \"She said she liked to be able to see the sea while she was creaming the butter and sugar. Said it made everything taste better.\" Maia smiled, a genuine, unforced smile. She wasn't just building a caf\u00e9. She was inviting a ghost home.## Chapter 8\n\nThe drive to Manukau the next day was a journey in the opposite direction, in every conceivable way. Instead of the gentle ferry ride across the harbour to the quaint, hopeful streets of Devonport, they were in Liam\u2019s rattling ute, swallowed by the relentless, southbound current of the motorway. The city\u2019s iconic skyline, Maia\u2019s fragile monument of sugar and hope, receded in the rearview mirror, replaced by a sprawling, industrial landscape of warehouses, logistics depots, and factory outlets. The air seemed to grow heavier, the light harder. Maia clutched her notebook in her lap, the pages filled with lists, measurements, and a budget that felt thinner and more fragile with every kilometre they travelled. This was not a trip to see a dream; this was a pilgrimage to the graveyard of someone else\u2019s, in the hopes of salvaging some bones for her own.\n\nThe liquidated restaurant, \u2018La Trattoria del Ponte\u2019, was located in a soulless retail park, sandwiched between a discount tyre shop and a bulk-buy plumbing supplier. The cheerful, hand-painted sign depicting a rustic Italian bridge now seemed deeply ironic, a bridge to nowhere. The windows were papered over, and a stark, fluorescent-yellow auction notice was slapped across the front door. The hopeful energy of Devonport felt a world away, replaced by the grim finality of failure. A harried-looking woman from the auction house ticked their names off a list and unlocked the door, letting them into the gloom. The air inside was cold and stagnant, carrying the faint, sad smell of stale garlic, old cooking oil, and bleach. The main dining room was a scene of suspended animation; tables were pushed into a corner, chairs stacked high, and a single, faded menu lay on the floor, its promises of \u2018Authentic Italian Cuisine\u2019 now just a sad piece of litter.\n\nThey pushed through the swinging doors into the kitchen, the true heart of the operation, now silent and cold. Under the harsh buzz of the fluorescent lights, the stainless steel gleamed dully. This was no showroom. This was a workspace that had seen thousands of hours of frantic, sweaty, passionate labour. Liam, in his element, was transformed. He was no longer just Maia\u2019s supportive friend; he was a forensic engineer. He ran his hand under the lip of a prep table, checking for rust. He kicked the leg of a speed rack, testing the welds. He methodically opened and closed the doors of a low refrigeration unit, listening to the hum of the compressor and pressing his fingers to the seal, testing for leaks. Maia followed him with her notebook, a silent apprentice, as he gave his terse verdicts. \u201cTable\u2019s solid. Racks are good. Fridge motor\u2019s working overtime, seal\u2019s shot. Stay away from that one.\u201d\n\nIn the far corner, pushed up against a tiled wall stained with the ghosts of tomato sauce, was the main prize. The oven. It was a hulking, twin-deck, stainless-steel beast, an Italian brand she recognised but not the top-tier model she\u2019d dreamed of. It was a workhorse, not a show pony, bearing the dents and scorch marks of a long and difficult life in a busy kitchen. Her heart sank a little. It was so\u2026 industrial. So unlovely. But as Liam got to work, her aesthetic disappointment gave way to a grudging respect. He moved around it with the focused intensity of a bomb disposal expert, checking every dial, every hinge, every wire he could see. He pulled a crisp ten-dollar note from his wallet and closed it in the top oven door, then tried to pull it out. It slid free with almost no resistance. He grunted. \u201cGasket\u2019s completely worn. It\u2019s losing heat. Most people will see that and assume the door is warped. They\u2019ll walk away.\u201d He opened the door again and pointed to the black rubber seal lining the frame. \u201cBut see this? It\u2019s a standard size. We can get a new one for fifty bucks and install it ourselves in ten minutes.\u201d He gave the side of the machine a resounding, affectionate thump. \u201cThis old girl is solid as a rock. This is our advantage.\u201d\n\nWhile Liam was murmuring to the oven\u2019s electrical panel, Maia\u2019s eyes scanned the rest of the kitchen. Her gaze fell on a small, cluttered shelf above a prep station. Tucked behind a row of spice jars filled with faded, clumpy herbs was a small, worn photograph held to the wall with a piece of yellowing tape. It showed a beaming, round-faced man with a magnificent moustache, his arm around a laughing woman, both of them in chef\u2019s whites. In front of them was a towering, elaborate wedding cake. She felt a powerful jolt of kinship. This man, this woman\u2014they were like her. They had built this kitchen, invested their hopes and savings into these very machines. And for some reason, it had all fallen apart. The risk she was taking suddenly became terrifyingly real. She wasn't just buying equipment; she was stepping into a space haunted by a dream that had died. For a moment, she felt like a vulture, picking over the remains. Then a different feeling replaced it: a sense of duty. She would take these tools, this ghost of a kitchen, and she would make them work again. She would honour the dream that had failed by building one that would succeed.\n\nThey left the silent restaurant and returned to the ute, the bright sunlight making them blink. They sat for a long time on the open tailgate, the sounds of the industrial park a dull hum around them. Liam had his notebook out now, and they began to formulate their battle plan. They went through Maia\u2019s list item by item, assigning a maximum bid to each one, a cold, hard number that represented the absolute limit she was willing to pay. For the convection oven, they agreed on a bold but not reckless figure, banking on Liam\u2019s discovery of the faulty gasket to keep the competition low. For the indestructible Kenwood mixer, they set a firm price. The prep tables, the racks, the sinks\u2014every item was given a value. \u201cThe pizza oven,\u201d Liam said, pointing to it on the list. \u201cThat\u2019s your wildcard. If we get the main stuff cheap, we go for it. If not, we let it go. Stick to the plan, Hart. No emotion. It\u2019s just numbers.\u201d\n\nDriving back across the city as the afternoon bled into evening, Maia felt a profound shift within herself. The fear and anxiety had not vanished, but they had been compressed, forged by the day\u2019s realities into a new, harder substance: resolve. She was no longer just the baker, the artist who could coax beauty from flour and sugar. She was the businesswoman with a budget, the strategist with a plan, the treasure hunter about to walk into a battle of nerves and numbers. She looked at her notebook, at the neat columns of items and prices. It was her armour. Tomorrow, she would walk into that auction not as an orphan from nowhere hoping for a lucky break, but as the proprietor of The Gable, ready to claim the heart of her kitchen.The auction was held in a cavernous, cold warehouse that smelled of dust, stale coffee, and collective anxiety. It was a purgatory for failed businesses, where the tools of forgotten dreams were laid out under harsh fluorescent lights, tagged and numbered for dissection. The crowd was a cross-section of the city\u2019s ambition and desperation: sharp-suited men from restaurant groups looking for bargains, weary-looking couples with hopeful eyes and thin wallets, and gruff, predatory dealers who circled the lots like sharks, their catalogues filled with cynical calculations. Maia clutched her notebook to her chest, the pages of handwritten notes feeling like a fragile shield against the brutal reality of the room. Liam stood beside her, a solid, calming presence. He was in his element, his gaze sweeping the crowd, categorising them as easily as he would diagnose a faulty engine. \u201cSee the guy in the blue shirt?\u201d he murmured, his voice low. \u201cHe\u2019s a dealer. He\u2019ll bid on everything to drive the price up. Ignore him. The couple near the back, they\u2019re like you. All heart, small budget. They\u2019re not your competition. It\u2019s the quiet ones you have to watch.\u201d\n\nThe auctioneer, a man with a rapid-fire patter and tired eyes, launched into the smaller lots. The pace was bewildering, a blur of numbers and nods. Following their plan, they let the cutlery and crockery go, ignoring the small temptations. Then came the stainless-steel prep tables. Liam gave a subtle nod. Maia raised her paddle, her heart hammering. She won the first two for a price well under their maximum. A small, thrilling victory. Next were the speed racks. They got three for a steal, the dealer in the blue shirt having dismissed them as low-value. With each successful bid, a clerk would appear at her side with an invoice, and the number at the top of her budget page would shrink. The initial thrill of winning was tempered by the cold, hard reality of the cost, a constant, sobering subtraction from her future.\n\nThen came Lot 47: the thirty-quart Kenwood mixer. It stood on a pallet, its white enamel paint chipped and scarred, a veteran of a thousand battles with dough and batter. \u201cA true workhorse, this one,\u201d the auctioneer announced, giving it a paternal pat. The bidding started immediately and was brisk. The couple from the back put in a hopeful early bid before being quickly priced out. Then the man in the crisp shirt, one of the quiet ones Liam had pointed out, entered the fray. He bid with an air of bored entitlement, as if the mixer were already his. The price climbed steadily, approaching the hard limit Maia and Liam had set. Her hand, holding the paddle, began to feel heavy. This was a key piece. But Liam had been adamant: *No emotion. It\u2019s just numbers.* The price hit their maximum. The man in the crisp shirt raised it by another fifty dollars. Liam gave a subtle, almost imperceptible shake of his head. It was over. But then the man smirked, a quick, arrogant little smile, and something stubborn and defiant flared in Maia\u2019s chest. She lifted her paddle, her eyes locked on the auctioneer. \u201cAnd twenty-five,\u201d she called out, her voice clear. The bid was small, a signal not of wealth, but of sheer refusal to be dismissed. The man\u2019s smirk faltered. He looked at her, then at the beaten-up mixer, and with a disdainful shrug, he turned away. The hammer fell. The mixer was hers, for twenty-five dollars over budget. Liam let out a long, slow breath beside her. \u201cYou got lucky,\u201d he muttered. \u201cDon\u2019t do that again.\u201d\n\nThey let the faulty refrigeration unit go, watching with quiet satisfaction as another bidder, a man who hadn\u2019t done his homework, overpaid for it. The small act of discipline settled Maia\u2019s nerves after her impulsive bid for the mixer. She had proven to herself she could stick to the plan, mostly. The room began to thin out as the lower-value items were cleared. The air grew heavier with anticipation. The main events were coming. Maia\u2019s palms were slick with sweat. Her notebook felt flimsy now, the numbers on the page a poor defence against the brutal, fast-paced arithmetic of the room.\n\n\u201cAnd now, ladies and gentlemen, Lot 72,\u201d the auctioneer boomed, gesturing to the hulking metal beast in the centre of the room. \u201cThe twin-deck convection oven. Italian-made, in, shall we say, a well-used condition. We\u2019ll start the bidding at one thousand dollars.\u201d A thousand dollars. It was a laughably low starting point. A few lazy bids from the dealers took it to three thousand. Maia and Liam exchanged a look. They waited, their stillness a stark contrast to the nervous energy rippling through the room. The bidding stalled at four thousand. Most of the room, just as Liam predicted, saw a worn-out machine with a dodgy door, an expensive problem waiting to happen. The auctioneer began his final call. \u201cFour thousand dollars, a bargain for a piece like this. Any advance?\u201d Liam gave the nod. Maia lifted her paddle. \u201cFive thousand,\u201d she said, her voice steady. The auctioneer\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cFive thousand I have! A new bidder! Do I hear six?\u201d Silence. The dealers shook their heads. The man in the crisp shirt was gone. The hammer was raised. \u201cGoing once\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cSeven thousand!\u201d The voice was sharp and clear, cutting through the silence from the back of the warehouse. Maia\u2019s head whipped around. A woman in an expensive-looking trench coat, who hadn't bid on a single item all day, had her paddle raised. Her eyes were fixed on the oven with an unblinking, professional intensity. She knew exactly what she was looking at. The game had changed. The few remaining serious bidders, sensing a fight, re-entered the fray. The price jumped, leaving Maia\u2019s steal of a price in the dust. Seven, eight, nine thousand. It flew past the midway point of Maia\u2019s budget for it. The dealers dropped out, shaking their heads. It was now a two-horse race: Maia Hart, the hopeful baker, versus the cool, calculating woman in the trench coat.\n\nThe price hit their absolute, hard-as-rock maximum limit. The woman in the coat had the bid. \u201cThis is it,\u201d Liam murmured, his voice tight with tension. \u201cThis is where we walk. We can find another one.\u201d But Maia couldn\u2019t look away from the oven. She saw it not as it was, dented and grimy in this cold warehouse, but as it would be, the warm, beating heart of her own kitchen, light spilling from its windows, the smell of baking bread filling the air of The Gable. She thought of the chalk line on her floor. She thought of Mrs Gable, and the photo of the happy, failed restaurateurs. She couldn\u2019t lose it. Not now. Breaking every rule she had set for herself, ignoring Liam's rigid discipline and the frantic screaming of her own budget, she lifted her paddle high. \u201cAnd five hundred,\u201d she called out, her voice ringing with a desperate finality. It wasn\u2019t a bid; it was a declaration of war. It was almost all the capital she had left for equipment. It was everything.\n\nA profound silence fell over the warehouse. Every eye was on the woman in the coat. She held Maia\u2019s gaze for a long, charged moment, her expression a mixture of irritation and grudging respect. A silent calculation flickered in her eyes. Then, with a curt, almost imperceptible shake of her head, she lowered her paddle. The auctioneer, sensing the climax, let the moment hang in the air. \u201cGoing once,\u201d he called, his voice resonating in the stillness. \u201cGoing twice\u2026\u201d The hammer came down with a thunderous crack that made Maia flinch. \u201cSOLD! For twenty-two thousand, five hundred dollars, to the lady with the notebook!\u201d A wave of dizziness washed over Maia, and she sagged back in her plastic chair, her knuckles white where she gripped her notes. Liam grabbed her arm, his grip grounding her. \u201cYou are completely and utterly insane, Hart,\u201d he whispered, but his voice was thick with a mixture of terror and absolute awe. A clerk handed her the final invoice, and she stared at the number, feeling sick. It was a figure of terrifying, beautiful victory. The heart of her kitchen had been won.## Chapter 9\n\nThe aftermath of the hammer blow was a silent, personal explosion. The world of the auction house rushed on around Maia\u2014the auctioneer was already introducing the next lot, the remaining bidders had shifted their attention\u2014but she was frozen, suspended in the echo of her own reckless bid. The flimsy carbon-copy invoice in her hand felt heavier than the glass trophy. The number written on it wasn't a prize; it was a debt, a promise, a terrifying leap of faith she had taken without a safety net. She felt Liam\u2019s hand on her back, a steadying pressure. He leaned in, his voice a low rumble in her ear. \u201cBreathe, Hart. You own an oven. Now we have to figure out how to get the damn thing home.\u201d His words, blunt and practical, were the pin that popped the bubble of her paralysis. The elation and terror receded, replaced by the crushing, immediate weight of logistics.\n\nThey remained for the rest of the auction, a self-imposed penance. Maia watched, her stomach churning, as other people\u2019s dreams and necessities were bought and sold. Then came Lot 94: the twin-deck pizza oven. It was a handsome piece of equipment, not as essential as her convection oven, but it had sparked a secondary dream of Friday nights at The Gable, of sourdough bases and bubbling mozzarella. It was the wildcard, the \u2018nice-to-have\u2019 that was now an impossibility. She watched as a young couple, the ones Liam had pointed out earlier, entered the bidding with a desperate, hopeful energy. They fought for it, their bids small but determined, and finally won it for a price that felt both fair and, to Maia, deeply painful. It was the first, tangible sacrifice she had to make, the first dream she had to let go of to protect the larger one. She watched them sign their own invoice, their faces alight with a joy she had felt only an hour ago, and a sharp, unexpected grief lanced through her.\n\nThe drive back to the city was heavy with a silence that was different from the comfortable quiet they usually shared. The ute felt cavernous without the weight of their hopes for the auction filling it. Liam drove with a grim focus, his knuckles white on the steering wheel. Finally, as they merged onto the Harbour Bridge, with the familiar, glittering skyline spread out before them, he spoke. \u201cYou could have lost everything today, Maia,\u201d he said, his voice low and devoid of anger, which was somehow worse. It was filled with a deep, aching fear for her. \u201cYou had a plan, a budget. You threw it all away on a feeling.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt wasn't a feeling,\u201d she replied, her voice barely a whisper. She looked at her reflection in the passenger window, a pale ghost against the backdrop of the city lights. \u201cIt was a choice. All my life, I\u2019ve taken the leftovers. The last foster home, the hand-me-down clothes, the dented cans at the supermarket. I\u2019ve been resourceful because I\u2019ve had to be. But in that room, when that woman in the coat tried to take it, I realised I was tired of settling. I didn\u2019t want the sensible, second-best option. I wanted the heart of my kitchen. I was willing to fight for it.\u201d She turned to look at him, her eyes pleading for him to understand. \u201cI know it was reckless. I know I\u2019ve made everything ten times harder. But for the first time in my life, Liam, I didn\u2019t back down. I chose.\u201d He didn\u2019t reply, but the tension in his shoulders eased almost imperceptibly, his grip on the steering wheel softening.\n\nThe next day was dubbed \u2018Operation Extraction\u2019. Liam, true to his word, had called in his favours. Two of his friends, a bear of a man named Samo and a wiry, tattooed panel-beater named Gaz, arrived at the shuttered restaurant just after the truck Liam had rented for the day. The task of moving the kitchen was a brutal symphony of grunts, curses, and screeching metal. The convection oven was a monster, a half-tonne monument to Maia\u2019s recklessness. It took all four of them, a heavy-duty dolly, and a terrifyingly steep loading ramp to manoeuvre it onto the truck, its immense weight making the vehicle groan in protest. They loaded the mixer, the tables, the racks, and the sinks, each piece a hard-won trophy from the previous day\u2019s battle. By the time they were finished, they were all drenched in sweat, covered in grime, and united in a weary camaraderie.\n\nArriving in Devonport was like bringing a circus to a slumbering village. The huge rental truck looked absurdly out of place on the quiet street. They reversed it up to the door of The Gable with inches to spare, drawing a small crowd of curious onlookers, including Shirley Henderson, who watched with a mixture of delight and horror from a safe distance. The process of getting the equipment into the shop was even more difficult than getting it out of the restaurant. The doorway was narrow, the floor uneven. The oven, their primary antagonist, became wedged at a cruel angle, refusing to budge. For twenty minutes, it seemed like an impossible problem, the final, humiliating obstacle. But Liam, with a mechanic\u2019s ingenuity, used a car jack and a series of wooden blocks to lift and pivot the beast, and with a final, collective shove, it scraped through the doorway and into the main room.\n\nOne by one, they wheeled the pieces of her kitchen into place. It was no longer a floor plan in a notebook; it was a reality of steel and enamel. The hulking oven was wrestled into the back room, settling into its designated spot against the wall with a decisive thud. The battered Kenwood mixer, her small, emotional victory, was placed on the floor where Shirley had said the old one used to be, in sight of the sea. The prep tables were lined up against the wall, their dented surfaces gleaming under the bare bulb. It wasn't a shiny, new kitchen from a catalogue. It was a collection of scarred, second-hand soldiers, each with its own history of battles fought in other kitchens. They were hers. Every dent, every scratch, every scorch mark was a testament to the fact that she had fought for them.\n\nLiam and his friends finally left as dusk settled, leaving Maia alone in the transformed space. The air was no longer empty; it was filled with the silent, metallic presence of her new kitchen. She walked to the oven and placed her palm flat against the cold steel of its door. She could still see the ghost of the worn gasket, the flaw that had given her an advantage. She thought of the invoice, the terrifying number that now represented the bulk of her life savings. But standing there, surrounded by her hard-won, second-hand army, the fear was different. It was no longer the free-floating anxiety of an uncertain future. It was the focused, productive fear of a person with a mountain of work to do and the tools to do it. She ran a hand over the chipped paint of her mixer, then across the scarred surface of a prep table. This was real. She wasn't a little girl playing shop. She was a builder standing on her own foundation, ready to get to work.The days that followed blurred into a gruelling marathon of manual labour. The romance of building her dream was quickly replaced by the gritty, unglamorous reality of dust, sweat, and aching muscles. Mornings began before dawn, with Maia and Liam meeting at the shop, armed with coffee and a shared, grim determination. The first task was the floor. They rented a monstrous industrial grinder and, wearing masks and goggles that made them look like post-apocalyptic scavengers, began the painstaking process of stripping away decades of old adhesive and grime from the concrete. The noise was deafening, a high-pitched scream that vibrated through the soles of their feet, and the dust was a constant, choking presence. It was miserable, soul-destroying work. As Maia guided the heavy machine across the floor, her arms trembling with the effort, she found herself wondering if she had made a terrible mistake, trading the elegant science of patisserie for the brute force of construction.\n\nLiam, however, thrived in the chaos. He attacked the work with a relentless energy, seeing not a mess, but a series of problems to be solved. While Maia wrestled with the grinder, he was on his knees, crowbar in hand, ripping up the rotten skirting boards. He found the source of the water damage they had spotted on day one\u2014a leaky downpipe outside\u2014and patched it with a combination of sealant and sheer stubbornness. He became her project manager, her foreman, and her entire construction crew rolled into one. He taught her how to mix plaster, how to find studs in the walls, how to use a power drill without stripping the screws. Her hands, once soft and dusted with flour, became calloused and flecked with paint. She learned a new vocabulary, a language of spackle, grout, and load-bearing walls. In the evenings, she would collapse onto her sofa, too tired even to cook, her body aching in places she didn't know could ache, and fall asleep dreaming of wiring diagrams and plumbing schematics.\n\nThe budget, or what was left of it, was a constant, terrifying spectre. The professional jobs\u2014the electrical and plumbing\u2014could not be avoided. Maia spent hours on the phone, getting quotes, her heart sinking with each conversation. The electricians laid out the cost of running commercial-grade wiring, installing a new breaker box, and fitting the dozens of outlets she would need. The plumbers quoted a figure for running new water lines and a waste pipe that made her feel physically ill. To save money, Maia and Liam became their unpaid apprentices. They spent a whole weekend crawling under the floorboards in the cramped, spider-filled space, pulling new electrical cables through the joists under the electrician's sharp-eyed supervision. Liam, with his mechanic's understanding of systems, took to it quickly, but for Maia, it was a claustrophobic nightmare. She emerged at the end of the day, covered in cobwebs and dirt, with a new and profound respect for tradespeople and a deeper understanding of just how much her recklessness at the auction had cost her.\n\nJust when she felt she was at her breaking point, the community would offer a small, unexpected kindness that felt like a lifeline. Shirley Henderson became a daily visitor, arriving at precisely 4 PM with her tartan flask of tea and a plate of her lopsided but delicious scones. She would survey their progress with a critical eye, offering unsolicited advice and stories about how Agnes Gable used to arrange her shelves. The man with the terrier, whose name they learned was Arthur, stopped by with a shoebox full of old, sepia-toned photographs of the shop in its heyday as a bustling dairy, the street full of vintage cars. Seeing the black-and-white images of Agnes Gable, a formidable-looking woman with kind eyes, standing proudly behind a counter laden with sweets, solidified Maia's sense of purpose. She wasn't just renovating a shop; she was restoring a piece of the village's heart. Another time, the owner of the neighbouring bookshop brought them a box of sandwiches, saying simply, \"You can't build an empire on an empty stomach.\" Each gesture was a small deposit into her depleted reserves of hope.\n\nThe first real setback came, as they always do, from an unexpected quarter. The new gasket for the oven door, the \"fifty-buck, ten-minute fix\" that had been Liam's ace in the hole, proved to be an elusive prize. The brand was obscure, the model discontinued. Liam spent hours on the phone with suppliers in Australia and Europe, only to be met with dead ends. The fifty-dollar fix was turning into a cross-continental search for a unicorn. Without a perfect seal, the oven would be hopelessly inefficient, bleeding heat and money, making a mockery of her precise baking times. The beautiful, hard-won heart of her kitchen was flawed, and the simple solution had evaporated. The weight of her gamble at the auction came crashing back down on her. She had bankrupted her future for a broken machine. That evening, she sat alone on the dusty floor, staring at the useless oven, and for the first time since this whole insane journey began, she cried not from joy or relief, but from the cold, hard certainty that she was going to fail.\n\nLiam found her there, a small, desolate figure in the half-finished shop, lit only by the cold glow of a single work light. He didn\u2019t say \"I told you so.\" He didn't offer platitudes. He just sat on the floor beside her and handed her a greasy rag to wipe her eyes. They sat in silence for a long time, the shadow of the useless oven looming over them. \"It's not just the gasket, is it?\" he said finally, his voice rough. She shook her head, unable to speak. \"It's the money,\" she whispered, the words catching in her throat. \"It's all the money. There's nothing left. If I can't fix this oven, I have nothing. I'll have a lease, a pile of debt, and a room full of junk.\" The full scope of her failure was laid bare in the stark, empty room. The dream of The Gable, with its sea-green door and the smell of cardamom buns, dissolved into the pathetic reality of a girl who had reached too far and fallen too hard. Liam listened, letting her pour out all the fear and doubt she had been holding back. When she was finished, her voice a raw whisper, he stood up and walked to the oven. He ran his hand over the door, his mechanic's mind clicking and whirring. \"Okay,\" he said, turning back to her. \"So, the part doesn't exist. That's a problem. But it's not the end of the world.\" He paused, a new idea beginning to form in his eyes. \"The problem isn't the oven. The problem is the seal. It's just a specific shape of heat-resistant rubber. We can't buy it. So\u2026 we'll make it.\"## Chapter 10\n\n\u201cMake it?\u201d The words were absurd, a nonsensical string of syllables in the face of her overwhelming despair. \u201cMake what, Liam? A miracle?\u201d She gestured helplessly at the oven, a monument to her failure. \u201cThat\u2019s a precision-engineered part from a factory in Italy, not something you can whip up with a spanner and some duct tape.\u201d Her voice was sharp with the brittle edge of hopelessness, the last defence of someone who had given up. She expected him to falter, to finally admit defeat. But Liam was unfazed. He was already looking at the oven door not as a problem, but as a puzzle, his mechanic\u2019s mind dismantling it into its constituent parts.\n\n\u201cNot duct tape,\u201d he said, his voice calm and maddeningly reasonable. \u201cSilicone. High-temperature, food-grade liquid silicone. People use it to make custom baking moulds all the time, right? A gasket is just a mould in reverse. We take a perfect impression of the channel in the oven frame, build a housing for it, pour the liquid silicone, and let it cure.\u201d He looked at her, a spark of excitement in his eyes, the thrill of the challenge overriding the gloom. \u201cIt\u2019s just a recipe, Hart. A different kind of recipe. And you\u2019re the best there is at following a recipe.\u201d\n\nHis logic was so simple, so audacious, that it bypassed her despair and landed somewhere in the region of grudging admiration. He was right. It was just a series of steps. Measure, mix, mould, wait. It was an alchemy she understood. The idea was a tiny, flickering flame in the vast darkness of her fear, but it was enough. For the first time in hours, she stood up, brushing the dust from her jeans. The search for a non-existent part was over. The quest to create an impossible one had just begun. Their new partnership, the baker and the mechanic, found its new purpose. Maia, with her steady hands and her intuitive understanding of delicate processes, would be in charge of the mould. Liam, with his knowledge of materials and his fearless approach to fabrication, would handle the chemistry.\n\nThe first step was taking the impression. After an hour of frantic online research, they settled on a fine-grain modeling clay, the kind used by sculptors for detailed work. Kneading the clay in her hands, Maia felt a flicker of a familiar sensation. It was like working a stiff dough, bringing it to the right temperature and consistency. With painstaking precision, she began pressing the soft, yielding clay into the deep, narrow channel that ran around the oven\u2019s frame. It was a slow, meditative process. She worked in small sections, ensuring every millimetre of the groove was perfectly captured, her baker\u2019s focus narrowed down to this single, crucial task. Liam watched in silence, trusting her instincts, his usual boisterous energy subdued into a quiet, respectful observance of her craft. When she finally peeled the last section of clay away, they were left with a long, perfect negative impression of the channel, a fragile map of their solution.\n\nThe next stage belonged to Liam. He constructed a shallow, coffin-like box from scraps of melamine, building a precise housing around the delicate clay impression. This would be their mould. While he worked, Maia was on the phone, tracking down a supplier for the silicone. She found a specialty chemical company in East Tamaki that sold two-part, platinum-cure silicone, certified as food-safe up to 250 degrees Celsius. It was expensive, another painful bite out of her dwindling funds, but it was their only shot. As Liam drove out to pick it up, Maia sat alone in the shop, guarding the fragile clay mould as if it were the most precious thing in the world. In that moment, it was.\n\nWhen Liam returned with two unlabelled plastic tubs, the atmosphere in the shop shifted again, becoming as tense and focused as the final moments of a Showstopper bake. This was the point of no return. They had one shot; the silicone was too expensive to afford a mistake. Following the technical data sheet with religious precision, they measured the two liquids, the viscous base and the thinner catalyst, into a clean bucket. Maia did the pouring, her movements slow and steady, her baker\u2019s eye judging the volume. Then, with a clean paddle, Liam began to stir, his movements smooth and consistent to avoid introducing air bubbles that could create weak spots in the final gasket. The mixture turned a milky, translucent white. They had a working time of thirty minutes before it would begin to set. There was no time to waste.\n\nWith a shared, silent nod, they tipped the bucket. The liquid silicone flowed into the mould with a thick, satisfying slowness, filling the negative space of the clay impression, covering the intricate details she had so carefully captured. It crept into every corner of the melamine box, a pristine white flood that promised either salvation or financial ruin. Once it was poured, there was nothing more to do. The chemical reaction had begun, and the outcome was now out of their hands. The data sheet recommended a twenty-four-hour cure time. A full day of waiting. A full day of not knowing. The silence in the shop was heavy with the weight of their gamble. As if on cue, the door creaked open and Shirley Henderson bustled in, her tartan flask in hand. \u201cGoodness me, you two look like you\u2019ve just seen a ghost!\u201d she declared cheerfully, utterly oblivious to the high-stakes chemistry experiment curing on the workbench. \u201cNothing a good cup of tea won\u2019t fix.\u201d Her mundane, comforting presence was so jarringly normal that Maia let out a laugh that was dangerously close to a sob.The tea was sweet, milky, and absurdly normal. Shirley chattered on about the upcoming village f\u00eate and the deplorable state of the petunias in the public planters, her cheerful monologue a protective bubble around Maia and Liam\u2019s silent, screaming tension. They sipped their tea, nodding in the right places, their eyes repeatedly flicking to the workbench where the white liquid sat, placid and inscrutable. It was a surreal pantomime of civility. At one point, Shirley gestured towards the wall with her cup. \u201cAgnes always said the secret to a good business was good bones. She meant the shop, of course, but I think she meant people, too. Sturdy stock, she\u2019d say.\u201d The innocent remark landed with the weight of prophecy. Maia looked at Liam, his face grimy but his posture solid and unwavering, and felt a surge of something stronger than hope: gratitude. She wasn't facing this alone. When Shirley finally bustled out, leaving them with two empty cups and a plate of scone crumbs, the silence that descended was no longer one of despair. It was the quiet of a team before a big game, focused and ready.\n\nLiam broke it first, his voice low and practical. \u201cOkay. We have twenty-four hours to kill. We can\u2019t watch it cure. That\u2019s like watching a pot to make it boil. We need to work.\u201d He walked to the corner where they had stacked cans of paint and rollers. \u201cThe electrician is coming in two days to start the rough-in. He needs clean walls. So today, we paint.\u201d The task was brilliantly chosen. It was large, physical, and transformative. It was something they could control. They pryed open the large tins of white paint, the clean, chemical smell cutting through the dust. They poured the thick, creamy liquid into trays and began to roll it onto the dirty, patched-up walls. The first stroke of white against the grimy cream was a revelation. It was a fresh start, a blank page. The simple, repetitive motion of rolling the paint up and down the walls became a form of meditation. It was mindless, rhythmic work that occupied their bodies and freed their minds from the frantic what-ifs. They worked in a comfortable, practiced silence, the only sounds the soft whir of the rollers and the occasional clatter of a paint tray. With every section of wall they covered, the space brightened, the years of neglect and grime disappearing under a clean, optimistic coat of white. They were literally building her blank canvas.\n\nThe long day bled into a long, sleepless night for Maia. She went back to her tiny flat, but the silence there was different from the productive quiet of the shop. It was empty and loud with her own anxieties. She lay awake, picturing the silicone mixture at a molecular level, imagining bubbles forming, weak spots appearing, the chemical reaction failing. She imagined peeling it away to find a sticky, useless mess. By dawn, she had convinced herself of their failure. She arrived back at the shop haggard and hollow-eyed, expecting to find Liam equally on edge. Instead, she found him already there, calmly sanding a piece of timber he had salvaged from the demolition pile, planning to repurpose it as a shelf. He took one look at her face, handed her a coffee, and simply said, \u201cAlmost time.\u201d His steadiness was an anchor. The shop, now gleaming with its first coat of pristine white paint, felt different. It was brighter, cleaner, and full of a quiet, waiting potential. It looked like a place where good things could happen. The twenty-four hours were up.\n\nThey approached the workbench with the reverence of priests approaching an altar. The silicone in the melamine box was no longer liquid. It was a solid, opaque block of milky white, smooth and firm to the touch. It had set. That was the first hurdle cleared. The next was demoulding it without tearing it. Liam worked with the painstaking care of a surgeon, using a screwdriver to gently pry the sides of the melamine box away. The wood splintered and cracked, but the silicone inside remained pristine. With the sides removed, all that was left was to peel the original clay impression from the newly formed gasket. This was Maia\u2019s job. Her fingers, trembling slightly, found an edge. Holding her breath, she began to lift. The clay, now dry and brittle, came away cleanly, revealing the intricate, perfect negative of the shape beneath. The newly created gasket lay on the bench, a long, flexible, impossibly perfect replica of the channel it was designed to fill. It was smooth, flawless, and free of a single air bubble. It was beautiful.\n\nNow for the final, terrifying test. Maia lifted the gasket. It felt supple and strong in her hands, a bizarre and wonderful creation born of their shared desperation. She carried it to the oven, her heart pounding a frantic rhythm against her ribs. She lined it up with the empty channel in the oven door frame. With gentle pressure from her fingertips, she began to press it into place. It slid into the groove as if it were made for it, a perfect, snug fit. It was a moment of pure, unadulterated magic. She ran her finger along its length, the smooth, resilient rubber a testament to their insane gamble. She stepped back. Liam reached out and slowly, deliberately, closed the heavy oven door. Instead of the loose, metallic rattle it had made before, it closed with a soft, solid, deeply satisfying *thump*. There was no give, no wobble. It was sealed. But they needed to be sure. Liam pulled the same crisp ten-dollar note from his wallet, the one that had started this whole ordeal. He slid it halfway into the doorframe and closed the door on it. He tugged gently. The note held fast. He tugged harder. It wouldn't budge. He looked at Maia, his face, for once, utterly devoid of its usual cynical humour, and broke into a grin so wide it seemed to light up the entire room.\n\nA choked, hysterical laugh bubbled up out of Maia\u2019s chest, a sound of pure, unadulterated relief that echoed in the newly painted space. She threw her arms around Liam\u2019s neck, burying her face in his dusty, paint-splattered shoulder as he hugged her back, lifting her off the ground in a triumphant, spinning circle. They had done it. They had faced an impossible, budget-destroying problem and had solved it not with money, but with ingenuity, desperation, and a trust in each other\u2019s skills. The oven, which had been a symbol of her recklessness and looming failure, was now a monument to her resilience. Standing in the bright, white room, surrounded by the tools she had fought for, with the heart of her kitchen now beating strong and true, she knew with a certainty that reached down to her bones that she would not fail. The Gable was going to be real.",

                                        "text": "The letter, when it arrived, didn't feel real. It was just a slip of thick, cream-coloured cardstock, nestled between a power bill and a flyer for a pizza place that promised two for the price of one. For a full minute, Maia Hart just stared at the crisp, embossed logo at the top: a stylised whisk and rolling pin encircled by a wreath of silver fern. The Great Kiwi Bake Off. Finalist. The words seemed to shimmer, refusing to be absorbed by her brain. She read them once, then twice. She traced the letters with a flour-dusted finger.\n\nHer flat, a tiny one-bedroom shoebox above a laundromat in Kingsland, was suddenly too small to contain the frantic energy that erupted inside her chest. It was a feeling like proving dough, a warmth that expanded until it pressed against her ribs, threatening to burst. She let out a laugh that was more of a gasp, a sound that felt foreign in the quiet of her usually solitary mornings. She was in. The final. After weeks of televised, sugar-fuelled anxiety, of piping bags splitting at the worst possible moment and jellies that refused to set under the hot studio lights, she had actually made it.\n\nAuckland stretched out beyond her window, a familiar panorama of grey slate roofs, lush green volcanic cones, and the distant, needle-like point of the Sky Tower. It was a city she knew in her bones, a city that had raised her in a patchwork of foster homes and, finally, the St. Cuthbert\u2019s Group Home for Girls. It had never quite felt like hers, more like a place she was just passing through. She was a ghost in its bustling laneways, a silent observer on its crowded buses. But now, holding this letter, she felt a flicker of belonging. Maia Hart, the orphan from nowhere, was a finalist. People knew her name. They\u2019d cheered for her rose and pistachio Battenberg, wept with her when she\u2019d dedicated her Signature Bake to Mrs Gable, the care home volunteer who had first put a wooden spoon in her hand.\n\nBaking was the one constant, the one controllable science in a life defined by chaos. You measured the flour, you creamed the butter and sugar until it was pale and fluffy, you trusted the heat of the oven. Follow the steps, and something beautiful, something whole, would emerge. It was an alchemy she\u2019d clung to, a way to create warmth where there was none, to build a home one gingerbread brick at a time. The grand prize, a hundred thousand dollars and a magazine spread, wasn't just money. It was a down payment on a dream. A little caf\u00e9, maybe in Devonport, with a sea-green door and the smell of coffee and cardamom buns spilling onto the pavement. A place that was hers. A foundation.\n\nHer phone buzzed on the counter, rattling against a stray crumb of yesterday's sourdough experiment. The screen lit up with a picture of a grinning idiot covered in grease. Liam.\n\n\"You'd better not be calling to tell me you've glued your hand to a carburettor again,\" she answered, the smile evident in her voice.\n\n\"Very funny, Hart,\" his voice crackled back, warm and familiar as her oldest cardigan. \"Just calling for the pre-game pep talk. Are we in a state of mortal terror, or have we ascended to a zen-like plane of buttercream acceptance?\"\n\nMaia clutched the letter to her chest. \"I'm holding the official letter, Liam. It's on fancy paper and everything. It feels\u2026 heavy.\"\n\n\"That's because it's heavy with the weight of your impending victory. And probably the cost of the fancy paper. So, what\u2019s the plan? You packed? The Biscuit ready to roll? I told you I could come get you, you know. My ute might smell of oil rags and desperation, but she runs.\"\n\n\"The Biscuit is fine,\" she said, a little too defensively. The Biscuit was her 1998 Toyota Corolla, a dented, sea-mist green vessel of questionable reliability. It was the first thing she'd ever bought for herself, saved up from two years of waitressing. It was freedom, even if that freedom sometimes stalled at traffic lights. \"She's all packed up. Coolers in the back for the pre-made elements, my lucky apron on the passenger seat. Everything is under control.\"\n\n\"\u2018Everything is under control\u2019,\" Liam mimicked, his tone laced with fond amusement. \"Famous last words of every baker before the showstopper melts. Just\u2026 be careful on the motorway, okay? Call me when you get to the studio. And Maia?\"\n\n\"Yeah?\"\n\n\"You've already won, you know. Just by being you.\"\n\nThe sincerity in his voice made her throat tighten. Liam was the closest thing to family she had. They\u2019d met at St. Cuthbert\u2019s, two scrawny kids clinging to the edges of a world that didn't seem to want them. He was the one who\u2019d held her hand at Mrs Gable\u2019s funeral, the one who\u2019d taught her how to change a tyre, the one who\u2019d tasted every single one of her practice bakes, from the disastrous first attempt at a pavlova (more of a meringue puddle) to the triumphant twelve-layer opera cake that had got her through the semi-final. He saw her, not as the orphan or the charity case, but as Maia.\n\n\"Don't get sappy on me now, McCarthy,\" she mumbled, blinking back a sudden prickle of tears. \"You'll ruin my eyeliner before I've even left the house.\"\n\n\"Right. Tough girl. Go get 'em, Hart. I'll be watching. Shouting at the telly like a proper nutter.\"\n\nAfter they hung up, she took a deep breath. He was right. Zen-like plane of buttercream acceptance. She walked over to the small bookshelf in her living room and picked up a worn, faded recipe book. The cover was gone, the spine held together with yellowing tape. Mrs Gable's book. It was filled with her spidery, elegant handwriting, with notes in the margins and flour smudges on every page. Maia opened it to a random page. *Madeira Cake. The secret, my dear girl, is not to rush the creaming.*\n\nShe ran her thumb over the words. This final bake was for Mrs Gable. A tribute, a thank you. Her showstopper was a confectionary recreation of the Auckland skyline, a towering masterpiece of lemon and elderflower sponge, white chocolate glacage, and spun sugar details. The Sky Tower, a delicate shard of pulled isomalt. It was ambitious. It was terrifying. It was everything.\n\nWith a final check of her tiny apartment\u2014everything neat, everything in its place, a fortress against the untidiness of the world\u2014she grabbed her keys from the bowl by the door. The little silver key for The Biscuit felt cool and solid in her palm. A key to her car. A key to the final. A key to her future.\n\nDownstairs, the air was thick with the scent of warm laundry and chemical softener from the laundromat. The Biscuit was parked in its usual spot, looking small and slightly weary under the glare of the morning sun. Maia gave the bonnet a reassuring pat.\n\n\"Don't you let me down today,\" she whispered to the car, feeling only slightly ridiculous. \"We've got a date with destiny, you and I.\"\n\nShe loaded the last of her bags, the cooler bags containing her precious, perfectly tempered chocolate and delicate cr\u00e8me p\u00e2tissi\u00e8re, into the back seat with the reverence of a bomb disposal expert. She settled into the driver's seat, the familiar worn fabric a comfort. The lucky apron, a cheerful yellow and white gingham, sat beside her. She turned the key. The engine sputtered, coughed, then reluctantly turned over with a long, pained groan that sounded suspiciously like its owner on a Monday morning. It settled into a rough, rattling idle. Good enough.\n\nMaia pulled out of the parking spot, her heart thumping a steady, nervous rhythm against her ribs. She navigated the familiar streets of Kingsland, past caf\u00e9s just opening up, their signs promising flat whites and cronuts. The journey to the film studio out in West Auckland should take forty-five minutes. The final started in three hours. Plenty of time. She allowed herself a small, genuine smile. For the first time, the road ahead felt clear. It was a straight shot, a direct line from here to the start of the rest of her life. The sun was out, a good omen. The radio was playing a cheerful, upbeat song. Nothing could possibly go wrong."

                                        "text": "The Northwestern Motorway was a river of metal and light, flowing steadily towards the city. Maia merged into the current, The Biscuit chugging along gamely in the middle lane. She even allowed herself to turn up the radio, a jaunty pop song filling the small car. Out to her left, the suburbs of West Auckland unfolded, a patchwork of tile and timber. To her right, the familiar form of the city skyline shimmered in the morning haze, the very same skyline she intended to build from sugar and hope. The anxiety in her chest had eased, replaced by a thrum of pure, unadulterated excitement. This was happening. It was real.\n\nThe first hint of trouble was a subtle one, a slight hesitation as she pressed the accelerator to overtake a truck. The engine, which had been rattling along with a familiar rhythm, seemed to miss a beat. The radio crackled, the singer\u2019s voice dissolving into a burst of static before returning. Maia frowned, her fingers tightening on the steering wheel. She gave the dashboard a light, cautionary tap, a silent plea for cooperation. The car gave a violent shudder in response, a full-body convulsion that sent a jolt of alarm through her. The pained groan from her driveway returned, deeper this time, a guttural, metallic sound of something vital giving up.\n\nPanic, cold and sharp, pierced through her excitement. The accelerator was suddenly limp and useless beneath her foot. The car was losing speed, fast. In her rearview mirror, a silver SUV loomed, its driver\u2019s mouth already open in an angry shout. She flicked on her hazard lights, the frantic clicking sound a weak counterpoint to the roar of the motorway. The power steering died, and the wheel became heavy and obstinate in her hands. With all the strength in her arms, she began to wrench the car towards the left-hand shoulder, a desperate, clumsy manoeuvre across two lanes of fast-moving traffic. Horns blared around her, a cacophony of outrage and alarm. She didn't dare look at the faces of the other drivers, keeping her eyes fixed on the narrow strip of gravel and weeds that represented safety.\n\nWith a final, dying lurch, The Biscuit rolled onto the shoulder and came to a dead stop. The engine fell silent. The sudden absence of its rattling hum was more terrifying than the noise had been. All she could hear now was the thunder of cars hurtling past just feet away, the force of their passage rocking her little car. She switched the hazard lights off and on again, but they were dead. The whole car was dead. Maia stared through the windscreen, her breath coming in short, sharp gasps. The sun, which had felt like a blessing minutes ago, was now a malevolent force, beating down on the car's thin metal roof. She glanced at the clock on her phone. 8:47 AM. The minutes were already starting to bleed away. Her gaze drifted to the back seat, to the cooler bags sitting in a neat row. Her cr\u00e8me p\u00e2tissi\u00e8re, her tempered chocolate collars, her delicate lemon curd. They were on a timer. The warmth of the car was no longer a comfort; it was a ticking bomb.\n\nThe familiar, crushing feeling of helplessness washed over her, a ghost from her past. This was the chaos she had spent her life trying to outrun, the unpredictable disaster that always lurked just around the corner, ready to undo all her careful planning. Control was an illusion. Her confident words to Liam echoed in her head, a bitter mockery. *\u2018Everything is under control.\u2019* She wanted to laugh, or maybe scream. She was stranded, a ghost on the edge of the city once more, invisible to the thousands of people rushing past on their way to their solid, reliable lives. The caf\u00e9 in Devonport, the sea-green door, the foundation she was so close to building\u2014it all seemed to be dissolving like spun sugar in the rain.\n\nWith a shaking hand, she found Liam\u2019s contact in her phone and pressed call. It rang twice before he picked up, his voice still cheerful. \"Change of heart? Want me to bring the ute and a brass band to welcome you?\"\n\n\"Liam,\" she said, and was horrified to hear her own voice, thin and tight with unshed tears. \"Liam, it happened.\"\n\nThe cheer vanished from his voice, replaced by an immediate, sharp concern. \"What happened? Are you okay? Did someone hit you?\"\n\n\"No, I\u2019m fine. It's The Biscuit.\" She swallowed, trying to force the lump in her throat down. \"She's dead. Completely dead. I'm on the side of the Northwestern, just before the Te Atat\u016b exit.\"\n\nThere was a moment of silence on his end, then the sound of a muffled curse and the clatter of what sounded like a wrench hitting a concrete floor. \"Okay. Okay, don't panic. Stay in the car, doors locked. I'm on my way. Traffic is a nightmare heading west, but I'll get there. Can you call roadside assistance?\"\n\n\"I\u2026 yes. I think so.\" The thought hadn't even occurred to her. Her mind had gone blank, filled only with the image of her perfect showstopper melting into a puddle in the back seat. \"Liam, the final starts in less than three hours. My ingredients\u2026\"\n\n\"We'll figure it out, Maia,\" he said, his voice firm, trying to project a confidence neither of them felt. \"One problem at a time. First, let's get you and your sugar off the side of a motorway. Call the tow service. I'm leaving now. Just\u2026 hang tight, Hart. I'm coming.\""

She fumbled through the glove compartment, her fingers clumsy with adrenaline, past old service receipts and a crumpled map of the Coromandel Peninsula. She found the membership card, its plastic flimsy and worn. The automated voice on the other end of the line was maddeningly calm, asking her to press one for this, two for that. Each menu option was a fresh wave of frustration. When she finally reached a human operator, a man with a bored, monotone voice, she had to repeat her location three times over the roar of passing trucks.\n\n\u201cOkay, ma\u2019am. We\u2019ve got a truck en route. Should be there within sixty to ninety minutes.\u201d\n\n\u201cNinety minutes?\u201d The words came out as a squeak. \u201cI can\u2019t wait that long! It\u2019s an emergency!\u201d\n\n\u201cIs the vehicle on fire, ma\u2019am? Are you or any passengers injured?\u201d the man asked, his tone unchanged.\n\n\u201cNo, but\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThen it\u2019s not a priority-one callout. The driver will be there as soon as he can. Please remain in your vehicle with your hazard lights on.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy hazard lights don\u2019t work! The whole car is dead!\u201d she cried, but the line had already clicked off, replaced by a dial tone. Sixty to ninety minutes. It was a death sentence. Her grand final, her dream, would be over before the tow truck even arrived. A wave of nausea rolled through her. She leaned her forehead against the steering wheel, the cheap plastic hot against her skin. The smell of hot vinyl and old dust filled her nostrils. She was going to fail. Not because her sponge wasn\u2019t light enough, or her ganache hadn't emulsified, but because of a faulty alternator in a twenty-year-old car. It was so mundane, so pathetic.\n\nShe forced herself to sit up, her gaze falling once more on the cooler bags in the back. Her beautiful, stable Italian meringue buttercream would be weeping. Her cr\u00e8me p\u00e2tissi\u00e8re, a delicate custard that relied on cold to maintain its integrity, would be turning slack and grainy. The chocolate collars, tempered to a perfect, glossy snap, would be softening, losing their shine, becoming dull and pedestrian. She could almost feel the heat radiating from the car's roof, a malevolent oven undoing all her work. Desperate, she twisted around and unzipped the largest cooler bag. The ice packs inside were already slick with condensation, their hard-frozen shapes beginning to soften at the edges. The containers of cream and curd felt cool, but not cold. It wouldn't last.\n\nTime stretched and warped. Every minute that ticked by on her phone felt like an hour. The stream of traffic was relentless, a hypnotising blur of colour and motion. No one looked. No one saw her. She was just another breakdown, a temporary inconvenience in the day of a thousand strangers. A flash of blue and red in her rearview mirror made her jump. A police car, lights flashing silently, pulled in behind The Biscuit. A tall, broad-shouldered officer got out, his face unreadable behind a pair of reflective sunglasses. He walked towards her window with a purposeful stride, his hand resting lightly on his belt. Maia\u2019s heart hammered against her ribs. She fumbled to wind down the window, the manual crank stiff and protesting.\n\n\u201cMorning, miss,\u201d he said, his voice loud but not unkind over the traffic noise. \u201cHaving a bit of trouble?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy car just died,\u201d she said, her voice trembling slightly. \u201cThe whole electrical system, I think. I\u2019ve called for a tow truck, but they said it could be an hour and a half.\u201d\n\nThe officer nodded, his gaze sweeping over the interior of the car, lingering for a moment on the cooler bags in the back. \u201cRight. Well, you\u2019re in a dangerous spot here. The longer you\u2019re on the shoulder, the higher the risk of someone drifting over. We need to get this vehicle cleared as soon as possible.\u201d He spoke with the calm authority of someone who dealt with this every day. To him, her crisis was just a box to be ticked.\n\n\u201cI know, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d she stammered. \u201cI\u2019m a finalist in the Great Kiwi Bake Off. The final is this morning. All my ingredients are in the back\u2026 they\u2019re going to spoil in the heat.\u201d The words tumbled out, sounding foolish and desperate even to her own ears.\n\nThe officer\u2019s expression didn't change. The reflection in his sunglasses showed a distorted, wide-angle view of the motorway. \u201cIs that so? Well, congratulations. But my priority right now is road safety. I\u2019ll see if I can\u2019t hurry your tow along.\u201d He walked back to his car and spoke into his radio. Maia watched him, a knot of dread tightening in her stomach. He wasn't her saviour; he was just another complication, another person in a uniform who saw her not as a person, but as a problem to be managed. The dreams of her Devonport caf\u00e9, with its sea-green door and the smell of cardamom, felt like a fantasy from another lifetime."

                                        "text": "The officer returned to her window, his expression still neutral. The mirrored sunglasses made it impossible to tell if her plea had registered at all. He leaned down, placing his hands on the doorframe. \u201cRight, Miss Hart. I\u2019ve spoken with dispatch. The best I can do is get the motorway patrol tow here, but they\u2019re still twenty minutes out, minimum. We can\u2019t leave the vehicle here for that long. It\u2019s a hazard.\u201d\n\nTwenty minutes. In twenty minutes, the delicate balance of her cr\u00e8me p\u00e2tissi\u00e8re would be a lost cause. \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d Maia asked, her voice small. \u201cWhere will they take it?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll tow it to the nearest impound yard. You can collect it from there once you\u2019ve paid the fee.\u201d He said it so matter-of-factly, as if he were explaining the rules of a simple game. An impound yard. A fee. More chaos, more complications, more money she didn\u2019t have. It was all spiralling away from her. He must have seen the despair on her face, because he paused, his head tilting slightly. \u201cThe Great Kiwi Bake Off, you said? With the posh judges?\u201d\n\nMaia nodded numbly, not trusting herself to speak.\n\n\u201cMy wife loves that show,\u201d the officer said, a hint of something human entering his voice. \u201cNever misses it. She\u2019s a terrible baker, mind you. Sets the smoke alarm off trying to make toast.\u201d He looked back at the cooler bags again. \u201cShe was very impressed with that rose Battenberg you made. Said it looked too good to eat.\u201d A ghost of a smile touched his lips. \u201cI reckon she\u2019d be gutted if you didn\u2019t make the final because of a dodgy alternator.\u201d\n\nThe unexpected kindness was like a crack in a dam. A single, hot tear escaped and slid down Maia\u2019s cheek. She hastily wiped it away with the back of her hand. \u201cI just\u2026 I don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI can\u2019t lose this.\u201d\n\nThe officer\u2019s face softened. \u201cRight. Okay. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do. We can\u2019t save the car right now, but we can save the cake stuff. Have you got a friend who can come and get you? Or I can call you a taxi? You can take your gear and go. I\u2019ll wait with the vehicle until the tow arrives and handle the paperwork.\u201d\n\nIt was an offer of such simple, practical help that it stunned her. He was giving her a way out. A chance. \u201cMy friend is on his way,\u201d she said, her voice thick with gratitude. \u201cHe\u2019s a mechanic. He\u2019s coming from his workshop in Avondale.\u201d\n\nAs if summoned by her words, a vehicle swerved aggressively from the fast lane, cutting across two lanes of traffic with a squeal of tyres and a chorus of angry horns. It was a battered, rust-pocked ute that might have once been blue, but was now a patchwork of primer grey and grime. It shuddered to a halt behind the police car, its engine rattling like a can full of bolts. Liam. He vaulted out of the driver's side before the engine had even fully cut out, his lanky frame radiating frantic energy. He was wearing his work overalls, a smudge of black grease cutting a sharp line across his cheekbone. He took one look at Maia in the car, the police officer beside her, and his face was a mask of alarm.\n\n\u201cMaia! Are you okay? What\u2019s going on?\u201d he yelled, jogging towards them, dodging the wing mirror of a passing bus.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Liam! I\u2019m fine!\u201d she called out, a wave of profound relief washing over her. He was here. Her family was here.\n\nThe police officer held up a hand to slow him down. \u201cEasy does it, son. No need to cause another accident.\u201d He turned back to Maia. \u201cIs this your mechanic?\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is Liam,\u201d she said, managing a real smile for the first time that morning.\n\nLiam skidded to a stop beside the officer, breathing heavily. \u201cThe car\u2019s dead,\u201d Maia explained quickly. \u201cThe electrics are gone. This officer was just helping me. We have to get my ingredients out and go. The tow is coming to take The Biscuit away.\u201d\n\nLiam\u2019s eyes darted from Maia to the cooler bags and back again. The mechanic in him visibly mourned the car for a split second, but the friend took over immediately. \u201cRight. Operation Sugar Lift is a go.\u201d He gave the officer a quick, respectful nod. \u201cThanks, officer. For looking after her.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust doing my job,\u201d the officer replied gruffly, though his gaze had softened. \u201cNow let\u2019s get this done. The sooner you\u2019re out of the live lane, the better.\u201d\n\nWhat followed was a frantic, coordinated ballet of desperation on the narrow motorway shoulder. Liam threw open the passenger door of his ute, revealing a cab that smelled strongly of oil and was littered with stray sockets and crumpled coffee cups. He cleared the passenger seat with a single swipe of his arm, tossing a greasy rag into the back. Maia unbuckled and scrambled out of The Biscuit, the heat and noise of the traffic hitting her with physical force. Together, they began transferring the precious cargo. Each cooler bag was lifted with the utmost care, a fragile parcel of hope passed from her hands to his.\n\n\u201cCareful with the blue one!\u201d she instructed, her voice high with stress. \u201cThat\u2019s the cr\u00e8me p\u00e2t and the lemon curd. They need to stay flat!\u201d\n\n\u201cGot it, got it. Treating them like unstable nitroglycerin,\u201d Liam muttered, carefully sliding the bag onto the floor of his ute. They worked in silence for a moment, the roar of the traffic their only soundtrack. With the last bag safely transferred, Maia paused and looked back at The Biscuit. Her little sea-mist green car looked forlorn and abandoned, its journey over. A lump formed in her throat. It was just a car, but it was her car. Her freedom.\n\n\u201cHey,\u201d Liam said softly, touching her arm. \u201cIt\u2019s just metal, Hart. We\u2019ll get her back later. Right now, you\u2019ve got a bake-off to win.\u201d He pulled her into a quick, one-armed hug that smelled of engine oil and unwavering loyalty.\n\nShe nodded, taking a deep, fortifying breath. He was right. She slammed the door of The Biscuit shut, a final, sad goodbye. She turned to the police officer, who was watching them with his arms crossed. \u201cThank you,\u201d she said, the words feeling utterly inadequate. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I would have done.\u201d\n\nHe gave a slight nod. \u201cMy wife will be watching tonight. Don\u2019t make me tell her you got disqualified. Name\u2019s Officer Miller, by the way.\u201d He permitted himself another small smile. \u201cGood luck, Miss Hart.\u201d\n\nMaia clambered into the passenger seat of the ute, pulling the door shut. Liam was already behind the wheel, turning the key. The engine coughed back to life with its familiar, unhealthy rattle. He checked the mirror, then with a boldness that bordered on suicidal, he pulled out into the traffic, flooring the accelerator. The ute roared in protest but lurched forward, merging into the river of cars. In the wing mirror, Maia saw Officer Miller standing beside her dead car, a solid, reassuring figure diminishing in the distance. They were moving. They were on their way. She glanced at her phone. 9:15 AM. They had lost almost forty-five minutes. The race was far from over."

                                        "text": "## Chapter 2\n\nThe journey in Liam's ute was a violent, rattling assault on the senses. The cabin smelled overwhelmingly of metal, oil, and the faint, sweet scent of the industrial-strength hand-cleaner Liam used. Every pothole and lane change was a jolt that threatened to send the precariously balanced cooler bags tumbling. Liam drove with a focused intensity, his knuckles white on the steering wheel, weaving through the traffic with a terrifying lack of regard for indicators or the angry shouts of other drivers. He was a man with a mission, and the mission was getting his best friend and her precious cargo of dairy and sugar to their destination in one piece. Maia found herself bracing her feet against the floor and holding a protective arm over the cooler bag on her lap, as if she could personally absorb the shocks of the road.\n\n\"How's the cargo holding up?\" Liam asked, his eyes flicking from the road to her face and back again. \"Is the buttercream still\u2026 butter and creamy?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" Maia said, her voice tight. \"I'm too scared to look. The ice packs felt like they were turning into sad bags of lukewarm water.\" Resisting the urge was impossible. With fumbling fingers, she unzipped the nearest cooler. The blast of air that emerged was cool, not cold. The containers were beaded with sweat. She picked up the tub of her Italian meringue buttercream. It looked stable, miraculously. But then she lifted the container of cr\u00e8me p\u00e2tissi\u00e8re. She gave it a gentle tilt. It moved too quickly, a slack, unhappy wobble that told her the starch structure was beginning to break down. It wasn't ruined, not yet, but it was compromised. A deep, sick feeling settled in her stomach.\n\n\"It's not good, Liam. The cr\u00e8me p\u00e2t is going to be soupy.\" She fought to keep the tremor out of her voice. \"And my chocolate collars for the base of the towers\u2026 if they've lost their temper in this heat, they'll have no snap. They'll be dull and soft.\"\n\n\"Okay,\" Liam said, his voice level. \"So you'll have to re-whisk the custard over an ice bath. You can do that. And the chocolate? You're the chocolate whisperer, Hart. You can re-temper it in ten minutes flat. This is just an extra little challenge to prove you're the best. A handicap, to make it fair on the other two.\" His determined optimism was so quintessentially Liam that she almost smiled. He refused to entertain the possibility of failure, and for a moment, his belief was infectious.\n\nThey screeched into the film studio's car park with ten minutes to spare before filming was scheduled to begin. Before Liam had even killed the noisy engine, a young woman with a headset and a panicked expression was running towards them, clipboard clutched to her chest. \"Maia! Oh my god, Maia! We were about to send out a search party! The producers are having kittens. Where have you been?\"\n\n\"Car trouble,\" Maia said, throwing her door open and practically falling out of the high seat of the ute. \"Long story.\" Liam was already out and halfway to the back, lowering the tailgate with a rusty screech. He began passing the cooler bags to Maia and the frantic production assistant, whose name was Sarah. The other two finalists, a stern-faced architect from Christchurch named David and a bubbly, ruthlessly competent retiree from the Hawke's Bay named June, were visible through the open doors of the studio. They were already at their stations, aprons on, equipment laid out in neat, orderly rows. They looked calm, prepared, and impossibly clean. Maia, in contrast, felt like she\u2019d just survived a natural disaster, her hair coming loose from its bun, her cheek smudged with dirt from where she'd leaned against the ute's grimy door.\n\nLiam, a grease-stained apparition in a world of pastel-coloured stand mixers, helped her haul the last of the bags into the vast, brightly-lit studio. The familiar scent of the Bake Off tent\u2014a strange but comforting mix of warm sugar, industrial cleaning supplies, and ozone from the lighting rigs\u2014filled her lungs. The set was exactly as she\u2019d left it, but seeing it now, in her state of high alert, it felt alien and intimidating. The judges were in a huddle with the director, casting anxious glances her way. Liam set the final bag down on the stainless-steel workbench of her station, the one with her name on it. He squeezed her shoulder, his hand warm and solid. \"This is your house,\" he murmured, his voice low so only she could hear. \"You own this place. Now go show them what you're made of.\" He gave her a final, crooked grin before turning to be politely but firmly escorted from the set by Sarah.\n\nLeft alone at her station, the full weight of the morning's catastrophe crashed down on her. Her neat rows of pre-weighed ingredients were gone, replaced by a jumble of cooler bags. Her perfectly planned schedule was in tatters. She had five hours to create a masterpiece, and she was starting with a forty-five-minute deficit and compromised ingredients. With trembling hands, she began to unpack. The buttercream was, thankfully, fine. The lemon and elderflower sponges she'd baked last night were still wrapped and perfect. But her fears about the chocolate were confirmed. She peeled back the baking paper from one of the tall, elegant collars she had painstakingly crafted. The deep, glossy brown was gone, replaced by a chalky, greyish bloom. When she lifted it, it felt soft, bending slightly in her hand instead of holding its rigid shape. It had no snap. It was useless. A fresh wave of despair washed over her. She would have to melt it all down and start the entire, painstaking tempering process again.\n\n\"Bakers, one minute to the start of your final Showstopper!\" The host's booming, cheerful voice echoed through the studio, making her flinch. \"I trust we've all had a calm and relaxing morning?\" He gave her a pointed look and a theatrical wink, and a ripple of polite laughter went through the crew. Maia felt her cheeks burn. She wasn't an object of sympathy; she was a dramatic anecdote, a bit of colour for the show's narrative. She took a deep breath, her eyes falling on the lucky gingham apron sitting on top of one of her bags. She untied the messy bun, quickly re-did it into a tight knot, and tied the apron around her waist. The familiar ritual was grounding. She laid out her tools. Whisk, bowls, spatula. She thought of Mrs Gable's patient hands guiding her own. *The secret, my dear girl, is not to rush.* She thought of the sea-green door of her imaginary caf\u00e9. It wasn't just a bake. It was a foundation. The noise of the studio faded into a low hum. It was just her, her bench, and the ingredients.\n\n\"Your final challenge,\" announced the head judge, his voice resonating with gravitas, \"is to create a Showstopper spectacle that pays tribute to your hometown. It must be a towering work of edible art, telling us a story about the place that made you. You have five hours. On your marks\u2026 get set\u2026\" Maia closed her eyes for a fraction of a second, a silent prayer sent out to no one in particular. The chaos was behind her. The future was on this bench.\n\n\"BAKE!\""

                                        "text": "## Chapter 3\n\nThe sound of the starting call was a physical blow, a sonic boom that seemed to push all the air from Maia\u2019s lungs. Around her, the studio erupted into a quiet, purposeful hum. To her left, June, the retiree, was already tipping flour into a sifter, her movements economical and practiced. To her right, David the architect was laying out rulers and a set square against a piece of parchment paper, preparing to cut his sponges with surgical precision. They moved with the unhurried grace of people whose mornings had been calm, whose ingredients were resting at the perfect temperature in the on-set fridges. Maia, by contrast, felt like she was in the middle of a controlled demolition. Her bench was a disaster zone of half-unpacked bags and condensation-slicked containers.\n\nFor a terrifying, frozen moment, she couldn't move. Her mind was a white-out of panic. The five-hour clock on the large studio screen seemed to be mocking her, the red digits already counting down a life she was no longer living. Then, Mrs. Gable\u2019s voice, a gentle murmur from a long-ago memory, surfaced through the noise. *When the kitchen is chaos, dear girl, clean your station. A tidy bench is a tidy mind.* It wasn't a solution, but it was an action. With a surge of desperate energy, Maia began to move. She ripped the remaining containers from the cooler bags, sloshing water onto the floor. She slammed the bloomed chocolate onto a chopping board, threw the soupy cr\u00e8me p\u00e2tissi\u00e8re into a blast chiller, hoping the sudden shock of cold might slow its demise, and shoved the empty bags under her bench. It wasn't tidy, but it was a start. It was a declaration of war against the chaos.\n\nOne problem at a time. Liam\u2019s voice this time, steady and sure. The chocolate was the biggest problem. It was the foundation of her entire structure, the elegant, dark collars that would form the base of her sponge towers. Without their structural integrity, the entire edible skyline would collapse. There was no alternative but to re-temper the whole batch. With a heavy chef\u2019s knife, she began to attack the soft, chalky blocks of chocolate, the rhythmic *thump-thump-thump* on the board a counterpoint to the frantic beating of her heart. She worked with furious precision, her movements sharp and angry, chopping the chocolate into fine, even shards that would melt quickly. She filled a saucepan with an inch of water and set it on her induction hob, placing a glass bowl over the top. The science of it was a small, solid island in her sea of panic. Heat, but not too much. Melt two-thirds of the chocolate, stirring constantly. When it's smooth, take it off the heat, add the remaining third, the seed chocolate, to cool it down. Stir, stir, stir until it reaches the magic number. Thirty-one degrees Celsius for dark chocolate. A number she knew as well as her own name.\n\n\u201cQuite the dramatic entrance, Maia.\u201d A deep, familiar voice startled her. She looked up to see the judges, Paul and Sue, standing before her bench. Paul, the head judge, was a man whose formidable reputation was built on his piercing blue eyes and his intolerance for imperfection. His gaze swept over her chaotic bench, his lips a thin, unimpressed line. Sue, whose warmth was the perfect foil to Paul\u2019s steel, looked at her with genuine concern. \u201cSarah told us you had a bit of a breakdown. Are you alright, my dear?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m fine, thank you,\u201d Maia said, trying to keep her voice steady as she scraped the sides of her chocolate bowl. \u201cThe Biscuit decided to retire on the Northwestern Motorway, that\u2019s all.\u201d\n\nPaul leaned forward, his eyes narrowing on the bowl of melting chocolate. \u201cAnd your ingredients? I assume they weren't enjoying the morning sun.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome of them are a little\u2026 compromised,\u201d she admitted, refusing to let her gaze drop. \u201cI\u2019m having to re-temper my chocolate and I\u2019m hoping to salvage the cr\u00e8me p\u00e2tissi\u00e8re. I\u2019ve lost some time, but the plan is still the same.\u201d\n\n\u201cAmbitious,\u201d Paul noted, his tone giving nothing away. He gestured towards the sponges she\u2019d frantically unwrapped. \u201cYour Auckland skyline. The sponges are lemon and elderflower, the towers will be supported by these chocolate collars, and the Sky Tower is pulled sugar?\u201d She nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge undertaking on a good day, Maia. Today, it might just be impossible. You\u2019re leaving yourself with no room for error.\u201d His words were not cruel, but they were factual, and the truth of them landed like a lead weight in her gut.\n\n\u201cMaia has a habit of thriving under pressure, Paul,\u201d Sue interjected gently. \u201cHer opera cake in the semi-final was a masterclass in composure.\u201d She gave Maia a small, encouraging smile. \u201cJust focus on one step at a time. We\u2019ll be very interested to see if you can pull this off.\u201d They moved on, leaving a wake of silence behind them. Impossible. The word echoed in her head. She glanced at the clock. Thirty-five minutes gone. Thirty-five minutes, and all she had was a bowl of melting chocolate.\n\nWith the judges gone, she worked with a new intensity, fuelled by a potent mix of fear and spite. She would not let Paul be right. She would not be the sob story of the final. She focused on the thermometer in the chocolate, watching the numbers climb. Once the chocolate was melted, she pulled it from the heat and tipped in the remaining shards, beginning the crucial cooling process. The rhythmic scrape and fold of the spatula was hypnotic. While she stirred, she pulled the cr\u00e8me p\u00e2tissi\u00e8re from the blast chiller. It was colder, but still tragically loose. She tipped it into a metal bowl set over an ice bath and picked up a whisk. Then began the most gruelling task of all: re-emulsifying the custard by hand. Her arm screamed in protest as she whipped furiously, the thin, grainy mixture resisting her efforts. It was a battle of wills, her against a bowl of rogue starch molecules.\n\nMinutes blurred. Her world shrank to the bowl of chocolate, the bowl of custard, and the ticking clock. Out of the corner of her eye, she saw David begin to assemble his structure, a crystalline representation of Christchurch's Cardboard Cathedral, his movements maddeningly precise. June was piping a cascade of buttercream wisteria onto her bake, a tribute to Hamilton Gardens. They were building. She was still just fixing. Her arm ached, her back was stiff, and a single bead of sweat traced a path down her temple. Just as she felt her arm was about to give out, she felt a change in the custard. The whisk met more resistance. The liquid began to thicken, the grainy texture smoothing out. It was working. A small gasp of relief escaped her. It was thick, silky, and stable. She tasted it. Still delicious. She shoved it into the fridge, a small victory won.\n\nShe turned her full attention back to the chocolate. It was thick, glossy, and had cooled to thirty-three degrees. Almost there. She continued to stir, gently, patiently, nudging it down, degree by agonising degree. Thirty-two. Thirty-one point five. Finally, thirty-one. The magic number. There was no time to celebrate. She grabbed the acetate sheets she\u2019d cut for her collars and began to work, spreading the warm, liquid chocolate in smooth, even layers. Her hands, which had been shaking minutes before, were now rock-steady. This was her alchemy. This was her control. She worked quickly, the muscle memory from a thousand hours of practice taking over. As she placed the final, perfectly coated sheet onto a tray to set, she dipped a clean spatula into the leftover chocolate in the bowl and set it on the bench. The test. If it set quickly with a glossy finish and a sharp snap, she had done it. If it was dull or soft, the last hour of her life had been for nothing. She didn't have time to watch it. She had to trust the science. She had towers to build."

                                        "text": "With the chocolate work setting, there was no time to breathe. Maia turned to her sponges, her movements economical and stripped of all hesitation. She had three tall, cylindrical towers to build, representing the cluster of buildings at the heart of the city. She grabbed her serrated knife and began to torte the lemon and elderflower sponges, levelling the tops and slicing them into neat, even layers. The sweet, floral scent of the elderflower rose up to meet her, a familiar comfort. This was her territory.\n\nWhile her left hand sliced, her right hand was already pulling bowls from the fridge. The salvaged cr\u00e8me p\u00e2tissi\u00e8re, now beautifully thick and holding its shape, was dolloped into a piping bag. Her Italian meringue buttercream, which had mercifully survived the journey, was a cloud of pale, rose-scented perfection. She began to assemble the first tower with a speed that bordered on violent. A layer of sponge, a quick brush of lemon syrup to keep it moist, a perfect piped ring of buttercream to act as a dam, and then a generous filling of the elderflower cr\u00e8me p\u00e2t. Another layer of sponge, press down gently, repeat. Sponge, syrup, dam, fill. It became a mantra, a frantic, repetitive dance of hands and ingredients. She wasn\u2019t thinking, just doing. Her mind was blessedly empty of everything but the task in front of her.\n\nA camera operator drifted closer, the red light on his camera a small, intrusive eye. He zoomed in on her hands as she worked, capturing the blur of motion. She ignored him, her focus absolute. She glanced over at David\u2019s bench. His Cardboard Cathedral was already standing, a complex and beautiful structure of gingerbread panels held together with flawless royal icing. He was now painstakingly applying edible silver leaf to the details. June was arranging a tumble of glistening, sugared berries around the base of her wisteria-covered bake. They were on to decoration. She was still on construction. The thought, which should have sent a fresh spike of panic through her, was instead clarifying. It was her against the clock. Nothing else mattered.\n\nHer gaze fell on the spatula she\u2019d coated with the test chocolate. It was no longer a liquid smear. It was a solid, dark, gleaming shell. She picked it up. With a slight pressure from her thumb, it broke with a clean, sharp *snap*. The sound was as beautiful as a symphony. It was perfect. A surge of pure, unadulterated triumph shot through her, a hit of adrenaline more potent than caffeine. Paul could say it was impossible, the clock could count down to zero, but she had wrestled this chocolate into submission. She was back in the fight.\n\nThe three towers of sponge and cream stood on her bench, looking naked and vulnerable. The next step was the one she dreaded most. She carefully carried the tray of chocolate collars from the cooling rack. They had set into beautiful, semi-flexible sheets of glossy dark chocolate. This was the point of no return. If they cracked, or if they were too soft and smudged, the entire aesthetic of her bake would be ruined. She would have clean, modern towers or she would have a mess. Holding her breath, she picked up the first collar. She measured it against the tower, trimmed the top with a hot knife, and then, in one smooth, fluid motion, wrapped it around the cake. It was like dressing a doll, a very fragile, very edible doll. The acetate backing peeled away cleanly, revealing a flawless, gleaming chocolate surface. It held. It was perfect.\n\nOne down. Two to go. She repeated the process, her hands working with a new confidence. The second tower was wrapped just as smoothly. And then the third. They stood in a neat row, three sleek, dark cylinders filled with the promise of lemon and elderflower. They looked architectural, solid, intentional. They looked like the start of a skyline. She allowed herself the briefest glance at the clock. An hour and fifteen minutes had passed. She had lost so much time, but looking at the three towers standing proud on her bench, she hadn't just salvaged her bake. She had clawed her way back from disaster. Now for the hard part: making it a masterpiece."

                                        "text": "Now, for the artistry. The three towers were a bold, minimalist statement, but her vision was of the Auckland skyline at dawn, when the first light hits the city, painting it in soft, ethereal shades. This required the white chocolate glacage, a mirror glaze so notoriously temperamental that many professional pastry chefs avoided it. It needed to be fluid enough to pour in a thin, even sheet, yet viscous enough to cling to the sides of the towers without dripping into a puddle at the base. The temperature had to be exact, a narrow window of only a degree or two. Too hot, and it would be transparent and melt the chocolate collars beneath. Too cold, and it would be a thick, lumpy mess.\n\nWith the confidence of her small victory fuelling her, Maia worked with renewed focus. She bloomed her gelatin leaves in ice water while she gently heated a mixture of water, sugar, and glucose syrup. Once dissolved, she poured the hot liquid over a bowl of high-quality white chocolate and condensed milk, whisking until the chocolate melted completely. The mixture was a pale, creamy yellow. She added the softened gelatin and then, using an immersion blender held at a precise angle to avoid introducing air bubbles, she blitzed the glacage until it was impossibly smooth. The final touch was a few drops of titanium dioxide, a whitener that would turn the glaze a brilliant, opaque white. Now came the worst part: the waiting. The glaze had to cool to exactly thirty-five degrees Celsius. She set the bowl aside, a thermometer clipped to its side, and got to work arranging her towers on a wire rack set over a clean baking tray.\n\n\u201cFeeling brave today with a mirror glaze, I see!\u201d It was the host, a woman with a permanently sunny disposition and a love for a good baking pun. \u201cAre you hoping your chances are as smooth as your finish?\u201d\n\nMaia offered a tight, distracted smile, her eyes fixed on the thermometer. Thirty-eight degrees. \u201cSomething like that. Just hoping it doesn't turn into a sticky situation.\u201d The thermometer crept down. Thirty-seven. Thirty-six. The studio lights felt impossibly hot on the back of her neck. Come on. She gave the glaze a final, gentle stir. Thirty-five. Now. There was no time to hesitate. She lifted the bowl, her arm steady, and in one long, continuous motion, poured the pristine white liquid over the top of the first tower. It flowed down the sides like a sheet of liquid silk, clinging perfectly to the dark chocolate, a beautiful, stark contrast. She moved immediately to the second, then the third. The excess glaze pooled on the tray below, leaving three perfectly coated, gleaming white towers. They looked like polished marble. It had worked.\n\nThe final, and most terrifying, element was the Sky Tower. The crowning glory of her bake, a delicate, needle-thin shard of pulled isomalt sugar that had to be both elegant and structurally sound enough to stand on its own. This was where art met high-risk chemistry. She pulled on a pair of thick, heat-proof gloves and poured isomalt nibs into a heavy-bottomed pan, heating them until they melted into a clear, bubbling liquid that looked as innocuous as water but was hotter than boiling oil. Carefully, she poured the molten sugar onto a silicone mat to cool slightly. As soon as it was cool enough to handle\u2014a stage that lasted only a minute or two\u2014she began to work it. She pulled and folded the sugar, stretching it out into long ropes and looping it back on itself. The motion incorporated millions of tiny air bubbles, transforming the clear sugar into an opaque, pearlescent mass with the sheen of satin. It was hot, exhausting work. Her gloved hands burned with the radiant heat, and the muscles in her arms and back screamed in protest.\n\nWith the sugar pulled to a perfect satin finish, the race against time began. As it cooled, it would become brittle and unworkable. She had to shape it now. With swift, practiced movements, she began to stretch and taper the mass of sugar, her fingers gently coaxing it into the iconic shape of the Sky Tower. It was a dance of immense pressure and delicate touch. Too much force and it would shatter; too little and she would lose the shape. She formed the base, the main shaft, and finally, the delicate, needle-like spire at the very top. It was fragile, a whisper of spun sugar that looked as though a breath could destroy it. With infinite care, she transferred it to a clean mat to cool completely, her heart hammering in her chest.\n\nThe voice of the host boomed through the studio. \u201cBakers, you have two minutes remaining! Two minutes!\u201d The words jolted Maia from her sugar-induced trance. She looked at her bench. She had three white towers on a wire rack, a fragile sugar sculpture, and an empty presentation board. With frantic haste, she used a palette knife to lift each tower, one by one, and arrange them on the board, clustering them together to create a sense of a dense city center. Her hands were shaking now, the adrenaline of the last five hours hitting her all at once. She carefully lifted the isomalt Sky Tower. It felt weightless and terrifyingly fragile. She positioned it in the center of the cluster, its spire reaching high above the other buildings. It stood. It was a skyline. With the final seconds ticking away, she took a pinch of edible silver dust and blew it gently over the towers, a fine shimmer of light on a new day.\n\n\u201cTen, nine, eight\u2026\u201d The entire crew was counting down. Maia took a step back from her bench, her hands covered in chocolate, buttercream, and the ghosts of near-disasters. She looked at her creation. The Auckland skyline, born of chaos and desperation, stood proud and gleaming under the hot studio lights. It was everything she had imagined. It was ambitious. It was terrifying. And it was finished.\n\n\u201cThree, two, one\u2026 BAKE!\u201d"

                                        "text": "The moment the final \"BAKE!\" echoed through the studio, a profound silence fell over Maia's world. The frantic energy that had propelled her for five straight hours evaporated, leaving a hollow, buzzing exhaustion in its wake. Her legs felt unsteady, her arms as heavy as lead. She took a staggering step back from her bench, her gaze locked on the gleaming white and silver skyline she had somehow pulled from the jaws of disaster. It stood there, shimmering under the lights, a testament to a morning of sheer, unadulterated panic and a lifetime of clinging to the reliable alchemy of flour and sugar. It was her city, not the one that had ignored her, but the one she was claiming for herself, built from memory, hope, and a near-miraculous mirror glaze.\n\nThe studio slowly came back to life around her. A ripple of applause broke out from the crew members lining the walls. The other two finalists, June and David, were sagging against their own benches, their faces pale with a similar mix of relief and fatigue. Maia allowed her eyes to drift to their creations. June's tribute to the Hamilton Gardens was an explosion of life and colour. A multi-layered pistachio and rosewater cake formed a lush, green hillock, from which a cascade of impossibly delicate lavender buttercream wisteria flowers tumbled. Glistening, sugar-dusted berries were scattered at its base like fallen jewels. It was joyful, generous, and quintessentially June.\n\nThen there was David's. His showstopper was exactly what you would expect from a perfectionist architect. A scale model of Christchurch's Cardboard Cathedral, rendered in intricately spiced gingerbread and translucent panes of amber-coloured sugar glass. The lines were razor-sharp, the angles perfect, the royal icing piping so precise it looked as though it had been applied by a machine. It was a masterpiece of technical brilliance, a stunning, sombre tribute to resilience. Looking at the two of them, a fresh wave of doubt washed over Maia. June\u2019s bake had heart. David\u2019s had genius. Hers was just a story of survival.\n\nThe judges, trailed by the hosts, began their slow walk to the front of the tent for the final judging. They started with June. She explained her bake in her warm, bubbly voice, her hands fluttering with excitement. Paul cut into the cake, revealing perfect, even layers of pale green and pink. He nodded slowly as he chewed, his expression unreadable. \u201cThe pistachio is beautifully toasted, June,\u201d he said, his voice carrying through the silent studio. \u201cAnd the rosewater is there, but it\u2019s not fighting for attention. It\u2019s a garden party in a slice. Well done.\u201d Sue was even more effusive, praising the artistry of the buttercream flowers. June beamed, her face flushed with pride. The bar was set high.\n\nNext, they moved to David\u2019s bench. He stood ramrod straight, his hands clasped behind his back, as he explained the geometric principles behind his construction. Paul used a small hammer to tap one of the sugar glass panes, which shattered with a satisfying crackle. He examined a slice of the gingerbread. \u201cThe precision is, as we\u2019ve come to expect, flawless, David,\u201d Paul conceded. \u201cStructurally, it\u2019s an engineering marvel. The spicing in the gingerbread is complex and warming.\u201d He took a bite. \u201cIt\u2019s an incredible piece of work. My only slight critique is that it\u2019s almost\u2026 too perfect. It\u2019s a bake you admire more than you desire to eat.\u201d It was a small criticism, but a significant one. David\u2019s face tightened almost imperceptibly.\n\nThen, they were standing in front of her. All the cameras seemed to swivel in her direction, their dark lenses like a dozen unblinking eyes. Her heart, which had settled into a slow, heavy rhythm, began to pound against her ribs again. \u201cSo, Maia,\u201d Sue began, her voice soft. \u201cAuckland. Tell us what you\u2019ve made.\u201d\n\nMaia swallowed, her throat suddenly dry. \u201cThis is the Auckland skyline at dawn,\u201d she began, her voice barely a whisper. She cleared her throat and tried again, forcing strength into her words. \u201cIt\u2019s a city I know in my bones, but one that\u2019s never quite felt like mine. I wanted to build my own version of it, a place of possibility. The towers are lemon and elderflower sponge, filled with cr\u00e8me p\u00e2tissi\u00e8re and an Italian meringue buttercream. They\u2019re encased in tempered dark chocolate and a white chocolate mirror glaze. And the Sky Tower is pulled isomalt.\u201d She didn't mention the car, the motorway, the melting ingredients. She wanted the bake to stand on its own, not as an excuse.\n\nPaul leaned in, his piercing gaze scrutinising every detail. He ran a finger over the base of one tower, then inspected his fingertip. It was clean. The glaze had set perfectly. He peered at the delicate sugar tower, its spire so fine it was almost invisible. \u201cYou had a catastrophic start to your day,\u201d he stated, looking up to meet her eyes. \u201cAnd you chose to attempt not one, but three of the most difficult techniques in patisserie. Re-tempering chocolate under pressure, a mirror glaze, and pulled sugar work. Were you trying to fail?\u201d\n\n\u201cI was trying to win,\u201d she replied, the answer surprising even herself with its boldness.\n\nA flicker of something\u2014respect, perhaps\u2014crossed his face. He picked up a long, sharp knife. The studio was so quiet she could hear the faint hum of the lighting rigs. He positioned the knife over the tallest tower and, with one clean, decisive movement, sliced straight down. There was a sharp crack as the knife broke through the tempered chocolate collar, followed by the soft sigh of it gliding through sponge and cream. He pulled the slice away, revealing a perfect cross-section. The layers were even, the filling was contained, the dark chocolate and white glaze forming a perfect, clean frame. She had done it.\n\nHe placed the slice on a plate and pushed it towards Sue before taking one for himself. Sue took the first bite, her eyes closing in concentration. A slow smile spread across her face. \u201cOh, Maia,\u201d she said softly. \u201cThat\u2019s beautiful. The elderflower is so fragrant, and the lemon cuts through the richness of the buttercream perfectly. It tastes like spring. And your cr\u00e8me p\u00e2tissi\u00e8re\u2026 it\u2019s like silk. Absolutely flawless.\u201d\n\nNow it was Paul\u2019s turn. He tapped the chocolate collar with his fork, which broke with another satisfying snap. He took a forkful that included every element\u2014glaze, chocolate, sponge, and filling. He chewed slowly, his expression a mask of intense concentration. He swallowed. The silence stretched, becoming thin and unbearable. Maia felt as though her entire life was suspended in that single moment of judgement.\n\n\u201cThe sponge,\u201d he said finally, his voice measured, \u201cis incredibly light. The syrup is well-judged. The chocolate has the snap. The glaze is perfect. The fillings are balanced.\u201d He laid his fork down. \u201cYou were forty-five minutes behind, with compromised ingredients. What you have produced here is not just technically brilliant\u2026 it is, frankly, impossible.\u201d He looked directly at her, and for the first time, his blue eyes were not judging her, but simply seeing her. \u201cYou didn\u2019t just build a skyline, Maia. You fought a battle on this bench today. And you won.\u201d\n\nA choked sob escaped Maia\u2019s lips. She pressed her hands to her mouth, the tears she had held back all day finally spilling over, hot and cleansing. Through the blur, she saw Liam in the small, cordoned-off audience section. He was on his feet, his face split in a wide, triumphant grin, shouting something she couldn't hear. The exhaustion, the fear, the desperate hope\u2014it all poured out of her. Whatever happened next, whatever the final result, Paul\u2019s words were enough. She had faced down the chaos and created something beautiful. She had built her home."

The three of them, Maia, June, and David, were gently ushered away from their benches and into a small, quiet green room off the main studio. The adrenaline had completely abandoned them, leaving behind a profound, bone-deep weariness. June sank onto a soft sofa and let out a long, shuddering sigh. David, for the first time all day, leaned against a wall, his perfect posture finally breaking. Maia just stood in the middle of the room, feeling strangely disconnected from her own body, as if she were watching herself from a great distance. The silence wasn\u2019t awkward; it was a shared space of immense, unspoken respect. They had been competitors, but now, on the other side of the battle, they were simply three people who had survived the same beautiful, terrifying ordeal.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d June said finally, her voice raspy with emotion. \u201cI need a very large gin. And a very long nap.\u201d She smiled at Maia, her eyes shining with unshed tears. \u201cYour bake, my dear. It was just\u2026 breathtaking. When Paul\u2019s voice cracked, I think my heart stopped.\u201d\n\nDavid pushed himself off the wall and walked over to Maia. He looked her directly in the eye, his usually stern face softened by exhaustion and something that looked like genuine admiration. \u201cHe was right. It was impossible. I was watching you. I wouldn\u2019t have thought it could be done.\u201d He extended a hand. \u201cCongratulations on a phenomenal bake, Maia. You earned every word of that praise.\u201d Maia took his hand, surprised by the warmth and strength of his grip. In that moment, the result didn\u2019t seem to matter as much. To have earned the respect of this brilliant, exacting man felt like a victory in itself.\n\nTheir quiet truce was broken by the return of Sarah, the production assistant, her headset firmly in place. \u201cIt\u2019s time,\u201d she said, her voice softer than it had been all day. \u201cThey\u2019re ready for you.\u201d The three of them shared a final, weighted look before following her back into the glare of the studio lights. The crew, the judges, and the hosts were all assembled in the center of the room, arranged in a semi-circle. The three winning showstoppers were displayed on a table in front of them, looking like edible museum pieces. Maia, June, and David were guided to stand in a line, facing the judges, their hands clasped in front of them in a subconscious echo of each other. The air was thick with anticipation. Maia focused on a scuff mark on the floor, her heart thumping a slow, heavy rhythm that she could feel in her throat.\n\nSue stepped forward, her smile warm and encompassing all three of them. \u201cBefore we announce the winner,\u201d she began, her voice full of emotion, \u201cwe just want to say what an extraordinary final this has been. June, your bake was a masterpiece of joy and artistry, a testament to a lifetime of skill and love. David, your creation was a work of architectural genius, a tribute filled with precision and power.\u201d Her gaze landed on Maia, and her smile deepened. \u201cAnd Maia, yours was a story of pure, unadulterated grit. You showed us that sometimes the most beautiful things are born from the most chaotic of circumstances.\u201d\n\nPaul took a step forward, his hands clasped behind his back. He looked at each of them in turn, his gaze intense. \u201cThe standard this year has been the highest we have ever seen. Any one of you would be a worthy winner. But a decision had to be made.\u201d He paused, and in that split second of silence, Maia\u2019s entire life seemed to flash before her eyes: the grey walls of St. Cuthbert\u2019s, the scent of flour in Mrs Gable\u2019s warm kitchen, the rattling engine of The Biscuit, the gleam of her finished skyline under the lights. \u201cWe judged on technical skill, on artistry, and on flavour. But today, we also judged on something more. We judged on heart.\u201d He took a deep breath. \u201cThe winner of the Great Kiwi Bake Off\u2026 is Maia.\u201d\n\nThe name didn\u2019t compute. It was just a sound, a word she knew belonged to her but which felt utterly foreign in this context. It hung in the air, shimmering and unreal, just like the words on the finalist letter. She saw Liam leap to his feet. She saw the judges smiling. She felt June\u2019s arms wrap around her in a fierce, loving hug. She heard the thunderous applause and the sudden, explosive pop of confetti cannons, which sent a shower of shimmering silver paper raining down around them. But it was all happening on the other side of a thick pane of glass. It wasn't until David shook her hand again, a wide, genuine smile on his face, that the first crack appeared in the glass. And when Liam barrelled through the crew and wrapped her in a hug that lifted her clean off the floor, the glass shattered completely.\n\n\u201cYOU DID IT, HART! YOU ACTUALLY, BLOODY DID IT!\u201d he yelled into her ear, his voice hoarse with emotion. He smelled of oil and victory. She buried her face in his shoulder, her body shaking with silent, heaving sobs of pure, unadulterated joy. He was her family, her foundation, and he was here to see her win. This was real. It was all real. When he finally set her down, Sue was standing there with a large, heavy glass trophy shaped like a stylized whisk. Her name was engraved on its base. A moment later, Paul was beside her, holding a comically oversized cheque. The numbers seemed to dance before her eyes: One Hundred Thousand Dollars.\n\nHer hands were shaking so badly she could barely hold the trophy. She stared at the cheque, at the clean, printed letters of her own name, Maia Hart. It wasn\u2019t just money. It was a key. It was the sea-green door of a little caf\u00e9 in Devonport. It was the scent of coffee and cardamom buns. It was a foundation, solid and real, that she had built for herself with sugar, butter, and a will of pure iron. She looked up and caught her reflection in the glass of the trophy. A tear-streaked, confetti-dusted, utterly exhausted girl stared back at her. A girl who was no longer a ghost in her own city. She was a baker. She was a winner. She thought of Mrs Gable, and a fresh wave of tears welled. *Thank you*, she whispered to the quiet memory of the woman who had first put a spoon in her hand. *This was for you.*\n\nMuch later, when the lights had been dimmed and the confetti swept away, the vast studio was quiet and cavernous. Most of the crew had gone home, leaving only a skeleton staff to finish packing up. Maia, changed out of her flour-dusted clothes and back into her jeans, stood before the wreckage of her showstopper. Someone had cut away more slices for the crew to share, leaving her skyline looking like a city after an earthquake. Liam appeared at her side, carrying a cardboard box with her mixing bowls and lucky apron inside. \u201cReady to go, champ?\u201d he asked softly. He gestured with his chin towards the cake. \u201cSome day you\u2019ve had.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have no idea,\u201d she breathed, a tired, happy laugh bubbling up inside her. She looked at the half-demolished towers, the broken shard of the Sky Tower lying on its side. It wasn\u2019t a disaster anymore. It was a monument. It was the day she had faced down the chaos and won. Liam slung a companionable arm around her shoulders. \u201cCome on. I\u2019ll give you a lift. The ute might smell of desperation, but she runs.\u201d Maia leaned her head against his shoulder, the oversized cheque tucked safely under her arm. As they walked out of the studio and into the cool, dark night, she thought of The Biscuit, sitting alone in an impound lot somewhere. She would get her back tomorrow. Maybe she\u2019d even pay to have the engine properly fixed. For the first time in her life, the road ahead didn\u2019t feel like a dangerous, unpredictable motorway. It was a quiet street, leading down to the sea. It was a straight shot, a direct line from here to the start of the rest of her life. And this time, nothing could possibly go wrong."

                                        "text": "## Chapter 5\n\nThe first thing Maia was aware of was the light. It wasn\u2019t the usual thin, grey light that filtered through the single window of her shoebox flat, but a soft, golden haze, diffused by the dusty leaves of a large p\u014dhutukawa tree outside. She was lying on a sofa that smelled faintly of Liam\u2019s dog, Buster, and was cocooned in an old, scratchy wool blanket. For a moment, she was disoriented, the events of the previous day a jumbled, fantastical dream. Then her eyes landed on the coffee table. The heavy glass trophy sat there, its polished surface catching the morning light and fracturing it into a dozen tiny rainbows on the ceiling. Beside it, propped up against a stack of car magazines, was the oversized cheque. Maia Hart. One Hundred Thousand Dollars. It was real. A low, breathless laugh escaped her, a sound of pure wonder in the quiet of the small living room.\n\nShe had no memory of getting here. She vaguely recalled Liam steering her through a throng of well-wishers, the weight of the trophy in her arms, the crinkle of the cheque, and then the familiar rattle of his ute. He must have taken one look at her shell-shocked face and decided her tiny, lonely flat was no place for her to be. He\u2019d guided her inside his small house in Avondale, sat her on the sofa, and put a mug of sweet tea in her hands before she\u2019d promptly fallen asleep, the TV still murmuring in the background. Now, in the quiet of the morning, the enormity of it all began to sink in, not as a tidal wave of emotion, but as a slow, steady tide rising within her. The frantic energy was gone, replaced by a deep, resonant calm. It felt like the moment after you pull a perfect cake from the oven, when the kitchen is warm and fragrant and filled with a sense of quiet accomplishment.\n\nThe sound of clattering in the kitchen was followed by the rich, comforting scent of coffee. Liam appeared in the doorway, a mug in each hand. He was still in yesterday\u2019s grease-stained overalls, his hair sticking up at odd angles. He looked as exhausted and happy as she felt. He gave her a slow, sleepy smile. \u201cMorning, champ. Thought you might be needing this.\u201d He handed her a mug. It was hot and strong, exactly how she liked it. He sat down in the battered armchair opposite her, his gaze lingering on the trophy. \u201cStill doesn\u2019t feel real, does it?\u201d\n\nMaia shook her head, clutching the warm mug in both hands. \u201cNo. I keep expecting to wake up on the side of the motorway.\u201d They sat in a comfortable silence for a few minutes, just sipping their coffee, the shared quiet more intimate than any conversation. Liam finally broke it, his voice practical. \u201cSo. First things first. We gotta go bail The Biscuit out of jail. She\u2019s at the impound yard in Henderson. Then, I reckon, a proper celebration. My treat. Fish and chips on the beach?\u201d\n\nThe mundanity of it was perfect. After the glamour and the pressure and the confetti, the thought of retrieving her sad, broken-down car felt grounding. It was a link between the extraordinary day she\u2019d just had and the ordinary life she was about to build. \u201cOkay,\u201d she agreed, a real smile spreading across her face. \u201cBut I\u2019m paying for the fish and chips. I think I can afford it.\u201d The words felt strange and wonderful on her tongue.\n\nThe impound yard was as grim as its name suggested. A vast, soulless expanse of asphalt enclosed by a high chain-link fence, it was a graveyard for cars that had met unfortunate ends. The air smelled of hot tarmac and defeat. After navigating a bureaucratic maze of paperwork and paying a fee that made her wince, a forklift trundled out and deposited The Biscuit in a designated pick-up zone. Her little sea-mist green car looked even smaller and more pathetic than Maia remembered, covered in a fine layer of dust, a bright yellow impound sticker slapped on its windscreen. A pang of unexpected affection went through her. This car had been her first taste of freedom, her partner in crime. It had failed her at the worst possible moment, but it had also carried her towards the start of her new life.\n\nLiam popped the bonnet with the weary familiarity of a doctor examining a chronically ill patient. He poked and prodded for a few minutes, his expression grim. \u201cYep. Alternator\u2019s completely fried. Probably took the battery with it. She\u2019s not going anywhere under her own steam.\u201d He sighed, wiping his hands on a rag. \u201cI\u2019ll get her towed to the workshop. I can fix her up, but it\u2019ll take a few days.\u201d He looked at Maia. \u201cSo, plans have changed. I\u2019m your chauffeur for the day. Where to, Miss Hart? The world is your oyster.\u201d\n\nMaia looked from her broken-down car to Liam\u2019s solid, reassuring presence. She should have been frustrated, but she wasn't. It was just another problem to be solved, and for the first time, she had the resources to solve it without panic. She thought of the oversized cheque, now safely tucked into her bag. An idea, bold and exciting, began to form. \u201cYou know where I\u2019ve always wanted to go?\u201d she said, a new energy in her voice. \u201cDevonport.\u201d\n\nLiam raised a greasy eyebrow. \u201cThe fancy place with the old houses? What\u2019s in Devonport?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy future,\u201d she said, and the word didn\u2019t sound foolish or naive. It sounded like a plan. \u201cLet\u2019s just go for a drive. Let\u2019s go and see the sea.\u201d\n\nThe ferry ride from the city to Devonport was a short journey into another world. The bustling, modern metropolis of glass and steel gave way to a quaint, village-like suburb nestled on the North Shore. White-painted Victorian villas with intricate fretwork lined the streets, their gardens overflowing with roses and hydrangeas. The pace of life seemed slower here, more deliberate. As they walked along the main street, the air was salty and clean. Maia\u2019s gaze darted everywhere, taking in the small, independent bookshops, the art galleries, and the cafes with their tables spilling onto the pavement. It was exactly as she had pictured it. Better, even.\n\n\u201cI could live here,\u201d she breathed, stopping to look at a small bakery. Through the window, she could see a baker dusting a tray of croissants with icing sugar. She could almost smell the warm, yeasty air, feel the flour under her fingernails.\n\n\u201cYou could,\u201d Liam agreed, watching her face. \u201cYou could do anything you want.\u201d\n\nThey ambled down a side street that led towards the water, away from the main tourist hub. The shops here were quieter, a little older. And then she saw it. Tucked between a real estate agent and a shop selling nautical-themed homewares was a small, vacant storefront. It was sad and neglected, the paint on its window frames peeling, the glass dusty. A faded \u2018For Lease\u2019 sign was taped to the inside of the door, its edges curled with age. It wasn't grand or beautiful, but it had a wide front window perfect for displaying cakes, and a deep-set doorway that offered shelter from the rain. The door itself was a mess of flaking, pale blue paint. But Maia looked at it and saw something else entirely. She saw it painted a deep, welcoming sea-green. She saw her name, handwritten in gold leaf on the glass. She saw a warm light spilling out onto the pavement on a grey afternoon.\n\nShe walked right up to the glass and peered inside, her hands cupped around her face to block the glare. The interior was a dusty, empty shell, but she could see the shape of it. A long, narrow space, perfect for a counter along one side, with a few small tables along the other. There was even a small, separate room at the back that could be the kitchen. It was a blank canvas. It was a foundation. \u201cLiam,\u201d she said, her voice quiet with awe. \u201cLook.\u201d\n\nHe came to stand beside her, peering in. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a wreck, Hart. Needs a lot of work.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s perfect,\u201d she whispered, a grin spreading across her face. It wasn\u2019t the end of a journey. It wasn\u2019t a finish line. It was a starting block. The competition, the prize money, the trophy\u2014they had all just been ingredients. This was the bake. The rest of her life. She pulled her phone from her pocket and, with a hand that was perfectly steady, she took a photo of the phone number on the \u2018For Lease\u2019 sign."

Beside it, propped up against a stack of car magazines, was the oversized cheque. Maia Hart. One Hundred Thousand Dollars. It was real. A low, breathless laugh escaped her, a sound of pure wonder in the quiet of the small living room.\n\nShe had no memory of getting here. She vaguely recalled Liam steering her through a throng of well-wishers, the weight of the trophy in her arms, the crinkle of the cheque, and then the familiar rattle of his ute. He must have taken one look at her shell-shocked face and decided her tiny, lonely flat was no place for her to be. He\u2019d guided her inside his small house in Avondale, sat her on the sofa, and put a mug of sweet tea in her hands before she\u2019d promptly fallen asleep, the TV still murmuring in the background. Now, in the quiet of the morning, the enormity of it all began to sink in, not as a tidal wave of emotion, but as a slow, steady tide rising within her. The frantic energy was gone, replaced by a deep, resonant calm. It felt like the moment after you pull a perfect cake from the oven, when the kitchen is warm and fragrant and filled with a sense of quiet accomplishment.\n\nThe sound of clattering in the kitchen was followed by the rich, comforting scent of coffee. Liam appeared in the doorway, a mug in each hand. He was still in yesterday\u2019s grease-stained overalls, his hair sticking up at odd angles. He looked as exhausted and happy as she felt. He gave her a slow, sleepy smile. \u201cMorning, champ. Thought you might be needing this.\u201d He handed her a mug. It was hot and strong, exactly how she liked it. He sat down in the battered armchair opposite her, his gaze lingering on the trophy. \u201cStill doesn\u2019t feel real, does it?\u201d\n\nMaia shook her head, clutching the warm mug in both hands. \u201cNo. I keep expecting to wake up on the side of the motorway.\u201d They sat in a comfortable silence for a few minutes, just sipping their coffee, the shared quiet more intimate than any conversation. Liam finally broke it, his voice practical. \u201cSo. First things first. We gotta go bail The Biscuit out of jail. She\u2019s at the impound yard in Henderson. Then, I reckon, a proper celebration. My treat. Fish and chips on the beach?\u201d\n\nThe mundanity of it was perfect. After the glamour and the pressure and the confetti, the thought of retrieving her sad, broken-down car felt grounding. It was a link between the extraordinary day she\u2019d just had and the ordinary life she was about to build. \u201cOkay,\u201d she agreed, a real smile spreading across her face. \u201cBut I\u2019m paying for the fish and chips. I think I can afford it.\u201d The words felt strange and wonderful on her tongue.\n\nThe impound yard was as grim as its name suggested. A vast, soulless expanse of asphalt enclosed by a high chain-link fence, it was a graveyard for cars that had met unfortunate ends. The air smelled of hot tarmac and defeat. After navigating a bureaucratic maze of paperwork and paying a fee that made her wince, a forklift trundled out and deposited The Biscuit in a designated pick-up zone. Her little sea-mist green car looked even smaller and more pathetic than Maia remembered, covered in a fine layer of dust, a bright yellow impound sticker slapped on its windscreen. A pang of unexpected affection went through her. This car had been her first taste of freedom, her partner in crime. It had failed her at the worst possible moment, but it had also carried her towards the start of her new life.\n\nLiam popped the bonnet with the weary familiarity of a doctor examining a chronically ill patient. He poked and prodded for a few minutes, his expression grim. \u201cYep. Alternator\u2019s completely fried. Probably took the battery with it. She\u2019s not going anywhere under her own steam.\u201d He sighed, wiping his hands on a rag. \u201cI\u2019ll get her towed to the workshop. I can fix her up, but it\u2019ll take a few days.\u201d He looked at Maia. \u201cSo, plans have changed. I\u2019m your chauffeur for the day. Where to, Miss Hart? The world is your oyster.\u201d\n\nMaia looked from her broken-down car to Liam\u2019s solid, reassuring presence. She should have been frustrated, but she wasn't. It was just another problem to be solved, and for the first time, she had the resources to solve it without panic. She thought of the oversized cheque, now safely tucked into her bag. An idea, bold and exciting, began to form. \u201cYou know where I\u2019ve always wanted to go?\u201d she said, a new energy in her voice. \u201cDevonport.\u201d\n\nLiam raised a greasy eyebrow. \u201cThe fancy place with the old houses? What\u2019s in Devonport?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy future,\u201d she said, and the word didn\u2019t sound foolish or naive. It sounded like a plan. \u201cLet\u2019s just go for a drive. Let\u2019s go and see the sea.\u201d\n\nThe ferry ride from the city to Devonport was a short journey into another world. The bustling, modern metropolis of glass and steel gave way to a quaint, village-like suburb nestled on the North Shore. White-painted Victorian villas with intricate fretwork lined the streets, their gardens overflowing with roses and hydrangeas. The pace of life seemed slower here, more deliberate. As they walked along the main street, the air was salty and clean. Maia\u2019s gaze darted everywhere, taking in the small, independent bookshops, the art galleries, and the cafes with their tables spilling onto the pavement. It was exactly as she had pictured it. Better, even.\n\n\u201cI could live here,\u201d she breathed, stopping to look at a small bakery. Through the window, she could see a baker dusting a tray of croissants with icing sugar. She could almost smell the warm, yeasty air, feel the flour under her fingernails.\n\n\u201cYou could,\u201d Liam agreed, watching her face. \u201cYou could do anything you want.\u201d\n\nThey ambled down a side street that led towards the water, away from the main tourist hub. The shops here were quieter, a little older. And then she saw it. Tucked between a real estate agent and a shop selling nautical-themed homewares was a small, vacant storefront. It was sad and neglected, the paint on its window frames peeling, the glass dusty. A faded \u2018For Lease\u2019 sign was taped to the inside of the door, its edges curled with age. It wasn't grand or beautiful, but it had a wide front window perfect for displaying cakes, and a deep-set doorway that offered shelter from the rain. The door itself was a mess of flaking, pale blue paint. But Maia looked at it and saw something else entirely. She saw it painted a deep, welcoming sea-green. She saw her name, handwritten in gold leaf on the glass. She saw a warm light spilling out onto the pavement on a grey afternoon.\n\nShe walked right up to the glass and peered inside, her hands cupped around her face to block the glare. The interior was a dusty, empty shell, but she could see the shape of it. A long, narrow space, perfect for a counter along one side, with a few small tables along the other. There was even a small, separate room at the back that could be the kitchen. It was a blank canvas. It was a foundation. \u201cLiam,\u201d she said, her voice quiet with awe. \u201cLook.\u201d\n\nHe came to stand beside her, peering in. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a wreck, Hart. Needs a lot of work.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s perfect,\u201d she whispered, a grin spreading across her face. It wasn\u2019t the end of a journey. It wasn\u2019t a finish line. It was a starting block. The competition, the prize money, the trophy\u2014they had all just been ingredients. This was the bake. The rest of her life. She pulled her phone from her pocket and, with a hand that was perfectly steady, she took a photo of the phone number on the \u2018For Lease\u2019 sign."

He could see the cogs turning in her head, the same focused, intense look she got when she was mapping out the complex architecture of a multi-layered cake. He recognised the shift from dreamer to doer. \"You're going to call it, aren't you?\" he said, not as a question, but as a statement of fact. \"Right now.\"\n\n\"There's no point waiting,\" Maia replied, her thumb already hovering over the call button. The chaos of the past twenty-four hours had burned away a layer of lifelong hesitation she hadn't even realised was there. She had won. She had the money. The only thing standing between her and this dusty, neglected shop was a phone call, and after facing down Paul's terrifyingly silent judgement, a real estate agent held no fear for her. She pressed the button and held the phone to her ear, her heart giving a little skip as it began to ring.\n\nA gruff, world-weary voice answered on the third ring. \"Henderson.\"\n\n\"Hello,\" Maia began, forcing a confidence she didn't entirely feel into her voice. \"My name is Maia Hart. I'm calling about the commercial property for lease on King Edward Parade in Devonport.\"\n\nThere was a huff on the other end of the line. \"The old dairy? Been empty for the better part of a year. You sure you're calling about the right place, love? It's a bit of a fixer-upper.\"\n\n\"I'm standing outside it right now,\" she said steadily. \"I'm very interested. I was wondering if it would be possible to see the inside today?\"\n\nThere was a pause, and Maia could hear the rustle of papers. \"Today? Keen, aren't you? Look, I'm on the Shore already. Got a valuation in Takapuna in an hour. I can swing by in about twenty minutes if you're serious.\"\n\n\"Twenty minutes is perfect,\" Maia said, a thrill running through her. \"We'll be here.\" She hung up, a wide, incredulous grin spreading across her face. \"He's coming. In twenty minutes.\"\n\nLiam whistled, low and long. \"Things are moving fast, Hart. You sure about this? We haven't even had our celebratory fish and chips.\" But his eyes were crinkling with pride, and he nudged her shoulder with his. \"Okay. Let's do a pre-game analysis. What are we looking for?\"\n\n\"You're looking for dodgy wiring, rising damp, and structural impossibilities,\" Maia retorted, her smile not faltering. \"I'm looking for the ghost of a floor plan and enough space for a double-stack convection oven.\"\n\nExactly nineteen minutes later, a sensible silver sedan pulled up and a man who looked exactly like his voice sounded got out. Mr. Henderson was in his late sixties, with a crumpled suit, a kind but tired face, and a handshake like a vice. He grunted a hello and fumbled with a large ring of keys, eventually finding the one that fit the grimy lock. The door opened with a groan of protest, releasing a wave of stale, dusty air. He flicked a switch by the door, and a single, bare bulb flickered to life, illuminating the cavernous space. It was worse than she'd imagined. The linoleum on the floor was cracked and peeling, revealing dark, stained concrete beneath. The walls were a patchwork of dirty cream paint and shadowy outlines where shelves and coolers had once stood. A long, dilapidated counter ran down one side, its formica top chipped and stained.\n\nLiam immediately went into mechanic mode, his gaze sweeping the ceiling. \"Water damage in that corner,\" he announced, pointing. \"And these outlets look pre-historic. You'd need to completely rewire the place to run commercial appliances. And the plumbing for the sinks and a coffee machine...\" He trailed off, shaking his head.\n\nBut Maia was barely listening. She stepped past him, her footsteps echoing in the empty room. She walked to the back, where a doorway led into another, smaller room. It was dark and smelled of mouse droppings, but it was a decent size. She could see it all. This would be the kitchen, her engine room. A long stainless-steel bench here for prep, the ovens against that wall, the sinks over there. Out in the main space, she would rip out the lino and polish the concrete floor. The ugly counter would go, replaced with a warm, solid timber one. The walls would be painted a clean, gallery white to make the space feel bigger. Little round tables for two would line the wall opposite the counter. She walked to the large front window, dusty as it was, and looked out at the street. She could see people walking by, the ferry gliding into the wharf, the green cone of North Head in the distance. The light was beautiful, even on this overcast day. It was perfect.\n\n\"It's a lot of work,\" Mr. Henderson said from the doorway, watching her with a shrewd expression. \"Last two tenants, a vape shop and a souvenir store, didn't even last six months. It's a tough spot.\"\n\nMaia turned to face him, her eyes shining with a conviction that took both him and Liam by surprise. \"They were selling the wrong thing,\" she said simply. \"This street doesn't need another souvenir shop. It needs a place that smells like coffee and fresh bread. It needs a place for people to come and sit on a rainy day with a cup of tea and a piece of cake that makes them feel better. I can make that place.\" She took a deep breath. \"I know it needs work. I won the Great Kiwi Bake Off yesterday. The prize money is my start-up capital. I'm not afraid of hard work, and I have the funds for the bond, the first few months' rent, and the renovations. I want it.\"\n\nMr. Henderson's bushy eyebrows shot up. \"The Bake Off? With the scary judge? My wife, Shirley, she was glued to it. She'd kill me if she knew I was here.\" A slow smile spread across his face, transforming his gruff features. \"The girl with the car trouble? The one who made the skyline? That was you?\" Maia nodded, her cheeks flushing. He let out a bark of a laugh. \"Well, I'll be. Shirley said you had guts.\" He looked around the dusty shop again, but this time he seemed to be seeing it through her eyes. \"You know what? This old place needs someone with guts.\" He named a monthly figure for the rent that was surprisingly, almost shockingly, reasonable. \"And look, you sign a two-year lease, and I'll give you the first two months rent-free. For renovations. Can't have Shirley's favourite baker serving cakes out of a hovel, can I?\"\n\nMaia stared at him, speechless. The simple, unexpected kindness of it almost made her want to cry again. She looked at Liam, who was grinning so wide it looked like his face might split. \"I'll take it,\" she said, her voice thick with emotion. \"Thank you, Mr. Henderson. Thank you.\"\n\nAn hour later, they were sitting on a bench on the Devonport waterfront, a warm, greasy parcel of fish and chips open between them. In Maia's bag was a freshly signed lease agreement, and in her hand was a single, solitary key. The key to her future. It felt impossibly heavy. She looked across the sparkling water at the city skyline she had so painstakingly recreated in sugar and hope. From here, it looked different. Smaller. More distant. Her world was no longer over there. It was right here, in this quiet village, in the promise of a dusty, empty shop and the key that was growing warm in her palm.\n\n\"So,\" Liam said, nudging her with his elbow as he stole one of her chips. \"You've got the prize, you've got the shop, you've got the world's best mechanic on speed dial for when you inevitably block the drains with buttercream.\" He grinned. \"What are you going to call it?\"\n\nMaia looked at the key, then back at the water. She thought of Mrs Gable's faded recipe book, held together with yellowing tape. She thought of the warmth of her kitchen, the first place she had ever felt safe, the first place that had ever felt like a home. A name came to her, simple and true, a quiet tribute and a public promise. \"The Gable,\" she said softly. \"I'm going to call it The Gable.\""

He looked at her, then out at the water, then back at her face, which was illuminated by a quiet, steady certainty. \"The Gable,\" he repeated softly, the name settling between them. \"Of course.\" It wasn't a question or a statement of surprise, but an acknowledgement of something that, once spoken, felt like it had always been true. It was more than a tribute; it was an anchor, securing her terrifyingly new future to the one part of her past that had been safe and warm. It gave her dream a history, a soul. He put the chip down and nudged her gently with his shoulder, a silent gesture of profound understanding that said more than a hundred words of encouragement ever could. In that moment, sitting on a public bench with a parcel of greasy paper between them, they felt less like two orphans who had found each other and more like a family laying the first stone of a home.\n\nThey finished their food in a comfortable silence, the gulls crying overhead, the salty air crisp and clean. But the quiet pull of the shop was irresistible. It was one thing to hold the key; it was another to use it. They walked back down the quiet side street, their footsteps echoing slightly. Standing before the flaking blue door, Maia\u2019s hand trembled as she slid the cool metal key into the lock. It was stiff from disuse, and for a heart-stopping second, she thought it wouldn't turn. Then, with a firm twist from Liam\u2019s hand over hers, there was a loud, satisfying clunk as the old lock gave way. She pushed the door open and stepped inside, not as a hopeful spectator, but as the proprietor. The air was thick with the scent of dust and damp and decay, but to Maia, it smelled like potential. It smelled like hers.\n\nThe initial awe quickly gave way to the daunting reality of the task ahead. The single bare bulb did little to flatter the peeling walls and the grimy floor. The space, which had seemed full of promise from the outside, now felt overwhelmingly dilapidated. Liam, ever the pragmatist, had already retrieved a notepad and a stubby pencil from the glovebox of his ute. He walked the perimeter of the room, making notes, his brow furrowed in concentration. \u201cOkay,\u201d he said, tapping the pencil against his teeth. \u201cThe wiring is a total write-off, you\u2019ll need a commercial electrician. Same for the plumbing; we\u2019ll need to run new lines for a three-compartment sink and a coffee machine hook-up. That back wall is load-bearing, so we can\u2019t knock it through to the kitchen, but we can widen the doorway. And this floor\u2026\u201d He scuffed at the curling linoleum with his boot. \u201cIt\u2019ll take a grinder and a whole lot of elbow grease to get this back to polished concrete.\u201d\n\nAs he spoke, Maia felt a cold knot of panic begin to form in her stomach. The list grew longer with every observation. Electrician, plumber, grinder, permits, licenses, equipment. The hundred thousand dollars, which had felt like an impossible fortune just hours ago, began to shrink with terrifying speed. She pictured the gleaming, stainless-steel convection ovens she\u2019d coveted in magazines, the beautiful espresso machine, the planetary mixer. Each item was a monumental expense. This wasn't like baking a cake, where the steps were clear and the outcome, if you were careful, was guaranteed. This was a vast, sprawling project with a thousand ways to fail. The old, familiar fear, the one that whispered she wasn\u2019t good enough, that the world would always pull the rug out from under her, began to creep back in.\n\nLiam must have seen the colour drain from her face. He stopped his relentless cataloguing of problems and put a hand on her shoulder. \u201cHey,\u201d he said gently. \u201cOne thing at a time, Hart. Remember? Today, we don't worry about the plumbing or the wiring. Today, we make a start. Today, we just make some noise.\u201d He grinned, a flash of white in his grease-smudged face. \u201cLet's go smash something.\u201d He disappeared out to his ute and returned a moment later with a crowbar and a pair of heavy-duty work gloves, tossing the gloves to her. The simple, physical task was an antidote to her spiralling anxiety. Together, they attacked the long, ugly counter. It was a battle. The formica splintered, old nails screeched in protest as Liam wrenched them from the wood, and decades of accumulated dust rained down on them. It was filthy, exhausting, back-breaking work, and it was the most fun Maia had had in years. With a final, groan of splintering timber, the last section of the counter crashed to the floor. They stood back, panting and covered in grime, in a space that was suddenly twice as big and full of light. They hadn't just cleared a counter; they had demolished the past, making way for the future.\n\nThe noise had not gone unnoticed. An elderly woman with a cloud of perfectly coiffed white hair and bright, inquisitive eyes poked her head around the door. \u201cGoodness me, what\u2019s all the commotion? I thought this old place was going to crumble into the sea.\u201d Her gaze fell on Maia, and her eyes widened in recognition. \u201cWait a minute. You\u2019re\u2026 you\u2019re the cake girl! From the television! Shirley! It\u2019s me, Shirley Henderson. My husband, Bill, he leased you the shop! Oh, he\u2019ll be so thrilled I met you. I told him you had spunk!\u201d She bustled in, holding a tartan-patterned flask. \u201cI was just on my way to my garden club, but I saw the lights on and heard the racket. I brought you both a cup of tea. You look like you could use it.\u201d She poured two cups of steaming, milky tea into plastic cups she produced from a cavernous handbag, chattering away about Maia\u2019s rose and pistachio Battenberg. It was the first time a stranger had spoken to her not with pity or professional detachment, but with genuine warmth and excitement. She was no longer Maia Hart, the orphan from nowhere; she was Shirley\u2019s favourite baker, a new, welcome part of the fabric of this village.\n\nAs evening fell, painting the sky outside in shades of orange and purple, Liam packed his tools away. The shop was transformed. A huge pile of splintered wood and debris sat in one corner, ready to be hauled away, but the rest of the space was open and clear. It was no longer a sad, abandoned dairy; it was a building site, humming with the promise of what was to come. \u201cNot a bad day\u2019s work,\u201d Liam said, surveying their handiwork with satisfaction. \u201cI\u2019ll get a skip bin delivered tomorrow. You sure you\u2019re okay to get home? I can give you a lift.\u201d Maia shook her head. Her own flat above the laundromat felt a million miles away. \u201cI think I\u2019m going to stay for a bit,\u201d she said. \u201cJust\u2026 to think.\u201d He understood. With a final, tired grin, he left, promising to be back in the morning.\n\nMaia was alone. She walked to the center of the empty room, the single key now feeling warm and familiar in her pocket. The setting sun streamed through the filthy front window, casting long, golden shafts of light through the dancing dust motes. She ran her hand along a section of the wall where the old counter had been, feeling the rough texture of the exposed brick beneath the peeling paint. She thought of Mrs Gable's kitchen, a place of warmth and science and safety. This was different. This was bigger and scarier and entirely her own. She was tired, she ached in muscles she didn't know she had, and she was covered in a century of dust. But as she stood there, in the quiet heart of her chaotic, beautiful, perfect mess, she felt a profound sense of peace settle over her. She was home."

                                        "text": "## Chapter 7\n\nThe next morning, Maia returned to the shop before the sun had fully risen over North Head. She let herself in with her own key, the sound of the lock echoing in the pre-dawn stillness. In the grey light, the destruction of the previous day looked less like a triumph and more like a terrible mistake. The mountain of splintered wood and broken formica seemed larger, the dust thicker, the emptiness of the space more profound. The initial thrill of demolition had worn off, leaving a sober reality in its place. This wasn't just a symbolic act; it was a real mess, and she was the one who had to clean it up. For a moment, she felt a pang of nostalgia for the simplicity of her old life, for mornings that began with the familiar science of sourdough starter rather than the overwhelming chaos of a building site.\n\nBut she was a baker, and a baker\u2019s trade was turning chaos into order. Pushing down the flicker of apprehension, she found a relatively clean patch of floor, sat down cross-legged, and pulled a fresh, crisp notebook and a pen from her bag. This was a language she understood. She opened to the first page and wrote *The Gable* at the top in neat, careful letters. Beneath it, she began to break the monumental task down into manageable steps, just as she would deconstruct a complex recipe. The page divided into columns: 'Must-Haves', 'Nice-to-Haves', 'Liam Jobs', and 'Pro Jobs'. Under 'Must-Haves', she wrote *Double-stack convection oven, 20qt planetary mixer, commercial coffee machine, sinks, refrigeration*. Each item was a small word representing a mountain of research and a terrifyingly large sum of money. The 'Pro Jobs' list was even more daunting: *Full electrical re-wire, commercial plumbing installation, ventilation/extraction system*. She was building a home one gingerbread brick at a time, but it turned out the bricks were made of gold and held together with council permits.\n\nOn the next page, she wrote the number '$100,000' at the top. It looked magnificent for a single, glorious second. Then, with a grim sense of purpose, she began the subtractions. She deducted the bond and the first month's rent she would owe once the free period was over. She pencilled in a rough, terrifying estimate for the electrical and plumbing work based on a frantic internet search the night before. She added another large sum for the extraction system, a legal necessity she hadn't even considered. Suddenly, her fortune had been cut in half before she had even bought a single spatula. The remaining number looked shockingly small, unequal to the task of filling this empty shell with the gleaming, reliable equipment of her dreams. The old panic, cold and familiar, began to prickle at the edges of her resolve.\n\nHer anxious trance was broken by a loud, metallic bang from the street that made her jump. A moment later, Liam\u2019s lanky frame filled the doorway, silhouetted against the rising sun. He was holding two steaming takeaway coffees and grinning. \u201cThe cavalry, and a large yellow skip bin, have arrived,\u201d he announced, placing a cup beside her. Outside, a truck was depositing a huge, bright yellow bin right in front of the shop. Liam\u2019s cheerful, pragmatic energy was a physical force, pushing back against her rising tide of doubt. \u201cRight. Drink your coffee. Then we fill that bin. The sooner we get the old junk out, the sooner we can start bringing the good stuff in.\u201d\n\nThe work was brutal and profoundly satisfying. They hauled armfuls of splintered timber and jagged pieces of old counter out to the skip bin, their movements falling into an easy rhythm. The physical exertion was a balm to Maia's anxious mind. You couldn't worry about budgets when you were trying to manoeuvre a six-foot section of rotten wood through a narrow doorway. As they worked, the village of Devonport began to wake up around them. People on their morning walks would slow as they passed, their curiosity piqued by the activity in the long-dormant shop. Most just offered a nod or a curious smile, but one elderly man with a terrier on a leash stopped, leaning on the doorframe. \u201cFinally someone\u2019s doing something with old Mrs. Gable\u2019s place,\u201d he said, his eyes twinkling. Maia froze, a piece of wood in her hands. \"I'm sorry, what did you say?\" she asked. \"Mrs. Gable,\" the man repeated. \"Agnes Gable. She and her husband ran the dairy here for forty years. Best ice creams in Auckland. She passed away, oh, must be ten years ago now. The place has never been the same since.\" He tipped his hat. \"Glad to see it getting a new lease on life.\" He ambled off, leaving Maia standing in a cloud of dust, her heart pounding. It was a coincidence. A wild, impossible coincidence. Or perhaps, it was a sign.\n\nReeling from the revelation, Maia retreated to the relative quiet of the back room to make the phone call she had been dreading. The call to the restaurant supply company. A smooth, professional voice ran her through the features of the Italian convection oven she had coveted for years, the one with the superior steam-injection system and the rock-solid temperature consistency. It was the heart of her kitchen, the one piece of equipment she refused to compromise on. \u201cSo, for the double-stack model, fully installed,\u201d the salesman concluded cheerfully, \u201cyou\u2019re looking at thirty-two thousand, five hundred dollars, plus GST.\u201d The number landed like a physical blow, knocking the air from her lungs. It was more than a third of her entire remaining capital, for one single appliance. The dream, which had felt so close, suddenly seemed to be receding at an alarming rate. All the confidence, all the joy, drained out of her, replaced by the hollow feeling of being an imposter, a little girl playing dress-up in a world of serious, expensive business she didn't understand.\n\nLiam found her a few minutes later, sitting on an overturned bucket in the kitchen-to-be, staring blankly at the wall. The skip was full, and he was covered in a thick layer of grime, but his eyes were bright with accomplishment until he saw her face. He didn\u2019t need to ask what was wrong. He simply wiped his dusty hands on his overalls and retrieved the stub of chalk from his pocket. He walked into the main room, Maia trailing silently behind him. \u201cOkay,\u201d he said, his voice quiet but firm. \u201cForget the oven for a minute. Forget the money. Show me where the counter goes. Your counter.\u201d She hesitated, then walked to a spot near the front and pointed. \u201cHere,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI want it to run along this wall, so I can see the door while I\u2019m working.\u201d Liam knelt, and with a focused intensity, drew a long, straight, white line on the dusty concrete floor, from the front of the shop almost to the back. He stood up and brushed the chalk from his hands. \u201cThere,\u201d he said, looking not at her, but at the line. \u201cThat\u2019s the start. That\u2019s the first piece of The Gable.\u201d Maia stared at the chalk line. It was just a mark on a dirty floor, but it was also a boundary, a blueprint, a declaration. It was the first new thing in the old space, a clean, straight line of hope drawn right through the heart of the chaos."

Maia ran her finger along the floor next to it, the fine white powder clinging to her skin. It was simple, straight, and real. Unlike the terrifying, abstract numbers in her notebook, this was a mark she had made on her own space, a tangible piece of the future. The salesman's voice, quoting a price that was more than her first car had cost ten times over, had almost shattered her resolve. But the chalk line held her fast. It was the first step in the recipe. Follow the steps, and something beautiful would emerge. She had always believed that. She had to believe it now.\n\nShe took a deep breath, the air thick with the ghosts of dust and decay, and closed the notebook on the page of shrinking numbers. The dream of a brand-new, top-of-the-line kitchen was just that\u2014a dream. Her reality, like it had always been, was about making do, about being resourceful, about finding value where others saw none. She pulled out her phone, sat back down on the dusty floor, and opened a new browser window. Her search terms were no longer the names of gleaming Italian brands. They were \"restaurant equipment auction,\" \"commercial kitchen liquidation,\" and \"second-hand planetary mixer Auckland.\" The results were a world away from the glossy corporate websites. The new pages were cluttered and functional, with grainy photos of dented stainless-steel tables and mixers with paint chipped from their casings. It was the unglamorous, working-class underbelly of the hospitality industry, a place of failed dreams and closing-down sales. It felt, to Maia, strangely like coming home.\n\nLiam found her an hour later, hunched over her phone, scrolling intently. The skip bin outside was now overflowing, a testament to their morning\u2019s work. He had swept the main floor, and the absence of the worst of the debris made the space feel even larger and more full of potential. He looked at the frantic scribbles she was now making in her notebook\u2014a list of websites, auction dates, and model numbers. \"Change of plan?\" he asked, already knowing the answer. \"The shiny Italian oven costs more than a small planet,\" she said without looking up. \"So, we're going treasure hunting instead.\" Liam pulled over an overturned bucket and sat beside her, peering at the screen. His eyes, accustomed to spotting a cracked engine block or a worn-out bearing from twenty paces, scanned the listings with a professional's critique. \"That mixer's got a wobble in the housing, see how it's sitting uneven? Stay away. But this one\u2026 Kenwood, 30-quart, looks like it's been through a war, but the motor on those things is indestructible. If the price is right, that's a good workhorse.\"\n\nThey fell into a new rhythm, a partnership of baker and mechanic. She knew what the equipment needed to do; he knew how to tell if it was on its last legs. They were a team, their shared history of scarcity now their greatest asset. It was during a lull in their search that Maia finally voiced the thought that had been echoing in her mind since the man with the terrier had spoken to her. \u201cLiam,\u201d she began, her voice quiet. \u201cThat old man who stopped by this morning. He said this place used to be a dairy. He said it was run by a woman named Agnes Gable.\u201d Liam stopped scrolling and looked at her, his expression unreadable. \"Gable,\" he repeated slowly. \"Like\u2026 *our* Mrs. Gable?\" Maia nodded, a lump forming in her throat. \"It has to be a coincidence, right? It's not a super uncommon name. It can't be.\" But even as she said it, a powerful, electric feeling coursed through her, the dizzying sensation of disparate parts of her life suddenly clicking into place. St. Cuthbert\u2019s, the woman who had taught her how to bake, the city that had raised her, and this dusty, forgotten shop on a quiet street by the sea\u2014they were all connected. The name she had chosen as a simple tribute was, in fact, the shop\u2019s own history, waiting to be reclaimed. It wasn\u2019t a coincidence. It was a legacy.\n\nA new listing caught her eye, interrupting her reverie. An Italian restaurant in Manukau had gone into sudden liquidation. The entire contents of the kitchen were being sold in a single, unreserved auction in two days. The list was a treasure trove: stainless steel prep benches, speed racks, a twin-deck pizza oven, and, halfway down the page, a 'Convection Oven, Commercial, European Brand, Good Working Order'. The photo was dark and blurry, taken in a hurry, but she could just make out the shape of it. It wasn't the gleaming new model from her dreams, but it was big, solid, and had the right configuration of dials. \"Liam, look,\" she said, her voice sharp with excitement. \"This is it. This could be the whole kitchen, right here.\" They spent the next hour cross-referencing the model numbers they could decipher, scrutinising the grainy photos for any signs of terminal damage. It was a gamble. Auctions were notoriously unpredictable, and buying \"as is, where is\" was a huge risk. But if the prices were right, she could potentially outfit her entire kitchen for the price of that one new oven.\n\nThe decision was made. The next day was for viewing. They would drive out to Manukau, inspect every piece of equipment on their list, and prepare for battle. The rest of the afternoon was spent on less exciting, but equally vital tasks. With Liam\u2019s help, Maia took precise measurements of the space, mapping out the floor plan in her notebook. The chalk line for the counter was joined by squares for the oven, the mixer, the fridges, and the sinks. Slowly, painstakingly, the empty shell began to resemble a kitchen on paper. As the sun began to dip low in the sky, casting long shadows across the floor, Shirley Henderson appeared in the doorway, this time carrying a plate covered in a tea towel. \u201cI saw the light on,\u201d she announced. \u201cAnd I thought you two might be flagging.\u201d She whipped off the tea towel to reveal a plate of scones. They were slightly burnt on the bottom and lopsided, but they were made with care. \"My contribution to the cause,\" she beamed. \"Now, I remember Agnes used to have her big mixer right over there,\" she said, pointing to the exact spot Maia had just marked in her notebook. \"She said she liked to be able to see the sea while she was creaming the butter and sugar. Said it made everything taste better.\" Maia smiled, a genuine, unforced smile. She wasn't just building a caf\u00e9. She was inviting a ghost home."

                                        "text": "## Chapter 8\n\nThe drive to Manukau the next day was a journey in the opposite direction, in every conceivable way. Instead of the gentle ferry ride across the harbour to the quaint, hopeful streets of Devonport, they were in Liam\u2019s rattling ute, swallowed by the relentless, southbound current of the motorway. The city\u2019s iconic skyline, Maia\u2019s fragile monument of sugar and hope, receded in the rearview mirror, replaced by a sprawling, industrial landscape of warehouses, logistics depots, and factory outlets. The air seemed to grow heavier, the light harder. Maia clutched her notebook in her lap, the pages filled with lists, measurements, and a budget that felt thinner and more fragile with every kilometre they travelled. This was not a trip to see a dream; this was a pilgrimage to the graveyard of someone else\u2019s, in the hopes of salvaging some bones for her own.\n\nThe liquidated restaurant, \u2018La Trattoria del Ponte\u2019, was located in a soulless retail park, sandwiched between a discount tyre shop and a bulk-buy plumbing supplier. The cheerful, hand-painted sign depicting a rustic Italian bridge now seemed deeply ironic, a bridge to nowhere. The windows were papered over, and a stark, fluorescent-yellow auction notice was slapped across the front door. The hopeful energy of Devonport felt a world away, replaced by the grim finality of failure. A harried-looking woman from the auction house ticked their names off a list and unlocked the door, letting them into the gloom. The air inside was cold and stagnant, carrying the faint, sad smell of stale garlic, old cooking oil, and bleach. The main dining room was a scene of suspended animation; tables were pushed into a corner, chairs stacked high, and a single, faded menu lay on the floor, its promises of \u2018Authentic Italian Cuisine\u2019 now just a sad piece of litter.\n\nThey pushed through the swinging doors into the kitchen, the true heart of the operation, now silent and cold. Under the harsh buzz of the fluorescent lights, the stainless steel gleamed dully. This was no showroom. This was a workspace that had seen thousands of hours of frantic, sweaty, passionate labour. Liam, in his element, was transformed. He was no longer just Maia\u2019s supportive friend; he was a forensic engineer. He ran his hand under the lip of a prep table, checking for rust. He kicked the leg of a speed rack, testing the welds. He methodically opened and closed the doors of a low refrigeration unit, listening to the hum of the compressor and pressing his fingers to the seal, testing for leaks. Maia followed him with her notebook, a silent apprentice, as he gave his terse verdicts. \u201cTable\u2019s solid. Racks are good. Fridge motor\u2019s working overtime, seal\u2019s shot. Stay away from that one.\u201d\n\nIn the far corner, pushed up against a tiled wall stained with the ghosts of tomato sauce, was the main prize. The oven. It was a hulking, twin-deck, stainless-steel beast, an Italian brand she recognised but not the top-tier model she\u2019d dreamed of. It was a workhorse, not a show pony, bearing the dents and scorch marks of a long and difficult life in a busy kitchen. Her heart sank a little. It was so\u2026 industrial. So unlovely. But as Liam got to work, her aesthetic disappointment gave way to a grudging respect. He moved around it with the focused intensity of a bomb disposal expert, checking every dial, every hinge, every wire he could see. He pulled a crisp ten-dollar note from his wallet and closed it in the top oven door, then tried to pull it out. It slid free with almost no resistance. He grunted. \u201cGasket\u2019s completely worn. It\u2019s losing heat. Most people will see that and assume the door is warped. They\u2019ll walk away.\u201d He opened the door again and pointed to the black rubber seal lining the frame. \u201cBut see this? It\u2019s a standard size. We can get a new one for fifty bucks and install it ourselves in ten minutes.\u201d He gave the side of the machine a resounding, affectionate thump. \u201cThis old girl is solid as a rock. This is our advantage.\u201d\n\nWhile Liam was murmuring to the oven\u2019s electrical panel, Maia\u2019s eyes scanned the rest of the kitchen. Her gaze fell on a small, cluttered shelf above a prep station. Tucked behind a row of spice jars filled with faded, clumpy herbs was a small, worn photograph held to the wall with a piece of yellowing tape. It showed a beaming, round-faced man with a magnificent moustache, his arm around a laughing woman, both of them in chef\u2019s whites. In front of them was a towering, elaborate wedding cake. She felt a powerful jolt of kinship. This man, this woman\u2014they were like her. They had built this kitchen, invested their hopes and savings into these very machines. And for some reason, it had all fallen apart. The risk she was taking suddenly became terrifyingly real. She wasn't just buying equipment; she was stepping into a space haunted by a dream that had died. For a moment, she felt like a vulture, picking over the remains. Then a different feeling replaced it: a sense of duty. She would take these tools, this ghost of a kitchen, and she would make them work again. She would honour the dream that had failed by building one that would succeed.\n\nThey left the silent restaurant and returned to the ute, the bright sunlight making them blink. They sat for a long time on the open tailgate, the sounds of the industrial park a dull hum around them. Liam had his notebook out now, and they began to formulate their battle plan. They went through Maia\u2019s list item by item, assigning a maximum bid to each one, a cold, hard number that represented the absolute limit she was willing to pay. For the convection oven, they agreed on a bold but not reckless figure, banking on Liam\u2019s discovery of the faulty gasket to keep the competition low. For the indestructible Kenwood mixer, they set a firm price. The prep tables, the racks, the sinks\u2014every item was given a value. \u201cThe pizza oven,\u201d Liam said, pointing to it on the list. \u201cThat\u2019s your wildcard. If we get the main stuff cheap, we go for it. If not, we let it go. Stick to the plan, Hart. No emotion. It\u2019s just numbers.\u201d\n\nDriving back across the city as the afternoon bled into evening, Maia felt a profound shift within herself. The fear and anxiety had not vanished, but they had been compressed, forged by the day\u2019s realities into a new, harder substance: resolve. She was no longer just the baker, the artist who could coax beauty from flour and sugar. She was the businesswoman with a budget, the strategist with a plan, the treasure hunter about to walk into a battle of nerves and numbers. She looked at her notebook, at the neat columns of items and prices. It was her armour. Tomorrow, she would walk into that auction not as an orphan from nowhere hoping for a lucky break, but as the proprietor of The Gable, ready to claim the heart of her kitchen."

                                        "text": "The auction was held in a cavernous, cold warehouse that smelled of dust, stale coffee, and collective anxiety. It was a purgatory for failed businesses, where the tools of forgotten dreams were laid out under harsh fluorescent lights, tagged and numbered for dissection. The crowd was a cross-section of the city\u2019s ambition and desperation: sharp-suited men from restaurant groups looking for bargains, weary-looking couples with hopeful eyes and thin wallets, and gruff, predatory dealers who circled the lots like sharks, their catalogues filled with cynical calculations. Maia clutched her notebook to her chest, the pages of handwritten notes feeling like a fragile shield against the brutal reality of the room. Liam stood beside her, a solid, calming presence. He was in his element, his gaze sweeping the crowd, categorising them as easily as he would diagnose a faulty engine. \u201cSee the guy in the blue shirt?\u201d he murmured, his voice low. \u201cHe\u2019s a dealer. He\u2019ll bid on everything to drive the price up. Ignore him. The couple near the back, they\u2019re like you. All heart, small budget. They\u2019re not your competition. It\u2019s the quiet ones you have to watch.\u201d\n\nThe auctioneer, a man with a rapid-fire patter and tired eyes, launched into the smaller lots. The pace was bewildering, a blur of numbers and nods. Following their plan, they let the cutlery and crockery go, ignoring the small temptations. Then came the stainless-steel prep tables. Liam gave a subtle nod. Maia raised her paddle, her heart hammering. She won the first two for a price well under their maximum. A small, thrilling victory. Next were the speed racks. They got three for a steal, the dealer in the blue shirt having dismissed them as low-value. With each successful bid, a clerk would appear at her side with an invoice, and the number at the top of her budget page would shrink. The initial thrill of winning was tempered by the cold, hard reality of the cost, a constant, sobering subtraction from her future.\n\nThen came Lot 47: the thirty-quart Kenwood mixer. It stood on a pallet, its white enamel paint chipped and scarred, a veteran of a thousand battles with dough and batter. \u201cA true workhorse, this one,\u201d the auctioneer announced, giving it a paternal pat. The bidding started immediately and was brisk. The couple from the back put in a hopeful early bid before being quickly priced out. Then the man in the crisp shirt, one of the quiet ones Liam had pointed out, entered the fray. He bid with an air of bored entitlement, as if the mixer were already his. The price climbed steadily, approaching the hard limit Maia and Liam had set. Her hand, holding the paddle, began to feel heavy. This was a key piece. But Liam had been adamant: *No emotion. It\u2019s just numbers.* The price hit their maximum. The man in the crisp shirt raised it by another fifty dollars. Liam gave a subtle, almost imperceptible shake of his head. It was over. But then the man smirked, a quick, arrogant little smile, and something stubborn and defiant flared in Maia\u2019s chest. She lifted her paddle, her eyes locked on the auctioneer. \u201cAnd twenty-five,\u201d she called out, her voice clear. The bid was small, a signal not of wealth, but of sheer refusal to be dismissed. The man\u2019s smirk faltered. He looked at her, then at the beaten-up mixer, and with a disdainful shrug, he turned away. The hammer fell. The mixer was hers, for twenty-five dollars over budget. Liam let out a long, slow breath beside her. \u201cYou got lucky,\u201d he muttered. \u201cDon\u2019t do that again.\u201d\n\nThey let the faulty refrigeration unit go, watching with quiet satisfaction as another bidder, a man who hadn\u2019t done his homework, overpaid for it. The small act of discipline settled Maia\u2019s nerves after her impulsive bid for the mixer. She had proven to herself she could stick to the plan, mostly. The room began to thin out as the lower-value items were cleared. The air grew heavier with anticipation. The main events were coming. Maia\u2019s palms were slick with sweat. Her notebook felt flimsy now, the numbers on the page a poor defence against the brutal, fast-paced arithmetic of the room.\n\n\u201cAnd now, ladies and gentlemen, Lot 72,\u201d the auctioneer boomed, gesturing to the hulking metal beast in the centre of the room. \u201cThe twin-deck convection oven. Italian-made, in, shall we say, a well-used condition. We\u2019ll start the bidding at one thousand dollars.\u201d A thousand dollars. It was a laughably low starting point. A few lazy bids from the dealers took it to three thousand. Maia and Liam exchanged a look. They waited, their stillness a stark contrast to the nervous energy rippling through the room. The bidding stalled at four thousand. Most of the room, just as Liam predicted, saw a worn-out machine with a dodgy door, an expensive problem waiting to happen. The auctioneer began his final call. \u201cFour thousand dollars, a bargain for a piece like this. Any advance?\u201d Liam gave the nod. Maia lifted her paddle. \u201cFive thousand,\u201d she said, her voice steady. The auctioneer\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cFive thousand I have! A new bidder! Do I hear six?\u201d Silence. The dealers shook their heads. The man in the crisp shirt was gone. The hammer was raised. \u201cGoing once\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cSeven thousand!\u201d The voice was sharp and clear, cutting through the silence from the back of the warehouse. Maia\u2019s head whipped around. A woman in an expensive-looking trench coat, who hadn't bid on a single item all day, had her paddle raised. Her eyes were fixed on the oven with an unblinking, professional intensity. She knew exactly what she was looking at. The game had changed. The few remaining serious bidders, sensing a fight, re-entered the fray. The price jumped, leaving Maia\u2019s steal of a price in the dust. Seven, eight, nine thousand. It flew past the midway point of Maia\u2019s budget for it. The dealers dropped out, shaking their heads. It was now a two-horse race: Maia Hart, the hopeful baker, versus the cool, calculating woman in the trench coat.\n\nThe price hit their absolute, hard-as-rock maximum limit. The woman in the coat had the bid. \u201cThis is it,\u201d Liam murmured, his voice tight with tension. \u201cThis is where we walk. We can find another one.\u201d But Maia couldn\u2019t look away from the oven. She saw it not as it was, dented and grimy in this cold warehouse, but as it would be, the warm, beating heart of her own kitchen, light spilling from its windows, the smell of baking bread filling the air of The Gable. She thought of the chalk line on her floor. She thought of Mrs Gable, and the photo of the happy, failed restaurateurs. She couldn\u2019t lose it. Not now. Breaking every rule she had set for herself, ignoring Liam's rigid discipline and the frantic screaming of her own budget, she lifted her paddle high. \u201cAnd five hundred,\u201d she called out, her voice ringing with a desperate finality. It wasn\u2019t a bid; it was a declaration of war. It was almost all the capital she had left for equipment. It was everything.\n\nA profound silence fell over the warehouse. Every eye was on the woman in the coat. She held Maia\u2019s gaze for a long, charged moment, her expression a mixture of irritation and grudging respect. A silent calculation flickered in her eyes. Then, with a curt, almost imperceptible shake of her head, she lowered her paddle. The auctioneer, sensing the climax, let the moment hang in the air. \u201cGoing once,\u201d he called, his voice resonating in the stillness. \u201cGoing twice\u2026\u201d The hammer came down with a thunderous crack that made Maia flinch. \u201cSOLD! For twenty-two thousand, five hundred dollars, to the lady with the notebook!\u201d A wave of dizziness washed over Maia, and she sagged back in her plastic chair, her knuckles white where she gripped her notes. Liam grabbed her arm, his grip grounding her. \u201cYou are completely and utterly insane, Hart,\u201d he whispered, but his voice was thick with a mixture of terror and absolute awe. A clerk handed her the final invoice, and she stared at the number, feeling sick. It was a figure of terrifying, beautiful victory. The heart of her kitchen had been won."

The world of the auction house rushed on around Maia\u2014the auctioneer was already introducing the next lot, the remaining bidders had shifted their attention\u2014but she was frozen, suspended in the echo of her own reckless bid. The flimsy carbon-copy invoice in her hand felt heavier than the glass trophy. The number written on it wasn't a prize; it was a debt, a promise, a terrifying leap of faith she had taken without a safety net. She felt Liam\u2019s hand on her back, a steadying pressure. He leaned in, his voice a low rumble in her ear. \u201cBreathe, Hart. You own an oven. Now we have to figure out how to get the damn thing home.\u201d His words, blunt and practical, were the pin that popped the bubble of her paralysis. The elation and terror receded, replaced by the crushing, immediate weight of logistics.\n\nThey remained for the rest of the auction, a self-imposed penance. Maia watched, her stomach churning, as other people\u2019s dreams and necessities were bought and sold. Then came Lot 94: the twin-deck pizza oven. It was a handsome piece of equipment, not as essential as her convection oven, but it had sparked a secondary dream of Friday nights at The Gable, of sourdough bases and bubbling mozzarella. It was the wildcard, the \u2018nice-to-have\u2019 that was now an impossibility. She watched as a young couple, the ones Liam had pointed out earlier, entered the bidding with a desperate, hopeful energy. They fought for it, their bids small but determined, and finally won it for a price that felt both fair and, to Maia, deeply painful. It was the first, tangible sacrifice she had to make, the first dream she had to let go of to protect the larger one. She watched them sign their own invoice, their faces alight with a joy she had felt only an hour ago, and a sharp, unexpected grief lanced through her.\n\nThe drive back to the city was heavy with a silence that was different from the comfortable quiet they usually shared. The ute felt cavernous without the weight of their hopes for the auction filling it. Liam drove with a grim focus, his knuckles white on the steering wheel. Finally, as they merged onto the Harbour Bridge, with the familiar, glittering skyline spread out before them, he spoke. \u201cYou could have lost everything today, Maia,\u201d he said, his voice low and devoid of anger, which was somehow worse. It was filled with a deep, aching fear for her. \u201cYou had a plan, a budget. You threw it all away on a feeling.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt wasn't a feeling,\u201d she replied, her voice barely a whisper. She looked at her reflection in the passenger window, a pale ghost against the backdrop of the city lights. \u201cIt was a choice. All my life, I\u2019ve taken the leftovers. The last foster home, the hand-me-down clothes, the dented cans at the supermarket. I\u2019ve been resourceful because I\u2019ve had to be. But in that room, when that woman in the coat tried to take it, I realised I was tired of settling. I didn\u2019t want the sensible, second-best option. I wanted the heart of my kitchen. I was willing to fight for it.\u201d She turned to look at him, her eyes pleading for him to understand. \u201cI know it was reckless. I know I\u2019ve made everything ten times harder. But for the first time in my life, Liam, I didn\u2019t back down. I chose.\u201d He didn\u2019t reply, but the tension in his shoulders eased almost imperceptibly, his grip on the steering wheel softening.\n\nThe next day was dubbed \u2018Operation Extraction\u2019. Liam, true to his word, had called in his favours. Two of his friends, a bear of a man named Samo and a wiry, tattooed panel-beater named Gaz, arrived at the shuttered restaurant just after the truck Liam had rented for the day. The task of moving the kitchen was a brutal symphony of grunts, curses, and screeching metal. The convection oven was a monster, a half-tonne monument to Maia\u2019s recklessness. It took all four of them, a heavy-duty dolly, and a terrifyingly steep loading ramp to manoeuvre it onto the truck, its immense weight making the vehicle groan in protest. They loaded the mixer, the tables, the racks, and the sinks, each piece a hard-won trophy from the previous day\u2019s battle. By the time they were finished, they were all drenched in sweat, covered in grime, and united in a weary camaraderie.\n\nArriving in Devonport was like bringing a circus to a slumbering village. The huge rental truck looked absurdly out of place on the quiet street. They reversed it up to the door of The Gable with inches to spare, drawing a small crowd of curious onlookers, including Shirley Henderson, who watched with a mixture of delight and horror from a safe distance. The process of getting the equipment into the shop was even more difficult than getting it out of the restaurant. The doorway was narrow, the floor uneven. The oven, their primary antagonist, became wedged at a cruel angle, refusing to budge. For twenty minutes, it seemed like an impossible problem, the final, humiliating obstacle. But Liam, with a mechanic\u2019s ingenuity, used a car jack and a series of wooden blocks to lift and pivot the beast, and with a final, collective shove, it scraped through the doorway and into the main room.\n\nOne by one, they wheeled the pieces of her kitchen into place. It was no longer a floor plan in a notebook; it was a reality of steel and enamel. The hulking oven was wrestled into the back room, settling into its designated spot against the wall with a decisive thud. The battered Kenwood mixer, her small, emotional victory, was placed on the floor where Shirley had said the old one used to be, in sight of the sea. The prep tables were lined up against the wall, their dented surfaces gleaming under the bare bulb. It wasn't a shiny, new kitchen from a catalogue. It was a collection of scarred, second-hand soldiers, each with its own history of battles fought in other kitchens. They were hers. Every dent, every scratch, every scorch mark was a testament to the fact that she had fought for them.\n\nLiam and his friends finally left as dusk settled, leaving Maia alone in the transformed space. The air was no longer empty; it was filled with the silent, metallic presence of her new kitchen. She walked to the oven and placed her palm flat against the cold steel of its door. She could still see the ghost of the worn gasket, the flaw that had given her an advantage. She thought of the invoice, the terrifying number that now represented the bulk of her life savings. But standing there, surrounded by her hard-won, second-hand army, the fear was different. It was no longer the free-floating anxiety of an uncertain future. It was the focused, productive fear of a person with a mountain of work to do and the tools to do it. She ran a hand over the chipped paint of her mixer, then across the scarred surface of a prep table. This was real. She wasn't a little girl playing shop. She was a builder standing on her own foundation, ready to get to work."

                                        "text": "The days that followed blurred into a gruelling marathon of manual labour. The romance of building her dream was quickly replaced by the gritty, unglamorous reality of dust, sweat, and aching muscles. Mornings began before dawn, with Maia and Liam meeting at the shop, armed with coffee and a shared, grim determination. The first task was the floor. They rented a monstrous industrial grinder and, wearing masks and goggles that made them look like post-apocalyptic scavengers, began the painstaking process of stripping away decades of old adhesive and grime from the concrete. The noise was deafening, a high-pitched scream that vibrated through the soles of their feet, and the dust was a constant, choking presence. It was miserable, soul-destroying work. As Maia guided the heavy machine across the floor, her arms trembling with the effort, she found herself wondering if she had made a terrible mistake, trading the elegant science of patisserie for the brute force of construction.\n\nLiam, however, thrived in the chaos. He attacked the work with a relentless energy, seeing not a mess, but a series of problems to be solved. While Maia wrestled with the grinder, he was on his knees, crowbar in hand, ripping up the rotten skirting boards. He found the source of the water damage they had spotted on day one\u2014a leaky downpipe outside\u2014and patched it with a combination of sealant and sheer stubbornness. He became her project manager, her foreman, and her entire construction crew rolled into one. He taught her how to mix plaster, how to find studs in the walls, how to use a power drill without stripping the screws. Her hands, once soft and dusted with flour, became calloused and flecked with paint. She learned a new vocabulary, a language of spackle, grout, and load-bearing walls. In the evenings, she would collapse onto her sofa, too tired even to cook, her body aching in places she didn't know could ache, and fall asleep dreaming of wiring diagrams and plumbing schematics.\n\nThe budget, or what was left of it, was a constant, terrifying spectre. The professional jobs\u2014the electrical and plumbing\u2014could not be avoided. Maia spent hours on the phone, getting quotes, her heart sinking with each conversation. The electricians laid out the cost of running commercial-grade wiring, installing a new breaker box, and fitting the dozens of outlets she would need. The plumbers quoted a figure for running new water lines and a waste pipe that made her feel physically ill. To save money, Maia and Liam became their unpaid apprentices. They spent a whole weekend crawling under the floorboards in the cramped, spider-filled space, pulling new electrical cables through the joists under the electrician's sharp-eyed supervision. Liam, with his mechanic's understanding of systems, took to it quickly, but for Maia, it was a claustrophobic nightmare. She emerged at the end of the day, covered in cobwebs and dirt, with a new and profound respect for tradespeople and a deeper understanding of just how much her recklessness at the auction had cost her.\n\nJust when she felt she was at her breaking point, the community would offer a small, unexpected kindness that felt like a lifeline. Shirley Henderson became a daily visitor, arriving at precisely 4 PM with her tartan flask of tea and a plate of her lopsided but delicious scones. She would survey their progress with a critical eye, offering unsolicited advice and stories about how Agnes Gable used to arrange her shelves. The man with the terrier, whose name they learned was Arthur, stopped by with a shoebox full of old, sepia-toned photographs of the shop in its heyday as a bustling dairy, the street full of vintage cars. Seeing the black-and-white images of Agnes Gable, a formidable-looking woman with kind eyes, standing proudly behind a counter laden with sweets, solidified Maia's sense of purpose. She wasn't just renovating a shop; she was restoring a piece of the village's heart. Another time, the owner of the neighbouring bookshop brought them a box of sandwiches, saying simply, \"You can't build an empire on an empty stomach.\" Each gesture was a small deposit into her depleted reserves of hope.\n\nThe first real setback came, as they always do, from an unexpected quarter. The new gasket for the oven door, the \"fifty-buck, ten-minute fix\" that had been Liam's ace in the hole, proved to be an elusive prize. The brand was obscure, the model discontinued. Liam spent hours on the phone with suppliers in Australia and Europe, only to be met with dead ends. The fifty-dollar fix was turning into a cross-continental search for a unicorn. Without a perfect seal, the oven would be hopelessly inefficient, bleeding heat and money, making a mockery of her precise baking times. The beautiful, hard-won heart of her kitchen was flawed, and the simple solution had evaporated. The weight of her gamble at the auction came crashing back down on her. She had bankrupted her future for a broken machine. That evening, she sat alone on the dusty floor, staring at the useless oven, and for the first time since this whole insane journey began, she cried not from joy or relief, but from the cold, hard certainty that she was going to fail.\n\nLiam found her there, a small, desolate figure in the half-finished shop, lit only by the cold glow of a single work light. He didn\u2019t say \"I told you so.\" He didn't offer platitudes. He just sat on the floor beside her and handed her a greasy rag to wipe her eyes. They sat in silence for a long time, the shadow of the useless oven looming over them. \"It's not just the gasket, is it?\" he said finally, his voice rough. She shook her head, unable to speak. \"It's the money,\" she whispered, the words catching in her throat. \"It's all the money. There's nothing left. If I can't fix this oven, I have nothing. I'll have a lease, a pile of debt, and a room full of junk.\" The full scope of her failure was laid bare in the stark, empty room. The dream of The Gable, with its sea-green door and the smell of cardamom buns, dissolved into the pathetic reality of a girl who had reached too far and fallen too hard. Liam listened, letting her pour out all the fear and doubt she had been holding back. When she was finished, her voice a raw whisper, he stood up and walked to the oven. He ran his hand over the door, his mechanic's mind clicking and whirring. \"Okay,\" he said, turning back to her. \"So, the part doesn't exist. That's a problem. But it's not the end of the world.\" He paused, a new idea beginning to form in his eyes. \"The problem isn't the oven. The problem is the seal. It's just a specific shape of heat-resistant rubber. We can't buy it. So\u2026 we'll make it.\""

                                        "text": "## Chapter 10\n\n\u201cMake it?\u201d The words were absurd, a nonsensical string of syllables in the face of her overwhelming despair. \u201cMake what, Liam? A miracle?\u201d She gestured helplessly at the oven, a monument to her failure. \u201cThat\u2019s a precision-engineered part from a factory in Italy, not something you can whip up with a spanner and some duct tape.\u201d Her voice was sharp with the brittle edge of hopelessness, the last defence of someone who had given up. She expected him to falter, to finally admit defeat. But Liam was unfazed. He was already looking at the oven door not as a problem, but as a puzzle, his mechanic\u2019s mind dismantling it into its constituent parts.\n\n\u201cNot duct tape,\u201d he said, his voice calm and maddeningly reasonable. \u201cSilicone. High-temperature, food-grade liquid silicone. People use it to make custom baking moulds all the time, right? A gasket is just a mould in reverse. We take a perfect impression of the channel in the oven frame, build a housing for it, pour the liquid silicone, and let it cure.\u201d He looked at her, a spark of excitement in his eyes, the thrill of the challenge overriding the gloom. \u201cIt\u2019s just a recipe, Hart. A different kind of recipe. And you\u2019re the best there is at following a recipe.\u201d\n\nHis logic was so simple, so audacious, that it bypassed her despair and landed somewhere in the region of grudging admiration. He was right. It was just a series of steps. Measure, mix, mould, wait. It was an alchemy she understood. The idea was a tiny, flickering flame in the vast darkness of her fear, but it was enough. For the first time in hours, she stood up, brushing the dust from her jeans. The search for a non-existent part was over. The quest to create an impossible one had just begun. Their new partnership, the baker and the mechanic, found its new purpose. Maia, with her steady hands and her intuitive understanding of delicate processes, would be in charge of the mould. Liam, with his knowledge of materials and his fearless approach to fabrication, would handle the chemistry.\n\nThe first step was taking the impression. After an hour of frantic online research, they settled on a fine-grain modeling clay, the kind used by sculptors for detailed work. Kneading the clay in her hands, Maia felt a flicker of a familiar sensation. It was like working a stiff dough, bringing it to the right temperature and consistency. With painstaking precision, she began pressing the soft, yielding clay into the deep, narrow channel that ran around the oven\u2019s frame. It was a slow, meditative process. She worked in small sections, ensuring every millimetre of the groove was perfectly captured, her baker\u2019s focus narrowed down to this single, crucial task. Liam watched in silence, trusting her instincts, his usual boisterous energy subdued into a quiet, respectful observance of her craft. When she finally peeled the last section of clay away, they were left with a long, perfect negative impression of the channel, a fragile map of their solution.\n\nThe next stage belonged to Liam. He constructed a shallow, coffin-like box from scraps of melamine, building a precise housing around the delicate clay impression. This would be their mould. While he worked, Maia was on the phone, tracking down a supplier for the silicone. She found a specialty chemical company in East Tamaki that sold two-part, platinum-cure silicone, certified as food-safe up to 250 degrees Celsius. It was expensive, another painful bite out of her dwindling funds, but it was their only shot. As Liam drove out to pick it up, Maia sat alone in the shop, guarding the fragile clay mould as if it were the most precious thing in the world. In that moment, it was.\n\nWhen Liam returned with two unlabelled plastic tubs, the atmosphere in the shop shifted again, becoming as tense and focused as the final moments of a Showstopper bake. This was the point of no return. They had one shot; the silicone was too expensive to afford a mistake. Following the technical data sheet with religious precision, they measured the two liquids, the viscous base and the thinner catalyst, into a clean bucket. Maia did the pouring, her movements slow and steady, her baker\u2019s eye judging the volume. Then, with a clean paddle, Liam began to stir, his movements smooth and consistent to avoid introducing air bubbles that could create weak spots in the final gasket. The mixture turned a milky, translucent white. They had a working time of thirty minutes before it would begin to set. There was no time to waste.\n\nWith a shared, silent nod, they tipped the bucket. The liquid silicone flowed into the mould with a thick, satisfying slowness, filling the negative space of the clay impression, covering the intricate details she had so carefully captured. It crept into every corner of the melamine box, a pristine white flood that promised either salvation or financial ruin. Once it was poured, there was nothing more to do. The chemical reaction had begun, and the outcome was now out of their hands. The data sheet recommended a twenty-four-hour cure time. A full day of waiting. A full day of not knowing. The silence in the shop was heavy with the weight of their gamble. As if on cue, the door creaked open and Shirley Henderson bustled in, her tartan flask in hand. \u201cGoodness me, you two look like you\u2019ve just seen a ghost!\u201d she declared cheerfully, utterly oblivious to the high-stakes chemistry experiment curing on the workbench. \u201cNothing a good cup of tea won\u2019t fix.\u201d Her mundane, comforting presence was so jarringly normal that Maia let out a laugh that was dangerously close to a sob."

                                        "text": "The tea was sweet, milky, and absurdly normal. Shirley chattered on about the upcoming village f\u00eate and the deplorable state of the petunias in the public planters, her cheerful monologue a protective bubble around Maia and Liam\u2019s silent, screaming tension. They sipped their tea, nodding in the right places, their eyes repeatedly flicking to the workbench where the white liquid sat, placid and inscrutable. It was a surreal pantomime of civility. At one point, Shirley gestured towards the wall with her cup. \u201cAgnes always said the secret to a good business was good bones. She meant the shop, of course, but I think she meant people, too. Sturdy stock, she\u2019d say.\u201d The innocent remark landed with the weight of prophecy. Maia looked at Liam, his face grimy but his posture solid and unwavering, and felt a surge of something stronger than hope: gratitude. She wasn't facing this alone. When Shirley finally bustled out, leaving them with two empty cups and a plate of scone crumbs, the silence that descended was no longer one of despair. It was the quiet of a team before a big game, focused and ready.\n\nLiam broke it first, his voice low and practical. \u201cOkay. We have twenty-four hours to kill. We can\u2019t watch it cure. That\u2019s like watching a pot to make it boil. We need to work.\u201d He walked to the corner where they had stacked cans of paint and rollers. \u201cThe electrician is coming in two days to start the rough-in. He needs clean walls. So today, we paint.\u201d The task was brilliantly chosen. It was large, physical, and transformative. It was something they could control. They pryed open the large tins of white paint, the clean, chemical smell cutting through the dust. They poured the thick, creamy liquid into trays and began to roll it onto the dirty, patched-up walls. The first stroke of white against the grimy cream was a revelation. It was a fresh start, a blank page. The simple, repetitive motion of rolling the paint up and down the walls became a form of meditation. It was mindless, rhythmic work that occupied their bodies and freed their minds from the frantic what-ifs. They worked in a comfortable, practiced silence, the only sounds the soft whir of the rollers and the occasional clatter of a paint tray. With every section of wall they covered, the space brightened, the years of neglect and grime disappearing under a clean, optimistic coat of white. They were literally building her blank canvas.\n\nThe long day bled into a long, sleepless night for Maia. She went back to her tiny flat, but the silence there was different from the productive quiet of the shop. It was empty and loud with her own anxieties. She lay awake, picturing the silicone mixture at a molecular level, imagining bubbles forming, weak spots appearing, the chemical reaction failing. She imagined peeling it away to find a sticky, useless mess. By dawn, she had convinced herself of their failure. She arrived back at the shop haggard and hollow-eyed, expecting to find Liam equally on edge. Instead, she found him already there, calmly sanding a piece of timber he had salvaged from the demolition pile, planning to repurpose it as a shelf. He took one look at her face, handed her a coffee, and simply said, \u201cAlmost time.\u201d His steadiness was an anchor. The shop, now gleaming with its first coat of pristine white paint, felt different. It was brighter, cleaner, and full of a quiet, waiting potential. It looked like a place where good things could happen. The twenty-four hours were up.\n\nThey approached the workbench with the reverence of priests approaching an altar. The silicone in the melamine box was no longer liquid. It was a solid, opaque block of milky white, smooth and firm to the touch. It had set. That was the first hurdle cleared. The next was demoulding it without tearing it. Liam worked with the painstaking care of a surgeon, using a screwdriver to gently pry the sides of the melamine box away. The wood splintered and cracked, but the silicone inside remained pristine. With the sides removed, all that was left was to peel the original clay impression from the newly formed gasket. This was Maia\u2019s job. Her fingers, trembling slightly, found an edge. Holding her breath, she began to lift. The clay, now dry and brittle, came away cleanly, revealing the intricate, perfect negative of the shape beneath. The newly created gasket lay on the bench, a long, flexible, impossibly perfect replica of the channel it was designed to fill. It was smooth, flawless, and free of a single air bubble. It was beautiful.\n\nNow for the final, terrifying test. Maia lifted the gasket. It felt supple and strong in her hands, a bizarre and wonderful creation born of their shared desperation. She carried it to the oven, her heart pounding a frantic rhythm against her ribs. She lined it up with the empty channel in the oven door frame. With gentle pressure from her fingertips, she began to press it into place. It slid into the groove as if it were made for it, a perfect, snug fit. It was a moment of pure, unadulterated magic. She ran her finger along its length, the smooth, resilient rubber a testament to their insane gamble. She stepped back. Liam reached out and slowly, deliberately, closed the heavy oven door. Instead of the loose, metallic rattle it had made before, it closed with a soft, solid, deeply satisfying *thump*. There was no give, no wobble. It was sealed. But they needed to be sure. Liam pulled the same crisp ten-dollar note from his wallet, the one that had started this whole ordeal. He slid it halfway into the doorframe and closed the door on it. He tugged gently. The note held fast. He tugged harder. It wouldn't budge. He looked at Maia, his face, for once, utterly devoid of its usual cynical humour, and broke into a grin so wide it seemed to light up the entire room.\n\nA choked, hysterical laugh bubbled up out of Maia\u2019s chest, a sound of pure, unadulterated relief that echoed in the newly painted space. She threw her arms around Liam\u2019s neck, burying her face in his dusty, paint-splattered shoulder as he hugged her back, lifting her off the ground in a triumphant, spinning circle. They had done it. They had faced an impossible, budget-destroying problem and had solved it not with money, but with ingenuity, desperation, and a trust in each other\u2019s skills. The oven, which had been a symbol of her recklessness and looming failure, was now a monument to her resilience. Standing in the bright, white room, surrounded by the tools she had fought for, with the heart of her kitchen now beating strong and true, she knew with a certainty that reached down to her bones that she would not fail. The Gable was going to be real."
