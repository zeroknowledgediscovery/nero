     "novel_text": "The hum was back. A low, persistent thrumming at the base of his skull, a resonance that was less a sound and more a feeling, like a plucked cello string vibrating through the foundations of the house. Jake opened his eyes. The morning light, filtered through the fine-boned leaves of the silver birch at the bottom of the garden, was a pale, watery green. It was the colour of peace. The hum, however, was the colour of trouble. He\u2019d learned to differentiate the frequencies over the years. This wasn\u2019t the high, frantic whine of a distant starship battle, a ghost-memory from a life he\u2019d fought to forget. Nor was it the deep, sonorous toll of a great disturbance in the Force, the kind that heralded the fall of a Republic or the death of a star.\n\nThis was a local hum. An Epsom hum. It tasted of damp soil, exhaust fumes from the M25, and a peculiar, specific anxiety that felt entirely his own. He swung his legs out of bed, the old floorboards groaning a familiar complaint. He was a man out of time. Or perhaps, more accurately, a man out of place. The Jedi of Epsom. It sounded like a bad pub quiz team name. He\u2019d long ago traded his woven robes for soft cotton jumpers and his lightsaber for a well-oiled pair of secateurs he kept in the garden shed. The discipline remained, the connection to the great, flowing river of life that bound the galaxy together, but here, in this quiet corner of Surrey, it manifested in stranger, more terrestrial ways. He could feel the thirst of the David Austin roses, a faint, prickly desperation in their stems. He could sense the slow, methodical ambition of the bindweed as it plotted its assault on the herbaceous border. He was, to all intents and purposes, a glorified gardener with a cosmic sixth sense.\n\nWhich was why he had Liam.\n\nThe hum intensified as he walked down the stairs, his hand trailing along the cool, painted wood of the banister. He could feel the approach. Not a threat, not an enemy, but a convergence. A white Ford Transit van, its engine a rough-and-ready diesel gargle, was turning onto his street. Jake reached the kitchen just as the van pulled up, the crunch of its tyres on the gravel drive a sound more comforting to him than any temple bell. He filled the kettle, his movements economical, practiced. He didn\u2019t need to look out of the window to know that Liam was now wrestling a heavy-duty mower from the back of the van, his brow already furrowed in concentration.\n\nLiam didn\u2019t so much arrive as coalesce. He seemed to gather himself from the elements of the suburban morning\u2014the smell of cut grass, the glint of sun on a car windscreen, the quiet industry of it all. He was a man made of earth and effort. His hands, when Jake had first shaken one, were not soft, but they weren't rough either; they were simply capable, a cartography of labour etched into the palms and knuckles. He had soil under his fingernails that no amount of scrubbing could fully exorcise. Jake found it endlessly fascinating.\n\n\u201cMorning,\u201d Liam called out, his voice carrying easily through the open kitchen window. It was a voice that matched the rest of him: solid, unadorned, with a slight, pleasant rasp, as if it had been lightly sanded.\n\n\u201cMorning, Liam,\u201d Jake replied, his own voice smoother, quieter. \u201cKettle\u2019s on.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a saint, Jake. The lawn\u2019s a proper jungle this week. That fertilizer you had me put down worked a bit too well.\u201d\n\nJake smiled. He hadn't just *had* him put it down. He'd stood beside the bag of feed, closed his eyes for a moment, and pushed a little thread of warmth, of vibrant, blooming life, into the granules. A little nudge. A Jedi mind trick for ryegrass. It was cheating, but it made the garden so ridiculously, preternaturally lush that he couldn't help himself. It was his one small vanity.\n\nBy the time Liam came in, wiping his boots meticulously on the mat, Jake had two mugs of tea waiting on the worn pine of the kitchen table. One for Liam: strong, milky, two sugars. One for himself: Earl Grey, a sliver of lemon, no sugar. It was a ritual they had perfected over the past six months, a small ceremony that marked the beginning of their Tuesdays. Liam took his mug, his calloused fingers wrapping around the ceramic, and looked out at the garden.\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d he said, taking a fortifying gulp of tea. \u201cThe lawn first, I reckon. Then I\u2019ll tackle the weeds behind the shed. They\u2019re getting cheeky. And those roses of yours, the yellow ones\u2026 they\u2019re starting to look a bit leggy. Might need a prune.\u201d\n\nJake just nodded, watching him. He loved listening to Liam talk about the garden. He spoke of it not as a collection of plants, but as a community of difficult, sometimes fractious, individuals. The \u2018cheeky\u2019 weeds, the \u2018sulking\u2019 hydrangeas, the \u2018arrogant\u2019 stand of bamboo that was always trying to invade its neighbours. He gave them personality, life. He saw the garden the way Jake *felt* it.\n\nThis was the problem. This was the source of the hum.\n\nOver the past few months, the quiet appreciation Jake felt for his gardener had\u2026 changed. It had deepened, coloured, taken on a new and terrifying texture. It started as a simple admiration for his work ethic, the sheer, honest physicality of it. Then it became an appreciation for his quiet competence, the way he could diagnose a case of black spot from ten paces or identify a bird by its call. But now, it was something else. It was the way the sun caught the flecks of gold in his brown hair when he bent to pull a weed. It was the easy line of his shoulders, the focused set of his jaw. It was the moments of shared silence, when they\u2019d both just stop and look at a particularly perfect bloom, a silence that was less an absence of sound and more a presence of quiet, a shared understanding that vibrated in the space between them.\n\nThe hum was Jake\u2019s own heart, amplified by the Force until it felt like a tectonic event. The anxiety was the cold, hard certainty that this was a complication he could not afford. Jedi were not supposed to form attachments. It was the first, most fundamental rule. Attachment leads to fear, fear leads to anger, anger\u2026 well, he knew the rest of the litany. He\u2019d seen it consume friends, masters, an entire galaxy. He had fled across star systems, erased his identity, and buried himself in the most unassuming corner of the Earth he could find, all to escape that cascade. All to live a life of quiet, detached peace.\n\nAnd now here he was, on the verge of falling hopelessly in love with his gardener.\n\n\u201cSomething on your mind, Jake?\u201d Liam asked, his gaze shifting from the garden to Jake\u2019s face. He had an unnervingly direct way of looking at people, as if he were checking for aphids.\n\nJake blinked, pulling himself back from the edge of his internal monologue. \u201cJust\u2026 thinking about the roses. You\u2019re right. They are getting a bit leggy.\u201d\n\nLiam nodded, accepting the explanation, but his eyes lingered for a moment longer than was strictly necessary. A flicker of something in their depths. Curiosity? Or was Jake just projecting his own turmoil onto the man? The Force was a treacherous mirror. It could show you the truth of the universe, but it could also show you the distorted, misshapen reflection of your own desires.\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ll get to it,\u201d Liam said, draining his mug and placing it gently in the sink. \u201cShout if you need me.\u201d\n\nJake watched him go, the back door clicking shut behind him. The hum in his head didn\u2019t fade. It settled, a low and constant baseline to the morning. He stayed at the table, his own tea growing cold. He could feel Liam out in the garden. He could sense the pull of the starter cord on the mower, the sharp, decisive snip of the secateurs, the focused intent of a man at peace with his work. Each action was a small, bright spark in the living tapestry of the Force. And Jake, against all his training, against every instinct for self-preservation he had honed over a lifetime of running, found himself leaning towards those sparks. He was a moth, and Liam was a gentle, unassuming flame. And he knew, with a certainty that chilled him to the bone, that he was going to get burned.\n\nHe spent the rest of the morning trying to meditate. He sat in his worn armchair in the living room, a room filled with books and the faint scent of beeswax polish. He closed his eyes and tried to cast his senses outwards, to feel the slow turning of the planet, the distant shimmer of the sun, the vast, cold emptiness between worlds. It was a technique he\u2019d used a thousand times to dissolve his sense of self, to merge with the cosmic tide and find detachment. But today, his focus kept collapsing. The universe would shrink, again and again, from the infinite to the finite, from the cosmic down to the specific, ten-metre-by-twenty-metre patch of lawn, trees, and flowerbeds just outside his window. He could feel the distress of a worm, sliced accidentally by Liam\u2019s trowel. He could feel the sudden, bright shock of a dandelion being plucked from the earth. And through it all, the steady, rhythmic presence of Liam himself, moving through the space with a purpose that Jake envied.\n\nGiving up, he went back to the kitchen and made a fresh pot of tea. He watched Liam through the window. The man was on his knees now, working along the edge of the border, his hands, bare as always, plunged into the dark soil. He worked with a fluid, unhurried grace that was mesmerising. There was no wasted motion. It was a kind of dance, a dialogue with the earth. Jake felt a sudden, sharp pang of something he could only identify as longing. A longing to be that grounded. To have a purpose that was so clear, so tangible, that you could hold it in your hands.\n\nHis own purpose had once been clear: to serve the Republic, to keep the peace, to be a guardian of justice. But the Republic was a smear of dust in a forgotten history book. The peace had shattered. And justice\u2026 justice was a concept that seemed to change depending on which end of a blaster you were standing. His purpose now was simply to exist. To not be found. To keep the past buried.\n\nThe hum in his head spiked, and the teacup in his hand rattled against its saucer. He looked down, saw his own hand trembling slightly. A vision, unbidden, flashed behind his eyes. Not a memory, not a premonition, but something else. A flicker. A possibility. It was this garden, but years from now. The silver birch was taller, thicker. The roses had climbed all the way to the roof of the shed. And he was there, older. But he wasn\u2019t alone. Liam was there too, his hair silvered at the temples, his face lined with laughter. They were sitting on a bench that didn\u2019t exist yet, their hands intertwined. The peace was absolute.\n\nThe image was so vivid, so filled with warmth and a profound sense of rightness, that it stole his breath. It felt\u2026 real. More real than the cold teacup in his hand. The Force wasn't just showing him a desire. It was showing him a path. A future.\n\nHe shook his head, trying to clear it. It was a fantasy. A dangerous, seductive fantasy born of loneliness. He had to stop this. He had to regain control. He would be professional. He would go out, discuss the state of the delphiniums, pay Liam for his time, and retreat back into his fortress of solitude.\n\nHe opened the back door. The air smelled of chlorophyll and petrol and damp earth. \u201cLiam,\u201d he called out, his voice a little too tight.\n\nLiam looked up. He was sweating slightly, a smudge of dirt on his cheek. He smiled, a genuine, unguarded smile that crinkled the corners of his eyes. \u201cAll right, Jake? Just finishing up here. That bindweed was putting up a real fight.\u201d\n\nAnd in that moment, looking at that open, honest face, Jake\u2019s resolve crumbled into dust. All the Jedi codes, all the years of discipline, all the fear and caution, they were just words. Just echoes. The hum in his head wasn't a warning anymore. It was a song. A stupid, reckless, beautiful song.\n\n\u201cI was thinking,\u201d Jake said, the words tumbling out before he could stop them. \u201cWhen you\u2019re done. If you\u2019re not busy. Maybe you\u2019d like to stay? For dinner?\u201d\n\nLiam\u2019s smile faltered for a second, his surprise evident. He wiped a hand on his trousers, smearing them with mud. He looked from Jake\u2019s face to the house, then back again. Jake\u2019s heart hammered against his ribs. He had broken his own rules. He had opened the door. He braced himself for the polite refusal, the awkward excuse.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Liam said, a slow grin spreading across his face, transforming it. \u201cYeah, Jake. I\u2019d like that very much.\u201dThe universe, Jake decided, had a truly wicked sense of humour. For a man who had once navigated asteroid fields at impossible speeds and negotiated peace treaties on moons with three suns, the simple act of figuring out what to cook for dinner felt like a challenge of galactic proportions. He stood frozen in his kitchen, the echo of Liam\u2019s acceptance still hanging in the air like ozone after a lightning strike. His mind, once a disciplined fortress, was now a frantic mess of potential menus and their corresponding social implications. A roast was too formal. A curry was too presumptive. Fish and chips felt like a cop-out. He was overthinking it, of course. The Force, which should have been a tool for clarity and insight, was instead helpfully supplying him with a thousand different visions of social failure, each one more excruciating than the last.\n\nHe settled, finally, on pasta. It was neutral territory. It was honest. It required chopping, which he hoped would occupy his hands and stop them from trembling. He pulled onions and garlic from a basket, their papery skins cool and dry beneath his fingertips. He could feel Liam outside, the rhythm of his work subtly changing. The sharp snip of the secateurs was replaced by the softer rustle of him gathering clippings, the scrape of a trowel being cleaned, the decisive thud of the shed door being latched. Each sound was a tick of a clock, counting down to a moment Jake had both engineered and dreaded. He felt a brief, absurd urge to use the Force to hold the sun in the sky, to suspend the afternoon in amber, but the moment passed. The path was set.\n\nLiam appeared at the back door a little while later, his boots left neatly on the step. He ran a hand through his hair, dislodging a stray leaf. He looked tired, content, and just a little bit uncertain. The easy familiarity of their morning ritual had been replaced by a new, more delicate awareness. They were no longer simply employer and gardener. They were two men about to have dinner.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a shower downstairs, if you want it,\u201d Jake said, gesturing with a knife he was using to chop tomatoes. The offer felt momentous, a crossing of some invisible domestic boundary. \u201cTowels are in the cupboard under the sink.\u201d\n\nLiam\u2019s expression was one of genuine gratitude. \u201cYou\u2019re a lifesaver. I must smell like a compost heap.\u201d He disappeared down the hall, and a few minutes later, Jake heard the rush of water. The sound was unnervingly intimate. A man was showering in his house. A man whose presence made the very foundations of his hard-won peace begin to shake. Jake turned back to the tomatoes, chopping them with a fierce, focused precision. He could feel the water, warm against Liam\u2019s skin. He could sense the simple, animal pleasure of washing away the grime of a day\u2019s work. He squeezed his eyes shut for a second, pushing the sensations away. This was not meditation. This was a violation of his own privacy, and probably Liam\u2019s too.\n\nWhen Liam returned, he was wearing his work trousers but had put on a clean, grey t-shirt he must have kept in his van. His hair was damp and curled slightly at the ends. He smelled not of soil and petrol, but of Jake\u2019s own unassuming, scent-free soap. The change was subtle but profound. He was no longer a man of the garden, but a guest in the house. The hum at the base of Jake\u2019s skull softened, its anxious edge replaced by something warmer, a low, resonant thrum of approval.\n\n\u201cSmells good,\u201d Liam said, leaning against the doorframe, watching as Jake stirred a fragrant sauce of tomatoes, garlic and herbs.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just pasta,\u201d Jake said, his voice betraying none of the internal chaos he felt.\n\n\u201cNothing \u2018just\u2019 about a good pasta,\u201d Liam countered. \u201cIt\u2019s one of life\u2019s great comforts.\u201d\n\nThey ate at the kitchen table, the same worn pine that had held their morning mugs of tea. The evening light slanted through the window, turning the room gold. For a while, the only sounds were the clink of forks against ceramic and Liam\u2019s appreciative murmurs. The silence wasn\u2019t awkward. It was comfortable, the easy quiet of two people enjoying a meal. Jake found himself relaxing in a way he hadn\u2019t in years. He wasn\u2019t a Jedi in hiding. He wasn\u2019t the last survivor of a failed order. He was just Jake, a man sharing a meal with a man named Liam. It was terrifyingly simple.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got a real talent for this, you know,\u201d Liam said, gesturing to his all-but-empty plate. \u201cThe cooking. Not just the garden.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had a lot of time to practice,\u201d Jake replied, the ambiguity of the statement hanging in the air.\n\nLiam took a sip of water, his gaze steady and curious. It was the same look he\u2019d given the 'leggy' roses. \u201cSo, what did you do? Before you retired here to become a gentleman of leisure?\u201d\n\nThe question was inevitable, and Jake had his answer prepared. It was a thin, flimsy thing, a fabrication of half-truths designed to be as boring as possible. \u201cI was in logistics,\u201d he said, the word tasting like dust in his mouth. \u201cInternational shipping. Lots of spreadsheets, lots of time zones. Very dull. I was glad to give it up.\u201d\n\nHe sent a gentle, soothing pulse out with the words, a tiny Jedi suggestion to accept the answer and move on. It was a cheap trick, one he hated using, but the alternative was a truth he could never speak. Liam, however, seemed entirely unaffected. Or perhaps he simply didn\u2019t need persuading. He just nodded, his interest seemingly genuine.\n\n\u201cLogistics. Right. Must be nice, being your own boss now. Setting your own pace.\u201d He looked around the quiet kitchen. \u201cI get it. My grandad was a trucker. Drove all over Europe. When he retired, he said the best thing in the world was knowing he didn\u2019t have to go anywhere.\u201d\n\nJake\u2019s breath caught in his throat. The casual mention of driving across a continent, of a life spent in motion before finding stillness, was so unnervingly close to his own truth that he felt a jolt, as if he\u2019d touched a live wire. He felt a sudden, powerful urge to tell him everything. To talk about the starlanes instead of the motorways, of hyperspace jumps instead of ferry crossings. To explain that the quiet he sought wasn't from a career of spreadsheets, but from a galaxy of war. But he clamped down on the impulse, burying it deep. That man was dead. He had to stay dead.\n\n\u201cYour grandad sounds like a wise man,\u201d Jake said, his voice quiet.\n\n\u201cHe was a stubborn old sod,\u201d Liam said, grinning. \u201cBut yeah, he had his moments. He\u2019s the one who taught me about gardening. Said you can\u2019t understand the world until you\u2019ve put your hands in the dirt.\u201d Liam looked down at his own hands, resting on the table. The fingernails were clean now, but the lines on his palms were still etched with the memory of soil. \u201cI think he was right.\u201d\n\nJake looked at Liam\u2019s hands, then at his own. His were unscarred, the hands of a man who had wielded light and thought, not shovels and shears. He felt a pang of envy so sharp it was almost painful. Liam hadn\u2019t just found peace; he had cultivated it, grown it from the ground up. Jake had merely hidden in it. In that moment, Jake knew that the quiet, unassuming gardener sitting across from him possessed a kind of wisdom his own Jedi Masters had never taught. It was the wisdom of roots, of seasons, of staying in one place and tending to what was there. The hum in his skull shifted again, becoming a clear, single note. It was no longer anxiety, or even longing. It was recognition.After they finished eating, they cleared the plates together, moving around the small kitchen in an easy, unrehearsed rhythm. For Jake, who had spent decades honing his self-sufficiency to a fine, sharp point, the simple act of someone else washing while he dried was a profound disturbance. It was a partnership, however small and temporary, and it felt more dangerous than any duel. Solitude was his shield, a vast, empty space he had cultivated around himself. Liam\u2019s presence, his quiet competence even at the kitchen sink, was shrinking that space, replacing the sterile silence with a warm, living hum.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s see how it all looks in the evening light,\u201d Liam suggested, drying his hands on a tea towel. \u201cEverything changes when the sun goes down. The colours get deeper.\u201d\n\nJake followed him out of the back door into the gloaming. The air was cool and smelled of dampening earth and the sweet, spicy scent of the pinks lining the path. It was Liam\u2019s domain now. During the day, Jake felt the garden as a network of life force, a frantic, prickly web of needs and ambitions. But as Liam walked him through it, he began to see it through his gardener\u2019s eyes. Liam pointed to the way the silver-leafed artemisia seemed to glow, capturing the last of the light. He nudged a drooping head of an allium with a gentle finger, diagnosing its need for water with a glance. He stopped by the rose bushes he had pruned earlier.\n\n\u201cSee?\u201d Liam murmured, his voice low in the quiet air. \u201cThey look better already. Less\u2026 frantic. Sometimes you\u2019ve got to be a bit cruel to be kind. Helps them focus their energy on the good blooms, instead of wasting it on too many leaves.\u201d\n\nJake stared at the pruned roses. Liam\u2019s words resonated with a painful clarity. *Focus their energy. Stop wasting it.* It was the mantra of the Jedi Order, a lesson drilled into him since he was a boy. Yet here was the same principle, spoken not in a sterile temple hall but in a dusky English garden, applied to a plant. Liam saw it so simply. Jake had spent a lifetime trying to prune his own sprawling, chaotic emotions, and now his feelings for the man standing next to him were threatening to become a thicket of messy, untameable growth.\n\n\u201cMy dad wanted me to go into business with him,\u201d Liam said, his gaze distant, looking over the neat stripes of the lawn. \u201cHe runs a small construction firm. Good money in it. But I hated it. All noise and dust and straight lines. Nothing ever grew.\u201d He shrugged, a simple gesture that held the weight of a life-defining choice. \u201cGrandad left me his old van and his tools when he passed. Seemed like a sign. Some people thought I was mad, choosing this. But I get to make things live. It feels\u2026 real.\u201d\n\nA choice. A simple, personal choice, not one forced by war or prophecy or the grand, sweeping tides of history. Jake felt a hollow ache in his chest. He had never truly chosen his life. He had been chosen by the Force, then he had chosen to run, and then he had chosen to hide. His entire existence was a reaction, a negation. Liam\u2019s life was an affirmation.\n\n\u201cDo you have any family, Jake?\u201d Liam asked, his tone casual, but his eyes, when they turned to Jake, were anything but. They were searching, a quiet, patient inquiry.\n\nThe carefully constructed lie about logistics and spreadsheets felt like ashes in Jake\u2019s mouth. He couldn\u2019t say it again, not here, not now, with the scent of honest soil in the air and the weight of Liam\u2019s genuine curiosity upon him. He looked away, towards the dark shape of the silver birch at the end of the garden, a silent witness to his exile.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said, the single word costing him more than he could have imagined. \u201cNot anymore. I lost them. A long time ago. There was\u2026 a conflict. A political one. Things fell apart very quickly.\u201d The words were ghosts, thin and ethereal, but they held the solid, unbearable mass of his truth. The fall of the Republic, the purge of the Jedi, the slaughter of his friends, his family\u2014all of it compressed into the bland, sterile phrase \u2018a conflict\u2019. The Force around him seemed to tremble, stirred by the sudden release of a grief he had kept locked away for so long.\n\nLiam was silent for a long moment. Jake braced himself for more questions, for pity, for the awkwardness that always followed such a confession. Instead, he felt a sudden warmth on his forearm. He looked down and saw Liam\u2019s hand resting there, his fingers strong and calloused, a stark contrast to the soft cotton of Jake\u2019s jumper. The touch was not one of pity, but of solidarity. It was grounding. An anchor. It didn\u2019t try to fix anything or ask for more. It just\u2026 was. A simple, physical statement: *I am here. You are not alone in this moment.*\n\nThe hum in Jake\u2019s skull, which had been a nervous thrum all day, swelled into a powerful, resonant chord. It was no longer a warning or a song of longing. It was the feeling of a circuit being completed, of two separate points in the universe suddenly, inexplicably, connecting. Through Liam\u2019s hand, Jake could feel the man\u2019s steady heartbeat, the uncomplicated warmth of his blood, the quiet strength that came from a life lived in concert with the earth. It was a connection more profound and more real than any abstract communion with the cosmic Force.\n\nThe moment stretched, timeless. The buzz of a late bee, the distant rumble of a train, the scent of the night\u2014it all faded away, leaving only the two of them standing by the roses and the solid, irrefutable pressure of Liam\u2019s hand on his arm. He had wanted peace, detachment. He had fled across a galaxy to find it. And now he realised, with a terrifying sense of inevitability, that the very thing he had run from\u2014connection, attachment\u2014was the only thing that felt like peace at all.\n\nFinally, as if surfacing from a great depth, Liam slowly drew his hand back. The absence of his touch was a physical shock, a sudden coldness on Jake\u2019s arm. \u201cThat bindweed behind the shed,\u201d Liam said, his voice a little rough. \u201cIt\u2019ll be back next week. It always comes back. You just have to keep at it.\u201d\n\nJake understood he wasn\u2019t just talking about the weeds.\n\nThey walked back to the house in a silence that was fuller and heavier than before. When Liam stood at the door, ready to leave, the air between them was charged. The easy employer-gardener dynamic was gone, replaced by something fragile and unlabelled.\n\n\u201cThank you for dinner, Jake,\u201d Liam said, meeting his eyes. \u201cIt was really good.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you for the\u2026 garden advice,\u201d Jake replied, feeling the inadequacy of the words.\n\nA slow smile touched Liam\u2019s lips. \u201cAnytime.\u201d He paused, his hand on the doorknob. \u201cI\u2019m not working next Saturday. If you felt like cooking again\u2026 or we could get a curry from that place in the village. It\u2019s supposed to be decent.\u201d\n\nThe future. A possible future, offered up as easily as a suggestion for takeaway. The vision he\u2019d had that morning\u2014of the two of them on a bench that didn\u2019t exist yet\u2014flashed in his mind, no longer a fantasy but a tangible possibility, a door swinging open.\n\n\u201cSaturday,\u201d Jake said, his voice steadier than he felt. \u201cSaturday sounds good.\u201d\n\nLiam nodded, his smile widening just a fraction, and then he was gone, the crunch of his footsteps on the gravel fading into the night. Jake closed the door and leaned against it, the cool wood a poor substitute for the warmth of Liam\u2019s hand. He was alone in his quiet house once more, but everything had changed. The silence was no longer a refuge. It was just the space between now and Saturday. The Jedi of Epsom had spent half his life running from attachment. Now, he found himself running directly towards it. The hum was still there, a constant companion at the base of his skull, but for the first time in years, it sounded less like trouble and more like a promise.The days that followed were a study in suspended animation. The house, usually Jake\u2019s sanctuary of quiet routine, became a waiting room. The hum in his head had changed its tune. The anxious thrumming had given way to a low, continuous note of anticipation, a resonant frequency tuned precisely to the idea of \u2018Saturday\u2019. It was distracting. He would sit down to read a history of the Wars of the Roses and find himself staring at the same paragraph for ten minutes, his mind instead tracing the memory of Liam\u2019s hand on his arm. He attempted to meditate, to cast his senses out into the silent, star-dusted void, but his focus was hopelessly terrestrial. The great, flowing river of the Force, which he usually experienced as a galaxy-spanning current, now felt like it had been diverted, its powerful flow channelled into the narrow, specific geography of his own back garden. He could feel the slow, contented sigh of the pruned roses, their energy now directed and purposeful. He could sense the lingering frustration of the defeated bindweed. The garden was no longer just a collection of life-forms; it was a diary of his time with Liam.\n\nHe found himself cleaning with an uncharacteristic fervour. He polished the beeswax-scented furniture until it shone, he washed windows that were already clean, he tidied away books and papers, creating an order that bordered on the monastic. It was a nervous displacement of energy, but it was also something more. He was preparing the space, nesting. It was a primal urge he hadn\u2019t felt since he\u2019d first established this refuge, and he recognised it with a sense of detached alarm. The fortress was lowering its drawbridge. He was sweeping the courtyard for a welcome guest, not shoring up the walls against an intruder. The Jedi of Epsom was behaving less like a stoic guardian of a forgotten faith and more like a teenager expecting his first date. The thought was so absurd it made him laugh out loud in the empty hallway, a short, sharp sound that was quickly swallowed by the silence.\n\nThe most unnerving development was his own use of the Force. He\u2019d always been disciplined, using it only for the most essential tasks: maintaining the low-level perception filter that kept him anonymous, enhancing his gardening, or for the deep meditative states that kept his soul from fraying. But now, he caught himself in small, idle abuses of his power. He\u2019d be washing dishes and find himself idly levitating the cutlery to the drying rack. He\u2019d feel a sudden, sharp curiosity and almost, *almost*, cast his senses across the town to see what Liam was doing, pulling back at the last second with a jolt of shame. It was a gross violation of privacy, a temptation he hadn't faced in years. The Force was a tool for insight, not for cosmic stalking. This emotional entanglement was making him sloppy, undisciplined. The old warnings echoed in his mind\u2014*fear, anger, hate*\u2014but the litany felt hollow. The feeling that drove him wasn\u2019t fear, it was a terrifying, exhilarating hope.\n\nOn Saturday morning, the hum was a palpable vibration, a physical presence in the room. It was the colour of a clear blue sky, the taste of ozone before a summer storm. Jake stood in front of his wardrobe, utterly adrift. His clothes were a uniform of invisibility: soft grey jumpers, dark, nondescript trousers, faded blue shirts. They were the colours of shadow and anonymity. He had spent decades learning how to not be seen. Now, for the first time, he wanted to be seen, truly seen, by one specific person, and he had no idea how to dress for the occasion. He eventually settled on a dark green linen shirt he\u2019d bought on a rare trip into town and forgotten about. It felt strange, the fabric crisper, the colour more definite than his usual attire. It felt like a statement. He wasn't sure what the statement was, but he was making it.\n\nHe spent the afternoon in a state of low-grade panic, culminating in him standing in the kitchen at six o\u2019clock, staring at the phone number for the curry house as if it were a complex stellar chart. The act of making the call felt like launching a starship. When a cheerful voice answered on the other end, he almost hung up. He managed to place the order\u2014one chicken korma, one lamb bhuna, pilau rice, and a peshwari naan, a selection he\u2019d made after a ridiculous amount of internal debate\u2014his voice sounding unnaturally formal. The entire exchange left him feeling as drained as if he\u2019d just negotiated a ceasefire.\n\nHe heard the crunch of tyres on the gravel drive at precisely seven. It was a different sound from the Transit van\u2019s utilitarian rumble. Softer, lighter. He looked out of the living room window and saw a dark blue, slightly battered hatchback he\u2019d never seen before. Liam got out. He wasn't wearing his work clothes. He was in dark jeans and a simple, well-fitting blue shirt that made the brown of his arms look richer. He looked younger without the patina of soil and sweat, and somehow more solid. He was carrying a bottle of wine. The sight was so utterly, disarmingly normal that Jake\u2019s heart gave a painful lurch. This was real. This was happening. The hum in his skull crescendoed, a bright, clear bell marking the moment of arrival.\n\nWhen Jake opened the door, Liam smiled, and the slight nervousness Jake saw in his eyes was so reassuring it almost made him dizzy. He wasn\u2019t the only one stepping onto new ground.\n\n\u201cEvening,\u201d Liam said, holding up the bottle. \u201cI brought wine. I\u2019ve no idea if it\u2019s any good. The label had a bird on it. I like birds.\u201d\n\nJake took the bottle, his fingers brushing Liam\u2019s. A spark, bright and warm, shot up his arm. \u201cA bird is an excellent reason to choose a wine,\u201d he said, his own smile feeling more natural than it had all week. \u201cCome in. I\u2019ve ordered from the place in the village. They said about half an hour.\u201d\n\nThe house seemed to embrace Liam\u2019s presence. He looked around the tidy living room, his eyes taking in the shelves of books, the worn armchair, the lack of a television. \u201cIt\u2019s a lovely room,\u201d he said. \u201cProper peaceful.\u201d\n\nPeaceful. The word he had chased across the galaxy, and here it was, being offered back to him by his gardener, who had no idea of the irony. Jake busied himself opening the wine, the familiar ritual a comfort. He poured them both a glass, the pale gold liquid catching the evening light. They stood in the kitchen, not quite knowing where to put themselves. The space that had been so functional and familiar was now a stage.\n\n\u201cSo,\u201d Liam began, leaning back against the counter, \u201cno lawn to mow today. What does the gentleman of leisure do on his days off?\u201d\n\nJake took a sip of wine. It was crisp and dry. \u201cA lot of reading,\u201d he said, gesturing vaguely towards the living room. \u201cAnd I potter. I\u2019m not as skilled as you, but I try to keep the weeds from staging a full-scale rebellion between your visits.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen you,\u201d Liam said, a gentle tease in his voice. \u201cWatching the roses. You look like you\u2019re having a very serious conversation with them.\u201d\n\nJake\u2019s breath hitched. He did have conversations with them, in a way. He felt their thirst, their diseases, their slow, determined reach for the sun. \u201cThey\u2019re very demanding,\u201d he managed, hoping it sounded like a joke.\n\nLiam\u2019s smile softened. He looked at Jake, his gaze direct and unnervingly perceptive. \u201cYou\u2019re a very quiet bloke, Jake. You\u2019ve got this\u2026 stillness about you. Like you\u2019re listening for something no one else can hear.\u201d\n\nThe hum in Jake\u2019s head flared, a sudden, sharp spike of alarm. He was being seen. He was being read. The anonymity he had cultivated for so long was as flimsy as a cobweb. Liam wasn\u2019t just looking at him; he was perceiving him, with an intuition that had nothing to do with the Force and everything to do with the quiet, empathetic wisdom of a man who understood living things. Jake took another, larger sip of wine, the cold liquid doing little to quell the heat rising in his chest. This was far more dangerous than any distant starship battle. This was a close-quarters engagement, and all his defences were starting to fail.Before Jake could formulate a response, to either confirm or deny this terrifyingly accurate assessment, a chime echoed through the house. The doorbell. He had never been so grateful for an interruption in his entire, long life. It was a reprieve, a deus ex machina in the form of a takeaway delivery driver.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019ll be dinner,\u201d he said, his voice emerging steadier than he felt. He placed his wine glass on the counter with exaggerated care and moved towards the hall, the short walk a welcome chance to reassemble his shattered composure. He paid the driver, the mundane transaction of exchanging cash for a fragrant paper bag feeling surreal. He was a man who had faced down Sith Lords, and he was currently being saved from a conversation by a chicken korma.\n\nWhen he returned to the kitchen, Liam hadn't moved, but the intensity in his gaze had softened. He watched as Jake unpacked the foil containers onto the counter, the steam that puffed out releasing a rich cloud of spice, coconut, and tomato that instantly filled the room. The scent was warm, complex, and deeply comforting. It smelled of life, of a world that continued turning, blissfully unaware of Jedi or lost Republics.\n\n\u201cRight, let\u2019s see what we\u2019ve got,\u201d Liam said, his voice back to its easy, affable tone. He peered at the containers. \u201cIs that a bhuna? Good man. You can\u2019t trust someone who doesn\u2019t like a bit of spice.\u201d\n\nThey transferred the food to plates, moving around each other in the small space with an easy, unforced grace. The tension had been broken, but its ghost remained. The question Liam had asked still hung in the air, unanswered, absorbed into the spicy steam and the golden light of the kitchen. They carried their plates back to the worn pine table, the setting for all their pivotal moments, and for a few minutes, they simply ate. The curry was good, the flavours bold and distinct. Jake found himself eating with a genuine appetite, the warmth of the food a welcome counterpoint to the nervous chill that had settled deep in his bones.\n\n\u201cThis is worlds better than my usual Saturday night takeaway,\u201d Liam said after a while, scooping up a piece of lamb with a shard of naan bread. \u201cWhich is usually a pizza I eat out of the box while watching old episodes of Time Team.\u201d\n\nJake smiled, a genuine, relaxed smile this time. The image was so perfectly, wonderfully mundane. \u201cI\u2019m guessing you\u2019re a fan of digging.\u201d\n\n\u201cObsessed,\u201d Liam admitted without a trace of embarrassment. \u201cAlways have been. It\u2019s the same as gardening, really. Just a different timescale. Trying to understand a place by what\u2019s buried underneath. Reading the story in the soil.\u201d He paused, his expression turning thoughtful. \u201cI nearly went to university to study archaeology. But my dad\u2026 he had other ideas. The construction business. Said there was no money in digging up old pots.\u201d\n\nThe familiar story, the one he\u2019d alluded to in the garden, returned with more detail, more weight. The conflict between a parent's practical ambition and a child\u2019s deeper calling. It was a tale as old as time, played out in a million different ways across a million different worlds. Jake had seen it end in feuds that sundered families, and in rebellions that toppled planetary governments. Here, in Epsom, it had ended with Liam choosing a life of soil and quiet satisfaction over his father\u2019s world of concrete and commerce.\n\n\u201cHe wasn\u2019t wrong about the money,\u201d Liam continued with a wry grin. \u201cBut he was wrong about everything else. I spent six months on a building site with him after I left school. It was the loudest, most miserable time of my life. Everything was about destroying what was there to make way for something new. No patience. No listening.\u201d He looked up from his plate and met Jake\u2019s eyes, and Jake knew the word was deliberate. \u201cI\u2019d rather spend a day figuring out why a rose is unhappy than lay a hundred perfect bricks.\u201d\n\nThe hum returned, a deep, cello-string thrum of profound empathy. Jake felt an overwhelming urge to reach across the table, to place his hand over Liam\u2019s, to say *I understand*. The Jedi had been builders, of a sort. They had built peace, built alliances, built an Order on millennia of tradition. And he had watched it all get torn down, replaced by something loud and brutal and impatient. He felt a kinship with this man that went far beyond a shared appreciation for a well-tended garden. Liam hadn't just chosen a different career path; he had chosen a different philosophy, a way of being that Jake recognised as a fundamental truth.\n\n\u201cIt takes a certain kind of courage,\u201d Jake said, his voice low and earnest, \u201cto choose to listen instead of shout.\u201d\n\nLiam\u2019s gaze softened, a flicker of surprise in his eyes at the gravity of Jake\u2019s tone. He seemed to understand that Jake wasn\u2019t just making a casual observation. He was affirming Liam\u2019s entire life, the very core of his identity. He held Jake\u2019s gaze for a long moment, the space between them shrinking until the kitchen, the house, the entire world outside seemed to fall away, leaving only the two of them at the table, surrounded by the scent of spice and a shared, unspoken understanding.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Liam said finally, his voice slightly hoarse. \u201cWell. It\u2019s a quieter life, anyway.\u201d He tore off another piece of bread, but didn\u2019t eat it, just rolled it between his fingers. \u201cSo, your logistics job. All that international shipping. You must have seen a lot of places.\u201d The question was a gentle probe, an invitation for Jake to share a piece of his own story, to reciprocate the honesty he had been given. \u201cAny favourites?\u201dThe question, innocent as it was, landed with the weight of a tribunal. *Any favourites?* It was a simple inquiry, a standard piece of get-to-know-you conversation, but for Jake it was a demand for a past he didn\u2019t have. His fabricated career in logistics was a flimsy stage flat, and Liam was asking to see what was behind it. He could name a city\u2014Singapore, perhaps, or Hamburg\u2014and invent a few plausible details about container ports and bustling markets. The Jedi training had included infiltration and deception; he was more than capable of crafting a convincing lie. But the words wouldn't come. To lie now, after Liam had so openly shared the story of his own quiet rebellion, felt like a profound disrespect. It felt like putting a weed back in the soil he\u2019d just so carefully cleared.\n\nHe took a slow breath, letting the wine rest on his tongue. The hum in his head was a low, insistent thrum, urging him not to retreat, not to close the door he had so tentatively opened. He decided to walk a tightrope. He would tell the truth, but he would speak it in a language Liam might understand, a language of feeling and landscape, stripped of its alien names and impossible context. He set his glass down and looked not at Liam, but at the darkening window, as if seeing the reflection of his memories there.\n\n\u201cThere was one place,\u201d he began, his voice softer than before, \u201ca city built in the mountains. The peaks were so high they scraped a sky that wasn't quite blue, more of a soft violet. The buildings weren't built on the land so much as with it. They followed the curve of the canyons, nestled into the cliffsides like swallows' nests made of white stone and glass. There was a university there, a place of quiet learning. The air\u2026 it always tasted clean, like cold water.\u201d He paused, the ghost of Alderaan a sharp, beautiful ache in his memory. \u201cIt was beautiful. Orderly. It felt like what peace was supposed to look like.\u201d\n\nHe shifted his gaze, another memory rising, darker and more overwhelming. \u201cBut most of my time was spent at the central hub. A city that covered an entire world. There was no day or night, just a constant, managed twilight. Traffic moved in rivers of light, stacked a hundred levels deep. You could live your whole life there and never see the ground, never feel rain on your skin. The sound was\u2026 constant. Not loud, just a perpetual hum. The combined energy of a trillion lives, all moving, all wanting something. You were never alone, but you were lonelier than you could ever imagine. It was the colour of ambition, and it tasted like metal.\u201d\n\nHe fell silent, the memories receding, leaving him back at the pine table in his quiet Surrey kitchen. He had said too much. The descriptions were too strange, too poetic for a man who supposedly dealt in shipping manifests. He had revealed the edges of his alien past, and he waited for Liam to pull away, to ask the questions he couldn't possibly answer. He risked a glance at him. Liam was perfectly still, his fork resting on his plate, his curry forgotten. He wasn\u2019t looking at Jake with confusion, but with a startling, intense empathy. He hadn\u2019t heard the words of a logistics manager; he had heard the confession of a refugee.\n\n\u201cAfter a while,\u201d Jake finished, his voice barely a whisper, \u201cI just wanted to see the same sky every day. I wanted to know a piece of ground so well that I could feel when it was thirsty. I wanted to hear silence.\u201d He gestured vaguely around the room, at the quiet house, the dark garden beyond the glass. \u201cThis is the opposite of all that. It\u2019s small, and it\u2019s real. That\u2019s all I wanted.\u201d\n\nLiam let out a slow breath, the sound loud in the quiet room. He picked up his wine glass, turning it in his hands, watching the light play in the liquid. He didn\u2019t ask where these impossible cities were. He didn\u2019t question the strangeness of the descriptions. He accepted the emotional truth of the story as if it were the most natural thing in the world. He understood the story of a man who had seen too much and had come seeking a place to heal.\n\n\u201cSounds like you earned your quiet,\u201d Liam said finally. His voice was gentle, and it held a universe of acceptance. He looked up and met Jake\u2019s eyes, and in their depths, Jake saw no suspicion, only a profound, heart-stopping understanding. \u201cNo wonder you talk to the roses. You\u2019re probably just glad they don\u2019t talk back.\u201d\n\nA small laugh escaped Jake\u2019s lips, a sound of pure, unadulterated relief. It felt as if a heavy cloak he hadn\u2019t even realised he was wearing had just slipped from his shoulders. He hadn't been exposed; he had been seen. And he hadn't been judged. Liam\u2019s simple, intuitive grasp of his story was a greater gift than he could have imagined. The hum at the base of his skull resolved into a single, warm, steady note of pure contentment. It was the colour of peace, after all. But it was no longer the pale, watery green of solitude. It was the deep, rich gold of the wine in their glasses, of the light in the kitchen, of a shared and welcome silence.The silence that greeted Jake on Sunday morning was a different creature entirely. Before, silence had been a defensive wall, a vast emptiness he patrolled to ensure no echoes of his past could find purchase. Now, it was an echo chamber of a different sort. It held the ghost of Liam\u2019s laughter, the lingering scent of spices in the air, the sight of the empty wine bottle standing sentinel on the counter like a small, glass trophy. He had broken the most fundamental rule of his exile, the cardinal tenet of the Jedi Order itself, and the sky had not fallen. The Force had not recoiled in horror. Instead, the world seemed to have shifted into a higher resolution, the watery green light of the garden more vibrant, the birdsong in the silver birch more intricate. The hum was still there, a soft, unwavering note at the base of his skull, but its character was transformed. It was no longer the colour of trouble or anxiety; it was the colour of a quiet, sunlit room, the colour of a future he had never dared to imagine.\n\nHe spent the day in a state of suspended bliss, a feeling so alien he kept examining it for traps. He walked through the garden, his fingers brushing the leaves of the David Austin roses, and felt not just their life force but the memory of Liam\u2019s hands tending to them. The garden was no longer just his refuge; it was a shared space, a living testament to their nascent connection. The Jedi litanies, however, were persistent ghosts. *Attachment leads to fear.* The words coiled in the back of his mind, a conditioned response honed over a lifetime. He paused, his hand on a pruned rose stem, and honestly examined his own heart. Was he afraid? A profound, bone-deep terror bloomed in his chest. But it was not the cold, possessive fear of loss the Jedi Masters had warned against. It was not the fear of what losing Liam would do to *him*. It was the warm, terrifying, fiercely protective fear of anything ever happening to Liam at all. It was a selfless fear, an outward-facing concern, and he wondered, with a jolt that shook him, if the old masters, in their wisdom, had gotten it wrong. Perhaps they had mistaken the symptom for the disease. Perhaps the problem wasn't attachment itself, but the selfishness that so often poisoned it.\n\nBy Tuesday morning, the gentle hum of contentment had modulated into a bright, eager thrum of anticipation. The familiar rumble of the white Ford Transit turning onto his street was no longer just a sound; it was the opening note of a symphony. Jake filled the kettle, his movements economical as always, but his heart was a frantic, joyful drum against his ribs. He felt Liam\u2019s presence through the Force, not as a vague convergence, but as a distinct, cherished signature. He sensed the familiar furrow of concentration on Liam\u2019s brow as he unlatched the van, the satisfying heft of a tool in his capable hands, the simple, earthy peace that surrounded him like an aura. Jake no longer felt like a man out of place, but a man waiting for the other half of a landscape to arrive.\n\n\u201cMorning,\u201d Liam called through the open window, and the single word was imbued with all the warmth and understanding of their Saturday dinner. There was a new intimacy in his smile, a private knowledge that passed between them, rendering the suburban morning scene suddenly sacred. He came inside, wiping his boots on the mat, and the kitchen seemed to shrink, to become more concentrated and real around him. Jake handed him the mug of tea\u2014strong, milky, two sugars\u2014and their fingers brushed. The contact was brief, accidental, but it sent a jolt of pure energy through Jake, bright and clean as a lightsaber\u2019s beam.\n\n\u201cThe lawn can wait a bit,\u201d Liam said, taking a sip of his tea and leaning against the counter. He didn\u2019t look out at the garden as he usually did. He looked at Jake. \u201cSaturday was\u2026 good. I enjoyed it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI did too,\u201d Jake replied, his voice quiet but firm. \u201cMore than I can say.\u201d The confession hung in the air, a small, brave flag planted in this new territory. He watched as Liam processed it, saw the slight softening of his shoulders, the gentle curve of his lips.\n\n\u201cYour stories,\u201d Liam said, his voice dropping a little. \u201cThe city that was all metal and ambition. I think my dad would have liked a place like that.\u201d There was no judgment in his tone, only a quiet musing, a connecting of the dots between their two very different worlds. \u201cI\u2019m glad you found your quiet corner here instead.\u201d He took another fortifying gulp of tea, then placed the mug on the counter with a soft click. \u201cRight. I should probably make a start. Those cheeky weeds won\u2019t pull themselves.\u201d\n\nHe turned to go, and Jake felt a sudden, sharp pang of loss at the thought of the moment ending. The old, cautious Jake would have let him go, retreating back into the safety of distance. The new Jake, the one who had shared a curry and a truth, stepped forward. \u201cLiam,\u201d he said, the name a tangible thing in the quiet kitchen. Liam paused at the door, turning back. \u201cThat vision I had,\u201d Jake began, the word \u2018vision\u2019 feeling both ridiculously grandiose and perfectly accurate. \u201cThe one of the garden, years from now. With the bench.\u201d\n\nLiam\u2019s expression was unreadable for a moment, a flicker of surprise followed by a dawning awareness. He had shared a vision, a fantasy, and was laying it at Liam\u2019s feet, making it real. A slow, wonderful smile spread across Liam\u2019s face, crinkling the corners of his eyes. He didn't question it. He didn't ask for an explanation. He simply stepped back into the kitchen and walked to the window, looking out at the garden with a new, speculative eye.\n\n\u201cThe silver birch,\u201d Liam said, his voice full of a sudden, thoughtful authority, as if they were discussing a real architectural plan. He pointed with his chin towards the bottom of the garden. \u201cYou\u2019d want it there. Just to the left of the birch. It\u2019d catch the last of the evening sun in the summer, but it would be sheltered from the wind. It\u2019s the best spot in the whole garden.\u201d He turned back to Jake, his eyes shining with a mixture of amusement and something far deeper, something that looked unmistakably like affection. \u201cWe\u2019d need to build a proper stone base for it, though. Make sure it\u2019s level. Make sure it lasts.\u201dLiam\u2019s words landed in the quiet kitchen not as a suggestion, but as a statement of fact. A plan already in motion. For a man who had spent decades living in the ephemeral realms of visions and premonitions, the sheer, solid practicality of Liam\u2019s response was a revelation. The Force could show you a thousand possible futures, shimmering and uncertain as heat haze, but it took a man with soil under his fingernails to point to a spot on the lawn and say, *here*. It was the most romantic thing Jake had ever heard. The hum in his skull, the lifelong companion he had learned to interpret as a barometer of cosmic events, settled into a mode he had never before experienced: purpose. It was no longer a signal to be deciphered or a warning to be heeded; it was the quiet, powerful thrum of an engine that had just been engaged.\n\nThe rest of that Tuesday morning was lost to the most exciting logistical planning of Jake\u2019s terrestrial life. The lawn was forgotten, the weeds granted a temporary reprieve. Instead, they sat at the kitchen table, the half-empty mugs of tea pushed to one side, while Liam sketched on the back of a discarded seed packet. His pencil, thick and stubby, moved with a surprising deftness, transforming the flimsy paper into a blueprint. He spoke of mortise and tenon joints, of the virtues of oak for its strength and longevity versus teak for its natural oils and resistance to the damp English climate. He talked about the angle of the backrest, the gentle curve needed to make it comfortable for hours of sitting, the ideal height from the ground. Jake listened, utterly captivated. He had once sat in council chambers where the fates of star systems were debated, but none of it had ever felt as real or as vital as this. His own contributions were less practical, more atmospheric. \u201cIt should feel like it grew here,\u201d he\u2019d said, and Liam, without looking up from his drawing, had simply nodded. \u201cI know what you mean. Not something plonked down. Something that belongs.\u201d\n\nThe project took on a life of its own, a third presence in their burgeoning relationship. It became the reason for phone calls that stretched beyond scheduling lawn maintenance, and for a trip the following Saturday, not to the curry house, but to a sprawling reclamation yard a few towns over. The yard was a chaotic boneyard of architecture, a jumble of forgotten histories. There were stacks of weathered roof tiles, forests of spindly iron railings, and rows of stone-mullioned windows staring out like sightless eyes. To Jake, it was a cacophony in the Force, each object humming with the faint, residual echoes of the lives it had witnessed. He could feel the warmth of a hundred summer evenings in a set of old terracotta pots, the faint, lingering arguments that had taken place in front of a marble fireplace, the childish joy of a game of hide-and-seek played around a stone birdbath. It was overwhelming, a library of emotions with no catalogue.\n\nLiam, however, navigated the chaos with the calm assurance of a librarian in his own domain. He was not sensing the past; he was looking for potential. He ran his capable hands over piles of gritstone and Yorkstone flags, judging their texture, their thickness, their character. \u201cYou don\u2019t want anything too new or perfect,\u201d he explained, rejecting a pallet of pristine, machine-cut pavers. \u201cYou want something that already knows how to be still. Something that\u2019s felt a bit of weather.\u201d He finally settled on a small stack of flagstones, their surfaces worn smooth by a century of footsteps, their edges softened by rain and frost. A faint tracery of moss was etched into the grain of one, a delicate, living map. As they loaded the heavy stones into the back of Liam\u2019s hatchback, Jake felt their solid, steady presence through the Force\u2014a quiet, grounding energy. They were not just building materials; they were anchors, chosen together to hold their shared future to the earth.\n\nThe real work began the next weekend. The sun was a soft, forgiving gold in a hazy sky as Liam marked out a perfect rectangle on the lawn with string and pegs. He stripped away the turf with a sharp spade, revealing the dark, rich soil beneath. He worked with a fluid, economical rhythm that was mesmerising to watch, a dialogue between muscle and earth. Jake, feeling large and clumsy in comparison, stood by with a wheelbarrow, his own purpose unclear. He had commanded troops, faced down assassins, and channelled the energy of a star, but he had no idea how to be useful in the face of honest manual labour. \u201cRight then,\u201d Liam said, straightening up with a grin, sweat beading on his brow. \u201cYour turn. Let\u2019s see what all that book-reading has done for your back.\u201d\n\nHe passed Jake the spade, and Jake took it, the smooth, worn wood of the handle unfamiliar in his grasp. His first few attempts were awkward, jarring his shoulders, the blade skittering off the compacted earth. Liam didn\u2019t laugh. He came and stood behind Jake, his body close, his hand closing over Jake\u2019s on the handle. \u201cDon\u2019t fight it,\u201d he said, his voice a low rumble near Jake\u2019s ear. \u201cUse your weight. Let the tool do the work.\u201d He guided Jake through the motion\u2014the press of the foot, the lean of the body, the satisfying slice as the spade sank into the soil. The warmth of Liam\u2019s body, the solid presence of his hand, the simple, patient instruction\u2014it was an intimacy more profound than any kiss. In that moment, Jake was not an exiled Jedi Master; he was just a man, learning a new way to interact with the world from someone he was beginning to love.\n\nAs the day wore on, Jake found his own way to contribute. While Liam, on his knees, began to mix sand and cement in the wheelbarrow, a task he performed with the focused intensity of an alchemist, Jake was tasked with moving the heavy flagstones into position. He stooped to lift the first one, feeling its true, back-straining weight. Then, glancing to make sure Liam was preoccupied, he closed his eyes for a fraction of a second. He didn't think, he just *reached*. He extended a thread of the Force, wrapping it around the stone, not to levitate it, but simply to lighten it, to take the burden of its inertia from his own muscles. He lifted it with an ease that felt like cheating, carrying it over to the excavated rectangle and lowering it gently into place. \u201cBlimey, you\u2019re stronger than you look,\u201d Liam commented without turning around, mistaking Jake\u2019s cosmic assistance for simple physical strength. A thrill, sharp and bright, shot through Jake. It was a secret act of partnership, a small, hidden use of his old life in service of his new one. He was using the Force not to move starships, but to build a foundation for a garden bench, and it felt more significant than any battle he had ever fought.\n\nThey worked in a comfortable, productive silence, punctuated by the scrape of the trowel and the soft thud of stone settling into place. At one point, kneeling side-by-side to check the level, their shoulders brushed. The contact was brief, but the world seemed to narrow to that single point, a conduit for a current of warmth and unspoken affection that flowed between them. They were smudged with dirt, tired, their muscles aching, but as Jake looked at Liam\u2019s focused profile, the smudge of cement on his cheek, the determination in his eyes, the hum in his head became a quiet, perfect chord of rightness. This, he thought. This is what it means to build something. Not a Republic, not an Order, but something small and solid and real. Something that would last.The sun had bled into a soft, bruised purple at the horizon by the time the last stone was settled. They were filthy, streaked with sweat and cement dust, and every one of Jake\u2019s muscles, particularly the ones he hadn\u2019t used in thirty years, sang a low, aching protest. They sat on the back step, side-by-side, their shoulders not quite touching, nursing tall glasses of cold water that Jake had fetched from the kitchen. The new stone plinth at the bottom of the garden was a dark, solid rectangle in the gloaming, a patch of absolute certainty on the fading lawn. It was, Jake thought, the most beautiful thing he had ever helped to create. He had once helped broker the treaty that shaped the Outer Rim trade lanes, a delicate, complex web of diplomacy that had brought peace for a generation. It had been shattered and forgotten in less than a year. This small, stone foundation felt infinitely more permanent.\n\nLiam let out a long, weary sigh of satisfaction, stretching his legs out in front of him. \u201cGood day\u2019s work,\u201d he murmured, his voice rough with tiredness. He glanced sideways at Jake, a tired but genuine smile on his face. \u201cYou\u2019re not bad with a spade, for a logistics man. We\u2019ll make a proper gardener of you yet.\u201d Jake just smiled, a real, unguarded smile that reached his eyes. He felt a profound sense of pride in his aching back and his dirt-caked hands. He had participated. He had not just observed or nudged things with an invisible power; he had put his own physical self into the world, and the world had pushed back. The exchange felt more honest than any conversation he had ever had.\n\nThe next stage of the project required a different kind of expertise. The following week, Liam drove them to a timber yard tucked away in the folds of the Surrey Hills. It was a vast, cavernous place that smelled overwhelmingly of resin, sawdust, and time. Huge, rough-sawn trunks were stacked like fallen gods in one corner, while in the main building, planks of wood from all over the world were racked in towering aisles. Jake felt the Force here not as a clamour of human emotion, but as a deep, slow, sonorous hum of organic life, arrested and waiting. He could feel the memory of sunlight in a plank of pale ash, the patient, century-long thirst of a great oak, the hurried, jungle-drenched growth of a piece of teak. He ran his hand over a slab of dark, dense wood, and the Force gave him a fleeting, dizzying impression of deep, slow-moving rivers, of chattering, unseen creatures, of a heat so profound it was almost a liquid. He pulled his hand back as if burned.\n\nLiam, meanwhile, was in his element. He moved through the aisles with a reverence that bordered on religious, his hands stroking the wood, his eyes reading the intricate patterns of the grain as if they were maps. He explained to Jake the difference between quarter-sawn and plain-sawn oak, the way the grain would affect not just the look of the bench, but its strength, its resistance to warping over the years. He was not just choosing lumber; he was selecting a collaborator, a piece of ancient, living history that would agree to become a part of their small future. \u201cThis one,\u201d he said finally, his hand resting on a stack of thick, honey-coloured oak planks. They were heavy, dense, and smelled faintly of vanilla and earth. \u201cIt\u2019s English oak. Grown slow, so the grain\u2019s tight. It\u2019s got character.\u201d He traced a dark, swirling knot in the wood with his finger. \u201cIt\u2019s lived a life. It\u2019ll know how to sit still in a garden.\u201d\n\nJake\u2019s garden shed, once a place of solitary pottering, became their workshop. The familiar scent of oil, petrol, and stored fertiliser was soon overlaid with the sharp, clean fragrance of freshly sawn oak. Liam brought his own tools, instruments of a quality and precision that spoke of a deep respect for his craft. They were a world away from the mass-produced implements of a galactic army; each chisel, each plane, each handsaw was perfectly balanced, its wooden handle worn smooth and dark with years of use, shaped to the curve of his hand. They worked mostly in the evenings and on the weekend, the quiet industry of their labour becoming the new rhythm of Jake\u2019s life. The rasp of a saw cutting through timber, the whisper of a hand-plane shaving off a perfect, paper-thin curl of wood, the gentle tap of a mallet on a chisel\u2014these sounds became more comforting to Jake than any temple chant.\n\nThey fell into a natural division of labour. Liam, the master craftsman, would perform the intricate work of cutting the joints, his focus absolute, his movements a study in contained force and precision. Jake became his apprentice, tasked with sanding the cut pieces, his hands learning the changing texture of the wood as he worked it from rough-sawn coarseness to a surface as smooth and lustrous as silk. As he worked, rubbing the sandpaper back and forth along the grain, he found a meditative rhythm. He could feel the life in the wood beneath his fingers, a slow, deep pulse. And he could feel Liam, a steady, warm presence just a few feet away. He didn't need the Force to know where the man was, to sense his mood from the pressure of his plane or the cadence of his breathing. The shed, once a fortress of solitude, had become the most populated, most alive place in his world.\n\nOne evening, as the light outside began to fail, they paused in their work. Liam was running a cloth over a newly-cut tenon, his expression one of deep concentration. \u201cIt\u2019s funny,\u201d he said, not looking up. \u201cMy dad\u2019s still on at me. Says I\u2019m wasting my life making garden furniture when I could be project managing a new build. Says I should be building things that scrape the sky.\u201d He finally looked at Jake, a wry, searching look in his eyes. \u201cYou talked about that city\u2026 the one that was all metal and ambition. I get the feeling you spent a lot of time in places like that. Trying to hold it all together.\u201d\n\nThe perception, as always, was so accurate it stole Jake\u2019s breath. He stopped his sanding, the silence in the shed suddenly deep and profound. He looked at the piece of smooth, warm oak in his hands. \u201cI did,\u201d he admitted, his voice quiet. \u201cMy work\u2026 it was about maintenance. Trying to repair a structure that was fundamentally unsound. It was very large, very old, and very important to a lot of people. But the foundations were rotten. We spent all our time fixing the cracks on the surface, polishing the facade, but we were too afraid to look at what was happening underneath.\u201d He took a breath, the confession feeling like a pressure valve being released. \u201cIn the end, it all came down. It wasn't a gentle decline. It was a collapse. Fast, and brutal. I learned that some things, no matter how much you love them, cannot be saved. You can only save yourself.\u201d\n\nHe had never spoken of it so plainly. He looked at Liam, expecting to see confusion, but instead saw only quiet, compassionate recognition. Liam put down the joint he was working on and wiped his hands on a rag. \u201cSounds like dry rot,\u201d he said, his voice soft. \u201cYou can patch it, you can paint over it, but if it\u2019s in the main beams, the whole house is compromised. Sometimes the only thing to do is pull it down and start again. Or walk away and build something smaller. Something you can trust. Something with a solid foundation.\u201d He gestured with his head towards the garden, where their stone plinth sat waiting. The metaphor was so simple, so perfect, it brought a lump to Jake\u2019s throat. Liam didn't need to know about Republics or Sith Lords. He understood dry rot. He understood foundations. He understood everything that mattered.\n\nThe day they finished it, the sky was a high, brilliant blue. The bench was a masterpiece. Liam had assembled it with a craftsman\u2019s love, the joints so tight they seemed to have grown that way, the long, elegant sweep of the back and arms a perfect invitation. It was heavy, a solid, tangible piece of their shared effort. Together, they carried it from the shed, Jake taking his end with no need for any secret assistance from the Force. He wanted to feel its full weight, the honest burden of its reality. They manoeuvred it through the back door and across the lawn to the waiting plinth. It settled onto the stones with a soft, definitive thud, as if it were breathing out, finally home.\n\nThey stood back, side-by-side, and looked at it. It was perfect. It sat as if it had been there for a hundred years, the warm, honey-coloured oak glowing in the afternoon sun, the dark green of the garden a perfect frame around it. It looked like it belonged. It looked like peace. \u201cWe did it,\u201d Liam said, his voice quiet, filled with a pride that was mirrored in Jake\u2019s own chest. He turned to Jake, and the tired, triumphant smile on his face was the most beautiful thing Jake had ever seen. The sounds of the neighbourhood, a distant lawnmower, the cry of a child, all of it faded away. The universe shrank to the space between them, charged and silent. The hum in Jake\u2019s head, the constant companion of his long, lonely life, finally, for the first time he could remember, went completely still. It was replaced by a silence so profound, so full of presence, it was a physical thing.\n\n\u201cThank you, Liam,\u201d Jake said, his voice thick with an emotion he made no attempt to hide. \u201cNot just for this. For\u2026 all of it.\u201d Liam\u2019s smile softened. He took a half-step closer, his gaze dropping to Jake\u2019s lips for a fraction of a second before meeting his eyes again. The question was there, clear and hopeful. Jake closed the remaining distance between them and gently, with a reverence born of long-suppressed hope, he pressed his lips to Liam\u2019s. It was not a kiss of frantic passion or desperate need. It was a kiss of recognition, of arrival. It was soft and sure and tasted of sawdust, sunshine, and the undeniable truth of a thing that was built to last. It was, in every sense of the word, a homecoming.The kiss ended not with a sudden break, but a slow, reluctant easing of pressure. Their foreheads came to rest against each other, and they stayed there for a long moment, breathing in the same small pocket of air that smelled of sawdust, sweat, and the sharp, green scent of the bruised lawn. Jake kept his eyes closed, mapping this new reality by its immediate sensations: the faint, pleasant rasp of Liam\u2019s stubble against his skin, the solid warmth of the hands that had come up to gently cup his face, the quiet, steady beat of another heart that he could feel as a faint vibration through their point of contact. The silence in his own head was so complete, so absolute, that the gentle sounds of the garden\u2014the rustle of a leaf in the breeze, the chirp of a sparrow settling for the night\u2014seemed amplified, each one a perfect, distinct note in a world that had suddenly come into focus.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d Liam murmured, his voice a low, warm rumble that vibrated through Jake\u2019s bones. \u201cThat was worth waiting for.\u201d He pulled back just enough to look at Jake, his brown eyes clear and serious, though the corners were crinkled with a smile. There was no awkwardness, no uncertainty. In his gaze was the same calm, matter-of-fact certainty with which he had diagnosed a case of black spot or chosen a piece of timber. He saw a thing that was true, and he acknowledged it. Then, his gaze shifted past Jake, towards their handiwork. \u201cShall we?\u201d he asked, his thumb stroking Jake\u2019s cheekbone once before he let his hands drop. \u201cGive it a test drive.\u201d\n\nThey walked the few steps to the bench, their movements synchronised, and sat. The oak was solid and warm from the last of the day\u2019s sun, the angle of the back and the height of the seat exactly as Liam had sketched on the back of the seed packet. It was perfect. It felt, as Jake had hoped, like it had grown there, a natural outgrowth of the garden itself. He rested his hands on the smooth, planed wood of the armrests, the grain a silken map beneath his fingertips. He could feel the life force of the garden around him, the slow, contented respiration of the David Austin roses, the steady ambition of the silver birch reaching for the darkening sky. He could feel the warmth of Liam sitting beside him, a presence as solid and reassuring as the bench beneath them. The Force flowed around and through it all, not as a turbulent river of premonitions and warnings, but as a calm, clear tide, gentle and predictable. The universe had not ended. It had simply, finally, settled.\n\nIn the profound quiet of his own mind, Jake took stock. The hum had been his companion for so long, a constant background static, that its absence was a physical sensation. It was like living next to a great waterfall your whole life and then, one day, the water stops. The resulting silence was not an emptiness but a presence in itself, a vast, clear space that had opened up within him. The anxiety that had lived in the hum, the perpetual low-grade fear of being found, of the past catching up to him, had vanished with it. He felt grounded, anchored to this specific patch of earth in a way he had never felt, even in the deepest meditative trances in the Jedi Temple. The Temple had been about connecting to the infinite, dissolving the self into the cosmic whole. This was the opposite. This was about being wholly, completely, and peacefully *present* in one finite, perfect place, next to one specific, irreplaceable person.\n\n\u201cNeeds a good coat of tung oil,\u201d Liam said, breaking the comfortable silence. He ran his hand along the back of the bench, his touch both proprietary and appreciative. \u201cTwo or three coats, at least. To bring out the colour and protect it from the rain. We should do it next weekend, before it gets a proper soaking.\u201d He used the word \u2018we\u2019 so naturally it made Jake\u2019s heart give a small, happy jolt. The project was over, but the partnership was not. It was simply moving on to its next phase: maintenance. A life together, Jake realised, was not a single, grand act of construction, but a thousand small, ongoing acts of care.\n\nLater, they stood in Jake\u2019s kitchen, a space that was rapidly becoming *their* kitchen. The easy, unrehearsed rhythm they had found while clearing away dinner plates had returned, only now it was imbued with a new, unspoken intimacy. Jake was washing salad leaves at the sink while Liam, having scrubbed his hands and arms clean, was competently chopping onions on the worn pine table. There was no need for conversation. The shared, domestic quiet was a language in itself. For Jake, who had eaten alone for more years than he could count, the simple act of preparing a meal with someone else felt revolutionary. The fortress of his solitude had not been breached; he had simply walked out and left the gate open, and he had no intention of ever closing it again.\n\n\u201cYou seem different,\u201d Liam said, the rhythmic chop of his knife pausing. He was looking at Jake, his head tilted slightly, his gaze perceptive as ever. \u201cNot just now. All afternoon. Lighter.\u201d Jake turned from the sink, water dripping from his hands. He dried them slowly on a tea towel, considering how to answer. He couldn't talk about the hum, the lifelong psychic noise that had just been silenced. But he could speak the truth of its effect. \u201cI feel,\u201d he said, the words feeling new and strange on his tongue, \u201cquiet. For the first time in a very long time. I think I\u2019d forgotten what it felt like.\u201d The admission was a profound act of trust, a peeling back of another layer of his carefully constructed defences. He was sharing not a curated piece of his history, but the raw data of his immediate, internal experience.\n\nLiam held his gaze for a long moment, his expression softening with that deep, intuitive empathy that Jake was coming to cherish more than any Jedi mind-reading. He didn\u2019t press for an explanation. He didn\u2019t need the schematics to understand the architecture of the feeling. He simply put down his knife, wiped his hands, and crossed the small space between them. He placed a hand on Jake\u2019s arm, a familiar, grounding gesture that had come to mean *I am here. You are safe*. \u201cGood,\u201d he said, his voice low and full of a feeling that went far beyond simple agreement. \u201cYou deserve some quiet, Jake.\u201d The simple, heartfelt validation was more healing than any Jedi meditation, a balm applied directly to a wound Jake hadn't even known was still bleeding.\n\nThat night, they took two mugs of Earl Grey out to the garden and sat on the bench again. A sliver of moon hung in the star-dusted sky. For decades, Jake had looked up at those same stars and felt the vast, cold loneliness of the galaxy, the phantom limb of a life he had been forced to amputate. He had seen them as escape routes, hiding places, and, most of all, as a constant, glittering reminder of all he had lost. But tonight, sitting beside Liam, the warmth of their shoulders touching, the scent of damp earth and night-stock filling the air, the stars seemed different. They were no longer a map of his exile, but just a beautiful, distant pattern of light. His universe had finally found its true centre. It wasn\u2019t in the heart of a Republic or in the balance of the Force. It was here, in a quiet garden in Surrey, on a bench made of English oak, beside a man who understood the importance of a solid foundation.Jake woke to the colour of peace. The morning light, filtered through the fine-boned leaves of the silver birch, was still the same pale, watery green, but the silence it illuminated was entirely new. It was a silence that had weight and texture, a velvet quiet that had displaced the hum he had carried in his skull for as long as he could remember. For a confused, blissful moment, he thought he was dreaming. Then he felt the slow, steady rise and fall of the body next to him, the simple, solid warmth of another human being sharing his bed. Liam was asleep, his face relaxed and open in a way Jake had never seen it, his brown hair a tousled mess against the white pillowcase. Jake lay perfectly still, not wanting to disturb the moment. He could feel the thrum of life in the room, not through the Force, but through his own five senses: the scent of Liam\u2019s skin, the soft sound of his breathing, the comforting, undeniable reality of his presence. It was better than any meditation. It was an anchor.\n\nDownstairs, the kitchen felt like a different room. It was no longer Jake\u2019s solitary command centre, but a shared space. Liam, his movements still slow with sleep, went straight to the cupboard for the mugs as if he had been doing so every morning for years. Jake filled the kettle, the familiar ritual now a duet instead of a solo. They moved around each other with an easy, unpracticed grace, a silent understanding passing between them in the spaces where their arms brushed or their eyes met. Liam made the tea while Jake sliced a lemon for his own, the small division of labour feeling as significant as any formal treaty. There was no need to discuss what had happened, no need for awkward morning-after conversation. The change was simply there, a settled fact, as solid and real as the worn pine of the table where they sat.\n\n\u201cThe roses have another flush coming,\u201d Liam said, his voice a pleasant, gravelly rasp in the morning quiet. He cradled his mug in both hands, gazing out at the garden. \u201cThe yellow ones. They look happier now they\u2019ve got a bit of room to breathe.\u201d He wasn't reporting on a job; he was sharing an observation with a fellow custodian. The garden, Jake realised, was no longer his secret, Force-tended sanctuary, looked after by a paid professional. It had become their shared territory, a joint enterprise. \u201cWe should think about planting some hellebores for the winter. They\u2019ll give you a bit of colour when everything else has died back.\u201d\n\nThe casual, forward-looking \u2018we\u2019 landed in Jake\u2019s heart with a gentle, satisfying weight. The future was no longer a vague, shapeless thing to be endured, but something to be planned, planted, and looked forward to. It was a future that included winter colour and the man sitting across from him. He felt a smile spread across his face, a slow, genuine expression of contentment so profound it almost felt foreign. \u201cI\u2019d like that,\u201d he said, and the simple words were a vow. He reached across the table, his fingers finding Liam\u2019s, lacing through them. Liam\u2019s hand was warm and strong, his grip firm and reassuring. They sat like that for a long time, in the quiet green light, drinking their tea, their hands entwined on the table between them, a silent, perfect testament to the new shape of their world.\n\nThe days that followed settled into a rhythm that was both novel and deeply natural. Liam\u2019s work van still rumbled up the drive on Tuesdays, but he no longer left when the light began to fade. Often he would stay for dinner, and then for the night, his presence in the house becoming a simple, accepted fact. His toothbrush appeared in a holder next to Jake\u2019s. A thick, well-worn jumper of his was left draped over the armchair in the living room, a quiet, woollen flag of occupation. Jake, who had spent decades cultivating a life of stark, monastic self-sufficiency, found an unexpected joy in these small erosions of his solitude. The house felt more alive, the silence no longer a sterile absence of sound but a comfortable quiet, rich with the potential of conversation. He was learning the difference between being alone and being lonely, a distinction his Jedi training had never made clear.\n\nHis relationship with the Force was changing, too. Without the constant, anxious hum to filter and interpret, his senses felt both broader and more finely attuned. He began to notice things he had previously overlooked. He could feel the slow, patient joy of the oak bench as it settled onto its stone foundation, its long life as a tree transitioning into a new, stationary existence. He could sense the intricate, hidden life of the soil, the tireless work of worms and mycelial networks creating the rich dark earth that Liam so revered. But the most significant change was in how he used his power. It was no longer a tool for defence or deception, but an instrument of quiet, domestic affection. One evening, as they were cooking together, Liam was searching for the salt, patting his pockets and scanning the counters with a frown. Jake, without breaking his rhythm of stirring a sauce, simply focused for a second. The salt cellar, left on a high shelf, wobbled and then floated gently down, landing with a soft click on the counter right beside Liam\u2019s hand. Liam didn\u2019t even flinch. \u201cOh, there it is,\u201d he said, picking it up and sprinkling it into the pot. \u201cThanks.\u201d He said it with the same casual gratitude he might have shown if Jake had simply passed it to him. The moment was so mundane, so utterly normal, that Jake almost laughed out loud. The Force, the great, mysterious power that bound the galaxy together, had been seamlessly integrated into their life as a handy kitchen shortcut. The old masters would have been horrified. Jake had never felt more at peace.The seasons began to turn, the fierce, preternatural green of Jake\u2019s super-charged summer lawn softening into a more contemplative gold. The partnership in the garden had become the central rhythm of their life. On Tuesdays, Jake would now be waiting for Liam at the shed, armed with his own pair of secateurs\u2014a newer, sharper pair that Liam had bought for him\u2014and a genuine, if still developing, understanding of what needed to be done. He learned the satisfying art of dead-heading, the Zen-like focus required to thin out a sprawling climber, and the patient, hopeful work of planting bulbs that would lie dormant for months before announcing the arrival of a spring they would see together. Liam taught him not just the techniques, but the philosophy. \u201cYou\u2019re not imposing your will on it,\u201d he explained one afternoon, guiding Jake\u2019s hand to show him the precise point at which to prune a rambling rose. \u201cYou\u2019re listening to what it wants to do, and just\u2026 helping it get there with less fuss.\u201d Jake, a man who had spent a lifetime trying to impose the will of a failing Republic on a stubborn galaxy, felt the simple wisdom of this in his bones. It was the same principle Liam had applied to him, he realised. He hadn't tried to change or fix him; he had simply listened to what Jake\u2019s lonely, fractured life was trying to become, and helped it get there.\n\nTheir quiet understanding of Jake\u2019s \u2018knack\u2019, as Liam had taken to calling it, deepened into a form of silent collaboration. They never spoke of it directly, but it became a tool in their shared toolbox, as practical and unassuming as a trowel. When they decided to move a large, half-rotten sleeper that had been sinking into the lawn for years, Liam assessed the weight and angles, planning a complex manoeuvre with levers and rollers. Jake simply stood at one end. \u201cRight, on three,\u201d Liam grunted, bracing himself. On three, Jake took the strain, but he also reached out with the Force, persuading the sleeper that it was light as balsa wood. Liam lifted his end with a grunt of prepared effort, his eyes widening in comical surprise as the heavy, waterlogged beam came up with ridiculous ease. He shot Jake a look over the top of it\u2014a look that was a complex, untranslatable mixture of exasperation, amusement, and profound affection. \u201cShow off,\u201d he muttered, and Jake\u2019s answering laugh was free and unburdened. The use of his power was no longer a guilty secret or a source of fear; it was a private joke, a shared conspiracy, a trick they played together on the unyielding laws of physics.\n\nOne Saturday, they drove into the village for supplies. The trip was mundane\u2014bread from the baker, a newspaper, a bag of compost from the hardware store\u2014but for Jake, it was a momentous expedition. For years, his interactions with the world beyond his garden fence had been brief, transactional, and shrouded in the low-level perception filter he used to remain unnoticed. To walk down the high street on a bright, busy morning next to Liam felt like a debut. He found himself instinctively shrinking, pulling into his old habits of invisibility, until Liam, seemingly sensing his unease, casually reached over and took his hand. The contact was warm, solid, and utterly public. A woman walking her dog smiled at them. The man in the bakery greeted Liam by name and nodded pleasantly at Jake. Nobody stared. No alarms went off. The world did not stop turning. In the simple, grounding clasp of Liam\u2019s hand, Jake felt his old fears dissolving. He was not a fugitive hiding in plain sight. He was just a man, holding his partner\u2019s hand, on his way to buy compost. The sheer, breathtaking normality of it was the most powerful magic he had ever witnessed.\n\nLater that afternoon, sitting on their bench while the new hellebore plants settled into their freshly dug holes, Liam fell quiet. He was watching a family playing at the far end of the public park that bordered their garden, their laughter carrying on the breeze. It was the kind of idyllic, ordinary scene that Jake had always viewed from a distance, as if looking at life in another dimension. \u201cYou ever think about it?\u201d Liam asked, his voice thoughtful. \u201cKids?\u201d The question was so unexpected, so far beyond the realm of anything Jake had ever allowed himself to consider, that he was momentarily stunned into silence. A child. A family. These were concepts from a life he had never lived, a future he had never been entitled to. The Jedi Code was explicit: they were guardians, not parents; their legacy was the Order, not a bloodline. \u201cThe way I was raised,\u201d Jake said, picking his words carefully, translating the sterile doctrine of the Temple into something human and relatable, \u201cit wasn\u2019t\u2026 encouraged. Personal attachments were seen as a distraction from a greater purpose. The idea of a family of my own was never part of the plan.\u201d\n\nHe looked at Liam, expecting to see the subject dropped, but Liam was looking at him with a deep, searching tenderness. \u201cPlans change,\u201d he said softly. \u201cAnd whoever made that plan sounds like they were scared of something.\u201d He paused, turning to face Jake more fully on the bench. \u201cIt\u2019s not a distraction, is it? Loving someone. Building a life. It\u2019s the whole point.\u201d He gestured to the garden, to the house, to the space between them. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a distraction from my work. This *is* the work. It\u2019s the most important work I\u2019ll ever do.\u201d He reached out and took Jake\u2019s hand, his thumb tracing the lines on his palm. \u201cI don\u2019t know what your greater purpose was, Jake. But if it made you hide yourself away from all this for so long, it doesn\u2019t sound like it was all that great to me.\u201d Liam\u2019s simple, earthy logic cut through decades of ingrained dogma with the clean precision of one of his own chisels. The Jedi had feared attachment because it led to jealousy and fear of loss. But Liam wasn\u2019t afraid. He saw love not as a vulnerability, but as the ultimate purpose, the foundation upon which everything else was built.\n\nThat evening, a comfortable quiet settled over the house as they prepared dinner. The conversation from the bench hung in the air, not as a point of tension, but as a newly opened door. As Jake was drying the dishes Liam had washed, Liam spoke from the living room, his voice casual. \u201cMy lease is up in February,\u201d he said. Jake paused, a half-dried plate in his hands. He could feel Liam\u2019s intention, not through the Force, but through the simple, clear connection that now existed between them. It wasn't a question or a demand. It was a statement of fact, laid gently between them for Jake to pick up. \u201cThe landlord\u2019s planning on selling. I\u2019ll need to find a new place.\u201d Jake turned, leaning against the counter, and looked through the doorway at Liam, who was standing by the bookshelf, feigning an interest in a thick history of medieval guilds. The silence stretched, filled with unspoken possibilities.\n\n\u201cThe spare room is full of junk,\u201d Jake said, his voice quiet but clear in the still house. \u201cIt would take a while to clear it out. And the wardrobe only has one rail.\u201d He watched as Liam\u2019s shoulders, which had been tense, relaxed. A slow smile spread across Liam\u2019s face as he turned away from the bookshelf to face him. \u201cI\u2019m good at clearing out junk,\u201d Liam said, his eyes sparkling. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t have that many clothes.\u201d The future, which had once been an abstract concept Jake had tried to avoid, was now being discussed in terms of wardrobe space and clearing out a spare room. It was practical. It was tangible. It was real. Jake felt a wave of profound, unconditional love for this man, this gardener who had looked at the overgrown, neglected wilderness of his life and had seen not a lost cause, but a place with good bones, a place that just needed a little help to find the sun.The process of clearing out Liam\u2019s flat was less a move and more an excavation. The small, rented space, which Jake had never seen before, was exactly as he had imagined: functional, tidy, and profoundly temporary. It was a place a man kept his things, not where he lived his life. The furniture was sparse and anonymous, the walls were bare, and the air held a faint, lingering scent of the Indian takeaways he had favoured before Jake\u2019s pasta and curries had entered the picture. There was no clutter, only a collection of neatly stacked boxes, a testament to a life kept perpetually ready to move on. Jake felt a pang of recognition. He, too, had once lived this way, his few possessions always ready for a quick departure, his presence in any location deliberately shallow, leaving no mark. Looking at Liam\u2019s spartan flat, he felt a profound gratitude that they had found each other, two men who had learned, in their own very different ways, how to finally stay put.\n\nLiam\u2019s history was packed into a handful of cardboard boxes. There were his clothes, practical and unadorned. There were the essentials of a simple kitchen. But then there were the boxes that held the man himself. One, heavier than all the others, was filled with his grandfather\u2019s old gardening books, their spines cracked and their pages soft with use, filled with handwritten notes in a spidery, fading script. Another held a carefully wrapped collection of photographs: a smiling, stubborn-looking old man who had to be the grandfather, a younger, unsmiling man who was likely Liam\u2019s father, and a few faded pictures of a woman with Liam\u2019s kind eyes. He handled these boxes with a gentle reverence that was touching to witness. As Jake reached to lift the heavy box of books, he subtly wrapped it in the Force, not to lift it for him, but to cradle it, to ensure its precious, paper-and-ink contents wouldn\u2019t shift or tear. It was an invisible act of care, a secret promise to protect the history that was now being entrusted to him.\n\nThe most significant task, however, lay back at their own house, in the spare room upstairs. It was a room Jake had used as a repository for the last, stubborn remnants of his past, the few physical artifacts he hadn\u2019t had the heart or the ruthlessness to destroy. The door had remained closed for years. Now, with Liam at his side, he opened it. The room was filled with a few sealed storage crates. Liam, ever practical, simply rolled up his sleeves. \u201cRight,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s see what we\u2019re dealing with.\u201d He made to lift the lid of the largest crate, but Jake placed a hand on his arm, stopping him. \u201cWait,\u201d Jake said, his voice quiet. He didn\u2019t know how to explain that the contents were not just junk, but relics of a dead galaxy, objects that could be dangerous in their implications if not in their function.\n\nHe opened the crate himself. Inside, nestled in protective foam, were a few objects that looked both ancient and advanced. There was a handheld data-slate, its screen dark and lifeless. There was a palm-sized metallic sphere that, if activated, would project a star-chart of a system that no longer existed. And at the bottom, wrapped in a piece of oilcloth, was a single, scorched glove from his old Master\u2019s robes, retrieved from a funeral pyre whose smoke he could still smell if he let himself. He stared at the objects, the weight of their history threatening to pull him back into the cold, empty space he had fought so hard to escape. Liam didn\u2019t ask what they were. He didn\u2019t pry or press. He simply looked from the strange, silent objects to Jake\u2019s face, and he understood. He saw not alien technology, but the unbearable weight of grief. \u201cSome things are heavy,\u201d he said softly, his voice full of a simple, profound empathy. \u201cDo you want to keep them, or is it time for them to be at peace?\u201d\n\nThe question was a key, unlocking something in Jake\u2019s heart. He had been a guardian of these relics, a keeper of a dead flame. But Liam was right. They were not just heavy; they were an anchor, holding him to a past that was gone. He was no longer a guardian. He was a gardener. A partner. A man building a life, not curating a museum of sorrow. He reached into the crate and his fingers closed around the small, metallic sphere. It was cool and smooth, a perfect, self-contained memory. He slipped it into his pocket. Then he looked at Liam and took a deep, steadying breath. \u201cIt\u2019s time for them to be at peace,\u201d he said. Later that day, they drove to the municipal recycling centre. Jake, feeling both a profound sadness and an exhilarating sense of freedom, dropped the data-slate and the scorched glove into a large bin marked \u2018Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment\u2019. A mundane, terrestrial end for the last remnants of the Jedi Order. As he turned away, Liam was there, and he took Jake\u2019s hand, his grip solid and unwavering. No words were needed. The past had been laid to rest, respectfully and without fanfare, in a recycling skip in Surrey.\n\nBy evening, the house was in a state of happy, organised chaos. Boxes were stacked in the hallway and the living room, some open, some still sealed. Liam\u2019s life was slowly, surely, merging with Jake\u2019s. His practical, mud-stained boots now stood permanently by the back door next to Jake\u2019s tidier walking shoes. His grandfather\u2019s gardening books had been given pride of place on a shelf in the living room, their worn spines nestled comfortably between Jake\u2019s volumes on planetary history and military strategy. The two collections looked incongruous, and yet, somehow, perfectly right together. The house was no longer just Jake\u2019s quiet, sterile sanctuary. It was becoming a home, layered with the stories and possessions of two lives, a place filled with the comfortable, untidy clutter of a shared existence.\n\nExhausted, filthy, and profoundly content, they gave up on the idea of cooking. Liam, with a triumphant grin, called and ordered a pizza, the one he used to eat alone out of a box. When it arrived, they didn\u2019t bother with plates. They sat on the floor of the living room, leaning against the sofa, surrounded by the cardboard architecture of their new life. They ate straight from the box, their legs stretched out, their shoulders companionably pressed together. The room smelled of cheese, tomato, and cardboard. Looking at Liam, his face illuminated by the soft light of a single lamp, a smear of pizza sauce on his chin, Jake felt a wave of love so powerful it was a physical force, a warmth that spread from his chest to the tips of his fingers. This was it. The grand, cosmic purpose he had once served had crumbled to dust, but here, in the rubble, he had built something small, and strong, and true. He was no longer the last Jedi, a man running from ghosts. He was Jake, a man who shared a pizza on the floor with the person he loved. He was, finally and completely, home.The weeks that followed the move were a slow, joyful process of integration. The cardboard boxes, at first a chaotic mountain range in the living room, were gradually eroded, their contents spilling out and finding new homes on shelves, in cupboards, and on windowsills. Jake discovered that living with someone was a constant, quiet negotiation. It was the debate over which of their two colanders to keep (they kept Liam\u2019s, which was larger and more robust), the discovery that Liam hummed tunelessly when he was concentrating on a task, and the simple, profound comfort of waking in the night and reaching out to find another person there, solid and real in the darkness. The house, once a silent vessel for one man\u2019s solitude, began to accumulate the gentle, layered history of two. Jake found a fossil, a perfect ammonite Liam had found as a child, resting on his desk next to the small, metallic sphere he had saved from the purge. The two objects, one from a forgotten age of Earth and the other from a fallen galactic civilisation, seemed to hold a silent conversation, two survivors of time and catastrophe resting together in the quiet of a Surrey study.\n\nThe final box to be unpacked was the one containing Liam\u2019s photographs. They sat on the floor one rainy Sunday afternoon, the new bench outside glistening with water, and sorted through the glossy prints and dog-eared albums. Liam was a quiet, affectionate guide through his own history. He pointed out his grandfather, a man with a weathered face and a twinkle in his eye, standing proudly beside a prize-winning marrow. He showed Jake a photo of his mother, a gentle-faced woman with a mischievous smile, her arm around a young, gap-toothed Liam. Her absence was a soft, unspoken sadness in the collection. And then there were the photos of his father. A handsome man in his youth, his smile slightly forced, standing in front of a half-finished building, a set of architectural plans clutched in his hand. In every picture, he seemed to be looking just past the camera, his gaze fixed on some distant, unseen horizon.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not a bad man,\u201d Liam said, his voice neutral as he stared at a photo of his father awkwardly trying to help a teenage Liam assemble a shed. \u201cHe\u2019s just\u2026 loud. Everything about him is loud. His voice, his opinions, the way he thinks the world should work. He thinks in straight lines and right angles. Concrete and steel. He can\u2019t understand why anyone would choose a life of curves and circles. Soil and seasons.\u201d Liam traced the outline of his father\u2019s face with his finger. \u201cHe thinks what I do is a hobby. He\u2019s proud of me, in his own way, I think. But he doesn\u2019t respect it. Not really.\u201d The admission was made without bitterness, a simple statement of a long-accepted fact.\n\nJust as he said it, as if summoned by the conversation, Liam\u2019s phone, lying on the rug between them, began to buzz. The screen lit up with the name \u2018Dad\u2019. Liam sighed, a long, weary sound, and shot Jake an apologetic, almost comical look of resignation. He answered, his voice instantly taking on a slightly more formal, more guarded tone. \u201cHi Dad. Yeah, I\u2019m good. How are you?\u201d Jake sat quietly, pretending to be absorbed in an album, but he listened to the one-sided conversation, the Force giving him an unwelcome but vivid impression of the man on the other end of the line: a booming, impatient energy, a mind that moved too quickly and listened too little, a constant, restless dissatisfaction. Liam\u2019s responses were brief and non-committal, a series of deflections and placations. \u201cYeah, the move went fine\u2026 No, it\u2019s not too small\u2026 It\u2019s nice, it\u2019s got a great garden\u2026 Yes, I\u2019m still just doing the gardening\u2026\u201d The conversation ended a few minutes later, leaving a palpable tension in the quiet room. Liam tossed the phone onto a cushion and ran a hand through his hair. \u201cHe wants to \u2018come and inspect the new place\u2019,\u201d he said, his imitation of his father\u2019s booming voice a perfect, loving mockery. \u201cMake sure I\u2019m not living in a hovel. He also has a lead on a big landscaping contract for a new office park. Thinks I should get a proper crew together, start a limited company. He doesn\u2019t hear a word I say.\u201d\n\nJake watched him, his heart aching with a fierce, protective love. He knew what it was like to be misunderstood by a father figure, to have your life\u2019s path measured against a set of expectations you could never meet. His own masters had wanted him to be a perfect, detached instrument of the Force, a selfless guardian of an ideal. They had never understood the messy, human heart that beat beneath his robes. \u201cWhen I was younger,\u201d Jake said, his voice drawing Liam\u2019s gaze, \u201cthe people who trained me had a very specific vision for my life. A very grand one. It was all about legacy, about upholding a tradition that was thousands of years old. Every choice was weighed against that purpose.\u201d He paused, choosing his words with care, stripping them of their alien context. \u201cI spent a long time trying to be the person they wanted me to be. I believed in the purpose, but I always felt like I was wearing clothes that didn't fit. When it all fell apart, the hardest thing wasn't losing the purpose. It was admitting to myself that I was relieved.\u201d\n\nLiam stared at him, his own troubles momentarily forgotten, his full attention captured. \u201cRelieved?\u201d Jake nodded. \u201cIt was a beautiful, important structure, and I mourned its collapse. But it was also a cage. A gilded one, but a cage nonetheless. Being free of it\u2026 it was terrifying. But it was also the first time I got to choose what my own life was for.\u201d He reached out and placed his hand over Liam\u2019s, which was resting on the open photo album. \u201cYour father sees the world in terms of structures, of things being built bigger and higher. You see it in terms of things growing stronger and deeper. It\u2019s not a hobby, Liam. It\u2019s a different kind of architecture. One that\u2019s much harder to master. And one, I think, that\u2019s built to last.\u201d The words settled in the space between them, a quiet, solid truth. Liam\u2019s hand turned under Jake\u2019s, his fingers lacing through his. A slow, grateful smile spread across his face, chasing away the lingering tension from his father\u2019s phone call. \u201cA different kind of architecture,\u201d he repeated softly, as if trying on the phrase. He looked from Jake\u2019s face to their intertwined hands, then around the room at the comfortable, half-unpacked chaos of their life. \u201cYeah,\u201d he said, his voice full of a renewed, quiet confidence. \u201cI like that. Let\u2019s show him our architecture.\u201dThe week leading up to the visit from Liam\u2019s father was not spent in a flurry of anxious preparation, but in a period of quiet, deliberate consolidation. There was no frantic tidying or polishing. Instead, they spent their time in the garden, a shared act of devotion to the \u2018architecture\u2019 they had resolved to present. Together, they planted the hellebores, their hands moving in the cool, damp earth, placing the roots of the \u2018Christmas roses\u2019 in the soil as a quiet promise of life in the darkest part of the year. They gave the bench its first coat of tung oil, the rich, nutty scent filling the air as they worked in companionable silence, the wood\u2019s grain deepening to a lustrous, golden brown under their careful hands. They were not trying to create an impression of perfection for an audience; they were simply tending to their life, making it more fully and truly itself. Every shared task was a quiet reinforcement of their unity, a strengthening of the foundations Alan was coming to inspect.\n\n\u201cThe important thing is not to be defensive,\u201d Liam said one evening, as they sat on the bench, watching the last of the light fade from the sky. \u201cHe\u2019s not coming here to attack us, not really. He\u2019s coming to try and rescue me. In his mind, he\u2019s the hero, trying to save his son from a life of obscurity and poverty.\u201d He laughed, a short, humourless sound. \u201cThe best thing we can do is just look happy. Look like we don\u2019t need rescuing.\u201d Jake looked at him, at the quiet resolve in his profile, and felt a swell of pride. This was not the man who had mumbled refusals and looked at the ground. This was a man standing on his own firm foundation, ready to calmly state its worth. Jake\u2019s role in the coming encounter, he knew, was not to be a defender, but simply to be a visible part of that foundation. His presence, his happiness, his quiet contentment in this life with Liam, would be his only argument, and the most powerful one he could make.\n\nAlan\u2019s arrival on Saturday was not a gentle convergence; it was a percussive event. A large, gleaming black saloon, entirely out of place on the quiet suburban street, crunched onto the gravel drive with an air of proprietary importance. The man who emerged was as imposing as his vehicle. Alan was tall and broad, dressed in expensive, sharp-angled casual clothes that looked uncomfortable in the soft, autumnal setting of the garden. He moved with a restless, forward-driving energy that seemed to consume the oxygen around him, and his voice, when he greeted his son with a booming \u201cThere he is!\u201d, filled the quiet space of the garden completely. Jake felt the psychic shock of it, a sudden, intrusive noise after weeks of profound quiet. It was the energy of the Coruscant cityscape, of ambition and commerce and ceaseless, demanding motion, concentrated into one man. He felt his old instincts flicker, the urge to shield, to retreat into invisibility, but then he felt Liam\u2019s hand find his, a quick, reassuring squeeze before he stepped forward to greet his father.\n\nThe \u2018inspection\u2019 was a swift, dismissive tour. Alan strode through the small, comfortable rooms, his large frame making them feel smaller, his eyes scanning everything with a builder\u2019s appraising, and ultimately disappointed, gaze. \u201cCosy,\u201d he pronounced, the word landing with the faint damnation of a surveyor finding subsidence. He nodded at the shelves of books, at the comfortable, worn furniture, at the general lack of chrome and glass and newness. In the garden, he was even more direct. He admired the neatness of the lawn, the health of the roses, with the air of a man appreciating a well-maintained hobby. He ran a hand over the new bench. \u201cGood work, this,\u201d he conceded, his professional eye approving of the tight joints and solid construction. \u201cYou could knock these out all day long. Set up a proper workshop, get a couple of lads in. There\u2019s a market for this high-end garden stuff.\u201d He saw a product, a production line, a business model. He did not see a love letter written in oak.\n\nThey sat down for lunch at the kitchen table, the same worn pine that had witnessed every stage of Jake and Liam\u2019s relationship. Alan, however, seemed to dominate it, his presence and his booming voice shrinking the comfortable space into a tense arena. He had brought blueprints with him. He unrolled them on the table with a flourish, the crisp paper covering the space where Jake and Liam\u2019s hands had so often met. It was the office park. A vast, sprawling complex of glass and steel, surrounded by geometrically perfect lawns and ruler-straight lines of imported trees. \u201cThis is it, son,\u201d Alan said, his voice resonating with genuine passion. \u201cThis is a proper job. We\u2019re talking five years of contracts, just to start. You\u2019d be head of landscaping. Not just planting a few shrubs, but proper civil engineering. Drainage, irrigation, earth-moving. You\u2019d have a team of twenty. It\u2019s a real career, Liam. A chance to build something that\u2019ll be here in a hundred years.\u201d He looked from the plans to his son, his face alight with the fervent belief that he was offering the keys to the kingdom.\n\nLiam listened patiently, his hands resting calmly in his lap. The Liam of a year ago would have been staring at the table, overwhelmed. This Liam met his father\u2019s intense gaze without flinching. When Alan finally finished, a hopeful, expectant silence fell. Liam took a slow breath. \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing project, Dad. It really is. And I know you\u2019ll do a brilliant job with it.\u201d Alan\u2019s face beamed. \u201cBut it\u2019s your project,\u201d Liam continued, his voice quiet but unshakably firm. \u201cIt\u2019s your architecture. It\u2019s not mine.\u201d Alan\u2019s smile faltered, a flicker of confusion and impatience crossing his features. \u201cArchitecture? What are you talking about? It\u2019s a job, a brilliant opportunity!\u201d Liam glanced at Jake, a quick, almost imperceptible look that was filled with a universe of shared understanding. Jake gave a tiny, slow nod, his own calm a silent, invisible buttress supporting Liam\u2019s resolve. \u201cJake and I,\u201d Liam said, turning his full attention back to his father, \u201cwe\u2019re building something here. It\u2019s just a different kind of architecture. It\u2019s not made of steel and glass. It doesn\u2019t scrape the sky.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor god\u2019s sake, Liam, it\u2019s a semi-detached house and a vegetable patch!\u201d Alan boomed, his frustration finally boiling over. \u201cDon\u2019t get romantic. I\u2019m talking about your future!\u201d It was at this moment that Jake spoke, his voice so quiet after Alan\u2019s that it commanded immediate attention. \u201cThe foundations are good,\u201d he said simply. He was looking at Liam, not Alan, but the words were directed at the older man. \u201cThe foundations here are very good. They\u2019re built on solid ground.\u201d Alan stared at him, for the first time truly seeing him not just as his son\u2019s quiet housemate, but as a part of this inexplicable resistance. He saw the absolute certainty in Jake\u2019s eyes, the deep, unshakable calm, and for a moment, his own restless energy seemed to falter in the face of it. He looked from Jake\u2019s serene face to his son\u2019s determined one, and saw not a phase or a hobby, but a partnership, a unified, unbreachable wall of quiet conviction. He didn\u2019t understand it. He couldn\u2019t see the value in it. But for the first time, he seemed to recognise its strength. He slowly, defeatedly, began to roll up his blueprints.The departure of Alan\u2019s car was as percussive as its arrival. The crunch of gravel was sharp and final, the engine roared to life with an impatient bark, and then the sound faded down the street, leaving behind a silence that felt vast and profoundly peaceful. For a long moment, neither Jake nor Liam moved. They remained at the kitchen table, the space where the blueprints had been now empty, a blank canvas. Then, Liam let out a breath he seemed to have been holding all afternoon, a long, slow exhalation that was equal parts relief and exhaustion. He slumped back in his chair and scrubbed a hand over his face. Jake reached across the table, his hand covering Liam\u2019s. The contact was an affirmation, a quiet declaration of victory. Liam\u2019s fingers, which had been clenched into a fist, slowly uncurled, and he laced them through Jake\u2019s. He looked up, and a slow, tired, but triumphant smile spread across his face.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d Liam said, his voice returning to its normal, gentle cadence. \u201cThat\u2019s that, then.\u201d They didn\u2019t need to say anything more. The encounter had been a test, a stress-test of the structure they had built together, and it had held. The foundations were good. They had stood their ground not with anger or argument, but with the quiet, unassailable fact of their shared happiness. They spent the rest of the afternoon clearing away the remnants of the visit. Liam carefully washed and dried the plates, while Jake wiped down the table, erasing the faint indentations left by the blueprints. The actions were mundane, but they felt ceremonial, a reclaiming and reconsecration of their space. They were washing away the last traces of a loud, intrusive world and restoring their home to its natural state of quiet contentment. When they were done, the house felt lighter, the air cleaner. It was fully theirs again.\n\nLife settled into a new, deeper rhythm, a quiet cadence that matched the shortening days and the slow descent of autumn into winter. Their world shrank to the boundaries of their home and garden, not as a retreat from the world, but as a deliberate and joyful focus on what mattered. They insulated the shed, turning it into a snug, year-round workshop. They stacked firewood in a neat cord against the back wall of the house. They mulched the rose beds, tucking them in for their long sleep. These were not chores, but acts of shared domestic faith, a preparation for a future they implicitly knew they would spend together. The hellebores, as promised, began to push brave, pale flowers through the cold soil, small points of light in the gathering dark. Jake found that he no longer looked at the sky with a sense of loss or longing. He looked at the earth, at the small, tenacious proofs of life pushing through the dirt, and felt a profound sense of belonging. His universe was no longer a vast, empty expanse dotted with dead stars; it was a half-acre plot of Surrey soil, rich with life and promise.\n\nOne evening, with a cold rain whispering against the windowpanes and a fire crackling in the living room hearth, the time felt right. Liam was on the rug, patiently untangling a string of fairy lights he\u2019d bought for the silver birch, humming his tuneless hum of concentration. Jake sat in his armchair, a book open but unread in his lap. He had been carrying the small, metallic sphere in his pocket for days, its cool, smooth weight a constant reminder of the one story he had not yet fully shared. The final piece of his architecture. He took it out, its surface gleaming dully in the firelight. Liam glanced up from his tangle of wires, his curiosity piqued. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d he asked. \u201cThe one thing you kept.\u201d\n\nJake held it in his palm, the last relic of his old life. \u201cIt\u2019s a map,\u201d he said softly. \u201cA memory.\u201d He knew, with a certainty that had nothing to do with the Force, that this was the final act of trust. He focused, not with a surge of power, but with a gentle, willing intent, the way he now coaxed a seed to sprout. The sphere responded, a low, resonant note filling the air for a fraction of a second before it projected a soft, three-dimensional image into the space above his hand. It was not a grand, sprawling chart of the galaxy, but something far more intimate. A miniature, shimmering orrery of a solar system with two suns, a handful of rocky inner worlds, and one, a breathtaking swirl of blue and white, that glowed with a slightly brighter, more vibrant light. The tiny planets drifted in silent, perfect orbits, their movements as graceful and precise as a piece of music. It was impossibly beautiful, and it pulsed with a faint, heartbreaking echo of peace.\n\nLiam stared, utterly mesmerised. He put down the lights, his hands resting on his knees, his face bathed in the soft, blue-white glow of the projection. \u201cJake,\u201d he breathed. \u201cWhat is that?\u201d Jake\u2019s gaze was fixed on the glowing blue world. \u201cIt\u2019s my home,\u201d he said, his voice thick with an ancient grief. \u201cAlderaan. It was\u2026 a city built in the mountains. The air tasted like cold water.\u201d He was quoting himself from a conversation that felt like it had happened a lifetime ago. \u201cThis is a children\u2019s primer. A star-map. It shows you where you came from, so you never feel lost.\u201d He looked at Liam, his own eyes glistening in the firelight. \u201cThe map is all that\u2019s left. It leads to a place that isn\u2019t there anymore.\u201d The silence in the room was absolute, broken only by the crackle of the fire. Liam didn\u2019t ask how or why. He didn\u2019t need to. He saw the story not in the impossible technology floating in the air, but in the profound, bottomless sorrow in Jake\u2019s eyes. He saw the ultimate refugee, a man whose entire world, whose very point of origin, had been erased from the universe.\n\nSlowly, gently, Liam reached out, not to touch the projection, but to place his hand on Jake\u2019s knee. His touch was an anchor in a swirling sea of memory. \u201cThen we\u2019ll have to draw a new map,\u201d he said, his voice soft but unwavering. The shimmering planets of Alderaan continued their silent, ghostly dance between them. Liam looked from the projection to Jake\u2019s face, his expression one of infinite tenderness and fierce resolve. \u201cYou said the idea of a family was never part of your plan. And I said plans change.\u201d He took a breath, the quiet gravity of his words filling the room. \u201cMy grandad used to say the best thing you can plant is a tree you\u2019ll never get to sit under. It\u2019s about building something for a future you won\u2019t be a part of. Creating a legacy.\u201d He looked at the ghost-world hanging in the air. \u201cYour legacy was taken from you. All those people, all that history. Gone.\u201d He squeezed Jake\u2019s knee, his gaze intense and full of a love that was a tangible force in the room. \u201cSo let\u2019s start a new one. Right here. A new tree. A new history. A new family.\u201d It was not a question. It was a proposal, a blueprint for a future so radical and so beautiful it made Jake\u2019s heart ache. The projection of his lost home wavered, and with a soft sigh, Jake let his concentration go. The light winked out, plunging the room back into the simple, warm glow of the fire. He was left holding a cold, inert piece of metal, a dead memory. But his other hand was held firmly in Liam\u2019s, a warm, living promise of a future waiting to be built.Jake didn\u2019t speak for a long time. The fire crackled into the silence, a small, domestic sound set against the galactic scale of what had just been offered. He looked down at the inert sphere in his palm, a cold, dead weight that represented the end of a story. Then he looked at Liam\u2019s hand, so warm and solid, holding his own. It was the beginning of a story. The Jedi Order had taught him that a Jedi\u2019s legacy was the continuation of the Order itself, a faceless, selfless contribution to a river of tradition. They had taught that personal lineage was a vanity, a selfish diversion from a higher calling. But looking at Liam\u2019s earnest, loving face, illuminated by the firelight, Jake saw the lie in that teaching with a clarity that was like a physical blow. The Order was gone. The tradition was broken. The river had run dry. And what had its selflessness achieved? It had created an army of lonely, emotionally stunted guardians who were so afraid of personal loss that they failed to prevent a galactic one. Liam, who had never heard of the Force, understood a truth the Jedi Masters had forgotten: that the fiercest, most selfless love is born not from abstract ideals, but from the fierce, specific, and terrifying love for one\u2019s own. A family wasn\u2019t a distraction from a greater purpose; it was the crucible in which purpose was forged.\n\nFinally, he found his voice, a low murmur that was thick with unshed tears. \u201cYes,\u201d he said. The single word was an exhalation, a surrender, a vow. It was the most profound act of rebellion he had ever committed, a final, definitive rejection of the ghosts that had haunted him across the stars. He closed his fingers around the cold sphere one last time, then deliberately placed it on the mantelpiece, setting it down like a paperweight, an old curio whose power was now spent. Its story was over. He turned back to Liam, taking his hand with both of his own, holding on as if he were a drowning man who had just found land. \u201cYes,\u201d he said again, his voice stronger this time, filled with a conviction that was entirely new. \u201cLet\u2019s draw a new map.\u201d A new kind of hum began, almost imperceptibly, at the base of his skull. It was not the anxious thrum of trouble or the lonely signal of his exile. It was a deep, resonant, creative frequency, the feeling of a world being born.\n\nThe conversations that had once been about herbaceous borders and joinery techniques shifted focus. Their quiet evenings, once spent reading or working in the shed, were now dedicated to a different kind of planning. Liam would bring home stacks of pamphlets and printouts from the internet, spreading them across the kitchen table. Adoption. Fostering. Surrogacy. The words were clinical, bureaucratic, but they represented a future so full of hope it felt dazzling. Jake, the man who had once navigated the complex legal frameworks of a thousand different worlds, found a strange, poignant irony in poring over UK family law statutes and the dizzying array of forms required by social services. He applied the same meticulous focus he had once used to plan supply routes for a rebel fleet to understanding the criteria for prospective adoptive parents. He and Liam would sit for hours, mugs of tea growing cold beside them, discussing the profound questions posed by the sterile paperwork. What were their strengths as a couple? How would they handle conflict? What were their hopes and dreams for a child? Each question, designed to assess their suitability for parenthood, served instead to deepen their own bond, forcing them to articulate the unspoken truths of their relationship. They were not just filling out forms; they were writing the constitution of their new family.\n\nOne night, faced with a section titled \u2018Personal History and Support Network\u2019, Jake faltered. His own history was a redacted document, a tapestry of lies and omissions. His support network consisted entirely of the man sitting opposite him. \u201cThey\u2019ll want references,\u201d he said, his voice flat. \u201cThey\u2019ll want to talk to people who have known me for years. Friends. Family. Colleagues.\u201d The impossibility of it all felt like a sudden, insurmountable wall. He had spent decades ensuring no such people existed. Liam reached across the table and gently closed the folder. \u201cThen we tell the truth,\u201d he said, his tone unwavering. \u201cWell, a version of it.\u201d He smiled, a small, conspiratorial grin. \u201cYou\u2019re a man who lost everyone in a political conflict overseas. You moved here seeking peace and quiet. You\u2019re intensely private because of that trauma. You have no living relatives. Your only support network is me. It\u2019s all true. Just\u2026 edited for a terrestrial audience.\u201d The way he said it, so simply, so pragmatically, stripped the problem of its power. He wasn\u2019t asking Jake to lie. He was helping him frame a truth that was too large and too strange for a standard form. He was translating Jake\u2019s life into a language the world could understand.\n\nThe most challenging conversation, they both knew, would be with Alan. Liam decided to face it head-on, inviting his father over for Sunday lunch a few weeks later. The atmosphere was noticeably different from his last visit. Alan was more subdued, the booming certainty slightly diminished, as if his previous encounter with their quiet, united front had left a lasting impression. He still looked out of place in their comfortable, slightly cluttered home, a hawk in a pigeon-coop, but his energy was less intrusive. Over lunch, after a stretch of awkward small talk about the weather and the state of the construction industry, Liam took a deep breath and made his announcement. \u201cJake and I are going to start a family,\u201d he said, his voice clear and steady. \u201cWe\u2019ve started the adoption process.\u201d Alan froze, a forkful of roast potato halfway to his mouth. He stared at Liam, then at Jake, his mind visibly struggling to process the information. Jake braced himself for an explosion, for a lecture on responsibility or tradition or the madness of it all. Instead, a strange, complex series of emotions played across Alan\u2019s face: confusion, disbelief, and then, unexpectedly, something else. Something that looked almost like pride.\n\n\u201cA family,\u201d Alan said, his voice a low rumble. He put his fork down. The builder, the man who thought in dynasties of concrete and steel, understood the concept of legacy better than anyone. A company could fail, a building could be torn down, but a child, a grandchild\u2014that was a structure built to last. He looked at his son, truly looked at him, and for the first time, he seemed to see not a directionless hobbyist, but a man making a serious, life-altering commitment. A man building something profound. \u201cA kid needs a proper workshop,\u201d Alan said gruffly, looking around the small kitchen. \u201cCan\u2019t have him learning woodwork in a drafty shed. We\u2019ll need to build a proper extension. Insulated. With good light.\u201d He looked at Jake, his gaze sharp and appraising. \u201cAnd you. You\u2019re home all day. You\u2019ll need a study. A proper office. Can\u2019t have paperwork all over the kitchen table.\u201d It was his way of giving his blessing. He couldn\u2019t engage with the emotional architecture, but he understood the practical one. He saw a project, a build, a chance to contribute in the only way he knew how. It was an offer of help, a clumsy but genuine act of love, and it was his own form of surrender.\n\nThat night, long after Alan had left, leaving behind not blueprints but an offer to draw some up, Jake found himself unable to sleep. He slipped out of bed, careful not to wake Liam, and went to the spare room, which was slowly being transformed from a storage space into a future child\u2019s bedroom. The moonlight fell through the window, illuminating the bare walls and empty floor. This room, more than any other, represented the future. It was a space of pure potential. He sat on the floor in the centre of the room and closed his eyes, sinking into a state of meditation. He did not seek to detach, to dissolve into the cosmic tide. He did the opposite. He gathered himself, focusing his senses inward, on the quiet, steady beat of his own heart. He thought of the Jedi litany. *There is no emotion, there is peace.* It was a lie. There was emotion. His chest was filled with a terrifying, exhilarating ocean of it: love for Liam, hope for this child, a fierce, protective instinct that was more powerful than any weapon he had ever wielded. *There is no passion, there is serenity.* Another lie. His passion for this new life was a burning sun, a source of immense energy and light. *There is no death, there is the Force.* This, he realised, was the only part that was true, but the Jedi had misunderstood it. They saw it as an escape from the grief of personal loss. But sitting here, in this empty room, Jake understood it differently. The Force was not an escape from death; it was the thread of life that connected everything, that wove new lives from the threads of the old. Alderaan was gone, but its people, its culture, its peace\u2014all of it existed within him, a part of the great, flowing river. And soon, he would get to pour that legacy, that love, into a new vessel. He would teach a child about courage and kindness, about listening to the world around them, about how to build things that last. He would not teach them to fear attachment, but to embrace it as the source of all strength. He was not the last of the old Jedi. He was the first of something new.The adoption process, Jake discovered, was a strange and humbling form of archaeology. It involved digging through the layers of one\u2019s own life, cleaning off the dust and debris, and presenting the findings for rigorous inspection. Their social worker, a woman named Sarah with tired, kind eyes and a sensible haircut, became a regular visitor. She would sit at their kitchen table, the same pine surface that had borne witness to their entire relationship, and ask questions that were both deeply personal and clinically detached. Jake, who had once stood before the Jedi Council and defended his strategies for entire star sectors, found himself more nervous discussing his cleaning rota and his views on discipline with this quiet, perceptive woman. He had to exert a conscious, disciplined effort not to use the Force, not to seek a glimpse of her thoughts or feelings. To do so would have felt like a profound violation, a form of cheating on the most important test of his life. His task was simply to be present, to be honest, and to trust that the truth of what he and Liam had built together would be enough.\n\nLiam was their anchor through it all. Where Jake\u2019s history was a carefully edited narrative, Liam\u2019s was an open book, rich with the texture of real, lived life. He spoke of his grandfather with a simple, unaffected love that made the old man a palpable presence in the room. He talked about his work not as a job, but as a vocation, his belief in the value of soil and patience shining through every word. When Sarah asked him why he wanted to be a father, he didn\u2019t offer a prepared, perfect answer. He simply looked at Jake, a quick, warm glance, before turning back to her. \u201cBecause I was lucky enough to have a good home,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I think everyone deserves that. And because I\u2019ve found the person I want to build that home with. It\u2019s the next thing that needs to grow in the garden.\u201d The answer was so perfectly, beautifully him that Jake felt a familiar, powerful wave of love crest in his chest.\n\nThe process was not without its moments of quiet terror. During one visit, Sarah, leafing through her notes, asked Jake a follow-up question about his past. \u201cYour file says your work in logistics involved a lot of time in conflict zones,\u201d she said, her pen poised. \u201cThat must have been incredibly stressful. How do you feel it affects you now?\u201d The question was a minefield. He couldn\u2019t speak of the Clone Wars, of the screams of dying men echoing through his helmet, of the gut-wrenching responsibility of sending troops into battles they might not survive. He had to find the terrestrial translation. He took a slow breath, focusing on the genuine emotion, the core truth of the experience. \u201cIt taught me that some things, once broken, can\u2019t be fixed,\u201d he said, his voice low and steady. \u201cIt taught me the value of peace. A true, quiet peace, not just the absence of fighting. And it taught me that you can\u2019t protect anyone or anything if you, yourself, are falling apart.\u201d He looked up, meeting her gaze. \u201cComing here, building this life, tending this garden\u2026 it was how I put myself back together. I am not the man I was then.\u201d Sarah held his gaze for a long moment, and he could see her assessing the weight of his words. He had offered her the scar, not the story of the wound, and she seemed to understand. She made a brief note on her pad and nodded, accepting the answer.\n\nIn parallel with this emotional excavation, a more literal one began. Alan, true to his word, descended upon their quiet corner of Surrey with the force of a small, benevolent hurricane. A mini-digger arrived on a flatbed truck, and the gentle sounds of the garden were replaced by the roar of its engine and the rhythmic clank of its hydraulic arm. The ground behind the house was torn up, foundations were poured, and a timber frame began to rise against the back wall. It was loud, it was messy, and it was the most wonderful chaos Jake had ever experienced. Alan was in his element, a whirlwind of energy, directing his small crew, arguing amicably with Liam about the best way to flash the lead on the roof, and ensuring every angle was true and every joint was perfect. He treated Jake with a new, gruff respect, consulting him on the placement of windows for the best light, and accepting the steady supply of tea and bacon sandwiches Jake provided as if it were a crucial component of the project. The extension was Alan\u2019s love language, a physical manifestation of his acceptance, a testament in timber and brick to the future of their family.\n\nMonths passed. The raw timber of the extension was clad and roofed, the seasons turned, and the hellebores bloomed, faded, and were replaced by the bright, hopeful charge of daffodils along the path. The social worker visits became less frequent, the questions less probing. They had presented their life for inspection, and all they could do now was wait for the verdict. The waiting was a unique form of quiet torture, a state of suspended animation where every ring of the phone sent a jolt of adrenaline through their systems. They tried to distract themselves, focusing on their work, on the garden, on the slow, satisfying job of plastering the interior walls of the new study and bedroom. But the unspoken question hung in the air, a constant, low-grade hum of its own. Then, one Tuesday afternoon, as they were clearing up in the garden after a day of work, the phone rang. Liam, his hands covered in mud, wiped them on his trousers and answered, putting the call on speaker. It was Sarah. Her voice was professional, but there was an unmistakable warmth in it. \u201cLiam, Jake,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m calling from the agency. We\u2019ve just had the final panel decision.\u201d Jake\u2019s heart stopped. The world seemed to fall silent, the chatter of the birds and the distant traffic noise fading to nothing. He held Liam\u2019s gaze, seeing his own mixture of terror and hope reflected there. \u201cYour application has been approved,\u201d Sarah said, her voice breaking into a smile. \u201cCongratulations. You\u2019re going to be parents.\u201d\n\nFor a moment, they just stood there, frozen, the words hanging in the quiet afternoon air. Approved. A simple, bureaucratic word that changed the entire shape of the universe. Liam\u2019s phone slipped from his muddy fingers, falling unnoticed onto the soft grass. His face crumpled, and a single, loud, ragged sob of pure, unadulterated joy broke from him. He lunged forward, wrapping his arms around Jake in a fierce, crushing embrace, burying his face in his shoulder. Jake held him, his own vision blurring, a feeling of overwhelming gratitude washing over him, so immense it felt like the Force itself was weeping with him. He could feel Liam\u2019s heart hammering against his own, a wild, joyful drumbeat. He tipped his head back, looking at the ordinary, blue English sky, and thought of the ghost-world of Alderaan, of the Jedi Temple, of the long, lonely years of his exile. All of it, all the pain and the loss, had led him here, to this moment, to this man, to this garden, to this impossible, miraculous gift. They were approved. The map they had decided to draw now had its first, real landmark. Their future had a name, and it was \u2018family\u2019.The world came back into focus slowly, pixel by pixel. The first thing Jake became aware of was the solid, shaking warmth of Liam in his arms. The second was the damp, earthy smell of the lawn, pressed into his cheek. The third was the sound of Liam\u2019s ragged, joyful sobs, muffled against the fabric of his shoulder. He held him tighter, a silent, reciprocal confirmation of the impossible news. His own tears were silent, tracking hot paths through the dust and grime on his cheeks. Through the Force, the garden seemed to sing, a vibrant, multi-layered chorus of life that had been there all along, but which he was only now hearing in its full glory. The steady, slow life-force of the old silver birch, the tenacious ambition of the roses, the quiet, underground work of the worms in the soil\u2014it all swelled into a single, triumphant symphony. They had been approved. The universe, in its strange, circuitous way, had looked at the life they had built in this small, quiet corner of the Earth, and it had approved.\n\nThey finally separated, their faces tear-streaked and ridiculously, deliriously happy. Liam, laughing through his tears, wiped a muddy hand across his face, leaving a comical smear of dirt on his forehead. Jake reached out and gently brushed it away with his thumb, the simple, tender gesture feeling more intimate than any kiss. They left the phone where it had fallen on the grass and went inside, tracking mud into the hallway without a care. They didn\u2019t speak. They just moved into the kitchen and held each other again, a long, quiet embrace in the centre of the room, swaying slightly as if in a slow dance. Later, after they had washed their faces and made a pot of tea they were too elated to drink, Liam made the second most important call of the day. He rang his father. Jake could hear Alan\u2019s booming voice, tinny through the phone\u2019s speaker, questioning and impatient at first. Then Liam said the words, \u201cJake and I have been approved. We\u2019re going to have a child.\u201d A sudden, profound silence fell on the other end of the line. When Alan finally spoke, his voice was thick, raw with an emotion Jake had never heard from him before. \u201cA grandchild,\u201d he said, the words heavy with disbelief and a deep, foundational joy. \u201cMy god, Liam. A grandchild.\u201d The architect had just been given the most important project of his life.\n\nThe waiting that followed was of a different quality. The anxious, open-ended uncertainty of the approval process was replaced by a more focused, more potent sense of anticipation. They were no longer waiting for a verdict, but for a person. The new, unfinished bedroom at the end of the hall, with its fresh plaster and smell of paint, became the focal point of their home. It was a space of pure potential, and they found themselves drawn to it, standing together in the doorway, imagining it filled with a bed, with toys, with the small, untidy chaos of a child\u2019s life. Jake, the man who had meditated in vast, empty temples and stared into the infinite blackness between stars, found a deeper sense of peace standing in that empty, sunlit room with Liam, imagining a future he had never believed he was allowed to have. Their conversations became softer, more speculative. \u201cDo you think he\u2019ll like to draw?\u201d Liam would wonder aloud. \u201cOr will she be someone who wants to kick a ball around the garden?\u201d The pronouns were fluid, the child a shimmering, undefined possibility, but the love for them was already a solid, tangible thing.\n\nThe call came on a grey Thursday morning. Sarah\u2019s voice was warm and professional as ever. \u201cWe have a possible match for you,\u201d she said. \u201cA little boy. His name is Leo. Would you be able to come into the office this afternoon to read his profile?\u201d The world tilted on its axis once again. They drove to the agency in a state of quiet, nervous reverence, as if travelling to a sacred place. They were led into a small, quiet meeting room, and Sarah slid a thin blue folder across the table towards them. It looked so innocuous, so slender, to contain the entire history of a human life. Jake\u2019s hands trembled slightly as he reached for it. He opened it, and the first thing he saw was a photograph, a slightly blurry, black-and-white school picture. A small, serious face stared back at him. A boy with large, dark, watchful eyes, a thatch of unruly dark hair, and a mouth held in a firm, unsmiling line. He was six years old.\n\nJake didn\u2019t need the Force to feel the weight of the story contained in the typed pages. The clinical, social-worker language painted a picture of profound instability: a succession of foster homes, each placement breaking down for different reasons, a history of neglect that had left him wary and withdrawn. The words \u2018struggles to form attachments\u2019 and \u2018finds it difficult to trust adults\u2019 leaped from the page, each one a small, sharp blow to Jake\u2019s heart. He could feel the spirit of the boy, not as a vision, but as a faint, flickering impression in the Force\u2014a tiny, guarded flame, accustomed to being shielded from the wind, terrified of being put out. It was a spirit that had learned, as Jake himself had once learned, that survival depends on not letting anyone get too close. The file noted his interests in a short, poignant list: drawing, building things with blocks, and watching nature documentaries. He was a quiet observer, a boy who preferred to watch the world from a safe distance.\n\nJake slid the folder across the table to Liam. He watched as his partner read, his brow furrowed in concentration. He saw Liam\u2019s expression soften as he looked at the photograph, his gaze lingering on the boy\u2019s serious, unsmiling face. Liam didn\u2019t see a list of problems or a case file of trauma. He saw a child. \u201cHe likes drawing,\u201d Liam said softly, looking up at Jake, his eyes shining with a fierce, protective light. \u201cWe can set him up a little table in the new study, by the window overlooking the garden. And building blocks. He likes building things.\u201d Liam\u2019s mind was already at work, not analyzing the past, but constructing a future. He was already building a space for this quiet, watchful boy, making a place where he could feel safe. He was already figuring out how to earn his trust. He looked at the last line of the report. \u201cHe\u2019s scared of loud noises,\u201d he murmured, and then he looked at Jake, a complete, silent understanding passing between them. They both knew a man who had chosen a life of quiet over a world of noise. They understood.\n\nThere was no discussion, no debate. There was no need. The decision had been made the moment they saw the photograph, the moment they read the story of the small, serious boy who liked to build things and was scared of loud noises. They had built a quiet harbour, a place of solid foundations and deep roots, and here was the very ship that needed to find it. Jake looked at Liam, at the absolute certainty and love in his eyes, and felt his own heart settle into a deep, unshakable resolve. This was not a strategic decision. It was not a choice weighed against probabilities or potential outcomes. It was an act of recognition. He picked up his phone and dialled Sarah\u2019s extension. When she answered, he didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cWe\u2019ve read Leo\u2019s file,\u201d Jake said, his voice clear and steady, with Liam\u2019s hand covering his on the table. \u201cThe answer is yes. A thousand times, yes.\u201d He hung up the phone and looked at his partner. A new map had been drawn, and their next destination was now marked with a name. Their journey to find Leo was about to begin.The period between saying \"yes\" and the first scheduled \"introduction\" was a new kind of waiting. It was active, focused, and filled with a quiet, purposeful energy. The empty room at the end of the hall ceased to be a space of abstract potential and became, simply, Leo's room. They painted the walls a soft, calming shade of sage green, a colour that reminded Jake of the peaceful morning light in the garden. Liam, in his element, set to work in the shed, crafting a small, sturdy desk from leftover planks of oak, its surface sanded to a silken finish. He built it low to the ground, with rounded corners, a piece of furniture that was solid and dependable, yet unintimidating. Jake\u2019s contribution was less tangible. He spent time in the room alone, not meditating in the traditional sense, but simply being present, allowing the space to absorb his own hard-won sense of peace. He gently smoothed out the psychic echoes of the room\u2019s previous life as a storage space for his grief, replacing them with a quiet, steady hum of welcome. He didn\u2019t try to fill it with joy or excitement\u2014he knew the boy was wary of loud emotions. Instead, he imbued the room with a sense of calm permission: permission to be quiet, permission to be watchful, permission to be exactly who he was, without any pressure to be anything else.\n\nThe first meeting took place on a crisp autumn afternoon in a place that felt deliberately, almost painfully, neutral. It was a designated \"contact centre,\" a building with cheerful but slightly faded posters on the walls, scuffed but brightly coloured furniture, and the faint, institutional smell of cleaning products and weak tea. Sarah greeted them at the door, her smile warm but her eyes professional. She led them to a playroom filled with durable plastic toys and a small, low table set with paper and crayons. The artificiality of the environment was jarring after the organic, lived-in peace of their own home. Jake could feel the accumulated layers of emotion in the room\u2014a faint, lingering residue of a hundred other awkward, hopeful, and painful meetings. He took a deep breath, consciously shielding himself from the noise, focusing only on the quiet strength of Liam standing beside him.\n\nWhen Leo entered the room, holding the hand of his current foster carer, he was smaller than his photograph had suggested. A small, self-contained unit of fierce vigilance. He wore a neat blue jumper and jeans, and his dark hair was brushed, but a single tuft stood up stubbornly at the back of his head. He did not look at them. His gaze was fixed firmly on the floor a few feet in front of him, his small face set in a stony, expressionless mask. He was a fortress, his walls built high and thick. Jake felt the boy\u2019s presence in the Force not as a flickering flame, but as a tightly coiled spring, a knot of fear, suspicion, and a profound, bone-deep weariness that no six-year-old should possess. It was the energy of a creature that has learned that the only safety lies in being utterly still and unnoticeable. Jake\u2019s heart contracted with a painful surge of recognition. He knew that posture. He had worn it himself for decades.\n\nSarah facilitated the introduction with a gentle, practiced ease. \u201cLeo, this is Jake, and this is Liam,\u201d she said softly. Leo gave no sign that he had heard. Jake and Liam had discussed this moment at length. Their strategy was simple: to be as unthreatening as a pair of old garden chairs. They didn\u2019t rush forward or shower him with false enthusiasm. They simply sat down at the small table, a little distance away, and Liam, with a quiet deliberation, picked up a blue crayon and a piece of paper. He didn't speak to Leo. He spoke to Jake. \u201cI was thinking about that kestrel we saw over the fields yesterday,\u201d he murmured, and began to sketch the rough, angular shape of a bird of prey. Jake just nodded, watching Liam\u2019s hand move. They were creating a small, quiet bubble of their own normal, non-demanding life, leaving the door open for Leo to peer inside if he chose, with no pressure to enter. Leo, meanwhile, had gravitated to the far corner of the room, where a large box of wooden building blocks was stored. He began to build, his small back turned resolutely towards them, his movements precise and economical. He was constructing a wall, a literal barrier between himself and the two strange men in the room.\n\nFor nearly an hour, this tableau held. The only sounds were the soft scratch of Liam\u2019s crayon on paper and the quiet, deliberate clink of Leo\u2019s wooden blocks. Jake did not try to project calm or use the Force to soothe the boy. He knew that would be an invasion, a psychic trespass on the boy\u2019s carefully constructed defences. All he could do was be calm himself, to radiate a stillness that was genuine. He sat, and he waited, and he let the boy be. Finally, Liam finished his drawing. It was a simple, powerful sketch of a kestrel hovering, its wings spread, its head cocked as if listening. He didn't offer it to Leo. He simply placed it on the edge of the table, angled slightly towards the boy\u2019s corner. He and Jake stood up, signalling to Sarah that their time was ending. As Leo\u2019s foster carer came to collect him, as they all said their quiet goodbyes, Jake saw it. Leo, who had not looked up once, let his gaze flicker for a fraction of a second towards the table. His eyes, large and dark and full of a fierce, guarded intelligence, rested on the drawing of the kestrel. It was a glance so fleeting it was almost imaginary. But it had happened. The fortress walls had not come down, but a single, curious eye had peered through a crack. It was enough. It was everything.\n\nIn the car on the way home, Liam was quiet, his hands tight on the steering wheel. \u201cHe didn\u2019t even look at us,\u201d he said finally, his voice laced with a disappointment he was trying to hide. \u201cIt was like we weren\u2019t even there.\u201d Jake reached over and placed a hand on his arm. \u201cHe saw you, Liam,\u201d he said, his own voice full of a quiet certainty. \u201cHe saw everything. He saw you not pushing him. He saw you not talking down to him. He saw you drawing a bird. And at the end, he looked at it.\u201d Liam glanced at him, a question in his eyes. \u201cThat fortress he\u2019s built,\u201d Jake continued, choosing his words carefully, \u201cit\u2019s an incredible piece of architecture. It\u2019s taken him his whole life to build it, and it\u2019s what has kept him safe. You can\u2019t expect him to tear it down in an hour because two strangers smiled at him. All we can do is sit outside the walls, quietly, and show him that it\u2019s safe to come out. And today, he looked over the wall. That\u2019s a bigger victory than you can imagine.\u201d Liam\u2019s hands relaxed on the wheel. He looked at Jake, his expression clearing as he absorbed the truth of what he was saying. He nodded slowly, a small smile touching his lips. \u201cA different kind of architecture,\u201d he said, the old phrase now taking on a new, more profound meaning. They drove the rest of the way home in a comfortable, hopeful silence, their shared purpose stronger than ever. They were not besieging a fortress; they were becoming a harbour. And they would wait, for as long as it took, for the small, wary ship to decide it was safe to come in.",

                                        "text": "The hum was back. A low, persistent thrumming at the base of his skull, a resonance that was less a sound and more a feeling, like a plucked cello string vibrating through the foundations of the house. Jake opened his eyes. The morning light, filtered through the fine-boned leaves of the silver birch at the bottom of the garden, was a pale, watery green. It was the colour of peace. The hum, however, was the colour of trouble. He\u2019d learned to differentiate the frequencies over the years. This wasn\u2019t the high, frantic whine of a distant starship battle, a ghost-memory from a life he\u2019d fought to forget. Nor was it the deep, sonorous toll of a great disturbance in the Force, the kind that heralded the fall of a Republic or the death of a star.\n\nThis was a local hum. An Epsom hum. It tasted of damp soil, exhaust fumes from the M25, and a peculiar, specific anxiety that felt entirely his own. He swung his legs out of bed, the old floorboards groaning a familiar complaint. He was a man out of time. Or perhaps, more accurately, a man out of place. The Jedi of Epsom. It sounded like a bad pub quiz team name. He\u2019d long ago traded his woven robes for soft cotton jumpers and his lightsaber for a well-oiled pair of secateurs he kept in the garden shed. The discipline remained, the connection to the great, flowing river of life that bound the galaxy together, but here, in this quiet corner of Surrey, it manifested in stranger, more terrestrial ways. He could feel the thirst of the David Austin roses, a faint, prickly desperation in their stems. He could sense the slow, methodical ambition of the bindweed as it plotted its assault on the herbaceous border. He was, to all intents and purposes, a glorified gardener with a cosmic sixth sense.\n\nWhich was why he had Liam.\n\nThe hum intensified as he walked down the stairs, his hand trailing along the cool, painted wood of the banister. He could feel the approach. Not a threat, not an enemy, but a convergence. A white Ford Transit van, its engine a rough-and-ready diesel gargle, was turning onto his street. Jake reached the kitchen just as the van pulled up, the crunch of its tyres on the gravel drive a sound more comforting to him than any temple bell. He filled the kettle, his movements economical, practiced. He didn\u2019t need to look out of the window to know that Liam was now wrestling a heavy-duty mower from the back of the van, his brow already furrowed in concentration.\n\nLiam didn\u2019t so much arrive as coalesce. He seemed to gather himself from the elements of the suburban morning\u2014the smell of cut grass, the glint of sun on a car windscreen, the quiet industry of it all. He was a man made of earth and effort. His hands, when Jake had first shaken one, were not soft, but they weren't rough either; they were simply capable, a cartography of labour etched into the palms and knuckles. He had soil under his fingernails that no amount of scrubbing could fully exorcise. Jake found it endlessly fascinating.\n\n\u201cMorning,\u201d Liam called out, his voice carrying easily through the open kitchen window. It was a voice that matched the rest of him: solid, unadorned, with a slight, pleasant rasp, as if it had been lightly sanded.\n\n\u201cMorning, Liam,\u201d Jake replied, his own voice smoother, quieter. \u201cKettle\u2019s on.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a saint, Jake. The lawn\u2019s a proper jungle this week. That fertilizer you had me put down worked a bit too well.\u201d\n\nJake smiled. He hadn't just *had* him put it down. He'd stood beside the bag of feed, closed his eyes for a moment, and pushed a little thread of warmth, of vibrant, blooming life, into the granules. A little nudge. A Jedi mind trick for ryegrass. It was cheating, but it made the garden so ridiculously, preternaturally lush that he couldn't help himself. It was his one small vanity.\n\nBy the time Liam came in, wiping his boots meticulously on the mat, Jake had two mugs of tea waiting on the worn pine of the kitchen table. One for Liam: strong, milky, two sugars. One for himself: Earl Grey, a sliver of lemon, no sugar. It was a ritual they had perfected over the past six months, a small ceremony that marked the beginning of their Tuesdays. Liam took his mug, his calloused fingers wrapping around the ceramic, and looked out at the garden.\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d he said, taking a fortifying gulp of tea. \u201cThe lawn first, I reckon. Then I\u2019ll tackle the weeds behind the shed. They\u2019re getting cheeky. And those roses of yours, the yellow ones\u2026 they\u2019re starting to look a bit leggy. Might need a prune.\u201d\n\nJake just nodded, watching him. He loved listening to Liam talk about the garden. He spoke of it not as a collection of plants, but as a community of difficult, sometimes fractious, individuals. The \u2018cheeky\u2019 weeds, the \u2018sulking\u2019 hydrangeas, the \u2018arrogant\u2019 stand of bamboo that was always trying to invade its neighbours. He gave them personality, life. He saw the garden the way Jake *felt* it.\n\nThis was the problem. This was the source of the hum.\n\nOver the past few months, the quiet appreciation Jake felt for his gardener had\u2026 changed. It had deepened, coloured, taken on a new and terrifying texture. It started as a simple admiration for his work ethic, the sheer, honest physicality of it. Then it became an appreciation for his quiet competence, the way he could diagnose a case of black spot from ten paces or identify a bird by its call. But now, it was something else. It was the way the sun caught the flecks of gold in his brown hair when he bent to pull a weed. It was the easy line of his shoulders, the focused set of his jaw. It was the moments of shared silence, when they\u2019d both just stop and look at a particularly perfect bloom, a silence that was less an absence of sound and more a presence of quiet, a shared understanding that vibrated in the space between them.\n\nThe hum was Jake\u2019s own heart, amplified by the Force until it felt like a tectonic event. The anxiety was the cold, hard certainty that this was a complication he could not afford. Jedi were not supposed to form attachments. It was the first, most fundamental rule. Attachment leads to fear, fear leads to anger, anger\u2026 well, he knew the rest of the litany. He\u2019d seen it consume friends, masters, an entire galaxy. He had fled across star systems, erased his identity, and buried himself in the most unassuming corner of the Earth he could find, all to escape that cascade. All to live a life of quiet, detached peace.\n\nAnd now here he was, on the verge of falling hopelessly in love with his gardener.\n\n\u201cSomething on your mind, Jake?\u201d Liam asked, his gaze shifting from the garden to Jake\u2019s face. He had an unnervingly direct way of looking at people, as if he were checking for aphids.\n\nJake blinked, pulling himself back from the edge of his internal monologue. \u201cJust\u2026 thinking about the roses. You\u2019re right. They are getting a bit leggy.\u201d\n\nLiam nodded, accepting the explanation, but his eyes lingered for a moment longer than was strictly necessary. A flicker of something in their depths. Curiosity? Or was Jake just projecting his own turmoil onto the man? The Force was a treacherous mirror. It could show you the truth of the universe, but it could also show you the distorted, misshapen reflection of your own desires.\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ll get to it,\u201d Liam said, draining his mug and placing it gently in the sink. \u201cShout if you need me.\u201d\n\nJake watched him go, the back door clicking shut behind him. The hum in his head didn\u2019t fade. It settled, a low and constant baseline to the morning. He stayed at the table, his own tea growing cold. He could feel Liam out in the garden. He could sense the pull of the starter cord on the mower, the sharp, decisive snip of the secateurs, the focused intent of a man at peace with his work. Each action was a small, bright spark in the living tapestry of the Force. And Jake, against all his training, against every instinct for self-preservation he had honed over a lifetime of running, found himself leaning towards those sparks. He was a moth, and Liam was a gentle, unassuming flame. And he knew, with a certainty that chilled him to the bone, that he was going to get burned.\n\nHe spent the rest of the morning trying to meditate. He sat in his worn armchair in the living room, a room filled with books and the faint scent of beeswax polish. He closed his eyes and tried to cast his senses outwards, to feel the slow turning of the planet, the distant shimmer of the sun, the vast, cold emptiness between worlds. It was a technique he\u2019d used a thousand times to dissolve his sense of self, to merge with the cosmic tide and find detachment. But today, his focus kept collapsing. The universe would shrink, again and again, from the infinite to the finite, from the cosmic down to the specific, ten-metre-by-twenty-metre patch of lawn, trees, and flowerbeds just outside his window. He could feel the distress of a worm, sliced accidentally by Liam\u2019s trowel. He could feel the sudden, bright shock of a dandelion being plucked from the earth. And through it all, the steady, rhythmic presence of Liam himself, moving through the space with a purpose that Jake envied.\n\nGiving up, he went back to the kitchen and made a fresh pot of tea. He watched Liam through the window. The man was on his knees now, working along the edge of the border, his hands, bare as always, plunged into the dark soil. He worked with a fluid, unhurried grace that was mesmerising. There was no wasted motion. It was a kind of dance, a dialogue with the earth. Jake felt a sudden, sharp pang of something he could only identify as longing. A longing to be that grounded. To have a purpose that was so clear, so tangible, that you could hold it in your hands.\n\nHis own purpose had once been clear: to serve the Republic, to keep the peace, to be a guardian of justice. But the Republic was a smear of dust in a forgotten history book. The peace had shattered. And justice\u2026 justice was a concept that seemed to change depending on which end of a blaster you were standing. His purpose now was simply to exist. To not be found. To keep the past buried.\n\nThe hum in his head spiked, and the teacup in his hand rattled against its saucer. He looked down, saw his own hand trembling slightly. A vision, unbidden, flashed behind his eyes. Not a memory, not a premonition, but something else. A flicker. A possibility. It was this garden, but years from now. The silver birch was taller, thicker. The roses had climbed all the way to the roof of the shed. And he was there, older. But he wasn\u2019t alone. Liam was there too, his hair silvered at the temples, his face lined with laughter. They were sitting on a bench that didn\u2019t exist yet, their hands intertwined. The peace was absolute.\n\nThe image was so vivid, so filled with warmth and a profound sense of rightness, that it stole his breath. It felt\u2026 real. More real than the cold teacup in his hand. The Force wasn't just showing him a desire. It was showing him a path. A future.\n\nHe shook his head, trying to clear it. It was a fantasy. A dangerous, seductive fantasy born of loneliness. He had to stop this. He had to regain control. He would be professional. He would go out, discuss the state of the delphiniums, pay Liam for his time, and retreat back into his fortress of solitude.\n\nHe opened the back door. The air smelled of chlorophyll and petrol and damp earth. \u201cLiam,\u201d he called out, his voice a little too tight.\n\nLiam looked up. He was sweating slightly, a smudge of dirt on his cheek. He smiled, a genuine, unguarded smile that crinkled the corners of his eyes. \u201cAll right, Jake? Just finishing up here. That bindweed was putting up a real fight.\u201d\n\nAnd in that moment, looking at that open, honest face, Jake\u2019s resolve crumbled into dust. All the Jedi codes, all the years of discipline, all the fear and caution, they were just words. Just echoes. The hum in his head wasn't a warning anymore. It was a song. A stupid, reckless, beautiful song.\n\n\u201cI was thinking,\u201d Jake said, the words tumbling out before he could stop them. \u201cWhen you\u2019re done. If you\u2019re not busy. Maybe you\u2019d like to stay? For dinner?\u201d\n\nLiam\u2019s smile faltered for a second, his surprise evident. He wiped a hand on his trousers, smearing them with mud. He looked from Jake\u2019s face to the house, then back again. Jake\u2019s heart hammered against his ribs. He had broken his own rules. He had opened the door. He braced himself for the polite refusal, the awkward excuse.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Liam said, a slow grin spreading across his face, transforming it. \u201cYeah, Jake. I\u2019d like that very much.\u201d"

                                        "text": "The universe, Jake decided, had a truly wicked sense of humour. For a man who had once navigated asteroid fields at impossible speeds and negotiated peace treaties on moons with three suns, the simple act of figuring out what to cook for dinner felt like a challenge of galactic proportions. He stood frozen in his kitchen, the echo of Liam\u2019s acceptance still hanging in the air like ozone after a lightning strike. His mind, once a disciplined fortress, was now a frantic mess of potential menus and their corresponding social implications. A roast was too formal. A curry was too presumptive. Fish and chips felt like a cop-out. He was overthinking it, of course. The Force, which should have been a tool for clarity and insight, was instead helpfully supplying him with a thousand different visions of social failure, each one more excruciating than the last.\n\nHe settled, finally, on pasta. It was neutral territory. It was honest. It required chopping, which he hoped would occupy his hands and stop them from trembling. He pulled onions and garlic from a basket, their papery skins cool and dry beneath his fingertips. He could feel Liam outside, the rhythm of his work subtly changing. The sharp snip of the secateurs was replaced by the softer rustle of him gathering clippings, the scrape of a trowel being cleaned, the decisive thud of the shed door being latched. Each sound was a tick of a clock, counting down to a moment Jake had both engineered and dreaded. He felt a brief, absurd urge to use the Force to hold the sun in the sky, to suspend the afternoon in amber, but the moment passed. The path was set.\n\nLiam appeared at the back door a little while later, his boots left neatly on the step. He ran a hand through his hair, dislodging a stray leaf. He looked tired, content, and just a little bit uncertain. The easy familiarity of their morning ritual had been replaced by a new, more delicate awareness. They were no longer simply employer and gardener. They were two men about to have dinner.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a shower downstairs, if you want it,\u201d Jake said, gesturing with a knife he was using to chop tomatoes. The offer felt momentous, a crossing of some invisible domestic boundary. \u201cTowels are in the cupboard under the sink.\u201d\n\nLiam\u2019s expression was one of genuine gratitude. \u201cYou\u2019re a lifesaver. I must smell like a compost heap.\u201d He disappeared down the hall, and a few minutes later, Jake heard the rush of water. The sound was unnervingly intimate. A man was showering in his house. A man whose presence made the very foundations of his hard-won peace begin to shake. Jake turned back to the tomatoes, chopping them with a fierce, focused precision. He could feel the water, warm against Liam\u2019s skin. He could sense the simple, animal pleasure of washing away the grime of a day\u2019s work. He squeezed his eyes shut for a second, pushing the sensations away. This was not meditation. This was a violation of his own privacy, and probably Liam\u2019s too.\n\nWhen Liam returned, he was wearing his work trousers but had put on a clean, grey t-shirt he must have kept in his van. His hair was damp and curled slightly at the ends. He smelled not of soil and petrol, but of Jake\u2019s own unassuming, scent-free soap. The change was subtle but profound. He was no longer a man of the garden, but a guest in the house. The hum at the base of Jake\u2019s skull softened, its anxious edge replaced by something warmer, a low, resonant thrum of approval.\n\n\u201cSmells good,\u201d Liam said, leaning against the doorframe, watching as Jake stirred a fragrant sauce of tomatoes, garlic and herbs.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just pasta,\u201d Jake said, his voice betraying none of the internal chaos he felt.\n\n\u201cNothing \u2018just\u2019 about a good pasta,\u201d Liam countered. \u201cIt\u2019s one of life\u2019s great comforts.\u201d\n\nThey ate at the kitchen table, the same worn pine that had held their morning mugs of tea. The evening light slanted through the window, turning the room gold. For a while, the only sounds were the clink of forks against ceramic and Liam\u2019s appreciative murmurs. The silence wasn\u2019t awkward. It was comfortable, the easy quiet of two people enjoying a meal. Jake found himself relaxing in a way he hadn\u2019t in years. He wasn\u2019t a Jedi in hiding. He wasn\u2019t the last survivor of a failed order. He was just Jake, a man sharing a meal with a man named Liam. It was terrifyingly simple.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got a real talent for this, you know,\u201d Liam said, gesturing to his all-but-empty plate. \u201cThe cooking. Not just the garden.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had a lot of time to practice,\u201d Jake replied, the ambiguity of the statement hanging in the air.\n\nLiam took a sip of water, his gaze steady and curious. It was the same look he\u2019d given the 'leggy' roses. \u201cSo, what did you do? Before you retired here to become a gentleman of leisure?\u201d\n\nThe question was inevitable, and Jake had his answer prepared. It was a thin, flimsy thing, a fabrication of half-truths designed to be as boring as possible. \u201cI was in logistics,\u201d he said, the word tasting like dust in his mouth. \u201cInternational shipping. Lots of spreadsheets, lots of time zones. Very dull. I was glad to give it up.\u201d\n\nHe sent a gentle, soothing pulse out with the words, a tiny Jedi suggestion to accept the answer and move on. It was a cheap trick, one he hated using, but the alternative was a truth he could never speak. Liam, however, seemed entirely unaffected. Or perhaps he simply didn\u2019t need persuading. He just nodded, his interest seemingly genuine.\n\n\u201cLogistics. Right. Must be nice, being your own boss now. Setting your own pace.\u201d He looked around the quiet kitchen. \u201cI get it. My grandad was a trucker. Drove all over Europe. When he retired, he said the best thing in the world was knowing he didn\u2019t have to go anywhere.\u201d\n\nJake\u2019s breath caught in his throat. The casual mention of driving across a continent, of a life spent in motion before finding stillness, was so unnervingly close to his own truth that he felt a jolt, as if he\u2019d touched a live wire. He felt a sudden, powerful urge to tell him everything. To talk about the starlanes instead of the motorways, of hyperspace jumps instead of ferry crossings. To explain that the quiet he sought wasn't from a career of spreadsheets, but from a galaxy of war. But he clamped down on the impulse, burying it deep. That man was dead. He had to stay dead.\n\n\u201cYour grandad sounds like a wise man,\u201d Jake said, his voice quiet.\n\n\u201cHe was a stubborn old sod,\u201d Liam said, grinning. \u201cBut yeah, he had his moments. He\u2019s the one who taught me about gardening. Said you can\u2019t understand the world until you\u2019ve put your hands in the dirt.\u201d Liam looked down at his own hands, resting on the table. The fingernails were clean now, but the lines on his palms were still etched with the memory of soil. \u201cI think he was right.\u201d\n\nJake looked at Liam\u2019s hands, then at his own. His were unscarred, the hands of a man who had wielded light and thought, not shovels and shears. He felt a pang of envy so sharp it was almost painful. Liam hadn\u2019t just found peace; he had cultivated it, grown it from the ground up. Jake had merely hidden in it. In that moment, Jake knew that the quiet, unassuming gardener sitting across from him possessed a kind of wisdom his own Jedi Masters had never taught. It was the wisdom of roots, of seasons, of staying in one place and tending to what was there. The hum in his skull shifted again, becoming a clear, single note. It was no longer anxiety, or even longing. It was recognition."

For Jake, who had spent decades honing his self-sufficiency to a fine, sharp point, the simple act of someone else washing while he dried was a profound disturbance. It was a partnership, however small and temporary, and it felt more dangerous than any duel. Solitude was his shield, a vast, empty space he had cultivated around himself. Liam\u2019s presence, his quiet competence even at the kitchen sink, was shrinking that space, replacing the sterile silence with a warm, living hum.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s see how it all looks in the evening light,\u201d Liam suggested, drying his hands on a tea towel. \u201cEverything changes when the sun goes down. The colours get deeper.\u201d\n\nJake followed him out of the back door into the gloaming. The air was cool and smelled of dampening earth and the sweet, spicy scent of the pinks lining the path. It was Liam\u2019s domain now. During the day, Jake felt the garden as a network of life force, a frantic, prickly web of needs and ambitions. But as Liam walked him through it, he began to see it through his gardener\u2019s eyes. Liam pointed to the way the silver-leafed artemisia seemed to glow, capturing the last of the light. He nudged a drooping head of an allium with a gentle finger, diagnosing its need for water with a glance. He stopped by the rose bushes he had pruned earlier.\n\n\u201cSee?\u201d Liam murmured, his voice low in the quiet air. \u201cThey look better already. Less\u2026 frantic. Sometimes you\u2019ve got to be a bit cruel to be kind. Helps them focus their energy on the good blooms, instead of wasting it on too many leaves.\u201d\n\nJake stared at the pruned roses. Liam\u2019s words resonated with a painful clarity. *Focus their energy. Stop wasting it.* It was the mantra of the Jedi Order, a lesson drilled into him since he was a boy. Yet here was the same principle, spoken not in a sterile temple hall but in a dusky English garden, applied to a plant. Liam saw it so simply. Jake had spent a lifetime trying to prune his own sprawling, chaotic emotions, and now his feelings for the man standing next to him were threatening to become a thicket of messy, untameable growth.\n\n\u201cMy dad wanted me to go into business with him,\u201d Liam said, his gaze distant, looking over the neat stripes of the lawn. \u201cHe runs a small construction firm. Good money in it. But I hated it. All noise and dust and straight lines. Nothing ever grew.\u201d He shrugged, a simple gesture that held the weight of a life-defining choice. \u201cGrandad left me his old van and his tools when he passed. Seemed like a sign. Some people thought I was mad, choosing this. But I get to make things live. It feels\u2026 real.\u201d\n\nA choice. A simple, personal choice, not one forced by war or prophecy or the grand, sweeping tides of history. Jake felt a hollow ache in his chest. He had never truly chosen his life. He had been chosen by the Force, then he had chosen to run, and then he had chosen to hide. His entire existence was a reaction, a negation. Liam\u2019s life was an affirmation.\n\n\u201cDo you have any family, Jake?\u201d Liam asked, his tone casual, but his eyes, when they turned to Jake, were anything but. They were searching, a quiet, patient inquiry.\n\nThe carefully constructed lie about logistics and spreadsheets felt like ashes in Jake\u2019s mouth. He couldn\u2019t say it again, not here, not now, with the scent of honest soil in the air and the weight of Liam\u2019s genuine curiosity upon him. He looked away, towards the dark shape of the silver birch at the end of the garden, a silent witness to his exile.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said, the single word costing him more than he could have imagined. \u201cNot anymore. I lost them. A long time ago. There was\u2026 a conflict. A political one. Things fell apart very quickly.\u201d The words were ghosts, thin and ethereal, but they held the solid, unbearable mass of his truth. The fall of the Republic, the purge of the Jedi, the slaughter of his friends, his family\u2014all of it compressed into the bland, sterile phrase \u2018a conflict\u2019. The Force around him seemed to tremble, stirred by the sudden release of a grief he had kept locked away for so long.\n\nLiam was silent for a long moment. Jake braced himself for more questions, for pity, for the awkwardness that always followed such a confession. Instead, he felt a sudden warmth on his forearm. He looked down and saw Liam\u2019s hand resting there, his fingers strong and calloused, a stark contrast to the soft cotton of Jake\u2019s jumper. The touch was not one of pity, but of solidarity. It was grounding. An anchor. It didn\u2019t try to fix anything or ask for more. It just\u2026 was. A simple, physical statement: *I am here. You are not alone in this moment.*\n\nThe hum in Jake\u2019s skull, which had been a nervous thrum all day, swelled into a powerful, resonant chord. It was no longer a warning or a song of longing. It was the feeling of a circuit being completed, of two separate points in the universe suddenly, inexplicably, connecting. Through Liam\u2019s hand, Jake could feel the man\u2019s steady heartbeat, the uncomplicated warmth of his blood, the quiet strength that came from a life lived in concert with the earth. It was a connection more profound and more real than any abstract communion with the cosmic Force.\n\nThe moment stretched, timeless. The buzz of a late bee, the distant rumble of a train, the scent of the night\u2014it all faded away, leaving only the two of them standing by the roses and the solid, irrefutable pressure of Liam\u2019s hand on his arm. He had wanted peace, detachment. He had fled across a galaxy to find it. And now he realised, with a terrifying sense of inevitability, that the very thing he had run from\u2014connection, attachment\u2014was the only thing that felt like peace at all.\n\nFinally, as if surfacing from a great depth, Liam slowly drew his hand back. The absence of his touch was a physical shock, a sudden coldness on Jake\u2019s arm. \u201cThat bindweed behind the shed,\u201d Liam said, his voice a little rough. \u201cIt\u2019ll be back next week. It always comes back. You just have to keep at it.\u201d\n\nJake understood he wasn\u2019t just talking about the weeds.\n\nThey walked back to the house in a silence that was fuller and heavier than before. When Liam stood at the door, ready to leave, the air between them was charged. The easy employer-gardener dynamic was gone, replaced by something fragile and unlabelled.\n\n\u201cThank you for dinner, Jake,\u201d Liam said, meeting his eyes. \u201cIt was really good.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you for the\u2026 garden advice,\u201d Jake replied, feeling the inadequacy of the words.\n\nA slow smile touched Liam\u2019s lips. \u201cAnytime.\u201d He paused, his hand on the doorknob. \u201cI\u2019m not working next Saturday. If you felt like cooking again\u2026 or we could get a curry from that place in the village. It\u2019s supposed to be decent.\u201d\n\nThe future. A possible future, offered up as easily as a suggestion for takeaway. The vision he\u2019d had that morning\u2014of the two of them on a bench that didn\u2019t exist yet\u2014flashed in his mind, no longer a fantasy but a tangible possibility, a door swinging open.\n\n\u201cSaturday,\u201d Jake said, his voice steadier than he felt. \u201cSaturday sounds good.\u201d\n\nLiam nodded, his smile widening just a fraction, and then he was gone, the crunch of his footsteps on the gravel fading into the night. Jake closed the door and leaned against it, the cool wood a poor substitute for the warmth of Liam\u2019s hand. He was alone in his quiet house once more, but everything had changed. The silence was no longer a refuge. It was just the space between now and Saturday. The Jedi of Epsom had spent half his life running from attachment. Now, he found himself running directly towards it. The hum was still there, a constant companion at the base of his skull, but for the first time in years, it sounded less like trouble and more like a promise."

                                        "text": "The days that followed were a study in suspended animation. The house, usually Jake\u2019s sanctuary of quiet routine, became a waiting room. The hum in his head had changed its tune. The anxious thrumming had given way to a low, continuous note of anticipation, a resonant frequency tuned precisely to the idea of \u2018Saturday\u2019. It was distracting. He would sit down to read a history of the Wars of the Roses and find himself staring at the same paragraph for ten minutes, his mind instead tracing the memory of Liam\u2019s hand on his arm. He attempted to meditate, to cast his senses out into the silent, star-dusted void, but his focus was hopelessly terrestrial. The great, flowing river of the Force, which he usually experienced as a galaxy-spanning current, now felt like it had been diverted, its powerful flow channelled into the narrow, specific geography of his own back garden. He could feel the slow, contented sigh of the pruned roses, their energy now directed and purposeful. He could sense the lingering frustration of the defeated bindweed. The garden was no longer just a collection of life-forms; it was a diary of his time with Liam.\n\nHe found himself cleaning with an uncharacteristic fervour. He polished the beeswax-scented furniture until it shone, he washed windows that were already clean, he tidied away books and papers, creating an order that bordered on the monastic. It was a nervous displacement of energy, but it was also something more. He was preparing the space, nesting. It was a primal urge he hadn\u2019t felt since he\u2019d first established this refuge, and he recognised it with a sense of detached alarm. The fortress was lowering its drawbridge. He was sweeping the courtyard for a welcome guest, not shoring up the walls against an intruder. The Jedi of Epsom was behaving less like a stoic guardian of a forgotten faith and more like a teenager expecting his first date. The thought was so absurd it made him laugh out loud in the empty hallway, a short, sharp sound that was quickly swallowed by the silence.\n\nThe most unnerving development was his own use of the Force. He\u2019d always been disciplined, using it only for the most essential tasks: maintaining the low-level perception filter that kept him anonymous, enhancing his gardening, or for the deep meditative states that kept his soul from fraying. But now, he caught himself in small, idle abuses of his power. He\u2019d be washing dishes and find himself idly levitating the cutlery to the drying rack. He\u2019d feel a sudden, sharp curiosity and almost, *almost*, cast his senses across the town to see what Liam was doing, pulling back at the last second with a jolt of shame. It was a gross violation of privacy, a temptation he hadn't faced in years. The Force was a tool for insight, not for cosmic stalking. This emotional entanglement was making him sloppy, undisciplined. The old warnings echoed in his mind\u2014*fear, anger, hate*\u2014but the litany felt hollow. The feeling that drove him wasn\u2019t fear, it was a terrifying, exhilarating hope.\n\nOn Saturday morning, the hum was a palpable vibration, a physical presence in the room. It was the colour of a clear blue sky, the taste of ozone before a summer storm. Jake stood in front of his wardrobe, utterly adrift. His clothes were a uniform of invisibility: soft grey jumpers, dark, nondescript trousers, faded blue shirts. They were the colours of shadow and anonymity. He had spent decades learning how to not be seen. Now, for the first time, he wanted to be seen, truly seen, by one specific person, and he had no idea how to dress for the occasion. He eventually settled on a dark green linen shirt he\u2019d bought on a rare trip into town and forgotten about. It felt strange, the fabric crisper, the colour more definite than his usual attire. It felt like a statement. He wasn't sure what the statement was, but he was making it.\n\nHe spent the afternoon in a state of low-grade panic, culminating in him standing in the kitchen at six o\u2019clock, staring at the phone number for the curry house as if it were a complex stellar chart. The act of making the call felt like launching a starship. When a cheerful voice answered on the other end, he almost hung up. He managed to place the order\u2014one chicken korma, one lamb bhuna, pilau rice, and a peshwari naan, a selection he\u2019d made after a ridiculous amount of internal debate\u2014his voice sounding unnaturally formal. The entire exchange left him feeling as drained as if he\u2019d just negotiated a ceasefire.\n\nHe heard the crunch of tyres on the gravel drive at precisely seven. It was a different sound from the Transit van\u2019s utilitarian rumble. Softer, lighter. He looked out of the living room window and saw a dark blue, slightly battered hatchback he\u2019d never seen before. Liam got out. He wasn't wearing his work clothes. He was in dark jeans and a simple, well-fitting blue shirt that made the brown of his arms look richer. He looked younger without the patina of soil and sweat, and somehow more solid. He was carrying a bottle of wine. The sight was so utterly, disarmingly normal that Jake\u2019s heart gave a painful lurch. This was real. This was happening. The hum in his skull crescendoed, a bright, clear bell marking the moment of arrival.\n\nWhen Jake opened the door, Liam smiled, and the slight nervousness Jake saw in his eyes was so reassuring it almost made him dizzy. He wasn\u2019t the only one stepping onto new ground.\n\n\u201cEvening,\u201d Liam said, holding up the bottle. \u201cI brought wine. I\u2019ve no idea if it\u2019s any good. The label had a bird on it. I like birds.\u201d\n\nJake took the bottle, his fingers brushing Liam\u2019s. A spark, bright and warm, shot up his arm. \u201cA bird is an excellent reason to choose a wine,\u201d he said, his own smile feeling more natural than it had all week. \u201cCome in. I\u2019ve ordered from the place in the village. They said about half an hour.\u201d\n\nThe house seemed to embrace Liam\u2019s presence. He looked around the tidy living room, his eyes taking in the shelves of books, the worn armchair, the lack of a television. \u201cIt\u2019s a lovely room,\u201d he said. \u201cProper peaceful.\u201d\n\nPeaceful. The word he had chased across the galaxy, and here it was, being offered back to him by his gardener, who had no idea of the irony. Jake busied himself opening the wine, the familiar ritual a comfort. He poured them both a glass, the pale gold liquid catching the evening light. They stood in the kitchen, not quite knowing where to put themselves. The space that had been so functional and familiar was now a stage.\n\n\u201cSo,\u201d Liam began, leaning back against the counter, \u201cno lawn to mow today. What does the gentleman of leisure do on his days off?\u201d\n\nJake took a sip of wine. It was crisp and dry. \u201cA lot of reading,\u201d he said, gesturing vaguely towards the living room. \u201cAnd I potter. I\u2019m not as skilled as you, but I try to keep the weeds from staging a full-scale rebellion between your visits.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen you,\u201d Liam said, a gentle tease in his voice. \u201cWatching the roses. You look like you\u2019re having a very serious conversation with them.\u201d\n\nJake\u2019s breath hitched. He did have conversations with them, in a way. He felt their thirst, their diseases, their slow, determined reach for the sun. \u201cThey\u2019re very demanding,\u201d he managed, hoping it sounded like a joke.\n\nLiam\u2019s smile softened. He looked at Jake, his gaze direct and unnervingly perceptive. \u201cYou\u2019re a very quiet bloke, Jake. You\u2019ve got this\u2026 stillness about you. Like you\u2019re listening for something no one else can hear.\u201d\n\nThe hum in Jake\u2019s head flared, a sudden, sharp spike of alarm. He was being seen. He was being read. The anonymity he had cultivated for so long was as flimsy as a cobweb. Liam wasn\u2019t just looking at him; he was perceiving him, with an intuition that had nothing to do with the Force and everything to do with the quiet, empathetic wisdom of a man who understood living things. Jake took another, larger sip of wine, the cold liquid doing little to quell the heat rising in his chest. This was far more dangerous than any distant starship battle. This was a close-quarters engagement, and all his defences were starting to fail."

The doorbell. He had never been so grateful for an interruption in his entire, long life. It was a reprieve, a deus ex machina in the form of a takeaway delivery driver.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019ll be dinner,\u201d he said, his voice emerging steadier than he felt. He placed his wine glass on the counter with exaggerated care and moved towards the hall, the short walk a welcome chance to reassemble his shattered composure. He paid the driver, the mundane transaction of exchanging cash for a fragrant paper bag feeling surreal. He was a man who had faced down Sith Lords, and he was currently being saved from a conversation by a chicken korma.\n\nWhen he returned to the kitchen, Liam hadn't moved, but the intensity in his gaze had softened. He watched as Jake unpacked the foil containers onto the counter, the steam that puffed out releasing a rich cloud of spice, coconut, and tomato that instantly filled the room. The scent was warm, complex, and deeply comforting. It smelled of life, of a world that continued turning, blissfully unaware of Jedi or lost Republics.\n\n\u201cRight, let\u2019s see what we\u2019ve got,\u201d Liam said, his voice back to its easy, affable tone. He peered at the containers. \u201cIs that a bhuna? Good man. You can\u2019t trust someone who doesn\u2019t like a bit of spice.\u201d\n\nThey transferred the food to plates, moving around each other in the small space with an easy, unforced grace. The tension had been broken, but its ghost remained. The question Liam had asked still hung in the air, unanswered, absorbed into the spicy steam and the golden light of the kitchen. They carried their plates back to the worn pine table, the setting for all their pivotal moments, and for a few minutes, they simply ate. The curry was good, the flavours bold and distinct. Jake found himself eating with a genuine appetite, the warmth of the food a welcome counterpoint to the nervous chill that had settled deep in his bones.\n\n\u201cThis is worlds better than my usual Saturday night takeaway,\u201d Liam said after a while, scooping up a piece of lamb with a shard of naan bread. \u201cWhich is usually a pizza I eat out of the box while watching old episodes of Time Team.\u201d\n\nJake smiled, a genuine, relaxed smile this time. The image was so perfectly, wonderfully mundane. \u201cI\u2019m guessing you\u2019re a fan of digging.\u201d\n\n\u201cObsessed,\u201d Liam admitted without a trace of embarrassment. \u201cAlways have been. It\u2019s the same as gardening, really. Just a different timescale. Trying to understand a place by what\u2019s buried underneath. Reading the story in the soil.\u201d He paused, his expression turning thoughtful. \u201cI nearly went to university to study archaeology. But my dad\u2026 he had other ideas. The construction business. Said there was no money in digging up old pots.\u201d\n\nThe familiar story, the one he\u2019d alluded to in the garden, returned with more detail, more weight. The conflict between a parent's practical ambition and a child\u2019s deeper calling. It was a tale as old as time, played out in a million different ways across a million different worlds. Jake had seen it end in feuds that sundered families, and in rebellions that toppled planetary governments. Here, in Epsom, it had ended with Liam choosing a life of soil and quiet satisfaction over his father\u2019s world of concrete and commerce.\n\n\u201cHe wasn\u2019t wrong about the money,\u201d Liam continued with a wry grin. \u201cBut he was wrong about everything else. I spent six months on a building site with him after I left school. It was the loudest, most miserable time of my life. Everything was about destroying what was there to make way for something new. No patience. No listening.\u201d He looked up from his plate and met Jake\u2019s eyes, and Jake knew the word was deliberate. \u201cI\u2019d rather spend a day figuring out why a rose is unhappy than lay a hundred perfect bricks.\u201d\n\nThe hum returned, a deep, cello-string thrum of profound empathy. Jake felt an overwhelming urge to reach across the table, to place his hand over Liam\u2019s, to say *I understand*. The Jedi had been builders, of a sort. They had built peace, built alliances, built an Order on millennia of tradition. And he had watched it all get torn down, replaced by something loud and brutal and impatient. He felt a kinship with this man that went far beyond a shared appreciation for a well-tended garden. Liam hadn't just chosen a different career path; he had chosen a different philosophy, a way of being that Jake recognised as a fundamental truth.\n\n\u201cIt takes a certain kind of courage,\u201d Jake said, his voice low and earnest, \u201cto choose to listen instead of shout.\u201d\n\nLiam\u2019s gaze softened, a flicker of surprise in his eyes at the gravity of Jake\u2019s tone. He seemed to understand that Jake wasn\u2019t just making a casual observation. He was affirming Liam\u2019s entire life, the very core of his identity. He held Jake\u2019s gaze for a long moment, the space between them shrinking until the kitchen, the house, the entire world outside seemed to fall away, leaving only the two of them at the table, surrounded by the scent of spice and a shared, unspoken understanding.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Liam said finally, his voice slightly hoarse. \u201cWell. It\u2019s a quieter life, anyway.\u201d He tore off another piece of bread, but didn\u2019t eat it, just rolled it between his fingers. \u201cSo, your logistics job. All that international shipping. You must have seen a lot of places.\u201d The question was a gentle probe, an invitation for Jake to share a piece of his own story, to reciprocate the honesty he had been given. \u201cAny favourites?\u201d"

                                        "text": "The question, innocent as it was, landed with the weight of a tribunal. *Any favourites?* It was a simple inquiry, a standard piece of get-to-know-you conversation, but for Jake it was a demand for a past he didn\u2019t have. His fabricated career in logistics was a flimsy stage flat, and Liam was asking to see what was behind it. He could name a city\u2014Singapore, perhaps, or Hamburg\u2014and invent a few plausible details about container ports and bustling markets. The Jedi training had included infiltration and deception; he was more than capable of crafting a convincing lie. But the words wouldn't come. To lie now, after Liam had so openly shared the story of his own quiet rebellion, felt like a profound disrespect. It felt like putting a weed back in the soil he\u2019d just so carefully cleared.\n\nHe took a slow breath, letting the wine rest on his tongue. The hum in his head was a low, insistent thrum, urging him not to retreat, not to close the door he had so tentatively opened. He decided to walk a tightrope. He would tell the truth, but he would speak it in a language Liam might understand, a language of feeling and landscape, stripped of its alien names and impossible context. He set his glass down and looked not at Liam, but at the darkening window, as if seeing the reflection of his memories there.\n\n\u201cThere was one place,\u201d he began, his voice softer than before, \u201ca city built in the mountains. The peaks were so high they scraped a sky that wasn't quite blue, more of a soft violet. The buildings weren't built on the land so much as with it. They followed the curve of the canyons, nestled into the cliffsides like swallows' nests made of white stone and glass. There was a university there, a place of quiet learning. The air\u2026 it always tasted clean, like cold water.\u201d He paused, the ghost of Alderaan a sharp, beautiful ache in his memory. \u201cIt was beautiful. Orderly. It felt like what peace was supposed to look like.\u201d\n\nHe shifted his gaze, another memory rising, darker and more overwhelming. \u201cBut most of my time was spent at the central hub. A city that covered an entire world. There was no day or night, just a constant, managed twilight. Traffic moved in rivers of light, stacked a hundred levels deep. You could live your whole life there and never see the ground, never feel rain on your skin. The sound was\u2026 constant. Not loud, just a perpetual hum. The combined energy of a trillion lives, all moving, all wanting something. You were never alone, but you were lonelier than you could ever imagine. It was the colour of ambition, and it tasted like metal.\u201d\n\nHe fell silent, the memories receding, leaving him back at the pine table in his quiet Surrey kitchen. He had said too much. The descriptions were too strange, too poetic for a man who supposedly dealt in shipping manifests. He had revealed the edges of his alien past, and he waited for Liam to pull away, to ask the questions he couldn't possibly answer. He risked a glance at him. Liam was perfectly still, his fork resting on his plate, his curry forgotten. He wasn\u2019t looking at Jake with confusion, but with a startling, intense empathy. He hadn\u2019t heard the words of a logistics manager; he had heard the confession of a refugee.\n\n\u201cAfter a while,\u201d Jake finished, his voice barely a whisper, \u201cI just wanted to see the same sky every day. I wanted to know a piece of ground so well that I could feel when it was thirsty. I wanted to hear silence.\u201d He gestured vaguely around the room, at the quiet house, the dark garden beyond the glass. \u201cThis is the opposite of all that. It\u2019s small, and it\u2019s real. That\u2019s all I wanted.\u201d\n\nLiam let out a slow breath, the sound loud in the quiet room. He picked up his wine glass, turning it in his hands, watching the light play in the liquid. He didn\u2019t ask where these impossible cities were. He didn\u2019t question the strangeness of the descriptions. He accepted the emotional truth of the story as if it were the most natural thing in the world. He understood the story of a man who had seen too much and had come seeking a place to heal.\n\n\u201cSounds like you earned your quiet,\u201d Liam said finally. His voice was gentle, and it held a universe of acceptance. He looked up and met Jake\u2019s eyes, and in their depths, Jake saw no suspicion, only a profound, heart-stopping understanding. \u201cNo wonder you talk to the roses. You\u2019re probably just glad they don\u2019t talk back.\u201d\n\nA small laugh escaped Jake\u2019s lips, a sound of pure, unadulterated relief. It felt as if a heavy cloak he hadn\u2019t even realised he was wearing had just slipped from his shoulders. He hadn't been exposed; he had been seen. And he hadn't been judged. Liam\u2019s simple, intuitive grasp of his story was a greater gift than he could have imagined. The hum at the base of his skull resolved into a single, warm, steady note of pure contentment. It was the colour of peace, after all. But it was no longer the pale, watery green of solitude. It was the deep, rich gold of the wine in their glasses, of the light in the kitchen, of a shared and welcome silence."

                                        "text": "The silence that greeted Jake on Sunday morning was a different creature entirely. Before, silence had been a defensive wall, a vast emptiness he patrolled to ensure no echoes of his past could find purchase. Now, it was an echo chamber of a different sort. It held the ghost of Liam\u2019s laughter, the lingering scent of spices in the air, the sight of the empty wine bottle standing sentinel on the counter like a small, glass trophy. He had broken the most fundamental rule of his exile, the cardinal tenet of the Jedi Order itself, and the sky had not fallen. The Force had not recoiled in horror. Instead, the world seemed to have shifted into a higher resolution, the watery green light of the garden more vibrant, the birdsong in the silver birch more intricate. The hum was still there, a soft, unwavering note at the base of his skull, but its character was transformed. It was no longer the colour of trouble or anxiety; it was the colour of a quiet, sunlit room, the colour of a future he had never dared to imagine.\n\nHe spent the day in a state of suspended bliss, a feeling so alien he kept examining it for traps. He walked through the garden, his fingers brushing the leaves of the David Austin roses, and felt not just their life force but the memory of Liam\u2019s hands tending to them. The garden was no longer just his refuge; it was a shared space, a living testament to their nascent connection. The Jedi litanies, however, were persistent ghosts. *Attachment leads to fear.* The words coiled in the back of his mind, a conditioned response honed over a lifetime. He paused, his hand on a pruned rose stem, and honestly examined his own heart. Was he afraid? A profound, bone-deep terror bloomed in his chest. But it was not the cold, possessive fear of loss the Jedi Masters had warned against. It was not the fear of what losing Liam would do to *him*. It was the warm, terrifying, fiercely protective fear of anything ever happening to Liam at all. It was a selfless fear, an outward-facing concern, and he wondered, with a jolt that shook him, if the old masters, in their wisdom, had gotten it wrong. Perhaps they had mistaken the symptom for the disease. Perhaps the problem wasn't attachment itself, but the selfishness that so often poisoned it.\n\nBy Tuesday morning, the gentle hum of contentment had modulated into a bright, eager thrum of anticipation. The familiar rumble of the white Ford Transit turning onto his street was no longer just a sound; it was the opening note of a symphony. Jake filled the kettle, his movements economical as always, but his heart was a frantic, joyful drum against his ribs. He felt Liam\u2019s presence through the Force, not as a vague convergence, but as a distinct, cherished signature. He sensed the familiar furrow of concentration on Liam\u2019s brow as he unlatched the van, the satisfying heft of a tool in his capable hands, the simple, earthy peace that surrounded him like an aura. Jake no longer felt like a man out of place, but a man waiting for the other half of a landscape to arrive.\n\n\u201cMorning,\u201d Liam called through the open window, and the single word was imbued with all the warmth and understanding of their Saturday dinner. There was a new intimacy in his smile, a private knowledge that passed between them, rendering the suburban morning scene suddenly sacred. He came inside, wiping his boots on the mat, and the kitchen seemed to shrink, to become more concentrated and real around him. Jake handed him the mug of tea\u2014strong, milky, two sugars\u2014and their fingers brushed. The contact was brief, accidental, but it sent a jolt of pure energy through Jake, bright and clean as a lightsaber\u2019s beam.\n\n\u201cThe lawn can wait a bit,\u201d Liam said, taking a sip of his tea and leaning against the counter. He didn\u2019t look out at the garden as he usually did. He looked at Jake. \u201cSaturday was\u2026 good. I enjoyed it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI did too,\u201d Jake replied, his voice quiet but firm. \u201cMore than I can say.\u201d The confession hung in the air, a small, brave flag planted in this new territory. He watched as Liam processed it, saw the slight softening of his shoulders, the gentle curve of his lips.\n\n\u201cYour stories,\u201d Liam said, his voice dropping a little. \u201cThe city that was all metal and ambition. I think my dad would have liked a place like that.\u201d There was no judgment in his tone, only a quiet musing, a connecting of the dots between their two very different worlds. \u201cI\u2019m glad you found your quiet corner here instead.\u201d He took another fortifying gulp of tea, then placed the mug on the counter with a soft click. \u201cRight. I should probably make a start. Those cheeky weeds won\u2019t pull themselves.\u201d\n\nHe turned to go, and Jake felt a sudden, sharp pang of loss at the thought of the moment ending. The old, cautious Jake would have let him go, retreating back into the safety of distance. The new Jake, the one who had shared a curry and a truth, stepped forward. \u201cLiam,\u201d he said, the name a tangible thing in the quiet kitchen. Liam paused at the door, turning back. \u201cThat vision I had,\u201d Jake began, the word \u2018vision\u2019 feeling both ridiculously grandiose and perfectly accurate. \u201cThe one of the garden, years from now. With the bench.\u201d\n\nLiam\u2019s expression was unreadable for a moment, a flicker of surprise followed by a dawning awareness. He had shared a vision, a fantasy, and was laying it at Liam\u2019s feet, making it real. A slow, wonderful smile spread across Liam\u2019s face, crinkling the corners of his eyes. He didn't question it. He didn't ask for an explanation. He simply stepped back into the kitchen and walked to the window, looking out at the garden with a new, speculative eye.\n\n\u201cThe silver birch,\u201d Liam said, his voice full of a sudden, thoughtful authority, as if they were discussing a real architectural plan. He pointed with his chin towards the bottom of the garden. \u201cYou\u2019d want it there. Just to the left of the birch. It\u2019d catch the last of the evening sun in the summer, but it would be sheltered from the wind. It\u2019s the best spot in the whole garden.\u201d He turned back to Jake, his eyes shining with a mixture of amusement and something far deeper, something that looked unmistakably like affection. \u201cWe\u2019d need to build a proper stone base for it, though. Make sure it\u2019s level. Make sure it lasts.\u201d"

                                        "text": "Liam\u2019s words landed in the quiet kitchen not as a suggestion, but as a statement of fact. A plan already in motion. For a man who had spent decades living in the ephemeral realms of visions and premonitions, the sheer, solid practicality of Liam\u2019s response was a revelation. The Force could show you a thousand possible futures, shimmering and uncertain as heat haze, but it took a man with soil under his fingernails to point to a spot on the lawn and say, *here*. It was the most romantic thing Jake had ever heard. The hum in his skull, the lifelong companion he had learned to interpret as a barometer of cosmic events, settled into a mode he had never before experienced: purpose. It was no longer a signal to be deciphered or a warning to be heeded; it was the quiet, powerful thrum of an engine that had just been engaged.\n\nThe rest of that Tuesday morning was lost to the most exciting logistical planning of Jake\u2019s terrestrial life. The lawn was forgotten, the weeds granted a temporary reprieve. Instead, they sat at the kitchen table, the half-empty mugs of tea pushed to one side, while Liam sketched on the back of a discarded seed packet. His pencil, thick and stubby, moved with a surprising deftness, transforming the flimsy paper into a blueprint. He spoke of mortise and tenon joints, of the virtues of oak for its strength and longevity versus teak for its natural oils and resistance to the damp English climate. He talked about the angle of the backrest, the gentle curve needed to make it comfortable for hours of sitting, the ideal height from the ground. Jake listened, utterly captivated. He had once sat in council chambers where the fates of star systems were debated, but none of it had ever felt as real or as vital as this. His own contributions were less practical, more atmospheric. \u201cIt should feel like it grew here,\u201d he\u2019d said, and Liam, without looking up from his drawing, had simply nodded. \u201cI know what you mean. Not something plonked down. Something that belongs.\u201d\n\nThe project took on a life of its own, a third presence in their burgeoning relationship. It became the reason for phone calls that stretched beyond scheduling lawn maintenance, and for a trip the following Saturday, not to the curry house, but to a sprawling reclamation yard a few towns over. The yard was a chaotic boneyard of architecture, a jumble of forgotten histories. There were stacks of weathered roof tiles, forests of spindly iron railings, and rows of stone-mullioned windows staring out like sightless eyes. To Jake, it was a cacophony in the Force, each object humming with the faint, residual echoes of the lives it had witnessed. He could feel the warmth of a hundred summer evenings in a set of old terracotta pots, the faint, lingering arguments that had taken place in front of a marble fireplace, the childish joy of a game of hide-and-seek played around a stone birdbath. It was overwhelming, a library of emotions with no catalogue.\n\nLiam, however, navigated the chaos with the calm assurance of a librarian in his own domain. He was not sensing the past; he was looking for potential. He ran his capable hands over piles of gritstone and Yorkstone flags, judging their texture, their thickness, their character. \u201cYou don\u2019t want anything too new or perfect,\u201d he explained, rejecting a pallet of pristine, machine-cut pavers. \u201cYou want something that already knows how to be still. Something that\u2019s felt a bit of weather.\u201d He finally settled on a small stack of flagstones, their surfaces worn smooth by a century of footsteps, their edges softened by rain and frost. A faint tracery of moss was etched into the grain of one, a delicate, living map. As they loaded the heavy stones into the back of Liam\u2019s hatchback, Jake felt their solid, steady presence through the Force\u2014a quiet, grounding energy. They were not just building materials; they were anchors, chosen together to hold their shared future to the earth.\n\nThe real work began the next weekend. The sun was a soft, forgiving gold in a hazy sky as Liam marked out a perfect rectangle on the lawn with string and pegs. He stripped away the turf with a sharp spade, revealing the dark, rich soil beneath. He worked with a fluid, economical rhythm that was mesmerising to watch, a dialogue between muscle and earth. Jake, feeling large and clumsy in comparison, stood by with a wheelbarrow, his own purpose unclear. He had commanded troops, faced down assassins, and channelled the energy of a star, but he had no idea how to be useful in the face of honest manual labour. \u201cRight then,\u201d Liam said, straightening up with a grin, sweat beading on his brow. \u201cYour turn. Let\u2019s see what all that book-reading has done for your back.\u201d\n\nHe passed Jake the spade, and Jake took it, the smooth, worn wood of the handle unfamiliar in his grasp. His first few attempts were awkward, jarring his shoulders, the blade skittering off the compacted earth. Liam didn\u2019t laugh. He came and stood behind Jake, his body close, his hand closing over Jake\u2019s on the handle. \u201cDon\u2019t fight it,\u201d he said, his voice a low rumble near Jake\u2019s ear. \u201cUse your weight. Let the tool do the work.\u201d He guided Jake through the motion\u2014the press of the foot, the lean of the body, the satisfying slice as the spade sank into the soil. The warmth of Liam\u2019s body, the solid presence of his hand, the simple, patient instruction\u2014it was an intimacy more profound than any kiss. In that moment, Jake was not an exiled Jedi Master; he was just a man, learning a new way to interact with the world from someone he was beginning to love.\n\nAs the day wore on, Jake found his own way to contribute. While Liam, on his knees, began to mix sand and cement in the wheelbarrow, a task he performed with the focused intensity of an alchemist, Jake was tasked with moving the heavy flagstones into position. He stooped to lift the first one, feeling its true, back-straining weight. Then, glancing to make sure Liam was preoccupied, he closed his eyes for a fraction of a second. He didn't think, he just *reached*. He extended a thread of the Force, wrapping it around the stone, not to levitate it, but simply to lighten it, to take the burden of its inertia from his own muscles. He lifted it with an ease that felt like cheating, carrying it over to the excavated rectangle and lowering it gently into place. \u201cBlimey, you\u2019re stronger than you look,\u201d Liam commented without turning around, mistaking Jake\u2019s cosmic assistance for simple physical strength. A thrill, sharp and bright, shot through Jake. It was a secret act of partnership, a small, hidden use of his old life in service of his new one. He was using the Force not to move starships, but to build a foundation for a garden bench, and it felt more significant than any battle he had ever fought.\n\nThey worked in a comfortable, productive silence, punctuated by the scrape of the trowel and the soft thud of stone settling into place. At one point, kneeling side-by-side to check the level, their shoulders brushed. The contact was brief, but the world seemed to narrow to that single point, a conduit for a current of warmth and unspoken affection that flowed between them. They were smudged with dirt, tired, their muscles aching, but as Jake looked at Liam\u2019s focused profile, the smudge of cement on his cheek, the determination in his eyes, the hum in his head became a quiet, perfect chord of rightness. This, he thought. This is what it means to build something. Not a Republic, not an Order, but something small and solid and real. Something that would last."

                                        "text": "The sun had bled into a soft, bruised purple at the horizon by the time the last stone was settled. They were filthy, streaked with sweat and cement dust, and every one of Jake\u2019s muscles, particularly the ones he hadn\u2019t used in thirty years, sang a low, aching protest. They sat on the back step, side-by-side, their shoulders not quite touching, nursing tall glasses of cold water that Jake had fetched from the kitchen. The new stone plinth at the bottom of the garden was a dark, solid rectangle in the gloaming, a patch of absolute certainty on the fading lawn. It was, Jake thought, the most beautiful thing he had ever helped to create. He had once helped broker the treaty that shaped the Outer Rim trade lanes, a delicate, complex web of diplomacy that had brought peace for a generation. It had been shattered and forgotten in less than a year. This small, stone foundation felt infinitely more permanent.\n\nLiam let out a long, weary sigh of satisfaction, stretching his legs out in front of him. \u201cGood day\u2019s work,\u201d he murmured, his voice rough with tiredness. He glanced sideways at Jake, a tired but genuine smile on his face. \u201cYou\u2019re not bad with a spade, for a logistics man. We\u2019ll make a proper gardener of you yet.\u201d Jake just smiled, a real, unguarded smile that reached his eyes. He felt a profound sense of pride in his aching back and his dirt-caked hands. He had participated. He had not just observed or nudged things with an invisible power; he had put his own physical self into the world, and the world had pushed back. The exchange felt more honest than any conversation he had ever had.\n\nThe next stage of the project required a different kind of expertise. The following week, Liam drove them to a timber yard tucked away in the folds of the Surrey Hills. It was a vast, cavernous place that smelled overwhelmingly of resin, sawdust, and time. Huge, rough-sawn trunks were stacked like fallen gods in one corner, while in the main building, planks of wood from all over the world were racked in towering aisles. Jake felt the Force here not as a clamour of human emotion, but as a deep, slow, sonorous hum of organic life, arrested and waiting. He could feel the memory of sunlight in a plank of pale ash, the patient, century-long thirst of a great oak, the hurried, jungle-drenched growth of a piece of teak. He ran his hand over a slab of dark, dense wood, and the Force gave him a fleeting, dizzying impression of deep, slow-moving rivers, of chattering, unseen creatures, of a heat so profound it was almost a liquid. He pulled his hand back as if burned.\n\nLiam, meanwhile, was in his element. He moved through the aisles with a reverence that bordered on religious, his hands stroking the wood, his eyes reading the intricate patterns of the grain as if they were maps. He explained to Jake the difference between quarter-sawn and plain-sawn oak, the way the grain would affect not just the look of the bench, but its strength, its resistance to warping over the years. He was not just choosing lumber; he was selecting a collaborator, a piece of ancient, living history that would agree to become a part of their small future. \u201cThis one,\u201d he said finally, his hand resting on a stack of thick, honey-coloured oak planks. They were heavy, dense, and smelled faintly of vanilla and earth. \u201cIt\u2019s English oak. Grown slow, so the grain\u2019s tight. It\u2019s got character.\u201d He traced a dark, swirling knot in the wood with his finger. \u201cIt\u2019s lived a life. It\u2019ll know how to sit still in a garden.\u201d\n\nJake\u2019s garden shed, once a place of solitary pottering, became their workshop. The familiar scent of oil, petrol, and stored fertiliser was soon overlaid with the sharp, clean fragrance of freshly sawn oak. Liam brought his own tools, instruments of a quality and precision that spoke of a deep respect for his craft. They were a world away from the mass-produced implements of a galactic army; each chisel, each plane, each handsaw was perfectly balanced, its wooden handle worn smooth and dark with years of use, shaped to the curve of his hand. They worked mostly in the evenings and on the weekend, the quiet industry of their labour becoming the new rhythm of Jake\u2019s life. The rasp of a saw cutting through timber, the whisper of a hand-plane shaving off a perfect, paper-thin curl of wood, the gentle tap of a mallet on a chisel\u2014these sounds became more comforting to Jake than any temple chant.\n\nThey fell into a natural division of labour. Liam, the master craftsman, would perform the intricate work of cutting the joints, his focus absolute, his movements a study in contained force and precision. Jake became his apprentice, tasked with sanding the cut pieces, his hands learning the changing texture of the wood as he worked it from rough-sawn coarseness to a surface as smooth and lustrous as silk. As he worked, rubbing the sandpaper back and forth along the grain, he found a meditative rhythm. He could feel the life in the wood beneath his fingers, a slow, deep pulse. And he could feel Liam, a steady, warm presence just a few feet away. He didn't need the Force to know where the man was, to sense his mood from the pressure of his plane or the cadence of his breathing. The shed, once a fortress of solitude, had become the most populated, most alive place in his world.\n\nOne evening, as the light outside began to fail, they paused in their work. Liam was running a cloth over a newly-cut tenon, his expression one of deep concentration. \u201cIt\u2019s funny,\u201d he said, not looking up. \u201cMy dad\u2019s still on at me. Says I\u2019m wasting my life making garden furniture when I could be project managing a new build. Says I should be building things that scrape the sky.\u201d He finally looked at Jake, a wry, searching look in his eyes. \u201cYou talked about that city\u2026 the one that was all metal and ambition. I get the feeling you spent a lot of time in places like that. Trying to hold it all together.\u201d\n\nThe perception, as always, was so accurate it stole Jake\u2019s breath. He stopped his sanding, the silence in the shed suddenly deep and profound. He looked at the piece of smooth, warm oak in his hands. \u201cI did,\u201d he admitted, his voice quiet. \u201cMy work\u2026 it was about maintenance. Trying to repair a structure that was fundamentally unsound. It was very large, very old, and very important to a lot of people. But the foundations were rotten. We spent all our time fixing the cracks on the surface, polishing the facade, but we were too afraid to look at what was happening underneath.\u201d He took a breath, the confession feeling like a pressure valve being released. \u201cIn the end, it all came down. It wasn't a gentle decline. It was a collapse. Fast, and brutal. I learned that some things, no matter how much you love them, cannot be saved. You can only save yourself.\u201d\n\nHe had never spoken of it so plainly. He looked at Liam, expecting to see confusion, but instead saw only quiet, compassionate recognition. Liam put down the joint he was working on and wiped his hands on a rag. \u201cSounds like dry rot,\u201d he said, his voice soft. \u201cYou can patch it, you can paint over it, but if it\u2019s in the main beams, the whole house is compromised. Sometimes the only thing to do is pull it down and start again. Or walk away and build something smaller. Something you can trust. Something with a solid foundation.\u201d He gestured with his head towards the garden, where their stone plinth sat waiting. The metaphor was so simple, so perfect, it brought a lump to Jake\u2019s throat. Liam didn't need to know about Republics or Sith Lords. He understood dry rot. He understood foundations. He understood everything that mattered.\n\nThe day they finished it, the sky was a high, brilliant blue. The bench was a masterpiece. Liam had assembled it with a craftsman\u2019s love, the joints so tight they seemed to have grown that way, the long, elegant sweep of the back and arms a perfect invitation. It was heavy, a solid, tangible piece of their shared effort. Together, they carried it from the shed, Jake taking his end with no need for any secret assistance from the Force. He wanted to feel its full weight, the honest burden of its reality. They manoeuvred it through the back door and across the lawn to the waiting plinth. It settled onto the stones with a soft, definitive thud, as if it were breathing out, finally home.\n\nThey stood back, side-by-side, and looked at it. It was perfect. It sat as if it had been there for a hundred years, the warm, honey-coloured oak glowing in the afternoon sun, the dark green of the garden a perfect frame around it. It looked like it belonged. It looked like peace. \u201cWe did it,\u201d Liam said, his voice quiet, filled with a pride that was mirrored in Jake\u2019s own chest. He turned to Jake, and the tired, triumphant smile on his face was the most beautiful thing Jake had ever seen. The sounds of the neighbourhood, a distant lawnmower, the cry of a child, all of it faded away. The universe shrank to the space between them, charged and silent. The hum in Jake\u2019s head, the constant companion of his long, lonely life, finally, for the first time he could remember, went completely still. It was replaced by a silence so profound, so full of presence, it was a physical thing.\n\n\u201cThank you, Liam,\u201d Jake said, his voice thick with an emotion he made no attempt to hide. \u201cNot just for this. For\u2026 all of it.\u201d Liam\u2019s smile softened. He took a half-step closer, his gaze dropping to Jake\u2019s lips for a fraction of a second before meeting his eyes again. The question was there, clear and hopeful. Jake closed the remaining distance between them and gently, with a reverence born of long-suppressed hope, he pressed his lips to Liam\u2019s. It was not a kiss of frantic passion or desperate need. It was a kiss of recognition, of arrival. It was soft and sure and tasted of sawdust, sunshine, and the undeniable truth of a thing that was built to last. It was, in every sense of the word, a homecoming."

Their foreheads came to rest against each other, and they stayed there for a long moment, breathing in the same small pocket of air that smelled of sawdust, sweat, and the sharp, green scent of the bruised lawn. Jake kept his eyes closed, mapping this new reality by its immediate sensations: the faint, pleasant rasp of Liam\u2019s stubble against his skin, the solid warmth of the hands that had come up to gently cup his face, the quiet, steady beat of another heart that he could feel as a faint vibration through their point of contact. The silence in his own head was so complete, so absolute, that the gentle sounds of the garden\u2014the rustle of a leaf in the breeze, the chirp of a sparrow settling for the night\u2014seemed amplified, each one a perfect, distinct note in a world that had suddenly come into focus.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d Liam murmured, his voice a low, warm rumble that vibrated through Jake\u2019s bones. \u201cThat was worth waiting for.\u201d He pulled back just enough to look at Jake, his brown eyes clear and serious, though the corners were crinkled with a smile. There was no awkwardness, no uncertainty. In his gaze was the same calm, matter-of-fact certainty with which he had diagnosed a case of black spot or chosen a piece of timber. He saw a thing that was true, and he acknowledged it. Then, his gaze shifted past Jake, towards their handiwork. \u201cShall we?\u201d he asked, his thumb stroking Jake\u2019s cheekbone once before he let his hands drop. \u201cGive it a test drive.\u201d\n\nThey walked the few steps to the bench, their movements synchronised, and sat. The oak was solid and warm from the last of the day\u2019s sun, the angle of the back and the height of the seat exactly as Liam had sketched on the back of the seed packet. It was perfect. It felt, as Jake had hoped, like it had grown there, a natural outgrowth of the garden itself. He rested his hands on the smooth, planed wood of the armrests, the grain a silken map beneath his fingertips. He could feel the life force of the garden around him, the slow, contented respiration of the David Austin roses, the steady ambition of the silver birch reaching for the darkening sky. He could feel the warmth of Liam sitting beside him, a presence as solid and reassuring as the bench beneath them. The Force flowed around and through it all, not as a turbulent river of premonitions and warnings, but as a calm, clear tide, gentle and predictable. The universe had not ended. It had simply, finally, settled.\n\nIn the profound quiet of his own mind, Jake took stock. The hum had been his companion for so long, a constant background static, that its absence was a physical sensation. It was like living next to a great waterfall your whole life and then, one day, the water stops. The resulting silence was not an emptiness but a presence in itself, a vast, clear space that had opened up within him. The anxiety that had lived in the hum, the perpetual low-grade fear of being found, of the past catching up to him, had vanished with it. He felt grounded, anchored to this specific patch of earth in a way he had never felt, even in the deepest meditative trances in the Jedi Temple. The Temple had been about connecting to the infinite, dissolving the self into the cosmic whole. This was the opposite. This was about being wholly, completely, and peacefully *present* in one finite, perfect place, next to one specific, irreplaceable person.\n\n\u201cNeeds a good coat of tung oil,\u201d Liam said, breaking the comfortable silence. He ran his hand along the back of the bench, his touch both proprietary and appreciative. \u201cTwo or three coats, at least. To bring out the colour and protect it from the rain. We should do it next weekend, before it gets a proper soaking.\u201d He used the word \u2018we\u2019 so naturally it made Jake\u2019s heart give a small, happy jolt. The project was over, but the partnership was not. It was simply moving on to its next phase: maintenance. A life together, Jake realised, was not a single, grand act of construction, but a thousand small, ongoing acts of care.\n\nLater, they stood in Jake\u2019s kitchen, a space that was rapidly becoming *their* kitchen. The easy, unrehearsed rhythm they had found while clearing away dinner plates had returned, only now it was imbued with a new, unspoken intimacy. Jake was washing salad leaves at the sink while Liam, having scrubbed his hands and arms clean, was competently chopping onions on the worn pine table. There was no need for conversation. The shared, domestic quiet was a language in itself. For Jake, who had eaten alone for more years than he could count, the simple act of preparing a meal with someone else felt revolutionary. The fortress of his solitude had not been breached; he had simply walked out and left the gate open, and he had no intention of ever closing it again.\n\n\u201cYou seem different,\u201d Liam said, the rhythmic chop of his knife pausing. He was looking at Jake, his head tilted slightly, his gaze perceptive as ever. \u201cNot just now. All afternoon. Lighter.\u201d Jake turned from the sink, water dripping from his hands. He dried them slowly on a tea towel, considering how to answer. He couldn't talk about the hum, the lifelong psychic noise that had just been silenced. But he could speak the truth of its effect. \u201cI feel,\u201d he said, the words feeling new and strange on his tongue, \u201cquiet. For the first time in a very long time. I think I\u2019d forgotten what it felt like.\u201d The admission was a profound act of trust, a peeling back of another layer of his carefully constructed defences. He was sharing not a curated piece of his history, but the raw data of his immediate, internal experience.\n\nLiam held his gaze for a long moment, his expression softening with that deep, intuitive empathy that Jake was coming to cherish more than any Jedi mind-reading. He didn\u2019t press for an explanation. He didn\u2019t need the schematics to understand the architecture of the feeling. He simply put down his knife, wiped his hands, and crossed the small space between them. He placed a hand on Jake\u2019s arm, a familiar, grounding gesture that had come to mean *I am here. You are safe*. \u201cGood,\u201d he said, his voice low and full of a feeling that went far beyond simple agreement. \u201cYou deserve some quiet, Jake.\u201d The simple, heartfelt validation was more healing than any Jedi meditation, a balm applied directly to a wound Jake hadn't even known was still bleeding.\n\nThat night, they took two mugs of Earl Grey out to the garden and sat on the bench again. A sliver of moon hung in the star-dusted sky. For decades, Jake had looked up at those same stars and felt the vast, cold loneliness of the galaxy, the phantom limb of a life he had been forced to amputate. He had seen them as escape routes, hiding places, and, most of all, as a constant, glittering reminder of all he had lost. But tonight, sitting beside Liam, the warmth of their shoulders touching, the scent of damp earth and night-stock filling the air, the stars seemed different. They were no longer a map of his exile, but just a beautiful, distant pattern of light. His universe had finally found its true centre. It wasn\u2019t in the heart of a Republic or in the balance of the Force. It was here, in a quiet garden in Surrey, on a bench made of English oak, beside a man who understood the importance of a solid foundation."

The morning light, filtered through the fine-boned leaves of the silver birch, was still the same pale, watery green, but the silence it illuminated was entirely new. It was a silence that had weight and texture, a velvet quiet that had displaced the hum he had carried in his skull for as long as he could remember. For a confused, blissful moment, he thought he was dreaming. Then he felt the slow, steady rise and fall of the body next to him, the simple, solid warmth of another human being sharing his bed. Liam was asleep, his face relaxed and open in a way Jake had never seen it, his brown hair a tousled mess against the white pillowcase. Jake lay perfectly still, not wanting to disturb the moment. He could feel the thrum of life in the room, not through the Force, but through his own five senses: the scent of Liam\u2019s skin, the soft sound of his breathing, the comforting, undeniable reality of his presence. It was better than any meditation. It was an anchor.\n\nDownstairs, the kitchen felt like a different room. It was no longer Jake\u2019s solitary command centre, but a shared space. Liam, his movements still slow with sleep, went straight to the cupboard for the mugs as if he had been doing so every morning for years. Jake filled the kettle, the familiar ritual now a duet instead of a solo. They moved around each other with an easy, unpracticed grace, a silent understanding passing between them in the spaces where their arms brushed or their eyes met. Liam made the tea while Jake sliced a lemon for his own, the small division of labour feeling as significant as any formal treaty. There was no need to discuss what had happened, no need for awkward morning-after conversation. The change was simply there, a settled fact, as solid and real as the worn pine of the table where they sat.\n\n\u201cThe roses have another flush coming,\u201d Liam said, his voice a pleasant, gravelly rasp in the morning quiet. He cradled his mug in both hands, gazing out at the garden. \u201cThe yellow ones. They look happier now they\u2019ve got a bit of room to breathe.\u201d He wasn't reporting on a job; he was sharing an observation with a fellow custodian. The garden, Jake realised, was no longer his secret, Force-tended sanctuary, looked after by a paid professional. It had become their shared territory, a joint enterprise. \u201cWe should think about planting some hellebores for the winter. They\u2019ll give you a bit of colour when everything else has died back.\u201d\n\nThe casual, forward-looking \u2018we\u2019 landed in Jake\u2019s heart with a gentle, satisfying weight. The future was no longer a vague, shapeless thing to be endured, but something to be planned, planted, and looked forward to. It was a future that included winter colour and the man sitting across from him. He felt a smile spread across his face, a slow, genuine expression of contentment so profound it almost felt foreign. \u201cI\u2019d like that,\u201d he said, and the simple words were a vow. He reached across the table, his fingers finding Liam\u2019s, lacing through them. Liam\u2019s hand was warm and strong, his grip firm and reassuring. They sat like that for a long time, in the quiet green light, drinking their tea, their hands entwined on the table between them, a silent, perfect testament to the new shape of their world.\n\nThe days that followed settled into a rhythm that was both novel and deeply natural. Liam\u2019s work van still rumbled up the drive on Tuesdays, but he no longer left when the light began to fade. Often he would stay for dinner, and then for the night, his presence in the house becoming a simple, accepted fact. His toothbrush appeared in a holder next to Jake\u2019s. A thick, well-worn jumper of his was left draped over the armchair in the living room, a quiet, woollen flag of occupation. Jake, who had spent decades cultivating a life of stark, monastic self-sufficiency, found an unexpected joy in these small erosions of his solitude. The house felt more alive, the silence no longer a sterile absence of sound but a comfortable quiet, rich with the potential of conversation. He was learning the difference between being alone and being lonely, a distinction his Jedi training had never made clear.\n\nHis relationship with the Force was changing, too. Without the constant, anxious hum to filter and interpret, his senses felt both broader and more finely attuned. He began to notice things he had previously overlooked. He could feel the slow, patient joy of the oak bench as it settled onto its stone foundation, its long life as a tree transitioning into a new, stationary existence. He could sense the intricate, hidden life of the soil, the tireless work of worms and mycelial networks creating the rich dark earth that Liam so revered. But the most significant change was in how he used his power. It was no longer a tool for defence or deception, but an instrument of quiet, domestic affection. One evening, as they were cooking together, Liam was searching for the salt, patting his pockets and scanning the counters with a frown. Jake, without breaking his rhythm of stirring a sauce, simply focused for a second. The salt cellar, left on a high shelf, wobbled and then floated gently down, landing with a soft click on the counter right beside Liam\u2019s hand. Liam didn\u2019t even flinch. \u201cOh, there it is,\u201d he said, picking it up and sprinkling it into the pot. \u201cThanks.\u201d He said it with the same casual gratitude he might have shown if Jake had simply passed it to him. The moment was so mundane, so utterly normal, that Jake almost laughed out loud. The Force, the great, mysterious power that bound the galaxy together, had been seamlessly integrated into their life as a handy kitchen shortcut. The old masters would have been horrified. Jake had never felt more at peace."

                                        "text": "The seasons began to turn, the fierce, preternatural green of Jake\u2019s super-charged summer lawn softening into a more contemplative gold. The partnership in the garden had become the central rhythm of their life. On Tuesdays, Jake would now be waiting for Liam at the shed, armed with his own pair of secateurs\u2014a newer, sharper pair that Liam had bought for him\u2014and a genuine, if still developing, understanding of what needed to be done. He learned the satisfying art of dead-heading, the Zen-like focus required to thin out a sprawling climber, and the patient, hopeful work of planting bulbs that would lie dormant for months before announcing the arrival of a spring they would see together. Liam taught him not just the techniques, but the philosophy. \u201cYou\u2019re not imposing your will on it,\u201d he explained one afternoon, guiding Jake\u2019s hand to show him the precise point at which to prune a rambling rose. \u201cYou\u2019re listening to what it wants to do, and just\u2026 helping it get there with less fuss.\u201d Jake, a man who had spent a lifetime trying to impose the will of a failing Republic on a stubborn galaxy, felt the simple wisdom of this in his bones. It was the same principle Liam had applied to him, he realised. He hadn't tried to change or fix him; he had simply listened to what Jake\u2019s lonely, fractured life was trying to become, and helped it get there.\n\nTheir quiet understanding of Jake\u2019s \u2018knack\u2019, as Liam had taken to calling it, deepened into a form of silent collaboration. They never spoke of it directly, but it became a tool in their shared toolbox, as practical and unassuming as a trowel. When they decided to move a large, half-rotten sleeper that had been sinking into the lawn for years, Liam assessed the weight and angles, planning a complex manoeuvre with levers and rollers. Jake simply stood at one end. \u201cRight, on three,\u201d Liam grunted, bracing himself. On three, Jake took the strain, but he also reached out with the Force, persuading the sleeper that it was light as balsa wood. Liam lifted his end with a grunt of prepared effort, his eyes widening in comical surprise as the heavy, waterlogged beam came up with ridiculous ease. He shot Jake a look over the top of it\u2014a look that was a complex, untranslatable mixture of exasperation, amusement, and profound affection. \u201cShow off,\u201d he muttered, and Jake\u2019s answering laugh was free and unburdened. The use of his power was no longer a guilty secret or a source of fear; it was a private joke, a shared conspiracy, a trick they played together on the unyielding laws of physics.\n\nOne Saturday, they drove into the village for supplies. The trip was mundane\u2014bread from the baker, a newspaper, a bag of compost from the hardware store\u2014but for Jake, it was a momentous expedition. For years, his interactions with the world beyond his garden fence had been brief, transactional, and shrouded in the low-level perception filter he used to remain unnoticed. To walk down the high street on a bright, busy morning next to Liam felt like a debut. He found himself instinctively shrinking, pulling into his old habits of invisibility, until Liam, seemingly sensing his unease, casually reached over and took his hand. The contact was warm, solid, and utterly public. A woman walking her dog smiled at them. The man in the bakery greeted Liam by name and nodded pleasantly at Jake. Nobody stared. No alarms went off. The world did not stop turning. In the simple, grounding clasp of Liam\u2019s hand, Jake felt his old fears dissolving. He was not a fugitive hiding in plain sight. He was just a man, holding his partner\u2019s hand, on his way to buy compost. The sheer, breathtaking normality of it was the most powerful magic he had ever witnessed.\n\nLater that afternoon, sitting on their bench while the new hellebore plants settled into their freshly dug holes, Liam fell quiet. He was watching a family playing at the far end of the public park that bordered their garden, their laughter carrying on the breeze. It was the kind of idyllic, ordinary scene that Jake had always viewed from a distance, as if looking at life in another dimension. \u201cYou ever think about it?\u201d Liam asked, his voice thoughtful. \u201cKids?\u201d The question was so unexpected, so far beyond the realm of anything Jake had ever allowed himself to consider, that he was momentarily stunned into silence. A child. A family. These were concepts from a life he had never lived, a future he had never been entitled to. The Jedi Code was explicit: they were guardians, not parents; their legacy was the Order, not a bloodline. \u201cThe way I was raised,\u201d Jake said, picking his words carefully, translating the sterile doctrine of the Temple into something human and relatable, \u201cit wasn\u2019t\u2026 encouraged. Personal attachments were seen as a distraction from a greater purpose. The idea of a family of my own was never part of the plan.\u201d\n\nHe looked at Liam, expecting to see the subject dropped, but Liam was looking at him with a deep, searching tenderness. \u201cPlans change,\u201d he said softly. \u201cAnd whoever made that plan sounds like they were scared of something.\u201d He paused, turning to face Jake more fully on the bench. \u201cIt\u2019s not a distraction, is it? Loving someone. Building a life. It\u2019s the whole point.\u201d He gestured to the garden, to the house, to the space between them. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a distraction from my work. This *is* the work. It\u2019s the most important work I\u2019ll ever do.\u201d He reached out and took Jake\u2019s hand, his thumb tracing the lines on his palm. \u201cI don\u2019t know what your greater purpose was, Jake. But if it made you hide yourself away from all this for so long, it doesn\u2019t sound like it was all that great to me.\u201d Liam\u2019s simple, earthy logic cut through decades of ingrained dogma with the clean precision of one of his own chisels. The Jedi had feared attachment because it led to jealousy and fear of loss. But Liam wasn\u2019t afraid. He saw love not as a vulnerability, but as the ultimate purpose, the foundation upon which everything else was built.\n\nThat evening, a comfortable quiet settled over the house as they prepared dinner. The conversation from the bench hung in the air, not as a point of tension, but as a newly opened door. As Jake was drying the dishes Liam had washed, Liam spoke from the living room, his voice casual. \u201cMy lease is up in February,\u201d he said. Jake paused, a half-dried plate in his hands. He could feel Liam\u2019s intention, not through the Force, but through the simple, clear connection that now existed between them. It wasn't a question or a demand. It was a statement of fact, laid gently between them for Jake to pick up. \u201cThe landlord\u2019s planning on selling. I\u2019ll need to find a new place.\u201d Jake turned, leaning against the counter, and looked through the doorway at Liam, who was standing by the bookshelf, feigning an interest in a thick history of medieval guilds. The silence stretched, filled with unspoken possibilities.\n\n\u201cThe spare room is full of junk,\u201d Jake said, his voice quiet but clear in the still house. \u201cIt would take a while to clear it out. And the wardrobe only has one rail.\u201d He watched as Liam\u2019s shoulders, which had been tense, relaxed. A slow smile spread across Liam\u2019s face as he turned away from the bookshelf to face him. \u201cI\u2019m good at clearing out junk,\u201d Liam said, his eyes sparkling. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t have that many clothes.\u201d The future, which had once been an abstract concept Jake had tried to avoid, was now being discussed in terms of wardrobe space and clearing out a spare room. It was practical. It was tangible. It was real. Jake felt a wave of profound, unconditional love for this man, this gardener who had looked at the overgrown, neglected wilderness of his life and had seen not a lost cause, but a place with good bones, a place that just needed a little help to find the sun."

                                        "text": "The process of clearing out Liam\u2019s flat was less a move and more an excavation. The small, rented space, which Jake had never seen before, was exactly as he had imagined: functional, tidy, and profoundly temporary. It was a place a man kept his things, not where he lived his life. The furniture was sparse and anonymous, the walls were bare, and the air held a faint, lingering scent of the Indian takeaways he had favoured before Jake\u2019s pasta and curries had entered the picture. There was no clutter, only a collection of neatly stacked boxes, a testament to a life kept perpetually ready to move on. Jake felt a pang of recognition. He, too, had once lived this way, his few possessions always ready for a quick departure, his presence in any location deliberately shallow, leaving no mark. Looking at Liam\u2019s spartan flat, he felt a profound gratitude that they had found each other, two men who had learned, in their own very different ways, how to finally stay put.\n\nLiam\u2019s history was packed into a handful of cardboard boxes. There were his clothes, practical and unadorned. There were the essentials of a simple kitchen. But then there were the boxes that held the man himself. One, heavier than all the others, was filled with his grandfather\u2019s old gardening books, their spines cracked and their pages soft with use, filled with handwritten notes in a spidery, fading script. Another held a carefully wrapped collection of photographs: a smiling, stubborn-looking old man who had to be the grandfather, a younger, unsmiling man who was likely Liam\u2019s father, and a few faded pictures of a woman with Liam\u2019s kind eyes. He handled these boxes with a gentle reverence that was touching to witness. As Jake reached to lift the heavy box of books, he subtly wrapped it in the Force, not to lift it for him, but to cradle it, to ensure its precious, paper-and-ink contents wouldn\u2019t shift or tear. It was an invisible act of care, a secret promise to protect the history that was now being entrusted to him.\n\nThe most significant task, however, lay back at their own house, in the spare room upstairs. It was a room Jake had used as a repository for the last, stubborn remnants of his past, the few physical artifacts he hadn\u2019t had the heart or the ruthlessness to destroy. The door had remained closed for years. Now, with Liam at his side, he opened it. The room was filled with a few sealed storage crates. Liam, ever practical, simply rolled up his sleeves. \u201cRight,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s see what we\u2019re dealing with.\u201d He made to lift the lid of the largest crate, but Jake placed a hand on his arm, stopping him. \u201cWait,\u201d Jake said, his voice quiet. He didn\u2019t know how to explain that the contents were not just junk, but relics of a dead galaxy, objects that could be dangerous in their implications if not in their function.\n\nHe opened the crate himself. Inside, nestled in protective foam, were a few objects that looked both ancient and advanced. There was a handheld data-slate, its screen dark and lifeless. There was a palm-sized metallic sphere that, if activated, would project a star-chart of a system that no longer existed. And at the bottom, wrapped in a piece of oilcloth, was a single, scorched glove from his old Master\u2019s robes, retrieved from a funeral pyre whose smoke he could still smell if he let himself. He stared at the objects, the weight of their history threatening to pull him back into the cold, empty space he had fought so hard to escape. Liam didn\u2019t ask what they were. He didn\u2019t pry or press. He simply looked from the strange, silent objects to Jake\u2019s face, and he understood. He saw not alien technology, but the unbearable weight of grief. \u201cSome things are heavy,\u201d he said softly, his voice full of a simple, profound empathy. \u201cDo you want to keep them, or is it time for them to be at peace?\u201d\n\nThe question was a key, unlocking something in Jake\u2019s heart. He had been a guardian of these relics, a keeper of a dead flame. But Liam was right. They were not just heavy; they were an anchor, holding him to a past that was gone. He was no longer a guardian. He was a gardener. A partner. A man building a life, not curating a museum of sorrow. He reached into the crate and his fingers closed around the small, metallic sphere. It was cool and smooth, a perfect, self-contained memory. He slipped it into his pocket. Then he looked at Liam and took a deep, steadying breath. \u201cIt\u2019s time for them to be at peace,\u201d he said. Later that day, they drove to the municipal recycling centre. Jake, feeling both a profound sadness and an exhilarating sense of freedom, dropped the data-slate and the scorched glove into a large bin marked \u2018Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment\u2019. A mundane, terrestrial end for the last remnants of the Jedi Order. As he turned away, Liam was there, and he took Jake\u2019s hand, his grip solid and unwavering. No words were needed. The past had been laid to rest, respectfully and without fanfare, in a recycling skip in Surrey.\n\nBy evening, the house was in a state of happy, organised chaos. Boxes were stacked in the hallway and the living room, some open, some still sealed. Liam\u2019s life was slowly, surely, merging with Jake\u2019s. His practical, mud-stained boots now stood permanently by the back door next to Jake\u2019s tidier walking shoes. His grandfather\u2019s gardening books had been given pride of place on a shelf in the living room, their worn spines nestled comfortably between Jake\u2019s volumes on planetary history and military strategy. The two collections looked incongruous, and yet, somehow, perfectly right together. The house was no longer just Jake\u2019s quiet, sterile sanctuary. It was becoming a home, layered with the stories and possessions of two lives, a place filled with the comfortable, untidy clutter of a shared existence.\n\nExhausted, filthy, and profoundly content, they gave up on the idea of cooking. Liam, with a triumphant grin, called and ordered a pizza, the one he used to eat alone out of a box. When it arrived, they didn\u2019t bother with plates. They sat on the floor of the living room, leaning against the sofa, surrounded by the cardboard architecture of their new life. They ate straight from the box, their legs stretched out, their shoulders companionably pressed together. The room smelled of cheese, tomato, and cardboard. Looking at Liam, his face illuminated by the soft light of a single lamp, a smear of pizza sauce on his chin, Jake felt a wave of love so powerful it was a physical force, a warmth that spread from his chest to the tips of his fingers. This was it. The grand, cosmic purpose he had once served had crumbled to dust, but here, in the rubble, he had built something small, and strong, and true. He was no longer the last Jedi, a man running from ghosts. He was Jake, a man who shared a pizza on the floor with the person he loved. He was, finally and completely, home."

The cardboard boxes, at first a chaotic mountain range in the living room, were gradually eroded, their contents spilling out and finding new homes on shelves, in cupboards, and on windowsills. Jake discovered that living with someone was a constant, quiet negotiation. It was the debate over which of their two colanders to keep (they kept Liam\u2019s, which was larger and more robust), the discovery that Liam hummed tunelessly when he was concentrating on a task, and the simple, profound comfort of waking in the night and reaching out to find another person there, solid and real in the darkness. The house, once a silent vessel for one man\u2019s solitude, began to accumulate the gentle, layered history of two. Jake found a fossil, a perfect ammonite Liam had found as a child, resting on his desk next to the small, metallic sphere he had saved from the purge. The two objects, one from a forgotten age of Earth and the other from a fallen galactic civilisation, seemed to hold a silent conversation, two survivors of time and catastrophe resting together in the quiet of a Surrey study.\n\nThe final box to be unpacked was the one containing Liam\u2019s photographs. They sat on the floor one rainy Sunday afternoon, the new bench outside glistening with water, and sorted through the glossy prints and dog-eared albums. Liam was a quiet, affectionate guide through his own history. He pointed out his grandfather, a man with a weathered face and a twinkle in his eye, standing proudly beside a prize-winning marrow. He showed Jake a photo of his mother, a gentle-faced woman with a mischievous smile, her arm around a young, gap-toothed Liam. Her absence was a soft, unspoken sadness in the collection. And then there were the photos of his father. A handsome man in his youth, his smile slightly forced, standing in front of a half-finished building, a set of architectural plans clutched in his hand. In every picture, he seemed to be looking just past the camera, his gaze fixed on some distant, unseen horizon.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not a bad man,\u201d Liam said, his voice neutral as he stared at a photo of his father awkwardly trying to help a teenage Liam assemble a shed. \u201cHe\u2019s just\u2026 loud. Everything about him is loud. His voice, his opinions, the way he thinks the world should work. He thinks in straight lines and right angles. Concrete and steel. He can\u2019t understand why anyone would choose a life of curves and circles. Soil and seasons.\u201d Liam traced the outline of his father\u2019s face with his finger. \u201cHe thinks what I do is a hobby. He\u2019s proud of me, in his own way, I think. But he doesn\u2019t respect it. Not really.\u201d The admission was made without bitterness, a simple statement of a long-accepted fact.\n\nJust as he said it, as if summoned by the conversation, Liam\u2019s phone, lying on the rug between them, began to buzz. The screen lit up with the name \u2018Dad\u2019. Liam sighed, a long, weary sound, and shot Jake an apologetic, almost comical look of resignation. He answered, his voice instantly taking on a slightly more formal, more guarded tone. \u201cHi Dad. Yeah, I\u2019m good. How are you?\u201d Jake sat quietly, pretending to be absorbed in an album, but he listened to the one-sided conversation, the Force giving him an unwelcome but vivid impression of the man on the other end of the line: a booming, impatient energy, a mind that moved too quickly and listened too little, a constant, restless dissatisfaction. Liam\u2019s responses were brief and non-committal, a series of deflections and placations. \u201cYeah, the move went fine\u2026 No, it\u2019s not too small\u2026 It\u2019s nice, it\u2019s got a great garden\u2026 Yes, I\u2019m still just doing the gardening\u2026\u201d The conversation ended a few minutes later, leaving a palpable tension in the quiet room. Liam tossed the phone onto a cushion and ran a hand through his hair. \u201cHe wants to \u2018come and inspect the new place\u2019,\u201d he said, his imitation of his father\u2019s booming voice a perfect, loving mockery. \u201cMake sure I\u2019m not living in a hovel. He also has a lead on a big landscaping contract for a new office park. Thinks I should get a proper crew together, start a limited company. He doesn\u2019t hear a word I say.\u201d\n\nJake watched him, his heart aching with a fierce, protective love. He knew what it was like to be misunderstood by a father figure, to have your life\u2019s path measured against a set of expectations you could never meet. His own masters had wanted him to be a perfect, detached instrument of the Force, a selfless guardian of an ideal. They had never understood the messy, human heart that beat beneath his robes. \u201cWhen I was younger,\u201d Jake said, his voice drawing Liam\u2019s gaze, \u201cthe people who trained me had a very specific vision for my life. A very grand one. It was all about legacy, about upholding a tradition that was thousands of years old. Every choice was weighed against that purpose.\u201d He paused, choosing his words with care, stripping them of their alien context. \u201cI spent a long time trying to be the person they wanted me to be. I believed in the purpose, but I always felt like I was wearing clothes that didn't fit. When it all fell apart, the hardest thing wasn't losing the purpose. It was admitting to myself that I was relieved.\u201d\n\nLiam stared at him, his own troubles momentarily forgotten, his full attention captured. \u201cRelieved?\u201d Jake nodded. \u201cIt was a beautiful, important structure, and I mourned its collapse. But it was also a cage. A gilded one, but a cage nonetheless. Being free of it\u2026 it was terrifying. But it was also the first time I got to choose what my own life was for.\u201d He reached out and placed his hand over Liam\u2019s, which was resting on the open photo album. \u201cYour father sees the world in terms of structures, of things being built bigger and higher. You see it in terms of things growing stronger and deeper. It\u2019s not a hobby, Liam. It\u2019s a different kind of architecture. One that\u2019s much harder to master. And one, I think, that\u2019s built to last.\u201d The words settled in the space between them, a quiet, solid truth. Liam\u2019s hand turned under Jake\u2019s, his fingers lacing through his. A slow, grateful smile spread across his face, chasing away the lingering tension from his father\u2019s phone call. \u201cA different kind of architecture,\u201d he repeated softly, as if trying on the phrase. He looked from Jake\u2019s face to their intertwined hands, then around the room at the comfortable, half-unpacked chaos of their life. \u201cYeah,\u201d he said, his voice full of a renewed, quiet confidence. \u201cI like that. Let\u2019s show him our architecture.\u201d"

There was no frantic tidying or polishing. Instead, they spent their time in the garden, a shared act of devotion to the \u2018architecture\u2019 they had resolved to present. Together, they planted the hellebores, their hands moving in the cool, damp earth, placing the roots of the \u2018Christmas roses\u2019 in the soil as a quiet promise of life in the darkest part of the year. They gave the bench its first coat of tung oil, the rich, nutty scent filling the air as they worked in companionable silence, the wood\u2019s grain deepening to a lustrous, golden brown under their careful hands. They were not trying to create an impression of perfection for an audience; they were simply tending to their life, making it more fully and truly itself. Every shared task was a quiet reinforcement of their unity, a strengthening of the foundations Alan was coming to inspect.\n\n\u201cThe important thing is not to be defensive,\u201d Liam said one evening, as they sat on the bench, watching the last of the light fade from the sky. \u201cHe\u2019s not coming here to attack us, not really. He\u2019s coming to try and rescue me. In his mind, he\u2019s the hero, trying to save his son from a life of obscurity and poverty.\u201d He laughed, a short, humourless sound. \u201cThe best thing we can do is just look happy. Look like we don\u2019t need rescuing.\u201d Jake looked at him, at the quiet resolve in his profile, and felt a swell of pride. This was not the man who had mumbled refusals and looked at the ground. This was a man standing on his own firm foundation, ready to calmly state its worth. Jake\u2019s role in the coming encounter, he knew, was not to be a defender, but simply to be a visible part of that foundation. His presence, his happiness, his quiet contentment in this life with Liam, would be his only argument, and the most powerful one he could make.\n\nAlan\u2019s arrival on Saturday was not a gentle convergence; it was a percussive event. A large, gleaming black saloon, entirely out of place on the quiet suburban street, crunched onto the gravel drive with an air of proprietary importance. The man who emerged was as imposing as his vehicle. Alan was tall and broad, dressed in expensive, sharp-angled casual clothes that looked uncomfortable in the soft, autumnal setting of the garden. He moved with a restless, forward-driving energy that seemed to consume the oxygen around him, and his voice, when he greeted his son with a booming \u201cThere he is!\u201d, filled the quiet space of the garden completely. Jake felt the psychic shock of it, a sudden, intrusive noise after weeks of profound quiet. It was the energy of the Coruscant cityscape, of ambition and commerce and ceaseless, demanding motion, concentrated into one man. He felt his old instincts flicker, the urge to shield, to retreat into invisibility, but then he felt Liam\u2019s hand find his, a quick, reassuring squeeze before he stepped forward to greet his father.\n\nThe \u2018inspection\u2019 was a swift, dismissive tour. Alan strode through the small, comfortable rooms, his large frame making them feel smaller, his eyes scanning everything with a builder\u2019s appraising, and ultimately disappointed, gaze. \u201cCosy,\u201d he pronounced, the word landing with the faint damnation of a surveyor finding subsidence. He nodded at the shelves of books, at the comfortable, worn furniture, at the general lack of chrome and glass and newness. In the garden, he was even more direct. He admired the neatness of the lawn, the health of the roses, with the air of a man appreciating a well-maintained hobby. He ran a hand over the new bench. \u201cGood work, this,\u201d he conceded, his professional eye approving of the tight joints and solid construction. \u201cYou could knock these out all day long. Set up a proper workshop, get a couple of lads in. There\u2019s a market for this high-end garden stuff.\u201d He saw a product, a production line, a business model. He did not see a love letter written in oak.\n\nThey sat down for lunch at the kitchen table, the same worn pine that had witnessed every stage of Jake and Liam\u2019s relationship. Alan, however, seemed to dominate it, his presence and his booming voice shrinking the comfortable space into a tense arena. He had brought blueprints with him. He unrolled them on the table with a flourish, the crisp paper covering the space where Jake and Liam\u2019s hands had so often met. It was the office park. A vast, sprawling complex of glass and steel, surrounded by geometrically perfect lawns and ruler-straight lines of imported trees. \u201cThis is it, son,\u201d Alan said, his voice resonating with genuine passion. \u201cThis is a proper job. We\u2019re talking five years of contracts, just to start. You\u2019d be head of landscaping. Not just planting a few shrubs, but proper civil engineering. Drainage, irrigation, earth-moving. You\u2019d have a team of twenty. It\u2019s a real career, Liam. A chance to build something that\u2019ll be here in a hundred years.\u201d He looked from the plans to his son, his face alight with the fervent belief that he was offering the keys to the kingdom.\n\nLiam listened patiently, his hands resting calmly in his lap. The Liam of a year ago would have been staring at the table, overwhelmed. This Liam met his father\u2019s intense gaze without flinching. When Alan finally finished, a hopeful, expectant silence fell. Liam took a slow breath. \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing project, Dad. It really is. And I know you\u2019ll do a brilliant job with it.\u201d Alan\u2019s face beamed. \u201cBut it\u2019s your project,\u201d Liam continued, his voice quiet but unshakably firm. \u201cIt\u2019s your architecture. It\u2019s not mine.\u201d Alan\u2019s smile faltered, a flicker of confusion and impatience crossing his features. \u201cArchitecture? What are you talking about? It\u2019s a job, a brilliant opportunity!\u201d Liam glanced at Jake, a quick, almost imperceptible look that was filled with a universe of shared understanding. Jake gave a tiny, slow nod, his own calm a silent, invisible buttress supporting Liam\u2019s resolve. \u201cJake and I,\u201d Liam said, turning his full attention back to his father, \u201cwe\u2019re building something here. It\u2019s just a different kind of architecture. It\u2019s not made of steel and glass. It doesn\u2019t scrape the sky.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor god\u2019s sake, Liam, it\u2019s a semi-detached house and a vegetable patch!\u201d Alan boomed, his frustration finally boiling over. \u201cDon\u2019t get romantic. I\u2019m talking about your future!\u201d It was at this moment that Jake spoke, his voice so quiet after Alan\u2019s that it commanded immediate attention. \u201cThe foundations are good,\u201d he said simply. He was looking at Liam, not Alan, but the words were directed at the older man. \u201cThe foundations here are very good. They\u2019re built on solid ground.\u201d Alan stared at him, for the first time truly seeing him not just as his son\u2019s quiet housemate, but as a part of this inexplicable resistance. He saw the absolute certainty in Jake\u2019s eyes, the deep, unshakable calm, and for a moment, his own restless energy seemed to falter in the face of it. He looked from Jake\u2019s serene face to his son\u2019s determined one, and saw not a phase or a hobby, but a partnership, a unified, unbreachable wall of quiet conviction. He didn\u2019t understand it. He couldn\u2019t see the value in it. But for the first time, he seemed to recognise its strength. He slowly, defeatedly, began to roll up his blueprints."

The crunch of gravel was sharp and final, the engine roared to life with an impatient bark, and then the sound faded down the street, leaving behind a silence that felt vast and profoundly peaceful. For a long moment, neither Jake nor Liam moved. They remained at the kitchen table, the space where the blueprints had been now empty, a blank canvas. Then, Liam let out a breath he seemed to have been holding all afternoon, a long, slow exhalation that was equal parts relief and exhaustion. He slumped back in his chair and scrubbed a hand over his face. Jake reached across the table, his hand covering Liam\u2019s. The contact was an affirmation, a quiet declaration of victory. Liam\u2019s fingers, which had been clenched into a fist, slowly uncurled, and he laced them through Jake\u2019s. He looked up, and a slow, tired, but triumphant smile spread across his face.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d Liam said, his voice returning to its normal, gentle cadence. \u201cThat\u2019s that, then.\u201d They didn\u2019t need to say anything more. The encounter had been a test, a stress-test of the structure they had built together, and it had held. The foundations were good. They had stood their ground not with anger or argument, but with the quiet, unassailable fact of their shared happiness. They spent the rest of the afternoon clearing away the remnants of the visit. Liam carefully washed and dried the plates, while Jake wiped down the table, erasing the faint indentations left by the blueprints. The actions were mundane, but they felt ceremonial, a reclaiming and reconsecration of their space. They were washing away the last traces of a loud, intrusive world and restoring their home to its natural state of quiet contentment. When they were done, the house felt lighter, the air cleaner. It was fully theirs again.\n\nLife settled into a new, deeper rhythm, a quiet cadence that matched the shortening days and the slow descent of autumn into winter. Their world shrank to the boundaries of their home and garden, not as a retreat from the world, but as a deliberate and joyful focus on what mattered. They insulated the shed, turning it into a snug, year-round workshop. They stacked firewood in a neat cord against the back wall of the house. They mulched the rose beds, tucking them in for their long sleep. These were not chores, but acts of shared domestic faith, a preparation for a future they implicitly knew they would spend together. The hellebores, as promised, began to push brave, pale flowers through the cold soil, small points of light in the gathering dark. Jake found that he no longer looked at the sky with a sense of loss or longing. He looked at the earth, at the small, tenacious proofs of life pushing through the dirt, and felt a profound sense of belonging. His universe was no longer a vast, empty expanse dotted with dead stars; it was a half-acre plot of Surrey soil, rich with life and promise.\n\nOne evening, with a cold rain whispering against the windowpanes and a fire crackling in the living room hearth, the time felt right. Liam was on the rug, patiently untangling a string of fairy lights he\u2019d bought for the silver birch, humming his tuneless hum of concentration. Jake sat in his armchair, a book open but unread in his lap. He had been carrying the small, metallic sphere in his pocket for days, its cool, smooth weight a constant reminder of the one story he had not yet fully shared. The final piece of his architecture. He took it out, its surface gleaming dully in the firelight. Liam glanced up from his tangle of wires, his curiosity piqued. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d he asked. \u201cThe one thing you kept.\u201d\n\nJake held it in his palm, the last relic of his old life. \u201cIt\u2019s a map,\u201d he said softly. \u201cA memory.\u201d He knew, with a certainty that had nothing to do with the Force, that this was the final act of trust. He focused, not with a surge of power, but with a gentle, willing intent, the way he now coaxed a seed to sprout. The sphere responded, a low, resonant note filling the air for a fraction of a second before it projected a soft, three-dimensional image into the space above his hand. It was not a grand, sprawling chart of the galaxy, but something far more intimate. A miniature, shimmering orrery of a solar system with two suns, a handful of rocky inner worlds, and one, a breathtaking swirl of blue and white, that glowed with a slightly brighter, more vibrant light. The tiny planets drifted in silent, perfect orbits, their movements as graceful and precise as a piece of music. It was impossibly beautiful, and it pulsed with a faint, heartbreaking echo of peace.\n\nLiam stared, utterly mesmerised. He put down the lights, his hands resting on his knees, his face bathed in the soft, blue-white glow of the projection. \u201cJake,\u201d he breathed. \u201cWhat is that?\u201d Jake\u2019s gaze was fixed on the glowing blue world. \u201cIt\u2019s my home,\u201d he said, his voice thick with an ancient grief. \u201cAlderaan. It was\u2026 a city built in the mountains. The air tasted like cold water.\u201d He was quoting himself from a conversation that felt like it had happened a lifetime ago. \u201cThis is a children\u2019s primer. A star-map. It shows you where you came from, so you never feel lost.\u201d He looked at Liam, his own eyes glistening in the firelight. \u201cThe map is all that\u2019s left. It leads to a place that isn\u2019t there anymore.\u201d The silence in the room was absolute, broken only by the crackle of the fire. Liam didn\u2019t ask how or why. He didn\u2019t need to. He saw the story not in the impossible technology floating in the air, but in the profound, bottomless sorrow in Jake\u2019s eyes. He saw the ultimate refugee, a man whose entire world, whose very point of origin, had been erased from the universe.\n\nSlowly, gently, Liam reached out, not to touch the projection, but to place his hand on Jake\u2019s knee. His touch was an anchor in a swirling sea of memory. \u201cThen we\u2019ll have to draw a new map,\u201d he said, his voice soft but unwavering. The shimmering planets of Alderaan continued their silent, ghostly dance between them. Liam looked from the projection to Jake\u2019s face, his expression one of infinite tenderness and fierce resolve. \u201cYou said the idea of a family was never part of your plan. And I said plans change.\u201d He took a breath, the quiet gravity of his words filling the room. \u201cMy grandad used to say the best thing you can plant is a tree you\u2019ll never get to sit under. It\u2019s about building something for a future you won\u2019t be a part of. Creating a legacy.\u201d He looked at the ghost-world hanging in the air. \u201cYour legacy was taken from you. All those people, all that history. Gone.\u201d He squeezed Jake\u2019s knee, his gaze intense and full of a love that was a tangible force in the room. \u201cSo let\u2019s start a new one. Right here. A new tree. A new history. A new family.\u201d It was not a question. It was a proposal, a blueprint for a future so radical and so beautiful it made Jake\u2019s heart ache. The projection of his lost home wavered, and with a soft sigh, Jake let his concentration go. The light winked out, plunging the room back into the simple, warm glow of the fire. He was left holding a cold, inert piece of metal, a dead memory. But his other hand was held firmly in Liam\u2019s, a warm, living promise of a future waiting to be built."

                                        "text": "Jake didn\u2019t speak for a long time. The fire crackled into the silence, a small, domestic sound set against the galactic scale of what had just been offered. He looked down at the inert sphere in his palm, a cold, dead weight that represented the end of a story. Then he looked at Liam\u2019s hand, so warm and solid, holding his own. It was the beginning of a story. The Jedi Order had taught him that a Jedi\u2019s legacy was the continuation of the Order itself, a faceless, selfless contribution to a river of tradition. They had taught that personal lineage was a vanity, a selfish diversion from a higher calling. But looking at Liam\u2019s earnest, loving face, illuminated by the firelight, Jake saw the lie in that teaching with a clarity that was like a physical blow. The Order was gone. The tradition was broken. The river had run dry. And what had its selflessness achieved? It had created an army of lonely, emotionally stunted guardians who were so afraid of personal loss that they failed to prevent a galactic one. Liam, who had never heard of the Force, understood a truth the Jedi Masters had forgotten: that the fiercest, most selfless love is born not from abstract ideals, but from the fierce, specific, and terrifying love for one\u2019s own. A family wasn\u2019t a distraction from a greater purpose; it was the crucible in which purpose was forged.\n\nFinally, he found his voice, a low murmur that was thick with unshed tears. \u201cYes,\u201d he said. The single word was an exhalation, a surrender, a vow. It was the most profound act of rebellion he had ever committed, a final, definitive rejection of the ghosts that had haunted him across the stars. He closed his fingers around the cold sphere one last time, then deliberately placed it on the mantelpiece, setting it down like a paperweight, an old curio whose power was now spent. Its story was over. He turned back to Liam, taking his hand with both of his own, holding on as if he were a drowning man who had just found land. \u201cYes,\u201d he said again, his voice stronger this time, filled with a conviction that was entirely new. \u201cLet\u2019s draw a new map.\u201d A new kind of hum began, almost imperceptibly, at the base of his skull. It was not the anxious thrum of trouble or the lonely signal of his exile. It was a deep, resonant, creative frequency, the feeling of a world being born.\n\nThe conversations that had once been about herbaceous borders and joinery techniques shifted focus. Their quiet evenings, once spent reading or working in the shed, were now dedicated to a different kind of planning. Liam would bring home stacks of pamphlets and printouts from the internet, spreading them across the kitchen table. Adoption. Fostering. Surrogacy. The words were clinical, bureaucratic, but they represented a future so full of hope it felt dazzling. Jake, the man who had once navigated the complex legal frameworks of a thousand different worlds, found a strange, poignant irony in poring over UK family law statutes and the dizzying array of forms required by social services. He applied the same meticulous focus he had once used to plan supply routes for a rebel fleet to understanding the criteria for prospective adoptive parents. He and Liam would sit for hours, mugs of tea growing cold beside them, discussing the profound questions posed by the sterile paperwork. What were their strengths as a couple? How would they handle conflict? What were their hopes and dreams for a child? Each question, designed to assess their suitability for parenthood, served instead to deepen their own bond, forcing them to articulate the unspoken truths of their relationship. They were not just filling out forms; they were writing the constitution of their new family.\n\nOne night, faced with a section titled \u2018Personal History and Support Network\u2019, Jake faltered. His own history was a redacted document, a tapestry of lies and omissions. His support network consisted entirely of the man sitting opposite him. \u201cThey\u2019ll want references,\u201d he said, his voice flat. \u201cThey\u2019ll want to talk to people who have known me for years. Friends. Family. Colleagues.\u201d The impossibility of it all felt like a sudden, insurmountable wall. He had spent decades ensuring no such people existed. Liam reached across the table and gently closed the folder. \u201cThen we tell the truth,\u201d he said, his tone unwavering. \u201cWell, a version of it.\u201d He smiled, a small, conspiratorial grin. \u201cYou\u2019re a man who lost everyone in a political conflict overseas. You moved here seeking peace and quiet. You\u2019re intensely private because of that trauma. You have no living relatives. Your only support network is me. It\u2019s all true. Just\u2026 edited for a terrestrial audience.\u201d The way he said it, so simply, so pragmatically, stripped the problem of its power. He wasn\u2019t asking Jake to lie. He was helping him frame a truth that was too large and too strange for a standard form. He was translating Jake\u2019s life into a language the world could understand.\n\nThe most challenging conversation, they both knew, would be with Alan. Liam decided to face it head-on, inviting his father over for Sunday lunch a few weeks later. The atmosphere was noticeably different from his last visit. Alan was more subdued, the booming certainty slightly diminished, as if his previous encounter with their quiet, united front had left a lasting impression. He still looked out of place in their comfortable, slightly cluttered home, a hawk in a pigeon-coop, but his energy was less intrusive. Over lunch, after a stretch of awkward small talk about the weather and the state of the construction industry, Liam took a deep breath and made his announcement. \u201cJake and I are going to start a family,\u201d he said, his voice clear and steady. \u201cWe\u2019ve started the adoption process.\u201d Alan froze, a forkful of roast potato halfway to his mouth. He stared at Liam, then at Jake, his mind visibly struggling to process the information. Jake braced himself for an explosion, for a lecture on responsibility or tradition or the madness of it all. Instead, a strange, complex series of emotions played across Alan\u2019s face: confusion, disbelief, and then, unexpectedly, something else. Something that looked almost like pride.\n\n\u201cA family,\u201d Alan said, his voice a low rumble. He put his fork down. The builder, the man who thought in dynasties of concrete and steel, understood the concept of legacy better than anyone. A company could fail, a building could be torn down, but a child, a grandchild\u2014that was a structure built to last. He looked at his son, truly looked at him, and for the first time, he seemed to see not a directionless hobbyist, but a man making a serious, life-altering commitment. A man building something profound. \u201cA kid needs a proper workshop,\u201d Alan said gruffly, looking around the small kitchen. \u201cCan\u2019t have him learning woodwork in a drafty shed. We\u2019ll need to build a proper extension. Insulated. With good light.\u201d He looked at Jake, his gaze sharp and appraising. \u201cAnd you. You\u2019re home all day. You\u2019ll need a study. A proper office. Can\u2019t have paperwork all over the kitchen table.\u201d It was his way of giving his blessing. He couldn\u2019t engage with the emotional architecture, but he understood the practical one. He saw a project, a build, a chance to contribute in the only way he knew how. It was an offer of help, a clumsy but genuine act of love, and it was his own form of surrender.\n\nThat night, long after Alan had left, leaving behind not blueprints but an offer to draw some up, Jake found himself unable to sleep. He slipped out of bed, careful not to wake Liam, and went to the spare room, which was slowly being transformed from a storage space into a future child\u2019s bedroom. The moonlight fell through the window, illuminating the bare walls and empty floor. This room, more than any other, represented the future. It was a space of pure potential. He sat on the floor in the centre of the room and closed his eyes, sinking into a state of meditation. He did not seek to detach, to dissolve into the cosmic tide. He did the opposite. He gathered himself, focusing his senses inward, on the quiet, steady beat of his own heart. He thought of the Jedi litany. *There is no emotion, there is peace.* It was a lie. There was emotion. His chest was filled with a terrifying, exhilarating ocean of it: love for Liam, hope for this child, a fierce, protective instinct that was more powerful than any weapon he had ever wielded. *There is no passion, there is serenity.* Another lie. His passion for this new life was a burning sun, a source of immense energy and light. *There is no death, there is the Force.* This, he realised, was the only part that was true, but the Jedi had misunderstood it. They saw it as an escape from the grief of personal loss. But sitting here, in this empty room, Jake understood it differently. The Force was not an escape from death; it was the thread of life that connected everything, that wove new lives from the threads of the old. Alderaan was gone, but its people, its culture, its peace\u2014all of it existed within him, a part of the great, flowing river. And soon, he would get to pour that legacy, that love, into a new vessel. He would teach a child about courage and kindness, about listening to the world around them, about how to build things that last. He would not teach them to fear attachment, but to embrace it as the source of all strength. He was not the last of the old Jedi. He was the first of something new."

                                        "text": "The adoption process, Jake discovered, was a strange and humbling form of archaeology. It involved digging through the layers of one\u2019s own life, cleaning off the dust and debris, and presenting the findings for rigorous inspection. Their social worker, a woman named Sarah with tired, kind eyes and a sensible haircut, became a regular visitor. She would sit at their kitchen table, the same pine surface that had borne witness to their entire relationship, and ask questions that were both deeply personal and clinically detached. Jake, who had once stood before the Jedi Council and defended his strategies for entire star sectors, found himself more nervous discussing his cleaning rota and his views on discipline with this quiet, perceptive woman. He had to exert a conscious, disciplined effort not to use the Force, not to seek a glimpse of her thoughts or feelings. To do so would have felt like a profound violation, a form of cheating on the most important test of his life. His task was simply to be present, to be honest, and to trust that the truth of what he and Liam had built together would be enough.\n\nLiam was their anchor through it all. Where Jake\u2019s history was a carefully edited narrative, Liam\u2019s was an open book, rich with the texture of real, lived life. He spoke of his grandfather with a simple, unaffected love that made the old man a palpable presence in the room. He talked about his work not as a job, but as a vocation, his belief in the value of soil and patience shining through every word. When Sarah asked him why he wanted to be a father, he didn\u2019t offer a prepared, perfect answer. He simply looked at Jake, a quick, warm glance, before turning back to her. \u201cBecause I was lucky enough to have a good home,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I think everyone deserves that. And because I\u2019ve found the person I want to build that home with. It\u2019s the next thing that needs to grow in the garden.\u201d The answer was so perfectly, beautifully him that Jake felt a familiar, powerful wave of love crest in his chest.\n\nThe process was not without its moments of quiet terror. During one visit, Sarah, leafing through her notes, asked Jake a follow-up question about his past. \u201cYour file says your work in logistics involved a lot of time in conflict zones,\u201d she said, her pen poised. \u201cThat must have been incredibly stressful. How do you feel it affects you now?\u201d The question was a minefield. He couldn\u2019t speak of the Clone Wars, of the screams of dying men echoing through his helmet, of the gut-wrenching responsibility of sending troops into battles they might not survive. He had to find the terrestrial translation. He took a slow breath, focusing on the genuine emotion, the core truth of the experience. \u201cIt taught me that some things, once broken, can\u2019t be fixed,\u201d he said, his voice low and steady. \u201cIt taught me the value of peace. A true, quiet peace, not just the absence of fighting. And it taught me that you can\u2019t protect anyone or anything if you, yourself, are falling apart.\u201d He looked up, meeting her gaze. \u201cComing here, building this life, tending this garden\u2026 it was how I put myself back together. I am not the man I was then.\u201d Sarah held his gaze for a long moment, and he could see her assessing the weight of his words. He had offered her the scar, not the story of the wound, and she seemed to understand. She made a brief note on her pad and nodded, accepting the answer.\n\nIn parallel with this emotional excavation, a more literal one began. Alan, true to his word, descended upon their quiet corner of Surrey with the force of a small, benevolent hurricane. A mini-digger arrived on a flatbed truck, and the gentle sounds of the garden were replaced by the roar of its engine and the rhythmic clank of its hydraulic arm. The ground behind the house was torn up, foundations were poured, and a timber frame began to rise against the back wall. It was loud, it was messy, and it was the most wonderful chaos Jake had ever experienced. Alan was in his element, a whirlwind of energy, directing his small crew, arguing amicably with Liam about the best way to flash the lead on the roof, and ensuring every angle was true and every joint was perfect. He treated Jake with a new, gruff respect, consulting him on the placement of windows for the best light, and accepting the steady supply of tea and bacon sandwiches Jake provided as if it were a crucial component of the project. The extension was Alan\u2019s love language, a physical manifestation of his acceptance, a testament in timber and brick to the future of their family.\n\nMonths passed. The raw timber of the extension was clad and roofed, the seasons turned, and the hellebores bloomed, faded, and were replaced by the bright, hopeful charge of daffodils along the path. The social worker visits became less frequent, the questions less probing. They had presented their life for inspection, and all they could do now was wait for the verdict. The waiting was a unique form of quiet torture, a state of suspended animation where every ring of the phone sent a jolt of adrenaline through their systems. They tried to distract themselves, focusing on their work, on the garden, on the slow, satisfying job of plastering the interior walls of the new study and bedroom. But the unspoken question hung in the air, a constant, low-grade hum of its own. Then, one Tuesday afternoon, as they were clearing up in the garden after a day of work, the phone rang. Liam, his hands covered in mud, wiped them on his trousers and answered, putting the call on speaker. It was Sarah. Her voice was professional, but there was an unmistakable warmth in it. \u201cLiam, Jake,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m calling from the agency. We\u2019ve just had the final panel decision.\u201d Jake\u2019s heart stopped. The world seemed to fall silent, the chatter of the birds and the distant traffic noise fading to nothing. He held Liam\u2019s gaze, seeing his own mixture of terror and hope reflected there. \u201cYour application has been approved,\u201d Sarah said, her voice breaking into a smile. \u201cCongratulations. You\u2019re going to be parents.\u201d\n\nFor a moment, they just stood there, frozen, the words hanging in the quiet afternoon air. Approved. A simple, bureaucratic word that changed the entire shape of the universe. Liam\u2019s phone slipped from his muddy fingers, falling unnoticed onto the soft grass. His face crumpled, and a single, loud, ragged sob of pure, unadulterated joy broke from him. He lunged forward, wrapping his arms around Jake in a fierce, crushing embrace, burying his face in his shoulder. Jake held him, his own vision blurring, a feeling of overwhelming gratitude washing over him, so immense it felt like the Force itself was weeping with him. He could feel Liam\u2019s heart hammering against his own, a wild, joyful drumbeat. He tipped his head back, looking at the ordinary, blue English sky, and thought of the ghost-world of Alderaan, of the Jedi Temple, of the long, lonely years of his exile. All of it, all the pain and the loss, had led him here, to this moment, to this man, to this garden, to this impossible, miraculous gift. They were approved. The map they had decided to draw now had its first, real landmark. Their future had a name, and it was \u2018family\u2019."

                                        "text": "The world came back into focus slowly, pixel by pixel. The first thing Jake became aware of was the solid, shaking warmth of Liam in his arms. The second was the damp, earthy smell of the lawn, pressed into his cheek. The third was the sound of Liam\u2019s ragged, joyful sobs, muffled against the fabric of his shoulder. He held him tighter, a silent, reciprocal confirmation of the impossible news. His own tears were silent, tracking hot paths through the dust and grime on his cheeks. Through the Force, the garden seemed to sing, a vibrant, multi-layered chorus of life that had been there all along, but which he was only now hearing in its full glory. The steady, slow life-force of the old silver birch, the tenacious ambition of the roses, the quiet, underground work of the worms in the soil\u2014it all swelled into a single, triumphant symphony. They had been approved. The universe, in its strange, circuitous way, had looked at the life they had built in this small, quiet corner of the Earth, and it had approved.\n\nThey finally separated, their faces tear-streaked and ridiculously, deliriously happy. Liam, laughing through his tears, wiped a muddy hand across his face, leaving a comical smear of dirt on his forehead. Jake reached out and gently brushed it away with his thumb, the simple, tender gesture feeling more intimate than any kiss. They left the phone where it had fallen on the grass and went inside, tracking mud into the hallway without a care. They didn\u2019t speak. They just moved into the kitchen and held each other again, a long, quiet embrace in the centre of the room, swaying slightly as if in a slow dance. Later, after they had washed their faces and made a pot of tea they were too elated to drink, Liam made the second most important call of the day. He rang his father. Jake could hear Alan\u2019s booming voice, tinny through the phone\u2019s speaker, questioning and impatient at first. Then Liam said the words, \u201cJake and I have been approved. We\u2019re going to have a child.\u201d A sudden, profound silence fell on the other end of the line. When Alan finally spoke, his voice was thick, raw with an emotion Jake had never heard from him before. \u201cA grandchild,\u201d he said, the words heavy with disbelief and a deep, foundational joy. \u201cMy god, Liam. A grandchild.\u201d The architect had just been given the most important project of his life.\n\nThe waiting that followed was of a different quality. The anxious, open-ended uncertainty of the approval process was replaced by a more focused, more potent sense of anticipation. They were no longer waiting for a verdict, but for a person. The new, unfinished bedroom at the end of the hall, with its fresh plaster and smell of paint, became the focal point of their home. It was a space of pure potential, and they found themselves drawn to it, standing together in the doorway, imagining it filled with a bed, with toys, with the small, untidy chaos of a child\u2019s life. Jake, the man who had meditated in vast, empty temples and stared into the infinite blackness between stars, found a deeper sense of peace standing in that empty, sunlit room with Liam, imagining a future he had never believed he was allowed to have. Their conversations became softer, more speculative. \u201cDo you think he\u2019ll like to draw?\u201d Liam would wonder aloud. \u201cOr will she be someone who wants to kick a ball around the garden?\u201d The pronouns were fluid, the child a shimmering, undefined possibility, but the love for them was already a solid, tangible thing.\n\nThe call came on a grey Thursday morning. Sarah\u2019s voice was warm and professional as ever. \u201cWe have a possible match for you,\u201d she said. \u201cA little boy. His name is Leo. Would you be able to come into the office this afternoon to read his profile?\u201d The world tilted on its axis once again. They drove to the agency in a state of quiet, nervous reverence, as if travelling to a sacred place. They were led into a small, quiet meeting room, and Sarah slid a thin blue folder across the table towards them. It looked so innocuous, so slender, to contain the entire history of a human life. Jake\u2019s hands trembled slightly as he reached for it. He opened it, and the first thing he saw was a photograph, a slightly blurry, black-and-white school picture. A small, serious face stared back at him. A boy with large, dark, watchful eyes, a thatch of unruly dark hair, and a mouth held in a firm, unsmiling line. He was six years old.\n\nJake didn\u2019t need the Force to feel the weight of the story contained in the typed pages. The clinical, social-worker language painted a picture of profound instability: a succession of foster homes, each placement breaking down for different reasons, a history of neglect that had left him wary and withdrawn. The words \u2018struggles to form attachments\u2019 and \u2018finds it difficult to trust adults\u2019 leaped from the page, each one a small, sharp blow to Jake\u2019s heart. He could feel the spirit of the boy, not as a vision, but as a faint, flickering impression in the Force\u2014a tiny, guarded flame, accustomed to being shielded from the wind, terrified of being put out. It was a spirit that had learned, as Jake himself had once learned, that survival depends on not letting anyone get too close. The file noted his interests in a short, poignant list: drawing, building things with blocks, and watching nature documentaries. He was a quiet observer, a boy who preferred to watch the world from a safe distance.\n\nJake slid the folder across the table to Liam. He watched as his partner read, his brow furrowed in concentration. He saw Liam\u2019s expression soften as he looked at the photograph, his gaze lingering on the boy\u2019s serious, unsmiling face. Liam didn\u2019t see a list of problems or a case file of trauma. He saw a child. \u201cHe likes drawing,\u201d Liam said softly, looking up at Jake, his eyes shining with a fierce, protective light. \u201cWe can set him up a little table in the new study, by the window overlooking the garden. And building blocks. He likes building things.\u201d Liam\u2019s mind was already at work, not analyzing the past, but constructing a future. He was already building a space for this quiet, watchful boy, making a place where he could feel safe. He was already figuring out how to earn his trust. He looked at the last line of the report. \u201cHe\u2019s scared of loud noises,\u201d he murmured, and then he looked at Jake, a complete, silent understanding passing between them. They both knew a man who had chosen a life of quiet over a world of noise. They understood.\n\nThere was no discussion, no debate. There was no need. The decision had been made the moment they saw the photograph, the moment they read the story of the small, serious boy who liked to build things and was scared of loud noises. They had built a quiet harbour, a place of solid foundations and deep roots, and here was the very ship that needed to find it. Jake looked at Liam, at the absolute certainty and love in his eyes, and felt his own heart settle into a deep, unshakable resolve. This was not a strategic decision. It was not a choice weighed against probabilities or potential outcomes. It was an act of recognition. He picked up his phone and dialled Sarah\u2019s extension. When she answered, he didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cWe\u2019ve read Leo\u2019s file,\u201d Jake said, his voice clear and steady, with Liam\u2019s hand covering his on the table. \u201cThe answer is yes. A thousand times, yes.\u201d He hung up the phone and looked at his partner. A new map had been drawn, and their next destination was now marked with a name. Their journey to find Leo was about to begin."

                                        "text": "The period between saying \"yes\" and the first scheduled \"introduction\" was a new kind of waiting. It was active, focused, and filled with a quiet, purposeful energy. The empty room at the end of the hall ceased to be a space of abstract potential and became, simply, Leo's room. They painted the walls a soft, calming shade of sage green, a colour that reminded Jake of the peaceful morning light in the garden. Liam, in his element, set to work in the shed, crafting a small, sturdy desk from leftover planks of oak, its surface sanded to a silken finish. He built it low to the ground, with rounded corners, a piece of furniture that was solid and dependable, yet unintimidating. Jake\u2019s contribution was less tangible. He spent time in the room alone, not meditating in the traditional sense, but simply being present, allowing the space to absorb his own hard-won sense of peace. He gently smoothed out the psychic echoes of the room\u2019s previous life as a storage space for his grief, replacing them with a quiet, steady hum of welcome. He didn\u2019t try to fill it with joy or excitement\u2014he knew the boy was wary of loud emotions. Instead, he imbued the room with a sense of calm permission: permission to be quiet, permission to be watchful, permission to be exactly who he was, without any pressure to be anything else.\n\nThe first meeting took place on a crisp autumn afternoon in a place that felt deliberately, almost painfully, neutral. It was a designated \"contact centre,\" a building with cheerful but slightly faded posters on the walls, scuffed but brightly coloured furniture, and the faint, institutional smell of cleaning products and weak tea. Sarah greeted them at the door, her smile warm but her eyes professional. She led them to a playroom filled with durable plastic toys and a small, low table set with paper and crayons. The artificiality of the environment was jarring after the organic, lived-in peace of their own home. Jake could feel the accumulated layers of emotion in the room\u2014a faint, lingering residue of a hundred other awkward, hopeful, and painful meetings. He took a deep breath, consciously shielding himself from the noise, focusing only on the quiet strength of Liam standing beside him.\n\nWhen Leo entered the room, holding the hand of his current foster carer, he was smaller than his photograph had suggested. A small, self-contained unit of fierce vigilance. He wore a neat blue jumper and jeans, and his dark hair was brushed, but a single tuft stood up stubbornly at the back of his head. He did not look at them. His gaze was fixed firmly on the floor a few feet in front of him, his small face set in a stony, expressionless mask. He was a fortress, his walls built high and thick. Jake felt the boy\u2019s presence in the Force not as a flickering flame, but as a tightly coiled spring, a knot of fear, suspicion, and a profound, bone-deep weariness that no six-year-old should possess. It was the energy of a creature that has learned that the only safety lies in being utterly still and unnoticeable. Jake\u2019s heart contracted with a painful surge of recognition. He knew that posture. He had worn it himself for decades.\n\nSarah facilitated the introduction with a gentle, practiced ease. \u201cLeo, this is Jake, and this is Liam,\u201d she said softly. Leo gave no sign that he had heard. Jake and Liam had discussed this moment at length. Their strategy was simple: to be as unthreatening as a pair of old garden chairs. They didn\u2019t rush forward or shower him with false enthusiasm. They simply sat down at the small table, a little distance away, and Liam, with a quiet deliberation, picked up a blue crayon and a piece of paper. He didn't speak to Leo. He spoke to Jake. \u201cI was thinking about that kestrel we saw over the fields yesterday,\u201d he murmured, and began to sketch the rough, angular shape of a bird of prey. Jake just nodded, watching Liam\u2019s hand move. They were creating a small, quiet bubble of their own normal, non-demanding life, leaving the door open for Leo to peer inside if he chose, with no pressure to enter. Leo, meanwhile, had gravitated to the far corner of the room, where a large box of wooden building blocks was stored. He began to build, his small back turned resolutely towards them, his movements precise and economical. He was constructing a wall, a literal barrier between himself and the two strange men in the room.\n\nFor nearly an hour, this tableau held. The only sounds were the soft scratch of Liam\u2019s crayon on paper and the quiet, deliberate clink of Leo\u2019s wooden blocks. Jake did not try to project calm or use the Force to soothe the boy. He knew that would be an invasion, a psychic trespass on the boy\u2019s carefully constructed defences. All he could do was be calm himself, to radiate a stillness that was genuine. He sat, and he waited, and he let the boy be. Finally, Liam finished his drawing. It was a simple, powerful sketch of a kestrel hovering, its wings spread, its head cocked as if listening. He didn't offer it to Leo. He simply placed it on the edge of the table, angled slightly towards the boy\u2019s corner. He and Jake stood up, signalling to Sarah that their time was ending. As Leo\u2019s foster carer came to collect him, as they all said their quiet goodbyes, Jake saw it. Leo, who had not looked up once, let his gaze flicker for a fraction of a second towards the table. His eyes, large and dark and full of a fierce, guarded intelligence, rested on the drawing of the kestrel. It was a glance so fleeting it was almost imaginary. But it had happened. The fortress walls had not come down, but a single, curious eye had peered through a crack. It was enough. It was everything.\n\nIn the car on the way home, Liam was quiet, his hands tight on the steering wheel. \u201cHe didn\u2019t even look at us,\u201d he said finally, his voice laced with a disappointment he was trying to hide. \u201cIt was like we weren\u2019t even there.\u201d Jake reached over and placed a hand on his arm. \u201cHe saw you, Liam,\u201d he said, his own voice full of a quiet certainty. \u201cHe saw everything. He saw you not pushing him. He saw you not talking down to him. He saw you drawing a bird. And at the end, he looked at it.\u201d Liam glanced at him, a question in his eyes. \u201cThat fortress he\u2019s built,\u201d Jake continued, choosing his words carefully, \u201cit\u2019s an incredible piece of architecture. It\u2019s taken him his whole life to build it, and it\u2019s what has kept him safe. You can\u2019t expect him to tear it down in an hour because two strangers smiled at him. All we can do is sit outside the walls, quietly, and show him that it\u2019s safe to come out. And today, he looked over the wall. That\u2019s a bigger victory than you can imagine.\u201d Liam\u2019s hands relaxed on the wheel. He looked at Jake, his expression clearing as he absorbed the truth of what he was saying. He nodded slowly, a small smile touching his lips. \u201cA different kind of architecture,\u201d he said, the old phrase now taking on a new, more profound meaning. They drove the rest of the way home in a comfortable, hopeful silence, their shared purpose stronger than ever. They were not besieging a fortress; they were becoming a harbour. And they would wait, for as long as it took, for the small, wary ship to decide it was safe to come in."
