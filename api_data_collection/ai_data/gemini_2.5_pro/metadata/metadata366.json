     "novel_text": "The salt was the first thing. Always. It was in the air, a fine, gritty mist that coated your tongue and worked its way into the seams of your clothes. It crusted on the windows of the beachfront caf\u00e9 where Liam poured a hundred flat whites a day, his Bachelor of Marketing degree a bitter joke curled up in a cardboard tube under his bed. The glare off the Coral Sea was a physical force, a relentless, shimmering sheet of white that made you squint your life away. Some people called it paradise. To Liam, it was a beautiful cage. A waiting room with a spectacular view.\n\nHis phone lay face up on the stainless-steel counter, next to a slurry of spilled milk and coffee grounds. It hadn\u2019t buzzed, chirped, or otherwise acknowledged its own existence in the past hour, an hour during which Liam had mentally replayed his final audition performance at least fifty times. He\u2019d sung \u2018Hallelujah\u2019, a choice his mate Jake had called \u2018braver than a one-legged man in an arse-kicking contest\u2019. The judges had stood up. Even the hard-faced one, the one who looked like his soul had been surgically replaced with a lump of coal, had cracked a smile that was less a smile and more a brief, terrifying glimpse of his dental work. They\u2019d loved him. They\u2019d said he had a voice that could \u2018heal the sick and raise the dead\u2019. But that was a week ago. A lifetime. In the brutal, compressed reality of television, a week was an eternity. The silence from Sydney was a growing, monstrous thing.\n\n\u201cOi, dreamer. Table four wants another one of your swamp-waters.\u201d The voice belonged to Mel, the caf\u00e9 owner, a woman whose face was a roadmap of every bad decision she\u2019d ever made, most of them involving the sun and cheap cigarettes.\n\nLiam flinched, snapping back to the hiss of the steam wand. \u201cComing.\u201d He wiped the counter with a sour-smelling rag, his eyes flicking back to the phone. Nothing. The screen was a black mirror reflecting his own anxious face. Twenty-three years old, a piece of paper that said he was qualified for a life he didn\u2019t want, and a voice that felt like a secret weapon with a faulty trigger. He\u2019d been singing since he could talk, serenading the gulls on Mooloolaba beach, belting out tunes in the shower until the hot water ran cold. It was the only thing that felt real, the only part of him that wasn't just going through the motions. This X-Factor thing\u2026 it wasn\u2019t just a contest. It was a jailbreak.\n\nHe frothed the milk, the high-pitched scream of the machine a decent match for the one in his own head. He poured it into the cup, his hand attempting a wobbly fern. It came out looking more like a distressed ghost. He sighed, sliding the cup onto a saucer. Another masterpiece. As he turned to take it to the table, his phone buzzed. Not a polite little notification buzz. This was a full-body, rattling convulsion against the steel.\n\nThe cup clattered back onto the counter, spilling a tidal wave of brown liquid. Mel yelled something from the kitchen. Liam didn't hear her. His heart was a frantic drum against his ribs. The screen lit up. Blocked Number. It was always a blocked number. His hand was shaking so badly he almost swiped the call away. He jammed the green icon.\n\n\u201cHello?\u201d His voice was a reedy squeak. He cleared his throat. \u201cHello?\u201d\n\n\u201cIs this Liam Harrison?\u201d A woman\u2019s voice, crisp and bored, filtered through the speaker. The sound of a hundred other important calls being made in the background.\n\n\u201cYes. Speaking.\u201d\n\n\u201cLiam, it\u2019s Brenda May from Syco Productions.\u201d\n\nThe world went into slow motion. A fly buzzed lazily near the sugar packets. The clatter from the kitchen faded into a dull roar. Brenda May. He knew the name. She was the show\u2019s puppet master, the executive producer whose name appeared in the credits for a fraction of a second but who held the fates of every hopeful in her immaculately manicured hands.\n\n\u201cRight. Hello,\u201d he managed, trying to sound casual, like he got calls from TV producers every day.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve made our decision regarding the final three,\u201d she said, her tone flat, giving nothing away. \u201cThe panel was\u2026 divided on the last spot.\u201d\n\nOh, God. Here it came. The polite letdown. *Thanks for coming, you were great, just not what we\u2019re looking for this year, feel free to queue for eight hours again next year.* He could already feel the hope draining out of him, leaving a familiar, hollow ache.\n\n\u201cBut Simon\u2019s a big fan of the \u2018surfer-boy-with-the-voice-of-an-angel\u2019 narrative,\u201d she continued, the words dripping with a cynicism that could curdle milk. \u201cIt tests well with the 18-to-35 female demographic. Congratulations, Liam. You\u2019re in the final. A car will pick you up at 0800 tomorrow. Pack for two weeks. Don\u2019t be late.\u201d\n\nAnd then, a click. The line was dead.\n\nLiam stood frozen, the phone still pressed to his ear, listening to the dial tone. He looked at the spilled coffee, at the fly, at the faded posters of surf competitions on the wall. Nothing had changed. And everything had. A laugh bubbled up from his chest, a strange, hysterical sound. He was in. He was in the final. He slammed the phone down on the counter and let out a whoop that rattled the sugar shakers and made the tourists at table four jump.\n\n\u201cWhat the hell is wrong with you, Harrison?\u201d Mel screeched, poking her head out of the kitchen.\n\n\u201cI quit!\u201d he yelled, a giddy, reckless grin spreading across his face. \u201cI bloody quit!\u201d\n\nThe flight to Sydney was a jarring transition from one world to another. He left behind a tearful, proud mother who\u2019d pressed a hundred dollars into his hand and told him to \u2018show those city slickers what a Mooloolaba boy can do\u2019. He left behind Jake, who\u2019d hugged him hard at the tiny Sunshine Coast airport and whispered, \u201cDon\u2019t come back, mate. Not until you\u2019ve won the whole bloody thing.\u201d He left behind the familiar, humid embrace of the coast, the smell of salt and hot pavement, the caw of gulls.\n\nHe landed in a world of grey steel, cold glass, and air that tasted of exhaust fumes and ambition. The car that picked him up was a black town car with tinted windows, the kind of vehicle he\u2019d only ever seen in movies. He felt like an imposter, a kid in fancy dress, his worn-out jeans and surf-brand t-shirt screamingly out of place. The driver, a burly man who didn\u2019t say a word the entire trip, dropped him outside a towering hotel in the city centre, a monolith of reflective windows that seemed to swallow the sky.\n\nThe lobby was an exercise in sterile opulence. White marble floors, chrome fixtures, art on the walls that looked expensive and meaningless. A woman with a clipboard and a headset intercepted him before he could even reach the check-in desk.\n\n\u201cLiam Harrison?\u201d she asked, her smile tight and professional. \u201cI\u2019m Sarah, one of the production assistants. We\u2019ve got you on floor 22. All the finalists are on the same floor. Keep you all together. Makes it easier for the camera crews.\u201d\n\nCamera crews. Right. He\u2019d forgotten about that part. The constant surveillance. Life in the fishbowl.\n\nSarah led him to a dedicated lift, her heels clicking an efficient rhythm on the marble. \u201cYour schedule is on the tablet in your room. Vocal coaching at ten, choreography at one, media training at three. We\u2019re filming your \u2018arrival\u2019 segment in an hour, so get settled, maybe look a bit overwhelmed and grateful. It plays well.\u201d\n\nHis room was bigger than his entire apartment back home. A king-sized bed with a mountain of pillows, a floor-to-ceiling window with a terrifyingly beautiful view of the sprawling city, and a bathroom that looked like it had been stolen from a design magazine. On the bed lay a pile of new clothes\u2014branded tracksuits, t-shirts, and a hoodie, all with the X-Factor logo emblazoned on them. His new uniform. A part of the machine.\n\nHe was just unpacking his own meagre belongings when there was a sharp knock at the door. He opened it to find a guy leaning against the doorframe, a picture of effortless cool. He was tall, with artfully messy dark hair, teeth that were too white to be natural, and a confident smirk that seemed to be his default expression.\n\n\u201cLiam, right? The coastal kid?\u201d the guy said, his voice smooth as silk. He extended a hand. \u201cRex Vance. Great to finally meet the competition.\u201d\n\nLiam shook his hand. Rex\u2019s grip was firm, practiced. A salesman\u2019s handshake. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s me. Good to meet you, too.\u201d He recognised him from the audition shows. Rex was the Sydney native, the one with the slick pop-R&B style and the sob story about a sick grandmother that Liam suspected was at least 50% fabricated for the cameras.\n\n\u201cHeard your audition,\u201d Rex continued, his eyes scanning Liam\u2019s room, taking in the cheap duffel bag and worn guitar case. \u201cThat whole raw, emotional thing. Smart angle. Very authentic.\u201d The way he said \u2018authentic\u2019 made it sound like a carefully chosen marketing strategy. \u201cMe, I\u2019m more about the performance. The spectacle. People want a star, you know? Not just a voice.\u201d He clapped Liam on the shoulder, a gesture that was meant to seem friendly but felt more like a sizing-up. \u201cAnyway, welcome to the snake pit. Just remember, there\u2019s only one crown.\u201d He winked, then sauntered off down the hallway, leaving Liam with a faint, unsettling feeling, like he\u2019d just been pleasantly threatened.\n\nA moment later, a smaller, much more flustered figure appeared in the doorway. It was Chloe, the sixteen-year-old country girl from Tamworth with the powerhouse voice and the stage fright so bad she almost fainted during her first audition.\n\n\u201cOh, hi,\u201d she said, clutching a notebook to her chest. \u201cWas that Rex?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe one and only,\u201d Liam said with a wry smile.\n\n\u201cHe told me my \u2018farm-girl charm\u2019 was a real asset but that I needed to work on my 'brand synergy',\u201d she said, her brow furrowed in confusion. \u201cI don\u2019t even know what that means.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he does either,\u201d Liam laughed, and for the first time since landing, he felt a genuine sense of connection. Chloe\u2019s bewildered honesty was a welcome antidote to Rex\u2019s polished insincerity.\n\n\u201cYour view is amazing,\u201d she said, peering past him into the room. \u201cAll I can see is a brick wall and a pipe.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s\u2026 a lot,\u201d he said, looking out at the endless grid of lights and concrete. The city stretched out below them, a vast, glittering, indifferent beast. It was a long way from the gentle curve of Mooloolaba bay. He felt a pang of homesickness, sharp and sudden. He thought of his mum, probably just finishing her shift, wiping down the sticky tables at the surf club. He thought of the familiar constellations he could see from his bedroom window. Out here, the city lights bleached the sky, erasing the stars. He was in the final. It was everything he\u2019d ever wanted. And he had never felt more alone. He took a deep breath, the refrigerated air stinging his lungs. He had to win. There was no going back now.The brief moment of camaraderie with Chloe was a small, floating piece of driftwood in a vast and overwhelming ocean. They talked for a few minutes in the hallway, their voices hushed, conspiratorial. She told him about her family\u2019s sheep farm, the pre-dawn starts, and how singing to the hills was the only way to make the loneliness bearable. He told her about the endless horizon of the Coral Sea, the rhythm of the tides, and the feeling of singing with a lungful of salt air. They were from opposite ends of the country, from landscapes that couldn't be more different, yet they recognised in each other the same fundamental truth: they were singers, not performers. They were voices trapped in ordinary lives, now suddenly thrust into an extraordinary, terrifying spotlight.\n\nTheir quiet conversation was shattered by the return of Sarah, the PA, who clapped her hands together with a brisk, cheerless efficiency. \u201cAlright, lovebirds, time to make the magic happen. Liam, you\u2019re first. We\u2019re doing your arrival shot. We\u2019ll get you walking down the hallway, looking awestruck, then you\u2019ll enter your room and be, you know, blown away by the view. We\u2019ve already got B-roll of you looking pensively out the window.\u201d Liam stared at her. B-roll? They had been filming him already? He felt a prickle of violation, the unnerving sense that his life was no longer his own, but a collection of clips to be edited together for maximum emotional impact.\n\nThe next hour was one of the most surreal of his life. A two-man camera crew, a sound guy with a long, furry boom mic, and a director named Gaz who wore a backwards baseball cap and spoke in a stream of baffling industry jargon, crowded into the hallway. \"Okay, Liam, mate, action!\" Gaz commanded. \"Walk towards me. Slow it down. Think 'kid in a candy store'. Your whole life has led to this moment. More wonder! Give me more wonder!\" Liam tried to look wondrous. He felt like a complete idiot, acutely aware of Rex leaning against his own doorway down the hall, watching the whole charade with an amused smirk. \"Cut!\" Gaz yelled. \"A bit wooden, mate. Let's go again. This time, as you walk, I want you to touch the wall, like you can't believe it's real. Feel the texture. Connect with the space.\" Liam touched the wall. It felt like a wall.\n\nAfter four takes of him walking down a hallway, they moved into his room. \u201cOkay, now the window,\u201d Gaz directed. \u201cGo to the window, look out, and just\u2026 react. Give me that \u2018Wow, a simple boy from a small town overwhelmed by the big city\u2019 vibe. That's your narrative. Stick to it.\u201d Liam looked out the window. It was the same view he\u2019d been looking at for the last hour. He tried to dredge up the initial awe, but all he felt was a hollow sense of fakery. \u201cCan you maybe say something?\u201d Gaz prompted. \u201c\u2018Wow\u2019, or \u2018This is insane\u2019, something organic.\u201d Liam took a breath. \u201cWow,\u201d he said, his voice flat. \u201cThis is insane.\u201d Rex, still watching from the hall, let out a soft chuckle. The director sighed. \u201cWe\u2019ll fix it in post.\u201d\n\nVocal coaching was a relief, a return to solid ground. The coach was a woman in her late sixties named Eleanor Vance, whose stern expression and severe grey bun did little to hide the sharp intelligence in her eyes. She wasn\u2019t affiliated with the show, but was a legendary figure in the Sydney music scene, a guru who had trained opera singers and rock stars alike. The studio was a small, soundproofed room, free of cameras and production assistants. It felt like a sanctuary.\n\nEleanor didn't waste time with pleasantries. \u201cAlright, Mr. Harrison. The producers are selling you as the raw, untamed talent. Let\u2019s see if there\u2019s any truth in the marketing. Give me a major scale. A cappella.\u201d Liam, relieved to be doing the one thing he was confident in, sang. The notes filled the small room, clear and strong. Eleanor closed her eyes, listening not just to the pitch but to the texture, the breath, the intent behind the sound. She had him run through arpeggios, test the top and bottom of his range, and sing passages in different volumes. She didn't praise him. She just listened, her expression unreadable.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve never had a lesson in your life, have you?\u201d she finally stated, opening her eyes. \u201cNo,\u201d Liam admitted, a knot of anxiety tightening in his stomach. \u201cIt shows,\u201d she said, and his heart sank. \u201cYour technique is a mess. You\u2019re singing from your throat on your high notes, your breath support is inconsistent, and you hold tension in your jaw. In six months of a heavy performance schedule, you\u2019d tear your vocal cords to shreds.\u201d She paused, letting the clinical assessment hang in the air. \u201cBut,\u201d she continued, a flicker of something new in her gaze, \u201cyou have something I can\u2019t teach. It\u2019s a rare quality. A direct line from your heart to your voice. There\u2019s no filter. No artifice. It\u2019s honest. That\u2019s why they stood up. Don\u2019t ever let them train that out of you.\u201d She then spent the next hour giving him a series of breathing exercises, tools not to change his voice, but to protect it. It was the first time all day anyone had spoken to him about something real.\n\nThe feeling of groundedness evaporated the moment he stepped into the dance studio. It was a vast, mirror-walled room, bright and intimidating. The choreographer, a man named Rico who was impossibly lean and vibrated with a hummingbird\u2019s energy, was leading Rex and Chloe through a series of sharp, complex moves. Rex moved with a lazy, practiced grace, every step hitting the beat perfectly. He was born for this. Chloe, on the other hand, was a mess of flailing limbs and frantic concentration, her face a mask of pure panic. Liam felt a surge of sympathetic terror.\n\n\u201cAh, the surfer has arrived!\u201d Rico trilled, clapping his hands. \u201cLet\u2019s see if you have more rhythm than a bucket of sand. Five, six, seven, eight!\u201d He launched into a sequence of steps, pivots, and arm gestures that made Liam\u2019s brain short-circuit. He stumbled, turned the wrong way, and nearly collided with a flushed and mortified Chloe. Rex, without missing a beat, glided around him, a look of pitying amusement on his face. \"It's about selling it, man,\" Rex offered, not unkindly, as they took a water break. \"Even if you mess up the steps, you just have to look like you meant to do it. Confidence is its own choreography.\" Liam nodded, wiping sweat from his brow, but the advice didn't help. He wasn't an actor. He couldn't just \"sell it.\" He was a singer who stood still. Here, in this room of mirrors reflecting his every clumsy failure, he felt like a fraud all over again. The voice that could \u2018heal the sick and raise the dead\u2019 was useless if he couldn\u2019t even master a simple two-step.The brief moment of camaraderie with Chloe was a small, floating piece of driftwood in a vast and overwhelming ocean.

The voice that could \u2018heal the sick and raise the dead\u2019 was useless if he couldn\u2019t even master a simple two-step.\n\nThe media training session was held in a bland, windowless conference room that smelled of stale air conditioning and corporate desperation. The trainer, a woman named Diana with aggressively red lipstick and a blazer with shoulders so sharp they could cut glass, paced in front of them like a panther sizing up three very clumsy mice. She wielded a whiteboard marker like a weapon.\n\n\u201cYour story is your brand,\u201d she announced, her voice so crisp it seemed to have been ironed. \u201cAnd your brand is your product. We are not selling a voice. We are selling a feeling, an aspiration, a narrative. You are no longer people; you are concepts. Got it?\u201d Chloe looked like she was about to cry. Rex leaned back in his chair, looking bored, as if this was all remedial work for him. Liam felt a familiar sense of dread.\n\nDiana turned to Chloe first. \u201cChloe. You are \u2018The Humble Farm Girl\u2019. Every answer you give filters through that lens. They ask you about the pressure? You compare it to lambing season. They ask about the city? You talk about how you miss the stars. Never, ever say you want to win. You\u2019re just \u2018so grateful for the opportunity to share your music\u2019.\u201d She scribbled \u2018HUMBLE. GRATEFUL. FARM.\u2019 on the whiteboard.\n\nNext, she pivoted to Rex. \u201cRex. You are \u2018The Prodigal Son\u2019. You\u2019ve had a taste of the industry, you\u2019ve been knocked down, but now you\u2019re back, more polished, more determined. You\u2019re the professional. Confident, but with a hint of a hidden wound\u2014the grandmother story is gold, use it. Your brand is \u2018Redemption and Polish\u2019.\u201d She wrote \u2018POLISHED. DRIVEN. REDEMPTION.\u2019 next to his name. Rex gave a small, self-satisfied nod.\n\nFinally, her laser-like gaze fell on Liam. \u201cAnd you. The \u2018Surfer-Boy-Saviour\u2019. The raw talent plucked from obscurity. You are the diamond in the rough.\u201d She circled Liam\u2019s name on the board. \u201cYour narrative is \u2018Authenticity\u2019. You are pure, untainted by the industry. You\u2019re not here for the fame, you\u2019re here for the music. It\u2019s all about the *feeling*, Liam. When a journalist asks you a question, I want you to look slightly pained, like you\u2019re dredging the answer up from the very depths of your soul.\u201d She paused, tapping the marker against her chin. \u201cAnd for God\u2019s sake, stop saying \u2018um\u2019. It\u2019s not authentic, it\u2019s just amateur. Replace it with a thoughtful pause.\u201d She wrote \u2018AUTHENTIC. SOULFUL. RAW.\u2019 on the board.\n\nThe session descended into a painful role-play. Diana fired mock interview questions at them. Rex was flawless, weaving his narrative into every answer with practiced ease. Chloe stumbled, her genuine shyness coming across as exactly what Diana wanted. When Diana asked Liam what his biggest weakness was, he answered honestly. \u201cChoreography. I can\u2019t dance to save my life.\u201d Diana\u2019s red lips tightened. \u201cNo. Wrong. Your biggest weakness is that you sometimes care *too much*. You get so lost in the emotion of the song that you forget everything else. See the difference? One makes you sound clumsy, the other makes you sound like a tortured artist.\u201d Liam felt a piece of himself shrivel up and die. This wasn\u2019t a jailbreak; it was just a different kind of cage, one with prettier bars and a much bigger audience.\n\nThat evening, the three of them were summoned to a suite on the top floor, a vast, impersonal space with panoramic views of the glittering city lights. Brenda May, the executive producer, was waiting for them. She was flanked by Gaz, the director, and a handful of other serious-looking people in dark suits. The air crackled with a forced, high-stakes energy. This was a scene for the show. A camera crew lurked in the corner, capturing their every nervous glance.\n\n\u201cWelcome, finalists,\u201d Brenda said, her voice smooth and vaguely menacing. \u201cThe hard work starts now. Each week, one of you will be going home. Your first live show is in six days. The theme\u2026\u201d she paused for dramatic effect, her eyes sweeping over them, \u201cis \u2018Guilty Pleasures\u2019.\u201d A low groan escaped Chloe. Rex smirked; this was his territory. Liam\u2019s mind went blank. What was his guilty pleasure? Listening to his mum's ABBA Gold CD?\n\nBrenda handed each of them a sealed manila envelope. \u201cYour songs have been chosen for you. Chosen to showcase your strengths and, in some cases, to test your limits. Your journey starts with this song. Don\u2019t screw it up.\u201d Her smile didn't reach her eyes. They were dismissed. Back in the hallway, the temporary truce of media training was gone. They were competitors again, each clutching a potential lifeline or a death sentence.\n\nChloe tore hers open immediately, her face falling as she read the paper inside. \"Oh, no,\" she whispered, looking horrified. \"They've given me 'I Believe in a Thing Called Love' by The Darkness.\" The thought of the shy country girl attempting the falsetto screech and glam-rock swagger of the song was both tragic and absurd. Rex opened his with a flourish. He laughed, a short, sharp bark of triumph. \"Perfect. 'Toxic' by Britney Spears. The stripped-back, acoustic version, of course. Sexy. Dark. Very on-brand.\" He winked at Liam. \"What'd they stick you with, beach boy? Something by Jack Johnson?\"\n\nLiam\u2019s hands felt clammy as he unsealed the envelope. He pulled out the single sheet of paper. His eyes scanned the title and his blood ran cold. It wasn\u2019t a soulful ballad. It wasn\u2019t a classic rock anthem he could belt out. It was a song he knew, a song everyone knew, but one he would never have chosen in a million years. Printed in bold, black letters were the words: \u2018Call Me Maybe\u2019 by Carly Rae Jepsen. He stared at it, a wave of nausea rolling over him. It was a frothy, bubblegum pop song. It was everything he wasn't. It was a joke. He could feel Rex\u2019s eyes on him, could almost hear the un-spoken mockery. They weren\u2019t looking for a diamond in the rough. They were looking for a clown.\n\nHe escaped to his room, the piece of paper feeling like a condemnation in his hand. He slumped onto the edge of the ridiculously large bed, the sprawling city lights outside the window seeming to mock him with their cold, indifferent sparkle. He thought of Eleanor Vance\u2019s words: *A direct line from your heart to your voice. Don\u2019t ever let them train that out of you.* How was he supposed to find the heart in \u2018Call Me Maybe\u2019? It felt like a deliberate act of sabotage, a test designed to make him fail, to expose him as the one-trick pony they probably thought he was. He was the surfer boy with the soulful voice, and they\u2019d handed him a plastic bucket and spade.\n\nHis phone buzzed on the nightstand. It was a text from his mum: *Saw the first promo on TV tonight!!! You looked so handsome. We\u2019re all so proud of you, lovey. The whole town is behind you! XOXO*. A fresh wave of panic, mingled with a profound sense of homesickness, washed over him. The whole town. He wasn't just Liam Harrison, the barista with a dream, anymore. He was Liam Harrison, Mooloolaba's great hope. And they were going to watch him get on a national stage and completely humiliate himself. He picked up his guitar, the familiar weight of it a small comfort. He strummed a few chords, a mournful, minor-key progression. He tried to sing the opening line of the song. \u201cI threw a wish in the well\u2026\u201d The words felt alien in his mouth, sugary and meaningless. He stopped, pressing his forehead against the cool wood of the guitar. He had to find a way. He had to dismantle the song, break it down to its bones and find something, anything, real inside it. If he couldn't, this dream would be over before it even began.For two days, the song was his tormentor. It followed him from the sterile hotel room to the cacophonous group rehearsals, a relentlessly cheerful earworm with vapid lyrics that felt like a personal insult. He tried to practice it, standing in front of the mirror in his room, but the words tasted like ash in his mouth. \u201cHey, I just met you, and this is crazy\u2026\u201d He sounded like he was reading a grocery list. There was no connection, no heart, no truth. It was a performance, a lie, and every time he sang it, he could feel Diana\u2019s condescending voice in his head, praising his \u2018authenticity\u2019. He was supposed to be the soulful one, and they had handed him a piece of musical plastic.\n\nHe skipped the group dinner on the second night, feigning a headache. He couldn\u2019t stand another minute of Rex\u2019s preening or the production assistants\u2019 false bonhomie. He needed to be alone. He sat on the floor of his room, his back against the bed, his old guitar across his lap. The city lights outside were a cold, distant nebula. He felt utterly lost, a million miles from the salty air and warm sand of home. He thought about quitting. The thought was a brief, sweet relief. He could be on a bus tomorrow, back to Mooloolaba, back to Mel and her sour rags and the comforting hiss of the coffee machine. Back to being a failure with a marketing degree under his bed. The relief soured instantly. Jake\u2019s words echoed in his head: *Don\u2019t come back, mate. Not until you\u2019ve won.*\n\nWith a sigh of resignation, he decided to try a different approach. He wouldn\u2019t try to sing the song. He would dissect it. He wrote the lyrics out on a piece of hotel stationery, staring at them as if they were a coded message. He ignored the melody he knew, the bouncy synth-pop arrangement that was welded to the words. What was left? A story. A simple, almost painfully vulnerable one. It wasn\u2019t about a confident pickup line. It was about the terrifying, reckless moment of seeing something you want and throwing all your cards on the table. It was about the hope and the fear and the chance of utter humiliation. *Here\u2019s my number. So call me, maybe.* The \u2018maybe\u2019 was the key. It was the entire song. It was the insecurity, the whispered prayer at the end of a desperate plea.\n\nHe put his fingers to the fretboard, not aiming for a familiar chord, but just searching for a sound that matched the feeling. He found a minor chord, then another, creating a progression that was melancholic and full of longing. He slowed the tempo way down, letting the space between the notes breathe. He began to sing again, not the lyrics, but the story he had found inside them. His voice was quiet, almost a whisper. \u201cI threw a wish in the well, don\u2019t ask me I\u2019ll never tell\u2026\u201d It was no longer a flippant opening line; it was a confession. The melody he was building was sparse, haunting. It was the sound of a late-night phone call, of a heart laid bare. The \u2018crazy\u2019 in \u201cthis is crazy\u201d wasn\u2019t giddy; it was genuinely unhinged, the craziness of taking a huge, life-altering risk. He had taken a risk. He had stood on a stage in front of a million people and sung \u2018Hallelujah\u2019. He had quit his job, left his home, and thrown his whole life at this one, single chance. The song wasn't about a girl anymore. It was about him. It was the most authentic thing he could possibly sing.\n\nThe next morning, he booked an extra session with Eleanor Vance, using the excuse that he was struggling with his breath control. He walked into her sound-proofed sanctuary, his guitar case in one hand and a knot of nerves in the other. He didn\u2019t say a word, just sat on the stool, took a deep breath, and played his version of the song. He kept his eyes closed, pouring all the frustration, the homesickness, and the flicker of defiant hope into the performance. When he sang the final \u201cSo call me, maybe?\u201d the last word hung in the air, fragile and unresolved. He let the final chord ring out and then the silence in the room was absolute. He was terrified to open his eyes. He was sure she would hate it. That she would tell him he\u2019d butchered a pop classic and to stick to the script.\n\nWhen he finally dared to look at her, Eleanor\u2019s severe expression was gone. In its place was a look of intense, focused curiosity, like a geologist who had just cracked open a boring rock to find a flawless crystal inside. She was quiet for a long moment, her fingers steepled under her chin. \u201cThe producers gave you that song, didn\u2019t they?\u201d she asked, her voice soft. Liam nodded, unable to speak. \u201cThey were testing you,\u201d she said, a faint, knowing smile playing on her lips. \u201cThey wanted to see if you were a jukebox or an artist. They wanted to see if you\u2019d break.\u201d She stood up and walked over to the piano. \u201cYou held the last note a little flat. Nerves. And you need to support the breath more on the chorus, or it will sound weak, not vulnerable. But the arrangement\u2026\u201d she looked at him, her gaze direct and powerful. \u201cThe arrangement is why you are here. It\u2019s honest. Now, don\u2019t let them take it from you.\u201d\n\nBuoyed by Eleanor\u2019s approval, a new kind of resolve hardened in Liam\u2019s gut. He found Chloe later that day, huddled in a corner of the communal lounge, looking miserable. She was listening to The Darkness on her headphones, a textbook on musical theory open on her lap. \u201cI just don\u2019t get it,\u201d she lamented, pulling the earbuds out. \u201cIt\u2019s so\u2026 loud. And he\u2019s singing about things I can\u2019t even imagine. I feel like I\u2019m in a costume, and it\u2019s three sizes too big.\u201d Liam sat down beside her. \u201cForget the costume,\u201d he said, remembering his own breakthrough. \u201cWhat\u2019s the song about, really?\u201d Chloe looked confused. \u201cI dunno\u2026 a thing called love?\u201d she offered weakly. \u201cNo, underneath that,\u201d Liam pressed. \u201cIt\u2019s about being so completely overwhelmed by a feeling that it\u2019s all you can think about. It\u2019s totally over the top and a bit ridiculous, right? Have you ever felt that way about something?\u201d Her eyes lit up with sudden understanding. \u201cSinging,\u201d she whispered. \u201cWhen I get on a stage and it\u2019s going well\u2026 it feels like that. Like I could fly.\u201d Liam smiled. \u201cSo don\u2019t sing his story. Sing yours.\u201d\n\nThe battle came during the first full band rehearsal. The session musicians were pros, capable of playing anything put in front of them, but they had the sheet music for the original version of \u2018Call Me Maybe\u2019. Gaz, the director, was there, along with Rico, the choreographer, who was already planning some high-energy, synchronized moves. \"Alright, Liam, let's see what you've got!\" Gaz called out from the control booth. \"Give us some of that beach-boy charm!\" Liam took a deep breath. \u201cActually,\u201d he said, his voice steadier than he expected. \u201cI\u2019m doing a different arrangement.\u201d He walked the bemused musical director through the new chord progression. The band started to play, hesitantly at first, then with a growing sense of interest as the mournful, folk-inflected melody took shape. Liam sang, his voice filling the studio, his version of the song silencing the usual backstage chatter.\n\nWhen he finished, there was a stunned pause. Then Gaz\u2019s voice crackled through the speakers, dripping with irritation. \u201cWhat the hell was that? A funeral dirge? It\u2019s \u2018Guilty Pleasures\u2019 week, Harrison, not \u2018I\u2019m Very Sad and Deep\u2019 week. It\u2019s supposed to be fun, upbeat. People are supposed to tap their feet, not call a suicide hotline.\u201d Rico nodded in agreement. \u201cI can\u2019t choreograph to that. What\u2019s he supposed to do? Stand there and look pained?\u201d Rex, who had been watching from the side of the stage, let out a condescending laugh. \"Told you, man,\" he said, loud enough for Liam to hear. \"It's a TV show. Entertain them.\" The band looked at Liam, awaiting their instructions, their faces neutral. He could feel his resolve wavering. It would be so easy to give in, to sing the song they wanted, to do the stupid dance moves and just get through the week.\n\nBut then he remembered Eleanor\u2019s face. He remembered the feeling of finding the truth in the song. And he remembered Diana, the media trainer, and her talk of his brand. He took the microphone. \u201cDiana told me my brand was \u2018Authenticity\u2019,\u201d he said, his voice echoing slightly in the large room, directing his words at the glass of the control booth. \u201cShe said it was all about the feeling, about being raw and soulful. Well, this is it. This is my authentic version. Singing it the other way would be a lie. And it wouldn\u2019t be very good. This,\u201d he said, gesturing to the band, \u201cis the only way I can do it.\u201d Gaz was silent for a moment. There was a frantic, muffled conversation in the booth. Liam\u2019s heart hammered against his ribs. He had called their bluff. He had used their own manufactured nonsense against them. Finally, Gaz\u2019s voice came back, tight with annoyance. \u201cFine. Whatever. Do your depressing little song. But if you get voted off, it\u2019s on you. Don\u2019t come crying to us.\u201d Liam let out a breath he didn\u2019t realize he\u2019d been holding. He\u2019d won. For now.The walk back to the hotel was charged with a strange new electricity. Rex fell into step beside him, his usual smirk replaced by a look of clinical assessment. He didn't seem angry, merely\u2026 analytical. \u201cBold move, Harrison,\u201d he said, his voice a low murmur, just for Liam. \u201cFighting the machine. Very rock and roll. Hope it pays off for you. The public doesn\u2019t usually vote for a downer, no matter how \u2018authentic\u2019 it is. They want to forget their crappy week, not be reminded of yours.\u201d He clapped Liam on the shoulder again, the gesture feeling less like a threat this time and more like a warning from a seasoned veteran to a naive rookie. \u201cGood luck,\u201d he added, and it almost sounded sincere.\n\nChloe, however, was practically vibrating with vicarious courage. She caught up to him in the hotel lobby, her eyes wide. \u201cThat was amazing,\u201d she breathed, clutching her notebook like a shield. \u201cWhat you did in there. You just\u2026 told them. I\u2019ve never seen anyone talk to Gaz like that.\u201d Liam shrugged, a flush of heat creeping up his neck. \u201cI didn\u2019t really have a choice,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was either that or make a complete fool of myself.\u201d Chloe shook her head, a flicker of an idea dawning in her expression. \u201cNo, it was a choice,\u201d she insisted. \u201cYou chose to be good instead of obedient.\u201d The observation hung between them, simple and profound. It was the first time Liam had thought of it that way.\n\nThe next few days were a blur of managed chaos, a crash course in the art of being a television product. They were woken at dawn by camera crews wanting to film them being \u2018natural\u2019 over breakfast. They were shuttled from wardrobe fittings, where Liam was put in a succession of artfully distressed jeans and plain, dark t-shirts, to sound checks and lighting rehearsals. Rico, the choreographer, treated Liam with theatrical disdain. \u201cOkay, Mr. Soulful,\u201d he\u2019d sigh dramatically. \u201cYour stage is there. Your stool is there. You will walk to the stool. You will sit on the stool. Try not to look like you\u2019re waiting for a bus. That is your choreography. Thrilling.\u201d Liam accepted the ridicule. A stool was more than he could have hoped for; it was an anchor, a small island of stillness in the hurricane of the live show.\n\nTwo days before the show, he was summoned to Brenda May\u2019s office. The room was sleek, white, and cold, high in the sky, making him feel like he was being judged from on high. There were no cameras this time. Brenda sat behind a vast glass desk, her posture immaculate. \u201cYou were very bold at rehearsal, Liam,\u201d she said, her voice a flat, polished stone. \u201cIt makes for good television. A contestant fighting for his art. The sensitive soul against the heartless machine. Very dramatic.\u201d She paused, tapping a perfectly manicured finger on the glass. \u201cBut do not mistake a good story for a guaranteed spot in the final. The narrative can always be reframed. \u2018The arrogant boy who got too big for his boots and was humbled by the public vote\u2019 also tests very well. Remember that.\u201d It was a masterclass in manipulation, a compliment wrapped around a threat. She was giving him the rope to either climb or hang himself, and making it clear she was happy to film either outcome.\n\nThe night of the live show arrived with the force of a physical blow. The backstage area was a maelstrom of frantic energy, a sensory overload of shouting stagehands, the chemical smell of hairspray, and the palpable thrum of thousands of people in the audience on the other side of the wall. Liam felt sick. He sat on a crate in a dim corner, trying to do the breathing exercises Eleanor had taught him, but the air felt too thick to draw in. He was dressed in his uniform of contrived authenticity: dark jeans, a simple grey t-shirt. He watched Rex, across the room, getting a final touch-up on his makeup. Rex was electric, thriving on the chaos, his eyes gleaming with competitive fire. He was wearing a ridiculously sharp leather jacket, the embodiment of his \u2018Polished Redemption\u2019 brand. Chloe was pacing back and forth, pale under her stage makeup, twisting the hem of the sparkly dress they\u2019d put her in.\n\nShe saw Liam and came over, her hands freezing cold when she briefly gripped his arm. \u201cI\u2019m going to throw up,\u201d she whispered, her voice trembling. \u201cI can\u2019t do it. A rock song? In this dress? I look like a disco ball had a fight with a scarecrow.\u201d Liam managed a weak smile. \u201cHey. Just sing your story, remember? About how it feels. Forget the dress, forget the noise. Just find one person in the crowd and sing it to them.\u201d He wasn\u2019t sure if he was advising her or himself. She nodded, unconvinced, but the pacing stopped. A text buzzed on his phone. It was Jake. *Saw your odds online. You\u2019re the long shot to win tonight. Prove em wrong, mate. Mooloolaba is watching.* The pressure felt like a physical weight on his chest. Long shot. Of course he was.\n\n\u201cTwo minutes, Liam!\u201d a PA with a headset yelled, her voice tight with stress. This was it. The walk from the relative quiet of the backstage area to the wings of the stage felt like the longest journey of his life. The roar of the audience grew from a muffled rumble to a deafening, visceral force. Bright, hot lights blinded him as he peeked around the curtain. The stage looked enormous, a vast, glittering expanse. In the center, a single stool and a microphone stand looked terrifyingly small and exposed. He saw the judges at their long, glowing desk, their faces projected onto huge screens. He saw the sea of faces in the audience, a shifting, anonymous mass. Gaz was right. It was a party. And he was about to sing a funeral dirge. The jaunty, upbeat theme music for the show blasted through the speakers, and a wave of pure, undiluted panic washed over him. *What have I done?* he thought, his blood turning to ice. *Rex was right. They want to be entertained, not depressed. I\u2019m going to crash and burn in front of the entire country.*\n\nThe show\u2019s host, a man with teeth as white and perfect as Rex\u2019s, was bellowing his introduction. \u201c\u2026plucked from a sleepy surf town, with a voice that stunned the nation! The judges said he was the real deal, but with a controversial song choice, has he gambled too much, too soon? Please welcome\u2026 Liam Harrison!\u201d The roar of the crowd was a physical impact. A stagehand gave him a shove. \u201cGo, go, go!\u201d And he was walking, his legs feeling like they belonged to someone else. He didn\u2019t dare look at the audience, keeping his eyes fixed on the stool. He clutched his guitar, the wood of the neck slick with sweat in his palm. He reached the center of the stage, sat down, and adjusted the microphone. The lights were hot, the silence after the applause deafening. He could hear the blood pounding in his ears.\n\nHe took a breath. And then another, deeper one, remembering Eleanor. *Support the breath.* He looked up, past the blinding lights, into the vast darkness where the audience sat. He couldn't see them, but he could feel them. He wasn't thinking about the votes, or the judges, or Brenda May\u2019s threat. He thought of the caf\u00e9, of the endless, beautiful cage. He thought of the phone call that had changed his life. This was his jailbreak. This was the moment. He found his first chord, the melancholic minor sound cutting through the charged silence. He began to sing, his voice quieter than anyone expected. \u201cI threw a wish in the well\u2026\u201d\n\nAt first, the room was confused. There were scattered whispers, a sense of anticlimax. This wasn't the song they knew. But Liam kept his eyes shut, retreating into the story he had built. He sang of the vulnerability, the desperate hope, the gut-wrenching fear of rejection. The arrangement built slowly, his voice swelling from a near-whisper on the verses to a full, aching cry on the chorus. He wasn't performing. He was testifying. As he reached the final, stripped-back line, \"So call me, maybe?\", he opened his eyes, letting his gaze fall on the judges\u2019 table. He sang the last word not as a flippant invitation, but as a fragile question mark, his voice trailing off into the vast, silent arena. For a full three seconds after the last chord faded, there was nothing. No sound. Just the hum of the lights and the collective held breath of two thousand people. Liam\u2019s heart stopped. He had failed. And then, the room exploded. It wasn't just polite applause; it was a roar, a standing ovation that washed over him in a wave of sound and emotion. People were on their feet, some were even wiping their eyes. The hard-faced judge, the one with the soul of coal, was standing, his hands clasped together, nodding slowly, a look of profound shock and respect on his face. Liam looked out, dazed, and saw that the host, the PA\u2019s, even the camera operators were clapping. He had done it. He had taken the most disposable piece of pop music imaginable and turned it into a moment of art. He had made them listen.The silence stretched for an eternity, a vacuum in which Liam\u2019s entire future seemed to hang. He sat frozen on the stool, the warmth of the lights turning his skin clammy, the ghost of the final chord still vibrating through the wood of his guitar. And then the sound hit him. It wasn't a clap; it was a detonation, a tidal wave of noise that seemed to lift him from the stool. It was the sound of thousands of people getting to their feet, their applause a raw, unified roar. He looked up, blinking against the glare, and saw the impossible: the entire arena, a churning sea of cheering silhouettes, was standing for him. For his sad, broken little version of a bubblegum pop song.\n\nThe host, a man usually composed of witty segues and flawless smiles, looked genuinely stunned. He let the applause thunder for a moment longer before stepping forward, his voice filled with a new, unscripted respect. \"Wow,\" he said, the single word amplified to fill the cavernous space. \"Just... wow.\" He turned to the judges' table. \"Marcus? I don't think I've ever seen this room react like that.\" The camera zoomed in on the hard-faced judge, the man Liam had privately nicknamed \u2018The Undertaker\u2019. Marcus leaned into his microphone, his expression severe, but his eyes held a flicker of something that looked like awe. \"I'll be honest, Liam,\" he began, his gravelly voice silencing the room. \"When I saw your song choice on my sheet, I wrote you off. I thought it was arrogant, or stupid, or both. I was sharpening my knives.\" He paused, letting the tension build. \"I have never been so happy to be so wrong. What you did tonight wasn't a cover. It was an autopsy. You ripped the chest open on a manufactured, plastic song and found a real, beating, broken heart. That wasn't a performance; it was a confession. That was artistry.\"\n\nThe other judges were a chorus of ecstatic praise. They lauded his bravery, his musical intelligence, his vulnerability. Words like \u2018game-changer\u2019 and \u2018defining moment\u2019 were thrown around like confetti. Liam could barely process them. He mumbled his thanks, his brain a static-filled haze, and stumbled off the stage into the wings, his guitar feeling impossibly heavy. The moment he was out of sight, the world shifted. The production assistant who had yelled at him to \u2018go\u2019 now handed him a bottle of water with a reverence usually reserved for visiting royalty. Crew members he\u2019d never spoken to gave him solemn nods and pats on the back. He had walked onto that stage as a contestant. He walked off as a contender.\n\nHe found Chloe in the buzzing chaos of the green room. She was next. Her face was pale, a mixture of terror and sheer, unadulterated awe. \u201cLiam,\u201d she whispered, grabbing his arm. \u201cHow\u2026 how am I supposed to follow that?\u201d Her sparkly dress seemed to mock her fear. He looked at her, seeing his own panic from thirty minutes ago reflected in her wide eyes. \"You don't follow it,\" he said, his voice hoarse. \"You do what we talked about. You sing your story. Not his, not mine. Yours.\" He squeezed her hand. \"You told me it feels like you could fly. So fly.\" A PA called her name. She gave Liam one last, terrified look, took a deep breath that seemed to pull in all the courage in the room, and walked towards the stage.\n\nLiam watched on a monitor, his own heart pounding a frantic rhythm for her. She walked out, looking small and fragile under the huge lights. When the opening chords of the raucous rock song began, she flinched. She sang the first verse, her voice tight and reedy, her eyes squeezed shut. Liam\u2019s stomach clenched. She was going to crash. Then, as the first chorus hit, something shifted. She opened her eyes, not looking at the judges or the cameras, but up towards the cheap seats in the back. A different energy took over. She wasn\u2019t trying to be a swaggering rock star anymore. She was the girl from the hills, singing her heart out. The song became a joyful, defiant roar, a country-rock explosion of pure, unbridled passion. She transformed the swagger into exuberance, the screech into a joyful yodel of release. By the end, she was beaming, the sparkly dress no longer a costume but a beacon, and the crowd, caught up in her infectious joy, gave her an ovation almost as loud as Liam\u2019s.\n\nRex was the last of their trio to perform. He had watched both Liam\u2019s and Chloe\u2019s triumphs on the monitor, his confident smirk slowly tightening into a rigid line. The two raw, authentic acts had completely reset the emotional temperature of the room. He was the consummate professional, but for the first time, that felt like a liability. He strode onto the stage, a vision of urban cool in his leather jacket, and launched into his version of \u2018Toxic\u2019. It was, by any technical measure, perfect. His voice was flawless, his intricate guitar work was impressive, and his stage presence was magnetic. He oozed star quality. The performance was sleek, seductive, and intensely rehearsed. But it felt like watching a beautiful, expensive car drive by behind a pane of glass. You could admire the craftsmanship, but you couldn't feel the engine.\n\nThe judges\u2019 comments reflected the subtle shift. They praised him, but the language was different. They used words like \u2018polished\u2019, \u2018professional\u2019, and \u2018marketable\u2019. Marcus, The Undertaker, nodded thoughtfully. \"Rex, you're a star. There's no question. You look like one, you sound like one, you perform like one. It was a ten out of ten performance.\" He paused. \"But tonight, I'm not sure a ten was enough.\" The comment, though couched in praise, landed like a stone. Rex\u2019s smile didn\u2019t falter, but a flicker of something cold and furious entered his eyes. He had done everything right, and somehow, he had been outmanoeuvred by a sad-sack surfer and a star-struck farm girl.\n\nAn hour later, all twelve finalists were lined up on stage. The air was thick with the cheap perfume of manufactured tension. Liam stood between Chloe and Rex, a bizarre island of shared experience. Chloe was trembling slightly, but a new steeliness was in her gaze. Rex stood perfectly still, his face a mask of cool indifference, but Liam could see the muscle jumping in his jaw. The host began the ritual, announcing the names of those who were safe, one by one. The relief on each face was stark and immediate. Liam\u2019s name was the third one called. A wave of dizziness washed over him as he let out the breath he\u2019d been holding. The host said his name again, reminding him to step forward. He did, catching Chloe\u2019s eye. She gave him a tiny, proud smile. Her name was called two announcements later. She visibly sagged with relief, and her hand found his for a brief, grateful squeeze.\n\nThe line of contestants thinned. Soon, there were only four left, standing in a small, miserable huddle under the glare of the lights. And Rex was one of them. The front-runner, the professional, the one who was meant to be untouchable, was in the bottom four. The host milked the moment, his voice a dramatic purr as he announced the next person safe. It wasn\u2019t Rex. Liam watched his competitor\u2019s face. The mask was cracking. The cool confidence had evaporated, replaced by a raw, naked humiliation. This wasn't part of his brand. This wasn't in his narrative. This was real. Finally, with only two contestants left, the host called the name of the person going home. It wasn\u2019t Rex. The girl beside him burst into tears as her dream ended on national television. Rex was safe. But as he walked, stiff-backed, to join the others, he looked utterly defeated. The crowd had voted, and their message was clear. Polish was good. Professionalism was admirable. But tonight, they had voted for heart. And Rex Vance, for all his talent, had been found wanting.The comedown was slower and stranger than the ascent. Back in the green room, a chaotic space now stratified by the invisible lines of success and failure, Liam was no longer just a contestant. He was an event. People who had looked through him hours earlier now sought his eye, offering tight, professional smiles and murmurs of \"killer performance.\" Sarah, the PA, who had previously herded him like livestock, now asked if he needed anything with a deferential tilt of her head. He was handed a tablet showing the overnight social media metrics. His name was trending nationally. The clip of his performance was rocketing towards a million views. It was all abstract, a series of numbers and graphs that had no connection to the shaking in his hands or the hollow, echoing space in his chest where the panic used to be.\n\nHe saw Rex across the room, surrounded by his own small team of stylists and hangers-on who now looked deeply uncomfortable, unsure of the correct etiquette for consoling a star whose shine had just been demonstrably tarnished. Rex wasn't speaking to any of them. He was staring at a monitor showing a replay of his own performance, his face a mask of cold, intellectual fury. He was dissecting his failure, frame by frame, searching for the flaw in the code. As Liam watched, Rex\u2019s eyes lifted and met his across the crowded room. There was no congratulations in that gaze. There was no anger, either. It was something far more chilling: recognition. It was the look a predator gives a rival who has just stolen its kill, an acknowledgment of a new and dangerous variable in the ecosystem. Rex gave a slow, deliberate nod, then turned and walked out, his entourage scrambling to follow in his wake.\n\nChloe found him a moment later, her face scrubbed of makeup, her sparkly dress exchanged for one of the generic X-Factor tracksuits. The giddy relief had been replaced by a quiet, shared sense of shock. They escaped the noise, finding refuge in a deserted corridor that smelled of disinfectant and old dust. \"Did that really happen?\" she whispered, leaning against the wall, the question aimed at the universe. Liam could only shake his head, the roar of the crowd still a phantom ringing in his ears. \"I think so,\" he said. \"Your song\u2026 you were incredible.\" She blushed, a real, un-televised blush. \"I just did what you said,\" she admitted. \"I sang my story. I thought about shearing sheep, oddly enough. The feeling of finishing the last one before a storm rolls in. That feeling of racing the clock and winning.\" He laughed, a real laugh, the first one that day that didn't feel choked by anxiety. In that sterile hallway, far from the cameras and the judges, they were just two singers from opposite ends of the country who had survived their first storm.\n\nSleep was impossible. Liam lay in his king-sized bed, the city lights painting silent, shifting patterns on the ceiling, his mind replaying every note, every word, every roar of the crowd. He was no longer the anonymous barista. He was now \u2018Liam Harrison: The Artist.\u2019 It felt like a costume he had been forced to wear, one that might be more difficult to remove than the \u2018Surfer-Boy-Saviour\u2019 tag had been. At six a.m., his phone rang. It was his mum, her voice thick with tears. \u201cOh, lovey,\u201d she sobbed. \u201cWe watched it at the surf club. The whole place. When you finished, you could have heard a pin drop, and then Mel, of all people, stood up on a table and started cheering. The whole town is going absolutely bonkers. You did it, Liam. You really did it.\u201d He closed his eyes, the simple, unvarnished pride in her voice a balm on his frayed nerves. He was doing this for them, too. The thought was both a comfort and a terrifying weight.\n\nThe shift in the machine\u2019s attitude was immediate. The next morning, Liam was summoned not by Gaz or Sarah, but by Brenda May herself. Her office was just as he remembered, a minimalist temple of power overlooking the city. This time, however, her smile seemed almost genuine. \u201cCongratulations, Liam,\u201d she said, gesturing for him to sit. \u201cYou created a moment. And moments are our currency.\u201d She leaned forward, the cynicism back in her eyes. \u201cThe network loves you. The public loves you. \u2018The tortured artist who finds beauty in the trash.\u2019 It\u2019s a fantastic narrative. Your authenticity is rating through the roof.\u201d The way she said \u2018authenticity\u2019 made it sound like a brand of yogurt. \u201cSo, this week, we\u2019re going to lean into it.\u201d\n\nShe slid a single sheet of paper across the vast glass desk. \u201cThis week\u2019s theme is \u2018Movie Night\u2019.\u201d Liam\u2019s stomach tightened. He scanned the paper. It was a list of huge, iconic movie ballads. Bombastic, orchestral, emotionally manipulative songs that were the polar opposite of his sparse, intimate style. \u201cWe\u2019ve assigned you \u2018I Don\u2019t Want to Miss a Thing\u2019,\u201d Brenda said, naming the Aerosmith power ballad from the movie *Armageddon*. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the biggest-selling rock ballads of all time. The public adores it. We want you to do your thing to it. Strip it down. Make it your own. Make them cry again. Don\u2019t disappoint us.\u201d She smiled, a clear, sharp message in her eyes. It was not a request. He was no longer the rebel fighting the system; he was the system's new, prized racehorse, and they were pointing him at the next jump. The freedom he had fought for was already becoming a gilded cage.\n\nHe left her office feeling more confused than triumphant. He had won the right to be himself, only to be ordered to mass-produce that self on command. As he stepped out of the lift into the finalists\u2019 lobby, Rex was there, leaning against a pillar, as if waiting for him. The cold fury from the night before was gone, replaced by a conspiratorial, almost friendly smirk. \u201cJust had your victory meeting with the puppet master?\u201d he asked, his voice smooth. \u201cLet me guess. She told you how brilliant you are and that your authenticity is your superpower, and now she wants you to do it again, on cue, with some overblown piece of corporate rock.\u201d Liam stared at him, surprised by the accuracy. Rex chuckled. \u201cI\u2019ve been in this business a long time, Harrison. I know how it works. They build you up, create a narrative, and then they bleed it dry. Last night, you weren\u2019t an artist; you were a plot twist. A very effective one, I\u2019ll admit. But what happens next week when you can\u2019t pull another rabbit out of the hat?\u201d\n\nRex pushed himself off the pillar and stepped closer, lowering his voice. \u201cYou think they want you to be authentic? They want you to be predictably authentic. They want to bottle your little sad-boy lightning and sell it. You fought them and won, and now they\u2019ve put you in charge of your own cage. Last night was a fluke. A perfect storm of a bad song choice and a good idea. You can\u2019t do that every week. Sooner or later, you\u2019ll have to sing the song, do the dance. Sooner or later, you\u2019ll have to become a professional. And I\u2019ll be there when you do.\u201d He patted Liam\u2019s shoulder, the gesture now laden with a complex mix of pity and condescension, and walked away, leaving Liam reeling. The words were a poison, expertly crafted to find the cracks in his newfound confidence. *It was a fluke.* The thought burrowed deep into his mind, a seed of doubt that began to sprout immediately.\n\nDesperate for an antidote, he found his way back to Eleanor Vance\u2019s studio. The small, quiet room felt more like a sanctuary than ever. He explained the situation: the new song, Brenda\u2019s directive, Rex\u2019s insidious warning. He played her the opening chords of the Aerosmith song, his fingers fumbling, the melody feeling bloated and cartoonish. \u201cI can\u2019t find it,\u201d he said, his voice laced with frustration. \u201cThere\u2019s no \u2018maybe\u2019 in this song. There\u2019s no vulnerability. It\u2019s just yelling. I can\u2019t find the truth in it.\u201d Eleanor listened patiently, her severe expression unwavering. When he was finished, she didn\u2019t offer comforting words. She was a teacher, not a therapist. \u201cOf course you can\u2019t find it,\u201d she said bluntly. \u201cYou are looking for the same truth you found last time. You are trying to repeat a discovery. That is not art; that is manufacturing. That is what the producer wants. It is what your rival expects.\u201d\n\nShe stood and walked to her old, upright piano. \u201cLast week, the truth was in the insecurity. The plea. This song,\u201d she played a few of the powerful, anthemic chords, letting them hang in the air, \u201cis not a plea. It is a declaration. It is the opposite emotion. Its truth lies in its absolute, unwavering certainty.\u201d She looked at Liam, her eyes sharp. \u201cDo not try to make it small and sad. That would be a lie. It would be a gimmick. Your challenge this week is not to find the broken heart. It is to find a reason to sing with a whole one. To find something, or someone, you feel so strongly about that you could genuinely stand on a mountaintop and scream it to the world without a hint of irony.\u201d She stopped playing. \u201cYour authenticity is not a style, Mr. Harrison. It is not a minor key. It is the act of telling the truth with your voice. The truth simply changes from week to week. Find it.\u201d He looked down at his hands, at his guitar, and then back at her. Rex had tried to poison him with doubt. Eleanor had just handed him the antidote: a new, far more difficult, and infinitely more honest path forward. He had to find something worth screaming for.Eleanor\u2019s words were a compass, but Liam was still lost in the woods. For two days, he wrestled with the song, and the song, a behemoth of 90s power-rock sincerity, wrestled him back and pinned him every time. He tried to follow her advice, to search for a truth of unwavering certainty, but his life felt like a landscape of doubt. Certainty was a luxury he\u2019d never been able to afford. He sat in his room, the branded X-Factor guitar feeling like a prop in his hands, and tried to sing the chorus. His voice came out thin and ironic, a hollow imitation of Steven Tyler\u2019s iconic rasp. It was a joke. He sounded like a kid playing dress-up in his dad\u2019s rock-and-roll clothes. Rex\u2019s words slithered into his thoughts, a venomous whisper: *It was a fluke. They want you to be predictably authentic.* He was trying to do just that, to find the feeling on command, and the well was dry. The more he tried to force it, the more fraudulent he felt.\n\nDefeated, he put the guitar down and walked to the floor-to-ceiling window. The city sprawled below, a relentless grid of ambition and indifference. He felt a pang of homesickness so sharp it was almost a physical pain. On impulse, he picked up his phone and called his mum. She answered on the second ring, the familiar sound of the surf club\u2019s clatter in the background. She didn't talk about the show or the competition. She told him about her day. She told him that Mel had actually smiled at a customer, an event she ranked somewhere between a solar eclipse and the second coming. She told him that Jake had fixed the wobbly leg on her favourite table. She told him about the sunset she had watched after her shift, the way the sky had turned a violent, beautiful shade of orange and purple, bleeding into the deep blue of the Coral Sea. \u201cIt was one of those ones, lovey,\u201d she said, her voice soft with the memory. \u201cOne of those ones that makes you stop what you\u2019re doing and just\u2026 look. Makes you glad you\u2019ve got eyes in your head.\u201d\n\nAfter he hung up, Liam stood in the silent, air-conditioned room, his mother\u2019s words painting a vivid picture in his mind. He closed his eyes, and he wasn't in a Sydney hotel room anymore. He was standing on the headland at Mooloolaba, the salt spray cool on his face, the familiar cry of the gulls sharp in the humid air. He saw the sunset his mum had described, the vast, perfect curve of the bay, the endless shimmer of the water stretching to a horizon that held no judgment, only possibility. He felt a surge of emotion so powerful it almost buckled his knees. It wasn't love for a person. It was a fierce, primal love for a place. For home. For the feeling of the sand under his feet and the salt on his tongue. For the quiet, unassuming life he had been so desperate to escape, a life that now seemed like the only real thing in a world of chrome and mirrors. He didn\u2019t want to miss a thing. Not a single grain of sand, not a single shade of blue in the evening tide. He never wanted to forget that feeling.\n\nHe picked up the guitar again, his fingers finding the opening chords of the song. This time, he didn't try to make them quiet or sad. He played the big, anthemic power chords as they were written, but he filled them with that feeling, that ache of fierce, protective love for his corner of the world. He started to sing, his voice no longer thin or ironic. He was not singing to a lover, begging them not to fall asleep. He was singing to his own memory, commanding it to stay. *I could stay awake just to hear you breathing* became a line about listening to the rhythm of the waves on the shore. *I don\u2019t want to close my eyes, I don\u2019t want to fall asleep, \u2018cause I\u2019d miss you, babe, and I don\u2019t want to miss a thing.* It was a hymn to home. A desperate, powerful declaration that no matter how far this new life took him, he would not let it erase the boy who sang to the gulls on Mooloolaba beach. He wasn\u2019t stripping the song down; he was building it up, giving its bombast a foundation of real, raw, heartfelt truth. Eleanor was right. He had found something worth screaming for.\n\nThe band rehearsal was a tense affair. Gaz, the director, watched from the booth with a look of impatient expectation. \u201cAlright, Harrison, show us the magic,\u201d his voice crackled over the intercom, dripping with sarcasm. \u201cLet\u2019s see the sad, stripped-down version of the stadium rock anthem. Should be a real crowd-pleaser.\u201d Liam ignored him. He turned to the musical director, a seasoned pro named Dave, and spoke quietly for a moment. \u201cWe\u2019re doing it as written,\u201d he said. \u201cFull band. Just follow me on the dynamics.\u201d Dave raised a skeptical eyebrow but nodded to the band. They launched into the iconic opening, the sound big and full in the studio. Liam took a deep breath, closed his eyes for a second to picture that sunset, and sang.\n\nWhat came out was not the angsty rasp of Steven Tyler, nor the whisper of his \u2018Call Me Maybe\u2019 performance. It was a new voice, his own voice, filled with a power and clarity that surprised everyone, including himself. He wasn\u2019t performing rock and roll; he was leading a secular prayer. He embraced the song\u2019s theatricality, the soaring chorus, the dramatic pauses. He wasn\u2019t hiding behind his guitar; he was using it as a conduit for a feeling so big it couldn't be contained in a minor key. When the final, massive chorus hit, he stepped away from the microphone, his eyes open and blazing, and let his voice fill the room without amplification, a raw, desperate cry of pure emotion that was more powerful than any special effect. He held the final note until his lungs burned, the band crashing to a halt around him.\n\nThe silence that followed was different from the week before. It wasn't stunned awe; it was profound confusion. The band members looked at each other, then at Liam, their professional detachment broken by expressions of sheer shock. In the control booth, Gaz was speechless, staring at the mixing desk as if it had betrayed him. This wasn\u2019t the product he had ordered. This wasn\u2019t \u2018Liam\u2019s brand\u2019. This was something else, something wilder and less predictable. And from the side of the stage, where he\u2019d been watching with a cynical smirk, Rex Vance\u2019s expression slowly changed. The smirk faded, the condescension evaporated. It was replaced by a look of cold, hard calculation. He had predicted Liam would fail to repeat his trick. He had been right. He just never imagined that Liam would have another, entirely different, and arguably more powerful one, up his sleeve. The coastal kid wasn't a fluke. He was a moving target.The silence that followed the final crash of the band was heavy and profound, a thick blanket laid over the studio. Liam stood panting slightly in the center of the stage, the adrenaline a high-frequency hum beneath his skin. He had given everything to the song, a full-throated, desperate declaration, and now in the echoing quiet, he felt utterly exposed. The band members exchanged wide-eyed, unreadable glances, their professional composure momentarily fractured. In the control booth, Gaz was leaning forward, his mouth slightly agape, staring not at Liam but at the glowing soundboard as if it had just recited epic poetry. The expected rebuke, the sarcastic dismissal of his choice, never came. Instead, the studio audience, which had been whipped into a frenzy by the song\u2019s power, slowly, almost thoughtfully, got to their feet, their applause rolling towards the stage not with the explosive shock of the week before, but with the deep, rumbling power of a gathering storm.\n\nAt the judges\u2019 table, the mood was equally transformed. The usually effervescent female judge was dabbing at the corner of her eye with a tissue, her critique a single, breathy, \u201cLiam, that was church.\u201d But all eyes were on Marcus. The Undertaker leaned back in his chair, his steepled fingers tapping against his lips as he regarded Liam with a new, unsettling intensity. \u201cI am rarely surprised, Liam,\u201d he said, his voice a low growl that commanded absolute silence. \u201cBut twice in two weeks is\u2026 unprecedented.\u201d He leaned forward, the camera zooming in on his craggy, serious face. \u201cLast week, you performed a magic trick. You took a piece of plastic and turned it into glass. It was clever. It was artful. This,\u201d he gestured to the stage, \u201cwas not a trick. This was an act of raw, terrifying power. You didn\u2019t deconstruct that song; you possessed it. You took a monument and made it a living, breathing thing. You\u2019re not just a singer, son. You\u2019re becoming a force of nature. And frankly, I\u2019m not sure whether to be thrilled or terrified.\u201d\n\nBackstage was a blur of disorienting respect. The shift was complete. Liam was no longer the underdog, the lucky amateur who had pulled off a clever stunt. He was the front-runner, the one to beat, and the air around him had changed, charged with a mixture of awe and fear. People didn\u2019t just look at him anymore; they watched him, as if expecting him to spontaneously combust or levitate. He found Chloe by the catering table, where she was nervously stirring a cup of tea. She had delivered a beautiful, heartfelt rendition of a Joni Mitchell song, earning warm praise and a safe passage to the next week, but she looked at Liam as if he had returned from another planet. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t a song, Liam,\u201d she said quietly, her eyes searching his. \u201cThat was\u2026 something else. It felt like you were going to tear the roof off the building with your voice. It\u2019s like you\u2019re getting further and further away from the rest of us.\u201d Her words, meant as a compliment, landed like a small, sharp stone, reminding him of the growing distance between the person he was and the phenomenon he was becoming.\n\nThe most unnerving encounter came just before the live results show. Liam was in a quiet corner, trying to steady his breathing, when Rex appeared beside him, moving with a silent, predatory grace. The calculating fury of the week before had been replaced by a serene, almost philosophical detachment. He held two bottles of water, offering one to Liam. \u201cAn impressive display of firepower, Harrison,\u201d Rex said, his voice a low, confidential murmur. \u201cYou\u2019ve successfully convinced them all that you\u2019re a prophet. The tortured voice of a generation, screaming his truth from the mountaintop.\u201d He took a slow sip from his bottle. \u201cBut you should read your history. Prophets have a tendency to end up crucified. The public loves a martyr, but only after they\u2019re gone.\u201d Liam just stared at him, unsure how to respond to the bizarre, backhanded compliment.\n\n\u201cYou see, you think you won,\u201d Rex continued, his tone patient, as if explaining a complex theorem to a child. \u201cBut Brenda and the network won more. Last week you were a novelty. This week you\u2019re an addiction. And they are the dealers. They\u2019ll keep demanding more truth, more soul, a bigger piece of you every week, until there\u2019s nothing left to give. You\u2019re not an artist to them, you\u2019re a natural resource to be strip-mined.\u201d He leaned in closer, his voice dropping to a near-whisper. \u201cI, on the other hand, am a performer. It\u2019s a job. I give them a polished product, a reliable return on their investment. I keep my soul in a safe deposit box where they can\u2019t get to it. You\u2019re laying yours out on the table every week for them to feast on. Let\u2019s see who has more to give by the end.\u201d Rex straightened up, his friendly mask back in place. \u201cJust some professional advice. Good luck tonight.\u201d With a final, chillingly pleasant smile, he walked away, leaving Liam with a mouthful of ashes and the cold, dawning horror that every word Rex had said was probably true.\n\nThe results show felt like a foregone conclusion. Liam and Chloe were waved through early, their names met with thunderous applause. The real drama swirled around the contestants in the middle of the pack, the ones who were good but not great, professional but not phenomenal. Rex, who had delivered a technically brilliant but emotionally sterile version of a classic rock song, was also declared safe, though the applause for him was noticeably more polite. He accepted it with a gracious nod, his eyes briefly meeting Liam\u2019s with a look that said, *See? The professional survives.* The contestant who went home was a sweet, forgettable boy-band type who had simply failed to make an impression. As he sang his tearful farewell song, Liam felt a surge of empathy. The boy wasn\u2019t a bad singer; he just hadn\u2019t been able to give the machine the story it craved. He had been a product with no brand.\n\nThe remaining contestants were gathered on stage, exhausted and emotionally drained, when the giant screen behind them flickered to life. Brenda May\u2019s face appeared, magnified to the size of a small car, her smile sharp and predatory. \u201cCongratulations, finalists,\u201d she said, her voice echoing through the studio. \u201cYou have survived another week. But the challenges will only get harder. The public expects more from you now. And so do we.\u201d Her eyes seemed to settle on Liam. \u201cTherefore, this week\u2019s theme will be \u2018Judges\u2019 Choice\u2019. Each judge will select a song for one of you. A song they feel will be the ultimate test of your artistry, your versatility, and your courage. There will be nowhere to hide.\u201d\n\nA nervous murmur went through the contestants. This was the ultimate act of producer manipulation, disguised as an honour. The judges began their announcements. The first judge gave Chloe a classic, heart-wrenching Patsy Cline ballad, a perfect fit for her voice that would allow her to shine. The second judge assigned Rex a complex, theatrical Queen number, a challenge that played directly to his strengths in showmanship and vocal precision. Rex accepted with a confident, almost arrogant, nod. This was his arena. Finally, all eyes turned to Marcus. He stood, his imposing figure silencing the room. He looked directly at Liam, his expression unreadable.\n\n\u201cLiam,\u201d Marcus began, his voice a low rumble. \u201cIn three weeks, you have proven to be a master of reinterpretation. You deconstructed disposable pop. You reconstructed epic rock. You find new truth in unexpected places. But the greatest test for an artist is not what they can bring to a flawed song, but whether they can stand in the presence of perfection.\u201d He paused, letting the weight of his words settle. \u201cCan you bring your truth to a song that is already one of the most truthful ever written? A song so simple, so pure, and so iconic that it offers no room for tricks, no place to hide, and no forgiveness for failure?\u201d The screen behind him displayed the song title, the two words landing with the force of a physical blow. *Yesterday. The Beatles.* Liam stared at the screen, a cold wave of dread washing over him. It was a song he had known his entire life. It was beautiful. It was perfect. And it was an impossible trap. He couldn\u2019t tear it down. He couldn\u2019t build it up. It was a poisoned chalice, handed to him by the one judge who seemed to understand him best, a challenge designed to see if he was truly a force of nature, or just a man who had finally run out of miracles.The two words hung in the air of the studio, impossibly heavy, impossibly simple. *Yesterday*. The Beatles. It was not a song; it was a cornerstone of Western culture, a piece of music so deeply embedded in the collective consciousness that it felt less like a composition and more like a naturally occurring element, like water or air. The audience, sensing the monumental nature of the challenge, erupted in a cacophony of cheers and gasps. On stage, Liam felt the blood drain from his face. Marcus hadn't thrown him a lifeline. He had handed him an anchor and told him to fly. The other contestants looked at him with a mixture of pity and awe, as if he had just been nominated for a suicide mission. Even Chloe\u2019s supportive smile couldn't hide the fear in her eyes. It was a perfect song, and his entire brand was built on fixing imperfections. He was a house renovator who had just been handed the Mona Lisa and told to \u2018make it his own\u2019.\n\nFor the next three days, Liam was a ghost haunting the 22nd floor. The song became his tormentor, a gentle melody that held the menace of a loaded gun. He sat with his guitar, the familiar chords feeling alien under his fingers. He played the simple, descending progression, a masterpiece of elegant sorrow, and it mocked him. There was nothing to add, nothing to take away. He tried to sing it, but his voice felt like a clumsy forgery. He was Paul McCartney\u2019s karaoke singer. The lyrics, so clear and direct, offered no secret doors, no hidden meanings to exploit. It was a story of a love suddenly and inexplicably gone, a lament for a time when life was easy. What truth could he possibly bring to it that wasn\u2019t already there? The song didn\u2019t need him. He was a parasite on a perfect host.\n\nHis frustration curdled into a quiet, simmering panic. He saw Rex in the hallways, looking infuriatingly relaxed. Rex was working on his Queen song, a flamboyant explosion of theatricality that was perfectly suited to his style. He\u2019d whistle the intricate melody as he passed Liam in the hall, a casual, cutting display of his own comfort zone. \u201cStruggling to improve on perfection, Harrison?\u201d Rex asked one afternoon, his tone laced with faux sympathy as he saw the dark circles under Liam\u2019s eyes. \u201cThat\u2019s the thing about a masterpiece. It doesn\u2019t need your help. Sometimes you just have to admit you\u2019re out of your league.\u201d Every word was a perfect little dart, aimed at the heart of Liam\u2019s insecurity. He was right. Liam was out of his league, and the whole country was about to watch him drown.\n\nHe finally sought refuge in Eleanor\u2019s studio. The soundproofed walls felt like a fortress against the mounting pressure. He didn\u2019t even say hello, just walked in, sat on the stool, and played the song, his performance stiff and lifeless. He finished and looked at her, his face a mask of desperation. \u201cI can\u2019t do it,\u201d he said, his voice cracking. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing here for me. It\u2019s a perfect song. There are no flaws to find, no heart to uncover. It\u2019s already there. Anything I do to it will just make it worse. It\u2019s a trap.\u201d Eleanor listened, her expression as still and unmoving as a granite statue. She let the silence hang for a long moment after he finished his defeated tirade, letting his words evaporate into the quiet of the room.\n\n\u201cYou are a fool, Mr. Harrison,\u201d she said at last, her voice devoid of any warmth. The bluntness of it startled him. \u201cYou come in here looking for a trick. A new arrangement. A clever hook. You are still thinking like a mechanic. Marcus did not give you a puzzle to solve. He gave you a mirror.\u201d She stood up and walked towards him, her presence more imposing than ever. \u201cStop trying to change the song. The song is immutable. It is you who must change. You think the song is about a lost lover? Perhaps. But for you, what is your yesterday? What is the easy game that you can no longer play? What have you lost that you now need a place to hide away from?\u201d She was so close he could see the fine lines around her sharp, intelligent eyes. \u201cDo not perform this song. Do not interpret it. You must stand on that stage and let it pass through you. It is the purest test of the 'direct line' we once spoke of. If you have any art in you at all, you will not need to find the truth. The truth will find you.\u201d\n\nHer words struck him like a physical blow. He left the studio in a daze, her questions echoing in his head. *What is your yesterday?* He went back to his room, but instead of picking up the guitar, he just stood by the window, looking down at the endless, glittering expanse of Sydney. He thought of the person he was just a few weeks ago. The boy who felt trapped by the monotonous rhythm of the tides, by the steam wand hissing, by the sticky film of salt that coated everything. He had yearned for this new life, for the noise and the lights and the feeling of being someone, of being seen. He had it now. He was seen constantly. His every move was documented, his every emotion mined for a narrative. He was no longer a person; he was a concept, a brand, a story being told by other people. His love had been a simple, easy game. He had sung for the sheer joy of it, for the gulls, for the empty beach at dawn. Now, he sang for ratings, for judges, for a contract.\n\nHe had lost his anonymity. He had lost his simplicity. He had lost the freedom of being no one. And in that moment, staring out at the city that had become his beautiful cage, he was overwhelmed by a profound, aching nostalgia for the life he had so carelessly thrown away. *Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away. Now it looks as though they\u2019re here to stay. Oh, I believe in yesterday.* The lyrics were no longer about a girl. they were about him. The \u2018she\u2019 in *Why she had to go, I don\u2019t know, she wouldn\u2019t say* was his old self, a person who had vanished without warning, leaving this new, anxious, public version of Liam in his place. He suddenly, desperately, missed the boy who poured flat whites and had a useless degree under his bed. He had said something wrong. He had wished his simple life away, and now he was living with the consequences.\n\nAt the final rehearsal, Liam\u2019s request was simple. \u201cNo band,\u201d he told the musical director. \u201cJust a single cello. And I\u2019ll play acoustic.\u201d Gaz\u2019s voice crackled from the control booth, dripping with incredulity. \u201cAre you kidding me? A cello? It\u2019s Saturday night television, Harrison, not a recital at the bloody conservatorium. The song is already a downer. You\u2019re going to put the whole country to sleep.\u201d Liam didn\u2019t argue. He just looked at the musical director, Dave, who had seen his performance the week before. Dave looked back at him, then up at the control booth. \u201cLet\u2019s just try it, Gaz,\u201d he said, a note of quiet authority in his voice. Gaz grumbled, but acquiesced.\n\nLiam sat on the stool, his guitar on his lap. The cellist, a woman with kind, weary eyes, gave him a small, encouraging nod. He closed his eyes, not picturing a sunset this time, but the faded posters on the wall of the Mooloolaba caf\u00e9. He pictured the glint of the sun on the Coral Sea, the sour smell of the rag he used to wipe the counter. He took a breath and began to play, his fingers tracing the familiar chords with a newfound reverence. The cello entered, its voice a deep, mournful sigh that wrapped around the melody of the guitar. And then he sang. He sang without affectation, without any vocal tricks. He simply told the story. His story. His voice was quiet, intimate, laced with a profound and genuine sadness. It wasn\u2019t a performance of melancholy; it was the real thing. He was the man who had woken up to find his world irrevocably changed, who longed for the simple life he had not appreciated until it was gone forever. When he sang the final line, *Oh, I believe in yesterday,* his voice was barely a whisper, a fragile confession breathed into the vast, silent studio. When he finished, no one moved. The cellist had tears silently tracking down her face. In the control booth, Gaz was just staring, his hand hovering over the talk-back button, for once with nothing to say. Liam opened his eyes, feeling hollowed out, empty. He had found the only way to sing the song. He had to bleed.The night of the live show felt different. The usual backstage franticness was there \u2013 the shouting, the hiss of hairspray, the frantic energy of a thousand moving parts \u2013 but Liam felt strangely insulated from it, cocooned in a bubble of quiet resignation. He wasn\u2019t nervous, not in the heart-pounding, stomach-churning way he had been before. This was a different feeling, a deep, somber calm, the feeling a person has when they have already accepted the worst possible outcome. He sat on a flight case in a shadowed corner, his guitar resting across his lap, his fingers idly tracing the frets without making a sound. He wasn't preparing to compete; he was preparing for a confession.\n\nChloe was a picture of poised professionalism, her nerves from the early weeks baked away by experience and newfound confidence. Her Patsy Cline song was a perfect vessel for her clear, emotive voice, and she delivered it with a simple, heartbreaking honesty that earned her a warm, sustained ovation. She had found her place, a comfortable and authentic niche that the audience adored. As she came off stage, flushed with success, she gave Liam\u2019s shoulder a supportive squeeze. \u201cYou\u2019ve got this,\u201d she whispered, though her eyes betrayed a hint of worry, as if she knew he was about to venture somewhere she couldn\u2019t follow.\n\nThen came Rex. The opening fanfare of Queen\u2019s \u2018Somebody to Love\u2019 blared through the studio, and he exploded onto the stage in a blaze of theatrical glory. It was a masterclass in performance. He moved with a dancer\u2019s precision, his voice soaring through the complex vocal arrangements, hitting the gospel-choir highs and the rock-and-roll lows with effortless power. He interacted with the backup singers, played to the cameras, and commanded the stage with the absolute authority of a born star. It was flawless, exhilarating, and utterly spectacular. He wasn't just singing a song; he was producing a miniature broadway show in three minutes. The performance ended with him on his knees in a single, dramatic spotlight, and the audience erupted in a frenzy. It was pure, unadulterated entertainment, and Rex had given them everything they could possibly want.\n\nAs the stage crew cleared Rex\u2019s elaborate setup, a profound quiet began to settle over the studio. A single stool was placed in a tight pool of white light. From the shadows, the cellist emerged and took her seat, her instrument looking dark and ancient under the glare. Then Liam walked out. He didn\u2019t look at the audience or the judges. He walked to the stool with a slow, deliberate pace, his worn jeans and simple t-shirt a stark contrast to Rex\u2019s flamboyant costume. The audience was a confused murmur. Where was the band? The spectacle? This felt less like a primetime show and more like a poetry reading.\n\nLiam sat down, adjusted the microphone, and took a breath. He looked at the cellist and gave a single, almost imperceptible nod. She drew her bow across the strings, and a low, mournful note filled the cavernous room, a sound so full of sorrow it seemed to absorb all other noise. Liam began to play, the simple, familiar chords of \u2018Yesterday\u2019 emerging, unadorned and clean. Then he sang. His voice was a near-whisper, an intimate confidence shared with millions. He sang not to the back row, but to the microphone in front of him, as if sharing a secret he could no longer bear to keep. The studio, which had been a rock arena just minutes before, was transformed into a single, quiet room. The audience was so still they seemed to have stopped breathing. The cameras did something they rarely did: they stopped moving, holding tight on Liam\u2019s face, catching the genuine pain in his eyes as he sang of a life he longed for but could never reclaim. The performance was an act of radical stillness, an island of quiet grief in an ocean of noise. When he breathed the final, whispered line, the silence that followed was absolute. It was not the stunned silence of surprise, but the heavy, reverent silence of a sacred space, a silence so profound it felt louder than any applause.\n\nFor a long, uncomfortable moment, no one moved. Then, from high up in the darkness, a single person began to clap, a slow, solitary sound. Another joined in, then another. The applause grew not in a rush, but as a slow, swelling tide of deep, heartfelt respect. It never reached the frenzied roar Rex had received; it was something else, something deeper and more personal, the sound of thousands of people acknowledging a shared, private sorrow. Liam finally looked up, his eyes glassy, appearing dazed and hollowed out by his own performance.\n\nThe host, visibly moved, cleared his throat several times before he could speak. He turned to the judges, who all looked as if they had been holding their breath. \u201cMarcus,\u201d the host said, his voice hushed. \u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t know what to say.\u201d Marcus leaned forward, his face a grim, thoughtful mask. He looked from Liam to Rex, who stood on the side of the stage, his perfect smile now looking like a painted-on facade. \u201cTonight we saw two masters at work,\u201d Marcus began, his voice a low, resonant rumble that seemed to quiet the very air. \u201cRex, what you did was a spectacle. It was a perfect piece of musical theatre, a display of breathtaking skill and showmanship. You gave a command performance. A ten out of ten.\u201d Rex nodded, accepting the praise, but his eyes were fixed on Marcus, waiting for the inevitable \u2018but\u2019.\n\n\u201cAnd then,\u201d Marcus continued, turning his full attention to Liam, \u201cyou came out. Rex\u2019s performance was a coronation. Liam, you invited us to a funeral. His was about the power and the glory of the human voice. Yours was about the fragility and the solitude of the human soul. One was a shout to the heavens, the other was a whisper into the void. I don\u2019t know how the public will vote,\u201d he said, looking directly at Liam with an expression of profound, almost paternal respect. \u201cBut what you just did wasn\u2019t about a competition. That was a work of art. And it was, in its own quiet way, one of the bravest things I have ever seen on this stage.\u201d\n\nThe rest of the judges\u2019 comments were a blur of hushed, emotional praise. Liam felt disconnected from it all, as if he were watching a replay of someone else\u2019s life. He walked off stage feeling not triumphant, but utterly drained, as if he had donated a pint of blood\u2014or a piece of his soul\u2014and was lightheaded from the loss. Backstage, the atmosphere around him was different again. The respect had deepened into something akin to awe. People kept their distance, speaking in hushed tones as he passed, as if he were a grieving relative or a holy man deep in meditation.\n\nHe found Rex by the exit, away from the prying eyes and cameras. The spectacular performer was leaning against a wall, his leather jacket looking like a suit of armour that had failed to protect him. His face, for the first time, was stripped of all artifice. There was no smirk, no condescension. There was only the cold, hard look of a master craftsman who had just watched a shaman conjure real magic. \u201cThat was a dirty trick, Harrison,\u201d Rex said, his voice flat and devoid of its usual silky texture. Liam said nothing. \u201cI put on a perfect show,\u201d Rex continued, more to himself than to Liam. \u201cI did everything right. The vocals, the staging, the energy. That\u2019s what this is supposed to be about.\u201d He finally looked at Liam, a bitter, bewildered understanding dawning in his eyes. \u201cYou didn\u2019t even try to compete, did you? You just bled all over the stage and made them watch. How is anyone supposed to compete with that?\u201d Without waiting for an answer, he pushed himself off the wall and walked out into the night, leaving Liam alone with the chilling realisation that he had finally found a weapon more powerful than talent, more effective than spectacle: his own, genuine, marketable pain.The results show was an exercise in slow-motion cruelty. The finalists were arranged on stage under the hot, unforgiving lights, their smiles tight and fragile. Liam stood in a daze, the ghost of his performance still clinging to him like a shroud. The host, with his practiced air of solemnity, began the weekly ritual of salvation and damnation. Liam\u2019s name was the first one called. The announcement was met with a deep, respectful roar from the audience, but he felt nothing\u2014no relief, no joy. He simply stepped forward as instructed, a puppet whose strings were being pulled by a force he no longer understood. Chloe\u2019s name was called soon after, her genuine, beaming smile a bright spot in the suffocating tension.\n\nThe line thinned. The host milked the drama, his pauses stretching into agonizing chasms of silence. Finally, only two contestants remained under the spotlights: a young, effervescent pop singer named Lily, whose talent was dwarfed by her infectious personality, and Rex Vance. A collective gasp went through the studio. Rex, the consummate professional, the pre-ordained star, was in the bottom two. The camera zoomed in on his face, but the mask was back in place. His expression was one of cool, almost bored, indifference. It was a masterful performance of its own, but Liam, watching from the safety of the saved, could see the frantic pulse beating in his throat. This was not part of the narrative. This was a catastrophic systems failure.\n\n\u201cRex, Lily, you will now sing for survival,\u201d the host intoned gravely. Lily went first, her voice trembling as she sang a saccharine ballad, her performance more about tearful pleading than vocal skill. Then it was Rex\u2019s turn. He walked to the center of the stage, not with his usual swagger, but with a quiet, measured tread. He\u2019d chosen a simple, heartbreaking ballad, a song of loss and regret. He sat on a stool, just as Liam had, with a single acoustic guitar. It was a shockingly transparent move, a desperate, calculated attempt to replicate Liam\u2019s formula. He began to sing, his voice, as always, technically flawless. The notes were perfect, the pitch unwavering. He even tried to inject a slight tremor, a manufactured vulnerability into the performance. But it was like watching a master painter try to forge a child\u2019s drawing. All the lines were correct, but the innocent, un-self-conscious heart was missing. He was acting sad. Liam had simply been sad. The difference was immense, and the audience could feel it.\n\nThe final decision fell to the judges. They saved Rex, citing his superior technical ability, but the reprieve was delivered like a sentence. \u201cYou are one of the most gifted vocalists we have ever had in this competition, Rex,\u201d Marcus said, his voice cold and clinical. \u201cBut you are singing from your head, not from your gut. You just tried to sell us an emotion you clearly don\u2019t feel. You are lucky that your technique is so good it can withstand the weight of that much insincerity. But luck runs out. Consider this a final warning.\u201d The humiliation was absolute. Rex nodded, his face a granite mask, and walked back to the line, a man saved from drowning only to be told he had forgotten how to breathe.\n\nLiam felt a wave of nausea. There was no victory in this, no satisfaction in seeing his rival humbled. He had just witnessed the machine at work. It had identified a successful formula\u2014raw, public vulnerability\u2014and it was now pressuring its other assets to replicate it. He saw his own future in Rex\u2019s hollow performance: a future of being forced to re-enact his own pain, to turn his genuine emotion into a tired gimmick until it, too, felt as insincere as Rex\u2019s tremor. The applause and cheering felt obscene, the sound of a crowd baying for blood disguised as art.\n\nThe moment they were off-air, Brenda May swept into the green room, her face aglow with a predator\u2019s satisfaction. She ignored the tearful, eliminated Lily, her focus entirely on her remaining assets. \u201cSpectacular television, everyone,\u201d she announced, her voice ringing with triumph. She zeroed in on Liam, her eyes gleaming. \u201cLiam, you have redefined this competition. The network is ecstatic. The numbers are astronomical. We\u2019ve discovered the audience isn\u2019t just looking for a singer; they\u2019re starving for a soul.\u201d Her words, which should have been a compliment, felt like a diagnosis. She clapped her hands together, a general leading her troops. \u201cSo we are going to give them what they want. This week\u2019s theme is \u2018Unplugged: Songs from the Heartbreak Hotel\u2019. I want raw. I want real. I want tears. In the dailies, on the stage, I want you to dig deep and give us the pain that makes the music beautiful. Don\u2019t hold anything back.\u201d She was no longer asking him to tell the truth. She was demanding he bleed on a schedule.\n\nHe escaped to his room, the walls feeling closer than ever. The sprawling city view that had once seemed so terrifying and beautiful now just looked like a million windows full of people he was expected to perform his sadness for. He felt a profound sense of isolation, a loneliness that was deeper and more absolute than anything he had ever felt pouring coffee in Mooloolaba. He had thought that was a cage, but this, this was a perfectly designed panopticon where his own heart was the prisoner. He collapsed onto the bed, the exhaustion not physical, but existential. He had won. He was the star of the show. And he had never felt more like a loser. He wanted to call his mum, to hear her simple, uncomplicated pride, but the words caught in his throat. How could he explain that his victory was his greatest defeat? How could he tell her that the whole country was in love with how broken he was?\n\nThe silence was broken by a soft, hesitant knock on his door. He ignored it, hoping they would go away. The knock came again, more insistent this time. Cursing under his breath, he dragged himself to the door and pulled it open, ready to snarl at whichever PA had been sent to drag him to another pointless debrief. But it wasn\u2019t a PA. It was Rex. He was out of his stage clothes, dressed in a simple black t-shirt and jeans. The carefully constructed hair was slightly messy, the mask of cool indifference was gone, replaced by a weary, hollowed-out expression Liam had never seen before. He looked smaller somehow, stripped of his usual aura of arrogant confidence. He wasn't holding a bottle of water or a witty, backhanded compliment. He just stood there, his hands shoved in his pockets, looking not at Liam, but at a spot on the carpet somewhere between them.\n\n\u201cThey saved me,\u201d Rex said, his voice flat, stripped of its usual melodic cadence. \u201cBecause I\u2019m a better machine. My technical specs are superior.\u201d He finally lifted his eyes, and they were filled with a bleak, burnt-out honesty. \u201cYou know what the worst part is? Up there, in that sing-off\u2026 for a second, I almost had it. I was thinking about my grandmother\u2014the real story, not the one for the cameras. About how she used to sing to me when I was a kid. And for just a second, I felt it. A real feeling.\u201d He shook his head, a bitter, self-mocking smile touching his lips. \u201cAnd then my brain kicked in. My training. It started analyzing the feeling, trying to replicate it, trying to figure out the right way to modulate my voice to \u2018perform\u2019 it correctly. And just like that\u2026 it was gone. I was just a guy doing a sad-voice impression.\u201d He looked at Liam, his gaze direct and stripped of all rivalry. \u201cYou don't have that filter, do you? It just\u2026 comes out.\u201d He wasn\u2019t asking a question. It was a statement of fact, a diagnosis from one patient to another. \u201cI came here to ask you how you do it,\u201d Rex said, his voice dropping to a near whisper. \u201cBut I think I just figured it out.\u201d He paused, a strange, grim understanding passing between the two of them, the star performer and the shaman. \u201cYou don\u2019t. It does it to you.\u201dThe confession hung in the space between them, stark and unadorned. Rex\u2019s words, stripped of their usual performative gloss, were more resonant than any power ballad. He had named the beast that Liam had felt chewing on his own soul. *It does it to you.* In that moment, the rivalry that had defined their existence in this high-rise prison evaporated, replaced by a grim and unsettling fraternity. Liam had no advice to offer, no words of comfort. He could only stand in the doorway, a mirror image of the man before him\u2014one polished to a high sheen, the other weathered and raw, but both of them cracked. He gave a slow, almost imperceptible nod, an acknowledgment that carried the weight of everything they couldn't say. Rex held his gaze for a second longer, a flicker of something that might have been gratitude in his burnt-out eyes, then turned and walked down the silent, empty hallway, his shoulders slumped in a way that no camera would ever be permitted to capture.\n\nThe week that followed was a slow descent into a new kind of hell. Brenda\u2019s \u2018Heartbreak Hotel\u2019 theme was a directive for emotional self-flagellation, and the entire production leaned into it with a ghoulish enthusiasm. The B-roll camera crews were no longer looking for \u2018wondrous arrival\u2019 shots; they were hunting for tears. They filmed the contestants talking about their first heartbreaks, their biggest regrets, their deepest fears. It was group therapy repurposed as reality television, with ratings as the intended outcome. Chloe, ever the professional, gave them a sweet, sad story about her childhood dog, a performance of gentle melancholy that was perfectly on-brand. Rex was a blank wall; he gave them nothing, answering their probing questions with curt, media-trained non-answers, his face a mask of polite boredom. He had withdrawn his soul from the marketplace.\n\nLiam, however, simply shut down. The guitar, which had been his sanctuary and his weapon, now felt like an instrument of torture. He left it in its case, leaning against the wall like a coffin. He couldn\u2019t sing. When he tried, the direct line from his heart to his voice felt severed, replaced by a tangled switchboard of self-awareness and expectation. He was being asked to feel on command, and the demand itself had cauterized the source. His room, with its spectacular, mocking view, became his cell. He\u2019d sit for hours, staring at the cityscape, feeling nothing but a vast, grey numbness. The voice that could \u2018heal the sick and raise the dead\u2019 was silent, its owner in a self-imposed coma. The production team grew frantic. The golden goose was refusing to lay its golden, tear-stained eggs.\n\nGaz cornered him in the hallway on the way to a vocal session he was planning to skip. The director\u2019s usual breezy jargon was gone, replaced by a raw, undisguised panic. \u201cWhat is wrong with you, Harrison?\u201d he hissed, his face uncomfortably close. \u201cYou\u2019ve got the whole country in the palm of your hand and you\u2019re going mute on me. This is \u2018Heartbreak\u2019 week! This is your Super Bowl! We\u2019ve given you the perfect song, the ultimate showcase for your little broken-bird routine. You need to give us something!\u201d Liam just stared at him, his expression blank. The lack of reaction seemed to infuriate Gaz more than any argument would have. \u201cDon\u2019t you get it? They love you because you hurt. So get in there and hurt for them!\u201d The order was so grotesque, so nakedly vampiric, that it finally broke through Liam\u2019s apathy. He didn\u2019t say a word. He just turned around and walked back to his room, locking the door behind him.\n\nThe song they had chosen for him was a masterstroke of psychological cruelty. A PA had slid the envelope under his door two days earlier, and he had left it lying on the floor, unopened. He finally picked it up now, tearing it open with a sense of grim finality. Inside was a single sheet of paper. The song was \u2018Hurt\u2019. They hadn\u2019t even specified an artist, as if the raw sentiment of the title was all that mattered. The Nine Inch Nails original was a howl of nihilistic self-loathing; the Johnny Cash cover was a deathbed confession, a man taking stock of a life of pain and regret. Both were masterpieces of despair. It was Brenda holding up a mirror and commanding him to bleed. The choice was so on-the-nose, so cynically perfect, that a dry, humorless laugh escaped his lips. It was the first sound he had made all day.\n\nHis refusal to perform at the band rehearsal caused a full-blown crisis. He walked into the studio, saw the setup, the expectant faces of the musicians, and just shook his head. \u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d he said, his voice a hoarse whisper, and walked out, leaving a stunned silence in his wake. Hours later, Brenda May herself appeared at his door. The knock was sharp, imperious. He didn\u2019t open it. \u201cLiam,\u201d her voice came through the wood, smooth and cold as steel. \u201cYou are under contract. You will perform the song we have assigned you on Saturday night. If you continue this behavior, you will be in breach, and I assure you, the consequences will be far more painful than singing a sad song on television. Do not test me.\u201d The threat hung in the air, an iron fist in a velvet glove. He was trapped. There was no escape.\n\nLater that evening, there was another knock. Softer this time. He expected Chloe, with her worried eyes and a cup of tea. He opened the door a crack. It was Rex. He was holding a bottle of expensive-looking whiskey and two of the hotel\u2019s heavy glass tumblers. He didn\u2019t ask for permission, just pushed the door open and walked in, his presence filling the sterile room with a weary, cynical energy. He placed the glasses on the small table by the window and poured two generous measures, the amber liquid catching the light of the city. He pushed one glass towards Liam and took the other for himself. \u201cThe vultures are circling, Harrison,\u201d he said, his voice low. \u201cI saw Gaz\u2019s face. He looks like his prize racehorse has decided to take up knitting.\u201d He took a sip of the whiskey, his eyes scanning Liam\u2019s drawn, pale face. \u201cYou\u2019ve got the yips. The golden faucet of pain has run dry, right when they need it most.\u201d\n\nLiam sank into the chair opposite him, the glass heavy in his hand. \u201cI can\u2019t do it,\u201d he confessed, the words tasting like failure. \u201cI try to sing, and there\u2019s nothing there. It\u2019s just\u2026 gone. It\u2019s like they\u2019ve scared it away.\u201d Rex nodded slowly, swirling the whiskey in his glass. \u201cOf course it\u2019s gone. You can\u2019t force a feeling. The harder you try to grab it, the faster it disappears. That\u2019s amateur stuff.\u201d He leaned forward, his expression serious, the teacher addressing the student. \u201cYou\u2019re trying to live in it again. You\u2019re trying to feel the salt on your tongue, right? You\u2019re trying to actually be that sad kid in the caf\u00e9. That\u2019s your mistake. You can\u2019t go back there. Not really. And you\u2019ll drive yourself insane trying.\u201d He took another drink, his eyes fixed on Liam. \u201cYou need to stop being an artist and start being a cinematographer. Your job isn\u2019t to feel the emotion anymore. Your job is to remember it. You need to detach. Objectify it. Treat your past like a film you\u2019re directing.\u201d\n\nHe leaned in closer, his voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. \u201cWhen you get on that stage, don\u2019t try to feel sad. That\u2019s for the audience. You need to be cold. Clinical. Remember the details. The exact shade of the spilled milk on the counter. The sound of a specific gull. The precise look on your mum\u2019s face when she\u2019s tired. You catalogue those details, you project them out of your head with your voice, and you let the audience put the emotion together for themselves. You give them the ingredients of sadness, and they will bake the cake. You just have to be the guy reading the recipe. It feels like a lie, but it\u2019s not. It\u2019s just professional.\u201d He sat back, letting the advice settle, a piece of dark, brilliant, and utterly necessary wisdom. It was a trade-off: a way to survive the machine, but the price was the last shred of his untainted connection to his own art. Liam looked from the whiskey in his glass to the guitar sitting silent in the corner. He had a choice. He could break, or he could learn how to fake his own truth. He picked up the glass and drained it in one, burning swallow.The whiskey burned a trail of cold fire down his throat, a stark, physical sensation that momentarily silenced the noise in his head. In the hazy morning light, the glass sat on the nightstand, a monument to his surrender. He didn't feel better. He didn't feel healed. He felt cold, clear, and hollow, like a house whose tenants had packed up and left in the middle of the night. Rex\u2019s words from the night before were not a comfort; they were a blueprint, a schematic for survival that required the dismantling of his own spirit. He had a choice: be a casualty or be a collaborator in his own commodification. He picked up his phone, not to call his mother, but to send a single, curt text to the production coordinator: \u2018Book me the main rehearsal studio. One hour. I\u2019m ready.\u2019\n\nHe walked into the studio like a different person. The anxious, uncertain energy that had clung to him like the coastal humidity was gone, replaced by a still, quiet focus that was far more unnerving. He bypassed a relieved-looking Gaz, ignored the flurry of questions from PAs, and went directly to the musical director. \u201cJust a cello, like we tried,\u201d he said, his voice flat and even. \u201cAnd I need a different microphone. A condenser. I want it to pick up everything. Every breath. Every scrape of my finger on the string.\u201d Dave, the MD, looked at him with renewed interest, recognizing the language of a professional, not a terrified amateur. Liam turned to the cellist, the same woman from before. \u201cFollow my breath,\u201d he instructed, his tone polite but devoid of warmth. \u201cWhen I pull back, you swell. You are the emotion. I\u2019m just the narrator.\u201d The woman nodded, her expression shifting from sympathetic to intrigued. He was no longer a boy she needed to comfort; he was a conductor giving a precise directive.\n\nHe sat on the stool and began to play, not for Gaz or the band, but for the sound engineer behind the glass, treating the rehearsal like a technical run-through. He sang the first verse of \u2018Hurt\u2019, his eyes open and fixed on a spot on the far wall. His voice was clean, controlled, every note perfectly placed. He wasn\u2019t feeling. He was projecting. He summoned the images Rex had spoken of, treating them like slides in a carousel. *Image: the precise way the rust had eaten into the metal legs of the caf\u00e9 tables. Image: the fraying cuff of his favourite old jumper. Image: the network of tiny lines around his mother\u2019s eyes when she laughed.* He was a documentarian of his own past, his voice the instrument of transmission. On the line, \u201cThe needle tears a hole,\u201d he didn\u2019t sing with anguish; he sang with a chilling, detached precision, as if describing a medical procedure. The cello behind him wept and swelled, filling the emotional space he had deliberately vacated. When he finished, the studio was deathly quiet. Gaz\u2019s voice crackled over the intercom, shaky and confused. \u201cOkay\u2026 yeah. That\u2019ll work. Jesus.\u201d Liam didn\u2019t acknowledge him. He simply nodded to the cellist and the engineer, stood up, and walked out of the room, his part of the transaction complete.\n\nOn the night of the live show, a strange calm had settled over him. He watched the other contestants from the wings, his mind a quiet, orderly place. He felt like an observer, a visitor from another world. Rex delivered a blistering, high-energy rock number, a tactical retreat to his core strength of pure, polished showmanship. He was brilliant, professional, and safe, a performance designed to remind the judges of his commercial viability. After his performance, as he passed Liam in the darkened corridor backstage, he didn\u2019t offer a witty remark. He simply gave a single, sharp nod, the silent acknowledgment of a fellow tradesman. The student was about to present his thesis.\n\nWalking to the stage felt like stepping into a laboratory. The lights, the audience, the judges\u2014they were all variables in an experiment he was about to conduct. He sat on the stool, the warmth of the lights a distant sensation. He registered the silence, the expectation, the thousands of pairs of eyes, but he felt none of it. He was hermetically sealed inside his new method. The cellist began, her mournful notes laying a bed of sorrow for him to lie upon. He closed his eyes, not to feel, but to better see the images stored in his mind\u2019s archive. *I hurt myself today, to see if I still feel.* The line came out not as a cry, but as a statement of fact, the opening of a lab report. His voice was a scalpel, dissecting his own history with surgical precision. *I focus on the pain, the only thing that\u2019s real.* He sang the line while picturing the chipped rim of a coffee cup, the detail so vivid and specific that it became, in that moment, the only real thing in the universe.\n\nHe didn't build to a crescendo of pain. He built a museum of it, each line a different exhibit, each note a plaque describing the artifact. He was a tour guide walking the audience through the ruins of his own 'yesterday'. For the final verse, Johnny Cash\u2019s verse, he let a new set of images in. The sterile hotel room. The flashing \u2018On Air\u2019 sign. Brenda May\u2019s predatory smile. Rex\u2019s hollowed-out eyes. *If I could start again, a million miles away, I would keep myself. I would find a way.* The confession was real, but the pain was second-hand, a memory of a feeling, not the feeling itself. He sang the final line and let the sound fade into nothing, his face a perfect mask of serene, dignified sorrow. The performance was a lie. And it was the most truthful thing he had ever sung on that stage.\n\nThe reaction was immediate and terrifying. The silence was deeper, more profound than the week before. And then came the sound. It wasn't applause. It was the sound of weeping. A soft, collective, heartbroken sob that rippled through the entire auditorium. The cameras panned across the audience, capturing faces streaked with tears, people holding each other, utterly devastated. Liam had given them the ingredients, and they had baked a thousand different cakes of their own private grief. He had become a vessel for their pain, a blank screen onto which they projected their own heartbreaks. He had never been more powerful, or more alone.\n\nWhen the host finally spoke, his voice was thick with emotion. The judges looked shattered. Marcus stared at Liam, his face not grim or severe, but deeply, profoundly sad. He didn't speak for a long time, just held Liam\u2019s gaze. \u201cIn my life,\u201d Marcus said finally, his voice raspy, \u201cI have seen artists give a piece of themselves to an audience. I have never before seen a man perform his own vivisection on live television and leave his soul on the stage for everyone to see.\u201d He shook his head, a look of deep conflict in his eyes. \u201cIt was a masterpiece of emotional devastation. It was perfect. And I hated every single second of it.\u201d He looked away from Liam, towards the camera. \u201cBecause I fear we have just witnessed the birth of a great artist, and the death of a happy man. And I\u2019m not sure we, or he, should be celebrating that.\u201d The words were a benediction and an indictment, a crown of thorns placed gently on Liam\u2019s head. He had won. The cost was simply everything.The silence that followed Marcus\u2019s verdict was more damning than any booing could ever have been. It was the silence of a truth so stark and uncomfortable that no one knew how to react. The applause had been for the art; the silence was for the man. As Liam walked off stage, the crew members and fellow contestants parted for him as if he were a leper, their faces a mixture of awe, pity, and fear. The usual post-performance back-slaps and \u201cgreat job, mate\u201d were conspicuously absent. He was surrounded by a quarantine of respect. Chloe reached him first, her own triumph forgotten. She didn\u2019t congratulate him. She grabbed his arm, her hand trembling, and looked into his blank, distant eyes. \u201cLiam, are you okay?\u201d she asked, her voice a small, worried whisper. The simple, human question was so out of place in the artificial ecosystem of the show that he had no idea how to answer it.\n\nBefore he could even try, Brenda May descended upon them, her face alight with a terrifying, ecstatic energy. She moved with the triumphant swagger of a general whose risky strategy had just won the war. \u201cA masterpiece of emotional devastation,\u201d she quoted Marcus, her voice dripping with glee, not concern. She beamed at Liam, her eyes shining with the thrill of a ratings victory. \u201cThe network is in raptures. The phone lines exploded. You\u2019re not just a contestant anymore, Liam. You\u2019re a cultural event.\u201d She patted his arm, a gesture that felt more like she was assessing the quality of a prize-winning animal than offering comfort. \u201cThe \u2018Broken Artist\u2019 narrative arc is the most compelling story we\u2019ve had in years. This is television gold. Pure gold.\u201d She didn\u2019t see a man; she saw a demographic, a trend, a product whose key selling point was its own destruction. The celebration felt like a wake.\n\nSleep was no longer a possibility. His hotel room was a silent tomb, the sprawling city lights outside the window providing no comfort, only a cold, indifferent illumination. He sat on the edge of the bed for hours, the television a blank screen, his phone lying face down. He was afraid to turn either of them on, afraid to see the face that was supposedly his, praised for its exquisite suffering. The numbness of the past few days had receded, replaced by a vast, echoing emptiness. He had poured everything out on that stage, every memory, every detail, and now there was nothing left inside. He was a vessel that had been emptied for public consumption. He had won the game, but in doing so, had proven Rex\u2019s bleakest prophecies correct. He had strip-mined his own soul for their entertainment, and now the landscape was barren.\n\nFinally, at three in the morning, his resolve crumbled. He needed to hear a voice that wasn\u2019t analyzing him, praising him, or trying to sell him something. He needed an anchor. He called his mum. She answered instantly, her voice thick and alert, as if she had been sitting by the phone, waiting. \u201cLiam?\u201d He tried to speak, but only a choked, broken sound came out. \u201cOh, lovey,\u201d she said, and the simple, unconditional love in those two words broke him. A single, hot tear traced a path down his cheek, the first thing he had genuinely felt all night. \u201cI saw it,\u201d she said, her voice quiet and strained. \u201cMel had it on the big screen at the club. The whole place was watching.\u201d There was a pause, and he could hear her take a shaky breath. \u201cAbout halfway through, I asked Jake to drive me home. I couldn\u2019t watch anymore.\u201d This wasn\u2019t the proud, ecstatic call from weeks ago. This was the voice of a mother who had just watched her son walk into a fire. \u201cThat man on the television, the judge, he said you were a great artist but not a happy man. And he was right, wasn\u2019t he? That face on the screen\u2026 that wasn\u2019t my boy. That was a ghost. What are they doing to you in that place, Liam?\u201d\n\nHer question was a key turning a lock deep inside him. It wasn\u2019t a cage anymore. It was a factory, and he was both the raw material and the product, being systematically disassembled and re-packaged for sale. The ambition that had propelled him here, the desperate need to escape the familiar rhythm of his life, now seemed like a foolish, childish dream. He had traded a beautiful cage for an abattoir. \u201cI want to come home,\u201d he whispered into the phone, the words feeling like the first truly authentic thing he had said all week. There was no hesitation on her end, only a wave of pure, unadulterated relief. \u201cYour room\u2019s waiting for you, lovey,\u201d she said, her voice breaking. \u201cIt\u2019s always waiting.\u201d\n\nAfter the call, clarity descended. It wasn\u2019t a difficult decision. It was the only decision. It was an act of self-preservation. He moved with a quiet, methodical purpose he hadn't felt in weeks. He opened his cheap duffel bag and began to pack. He left the neatly folded piles of X-Factor branded tracksuits and t-shirts on the bed, a uniform for a soldier deserting his post. He packed his own worn jeans, his faded surf-shop hoodies, the clothes that held the faint, lingering scent of salt and home. He slid the cardboard tube containing his Bachelor of Marketing degree out from under the bed\u2014the bitter joke that now felt like a relic from another, simpler lifetime\u2014and placed it carefully in the bag. It was a part of his story they had never been interested in, and for that, he was suddenly grateful. He picked up his guitar, its familiar weight a comfort, a friend who had been forced to bear witness to his ordeal.\n\nHe stood in the middle of the room and looked around one last time at the sterile luxury, the panoramic view of a world he had briefly conquered and now utterly rejected. He felt no regret, only a profound and urgent need to leave. He pulled out a sheet of the hotel\u2019s heavy stationery and a pen. He thought of writing a long letter to Brenda, a scathing indictment of the machine. He thought of writing to Marcus, to thank him for seeing the truth. But words felt useless, part of the game he was now refusing to play. Instead, he wrote just three. *I quit. Liam.* He left the note on the pillow where the branded clothes lay. It was a simple, stark resignation. On his way out, he stopped in front of Rex\u2019s door. He took another piece of paper and wrote two words this time. *You were right.* He slid it under the door, a final message to his strange, cynical saviour. He didn\u2019t take the express lift in the lobby. He found a service elevator at the end of the hall, the kind used by housekeeping and room service. As the brushed steel doors slid closed, he caught his reflection. The face staring back was tired, gaunt, and etched with a profound weariness, but for the first time in a very long time, it was his own. He wasn't the Surfer-Boy-Saviour, or the Broken Artist. He was just Liam Harrison. And he was going home.The service elevator whirred and clunked its way down, a utilitarian metal box smelling faintly of bleach and stale cigarette smoke. It was a jarring contrast to the silent, carpeted opulence of the guest lifts, which ascended with the smooth, soundless grace of a prayer. Liam felt the difference in his bones. This was a descent back to reality, a journey into the engine room of the magnificent ship he was abandoning. He emerged not into a lobby of marble and meaningless art, but into a concrete basement labyrinth of humming ice machines, bundled linens, and the greasy, comforting smell of the staff canteen\u2019s breakfast shift. He was invisible here. A ghost in a grey hoodie, his guitar case a cumbersome, unfamiliar appendage. No one gave him a second glance. He was just another part of the machinery, heading for the exit. He pushed through a heavy fire door and found himself in a narrow, shadowed laneway, the pre-dawn air cool and tasting of diesel fumes and damp pavement. It was the most beautiful thing he had ever tasted.\n\nHe walked for several blocks before hailing a taxi, the act itself a small miracle of regained autonomy. The driver, a weary-looking man with a podcast about ancient history murmuring from the speakers, glanced at him in the rear-view mirror. \"To the airport, mate?\" he asked, and that was it. There was no flicker of recognition, no hushed whisper of \"Aren't you that guy from the telly?\". He was just a fare, a man with a guitar case heading for the airport at an ungodly hour. The relief was so profound it was almost dizzying. As the cab pulled into the city\u2019s traffic, his phone, which he had foolishly left on, began to buzz. A blocked number. It buzzed again, and again, a frantic, insistent vibration against his leg. It was the machine, waking up and realizing a cog was missing. It was the sound of panic, of schedules being destroyed, of a narrative going off-script. With a slow, deliberate movement, he reached into his pocket, held down the power button, and watched the screen go black. The ensuing silence felt absolute, a small, perfect victory.\n\nThe domestic terminal was a cathedral of quiet, early-morning transit. People slept in uncomfortable chairs, nursed takeaway coffees, and stared blankly at departure boards. They were all in-between, moving from one part of their real lives to another. Liam checked his duffel bag, bought a coffee that was scalding hot and reassuringly mediocre, and found a seat by a window overlooking the tarmac. He watched the ground crews moving in their fluorescent vests, the baggage carts balletically weaving across the wet asphalt. It was a world of tangible purpose, of things that needed to be loaded and planes that needed to fly. It was a world blessedly free of B-roll, media training, and the relentless demand for marketable pain. He was just a guy waiting for a flight, another anonymous face in the river of humanity, and the ordinariness of it was a balm to his scorched soul. He didn't think about what would happen when his absence was discovered. He didn't think about the contract or Brenda May\u2019s rage. He thought only of the gentle curve of Mooloolaba Bay.\n\nThe flight was short, a little over an hour, but the transition was seismic. As the plane banked and began its descent, the sprawling, intricate geometry of Sydney gave way to the deep, unbroken blue of the Pacific. Then, land appeared. Not the grey-brown haze of a metropolis, but a vibrant, living coastline of impossible greens and golds. He saw the Glass House Mountains hazy in the distance, the winding thread of the Maroochy River, the white-flecked surf rolling onto endless stretches of sand. This was a landscape painted with a different palette, shaped by a different god. He felt his shoulders, which had been hunched in a permanent defensive crouch for weeks, begin to unclench. His lungs, accustomed to the refrigerated, recycled air of the hotel and the studio, felt tight, as if preparing for a different atmosphere.\n\nThe moment the plane doors opened, it hit him. Not just air, but a thick, warm, living entity. It was a wall of humidity, saturated with the smell of salt, damp earth, and blooming frangipani. It coated his tongue and worked its way into the seams of his clothes. He had forgotten its power, its sheer, physical presence. He walked down the metal steps onto the tarmac\u2014there were no aerobridges at the small Sunshine Coast airport\u2014and the sound was the next wave. Not the hum of traffic and distant sirens, but the shrill, familiar caw of gulls and the high-pitched thrum of cicadas, a sound so intrinsic to home he hadn\u2019t even realized he\u2019d missed it. He stopped at the bottom of the stairs, his duffel bag in one hand, his guitar in the other, and closed his eyes. He breathed it all in, a man dying of thirst taking his first drink of water.\n\nThe taxi home was a journey back through his own life. The driver, a young woman with zinc on her nose, recognized him instantly. \u201cHey, you\u2019re Liam!\u201d she said, her smile wide and uncomplicated. \u201cWe\u2019ve all been watching you, mate. You\u2019re a bloody legend! What are you doing back?\u201d He just smiled, a tired, genuine smile. \u201cJust came home for a bit,\u201d he said, and she accepted it without question, launching into a story about how the whole pub she worked at went quiet every time he sang. It was different here. The fame wasn\u2019t a commodity; it was a form of community pride, simple and direct. The car passed the surf club, the beachfront caf\u00e9 where he used to work\u2014it looked smaller, somehow\u2014the familiar pandanus trees leaning in the wind. The glare off the Coral Sea was a physical force, but it no longer felt relentless. It felt like a welcome.\n\nHe asked the driver to drop him at the end of his street. He wanted to walk the last few yards himself. The house was a small, weatherboard cottage, its paint peeling slightly from the constant assault of the salt air. It looked beautiful. The front door opened before he was halfway up the garden path. His mum stood there, her face a roadmap of worry, love, and profound relief. She looked older than he remembered, or perhaps he was just seeing her more clearly now. She didn\u2019t run to him, and he didn\u2019t run to her. They met in the middle of the small, overgrown lawn. She wrapped her arms around him, her small frame surprisingly strong, and he buried his face in her shoulder, the familiar scent of her washing powder and her skin an anchor in the spinning world. He held on tight, his body shaking with the release of weeks of coiled tension. There were no words. None were needed.\n\nLater, in the quiet of his old bedroom, the world felt small and manageable again. The room was exactly as he\u2019d left it, a museum of his former life. Surf posters on the wall, a stack of dog-eared novels on the bedside table, the cardboard tube with his degree sticking out from under the bed. He opened the window, and the sound of the ocean, a distant, rhythmic shushing, filled the space. The salt was in the air, a fine, gritty mist. He picked up his phone, the sleek, black rectangle that had been his lifeline and his leash. He didn't smash it. He didn't throw it into the sea. He simply popped the back off, removed the SIM card\u2014a tiny chip containing an entire world of pressure and expectation\u2014and let it fall onto the dusty floor. He was offline. He was disconnected. He was free. He lay back on his narrow bed, the lumpy mattress a greater comfort than any king-sized pillow-topped monstrosity, and listened to the waves. The salt was the first thing. Always. But it was no longer the taste of a cage. It was the taste of home.The first morning back was a slow, gentle awakening, a stark contrast to the jolting, pre-dawn summons of the production schedule. He woke not to an alarm or a PA knocking on his door, but to a slash of bright, humid sunlight cutting through a gap in his old, faded curtains. The air was thick and still, stirred only by the lazy whir of the ceiling fan clicking softly with each rotation. He lay there for a long time, listening. He could hear the distant, rhythmic sigh of the surf, the chatter of rainbow lorikeets in the mango tree outside, the clatter of his mother making breakfast in the kitchen. These were the sounds of his life, a soundtrack he hadn't realized he\u2019d been missing until it was returned to him. There was no schedule on a tablet, no camera crew waiting to film him look \u2018natural\u2019, no one demanding he feel anything at all. The day stretched before him, a vast, formless, beautiful expanse of nothing. It was the greatest luxury he had ever known.\n\nIn the kitchen, his mother moved with a quiet, practiced efficiency. She didn\u2019t ask him about the show, about Sydney, about the haunted look in his eyes. She simply placed a plate of scrambled eggs and buttery toast in front of him, the way she had a thousand times before. The gesture was an act of profound, uncomplicated love, a reclamation. They ate in a comfortable silence, punctuated only by the scrape of cutlery on plates and the murmur of a local radio station. He watched her hands as she refilled his coffee cup, noting the network of fine lines and the faint, permanent stain of garden soil under her nails. These were real hands, hands that fixed things and grew things and held him when he was small. Everything in this room, from the chipped ceramic mugs to the faded tea towel hanging on the oven door, was imbued with a history that was messy, authentic, and his own. He felt the tight, frozen knot in his chest, a knot he hadn\u2019t even been fully aware of, begin to slowly, painstakingly, dissolve.\n\nThe shrill ring of the landline, a sound he hadn\u2019t heard in months, made him jump. His mother answered, her voice soft, then she passed the receiver to him with a small, knowing smile. It was Jake. The voice that came roaring down the line was a jolt of pure, uncut Mooloolaba energy. \u201cYou absolute lunatic! You did it! You actually just walked out! It\u2019s all over the news, mate. They\u2019re losing their minds! Are you okay? Did they have snipers on the roof?\u201d The barrage of questions was so perfectly Jake that Liam let out a real, genuine laugh, a sound that felt rusty from disuse. \u201cI\u2019m okay, mate,\u201d he said, leaning against the kitchen wall. \u201cJust\u2026 done.\u201d \u201cDone? You were winning! You were the king!\u201d Jake\u2019s voice was a mixture of awe and utter bewilderment. \u201cYeah, well. The crown was too heavy,\u201d Liam said, the words coming out simpler and truer than any lyric he\u2019d sung on stage. There was a pause on the other end, and then Jake\u2019s tone softened. \u201cFair enough. Well, the king is home. First beer is on me. Don\u2019t be a stranger.\u201d The call was a bridge back to a world where walking away from fame wasn\u2019t a crisis or a breach of contract, but something your best mate would understand after a moment of stunned disbelief.\n\nLater that morning, the four walls of his house, which had at first felt like a sanctuary, began to feel too small. He needed air, space, the horizon. He pulled on a pair of old boardshorts and a t-shirt, slid his feet into worn-out thongs, and stepped out into the blinding midday sun. The walk towards the beach was a gauntlet of familiar faces. A neighbour watering his lawn gave him a thumbs-up and a wide grin. A woman driving past in a minivan slowed down and yelled \u201cGo, Liam!\u201d out the window. It wasn't intrusive or demanding; it was warm, personal, but it was also a constant reminder that he was no longer just a local boy. He was a local hero, a public figure, a role he had just run a thousand kilometres to escape. He felt a phantom urge to look around for a camera crew, to arrange his face into a mask of humble gratitude. The training was sunk deep.\n\nHe found himself standing across the road from the beachfront caf\u00e9. It looked exactly the same, a little tired, a little shabby, the windows hazed with a fine layer of salt. Through the glass, he could see Mel, a thunderous scowl on her face as she berated a young kid fumbling with the coffee grinder. He almost kept walking, but some instinct told him he needed to close this circle. He crossed the road, the hot asphalt burning the soles of his feet, and pushed open the door. The jingle of the little bell above the door was a sound from another lifetime. Mel looked up, her scowl deepening as she saw him. \u201cWhat in the bloody hell do you want?\u201d she rasped, her voice pure gravel. \u201cCome to quit again?\u201d Liam felt a flush of shame. \u201cNo,\u201d he said, his voice quiet. \u201cI came to apologize. For how I left.\u201d He stood there, waiting for the tirade. Instead, she just stared at him for a long moment, her shrewd eyes taking in his tired face, the anxious energy he was trying to hide. She grunted, a sound that was her equivalent of a sigh. She turned, pulled a cup, and slammed it under the espresso machine. \u201cYou looked like a damned ghost on the telly last week,\u201d she said, not looking at him, her back turned as she frothed the milk with an aggressive hiss. \u201cThought you were gonna fall over. This one\u2019s on the house,\u201d she added, sliding a flat white across the counter towards him. \u201cDon\u2019t get used to it.\u201d It was the closest he would ever get to an expression of concern from her, and it meant more than all the judges\u2019 praise combined.\n\nHe took the coffee, the ceramic warm in his hands, and walked down the wooden stairs to the beach. He found a spot on the soft, white sand, far from the main throng of sunbathers and tourists, and sat down. He watched the impossibly blue water of the Coral Sea roll in, each wave collapsing on the shore in a hiss of white foam. The coffee was strong and slightly bitter, just as he remembered. He didn\u2019t feel the need to sing. He didn\u2019t feel the need to do anything. The constant, gnawing pressure to create, to feel, to perform, was gone. There was only the sun on his skin, the rhythmic crash of the waves, and the vast, empty canvas of the sky. For the first time in what felt like a lifetime, his mind was quiet. He just sat and watched the tide come in, a man learning how to simply exist again. He was not an artist. He was not a star. He was a body on a beach, and it was enough.\n\nHe returned home as the afternoon light began to soften, turning the sky a pale, dusty pink. The house was quiet. He found his mum in the living room, watching the television with the sound turned low. He was about to speak when he saw his own face flash onto the screen. It was an entertainment news program, the graphics loud and flashy. The chyron at the bottom of the screen screamed: \u201cX-FACTOR IN CHAOS: STAR FINALIST LIAM HARRISON QUITS SHOW.\u201d There was footage of him from the last performance, his face pale and strained. There was a tight-lipped \u201cno comment\u201d from a harried-looking Brenda May being ambushed in a parking garage. There were \u2018industry experts\u2019 speculating wildly about a nervous breakdown, a secret illness, a dramatic falling out with the judges. They were turning his escape into a new storyline, his private act of self-preservation into the season\u2019s most dramatic plot twist. He watched, a cold knot forming in his stomach, as they defined him, packaged him, and sold his departure as just another piece of must-see TV. He had left the building, but he hadn't escaped the story. The machine didn\u2019t need him present to keep grinding him up.His mother switched the television off with a sharp, angry flick of the remote, plunging the room into a sudden, blessed silence. The slick, sensationalist graphics and the smirking face of the entertainment reporter vanished, but their residue lingered in the air, a toxic, invisible film. Liam sat frozen on the couch, the cold knot in his stomach tightening into a solid fist of ice. They had taken his quiet, desperate act of self-preservation and twisted it into a spectacle, another cliffhanger in the weekly drama. The \u2018Broken Artist\u2019 hadn\u2019t escaped; he\u2019d just been given a new, more tragic, and far more profitable storyline. The machine hadn\u2019t been broken by his departure; it had simply absorbed it, metabolizing his rebellion into more content. He had walked out of the prison, only to discover the walls were everywhere.\n\n\u201cVultures,\u201d his mother said, her voice a low, furious tremor. She stood by the blank television screen, her hands clenched at her sides. \u201cThey\u2019re not happy just to put you through a meat grinder, they want to pick over the bones, too. To say those things\u2026 \u2018a nervous breakdown\u2019\u2026 like you\u2019re some kind of performing monkey who finally snapped.\u201d Her anger was a shield, a fierce, protective fire that was more comforting than any gentle words could have been. She saw him not as a story, not as a casualty, but as her son, and she was furious on his behalf. \u201cThey don\u2019t get to do this, Liam. They don\u2019t get to follow you home and write stories about you. This is your home. You\u2019re safe here.\u201d He wanted to believe her, but he could feel the long, cold shadow of the Sydney tower stretching all the way to this small, quiet living room. Safety felt like a memory from a world that no longer existed.\n\nThe next day, the illusion of peace was shattered. The easy anonymity he had felt for a fleeting twenty-four hours was gone, replaced by a constant, low-grade vigilance. When he walked outside, his eyes scanned the street not for familiar faces, but for unfamiliar cars parked at odd angles. He looked for the glint of sunlight on something that didn't belong. The town\u2019s affection, which had felt so warm and simple the day before, now seemed tinged with the media\u2019s narrative. The friendly waves from passing cars felt different, freighted with a new curiosity. He could see the questions in their eyes, the echo of the television reports. They weren\u2019t just proud of the local boy who made good; they were worried about, and fascinated by, the fragile star who had supposedly cracked. He was no longer just Liam; he was a story they had all been told, and he could feel them trying to fit him into its frame.\n\nHe tried to find sanctuary on the beach, walking far down the coast towards a stretch of deserted sand where the tourists rarely ventured. He needed to feel the sun and the salt without the weight of being watched. Jake met him there, carrying a weathered Esky and two fishing rods. For an hour, it almost worked. They cast their lines into the surf, the conversation drifting easily between old school friends and the dismal prospects of the local footy team. It was a perfect facsimile of their old lives, a moment of cherished, profane normalcy. They were just two mates fishing. But then Liam saw it. A flicker of movement in the scrubby dunes behind them, a place where no one should be. A quick, sharp glint of light. A long lens. The paparazzi had found him. The machine had sent a scout. The cold dread that washed over him was a familiar, sickening tide.\n\nJake saw the change in his expression and followed his gaze. His easy-going smile vanished, replaced by a thunderous scowl. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding me,\u201d he snarled, dropping his rod in the sand. \u201cI\u2019ll go have a word with that creep.\u201d He started towards the dunes, his posture radiating aggression, ready to defend his friend and his territory. But Liam grabbed his arm, his grip surprisingly strong. \u201cNo, Jake. Don\u2019t.\u201d Jake turned, bewildered. \u201cWhat do you mean, don\u2019t? He\u2019s filming you! I\u2019m gonna go break his bloody camera.\u201d Liam shook his head, a grim, weary wisdom in his eyes that hadn\u2019t been there a month ago. \u201cAnd then what? The headline tomorrow will be \u2018Troubled Star\u2019s Violent Mate Attacks Photographer\u2019. It\u2019s what they want. They want a scene. They want a reaction. Anything but anger, mate. Anger is currency for them. Don\u2019t give them anything.\u201d The lesson, learned in a high-rise hotel room from a cynical rival, was now being put to use on a Mooloolaba beach. He had learned the rules of their game, and rule number one was that emotional honesty was ammunition they would use against you.\n\nThey packed up their gear in silence, the easy camaraderie of the morning gone, replaced by a tense, hunted feeling. The sacred space had been violated, the sanctuary breached. The walk back along the shoreline was not a peaceful stroll but a tactical retreat. Liam felt the unseen lens on his back with every step, a phantom touch that made his skin crawl. He kept his head down, his shoulders hunched, his face a neutral mask. He was performing again, performing \u2018unbothered\u2019, a role that was just as exhausting as performing \u2018heartbroken\u2019. The joy of being home was rapidly being replaced by the familiar claustrophobia of being a specimen under a microscope. He had run all this way only to find himself in a slightly larger, sunnier laboratory.\n\nBack in the house, he pulled the blinds closed, shutting out the bright, beautiful day. His mother watched him, her face etched with a helpless anger. The house no longer felt like a fortress; it felt like a bunker. He knew this wasn't sustainable. He couldn't spend the rest of his life hiding in the dark, peeking through the curtains, waiting for the vultures to get bored and fly away. They wouldn\u2019t. The story was too good. He had to do something, but he couldn\u2019t fight them on their terms. Lashing out was a loss. Silence was a loss; it allowed them to write whatever story they wanted. He felt utterly checkmated, trapped between a narrative he didn't write and a silence that would be filled with lies. He slumped onto the couch, the weight of his impossible situation pressing down on him.\n\nHe sat there for a long time, the silence of the dim room punctuated by the ticking of a clock on the wall. He thought of Rex\u2019s cynicism, of Eleanor\u2019s wisdom, of his mother\u2019s fierce, protective love. He had run from the noise, but the story had followed him. He couldn\u2019t outrun it. He couldn\u2019t fight it. What was left? He looked across the room and saw his guitar case leaning against the wall. It wasn't an instrument of torture anymore. It wasn't a prop. It was a tool. His tool. The only one he had left. They had taken his voice and used it to tell their story. The only way to win wasn't to stop singing. It was to sing a song they couldn't co-opt, a story they couldn't twist. His own. Not a cover, not an interpretation, but a song born here, in this room, out of this impossible situation. He wouldn't be their Broken Artist or their Troubled Star. He would be a songwriter. He stood up, crossed the room, and unclasped the latches on the case. The war wasn't over. It was just entering a new, quieter, and far more dangerous phase.",

It was in the air, a fine, gritty mist that coated your tongue and worked its way into the seams of your clothes. It crusted on the windows of the beachfront caf\u00e9 where Liam poured a hundred flat whites a day, his Bachelor of Marketing degree a bitter joke curled up in a cardboard tube under his bed. The glare off the Coral Sea was a physical force, a relentless, shimmering sheet of white that made you squint your life away. Some people called it paradise. To Liam, it was a beautiful cage. A waiting room with a spectacular view.\n\nHis phone lay face up on the stainless-steel counter, next to a slurry of spilled milk and coffee grounds. It hadn\u2019t buzzed, chirped, or otherwise acknowledged its own existence in the past hour, an hour during which Liam had mentally replayed his final audition performance at least fifty times. He\u2019d sung \u2018Hallelujah\u2019, a choice his mate Jake had called \u2018braver than a one-legged man in an arse-kicking contest\u2019. The judges had stood up. Even the hard-faced one, the one who looked like his soul had been surgically replaced with a lump of coal, had cracked a smile that was less a smile and more a brief, terrifying glimpse of his dental work. They\u2019d loved him. They\u2019d said he had a voice that could \u2018heal the sick and raise the dead\u2019. But that was a week ago. A lifetime. In the brutal, compressed reality of television, a week was an eternity. The silence from Sydney was a growing, monstrous thing.\n\n\u201cOi, dreamer. Table four wants another one of your swamp-waters.\u201d The voice belonged to Mel, the caf\u00e9 owner, a woman whose face was a roadmap of every bad decision she\u2019d ever made, most of them involving the sun and cheap cigarettes.\n\nLiam flinched, snapping back to the hiss of the steam wand. \u201cComing.\u201d He wiped the counter with a sour-smelling rag, his eyes flicking back to the phone. Nothing. The screen was a black mirror reflecting his own anxious face. Twenty-three years old, a piece of paper that said he was qualified for a life he didn\u2019t want, and a voice that felt like a secret weapon with a faulty trigger. He\u2019d been singing since he could talk, serenading the gulls on Mooloolaba beach, belting out tunes in the shower until the hot water ran cold. It was the only thing that felt real, the only part of him that wasn't just going through the motions. This X-Factor thing\u2026 it wasn\u2019t just a contest. It was a jailbreak.\n\nHe frothed the milk, the high-pitched scream of the machine a decent match for the one in his own head. He poured it into the cup, his hand attempting a wobbly fern. It came out looking more like a distressed ghost. He sighed, sliding the cup onto a saucer. Another masterpiece. As he turned to take it to the table, his phone buzzed. Not a polite little notification buzz. This was a full-body, rattling convulsion against the steel.\n\nThe cup clattered back onto the counter, spilling a tidal wave of brown liquid. Mel yelled something from the kitchen. Liam didn't hear her. His heart was a frantic drum against his ribs. The screen lit up. Blocked Number. It was always a blocked number. His hand was shaking so badly he almost swiped the call away. He jammed the green icon.\n\n\u201cHello?\u201d His voice was a reedy squeak. He cleared his throat. \u201cHello?\u201d\n\n\u201cIs this Liam Harrison?\u201d A woman\u2019s voice, crisp and bored, filtered through the speaker. The sound of a hundred other important calls being made in the background.\n\n\u201cYes. Speaking.\u201d\n\n\u201cLiam, it\u2019s Brenda May from Syco Productions.\u201d\n\nThe world went into slow motion. A fly buzzed lazily near the sugar packets. The clatter from the kitchen faded into a dull roar. Brenda May. He knew the name. She was the show\u2019s puppet master, the executive producer whose name appeared in the credits for a fraction of a second but who held the fates of every hopeful in her immaculately manicured hands.\n\n\u201cRight. Hello,\u201d he managed, trying to sound casual, like he got calls from TV producers every day.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve made our decision regarding the final three,\u201d she said, her tone flat, giving nothing away. \u201cThe panel was\u2026 divided on the last spot.\u201d\n\nOh, God. Here it came. The polite letdown. *Thanks for coming, you were great, just not what we\u2019re looking for this year, feel free to queue for eight hours again next year.* He could already feel the hope draining out of him, leaving a familiar, hollow ache.\n\n\u201cBut Simon\u2019s a big fan of the \u2018surfer-boy-with-the-voice-of-an-angel\u2019 narrative,\u201d she continued, the words dripping with a cynicism that could curdle milk. \u201cIt tests well with the 18-to-35 female demographic. Congratulations, Liam. You\u2019re in the final. A car will pick you up at 0800 tomorrow. Pack for two weeks. Don\u2019t be late.\u201d\n\nAnd then, a click. The line was dead.\n\nLiam stood frozen, the phone still pressed to his ear, listening to the dial tone. He looked at the spilled coffee, at the fly, at the faded posters of surf competitions on the wall. Nothing had changed. And everything had. A laugh bubbled up from his chest, a strange, hysterical sound. He was in. He was in the final. He slammed the phone down on the counter and let out a whoop that rattled the sugar shakers and made the tourists at table four jump.\n\n\u201cWhat the hell is wrong with you, Harrison?\u201d Mel screeched, poking her head out of the kitchen.\n\n\u201cI quit!\u201d he yelled, a giddy, reckless grin spreading across his face. \u201cI bloody quit!\u201d\n\nThe flight to Sydney was a jarring transition from one world to another. He left behind a tearful, proud mother who\u2019d pressed a hundred dollars into his hand and told him to \u2018show those city slickers what a Mooloolaba boy can do\u2019. He left behind Jake, who\u2019d hugged him hard at the tiny Sunshine Coast airport and whispered, \u201cDon\u2019t come back, mate. Not until you\u2019ve won the whole bloody thing.\u201d He left behind the familiar, humid embrace of the coast, the smell of salt and hot pavement, the caw of gulls.\n\nHe landed in a world of grey steel, cold glass, and air that tasted of exhaust fumes and ambition. The car that picked him up was a black town car with tinted windows, the kind of vehicle he\u2019d only ever seen in movies. He felt like an imposter, a kid in fancy dress, his worn-out jeans and surf-brand t-shirt screamingly out of place. The driver, a burly man who didn\u2019t say a word the entire trip, dropped him outside a towering hotel in the city centre, a monolith of reflective windows that seemed to swallow the sky.\n\nThe lobby was an exercise in sterile opulence. White marble floors, chrome fixtures, art on the walls that looked expensive and meaningless. A woman with a clipboard and a headset intercepted him before he could even reach the check-in desk.\n\n\u201cLiam Harrison?\u201d she asked, her smile tight and professional. \u201cI\u2019m Sarah, one of the production assistants. We\u2019ve got you on floor 22. All the finalists are on the same floor. Keep you all together. Makes it easier for the camera crews.\u201d\n\nCamera crews. Right. He\u2019d forgotten about that part. The constant surveillance. Life in the fishbowl.\n\nSarah led him to a dedicated lift, her heels clicking an efficient rhythm on the marble. \u201cYour schedule is on the tablet in your room. Vocal coaching at ten, choreography at one, media training at three. We\u2019re filming your \u2018arrival\u2019 segment in an hour, so get settled, maybe look a bit overwhelmed and grateful. It plays well.\u201d\n\nHis room was bigger than his entire apartment back home. A king-sized bed with a mountain of pillows, a floor-to-ceiling window with a terrifyingly beautiful view of the sprawling city, and a bathroom that looked like it had been stolen from a design magazine. On the bed lay a pile of new clothes\u2014branded tracksuits, t-shirts, and a hoodie, all with the X-Factor logo emblazoned on them. His new uniform. A part of the machine.\n\nHe was just unpacking his own meagre belongings when there was a sharp knock at the door. He opened it to find a guy leaning against the doorframe, a picture of effortless cool. He was tall, with artfully messy dark hair, teeth that were too white to be natural, and a confident smirk that seemed to be his default expression.\n\n\u201cLiam, right? The coastal kid?\u201d the guy said, his voice smooth as silk. He extended a hand. \u201cRex Vance. Great to finally meet the competition.\u201d\n\nLiam shook his hand. Rex\u2019s grip was firm, practiced. A salesman\u2019s handshake. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s me. Good to meet you, too.\u201d He recognised him from the audition shows. Rex was the Sydney native, the one with the slick pop-R&B style and the sob story about a sick grandmother that Liam suspected was at least 50% fabricated for the cameras.\n\n\u201cHeard your audition,\u201d Rex continued, his eyes scanning Liam\u2019s room, taking in the cheap duffel bag and worn guitar case. \u201cThat whole raw, emotional thing. Smart angle. Very authentic.\u201d The way he said \u2018authentic\u2019 made it sound like a carefully chosen marketing strategy. \u201cMe, I\u2019m more about the performance. The spectacle. People want a star, you know? Not just a voice.\u201d He clapped Liam on the shoulder, a gesture that was meant to seem friendly but felt more like a sizing-up. \u201cAnyway, welcome to the snake pit. Just remember, there\u2019s only one crown.\u201d He winked, then sauntered off down the hallway, leaving Liam with a faint, unsettling feeling, like he\u2019d just been pleasantly threatened.\n\nA moment later, a smaller, much more flustered figure appeared in the doorway. It was Chloe, the sixteen-year-old country girl from Tamworth with the powerhouse voice and the stage fright so bad she almost fainted during her first audition.\n\n\u201cOh, hi,\u201d she said, clutching a notebook to her chest. \u201cWas that Rex?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe one and only,\u201d Liam said with a wry smile.\n\n\u201cHe told me my \u2018farm-girl charm\u2019 was a real asset but that I needed to work on my 'brand synergy',\u201d she said, her brow furrowed in confusion. \u201cI don\u2019t even know what that means.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he does either,\u201d Liam laughed, and for the first time since landing, he felt a genuine sense of connection. Chloe\u2019s bewildered honesty was a welcome antidote to Rex\u2019s polished insincerity.\n\n\u201cYour view is amazing,\u201d she said, peering past him into the room. \u201cAll I can see is a brick wall and a pipe.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s\u2026 a lot,\u201d he said, looking out at the endless grid of lights and concrete. The city stretched out below them, a vast, glittering, indifferent beast. It was a long way from the gentle curve of Mooloolaba bay. He felt a pang of homesickness, sharp and sudden. He thought of his mum, probably just finishing her shift, wiping down the sticky tables at the surf club. He thought of the familiar constellations he could see from his bedroom window. Out here, the city lights bleached the sky, erasing the stars. He was in the final. It was everything he\u2019d ever wanted. And he had never felt more alone. He took a deep breath, the refrigerated air stinging his lungs. He had to win. There was no going back now."

They talked for a few minutes in the hallway, their voices hushed, conspiratorial. She told him about her family\u2019s sheep farm, the pre-dawn starts, and how singing to the hills was the only way to make the loneliness bearable. He told her about the endless horizon of the Coral Sea, the rhythm of the tides, and the feeling of singing with a lungful of salt air. They were from opposite ends of the country, from landscapes that couldn't be more different, yet they recognised in each other the same fundamental truth: they were singers, not performers. They were voices trapped in ordinary lives, now suddenly thrust into an extraordinary, terrifying spotlight.\n\nTheir quiet conversation was shattered by the return of Sarah, the PA, who clapped her hands together with a brisk, cheerless efficiency. \u201cAlright, lovebirds, time to make the magic happen. Liam, you\u2019re first. We\u2019re doing your arrival shot. We\u2019ll get you walking down the hallway, looking awestruck, then you\u2019ll enter your room and be, you know, blown away by the view. We\u2019ve already got B-roll of you looking pensively out the window.\u201d Liam stared at her. B-roll? They had been filming him already? He felt a prickle of violation, the unnerving sense that his life was no longer his own, but a collection of clips to be edited together for maximum emotional impact.\n\nThe next hour was one of the most surreal of his life. A two-man camera crew, a sound guy with a long, furry boom mic, and a director named Gaz who wore a backwards baseball cap and spoke in a stream of baffling industry jargon, crowded into the hallway. \"Okay, Liam, mate, action!\" Gaz commanded. \"Walk towards me. Slow it down. Think 'kid in a candy store'. Your whole life has led to this moment. More wonder! Give me more wonder!\" Liam tried to look wondrous. He felt like a complete idiot, acutely aware of Rex leaning against his own doorway down the hall, watching the whole charade with an amused smirk. \"Cut!\" Gaz yelled. \"A bit wooden, mate. Let's go again. This time, as you walk, I want you to touch the wall, like you can't believe it's real. Feel the texture. Connect with the space.\" Liam touched the wall. It felt like a wall.\n\nAfter four takes of him walking down a hallway, they moved into his room. \u201cOkay, now the window,\u201d Gaz directed. \u201cGo to the window, look out, and just\u2026 react. Give me that \u2018Wow, a simple boy from a small town overwhelmed by the big city\u2019 vibe. That's your narrative. Stick to it.\u201d Liam looked out the window. It was the same view he\u2019d been looking at for the last hour. He tried to dredge up the initial awe, but all he felt was a hollow sense of fakery. \u201cCan you maybe say something?\u201d Gaz prompted. \u201c\u2018Wow\u2019, or \u2018This is insane\u2019, something organic.\u201d Liam took a breath. \u201cWow,\u201d he said, his voice flat. \u201cThis is insane.\u201d Rex, still watching from the hall, let out a soft chuckle. The director sighed. \u201cWe\u2019ll fix it in post.\u201d\n\nVocal coaching was a relief, a return to solid ground. The coach was a woman in her late sixties named Eleanor Vance, whose stern expression and severe grey bun did little to hide the sharp intelligence in her eyes. She wasn\u2019t affiliated with the show, but was a legendary figure in the Sydney music scene, a guru who had trained opera singers and rock stars alike. The studio was a small, soundproofed room, free of cameras and production assistants. It felt like a sanctuary.\n\nEleanor didn't waste time with pleasantries. \u201cAlright, Mr. Harrison. The producers are selling you as the raw, untamed talent. Let\u2019s see if there\u2019s any truth in the marketing. Give me a major scale. A cappella.\u201d Liam, relieved to be doing the one thing he was confident in, sang. The notes filled the small room, clear and strong. Eleanor closed her eyes, listening not just to the pitch but to the texture, the breath, the intent behind the sound. She had him run through arpeggios, test the top and bottom of his range, and sing passages in different volumes. She didn't praise him. She just listened, her expression unreadable.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve never had a lesson in your life, have you?\u201d she finally stated, opening her eyes. \u201cNo,\u201d Liam admitted, a knot of anxiety tightening in his stomach. \u201cIt shows,\u201d she said, and his heart sank. \u201cYour technique is a mess. You\u2019re singing from your throat on your high notes, your breath support is inconsistent, and you hold tension in your jaw. In six months of a heavy performance schedule, you\u2019d tear your vocal cords to shreds.\u201d She paused, letting the clinical assessment hang in the air. \u201cBut,\u201d she continued, a flicker of something new in her gaze, \u201cyou have something I can\u2019t teach. It\u2019s a rare quality. A direct line from your heart to your voice. There\u2019s no filter. No artifice. It\u2019s honest. That\u2019s why they stood up. Don\u2019t ever let them train that out of you.\u201d She then spent the next hour giving him a series of breathing exercises, tools not to change his voice, but to protect it. It was the first time all day anyone had spoken to him about something real.\n\nThe feeling of groundedness evaporated the moment he stepped into the dance studio. It was a vast, mirror-walled room, bright and intimidating. The choreographer, a man named Rico who was impossibly lean and vibrated with a hummingbird\u2019s energy, was leading Rex and Chloe through a series of sharp, complex moves. Rex moved with a lazy, practiced grace, every step hitting the beat perfectly. He was born for this. Chloe, on the other hand, was a mess of flailing limbs and frantic concentration, her face a mask of pure panic. Liam felt a surge of sympathetic terror.\n\n\u201cAh, the surfer has arrived!\u201d Rico trilled, clapping his hands. \u201cLet\u2019s see if you have more rhythm than a bucket of sand. Five, six, seven, eight!\u201d He launched into a sequence of steps, pivots, and arm gestures that made Liam\u2019s brain short-circuit. He stumbled, turned the wrong way, and nearly collided with a flushed and mortified Chloe. Rex, without missing a beat, glided around him, a look of pitying amusement on his face. \"It's about selling it, man,\" Rex offered, not unkindly, as they took a water break. \"Even if you mess up the steps, you just have to look like you meant to do it. Confidence is its own choreography.\" Liam nodded, wiping sweat from his brow, but the advice didn't help. He wasn't an actor. He couldn't just \"sell it.\" He was a singer who stood still. Here, in this room of mirrors reflecting his every clumsy failure, he felt like a fraud all over again. The voice that could \u2018heal the sick and raise the dead\u2019 was useless if he couldn\u2019t even master a simple two-step."

The voice that could \u2018heal the sick and raise the dead\u2019 was useless if he couldn\u2019t even master a simple two-step.\n\nThe media training session was held in a bland, windowless conference room that smelled of stale air conditioning and corporate desperation. The trainer, a woman named Diana with aggressively red lipstick and a blazer with shoulders so sharp they could cut glass, paced in front of them like a panther sizing up three very clumsy mice. She wielded a whiteboard marker like a weapon.\n\n\u201cYour story is your brand,\u201d she announced, her voice so crisp it seemed to have been ironed. \u201cAnd your brand is your product. We are not selling a voice. We are selling a feeling, an aspiration, a narrative. You are no longer people; you are concepts. Got it?\u201d Chloe looked like she was about to cry. Rex leaned back in his chair, looking bored, as if this was all remedial work for him. Liam felt a familiar sense of dread.\n\nDiana turned to Chloe first. \u201cChloe. You are \u2018The Humble Farm Girl\u2019. Every answer you give filters through that lens. They ask you about the pressure? You compare it to lambing season. They ask about the city? You talk about how you miss the stars. Never, ever say you want to win. You\u2019re just \u2018so grateful for the opportunity to share your music\u2019.\u201d She scribbled \u2018HUMBLE. GRATEFUL. FARM.\u2019 on the whiteboard.\n\nNext, she pivoted to Rex. \u201cRex. You are \u2018The Prodigal Son\u2019. You\u2019ve had a taste of the industry, you\u2019ve been knocked down, but now you\u2019re back, more polished, more determined. You\u2019re the professional. Confident, but with a hint of a hidden wound\u2014the grandmother story is gold, use it. Your brand is \u2018Redemption and Polish\u2019.\u201d She wrote \u2018POLISHED. DRIVEN. REDEMPTION.\u2019 next to his name. Rex gave a small, self-satisfied nod.\n\nFinally, her laser-like gaze fell on Liam. \u201cAnd you. The \u2018Surfer-Boy-Saviour\u2019. The raw talent plucked from obscurity. You are the diamond in the rough.\u201d She circled Liam\u2019s name on the board. \u201cYour narrative is \u2018Authenticity\u2019. You are pure, untainted by the industry. You\u2019re not here for the fame, you\u2019re here for the music. It\u2019s all about the *feeling*, Liam. When a journalist asks you a question, I want you to look slightly pained, like you\u2019re dredging the answer up from the very depths of your soul.\u201d She paused, tapping the marker against her chin. \u201cAnd for God\u2019s sake, stop saying \u2018um\u2019. It\u2019s not authentic, it\u2019s just amateur. Replace it with a thoughtful pause.\u201d She wrote \u2018AUTHENTIC. SOULFUL. RAW.\u2019 on the board.\n\nThe session descended into a painful role-play. Diana fired mock interview questions at them. Rex was flawless, weaving his narrative into every answer with practiced ease. Chloe stumbled, her genuine shyness coming across as exactly what Diana wanted. When Diana asked Liam what his biggest weakness was, he answered honestly. \u201cChoreography. I can\u2019t dance to save my life.\u201d Diana\u2019s red lips tightened. \u201cNo. Wrong. Your biggest weakness is that you sometimes care *too much*. You get so lost in the emotion of the song that you forget everything else. See the difference? One makes you sound clumsy, the other makes you sound like a tortured artist.\u201d Liam felt a piece of himself shrivel up and die. This wasn\u2019t a jailbreak; it was just a different kind of cage, one with prettier bars and a much bigger audience.\n\nThat evening, the three of them were summoned to a suite on the top floor, a vast, impersonal space with panoramic views of the glittering city lights. Brenda May, the executive producer, was waiting for them. She was flanked by Gaz, the director, and a handful of other serious-looking people in dark suits. The air crackled with a forced, high-stakes energy. This was a scene for the show. A camera crew lurked in the corner, capturing their every nervous glance.\n\n\u201cWelcome, finalists,\u201d Brenda said, her voice smooth and vaguely menacing. \u201cThe hard work starts now. Each week, one of you will be going home. Your first live show is in six days. The theme\u2026\u201d she paused for dramatic effect, her eyes sweeping over them, \u201cis \u2018Guilty Pleasures\u2019.\u201d A low groan escaped Chloe. Rex smirked; this was his territory. Liam\u2019s mind went blank. What was his guilty pleasure? Listening to his mum's ABBA Gold CD?\n\nBrenda handed each of them a sealed manila envelope. \u201cYour songs have been chosen for you. Chosen to showcase your strengths and, in some cases, to test your limits. Your journey starts with this song. Don\u2019t screw it up.\u201d Her smile didn't reach her eyes. They were dismissed. Back in the hallway, the temporary truce of media training was gone. They were competitors again, each clutching a potential lifeline or a death sentence.\n\nChloe tore hers open immediately, her face falling as she read the paper inside. \"Oh, no,\" she whispered, looking horrified. \"They've given me 'I Believe in a Thing Called Love' by The Darkness.\" The thought of the shy country girl attempting the falsetto screech and glam-rock swagger of the song was both tragic and absurd. Rex opened his with a flourish. He laughed, a short, sharp bark of triumph. \"Perfect. 'Toxic' by Britney Spears. The stripped-back, acoustic version, of course. Sexy. Dark. Very on-brand.\" He winked at Liam. \"What'd they stick you with, beach boy? Something by Jack Johnson?\"\n\nLiam\u2019s hands felt clammy as he unsealed the envelope. He pulled out the single sheet of paper. His eyes scanned the title and his blood ran cold. It wasn\u2019t a soulful ballad. It wasn\u2019t a classic rock anthem he could belt out. It was a song he knew, a song everyone knew, but one he would never have chosen in a million years. Printed in bold, black letters were the words: \u2018Call Me Maybe\u2019 by Carly Rae Jepsen. He stared at it, a wave of nausea rolling over him. It was a frothy, bubblegum pop song. It was everything he wasn't. It was a joke. He could feel Rex\u2019s eyes on him, could almost hear the un-spoken mockery. They weren\u2019t looking for a diamond in the rough. They were looking for a clown.\n\nHe escaped to his room, the piece of paper feeling like a condemnation in his hand. He slumped onto the edge of the ridiculously large bed, the sprawling city lights outside the window seeming to mock him with their cold, indifferent sparkle. He thought of Eleanor Vance\u2019s words: *A direct line from your heart to your voice. Don\u2019t ever let them train that out of you.* How was he supposed to find the heart in \u2018Call Me Maybe\u2019? It felt like a deliberate act of sabotage, a test designed to make him fail, to expose him as the one-trick pony they probably thought he was. He was the surfer boy with the soulful voice, and they\u2019d handed him a plastic bucket and spade.\n\nHis phone buzzed on the nightstand. It was a text from his mum: *Saw the first promo on TV tonight!!! You looked so handsome. We\u2019re all so proud of you, lovey. The whole town is behind you! XOXO*. A fresh wave of panic, mingled with a profound sense of homesickness, washed over him. The whole town. He wasn't just Liam Harrison, the barista with a dream, anymore. He was Liam Harrison, Mooloolaba's great hope. And they were going to watch him get on a national stage and completely humiliate himself. He picked up his guitar, the familiar weight of it a small comfort. He strummed a few chords, a mournful, minor-key progression. He tried to sing the opening line of the song. \u201cI threw a wish in the well\u2026\u201d The words felt alien in his mouth, sugary and meaningless. He stopped, pressing his forehead against the cool wood of the guitar. He had to find a way. He had to dismantle the song, break it down to its bones and find something, anything, real inside it. If he couldn't, this dream would be over before it even began."

                                        "text": "For two days, the song was his tormentor. It followed him from the sterile hotel room to the cacophonous group rehearsals, a relentlessly cheerful earworm with vapid lyrics that felt like a personal insult. He tried to practice it, standing in front of the mirror in his room, but the words tasted like ash in his mouth. \u201cHey, I just met you, and this is crazy\u2026\u201d He sounded like he was reading a grocery list. There was no connection, no heart, no truth. It was a performance, a lie, and every time he sang it, he could feel Diana\u2019s condescending voice in his head, praising his \u2018authenticity\u2019. He was supposed to be the soulful one, and they had handed him a piece of musical plastic.\n\nHe skipped the group dinner on the second night, feigning a headache. He couldn\u2019t stand another minute of Rex\u2019s preening or the production assistants\u2019 false bonhomie. He needed to be alone. He sat on the floor of his room, his back against the bed, his old guitar across his lap. The city lights outside were a cold, distant nebula. He felt utterly lost, a million miles from the salty air and warm sand of home. He thought about quitting. The thought was a brief, sweet relief. He could be on a bus tomorrow, back to Mooloolaba, back to Mel and her sour rags and the comforting hiss of the coffee machine. Back to being a failure with a marketing degree under his bed. The relief soured instantly. Jake\u2019s words echoed in his head: *Don\u2019t come back, mate. Not until you\u2019ve won.*\n\nWith a sigh of resignation, he decided to try a different approach. He wouldn\u2019t try to sing the song. He would dissect it. He wrote the lyrics out on a piece of hotel stationery, staring at them as if they were a coded message. He ignored the melody he knew, the bouncy synth-pop arrangement that was welded to the words. What was left? A story. A simple, almost painfully vulnerable one. It wasn\u2019t about a confident pickup line. It was about the terrifying, reckless moment of seeing something you want and throwing all your cards on the table. It was about the hope and the fear and the chance of utter humiliation. *Here\u2019s my number. So call me, maybe.* The \u2018maybe\u2019 was the key. It was the entire song. It was the insecurity, the whispered prayer at the end of a desperate plea.\n\nHe put his fingers to the fretboard, not aiming for a familiar chord, but just searching for a sound that matched the feeling. He found a minor chord, then another, creating a progression that was melancholic and full of longing. He slowed the tempo way down, letting the space between the notes breathe. He began to sing again, not the lyrics, but the story he had found inside them. His voice was quiet, almost a whisper. \u201cI threw a wish in the well, don\u2019t ask me I\u2019ll never tell\u2026\u201d It was no longer a flippant opening line; it was a confession. The melody he was building was sparse, haunting. It was the sound of a late-night phone call, of a heart laid bare. The \u2018crazy\u2019 in \u201cthis is crazy\u201d wasn\u2019t giddy; it was genuinely unhinged, the craziness of taking a huge, life-altering risk. He had taken a risk. He had stood on a stage in front of a million people and sung \u2018Hallelujah\u2019. He had quit his job, left his home, and thrown his whole life at this one, single chance. The song wasn't about a girl anymore. It was about him. It was the most authentic thing he could possibly sing.\n\nThe next morning, he booked an extra session with Eleanor Vance, using the excuse that he was struggling with his breath control. He walked into her sound-proofed sanctuary, his guitar case in one hand and a knot of nerves in the other. He didn\u2019t say a word, just sat on the stool, took a deep breath, and played his version of the song. He kept his eyes closed, pouring all the frustration, the homesickness, and the flicker of defiant hope into the performance. When he sang the final \u201cSo call me, maybe?\u201d the last word hung in the air, fragile and unresolved. He let the final chord ring out and then the silence in the room was absolute. He was terrified to open his eyes. He was sure she would hate it. That she would tell him he\u2019d butchered a pop classic and to stick to the script.\n\nWhen he finally dared to look at her, Eleanor\u2019s severe expression was gone. In its place was a look of intense, focused curiosity, like a geologist who had just cracked open a boring rock to find a flawless crystal inside. She was quiet for a long moment, her fingers steepled under her chin. \u201cThe producers gave you that song, didn\u2019t they?\u201d she asked, her voice soft. Liam nodded, unable to speak. \u201cThey were testing you,\u201d she said, a faint, knowing smile playing on her lips. \u201cThey wanted to see if you were a jukebox or an artist. They wanted to see if you\u2019d break.\u201d She stood up and walked over to the piano. \u201cYou held the last note a little flat. Nerves. And you need to support the breath more on the chorus, or it will sound weak, not vulnerable. But the arrangement\u2026\u201d she looked at him, her gaze direct and powerful. \u201cThe arrangement is why you are here. It\u2019s honest. Now, don\u2019t let them take it from you.\u201d\n\nBuoyed by Eleanor\u2019s approval, a new kind of resolve hardened in Liam\u2019s gut. He found Chloe later that day, huddled in a corner of the communal lounge, looking miserable. She was listening to The Darkness on her headphones, a textbook on musical theory open on her lap. \u201cI just don\u2019t get it,\u201d she lamented, pulling the earbuds out. \u201cIt\u2019s so\u2026 loud. And he\u2019s singing about things I can\u2019t even imagine. I feel like I\u2019m in a costume, and it\u2019s three sizes too big.\u201d Liam sat down beside her. \u201cForget the costume,\u201d he said, remembering his own breakthrough. \u201cWhat\u2019s the song about, really?\u201d Chloe looked confused. \u201cI dunno\u2026 a thing called love?\u201d she offered weakly. \u201cNo, underneath that,\u201d Liam pressed. \u201cIt\u2019s about being so completely overwhelmed by a feeling that it\u2019s all you can think about. It\u2019s totally over the top and a bit ridiculous, right? Have you ever felt that way about something?\u201d Her eyes lit up with sudden understanding. \u201cSinging,\u201d she whispered. \u201cWhen I get on a stage and it\u2019s going well\u2026 it feels like that. Like I could fly.\u201d Liam smiled. \u201cSo don\u2019t sing his story. Sing yours.\u201d\n\nThe battle came during the first full band rehearsal. The session musicians were pros, capable of playing anything put in front of them, but they had the sheet music for the original version of \u2018Call Me Maybe\u2019. Gaz, the director, was there, along with Rico, the choreographer, who was already planning some high-energy, synchronized moves. \"Alright, Liam, let's see what you've got!\" Gaz called out from the control booth. \"Give us some of that beach-boy charm!\" Liam took a deep breath. \u201cActually,\u201d he said, his voice steadier than he expected. \u201cI\u2019m doing a different arrangement.\u201d He walked the bemused musical director through the new chord progression. The band started to play, hesitantly at first, then with a growing sense of interest as the mournful, folk-inflected melody took shape. Liam sang, his voice filling the studio, his version of the song silencing the usual backstage chatter.\n\nWhen he finished, there was a stunned pause. Then Gaz\u2019s voice crackled through the speakers, dripping with irritation. \u201cWhat the hell was that? A funeral dirge? It\u2019s \u2018Guilty Pleasures\u2019 week, Harrison, not \u2018I\u2019m Very Sad and Deep\u2019 week. It\u2019s supposed to be fun, upbeat. People are supposed to tap their feet, not call a suicide hotline.\u201d Rico nodded in agreement. \u201cI can\u2019t choreograph to that. What\u2019s he supposed to do? Stand there and look pained?\u201d Rex, who had been watching from the side of the stage, let out a condescending laugh. \"Told you, man,\" he said, loud enough for Liam to hear. \"It's a TV show. Entertain them.\" The band looked at Liam, awaiting their instructions, their faces neutral. He could feel his resolve wavering. It would be so easy to give in, to sing the song they wanted, to do the stupid dance moves and just get through the week.\n\nBut then he remembered Eleanor\u2019s face. He remembered the feeling of finding the truth in the song. And he remembered Diana, the media trainer, and her talk of his brand. He took the microphone. \u201cDiana told me my brand was \u2018Authenticity\u2019,\u201d he said, his voice echoing slightly in the large room, directing his words at the glass of the control booth. \u201cShe said it was all about the feeling, about being raw and soulful. Well, this is it. This is my authentic version. Singing it the other way would be a lie. And it wouldn\u2019t be very good. This,\u201d he said, gesturing to the band, \u201cis the only way I can do it.\u201d Gaz was silent for a moment. There was a frantic, muffled conversation in the booth. Liam\u2019s heart hammered against his ribs. He had called their bluff. He had used their own manufactured nonsense against them. Finally, Gaz\u2019s voice came back, tight with annoyance. \u201cFine. Whatever. Do your depressing little song. But if you get voted off, it\u2019s on you. Don\u2019t come crying to us.\u201d Liam let out a breath he didn\u2019t realize he\u2019d been holding. He\u2019d won. For now."

                                        "text": "The walk back to the hotel was charged with a strange new electricity. Rex fell into step beside him, his usual smirk replaced by a look of clinical assessment. He didn't seem angry, merely\u2026 analytical. \u201cBold move, Harrison,\u201d he said, his voice a low murmur, just for Liam. \u201cFighting the machine. Very rock and roll. Hope it pays off for you. The public doesn\u2019t usually vote for a downer, no matter how \u2018authentic\u2019 it is. They want to forget their crappy week, not be reminded of yours.\u201d He clapped Liam on the shoulder again, the gesture feeling less like a threat this time and more like a warning from a seasoned veteran to a naive rookie. \u201cGood luck,\u201d he added, and it almost sounded sincere.\n\nChloe, however, was practically vibrating with vicarious courage. She caught up to him in the hotel lobby, her eyes wide. \u201cThat was amazing,\u201d she breathed, clutching her notebook like a shield. \u201cWhat you did in there. You just\u2026 told them. I\u2019ve never seen anyone talk to Gaz like that.\u201d Liam shrugged, a flush of heat creeping up his neck. \u201cI didn\u2019t really have a choice,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was either that or make a complete fool of myself.\u201d Chloe shook her head, a flicker of an idea dawning in her expression. \u201cNo, it was a choice,\u201d she insisted. \u201cYou chose to be good instead of obedient.\u201d The observation hung between them, simple and profound. It was the first time Liam had thought of it that way.\n\nThe next few days were a blur of managed chaos, a crash course in the art of being a television product. They were woken at dawn by camera crews wanting to film them being \u2018natural\u2019 over breakfast. They were shuttled from wardrobe fittings, where Liam was put in a succession of artfully distressed jeans and plain, dark t-shirts, to sound checks and lighting rehearsals. Rico, the choreographer, treated Liam with theatrical disdain. \u201cOkay, Mr. Soulful,\u201d he\u2019d sigh dramatically. \u201cYour stage is there. Your stool is there. You will walk to the stool. You will sit on the stool. Try not to look like you\u2019re waiting for a bus. That is your choreography. Thrilling.\u201d Liam accepted the ridicule. A stool was more than he could have hoped for; it was an anchor, a small island of stillness in the hurricane of the live show.\n\nTwo days before the show, he was summoned to Brenda May\u2019s office. The room was sleek, white, and cold, high in the sky, making him feel like he was being judged from on high. There were no cameras this time. Brenda sat behind a vast glass desk, her posture immaculate. \u201cYou were very bold at rehearsal, Liam,\u201d she said, her voice a flat, polished stone. \u201cIt makes for good television. A contestant fighting for his art. The sensitive soul against the heartless machine. Very dramatic.\u201d She paused, tapping a perfectly manicured finger on the glass. \u201cBut do not mistake a good story for a guaranteed spot in the final. The narrative can always be reframed. \u2018The arrogant boy who got too big for his boots and was humbled by the public vote\u2019 also tests very well. Remember that.\u201d It was a masterclass in manipulation, a compliment wrapped around a threat. She was giving him the rope to either climb or hang himself, and making it clear she was happy to film either outcome.\n\nThe night of the live show arrived with the force of a physical blow. The backstage area was a maelstrom of frantic energy, a sensory overload of shouting stagehands, the chemical smell of hairspray, and the palpable thrum of thousands of people in the audience on the other side of the wall. Liam felt sick. He sat on a crate in a dim corner, trying to do the breathing exercises Eleanor had taught him, but the air felt too thick to draw in. He was dressed in his uniform of contrived authenticity: dark jeans, a simple grey t-shirt. He watched Rex, across the room, getting a final touch-up on his makeup. Rex was electric, thriving on the chaos, his eyes gleaming with competitive fire. He was wearing a ridiculously sharp leather jacket, the embodiment of his \u2018Polished Redemption\u2019 brand. Chloe was pacing back and forth, pale under her stage makeup, twisting the hem of the sparkly dress they\u2019d put her in.\n\nShe saw Liam and came over, her hands freezing cold when she briefly gripped his arm. \u201cI\u2019m going to throw up,\u201d she whispered, her voice trembling. \u201cI can\u2019t do it. A rock song? In this dress? I look like a disco ball had a fight with a scarecrow.\u201d Liam managed a weak smile. \u201cHey. Just sing your story, remember? About how it feels. Forget the dress, forget the noise. Just find one person in the crowd and sing it to them.\u201d He wasn\u2019t sure if he was advising her or himself. She nodded, unconvinced, but the pacing stopped. A text buzzed on his phone. It was Jake. *Saw your odds online. You\u2019re the long shot to win tonight. Prove em wrong, mate. Mooloolaba is watching.* The pressure felt like a physical weight on his chest. Long shot. Of course he was.\n\n\u201cTwo minutes, Liam!\u201d a PA with a headset yelled, her voice tight with stress. This was it. The walk from the relative quiet of the backstage area to the wings of the stage felt like the longest journey of his life. The roar of the audience grew from a muffled rumble to a deafening, visceral force. Bright, hot lights blinded him as he peeked around the curtain. The stage looked enormous, a vast, glittering expanse. In the center, a single stool and a microphone stand looked terrifyingly small and exposed. He saw the judges at their long, glowing desk, their faces projected onto huge screens. He saw the sea of faces in the audience, a shifting, anonymous mass. Gaz was right. It was a party. And he was about to sing a funeral dirge. The jaunty, upbeat theme music for the show blasted through the speakers, and a wave of pure, undiluted panic washed over him. *What have I done?* he thought, his blood turning to ice. *Rex was right. They want to be entertained, not depressed. I\u2019m going to crash and burn in front of the entire country.*\n\nThe show\u2019s host, a man with teeth as white and perfect as Rex\u2019s, was bellowing his introduction. \u201c\u2026plucked from a sleepy surf town, with a voice that stunned the nation! The judges said he was the real deal, but with a controversial song choice, has he gambled too much, too soon? Please welcome\u2026 Liam Harrison!\u201d The roar of the crowd was a physical impact. A stagehand gave him a shove. \u201cGo, go, go!\u201d And he was walking, his legs feeling like they belonged to someone else. He didn\u2019t dare look at the audience, keeping his eyes fixed on the stool. He clutched his guitar, the wood of the neck slick with sweat in his palm. He reached the center of the stage, sat down, and adjusted the microphone. The lights were hot, the silence after the applause deafening. He could hear the blood pounding in his ears.\n\nHe took a breath. And then another, deeper one, remembering Eleanor. *Support the breath.* He looked up, past the blinding lights, into the vast darkness where the audience sat. He couldn't see them, but he could feel them. He wasn't thinking about the votes, or the judges, or Brenda May\u2019s threat. He thought of the caf\u00e9, of the endless, beautiful cage. He thought of the phone call that had changed his life. This was his jailbreak. This was the moment. He found his first chord, the melancholic minor sound cutting through the charged silence. He began to sing, his voice quieter than anyone expected. \u201cI threw a wish in the well\u2026\u201d\n\nAt first, the room was confused. There were scattered whispers, a sense of anticlimax. This wasn't the song they knew. But Liam kept his eyes shut, retreating into the story he had built. He sang of the vulnerability, the desperate hope, the gut-wrenching fear of rejection. The arrangement built slowly, his voice swelling from a near-whisper on the verses to a full, aching cry on the chorus. He wasn't performing. He was testifying. As he reached the final, stripped-back line, \"So call me, maybe?\", he opened his eyes, letting his gaze fall on the judges\u2019 table. He sang the last word not as a flippant invitation, but as a fragile question mark, his voice trailing off into the vast, silent arena. For a full three seconds after the last chord faded, there was nothing. No sound. Just the hum of the lights and the collective held breath of two thousand people. Liam\u2019s heart stopped. He had failed. And then, the room exploded. It wasn't just polite applause; it was a roar, a standing ovation that washed over him in a wave of sound and emotion. People were on their feet, some were even wiping their eyes. The hard-faced judge, the one with the soul of coal, was standing, his hands clasped together, nodding slowly, a look of profound shock and respect on his face. Liam looked out, dazed, and saw that the host, the PA\u2019s, even the camera operators were clapping. He had done it. He had taken the most disposable piece of pop music imaginable and turned it into a moment of art. He had made them listen."

He sat frozen on the stool, the warmth of the lights turning his skin clammy, the ghost of the final chord still vibrating through the wood of his guitar. And then the sound hit him. It wasn't a clap; it was a detonation, a tidal wave of noise that seemed to lift him from the stool. It was the sound of thousands of people getting to their feet, their applause a raw, unified roar. He looked up, blinking against the glare, and saw the impossible: the entire arena, a churning sea of cheering silhouettes, was standing for him. For his sad, broken little version of a bubblegum pop song.\n\nThe host, a man usually composed of witty segues and flawless smiles, looked genuinely stunned. He let the applause thunder for a moment longer before stepping forward, his voice filled with a new, unscripted respect. \"Wow,\" he said, the single word amplified to fill the cavernous space. \"Just... wow.\" He turned to the judges' table. \"Marcus? I don't think I've ever seen this room react like that.\" The camera zoomed in on the hard-faced judge, the man Liam had privately nicknamed \u2018The Undertaker\u2019. Marcus leaned into his microphone, his expression severe, but his eyes held a flicker of something that looked like awe. \"I'll be honest, Liam,\" he began, his gravelly voice silencing the room. \"When I saw your song choice on my sheet, I wrote you off. I thought it was arrogant, or stupid, or both. I was sharpening my knives.\" He paused, letting the tension build. \"I have never been so happy to be so wrong. What you did tonight wasn't a cover. It was an autopsy. You ripped the chest open on a manufactured, plastic song and found a real, beating, broken heart. That wasn't a performance; it was a confession. That was artistry.\"\n\nThe other judges were a chorus of ecstatic praise. They lauded his bravery, his musical intelligence, his vulnerability. Words like \u2018game-changer\u2019 and \u2018defining moment\u2019 were thrown around like confetti. Liam could barely process them. He mumbled his thanks, his brain a static-filled haze, and stumbled off the stage into the wings, his guitar feeling impossibly heavy. The moment he was out of sight, the world shifted. The production assistant who had yelled at him to \u2018go\u2019 now handed him a bottle of water with a reverence usually reserved for visiting royalty. Crew members he\u2019d never spoken to gave him solemn nods and pats on the back. He had walked onto that stage as a contestant. He walked off as a contender.\n\nHe found Chloe in the buzzing chaos of the green room. She was next. Her face was pale, a mixture of terror and sheer, unadulterated awe. \u201cLiam,\u201d she whispered, grabbing his arm. \u201cHow\u2026 how am I supposed to follow that?\u201d Her sparkly dress seemed to mock her fear. He looked at her, seeing his own panic from thirty minutes ago reflected in her wide eyes. \"You don't follow it,\" he said, his voice hoarse. \"You do what we talked about. You sing your story. Not his, not mine. Yours.\" He squeezed her hand. \"You told me it feels like you could fly. So fly.\" A PA called her name. She gave Liam one last, terrified look, took a deep breath that seemed to pull in all the courage in the room, and walked towards the stage.\n\nLiam watched on a monitor, his own heart pounding a frantic rhythm for her. She walked out, looking small and fragile under the huge lights. When the opening chords of the raucous rock song began, she flinched. She sang the first verse, her voice tight and reedy, her eyes squeezed shut. Liam\u2019s stomach clenched. She was going to crash. Then, as the first chorus hit, something shifted. She opened her eyes, not looking at the judges or the cameras, but up towards the cheap seats in the back. A different energy took over. She wasn\u2019t trying to be a swaggering rock star anymore. She was the girl from the hills, singing her heart out. The song became a joyful, defiant roar, a country-rock explosion of pure, unbridled passion. She transformed the swagger into exuberance, the screech into a joyful yodel of release. By the end, she was beaming, the sparkly dress no longer a costume but a beacon, and the crowd, caught up in her infectious joy, gave her an ovation almost as loud as Liam\u2019s.\n\nRex was the last of their trio to perform. He had watched both Liam\u2019s and Chloe\u2019s triumphs on the monitor, his confident smirk slowly tightening into a rigid line. The two raw, authentic acts had completely reset the emotional temperature of the room. He was the consummate professional, but for the first time, that felt like a liability. He strode onto the stage, a vision of urban cool in his leather jacket, and launched into his version of \u2018Toxic\u2019. It was, by any technical measure, perfect. His voice was flawless, his intricate guitar work was impressive, and his stage presence was magnetic. He oozed star quality. The performance was sleek, seductive, and intensely rehearsed. But it felt like watching a beautiful, expensive car drive by behind a pane of glass. You could admire the craftsmanship, but you couldn't feel the engine.\n\nThe judges\u2019 comments reflected the subtle shift. They praised him, but the language was different. They used words like \u2018polished\u2019, \u2018professional\u2019, and \u2018marketable\u2019. Marcus, The Undertaker, nodded thoughtfully. \"Rex, you're a star. There's no question. You look like one, you sound like one, you perform like one. It was a ten out of ten performance.\" He paused. \"But tonight, I'm not sure a ten was enough.\" The comment, though couched in praise, landed like a stone. Rex\u2019s smile didn\u2019t falter, but a flicker of something cold and furious entered his eyes. He had done everything right, and somehow, he had been outmanoeuvred by a sad-sack surfer and a star-struck farm girl.\n\nAn hour later, all twelve finalists were lined up on stage. The air was thick with the cheap perfume of manufactured tension. Liam stood between Chloe and Rex, a bizarre island of shared experience. Chloe was trembling slightly, but a new steeliness was in her gaze. Rex stood perfectly still, his face a mask of cool indifference, but Liam could see the muscle jumping in his jaw. The host began the ritual, announcing the names of those who were safe, one by one. The relief on each face was stark and immediate. Liam\u2019s name was the third one called. A wave of dizziness washed over him as he let out the breath he\u2019d been holding. The host said his name again, reminding him to step forward. He did, catching Chloe\u2019s eye. She gave him a tiny, proud smile. Her name was called two announcements later. She visibly sagged with relief, and her hand found his for a brief, grateful squeeze.\n\nThe line of contestants thinned. Soon, there were only four left, standing in a small, miserable huddle under the glare of the lights. And Rex was one of them. The front-runner, the professional, the one who was meant to be untouchable, was in the bottom four. The host milked the moment, his voice a dramatic purr as he announced the next person safe. It wasn\u2019t Rex. Liam watched his competitor\u2019s face. The mask was cracking. The cool confidence had evaporated, replaced by a raw, naked humiliation. This wasn't part of his brand. This wasn't in his narrative. This was real. Finally, with only two contestants left, the host called the name of the person going home. It wasn\u2019t Rex. The girl beside him burst into tears as her dream ended on national television. Rex was safe. But as he walked, stiff-backed, to join the others, he looked utterly defeated. The crowd had voted, and their message was clear. Polish was good. Professionalism was admirable. But tonight, they had voted for heart. And Rex Vance, for all his talent, had been found wanting."

                                        "text": "The comedown was slower and stranger than the ascent. Back in the green room, a chaotic space now stratified by the invisible lines of success and failure, Liam was no longer just a contestant. He was an event. People who had looked through him hours earlier now sought his eye, offering tight, professional smiles and murmurs of \"killer performance.\" Sarah, the PA, who had previously herded him like livestock, now asked if he needed anything with a deferential tilt of her head. He was handed a tablet showing the overnight social media metrics. His name was trending nationally. The clip of his performance was rocketing towards a million views. It was all abstract, a series of numbers and graphs that had no connection to the shaking in his hands or the hollow, echoing space in his chest where the panic used to be.\n\nHe saw Rex across the room, surrounded by his own small team of stylists and hangers-on who now looked deeply uncomfortable, unsure of the correct etiquette for consoling a star whose shine had just been demonstrably tarnished. Rex wasn't speaking to any of them. He was staring at a monitor showing a replay of his own performance, his face a mask of cold, intellectual fury. He was dissecting his failure, frame by frame, searching for the flaw in the code. As Liam watched, Rex\u2019s eyes lifted and met his across the crowded room. There was no congratulations in that gaze. There was no anger, either. It was something far more chilling: recognition. It was the look a predator gives a rival who has just stolen its kill, an acknowledgment of a new and dangerous variable in the ecosystem. Rex gave a slow, deliberate nod, then turned and walked out, his entourage scrambling to follow in his wake.\n\nChloe found him a moment later, her face scrubbed of makeup, her sparkly dress exchanged for one of the generic X-Factor tracksuits. The giddy relief had been replaced by a quiet, shared sense of shock. They escaped the noise, finding refuge in a deserted corridor that smelled of disinfectant and old dust. \"Did that really happen?\" she whispered, leaning against the wall, the question aimed at the universe. Liam could only shake his head, the roar of the crowd still a phantom ringing in his ears. \"I think so,\" he said. \"Your song\u2026 you were incredible.\" She blushed, a real, un-televised blush. \"I just did what you said,\" she admitted. \"I sang my story. I thought about shearing sheep, oddly enough. The feeling of finishing the last one before a storm rolls in. That feeling of racing the clock and winning.\" He laughed, a real laugh, the first one that day that didn't feel choked by anxiety. In that sterile hallway, far from the cameras and the judges, they were just two singers from opposite ends of the country who had survived their first storm.\n\nSleep was impossible. Liam lay in his king-sized bed, the city lights painting silent, shifting patterns on the ceiling, his mind replaying every note, every word, every roar of the crowd. He was no longer the anonymous barista. He was now \u2018Liam Harrison: The Artist.\u2019 It felt like a costume he had been forced to wear, one that might be more difficult to remove than the \u2018Surfer-Boy-Saviour\u2019 tag had been. At six a.m., his phone rang. It was his mum, her voice thick with tears. \u201cOh, lovey,\u201d she sobbed. \u201cWe watched it at the surf club. The whole place. When you finished, you could have heard a pin drop, and then Mel, of all people, stood up on a table and started cheering. The whole town is going absolutely bonkers. You did it, Liam. You really did it.\u201d He closed his eyes, the simple, unvarnished pride in her voice a balm on his frayed nerves. He was doing this for them, too. The thought was both a comfort and a terrifying weight.\n\nThe shift in the machine\u2019s attitude was immediate. The next morning, Liam was summoned not by Gaz or Sarah, but by Brenda May herself. Her office was just as he remembered, a minimalist temple of power overlooking the city. This time, however, her smile seemed almost genuine. \u201cCongratulations, Liam,\u201d she said, gesturing for him to sit. \u201cYou created a moment. And moments are our currency.\u201d She leaned forward, the cynicism back in her eyes. \u201cThe network loves you. The public loves you. \u2018The tortured artist who finds beauty in the trash.\u2019 It\u2019s a fantastic narrative. Your authenticity is rating through the roof.\u201d The way she said \u2018authenticity\u2019 made it sound like a brand of yogurt. \u201cSo, this week, we\u2019re going to lean into it.\u201d\n\nShe slid a single sheet of paper across the vast glass desk. \u201cThis week\u2019s theme is \u2018Movie Night\u2019.\u201d Liam\u2019s stomach tightened. He scanned the paper. It was a list of huge, iconic movie ballads. Bombastic, orchestral, emotionally manipulative songs that were the polar opposite of his sparse, intimate style. \u201cWe\u2019ve assigned you \u2018I Don\u2019t Want to Miss a Thing\u2019,\u201d Brenda said, naming the Aerosmith power ballad from the movie *Armageddon*. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the biggest-selling rock ballads of all time. The public adores it. We want you to do your thing to it. Strip it down. Make it your own. Make them cry again. Don\u2019t disappoint us.\u201d She smiled, a clear, sharp message in her eyes. It was not a request. He was no longer the rebel fighting the system; he was the system's new, prized racehorse, and they were pointing him at the next jump. The freedom he had fought for was already becoming a gilded cage.\n\nHe left her office feeling more confused than triumphant. He had won the right to be himself, only to be ordered to mass-produce that self on command. As he stepped out of the lift into the finalists\u2019 lobby, Rex was there, leaning against a pillar, as if waiting for him. The cold fury from the night before was gone, replaced by a conspiratorial, almost friendly smirk. \u201cJust had your victory meeting with the puppet master?\u201d he asked, his voice smooth. \u201cLet me guess. She told you how brilliant you are and that your authenticity is your superpower, and now she wants you to do it again, on cue, with some overblown piece of corporate rock.\u201d Liam stared at him, surprised by the accuracy. Rex chuckled. \u201cI\u2019ve been in this business a long time, Harrison. I know how it works. They build you up, create a narrative, and then they bleed it dry. Last night, you weren\u2019t an artist; you were a plot twist. A very effective one, I\u2019ll admit. But what happens next week when you can\u2019t pull another rabbit out of the hat?\u201d\n\nRex pushed himself off the pillar and stepped closer, lowering his voice. \u201cYou think they want you to be authentic? They want you to be predictably authentic. They want to bottle your little sad-boy lightning and sell it. You fought them and won, and now they\u2019ve put you in charge of your own cage. Last night was a fluke. A perfect storm of a bad song choice and a good idea. You can\u2019t do that every week. Sooner or later, you\u2019ll have to sing the song, do the dance. Sooner or later, you\u2019ll have to become a professional. And I\u2019ll be there when you do.\u201d He patted Liam\u2019s shoulder, the gesture now laden with a complex mix of pity and condescension, and walked away, leaving Liam reeling. The words were a poison, expertly crafted to find the cracks in his newfound confidence. *It was a fluke.* The thought burrowed deep into his mind, a seed of doubt that began to sprout immediately.\n\nDesperate for an antidote, he found his way back to Eleanor Vance\u2019s studio. The small, quiet room felt more like a sanctuary than ever. He explained the situation: the new song, Brenda\u2019s directive, Rex\u2019s insidious warning. He played her the opening chords of the Aerosmith song, his fingers fumbling, the melody feeling bloated and cartoonish. \u201cI can\u2019t find it,\u201d he said, his voice laced with frustration. \u201cThere\u2019s no \u2018maybe\u2019 in this song. There\u2019s no vulnerability. It\u2019s just yelling. I can\u2019t find the truth in it.\u201d Eleanor listened patiently, her severe expression unwavering. When he was finished, she didn\u2019t offer comforting words. She was a teacher, not a therapist. \u201cOf course you can\u2019t find it,\u201d she said bluntly. \u201cYou are looking for the same truth you found last time. You are trying to repeat a discovery. That is not art; that is manufacturing. That is what the producer wants. It is what your rival expects.\u201d\n\nShe stood and walked to her old, upright piano. \u201cLast week, the truth was in the insecurity. The plea. This song,\u201d she played a few of the powerful, anthemic chords, letting them hang in the air, \u201cis not a plea. It is a declaration. It is the opposite emotion. Its truth lies in its absolute, unwavering certainty.\u201d She looked at Liam, her eyes sharp. \u201cDo not try to make it small and sad. That would be a lie. It would be a gimmick. Your challenge this week is not to find the broken heart. It is to find a reason to sing with a whole one. To find something, or someone, you feel so strongly about that you could genuinely stand on a mountaintop and scream it to the world without a hint of irony.\u201d She stopped playing. \u201cYour authenticity is not a style, Mr. Harrison. It is not a minor key. It is the act of telling the truth with your voice. The truth simply changes from week to week. Find it.\u201d He looked down at his hands, at his guitar, and then back at her. Rex had tried to poison him with doubt. Eleanor had just handed him the antidote: a new, far more difficult, and infinitely more honest path forward. He had to find something worth screaming for."

                                        "text": "Eleanor\u2019s words were a compass, but Liam was still lost in the woods. For two days, he wrestled with the song, and the song, a behemoth of 90s power-rock sincerity, wrestled him back and pinned him every time. He tried to follow her advice, to search for a truth of unwavering certainty, but his life felt like a landscape of doubt. Certainty was a luxury he\u2019d never been able to afford. He sat in his room, the branded X-Factor guitar feeling like a prop in his hands, and tried to sing the chorus. His voice came out thin and ironic, a hollow imitation of Steven Tyler\u2019s iconic rasp. It was a joke. He sounded like a kid playing dress-up in his dad\u2019s rock-and-roll clothes. Rex\u2019s words slithered into his thoughts, a venomous whisper: *It was a fluke. They want you to be predictably authentic.* He was trying to do just that, to find the feeling on command, and the well was dry. The more he tried to force it, the more fraudulent he felt.\n\nDefeated, he put the guitar down and walked to the floor-to-ceiling window. The city sprawled below, a relentless grid of ambition and indifference. He felt a pang of homesickness so sharp it was almost a physical pain. On impulse, he picked up his phone and called his mum. She answered on the second ring, the familiar sound of the surf club\u2019s clatter in the background. She didn't talk about the show or the competition. She told him about her day. She told him that Mel had actually smiled at a customer, an event she ranked somewhere between a solar eclipse and the second coming. She told him that Jake had fixed the wobbly leg on her favourite table. She told him about the sunset she had watched after her shift, the way the sky had turned a violent, beautiful shade of orange and purple, bleeding into the deep blue of the Coral Sea. \u201cIt was one of those ones, lovey,\u201d she said, her voice soft with the memory. \u201cOne of those ones that makes you stop what you\u2019re doing and just\u2026 look. Makes you glad you\u2019ve got eyes in your head.\u201d\n\nAfter he hung up, Liam stood in the silent, air-conditioned room, his mother\u2019s words painting a vivid picture in his mind. He closed his eyes, and he wasn't in a Sydney hotel room anymore. He was standing on the headland at Mooloolaba, the salt spray cool on his face, the familiar cry of the gulls sharp in the humid air. He saw the sunset his mum had described, the vast, perfect curve of the bay, the endless shimmer of the water stretching to a horizon that held no judgment, only possibility. He felt a surge of emotion so powerful it almost buckled his knees. It wasn't love for a person. It was a fierce, primal love for a place. For home. For the feeling of the sand under his feet and the salt on his tongue. For the quiet, unassuming life he had been so desperate to escape, a life that now seemed like the only real thing in a world of chrome and mirrors. He didn\u2019t want to miss a thing. Not a single grain of sand, not a single shade of blue in the evening tide. He never wanted to forget that feeling.\n\nHe picked up the guitar again, his fingers finding the opening chords of the song. This time, he didn't try to make them quiet or sad. He played the big, anthemic power chords as they were written, but he filled them with that feeling, that ache of fierce, protective love for his corner of the world. He started to sing, his voice no longer thin or ironic. He was not singing to a lover, begging them not to fall asleep. He was singing to his own memory, commanding it to stay. *I could stay awake just to hear you breathing* became a line about listening to the rhythm of the waves on the shore. *I don\u2019t want to close my eyes, I don\u2019t want to fall asleep, \u2018cause I\u2019d miss you, babe, and I don\u2019t want to miss a thing.* It was a hymn to home. A desperate, powerful declaration that no matter how far this new life took him, he would not let it erase the boy who sang to the gulls on Mooloolaba beach. He wasn\u2019t stripping the song down; he was building it up, giving its bombast a foundation of real, raw, heartfelt truth. Eleanor was right. He had found something worth screaming for.\n\nThe band rehearsal was a tense affair. Gaz, the director, watched from the booth with a look of impatient expectation. \u201cAlright, Harrison, show us the magic,\u201d his voice crackled over the intercom, dripping with sarcasm. \u201cLet\u2019s see the sad, stripped-down version of the stadium rock anthem. Should be a real crowd-pleaser.\u201d Liam ignored him. He turned to the musical director, a seasoned pro named Dave, and spoke quietly for a moment. \u201cWe\u2019re doing it as written,\u201d he said. \u201cFull band. Just follow me on the dynamics.\u201d Dave raised a skeptical eyebrow but nodded to the band. They launched into the iconic opening, the sound big and full in the studio. Liam took a deep breath, closed his eyes for a second to picture that sunset, and sang.\n\nWhat came out was not the angsty rasp of Steven Tyler, nor the whisper of his \u2018Call Me Maybe\u2019 performance. It was a new voice, his own voice, filled with a power and clarity that surprised everyone, including himself. He wasn\u2019t performing rock and roll; he was leading a secular prayer. He embraced the song\u2019s theatricality, the soaring chorus, the dramatic pauses. He wasn\u2019t hiding behind his guitar; he was using it as a conduit for a feeling so big it couldn't be contained in a minor key. When the final, massive chorus hit, he stepped away from the microphone, his eyes open and blazing, and let his voice fill the room without amplification, a raw, desperate cry of pure emotion that was more powerful than any special effect. He held the final note until his lungs burned, the band crashing to a halt around him.\n\nThe silence that followed was different from the week before. It wasn't stunned awe; it was profound confusion. The band members looked at each other, then at Liam, their professional detachment broken by expressions of sheer shock. In the control booth, Gaz was speechless, staring at the mixing desk as if it had betrayed him. This wasn\u2019t the product he had ordered. This wasn\u2019t \u2018Liam\u2019s brand\u2019. This was something else, something wilder and less predictable. And from the side of the stage, where he\u2019d been watching with a cynical smirk, Rex Vance\u2019s expression slowly changed. The smirk faded, the condescension evaporated. It was replaced by a look of cold, hard calculation. He had predicted Liam would fail to repeat his trick. He had been right. He just never imagined that Liam would have another, entirely different, and arguably more powerful one, up his sleeve. The coastal kid wasn't a fluke. He was a moving target."

                                        "text": "The silence that followed the final crash of the band was heavy and profound, a thick blanket laid over the studio. Liam stood panting slightly in the center of the stage, the adrenaline a high-frequency hum beneath his skin. He had given everything to the song, a full-throated, desperate declaration, and now in the echoing quiet, he felt utterly exposed. The band members exchanged wide-eyed, unreadable glances, their professional composure momentarily fractured. In the control booth, Gaz was leaning forward, his mouth slightly agape, staring not at Liam but at the glowing soundboard as if it had just recited epic poetry. The expected rebuke, the sarcastic dismissal of his choice, never came. Instead, the studio audience, which had been whipped into a frenzy by the song\u2019s power, slowly, almost thoughtfully, got to their feet, their applause rolling towards the stage not with the explosive shock of the week before, but with the deep, rumbling power of a gathering storm.\n\nAt the judges\u2019 table, the mood was equally transformed. The usually effervescent female judge was dabbing at the corner of her eye with a tissue, her critique a single, breathy, \u201cLiam, that was church.\u201d But all eyes were on Marcus. The Undertaker leaned back in his chair, his steepled fingers tapping against his lips as he regarded Liam with a new, unsettling intensity. \u201cI am rarely surprised, Liam,\u201d he said, his voice a low growl that commanded absolute silence. \u201cBut twice in two weeks is\u2026 unprecedented.\u201d He leaned forward, the camera zooming in on his craggy, serious face. \u201cLast week, you performed a magic trick. You took a piece of plastic and turned it into glass. It was clever. It was artful. This,\u201d he gestured to the stage, \u201cwas not a trick. This was an act of raw, terrifying power. You didn\u2019t deconstruct that song; you possessed it. You took a monument and made it a living, breathing thing. You\u2019re not just a singer, son. You\u2019re becoming a force of nature. And frankly, I\u2019m not sure whether to be thrilled or terrified.\u201d\n\nBackstage was a blur of disorienting respect. The shift was complete. Liam was no longer the underdog, the lucky amateur who had pulled off a clever stunt. He was the front-runner, the one to beat, and the air around him had changed, charged with a mixture of awe and fear. People didn\u2019t just look at him anymore; they watched him, as if expecting him to spontaneously combust or levitate. He found Chloe by the catering table, where she was nervously stirring a cup of tea. She had delivered a beautiful, heartfelt rendition of a Joni Mitchell song, earning warm praise and a safe passage to the next week, but she looked at Liam as if he had returned from another planet. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t a song, Liam,\u201d she said quietly, her eyes searching his. \u201cThat was\u2026 something else. It felt like you were going to tear the roof off the building with your voice. It\u2019s like you\u2019re getting further and further away from the rest of us.\u201d Her words, meant as a compliment, landed like a small, sharp stone, reminding him of the growing distance between the person he was and the phenomenon he was becoming.\n\nThe most unnerving encounter came just before the live results show. Liam was in a quiet corner, trying to steady his breathing, when Rex appeared beside him, moving with a silent, predatory grace. The calculating fury of the week before had been replaced by a serene, almost philosophical detachment. He held two bottles of water, offering one to Liam. \u201cAn impressive display of firepower, Harrison,\u201d Rex said, his voice a low, confidential murmur. \u201cYou\u2019ve successfully convinced them all that you\u2019re a prophet. The tortured voice of a generation, screaming his truth from the mountaintop.\u201d He took a slow sip from his bottle. \u201cBut you should read your history. Prophets have a tendency to end up crucified. The public loves a martyr, but only after they\u2019re gone.\u201d Liam just stared at him, unsure how to respond to the bizarre, backhanded compliment.\n\n\u201cYou see, you think you won,\u201d Rex continued, his tone patient, as if explaining a complex theorem to a child. \u201cBut Brenda and the network won more. Last week you were a novelty. This week you\u2019re an addiction. And they are the dealers. They\u2019ll keep demanding more truth, more soul, a bigger piece of you every week, until there\u2019s nothing left to give. You\u2019re not an artist to them, you\u2019re a natural resource to be strip-mined.\u201d He leaned in closer, his voice dropping to a near-whisper. \u201cI, on the other hand, am a performer. It\u2019s a job. I give them a polished product, a reliable return on their investment. I keep my soul in a safe deposit box where they can\u2019t get to it. You\u2019re laying yours out on the table every week for them to feast on. Let\u2019s see who has more to give by the end.\u201d Rex straightened up, his friendly mask back in place. \u201cJust some professional advice. Good luck tonight.\u201d With a final, chillingly pleasant smile, he walked away, leaving Liam with a mouthful of ashes and the cold, dawning horror that every word Rex had said was probably true.\n\nThe results show felt like a foregone conclusion. Liam and Chloe were waved through early, their names met with thunderous applause. The real drama swirled around the contestants in the middle of the pack, the ones who were good but not great, professional but not phenomenal. Rex, who had delivered a technically brilliant but emotionally sterile version of a classic rock song, was also declared safe, though the applause for him was noticeably more polite. He accepted it with a gracious nod, his eyes briefly meeting Liam\u2019s with a look that said, *See? The professional survives.* The contestant who went home was a sweet, forgettable boy-band type who had simply failed to make an impression. As he sang his tearful farewell song, Liam felt a surge of empathy. The boy wasn\u2019t a bad singer; he just hadn\u2019t been able to give the machine the story it craved. He had been a product with no brand.\n\nThe remaining contestants were gathered on stage, exhausted and emotionally drained, when the giant screen behind them flickered to life. Brenda May\u2019s face appeared, magnified to the size of a small car, her smile sharp and predatory. \u201cCongratulations, finalists,\u201d she said, her voice echoing through the studio. \u201cYou have survived another week. But the challenges will only get harder. The public expects more from you now. And so do we.\u201d Her eyes seemed to settle on Liam. \u201cTherefore, this week\u2019s theme will be \u2018Judges\u2019 Choice\u2019. Each judge will select a song for one of you. A song they feel will be the ultimate test of your artistry, your versatility, and your courage. There will be nowhere to hide.\u201d\n\nA nervous murmur went through the contestants. This was the ultimate act of producer manipulation, disguised as an honour. The judges began their announcements. The first judge gave Chloe a classic, heart-wrenching Patsy Cline ballad, a perfect fit for her voice that would allow her to shine. The second judge assigned Rex a complex, theatrical Queen number, a challenge that played directly to his strengths in showmanship and vocal precision. Rex accepted with a confident, almost arrogant, nod. This was his arena. Finally, all eyes turned to Marcus. He stood, his imposing figure silencing the room. He looked directly at Liam, his expression unreadable.\n\n\u201cLiam,\u201d Marcus began, his voice a low rumble. \u201cIn three weeks, you have proven to be a master of reinterpretation. You deconstructed disposable pop. You reconstructed epic rock. You find new truth in unexpected places. But the greatest test for an artist is not what they can bring to a flawed song, but whether they can stand in the presence of perfection.\u201d He paused, letting the weight of his words settle. \u201cCan you bring your truth to a song that is already one of the most truthful ever written? A song so simple, so pure, and so iconic that it offers no room for tricks, no place to hide, and no forgiveness for failure?\u201d The screen behind him displayed the song title, the two words landing with the force of a physical blow. *Yesterday. The Beatles.* Liam stared at the screen, a cold wave of dread washing over him. It was a song he had known his entire life. It was beautiful. It was perfect. And it was an impossible trap. He couldn\u2019t tear it down. He couldn\u2019t build it up. It was a poisoned chalice, handed to him by the one judge who seemed to understand him best, a challenge designed to see if he was truly a force of nature, or just a man who had finally run out of miracles."

It was not a song; it was a cornerstone of Western culture, a piece of music so deeply embedded in the collective consciousness that it felt less like a composition and more like a naturally occurring element, like water or air. The audience, sensing the monumental nature of the challenge, erupted in a cacophony of cheers and gasps. On stage, Liam felt the blood drain from his face. Marcus hadn't thrown him a lifeline. He had handed him an anchor and told him to fly. The other contestants looked at him with a mixture of pity and awe, as if he had just been nominated for a suicide mission. Even Chloe\u2019s supportive smile couldn't hide the fear in her eyes. It was a perfect song, and his entire brand was built on fixing imperfections. He was a house renovator who had just been handed the Mona Lisa and told to \u2018make it his own\u2019.\n\nFor the next three days, Liam was a ghost haunting the 22nd floor. The song became his tormentor, a gentle melody that held the menace of a loaded gun. He sat with his guitar, the familiar chords feeling alien under his fingers. He played the simple, descending progression, a masterpiece of elegant sorrow, and it mocked him. There was nothing to add, nothing to take away. He tried to sing it, but his voice felt like a clumsy forgery. He was Paul McCartney\u2019s karaoke singer. The lyrics, so clear and direct, offered no secret doors, no hidden meanings to exploit. It was a story of a love suddenly and inexplicably gone, a lament for a time when life was easy. What truth could he possibly bring to it that wasn\u2019t already there? The song didn\u2019t need him. He was a parasite on a perfect host.\n\nHis frustration curdled into a quiet, simmering panic. He saw Rex in the hallways, looking infuriatingly relaxed. Rex was working on his Queen song, a flamboyant explosion of theatricality that was perfectly suited to his style. He\u2019d whistle the intricate melody as he passed Liam in the hall, a casual, cutting display of his own comfort zone. \u201cStruggling to improve on perfection, Harrison?\u201d Rex asked one afternoon, his tone laced with faux sympathy as he saw the dark circles under Liam\u2019s eyes. \u201cThat\u2019s the thing about a masterpiece. It doesn\u2019t need your help. Sometimes you just have to admit you\u2019re out of your league.\u201d Every word was a perfect little dart, aimed at the heart of Liam\u2019s insecurity. He was right. Liam was out of his league, and the whole country was about to watch him drown.\n\nHe finally sought refuge in Eleanor\u2019s studio. The soundproofed walls felt like a fortress against the mounting pressure. He didn\u2019t even say hello, just walked in, sat on the stool, and played the song, his performance stiff and lifeless. He finished and looked at her, his face a mask of desperation. \u201cI can\u2019t do it,\u201d he said, his voice cracking. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing here for me. It\u2019s a perfect song. There are no flaws to find, no heart to uncover. It\u2019s already there. Anything I do to it will just make it worse. It\u2019s a trap.\u201d Eleanor listened, her expression as still and unmoving as a granite statue. She let the silence hang for a long moment after he finished his defeated tirade, letting his words evaporate into the quiet of the room.\n\n\u201cYou are a fool, Mr. Harrison,\u201d she said at last, her voice devoid of any warmth. The bluntness of it startled him. \u201cYou come in here looking for a trick. A new arrangement. A clever hook. You are still thinking like a mechanic. Marcus did not give you a puzzle to solve. He gave you a mirror.\u201d She stood up and walked towards him, her presence more imposing than ever. \u201cStop trying to change the song. The song is immutable. It is you who must change. You think the song is about a lost lover? Perhaps. But for you, what is your yesterday? What is the easy game that you can no longer play? What have you lost that you now need a place to hide away from?\u201d She was so close he could see the fine lines around her sharp, intelligent eyes. \u201cDo not perform this song. Do not interpret it. You must stand on that stage and let it pass through you. It is the purest test of the 'direct line' we once spoke of. If you have any art in you at all, you will not need to find the truth. The truth will find you.\u201d\n\nHer words struck him like a physical blow. He left the studio in a daze, her questions echoing in his head. *What is your yesterday?* He went back to his room, but instead of picking up the guitar, he just stood by the window, looking down at the endless, glittering expanse of Sydney. He thought of the person he was just a few weeks ago. The boy who felt trapped by the monotonous rhythm of the tides, by the steam wand hissing, by the sticky film of salt that coated everything. He had yearned for this new life, for the noise and the lights and the feeling of being someone, of being seen. He had it now. He was seen constantly. His every move was documented, his every emotion mined for a narrative. He was no longer a person; he was a concept, a brand, a story being told by other people. His love had been a simple, easy game. He had sung for the sheer joy of it, for the gulls, for the empty beach at dawn. Now, he sang for ratings, for judges, for a contract.\n\nHe had lost his anonymity. He had lost his simplicity. He had lost the freedom of being no one. And in that moment, staring out at the city that had become his beautiful cage, he was overwhelmed by a profound, aching nostalgia for the life he had so carelessly thrown away. *Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away. Now it looks as though they\u2019re here to stay. Oh, I believe in yesterday.* The lyrics were no longer about a girl. they were about him. The \u2018she\u2019 in *Why she had to go, I don\u2019t know, she wouldn\u2019t say* was his old self, a person who had vanished without warning, leaving this new, anxious, public version of Liam in his place. He suddenly, desperately, missed the boy who poured flat whites and had a useless degree under his bed. He had said something wrong. He had wished his simple life away, and now he was living with the consequences.\n\nAt the final rehearsal, Liam\u2019s request was simple. \u201cNo band,\u201d he told the musical director. \u201cJust a single cello. And I\u2019ll play acoustic.\u201d Gaz\u2019s voice crackled from the control booth, dripping with incredulity. \u201cAre you kidding me? A cello? It\u2019s Saturday night television, Harrison, not a recital at the bloody conservatorium. The song is already a downer. You\u2019re going to put the whole country to sleep.\u201d Liam didn\u2019t argue. He just looked at the musical director, Dave, who had seen his performance the week before. Dave looked back at him, then up at the control booth. \u201cLet\u2019s just try it, Gaz,\u201d he said, a note of quiet authority in his voice. Gaz grumbled, but acquiesced.\n\nLiam sat on the stool, his guitar on his lap. The cellist, a woman with kind, weary eyes, gave him a small, encouraging nod. He closed his eyes, not picturing a sunset this time, but the faded posters on the wall of the Mooloolaba caf\u00e9. He pictured the glint of the sun on the Coral Sea, the sour smell of the rag he used to wipe the counter. He took a breath and began to play, his fingers tracing the familiar chords with a newfound reverence. The cello entered, its voice a deep, mournful sigh that wrapped around the melody of the guitar. And then he sang. He sang without affectation, without any vocal tricks. He simply told the story. His story. His voice was quiet, intimate, laced with a profound and genuine sadness. It wasn\u2019t a performance of melancholy; it was the real thing. He was the man who had woken up to find his world irrevocably changed, who longed for the simple life he had not appreciated until it was gone forever. When he sang the final line, *Oh, I believe in yesterday,* his voice was barely a whisper, a fragile confession breathed into the vast, silent studio. When he finished, no one moved. The cellist had tears silently tracking down her face. In the control booth, Gaz was just staring, his hand hovering over the talk-back button, for once with nothing to say. Liam opened his eyes, feeling hollowed out, empty. He had found the only way to sing the song. He had to bleed."

                                        "text": "The night of the live show felt different. The usual backstage franticness was there \u2013 the shouting, the hiss of hairspray, the frantic energy of a thousand moving parts \u2013 but Liam felt strangely insulated from it, cocooned in a bubble of quiet resignation. He wasn\u2019t nervous, not in the heart-pounding, stomach-churning way he had been before. This was a different feeling, a deep, somber calm, the feeling a person has when they have already accepted the worst possible outcome. He sat on a flight case in a shadowed corner, his guitar resting across his lap, his fingers idly tracing the frets without making a sound. He wasn't preparing to compete; he was preparing for a confession.\n\nChloe was a picture of poised professionalism, her nerves from the early weeks baked away by experience and newfound confidence. Her Patsy Cline song was a perfect vessel for her clear, emotive voice, and she delivered it with a simple, heartbreaking honesty that earned her a warm, sustained ovation. She had found her place, a comfortable and authentic niche that the audience adored. As she came off stage, flushed with success, she gave Liam\u2019s shoulder a supportive squeeze. \u201cYou\u2019ve got this,\u201d she whispered, though her eyes betrayed a hint of worry, as if she knew he was about to venture somewhere she couldn\u2019t follow.\n\nThen came Rex. The opening fanfare of Queen\u2019s \u2018Somebody to Love\u2019 blared through the studio, and he exploded onto the stage in a blaze of theatrical glory. It was a masterclass in performance. He moved with a dancer\u2019s precision, his voice soaring through the complex vocal arrangements, hitting the gospel-choir highs and the rock-and-roll lows with effortless power. He interacted with the backup singers, played to the cameras, and commanded the stage with the absolute authority of a born star. It was flawless, exhilarating, and utterly spectacular. He wasn't just singing a song; he was producing a miniature broadway show in three minutes. The performance ended with him on his knees in a single, dramatic spotlight, and the audience erupted in a frenzy. It was pure, unadulterated entertainment, and Rex had given them everything they could possibly want.\n\nAs the stage crew cleared Rex\u2019s elaborate setup, a profound quiet began to settle over the studio. A single stool was placed in a tight pool of white light. From the shadows, the cellist emerged and took her seat, her instrument looking dark and ancient under the glare. Then Liam walked out. He didn\u2019t look at the audience or the judges. He walked to the stool with a slow, deliberate pace, his worn jeans and simple t-shirt a stark contrast to Rex\u2019s flamboyant costume. The audience was a confused murmur. Where was the band? The spectacle? This felt less like a primetime show and more like a poetry reading.\n\nLiam sat down, adjusted the microphone, and took a breath. He looked at the cellist and gave a single, almost imperceptible nod. She drew her bow across the strings, and a low, mournful note filled the cavernous room, a sound so full of sorrow it seemed to absorb all other noise. Liam began to play, the simple, familiar chords of \u2018Yesterday\u2019 emerging, unadorned and clean. Then he sang. His voice was a near-whisper, an intimate confidence shared with millions. He sang not to the back row, but to the microphone in front of him, as if sharing a secret he could no longer bear to keep. The studio, which had been a rock arena just minutes before, was transformed into a single, quiet room. The audience was so still they seemed to have stopped breathing. The cameras did something they rarely did: they stopped moving, holding tight on Liam\u2019s face, catching the genuine pain in his eyes as he sang of a life he longed for but could never reclaim. The performance was an act of radical stillness, an island of quiet grief in an ocean of noise. When he breathed the final, whispered line, the silence that followed was absolute. It was not the stunned silence of surprise, but the heavy, reverent silence of a sacred space, a silence so profound it felt louder than any applause.\n\nFor a long, uncomfortable moment, no one moved. Then, from high up in the darkness, a single person began to clap, a slow, solitary sound. Another joined in, then another. The applause grew not in a rush, but as a slow, swelling tide of deep, heartfelt respect. It never reached the frenzied roar Rex had received; it was something else, something deeper and more personal, the sound of thousands of people acknowledging a shared, private sorrow. Liam finally looked up, his eyes glassy, appearing dazed and hollowed out by his own performance.\n\nThe host, visibly moved, cleared his throat several times before he could speak. He turned to the judges, who all looked as if they had been holding their breath. \u201cMarcus,\u201d the host said, his voice hushed. \u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t know what to say.\u201d Marcus leaned forward, his face a grim, thoughtful mask. He looked from Liam to Rex, who stood on the side of the stage, his perfect smile now looking like a painted-on facade. \u201cTonight we saw two masters at work,\u201d Marcus began, his voice a low, resonant rumble that seemed to quiet the very air. \u201cRex, what you did was a spectacle. It was a perfect piece of musical theatre, a display of breathtaking skill and showmanship. You gave a command performance. A ten out of ten.\u201d Rex nodded, accepting the praise, but his eyes were fixed on Marcus, waiting for the inevitable \u2018but\u2019.\n\n\u201cAnd then,\u201d Marcus continued, turning his full attention to Liam, \u201cyou came out. Rex\u2019s performance was a coronation. Liam, you invited us to a funeral. His was about the power and the glory of the human voice. Yours was about the fragility and the solitude of the human soul. One was a shout to the heavens, the other was a whisper into the void. I don\u2019t know how the public will vote,\u201d he said, looking directly at Liam with an expression of profound, almost paternal respect. \u201cBut what you just did wasn\u2019t about a competition. That was a work of art. And it was, in its own quiet way, one of the bravest things I have ever seen on this stage.\u201d\n\nThe rest of the judges\u2019 comments were a blur of hushed, emotional praise. Liam felt disconnected from it all, as if he were watching a replay of someone else\u2019s life. He walked off stage feeling not triumphant, but utterly drained, as if he had donated a pint of blood\u2014or a piece of his soul\u2014and was lightheaded from the loss. Backstage, the atmosphere around him was different again. The respect had deepened into something akin to awe. People kept their distance, speaking in hushed tones as he passed, as if he were a grieving relative or a holy man deep in meditation.\n\nHe found Rex by the exit, away from the prying eyes and cameras. The spectacular performer was leaning against a wall, his leather jacket looking like a suit of armour that had failed to protect him. His face, for the first time, was stripped of all artifice. There was no smirk, no condescension. There was only the cold, hard look of a master craftsman who had just watched a shaman conjure real magic. \u201cThat was a dirty trick, Harrison,\u201d Rex said, his voice flat and devoid of its usual silky texture. Liam said nothing. \u201cI put on a perfect show,\u201d Rex continued, more to himself than to Liam. \u201cI did everything right. The vocals, the staging, the energy. That\u2019s what this is supposed to be about.\u201d He finally looked at Liam, a bitter, bewildered understanding dawning in his eyes. \u201cYou didn\u2019t even try to compete, did you? You just bled all over the stage and made them watch. How is anyone supposed to compete with that?\u201d Without waiting for an answer, he pushed himself off the wall and walked out into the night, leaving Liam alone with the chilling realisation that he had finally found a weapon more powerful than talent, more effective than spectacle: his own, genuine, marketable pain."

                                        "text": "The results show was an exercise in slow-motion cruelty. The finalists were arranged on stage under the hot, unforgiving lights, their smiles tight and fragile. Liam stood in a daze, the ghost of his performance still clinging to him like a shroud. The host, with his practiced air of solemnity, began the weekly ritual of salvation and damnation. Liam\u2019s name was the first one called. The announcement was met with a deep, respectful roar from the audience, but he felt nothing\u2014no relief, no joy. He simply stepped forward as instructed, a puppet whose strings were being pulled by a force he no longer understood. Chloe\u2019s name was called soon after, her genuine, beaming smile a bright spot in the suffocating tension.\n\nThe line thinned. The host milked the drama, his pauses stretching into agonizing chasms of silence. Finally, only two contestants remained under the spotlights: a young, effervescent pop singer named Lily, whose talent was dwarfed by her infectious personality, and Rex Vance. A collective gasp went through the studio. Rex, the consummate professional, the pre-ordained star, was in the bottom two. The camera zoomed in on his face, but the mask was back in place. His expression was one of cool, almost bored, indifference. It was a masterful performance of its own, but Liam, watching from the safety of the saved, could see the frantic pulse beating in his throat. This was not part of the narrative. This was a catastrophic systems failure.\n\n\u201cRex, Lily, you will now sing for survival,\u201d the host intoned gravely. Lily went first, her voice trembling as she sang a saccharine ballad, her performance more about tearful pleading than vocal skill. Then it was Rex\u2019s turn. He walked to the center of the stage, not with his usual swagger, but with a quiet, measured tread. He\u2019d chosen a simple, heartbreaking ballad, a song of loss and regret. He sat on a stool, just as Liam had, with a single acoustic guitar. It was a shockingly transparent move, a desperate, calculated attempt to replicate Liam\u2019s formula. He began to sing, his voice, as always, technically flawless. The notes were perfect, the pitch unwavering. He even tried to inject a slight tremor, a manufactured vulnerability into the performance. But it was like watching a master painter try to forge a child\u2019s drawing. All the lines were correct, but the innocent, un-self-conscious heart was missing. He was acting sad. Liam had simply been sad. The difference was immense, and the audience could feel it.\n\nThe final decision fell to the judges. They saved Rex, citing his superior technical ability, but the reprieve was delivered like a sentence. \u201cYou are one of the most gifted vocalists we have ever had in this competition, Rex,\u201d Marcus said, his voice cold and clinical. \u201cBut you are singing from your head, not from your gut. You just tried to sell us an emotion you clearly don\u2019t feel. You are lucky that your technique is so good it can withstand the weight of that much insincerity. But luck runs out. Consider this a final warning.\u201d The humiliation was absolute. Rex nodded, his face a granite mask, and walked back to the line, a man saved from drowning only to be told he had forgotten how to breathe.\n\nLiam felt a wave of nausea. There was no victory in this, no satisfaction in seeing his rival humbled. He had just witnessed the machine at work. It had identified a successful formula\u2014raw, public vulnerability\u2014and it was now pressuring its other assets to replicate it. He saw his own future in Rex\u2019s hollow performance: a future of being forced to re-enact his own pain, to turn his genuine emotion into a tired gimmick until it, too, felt as insincere as Rex\u2019s tremor. The applause and cheering felt obscene, the sound of a crowd baying for blood disguised as art.\n\nThe moment they were off-air, Brenda May swept into the green room, her face aglow with a predator\u2019s satisfaction. She ignored the tearful, eliminated Lily, her focus entirely on her remaining assets. \u201cSpectacular television, everyone,\u201d she announced, her voice ringing with triumph. She zeroed in on Liam, her eyes gleaming. \u201cLiam, you have redefined this competition. The network is ecstatic. The numbers are astronomical. We\u2019ve discovered the audience isn\u2019t just looking for a singer; they\u2019re starving for a soul.\u201d Her words, which should have been a compliment, felt like a diagnosis. She clapped her hands together, a general leading her troops. \u201cSo we are going to give them what they want. This week\u2019s theme is \u2018Unplugged: Songs from the Heartbreak Hotel\u2019. I want raw. I want real. I want tears. In the dailies, on the stage, I want you to dig deep and give us the pain that makes the music beautiful. Don\u2019t hold anything back.\u201d She was no longer asking him to tell the truth. She was demanding he bleed on a schedule.\n\nHe escaped to his room, the walls feeling closer than ever. The sprawling city view that had once seemed so terrifying and beautiful now just looked like a million windows full of people he was expected to perform his sadness for. He felt a profound sense of isolation, a loneliness that was deeper and more absolute than anything he had ever felt pouring coffee in Mooloolaba. He had thought that was a cage, but this, this was a perfectly designed panopticon where his own heart was the prisoner. He collapsed onto the bed, the exhaustion not physical, but existential. He had won. He was the star of the show. And he had never felt more like a loser. He wanted to call his mum, to hear her simple, uncomplicated pride, but the words caught in his throat. How could he explain that his victory was his greatest defeat? How could he tell her that the whole country was in love with how broken he was?\n\nThe silence was broken by a soft, hesitant knock on his door. He ignored it, hoping they would go away. The knock came again, more insistent this time. Cursing under his breath, he dragged himself to the door and pulled it open, ready to snarl at whichever PA had been sent to drag him to another pointless debrief. But it wasn\u2019t a PA. It was Rex. He was out of his stage clothes, dressed in a simple black t-shirt and jeans. The carefully constructed hair was slightly messy, the mask of cool indifference was gone, replaced by a weary, hollowed-out expression Liam had never seen before. He looked smaller somehow, stripped of his usual aura of arrogant confidence. He wasn't holding a bottle of water or a witty, backhanded compliment. He just stood there, his hands shoved in his pockets, looking not at Liam, but at a spot on the carpet somewhere between them.\n\n\u201cThey saved me,\u201d Rex said, his voice flat, stripped of its usual melodic cadence. \u201cBecause I\u2019m a better machine. My technical specs are superior.\u201d He finally lifted his eyes, and they were filled with a bleak, burnt-out honesty. \u201cYou know what the worst part is? Up there, in that sing-off\u2026 for a second, I almost had it. I was thinking about my grandmother\u2014the real story, not the one for the cameras. About how she used to sing to me when I was a kid. And for just a second, I felt it. A real feeling.\u201d He shook his head, a bitter, self-mocking smile touching his lips. \u201cAnd then my brain kicked in. My training. It started analyzing the feeling, trying to replicate it, trying to figure out the right way to modulate my voice to \u2018perform\u2019 it correctly. And just like that\u2026 it was gone. I was just a guy doing a sad-voice impression.\u201d He looked at Liam, his gaze direct and stripped of all rivalry. \u201cYou don't have that filter, do you? It just\u2026 comes out.\u201d He wasn\u2019t asking a question. It was a statement of fact, a diagnosis from one patient to another. \u201cI came here to ask you how you do it,\u201d Rex said, his voice dropping to a near whisper. \u201cBut I think I just figured it out.\u201d He paused, a strange, grim understanding passing between the two of them, the star performer and the shaman. \u201cYou don\u2019t. It does it to you.\u201d"

                                        "text": "The confession hung in the space between them, stark and unadorned. Rex\u2019s words, stripped of their usual performative gloss, were more resonant than any power ballad. He had named the beast that Liam had felt chewing on his own soul. *It does it to you.* In that moment, the rivalry that had defined their existence in this high-rise prison evaporated, replaced by a grim and unsettling fraternity. Liam had no advice to offer, no words of comfort. He could only stand in the doorway, a mirror image of the man before him\u2014one polished to a high sheen, the other weathered and raw, but both of them cracked. He gave a slow, almost imperceptible nod, an acknowledgment that carried the weight of everything they couldn't say. Rex held his gaze for a second longer, a flicker of something that might have been gratitude in his burnt-out eyes, then turned and walked down the silent, empty hallway, his shoulders slumped in a way that no camera would ever be permitted to capture.\n\nThe week that followed was a slow descent into a new kind of hell. Brenda\u2019s \u2018Heartbreak Hotel\u2019 theme was a directive for emotional self-flagellation, and the entire production leaned into it with a ghoulish enthusiasm. The B-roll camera crews were no longer looking for \u2018wondrous arrival\u2019 shots; they were hunting for tears. They filmed the contestants talking about their first heartbreaks, their biggest regrets, their deepest fears. It was group therapy repurposed as reality television, with ratings as the intended outcome. Chloe, ever the professional, gave them a sweet, sad story about her childhood dog, a performance of gentle melancholy that was perfectly on-brand. Rex was a blank wall; he gave them nothing, answering their probing questions with curt, media-trained non-answers, his face a mask of polite boredom. He had withdrawn his soul from the marketplace.\n\nLiam, however, simply shut down. The guitar, which had been his sanctuary and his weapon, now felt like an instrument of torture. He left it in its case, leaning against the wall like a coffin. He couldn\u2019t sing. When he tried, the direct line from his heart to his voice felt severed, replaced by a tangled switchboard of self-awareness and expectation. He was being asked to feel on command, and the demand itself had cauterized the source. His room, with its spectacular, mocking view, became his cell. He\u2019d sit for hours, staring at the cityscape, feeling nothing but a vast, grey numbness. The voice that could \u2018heal the sick and raise the dead\u2019 was silent, its owner in a self-imposed coma. The production team grew frantic. The golden goose was refusing to lay its golden, tear-stained eggs.\n\nGaz cornered him in the hallway on the way to a vocal session he was planning to skip. The director\u2019s usual breezy jargon was gone, replaced by a raw, undisguised panic. \u201cWhat is wrong with you, Harrison?\u201d he hissed, his face uncomfortably close. \u201cYou\u2019ve got the whole country in the palm of your hand and you\u2019re going mute on me. This is \u2018Heartbreak\u2019 week! This is your Super Bowl! We\u2019ve given you the perfect song, the ultimate showcase for your little broken-bird routine. You need to give us something!\u201d Liam just stared at him, his expression blank. The lack of reaction seemed to infuriate Gaz more than any argument would have. \u201cDon\u2019t you get it? They love you because you hurt. So get in there and hurt for them!\u201d The order was so grotesque, so nakedly vampiric, that it finally broke through Liam\u2019s apathy. He didn\u2019t say a word. He just turned around and walked back to his room, locking the door behind him.\n\nThe song they had chosen for him was a masterstroke of psychological cruelty. A PA had slid the envelope under his door two days earlier, and he had left it lying on the floor, unopened. He finally picked it up now, tearing it open with a sense of grim finality. Inside was a single sheet of paper. The song was \u2018Hurt\u2019. They hadn\u2019t even specified an artist, as if the raw sentiment of the title was all that mattered. The Nine Inch Nails original was a howl of nihilistic self-loathing; the Johnny Cash cover was a deathbed confession, a man taking stock of a life of pain and regret. Both were masterpieces of despair. It was Brenda holding up a mirror and commanding him to bleed. The choice was so on-the-nose, so cynically perfect, that a dry, humorless laugh escaped his lips. It was the first sound he had made all day.\n\nHis refusal to perform at the band rehearsal caused a full-blown crisis. He walked into the studio, saw the setup, the expectant faces of the musicians, and just shook his head. \u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d he said, his voice a hoarse whisper, and walked out, leaving a stunned silence in his wake. Hours later, Brenda May herself appeared at his door. The knock was sharp, imperious. He didn\u2019t open it. \u201cLiam,\u201d her voice came through the wood, smooth and cold as steel. \u201cYou are under contract. You will perform the song we have assigned you on Saturday night. If you continue this behavior, you will be in breach, and I assure you, the consequences will be far more painful than singing a sad song on television. Do not test me.\u201d The threat hung in the air, an iron fist in a velvet glove. He was trapped. There was no escape.\n\nLater that evening, there was another knock. Softer this time. He expected Chloe, with her worried eyes and a cup of tea. He opened the door a crack. It was Rex. He was holding a bottle of expensive-looking whiskey and two of the hotel\u2019s heavy glass tumblers. He didn\u2019t ask for permission, just pushed the door open and walked in, his presence filling the sterile room with a weary, cynical energy. He placed the glasses on the small table by the window and poured two generous measures, the amber liquid catching the light of the city. He pushed one glass towards Liam and took the other for himself. \u201cThe vultures are circling, Harrison,\u201d he said, his voice low. \u201cI saw Gaz\u2019s face. He looks like his prize racehorse has decided to take up knitting.\u201d He took a sip of the whiskey, his eyes scanning Liam\u2019s drawn, pale face. \u201cYou\u2019ve got the yips. The golden faucet of pain has run dry, right when they need it most.\u201d\n\nLiam sank into the chair opposite him, the glass heavy in his hand. \u201cI can\u2019t do it,\u201d he confessed, the words tasting like failure. \u201cI try to sing, and there\u2019s nothing there. It\u2019s just\u2026 gone. It\u2019s like they\u2019ve scared it away.\u201d Rex nodded slowly, swirling the whiskey in his glass. \u201cOf course it\u2019s gone. You can\u2019t force a feeling. The harder you try to grab it, the faster it disappears. That\u2019s amateur stuff.\u201d He leaned forward, his expression serious, the teacher addressing the student. \u201cYou\u2019re trying to live in it again. You\u2019re trying to feel the salt on your tongue, right? You\u2019re trying to actually be that sad kid in the caf\u00e9. That\u2019s your mistake. You can\u2019t go back there. Not really. And you\u2019ll drive yourself insane trying.\u201d He took another drink, his eyes fixed on Liam. \u201cYou need to stop being an artist and start being a cinematographer. Your job isn\u2019t to feel the emotion anymore. Your job is to remember it. You need to detach. Objectify it. Treat your past like a film you\u2019re directing.\u201d\n\nHe leaned in closer, his voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. \u201cWhen you get on that stage, don\u2019t try to feel sad. That\u2019s for the audience. You need to be cold. Clinical. Remember the details. The exact shade of the spilled milk on the counter. The sound of a specific gull. The precise look on your mum\u2019s face when she\u2019s tired. You catalogue those details, you project them out of your head with your voice, and you let the audience put the emotion together for themselves. You give them the ingredients of sadness, and they will bake the cake. You just have to be the guy reading the recipe. It feels like a lie, but it\u2019s not. It\u2019s just professional.\u201d He sat back, letting the advice settle, a piece of dark, brilliant, and utterly necessary wisdom. It was a trade-off: a way to survive the machine, but the price was the last shred of his untainted connection to his own art. Liam looked from the whiskey in his glass to the guitar sitting silent in the corner. He had a choice. He could break, or he could learn how to fake his own truth. He picked up the glass and drained it in one, burning swallow."

                                        "text": "The whiskey burned a trail of cold fire down his throat, a stark, physical sensation that momentarily silenced the noise in his head. In the hazy morning light, the glass sat on the nightstand, a monument to his surrender. He didn't feel better. He didn't feel healed. He felt cold, clear, and hollow, like a house whose tenants had packed up and left in the middle of the night. Rex\u2019s words from the night before were not a comfort; they were a blueprint, a schematic for survival that required the dismantling of his own spirit. He had a choice: be a casualty or be a collaborator in his own commodification. He picked up his phone, not to call his mother, but to send a single, curt text to the production coordinator: \u2018Book me the main rehearsal studio. One hour. I\u2019m ready.\u2019\n\nHe walked into the studio like a different person. The anxious, uncertain energy that had clung to him like the coastal humidity was gone, replaced by a still, quiet focus that was far more unnerving. He bypassed a relieved-looking Gaz, ignored the flurry of questions from PAs, and went directly to the musical director. \u201cJust a cello, like we tried,\u201d he said, his voice flat and even. \u201cAnd I need a different microphone. A condenser. I want it to pick up everything. Every breath. Every scrape of my finger on the string.\u201d Dave, the MD, looked at him with renewed interest, recognizing the language of a professional, not a terrified amateur. Liam turned to the cellist, the same woman from before. \u201cFollow my breath,\u201d he instructed, his tone polite but devoid of warmth. \u201cWhen I pull back, you swell. You are the emotion. I\u2019m just the narrator.\u201d The woman nodded, her expression shifting from sympathetic to intrigued. He was no longer a boy she needed to comfort; he was a conductor giving a precise directive.\n\nHe sat on the stool and began to play, not for Gaz or the band, but for the sound engineer behind the glass, treating the rehearsal like a technical run-through. He sang the first verse of \u2018Hurt\u2019, his eyes open and fixed on a spot on the far wall. His voice was clean, controlled, every note perfectly placed. He wasn\u2019t feeling. He was projecting. He summoned the images Rex had spoken of, treating them like slides in a carousel. *Image: the precise way the rust had eaten into the metal legs of the caf\u00e9 tables. Image: the fraying cuff of his favourite old jumper. Image: the network of tiny lines around his mother\u2019s eyes when she laughed.* He was a documentarian of his own past, his voice the instrument of transmission. On the line, \u201cThe needle tears a hole,\u201d he didn\u2019t sing with anguish; he sang with a chilling, detached precision, as if describing a medical procedure. The cello behind him wept and swelled, filling the emotional space he had deliberately vacated. When he finished, the studio was deathly quiet. Gaz\u2019s voice crackled over the intercom, shaky and confused. \u201cOkay\u2026 yeah. That\u2019ll work. Jesus.\u201d Liam didn\u2019t acknowledge him. He simply nodded to the cellist and the engineer, stood up, and walked out of the room, his part of the transaction complete.\n\nOn the night of the live show, a strange calm had settled over him. He watched the other contestants from the wings, his mind a quiet, orderly place. He felt like an observer, a visitor from another world. Rex delivered a blistering, high-energy rock number, a tactical retreat to his core strength of pure, polished showmanship. He was brilliant, professional, and safe, a performance designed to remind the judges of his commercial viability. After his performance, as he passed Liam in the darkened corridor backstage, he didn\u2019t offer a witty remark. He simply gave a single, sharp nod, the silent acknowledgment of a fellow tradesman. The student was about to present his thesis.\n\nWalking to the stage felt like stepping into a laboratory. The lights, the audience, the judges\u2014they were all variables in an experiment he was about to conduct. He sat on the stool, the warmth of the lights a distant sensation. He registered the silence, the expectation, the thousands of pairs of eyes, but he felt none of it. He was hermetically sealed inside his new method. The cellist began, her mournful notes laying a bed of sorrow for him to lie upon. He closed his eyes, not to feel, but to better see the images stored in his mind\u2019s archive. *I hurt myself today, to see if I still feel.* The line came out not as a cry, but as a statement of fact, the opening of a lab report. His voice was a scalpel, dissecting his own history with surgical precision. *I focus on the pain, the only thing that\u2019s real.* He sang the line while picturing the chipped rim of a coffee cup, the detail so vivid and specific that it became, in that moment, the only real thing in the universe.\n\nHe didn't build to a crescendo of pain. He built a museum of it, each line a different exhibit, each note a plaque describing the artifact. He was a tour guide walking the audience through the ruins of his own 'yesterday'. For the final verse, Johnny Cash\u2019s verse, he let a new set of images in. The sterile hotel room. The flashing \u2018On Air\u2019 sign. Brenda May\u2019s predatory smile. Rex\u2019s hollowed-out eyes. *If I could start again, a million miles away, I would keep myself. I would find a way.* The confession was real, but the pain was second-hand, a memory of a feeling, not the feeling itself. He sang the final line and let the sound fade into nothing, his face a perfect mask of serene, dignified sorrow. The performance was a lie. And it was the most truthful thing he had ever sung on that stage.\n\nThe reaction was immediate and terrifying. The silence was deeper, more profound than the week before. And then came the sound. It wasn't applause. It was the sound of weeping. A soft, collective, heartbroken sob that rippled through the entire auditorium. The cameras panned across the audience, capturing faces streaked with tears, people holding each other, utterly devastated. Liam had given them the ingredients, and they had baked a thousand different cakes of their own private grief. He had become a vessel for their pain, a blank screen onto which they projected their own heartbreaks. He had never been more powerful, or more alone.\n\nWhen the host finally spoke, his voice was thick with emotion. The judges looked shattered. Marcus stared at Liam, his face not grim or severe, but deeply, profoundly sad. He didn't speak for a long time, just held Liam\u2019s gaze. \u201cIn my life,\u201d Marcus said finally, his voice raspy, \u201cI have seen artists give a piece of themselves to an audience. I have never before seen a man perform his own vivisection on live television and leave his soul on the stage for everyone to see.\u201d He shook his head, a look of deep conflict in his eyes. \u201cIt was a masterpiece of emotional devastation. It was perfect. And I hated every single second of it.\u201d He looked away from Liam, towards the camera. \u201cBecause I fear we have just witnessed the birth of a great artist, and the death of a happy man. And I\u2019m not sure we, or he, should be celebrating that.\u201d The words were a benediction and an indictment, a crown of thorns placed gently on Liam\u2019s head. He had won. The cost was simply everything."

                                        "text": "The silence that followed Marcus\u2019s verdict was more damning than any booing could ever have been. It was the silence of a truth so stark and uncomfortable that no one knew how to react. The applause had been for the art; the silence was for the man. As Liam walked off stage, the crew members and fellow contestants parted for him as if he were a leper, their faces a mixture of awe, pity, and fear. The usual post-performance back-slaps and \u201cgreat job, mate\u201d were conspicuously absent. He was surrounded by a quarantine of respect. Chloe reached him first, her own triumph forgotten. She didn\u2019t congratulate him. She grabbed his arm, her hand trembling, and looked into his blank, distant eyes. \u201cLiam, are you okay?\u201d she asked, her voice a small, worried whisper. The simple, human question was so out of place in the artificial ecosystem of the show that he had no idea how to answer it.\n\nBefore he could even try, Brenda May descended upon them, her face alight with a terrifying, ecstatic energy. She moved with the triumphant swagger of a general whose risky strategy had just won the war. \u201cA masterpiece of emotional devastation,\u201d she quoted Marcus, her voice dripping with glee, not concern. She beamed at Liam, her eyes shining with the thrill of a ratings victory. \u201cThe network is in raptures. The phone lines exploded. You\u2019re not just a contestant anymore, Liam. You\u2019re a cultural event.\u201d She patted his arm, a gesture that felt more like she was assessing the quality of a prize-winning animal than offering comfort. \u201cThe \u2018Broken Artist\u2019 narrative arc is the most compelling story we\u2019ve had in years. This is television gold. Pure gold.\u201d She didn\u2019t see a man; she saw a demographic, a trend, a product whose key selling point was its own destruction. The celebration felt like a wake.\n\nSleep was no longer a possibility. His hotel room was a silent tomb, the sprawling city lights outside the window providing no comfort, only a cold, indifferent illumination. He sat on the edge of the bed for hours, the television a blank screen, his phone lying face down. He was afraid to turn either of them on, afraid to see the face that was supposedly his, praised for its exquisite suffering. The numbness of the past few days had receded, replaced by a vast, echoing emptiness. He had poured everything out on that stage, every memory, every detail, and now there was nothing left inside. He was a vessel that had been emptied for public consumption. He had won the game, but in doing so, had proven Rex\u2019s bleakest prophecies correct. He had strip-mined his own soul for their entertainment, and now the landscape was barren.\n\nFinally, at three in the morning, his resolve crumbled. He needed to hear a voice that wasn\u2019t analyzing him, praising him, or trying to sell him something. He needed an anchor. He called his mum. She answered instantly, her voice thick and alert, as if she had been sitting by the phone, waiting. \u201cLiam?\u201d He tried to speak, but only a choked, broken sound came out. \u201cOh, lovey,\u201d she said, and the simple, unconditional love in those two words broke him. A single, hot tear traced a path down his cheek, the first thing he had genuinely felt all night. \u201cI saw it,\u201d she said, her voice quiet and strained. \u201cMel had it on the big screen at the club. The whole place was watching.\u201d There was a pause, and he could hear her take a shaky breath. \u201cAbout halfway through, I asked Jake to drive me home. I couldn\u2019t watch anymore.\u201d This wasn\u2019t the proud, ecstatic call from weeks ago. This was the voice of a mother who had just watched her son walk into a fire. \u201cThat man on the television, the judge, he said you were a great artist but not a happy man. And he was right, wasn\u2019t he? That face on the screen\u2026 that wasn\u2019t my boy. That was a ghost. What are they doing to you in that place, Liam?\u201d\n\nHer question was a key turning a lock deep inside him. It wasn\u2019t a cage anymore. It was a factory, and he was both the raw material and the product, being systematically disassembled and re-packaged for sale. The ambition that had propelled him here, the desperate need to escape the familiar rhythm of his life, now seemed like a foolish, childish dream. He had traded a beautiful cage for an abattoir. \u201cI want to come home,\u201d he whispered into the phone, the words feeling like the first truly authentic thing he had said all week. There was no hesitation on her end, only a wave of pure, unadulterated relief. \u201cYour room\u2019s waiting for you, lovey,\u201d she said, her voice breaking. \u201cIt\u2019s always waiting.\u201d\n\nAfter the call, clarity descended. It wasn\u2019t a difficult decision. It was the only decision. It was an act of self-preservation. He moved with a quiet, methodical purpose he hadn't felt in weeks. He opened his cheap duffel bag and began to pack. He left the neatly folded piles of X-Factor branded tracksuits and t-shirts on the bed, a uniform for a soldier deserting his post. He packed his own worn jeans, his faded surf-shop hoodies, the clothes that held the faint, lingering scent of salt and home. He slid the cardboard tube containing his Bachelor of Marketing degree out from under the bed\u2014the bitter joke that now felt like a relic from another, simpler lifetime\u2014and placed it carefully in the bag. It was a part of his story they had never been interested in, and for that, he was suddenly grateful. He picked up his guitar, its familiar weight a comfort, a friend who had been forced to bear witness to his ordeal.\n\nHe stood in the middle of the room and looked around one last time at the sterile luxury, the panoramic view of a world he had briefly conquered and now utterly rejected. He felt no regret, only a profound and urgent need to leave. He pulled out a sheet of the hotel\u2019s heavy stationery and a pen. He thought of writing a long letter to Brenda, a scathing indictment of the machine. He thought of writing to Marcus, to thank him for seeing the truth. But words felt useless, part of the game he was now refusing to play. Instead, he wrote just three. *I quit. Liam.* He left the note on the pillow where the branded clothes lay. It was a simple, stark resignation. On his way out, he stopped in front of Rex\u2019s door. He took another piece of paper and wrote two words this time. *You were right.* He slid it under the door, a final message to his strange, cynical saviour. He didn\u2019t take the express lift in the lobby. He found a service elevator at the end of the hall, the kind used by housekeeping and room service. As the brushed steel doors slid closed, he caught his reflection. The face staring back was tired, gaunt, and etched with a profound weariness, but for the first time in a very long time, it was his own. He wasn't the Surfer-Boy-Saviour, or the Broken Artist. He was just Liam Harrison. And he was going home."

                                        "text": "The service elevator whirred and clunked its way down, a utilitarian metal box smelling faintly of bleach and stale cigarette smoke. It was a jarring contrast to the silent, carpeted opulence of the guest lifts, which ascended with the smooth, soundless grace of a prayer. Liam felt the difference in his bones. This was a descent back to reality, a journey into the engine room of the magnificent ship he was abandoning. He emerged not into a lobby of marble and meaningless art, but into a concrete basement labyrinth of humming ice machines, bundled linens, and the greasy, comforting smell of the staff canteen\u2019s breakfast shift. He was invisible here. A ghost in a grey hoodie, his guitar case a cumbersome, unfamiliar appendage. No one gave him a second glance. He was just another part of the machinery, heading for the exit. He pushed through a heavy fire door and found himself in a narrow, shadowed laneway, the pre-dawn air cool and tasting of diesel fumes and damp pavement. It was the most beautiful thing he had ever tasted.\n\nHe walked for several blocks before hailing a taxi, the act itself a small miracle of regained autonomy. The driver, a weary-looking man with a podcast about ancient history murmuring from the speakers, glanced at him in the rear-view mirror. \"To the airport, mate?\" he asked, and that was it. There was no flicker of recognition, no hushed whisper of \"Aren't you that guy from the telly?\". He was just a fare, a man with a guitar case heading for the airport at an ungodly hour. The relief was so profound it was almost dizzying. As the cab pulled into the city\u2019s traffic, his phone, which he had foolishly left on, began to buzz. A blocked number. It buzzed again, and again, a frantic, insistent vibration against his leg. It was the machine, waking up and realizing a cog was missing. It was the sound of panic, of schedules being destroyed, of a narrative going off-script. With a slow, deliberate movement, he reached into his pocket, held down the power button, and watched the screen go black. The ensuing silence felt absolute, a small, perfect victory.\n\nThe domestic terminal was a cathedral of quiet, early-morning transit. People slept in uncomfortable chairs, nursed takeaway coffees, and stared blankly at departure boards. They were all in-between, moving from one part of their real lives to another. Liam checked his duffel bag, bought a coffee that was scalding hot and reassuringly mediocre, and found a seat by a window overlooking the tarmac. He watched the ground crews moving in their fluorescent vests, the baggage carts balletically weaving across the wet asphalt. It was a world of tangible purpose, of things that needed to be loaded and planes that needed to fly. It was a world blessedly free of B-roll, media training, and the relentless demand for marketable pain. He was just a guy waiting for a flight, another anonymous face in the river of humanity, and the ordinariness of it was a balm to his scorched soul. He didn't think about what would happen when his absence was discovered. He didn't think about the contract or Brenda May\u2019s rage. He thought only of the gentle curve of Mooloolaba Bay.\n\nThe flight was short, a little over an hour, but the transition was seismic. As the plane banked and began its descent, the sprawling, intricate geometry of Sydney gave way to the deep, unbroken blue of the Pacific. Then, land appeared. Not the grey-brown haze of a metropolis, but a vibrant, living coastline of impossible greens and golds. He saw the Glass House Mountains hazy in the distance, the winding thread of the Maroochy River, the white-flecked surf rolling onto endless stretches of sand. This was a landscape painted with a different palette, shaped by a different god. He felt his shoulders, which had been hunched in a permanent defensive crouch for weeks, begin to unclench. His lungs, accustomed to the refrigerated, recycled air of the hotel and the studio, felt tight, as if preparing for a different atmosphere.\n\nThe moment the plane doors opened, it hit him. Not just air, but a thick, warm, living entity. It was a wall of humidity, saturated with the smell of salt, damp earth, and blooming frangipani. It coated his tongue and worked its way into the seams of his clothes. He had forgotten its power, its sheer, physical presence. He walked down the metal steps onto the tarmac\u2014there were no aerobridges at the small Sunshine Coast airport\u2014and the sound was the next wave. Not the hum of traffic and distant sirens, but the shrill, familiar caw of gulls and the high-pitched thrum of cicadas, a sound so intrinsic to home he hadn\u2019t even realized he\u2019d missed it. He stopped at the bottom of the stairs, his duffel bag in one hand, his guitar in the other, and closed his eyes. He breathed it all in, a man dying of thirst taking his first drink of water.\n\nThe taxi home was a journey back through his own life. The driver, a young woman with zinc on her nose, recognized him instantly. \u201cHey, you\u2019re Liam!\u201d she said, her smile wide and uncomplicated. \u201cWe\u2019ve all been watching you, mate. You\u2019re a bloody legend! What are you doing back?\u201d He just smiled, a tired, genuine smile. \u201cJust came home for a bit,\u201d he said, and she accepted it without question, launching into a story about how the whole pub she worked at went quiet every time he sang. It was different here. The fame wasn\u2019t a commodity; it was a form of community pride, simple and direct. The car passed the surf club, the beachfront caf\u00e9 where he used to work\u2014it looked smaller, somehow\u2014the familiar pandanus trees leaning in the wind. The glare off the Coral Sea was a physical force, but it no longer felt relentless. It felt like a welcome.\n\nHe asked the driver to drop him at the end of his street. He wanted to walk the last few yards himself. The house was a small, weatherboard cottage, its paint peeling slightly from the constant assault of the salt air. It looked beautiful. The front door opened before he was halfway up the garden path. His mum stood there, her face a roadmap of worry, love, and profound relief. She looked older than he remembered, or perhaps he was just seeing her more clearly now. She didn\u2019t run to him, and he didn\u2019t run to her. They met in the middle of the small, overgrown lawn. She wrapped her arms around him, her small frame surprisingly strong, and he buried his face in her shoulder, the familiar scent of her washing powder and her skin an anchor in the spinning world. He held on tight, his body shaking with the release of weeks of coiled tension. There were no words. None were needed.\n\nLater, in the quiet of his old bedroom, the world felt small and manageable again. The room was exactly as he\u2019d left it, a museum of his former life. Surf posters on the wall, a stack of dog-eared novels on the bedside table, the cardboard tube with his degree sticking out from under the bed. He opened the window, and the sound of the ocean, a distant, rhythmic shushing, filled the space. The salt was in the air, a fine, gritty mist. He picked up his phone, the sleek, black rectangle that had been his lifeline and his leash. He didn't smash it. He didn't throw it into the sea. He simply popped the back off, removed the SIM card\u2014a tiny chip containing an entire world of pressure and expectation\u2014and let it fall onto the dusty floor. He was offline. He was disconnected. He was free. He lay back on his narrow bed, the lumpy mattress a greater comfort than any king-sized pillow-topped monstrosity, and listened to the waves. The salt was the first thing. Always. But it was no longer the taste of a cage. It was the taste of home."

                                        "text": "The first morning back was a slow, gentle awakening, a stark contrast to the jolting, pre-dawn summons of the production schedule. He woke not to an alarm or a PA knocking on his door, but to a slash of bright, humid sunlight cutting through a gap in his old, faded curtains. The air was thick and still, stirred only by the lazy whir of the ceiling fan clicking softly with each rotation. He lay there for a long time, listening. He could hear the distant, rhythmic sigh of the surf, the chatter of rainbow lorikeets in the mango tree outside, the clatter of his mother making breakfast in the kitchen. These were the sounds of his life, a soundtrack he hadn't realized he\u2019d been missing until it was returned to him. There was no schedule on a tablet, no camera crew waiting to film him look \u2018natural\u2019, no one demanding he feel anything at all. The day stretched before him, a vast, formless, beautiful expanse of nothing. It was the greatest luxury he had ever known.\n\nIn the kitchen, his mother moved with a quiet, practiced efficiency. She didn\u2019t ask him about the show, about Sydney, about the haunted look in his eyes. She simply placed a plate of scrambled eggs and buttery toast in front of him, the way she had a thousand times before. The gesture was an act of profound, uncomplicated love, a reclamation. They ate in a comfortable silence, punctuated only by the scrape of cutlery on plates and the murmur of a local radio station. He watched her hands as she refilled his coffee cup, noting the network of fine lines and the faint, permanent stain of garden soil under her nails. These were real hands, hands that fixed things and grew things and held him when he was small. Everything in this room, from the chipped ceramic mugs to the faded tea towel hanging on the oven door, was imbued with a history that was messy, authentic, and his own. He felt the tight, frozen knot in his chest, a knot he hadn\u2019t even been fully aware of, begin to slowly, painstakingly, dissolve.\n\nThe shrill ring of the landline, a sound he hadn\u2019t heard in months, made him jump. His mother answered, her voice soft, then she passed the receiver to him with a small, knowing smile. It was Jake. The voice that came roaring down the line was a jolt of pure, uncut Mooloolaba energy. \u201cYou absolute lunatic! You did it! You actually just walked out! It\u2019s all over the news, mate. They\u2019re losing their minds! Are you okay? Did they have snipers on the roof?\u201d The barrage of questions was so perfectly Jake that Liam let out a real, genuine laugh, a sound that felt rusty from disuse. \u201cI\u2019m okay, mate,\u201d he said, leaning against the kitchen wall. \u201cJust\u2026 done.\u201d \u201cDone? You were winning! You were the king!\u201d Jake\u2019s voice was a mixture of awe and utter bewilderment. \u201cYeah, well. The crown was too heavy,\u201d Liam said, the words coming out simpler and truer than any lyric he\u2019d sung on stage. There was a pause on the other end, and then Jake\u2019s tone softened. \u201cFair enough. Well, the king is home. First beer is on me. Don\u2019t be a stranger.\u201d The call was a bridge back to a world where walking away from fame wasn\u2019t a crisis or a breach of contract, but something your best mate would understand after a moment of stunned disbelief.\n\nLater that morning, the four walls of his house, which had at first felt like a sanctuary, began to feel too small. He needed air, space, the horizon. He pulled on a pair of old boardshorts and a t-shirt, slid his feet into worn-out thongs, and stepped out into the blinding midday sun. The walk towards the beach was a gauntlet of familiar faces. A neighbour watering his lawn gave him a thumbs-up and a wide grin. A woman driving past in a minivan slowed down and yelled \u201cGo, Liam!\u201d out the window. It wasn't intrusive or demanding; it was warm, personal, but it was also a constant reminder that he was no longer just a local boy. He was a local hero, a public figure, a role he had just run a thousand kilometres to escape. He felt a phantom urge to look around for a camera crew, to arrange his face into a mask of humble gratitude. The training was sunk deep.\n\nHe found himself standing across the road from the beachfront caf\u00e9. It looked exactly the same, a little tired, a little shabby, the windows hazed with a fine layer of salt. Through the glass, he could see Mel, a thunderous scowl on her face as she berated a young kid fumbling with the coffee grinder. He almost kept walking, but some instinct told him he needed to close this circle. He crossed the road, the hot asphalt burning the soles of his feet, and pushed open the door. The jingle of the little bell above the door was a sound from another lifetime. Mel looked up, her scowl deepening as she saw him. \u201cWhat in the bloody hell do you want?\u201d she rasped, her voice pure gravel. \u201cCome to quit again?\u201d Liam felt a flush of shame. \u201cNo,\u201d he said, his voice quiet. \u201cI came to apologize. For how I left.\u201d He stood there, waiting for the tirade. Instead, she just stared at him for a long moment, her shrewd eyes taking in his tired face, the anxious energy he was trying to hide. She grunted, a sound that was her equivalent of a sigh. She turned, pulled a cup, and slammed it under the espresso machine. \u201cYou looked like a damned ghost on the telly last week,\u201d she said, not looking at him, her back turned as she frothed the milk with an aggressive hiss. \u201cThought you were gonna fall over. This one\u2019s on the house,\u201d she added, sliding a flat white across the counter towards him. \u201cDon\u2019t get used to it.\u201d It was the closest he would ever get to an expression of concern from her, and it meant more than all the judges\u2019 praise combined.\n\nHe took the coffee, the ceramic warm in his hands, and walked down the wooden stairs to the beach. He found a spot on the soft, white sand, far from the main throng of sunbathers and tourists, and sat down. He watched the impossibly blue water of the Coral Sea roll in, each wave collapsing on the shore in a hiss of white foam. The coffee was strong and slightly bitter, just as he remembered. He didn\u2019t feel the need to sing. He didn\u2019t feel the need to do anything. The constant, gnawing pressure to create, to feel, to perform, was gone. There was only the sun on his skin, the rhythmic crash of the waves, and the vast, empty canvas of the sky. For the first time in what felt like a lifetime, his mind was quiet. He just sat and watched the tide come in, a man learning how to simply exist again. He was not an artist. He was not a star. He was a body on a beach, and it was enough.\n\nHe returned home as the afternoon light began to soften, turning the sky a pale, dusty pink. The house was quiet. He found his mum in the living room, watching the television with the sound turned low. He was about to speak when he saw his own face flash onto the screen. It was an entertainment news program, the graphics loud and flashy. The chyron at the bottom of the screen screamed: \u201cX-FACTOR IN CHAOS: STAR FINALIST LIAM HARRISON QUITS SHOW.\u201d There was footage of him from the last performance, his face pale and strained. There was a tight-lipped \u201cno comment\u201d from a harried-looking Brenda May being ambushed in a parking garage. There were \u2018industry experts\u2019 speculating wildly about a nervous breakdown, a secret illness, a dramatic falling out with the judges. They were turning his escape into a new storyline, his private act of self-preservation into the season\u2019s most dramatic plot twist. He watched, a cold knot forming in his stomach, as they defined him, packaged him, and sold his departure as just another piece of must-see TV. He had left the building, but he hadn't escaped the story. The machine didn\u2019t need him present to keep grinding him up."

The slick, sensationalist graphics and the smirking face of the entertainment reporter vanished, but their residue lingered in the air, a toxic, invisible film. Liam sat frozen on the couch, the cold knot in his stomach tightening into a solid fist of ice. They had taken his quiet, desperate act of self-preservation and twisted it into a spectacle, another cliffhanger in the weekly drama. The \u2018Broken Artist\u2019 hadn\u2019t escaped; he\u2019d just been given a new, more tragic, and far more profitable storyline. The machine hadn\u2019t been broken by his departure; it had simply absorbed it, metabolizing his rebellion into more content. He had walked out of the prison, only to discover the walls were everywhere.\n\n\u201cVultures,\u201d his mother said, her voice a low, furious tremor. She stood by the blank television screen, her hands clenched at her sides. \u201cThey\u2019re not happy just to put you through a meat grinder, they want to pick over the bones, too. To say those things\u2026 \u2018a nervous breakdown\u2019\u2026 like you\u2019re some kind of performing monkey who finally snapped.\u201d Her anger was a shield, a fierce, protective fire that was more comforting than any gentle words could have been. She saw him not as a story, not as a casualty, but as her son, and she was furious on his behalf. \u201cThey don\u2019t get to do this, Liam. They don\u2019t get to follow you home and write stories about you. This is your home. You\u2019re safe here.\u201d He wanted to believe her, but he could feel the long, cold shadow of the Sydney tower stretching all the way to this small, quiet living room. Safety felt like a memory from a world that no longer existed.\n\nThe next day, the illusion of peace was shattered. The easy anonymity he had felt for a fleeting twenty-four hours was gone, replaced by a constant, low-grade vigilance. When he walked outside, his eyes scanned the street not for familiar faces, but for unfamiliar cars parked at odd angles. He looked for the glint of sunlight on something that didn't belong. The town\u2019s affection, which had felt so warm and simple the day before, now seemed tinged with the media\u2019s narrative. The friendly waves from passing cars felt different, freighted with a new curiosity. He could see the questions in their eyes, the echo of the television reports. They weren\u2019t just proud of the local boy who made good; they were worried about, and fascinated by, the fragile star who had supposedly cracked. He was no longer just Liam; he was a story they had all been told, and he could feel them trying to fit him into its frame.\n\nHe tried to find sanctuary on the beach, walking far down the coast towards a stretch of deserted sand where the tourists rarely ventured. He needed to feel the sun and the salt without the weight of being watched. Jake met him there, carrying a weathered Esky and two fishing rods. For an hour, it almost worked. They cast their lines into the surf, the conversation drifting easily between old school friends and the dismal prospects of the local footy team. It was a perfect facsimile of their old lives, a moment of cherished, profane normalcy. They were just two mates fishing. But then Liam saw it. A flicker of movement in the scrubby dunes behind them, a place where no one should be. A quick, sharp glint of light. A long lens. The paparazzi had found him. The machine had sent a scout. The cold dread that washed over him was a familiar, sickening tide.\n\nJake saw the change in his expression and followed his gaze. His easy-going smile vanished, replaced by a thunderous scowl. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding me,\u201d he snarled, dropping his rod in the sand. \u201cI\u2019ll go have a word with that creep.\u201d He started towards the dunes, his posture radiating aggression, ready to defend his friend and his territory. But Liam grabbed his arm, his grip surprisingly strong. \u201cNo, Jake. Don\u2019t.\u201d Jake turned, bewildered. \u201cWhat do you mean, don\u2019t? He\u2019s filming you! I\u2019m gonna go break his bloody camera.\u201d Liam shook his head, a grim, weary wisdom in his eyes that hadn\u2019t been there a month ago. \u201cAnd then what? The headline tomorrow will be \u2018Troubled Star\u2019s Violent Mate Attacks Photographer\u2019. It\u2019s what they want. They want a scene. They want a reaction. Anything but anger, mate. Anger is currency for them. Don\u2019t give them anything.\u201d The lesson, learned in a high-rise hotel room from a cynical rival, was now being put to use on a Mooloolaba beach. He had learned the rules of their game, and rule number one was that emotional honesty was ammunition they would use against you.\n\nThey packed up their gear in silence, the easy camaraderie of the morning gone, replaced by a tense, hunted feeling. The sacred space had been violated, the sanctuary breached. The walk back along the shoreline was not a peaceful stroll but a tactical retreat. Liam felt the unseen lens on his back with every step, a phantom touch that made his skin crawl. He kept his head down, his shoulders hunched, his face a neutral mask. He was performing again, performing \u2018unbothered\u2019, a role that was just as exhausting as performing \u2018heartbroken\u2019. The joy of being home was rapidly being replaced by the familiar claustrophobia of being a specimen under a microscope. He had run all this way only to find himself in a slightly larger, sunnier laboratory.\n\nBack in the house, he pulled the blinds closed, shutting out the bright, beautiful day. His mother watched him, her face etched with a helpless anger. The house no longer felt like a fortress; it felt like a bunker. He knew this wasn't sustainable. He couldn't spend the rest of his life hiding in the dark, peeking through the curtains, waiting for the vultures to get bored and fly away. They wouldn\u2019t. The story was too good. He had to do something, but he couldn\u2019t fight them on their terms. Lashing out was a loss. Silence was a loss; it allowed them to write whatever story they wanted. He felt utterly checkmated, trapped between a narrative he didn't write and a silence that would be filled with lies. He slumped onto the couch, the weight of his impossible situation pressing down on him.\n\nHe sat there for a long time, the silence of the dim room punctuated by the ticking of a clock on the wall. He thought of Rex\u2019s cynicism, of Eleanor\u2019s wisdom, of his mother\u2019s fierce, protective love. He had run from the noise, but the story had followed him. He couldn\u2019t outrun it. He couldn\u2019t fight it. What was left? He looked across the room and saw his guitar case leaning against the wall. It wasn't an instrument of torture anymore. It wasn't a prop. It was a tool. His tool. The only one he had left. They had taken his voice and used it to tell their story. The only way to win wasn't to stop singing. It was to sing a song they couldn't co-opt, a story they couldn't twist. His own. Not a cover, not an interpretation, but a song born here, in this room, out of this impossible situation. He wouldn't be their Broken Artist or their Troubled Star. He would be a songwriter. He stood up, crossed the room, and unclasped the latches on the case. The war wasn't over. It was just entering a new, quieter, and far more dangerous phase."
