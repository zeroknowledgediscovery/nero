     "novel_text": "The grain of the oak ran true under her palm, a current of silent history. Aoife traced the line with a calloused fingertip, feeling the faint ridges and valleys of its life. Here, in the organised chaos of her workshop, things made sense. Wood didn't lie. It might warp if you mistreated it, or split if you were impatient, but its nature was honest. You could read a plank of pine like a page, see the fat years and the lean ones in the spacing of its rings. It was a language she understood better than the clipped, guarded conversations that filled the rest of her life. The air tasted of ghosts of trees \u2013 of sawdust and linseed oil and the sharp tang of varnish. It was her sanctuary, this small, rented space tucked away behind a row of terraced houses in East Belfast, with the colossal yellow heads of the Harland & Wolff cranes, Samson and Goliath, peering over the rooftops like two ancient, weary gods.\n\nIt was a lie, of course. Everything was. The biggest lie was the one she lived every day, the one that felt more true than any fact. The second biggest lie was that she was just Aoife, the quiet carpenter with the sad eyes and the surprisingly strong hands. The truth was something stranger, something that had begun to shimmer at the edges of her vision, like heat haze off summer tarmac. It had started small. A flicker in the mirror, a moment where her reflection seemed to lag a half-second behind her movement. Once, reaching for a chisel, she\u2019d seen the tool through the faint outline of her own hand. She\u2019d blamed exhaustion, the low, persistent hum of fatigue that had been her companion for years. She\u2019d blamed the dust motes dancing in the weak afternoon light. She blamed anything but the impossible notion that she was, for a fraction of a second, fading away.\n\nThe bell above the workshop door jangled, a sound that always set her teeth on edge. She didn't have to look up to know who it was. Eamonn had a specific way of disturbing the air, a heavy presence that sucked the warmth from a room. He was her step-brother, a term that felt both technically correct and profoundly wrong. Her mother, Maura, had married his father when Aoife was ten and Eamonn was already a man of twenty-five. His father had passed a few years back, leaving Eamonn as the reluctant, default patriarch of their fractured family.\n\n\"Smells like a bloody forest fire in here,\" he grumbled, closing the door and plunging the workshop back into its familiar gloom. He stood in the doorway, a solid, thick-set man in a worn tweed jacket, his face a roadmap of disapproval.\n\n\"It's varnish, Eamonn. Same as it was last week.\" Aoife didn't turn around. She kept her focus on the wardrobe door she was sanding, the rhythmic scrape of paper on wood a shield against him.\n\n\"Should be getting more sun than this. It's not healthy, cooped up in the dark.\"\n\n\"The wood doesn't need a tan.\"\n\nHer relationship with Eamonn was a piece of warped timber she\u2019d been trying to plane smooth her whole life. It was impossible. There was a knot of something hard and unspoken between them that resisted every tool she had. He was by turns overly protective and dismissively critical. He\u2019d check the locks on her doors but scoff at the price she charged for a bespoke bookcase. He\u2019d bring her soup when she was sick and then tell her she looked like a ghost. He never, ever seemed at ease around her.\n\n\"Maura's worried,\" he said, moving further into the room, his heavy boots scuffing through the sawdust. \"Says you're not eating. Says you look\u2026\" he trailed off, searching for the word.\n\n\"Like a ghost?\" Aoife supplied, her voice flat. She finally turned, leaning back against her workbench. She looked at him, at the tired lines around his eyes, the way his jaw was perpetually set. He was her father. The thought came unbidden, a jolt of cold, hard fact that she had to swallow down every time she saw him. He didn\u2019t know that she knew. Her mother had confessed it one tear-sodden, whiskey-fuelled night years ago, a secret passed like a curse. Eamonn had been seventeen, a scared boy who\u2019d gotten her sixteen-year-old mother pregnant and whose own father, a man of stern, unbending principle, had arranged a story to keep the shame at bay. Maura was sent to relatives in England, the baby was born, and a year later she returned and eventually married the old man, bringing the child with her. The boy, her son, became the daughter of her new husband and the step-sister of the boy who was her father. A neat, cruel solution. A lifetime of lies built on a single, desperate one.\n\n\"You've a smart mouth on you, girl,\" he said, his eyes scanning the workshop, avoiding her own. \"That's half your trouble.\"\n\n\"What's the other half?\" The question was a challenge, and they both knew it. Her existence was the trouble. The secret she carried, the secret he didn't know she knew, was the trouble. The fact that she had grown up to be Aoife, not the son he had secretly fathered, was a deep and abiding trouble that hung in the air between them, thick as the dust.\n\n\"You're too much in your own head,\" he said, finally landing on a safe criticism. \"Always were. You need to get out. Meet someone. A nice fella.\"\n\nThe words landed like small, sharp stones. *A nice fella.* Every time he said it, a fresh wave of resentment washed over her. It was his way of trying to force her into a box she had fought her entire life to escape. He wanted her to be normal, to be something he could understand. And the more he pushed, the more she felt an overwhelming, suffocating urge to simply\u2026 vanish.\n\n\"I'm busy,\" she said, her voice tight. \"I have work.\"\n\n\"This isn't a life, Aoife. It's a hobby you get paid for. Hiding in here with bits of wood. It's not right for a woman your age.\"\n\nThere it was. The pressure point. The feeling of being scrutinized, judged, and found wanting. The desperate, clawing need to be anywhere else, to be no one. The light from the high, grimy windows went syrupy. The drone of a distant siren seemed to stretch and slow, bending into a low moan. A familiar coldness seeped into her bones, a feeling like plunging her hands into ice water.\n\n\"Stop it, Eamonn,\" she whispered, a plea.\n\n\"Stop what? Stop caring? Someone has to. Your mother's tearing her hair out and you're in here playing with splinters, looking thinner every day. What am I supposed to do?\" His voice was rising, laced with a frustration that was twenty-odd years in the making.\n\n\"Just... leave me be.\"\n\nShe squeezed her eyes shut. The feeling was stronger this time, a powerful undertow pulling her out from the shore of herself. *I'm not here. You can't see me. I'm not here.* It was an old childhood mantra, a game she used to play to escape her mother\u2019s anxieties or her grandfather\u2019s stern gaze. But it wasn't a game anymore.\n\nA sharp clatter echoed in the sudden silence.\n\nAoife opened her eyes. Eamonn was staring, his face ashen, his mouth slightly agape. He wasn't looking at her. He was looking *through* her, at the wall of tools hanging on the board behind where she stood. The sanding block she had been holding lay on the floor at her feet, having slipped from a hand that was no longer there. She looked down. Her arms, her chest, her legs \u2013 they were gone. She was a ghost. A void in the shape of a person, the dusty air of the workshop the only thing occupying the space where her body should be. The cold was absolute now, a profound and terrifying emptiness.\n\n\"Aoife?\" Eamonn breathed, the word a ragged puff of disbelief. He took a hesitant step forward, his hand outstretched, not to touch her, but to wave through the space she inhabited. His hand passed through her sternum without resistance. A strangled noise escaped his throat, a sound of pure, primal fear. \"What devilry is this? What in God's name are you?\"The terror was a silent scream in a vacuum. Aoife had no lungs to draw breath, no throat to make a sound, but the panic was absolute. She was a conscious absence, a thinking void. She could see the workshop around her, every detail sharp and clear: the panicked, wide-eyed horror on Eamonn's face, the fine layer of dust on a stack of unsanded ash, the lazy curl of a wood shaving on the floor. Yet she couldn't feel the floor. She couldn't feel the solid wood of the workbench she had been leaning against. She was unmoored from the world, a kite whose string had been cut, and the wind was blowing her out into a vast, cold nothingness. The mantra that had been her shield had become her cage. *I am here*, she thought, a desperate, silent rebuttal. *I am here. Let me be here.*\n\nEamonn stumbled back, his hand retracting as if he'd touched a live wire. He collided with a half-finished chest of drawers, sending a pot of wood glue skittering across its top to crash onto the floor in a sticky puddle. The sound was unnaturally loud in the quiet space. He was breathing hard, his chest heaving under the tweed jacket. His gaze, wild and terrified, darted around the space she occupied, trying to find a rational explanation where none existed. He was a man who understood foundations, load-bearing walls, and the unyielding logic of a mortise and tenon joint. What he was seeing was an affront to the very laws of physics that governed his world. He looked from the empty space to the sanding block on the floor, then back again. The evidence was irrefutable and insane.\n\n\"Saints preserve us,\" he whispered, his voice trembling. He fumbled in his jacket pocket, his knuckles white, and pulled out a small, worn rosary. His fingers worked the beads clumsily, a frantic, instinctual prayer. \"This is not of God. This is dark work, Aoife.\" His fear was curdling into accusation, the only way his mind could process the impossible. He was looking for a familiar enemy, for sin and retribution, for a devil he could name rather than a mystery he could not. \"What have you been meddling in?\"\n\nHis words, his terror, were a lifeline. The raw, powerful force of his emotion was an anchor in the formless sea she was drifting in. His fear made her real. A flicker, like a faulty lightbulb, started in the air where her heart should be. The profound cold began to recede, chased back by a pins-and-needles agony as her nerves began to fire again. The scent of varnish and sawdust rushed back in, overwhelming her. She could feel the rough texture of the workbench against her back, the solid reality of the concrete floor under her worn boots. The shimmering intensified, a frantic kaleidoscope of light and workshop air, until, with a final, gut-wrenching lurch, she solidified. She gasped, a deep, shuddering intake of breath that felt like her first.\n\nShe stood there, panting, her limbs trembling with a violent, bone-deep tremor. The world felt too loud, too bright, too solid. The tremor wasn't from cold anymore, but from the shock of re-entry, the psychic whiplash of being ripped from nothingness back into being. She looked at Eamonn, who was frozen in place, the rosary clutched in his fist like a weapon. The disapproval was gone from his face, replaced by an expression of such profound shock and fear that he looked like a stranger. He stared at her, at her solid, breathing, trembling form, and the truth of what he had just witnessed settled over him, heavy and suffocating as a shroud. The lie she lived and the lie he didn't know he was a part of had just been violently eclipsed. He was no longer just her step-brother, or her secret father, or her reluctant guardian. He was now the sole witness to her impossibility.For a long moment, there was no sound but the frantic, tiny clicking of the wooden beads of the rosary against each other in Eamonn\u2019s trembling hand. He stared, his face a mask of waxy disbelief. \"The\u2026 the light,\" he stammered, his voice thin and reedy. \"You were gone. There was just the light on the wall behind you. I put my hand...\" He couldn\u2019t finish the sentence, the physical memory of passing his hand through empty space making him visibly shudder. He took another clumsy step back, his foot crunching on a stray screw on the floor. The raw fear in his eyes was undeniable, but underneath it, a harder, colder emotion was beginning to form, like ice on a winter puddle. It was judgment.\n\nAoife wrapped her arms around herself, a futile attempt to still the violent shaking that wracked her body. The tremors originated from a place too deep to be controlled by muscle alone. \"I don't know,\" she whispered, her voice hoarse and raw. \"Eamonn, I don't know what that was.\" It was the unvarnished truth, but it sounded like a pathetic lie even to her own ears. How could a person not know how they had just ceased to exist for a few moments? The very concept was a nonsense, yet it was her new, terrifying reality. The secret she had been hiding from herself was now out, and it was as incomprehensible to her as it was to him.\n\n\"Don't you lie to me,\" he snarled, the fear finally giving way to a more familiar, blustering anger. It was his shield, just as her sanding block had been hers. \"Not about this. I saw it, Aoife. With my own two eyes. This isn't some trick of the light or a woman's hysteria. This is an abomination. Have you been seeing people? Dabbling in things you shouldn't? The things you read, the solitude\u2026 it turns a person's mind.\" He gestured wildly around the workshop, as if the answer lay in the stacked timber or the jars of pigment. He was desperately building a case, creating a narrative that could contain the horror, a story where she was the guilty party, the one who had invited this darkness into their lives.\n\nThe injustice of it was a physical blow. After the terror, the bone-aching cold, the dizzying vertigo of non-existence, to be met not with concern but with condemnation was a cruelty that burned away the last dregs of her shock. \"Dabbling?\" she repeated, her voice gaining a dangerous edge of disbelief. \"Reading? Is that what you think this is, Eamonn? You think I learned how to do\u2026 *that*\u2026 from a book?\" The sheer absurdity of it, the smallness of his accusation in the face of the cosmic horror she had just experienced, was almost enough to make her laugh. A hysterical, broken sound bubbled in her chest. \"There's no book for this! There's no secret coven! This is happening *to* me!\"\n\n\"Things like this don't just 'happen'!\" he roared, taking a step forward, his bulk seeming to fill the small workshop and suck all the air out. \"God is not mocked! You've opened a door to something, girl, and you need to close it. We need a priest. We need to get this place blessed. You need\u2026\" He stopped, his face contorting as he looked at her, truly looked at her. Not as a problem to be solved or a responsibility to be managed, but as the source of his terror. His daughter. His monstrous, impossible daughter. He looked down at the rosary in his hand, as if it were a talisman that had failed him, then back at her. A new wave of fear, colder and more profound than the first, washed over him. He wasn't equipped for this. No man was.\n\nHe turned then, a jerky, uncoordinated movement, and fled. He didn't say another word, just wrenched the workshop door open, letting in a blinding slice of grey afternoon light, and was gone. The bell jangled frantically, a panicked shriek that slowly faded, leaving Aoife utterly alone. She stood, still shaking, in the sudden, deafening silence of her violated sanctuary. The air still tasted of sawdust and varnish, but now it was laced with the metallic tang of her own fear and the lingering, spectral chill of his. The lie had broken. And the truth, she was beginning to understand, was far more terrifying than she could ever have imagined.The silence that followed his departure was heavier and more absolute than the gloom he had complained about. The frantic jangle of the bell faded, leaving a ringing in Aoife\u2019s ears that was indistinguishable from the thrumming of her own blood. For a full minute, she remained frozen, her arms still wrapped around her torso as if holding herself together by force. She felt impossibly solid, her limbs heavy with lead, her very bones aching with the strain of their sudden reappearance. The phantom chill of the void lingered in her marrow, a deep, internal cold that the familiar warmth of the workshop could not touch. With a slow, deliberate movement that felt like wading through deep water, she walked to the door and pushed it shut. The latch clicked into place with a sound of profound finality, sealing her back inside her violated haven.\n\nShe didn't return to her workbench. Instead, she slid down the rough-plastered wall until she was sitting on the concrete floor, her knees drawn up to her chest amidst a sea of pale wood shavings. She pressed her palms flat against the gritty floor, needing the rough, cold, unyielding proof of it. The workshop had always been her reality, the one place where truth was tangible. Now, it was the scene of an impossible crime against nature, and she was both the victim and the perpetrator. She replayed the sensation, the terrifying lightness, the feeling of being unthreaded, of her physical self dissolving like sugar in water. It wasn't painful. It was worse. It was a complete and total negation. The only thing that had pulled her back from that endless, silent sea was him. His terror had been her anchor. The thought was grotesque, a cruel irony that twisted in her gut. The man whose existence made her want to disappear was the very reason she had been able to come back.\n\nThe mantra. *I'm not here. You can't see me.* It had been a shield, a whisper of defiance against a world that was too much. Against Maura\u2019s smothering worry, against her grandfather\u2019s disappointed scowl, and most of all, against Eamonn. It was always strongest around him, when his presence crowded her, judging the life she had built, the person she had become. He looked at her and saw a failure, a sad spinster hiding from life. He didn't see the artist who could coax stories from dead trees, or the woman who had built a fragile peace for herself from splinters and solitude. He saw only what she wasn't. And in the face of that relentless, unspoken disappointment, her deepest, most primal wish was simply to cease to be an object for his gaze. The wish, it seemed, had been granted.\n\nThe sharp, insistent buzz of her mobile phone on the workbench was a violent assault on the quiet. The screen lit up the gloom with a single, dreaded word: Maura. Of course. Eamonn, a man of simple, frantic action, would have driven straight to his mother's house, the family's designated epicentre of all crisis. He would have burst in, pale and shaking, interrupting her afternoon tea. Aoife could picture it with sickening clarity: his garbled, terrified account of devilry and vanishing acts, of her turning into thin air right before his eyes. And she could picture her mother, her face crumbling, the worry she wore like a second skin flaring into outright panic. The phone buzzed again, a frantic, electronic plea. It was a summons. A demand for an explanation she did not have, for a reassurance she could not possibly give.\n\nAnswering that call was an impossibility. It would be like trying to describe the colour of air to a blind person. The truth was monstrous, and any lie she could concoct would be an insult to the terror he had witnessed. She stared at the phone as it finally fell silent, leaving an even more profound quiet in its wake. Eamonn\u2019s fear had been sharp and loud, but her mother\u2019s would be a different thing entirely. It would be a quiet, suffocating fog of doctors and priests, of whispered consultations and tearful pleas. They would try to fix her. To pray her back to normality, or medicate her, or have her blessed. They would smother her with their fearful, loving concern. She looked around the workshop, at the half-finished wardrobe, at the neat rows of her tools, at the comforting, organised chaos. It was no longer a sanctuary. It was a cage, and the keepers were on their way. He had seen her. The one secret she hadn't even known she was keeping was out, and it would change everything. A cold resolve, hard and clear as glass, settled over her. She couldn't stay. She couldn't be found. The grain of her own existence had proven faulty, warped by a secret she could no longer plane smooth. There was only one thing to do. She had to follow the flaw in the wood and see where it led.The resolve did not bring warmth, but clarity. It was a cold, sharp-edged thing that cut through the fog of panic and left a single, clear path forward. She had to run. She got to her feet, her movements stiff but deliberate, the practiced economy of a person who works with their body every day. The tremors had subsided into a low, internal hum, the vibration of a string pulled too tight. Her mind, so recently a chaotic storm, was now focused on the simple, practical logistics of disappearing.\n\nFirst, money. In a loose-lidded tea caddy marked \u2018Spirits of Turpentine\u2019 she kept her cash, the untaxed earnings from jobs paid for in wrinkled notes. It wasn\u2019t much, a few hundred pounds at most, a pathetic sum to start a new life with. She stuffed the notes into the pocket of her jeans without counting them. Then, her tools. She couldn't take the heavy machinery, the band saw or the lathe that were her livelihood. They were anchors, too heavy for a ghost to carry. Instead, she unstrapped the worn leather roll from the wall, the one her grandfather had given her before his sternness had fully calcified. Inside, nestled in their individual pockets, were her hand tools: the Japanese pull-saws with their impossibly fine teeth, the set of chisels she honed to a mirror finish every Sunday, the small, palm-sized block plane that fit the curve of her hand as if it had been grown there. They were more a part of her than the flesh and blood that had so recently betrayed her. They were her language, her history, her hands. She rolled them up tightly, the familiar weight a small, solid comfort against the terrifying lightness in her soul.\n\nShe pulled on her heavy, wax-cotton jacket, the one that smelled perpetually of damp earth and sawdust. The familiar constraint of it around her shoulders was grounding. She looked around the workshop, her gaze sweeping over the organised chaos. The half-finished wardrobe stood like a patient accusation. A child\u2019s rocking horse, awaiting a final coat of varnish, seemed to watch her with its uncarved eyes. She was leaving a world of unfinished things, of promises she could no longer keep. For a second, a wave of grief so profound it was dizzying washed over her, and she felt the strange, cold tingle in her extremities, the warning tremor of dissolution. She fought it down, her jaw clenched, focusing on the rough texture of the door in front of her. She would not fade here. Not again. She pulled the main breaker, plunging the workshop into a deeper gloom lit only by the grey evening light filtering through the grimy panes. With a final, decisive click, she locked the door from the outside, the sound echoing in the narrow alleyway. Her sanctuary was now her tomb.\n\nThe Belfast air was damp and cold, carrying the distant scent of the lough and the closer, more acrid smell of traffic. She pulled her hood up, burying her face in its shadow, and began to walk. The colossal yellow heads of Samson and Goliath were stark against the bruised purple of the twilight sky. They had watched over her entire life, silent witnesses to the city's agonies and its fragile peace. Tonight, they felt like sentinels at the gate of a prison she was finally escaping. She walked quickly, sticking to the backstreets, her boots crunching on broken glass in the unlit alleyways. Every distant siren, every pair of approaching headlights, sent a fresh jolt of adrenaline through her. She imagined Eamonn\u2019s car cruising the streets, or her mother, frantic, already out searching. The city, her home, had become a web, and she was the fly desperately trying to reach its edge without alerting the spider.\n\nAs she passed a row of terraced houses, their windows glowing with the warm, ordinary light of other people\u2019s lives, a wave of profound otherness washed over her. A man laughed inside one of the houses, a deep, hearty sound, and the noise seemed to pass right through her. Panic flared, cold and sharp. She glanced down at her hand as she shoved it deeper into her jacket pocket and saw, for a terrifying half-second, the faint, ghostly image of the brick wall through her own knuckles. It was like looking through smoked glass. She squeezed her fist tight, her short nails digging into her palm, focusing on the sharp, real points of pain. *Solid*, she thought, the word a desperate prayer. *I am solid. I am here.* The transparency receded, the flesh and bone of her hand reasserting their dominance, but she was left breathless, a fine sheen of cold sweat on her brow. The power, or the curse, was not a switch she could flip. It was a fault line running through her, ready to crack at any moment.\n\nThe Europa Buscentre was an island of harsh, fluorescent light and restless motion. It smelled of diesel fumes, stale coffee, and the faint, collective anxiety of departure. Here, faces were transient, gazes turned inward or fixed on the flickering departure boards. No one looked at her. The anonymity she craved was a physical cloak she could pull tighter around herself. She stood before the list of destinations, a litany of unfamiliar towns and distant cities. Dublin. Derry. Galway. London. Each name was a potential future, a blank page. The choice felt momentous and utterly arbitrary. A bus was boarding for Dublin, its engine a low, impatient rumble in the bay outside. It was leaving in ten minutes. It was south. It was across a border. It was away. That was enough. She walked to the ticket window, her movements stiff, and pushed a few of the crumpled notes from her pocket under the glass. \"One way,\" she said, her voice a stranger's croak. \"To Dublin.\" The ticket that slid back was a flimsy, tangible piece of her escape. It was the first honest thing she had held all day.The bus was warm and smelled of stale air freshener and damp coats. Aoife found a seat by a window two-thirds of the way down, sinking into the worn velour with a sigh that was part exhaustion, part relief. She pressed her forehead against the cool glass, watching the organised chaos of the station through the rain-streaked pane. Passengers hurried past, pulling wheeled cases, saying their goodbyes with tight hugs or casual waves. Each one of them seemed anchored to the world by a thousand invisible threads of connection and purpose. She, by contrast, felt like a spectre already, haunting the edge of their reality, her only connection the flimsy paper ticket clutched in her pocket. The heavy roll of her tools rested on the seat beside her, a solid, reassuring weight that was the only piece of her old life she had allowed herself to keep.\n\nAs the bus lurched into motion, pulling away from the bay with a hydraulic hiss, a fresh wave of panic threatened to crest. She was doing it. She was actually leaving. The bus navigated the wet city streets, the familiar landmarks of her life sliding past the window like stills from a film she was no longer in. The grand, soot-stained fa\u00e7ade of City Hall, the bright lights of the Cathedral Quarter, the dark, brooding mass of the Albert Clock. Then, as they climbed onto the motorway, she saw them. Samson and Goliath, their colossal yellow forms floodlit against the ink-black sky, standing their eternal vigil over the shipyards. They had been the backdrop to her entire existence, the silent gods of her hometown. Seeing them now, shrinking in the distance, felt like a final, profound farewell. She had not realised until this moment how much they had felt like family, their steadfastness a silent reproach to the shifting, unstable foundations of her own. She watched until they were just two yellow pins pricking the darkness, and then they were gone.\n\nThe darkness of the motorway swallowed them. The rhythmic thrum of the engine and the swish of the wipers became a hypnotic mantra, lulling her into a state of weary introspection. Eamonn\u2019s terrified face swam in her vision, his accusation \u2013 *What devilry is this?* \u2013 echoing in the space between heartbeats. It was easier to process his fear than her mother\u2019s impending grief. Eamonn\u2019s reaction was primal, superstitious, but Maura\u2019s would be a tangled, suffocating web of love and worry and failure. She would blame herself. She would see Aoife\u2019s flight and her impossible affliction as a punishment for the original sin, the lie they had built their lives upon. The secret of Aoife\u2019s birth was a fault line running through their family, and now, it seemed, through the very fabric of Aoife\u2019s being. Was this it? Was this strange, terrifying dissolution a physical manifestation of her own illegitimate existence? A life built on a lie was perhaps not a life at all, just a temporary placeholder, easily erased.\n\nThe thought was so cold, so bleak, that it triggered the feeling again. It began as a faint tingling in her fingertips, a coolness spreading up her arms not from the window but from within. She looked down at her hands, resting on the worn denim of her jeans, and saw the dark fabric of the seat beneath them, faint but undeniable, as if she were made of murky water. Her breath hitched. Not now. Not here, trapped in a metal tube hurtling through the Irish night, surrounded by strangers. She shut her eyes, her mind scrambling for an anchor. The tools. The scent of linseed oil. The grain of the oak. She focused on the memory of wood running under her palm, its silent, honest history. She pictured the tight, concentric rings of a life lived, the fat years and the lean. It was a language she understood, a truth she could hold on to. *The wood is real*, she chanted internally, a desperate litany against the void. *The grain is true. I am solid. I am here.* She gripped the edge of her seat, her knuckles white, pouring all her concentration into the feeling of the rough fabric, the vibration of the bus, anything to tether her to the physical world. Slowly, agonizingly, the transparency receded, leaving her hands looking pale and bloodless, but blessedly, completely solid. She slumped back in her seat, trembling and clammy with sweat, the casual snores of the man in the seat across the aisle a bizarre counterpoint to the existential battle she had just fought and barely won.\n\nThey crossed the border without ceremony. There were no guards, no checkpoints, just a subtle change in the road signs, the miles turning to kilometres. Yet for Aoife, it felt like crossing an ocean. She had left the North. She had left the United Kingdom. She was in a different country, a different jurisdiction. Eamonn couldn't just turn up at her door here. Maura couldn't have her sectioned. They might not even look for her here. It was a flimsy shield, but it was the only one she had. As the bus drew closer to Dublin, the spidery web of motorways grew more complex, the lights of distant housing estates multiplying in the darkness. The anonymity that had been a concept in the Belfast bus station was about to become a stark, overwhelming reality. She was a stranger here, with a few hundred pounds, a roll of priceless tools, and a secret that was actively trying to unmake her.\n\nThe bus finally hissed to a stop in the cavernous, brightly-lit belly of Bus\u00e1ras, Dublin\u2019s central station. The sudden silence after the long journey was jarring. Passengers stretched, gathered their belongings, and shuffled towards the exit with the weary purpose of travellers who have arrived. Aoife remained in her seat for a moment, gathering her courage. Stepping off this bus was stepping into the unknown. She slung the heavy tool roll over her shoulder, the familiar weight a small comfort, and joined the stream of people heading out into the city. The air that hit her was different from Belfast\u2019s; softer, damper, thick with the smell of the Liffey and exhaust fumes. The noise was a constant, multi-layered roar of traffic, sirens, and the indistinct clamour of a thousand conversations. She stood on the pavement, a small, hooded figure buffeted by the current of late-night city life, utterly and terrifyingly alone. She had vanished from her old life, but the real test, she knew, was whether she could manage to exist in a new one.The current of people flowed around her, an urban river parting around a stone. Aoife stood rooted to the pavement outside Bus\u00e1ras, the heavy tool roll digging into her shoulder, a single point of familiar, painful reality. Dublin roared around her, a symphony of sounds she couldn't parse. The shriek of a Luas tram on its tracks, the melodic lilt of accents she wasn't tuned to, the percussive slam of a pub door releasing a wave of laughter and music into the damp night. It was all alien. Belfast\u2019s sounds were her own, a language she knew by heart; the growl of the city was a familiar beast. This was a different animal entirely, and she didn\u2019t know its nature, whether it would bite or ignore her completely. Her first instinct, born of a lifetime of keeping her head down, was to find shadow. She crossed the street, away from the harsh lights of the station, and began to walk, her direction chosen by a simple, desperate logic: away from the main thoroughfare, into the quieter, less conspicuous veins of the city.\n\nShe walked for what felt like an hour, her path a nervous, zigzagging route through a labyrinth of Georgian streets and modern glass-fronted offices. The city\u2019s structure was different here. The red brick uniformity of Belfast\u2019s terraces was replaced by a grander, if sometimes shabbier, elegance. Tall, narrow houses with brightly painted doors and ornate fanlights stood shoulder-to-shoulder, their upper windows dark and watchful. It was a city built on a different scale, with a different history etched into its bones. She felt her smallness, her utter irrelevance. It was what she had wanted, but the reality of it was a cold, hollow ache in her chest. Every passing Garda car made her flinch, her shoulders tightening under her jacket. Every group of laughing students felt like a jury. She was a foreign body, an impurity in the city\u2019s bloodstream, and she felt certain that at any moment, it would move to expel her.\n\nThe need for a roof was becoming urgent, a primal command overriding the fear. The damp cold was seeping through her jacket, and the exhaustion, held at bay for hours by adrenaline, was beginning to descend like a physical weight. She started looking for signs, her eyes scanning the doorways and basement windows for the tell-tale cursive of a B&B or the stark lettering of a hostel. She passed several, brightly lit and modern, their windows displaying credit card signs and tourist board accolades. She shied away from them instinctively. They were too clean, too official. They would want a credit card, a passport, a piece of identity she was no longer sure she possessed. Finally, on a quieter side street branching off a larger square, she saw it. A single, weakly illuminated sign that simply read \u2018Rooms\u2019. The paint was peeling from the black door and the brass number was tarnished, but it looked blessedly, beautifully anonymous.\n\nTaking a deep, unsteadying breath, she pushed the door. It opened into a narrow hallway that smelled of stale cigarette smoke, boiled cabbage, and damp carpet. A bare bulb hanging from a frayed flex cast a jaundiced light on the floral wallpaper, its pattern faded into brownish ambiguity. At the end of the hall, a small window slid open, revealing a woman with a cloud of dyed red hair and a face that looked like it had been set in a permanent expression of weary suspicion.\n\u201cCan I help you?\u201d the woman asked, her voice a gravelly Dublin rasp.\n\nThe simple question was a hurdle. Aoife\u2019s mouth was dry. She cleared her throat, the sound loud in the quiet hall. \u201cHave you a room? Just for one. For the night.\u201d\n\nThe woman\u2019s eyes travelled over her, taking in the hooded jacket, the grubby jeans, the heavy, odd-looking roll slung over her shoulder. It was the kind of scrutiny that made Aoife\u2019s skin crawl, the kind that made her want to fade. She felt a faint, familiar tingle at the base of her skull and dug her fingernails into her palm, inside her pocket. *Solid. Real. Just a girl looking for a room.* \u201cForty euro. In advance. And no visitors.\u201d\n\nAoife nodded, relief making her dizzy. She fumbled in her pocket for the crumpled notes, her fingers clumsy with cold. She pushed two twenties through the little window. \u201cDo you need a name?\u201d she asked, her voice barely a whisper.\n\nThe woman snorted, a short, sharp sound of amusement. \u201cI\u2019m not your mammy, love. As long as the cash is real, you can be the Queen of Sheba for all I care.\u201d She took a key with a heavy brass fob from a hook behind her and slid it across the worn wooden counter. \u201cNumber seven. Top of the stairs, to the back. Bathroom\u2019s on the landing. Don\u2019t be making a racket.\u201d The window slid shut with a decisive thud, the transaction complete.\n\nThe room was small and cold, containing a narrow iron-frame bed, a single wooden chair, and a small, scarred wardrobe whose door hung slightly ajar. A single window, its sash warped, looked out over a dark, rain-slicked alleyway cluttered with overflowing bins. It was a perfect, miserable little box, a cell of anonymity, and she had never been so grateful to be in a place in her life. She dropped the tool roll onto the bed \u2013 the thud of it on the thin mattress the first solid, reassuring sound she had made since arriving \u2013 and locked the door. The lock was flimsy, but turning the key felt like a sacred rite, a definitive act of separation. She was sealed in. She was safe, for now.\n\nShe sank onto the edge of the bed, the springs groaning in protest. The overwhelming reality of her situation descended on her, no longer a frantic panic but a deep, crushing weight. She had run. She had left her home, her life, her mother. A wave of guilt, sharp and sickening, rose in her throat. She saw Maura\u2019s face, not angry, but stricken, her eyes wide with a pain Aoife had just inflicted. And Eamonn. His terror had been her anchor, but his accusation was now a brand on her. *What in God\u2019s name are you?* The question echoed in the silent, shabby room. She didn\u2019t know. She was a carpenter who could no longer trust the substance of her own hands. She was a daughter who had orphaned her mother. She was a secret that had become a monster. And she was utterly, terrifyingly alone in a room at the top of a strange house, in a city that didn't know she existed, with the impossible truth of herself a sickness in her bones.Sleep was a country she was afraid to enter without a passport. Her exhausted body craved it, the leaden pull of it in her limbs a desperate plea for oblivion. But oblivion was a state she had just narrowly escaped, and she could not be certain she would be able to find her way back from an unguarded, unconscious version of it. What if, in the depths of sleep, when the mind\u2019s desperate grip on reality loosened, she simply\u2026 unraveled? Would she wake up as a shimmering outline on the thin, stained mattress, a conscious thought with no body to inhabit? The terror of that possibility was a sharp, cold spike that drove all thoughts of rest away. She sat on the edge of the bed for a long time, listening to the unfamiliar sounds of the city outside and the groans of the old house around her, a sentry guarding the fragile borders of her own existence.\n\nEventually, the need for some tether to the person she used to be became overwhelming. She placed the heavy leather roll on the thin blanket and carefully untied the straps. The scent that arose from it was the first truly familiar thing she had encountered in hours \u2013 the ghosts of a hundred different woods, the sharp metallic tang of honed steel, and the rich, nutty smell of linseed oil. It was the scent of her sanity. One by one, she took the tools out, her calloused fingertips tracing the familiar shapes in the dim light. The Japanese saw with its tiger-stripe burn marks on the handle. The old mortise chisel with the mushroomed top from a thousand careful mallet blows. The rosewood handle of her favourite plane, worn smooth and dark with the sweat and oils of her own hand. They were not just objects; they were extensions of her will, the physical manifestation of her knowledge. They were real. She arranged them on the bed beside her, a silent, steely congregation, their solidity a fortress against the formless fear that lapped at her mind. Only then, with her hand resting on the cool, unyielding steel of a chisel handle, did she allow herself to lie back, curling into a tight, defensive ball, and fall into a shallow, haunted doze.\n\nShe woke with a jolt, her heart hammering against her ribs. For a disorienting second, she didn't know where she was. The light was wrong \u2013 a weak, watery grey filtering through a dirty window, illuminating a ceiling stained with the ghost of an old water leak. Then it came rushing back: the bus, the flight, the anonymous room. Her first conscious thought was a frantic, internal question: *Am I here?* She flung a hand to her face, pressing her palm hard against her cheek. The solid resistance of bone, the rough texture of her own skin, the warmth of her own blood. She was solid. She was whole. She let out a breath she hadn\u2019t realised she was holding, a ragged sob of pure, unadulterated relief. The terror of the night receded, leaving behind the grittier, more mundane fear of the day ahead. From the hallway came the sound of a door closing, heavy footsteps on the stairs, and the gurgle of ancient pipes as a toilet flushed. The house was alive with other people, other lives, and their ordinary morning routines were a bizarrely comforting proof that the world had not, in fact, ended during the night.\n\nThe brief comfort evaporated as the stark reality of her finances asserted itself. She sat up and took the crumpled wad of notes from her pocket, smoothing them out on the bedspread. After paying for the bus ticket and the room, she had just over two hundred euro left. It was nothing. A week's rent, maybe two, if she ate next to nothing. A cold knot of practical dread tightened in her stomach, a fear almost as visceral as the fading. She was a master carpenter, a creator of beautiful, functional things that people paid good money for, yet here she was, in a strange city, functionally destitute. The idea of walking into a joinery shop, her roll of tools over her shoulder, and asking for work was unthinkable. It meant questions. It meant names, addresses, a past. It meant engaging with a system she was desperately trying to escape. And what if the stress of a new job, of being watched and judged by a new boss, triggered an episode? The thought of dissolving into transparency in a workshop full of strangers, surrounded by spinning blades and heavy machinery, was a new and specific kind of horror.\n\nShe needed to work, but she could not be seen to be working. The contradiction sat in the middle of the room like an unsolvable riddle. She stood and walked to the window, peering down into the grimy alleyway. A cook from a nearby restaurant emerged for a smoke, his white uniform stained, his face weary. He didn't look up. He was in his own world, a small, self-contained bubble of routine. Anonymity, she realised, was a two-way street. Just as she was invisible to them, so too were the city\u2019s hidden corners and quiet desperations invisible to the main flow of traffic. There was work in a city this old. There were always broken things. A sticking drawer in a Georgian sideboard, a loose spindle on a staircase, a warped window frame in a house just like this one. Small jobs. Cash jobs. Jobs that wouldn't require a tax number or a curriculum vitae. Jobs that would let her slip in, fix the problem, and slip out again, a ghost who left behind only the quiet satisfaction of a perfectly repaired joint. It was a fragile, half-formed plan, but it was a plan. She had to become a different kind of craftswoman, not one who built new things from scratch, but one who mended the broken pieces of the old world, quietly, in the shadows.The fragile plan, forged in the pre-dawn desperation, demanded action. It was a terrifying prospect, but it was infinitely better than the passive, waiting dread that had colonised her since she\u2019d arrived. Action was a form of solidity. She dressed with purpose, pulling on the same clothes from the day before, their faint smell of fear and travel a grim reminder of how far she had fallen. She placed the roll of tools back in the scarred wardrobe, locking it with a key that was surely a century old, before locking her room behind her. Descending the creaking stairs and stepping out into the brisk Dublin morning felt like a deep-sea diver surfacing for air. The city was grey and business-like, its citizens striding along the pavements with a purpose that Aoife decided to mimic, burying her fear beneath a mask of focused intent. Her anonymity was her shield, and she clutched it tight as she navigated the unfamiliar streets in search of her first necessity: a new voice.\n\nShe found what she was looking for in a small, cluttered shop on a back street, its window crowded with second-hand phones and garish accessories. Inside, a young man with headphones barely looked up as she pointed to the cheapest pay-as-you-go phone on display. The transaction was swift and blessedly impersonal. He took her cash, handed her the small plastic box, and returned to his screen. She was just another faceless customer, her request unremarkable. Armed with her new, untraceable lifeline, she found a newsagent and bought a notepad and a pack of black pens. Back in the cold sanctuary of her room, she sat at the wobbly chair and began to compose her new identity. Her handwriting, usually the precise, angular script of a draftsperson, was deliberately simplified, rendered anonymous. She wrote out a dozen small, rectangular notices. *'Carpenter. Woodwork Repairs. Furniture, doors, windows. No job too small. Fast, reliable. Call Aoife.'* She hesitated for a long moment on the name. Using her own felt like a reckless risk, a breadcrumb leading back to her old life. But to use another name felt like a different kind of lie, a deeper level of self-erasure she wasn't ready for. She compromised, omitting a surname, leaving just the single, common Irish name. It was a calculated risk, a small bet on the vastness of the city's indifference.\n\nThe rest of the morning was spent in a strange, purposeful pilgrimage through the city\u2019s quieter residential neighbourhoods. She avoided the polished, affluent streets where people would simply buy new rather than repair old. Instead, she sought out the areas of faded grandeur, of student flats and old-age pensioners, where things were made to last because they had to. In a steamy laundrette, she pinned a notice to the corkboard crammed with ads for cleaning services and guitar lessons. In a small, family-run grocer\u2019s, she added her note to a constellation of babysitting offers and rooms to let. Each pin she pushed through the paper was an act of terrifying hope. She was casting messages in bottles into an urban sea, praying one would find a friendly shore. With each notice she posted, she felt a fresh spike of adrenaline, a feeling of being watched, even when the street was empty. She was making herself visible, however slightly, and it went against every instinct that was screaming at her to remain buried. By midday, her messages were scattered across a half-dozen different postcodes, a tiny, invisible web spun from fear and necessity.\n\nBack in her room, the waiting began. It was a suffocating, silent ordeal. The new phone sat on the rickety bedside table, a black, plastic rectangle of pure potential, both a promise and a threat. Every creak of the floorboards in the hallway, every distant siren, made her jump. The city\u2019s noise, which had been a comforting blanket of anonymity when she was in motion, was now a source of endless, nervous speculation. Was that a police car? Was that Eamonn\u2019s voice in the street below? She knew it was paranoia, but the fear was a physical presence in the room with her, cold and heavy. The hours crawled by. She paced the small space, her boots tracing a worn path in the thin carpet. She took her tools out again, not to work, but just to hold them, the familiar weight of a chisel or the smooth curve of a plane a temporary balm to her frayed nerves. She could feel the fragile edges of herself begin to shimmer with the stress and the inactivity, the terrible lightness returning to her limbs. She fought it back, focusing on the hard, real world, on the fifty euro note left in her pocket, on the grimy pattern of the wallpaper, on the silent, mocking stillness of the phone.\n\nIt rang at four o\u2019clock in the afternoon, its shrill, unfamiliar trill so sudden and violent it was like a physical blow. Aoife gasped, dropping the small block plane she had been holding onto the bed. It landed with a soft thud on the lumpy mattress. The phone buzzed and shrieked again, an insistent, alien summons. Her heart hammered against her ribs, a frantic, trapped bird. For a terrible second, she couldn't move, her hand hovering over the device, paralysed by the sheer, terrifying possibility of it. It could be anyone. It could be a wrong number. It could be Maura, having somehow, impossibly, tracked her down. It could be a trap. It rang a third time. Steeling herself, she snatched it up and pressed the green button, her thumb trembling. \"Hello?\" she said, her voice a dry, reedy croak she barely recognised.\n\n\"Hello? Is that the carpenter?\" The voice was female, elderly, with the distinctive, melodic cadence of old Dublin. It was hesitant, but kind. Relief washed over Aoife so intensely her knees felt weak.\n\"Yes,\" she managed, her voice a little stronger. \"Yes, this is she.\"\n\"Oh, grand. I saw your notice in the shop on Camden Street. I hope I'm not disturbing you. My name is O'Connell. Fionnuala O'Connell.\" The woman paused, as if expecting a response.\n\"Not at all,\" Aoife said quickly, sitting on the edge of the bed. \"How can I help you, Mrs. O'Connell?\"\n\"Well, it's my mother's old wardrobe. A lovely thing, mahogany, but the door has swollen in the damp, you see. It hasn't closed properly in years, and my son-in-law had a go at it and I think he's only made it worse.\" There was a weary sigh. \"I was wondering if it's the sort of thing you'd look at. It's a small job, I know.\"\n\"It's exactly the sort of thing I do,\" Aoife said, a flicker of her old professional confidence returning. The problem was familiar, a straightforward piece of joinery. It was a sentence in a language she understood. She took down the address, a street just a ten-minute walk away. As she ended the call, she sat in the silence, the phone still clutched in her hand. It was real. A stranger had seen her sign, had believed it, and had called. She was no longer just a fugitive. She was a carpenter again.\n\nThe walk to Mrs. O\u2019Connell\u2019s house was a journey through a different kind of fear. The paranoia of being hunted was replaced by the more immediate, practical anxiety of the unknown client. She clutched the strap of her tool roll, the weight on her shoulder both a burden and a comfort. The address was a tall, red-brick terraced house, its paintwork faded but its brass knocker polished to a warm gleam. It was a house that had been cared for. Taking a breath, she knocked. The door was opened by a small, stooped woman with flyaway white hair and eyes that were a startling, bright blue. She was exactly as her voice had sounded: frail, but with a spark of formidable intelligence. \"You must be Aoife,\" she said with a warm smile. \"You're younger than I expected. Come in, come in out of the cold.\" Aoife stepped over the threshold into a hallway filled with the scent of beeswax and old paper. The house was crowded with dark furniture, stacks of books, and framed photographs. It felt lived-in, a repository of a long and full life. It was so achingly normal, so deeply rooted in family and history, that it made Aoife\u2019s own rootlessness feel like a physical wound.\n\nMrs. O'Connell led her upstairs to a bedroom where the offending wardrobe stood, a large, handsome piece of Victorian mahogany. As the old woman had said, one of its doors stood stubbornly ajar by a good inch, refusing to meet the frame. Aoife ran a hand over the wood, her fingers instinctively seeking the source of the problem. She could feel the slight warp in the panel, see the scored marks near the hinges where the son-in-law had made his clumsy attempt at a fix. \"He meant well,\" Mrs. O'Connell said, as if reading her mind. \"But he's an accountant. His tools are spreadsheets.\" Aoife allowed herself a small, ghost of a smile. \"I'll need to take the door off,\" she said, her voice quiet and professional. \"It won't take long.\" The old woman nodded, her bright eyes watching with sharp curiosity. \"I'll put the kettle on,\" she said, before shuffling out and leaving Aoife alone with her work. In the quiet of the room, with the familiar weight of a screwdriver in her hand, the world contracted to the simple, honest reality of the task. The fear receded. The noise in her head went quiet. There was only her, the wood, and the problem.\n\nShe worked with a silent, focused grace. The heavy door came off the hinges with a practiced lift and was laid carefully on an old blanket she\u2019d asked for. Her diagnosis was swift. The frame had absorbed years of Dublin damp, swelling just enough to throw the whole geometry off. The son-in-law\u2019s mistake had been to try and force the hinges, scarring the wood in the process. Aoife chose her smallest, sharpest hand plane from the roll. The tool felt like an extension of her own hand. She set the blade to take the finest of shavings, gossamer-thin curls of dark, fragrant mahogany that fell to the blanket like dried petals. It was a process of listening to the wood, of feeling the resistance, of knowing exactly how much to take and where. She worked not by measurement, but by feel, her calloused fingertips her most sensitive guide. The rhythmic *shhhh-shhhh* of the plane was the only sound, a quiet, meditative prayer. In that moment, she wasn't a runaway or a phenomenon. She wasn't her mother's secret or Eamonn's terror. She was simply a craftswoman, coaxing a piece of obstinate history back into alignment. It was a feeling of competence and control so profound it was almost dizzying. This was her truth. This was her solid ground.\n\nAfter twenty minutes of careful shaving and testing, she was ready. She cleaned the shavings from the blanket, re-hung the heavy door on its hinges, and gave it a gentle push. It swung silently and clicked perfectly shut, its surface now flush with the frame. A deep, quiet satisfaction bloomed in Aoife\u2019s chest. It was a small victory, but it felt monumental. Mrs. O'Connell appeared in the doorway, a mug of tea in her hand, her eyes wide. \"Saints be praised,\" she breathed, walking forward to run a wrinkled hand over the closed door. \"I haven't seen it shut properly since my husband passed. How on earth did you do that?\" \"I just listened to what it needed,\" Aoife said simply. The woman looked from the wardrobe to Aoife's face, her gaze shrewd but kind. \"You have good hands,\" she said. \"Quiet hands.\" She insisted on paying Aoife sixty euro, more than Aoife would have dared to ask for. She pressed the notes into Aoife's palm, her dry, papery skin a brief, warm touch. \"Thank you, dear. It's more than just a door, you know.\" Aoife nodded, understanding completely. As she walked away from the house, the cash a warm, solid reality in her pocket, the setting sun casting long shadows down the street, she felt a flicker of something she hadn't felt in a long, long time. It wasn't happiness, not yet. But it was a foothold. It was proof that a ghost could still leave a mark on the world, even if it was just the quiet, satisfying click of a perfectly closed door.The sixty euro felt like a shield. Walking back through the darkening Dublin streets, Aoife kept her hand in her pocket, her fingers curled around the three warm, crisp notes. It was more than just money; it was proof. It was tangible evidence that her skills still had value, that she could still impose order on a chaotic world, even if her own existence felt like it was coming apart at the seams. The walk back to the guesthouse was different this time. She looked up, noticing the intricate patterns of the ironwork on a balcony, the deep carving on a stone lintel. Before, she had only seen threats and shadows; now, she was seeing the city\u2019s grain, the marks of other craftspeople who had come before her. The fear had not vanished, but it had retreated to the background, a low hum beneath the more immediate, satisfying thrum of competence. Back in her small, cold room, she did not immediately hide. She laid the money on the bedside table next to the phone, a small, proud offering to the god of survival. She felt the solid floor beneath her feet, the rough texture of the blanket on the bed, and for the first time since she had fled Belfast, she felt a flicker of hope that was more than just the absence of terror.\n\nThe phone rang twice the next day. The first call was from a student living in a sprawling flat in Rathmines, needing a kitchen cabinet door re-hung. The second was from a man with a soft County Clare accent who had a wobbly leg on an old pine table he\u2019d bought at a market. Both jobs were simple, straightforward applications of her knowledge, small acts of restoration that took less than an hour each. She moved through these brief encounters like a wraith, her voice quiet, her movements efficient. She learned to read her clients quickly, offering a brief, polite smile to the chatty student but maintaining a respectful, professional silence with the quiet man from Clare. They saw a quiet, capable young woman who was good with her hands and charged a fair price. They did not see the fugitive, the walking impossibility who checked her own hands for transparency every half-hour. With each successful job, each handful of cash pressed into her palm, the hum of fear grew quieter. She was building a routine, a fragile scaffolding of normalcy around the void at her core. She found a small bakery that sold day-old bread for next to nothing, and a fruit stand that had a box of bruised but edible apples. She ate in her room, listening to the city outside, hoarding her money, her world shrinking to the size of her small room and the brief, contained orbits of her jobs. For three days, this was her life. It was a spartan, lonely existence, but it was solid. She was earning her place in the world, one repaired joint at a time.\n\nThe call that changed things came on a grey, drizzly Friday afternoon. The voice on the phone was different from the others. It was a man, his voice a low growl, impatient and devoid of pleasantries. \u201cYou the carpenter? The one that fixes things?\u201d he asked, without preamble.\n\u201cYes,\u201d Aoife said, her hand tightening on the phone.\n\u201cGot a doorframe in my pub needs sorting. Got kicked in last week. The Garda\u00ed have been and gone, but the frame\u2019s a mess and it\u2019s letting a draft in that\u2019d cut you in two. Can you fix it or not?\u201d\nA pub. A public space, full of noise and people, of unpredictable variables. It was everything she had been trying to avoid. Her first instinct was to say no, to make an excuse. But the bluntness of his request was a challenge, and the thought of the money, more than she would make from a wobbly chair, was a powerful lure. The fear of destitution was, for the moment, stronger than the fear of discovery. \u201cI can fix it,\u201d she said, her voice firmer than she felt.\n\u201cRight. The Auld Triangle, just off Capel Street. Come now if you can. I\u2019m not paying you to look at it.\u201d The line went dead.\n\nThe Auld Triangle was a corner pub, its windows dark with decades of grime and nicotine. Pushing through the heavy door was like stepping into another era. The air was thick with the smell of stale beer, woodsmoke from a small, smouldering fire, and the sharp scent of whiskey. It was early afternoon, but a handful of old men were already installed at the bar, nursing pints of stout in a companionable silence, their conversation a low, sporadic murmur. The man who had called was behind the bar, a large, thick-set man with a florid face and suspicious eyes, wiping a glass with a dirty cloth. He gave her a long, hard look, his gaze taking in her slight frame and the heavy tool roll. \u201cYou\u2019re her?\u201d he grumbled, his expression a mask of doubt. Aoife just nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s over here,\u201d he said, gesturing with his head towards a door at the back that presumably led to a storeroom or cellar. The damage was exactly as he\u2019d described. The lock-side of the doorjamb was split, the wood splintered and pushed out of true where a heavy boot had connected with it. It was a nasty, violent wound in the old wood. More than that, it was a job that couldn\u2019t be done in twenty minutes. It would require careful cutting, gluing, and clamping. It would take time. It would mean being here, in this public space, for hours.\n\nShe set to work, trying to build a wall of concentration around herself. She knelt on the dusty floorboards, laying her tools out on the leather roll, the familiar shapes a small comfort. But the environment was an assault on her senses. The low drone of conversation from the bar, the sudden crash of a glass being washed, the sharp clang of the old-fashioned till. Every sound was an intrusion. She could feel the publican\u2019s eyes on her from behind the bar, his occasional glances a heavy weight on the back of her neck. The old men watched her too, their curiosity piqued by the novelty of a woman on her knees with a set of tools. She tried to block it out, to focus on the splintered wood in front of her. She used a sharp chisel to pare away the damaged fibres, her movements precise, but her hands felt clumsy, her focus splintered. A man at the bar laughed, a loud, braying sound that reminded her, with a sickening jolt, of a cousin of Eamonn\u2019s. The memory was a key in a lock. The familiar cold started in her stomach, a sickening, icy plunge. *Not here,* she pleaded silently. *Please, not now.*\n\nShe looked down at her left hand, the one bracing the doorframe. The wood grain of the floorboards was suddenly visible through her knuckles, a faint, watery superimposition. Her breath caught in her throat. The sounds of the pub began to warp, the low chatter slowing into a distorted, demonic drawl. The warmth from the small fire vanished, replaced by the profound, internal cold of the void. Panic, cold and absolute, seized her. She was dissolving, right here, on the floor of a Dublin pub, in full view of a handful of strangers. She fumbled for a clamp on her tool roll, her fingers feeling clumsy and disconnected, her grip uncertain. The heavy iron clamp slipped from her grasp, hitting the wooden floor with a loud, ringing clatter that seemed to echo in the suddenly distorted space. Every head at the bar turned towards the noise. The publican stared at her, his suspicious expression sharpening into something more like alarm. \"Everything alright over there?\" he called out, his voice sounding like it was coming from the end of a long tunnel. Aoife couldn\u2019t answer. She was staring at the space where her hand had been, a shimmering, translucent outline against the dark wood, her own skin and bone no more substantial than a heat haze.The terror was a physical thing, a glass bell descending over her, muting the world. The publican\u2019s question, \u201cEverything alright over there?\u201d, was a dull, droning sound from another room, a query directed at a person who was no longer entirely there. Aoife stared at her own hand, a phantom limb rendered in smoke and dust motes, the dark grain of the floorboards clearly visible through her palm and fingers. The cold was absolute, a black hole of sensation that had swallowed the warmth of the fire, the life of the room, leaving only a clinical, terrifying awareness. This was it. This was the moment of discovery. Her fragile, secret life was about to be shattered on the floor of a dingy pub, witnessed by a jury of strangers who would see not a woman in distress, but an aberration, a monster.\n\nHer mind, a screaming chaos a second before, went utterly blank. In its place, a single, primal instinct surfaced: *Pain is real.* Before she could think, before she could weigh the consequences, she acted. With a strangled gasp that was half-sob, half-war cry, she slammed her other hand \u2013 her solid, flesh-and-blood right hand \u2013 down onto the rough, uneven floorboards beside her. The impact was a nauseating crunch of bone and flesh on wood. A white-hot, electric shock of agony shot up her arm, so pure and absolute it eclipsed everything else. For a dizzying, heart-stopping second, there was only the pain. It was a searing, brilliant light in the cold darkness of the void, a single, undeniable point of reality. The world snapped back into focus with the force of a physical blow. The distorted drone of the pub resolved into sharp, distinct sounds: the gentle fizz of a pint being pulled, the murmur of a television in the corner, the sudden, concerned silence of the men at the bar. The phantom cold receded, chased back by the hot, throbbing bloom of agony in her palm. She was solid. She was excruciatingly, gratefully solid.\n\nPanting, her vision swimming with black spots from the sheer shock of the pain, she cradled her injured hand to her chest. A long, thin splinter of wood was embedded in the fleshy part of her palm, a dark line in the rapidly swelling and reddening skin. Tears of pain and relief streamed down her face. The publican, Declan, was there now, looming over her, his face a mixture of alarm and annoyance. \"Jesus, Mary and Joseph, girl, what was that all about?\" he demanded, his voice a low growl. One of the old men had half-risen from his stool, his pint held forgotten in his hand. Aoife shook her head, unable to form words, the lie catching in her throat. She just pointed a trembling finger at her other hand, the one that had been fading, and gave a weak, shuddering gasp. \"Felt... faint,\" she whispered, the words thin and reedy. \"Dizzy... I dropped the clamp.\" It was a pathetic, flimsy excuse, but her genuine distress, the tears, the visible pain of her self-inflicted wound, sold it better than any actor could. She looked pale, fragile, and utterly out of her depth.\n\nDeclan let out a long, exasperated sigh, the suspicion in his eyes softening slightly into a gruff, reluctant concern. \"For God's sake,\" he muttered, running a hand over his bald head. He looked from her ashen face to the splintered doorframe and back again. \"Right. That's it. You're not working like this. You'll take a chunk out of yourself with a chisel.\" He turned to the bar. \"Paddy, get her a glass of water. And put a bit of sugar in it,\" he barked at one of the old men, who shuffled to obey. Declan crouched down, his knees cracking, peering at her hand. \"That's a nasty one. You need to get that seen to.\" He looked at her, his expression unreadable. \"I thought you said you were a carpenter. You look like a strong wind would knock you over.\" The words were critical, but they lacked the venom of Eamonn\u2019s accusations. He was not afraid of her; he was just annoyed by her, by this complication, this feminine frailty disrupting the masculine order of his pub.\n\nThe humiliation was a fresh wave of sickness. He was right. She had failed. The pub, with its unpredictable rhythms and constant scrutiny, was a hostile environment, a minefield for her fragile state. She couldn't work here. The realisation was a cold, hard stone in her gut. The money was gone. The opportunity was lost. She had been tested, and she had broken. \"I'm sorry,\" she whispered, her voice thick with unshed tears of frustration. \"I... I get these dizzy spells sometimes. I thought I was fine today. I can't finish this. Not today.\" She began to gather her tools with her good hand, her movements clumsy and shaky, the simple act of rolling a chisel into its leather pocket a monumental effort. Each tool she touched was a reminder of her competence, a stark contrast to the trembling, pathetic figure she now presented.\n\nDeclan watched her for a moment, then straightened up with a grunt. He didn't argue. He just looked disappointed, as if his initial low expectations had been thoroughly met. \"Fine,\" he said, his voice flat. \"Just... go on. Get yourself home.\" He walked back behind the bar, leaving the glass of sugary water untouched on the floor beside her. He didn't offer her any money for her time. She hadn't expected him to. The failure was entirely her own. She forced herself to her feet, her legs unsteady, the heavy tool roll feeling like it was filled with lead. She didn't look at the old men at the bar, but she could feel their curious, pitying eyes on her as she pushed through the heavy door and escaped back into the grey, indifferent drizzle of the Dublin afternoon. The anonymity of the street was no longer a comfort. It was a confirmation of her own failure. She was a ghost in the machine, and the machine had just violently rejected her.The walk back was a litany of pain. The dull, relentless drizzle plastered her hair to her scalp and seeped into the collar of her jacket, a miserable counterpoint to the hot, sharp throb in her palm. The splinter was a deep, searing presence, a tiny sliver of the hostile world she had tried and failed to navigate, now physically embedded in her flesh. Every jostle of the tool roll on her shoulder sent a fresh, sickening wave of agony up her arm. But worse than the physical pain was the acid burn of humiliation. She had not just failed at a job; she had been exposed. Not her secret, not the impossible truth of her, but something almost as shameful: her weakness. She had been revealed as fragile, unreliable, a fainting woman who couldn't handle the pressures of a simple repair job. The publican\u2019s dismissal, his face a mask of irritated disappointment, was a judgment that felt more damning than any of Eamonn\u2019s angry accusations. Eamonn feared what she was; this man simply despised what she appeared to be.\n\nThe guesthouse room, which had briefly felt like a base of operations, was now just a cell. The air was stale and cold, offering no comfort. She locked the door and slid the chain across, a futile gesture of security against a threat that lived inside her own skin. She sat on the edge of the bed and forced herself to look at her hand. It was swollen and angry, the skin around the dark splinter unnaturally tight. It had to come out. Leaving it in was an invitation to infection, a problem her dwindling funds could not afford to solve with a doctor\u2019s visit. Her tools, symbols of her competence, were now her only recourse for this crude, intimate violation. She unrolled them with her good hand, the familiar scent of wood and steel a bitter mockery. She selected a fine-pointed marking knife, its steel tip honed to a surgical sharpness, and a pair of small, needle-nosed pliers she used for delicate inlay work. Her heart hammered a frantic, sick rhythm against her ribs. She was a carpenter, not a surgeon.\n\nTaking a deep, shuddering breath, she placed her injured hand flat on the wobbly bedside table, pinning it there with the weight of her forearm. The light from the single bulb was weak and yellow. With the tip of the knife, she carefully, painstakingly, widened the entry wound. The pain was exquisite, a clean, sharp fire that made her vision swim. She bit down hard on her lower lip, tasting the metallic tang of blood. Her target was a tiny, dark sliver of pub floorboard, a relic of her failure. With her fingers trembling from the pain and the adrenaline, she grasped the end of the splinter with the pliers. She pulled. The resistance was sickening, a tearing of flesh that sent another jolt of pure agony through her, but it came free. A single, bloody shard of wood, no more than an inch long. She stared at it for a moment, lying on the dark wood of the table, a trophy from a battle she had unequivocally lost. She stumbled to the small, stained sink in the corner of the room, running the cold, rusty-tasting water over the bleeding wound until it ran pink, then clear. The cold was a dull relief, but it couldn't touch the deeper, more profound ache of her defeat.\n\nSleep offered no escape, only a descent into feverish, fragmented nightmares. She was back in the pub, but the faces of the old men at the bar were Eamonn\u2019s, their expressions a mixture of terror and disgust. The publican was her grandfather, his face carved from stone, shaking his head in silent, eternal disappointment as she dissolved into a pile of wood shavings on the floor. She woke gasping, her hand throbbing in time with her frantic pulse, the thin blanket damp with sweat. The weak morning light revealed the bleak reality. Her hand was puffy and stiff, a constant, painful reminder of her vulnerability. Her plan had been a fool\u2019s errand. She couldn't expose herself to the random stresses of the world. She couldn't risk the scrutiny of strangers. The handful of small successes had been a fluke, a brief respite before the inevitable collapse. The city, which had briefly seemed to offer a fragile kind of hope, now felt like a vast, indifferent trap. The money on the table was a dwindling resource, and her ability to replenish it had just been proven to be a catastrophic failure. Despair, a feeling she had been holding at bay with sheer momentum, began to seep into the room, cold and heavy as a winter fog.\n\nShe was staring at the wall, her mind a blank slate of misery, when a heavy, purposeful knock came at the door. It wasn't the landlady's timid tap. It was solid, insistent, and it sent a jolt of pure, primal terror through her. Her first thought was Eamonn. He\u2019d found her. He\u2019d tracked her down. The door was locked, the chain was on, but it felt as flimsy as paper. Her heart seized. She scrambled off the bed, backing away from the door until her back was pressed against the cold glass of the window. Her breath was trapped in her chest, a painful, immovable weight. The knock came again, louder this time. \"Aoife? Are you in there? It's Declan. From the pub.\" The name was so unexpected it short-circuited her panic. Declan. The publican. What in God's name was he doing here? Had he followed her? Was he here to accuse her of being a fraud, to demand his money back for a job she hadn't even been paid for? \"Open the door,\" he called out, his voice muffled but firm. \"I'm not going to stand in the hall all day.\"\n\nHer mind raced. She could stay silent, pretend she wasn't there. But he knew she was. He had a stubborn, immovable quality about him. Ignoring him would only make things worse. With a trembling hand, she slid the chain back and turned the key. She opened the door only a few inches, peering through the gap. He stood in the dingy hallway, a large, intimidating presence in his tweed overcoat, his face looking even more florid in the weak light. He held a small, grease-stained paper bag in one hand. He looked past her, into the small, miserable room, his gaze taking in the unmade bed and the roll of tools on the floor. His eyes finally settled on her, his expression unreadable. \"Your landlady's a right old dragon,\" he grumbled. \"Took a tenner just to let me up the stairs.\" He shoved the paper bag towards her. \"Here.\"\n\nAoife looked at the bag, then back at his face, her confusion total. She didn't take it. \"What is it?\" \"It's a ham and cheese roll and a bottle of Lucozade,\" he said, with the air of a man stating something incredibly obvious and foolish. \"You look like you haven't eaten in a week.\" He pushed it into her uninjured hand. \"I came to see if your hand had fallen off.\" He peered at her bandaged palm, which she had wrapped in a strip of cloth torn from a t-shirt. \"Doesn't look good.\" He met her eyes, and for the first time, she saw something other than annoyance or suspicion in his face. It was a flicker of grudging respect. \"You made a right mess of yourself,\" he said, \"but I saw what you were doing before you went all peculiar on me. You were paring it back clean. You know what you're about.\"\n\nHe paused, letting the silence hang in the air. \"The door's still knackered. The draft is still there. And I don't want some other cowboy making a bigger mess of it.\" He looked at her, a challenge in his eyes. \"The pub's closed tomorrow morning until noon for a delivery. No customers, no noise. Just me and the barrels. You come at nine. You finish the job. I'll pay you a hundred euro. Cash. Take it or leave it.\" The offer was a lifeline thrown into the dark, churning water of her despair. It was everything she needed: a controlled environment, no audience, and a substantial amount of money. But it meant facing him again, returning to the scene of her humiliation. It meant trusting him. She looked at his hard, impassive face, at the unexpected, clumsy offering of the sandwich in her hand, and saw not a threat, but a pragmatist. He didn't care about her dizzy spells or her strange fragility. He just wanted his door fixed, and he believed she was the one to do it. \"I'll be there,\" she said, her voice quiet but steady. He gave a single, curt nod. \"Nine o'clock. Don't be late.\" He turned and walked away down the hall without another word, his heavy footsteps echoing on the bare floorboards, leaving Aoife standing in the doorway, clutching a warm sandwich and a fragile, complicated sliver of hope.After Declan\u2019s heavy footsteps had faded down the hall, Aoife remained in the doorway, the grease-stained paper bag a strange, warm weight in her hand. The scent of it \u2013 baked bread, salty ham, sharp cheese \u2013 was an almost violent assault on her senses, a reminder of a world of simple, physical comforts she had been starving for. She closed the door, her movements slow and deliberate, and slid the lock home. Back in the centre of the room, she sank onto the chair and unwrapped the sandwich as if it were a holy relic. She ate it slowly, mechanically at first, then with a growing, ravenous hunger. Each bite was a revelation, a solid, grounding act that pushed back against the formless dread. The salty fat of the ham, the yielding softness of the bread, the sugary, chemical tang of the Lucozade; it was fuel, it was substance, it was a clumsy, gruff act of grace, and it felt more real than anything she had experienced in days.\n\nWith the food in her stomach, a small, warm ballast against the cold tide of her fear, she tended to her hand. The makeshift bandage was stiff with dried blood. She unwrapped it carefully, her breath hissing between her teeth as the cloth pulled at the tender skin. The wound was an angry red mouth in the centre of her palm, but it was clean. The crude surgery had been a success. She found a small, almost-empty bottle of antiseptic in her jacket pocket, a relic from some long-forgotten scrape in the workshop, and cleaned the wound with a stoic, detached precision. The sting was a familiar fire, a pain she understood. She re-bandaged it with the last of a roll of gauze from her small first-aid kit, her movements practiced and neat. Her hand throbbed with a steady, rhythmic pain, a metronome counting out the beats of her continued existence. That night, she slept. It was not a deep or restful sleep, but it was a solid, unbroken stretch of unconsciousness, free from the terror of dissolution.\n\nThe morning was the colour of slate, the sky a uniform grey that promised more rain but for now held back. Aoife was awake before the city, her internal clock set to the early hours of a working day. The pain in her hand had subsided to a dull, persistent ache, a constant reminder of yesterday's failure and today's fragile chance at redemption. She dressed with a sense of quiet purpose, her fear still present but now contained, packed down beneath a layer of professional resolve. She checked her tool roll, ensuring everything was in its place. The tools were not just implements; they were her credentials, her argument for her own usefulness. As she walked through the waking streets, the world felt different. The anonymity she had clung to was still there, but it was no longer a suffocating blanket. It was just the natural state of a city, a vast, complex machine of which she was now, however temporarily, a functioning part.\n\nThe Auld Triangle was a dark, silent shape on the corner, its windows blank, the familiar sounds of life within it entirely absent. Aoife hesitated on the pavement for only a second before knocking on the heavy door, her knuckles rapping a firm, decisive rhythm. After a moment, a series of heavy bolts were drawn back, and the door opened a crack. Declan peered out, his face impassive. \"You're early,\" he grunted, but it was a statement of fact, not an accusation. He swung the door open and stepped back, letting her into the gloom. The pub was a strange, liminal space in the morning light. The air was still and thick, smelling of old smoke and spilled beer, but without the bodies and the noise, it felt like a chapel between services. The chairs were stacked on the tables, the floor was swept, and a profound silence hung over everything. It was perfect.\n\n\"Coffee's on the bar if you want it. Black,\" Declan said, already moving towards the back. \"Don't touch the whiskey.\" Aoife poured herself a mug of the thick, bitter coffee, its warmth a welcome shock to her system. She carried it over to the wounded doorframe and took a long sip, surveying the job with a clear head. The problem was straightforward, a matter of cutting away the damaged wood and splicing in a new, solid piece. The challenge was not the work itself, but doing it under the weight of her own fragility. She laid out her tool roll on the floor, the familiar gesture a silent prayer. Declan was true to his word. He was busy with a delivery, rolling heavy kegs of stout from the street into the cellar with a series of controlled thuds and grunts, his presence a constant but unobtrusive background noise. They worked in a strange, parallel silence, two people focused entirely on their own demanding, physical tasks.\n\nAoife began her work. She used a fine-toothed Japanese saw to make two clean, precise cuts, isolating the splintered section of the jamb. The whisper of the blade through the old, dry wood was a deeply satisfying sound. The pain in her hand was a low, steady throb, but she found she could use it. It was an anchor, a constant, physical sensation she could focus on if her mind started to drift, if the edges of the world began to feel too thin. Once, as she was carefully chiselling out the waste wood, a heavy keg slipped from Declan's grasp in the cellar below, crashing to the stone floor with a deafening boom. The sudden, violent noise was a shockwave, and for a heart-stopping second, she felt the familiar, terrifying lightness, the cold tingle of dissolution. She froze, her chisel poised, her breath trapped in her chest. But this time was different. She was not on display. She was not under scrutiny. She closed her eyes, focused on the sharp ache in her palm, and on the solid, reassuring weight of the chisel handle. *Solid,* she thought, the word a command. *The wood is real. The tool is real.* After a moment, the feeling passed, leaving her shaken but intact.\n\nShe measured and cut a new piece of hardwood she'd brought with her, a small offcut of oak she kept for just such repairs. She planed it down by fractions of a millimetre until the fit was perfect, the new wood slotting into the old frame with satisfying precision. She mixed a small amount of strong wood glue, applied it carefully, and clamped the new piece firmly in place. While the glue set, she sat on the floor, sipping the last of her now-cold coffee. Declan emerged from the cellar, wiping his hands on a rag. He came over and looked down at her work, at the neat, clamped repair. He didn't say anything for a long moment. Then he disappeared behind the bar and returned with a steaming mug of tea, which he placed on the floor beside her. He didn't speak a word, just gave a curt nod and went back to stocking his shelves. The simple, unspoken gesture of care was so profound it almost brought tears to her eyes.\n\nAn hour later, the glue was set. Aoife carefully removed the clamps and used her finest plane to shave the new piece down until it was perfectly flush with the old wood. She sanded it smooth, the rhythmic scrape of the paper a final, finishing touch. She stepped back and inspected her work. The repair was almost invisible, a clean, strong scar where the violent wound had been. The grain of the new oak sat beautifully against the dark, aged pine of the original frame. It was good work. It was honest work. She swung the storeroom door on its hinges. It closed with a solid, satisfying click, the seal perfect. The draft was gone. Declan came over, pint glass in one hand, rag in the other. He closed the door and opened it a few times, then ran a thick finger over the seamless repair. \"Solid,\" he grunted, the single word a high commendation. He reached into his pocket and pulled out a roll of notes, counting out five crisp twenties onto the bar. \"Good work,\" he said, pushing them towards her. He hesitated, then looked at her, his expression serious. \"I know a fella. Owns a few rental properties over in Portobello. Old houses, always falling apart. I'll give him your number.\" He held her gaze. \"Can you handle it?\" The question was direct, a test. He wasn't asking if she was a good carpenter. He already knew the answer to that. He was asking if she was reliable, if the strange, fainting girl from the other day was gone. \"Yes,\" Aoife said, her voice clear and steady. \"I can handle it.\" He nodded, satisfied. \"Right then,\" he said, turning back to his bar. \"Off with you. I've a pub to open.\" She scooped up the money, her heart light, her hand still aching but now a badge of honour, not shame. As she stepped out into the bright, clear afternoon, the hundred euro a solid, warm rectangle in her pocket, she felt a shift in the foundations of her world. She was no longer just running away. She was starting to build something new.The hundred euro sat on the bedside table, a small, paper monument to a battle won. For two days, Aoife did not touch it. She lived off the dregs of the ham and cheese roll and the bruised apples, hoarding the money as if it were the last of its kind in the world. It was more than currency; it was a fragile proof of concept, evidence that a life could be salvaged from the wreckage of the old one. She spent the time in a state of quiet, anxious readiness, her new phone always within arm\u2019s reach, her bandaged hand a dull, aching reminder of the stakes. The waiting was a different kind of torment from the one that had preceded it. It was no longer the passive dread of being discovered, but the active, nerve-shredding anxiety of hoping to be found, but only by the right person, for the right reason. Each time a door slammed in the guesthouse or a siren wailed in the distance, her stomach would clench, but her mind would not immediately leap to Eamonn. Instead, it whispered, *Is that him? Is that the call?*\n\nIt came on the third day, a Tuesday. The phone buzzed on the table, a low, aggressive sound that cut through the afternoon quiet. Aoife snatched it up, her heart a frantic drum against her ribs. The number was unrecognised. \"Hello?\" she said, her voice steadier than she expected. The man on the other end did not waste time with pleasantries. \"Is this Aoife? Declan from The Auld Triangle gave me your number. Name's Duffy. Michael Duffy.\" His voice was brisk and businesslike, with a flat Midlands accent that was all sharp angles, devoid of Declan's gruff Dublin melody. \"Declan says you're good with old houses. I have a flat in Portobello, top floor. Sash windows are painted shut, half the cords are gone. It's empty. Key is in the lockbox by the door, code is 1988. I'll text you the address. Look at the job and text me a price. If I like it, I'll transfer a deposit and you can start. Alright?\"\n\nIt was a dizzying rush of information, a purely transactional communication that was both terrifying and liberating. There were no questions about who she was or where she came from. Her only credential was Declan\u2019s word. She was not a person to him; she was a function, a solution to a problem. For a woman trying to become a ghost, it was the perfect arrangement. \"Alright,\" she managed to say, her mind already turning over the mechanics of the job. He texted the address seconds after the call ended. She found a pen and wrote it down on the back of a receipt, the unfamiliar street name a coordinate in her new, unmapped life. The job was a classic, the kind of finicky, patient work she excelled at. It was work that required solitude and concentration, a quiet communion between a craftswoman and a broken thing. It was a lifeline.\n\nThe house in Portobello was a tall, handsome Georgian building, its elegant brick fa\u00e7ade now looking tired and neglected, a dowager fallen on hard times. It had been carved up into flats, its grand proportions subdivided into a warren of smaller lives. Just as Duffy had said, the key was in the lockbox. Letting herself into the silent, empty flat felt like a trespass, but the scent of old plaster, dust, and damp was a familiar perfume. The main room was large and airy, with high ceilings and beautiful, intricate cornicing, but the two tall sash windows were sealed shut with generations of thick, careless paint, trapping the stale air and weak light. It was a room holding its breath. Aoife ran her fingers over the built-up layers of gloss, feeling the history of neglect. She understood this place. It was a beautiful thing that had been mistreated, imprisoned by other people\u2019s carelessness. The work would not just be a repair; it would be a liberation.\n\nFor the next two days, the flat became her world. She worked with a silent, methodical passion she had not felt in years. The empty rooms were her sanctuary, the quiet streets outside a distant, irrelevant hum. The process was painstaking. She used a sharp utility knife and a painter\u2019s tool to carefully score and break the thick seal of paint, working slowly to avoid damaging the delicate mouldings of the window frame. The first time a sash finally gave way with a groan and a crackle of ancient paint, sliding upwards to let a rush of fresh, cool air into the stuffy room, it felt like a miracle. She replaced the rotten, frayed sash cords, threading the new rope through the hidden pulleys and carefully re-calibrating the heavy iron counterweights until the window glided up and down with the smooth, silent ease of its original design. It was a delicate, intricate dance of physics and feel. In the deep focus of the work, the world outside her immediate task ceased to exist. Her fears, her past, the strange, fragile nature of her own body \u2013 it all receded, silenced by the whisper of a plane on wood and the satisfying click of a well-balanced window.\n\nDuffy, true to his word, had transferred a deposit as soon as she\u2019d texted him a quote. When she sent him a picture of the two fully restored, gleaming windows, the balance arrived in her newly opened bank account within minutes. The account itself had been a terrifying hurdle, requiring a minimal proof of address she\u2019d coaxed out of her reluctant landlady. But now, with a legitimate bank balance, she was no longer just a transient with a wad of cash. She was a sole trader. She had an income. A day later, Duffy texted again. A set of floorboards in a ground-floor flat in Ranelagh. Then a warped kitchen door in a house near the canal. The work was steady, a constant stream of small, manageable problems she could solve. She became a quiet, efficient presence in the empty, neglected spaces of Duffy\u2019s property portfolio, a ghost who left behind only the subtle signs of her passing: a floor that no longer creaked, a window that opened to the sun, a door that closed without a fight.\n\nThe guesthouse, with its smell of cabbage and its single, grimy window, began to feel less like a hideout and more like a cage. It was a place for a fugitive, and she was, slowly, becoming something else. With a few hundred euro saved in the bank, she began to scan the \u2018To Let\u2019 notices in shop windows, her heart beating a little faster with the audacity of the idea. She found it on a quiet, tree-lined street in Harold\u2019s Cross: a top-floor bedsit in a tall Victorian house. It was just one room with a small, curtained-off kitchenette and a bathroom tiny enough to be a cupboard, but its single large window looked out over a sea of neighbouring gardens and rooftops. It was private. It was quiet. It was safe. The landlord was a weary-looking man who seemed to have long since given up on checking references, and her cash deposit was all the persuasion he needed.\n\nOn a bright, windswept Saturday, she moved. It was a simple affair. She packed her few clothes into a carrier bag, gathered the small collection of tins and dry goods she had accumulated, and rolled up her tools. Walking out of the guesthouse for the last time, she did not look back. The feeling of turning the key in the lock of her own front door was a physical shock, a jolt of ownership and belonging so profound it made her feel light-headed. The room was bare, echoing, and smelled faintly of lavender polish and old books. It was a blank slate. That first evening, with no furniture but a mattress she\u2019d bought for cash from a second-hand shop, she did not unroll her tools on the floor. She found a sturdy wooden crate left behind by a previous tenant, stood it in the corner by the window, and laid her tools out on it. It was her first workbench. In the fading light, she picked up her favourite chisel and a sharpening stone. The rhythmic, scraping sound of steel on stone filled the small, quiet room. It was not the sound of a woman hiding. It was the sound of a woman at home.The rhythm of the days settled into a quiet, predictable cadence. Autumn bled into the Dublin streets, turning the leaves in the canal-side parks to rust and gold. Aoife\u2019s life became a map of bus routes and side streets, a series of empty flats where she would arrive like a phantom and leave behind the subtle evidence of her craft. The work for Michael Duffy was plentiful and blessedly impersonal. He would text an address, a code, and a problem \u2013 a sticking door, a cracked window frame, a section of skirting board chewed by a previous tenant's dog. She would text back a price, and the money would appear in her bank account, a silent, digital transaction that required no human contact. She was a joinery surgeon, making her rounds in the quiet, empty wards of Duffy\u2019s property empire, performing small, neat operations on the city\u2019s wounded architecture.\n\nHer bedsit became a true sanctuary. The large, west-facing window was its soul, and she would sit by it in the evenings as the sun went down, watching the sky bleed from blue to orange to a deep, bruised purple over the endless patchwork of rooftops. The room slowly filled with the markers of a life being lived. A second-hand book on Irish furniture bought from a charity shop. A small, healthy-looking fern on the windowsill. A proper kettle that didn't threaten to electrocute her. The greatest change was the workbench she built for herself. Using money from three of Duffy\u2019s jobs, she bought several lengths of solid, reclaimed beechwood. Over the course of a weekend, she transformed them into a small, sturdy workbench that fit perfectly under the window. It was the first beautiful thing she had made for herself in years, its joints perfect, its surface planed to a satin smoothness. Every evening, she would sit at it, the scent of the wood a familiar comfort, and sharpen her tools. The rhythmic scrape of steel on stone was a form of meditation, a mantra that kept the ghosts at bay. It was a lonely life, but it was hers. For the first time since she had fled Belfast, she felt the fragile, unfamiliar sensation of peace.\n\nThe call that broke the rhythm came on a bright, cold Thursday morning. It wasn't Duffy\u2019s brisk, impersonal tone. The voice was hesitant, female, and elderly. \u201cHello, is this Aoife, the carpenter? I am so sorry to bother you. I found your little card in a newsagent in Terenure, it must have been there for months. I do hope you\u2019re still\u2026 available?\u201d Aoife\u2019s heart gave a nervous flutter. She had almost forgotten about the notices she\u2019d pinned up in her first, desperate days. \u201cYes,\u201d she said, her voice cautious. \u201cI\u2019m still available.\u201d The woman, who introduced herself as Eleanor Vance, began to describe the job. It wasn\u2019t a repair, not in the way Duffy\u2019s jobs were. It was a restoration. She had a lady\u2019s writing desk, her own grandmother\u2019s, that had been badly damaged by a leak years ago. The veneer was peeling and the marquetry on the drawer-fronts was lifting. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful piece,\u201d Eleanor said, her voice full of a sad affection. \u201cBut it\u2019s sick. It needs a doctor, not a handyman. Someone told me to take it to a big restorer in town, but they talked about dipping it and stripping it\u2026 it sounded so brutal. I want someone who will be kind to it.\u201d\n\nThe words \u2018be kind to it\u2019 resonated deep in Aoife\u2019s soul. It was the language of a true custodian, not just an owner. Against her better judgment, against the instinct that screamed at her to stick to the safe, anonymous work for Duffy, she agreed to go and look at it. Eleanor Vance lived in a tall, red-brick house in Sandymount, not far from the sea. The air tasted of salt. The woman who answered the door was tall and elegant, with a cascade of silver hair pinned up loosely and intelligent, perceptive eyes that seemed to miss nothing. The house was filled with books, paintings, and the quiet, scholarly clutter of a life spent in pursuit of knowledge. It was a world away from Declan\u2019s pub or her own spartan bedsit. Eleanor led her into a bright, book-lined study where the writing desk stood by the window. It was an exquisite piece of late-Victorian craftsmanship, delicate and refined, made from a rich, dark walnut. And it was, as Eleanor had described, deeply sick. The water damage had caused the fine walnut veneer to bubble and lift along one side, and the intricate inlay of flowers and vines on the drawers was a mess of loose, discoloured pieces.\n\nAoife approached it with a reverence she hadn\u2019t felt in months. She ran her fingertips, the calloused pads surprisingly sensitive, over the damaged surface. This wasn\u2019t a job for glue and clamps alone; this was a puzzle. It would mean carefully lifting the damaged veneer, cleaning the old hide glue from the substrate, and patiently, painstakingly, re-laying each tiny piece of the marquetry. It was the work she had been trained to do, the work she loved, the art that existed at the intersection of history, chemistry, and skill. \u201cIt\u2019s walnut,\u201d she said, her voice soft. \u201cAnd the inlay looks like satinwood and maybe a little rosewood.\u201d Eleanor\u2019s face lit up. \u201cYes! That\u2019s it. My husband always said you were a woman who spoke wood.\u201d The casual, approving observation, the assumption of her expertise, was both a balm and a terror. Eleanor saw her. Not a problem-solver, but an artist.\n\nAs she knelt to examine the joinery of the legs, her gaze fell on the pattern of the inlay again. A small, five-petalled flower, rendered in pale satinwood. A jolt, sharp and visceral as an electric shock, went through her. Her grandfather had owned a small tea caddy with the exact same floral motif. She could see it now, sitting on the mantelpiece in his Belfast workshop, his large, gentle hand resting beside it as he explained the art of knife-cutting veneer. She could smell the pipe smoke and the oiled steel of his tools, feel the comforting rumble of his voice. The memory was so powerful, so intensely real, that it ripped a hole in the fragile fabric of her new life. The familiar, dreaded cold bloomed in her chest, a spreading ice that leached the warmth from the sunlit room. The colours of the books on the shelves began to desaturate, the edges of the room shimmering as if seen through water.\n\nEleanor was saying something about the desk\u2019s history, her voice a pleasant, melodic drone that seemed to be coming from a great distance. Aoife gripped the sharp, splintered edge of the damaged veneer on the desk, digging the tiny wooden shards into her fingertips. Pain. It was an anchor. She focused on the small, sharp points of physical sensation, a desperate mantra against the terrifying slide into nothingness. *The wood is real. The pain is real. You are here.* She forced herself to look up, to meet Eleanor\u2019s curious, intelligent gaze. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s a difficult job,\u201d Aoife heard herself say, her voice sounding thin and strained. \u201cThe marquetry will have to be completely lifted and re-laid. It will take time.\u201d She was fighting a battle on two fronts, one against the encroaching void, the other to maintain a fa\u00e7ade of professional composure. The terror and the longing, the grief for her grandfather and the fear of what she was becoming, were a screaming vortex inside her, but on the outside, she was a quiet carpenter, calmly assessing a piece of damaged furniture. The duality was a chasm threatening to swallow her whole. She had to get out. \u201cI can do it,\u201d she said, standing up too quickly, a wave of dizziness washing over her. \u201cI\u2019ll need to work on it here. I\u2019ll text you a price.\u201d Before Eleanor could respond, before her perceptive eyes could register the sheer panic behind Aoife\u2019s mask, Aoife had turned and fled, leaving the beautiful, broken desk and its kind, intelligent owner behind in the silent, sun-filled room.She didn't remember the bus ride back from Sandymount. It was a blank space in her memory, a frantic, grey blur bracketed by the salt air of the coast and the familiar, grimy brick of the streets near her bedsit. She came back to herself standing outside her own front door, her key fumbling against the lock, her breath coming in ragged, painful gasps. Her fingertips throbbed, tiny, sharp points of agony where she had dug them into the splintered veneer of the desk. The pain was a dull, red light in the fog of her panic, the one thing that proved she had made it back in one piece. The sunlit, scholarly peace of Eleanor\u2019s study felt like a dream of a foreign country, a place whose language she did not speak and whose customs she had just violently, unforgivably, transgressed. She had fled not just a room, but a possibility, a glimpse of a life she thought she might be able to build, and the shame of her retreat was a cold, heavy stone in her gut.\n\nOnce inside, with the door locked and bolted, the fragile peace of her sanctuary felt shattered. The room was the same, the light falling in the same way across her small, perfect workbench, but she saw it all through a scrim of failure. She had run. Again. Just as she had run from Belfast, she had run from a beautiful, broken piece of wood because it reminded her of a truth she could no longer bear. She paced the small floor, a caged animal, the four walls that had been her fortress now feeling like the boundaries of her confinement. She had built a small, safe world for herself, a world of impersonal repairs and empty flats, and the moment she had stepped outside of it, the moment she had been offered a piece of work that required not just her skill but her soul, she had crumbled. The void had found her not in the stress of a hostile environment, but in the heart of a beautiful one, triggered by a memory of love. That was the most terrifying discovery of all. The curse wasn't just a reaction to fear and scrutiny; it was a reaction to her own history. It fed on her past.\n\nShe collapsed onto the edge of her mattress, staring at the phone in her hand. The screen was blank, a dark mirror reflecting her own pale, strained face. The choice before her was stark and absolute. She could delete Eleanor Vance\u2019s number, erase the whole encounter from her memory, and retreat back into the safe, grey world of Michael Duffy\u2019s rotting window frames. She could survive that way. She could continue her half-life as a ghost who mended things, forever circling the edges of the world, never truly engaging with it. Or she could do the job. She could walk back into that sunlit room, back to the desk that had almost unmade her, and face it. The thought sent a tremor of pure, visceral terror through her. It felt like volunteering to walk into a fire, knowing it would burn her. But the alternative, the life of perpetual retreat, suddenly felt like a different kind of death, a slow, quiet fading into utter meaninglessness.\n\nThe memory of her grandfather, which had been the trigger, was now the heart of the problem. She allowed it to come, not fighting it this time, but letting it wash over her in the quiet of her room. She saw his workshop, a place of organised chaos and deep, abiding peace. She saw his hands, large and surprisingly gentle, guiding her own small hand as she held a chisel for the first time. He had never spoken of lies. To him, the world was a thing of substance and integrity. Wood was honest. A joint was either true or it was not. He had taught her that the soul of a thing was in its making, in the care and skill that went into it. He had bequeathed to her a world of tangible truths, a faith she could hold in her hands. The writing desk, with its familiar inlay, was a relic of that world. It was a direct, physical link to the one person in her life who had represented an uncomplicated reality. The sight of it had been a collision, a violent meeting of the true world he had given her and the false one she was forced to inhabit, and the impact had almost torn her apart.\n\nA cold, hard anger began to replace the fear. It was a slow-burning ember in the ashes of her panic. She was tired of running. She was tired of being a victim of this strange, internal haunting. What was the point of having this skill, this art that her grandfather had so lovingly passed down to her, if she was too afraid to use it? What was the point of surviving if she had to amputate the parts of herself that made life worth living? To refuse this job would be to dishonour his memory, to concede that his world of truth and substance had no place in hers. It would be an admission that she was, in fact, nothing more than a flaw, a lie made flesh, and that she deserved to live in the shadows. The desk was sick, Eleanor had said. It needed a doctor. But Aoife knew, with a sudden, chilling certainty, that she was the one who was truly sick, and this desk, this beautiful, broken thing, might just be the only medicine that could work.\n\nWith a hand that was surprisingly steady, she picked up the phone. Her thumb hovered over the screen, a silent, momentous pause before the irreversible act. She thought of Eleanor\u2019s kind, intelligent eyes, of her gentle request to \u2018be kind to it\u2019. It was a plea for compassion that Aoife now realised she desperately needed to extend to herself. She opened a new text message. Her fingers, still tender from the splinters, moved over the keypad, composing a message that was simple, professional, and an act of sheer, terrifying defiance. \u2018Mrs Vance, the price for the restoration of the desk will be four hundred euro. That includes all materials. I can begin on Monday if that is suitable. Aoife.\u2019 She read it over once, her heart hammering against her ribs, then, before she could lose her nerve, she pressed send. The small word \u2018Delivered\u2019 appeared beneath the message, a confirmation that her challenge had been issued.\n\nShe set the phone down, her whole body trembling with the aftershock of her own courage. The fear was still there, a cold knot in her stomach, but it was no longer in charge. For the first time, she had willingly chosen to walk towards the thing that threatened her. She had chosen her craft over her curse. She stood up and walked to her workbench. The last of the evening light was slanting through the window, illuminating the fine layer of sawdust on its surface. She ran her hand over the smooth, solid beechwood, her anchor in a world that threatened to dissolve. From a small, carefully wrapped cloth in her main tool roll, she took out a set of delicate, surgeon-like scalpels and fine-tipped probes she used for inlay and veneer work. They were tools she had not had cause to use since leaving Belfast. She laid them out in a neat, gleaming row. She found her small, copper glue pot and the packet of amber-coloured hide glue pellets. She was arming herself, preparing her defenses. She did not know if she could win this fight, if she could face the desk without breaking apart. But as she stood there in the fading light, surrounded by the tools of her trade, she knew, with a certainty that was as solid as the wood beneath her hand, that she was done running.The two days that followed were a long, drawn-out breath held in anticipation. Aoife did not leave the bedsit. She prepared. The work was an antidote to the anxiety, a way to channel the nervous energy that thrummed just beneath her skin. She took out her grandfather\u2019s old oilstones, the fine-grained slate worn into a shallow concavity from decades of use. One by one, she honed the edges of her inlay scalpels and chisels, her movements slow and deliberate, her focus absolute. The whisper of steel on stone was a conversation with her past, a dialogue she was trying to learn to have without flinching. She was not just sharpening tools; she was sharpening her own resolve, honing her courage to a razor\u2019s edge. The phone remained silent on the workbench, a small black monolith containing either her salvation or her retreat. She refused to look at it, to will it to ring. The choice was made. The arrow was loosed. All she could do now was wait for it to land.\n\nThe reply came on Sunday evening, a simple, unassuming notification that made her heart leap into her throat. The message was from Eleanor. \u2018Monday is perfect, Aoife. I\u2019m so glad. The desk is looking forward to it. See you around ten? Eleanor.\u2019 The gentle, whimsical personification of the desk, the complete absence of any question about her previous flight, was an act of quiet, radical grace. Eleanor was not just accepting her price; she was welcoming her back, offering a clean slate. The generosity of it was both a profound relief and an immense burden. She was being trusted, not just as a carpenter, but as a person, and she was terrified she would not be equal to the faith being placed in her.\n\nMonday morning was cold and bright. The walk to Sandymount was a conscious pilgrimage. She didn't take the bus. She walked, her tool roll a familiar, reassuring weight on her shoulder, the rhythm of her footsteps on the pavement a steadying drumbeat. Each step was a deliberate choice to move forward, to not turn back. When she stood before the tall, red-brick house, she felt a tremor of the same panic that had sent her fleeing days before. It was a cold finger tracing its way up her spine. She took a deep breath, the salt-tinged air a sharp, clean shock to her lungs, and knocked on the door before the fear could take root. Eleanor answered, her smile as warm and genuine as before. There was no awkwardness in her greeting, no hint of curiosity about Aoife\u2019s previous behaviour. \"Aoife, good morning. Come in, come in. It\u2019s a beautiful day for it.\"\n\nShe led Aoife back to the sunlit study, where the desk stood waiting like a patient in a consulting room. The light caught the lifted, peeling veneer, the sickened wood looking even more vulnerable than Aoife remembered. \"Now,\" Eleanor said, her tone brisk but kind. \"I will be pottering about for most of the day, but please, make this space your own. I\u2019ve put a flask of tea and some biscuits on the side table for you. Don't be shy. If you need anything at all, just give me a shout.\" With that, she gave Aoife a final, encouraging smile and slipped out of the room, closing the door softly behind her, granting her the precious, necessary gift of solitude.\n\nAoife stood in the quiet room for a long moment, simply breathing. The silence was a balm. She approached the desk, not with the reverence of her first visit, but with the focused, diagnostic eye of a professional. This time, she would not allow herself to be overwhelmed. She was here to work. She carefully laid a canvas dust sheet on the polished floor and unrolled her tools, the familiar ritual a silent invocation of her craft. She set up her small, electric glue pot on a ceramic tile, filling it with water and a handful of the amber-coloured hide glue pellets. Soon, the air was filled with its distinctive, slightly sweet, animal smell. It was the smell of her grandfather\u2019s workshop, the scent of her own history. The memories began to prick at the edges of her consciousness, but she refused to let them overwhelm her. Instead, she anchored herself in the task, in the physical reality of the tools and the wood.\n\nShe began the painstaking process of lifting the damaged marquetry. With a fine, flexible spatula, she tested the edges of the peeling veneer, identifying the loose areas. Using a tacking iron set to a low heat, she gently warmed the surface, the heat penetrating the wood to soften the ancient, brittle hide glue beneath. It was a delicate, nerve-wracking process. Too much heat and she would scorch the wood; too little and the veneer would splinter and break. As she worked, she could feel the ghosts of her grandfather\u2019s lessons rising within her. *'Let the tool do the work, girl,'* his voice rumbled in her memory. *'Don't force it. Listen to the wood.'* This time, instead of recoiling from the memory, she leaned into it, using it as a guide. The voice was not a haunting; it was an instruction manual.\n\nShe came to the five-petalled flower, the delicate satinwood motif that had been her undoing. Her breath hitched. The air in the room grew thin and sharp. The colours of the book spines on the shelves seemed to bleed at the edges, becoming unnaturally vivid. The cold began its silent, inward creep. She felt the terrifying lightness, the sense that her own molecules were beginning to loosen their grip on one another. She froze, the heated iron hovering just above the delicate inlay. Her first instinct was to reach for pain, to find a sharp edge. But a second, newer instinct rose to meet it. She closed her eyes. She did not drop the tool. She did not slam her hand down. Instead, she deliberately pressed the cool, smooth steel handle of the iron against the soft skin of her forearm. It wasn't pain she sought, but sensation. The solid, cool weight of it. The reality of the tool in her hand. *'The tool is real,'* she thought, her internal voice a fierce, desperate whisper. *'The desk is real. The job is not finished.'* She focused on the task, breaking it down into its smallest components. *'Lift the top petal first. It's the most stable. Apply heat for three seconds. Slide the knife beneath. Easy.'* She opened her eyes. The room had settled. The colours were normal. The cold had receded, leaving her feeling shaky and hollow, but whole. She had held her ground.\n\nWhen Eleanor next entered, carrying a small plate with a slice of lemon cake, she found Aoife bent over the desk, her concentration absolute, a fine sheen of sweat on her brow. \"My goodness,\" Eleanor said softly, so as not to startle her. \"That looks like surgeon's work.\" Aoife looked up, her face pale but her eyes clear. She managed a small, tired smile. \"It just takes a bit of patience.\" Eleanor placed the plate on the side table. \"My grandmother, the one who owned this desk, she used to say that patience is just love made visible over time.\" The simple, profound wisdom of the statement settled over Aoife, not as a trigger, but as a deep, resonant truth. It was a definition of her craft, and perhaps, a clue to her own healing.\n\nBy the time the afternoon light began to fail, Aoife had successfully lifted every piece of damaged inlay from the main drawer front. The tiny, delicate shapes of satinwood and rosewood lay in perfect order on a baize-lined tray, a scattered mosaic of a story waiting to be put back together. The drawer itself, stripped of its finery, looked wounded and bare, but it was a clean wound, ready to be healed. She had survived the first day. She had stepped into the heart of her fear and had not been consumed. Looking at the neatly arranged chaos on the tray, the problem broken down into its constituent, manageable parts, she felt a quiet, exhausted sense of victory. The path ahead was still long and fraught with peril, but she was no longer lost. She was on the path, and her tools were in her hand.The second day began not with a jolt of anxiety, but with a quiet, steady sense of purpose. When Aoife arrived, Eleanor greeted her with the same warm, uncomplicated smile, as if her presence in the house was now the most natural thing in the world. The study was waiting, the tray of disembodied wooden petals a silent testament to the previous day\u2019s battle. Aoife set to work immediately, her movements economical and sure. Today\u2019s task was cleaning. Before she could rebuild, she had to prepare the ground, removing every trace of the old, failed glue from both the drawer front and the back of each delicate piece of inlay. It was slow, tedious, repetitive work, requiring a light touch and infinite patience. Using a soft cloth dampened with warm water and a small, stiff brush, she gently scrubbed away the brittle, crystalline remnants of the past.\n\nThe work induced a state of deep, meditative focus. The world shrank to the tiny universe of a single piece of satinwood, its grain a miniature landscape she was carefully clearing. The scent of the warming hide glue began to fill the room again, a smell that had once been a prelude to panic but was now becoming something else: the smell of her own competence, the smell of work. Eleanor entered the room mid-morning, moving quietly so as not to disturb her. She wasn't checking on Aoife\u2019s progress, but simply retrieving a book from a high shelf. She paused for a moment, watching Aoife bent over the tray, her head bowed in concentration. \"That smell,\" Eleanor said softly, a nostalgic smile touching her lips. \"It reminds me of my father\u2019s workshop. He wasn\u2019t a fine craftsman like you, he just mended things around the house, but he always had a pot of that glue bubbling away. He used to call it the smell of second chances.\"\n\nThe words landed in the quiet room with the force of a revelation. *The smell of second chances.* Aoife looked up from her work, her eyes meeting Eleanor\u2019s. In that moment, a lifetime of association, of linking that scent with the irretrievable loss of her grandfather, was re-written. It wasn't the smell of an ending, but of a beginning. It wasn't the scent of death and memory, but of repair and renewal. A warmth spread through her chest, a feeling so unfamiliar it almost made her gasp. It was the antithesis of the cold, a profound and grateful thawing. She could only manage a small, shaky nod in response, but she knew Eleanor understood. The older woman gave her a knowing look, a flicker of deep empathy in her bright eyes, before she took her book and left Aoife alone with the profound, transformative gift she had just been given.\n\nWith the cleaning complete, the moment arrived to begin the reconstruction. This was the true art, the alchemy of turning a scattered collection of fragments back into a coherent, beautiful whole. She applied a thin, even layer of the warm, syrupy glue to the substrate of the drawer front. Working quickly but without haste, she began to re-lay the pieces of the marquetry puzzle. Using the fine tip of a probe and her own fingertips, she nudged each piece into its exact, original position, the warm, tacky glue gripping it in place. She then used a small, specialised tool called a veneer hammer, its smooth, polished head squeegeeing the piece down, forcing out any excess glue and air bubbles from beneath, ensuring a perfect, permanent bond. It was a delicate, rhythmic dance of placement and pressure, of knowledge and instinct. She was no longer just a mender; she was a creator, coaxing beauty back into existence.\n\nFinally, all that remained was the five-petalled flower. The trigger. The heart of the storm. She picked up the first pale petal, her hand steady, and laid it in its bed of glue. Then the second, and the third. As she reached for the fourth, she felt it: the familiar, cold whisper at the edge of her senses, the slight shimmer in her peripheral vision. The ghost was stirring, roused by the proximity of this potent symbol. She paused, her breath catching in her throat. The memory of her grandfather\u2019s hand next to the tea caddy was there, sharp and vivid. But this time, something else was there beside it: Eleanor\u2019s voice. *Patience is just love made visible over time.* And beneath that, another layer: *The smell of second chances.* The memories were no longer a single, unbearable note of loss. They were a chord, complex and bittersweet, containing grief but also love, connection, and now, hope. She looked down at the incomplete flower, at the small, perfect shape of the final petal held in her forceps. It was not a relic of an ending. It was a promise. With a slow, deliberate movement, she placed the final petal into the centre of the design. The flower was whole. As the last piece settled into place, a profound sense of rightness, of completion, washed through her, a warm, golden tide that pushed the cold and the fear back into the deep, leaving only a quiet, luminous peace. The desk was not the only thing being made whole in that sunlit room.The silence that followed the placement of the final petal was profound. It was not an empty silence, but one filled with a quiet, resonant hum, like the air after a bell has ceased to ring. Aoife did not move for a full minute, her hand still poised over the completed flower, her entire being suffused with a peace so complete it felt like a physical substance. The ghost in her machine had not been exorcised, but it had been answered. It had been met not with fear or pain, but with a quiet, determined love for the work, and it had fallen silent. With a slow, steady breath, she returned to the task, her movements fluid and sure. She took a clean, damp cloth and, with the lightest touch, wiped away the excess hide glue that had squeezed out from the edges of the inlay, cleaning the lines until they were perfect. The meticulous, gentle act was a confirmation of her victory, a physical tidying-up after the psychic storm.\n\nShe prepared for the clamping, the final, crucial stage that would make the repair permanent. She laid a sheet of waxed paper over the entire drawer front to prevent the glue from adhering to her clamping block, then placed a perfectly flat piece of beechwood\u2014a caul\u2014over the paper to distribute the pressure evenly across the entire surface of the marquetry. There would be no weak points, no areas of stress. The pressure had to be firm, even, and universal. She positioned two long sash cramps, their metal bars gleaming in the sunlight, and slowly, carefully, began to tighten them. The gentle, incremental creak of the screws was the sound of healing being enforced, of scattered pieces being brought into an unbreakable union. When the pressure was perfect, she stood back, her hands on her hips, and surveyed her work. The drawer, held in this firm, therapeutic embrace, was no longer a patient. It was in recovery.\n\nEleanor appeared in the doorway, a tray in her hands bearing two cups and a steaming teapot. Her eyes went immediately to the clamped drawer. A slow, wondrous smile spread across her face. \"Oh my,\" she said softly. \"It looks so... peaceful.\" She set the tray down and poured the tea, the clink of porcelain on porcelain the only sound. \"The waiting is the hardest part, isn't it?\" she mused, handing a cup to Aoife. \"For anything that\u2019s been truly broken. You do all the work, you put the pieces back together, but then you simply have to give it time to knit. To become strong again in its own way.\" Aoife took the cup, her fingers wrapping around its warmth. \"Yes,\" she said, her voice quiet but clear. \"You can't rush it.\" They drank their tea in a companionable silence, two women from different generations standing vigil over a piece of shared history, both understanding, without needing to say it, that they were talking about more than just furniture.\n\nThe next morning, Aoife arrived with a feeling of nervous, joyful anticipation. It was time to remove the clamps. She carefully unscrewed the long metal bars, her heart beating a little faster. She lifted away the caul and peeled back the waxed paper. The surface beneath was perfect. The inlay was a seamless, smooth tapestry of wood, the tiny, intricate pieces bonded so perfectly to the drawer front that they looked as if they had grown there. The five-petalled flower, once the epicentre of her terror, was now a small, quiet emblem of her resilience. She ran her fingers over it, feeling not a collection of fragments, but a single, unified, solid thing. It was whole. The sight of it, the simple, tangible fact of its wholeness, was so overwhelming that she had to brace herself against the desk, a wave of pure, unadulterated joy washing over her.\n\nNow came the final, transformative stage: the finishing. This was not about repair, but about revelation, about coaxing the wood\u2019s inner light to the surface. She would not use a harsh modern varnish that would sit on the wood like a sheet of glass. This desk deserved the slow, patient magic of a traditional French polish. She created a small pad, a \u2018fad\u2019, from cotton wadding wrapped in a linen cloth, and began the rhythmic, laborious process. Applying a small amount of shellac and a single drop of oil to the pad, she began to move it across the surface of the desk in sweeping, overlapping circles and figures of eight. It was a dance between her hand and the wood. The first few layers seemed to do nothing, but slowly, magically, a deep, warm lustre began to emerge from within the walnut, as if she were polishing a dormant fire back to life. The grain, which had looked dull and lifeless, began to shimmer with a three-dimensional depth, and the colours of the satinwood and rosewood inlay grew rich and vibrant. She was not applying a coating; she was building a history, layer by translucent layer.\n\nHer phone, forgotten on the side table, buzzed, the sound a jarring, mechanical intrusion into the quiet, organic work. She ignored it, lost in the rhythm of the polishing, but it buzzed again, insistent. With a sigh of irritation, she picked it up. The name on the screen was \u2018Duffy\u2019. The contrast between the soulless, transactional world he represented and the deeply personal, restorative work she was doing could not have been more stark. She answered, her voice cool. \"Aoife.\" \"Got a job for you,\" he said, his voice as brisk as ever. \"Tenant in Inchicore broke a toilet seat. Also punched a hole in a hollow-core door. Cheap job. When can you do it?\" The mundane, slightly sordid nature of the request, coming in this moment of quiet transcendence, was almost comical. A year ago, a week ago, she would have taken it without question, grateful for the work. Now, she felt a new sense of her own value. \"I can't, Michael,\" she said, her voice polite but firm, free of apology. \"I'm on a private commission this week. I'll be in touch when I'm free.\" There was a surprised pause on the other end of the line. \"A private commission?\" he repeated, the words sounding strange in his mouth. \"Alright then.\" He hung up, leaving Aoife staring at the phone. She had said no. She had chosen the art over the money, the soul over the grind. The simple act of prioritising her own well-being, her own satisfaction in her work, felt like a quiet revolution.\n\nBy the end of the fourth day, the desk was finished. The final layer of polish had been applied and buffed with a soft cloth to a deep, satin glow that felt warm to the touch. The light from the window flowed over its surface like water, catching the intricate dance of the wood grain and the subtle, jewelled colours of the restored marquetry. It was no longer sick. It was luminous, alive, its history of damage not erased, but integrated into a new and more beautiful whole. Aoife stood back, her arms crossed, every muscle in her body aching with a deep, satisfying fatigue. She could see her own faint reflection in the polished walnut, not a ghost, not a void, not a shimmering absence, but the solid, breathing form of a woman. A woman with strong, capable hands. A woman who had faced down her own ghosts and had, through the slow, patient application of love and skill, learned how to mend.When Eleanor finally came into the study, drawn by the profound silence, she found Aoife standing before the desk, her hands loose at her sides, her posture one of deep, quiet stillness. The air in the room was thick with the resinous, almost fruity scent of shellac and the faint, warm smell of the wood itself. The desk glowed in the afternoon light, its surface a mirror of deep, liquid shadow and warm, honeyed fire. It was no longer a piece of furniture; it was a presence, an heirloom restored not just to its former glory, but to its very soul. Eleanor stopped in the doorway, her hand flying to her mouth, a soft, involuntary gasp escaping her lips. For a long moment, she said nothing, her eyes slowly travelling over the seamless surface, the resurrected colours of the inlay, the deep, warm lustre that seemed to emanate from within the wood itself.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s singing,\u201d she finally whispered, the words filled with a quiet awe. She walked slowly towards it, as one might approach a shy, wild creature, her hand outstretched. She did not touch it at first, but simply hovered her palm over the surface, as if feeling its warmth, its energy. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen it look like this since I was a little girl, watching my grandmother polish it. I thought this\u2026 this life in it was gone forever.\u201d She finally let her fingertips make contact, her touch feather-light on the five-petalled flower. She looked at Aoife, her eyes shining with unshed tears. \u201cYou are a magician, Aoife. A true artist. You haven't just repaired it. You have healed it.\u201d The word, \u2018healed\u2019, struck Aoife with the force of a physical blow, a validation so complete and so resonant that it left her breathless. This was the language she had been searching for, the true name for the work she had just done, both on the desk and on herself.\n\nThe business of payment felt like a clumsy, profane intrusion after such a moment, but it was necessary. Eleanor insisted on paying her five hundred euro, a hundred more than the quoted price. \u201cFor artistry,\u201d she said simply, pressing the notes into Aoife\u2019s hand and closing her own fingers over them, refusing any argument. \u201cAnd for kindness.\u201d But the real payment came a moment later. \u201cI am the secretary of the local historical society,\u201d Eleanor said, her tone becoming more business-like, though the warmth never left her eyes. \u201cWe have a number of pieces in our small collection that are in a similar state of gentle decay. And I have friends, many friends, with beautiful old things they are afraid to trust to just anyone. I would be honoured, Aoife, if you would allow me to give them your number.\u201d It was more than an offer of work; it was a key. It was an invitation into a world where her unique, quiet skills would be not just used, but cherished. It was the promise of a future built not on survival, but on beauty.\n\nWalking back to her bedsit, the crisp notes a solid weight in her pocket, Aoife felt a lightness she had never known. The city no longer felt like a place to hide, but a place to inhabit. The faces of the people she passed were not potential threats, but simply other people, living their own complex lives alongside her. The familiar architecture of the Dublin streets seemed to welcome her, its faded grandeur a tapestry she was now a part of. She felt an ownership of her own steps, a right to the space she occupied, that was entirely new. For her entire life, she had felt like a secret, an apology, a person living on borrowed time and a borrowed name. Now, walking under the wide, open sky, she felt, for the first time, irrefutably real. Her existence was not a lie. It was a fact, as solid and tangible as the pavement beneath her feet.\n\nBack in her room, the sanctuary she had built for herself, she did not collapse in exhausted relief. Instead, she was filled with a clear, quiet energy. She went to her workbench and took out a clean sheet of drawing paper and a sharp pencil. She began to sketch, not the plans for a piece of furniture, but a design. A logo. She drew a simple, elegant circle, and within it, the clean, intersecting lines of a dovetail joint, a symbol of strength, integrity, and hidden beauty. Beneath it, she carefully lettered a name: \u2018True Grain Restorations\u2019. It felt right. It was honest. It spoke of the wood, but it also spoke of her own journey, of following the flaw back to its source and finding the true grain of her own character beneath the warp and stain of the past. For the first time, she envisioned a future where she was not just Aoife, the quiet carpenter, but Aoife, the proprietor of her own business, a woman defined not by her history, but by her craft.\n\nA few days later, a sense of rightness guided her back to The Auld Triangle. She pushed open the heavy door in the late afternoon, when the pub was in its usual state of quiet, beery contemplation. A few of the same old men were at the bar, and they looked up as she entered, a flicker of recognition in their eyes. Declan was behind the bar, polishing a glass. He saw her, and his usual impassive expression didn't change, but he gave a single, almost imperceptible nod of acknowledgement. He was no longer looking at the fainting girl, but at the carpenter who had fixed his door. She walked to the bar, the floorboards solid and silent beneath her feet, and ordered a half-pint of Guinness. The act of sitting at the bar, of being a customer in this place that had been the scene of her deepest humiliation, was a quiet, powerful reclamation. Declan set the drink before her, the dark liquid settling under its creamy head. \"Heard that fella Duffy's been keeping you busy,\" he grunted, his back to her as he stocked a shelf with glasses. \"Heard you told him where to go, as well.\" He turned, a flicker of something like a smile at the corner of his mouth. \"Good for you. He pays, but he's a miserable sod.\" The gruff approval, the sense of being included in the pub's network of gossip and judgment, was more welcoming than a red carpet. She was no longer an outsider to be scrutinised, but a known quantity, a part of the local ecosystem.\n\nThat evening, as she climbed the stairs to her bedsit, a deep sense of peace settled over her. She had money in the bank, the promise of meaningful work to come, and a fragile, growing sense of community in this city that had taken her in. She was tired, but it was the deep, satisfying ache of a day well spent, of a life being built with her own two hands. Her key slid into the lock, the sound familiar and comforting. Home. As she pushed the door open, she saw it immediately. A single, white envelope lying on the welcome mat, where it must have been slipped under the door. It was out of place in her spartan, paperless world. It wasn't a bill; it wasn't a circular. She bent to pick it up, a mild curiosity turning to a sudden, sharp chill as she saw the handwriting. It was a neat, slightly anxious cursive, every letter perfectly formed, every line perfectly straight. It was a hand she would know in the dark, a hand she had seen on birthday cards and shopping lists her entire life. It was her mother\u2019s. The peace of the evening shattered into a thousand pieces. The ghost she had silenced in the sunlit study was nothing compared to this. This was the original ghost, the source of it all, reaching out across the Irish Sea to reclaim her. The past was not finished with her. It had found her address.For a long, frozen moment, Aoife did not breathe. The envelope in her hand was a sliver of ice, its chill seeping not into her skin but directly into her bones. The world she had so carefully, so painstakingly, constructed over the past few weeks\u2014a world of quiet work, of solid objects, of manageable fears\u2014crumbled to dust in the space of a single heartbeat. Her room, her sanctuary, was no longer safe. The locked door was a joke, the four walls a cage whose location was now known. The past had not just found her address; it had breached her perimeter, slipped under her door like a poisonous gas, and was now occupying the very air she was trying to breathe.\n\nHer mother\u2019s handwriting was a weapon of terrifying intimacy. It was the hand that had written \u2018Aoife\u2019 on the flyleaf of her first book, the hand that had penned consoling notes when she was a lonely, awkward teenager. Each perfectly formed letter was a hook, each neat, straight line a thread in the web she had just escaped. It was the script of a lifetime of love, a love so deeply entangled with the foundational lie of her existence that she could no longer tell the two apart. The very sight of it was a summons back to a life of apology, of being a problem to be managed, a secret to be kept. Her first, overwhelming instinct was to burn it, to destroy the physical evidence of the intrusion, to pretend it had never happened. Her second was to run, to pack her tools and flee into the night, to find another city, another anonymous room, and start the desperate, exhausting process all over again.\n\nThen the feeling started. Not a whisper this time, but a roar. A profound, internal vertigo, a sickening lurch as if the floor had dropped away from beneath her. The edges of her vision began to fizz and dissolve, the familiar shapes of her room\u2014the workbench, the single chair, the neat stack of books\u2014wavering as if seen through intense heat. The cold was a violent invasion, a hostile presence that drove the warmth from her body and replaced it with the absolute zero of the void. This was it. The direct confrontation, the thing she had been running from, and it was going to unmake her in the safety of her own home. She staggered back, her uninjured hand flying to her chest, trying to feel the solid beat of her own heart, but her fingers felt numb, disconnected, their substance already questionable. Panic was a silent scream in a vacuum. She was losing.\n\nHer gaze, frantic and unfocused, fell upon her workbench. The beechwood, glowing faintly in the lamplight. The neat, ordered row of her tools, their steel edges gleaming. The drawing of her logo, a symbol of a future she had dared to imagine. *No.* The word was a silent, furious rebellion. It was a refusal. She would not be erased by a piece of paper. She would not allow her mother\u2019s fearful love to be the thing that finally broke her. Lurching across the room, she slammed her good hand down flat on the workbench, the solid, unyielding shock of the impact a thunderclap in the silent chaos of her mind. She gripped the sharp, square edge of the wood, her knuckles white, pouring every ounce of her will, every dreg of her newfound strength, into that single point of contact. *True Grain Restorations,* she thought, the words a desperate, powerful incantation. *This is who I am. This is my name. I am not a secret. I am a carpenter. I am solid. I am here.*\n\nThe fight was immense. The void pulled at her, a vast, silent tide, but the anchor of the workbench held. The pain in her bandaged hand flared in sympathy, a hot, throbbing reality. The scent of wood and oil, the sight of the pencil lines of her own design, the tangible weight of her own body leaning against the bench\u2014they were facts, and she clung to them as a drowning woman clings to a piece of wreckage. Slowly, agonizingly, the world solidified. The fizzing at the edges of her vision ceased. The colour returned to the room. The profound cold receded, leaving her trembling, drenched in sweat, and utterly exhausted, but whole. She was still holding the envelope, its paper now crumpled from the ferocity of her grip. She had not run. She had not burned it. She had held her ground. And she had won.\n\nWith a strange, cold calm that felt like the quiet eye of a hurricane, she sat down on her mattress and, using a thumbnail, slit the envelope open. The single sheet of paper inside was filled with that same neat, anxious script. It was everything she had feared. It was a mother\u2019s frantic, heartbroken plea, a litany of sleepless nights and imagined horrors. Eamonn, it said, was a wreck, haunted by what he had seen, oscillating between terror and a furious, protective anger. Maura wrote that she didn\u2019t understand what he was talking about\u2014vanishing, devilry, it was all nonsense\u2014but she knew her daughter was in pain, and that was the only truth that mattered. The letter ended with the two things Aoife dreaded most. The first was the confirmation: *\u2018I had to find you, my love. I gave a man your name, and he found where you opened the bank account. I am so sorry if it frightens you, but I couldn\u2019t bear not knowing.\u2019* The violation was confirmed. She had been hunted, her fragile privacy shattered by their loving, desperate panic.\n\nThe second was the final line: *\u2018Whatever this is, Aoife, we can fix it. Just come home. We will get you help. We will make it right. I love you. Mam.\u2019* *We can fix it. We will get you help.* The words were a cage, lovingly constructed, softly padded, but a cage all the same. She was not a person to them; she was a project, a problem patient. A deep, glacial anger began to form beneath her exhaustion and her fear. It was an anger at the casual, loving tyranny of their worry, at their assumption that she needed to be \u2018fixed\u2019, that her only path to wholeness was a return to the life that had been slowly erasing her. They saw her as broken, but she had just spent a week making something broken beautiful again. She had just found the true grain of herself. She would not allow them to plane it away.\n\nShe stood up and walked back to the workbench, the letter in her hand. For a moment, she considered her response. She could write back, a mirror image of her mother\u2019s letter, pleading for them to leave her be. But pleading was the language of a victim, and she was done being a victim. She needed a new language. She looked down at the design she had sketched, at the clean lines of the dovetail joint. Strength. Integrity. A union of two separate pieces that was stronger than the wood itself. She picked up a fresh sheet of paper, not the cheap notepad she used for quotes, but a heavy, cream-coloured sheet of drawing paper. She took her sharpest pencil, and in a hand that was not her mother's anxious cursive, but her own clear, precise, architectural script, she began to write. It was not a long letter. It was not a plea. It was a statement of fact. It was a declaration. And it was the first completely honest thing she had ever written to her family in her entire life.The pencil felt light and sure in her hand. Where Maura\u2019s script was a nervous, forward-slanting rush of anxieties corralled into neat lines, Aoife\u2019s was the upright, measured script of an architect, each letter a small, considered structure. She was not writing a response to her mother\u2019s plea; she was issuing a correction, a revision to the story they had all been living. There would be no frantic emotion, no tide of resentment. There would only be the clean, solid lines of the truth as she now understood it. She dipped the pencil lead onto the creamy paper, the soft rasp a sound of quiet creation.\n\n*Dear Mam,* she wrote, then paused, and with deliberate firmness, added, *and Eamonn*. They were a unit in this, the twin pillars of the loving, suffocating pressure that had almost crushed her. *I have your letter. I am writing to tell you that I am safe. More than that, I am well. I understand that you are worried, and I know that your worry comes from love. But you must understand this: I am not sick, and I do not need to be fixed.* The words sat on the page, stark and unequivocal. She thought of the warped door on the mahogany wardrobe, of Eamonn\u2019s instinct to force it, and her own patient work of planing it back to truth. The right metaphor came to her, a piece of wood shaped to fit the space. *You cannot force a warped piece of timber straight; you will only break it. It needs time, and the right conditions, to find its own stability. I have found those conditions here. I am working. I have a life that I am building with my own two hands, a life that makes sense to me.*\n\nThe most difficult part came next: the boundary. This could not be a negotiation. It had to be a wall, cleanly and firmly built. *The greatest help you can give me now is to trust me. The greatest love you can show me is to let me be. For that to happen, you cannot look for me. You cannot send letters. You cannot ask people to find me. It is not safe for me when you do.* The ambiguity of that last sentence was a shield. They would read it as a cry of fragile emotional health; she knew it as a statement of literal, existential fact. Her survival depended on their absence. *I need time. When I am ready, I will be in touch. But it will be on my terms, in my own time.* She paused, her pencil hovering over the bottom of the page. How to sign it? Not \u2018your daughter\u2019, not \u2018your step-sister\u2019. Those were the old names, the old lies. She simply wrote her name, *Aoife*. It was enough. It was everything. As a final, declarative act, she folded the drawing of her logo\u2014the dovetail joint in its perfect circle\u2014and slipped it into the envelope with the letter. It was not an explanation, but a new emblem, a new coat of arms for the sovereign state of her own life.\n\nShe did not post it that night. She sealed the envelope and placed it on her workbench, next to her sharpening stones. It was a promise she would keep in the morning. The act of writing, of articulating her own position with such finality, had drained the last of her adrenaline, leaving a profound, bone-deep weariness in its place. But beneath the exhaustion was a solid foundation of peace. The crisis had not been averted; it had been met. She slept that night without dreams, a deep, restorative plunge into a darkness that was not a void, but a quiet, restful space. In the morning, she walked to the pillar box on the corner, the white envelope a stark, clean rectangle in her hand. The city was waking around her, the air crisp and full of the smell of coffee and diesel fumes. The world was going about its business, indifferent to the small, monumental act she was about to perform. She slid the letter into the slot. The soft, definitive thud as it landed inside was the sound of a door closing on her old life, and another one, somewhere else, creaking open.\n\nReturning to the room, she felt a profound sense of lightness. The space was hers again, the air clean. There was no ghost of her mother\u2019s handwriting on the mat, no lingering chill of a breached perimeter. She made herself a cup of tea and then, with a sense of quiet ceremony, she cleared her workbench, wiping away the pencil dust and laying out a soft cloth. From a carefully wrapped package in her tool roll, she took out the drawer from Eleanor\u2019s desk, its new finish glowing with a deep, inner life. She had brought it back with her for one final, obsessive round of polishing. As she applied a tiny amount of wax and began to buff the surface with slow, circular motions, she was not just finishing a job. She was reaffirming her choice, polishing her own new reality until it shone. The rhythm of the work was a prayer, each sweep of the cloth a declaration: *This is my life. This is my peace. This is what is real.*\n\nA few days later, her phone rang. The number was unfamiliar. For a second, the old, conditioned reflex of fear made her stomach clench, but it was a phantom pain, an echo of a fear that no longer had teeth. She answered, her voice calm. \"Hello?\" \"Hello, is that Aoife?\" a man\u2019s voice asked, warm and with a gentle, west-of-Ireland lilt. \"My name is Peter Joyce. Eleanor Vance gave me your number. She said you were something of a miracle worker.\" Aoife smiled, a real, unforced smile that reached her eyes. \"Eleanor is very kind,\" she said. \"She said you restore old things,\" he continued. \"Well, I have a library chair. My father\u2019s chair. The leg is broken, but more than that\u2026 it\u2019s just lost its spirit. Eleanor said you would understand what I mean.\"\n\nAoife looked around her small, sunlit room, at the workbench she had built, at the city stretching out beyond her window. The work was waiting. A life was waiting. It was a life of mending broken things, of coaxing the spirit back into forgotten objects, of patience and love made visible over time. She had found her place, not by running from the flaw in her own grain, but by following it, by working with it, until she had shaped it into a strength. The path ahead was uncertain, but it was hers, and she would walk it in her own time. She picked up a pencil, ready to take down the address. \"Yes,\" she said, her voice filled with a quiet, steady confidence. \"I understand completely.\"",

                                        "text": "The grain of the oak ran true under her palm, a current of silent history. Aoife traced the line with a calloused fingertip, feeling the faint ridges and valleys of its life. Here, in the organised chaos of her workshop, things made sense. Wood didn't lie. It might warp if you mistreated it, or split if you were impatient, but its nature was honest. You could read a plank of pine like a page, see the fat years and the lean ones in the spacing of its rings. It was a language she understood better than the clipped, guarded conversations that filled the rest of her life. The air tasted of ghosts of trees \u2013 of sawdust and linseed oil and the sharp tang of varnish. It was her sanctuary, this small, rented space tucked away behind a row of terraced houses in East Belfast, with the colossal yellow heads of the Harland & Wolff cranes, Samson and Goliath, peering over the rooftops like two ancient, weary gods.\n\nIt was a lie, of course. Everything was. The biggest lie was the one she lived every day, the one that felt more true than any fact. The second biggest lie was that she was just Aoife, the quiet carpenter with the sad eyes and the surprisingly strong hands. The truth was something stranger, something that had begun to shimmer at the edges of her vision, like heat haze off summer tarmac. It had started small. A flicker in the mirror, a moment where her reflection seemed to lag a half-second behind her movement. Once, reaching for a chisel, she\u2019d seen the tool through the faint outline of her own hand. She\u2019d blamed exhaustion, the low, persistent hum of fatigue that had been her companion for years. She\u2019d blamed the dust motes dancing in the weak afternoon light. She blamed anything but the impossible notion that she was, for a fraction of a second, fading away.\n\nThe bell above the workshop door jangled, a sound that always set her teeth on edge. She didn't have to look up to know who it was. Eamonn had a specific way of disturbing the air, a heavy presence that sucked the warmth from a room. He was her step-brother, a term that felt both technically correct and profoundly wrong. Her mother, Maura, had married his father when Aoife was ten and Eamonn was already a man of twenty-five. His father had passed a few years back, leaving Eamonn as the reluctant, default patriarch of their fractured family.\n\n\"Smells like a bloody forest fire in here,\" he grumbled, closing the door and plunging the workshop back into its familiar gloom. He stood in the doorway, a solid, thick-set man in a worn tweed jacket, his face a roadmap of disapproval.\n\n\"It's varnish, Eamonn. Same as it was last week.\" Aoife didn't turn around. She kept her focus on the wardrobe door she was sanding, the rhythmic scrape of paper on wood a shield against him.\n\n\"Should be getting more sun than this. It's not healthy, cooped up in the dark.\"\n\n\"The wood doesn't need a tan.\"\n\nHer relationship with Eamonn was a piece of warped timber she\u2019d been trying to plane smooth her whole life. It was impossible. There was a knot of something hard and unspoken between them that resisted every tool she had. He was by turns overly protective and dismissively critical. He\u2019d check the locks on her doors but scoff at the price she charged for a bespoke bookcase. He\u2019d bring her soup when she was sick and then tell her she looked like a ghost. He never, ever seemed at ease around her.\n\n\"Maura's worried,\" he said, moving further into the room, his heavy boots scuffing through the sawdust. \"Says you're not eating. Says you look\u2026\" he trailed off, searching for the word.\n\n\"Like a ghost?\" Aoife supplied, her voice flat. She finally turned, leaning back against her workbench. She looked at him, at the tired lines around his eyes, the way his jaw was perpetually set. He was her father. The thought came unbidden, a jolt of cold, hard fact that she had to swallow down every time she saw him. He didn\u2019t know that she knew. Her mother had confessed it one tear-sodden, whiskey-fuelled night years ago, a secret passed like a curse. Eamonn had been seventeen, a scared boy who\u2019d gotten her sixteen-year-old mother pregnant and whose own father, a man of stern, unbending principle, had arranged a story to keep the shame at bay. Maura was sent to relatives in England, the baby was born, and a year later she returned and eventually married the old man, bringing the child with her. The boy, her son, became the daughter of her new husband and the step-sister of the boy who was her father. A neat, cruel solution. A lifetime of lies built on a single, desperate one.\n\n\"You've a smart mouth on you, girl,\" he said, his eyes scanning the workshop, avoiding her own. \"That's half your trouble.\"\n\n\"What's the other half?\" The question was a challenge, and they both knew it. Her existence was the trouble. The secret she carried, the secret he didn't know she knew, was the trouble. The fact that she had grown up to be Aoife, not the son he had secretly fathered, was a deep and abiding trouble that hung in the air between them, thick as the dust.\n\n\"You're too much in your own head,\" he said, finally landing on a safe criticism. \"Always were. You need to get out. Meet someone. A nice fella.\"\n\nThe words landed like small, sharp stones. *A nice fella.* Every time he said it, a fresh wave of resentment washed over her. It was his way of trying to force her into a box she had fought her entire life to escape. He wanted her to be normal, to be something he could understand. And the more he pushed, the more she felt an overwhelming, suffocating urge to simply\u2026 vanish.\n\n\"I'm busy,\" she said, her voice tight. \"I have work.\"\n\n\"This isn't a life, Aoife. It's a hobby you get paid for. Hiding in here with bits of wood. It's not right for a woman your age.\"\n\nThere it was. The pressure point. The feeling of being scrutinized, judged, and found wanting. The desperate, clawing need to be anywhere else, to be no one. The light from the high, grimy windows went syrupy. The drone of a distant siren seemed to stretch and slow, bending into a low moan. A familiar coldness seeped into her bones, a feeling like plunging her hands into ice water.\n\n\"Stop it, Eamonn,\" she whispered, a plea.\n\n\"Stop what? Stop caring? Someone has to. Your mother's tearing her hair out and you're in here playing with splinters, looking thinner every day. What am I supposed to do?\" His voice was rising, laced with a frustration that was twenty-odd years in the making.\n\n\"Just... leave me be.\"\n\nShe squeezed her eyes shut. The feeling was stronger this time, a powerful undertow pulling her out from the shore of herself. *I'm not here. You can't see me. I'm not here.* It was an old childhood mantra, a game she used to play to escape her mother\u2019s anxieties or her grandfather\u2019s stern gaze. But it wasn't a game anymore.\n\nA sharp clatter echoed in the sudden silence.\n\nAoife opened her eyes. Eamonn was staring, his face ashen, his mouth slightly agape. He wasn't looking at her. He was looking *through* her, at the wall of tools hanging on the board behind where she stood. The sanding block she had been holding lay on the floor at her feet, having slipped from a hand that was no longer there. She looked down. Her arms, her chest, her legs \u2013 they were gone. She was a ghost. A void in the shape of a person, the dusty air of the workshop the only thing occupying the space where her body should be. The cold was absolute now, a profound and terrifying emptiness.\n\n\"Aoife?\" Eamonn breathed, the word a ragged puff of disbelief. He took a hesitant step forward, his hand outstretched, not to touch her, but to wave through the space she inhabited. His hand passed through her sternum without resistance. A strangled noise escaped his throat, a sound of pure, primal fear. \"What devilry is this? What in God's name are you?\""

She was a conscious absence, a thinking void. She could see the workshop around her, every detail sharp and clear: the panicked, wide-eyed horror on Eamonn's face, the fine layer of dust on a stack of unsanded ash, the lazy curl of a wood shaving on the floor. Yet she couldn't feel the floor. She couldn't feel the solid wood of the workbench she had been leaning against. She was unmoored from the world, a kite whose string had been cut, and the wind was blowing her out into a vast, cold nothingness. The mantra that had been her shield had become her cage. *I am here*, she thought, a desperate, silent rebuttal. *I am here. Let me be here.*\n\nEamonn stumbled back, his hand retracting as if he'd touched a live wire. He collided with a half-finished chest of drawers, sending a pot of wood glue skittering across its top to crash onto the floor in a sticky puddle. The sound was unnaturally loud in the quiet space. He was breathing hard, his chest heaving under the tweed jacket. His gaze, wild and terrified, darted around the space she occupied, trying to find a rational explanation where none existed. He was a man who understood foundations, load-bearing walls, and the unyielding logic of a mortise and tenon joint. What he was seeing was an affront to the very laws of physics that governed his world. He looked from the empty space to the sanding block on the floor, then back again. The evidence was irrefutable and insane.\n\n\"Saints preserve us,\" he whispered, his voice trembling. He fumbled in his jacket pocket, his knuckles white, and pulled out a small, worn rosary. His fingers worked the beads clumsily, a frantic, instinctual prayer. \"This is not of God. This is dark work, Aoife.\" His fear was curdling into accusation, the only way his mind could process the impossible. He was looking for a familiar enemy, for sin and retribution, for a devil he could name rather than a mystery he could not. \"What have you been meddling in?\"\n\nHis words, his terror, were a lifeline. The raw, powerful force of his emotion was an anchor in the formless sea she was drifting in. His fear made her real. A flicker, like a faulty lightbulb, started in the air where her heart should be. The profound cold began to recede, chased back by a pins-and-needles agony as her nerves began to fire again. The scent of varnish and sawdust rushed back in, overwhelming her. She could feel the rough texture of the workbench against her back, the solid reality of the concrete floor under her worn boots. The shimmering intensified, a frantic kaleidoscope of light and workshop air, until, with a final, gut-wrenching lurch, she solidified. She gasped, a deep, shuddering intake of breath that felt like her first.\n\nShe stood there, panting, her limbs trembling with a violent, bone-deep tremor. The world felt too loud, too bright, too solid. The tremor wasn't from cold anymore, but from the shock of re-entry, the psychic whiplash of being ripped from nothingness back into being. She looked at Eamonn, who was frozen in place, the rosary clutched in his fist like a weapon. The disapproval was gone from his face, replaced by an expression of such profound shock and fear that he looked like a stranger. He stared at her, at her solid, breathing, trembling form, and the truth of what he had just witnessed settled over him, heavy and suffocating as a shroud. The lie she lived and the lie he didn't know he was a part of had just been violently eclipsed. He was no longer just her step-brother, or her secret father, or her reluctant guardian. He was now the sole witness to her impossibility."

                                        "text": "For a long moment, there was no sound but the frantic, tiny clicking of the wooden beads of the rosary against each other in Eamonn\u2019s trembling hand. He stared, his face a mask of waxy disbelief. \"The\u2026 the light,\" he stammered, his voice thin and reedy. \"You were gone. There was just the light on the wall behind you. I put my hand...\" He couldn\u2019t finish the sentence, the physical memory of passing his hand through empty space making him visibly shudder. He took another clumsy step back, his foot crunching on a stray screw on the floor. The raw fear in his eyes was undeniable, but underneath it, a harder, colder emotion was beginning to form, like ice on a winter puddle. It was judgment.\n\nAoife wrapped her arms around herself, a futile attempt to still the violent shaking that wracked her body. The tremors originated from a place too deep to be controlled by muscle alone. \"I don't know,\" she whispered, her voice hoarse and raw. \"Eamonn, I don't know what that was.\" It was the unvarnished truth, but it sounded like a pathetic lie even to her own ears. How could a person not know how they had just ceased to exist for a few moments? The very concept was a nonsense, yet it was her new, terrifying reality. The secret she had been hiding from herself was now out, and it was as incomprehensible to her as it was to him.\n\n\"Don't you lie to me,\" he snarled, the fear finally giving way to a more familiar, blustering anger. It was his shield, just as her sanding block had been hers. \"Not about this. I saw it, Aoife. With my own two eyes. This isn't some trick of the light or a woman's hysteria. This is an abomination. Have you been seeing people? Dabbling in things you shouldn't? The things you read, the solitude\u2026 it turns a person's mind.\" He gestured wildly around the workshop, as if the answer lay in the stacked timber or the jars of pigment. He was desperately building a case, creating a narrative that could contain the horror, a story where she was the guilty party, the one who had invited this darkness into their lives.\n\nThe injustice of it was a physical blow. After the terror, the bone-aching cold, the dizzying vertigo of non-existence, to be met not with concern but with condemnation was a cruelty that burned away the last dregs of her shock. \"Dabbling?\" she repeated, her voice gaining a dangerous edge of disbelief. \"Reading? Is that what you think this is, Eamonn? You think I learned how to do\u2026 *that*\u2026 from a book?\" The sheer absurdity of it, the smallness of his accusation in the face of the cosmic horror she had just experienced, was almost enough to make her laugh. A hysterical, broken sound bubbled in her chest. \"There's no book for this! There's no secret coven! This is happening *to* me!\"\n\n\"Things like this don't just 'happen'!\" he roared, taking a step forward, his bulk seeming to fill the small workshop and suck all the air out. \"God is not mocked! You've opened a door to something, girl, and you need to close it. We need a priest. We need to get this place blessed. You need\u2026\" He stopped, his face contorting as he looked at her, truly looked at her. Not as a problem to be solved or a responsibility to be managed, but as the source of his terror. His daughter. His monstrous, impossible daughter. He looked down at the rosary in his hand, as if it were a talisman that had failed him, then back at her. A new wave of fear, colder and more profound than the first, washed over him. He wasn't equipped for this. No man was.\n\nHe turned then, a jerky, uncoordinated movement, and fled. He didn't say another word, just wrenched the workshop door open, letting in a blinding slice of grey afternoon light, and was gone. The bell jangled frantically, a panicked shriek that slowly faded, leaving Aoife utterly alone. She stood, still shaking, in the sudden, deafening silence of her violated sanctuary. The air still tasted of sawdust and varnish, but now it was laced with the metallic tang of her own fear and the lingering, spectral chill of his. The lie had broken. And the truth, she was beginning to understand, was far more terrifying than she could ever have imagined."

The frantic jangle of the bell faded, leaving a ringing in Aoife\u2019s ears that was indistinguishable from the thrumming of her own blood. For a full minute, she remained frozen, her arms still wrapped around her torso as if holding herself together by force. She felt impossibly solid, her limbs heavy with lead, her very bones aching with the strain of their sudden reappearance. The phantom chill of the void lingered in her marrow, a deep, internal cold that the familiar warmth of the workshop could not touch. With a slow, deliberate movement that felt like wading through deep water, she walked to the door and pushed it shut. The latch clicked into place with a sound of profound finality, sealing her back inside her violated haven.\n\nShe didn't return to her workbench. Instead, she slid down the rough-plastered wall until she was sitting on the concrete floor, her knees drawn up to her chest amidst a sea of pale wood shavings. She pressed her palms flat against the gritty floor, needing the rough, cold, unyielding proof of it. The workshop had always been her reality, the one place where truth was tangible. Now, it was the scene of an impossible crime against nature, and she was both the victim and the perpetrator. She replayed the sensation, the terrifying lightness, the feeling of being unthreaded, of her physical self dissolving like sugar in water. It wasn't painful. It was worse. It was a complete and total negation. The only thing that had pulled her back from that endless, silent sea was him. His terror had been her anchor. The thought was grotesque, a cruel irony that twisted in her gut. The man whose existence made her want to disappear was the very reason she had been able to come back.\n\nThe mantra. *I'm not here. You can't see me.* It had been a shield, a whisper of defiance against a world that was too much. Against Maura\u2019s smothering worry, against her grandfather\u2019s disappointed scowl, and most of all, against Eamonn. It was always strongest around him, when his presence crowded her, judging the life she had built, the person she had become. He looked at her and saw a failure, a sad spinster hiding from life. He didn't see the artist who could coax stories from dead trees, or the woman who had built a fragile peace for herself from splinters and solitude. He saw only what she wasn't. And in the face of that relentless, unspoken disappointment, her deepest, most primal wish was simply to cease to be an object for his gaze. The wish, it seemed, had been granted.\n\nThe sharp, insistent buzz of her mobile phone on the workbench was a violent assault on the quiet. The screen lit up the gloom with a single, dreaded word: Maura. Of course. Eamonn, a man of simple, frantic action, would have driven straight to his mother's house, the family's designated epicentre of all crisis. He would have burst in, pale and shaking, interrupting her afternoon tea. Aoife could picture it with sickening clarity: his garbled, terrified account of devilry and vanishing acts, of her turning into thin air right before his eyes. And she could picture her mother, her face crumbling, the worry she wore like a second skin flaring into outright panic. The phone buzzed again, a frantic, electronic plea. It was a summons. A demand for an explanation she did not have, for a reassurance she could not possibly give.\n\nAnswering that call was an impossibility. It would be like trying to describe the colour of air to a blind person. The truth was monstrous, and any lie she could concoct would be an insult to the terror he had witnessed. She stared at the phone as it finally fell silent, leaving an even more profound quiet in its wake. Eamonn\u2019s fear had been sharp and loud, but her mother\u2019s would be a different thing entirely. It would be a quiet, suffocating fog of doctors and priests, of whispered consultations and tearful pleas. They would try to fix her. To pray her back to normality, or medicate her, or have her blessed. They would smother her with their fearful, loving concern. She looked around the workshop, at the half-finished wardrobe, at the neat rows of her tools, at the comforting, organised chaos. It was no longer a sanctuary. It was a cage, and the keepers were on their way. He had seen her. The one secret she hadn't even known she was keeping was out, and it would change everything. A cold resolve, hard and clear as glass, settled over her. She couldn't stay. She couldn't be found. The grain of her own existence had proven faulty, warped by a secret she could no longer plane smooth. There was only one thing to do. She had to follow the flaw in the wood and see where it led."

                                        "text": "The resolve did not bring warmth, but clarity. It was a cold, sharp-edged thing that cut through the fog of panic and left a single, clear path forward. She had to run. She got to her feet, her movements stiff but deliberate, the practiced economy of a person who works with their body every day. The tremors had subsided into a low, internal hum, the vibration of a string pulled too tight. Her mind, so recently a chaotic storm, was now focused on the simple, practical logistics of disappearing.\n\nFirst, money. In a loose-lidded tea caddy marked \u2018Spirits of Turpentine\u2019 she kept her cash, the untaxed earnings from jobs paid for in wrinkled notes. It wasn\u2019t much, a few hundred pounds at most, a pathetic sum to start a new life with. She stuffed the notes into the pocket of her jeans without counting them. Then, her tools. She couldn't take the heavy machinery, the band saw or the lathe that were her livelihood. They were anchors, too heavy for a ghost to carry. Instead, she unstrapped the worn leather roll from the wall, the one her grandfather had given her before his sternness had fully calcified. Inside, nestled in their individual pockets, were her hand tools: the Japanese pull-saws with their impossibly fine teeth, the set of chisels she honed to a mirror finish every Sunday, the small, palm-sized block plane that fit the curve of her hand as if it had been grown there. They were more a part of her than the flesh and blood that had so recently betrayed her. They were her language, her history, her hands. She rolled them up tightly, the familiar weight a small, solid comfort against the terrifying lightness in her soul.\n\nShe pulled on her heavy, wax-cotton jacket, the one that smelled perpetually of damp earth and sawdust. The familiar constraint of it around her shoulders was grounding. She looked around the workshop, her gaze sweeping over the organised chaos. The half-finished wardrobe stood like a patient accusation. A child\u2019s rocking horse, awaiting a final coat of varnish, seemed to watch her with its uncarved eyes. She was leaving a world of unfinished things, of promises she could no longer keep. For a second, a wave of grief so profound it was dizzying washed over her, and she felt the strange, cold tingle in her extremities, the warning tremor of dissolution. She fought it down, her jaw clenched, focusing on the rough texture of the door in front of her. She would not fade here. Not again. She pulled the main breaker, plunging the workshop into a deeper gloom lit only by the grey evening light filtering through the grimy panes. With a final, decisive click, she locked the door from the outside, the sound echoing in the narrow alleyway. Her sanctuary was now her tomb.\n\nThe Belfast air was damp and cold, carrying the distant scent of the lough and the closer, more acrid smell of traffic. She pulled her hood up, burying her face in its shadow, and began to walk. The colossal yellow heads of Samson and Goliath were stark against the bruised purple of the twilight sky. They had watched over her entire life, silent witnesses to the city's agonies and its fragile peace. Tonight, they felt like sentinels at the gate of a prison she was finally escaping. She walked quickly, sticking to the backstreets, her boots crunching on broken glass in the unlit alleyways. Every distant siren, every pair of approaching headlights, sent a fresh jolt of adrenaline through her. She imagined Eamonn\u2019s car cruising the streets, or her mother, frantic, already out searching. The city, her home, had become a web, and she was the fly desperately trying to reach its edge without alerting the spider.\n\nAs she passed a row of terraced houses, their windows glowing with the warm, ordinary light of other people\u2019s lives, a wave of profound otherness washed over her. A man laughed inside one of the houses, a deep, hearty sound, and the noise seemed to pass right through her. Panic flared, cold and sharp. She glanced down at her hand as she shoved it deeper into her jacket pocket and saw, for a terrifying half-second, the faint, ghostly image of the brick wall through her own knuckles. It was like looking through smoked glass. She squeezed her fist tight, her short nails digging into her palm, focusing on the sharp, real points of pain. *Solid*, she thought, the word a desperate prayer. *I am solid. I am here.* The transparency receded, the flesh and bone of her hand reasserting their dominance, but she was left breathless, a fine sheen of cold sweat on her brow. The power, or the curse, was not a switch she could flip. It was a fault line running through her, ready to crack at any moment.\n\nThe Europa Buscentre was an island of harsh, fluorescent light and restless motion. It smelled of diesel fumes, stale coffee, and the faint, collective anxiety of departure. Here, faces were transient, gazes turned inward or fixed on the flickering departure boards. No one looked at her. The anonymity she craved was a physical cloak she could pull tighter around herself. She stood before the list of destinations, a litany of unfamiliar towns and distant cities. Dublin. Derry. Galway. London. Each name was a potential future, a blank page. The choice felt momentous and utterly arbitrary. A bus was boarding for Dublin, its engine a low, impatient rumble in the bay outside. It was leaving in ten minutes. It was south. It was across a border. It was away. That was enough. She walked to the ticket window, her movements stiff, and pushed a few of the crumpled notes from her pocket under the glass. \"One way,\" she said, her voice a stranger's croak. \"To Dublin.\" The ticket that slid back was a flimsy, tangible piece of her escape. It was the first honest thing she had held all day."

                                        "text": "The bus was warm and smelled of stale air freshener and damp coats. Aoife found a seat by a window two-thirds of the way down, sinking into the worn velour with a sigh that was part exhaustion, part relief. She pressed her forehead against the cool glass, watching the organised chaos of the station through the rain-streaked pane. Passengers hurried past, pulling wheeled cases, saying their goodbyes with tight hugs or casual waves. Each one of them seemed anchored to the world by a thousand invisible threads of connection and purpose. She, by contrast, felt like a spectre already, haunting the edge of their reality, her only connection the flimsy paper ticket clutched in her pocket. The heavy roll of her tools rested on the seat beside her, a solid, reassuring weight that was the only piece of her old life she had allowed herself to keep.\n\nAs the bus lurched into motion, pulling away from the bay with a hydraulic hiss, a fresh wave of panic threatened to crest. She was doing it. She was actually leaving. The bus navigated the wet city streets, the familiar landmarks of her life sliding past the window like stills from a film she was no longer in. The grand, soot-stained fa\u00e7ade of City Hall, the bright lights of the Cathedral Quarter, the dark, brooding mass of the Albert Clock. Then, as they climbed onto the motorway, she saw them. Samson and Goliath, their colossal yellow forms floodlit against the ink-black sky, standing their eternal vigil over the shipyards. They had been the backdrop to her entire existence, the silent gods of her hometown. Seeing them now, shrinking in the distance, felt like a final, profound farewell. She had not realised until this moment how much they had felt like family, their steadfastness a silent reproach to the shifting, unstable foundations of her own. She watched until they were just two yellow pins pricking the darkness, and then they were gone.\n\nThe darkness of the motorway swallowed them. The rhythmic thrum of the engine and the swish of the wipers became a hypnotic mantra, lulling her into a state of weary introspection. Eamonn\u2019s terrified face swam in her vision, his accusation \u2013 *What devilry is this?* \u2013 echoing in the space between heartbeats. It was easier to process his fear than her mother\u2019s impending grief. Eamonn\u2019s reaction was primal, superstitious, but Maura\u2019s would be a tangled, suffocating web of love and worry and failure. She would blame herself. She would see Aoife\u2019s flight and her impossible affliction as a punishment for the original sin, the lie they had built their lives upon. The secret of Aoife\u2019s birth was a fault line running through their family, and now, it seemed, through the very fabric of Aoife\u2019s being. Was this it? Was this strange, terrifying dissolution a physical manifestation of her own illegitimate existence? A life built on a lie was perhaps not a life at all, just a temporary placeholder, easily erased.\n\nThe thought was so cold, so bleak, that it triggered the feeling again. It began as a faint tingling in her fingertips, a coolness spreading up her arms not from the window but from within. She looked down at her hands, resting on the worn denim of her jeans, and saw the dark fabric of the seat beneath them, faint but undeniable, as if she were made of murky water. Her breath hitched. Not now. Not here, trapped in a metal tube hurtling through the Irish night, surrounded by strangers. She shut her eyes, her mind scrambling for an anchor. The tools. The scent of linseed oil. The grain of the oak. She focused on the memory of wood running under her palm, its silent, honest history. She pictured the tight, concentric rings of a life lived, the fat years and the lean. It was a language she understood, a truth she could hold on to. *The wood is real*, she chanted internally, a desperate litany against the void. *The grain is true. I am solid. I am here.* She gripped the edge of her seat, her knuckles white, pouring all her concentration into the feeling of the rough fabric, the vibration of the bus, anything to tether her to the physical world. Slowly, agonizingly, the transparency receded, leaving her hands looking pale and bloodless, but blessedly, completely solid. She slumped back in her seat, trembling and clammy with sweat, the casual snores of the man in the seat across the aisle a bizarre counterpoint to the existential battle she had just fought and barely won.\n\nThey crossed the border without ceremony. There were no guards, no checkpoints, just a subtle change in the road signs, the miles turning to kilometres. Yet for Aoife, it felt like crossing an ocean. She had left the North. She had left the United Kingdom. She was in a different country, a different jurisdiction. Eamonn couldn't just turn up at her door here. Maura couldn't have her sectioned. They might not even look for her here. It was a flimsy shield, but it was the only one she had. As the bus drew closer to Dublin, the spidery web of motorways grew more complex, the lights of distant housing estates multiplying in the darkness. The anonymity that had been a concept in the Belfast bus station was about to become a stark, overwhelming reality. She was a stranger here, with a few hundred pounds, a roll of priceless tools, and a secret that was actively trying to unmake her.\n\nThe bus finally hissed to a stop in the cavernous, brightly-lit belly of Bus\u00e1ras, Dublin\u2019s central station. The sudden silence after the long journey was jarring. Passengers stretched, gathered their belongings, and shuffled towards the exit with the weary purpose of travellers who have arrived. Aoife remained in her seat for a moment, gathering her courage. Stepping off this bus was stepping into the unknown. She slung the heavy tool roll over her shoulder, the familiar weight a small comfort, and joined the stream of people heading out into the city. The air that hit her was different from Belfast\u2019s; softer, damper, thick with the smell of the Liffey and exhaust fumes. The noise was a constant, multi-layered roar of traffic, sirens, and the indistinct clamour of a thousand conversations. She stood on the pavement, a small, hooded figure buffeted by the current of late-night city life, utterly and terrifyingly alone. She had vanished from her old life, but the real test, she knew, was whether she could manage to exist in a new one."

                                        "text": "The current of people flowed around her, an urban river parting around a stone. Aoife stood rooted to the pavement outside Bus\u00e1ras, the heavy tool roll digging into her shoulder, a single point of familiar, painful reality. Dublin roared around her, a symphony of sounds she couldn't parse. The shriek of a Luas tram on its tracks, the melodic lilt of accents she wasn't tuned to, the percussive slam of a pub door releasing a wave of laughter and music into the damp night. It was all alien. Belfast\u2019s sounds were her own, a language she knew by heart; the growl of the city was a familiar beast. This was a different animal entirely, and she didn\u2019t know its nature, whether it would bite or ignore her completely. Her first instinct, born of a lifetime of keeping her head down, was to find shadow. She crossed the street, away from the harsh lights of the station, and began to walk, her direction chosen by a simple, desperate logic: away from the main thoroughfare, into the quieter, less conspicuous veins of the city.\n\nShe walked for what felt like an hour, her path a nervous, zigzagging route through a labyrinth of Georgian streets and modern glass-fronted offices. The city\u2019s structure was different here. The red brick uniformity of Belfast\u2019s terraces was replaced by a grander, if sometimes shabbier, elegance. Tall, narrow houses with brightly painted doors and ornate fanlights stood shoulder-to-shoulder, their upper windows dark and watchful. It was a city built on a different scale, with a different history etched into its bones. She felt her smallness, her utter irrelevance. It was what she had wanted, but the reality of it was a cold, hollow ache in her chest. Every passing Garda car made her flinch, her shoulders tightening under her jacket. Every group of laughing students felt like a jury. She was a foreign body, an impurity in the city\u2019s bloodstream, and she felt certain that at any moment, it would move to expel her.\n\nThe need for a roof was becoming urgent, a primal command overriding the fear. The damp cold was seeping through her jacket, and the exhaustion, held at bay for hours by adrenaline, was beginning to descend like a physical weight. She started looking for signs, her eyes scanning the doorways and basement windows for the tell-tale cursive of a B&B or the stark lettering of a hostel. She passed several, brightly lit and modern, their windows displaying credit card signs and tourist board accolades. She shied away from them instinctively. They were too clean, too official. They would want a credit card, a passport, a piece of identity she was no longer sure she possessed. Finally, on a quieter side street branching off a larger square, she saw it. A single, weakly illuminated sign that simply read \u2018Rooms\u2019. The paint was peeling from the black door and the brass number was tarnished, but it looked blessedly, beautifully anonymous.\n\nTaking a deep, unsteadying breath, she pushed the door. It opened into a narrow hallway that smelled of stale cigarette smoke, boiled cabbage, and damp carpet. A bare bulb hanging from a frayed flex cast a jaundiced light on the floral wallpaper, its pattern faded into brownish ambiguity. At the end of the hall, a small window slid open, revealing a woman with a cloud of dyed red hair and a face that looked like it had been set in a permanent expression of weary suspicion.\n\u201cCan I help you?\u201d the woman asked, her voice a gravelly Dublin rasp.\n\nThe simple question was a hurdle. Aoife\u2019s mouth was dry. She cleared her throat, the sound loud in the quiet hall. \u201cHave you a room? Just for one. For the night.\u201d\n\nThe woman\u2019s eyes travelled over her, taking in the hooded jacket, the grubby jeans, the heavy, odd-looking roll slung over her shoulder. It was the kind of scrutiny that made Aoife\u2019s skin crawl, the kind that made her want to fade. She felt a faint, familiar tingle at the base of her skull and dug her fingernails into her palm, inside her pocket. *Solid. Real. Just a girl looking for a room.* \u201cForty euro. In advance. And no visitors.\u201d\n\nAoife nodded, relief making her dizzy. She fumbled in her pocket for the crumpled notes, her fingers clumsy with cold. She pushed two twenties through the little window. \u201cDo you need a name?\u201d she asked, her voice barely a whisper.\n\nThe woman snorted, a short, sharp sound of amusement. \u201cI\u2019m not your mammy, love. As long as the cash is real, you can be the Queen of Sheba for all I care.\u201d She took a key with a heavy brass fob from a hook behind her and slid it across the worn wooden counter. \u201cNumber seven. Top of the stairs, to the back. Bathroom\u2019s on the landing. Don\u2019t be making a racket.\u201d The window slid shut with a decisive thud, the transaction complete.\n\nThe room was small and cold, containing a narrow iron-frame bed, a single wooden chair, and a small, scarred wardrobe whose door hung slightly ajar. A single window, its sash warped, looked out over a dark, rain-slicked alleyway cluttered with overflowing bins. It was a perfect, miserable little box, a cell of anonymity, and she had never been so grateful to be in a place in her life. She dropped the tool roll onto the bed \u2013 the thud of it on the thin mattress the first solid, reassuring sound she had made since arriving \u2013 and locked the door. The lock was flimsy, but turning the key felt like a sacred rite, a definitive act of separation. She was sealed in. She was safe, for now.\n\nShe sank onto the edge of the bed, the springs groaning in protest. The overwhelming reality of her situation descended on her, no longer a frantic panic but a deep, crushing weight. She had run. She had left her home, her life, her mother. A wave of guilt, sharp and sickening, rose in her throat. She saw Maura\u2019s face, not angry, but stricken, her eyes wide with a pain Aoife had just inflicted. And Eamonn. His terror had been her anchor, but his accusation was now a brand on her. *What in God\u2019s name are you?* The question echoed in the silent, shabby room. She didn\u2019t know. She was a carpenter who could no longer trust the substance of her own hands. She was a daughter who had orphaned her mother. She was a secret that had become a monster. And she was utterly, terrifyingly alone in a room at the top of a strange house, in a city that didn't know she existed, with the impossible truth of herself a sickness in her bones."

                                        "text": "Sleep was a country she was afraid to enter without a passport. Her exhausted body craved it, the leaden pull of it in her limbs a desperate plea for oblivion. But oblivion was a state she had just narrowly escaped, and she could not be certain she would be able to find her way back from an unguarded, unconscious version of it. What if, in the depths of sleep, when the mind\u2019s desperate grip on reality loosened, she simply\u2026 unraveled? Would she wake up as a shimmering outline on the thin, stained mattress, a conscious thought with no body to inhabit? The terror of that possibility was a sharp, cold spike that drove all thoughts of rest away. She sat on the edge of the bed for a long time, listening to the unfamiliar sounds of the city outside and the groans of the old house around her, a sentry guarding the fragile borders of her own existence.\n\nEventually, the need for some tether to the person she used to be became overwhelming. She placed the heavy leather roll on the thin blanket and carefully untied the straps. The scent that arose from it was the first truly familiar thing she had encountered in hours \u2013 the ghosts of a hundred different woods, the sharp metallic tang of honed steel, and the rich, nutty smell of linseed oil. It was the scent of her sanity. One by one, she took the tools out, her calloused fingertips tracing the familiar shapes in the dim light. The Japanese saw with its tiger-stripe burn marks on the handle. The old mortise chisel with the mushroomed top from a thousand careful mallet blows. The rosewood handle of her favourite plane, worn smooth and dark with the sweat and oils of her own hand. They were not just objects; they were extensions of her will, the physical manifestation of her knowledge. They were real. She arranged them on the bed beside her, a silent, steely congregation, their solidity a fortress against the formless fear that lapped at her mind. Only then, with her hand resting on the cool, unyielding steel of a chisel handle, did she allow herself to lie back, curling into a tight, defensive ball, and fall into a shallow, haunted doze.\n\nShe woke with a jolt, her heart hammering against her ribs. For a disorienting second, she didn't know where she was. The light was wrong \u2013 a weak, watery grey filtering through a dirty window, illuminating a ceiling stained with the ghost of an old water leak. Then it came rushing back: the bus, the flight, the anonymous room. Her first conscious thought was a frantic, internal question: *Am I here?* She flung a hand to her face, pressing her palm hard against her cheek. The solid resistance of bone, the rough texture of her own skin, the warmth of her own blood. She was solid. She was whole. She let out a breath she hadn\u2019t realised she was holding, a ragged sob of pure, unadulterated relief. The terror of the night receded, leaving behind the grittier, more mundane fear of the day ahead. From the hallway came the sound of a door closing, heavy footsteps on the stairs, and the gurgle of ancient pipes as a toilet flushed. The house was alive with other people, other lives, and their ordinary morning routines were a bizarrely comforting proof that the world had not, in fact, ended during the night.\n\nThe brief comfort evaporated as the stark reality of her finances asserted itself. She sat up and took the crumpled wad of notes from her pocket, smoothing them out on the bedspread. After paying for the bus ticket and the room, she had just over two hundred euro left. It was nothing. A week's rent, maybe two, if she ate next to nothing. A cold knot of practical dread tightened in her stomach, a fear almost as visceral as the fading. She was a master carpenter, a creator of beautiful, functional things that people paid good money for, yet here she was, in a strange city, functionally destitute. The idea of walking into a joinery shop, her roll of tools over her shoulder, and asking for work was unthinkable. It meant questions. It meant names, addresses, a past. It meant engaging with a system she was desperately trying to escape. And what if the stress of a new job, of being watched and judged by a new boss, triggered an episode? The thought of dissolving into transparency in a workshop full of strangers, surrounded by spinning blades and heavy machinery, was a new and specific kind of horror.\n\nShe needed to work, but she could not be seen to be working. The contradiction sat in the middle of the room like an unsolvable riddle. She stood and walked to the window, peering down into the grimy alleyway. A cook from a nearby restaurant emerged for a smoke, his white uniform stained, his face weary. He didn't look up. He was in his own world, a small, self-contained bubble of routine. Anonymity, she realised, was a two-way street. Just as she was invisible to them, so too were the city\u2019s hidden corners and quiet desperations invisible to the main flow of traffic. There was work in a city this old. There were always broken things. A sticking drawer in a Georgian sideboard, a loose spindle on a staircase, a warped window frame in a house just like this one. Small jobs. Cash jobs. Jobs that wouldn't require a tax number or a curriculum vitae. Jobs that would let her slip in, fix the problem, and slip out again, a ghost who left behind only the quiet satisfaction of a perfectly repaired joint. It was a fragile, half-formed plan, but it was a plan. She had to become a different kind of craftswoman, not one who built new things from scratch, but one who mended the broken pieces of the old world, quietly, in the shadows."

                                        "text": "The fragile plan, forged in the pre-dawn desperation, demanded action. It was a terrifying prospect, but it was infinitely better than the passive, waiting dread that had colonised her since she\u2019d arrived. Action was a form of solidity. She dressed with purpose, pulling on the same clothes from the day before, their faint smell of fear and travel a grim reminder of how far she had fallen. She placed the roll of tools back in the scarred wardrobe, locking it with a key that was surely a century old, before locking her room behind her. Descending the creaking stairs and stepping out into the brisk Dublin morning felt like a deep-sea diver surfacing for air. The city was grey and business-like, its citizens striding along the pavements with a purpose that Aoife decided to mimic, burying her fear beneath a mask of focused intent. Her anonymity was her shield, and she clutched it tight as she navigated the unfamiliar streets in search of her first necessity: a new voice.\n\nShe found what she was looking for in a small, cluttered shop on a back street, its window crowded with second-hand phones and garish accessories. Inside, a young man with headphones barely looked up as she pointed to the cheapest pay-as-you-go phone on display. The transaction was swift and blessedly impersonal. He took her cash, handed her the small plastic box, and returned to his screen. She was just another faceless customer, her request unremarkable. Armed with her new, untraceable lifeline, she found a newsagent and bought a notepad and a pack of black pens. Back in the cold sanctuary of her room, she sat at the wobbly chair and began to compose her new identity. Her handwriting, usually the precise, angular script of a draftsperson, was deliberately simplified, rendered anonymous. She wrote out a dozen small, rectangular notices. *'Carpenter. Woodwork Repairs. Furniture, doors, windows. No job too small. Fast, reliable. Call Aoife.'* She hesitated for a long moment on the name. Using her own felt like a reckless risk, a breadcrumb leading back to her old life. But to use another name felt like a different kind of lie, a deeper level of self-erasure she wasn't ready for. She compromised, omitting a surname, leaving just the single, common Irish name. It was a calculated risk, a small bet on the vastness of the city's indifference.\n\nThe rest of the morning was spent in a strange, purposeful pilgrimage through the city\u2019s quieter residential neighbourhoods. She avoided the polished, affluent streets where people would simply buy new rather than repair old. Instead, she sought out the areas of faded grandeur, of student flats and old-age pensioners, where things were made to last because they had to. In a steamy laundrette, she pinned a notice to the corkboard crammed with ads for cleaning services and guitar lessons. In a small, family-run grocer\u2019s, she added her note to a constellation of babysitting offers and rooms to let. Each pin she pushed through the paper was an act of terrifying hope. She was casting messages in bottles into an urban sea, praying one would find a friendly shore. With each notice she posted, she felt a fresh spike of adrenaline, a feeling of being watched, even when the street was empty. She was making herself visible, however slightly, and it went against every instinct that was screaming at her to remain buried. By midday, her messages were scattered across a half-dozen different postcodes, a tiny, invisible web spun from fear and necessity.\n\nBack in her room, the waiting began. It was a suffocating, silent ordeal. The new phone sat on the rickety bedside table, a black, plastic rectangle of pure potential, both a promise and a threat. Every creak of the floorboards in the hallway, every distant siren, made her jump. The city\u2019s noise, which had been a comforting blanket of anonymity when she was in motion, was now a source of endless, nervous speculation. Was that a police car? Was that Eamonn\u2019s voice in the street below? She knew it was paranoia, but the fear was a physical presence in the room with her, cold and heavy. The hours crawled by. She paced the small space, her boots tracing a worn path in the thin carpet. She took her tools out again, not to work, but just to hold them, the familiar weight of a chisel or the smooth curve of a plane a temporary balm to her frayed nerves. She could feel the fragile edges of herself begin to shimmer with the stress and the inactivity, the terrible lightness returning to her limbs. She fought it back, focusing on the hard, real world, on the fifty euro note left in her pocket, on the grimy pattern of the wallpaper, on the silent, mocking stillness of the phone.\n\nIt rang at four o\u2019clock in the afternoon, its shrill, unfamiliar trill so sudden and violent it was like a physical blow. Aoife gasped, dropping the small block plane she had been holding onto the bed. It landed with a soft thud on the lumpy mattress. The phone buzzed and shrieked again, an insistent, alien summons. Her heart hammered against her ribs, a frantic, trapped bird. For a terrible second, she couldn't move, her hand hovering over the device, paralysed by the sheer, terrifying possibility of it. It could be anyone. It could be a wrong number. It could be Maura, having somehow, impossibly, tracked her down. It could be a trap. It rang a third time. Steeling herself, she snatched it up and pressed the green button, her thumb trembling. \"Hello?\" she said, her voice a dry, reedy croak she barely recognised.\n\n\"Hello? Is that the carpenter?\" The voice was female, elderly, with the distinctive, melodic cadence of old Dublin. It was hesitant, but kind. Relief washed over Aoife so intensely her knees felt weak.\n\"Yes,\" she managed, her voice a little stronger. \"Yes, this is she.\"\n\"Oh, grand. I saw your notice in the shop on Camden Street. I hope I'm not disturbing you. My name is O'Connell. Fionnuala O'Connell.\" The woman paused, as if expecting a response.\n\"Not at all,\" Aoife said quickly, sitting on the edge of the bed. \"How can I help you, Mrs. O'Connell?\"\n\"Well, it's my mother's old wardrobe. A lovely thing, mahogany, but the door has swollen in the damp, you see. It hasn't closed properly in years, and my son-in-law had a go at it and I think he's only made it worse.\" There was a weary sigh. \"I was wondering if it's the sort of thing you'd look at. It's a small job, I know.\"\n\"It's exactly the sort of thing I do,\" Aoife said, a flicker of her old professional confidence returning. The problem was familiar, a straightforward piece of joinery. It was a sentence in a language she understood. She took down the address, a street just a ten-minute walk away. As she ended the call, she sat in the silence, the phone still clutched in her hand. It was real. A stranger had seen her sign, had believed it, and had called. She was no longer just a fugitive. She was a carpenter again.\n\nThe walk to Mrs. O\u2019Connell\u2019s house was a journey through a different kind of fear. The paranoia of being hunted was replaced by the more immediate, practical anxiety of the unknown client. She clutched the strap of her tool roll, the weight on her shoulder both a burden and a comfort. The address was a tall, red-brick terraced house, its paintwork faded but its brass knocker polished to a warm gleam. It was a house that had been cared for. Taking a breath, she knocked. The door was opened by a small, stooped woman with flyaway white hair and eyes that were a startling, bright blue. She was exactly as her voice had sounded: frail, but with a spark of formidable intelligence. \"You must be Aoife,\" she said with a warm smile. \"You're younger than I expected. Come in, come in out of the cold.\" Aoife stepped over the threshold into a hallway filled with the scent of beeswax and old paper. The house was crowded with dark furniture, stacks of books, and framed photographs. It felt lived-in, a repository of a long and full life. It was so achingly normal, so deeply rooted in family and history, that it made Aoife\u2019s own rootlessness feel like a physical wound.\n\nMrs. O'Connell led her upstairs to a bedroom where the offending wardrobe stood, a large, handsome piece of Victorian mahogany. As the old woman had said, one of its doors stood stubbornly ajar by a good inch, refusing to meet the frame. Aoife ran a hand over the wood, her fingers instinctively seeking the source of the problem. She could feel the slight warp in the panel, see the scored marks near the hinges where the son-in-law had made his clumsy attempt at a fix. \"He meant well,\" Mrs. O'Connell said, as if reading her mind. \"But he's an accountant. His tools are spreadsheets.\" Aoife allowed herself a small, ghost of a smile. \"I'll need to take the door off,\" she said, her voice quiet and professional. \"It won't take long.\" The old woman nodded, her bright eyes watching with sharp curiosity. \"I'll put the kettle on,\" she said, before shuffling out and leaving Aoife alone with her work. In the quiet of the room, with the familiar weight of a screwdriver in her hand, the world contracted to the simple, honest reality of the task. The fear receded. The noise in her head went quiet. There was only her, the wood, and the problem.\n\nShe worked with a silent, focused grace. The heavy door came off the hinges with a practiced lift and was laid carefully on an old blanket she\u2019d asked for. Her diagnosis was swift. The frame had absorbed years of Dublin damp, swelling just enough to throw the whole geometry off. The son-in-law\u2019s mistake had been to try and force the hinges, scarring the wood in the process. Aoife chose her smallest, sharpest hand plane from the roll. The tool felt like an extension of her own hand. She set the blade to take the finest of shavings, gossamer-thin curls of dark, fragrant mahogany that fell to the blanket like dried petals. It was a process of listening to the wood, of feeling the resistance, of knowing exactly how much to take and where. She worked not by measurement, but by feel, her calloused fingertips her most sensitive guide. The rhythmic *shhhh-shhhh* of the plane was the only sound, a quiet, meditative prayer. In that moment, she wasn't a runaway or a phenomenon. She wasn't her mother's secret or Eamonn's terror. She was simply a craftswoman, coaxing a piece of obstinate history back into alignment. It was a feeling of competence and control so profound it was almost dizzying. This was her truth. This was her solid ground.\n\nAfter twenty minutes of careful shaving and testing, she was ready. She cleaned the shavings from the blanket, re-hung the heavy door on its hinges, and gave it a gentle push. It swung silently and clicked perfectly shut, its surface now flush with the frame. A deep, quiet satisfaction bloomed in Aoife\u2019s chest. It was a small victory, but it felt monumental. Mrs. O'Connell appeared in the doorway, a mug of tea in her hand, her eyes wide. \"Saints be praised,\" she breathed, walking forward to run a wrinkled hand over the closed door. \"I haven't seen it shut properly since my husband passed. How on earth did you do that?\" \"I just listened to what it needed,\" Aoife said simply. The woman looked from the wardrobe to Aoife's face, her gaze shrewd but kind. \"You have good hands,\" she said. \"Quiet hands.\" She insisted on paying Aoife sixty euro, more than Aoife would have dared to ask for. She pressed the notes into Aoife's palm, her dry, papery skin a brief, warm touch. \"Thank you, dear. It's more than just a door, you know.\" Aoife nodded, understanding completely. As she walked away from the house, the cash a warm, solid reality in her pocket, the setting sun casting long shadows down the street, she felt a flicker of something she hadn't felt in a long, long time. It wasn't happiness, not yet. But it was a foothold. It was proof that a ghost could still leave a mark on the world, even if it was just the quiet, satisfying click of a perfectly closed door."

                                        "text": "The sixty euro felt like a shield. Walking back through the darkening Dublin streets, Aoife kept her hand in her pocket, her fingers curled around the three warm, crisp notes. It was more than just money; it was proof. It was tangible evidence that her skills still had value, that she could still impose order on a chaotic world, even if her own existence felt like it was coming apart at the seams. The walk back to the guesthouse was different this time. She looked up, noticing the intricate patterns of the ironwork on a balcony, the deep carving on a stone lintel. Before, she had only seen threats and shadows; now, she was seeing the city\u2019s grain, the marks of other craftspeople who had come before her. The fear had not vanished, but it had retreated to the background, a low hum beneath the more immediate, satisfying thrum of competence. Back in her small, cold room, she did not immediately hide. She laid the money on the bedside table next to the phone, a small, proud offering to the god of survival. She felt the solid floor beneath her feet, the rough texture of the blanket on the bed, and for the first time since she had fled Belfast, she felt a flicker of hope that was more than just the absence of terror.\n\nThe phone rang twice the next day. The first call was from a student living in a sprawling flat in Rathmines, needing a kitchen cabinet door re-hung. The second was from a man with a soft County Clare accent who had a wobbly leg on an old pine table he\u2019d bought at a market. Both jobs were simple, straightforward applications of her knowledge, small acts of restoration that took less than an hour each. She moved through these brief encounters like a wraith, her voice quiet, her movements efficient. She learned to read her clients quickly, offering a brief, polite smile to the chatty student but maintaining a respectful, professional silence with the quiet man from Clare. They saw a quiet, capable young woman who was good with her hands and charged a fair price. They did not see the fugitive, the walking impossibility who checked her own hands for transparency every half-hour. With each successful job, each handful of cash pressed into her palm, the hum of fear grew quieter. She was building a routine, a fragile scaffolding of normalcy around the void at her core. She found a small bakery that sold day-old bread for next to nothing, and a fruit stand that had a box of bruised but edible apples. She ate in her room, listening to the city outside, hoarding her money, her world shrinking to the size of her small room and the brief, contained orbits of her jobs. For three days, this was her life. It was a spartan, lonely existence, but it was solid. She was earning her place in the world, one repaired joint at a time.\n\nThe call that changed things came on a grey, drizzly Friday afternoon. The voice on the phone was different from the others. It was a man, his voice a low growl, impatient and devoid of pleasantries. \u201cYou the carpenter? The one that fixes things?\u201d he asked, without preamble.\n\u201cYes,\u201d Aoife said, her hand tightening on the phone.\n\u201cGot a doorframe in my pub needs sorting. Got kicked in last week. The Garda\u00ed have been and gone, but the frame\u2019s a mess and it\u2019s letting a draft in that\u2019d cut you in two. Can you fix it or not?\u201d\nA pub. A public space, full of noise and people, of unpredictable variables. It was everything she had been trying to avoid. Her first instinct was to say no, to make an excuse. But the bluntness of his request was a challenge, and the thought of the money, more than she would make from a wobbly chair, was a powerful lure. The fear of destitution was, for the moment, stronger than the fear of discovery. \u201cI can fix it,\u201d she said, her voice firmer than she felt.\n\u201cRight. The Auld Triangle, just off Capel Street. Come now if you can. I\u2019m not paying you to look at it.\u201d The line went dead.\n\nThe Auld Triangle was a corner pub, its windows dark with decades of grime and nicotine. Pushing through the heavy door was like stepping into another era. The air was thick with the smell of stale beer, woodsmoke from a small, smouldering fire, and the sharp scent of whiskey. It was early afternoon, but a handful of old men were already installed at the bar, nursing pints of stout in a companionable silence, their conversation a low, sporadic murmur. The man who had called was behind the bar, a large, thick-set man with a florid face and suspicious eyes, wiping a glass with a dirty cloth. He gave her a long, hard look, his gaze taking in her slight frame and the heavy tool roll. \u201cYou\u2019re her?\u201d he grumbled, his expression a mask of doubt. Aoife just nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s over here,\u201d he said, gesturing with his head towards a door at the back that presumably led to a storeroom or cellar. The damage was exactly as he\u2019d described. The lock-side of the doorjamb was split, the wood splintered and pushed out of true where a heavy boot had connected with it. It was a nasty, violent wound in the old wood. More than that, it was a job that couldn\u2019t be done in twenty minutes. It would require careful cutting, gluing, and clamping. It would take time. It would mean being here, in this public space, for hours.\n\nShe set to work, trying to build a wall of concentration around herself. She knelt on the dusty floorboards, laying her tools out on the leather roll, the familiar shapes a small comfort. But the environment was an assault on her senses. The low drone of conversation from the bar, the sudden crash of a glass being washed, the sharp clang of the old-fashioned till. Every sound was an intrusion. She could feel the publican\u2019s eyes on her from behind the bar, his occasional glances a heavy weight on the back of her neck. The old men watched her too, their curiosity piqued by the novelty of a woman on her knees with a set of tools. She tried to block it out, to focus on the splintered wood in front of her. She used a sharp chisel to pare away the damaged fibres, her movements precise, but her hands felt clumsy, her focus splintered. A man at the bar laughed, a loud, braying sound that reminded her, with a sickening jolt, of a cousin of Eamonn\u2019s. The memory was a key in a lock. The familiar cold started in her stomach, a sickening, icy plunge. *Not here,* she pleaded silently. *Please, not now.*\n\nShe looked down at her left hand, the one bracing the doorframe. The wood grain of the floorboards was suddenly visible through her knuckles, a faint, watery superimposition. Her breath caught in her throat. The sounds of the pub began to warp, the low chatter slowing into a distorted, demonic drawl. The warmth from the small fire vanished, replaced by the profound, internal cold of the void. Panic, cold and absolute, seized her. She was dissolving, right here, on the floor of a Dublin pub, in full view of a handful of strangers. She fumbled for a clamp on her tool roll, her fingers feeling clumsy and disconnected, her grip uncertain. The heavy iron clamp slipped from her grasp, hitting the wooden floor with a loud, ringing clatter that seemed to echo in the suddenly distorted space. Every head at the bar turned towards the noise. The publican stared at her, his suspicious expression sharpening into something more like alarm. \"Everything alright over there?\" he called out, his voice sounding like it was coming from the end of a long tunnel. Aoife couldn\u2019t answer. She was staring at the space where her hand had been, a shimmering, translucent outline against the dark wood, her own skin and bone no more substantial than a heat haze."

                                        "text": "The terror was a physical thing, a glass bell descending over her, muting the world. The publican\u2019s question, \u201cEverything alright over there?\u201d, was a dull, droning sound from another room, a query directed at a person who was no longer entirely there. Aoife stared at her own hand, a phantom limb rendered in smoke and dust motes, the dark grain of the floorboards clearly visible through her palm and fingers. The cold was absolute, a black hole of sensation that had swallowed the warmth of the fire, the life of the room, leaving only a clinical, terrifying awareness. This was it. This was the moment of discovery. Her fragile, secret life was about to be shattered on the floor of a dingy pub, witnessed by a jury of strangers who would see not a woman in distress, but an aberration, a monster.\n\nHer mind, a screaming chaos a second before, went utterly blank. In its place, a single, primal instinct surfaced: *Pain is real.* Before she could think, before she could weigh the consequences, she acted. With a strangled gasp that was half-sob, half-war cry, she slammed her other hand \u2013 her solid, flesh-and-blood right hand \u2013 down onto the rough, uneven floorboards beside her. The impact was a nauseating crunch of bone and flesh on wood. A white-hot, electric shock of agony shot up her arm, so pure and absolute it eclipsed everything else. For a dizzying, heart-stopping second, there was only the pain. It was a searing, brilliant light in the cold darkness of the void, a single, undeniable point of reality. The world snapped back into focus with the force of a physical blow. The distorted drone of the pub resolved into sharp, distinct sounds: the gentle fizz of a pint being pulled, the murmur of a television in the corner, the sudden, concerned silence of the men at the bar. The phantom cold receded, chased back by the hot, throbbing bloom of agony in her palm. She was solid. She was excruciatingly, gratefully solid.\n\nPanting, her vision swimming with black spots from the sheer shock of the pain, she cradled her injured hand to her chest. A long, thin splinter of wood was embedded in the fleshy part of her palm, a dark line in the rapidly swelling and reddening skin. Tears of pain and relief streamed down her face. The publican, Declan, was there now, looming over her, his face a mixture of alarm and annoyance. \"Jesus, Mary and Joseph, girl, what was that all about?\" he demanded, his voice a low growl. One of the old men had half-risen from his stool, his pint held forgotten in his hand. Aoife shook her head, unable to form words, the lie catching in her throat. She just pointed a trembling finger at her other hand, the one that had been fading, and gave a weak, shuddering gasp. \"Felt... faint,\" she whispered, the words thin and reedy. \"Dizzy... I dropped the clamp.\" It was a pathetic, flimsy excuse, but her genuine distress, the tears, the visible pain of her self-inflicted wound, sold it better than any actor could. She looked pale, fragile, and utterly out of her depth.\n\nDeclan let out a long, exasperated sigh, the suspicion in his eyes softening slightly into a gruff, reluctant concern. \"For God's sake,\" he muttered, running a hand over his bald head. He looked from her ashen face to the splintered doorframe and back again. \"Right. That's it. You're not working like this. You'll take a chunk out of yourself with a chisel.\" He turned to the bar. \"Paddy, get her a glass of water. And put a bit of sugar in it,\" he barked at one of the old men, who shuffled to obey. Declan crouched down, his knees cracking, peering at her hand. \"That's a nasty one. You need to get that seen to.\" He looked at her, his expression unreadable. \"I thought you said you were a carpenter. You look like a strong wind would knock you over.\" The words were critical, but they lacked the venom of Eamonn\u2019s accusations. He was not afraid of her; he was just annoyed by her, by this complication, this feminine frailty disrupting the masculine order of his pub.\n\nThe humiliation was a fresh wave of sickness. He was right. She had failed. The pub, with its unpredictable rhythms and constant scrutiny, was a hostile environment, a minefield for her fragile state. She couldn't work here. The realisation was a cold, hard stone in her gut. The money was gone. The opportunity was lost. She had been tested, and she had broken. \"I'm sorry,\" she whispered, her voice thick with unshed tears of frustration. \"I... I get these dizzy spells sometimes. I thought I was fine today. I can't finish this. Not today.\" She began to gather her tools with her good hand, her movements clumsy and shaky, the simple act of rolling a chisel into its leather pocket a monumental effort. Each tool she touched was a reminder of her competence, a stark contrast to the trembling, pathetic figure she now presented.\n\nDeclan watched her for a moment, then straightened up with a grunt. He didn't argue. He just looked disappointed, as if his initial low expectations had been thoroughly met. \"Fine,\" he said, his voice flat. \"Just... go on. Get yourself home.\" He walked back behind the bar, leaving the glass of sugary water untouched on the floor beside her. He didn't offer her any money for her time. She hadn't expected him to. The failure was entirely her own. She forced herself to her feet, her legs unsteady, the heavy tool roll feeling like it was filled with lead. She didn't look at the old men at the bar, but she could feel their curious, pitying eyes on her as she pushed through the heavy door and escaped back into the grey, indifferent drizzle of the Dublin afternoon. The anonymity of the street was no longer a comfort. It was a confirmation of her own failure. She was a ghost in the machine, and the machine had just violently rejected her."

                                        "text": "The walk back was a litany of pain. The dull, relentless drizzle plastered her hair to her scalp and seeped into the collar of her jacket, a miserable counterpoint to the hot, sharp throb in her palm. The splinter was a deep, searing presence, a tiny sliver of the hostile world she had tried and failed to navigate, now physically embedded in her flesh. Every jostle of the tool roll on her shoulder sent a fresh, sickening wave of agony up her arm. But worse than the physical pain was the acid burn of humiliation. She had not just failed at a job; she had been exposed. Not her secret, not the impossible truth of her, but something almost as shameful: her weakness. She had been revealed as fragile, unreliable, a fainting woman who couldn't handle the pressures of a simple repair job. The publican\u2019s dismissal, his face a mask of irritated disappointment, was a judgment that felt more damning than any of Eamonn\u2019s angry accusations. Eamonn feared what she was; this man simply despised what she appeared to be.\n\nThe guesthouse room, which had briefly felt like a base of operations, was now just a cell. The air was stale and cold, offering no comfort. She locked the door and slid the chain across, a futile gesture of security against a threat that lived inside her own skin. She sat on the edge of the bed and forced herself to look at her hand. It was swollen and angry, the skin around the dark splinter unnaturally tight. It had to come out. Leaving it in was an invitation to infection, a problem her dwindling funds could not afford to solve with a doctor\u2019s visit. Her tools, symbols of her competence, were now her only recourse for this crude, intimate violation. She unrolled them with her good hand, the familiar scent of wood and steel a bitter mockery. She selected a fine-pointed marking knife, its steel tip honed to a surgical sharpness, and a pair of small, needle-nosed pliers she used for delicate inlay work. Her heart hammered a frantic, sick rhythm against her ribs. She was a carpenter, not a surgeon.\n\nTaking a deep, shuddering breath, she placed her injured hand flat on the wobbly bedside table, pinning it there with the weight of her forearm. The light from the single bulb was weak and yellow. With the tip of the knife, she carefully, painstakingly, widened the entry wound. The pain was exquisite, a clean, sharp fire that made her vision swim. She bit down hard on her lower lip, tasting the metallic tang of blood. Her target was a tiny, dark sliver of pub floorboard, a relic of her failure. With her fingers trembling from the pain and the adrenaline, she grasped the end of the splinter with the pliers. She pulled. The resistance was sickening, a tearing of flesh that sent another jolt of pure agony through her, but it came free. A single, bloody shard of wood, no more than an inch long. She stared at it for a moment, lying on the dark wood of the table, a trophy from a battle she had unequivocally lost. She stumbled to the small, stained sink in the corner of the room, running the cold, rusty-tasting water over the bleeding wound until it ran pink, then clear. The cold was a dull relief, but it couldn't touch the deeper, more profound ache of her defeat.\n\nSleep offered no escape, only a descent into feverish, fragmented nightmares. She was back in the pub, but the faces of the old men at the bar were Eamonn\u2019s, their expressions a mixture of terror and disgust. The publican was her grandfather, his face carved from stone, shaking his head in silent, eternal disappointment as she dissolved into a pile of wood shavings on the floor. She woke gasping, her hand throbbing in time with her frantic pulse, the thin blanket damp with sweat. The weak morning light revealed the bleak reality. Her hand was puffy and stiff, a constant, painful reminder of her vulnerability. Her plan had been a fool\u2019s errand. She couldn't expose herself to the random stresses of the world. She couldn't risk the scrutiny of strangers. The handful of small successes had been a fluke, a brief respite before the inevitable collapse. The city, which had briefly seemed to offer a fragile kind of hope, now felt like a vast, indifferent trap. The money on the table was a dwindling resource, and her ability to replenish it had just been proven to be a catastrophic failure. Despair, a feeling she had been holding at bay with sheer momentum, began to seep into the room, cold and heavy as a winter fog.\n\nShe was staring at the wall, her mind a blank slate of misery, when a heavy, purposeful knock came at the door. It wasn't the landlady's timid tap. It was solid, insistent, and it sent a jolt of pure, primal terror through her. Her first thought was Eamonn. He\u2019d found her. He\u2019d tracked her down. The door was locked, the chain was on, but it felt as flimsy as paper. Her heart seized. She scrambled off the bed, backing away from the door until her back was pressed against the cold glass of the window. Her breath was trapped in her chest, a painful, immovable weight. The knock came again, louder this time. \"Aoife? Are you in there? It's Declan. From the pub.\" The name was so unexpected it short-circuited her panic. Declan. The publican. What in God's name was he doing here? Had he followed her? Was he here to accuse her of being a fraud, to demand his money back for a job she hadn't even been paid for? \"Open the door,\" he called out, his voice muffled but firm. \"I'm not going to stand in the hall all day.\"\n\nHer mind raced. She could stay silent, pretend she wasn't there. But he knew she was. He had a stubborn, immovable quality about him. Ignoring him would only make things worse. With a trembling hand, she slid the chain back and turned the key. She opened the door only a few inches, peering through the gap. He stood in the dingy hallway, a large, intimidating presence in his tweed overcoat, his face looking even more florid in the weak light. He held a small, grease-stained paper bag in one hand. He looked past her, into the small, miserable room, his gaze taking in the unmade bed and the roll of tools on the floor. His eyes finally settled on her, his expression unreadable. \"Your landlady's a right old dragon,\" he grumbled. \"Took a tenner just to let me up the stairs.\" He shoved the paper bag towards her. \"Here.\"\n\nAoife looked at the bag, then back at his face, her confusion total. She didn't take it. \"What is it?\" \"It's a ham and cheese roll and a bottle of Lucozade,\" he said, with the air of a man stating something incredibly obvious and foolish. \"You look like you haven't eaten in a week.\" He pushed it into her uninjured hand. \"I came to see if your hand had fallen off.\" He peered at her bandaged palm, which she had wrapped in a strip of cloth torn from a t-shirt. \"Doesn't look good.\" He met her eyes, and for the first time, she saw something other than annoyance or suspicion in his face. It was a flicker of grudging respect. \"You made a right mess of yourself,\" he said, \"but I saw what you were doing before you went all peculiar on me. You were paring it back clean. You know what you're about.\"\n\nHe paused, letting the silence hang in the air. \"The door's still knackered. The draft is still there. And I don't want some other cowboy making a bigger mess of it.\" He looked at her, a challenge in his eyes. \"The pub's closed tomorrow morning until noon for a delivery. No customers, no noise. Just me and the barrels. You come at nine. You finish the job. I'll pay you a hundred euro. Cash. Take it or leave it.\" The offer was a lifeline thrown into the dark, churning water of her despair. It was everything she needed: a controlled environment, no audience, and a substantial amount of money. But it meant facing him again, returning to the scene of her humiliation. It meant trusting him. She looked at his hard, impassive face, at the unexpected, clumsy offering of the sandwich in her hand, and saw not a threat, but a pragmatist. He didn't care about her dizzy spells or her strange fragility. He just wanted his door fixed, and he believed she was the one to do it. \"I'll be there,\" she said, her voice quiet but steady. He gave a single, curt nod. \"Nine o'clock. Don't be late.\" He turned and walked away down the hall without another word, his heavy footsteps echoing on the bare floorboards, leaving Aoife standing in the doorway, clutching a warm sandwich and a fragile, complicated sliver of hope."

                                        "text": "After Declan\u2019s heavy footsteps had faded down the hall, Aoife remained in the doorway, the grease-stained paper bag a strange, warm weight in her hand. The scent of it \u2013 baked bread, salty ham, sharp cheese \u2013 was an almost violent assault on her senses, a reminder of a world of simple, physical comforts she had been starving for. She closed the door, her movements slow and deliberate, and slid the lock home. Back in the centre of the room, she sank onto the chair and unwrapped the sandwich as if it were a holy relic. She ate it slowly, mechanically at first, then with a growing, ravenous hunger. Each bite was a revelation, a solid, grounding act that pushed back against the formless dread. The salty fat of the ham, the yielding softness of the bread, the sugary, chemical tang of the Lucozade; it was fuel, it was substance, it was a clumsy, gruff act of grace, and it felt more real than anything she had experienced in days.\n\nWith the food in her stomach, a small, warm ballast against the cold tide of her fear, she tended to her hand. The makeshift bandage was stiff with dried blood. She unwrapped it carefully, her breath hissing between her teeth as the cloth pulled at the tender skin. The wound was an angry red mouth in the centre of her palm, but it was clean. The crude surgery had been a success. She found a small, almost-empty bottle of antiseptic in her jacket pocket, a relic from some long-forgotten scrape in the workshop, and cleaned the wound with a stoic, detached precision. The sting was a familiar fire, a pain she understood. She re-bandaged it with the last of a roll of gauze from her small first-aid kit, her movements practiced and neat. Her hand throbbed with a steady, rhythmic pain, a metronome counting out the beats of her continued existence. That night, she slept. It was not a deep or restful sleep, but it was a solid, unbroken stretch of unconsciousness, free from the terror of dissolution.\n\nThe morning was the colour of slate, the sky a uniform grey that promised more rain but for now held back. Aoife was awake before the city, her internal clock set to the early hours of a working day. The pain in her hand had subsided to a dull, persistent ache, a constant reminder of yesterday's failure and today's fragile chance at redemption. She dressed with a sense of quiet purpose, her fear still present but now contained, packed down beneath a layer of professional resolve. She checked her tool roll, ensuring everything was in its place. The tools were not just implements; they were her credentials, her argument for her own usefulness. As she walked through the waking streets, the world felt different. The anonymity she had clung to was still there, but it was no longer a suffocating blanket. It was just the natural state of a city, a vast, complex machine of which she was now, however temporarily, a functioning part.\n\nThe Auld Triangle was a dark, silent shape on the corner, its windows blank, the familiar sounds of life within it entirely absent. Aoife hesitated on the pavement for only a second before knocking on the heavy door, her knuckles rapping a firm, decisive rhythm. After a moment, a series of heavy bolts were drawn back, and the door opened a crack. Declan peered out, his face impassive. \"You're early,\" he grunted, but it was a statement of fact, not an accusation. He swung the door open and stepped back, letting her into the gloom. The pub was a strange, liminal space in the morning light. The air was still and thick, smelling of old smoke and spilled beer, but without the bodies and the noise, it felt like a chapel between services. The chairs were stacked on the tables, the floor was swept, and a profound silence hung over everything. It was perfect.\n\n\"Coffee's on the bar if you want it. Black,\" Declan said, already moving towards the back. \"Don't touch the whiskey.\" Aoife poured herself a mug of the thick, bitter coffee, its warmth a welcome shock to her system. She carried it over to the wounded doorframe and took a long sip, surveying the job with a clear head. The problem was straightforward, a matter of cutting away the damaged wood and splicing in a new, solid piece. The challenge was not the work itself, but doing it under the weight of her own fragility. She laid out her tool roll on the floor, the familiar gesture a silent prayer. Declan was true to his word. He was busy with a delivery, rolling heavy kegs of stout from the street into the cellar with a series of controlled thuds and grunts, his presence a constant but unobtrusive background noise. They worked in a strange, parallel silence, two people focused entirely on their own demanding, physical tasks.\n\nAoife began her work. She used a fine-toothed Japanese saw to make two clean, precise cuts, isolating the splintered section of the jamb. The whisper of the blade through the old, dry wood was a deeply satisfying sound. The pain in her hand was a low, steady throb, but she found she could use it. It was an anchor, a constant, physical sensation she could focus on if her mind started to drift, if the edges of the world began to feel too thin. Once, as she was carefully chiselling out the waste wood, a heavy keg slipped from Declan's grasp in the cellar below, crashing to the stone floor with a deafening boom. The sudden, violent noise was a shockwave, and for a heart-stopping second, she felt the familiar, terrifying lightness, the cold tingle of dissolution. She froze, her chisel poised, her breath trapped in her chest. But this time was different. She was not on display. She was not under scrutiny. She closed her eyes, focused on the sharp ache in her palm, and on the solid, reassuring weight of the chisel handle. *Solid,* she thought, the word a command. *The wood is real. The tool is real.* After a moment, the feeling passed, leaving her shaken but intact.\n\nShe measured and cut a new piece of hardwood she'd brought with her, a small offcut of oak she kept for just such repairs. She planed it down by fractions of a millimetre until the fit was perfect, the new wood slotting into the old frame with satisfying precision. She mixed a small amount of strong wood glue, applied it carefully, and clamped the new piece firmly in place. While the glue set, she sat on the floor, sipping the last of her now-cold coffee. Declan emerged from the cellar, wiping his hands on a rag. He came over and looked down at her work, at the neat, clamped repair. He didn't say anything for a long moment. Then he disappeared behind the bar and returned with a steaming mug of tea, which he placed on the floor beside her. He didn't speak a word, just gave a curt nod and went back to stocking his shelves. The simple, unspoken gesture of care was so profound it almost brought tears to her eyes.\n\nAn hour later, the glue was set. Aoife carefully removed the clamps and used her finest plane to shave the new piece down until it was perfectly flush with the old wood. She sanded it smooth, the rhythmic scrape of the paper a final, finishing touch. She stepped back and inspected her work. The repair was almost invisible, a clean, strong scar where the violent wound had been. The grain of the new oak sat beautifully against the dark, aged pine of the original frame. It was good work. It was honest work. She swung the storeroom door on its hinges. It closed with a solid, satisfying click, the seal perfect. The draft was gone. Declan came over, pint glass in one hand, rag in the other. He closed the door and opened it a few times, then ran a thick finger over the seamless repair. \"Solid,\" he grunted, the single word a high commendation. He reached into his pocket and pulled out a roll of notes, counting out five crisp twenties onto the bar. \"Good work,\" he said, pushing them towards her. He hesitated, then looked at her, his expression serious. \"I know a fella. Owns a few rental properties over in Portobello. Old houses, always falling apart. I'll give him your number.\" He held her gaze. \"Can you handle it?\" The question was direct, a test. He wasn't asking if she was a good carpenter. He already knew the answer to that. He was asking if she was reliable, if the strange, fainting girl from the other day was gone. \"Yes,\" Aoife said, her voice clear and steady. \"I can handle it.\" He nodded, satisfied. \"Right then,\" he said, turning back to his bar. \"Off with you. I've a pub to open.\" She scooped up the money, her heart light, her hand still aching but now a badge of honour, not shame. As she stepped out into the bright, clear afternoon, the hundred euro a solid, warm rectangle in her pocket, she felt a shift in the foundations of her world. She was no longer just running away. She was starting to build something new."

                                        "text": "The hundred euro sat on the bedside table, a small, paper monument to a battle won. For two days, Aoife did not touch it. She lived off the dregs of the ham and cheese roll and the bruised apples, hoarding the money as if it were the last of its kind in the world. It was more than currency; it was a fragile proof of concept, evidence that a life could be salvaged from the wreckage of the old one. She spent the time in a state of quiet, anxious readiness, her new phone always within arm\u2019s reach, her bandaged hand a dull, aching reminder of the stakes. The waiting was a different kind of torment from the one that had preceded it. It was no longer the passive dread of being discovered, but the active, nerve-shredding anxiety of hoping to be found, but only by the right person, for the right reason. Each time a door slammed in the guesthouse or a siren wailed in the distance, her stomach would clench, but her mind would not immediately leap to Eamonn. Instead, it whispered, *Is that him? Is that the call?*\n\nIt came on the third day, a Tuesday. The phone buzzed on the table, a low, aggressive sound that cut through the afternoon quiet. Aoife snatched it up, her heart a frantic drum against her ribs. The number was unrecognised. \"Hello?\" she said, her voice steadier than she expected. The man on the other end did not waste time with pleasantries. \"Is this Aoife? Declan from The Auld Triangle gave me your number. Name's Duffy. Michael Duffy.\" His voice was brisk and businesslike, with a flat Midlands accent that was all sharp angles, devoid of Declan's gruff Dublin melody. \"Declan says you're good with old houses. I have a flat in Portobello, top floor. Sash windows are painted shut, half the cords are gone. It's empty. Key is in the lockbox by the door, code is 1988. I'll text you the address. Look at the job and text me a price. If I like it, I'll transfer a deposit and you can start. Alright?\"\n\nIt was a dizzying rush of information, a purely transactional communication that was both terrifying and liberating. There were no questions about who she was or where she came from. Her only credential was Declan\u2019s word. She was not a person to him; she was a function, a solution to a problem. For a woman trying to become a ghost, it was the perfect arrangement. \"Alright,\" she managed to say, her mind already turning over the mechanics of the job. He texted the address seconds after the call ended. She found a pen and wrote it down on the back of a receipt, the unfamiliar street name a coordinate in her new, unmapped life. The job was a classic, the kind of finicky, patient work she excelled at. It was work that required solitude and concentration, a quiet communion between a craftswoman and a broken thing. It was a lifeline.\n\nThe house in Portobello was a tall, handsome Georgian building, its elegant brick fa\u00e7ade now looking tired and neglected, a dowager fallen on hard times. It had been carved up into flats, its grand proportions subdivided into a warren of smaller lives. Just as Duffy had said, the key was in the lockbox. Letting herself into the silent, empty flat felt like a trespass, but the scent of old plaster, dust, and damp was a familiar perfume. The main room was large and airy, with high ceilings and beautiful, intricate cornicing, but the two tall sash windows were sealed shut with generations of thick, careless paint, trapping the stale air and weak light. It was a room holding its breath. Aoife ran her fingers over the built-up layers of gloss, feeling the history of neglect. She understood this place. It was a beautiful thing that had been mistreated, imprisoned by other people\u2019s carelessness. The work would not just be a repair; it would be a liberation.\n\nFor the next two days, the flat became her world. She worked with a silent, methodical passion she had not felt in years. The empty rooms were her sanctuary, the quiet streets outside a distant, irrelevant hum. The process was painstaking. She used a sharp utility knife and a painter\u2019s tool to carefully score and break the thick seal of paint, working slowly to avoid damaging the delicate mouldings of the window frame. The first time a sash finally gave way with a groan and a crackle of ancient paint, sliding upwards to let a rush of fresh, cool air into the stuffy room, it felt like a miracle. She replaced the rotten, frayed sash cords, threading the new rope through the hidden pulleys and carefully re-calibrating the heavy iron counterweights until the window glided up and down with the smooth, silent ease of its original design. It was a delicate, intricate dance of physics and feel. In the deep focus of the work, the world outside her immediate task ceased to exist. Her fears, her past, the strange, fragile nature of her own body \u2013 it all receded, silenced by the whisper of a plane on wood and the satisfying click of a well-balanced window.\n\nDuffy, true to his word, had transferred a deposit as soon as she\u2019d texted him a quote. When she sent him a picture of the two fully restored, gleaming windows, the balance arrived in her newly opened bank account within minutes. The account itself had been a terrifying hurdle, requiring a minimal proof of address she\u2019d coaxed out of her reluctant landlady. But now, with a legitimate bank balance, she was no longer just a transient with a wad of cash. She was a sole trader. She had an income. A day later, Duffy texted again. A set of floorboards in a ground-floor flat in Ranelagh. Then a warped kitchen door in a house near the canal. The work was steady, a constant stream of small, manageable problems she could solve. She became a quiet, efficient presence in the empty, neglected spaces of Duffy\u2019s property portfolio, a ghost who left behind only the subtle signs of her passing: a floor that no longer creaked, a window that opened to the sun, a door that closed without a fight.\n\nThe guesthouse, with its smell of cabbage and its single, grimy window, began to feel less like a hideout and more like a cage. It was a place for a fugitive, and she was, slowly, becoming something else. With a few hundred euro saved in the bank, she began to scan the \u2018To Let\u2019 notices in shop windows, her heart beating a little faster with the audacity of the idea. She found it on a quiet, tree-lined street in Harold\u2019s Cross: a top-floor bedsit in a tall Victorian house. It was just one room with a small, curtained-off kitchenette and a bathroom tiny enough to be a cupboard, but its single large window looked out over a sea of neighbouring gardens and rooftops. It was private. It was quiet. It was safe. The landlord was a weary-looking man who seemed to have long since given up on checking references, and her cash deposit was all the persuasion he needed.\n\nOn a bright, windswept Saturday, she moved. It was a simple affair. She packed her few clothes into a carrier bag, gathered the small collection of tins and dry goods she had accumulated, and rolled up her tools. Walking out of the guesthouse for the last time, she did not look back. The feeling of turning the key in the lock of her own front door was a physical shock, a jolt of ownership and belonging so profound it made her feel light-headed. The room was bare, echoing, and smelled faintly of lavender polish and old books. It was a blank slate. That first evening, with no furniture but a mattress she\u2019d bought for cash from a second-hand shop, she did not unroll her tools on the floor. She found a sturdy wooden crate left behind by a previous tenant, stood it in the corner by the window, and laid her tools out on it. It was her first workbench. In the fading light, she picked up her favourite chisel and a sharpening stone. The rhythmic, scraping sound of steel on stone filled the small, quiet room. It was not the sound of a woman hiding. It was the sound of a woman at home."

                                        "text": "The rhythm of the days settled into a quiet, predictable cadence. Autumn bled into the Dublin streets, turning the leaves in the canal-side parks to rust and gold. Aoife\u2019s life became a map of bus routes and side streets, a series of empty flats where she would arrive like a phantom and leave behind the subtle evidence of her craft. The work for Michael Duffy was plentiful and blessedly impersonal. He would text an address, a code, and a problem \u2013 a sticking door, a cracked window frame, a section of skirting board chewed by a previous tenant's dog. She would text back a price, and the money would appear in her bank account, a silent, digital transaction that required no human contact. She was a joinery surgeon, making her rounds in the quiet, empty wards of Duffy\u2019s property empire, performing small, neat operations on the city\u2019s wounded architecture.\n\nHer bedsit became a true sanctuary. The large, west-facing window was its soul, and she would sit by it in the evenings as the sun went down, watching the sky bleed from blue to orange to a deep, bruised purple over the endless patchwork of rooftops. The room slowly filled with the markers of a life being lived. A second-hand book on Irish furniture bought from a charity shop. A small, healthy-looking fern on the windowsill. A proper kettle that didn't threaten to electrocute her. The greatest change was the workbench she built for herself. Using money from three of Duffy\u2019s jobs, she bought several lengths of solid, reclaimed beechwood. Over the course of a weekend, she transformed them into a small, sturdy workbench that fit perfectly under the window. It was the first beautiful thing she had made for herself in years, its joints perfect, its surface planed to a satin smoothness. Every evening, she would sit at it, the scent of the wood a familiar comfort, and sharpen her tools. The rhythmic scrape of steel on stone was a form of meditation, a mantra that kept the ghosts at bay. It was a lonely life, but it was hers. For the first time since she had fled Belfast, she felt the fragile, unfamiliar sensation of peace.\n\nThe call that broke the rhythm came on a bright, cold Thursday morning. It wasn't Duffy\u2019s brisk, impersonal tone. The voice was hesitant, female, and elderly. \u201cHello, is this Aoife, the carpenter? I am so sorry to bother you. I found your little card in a newsagent in Terenure, it must have been there for months. I do hope you\u2019re still\u2026 available?\u201d Aoife\u2019s heart gave a nervous flutter. She had almost forgotten about the notices she\u2019d pinned up in her first, desperate days. \u201cYes,\u201d she said, her voice cautious. \u201cI\u2019m still available.\u201d The woman, who introduced herself as Eleanor Vance, began to describe the job. It wasn\u2019t a repair, not in the way Duffy\u2019s jobs were. It was a restoration. She had a lady\u2019s writing desk, her own grandmother\u2019s, that had been badly damaged by a leak years ago. The veneer was peeling and the marquetry on the drawer-fronts was lifting. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful piece,\u201d Eleanor said, her voice full of a sad affection. \u201cBut it\u2019s sick. It needs a doctor, not a handyman. Someone told me to take it to a big restorer in town, but they talked about dipping it and stripping it\u2026 it sounded so brutal. I want someone who will be kind to it.\u201d\n\nThe words \u2018be kind to it\u2019 resonated deep in Aoife\u2019s soul. It was the language of a true custodian, not just an owner. Against her better judgment, against the instinct that screamed at her to stick to the safe, anonymous work for Duffy, she agreed to go and look at it. Eleanor Vance lived in a tall, red-brick house in Sandymount, not far from the sea. The air tasted of salt. The woman who answered the door was tall and elegant, with a cascade of silver hair pinned up loosely and intelligent, perceptive eyes that seemed to miss nothing. The house was filled with books, paintings, and the quiet, scholarly clutter of a life spent in pursuit of knowledge. It was a world away from Declan\u2019s pub or her own spartan bedsit. Eleanor led her into a bright, book-lined study where the writing desk stood by the window. It was an exquisite piece of late-Victorian craftsmanship, delicate and refined, made from a rich, dark walnut. And it was, as Eleanor had described, deeply sick. The water damage had caused the fine walnut veneer to bubble and lift along one side, and the intricate inlay of flowers and vines on the drawers was a mess of loose, discoloured pieces.\n\nAoife approached it with a reverence she hadn\u2019t felt in months. She ran her fingertips, the calloused pads surprisingly sensitive, over the damaged surface. This wasn\u2019t a job for glue and clamps alone; this was a puzzle. It would mean carefully lifting the damaged veneer, cleaning the old hide glue from the substrate, and patiently, painstakingly, re-laying each tiny piece of the marquetry. It was the work she had been trained to do, the work she loved, the art that existed at the intersection of history, chemistry, and skill. \u201cIt\u2019s walnut,\u201d she said, her voice soft. \u201cAnd the inlay looks like satinwood and maybe a little rosewood.\u201d Eleanor\u2019s face lit up. \u201cYes! That\u2019s it. My husband always said you were a woman who spoke wood.\u201d The casual, approving observation, the assumption of her expertise, was both a balm and a terror. Eleanor saw her. Not a problem-solver, but an artist.\n\nAs she knelt to examine the joinery of the legs, her gaze fell on the pattern of the inlay again. A small, five-petalled flower, rendered in pale satinwood. A jolt, sharp and visceral as an electric shock, went through her. Her grandfather had owned a small tea caddy with the exact same floral motif. She could see it now, sitting on the mantelpiece in his Belfast workshop, his large, gentle hand resting beside it as he explained the art of knife-cutting veneer. She could smell the pipe smoke and the oiled steel of his tools, feel the comforting rumble of his voice. The memory was so powerful, so intensely real, that it ripped a hole in the fragile fabric of her new life. The familiar, dreaded cold bloomed in her chest, a spreading ice that leached the warmth from the sunlit room. The colours of the books on the shelves began to desaturate, the edges of the room shimmering as if seen through water.\n\nEleanor was saying something about the desk\u2019s history, her voice a pleasant, melodic drone that seemed to be coming from a great distance. Aoife gripped the sharp, splintered edge of the damaged veneer on the desk, digging the tiny wooden shards into her fingertips. Pain. It was an anchor. She focused on the small, sharp points of physical sensation, a desperate mantra against the terrifying slide into nothingness. *The wood is real. The pain is real. You are here.* She forced herself to look up, to meet Eleanor\u2019s curious, intelligent gaze. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s a difficult job,\u201d Aoife heard herself say, her voice sounding thin and strained. \u201cThe marquetry will have to be completely lifted and re-laid. It will take time.\u201d She was fighting a battle on two fronts, one against the encroaching void, the other to maintain a fa\u00e7ade of professional composure. The terror and the longing, the grief for her grandfather and the fear of what she was becoming, were a screaming vortex inside her, but on the outside, she was a quiet carpenter, calmly assessing a piece of damaged furniture. The duality was a chasm threatening to swallow her whole. She had to get out. \u201cI can do it,\u201d she said, standing up too quickly, a wave of dizziness washing over her. \u201cI\u2019ll need to work on it here. I\u2019ll text you a price.\u201d Before Eleanor could respond, before her perceptive eyes could register the sheer panic behind Aoife\u2019s mask, Aoife had turned and fled, leaving the beautiful, broken desk and its kind, intelligent owner behind in the silent, sun-filled room."

                                        "text": "She didn't remember the bus ride back from Sandymount. It was a blank space in her memory, a frantic, grey blur bracketed by the salt air of the coast and the familiar, grimy brick of the streets near her bedsit. She came back to herself standing outside her own front door, her key fumbling against the lock, her breath coming in ragged, painful gasps. Her fingertips throbbed, tiny, sharp points of agony where she had dug them into the splintered veneer of the desk. The pain was a dull, red light in the fog of her panic, the one thing that proved she had made it back in one piece. The sunlit, scholarly peace of Eleanor\u2019s study felt like a dream of a foreign country, a place whose language she did not speak and whose customs she had just violently, unforgivably, transgressed. She had fled not just a room, but a possibility, a glimpse of a life she thought she might be able to build, and the shame of her retreat was a cold, heavy stone in her gut.\n\nOnce inside, with the door locked and bolted, the fragile peace of her sanctuary felt shattered. The room was the same, the light falling in the same way across her small, perfect workbench, but she saw it all through a scrim of failure. She had run. Again. Just as she had run from Belfast, she had run from a beautiful, broken piece of wood because it reminded her of a truth she could no longer bear. She paced the small floor, a caged animal, the four walls that had been her fortress now feeling like the boundaries of her confinement. She had built a small, safe world for herself, a world of impersonal repairs and empty flats, and the moment she had stepped outside of it, the moment she had been offered a piece of work that required not just her skill but her soul, she had crumbled. The void had found her not in the stress of a hostile environment, but in the heart of a beautiful one, triggered by a memory of love. That was the most terrifying discovery of all. The curse wasn't just a reaction to fear and scrutiny; it was a reaction to her own history. It fed on her past.\n\nShe collapsed onto the edge of her mattress, staring at the phone in her hand. The screen was blank, a dark mirror reflecting her own pale, strained face. The choice before her was stark and absolute. She could delete Eleanor Vance\u2019s number, erase the whole encounter from her memory, and retreat back into the safe, grey world of Michael Duffy\u2019s rotting window frames. She could survive that way. She could continue her half-life as a ghost who mended things, forever circling the edges of the world, never truly engaging with it. Or she could do the job. She could walk back into that sunlit room, back to the desk that had almost unmade her, and face it. The thought sent a tremor of pure, visceral terror through her. It felt like volunteering to walk into a fire, knowing it would burn her. But the alternative, the life of perpetual retreat, suddenly felt like a different kind of death, a slow, quiet fading into utter meaninglessness.\n\nThe memory of her grandfather, which had been the trigger, was now the heart of the problem. She allowed it to come, not fighting it this time, but letting it wash over her in the quiet of her room. She saw his workshop, a place of organised chaos and deep, abiding peace. She saw his hands, large and surprisingly gentle, guiding her own small hand as she held a chisel for the first time. He had never spoken of lies. To him, the world was a thing of substance and integrity. Wood was honest. A joint was either true or it was not. He had taught her that the soul of a thing was in its making, in the care and skill that went into it. He had bequeathed to her a world of tangible truths, a faith she could hold in her hands. The writing desk, with its familiar inlay, was a relic of that world. It was a direct, physical link to the one person in her life who had represented an uncomplicated reality. The sight of it had been a collision, a violent meeting of the true world he had given her and the false one she was forced to inhabit, and the impact had almost torn her apart.\n\nA cold, hard anger began to replace the fear. It was a slow-burning ember in the ashes of her panic. She was tired of running. She was tired of being a victim of this strange, internal haunting. What was the point of having this skill, this art that her grandfather had so lovingly passed down to her, if she was too afraid to use it? What was the point of surviving if she had to amputate the parts of herself that made life worth living? To refuse this job would be to dishonour his memory, to concede that his world of truth and substance had no place in hers. It would be an admission that she was, in fact, nothing more than a flaw, a lie made flesh, and that she deserved to live in the shadows. The desk was sick, Eleanor had said. It needed a doctor. But Aoife knew, with a sudden, chilling certainty, that she was the one who was truly sick, and this desk, this beautiful, broken thing, might just be the only medicine that could work.\n\nWith a hand that was surprisingly steady, she picked up the phone. Her thumb hovered over the screen, a silent, momentous pause before the irreversible act. She thought of Eleanor\u2019s kind, intelligent eyes, of her gentle request to \u2018be kind to it\u2019. It was a plea for compassion that Aoife now realised she desperately needed to extend to herself. She opened a new text message. Her fingers, still tender from the splinters, moved over the keypad, composing a message that was simple, professional, and an act of sheer, terrifying defiance. \u2018Mrs Vance, the price for the restoration of the desk will be four hundred euro. That includes all materials. I can begin on Monday if that is suitable. Aoife.\u2019 She read it over once, her heart hammering against her ribs, then, before she could lose her nerve, she pressed send. The small word \u2018Delivered\u2019 appeared beneath the message, a confirmation that her challenge had been issued.\n\nShe set the phone down, her whole body trembling with the aftershock of her own courage. The fear was still there, a cold knot in her stomach, but it was no longer in charge. For the first time, she had willingly chosen to walk towards the thing that threatened her. She had chosen her craft over her curse. She stood up and walked to her workbench. The last of the evening light was slanting through the window, illuminating the fine layer of sawdust on its surface. She ran her hand over the smooth, solid beechwood, her anchor in a world that threatened to dissolve. From a small, carefully wrapped cloth in her main tool roll, she took out a set of delicate, surgeon-like scalpels and fine-tipped probes she used for inlay and veneer work. They were tools she had not had cause to use since leaving Belfast. She laid them out in a neat, gleaming row. She found her small, copper glue pot and the packet of amber-coloured hide glue pellets. She was arming herself, preparing her defenses. She did not know if she could win this fight, if she could face the desk without breaking apart. But as she stood there in the fading light, surrounded by the tools of her trade, she knew, with a certainty that was as solid as the wood beneath her hand, that she was done running."

                                        "text": "The two days that followed were a long, drawn-out breath held in anticipation. Aoife did not leave the bedsit. She prepared. The work was an antidote to the anxiety, a way to channel the nervous energy that thrummed just beneath her skin. She took out her grandfather\u2019s old oilstones, the fine-grained slate worn into a shallow concavity from decades of use. One by one, she honed the edges of her inlay scalpels and chisels, her movements slow and deliberate, her focus absolute. The whisper of steel on stone was a conversation with her past, a dialogue she was trying to learn to have without flinching. She was not just sharpening tools; she was sharpening her own resolve, honing her courage to a razor\u2019s edge. The phone remained silent on the workbench, a small black monolith containing either her salvation or her retreat. She refused to look at it, to will it to ring. The choice was made. The arrow was loosed. All she could do now was wait for it to land.\n\nThe reply came on Sunday evening, a simple, unassuming notification that made her heart leap into her throat. The message was from Eleanor. \u2018Monday is perfect, Aoife. I\u2019m so glad. The desk is looking forward to it. See you around ten? Eleanor.\u2019 The gentle, whimsical personification of the desk, the complete absence of any question about her previous flight, was an act of quiet, radical grace. Eleanor was not just accepting her price; she was welcoming her back, offering a clean slate. The generosity of it was both a profound relief and an immense burden. She was being trusted, not just as a carpenter, but as a person, and she was terrified she would not be equal to the faith being placed in her.\n\nMonday morning was cold and bright. The walk to Sandymount was a conscious pilgrimage. She didn't take the bus. She walked, her tool roll a familiar, reassuring weight on her shoulder, the rhythm of her footsteps on the pavement a steadying drumbeat. Each step was a deliberate choice to move forward, to not turn back. When she stood before the tall, red-brick house, she felt a tremor of the same panic that had sent her fleeing days before. It was a cold finger tracing its way up her spine. She took a deep breath, the salt-tinged air a sharp, clean shock to her lungs, and knocked on the door before the fear could take root. Eleanor answered, her smile as warm and genuine as before. There was no awkwardness in her greeting, no hint of curiosity about Aoife\u2019s previous behaviour. \"Aoife, good morning. Come in, come in. It\u2019s a beautiful day for it.\"\n\nShe led Aoife back to the sunlit study, where the desk stood waiting like a patient in a consulting room. The light caught the lifted, peeling veneer, the sickened wood looking even more vulnerable than Aoife remembered. \"Now,\" Eleanor said, her tone brisk but kind. \"I will be pottering about for most of the day, but please, make this space your own. I\u2019ve put a flask of tea and some biscuits on the side table for you. Don't be shy. If you need anything at all, just give me a shout.\" With that, she gave Aoife a final, encouraging smile and slipped out of the room, closing the door softly behind her, granting her the precious, necessary gift of solitude.\n\nAoife stood in the quiet room for a long moment, simply breathing. The silence was a balm. She approached the desk, not with the reverence of her first visit, but with the focused, diagnostic eye of a professional. This time, she would not allow herself to be overwhelmed. She was here to work. She carefully laid a canvas dust sheet on the polished floor and unrolled her tools, the familiar ritual a silent invocation of her craft. She set up her small, electric glue pot on a ceramic tile, filling it with water and a handful of the amber-coloured hide glue pellets. Soon, the air was filled with its distinctive, slightly sweet, animal smell. It was the smell of her grandfather\u2019s workshop, the scent of her own history. The memories began to prick at the edges of her consciousness, but she refused to let them overwhelm her. Instead, she anchored herself in the task, in the physical reality of the tools and the wood.\n\nShe began the painstaking process of lifting the damaged marquetry. With a fine, flexible spatula, she tested the edges of the peeling veneer, identifying the loose areas. Using a tacking iron set to a low heat, she gently warmed the surface, the heat penetrating the wood to soften the ancient, brittle hide glue beneath. It was a delicate, nerve-wracking process. Too much heat and she would scorch the wood; too little and the veneer would splinter and break. As she worked, she could feel the ghosts of her grandfather\u2019s lessons rising within her. *'Let the tool do the work, girl,'* his voice rumbled in her memory. *'Don't force it. Listen to the wood.'* This time, instead of recoiling from the memory, she leaned into it, using it as a guide. The voice was not a haunting; it was an instruction manual.\n\nShe came to the five-petalled flower, the delicate satinwood motif that had been her undoing. Her breath hitched. The air in the room grew thin and sharp. The colours of the book spines on the shelves seemed to bleed at the edges, becoming unnaturally vivid. The cold began its silent, inward creep. She felt the terrifying lightness, the sense that her own molecules were beginning to loosen their grip on one another. She froze, the heated iron hovering just above the delicate inlay. Her first instinct was to reach for pain, to find a sharp edge. But a second, newer instinct rose to meet it. She closed her eyes. She did not drop the tool. She did not slam her hand down. Instead, she deliberately pressed the cool, smooth steel handle of the iron against the soft skin of her forearm. It wasn't pain she sought, but sensation. The solid, cool weight of it. The reality of the tool in her hand. *'The tool is real,'* she thought, her internal voice a fierce, desperate whisper. *'The desk is real. The job is not finished.'* She focused on the task, breaking it down into its smallest components. *'Lift the top petal first. It's the most stable. Apply heat for three seconds. Slide the knife beneath. Easy.'* She opened her eyes. The room had settled. The colours were normal. The cold had receded, leaving her feeling shaky and hollow, but whole. She had held her ground.\n\nWhen Eleanor next entered, carrying a small plate with a slice of lemon cake, she found Aoife bent over the desk, her concentration absolute, a fine sheen of sweat on her brow. \"My goodness,\" Eleanor said softly, so as not to startle her. \"That looks like surgeon's work.\" Aoife looked up, her face pale but her eyes clear. She managed a small, tired smile. \"It just takes a bit of patience.\" Eleanor placed the plate on the side table. \"My grandmother, the one who owned this desk, she used to say that patience is just love made visible over time.\" The simple, profound wisdom of the statement settled over Aoife, not as a trigger, but as a deep, resonant truth. It was a definition of her craft, and perhaps, a clue to her own healing.\n\nBy the time the afternoon light began to fail, Aoife had successfully lifted every piece of damaged inlay from the main drawer front. The tiny, delicate shapes of satinwood and rosewood lay in perfect order on a baize-lined tray, a scattered mosaic of a story waiting to be put back together. The drawer itself, stripped of its finery, looked wounded and bare, but it was a clean wound, ready to be healed. She had survived the first day. She had stepped into the heart of her fear and had not been consumed. Looking at the neatly arranged chaos on the tray, the problem broken down into its constituent, manageable parts, she felt a quiet, exhausted sense of victory. The path ahead was still long and fraught with peril, but she was no longer lost. She was on the path, and her tools were in her hand."

When Aoife arrived, Eleanor greeted her with the same warm, uncomplicated smile, as if her presence in the house was now the most natural thing in the world. The study was waiting, the tray of disembodied wooden petals a silent testament to the previous day\u2019s battle. Aoife set to work immediately, her movements economical and sure. Today\u2019s task was cleaning. Before she could rebuild, she had to prepare the ground, removing every trace of the old, failed glue from both the drawer front and the back of each delicate piece of inlay. It was slow, tedious, repetitive work, requiring a light touch and infinite patience. Using a soft cloth dampened with warm water and a small, stiff brush, she gently scrubbed away the brittle, crystalline remnants of the past.\n\nThe work induced a state of deep, meditative focus. The world shrank to the tiny universe of a single piece of satinwood, its grain a miniature landscape she was carefully clearing. The scent of the warming hide glue began to fill the room again, a smell that had once been a prelude to panic but was now becoming something else: the smell of her own competence, the smell of work. Eleanor entered the room mid-morning, moving quietly so as not to disturb her. She wasn't checking on Aoife\u2019s progress, but simply retrieving a book from a high shelf. She paused for a moment, watching Aoife bent over the tray, her head bowed in concentration. \"That smell,\" Eleanor said softly, a nostalgic smile touching her lips. \"It reminds me of my father\u2019s workshop. He wasn\u2019t a fine craftsman like you, he just mended things around the house, but he always had a pot of that glue bubbling away. He used to call it the smell of second chances.\"\n\nThe words landed in the quiet room with the force of a revelation. *The smell of second chances.* Aoife looked up from her work, her eyes meeting Eleanor\u2019s. In that moment, a lifetime of association, of linking that scent with the irretrievable loss of her grandfather, was re-written. It wasn't the smell of an ending, but of a beginning. It wasn't the scent of death and memory, but of repair and renewal. A warmth spread through her chest, a feeling so unfamiliar it almost made her gasp. It was the antithesis of the cold, a profound and grateful thawing. She could only manage a small, shaky nod in response, but she knew Eleanor understood. The older woman gave her a knowing look, a flicker of deep empathy in her bright eyes, before she took her book and left Aoife alone with the profound, transformative gift she had just been given.\n\nWith the cleaning complete, the moment arrived to begin the reconstruction. This was the true art, the alchemy of turning a scattered collection of fragments back into a coherent, beautiful whole. She applied a thin, even layer of the warm, syrupy glue to the substrate of the drawer front. Working quickly but without haste, she began to re-lay the pieces of the marquetry puzzle. Using the fine tip of a probe and her own fingertips, she nudged each piece into its exact, original position, the warm, tacky glue gripping it in place. She then used a small, specialised tool called a veneer hammer, its smooth, polished head squeegeeing the piece down, forcing out any excess glue and air bubbles from beneath, ensuring a perfect, permanent bond. It was a delicate, rhythmic dance of placement and pressure, of knowledge and instinct. She was no longer just a mender; she was a creator, coaxing beauty back into existence.\n\nFinally, all that remained was the five-petalled flower. The trigger. The heart of the storm. She picked up the first pale petal, her hand steady, and laid it in its bed of glue. Then the second, and the third. As she reached for the fourth, she felt it: the familiar, cold whisper at the edge of her senses, the slight shimmer in her peripheral vision. The ghost was stirring, roused by the proximity of this potent symbol. She paused, her breath catching in her throat. The memory of her grandfather\u2019s hand next to the tea caddy was there, sharp and vivid. But this time, something else was there beside it: Eleanor\u2019s voice. *Patience is just love made visible over time.* And beneath that, another layer: *The smell of second chances.* The memories were no longer a single, unbearable note of loss. They were a chord, complex and bittersweet, containing grief but also love, connection, and now, hope. She looked down at the incomplete flower, at the small, perfect shape of the final petal held in her forceps. It was not a relic of an ending. It was a promise. With a slow, deliberate movement, she placed the final petal into the centre of the design. The flower was whole. As the last piece settled into place, a profound sense of rightness, of completion, washed through her, a warm, golden tide that pushed the cold and the fear back into the deep, leaving only a quiet, luminous peace. The desk was not the only thing being made whole in that sunlit room."

                                        "text": "The silence that followed the placement of the final petal was profound. It was not an empty silence, but one filled with a quiet, resonant hum, like the air after a bell has ceased to ring. Aoife did not move for a full minute, her hand still poised over the completed flower, her entire being suffused with a peace so complete it felt like a physical substance. The ghost in her machine had not been exorcised, but it had been answered. It had been met not with fear or pain, but with a quiet, determined love for the work, and it had fallen silent. With a slow, steady breath, she returned to the task, her movements fluid and sure. She took a clean, damp cloth and, with the lightest touch, wiped away the excess hide glue that had squeezed out from the edges of the inlay, cleaning the lines until they were perfect. The meticulous, gentle act was a confirmation of her victory, a physical tidying-up after the psychic storm.\n\nShe prepared for the clamping, the final, crucial stage that would make the repair permanent. She laid a sheet of waxed paper over the entire drawer front to prevent the glue from adhering to her clamping block, then placed a perfectly flat piece of beechwood\u2014a caul\u2014over the paper to distribute the pressure evenly across the entire surface of the marquetry. There would be no weak points, no areas of stress. The pressure had to be firm, even, and universal. She positioned two long sash cramps, their metal bars gleaming in the sunlight, and slowly, carefully, began to tighten them. The gentle, incremental creak of the screws was the sound of healing being enforced, of scattered pieces being brought into an unbreakable union. When the pressure was perfect, she stood back, her hands on her hips, and surveyed her work. The drawer, held in this firm, therapeutic embrace, was no longer a patient. It was in recovery.\n\nEleanor appeared in the doorway, a tray in her hands bearing two cups and a steaming teapot. Her eyes went immediately to the clamped drawer. A slow, wondrous smile spread across her face. \"Oh my,\" she said softly. \"It looks so... peaceful.\" She set the tray down and poured the tea, the clink of porcelain on porcelain the only sound. \"The waiting is the hardest part, isn't it?\" she mused, handing a cup to Aoife. \"For anything that\u2019s been truly broken. You do all the work, you put the pieces back together, but then you simply have to give it time to knit. To become strong again in its own way.\" Aoife took the cup, her fingers wrapping around its warmth. \"Yes,\" she said, her voice quiet but clear. \"You can't rush it.\" They drank their tea in a companionable silence, two women from different generations standing vigil over a piece of shared history, both understanding, without needing to say it, that they were talking about more than just furniture.\n\nThe next morning, Aoife arrived with a feeling of nervous, joyful anticipation. It was time to remove the clamps. She carefully unscrewed the long metal bars, her heart beating a little faster. She lifted away the caul and peeled back the waxed paper. The surface beneath was perfect. The inlay was a seamless, smooth tapestry of wood, the tiny, intricate pieces bonded so perfectly to the drawer front that they looked as if they had grown there. The five-petalled flower, once the epicentre of her terror, was now a small, quiet emblem of her resilience. She ran her fingers over it, feeling not a collection of fragments, but a single, unified, solid thing. It was whole. The sight of it, the simple, tangible fact of its wholeness, was so overwhelming that she had to brace herself against the desk, a wave of pure, unadulterated joy washing over her.\n\nNow came the final, transformative stage: the finishing. This was not about repair, but about revelation, about coaxing the wood\u2019s inner light to the surface. She would not use a harsh modern varnish that would sit on the wood like a sheet of glass. This desk deserved the slow, patient magic of a traditional French polish. She created a small pad, a \u2018fad\u2019, from cotton wadding wrapped in a linen cloth, and began the rhythmic, laborious process. Applying a small amount of shellac and a single drop of oil to the pad, she began to move it across the surface of the desk in sweeping, overlapping circles and figures of eight. It was a dance between her hand and the wood. The first few layers seemed to do nothing, but slowly, magically, a deep, warm lustre began to emerge from within the walnut, as if she were polishing a dormant fire back to life. The grain, which had looked dull and lifeless, began to shimmer with a three-dimensional depth, and the colours of the satinwood and rosewood inlay grew rich and vibrant. She was not applying a coating; she was building a history, layer by translucent layer.\n\nHer phone, forgotten on the side table, buzzed, the sound a jarring, mechanical intrusion into the quiet, organic work. She ignored it, lost in the rhythm of the polishing, but it buzzed again, insistent. With a sigh of irritation, she picked it up. The name on the screen was \u2018Duffy\u2019. The contrast between the soulless, transactional world he represented and the deeply personal, restorative work she was doing could not have been more stark. She answered, her voice cool. \"Aoife.\" \"Got a job for you,\" he said, his voice as brisk as ever. \"Tenant in Inchicore broke a toilet seat. Also punched a hole in a hollow-core door. Cheap job. When can you do it?\" The mundane, slightly sordid nature of the request, coming in this moment of quiet transcendence, was almost comical. A year ago, a week ago, she would have taken it without question, grateful for the work. Now, she felt a new sense of her own value. \"I can't, Michael,\" she said, her voice polite but firm, free of apology. \"I'm on a private commission this week. I'll be in touch when I'm free.\" There was a surprised pause on the other end of the line. \"A private commission?\" he repeated, the words sounding strange in his mouth. \"Alright then.\" He hung up, leaving Aoife staring at the phone. She had said no. She had chosen the art over the money, the soul over the grind. The simple act of prioritising her own well-being, her own satisfaction in her work, felt like a quiet revolution.\n\nBy the end of the fourth day, the desk was finished. The final layer of polish had been applied and buffed with a soft cloth to a deep, satin glow that felt warm to the touch. The light from the window flowed over its surface like water, catching the intricate dance of the wood grain and the subtle, jewelled colours of the restored marquetry. It was no longer sick. It was luminous, alive, its history of damage not erased, but integrated into a new and more beautiful whole. Aoife stood back, her arms crossed, every muscle in her body aching with a deep, satisfying fatigue. She could see her own faint reflection in the polished walnut, not a ghost, not a void, not a shimmering absence, but the solid, breathing form of a woman. A woman with strong, capable hands. A woman who had faced down her own ghosts and had, through the slow, patient application of love and skill, learned how to mend."

                                        "text": "When Eleanor finally came into the study, drawn by the profound silence, she found Aoife standing before the desk, her hands loose at her sides, her posture one of deep, quiet stillness. The air in the room was thick with the resinous, almost fruity scent of shellac and the faint, warm smell of the wood itself. The desk glowed in the afternoon light, its surface a mirror of deep, liquid shadow and warm, honeyed fire. It was no longer a piece of furniture; it was a presence, an heirloom restored not just to its former glory, but to its very soul. Eleanor stopped in the doorway, her hand flying to her mouth, a soft, involuntary gasp escaping her lips. For a long moment, she said nothing, her eyes slowly travelling over the seamless surface, the resurrected colours of the inlay, the deep, warm lustre that seemed to emanate from within the wood itself.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s singing,\u201d she finally whispered, the words filled with a quiet awe. She walked slowly towards it, as one might approach a shy, wild creature, her hand outstretched. She did not touch it at first, but simply hovered her palm over the surface, as if feeling its warmth, its energy. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen it look like this since I was a little girl, watching my grandmother polish it. I thought this\u2026 this life in it was gone forever.\u201d She finally let her fingertips make contact, her touch feather-light on the five-petalled flower. She looked at Aoife, her eyes shining with unshed tears. \u201cYou are a magician, Aoife. A true artist. You haven't just repaired it. You have healed it.\u201d The word, \u2018healed\u2019, struck Aoife with the force of a physical blow, a validation so complete and so resonant that it left her breathless. This was the language she had been searching for, the true name for the work she had just done, both on the desk and on herself.\n\nThe business of payment felt like a clumsy, profane intrusion after such a moment, but it was necessary. Eleanor insisted on paying her five hundred euro, a hundred more than the quoted price. \u201cFor artistry,\u201d she said simply, pressing the notes into Aoife\u2019s hand and closing her own fingers over them, refusing any argument. \u201cAnd for kindness.\u201d But the real payment came a moment later. \u201cI am the secretary of the local historical society,\u201d Eleanor said, her tone becoming more business-like, though the warmth never left her eyes. \u201cWe have a number of pieces in our small collection that are in a similar state of gentle decay. And I have friends, many friends, with beautiful old things they are afraid to trust to just anyone. I would be honoured, Aoife, if you would allow me to give them your number.\u201d It was more than an offer of work; it was a key. It was an invitation into a world where her unique, quiet skills would be not just used, but cherished. It was the promise of a future built not on survival, but on beauty.\n\nWalking back to her bedsit, the crisp notes a solid weight in her pocket, Aoife felt a lightness she had never known. The city no longer felt like a place to hide, but a place to inhabit. The faces of the people she passed were not potential threats, but simply other people, living their own complex lives alongside her. The familiar architecture of the Dublin streets seemed to welcome her, its faded grandeur a tapestry she was now a part of. She felt an ownership of her own steps, a right to the space she occupied, that was entirely new. For her entire life, she had felt like a secret, an apology, a person living on borrowed time and a borrowed name. Now, walking under the wide, open sky, she felt, for the first time, irrefutably real. Her existence was not a lie. It was a fact, as solid and tangible as the pavement beneath her feet.\n\nBack in her room, the sanctuary she had built for herself, she did not collapse in exhausted relief. Instead, she was filled with a clear, quiet energy. She went to her workbench and took out a clean sheet of drawing paper and a sharp pencil. She began to sketch, not the plans for a piece of furniture, but a design. A logo. She drew a simple, elegant circle, and within it, the clean, intersecting lines of a dovetail joint, a symbol of strength, integrity, and hidden beauty. Beneath it, she carefully lettered a name: \u2018True Grain Restorations\u2019. It felt right. It was honest. It spoke of the wood, but it also spoke of her own journey, of following the flaw back to its source and finding the true grain of her own character beneath the warp and stain of the past. For the first time, she envisioned a future where she was not just Aoife, the quiet carpenter, but Aoife, the proprietor of her own business, a woman defined not by her history, but by her craft.\n\nA few days later, a sense of rightness guided her back to The Auld Triangle. She pushed open the heavy door in the late afternoon, when the pub was in its usual state of quiet, beery contemplation. A few of the same old men were at the bar, and they looked up as she entered, a flicker of recognition in their eyes. Declan was behind the bar, polishing a glass. He saw her, and his usual impassive expression didn't change, but he gave a single, almost imperceptible nod of acknowledgement. He was no longer looking at the fainting girl, but at the carpenter who had fixed his door. She walked to the bar, the floorboards solid and silent beneath her feet, and ordered a half-pint of Guinness. The act of sitting at the bar, of being a customer in this place that had been the scene of her deepest humiliation, was a quiet, powerful reclamation. Declan set the drink before her, the dark liquid settling under its creamy head. \"Heard that fella Duffy's been keeping you busy,\" he grunted, his back to her as he stocked a shelf with glasses. \"Heard you told him where to go, as well.\" He turned, a flicker of something like a smile at the corner of his mouth. \"Good for you. He pays, but he's a miserable sod.\" The gruff approval, the sense of being included in the pub's network of gossip and judgment, was more welcoming than a red carpet. She was no longer an outsider to be scrutinised, but a known quantity, a part of the local ecosystem.\n\nThat evening, as she climbed the stairs to her bedsit, a deep sense of peace settled over her. She had money in the bank, the promise of meaningful work to come, and a fragile, growing sense of community in this city that had taken her in. She was tired, but it was the deep, satisfying ache of a day well spent, of a life being built with her own two hands. Her key slid into the lock, the sound familiar and comforting. Home. As she pushed the door open, she saw it immediately. A single, white envelope lying on the welcome mat, where it must have been slipped under the door. It was out of place in her spartan, paperless world. It wasn't a bill; it wasn't a circular. She bent to pick it up, a mild curiosity turning to a sudden, sharp chill as she saw the handwriting. It was a neat, slightly anxious cursive, every letter perfectly formed, every line perfectly straight. It was a hand she would know in the dark, a hand she had seen on birthday cards and shopping lists her entire life. It was her mother\u2019s. The peace of the evening shattered into a thousand pieces. The ghost she had silenced in the sunlit study was nothing compared to this.

                                        "text": "For a long, frozen moment, Aoife did not breathe. The envelope in her hand was a sliver of ice, its chill seeping not into her skin but directly into her bones. The world she had so carefully, so painstakingly, constructed over the past few weeks\u2014a world of quiet work, of solid objects, of manageable fears\u2014crumbled to dust in the space of a single heartbeat. Her room, her sanctuary, was no longer safe. The locked door was a joke, the four walls a cage whose location was now known. The past had not just found her address; it had breached her perimeter, slipped under her door like a poisonous gas, and was now occupying the very air she was trying to breathe.\n\nHer mother\u2019s handwriting was a weapon of terrifying intimacy. It was the hand that had written \u2018Aoife\u2019 on the flyleaf of her first book, the hand that had penned consoling notes when she was a lonely, awkward teenager. Each perfectly formed letter was a hook, each neat, straight line a thread in the web she had just escaped. It was the script of a lifetime of love, a love so deeply entangled with the foundational lie of her existence that she could no longer tell the two apart. The very sight of it was a summons back to a life of apology, of being a problem to be managed, a secret to be kept. Her first, overwhelming instinct was to burn it, to destroy the physical evidence of the intrusion, to pretend it had never happened. Her second was to run, to pack her tools and flee into the night, to find another city, another anonymous room, and start the desperate, exhausting process all over again.\n\nThen the feeling started. Not a whisper this time, but a roar. A profound, internal vertigo, a sickening lurch as if the floor had dropped away from beneath her. The edges of her vision began to fizz and dissolve, the familiar shapes of her room\u2014the workbench, the single chair, the neat stack of books\u2014wavering as if seen through intense heat. The cold was a violent invasion, a hostile presence that drove the warmth from her body and replaced it with the absolute zero of the void. This was it. The direct confrontation, the thing she had been running from, and it was going to unmake her in the safety of her own home. She staggered back, her uninjured hand flying to her chest, trying to feel the solid beat of her own heart, but her fingers felt numb, disconnected, their substance already questionable. Panic was a silent scream in a vacuum. She was losing.\n\nHer gaze, frantic and unfocused, fell upon her workbench. The beechwood, glowing faintly in the lamplight. The neat, ordered row of her tools, their steel edges gleaming. The drawing of her logo, a symbol of a future she had dared to imagine. *No.* The word was a silent, furious rebellion. It was a refusal. She would not be erased by a piece of paper. She would not allow her mother\u2019s fearful love to be the thing that finally broke her. Lurching across the room, she slammed her good hand down flat on the workbench, the solid, unyielding shock of the impact a thunderclap in the silent chaos of her mind. She gripped the sharp, square edge of the wood, her knuckles white, pouring every ounce of her will, every dreg of her newfound strength, into that single point of contact. *True Grain Restorations,* she thought, the words a desperate, powerful incantation. *This is who I am. This is my name. I am not a secret. I am a carpenter. I am solid. I am here.*\n\nThe fight was immense. The void pulled at her, a vast, silent tide, but the anchor of the workbench held. The pain in her bandaged hand flared in sympathy, a hot, throbbing reality. The scent of wood and oil, the sight of the pencil lines of her own design, the tangible weight of her own body leaning against the bench\u2014they were facts, and she clung to them as a drowning woman clings to a piece of wreckage. Slowly, agonizingly, the world solidified. The fizzing at the edges of her vision ceased. The colour returned to the room. The profound cold receded, leaving her trembling, drenched in sweat, and utterly exhausted, but whole. She was still holding the envelope, its paper now crumpled from the ferocity of her grip. She had not run. She had not burned it. She had held her ground. And she had won.\n\nWith a strange, cold calm that felt like the quiet eye of a hurricane, she sat down on her mattress and, using a thumbnail, slit the envelope open. The single sheet of paper inside was filled with that same neat, anxious script. It was everything she had feared. It was a mother\u2019s frantic, heartbroken plea, a litany of sleepless nights and imagined horrors. Eamonn, it said, was a wreck, haunted by what he had seen, oscillating between terror and a furious, protective anger. Maura wrote that she didn\u2019t understand what he was talking about\u2014vanishing, devilry, it was all nonsense\u2014but she knew her daughter was in pain, and that was the only truth that mattered. The letter ended with the two things Aoife dreaded most. The first was the confirmation: *\u2018I had to find you, my love. I gave a man your name, and he found where you opened the bank account. I am so sorry if it frightens you, but I couldn\u2019t bear not knowing.\u2019* The violation was confirmed. She had been hunted, her fragile privacy shattered by their loving, desperate panic.\n\nThe second was the final line: *\u2018Whatever this is, Aoife, we can fix it. Just come home. We will get you help. We will make it right. I love you. Mam.\u2019* *We can fix it. We will get you help.* The words were a cage, lovingly constructed, softly padded, but a cage all the same. She was not a person to them; she was a project, a problem patient. A deep, glacial anger began to form beneath her exhaustion and her fear. It was an anger at the casual, loving tyranny of their worry, at their assumption that she needed to be \u2018fixed\u2019, that her only path to wholeness was a return to the life that had been slowly erasing her. They saw her as broken, but she had just spent a week making something broken beautiful again. She had just found the true grain of herself. She would not allow them to plane it away.\n\nShe stood up and walked back to the workbench, the letter in her hand. For a moment, she considered her response. She could write back, a mirror image of her mother\u2019s letter, pleading for them to leave her be. But pleading was the language of a victim, and she was done being a victim. She needed a new language. She looked down at the design she had sketched, at the clean lines of the dovetail joint. Strength. Integrity. A union of two separate pieces that was stronger than the wood itself. She picked up a fresh sheet of paper, not the cheap notepad she used for quotes, but a heavy, cream-coloured sheet of drawing paper. She took her sharpest pencil, and in a hand that was not her mother's anxious cursive, but her own clear, precise, architectural script, she began to write. It was not a long letter. It was not a plea. It was a statement of fact. It was a declaration. And it was the first completely honest thing she had ever written to her family in her entire life."

                                        "text": "The pencil felt light and sure in her hand. Where Maura\u2019s script was a nervous, forward-slanting rush of anxieties corralled into neat lines, Aoife\u2019s was the upright, measured script of an architect, each letter a small, considered structure. She was not writing a response to her mother\u2019s plea; she was issuing a correction, a revision to the story they had all been living. There would be no frantic emotion, no tide of resentment. There would only be the clean, solid lines of the truth as she now understood it. She dipped the pencil lead onto the creamy paper, the soft rasp a sound of quiet creation.\n\n*Dear Mam,* she wrote, then paused, and with deliberate firmness, added, *and Eamonn*. They were a unit in this, the twin pillars of the loving, suffocating pressure that had almost crushed her. *I have your letter. I am writing to tell you that I am safe. More than that, I am well. I understand that you are worried, and I know that your worry comes from love. But you must understand this: I am not sick, and I do not need to be fixed.* The words sat on the page, stark and unequivocal. She thought of the warped door on the mahogany wardrobe, of Eamonn\u2019s instinct to force it, and her own patient work of planing it back to truth. The right metaphor came to her, a piece of wood shaped to fit the space. *You cannot force a warped piece of timber straight; you will only break it. It needs time, and the right conditions, to find its own stability. I have found those conditions here. I am working. I have a life that I am building with my own two hands, a life that makes sense to me.*\n\nThe most difficult part came next: the boundary. This could not be a negotiation. It had to be a wall, cleanly and firmly built. *The greatest help you can give me now is to trust me. The greatest love you can show me is to let me be. For that to happen, you cannot look for me. You cannot send letters. You cannot ask people to find me. It is not safe for me when you do.* The ambiguity of that last sentence was a shield. They would read it as a cry of fragile emotional health; she knew it as a statement of literal, existential fact. Her survival depended on their absence. *I need time. When I am ready, I will be in touch. But it will be on my terms, in my own time.* She paused, her pencil hovering over the bottom of the page. How to sign it? Not \u2018your daughter\u2019, not \u2018your step-sister\u2019. Those were the old names, the old lies. She simply wrote her name, *Aoife*. It was enough. It was everything. As a final, declarative act, she folded the drawing of her logo\u2014the dovetail joint in its perfect circle\u2014and slipped it into the envelope with the letter. It was not an explanation, but a new emblem, a new coat of arms for the sovereign state of her own life.\n\nShe did not post it that night. She sealed the envelope and placed it on her workbench, next to her sharpening stones. It was a promise she would keep in the morning. The act of writing, of articulating her own position with such finality, had drained the last of her adrenaline, leaving a profound, bone-deep weariness in its place. But beneath the exhaustion was a solid foundation of peace. The crisis had not been averted; it had been met. She slept that night without dreams, a deep, restorative plunge into a darkness that was not a void, but a quiet, restful space. In the morning, she walked to the pillar box on the corner, the white envelope a stark, clean rectangle in her hand. The city was waking around her, the air crisp and full of the smell of coffee and diesel fumes. The world was going about its business, indifferent to the small, monumental act she was about to perform. She slid the letter into the slot. The soft, definitive thud as it landed inside was the sound of a door closing on her old life, and another one, somewhere else, creaking open.\n\nReturning to the room, she felt a profound sense of lightness. The space was hers again, the air clean. There was no ghost of her mother\u2019s handwriting on the mat, no lingering chill of a breached perimeter. She made herself a cup of tea and then, with a sense of quiet ceremony, she cleared her workbench, wiping away the pencil dust and laying out a soft cloth. From a carefully wrapped package in her tool roll, she took out the drawer from Eleanor\u2019s desk, its new finish glowing with a deep, inner life. She had brought it back with her for one final, obsessive round of polishing. As she applied a tiny amount of wax and began to buff the surface with slow, circular motions, she was not just finishing a job. She was reaffirming her choice, polishing her own new reality until it shone. The rhythm of the work was a prayer, each sweep of the cloth a declaration: *This is my life. This is my peace. This is what is real.*\n\nA few days later, her phone rang. The number was unfamiliar. For a second, the old, conditioned reflex of fear made her stomach clench, but it was a phantom pain, an echo of a fear that no longer had teeth. She answered, her voice calm. \"Hello?\" \"Hello, is that Aoife?\" a man\u2019s voice asked, warm and with a gentle, west-of-Ireland lilt. \"My name is Peter Joyce. Eleanor Vance gave me your number. She said you were something of a miracle worker.\" Aoife smiled, a real, unforced smile that reached her eyes. \"Eleanor is very kind,\" she said. \"She said you restore old things,\" he continued. \"Well, I have a library chair. My father\u2019s chair. The leg is broken, but more than that\u2026 it\u2019s just lost its spirit. Eleanor said you would understand what I mean.\"\n\nAoife looked around her small, sunlit room, at the workbench she had built, at the city stretching out beyond her window. The work was waiting. A life was waiting. It was a life of mending broken things, of coaxing the spirit back into forgotten objects, of patience and love made visible over time. She had found her place, not by running from the flaw in her own grain, but by following it, by working with it, until she had shaped it into a strength. The path ahead was uncertain, but it was hers, and she would walk it in her own time. She picked up a pencil, ready to take down the address. \"Yes,\" she said, her voice filled with a quiet, steady confidence. \"I understand completely.\""
