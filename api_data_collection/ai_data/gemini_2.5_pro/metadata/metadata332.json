     "novel_text": "The hum was his only constant companion. A low, guttural thrum that vibrated through the concrete floor and up into the soles of his bare, calloused feet. It was the sound of preservation. The sound of his collection. Rob ran a long, three-jointed finger down the frosted white door of the freezer, his nail, thick and yellow as old horn, leaving a faint scratch in the ice. He smiled, a grimace that pulled his thin lips back over grey gums. The expression didn't reach his eyes. Nothing ever reached his eyes, two pits of glittering black obsidian sunk deep in a face the colour of damp parchment.\n\nHe hated the hum, but he needed it. He hated most things. He hated the cheerful, lilting way the morning news announcer on the cheap radio pronounced \u2018Charlottetown\u2019. He hated the smell of salt on the air, a constant reminder of the endless, mocking water that surrounded this stupid little island. He hated the colour red when it was on a stop sign or a valentine, but he loved it when it was wet and fresh and pooling on linoleum. Most of all, he hated nurses. He hated their clean, sterile smell that was a lie, a cover for the rot and decay they wallowed in every day. He hated their soft voices, their patronizing questions\u2014*are you comfortable? Is the pain manageable?*\u2014and the squeak of their rubber-soled shoes on polished floors. They were angels of a mercy he had never been shown, and for that, he would tear their wings off, one by one.\n\nWith a grunt, he pulled the heavy freezer door open. A cloud of frigid air, smelling faintly of meat and frost, billowed out into the damp basement air. His breath hitched. It was a cathedral. Inside, stacked with a disturbing neatness, were dozens of small, vacuum-sealed plastic bags. Each was labelled with a date and a name written in his spidery, cramped script. *Brenda. 14/08. Sharon. 29/08. Mary-Anne. 11/09.* Inside each opaque, frosted pouch was a tongue. He reached in, his long fingers brushing past Sharon, and plucked a more recent acquisition from the top. *Cynthia. 23/09.*\n\nHe carried the small, hard packet over to the single bare bulb that hung from a frayed cord, illuminating a small circle of his subterranean world. A stained mattress in the corner, a wobbly card table with a hot plate, and stacks of medical textbooks stolen from library dumpsters. He held the packet up to the light. The tongue inside was a pale, frozen lump. Cynthia\u2019s. He remembered her. The way she\u2019d tucked a loose strand of blonde hair behind her ear. The little humming sound she made while checking a patient\u2019s blood pressure. A song of life, so easily silenced. He\u2019d watched her for a week, learning her routine, the way she always left the back door unlocked for her cat, the way she drank peppermint tea before bed. The details were important. They were seasoning.\n\nHis stomach rumbled, a low, acidic growl. He wasn\u2019t hungry for the tongue. These were not for eating. They were for remembering. They were the punctuation marks in the long, rambling sentence of his hatred. The meal itself had been\u2026 nourishing. He could still feel the strength of it coursing through his sinewy frame, a warmth that fought back the perpetual chill of his existence. He placed the packet for Cynthia back in its place of honour, his fingers tracing the frozen shape. A good specimen. He had been careful with the excision, using the scalpel he\u2019d taken from Brenda\u2019s medical bag. Precision was a form of respect, in its own way. A respect for the purity of his own loathing. He closed the freezer door, and the hum settled back into its rhythm. Outside his grimy basement window, a sliver of which sat at ground level, he could see the ankles of people walking by on the sidewalk above. Squeaking shoes, purposeful strides. The world of the living. A world that did not know he was down here, waiting, and hating.\n\n* * *\n\nDetective Inspector Isolde Galt believed that philanthropy was simply a form of proactive policing. You could arrest a man for breaking into a house to feed his family, or you could fund a community kitchen that ensured he never got that hungry in the first place. One was a bandage, the other a cure. Her colleagues on the Charlottetown force thought her soft, a bleeding heart with a trust fund and a fancy title. They saw the Galt Foundation\u2019s donations to youth centres and urban gardens and saw a vanity project. They didn\u2019t see the long game. They didn\u2019t see the intricate web of community and trust she was weaving, a net that caught problems long before they washed up as files on her desk.\n\nToday, she was wrist-deep in rich, dark earth. The new community garden in the heart of the city\u2019s east end was her latest project, a patch of reclaimed land that had been an eyesore of weeds and broken glass a month ago. Now, it was a grid of freshly-built raised beds, smelling of cedar and possibility. She was showing a group of teenagers how to properly space kale seedlings, the sun warm on the back of her neck, when her phone buzzed in the pocket of her jeans. She wiped a muddy hand on her thigh before answering, a smear of brown earth a stark contrast to the crisp white of her blouse.\n\n\u201cGalt.\u201d\n\n\u201cMa\u2019am. It\u2019s Miller. We\u2019ve got a bad one. 115 Fitzroy, apartment 4B.\u201d\n\nSergeant Frank Miller\u2019s voice was stripped of its usual laconic drawl. There was a new tension in it, a wire pulled too tight. Galt\u2019s entire posture shifted. The philanthropist melted away, and the DI solidified in her place. Her spine straightened. Her gaze, which had been soft and encouraging, sharpened to a fine point.\n\n\u201cDefine \u2018bad one,\u2019 Frank.\u201d\n\nThere was a pause. She could hear him take a breath, trying to find the professional language for something that had clearly shaken him. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 a mess, ma\u2019am. The vic is Janine O\u2019Dell. A nurse at the QEH. A wellness check called in by her sister. The super let us in.\u201d He paused again. \u201cYou\u2019d better just come see for yourself. Forensics is on the way, but\u2026 this isn\u2019t like anything I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m on my way.\u201d She ended the call, her mind already scrubbing the kale seedlings and the smiling teenagers from its slate. She washed her hands under a garden hose, the cold water doing little to wash away the sudden iciness that had bloomed in her gut. Fitzroy Street. A quiet, respectable block of old brick walk-ups, home to students and young professionals. Janine O\u2019Dell. The name meant nothing to her, but \u2018nurse at the QEH\u2019 snagged in her thoughts. It was a detail that felt important, though she couldn\u2019t say why.\n\nThe drive across town was short. Charlottetown was not a large city, a fact that Galt usually cherished. It fostered a sense of community, of shared space. But today, its smallness felt claustrophobic, as if a predator had been released into a pen that was far too small. As she pulled up to the curb, the flashing lights of the first-responder vehicles seemed to bleed onto the vibrant gold and orange leaves of the maple trees lining the street, a garish, ugly stain on the perfect autumn afternoon.\n\nMiller was waiting for her on the sidewalk, his face pale, a shade lighter than his sandy hair. He was a good cop, solid and dependable, but his imagination was a blunt instrument. He saw the world in black and white, right and wrong. Galt knew that the truth was almost always found in the grey.\n\n\u201cWhat have we got?\u201d she asked, skipping the pleasantries.\n\n\u201cUpstairs. Like I said. It\u2019s\u2026 visceral.\u201d Miller led the way into the building. The lobby smelled of lemon polish and old carpets. There was no hint of the violence waiting three floors up. As they climbed the stairs, a different smell began to assert itself. Faint at first, then stronger. Copper. A butcher-shop smell that clung to the back of the throat. And something else underneath it. Something wilder. Gamey.\n\nThe door to 4B was ajar, a yellow ribbon of police tape already stretched across it. The apartment was small, tidy. A stack of magazines on a coffee table, a half-finished mug of tea on the kitchen counter, a cat-shaped cookie jar on top of the fridge. It was the picture of a quiet, ordinary life. Except for the body.\n\nJanine O\u2019Dell lay on the floor of her small living room, her limbs arranged in a way that was profoundly, hideously wrong. Galt\u2019s eyes took in the scene with a practiced, detached coolness that was the only shield she had against the horror. She catalogued the details. No signs of a struggle at the door. No forced entry. The victim was in her pyjamas. The television was on, muted. The violence had been sudden, and it had been personal. Her gaze swept the room, looking for the inconsistency, the thing that didn\u2019t belong. Her eyes landed on the half-empty mug on the counter. Peppermint tea. The bag was still in it. An open box of the same tea sat beside it.\n\n\u201cThe ME is going to have a field day,\u201d Miller muttered, his voice low. \u201cWounds are\u2026 I don\u2019t even know what to call them. Not knife, not bullet. Tearing. Bites, maybe? Big ones.\u201d\n\nGalt didn\u2019t answer. She crouched down, careful not to disturb anything, her gaze fixed on the victim\u2019s face. The woman\u2019s eyes were open, wide with a final, uncomprehending terror. Her mouth was agape. And it was empty. Not just empty of a scream, but empty of the organ that would have produced it.\n\nGalt felt a cold dread snake its way up her spine, colder and more primal than the initial shock. This was the detail Miller had struggled to articulate. This was the thing that made the scene more than a simple, brutal murder.\n\n\u201cFrank,\u201d she said, her voice quiet but sharp as a shard of glass. \u201cCheck her medical records. Check her work locker, her car. I want to know if she carried a personal medical kit. I want to know if she\u2019s missing a scalpel.\u201d\n\nMiller looked at her, confused. \u201cA scalpel? Ma\u2019am, whatever did this, it wasn\u2019t a scalpel.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe wounds, no,\u201d Galt agreed, standing up and looking around the pristine apartment again. The cat cookie jar. The tidy magazines. The brutalized body. The surgically absent tongue. \u201cBut the thing that was taken\u2026 that was done with precision.\u201d She walked towards the window and looked down at the street below, at the flashing lights that seemed so inadequate now. This wasn't a crime of passion. It wasn't a robbery gone wrong. This was a harvest. And the terrible, chilling thought that settled over her was that the harvest was not yet over. Somewhere in her small, peaceful city, a monster was putting his tools away, sated for now, and waiting for his hunger to rise again.Miller stared at her, the request hanging in the blood-scented air. \u201cA scalpel, ma\u2019am? You think this is connected to her work?\u201d He gestured vaguely at the carnage on the floor. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t look like a disgruntled patient.\u201d\n\n\u201cA disgruntled patient doesn\u2019t do this, Frank. This is\u2026 worship. This is a ritual.\u201d Galt\u2019s gaze was distant, seeing not just the room but the invisible lines of connection that might stretch out from it. \u201cThe brutality is a performance, but the trophy is the point. He\u2019s taking their voices. I want a list of every female nurse or care worker reported missing in the Maritimes in the last six months. Check New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, too. We don't know how far he travels. Cross-reference it with any unsolved homicides with unusual levels of violence, even if the details don\u2019t match this exactly. The M.O. might have evolved. This might be the first time he\u2019s left a body to be found.\u201d\n\nThe implication hung in the air. That there were others. That Janine O\u2019Dell was not the beginning, but simply the first time the killer had become visible. Miller swallowed hard, his notepad already in his hand. The scope of the investigation had just exploded from a single, horrific murder in Charlottetown to a potential multi-province serial killer case. He nodded, the dependable soldier receiving his orders, and moved towards the door to start making calls. The case had grown teeth, and he could feel them at his throat.\n\nGalt heard the forensics team arriving, the clatter of their metal cases a starkly practical sound in the charged atmosphere. Dr. Ben Carter, the chief medical examiner, entered first. He was a small, neat man with a bird-like curiosity that was at odds with his grim profession. He took in the scene with a practiced eye, his expression unreadable as he put on a fresh pair of gloves. He exchanged a brief, solemn nod with Galt before turning his full attention to the victim.\n\n\u201cWhat a contradiction,\u201d he murmured, more to himself than to her, as he knelt. Galt moved closer, staying outside the perimeter of the body. \u201cThe primary wounds\u2026 massive tissue damage, avulsions, serrated edges on the bone. Looks like he used his teeth and his hands. The sheer force is\u2026 staggering. But then you look at the oral cavity.\u201d He shone a penlight into Janine O\u2019Dell\u2019s open mouth. \u201cThe glossectomy is a masterpiece of butchery. Not a nick on the gums, the lips, or the palate. The lingual artery was perfectly clamped or cauterized. Minimal peripheral bleeding. He used a tool for this part. Something incredibly sharp and precise. And he knew exactly what he was doing.\u201d\n\nGalt\u2019s theory solidified into a cold, hard certainty. A scalpel. Or something very much like it. The killer was a brute and a surgeon, a monster with a steady hand. She turned away from the body, her mind needing a different problem to solve. The apartment itself. She walked into the small kitchen, her eyes scanning every surface. The cat-shaped cookie jar. The open box of peppermint tea. The half-drunk mug. She picked up a framed photo from the counter. Janine O\u2019Dell, smiling, holding a fluffy ginger cat.\n\n\u201cFrank,\u201d she called out to Miller, who was standing in the doorway. \u201cThe sister who called in the wellness check. Get her on the phone. I want to know about the cat. I want to know if Janine was in the habit of leaving a door or a window open for it.\u201d The lack of forced entry was a scream in the quiet apartment. A killer this careful, this deliberate, would not have been clumsy. He wouldn\u2019t have kicked in the door. He would have slipped in, a shadow through a crack that his victim provided. He had studied her. He had known her habits. The thought made the crime feel even more intimate, more violating.\n\nLeaving Carter and his team to their meticulous, grim work, Galt walked back out into the hallway. The scent of copper and decay clung to her clothes. As she descended the stairs, the smell of lemon polish in the lobby seemed like a pathetic lie. The whole building, the whole street, the whole, beautiful, sun-drenched autumn city felt like a lie. A flimsy stage set behind which something ancient and ravenous was stirring. She stepped out into the fresh air, but it brought no relief. She could feel the killer\u2019s presence settle over Charlottetown like a low-pressure system, a promise of the storm to come. He was here. He was one of them. He was hiding in plain sight, and he was collecting voices. Isolde Galt\u2019s jaw tightened. She would give them back.Back in her unmarked sedan, Galt closed her eyes for a moment, the image of the victim\u2019s empty mouth burned onto the inside of her eyelids. She was not a woman given to flights of fancy, but she could almost hear the ghost of a scream, a soundless cry of violation that was more chilling than any noise. Her phone buzzed again, and she answered without looking at the screen, her voice flat. \u201cGalt.\u201d It was Miller. \u201cMa\u2019am, I just got off the phone with the sister, Eleanor. You were right. Janine had a cat, Marmalade. She was worried sick about him getting out onto the street, so she never used the front door. But the kitchen has a back door that opens onto an old iron fire escape. She had a small cat flap installed in that door last year. The sister says it leads to a little enclosed landing one storey up from the alley. Janine thought it was perfectly safe, just a little private balcony for the cat.\u201d\n\nA cold thread of certainty stitched itself through Galt\u2019s thoughts. It wasn\u2019t a guess anymore. The killer had watched. He had learned. He knew about the cat, the back door, the illusion of safety. He would have scaled the wall in the darkness of the alley, silent and unseen, and slipped through that small opening meant for a beloved pet. He had turned her sanctuary into a trapdoor. \u201cGet forensics to dust every inch of that fire escape and the alley wall below it,\u201d she ordered, her voice low and tight. \u201cHe\u2019s careful, but he\u2019s not a ghost. He had to touch something.\u201d She ended the call and stared through the windshield at the street, at the ordinary brick of the building that now seemed to hold a terrible secret. The killer hadn\u2019t broken in. He had been let in by the simple, trusting habits of his victim\u2019s daily life.\n\nThe hum was his choir, the single droning note of his private hymn. Rob sat at the wobbly card table, the book open before him under the stark light of the single bulb. *Gray\u2019s Anatomy for Students.* The pages were worn, the diagrams of the human head and neck smudged with his fingerprints. He wasn\u2019t a student, not in any formal sense. He was a scholar of a much older, more fundamental discipline. He traced the elegant curve of the glossopharyngeal nerve with a grimy fingernail, marvelling at its complexity. All of it, the intricate wiring for taste, for speech, for the simple act of swallowing, all of it serving that one fleshy muscle. A muscle designed for lies. *Are you comfortable?* A lie. *This won\u2019t hurt a bit.* A lie. *I\u2019m here to help.* The biggest lie of all.\n\nHis work on Janine\u2014he didn\u2019t know her name, he thought of her as \u2018Peppermint Tea\u2019\u2014had been exquisite. He\u2019d made the incision just posterior to the circumvallate papillae, a clean, deep cut. He had ligated the arteries with a practiced efficiency born of study and repetition. The brachial strength required for the rest of it, for the breaking and the tearing, was a different kind of skill, a primal satisfaction that sang in his blood. But the precision, that was his art. He flexed his long, three-jointed fingers. They were instruments of a terrible and exacting craft. He had learned from his mistakes. Brenda had been messy. Sharon had been better. With Cynthia, and now with Peppermint Tea, he had achieved a kind of perfection. He closed the book, the dry rustle of the page an Amen to his silent prayer. He was not just a collector. He was an archivist of silence, the sole curator of a museum of stolen voices.\n\nBy evening, the organized chaos of the investigation had found a home in the main briefing room of the Charlottetown station. A large whiteboard dominated one wall, with \u201cJanine O\u2019Dell\u201d written at the top. Galt stood before it, a mug of black coffee in her hand, watching as the sparse details began to populate the sterile white surface. Miller came in, looking tired but wired, and pinned a plastic-enclosed photograph to the board. It was a blurry shot of a partial footprint, taken in the damp soil of the alleyway behind Janine\u2019s apartment building. \u201cForensics found scuff marks on the bricks below the fire escape, ma\u2019am. Consistent with someone climbing the wall. They found this print by a dumpster about twenty feet away. The soil was too soft for a clean impression, but the lab says it\u2019s from a work boot, men\u2019s size twelve or thirteen. Big guy.\u201d\n\nGalt nodded, her eyes fixed on the print. It was a ghost, a faint trace, but it was something tangible. It gave their unsubstance a footprint. As Miller stepped back, a junior analyst, a young woman with wide, nervous eyes, approached Galt holding a flimsy sheet of paper. \u201cDI Galt? We ran that search you asked for. Missing female healthcare workers in the Maritimes, last six months.\u201d She hesitated, swallowing. \u201cWe got a hit. A probable. A Licensed Practical Nurse named Sharon Delaney. Went missing from Moncton, New Brunswick, nine weeks ago. Vanished from the hospital parking garage after a double shift. No witnesses, no ransom, no activity on her accounts. Her case file is cold.\u201d\n\nGalt took the paper. Sharon Delaney. 29. LPN at The Moncton Hospital. A smiling, professional headshot was clipped to the report. Galt stared at the photo, a chill creeping over her that had nothing to do with the station\u2019s aggressive air conditioning. The name itself meant nothing, but the profession, the timeline, the simple, quiet vanishing\u2014it all fit. It was a perfect echo of the silence that now filled Janine O\u2019Dell\u2019s apartment. \u201cGet me everything Moncton has on her case,\u201d Galt said, her voice dangerously quiet. \u201cAnd run another search. Broaden the parameters. Look for any single-fatality accidents or un-witnessed suicides involving female nurses or paramedics in the region over the last year. Our man might not have started out this bold. He may have been practicing, hiding his work inside tragedies.\u201d The analyst scurried away, and Galt turned back to the whiteboard. She took a black marker and, underneath Janine O\u2019Dell\u2019s name, she wrote SHARON DELANEY, underlining it twice. The list had begun.The morning light that filtered through the high, grimy window of the basement was weak and grey, doing little to dilute the oppressive gloom. Rob was not a creature of the day. The sun was an accusation, a bright, stupid eye that saw too much. He preferred the world muted, wrapped in shadow and fog, where he could move without being noticed. He sat on the edge of the stained mattress, lacing up a pair of heavy, steel-toed work boots, the thick leather scarred and scuffed. The footprint in the alley. He was not a fool. He knew enough to be careful, but the damp earth had been a treachery he hadn't anticipated. It was a minor irritation, a loose thread in an otherwise perfect tapestry. He would simply have to be more vigilant.\n\nThe hum of the freezer was a familiar bass line, but it was punctuated now by a new sound: the sputtering cough of the small gasoline generator he kept in the far corner, tucked behind a stack of yellowed newspapers. It was his greatest vulnerability. The machine required fuel, and fuel required trips to the outside world, interactions with pimply-faced clerks who asked if you wanted to buy a lottery ticket. Every trip was a risk, a brief, unwanted immersion in the world he so thoroughly despised. He checked the fuel level, the fumes catching in his throat. He had enough for another day. Enough to keep the choir singing. He ran his hand over the top of the freezer, a gesture that was almost tender. His collection was safe. His memories were preserved. That was all that mattered.\n\nHe ascended the creaking wooden stairs that led up to a heavy, padlocked door at the back of a derelict laundromat. The business had been closed for years, a husk of forgotten chores and soap-scummed linoleum. He was the building\u2019s unofficial, unknown caretaker. He slipped out a side door into a weed-choked alley, pulling the collar of his worn canvas jacket up against the morning chill. The salt on the air was sharp today, an abrasive scrub against his senses. He began his walk, a steady, loping gait that ate up the pavement. His destination was the place he hated most, the place that was both his hunting ground and the very font of his revulsion. The Queen Elizabeth Hospital. He was a porter there. A ghost in green scrubs, pushing laundry carts and biohazard bins, utterly invisible. It was the perfect vantage point. He was a wolf paid to guard the sheep, and he saw everything.\n\n* * *\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a match.\u201d Sergeant Miller\u2019s voice cut through the early morning hush of the briefing room. He dropped a thick file marked MONCTON R.C.M.P. onto the central table. The sound was unnervingly loud. Isolde Galt, who had been staring at the two names on the whiteboard for the better part of an hour, turned, her eyes sharp. She had not slept. She had showered and changed, but the scent of blood and peppermint tea seemed to have permanently embedded itself in her memory.\n\n\u201cTell me,\u201d she said.\n\nMiller opened the file, his finger tracing a line in the report. \u201cSharon Delaney. LPN. Her colleagues described her as meticulous. She was working a double and was exhausted. They thought she might have just walked away, burnout. But her sister insisted she would never leave without her medical kit. It was a graduation gift from her parents. She took it everywhere.\u201d He flipped a page to a supplemental report. \u201cA junior officer canvassed the local pawn shops a week after she disappeared. Found the kit. Some junkie had sold it for twenty bucks. Most of the contents were there, but one item was noted as missing.\u201d Miller looked up at Galt, his expression grim. \u201cA number three scalpel handle with a fresh number ten blade.\u201d\n\nThe room was silent. It was the confirmation they dreaded and expected. The scalpel. The precision tool for the trophy. Janine O\u2019Dell had not been the first. She was just the latest entry in a ledger written in blood. Galt felt a grim satisfaction warring with the horror. Her instincts had been right. This wasn't a single act; it was a campaign. A long, patient war against a specific type of person.\n\n\u201cHe took Delaney\u2019s scalpel and used it to kill O\u2019Dell,\u201d Galt mused, her mind racing, connecting the points. \u201cHe\u2019s a scavenger. He takes trophies, but he takes tools, too. He\u2019s building his kit as he goes.\u201d She turned back to the board and uncapped her marker. She drew a line connecting the two names, and next to it, she wrote \u2018SCALPEL\u2019. The word looked obscene next to the names of the dead. \u201cThe lab report on the footprint?\u201d\n\n\u201cSize thirteen work boot, as suspected,\u201d Miller confirmed. \u201cCommon brand, could be from any hardware store on the island. But it\u2019s a starting point. We\u2019re pulling sales records for the last year. It\u2019s a mountain of data, but it\u2019s something.\u201d He hesitated. \u201cThere\u2019s more, ma\u2019am. From that wider search you requested. Four months ago. A paramedic in Summerside. Brenda Akerley. Drove her car off a pier on a foggy night. Ruled an accident. She was on her way home after a forty-eight-hour shift. The divers recovered the car, but the driver\u2019s side door was torn almost clean off its hinges. The M.E. at the time flagged it as anomalous but couldn\u2019t explain it. Attributed it to the force of the impact and the water pressure.\u201d\n\nGalt felt a leaden weight settle in her stomach. \u201cHer body?\u201d\n\nMiller swallowed. \u201cMostly recovered. The crabs had gotten to her. But the autopsy report is\u2026 vague on certain details. Given the state of decomposition and the marine life, the pathologist couldn\u2019t be certain about the cause of death beyond drowning. But he did note that the hyoid bone was missing. He chalked it up to predation.\u201d\n\nGalt closed her eyes. The tongue. The base of it attaches to the hyoid bone. A careful excision, a 'masterpiece of butchery' as Ben Carter had called it, would take the bone with it. This wasn\u2019t predation by crabs. It was predation by a monster. She opened her eyes and walked to the board. She wrote BRENDA AKERLEY underneath the other two names. The list was growing. He hadn't just become visible. He had been hiding his work in plain sight, using the chaos of accidents to mask his terrible signature. He was getting bolder. The ritual was the same, but now he was leaving the bodies as monuments to his hatred.\n\n\u201cGet me that full autopsy report from Summerside,\u201d she commanded. \u201cAnd issue a bulletin to all healthcare facilities on the island. Not public, internal. Advise staff to be aware of their surroundings, to walk in groups, to report any unusual behaviour. Emphasize security around staff entrances and parking lots. We can\u2019t tell them what we\u2019re looking for, not yet. The panic would be uncontainable. But we have to warn them. The flock needs to know there\u2019s a wolf inside the fence.\u201d She looked at the names on the board, no longer just case files but a gathering of silent ghosts. \"He's hunting them, Frank. One by one.\"### Chapter 2\n\nThe Queen Elizabeth Hospital was a labyrinth of echoing corridors and coded chimes, and Rob knew its secret passages better than the doctors who walked its halls with such unearned authority. He was a creature of the hospital\u2019s underbelly, a silent ferryman of its filth and refuse. Dressed in the anonymous green scrubs of a porter, he was functionally invisible, a large, shambling shape pushing a cart of soiled linens or a red bin of biohazardous waste. The invisibility was a cloak he wore with pride. It allowed him to watch.\n\nHe hated the sound of the place\u2014the insistent beeping of a thousand machines keeping the dying alive for one more miserable day, the forced cheerfulness in the voices that crackled from the overhead intercom, the pathetic, wet sound of weeping from behind closed doors. Most of all, he hated the nurses. He saw the way they moved, a blur of pastel scrubs and sensible shoes. He watched them dispense pills in tiny paper cups and adjust pillows with hands that were meant to look gentle. He saw the performance in it, the rehearsed compassion. They were actresses in a long, tedious play about healing, and he was the only one in the audience who knew it was all a lie.\n\nHis cart rumbled quietly over the polished linoleum. He kept his head down, his gaze fixed on the floor a few feet in front of him, a posture of subservience that no one ever questioned. From beneath the brim of his imagined cap, his eyes flickered, taking in everything. A nurse at the far end of the hall, leaning against a counter, laughing with a young doctor. The sound was like grinding glass in his ears. He memorized the precise shade of her strawberry-blonde hair, the way she absently twisted a silver ring on her finger. A detail. Another piece of kindling for the cold fire inside him. He passed a room where another nurse, young and dark-haired, was patiently explaining a procedure to an elderly woman, her voice a soft, condescending murmur. Rob\u2019s hand tightened on the handle of his cart, the knuckles of his long fingers turning white. *Are you comfortable? Is the pain manageable?* The lies were a poison, and he was the only antidote.\n\n\u201cThe Summerside M.E. confirms it,\u201d Dr. Ben Carter said, sliding a folder across the briefing room table towards Galt. His face, usually a mask of professional detachment, was tight with a grim fascination. \u201cBrenda Akerley\u2019s autopsy was a mess, but the initial report was thorough. The pathologist noted the absence of the tongue and the hyoid bone but, as we know, attributed it to marine scavengers. Looking at his photos with what we now know about Janine O\u2019Dell, it\u2019s not scavenging. It\u2019s excision. The tissue margins around the base of the tongue, what\u2019s left of them, are too clean. The damage to the mandible is\u2026 well, it looks like someone used a pry bar.\u201d\n\n\u201cOr just his hands,\u201d Miller added quietly from his corner of the room. He looked as if he hadn't slept, his uniform rumpled, his face a landscape of fatigue.\n\nGalt stared at the photo of Brenda Akerley that was now pinned to the board. Three women. A paramedic, an LPN, a registered nurse. Summerside, Moncton, Charlottetown. A deadly triangle spreading across the Maritimes. \u201cHe\u2019s escalating,\u201d she said, her voice a low thrum that matched the intensity in her eyes. \u201cFrom hiding his work inside an accident to staging a disappearance to\u2026 this.\u201d She gestured towards Janine O\u2019Dell\u2019s file. \u201cA public declaration. He left her for us to find. He\u2019s getting more confident. More arrogant.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe work boot lead is a swamp,\u201d Miller reported, rubbing his eyes. \u201cWe\u2019ve pulled sales records from every major retailer on the island. Over five thousand pairs of that brand and size sold in the last two years. We\u2019re trying to cross-reference it with hospital employees, delivery drivers, anyone with a reason to be at these locations, but it\u2019s a mammoth task.\u201d\n\n\u201cKeep digging,\u201d Galt ordered, though she knew it was a long shot. The killer was careful. He wouldn\u2019t be so easily caught. \u201cWhat about the bulletin? What\u2019s the response?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat you\u2019d expect,\u201d Miller sighed. \u201cQuiet panic. The hospital administrators are cooperating, reviewing security protocols. The staff\u2026 they\u2019re scared. A few calls have come in, but it\u2019s all been benign. A janitor who seemed \u2018shifty,\u2019 a patient\u2019s cousin who was \u2018staring.\u2019 People are seeing ghosts in every shadow.\u201d\n\nGalt nodded, unsurprised. Fear was a blunt instrument. It rarely pointed in the right direction. She turned back to the board, her gaze drifting over the three smiling faces. The tools, the locations, the methods\u2014those were the \u2018what\u2019 and the \u2018how\u2019. But they were just branches. She needed the root. \u201cThis isn't random violence, Frank. This is personal. This level of hatred has a source. He feels wronged by them, specifically. For a \u2018mercy he had never been shown.\u2019\u201d She was quoting her own theory, speaking it aloud to give it weight. \u201cI want a new search. Not missing persons. I want to look at the hospitals themselves. Pull records for the last two decades from the QEH, Moncton General, and Summerside\u2019s Prince County Hospital. I want every formal complaint, every lawsuit, every incident report involving a male patient or the male family member of a patient who died under a female nurse\u2019s care.\u201d\n\nMiller\u2019s pen froze over his notepad. \u201cMa\u2019am, that\u2019s\u2026 that\u2019s not just a mountain of data. That\u2019s an entire mountain range. We\u2019d need a team of paralegals and a court order just to get started.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen get a court order,\u201d Galt said, her tone leaving no room for argument. \u201cThe answer isn\u2019t on the street. It\u2019s buried in a file somewhere. In a piece of paper that details the moment this man\u2019s hatred was born. Find that moment.\u201d\n\nThe break room at the QEH buzzed with a nervous energy that coffee couldn\u2019t fix. The official-looking memo pinned to the bulletin board was vague\u2014\"an ongoing police matter,\" \"exercise increased vigilance\"\u2014but the whispers filled in the blanks. Everyone knew Janine O\u2019Dell. Everyone had heard the rumours about how she was found. Fear, thick and cloying as cheap air freshener, hung in the air.\n\n\u201cThey say it was someone she knew,\u201d a surgical nurse whispered, twisting a paper cup in her hands.\n\n\u201cI heard there was no forced entry,\u201d another added. \u201cHe just\u2026 walked in.\u201d\n\nElodie Michaud, a young RN only six months out of school, listened with a growing sense of unease. She was pragmatic, not one to indulge in gossip, but the fear was contagious. She tried to focus on the chart in her lap, but her mind kept drifting. Her gaze went to the hallway, where one of the porters was passing, pushing a large grey bin. He was a big man, broad and tall, with a strange, loping walk. He always kept his head down, and she\u2019d never heard him speak a single word, not even a grunt of acknowledgement. She\u2019d tried to say hello to him once, a few weeks ago, and he had looked right through her, his eyes like two black stones.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just so creepy,\u201d she said, more to herself than to anyone else. \u201cYou just never know who you\u2019re working with.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho, old Grumpy?\u201d another nurse chuckled, following her gaze. \u201cThe porter? Yeah, he\u2019s a weird one. Been here for ages. Harmless, though. Just one of those people who hates the world.\u201d\n\nElodie watched as he turned a corner and disappeared from view. Harmless. Maybe. But there was a stillness about him, a coiled tension that was different from simple bad temper. It was an absence of something, a void where normal human interaction should be. She shook her head, dismissing the thought as a product of the day\u2019s paranoia. It was easier to believe that he was just a miserable man in a miserable job. It was much, much harder to consider what else he might be.### Chapter 3\n\nHe had been seen. The thought did not produce panic\u2014panic was a useless, messy emotion\u2014but a cold, clarifying alertness. As he pushed his cart of soiled linens down the long, sterile corridor, he replayed the moment. The young nurse, the new one, Michaud. Her gaze had not simply slid off him as most did. It had lingered for a second too long, snagged on the anomaly of his presence. She had not seen a porter; she had seen a man. It was a distinction he could not afford. He knew her name, of course. He knew all their names. He was a meticulous student. Elodie Michaud. Six months on the ward, diligent, quick, still possessing that infuriating earnestness of the newly anointed, the belief that she was actually making a difference.\n\nHis invisibility was his most crucial tool, more vital than Brenda\u2019s scalpel or the strength in his hands. It allowed him to move through their world, this temple of false hope, as a janissary of its secrets. He saw the shortcuts they took, heard the unprofessional gossip they shared, noted the exhaustion that frayed the edges of their compassion. Now, a single pair of eyes had threatened to pierce that cloak. He continued his rounds, his movements unchanged, his head still bowed in that perfect pantomime of weary servitude. But his attention had a new, sharp focus. He began to watch Elodie Michaud, not as part of the general flock he loathed, but as an individual problem to be assessed. He noted the way she chewed on her pen while charting, the way she always refilled the water pitcher for Mrs. Henderson in room 214 without being asked, the little hum of an old folk song she murmured when she thought no one was listening. Another singer. Another song he could imagine silencing.\n\nThe first wave of hospital data crashed into the Charlottetown police station like a tidal wave of paper and bureaucratic red tape. Miller stood before Galt\u2019s desk, a veritable mountain of binders and accordion files threatening to spill from his arms. \u201cWe got the warrants,\u201d he said, his voice laced with the weariness of a man fighting a war on two fronts: one against a monster and the other against hospital administration. \u201cQEH legal fought us every step of the way, citing privacy. We\u2019ve started with them, going back twenty years. It\u2019s\u2026 a lot, ma\u2019am. Complaints, incident reports, wrongful death suits. Thousands of pages. We\u2019ve got three temps just scanning and digitizing, but it\u2019s going to take weeks to create a searchable database.\u201d\n\nIsolde Galt looked at the mountain of paper, undaunted. The answer was in there. The first tremor of the earthquake to come. She knew it with a certainty that defied the sheer statistical improbability of finding it. \u201cFocus the search terms,\u201d she instructed, her voice calm and clear amidst the paper chaos. \u201cWe\u2019re not just looking for a death. We\u2019re looking for a specific narrative. A male patient or close male relative. A grievance centered on perceived neglect or unnecessary suffering. And the primary caregiver in the complaint must be a female nurse. Look for words like \u2018pain,\u2019 \u2018ignored,\u2019 \u2018suffering,\u2019 \u2018begged,\u2019 \u2018mercy.\u2019\u201d She was sketching the outline of the killer\u2019s memory, the foundational trauma that had metastasized into this campaign of butchery.\n\nLater that day, Galt found herself back at the community garden. The sharp, antiseptic smells of the police station had been replaced by the rich perfume of damp earth and late-blooming marigolds. The setting sun cast long shadows, striping the neat garden beds with gold and black. One of the teenagers from her first day, a quiet girl named Maya, was carefully watering a row of fledgling spinach. \u201cYou have to do it at the base,\u201d Galt found herself saying, her voice softer than it had been all day. \u201cDon\u2019t wash the soil off the leaves.\u201d For a few minutes, she lost herself in the simple, honest work of cultivation. Here, things grew. They reached for the light. It was the antithesis of her current world, which was consumed by decay and darkness, by a man who harvested life instead of nurturing it. But even here, she couldn\u2019t escape. Looking at the neat rows, she thought of the terrible neatness of the freezer, the stacked and labelled pouches. A perversion of order. A garden of death.\n\nThe quiet on the ward after 10 p.m. was a special kind of silence, thin and fragile, easily broken by a cough or a monitor\u2019s alarm. Elodie Michaud moved through it on soft-soled shoes, completing her final chartings. The nervous buzz from the morning had faded, replaced by the dull ache of a twelve-hour shift. She wanted nothing more than to go home, lock her door, and fall into bed. Her path to the exit took her past the entrance to the staff locker room. The light was off, but the door was propped open by a rubber wedge, a common practice for the late-night cleaning crew. She pushed it open, her mind already on the drive home. And then she froze.\n\nHe was there. In the far corner of the long, narrow room, half-hidden in the deep shadows between the metal lockers and the large, red biohazard bins. The porter. He wasn\u2019t moving, wasn\u2019t cleaning. He was just standing, a tall, hulking silhouette, perfectly still. The air grew thick and cold. Her heart hammered against her ribs, a frantic bird in a cage. This was wrong. There was no reason for him to be in here, and certainly not like this, waiting in the dark like a statue. As if sensing her presence, his head turned, a slow, deliberate motion. His face was a pale mask in the gloom, but she could feel his eyes on her, two points of absolute darkness. He didn\u2019t speak. He didn\u2019t move another inch. The silence stretched, becoming a physical pressure. It was a hunter\u2019s silence, a predator\u2019s stillness. After a moment that felt like an eternity, he turned his head away, grabbed the handle of a bin, and wheeled it out a rear service exit with his strange, loping gait, the quiet rumble of the wheels fading down the service corridor.\n\nElodie didn\u2019t realize she\u2019d been holding her breath until it came out in a ragged, shuddering gasp. She backed out of the locker room, not bothering to retrieve her things. The casual explanation from her colleague\u2014*harmless, just hates the world*\u2014evaporated in a flash of pure, instinctual terror. It wasn\u2019t the world he hated. It was something far more specific. She fumbled for her phone as she hurried down the main hall, her footsteps echoing far too loudly in the empty space. She didn\u2019t know who to call or what to say. How do you report a look? How do you describe a silence that felt like a threat?\n\nIt was after midnight when the junior analyst, eyes blurry from staring at a screen for ten hours straight, flagged a file. It was old, from fifteen years ago, buried in the QEH\u2019s archived complaints. The analyst printed it and, with a trembling hand, carried it to Detective Inspector Galt, who was still at her desk, staring at the three smiling photos on the whiteboard. Galt took the sheet. It was a formal grievance filed by a Mr. Robert Garris, concerning the end-of-life care of his mother, who had died of metastatic bone cancer. The complaint was rambling, filled with vitriol and grief, accusing the nurse on duty of being callous, of ignoring his mother\u2019s agonized pleas for more morphine in her final hours. He wrote that the nurse had smiled, a \u201cpitiless plastic smile,\u201d and told him that the dosage was fixed, that they had to manage the pain, not chase it. He accused her of letting his mother suffer.\n\nGalt\u2019s eyes scanned the document, her focus narrowing to a single, crucial line. The name of the nurse who had signed the chart, the target of all that fifteen-year-old rage. Her blood ran cold. She walked to the evidence table, where the preliminary list of items from the killer\u2019s basement was being catalogued for the file. The list was still fragmented, based on the spidery script from the freezer bags, names without context. Galt stared at the name on the complaint form, then back at the list in her head. A perfect, chilling match. It was more than a lead; it was a genesis. The name of the nurse who had shown him a mercy he had deemed insufficient. The name of one of his first trophies. Mary-Anne.### Chapter 3\n\nHe had been seen. The thought did not produce panic\u2014panic was a useless, messy emotion\u2014but a cold, clarifying alertness.

She didn\u2019t know who to call or what to say. How do you report a look? How do you describe a silence that felt like a threat? She reached the brightly lit main entrance and all but ran to her car, the feeling of his eyes on her back all the way.\n\n* * *\n\nIt was after midnight when the junior analyst, eyes blurry from staring at a screen for ten hours straight, flagged a file. It was old, from fifteen years ago, buried in the QEH\u2019s archived complaints. The analyst printed it and, with a trembling hand, carried it to Detective Inspector Galt, who was still at her desk, staring at the three smiling photos on the whiteboard.\n\nGalt took the sheet. It was a formal grievance filed by a Mr. Robert Garris, concerning the end-of-life care of his mother, who had died of metastatic bone cancer. The complaint was a rambling screed of vitriol and grief, accusing the nurse on duty of being callous, of ignoring his mother\u2019s agonized pleas for more morphine in her final hours. He wrote that the nurse had smiled, a \u201cpitiless plastic smile,\u201d and told him that the dosage was fixed, that they had to manage the pain, not chase it. He accused her of letting his mother suffer, of being an angel of a false and inadequate mercy.\n\nGalt\u2019s blood ran cold as her eyes scanned the document, her focus narrowing to a single, crucial line. The name of the nurse who had signed the chart, the target of all that fifteen-year-old rage. She walked over to the whiteboard where Miller had tacked up a preliminary list of names transcribed from the freezer bags, names that were still just ghosts without stories attached. Her finger traced down the list. *Brenda. Sharon.* And there it was. *Mary-Anne. 11/09.* The date was from years ago, long before the recent spree. Galt stared at the complaint form and then at the board. It was more than a lead; it was a genesis. They had found the first wound, the one that had festered for a decade and a half before poisoning the world. And they had the name of the man who carried it.\n\n\u201cMiller,\u201d she said, her voice a low, dangerous command that cut through the tired hum of the station. \u201cGet me everything you can find on a Robert Garris. Right now.\u201d\n\nFrank Miller, fueled by stale coffee and adrenaline, moved with a speed that belied his exhaustion. The name was a key, and they threw it at every lock they had. Criminal records, credit history, vehicle registration, property deeds. For forty-five minutes, the name Robert Garris was a ghost. No criminal record. No current driver\u2019s license. No property in his name. It was as if he\u2019d fallen off the face of the earth after filing that complaint fifteen years ago.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s living off the grid,\u201d Miller said, frustration etching new lines on his face. \u201cPaying cash, staying in the shadows. He\u2019s been practicing this for years.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo one is a ghost, Frank,\u201d Galt insisted, pacing in front of the whiteboard. \u201cHe has to eat. He has to sleep. He has to work. Check government records. Employment insurance, tax rolls, social assistance. Go back fifteen years.\u201d\n\nIt was another twenty minutes before the hit came, so mundane and so shocking it left them all breathless. The analyst who found it just pointed at her screen, her mouth agape. Miller leaned over her shoulder, read it, and then looked at Galt, his face ashen.\n\n\u201cMa\u2019am,\u201d he said, his voice barely a whisper. \u201cRobert Garris has been on the payroll of the Queen Elizabeth Hospital for the last twelve years. He\u2019s a full-time porter.\u201d\n\nThe air in the room seemed to crystallize. The wolf was not just in the flock. He was being paid to walk among them, to push his carts through their halls, to breathe their air. He had been there all along, hiding in the one place they were trying to protect. Galt\u2019s mind flashed to the hospital bulletin, the warnings for staff to be vigilant. It was a mockery. They\u2019d been warned to watch the windows while the monster was already inside, mopping the floors.\n\nHer phone rang, a shrill, piercing sound that made them all jump. It was the station\u2019s front desk. \u201cDI Galt, there\u2019s a nurse on line one for you. An Elodie Michaud. Says she works at the QEH. She sounds\u2026 distressed. Says she needs to report something, but she\u2019s afraid she\u2019s just being paranoid.\u201d\n\nGalt grabbed the receiver, a terrible, cold certainty closing around her heart. \u201cPut her through,\u201d she said, her eyes meeting Miller\u2019s across the room. The hunt had just become a race.### Chapter 4\n\n\"DI Galt?\" The voice on the other end of the line was thin, stretched taut with a fear so profound it was almost silent. \"This is Elodie Michaud. I'm a nurse at the QEH. I... I know this sounds crazy, but I think I need to report something.\"\n\nIsolde Galt\u2019s entire body went on high alert, a hunter sensing its quarry just beyond the next rise. Every nerve ending seemed to hum with a terrible, vibrant energy. \"You're not crazy, Elodie,\" she said, her voice a lifeline of pure calm in a sea of static. \"I need you to talk to me. Tell me exactly what happened.\"\n\nElodie\u2019s words came out in a rush, a torrent of fear held back until this very moment. She described the locker room, the darkness, the hulking shape of the porter standing perfectly still. She tried to explain the look, the weight of his stare, the way the silence had felt not empty, but full of a terrible intent. As she spoke, Galt understood. This was not a report of a crime; it was a distress call from a target. Robert Garris had been evaluating her, assessing the threat she posed, and in that moment of being truly seen, he had marked her as his next project.\n\n\"Elodie, listen to me very carefully,\" Galt said, her tone leaving no room for doubt. \"Where are you right now?\"\n\n\"In my car. In the staff parking lot. I was about to go home.\"\n\n\"Stay in your car. Lock your doors. Do not leave that parking lot. There are officers on their way to you, and they will be there in minutes. They will approach your car. Do not get out until you see my face. Do you understand me?\" The instruction was absolute, a steel command wrapped in a blanket of reassurance. Elodie\u2019s shaky affirmative was all she needed to hear before she hung up, her mind already several steps ahead.\n\nThe briefing room exploded into controlled motion. Galt was the calm centre of the storm, issuing orders with a speed and precision that left no room for error. \"He's at the hospital, or was just minutes ago,\" she announced, her voice cutting through the exhausted quiet. \"Miller, I want a tactical team, silent deployment. Full containment of the QEH, every entrance, every exit, every service tunnel. Get his photo to every officer en route. He's Robert Garris, hospital porter. No sirens, no lights. I want that place sealed before he even knows we're there. Go!\"\n\nMiller was already on his radio, his voice a low, urgent litany of commands as he relayed the information, his professionalism a thin shield against the sheer horror of the situation. The abstract monster on the whiteboard had just become a man in green scrubs, walking the same halls as his next intended victim. The hunt was no longer a matter of sifting through old files; it was a race against a clock that was ticking down towards another unspeakable act of violence.\n\nIn the damp, echoing utility tunnels beneath the hospital, Rob felt the change. The encounter with the nurse, Elodie, was a fracture in the perfect, smooth surface of his world. She had seen him. The thought was a stone dropped into a still, black pond, the ripples spreading out to touch everything. For years, he had been a ghost, a function, a pair of hands pushing a cart. That was his power. Now, that power was compromised. A single person who saw the man instead of the uniform was a liability he could not afford. The loose, patient timeline he maintained for his collection snapped taut. Elodie Michaud was no longer a name on a potential list for some future date. She had become an immediate and urgent problem that required a permanent solution. He knew her schedule, he knew her car\u2014a small blue hatchback with a faded environmental sticker on the bumper. He had already traced her route home one evening last week, a preliminary survey for a project he\u2019d been considering. The details were important. They were seasoning. He had what he needed. His shift was over. It was time to go hunting.\n\nThe drive to the hospital was a blur of red lights that Galt barely registered. She was on the phone with Miller, who was coordinating the deployment from his own vehicle. \"We've got his old address from the complaint fifteen years ago,\" Miller said, his voice crackling with road noise. \"A derelict property on Weymouth Street, zoned commercial. Looks like an abandoned laundromat. I'm taking a secondary team to check it out. It could be his nest. You take the primary tactical team at the hospital.\"\n\n\"Agreed,\" Galt said, her hands tight on the wheel. \"Find his home, Frank. Find the proof.\" The thought of what that 'proof' might entail, the physical reality of the freezer and its contents, was a cold knot of dread in her gut. She pulled into a service lane behind the hospital, killing her headlights. Unmarked cars were already stationed at strategic points, and she could see the dark shapes of tactical officers melting into the shadows of the building. The hospital, usually a beacon of light, now looked like a fortress under silent siege.\n\nInside a cramped security office, the tactical team lead had the hospital blueprints spread across a desk. \"This place is a nightmare, Inspector,\" he said, his finger tracing the labyrinth of corridors. \"It's designed for public access, but it's full of service tunnels, old storage rooms, restricted areas. We can lock it down, but finding one man who knows it like the back of his hand is like finding a needle in a haystack made of needles.\"\n\n\"He's a porter,\" Galt stated, her eyes scanning the blueprints, seeing not just a map but a hunting ground. \"He operates in the filth, in the places no one wants to go. Laundry, bio-waste disposal, the sub-level maintenance tunnels. Have security pull his access card records for the last three hours. I want to know every door he's opened.\" Her gaze was drawn to the complex network of lines indicating the basement levels. The hospital had a subterranean world all its own, a place for secrets and forgotten things. \"That's where we'll find him. In the dark.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Sergeant Miller\u2019s team arrived at the address on Weymouth Street. The building was a carcass, a long-dead laundromat with boarded-up windows and peeling paint. It looked forgotten, but Miller saw the subtle signs of life. A new, heavy-duty padlock on a side service door, too robust for a derelict property. They cut through it with bolt cutters, the snap of the metal unnervingly loud in the night air. The interior smelled of dust, decay, and damp concrete. Footprints were visible in the grime, leading to a heavy door at the back of the building. It was padlocked from the outside. They breached it, their weapons raised as they descended a set of rickety wooden stairs into absolute darkness. Their flashlights sliced through the gloom, revealing a subterranean world. A stained mattress in the corner. Stacks of stolen medical textbooks. A wobbly card table with a hot plate. And in the far corner, a large, white chest freezer. It was humming. The low, guttural thrum vibrated through the concrete floor, a sound of preservation. A sound of abomination. Miller felt a wave of nausea, a sickness so profound it was almost spiritual. He knew, with chilling certainty, that he had found the monster\u2019s cathedral.The first thing Miller noticed was the smell. Not the overt scent of decay, which the cold contained, but something older. The smell of frost, stale meat, and a profound, lingering wrongness that seemed to seep from the concrete itself. He drew his weapon, the click of the safety seeming obscenely loud in the humming silence. A junior officer behind him gagged, turning away. Miller\u2019s gaze was fixed on the freezer. It was the altar in this subterranean church of horrors. He nodded to another officer, who approached it slowly, as if it were a bomb. With a deep breath and a grunt of effort, the officer lifted the heavy lid.\n\nA thick cloud of frigid air billowed out, carrying with it the full, undeniable truth. Inside, stacked with a disturbing, librarian\u2019s neatness, were dozens of small, vacuum-sealed plastic bags. They were opaque with frost, but their contents were unmistakable. Each was labelled with his spidery, cramped script. Miller could read the names on the top layer, names that were now seared into his memory. *Brenda. 14/08. Sharon. 29/08. Mary-Anne. 11/09. Cynthia. 23/09.* And there, on the very top, still separate and colder than the rest, was the small, hard packet from his most recent harvest. Janine O\u2019Dell. He had not had time to properly label and file her. Miller felt a hot, acidic bile rise in his throat. He keyed his radio, his voice strained, a wire pulled to its breaking point. \u201cInspector\u2026 you need to hear this. We found it. We\u2019re in his lair. We\u2019ve found the collection.\u201d\n\nGalt\u2019s sedan slid into the designated spot at the edge of the QEH staff parking lot. The vast expanse of asphalt was a grid of light and shadow, a perfect playing field for a predator. She spotted Elodie\u2019s blue hatchback three rows in. Flanked by two tactical officers who materialized from the darkness, she moved quickly and silently. She tapped on the driver\u2019s side window, holding up her badge. The locks clicked and the door swung open. Elodie Michaud looked out, her face a pale, tear-streaked mask in the dim interior light. Her terror was a living thing in the small car.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Elodie. You\u2019re safe now,\u201d Galt said, her voice a low, steady anchor. She slid into the passenger seat, the two officers taking up positions outside the car, their attention fixed on the surrounding darkness. \u201cTell me again. Everything.\u201d Elodie recounted the story, her voice trembling but clear, the trained mind of a nurse reciting symptoms. She focused on the stillness, the unnerving quiet of the man in the dark. As she spoke, Galt\u2019s radio crackled to life. It was Miller\u2019s choked voice, delivering the news from the monster\u2019s cathedral. *\u201cWe found it\u2026 We\u2019ve found the collection.\u201d* The words landed like body blows. The full, monstrous scope of his crusade was confirmed, stacked and frozen in a concrete basement.\n\nAt the far edge of the parking lot, concealed by a thicket of untrimmed cedar trees that bordered an adjacent property, Rob watched. He had seen the first unmarked car slide into place and had instantly understood. His hunt was over before it began. They knew. The nurse had talked. His cloak of invisibility had been torn away completely. He watched as Galt\u2019s car arrived, watched the officers materialize, watched the woman with the authoritative stride get into the car with Elodie. He was not a fool to be trapped in a burning building. He had already slipped out a rear service door the moment he felt the shift in the hospital\u2019s atmosphere. But now he was here, and she was there. Trapped. He could run, disappear into the night, find another island, another hospital, another collection. Or, he could finish the job. He looked at the woman in the car with the nurse, the one clearly in charge, the one who had hunted him down. His hatred, usually a slow-burning coal, roared into a furnace. It was not just about the nurses anymore. It was about anyone who stood with them. His eyes scanned the edge of the lot, and he saw it. A large, grey utility box. The main power junction for the parking area lighting. A new plan, born of rage and opportunity, bloomed in the darkness of his mind.\n\nGalt was processing Miller\u2019s words, a cold dread washing over her, when it happened. With a loud, metallic *clank* that echoed across the asphalt, the entire parking lot was plunged into absolute, disorienting blackness. The tall sodium lamps went out in a single, dying hum. Shouts erupted from the tactical officers, their world suddenly reduced to what their flashlights could pierce. The interior of the car became a claustrophobic box, the windows reflecting only their own startled faces in the dim emergency light of Galt\u2019s radio.\n\nBefore anyone could react to the new threat, a thunderous crash came from directly above them. Not a gunshot, but a massive, concussive impact on the roof of the small hatchback, making the entire frame groan. Elodie screamed, a raw, piercing sound of pure terror. Galt drew her sidearm, her flashlight beam dancing wildly, trying to penetrate the oppressive dark outside the car. Then came a new sound, a sound of grotesque strength and horrifying intent. The screech of tortured metal. She looked at her door, where the top of the window frame was beginning to bend inwards, pulled by an impossible force. Long, three-jointed fingers, thick and powerful as steel hooks, curled over the buckling frame, the nails yellow as old horn. Robert Garris hadn\u2019t gone for the nurse. He was on the roof of the car, tearing his way in, and he was coming for the detective.### Chapter 5\n\nThere was no time for thought, only for instinct honed by years of walking toward violence, not away from it. The shriek of tearing metal was the sound of the world ending, a sound punctuated by Elodie\u2019s raw, animal screams beside her. Galt shoved the younger woman\u2019s head down toward the floor mat with a force that was almost a blow. \u201cStay down!\u201d she roared, the command a guttural blast of authority in the claustrophobic space. Her own weapon was up, a steady point of purpose in the chaos, but she had no shot. The roof was caving in, the windshield was fracturing into a thousand spidery cracks, and the monstrous fingers curling over the window frame were a promise of what was to come. He was peeling the car open like a can.\n\nThe blackness outside the car was absolute for a heart-stopping second, and then it was shattered by blades of pure white light. The tactical officers, blind but not helpless, activated their weapon-mounted lights, sweeping the area, trying to find the source of the attack. The beams converged on the small blue hatchback, illuminating a scene from a nightmare. There, crouched on the buckling roof of the car, was Robert Garris. He was no longer the invisible porter, the shuffling, downtrodden man in green scrubs. He was a leviathan revealed. His face was a mask of pure, contorted rage, his thin lips pulled back from his grey gums in a soundless snarl. His immense frame, coiled with a terrifying, brachial strength, was braced as he ripped at the door frame, his eyes, those pits of glittering black obsidian, fixed on Galt inside the car.\n\nGalt didn\u2019t wait for an invitation. She shoved her shoulder against the passenger door, forcing it open against the groaning chassis, and scrambled out into the night, using the car as a shield. She came up into a low crouch at the rear of the vehicle, her pistol held in a two-handed grip, the tactical lights from her team throwing her own long, dancing shadow across the asphalt. She could see him clearly now, a monster bathed in the harsh glare of judgement. He saw her at the same moment. He abandoned his efforts to tear the door off its hinges, his singular focus shifting to the woman who had unearthed him. With a roar that was less human and more the sound of a rockslide, a raw, guttural expression of pure hatred, he launched himself from the roof of the car, not away from the lights, but directly at her.\n\n\"Police! Drop it!\" The words were a formality, a required piece of procedure shouted into the face of an apocalypse. He was a two-hundred-and-fifty-pound projectile of muscle and bone, his long arms reaching for her, his three-jointed fingers spread like talons. Galt stood her ground. Time seemed to slow, the space between them compressing. She fired. The first shot struck him high in the chest, a solid, thudding impact that would have stopped any normal man. It barely broke his stride. He staggered, but his immense forward momentum carried him on. She fired again. And again. The bullets slammed into his torso, each one a hammer blow. He gave a final, shuddering grunt, a sound of surprise and fury, his eyes still locked on hers, full of a hatred that even death could not immediately extinguish. He collapsed less than three feet from her, hitting the pavement with a heavy, final thud that seemed to shake the ground.\n\nAn instant of deafening silence followed the final gunshot, broken only by the high-pitched ringing in Galt\u2019s ears and the terrified, hiccupping sobs coming from inside the car. The parking lot was a tableau, frozen in the stark white beams of the tactical lights. Galt stood over the body, her pistol still aimed at the centre mass of the motionless giant, her breath coming in ragged plumes of white in the cold night air. The tactical team swarmed forward, shouting commands, securing the scene, their professionalism a stark contrast to the primal violence that had just unfolded. Someone gently took Elodie from the car, wrapping her in a blanket, her body shaking uncontrollably.\n\nGalt lowered her weapon, the adrenaline beginning its slow, sickening retreat, leaving a hollow ache in its place. She looked down at Robert Garris. In death, the monstrous rage had drained from his features, leaving behind the face of a large, empty man. A man whose entire existence had been powered by a fifteen-year-old wound and the drone of a basement freezer. The long, rambling sentence of his hatred had finally found its period. From her radio, she could hear the distant, tinny voice of Frank Miller, shouting for a situation report. She raised the radio to her lips, her gaze still on the body at her feet. \"Suspect is down,\" she said, her voice steady, betraying none of the tremor she felt deep in her bones. \"The hum has stopped.\"The world snapped back into sharp, ugly focus. The strobing tactical lights carved the scene into disjointed fragments of action: an officer shouting into a radio, a paramedic rushing toward Elodie, the glint of shattered glass on dark asphalt. Galt\u2019s hands, which had been so steady, began to tremble, a violent, delayed reaction to the adrenaline that had held them rigid. She forced them to still, reloading her weapon with practiced, mechanical movements that belied the tremor in her soul. She looked down at the dead man. The monster who had torn a car apart with his bare hands was gone, replaced by a large, pathetic corpse bleeding out on the pavement. The hatred that had animated him, that had given him his preternatural strength, had vanished, leaving only a hollow, empty vessel.\n\nSergeant Miller\u2019s car skidded to a halt a short time later, its headlights cutting a swathe through the organized chaos. He stumbled out, his face pale and drawn not from the scene before him, but from the one he had just left. He saw the body bag, the mangled car, and then Galt, standing alone near the edge of the police cordon, staring up at the brightly lit windows of the hospital. He walked over to her, the smell of the basement\u2014of frost and old blood\u2014still clinging to his clothes. He didn't need to ask what happened. He had heard the gunshots over the radio.\n\n\u201cIt was\u2026 a museum, ma\u2019am,\u201d he said, his voice raspy. \u201cHe had them all. Labelled. By date.\u201d He didn\u2019t need to say what \u2018them\u2019 were. They both knew. The stolen voices, the punctuation marks in his long sentence of hate. \u201cAll those years, he was just down there, hating and remembering. It\u2019s hard to believe a man can hold that much darkness inside him.\u201d\n\nGalt didn\u2019t turn to look at him. Her gaze remained fixed on the hospital, a place of healing that had harboured a festering sickness for over a decade. \u201cIt isn\u2019t the darkness that\u2019s hard to believe, Frank,\u201d she said, her voice low and weary. \u201cIt\u2019s how long it can go unnoticed. How easily we can walk right past it every single day.\u201d She thought of the community garden, of the rich, dark earth, and how this man had cultivated his own terrible garden in a basement, feeding it with pain instead of water, growing monuments of silence instead of life. The contrast was a physical ache in her chest.\n\nHer eyes found Elodie Michaud, wrapped in a thick blanket, speaking to a counsellor near an ambulance, her small frame still wracked with shudders. The young nurse had survived, but Galt knew that the shadow of this night would follow her for the rest of her life. Galt walked over, her presence cutting through the procedural bubble around the young woman. She knelt, bringing herself to eye level with the traumatized nurse. \u201cHe can\u2019t hurt you anymore,\u201d she said, the words feeling horribly inadequate. \u201cWe will make sure you have everything you need. Whatever it takes, for as long as it takes.\u201d It was a promise made not by a Detective Inspector, but by Isolde Galt, the philanthropist, the woman who believed that the only way to fight the rot was to relentlessly, painstakingly, cultivate the good. It was the only cure she knew.The world snapped back into sharp, ugly focus.

It was the only cure she knew.\n\nAs the first hint of a bruised, purple dawn began to lighten the eastern sky, Galt stood alone after the last ambulance had gone. The crime scene was a sterile field of yellow tape and official vehicles. She had taken a life. It was a clean shoot, justified a dozen times over, but the fact of it settled on her like a shroud. It was the ultimate bandage, a reactive, violent solution to a problem she would have given anything to have cured decades ago, in a quiet hospital room filled with a grieving boy and his dying mother. The work wasn't over. In a basement on Weymouth Street, a freezer full of frozen evidence was waiting. Each packet was a cold case, a ghost waiting for its name to be spoken, its story to be told. The harvest was over, but now, the long, slow work of giving back the stolen voices was about to begin.### Chapter 6\n\nThe sun rose on a city that was, for the most part, completely unaware of the abyss that had opened and closed in its midst. At the Charlottetown police station, the morning shift arrived to the smell of burnt coffee and the hushed, grim atmosphere of a battlefield after the fighting has stopped. The main briefing room, which had been the vibrant nerve centre of a manhunt, now felt like a wake. The whiteboard was a monument, with the names of Brenda, Sharon, and Janine underlined in black, and the name Robert Garris circled and slashed through with a single, vicious red line. Galt stood before it, a fresh mug of coffee in her hand that she had yet to touch. She had been here for hours, a silent sentinel watching the dawn crawl over the city, feeling the weight of the silence that Garris had left in his wake, a silence far more profound than the one he had so violently imposed on his victims.\n\nFrank Miller came in, his face the colour of old parchment, his uniform looking two sizes too big for him. He had spent the last four hours at the morgue, overseeing the transfer of evidence from the derelict laundromat. He didn't look at the whiteboard. He couldn\u2019t. His gaze was fixed on a point somewhere in the middle distance, as if he were still staring into the frigid, humming darkness of that basement freezer. He slumped into a chair at the briefing table, the plastic creaking under his weight. Galt didn\u2019t have to ask. She could see the horror radiating from him in waves.\n\n\u201cThe lab started the initial inventory,\u201d he said, his voice a dead, flat monotone. \u201cThirty-seven, ma\u2019am. Thirty-seven bags. Some of them\u2026 some of them are over a decade old. The dates go all the way back. Mary-Anne was one of the first. He was just getting started. The precision improved over time, the packaging got better. He treated them like\u2026 like biological specimens he was archiving for a study.\u201d He finally looked at Galt, his eyes hollowed out, dark pools of exhaustion and disgust. \u201cHow does a man do that? How does he live like that, with that\u2026 humming in his basement, for all those years, and just go to work every day?\u201d\n\nGalt turned from the board and looked at her sergeant, seeing not just a subordinate but a good man who had been forced to look into the void. \u201cBecause the work was the only thing that made him feel alive, Frank. The hatred was his fuel, and the collection was his proof. Proof that he had power over the one thing he felt had powerless over him: the quiet, smiling mercy of a nurse.\u201d She walked over and sat down opposite him, her voice dropping, becoming a tool to pull him back from the edge. \u201cThey are not specimens. They are not his collection. They are thirty-seven women whose families need to know what happened to them. That is our job now. We are no longer hunting a monster. We are identifying his victims. We\u2019re giving them back their names.\u201d\n\nThe order galvanized the exhausted team. The focus shifted from tactics and pursuit to the painstaking, heartbreaking work of forensic anthropology and cold case investigation. They began the mammoth task of building a timeline, matching the spidery dates on the frosted bags to missing persons reports from across the Maritimes and beyond. Every name\u2014*Cynthia, Heather, Karen, Louise*\u2014was a ghost story waiting for its first and final chapter to be written. Galt coordinated it all, her mind a clear, sharp instrument of logic and process, even as the image of Garris\u2019s face, contorted in a final rictus of rage, flashed behind her eyes every time she blinked. She had taken a life to save others, but the grim arithmetic of her profession did little to quiet the deep, resonant toll of that final, violent act.\n\nHours later, she found herself walking through the neat, cedar-lined paths of the community garden. The sun was high and warm, a stark contrast to the bone-deep chill that had settled in her marrow. The teenagers she had been teaching were there, laughing as they wrestled with a tangled garden hose, their lives blessedly untouched by the darkness she trafficked in. She knelt, her fingers sinking into the rich, dark soil of a raised bed. The earth smelled of life, of possibility, of things growing towards the light. It was the absolute antithesis of the cold, sterile basement on Weymouth Street. She had told her colleagues that philanthropy was proactive policing, a cure instead of a bandage. But she knew now, with a clarity that was both terrible and freeing, that it wasn\u2019t that simple. You could build a thousand gardens, but it wouldn't stop a man like Robert Garris, a man whose soul was a barren, salted field where nothing good could ever grow. You had to nurture the soil, yes. But you also had to be willing to stand on the wall and face the blight that threatened to consume it all.\n\nHer phone buzzed, pulling her from her reverie. It was the young analyst from the station, her voice lacking its usual nervous tremor, replaced now with a quiet, somber professionalism. \u201cInspector? We have one. A positive ID, we think. We ran the DNA from one of the first unidentified bags, a \u2018Cynthia, 23/09,\u2019 against the national database. We got a familial match to a couple in Digby, Nova Scotia. They filed a missing persons report for their daughter, Cynthia Morrell, almost two years ago. The date matches.\u201d Galt listened, her heart a heavy, leaden thing in her chest. Cynthia Morrell. A home care nurse who worked with palliative patients. She had vanished after a late-night house call. Local police had suspected she\u2019d run off, tired of a difficult life and a thankless job. The case had been cold for eighteen months.\n\nA life, sketched out in a few database fields. She was no longer just a name on a bag, a piece of frozen evidence. She was Cynthia Morrell from Digby. A daughter. A caregiver. Another woman whose compassion had made her a target for a man who had none. Galt closed her eyes, picturing the young woman, imagining the little humming sound she might have made as she checked on a patient, a song of life so easily, so brutally silenced. One voice. They had found one. It was a victory that felt exactly like a defeat. It was the first step on a long, hard road of delivering unbearable news to families who had clung to the thinnest slivers of hope. The harvest was over. But the bitter, sorrowful work of counting the dead had just begun.\"Thank you,\" Galt said, her voice quiet, before ending the call. She remained kneeling in the rich, dark earth, the warmth of the sun on her back a stark, almost offensive contrast to the ice-cold dread that had just been confirmed over the phone. Cynthia Morrell. The name hung in the air, a fragile, tragic thing. A home care nurse. A woman who spent her days in the quiet, lonely rooms of the dying, offering a final measure of comfort. She was the very embodiment of the mercy Robert Garris had so despised. The bitter irony was a taste like rust in Galt\u2019s mouth. She looked at the kale seedlings she had planted, their leaves unfurling toward the light, so full of simple, uncomplicated life. This garden was a place of beginnings, but her work now was solely concerned with endings.\n\nBack at the station, the grim machinery of the investigation had already ground into a new gear. The frenetic energy of the hunt was gone, replaced by the somber, methodical hum of processing a mass casualty event. Whiteboards were covered in lists, cross-referencing dates from the freezer bags with a multi-province database of missing women. Each potential match was a deep dive into another family\u2019s private tragedy, a new wound to be re-opened. The air was thick with the quiet, respectful murmurs of officers speaking to other jurisdictions, requesting dental records, DNA samples, and old case files. It was a factory of sorrow, and Isolde Galt was its reluctant forewoman.\n\nShe found Miller in the small station kitchen, staring into a cup of black coffee as if it held the answers to the universe. He looked up as she entered, his eyes bloodshot and ancient. \"They're still taking things out of the basement,\" he said, his voice a gravelly whisper. \"The textbooks... he'd written in the margins. Next to diagrams of the glossopharyngeal nerve, he'd just written the word 'liar' over and over again. And in a section on pain receptors, he'd underlined a passage about chronic suffering and written, 'she smiled.' Just that. 'She smiled.'\" The detail was so small, so intimate, it was more chilling than the mountain of physical evidence. It was a direct look into the heart of his fifteen-year obsession, the single moment that had curdled his grief into a world-ending poison. Miller shook his head slowly. \"He wasn't just killing them, ma'am. He was trying to kill a memory. Thirty-seven times.\"\n\nGalt took the file for Cynthia Morrell and retreated to the quiet of her own office, closing the door on the symphony of grief being assembled outside. The notification was the next step. It was a task usually delegated to officers in the correct jurisdiction, a formal, terrible message to be delivered by strangers. She made the call to the RCMP detachment in Digby, her voice a cool, professional instrument as she relayed the confirmed DNA match and the context of the homicide investigation. She gave them the facts, devoid of the horror, but she could feel the weight of the coming conversation pressing down on her. Somewhere in a small Nova Scotian town, a mother and father who had spent two years cycling between desperate hope and numb resignation were about to have their world irrevocably shattered. She had caught the monster, but her victory was their devastation.\n\nAfter the call, she sat at her desk, the silence of her office a stark contrast to the hum that had defined her thoughts for days. She looked down at her hands. They were smudged with the dark, rich soil of the garden, but beneath the dirt, she could still feel the phantom recoil of her pistol, the grim finality of the trigger pulls. These were the hands that funded youth centres and planted vegetables, and they were the hands that had ended a man's life. The contradiction was the very essence of her existence, the razor's edge she walked every day. She opened a drawer and pulled out a thick binder, its cover simply stamped with the Galt Foundation logo. She flipped through the pages, through proposals for literacy programs, funding requests for addiction counselling, blueprints for a new women's shelter. It was her catechism, her shield against the cynicism that threatened to consume her. She could not undo the horror that Robert Garris had unleashed, and she could not bring back the thirty-seven women he had silenced. All she could do was continue to build, to cultivate, to stubbornly, defiantly, pour life and resources into the very communities that darkness sought to devour. It was not a cure, she knew. It was just an act of faith.The quiet in her office was a physical presence, a heavy blanket that smothered the procedural noise from the bullpen outside. Galt sat motionless, her hand still resting on the phone. The call to Digby was complete, a sterile exchange of information that had set in motion a small, personal apocalypse for the Morrell family. She pictured the two RCMP officers, their car pulling up to a quiet house, the grim set of their jaws as they walked to the door. She imagined the polite knock, the initial confusion on the faces of Cynthia's parents turning to a dawning, uncomprehending terror as the officers spoke the words she herself had put in their mouths. *Remains have been located. Homicide investigation.* The language of the profession was a cold, inadequate shield against the raw, howling grief that would follow. The system was designed to deliver facts, not to absorb pain. The pain was an externality, a byproduct left for the families to manage alone, long after the files were closed.\n\nShe finally rose and walked back out into the main briefing room. The energy had shifted. The initial shock had given way to a grim, focused industry. A team of analysts sat at a bank of computers, their faces illuminated by the blue glow of screens displaying missing persons reports, their quiet keyboard taps a counterpoint to the hushed phone conversations of detectives coordinating with other forces. Frank Miller stood before the whiteboard, which was now covered in a sprawling web of names, dates, and locations. He was pinning up another photograph, a grainy driver\u2019s license photo of a woman with a weary smile. \u201cWe think we have a match for \u2018Karen, 03/12\u2019,\u201d he said, not turning around. \u201cKaren Crosby. Paramedic from Saint John. Disappeared seven years ago. Her car was found abandoned near the Reversing Falls. They assumed it was a suicide.\u201d He finally turned, his eyes finding Galt\u2019s. \u201cHe wrote in her file, too. The one he made. Just a single sentence. \u2018She told me to be brave.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe simple, damning quote hung in the air, a testament to a kindness weaponized by Garris\u2019s broken mind. Galt felt a fresh wave of revulsion, not just for the killer, but for the random, cruel nature of his selections. These women had not been chosen for any malice on their part, but for the very best of what they were. They were punished for their compassion. She looked at the sprawling map of tragedy on the board, at the dozens of names that were still just placeholders, ghosts waiting for their stories. It was not enough to send files and notifications. That was a bureaucrat\u2019s solution. She saw each name not as a case, but as a debt. A debt of dignity. \u201cFrank,\u201d she said, her voice cutting through the room\u2019s somber hum, \u201cI want a lead liaison assigned to each confirmed victim. Not just a call to the local jurisdiction. I want a single point of contact for every family, from now until the end of the judicial process. They will not be passed from department to department. They will have a name and a number here. We will walk them through all of it.\u201d Miller nodded, a flicker of his old, solid self returning to his eyes. It was a Galt solution: methodical, human, and absolute.\n\nThat evening, long after most had gone home, Galt found herself back at the community garden. The air was cool and smelled of damp earth and the promise of autumn\u2019s end. Under the pale light of a solitary streetlamp, the neat rows of sleeping plants looked like a promise kept. She knelt, her fingers brushing the delicate fronds of a carrot top. This place was a quiet rebellion against the chaos. But it wasn\u2019t enough. She thought of the thirty-seven women, all of them healers, all of them silenced for the crime of offering comfort. Their voices were gone, but their purpose, their calling, did not have to die with them. An idea began to form, a plan that was both a memorial and a defiance. It was a project for the Galt Foundation, a perfect fusion of her two worlds. It would be a scholarship fund, endowed in perpetuity. The \u201cThirty-Seven Voices Scholarship,\u201d for nursing and paramedic students across the Maritimes. Their names would be attached not to a gruesome police file, but to the education of a new generation of healers. It would not bring them back. It would not erase the pain. But it would be a cure of a different kind. It would ensure that for every voice Robert Garris had stolen, a new one would be trained to speak words of comfort into the darkness, a quiet, constant, and unending reply to his hateful hum.### Chapter 7\n\nA week had passed. The silence left by Robert Garris\u2019s death was not a peaceful one. It was a vacuum, and into it rushed the noise of bureaucracy, of media speculation, and of a grief so profound and wide-ranging that it had settled over Charlottetown like a permanent, low-hanging fog. The city\u2019s cherished sense of small-town safety had been shattered, replaced by a grim new notoriety. The newspapers had christened him, with their typical ghoulish flair, the \u201cLaundromat Butcher.\u201d His face, a grainy, fifteen-year-old DMV photo, was plastered everywhere, a bland and forgettable visage that made the horror of his actions feel all the more obscene.\n\nIn the police station, the briefing room had been transformed. The \"hunt\" was over, but the work had only intensified. The murder board was now a vast grid of sorrow, thirty-seven columns waiting to be filled. Ten names had been officially identified, their smiling photos a gut-wrenching contrast to the clinical details of their disappearances. Miller was the reluctant master of this domain, a gaunt Cerberus guarding the gates of a paper hell. He moved with a slow, deliberate exhaustion, the horror of the basement having etched itself into the lines around his eyes. He rarely spoke of what he\u2019d seen, but Galt saw it every time he pinned a new photo to the board, his hand lingering for a moment as if in silent apology.\n\nGalt herself moved through the storm on a separate, parallel track. She had sat for her official inquiry, a three-hour debriefing in a sterile room with two stone-faced internal affairs officers. She recounted the events of the parking lot in the flat, precise language of a police report. *\u201cThe suspect initiated a physical assault with lethal intent\u2026 I perceived a clear and present danger to myself and a civilian\u2026 I discharged my firearm until the threat was neutralized.\u201d* Each sanitized phrase was a betrayal of the chaotic, terrifying reality\u2014the shriek of tearing metal, the raw animal roar of the man, the percussive kick of her weapon, the final, heavy thud of his body hitting the asphalt. The inquiry had cleared her in under an hour, a procedural necessity that felt like a profound irrelevance. Neutralizing the threat had been the simple part. The true challenge was navigating the vast, echoing crater his evil had left behind.\n\nHer answer to that challenge took shape in a polished boardroom overlooking the Charlottetown harbour. The trustees of the Galt Foundation, men and women of finance and law accustomed to discussing capital gains and tax-efficient donations, sat in stunned silence as Isolde laid out her proposal. She spoke not as a police inspector, but as the foundation\u2019s chair, her voice devoid of emotion yet vibrating with an unshakeable resolve. She proposed the \u201cThirty-Seven Voices Scholarship,\u201d a permanent endowment to fund the education of nursing and paramedic students across the Maritime provinces.\n\n\u201cHis goal was to silence the voices of caregivers,\u201d she concluded, her gaze sweeping across the table, meeting each of their eyes. \u201cHe failed. This foundation will ensure that for every one voice he took, a dozen more will be amplified. Their names will not be footnotes in a monster\u2019s story. They will be the foundation of a legacy of healing. We will not let his hatred have the last word.\u201d There was no argument. The motion passed unanimously, a quiet, somber consensus in the face of a grief that demanded action.\n\nThat afternoon, Galt drove to Elodie Michaud\u2019s apartment. She found the young nurse surrounded by cardboard boxes, her small living room a chaotic landscape of a life in mid-flight. Elodie was pale, her movements skittish, a deer perpetually sensing a predator that was no longer there. She had quit her job at the QEH. The thought of walking those halls, of seeing the locker room where he had stood watching her from the darkness, was an impossibility.\n\n\u201cI keep hearing it,\u201d Elodie said, her voice a fragile whisper as she hugged a mug of tea to her chest. \u201cThe sound of the metal. The way the roof\u2026 buckled.\u201d She looked at Galt, her eyes wide with a question that had clearly been tormenting her. \u201cWhy did he come after you? He was on the roof, he could have\u2026 but he came for you.\u201d\n\nGalt sat on a sealed box, the makeshift seat bringing her to the younger woman\u2019s level. She chose her words with a surgeon\u2019s care. \u201cBecause his hatred wasn\u2019t just for nurses anymore, Elodie. It had grown. In the end, he hated anyone who stood in his way, anyone who tried to stop him. Most of all, he hated being seen. You were the first person in a long time who truly saw him, and that made him afraid. It made him clumsy. You saved your own life long before I ever got there.\u201d The words were a partial truth, a therapeutic construction designed to give the traumatized woman a sliver of agency in a situation where she\u2019d had none. It seemed to land. A flicker of something other than fear crossed Elodie\u2019s face, a hint of understanding that Galt hoped would one day grow into a scar, rather than an open wound. She stayed for an hour, not talking about the case, but about moving companies and new neighbourhoods, the simple, forward-looking logistics of a life that had to continue.\n\nThe next day, Galt did something far outside the bounds of protocol. She drove to Digby. She found the Morrells\u2019 house without trouble, a neat little bungalow with a carefully tended garden out front, now succumbing to the first frosts of the season. An elderly couple answered the door, their faces a matched set of exhausted grief. They had been expecting a call, perhaps, but not a personal visit from the Detective Inspector from Prince Edward Island. She introduced herself simply, and they invited her in with the weary resignation of people for whom the worst has already happened. They sat in a living room filled with photos of their daughter. Cynthia laughing on a beach. Cynthia in her nursing school graduation cap. Cynthia holding a grumpy-looking cat.\n\nThey didn\u2019t ask for details about how she died. They had been spared the worst of it by the sensitive RCMP liaison. Instead, her mother, a small woman with her daughter\u2019s kind eyes, asked a single, heartbreaking question. \u201cWas she scared?\u201d Galt thought of the scene in the basement, of the detached, clinical way he had handled his \u2018specimens.\u2019 She thought of the scalpel, of his obsession with precision. \u201cThe medical examiner believes it would have been\u2026 very fast,\u201d she lied, the falsehood a small, final mercy she could offer. \u201cI don\u2019t believe she would have been aware for very long.\u201d\n\nIt was then that she told them about the scholarship. She explained that their daughter\u2019s name, along with the others, would be honoured, used to help young people pursue the same calling Cynthia had. For the first time, a flicker of light broke through the suffocating gloom in the room. Cynthia\u2019s father, who had not spoken a word, finally looked at Galt, tears streaming silently down his weathered face. \u201cShe would have liked that,\u201d he rasped. \u201cShe always wanted to help.\u201d Galt left an hour later, carrying the weight of their gratitude and their grief. It was a burden heavier than any case file, more real than any internal inquiry. As she drove back toward the ferry, she knew that this was the work that mattered. Not just catching the killer, but tending to the wounds left in his wake, one quiet conversation, one scholarship, one act of defiant remembrance at a time. The hum of his hatred had been silenced, but the quiet work of answering it would go on for a very long time.A week had passed. The silence left by Robert Garris\u2019s death was not a peaceful one.

The vibrant, garish colours of autumn had long since bled out, and winter had descended upon the island with a quiet, smothering finality. A thick blanket of snow muffled the city, muting sound and burying the world in a clean, white lie of purity. In the Charlottetown station, the manic energy had given way to a persistent, low-grade exhaustion. The case of Robert Garris was no longer a manhunt or even a fresh investigation; it had become a vast, heartbreaking administrative task, a grim accounting of a life\u2019s work devoted to death. The murder board in the briefing room remained, but it was no longer a tool of deduction. It was a memorial. Thirty-four of the thirty-seven columns now had a smiling face and a name. The final three, whose degradation was too severe for a quick DNA match against existing databases, remained stubbornly blank, their files awaiting a more complex genealogical search. They were the last of the ghosts.\n\nIsolde Galt spent most of her days orchestrating this final, sad chapter, but her nights were increasingly devoted to the Galt Foundation. The Thirty-Seven Voices Scholarship had been announced to a wave of national media coverage, a small, bright story of hope emerging from a narrative of pure horror. The first round of applications had flooded in, and Galt found herself reading the essays late into the night in the quiet of her study, the snow falling softly outside her window. They were filled with the earnest, hopeful ambitions of the young, stories of inspiration and a desire to serve. Each one felt like a small act of defiance against the silence that had so nearly consumed her.\n\nShe was reviewing a particularly poignant essay from a young woman in Cape Breton when Sergeant Miller appeared at her office door, knocking softly. He had lost the haunted, hollowed-out look from the initial days after the discovery, but it had been replaced by a deep, settled weariness that seemed to have taken root in his bones. He was holding a file, but he didn\u2019t move to hand it to her. \u201cMa\u2019am,\u201d he began, his voice quiet. \u201cThey\u2019ve identified number thirty-five. A Jane Doe from a highway ditch in New Brunswick sixteen years ago. She was never reported missing. No one was looking for her.\u201d He paused, the simple tragedy of that statement hanging in the air. \u201cI\u2019ve also put in my transfer request. I\u2019m moving to the financial crimes unit. I\u2019ve had my fill of this side of the ledger.\u201d\n\nGalt looked at him, seeing not a subordinate quitting a difficult post, but a good man who understood his own limits. She had seen too many cops like Miller burn out, turning their trauma into a bitter, corrosive cynicism that poisoned everything around them. His decision was not an act of surrender, but one of self-preservation. \u201cI understand, Frank,\u201d she said, her voice soft with a genuine warmth. \u201cThe world will always need people to dig into the darkness. But it also needs people to follow the paper trail. You\u2019ve done more than your share here. More than anyone should ever have to.\u201d He gave her a small, grateful nod, the first flicker of his old self she\u2019d seen in months. He placed the final file on her desk and left, closing the door quietly behind him, leaving Galt alone with the thirty-fifth ghost.\n\nA week later, a thick manila envelope arrived, forwarded from her office. It had a postmark from Vancouver. Inside was a letter, handwritten on crisp, heavy stationery. The penmanship was neat, deliberate. *Dear Inspector Galt,* it began. *I hope this letter finds you well. I\u2019m enrolled now. University of British Columbia. I\u2019ve decided to specialize in psychiatric nursing, with a focus on trauma and PTSD. For a while, after everything, I thought I was broken. I thought all I could ever be was a victim. A survivor. But you said I saved myself that night, and I\u2019ve thought about that a lot. I think what you meant was that I didn\u2019t just lie down and let the darkness take me. So I\u2019m not going to. I\u2019m going to learn how to be the person who sits with people in the dark, the one who helps them find the light switch. Thank you for showing me that was an option. Sincerely, Elodie Michaud.* Galt read the letter twice, a rare, unfamiliar warmth spreading through her chest. It was a receipt for a debt she hadn\u2019t realized she was owed.\n\nThat evening, she sat at her desk at home, a glass of wine untouched beside her, the final batch of scholarship essays before her. She picked up one at random. The applicant was a young man from Saint John, New Brunswick. His essay was about his aunt, a paramedic who had been his childhood hero. He wrote of how she could command a crisis with a calm voice, how she could make a scared child laugh even while putting a splint on their arm. He wrote about the hole she had left in their family when she had died, and how he wanted to follow in her footsteps, to be that calm voice for someone else\u2019s family. He wanted to honour her memory. Galt\u2019s eyes scanned to the top of the application. The applicant\u2019s name was Michael Crosby. His aunt, the one he was writing about, was Karen Crosby, victim number twenty-eight. The woman Garris had killed for telling him to be brave.\n\nThe hum of the universe seemed to shift, to settle into a new, more harmonious key. Here it was. The answer to the hatred. It wasn't a scholarship fund or a police raid or a bullet in the dark. It was this. A young man, having no idea of the monstrous injustice of his aunt's death, choosing to pick up her fallen banner and carry it forward, not out of vengeance, but out of love. It was the echo of a good voice, refusing to be silenced. Galt closed her eyes, a single, hot tear tracing a path down her cheek. It was not a tear of sadness, but of a profound, overwhelming, and fiercely hopeful relief. The harvest was over. The accounting was almost done.

In the Charlottetown police station, the manic energy of the hunt had been replaced by a persistent, low-grade exhaustion that settled in the corners of rooms like dust. The case was no longer a living thing; it had become a vast, heartbreaking administrative task, a grim accounting of a life\u2019s work devoted to death. The murder board in the briefing room remained, but its function had changed. It was no longer a tool of deduction but a memorial, its surface a sprawling grid of sorrow. Thirty-four of the thirty-seven columns now held a smiling face and a name, a gut-wrenching gallery of stolen lives. The final three, whose degradation from time and circumstance was too severe for a quick DNA match against existing databases, remained stubbornly blank, their files awaiting a more complex genealogical search that felt like a search for ghosts.\n\nIsolde Galt spent most of her days orchestrating this final, sad chapter, her focus divided between the meticulous demands of the investigation and the burgeoning life of her new foundation project. The Thirty-Seven Voices Scholarship had been announced to a wave of national media coverage, a small, bright story of hope emerging from a narrative of pure horror. The first round of applications had flooded in, and Galt found herself reading the essays late into the night in the quiet of her study, the snow falling softly outside her window, each one a small act of defiance against the silence that had so nearly consumed her. They were filled with the earnest, hopeful ambitions of the young, stories of personal inspiration and a deep desire to serve. Each essay she read felt like a vote cast against the darkness, a quiet affirmation of the very compassion that Garris had sought to extinguish.\n\nShe was reviewing a particularly poignant essay from a young woman in Cape Breton who wrote of caring for her grandfather, when Sergeant Miller appeared at her office door, knocking softly. The months had hollowed him out, but a different kind of light had begun to return to his eyes. The haunted, frantic look was gone, replaced by a deep, settled weariness that seemed to have taken permanent root in his bones. He held a single file, but he didn't move to hand it to her, as if reluctant to pass on its sad weight. \u201cMa\u2019am,\u201d he began, his voice quiet but steady. \u201cThey\u2019ve identified number thirty-five. A Jane Doe from a highway ditch in New Brunswick sixteen years ago. She was never reported missing. No one was looking for her.\u201d He paused, the simple, devastating tragedy of that statement hanging in the air between them. \u201cI\u2019ve also put in my transfer request. I\u2019m moving to the financial crimes unit. I think I\u2019ve had my fill of this side of the ledger for a while.\u201d\n\nGalt looked at him, truly looked at him, and saw not a subordinate quitting a difficult post, but a good man who had stared into the abyss and had the wisdom to step back from the edge. She had seen too many cops like Miller burn out, turning their trauma into a bitter, corrosive cynicism that poisoned everything around them. His decision was not an act of surrender, but one of profound self-preservation. \u201cI understand, Frank,\u201d she said, her voice soft with a genuine, unforced warmth. \u201cThe world will always need people to dig into the darkness and find the monsters. But it also needs people who can follow the paper trail and find the thieves. You\u2019ve done more than your share here. More than anyone should ever have to.\u201d He gave her a small, grateful nod, the first flicker of his old, solid self she\u2019d seen in months. He placed the final file on her desk and left, closing the door quietly behind him. Galt was left alone with the thirty-fifth ghost, a woman so thoroughly erased from the world that not even her absence had been noticed.\n\nA week later, a thick manila envelope arrived, forwarded from her office to her home. The postmark was from Vancouver, British Columbia. Inside, she found a letter, handwritten on crisp, heavy stationery. The penmanship was neat, deliberate, each letter formed with a confidence that spoke of a newfound purpose. *Dear Inspector Galt,* it began. *I hope this letter finds you well. I\u2019m enrolled now. University of British Columbia. I\u2019ve decided to specialize in psychiatric nursing, with a focus on trauma and PTSD. For a while, after everything, I thought I was broken. I thought all I could ever be was a victim. A survivor. But you said I saved myself that night, and I\u2019ve thought about that a lot. I think what you meant was that I didn\u2019t just lie down and let the darkness take me. So I\u2019m not going to. I\u2019m going to learn how to be the person who sits with people in the dark, the one who helps them find the light switch. Thank you for showing me that was an option. Sincerely, Elodie Michaud.* Galt read the letter twice, a rare, unfamiliar warmth spreading through her chest. It was not just a thank you; it was a receipt for a debt she hadn\u2019t realized she was owed, a piece of irrefutable proof that her method, her quiet philosophy of proactive restoration, could actually bear fruit.\n\nThat evening, she sat at her desk at home, a glass of wine untouched beside her, the final batch of scholarship essays before her. She was tired, the weight of the day and the accumulated grief of the past months pressing down on her. She decided to read one last application before calling it a night. The applicant was a young man from Saint John, New Brunswick. His essay was about his aunt, a paramedic who had been his childhood hero. He wrote of how she could command a crisis with a calm voice, how she could make a scared child laugh even while putting a splint on their arm. He wrote about the hole she had left in their family when she had died suddenly seven years ago, and how he wanted to follow in her footsteps, to be that calm voice for someone else\u2019s family. He wanted to honour her memory, to carry her legacy of service forward. Galt\u2019s eyes, heavy with fatigue, scanned to the top of the application for the name. The applicant\u2019s name was Michael Crosby. His aunt, the one he was writing about with such love and admiration, was Karen Crosby, victim number twenty-eight. The woman Robert Garris had murdered for telling him to be brave.\n\nThe hum of the universe seemed to shift, to recalibrate, to settle into a new, more harmonious key. Here it was. The final, definitive answer to the hatred. It wasn't the scholarship fund itself, or the police raid, or the bullet in the dark. It was this. A young man, having no idea of the monstrous injustice of his aunt's death, choosing to pick up her fallen banner and carry it forward, not out of vengeance, but out of pure, uncomplicated love. It was the echo of a good voice, refusing to be silenced, amplified by the next generation. Galt closed her eyes, a single, hot tear escaping and tracing a slow path down her cheek. It was not a tear of sadness, but of a profound, overwhelming, and fiercely hopeful relief. The harvest was over. The accounting was almost done. And now, finally, against all odds, the new seeds were beginning to sprout.### Chapter 9\n\nOne year later, the snow fell on Charlottetown in thick, silent flakes, burying the city in a soft, forgiving white. In a brightly lit auditorium at Holland College, the air was warm and filled with a hopeful murmur. It was the inaugural awards ceremony for the Thirty-Seven Voices Scholarship. The front rows were filled with bright, nervous young faces\u2014the first cohort of nursing and paramedic students to benefit from the fund. Behind them sat families, some beaming with pride, others with a more fragile, bittersweet expression. They were the families of the victims, brought together by a tragedy that had been painstakingly, intentionally, transformed into a legacy.\n\nIsolde Galt stood at the podium, a position she had occupied a hundred times at foundation events, but this time felt different. The weight of the thirty-seven names, now engraved on a simple, elegant plaque to her right, was a physical presence. She looked out at the assembled faces\u2014at Cynthia Morrell\u2019s parents sitting in the third row, their expressions a mixture of profound sadness and a quiet, fragile pride; at Michael Crosby, Karen Crosby\u2019s nephew, his posture straight and eager, a young man on the cusp of fulfilling a dream his aunt had inspired. Her gaze found Elodie Michaud, sitting near the front. Elodie had flown in from Vancouver, her presence a quiet testament to the resilience of the human spirit. The terrified, haunted young woman from the parking lot was gone, replaced by a calm, composed individual whose eyes held a depth and wisdom far beyond her years.\n\n\u201cA voice is a powerful thing,\u201d Galt began, her own voice clear and steady, filling the auditorium. \u201cIt can offer comfort. It can express love. It can speak truth to power. It can calm a frightened child or soothe a soul in its final moments. The goal of the man who committed these acts was to create silence. To steal voices. He believed that by doing so, he could somehow win a war against a memory, against a kindness he could not comprehend.\u201d She paused, letting the weight of the statement settle. \u201cTonight, looking at these students, at these families, I can say with absolute certainty that he failed. He created a silence, and we have answered it with a chorus. For every voice he took, a new generation of voices will rise. Stronger. More determined. A legacy not of hatred, but of healing.\u201d\n\nAfter the ceremony, as refreshments were served, the room buzzed with quiet conversations. Galt moved through the crowd, a word of encouragement for a student here, a quiet, respectful nod to a grieving parent there. Michael Crosby approached her, his face flushed with excitement. \u201cInspector Galt\u2014I mean, Ms. Galt,\u201d he stammered, \u201cI just wanted to thank you. My aunt Karen\u2026 she would have loved this. She believed everyone deserved a chance to get help, and a chance to give it. This scholarship\u2026 it feels like I\u2019m carrying a piece of her with me.\u201d Galt looked at the earnest young man, a living, breathing continuation of his aunt\u2019s compassion, and felt a profound sense of rightness, a small but significant victory against the chaos. He still didn\u2019t know the full, horrific truth of how his aunt had died; the family, in consultation with the police, had decided the public story of a tragic accident was a kinder memory to live with. All he knew was that her spirit was being honoured, and that was enough.\n\nLater, she found Elodie by the large windows, looking out at the falling snow. \u201cYour speech was perfect,\u201d Elodie said, turning to her. There was a quiet strength in her demeanour that was astonishing. \u201cYou gave them a narrative that wasn\u2019t about being a victim.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re the one who taught me that was possible,\u201d Galt replied, her voice softer. \u201cYour letter\u2026 it meant a great deal.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy studies are fascinating,\u201d Elodie continued, a new, academic passion in her voice. \u201cWe\u2019re learning about malignant narcissism, pathological grievance\u2026 the way some people build an entire identity around a single perceived injustice, nurturing it like a precious flame. They become the heroes of their own tragic story, and anyone who doesn't fit that narrative becomes a villain who must be destroyed.\u201d She looked at Galt, her expression clear and analytical. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t a monster, was he? Not in a supernatural sense. He was just a man. A broken, pathetic man who chose to burn the world down rather than admit he needed help. That\u2019s almost scarier.\u201d\n\nGalt nodded, sobered by the young woman\u2019s insight. She was right. The myth of the monster was a comfort. The reality of the broken man was a far more terrifying prospect.\n\nJust as the crowd was beginning to thin, her phone vibrated with a text message from the lead analyst on the Garris task force, a young woman who had inherited the final, lingering threads of the case. Galt stepped into a quiet hallway to read it. *Ma\u2019am, you asked to be notified personally. We finally got a hit on victim #37. The last one. Her name was Alice Tremblay. The genealogical search found a second cousin in Quebec. It took them a while to remember her. She wasn\u2019t a nurse or a paramedic. She was a library clerk. She worked at the Charlottetown Public Library seventeen years ago, and disappeared around the same time Garris\u2019s mother was in her final decline. She was never reported missing.*\n\nGalt leaned against the cool wall of the corridor, the cheerful sounds from the reception fading into a dull hum. Alice Tremblay. A library clerk. The timeline was crucial. *Before* Mary-Anne. Before the final grievance that had supposedly launched his crusade. The neat, tidy narrative of his mother\u2019s death, the story he had built his entire murderous theology around, was a lie. A self-serving justification. His hatred hadn't been born in that hospital room; it had already been festering. He had simply found a more noble-sounding cause to attach it to. He had likely approached this lonely library clerk, been rejected, and in his pathetic rage, he had made her his first trophy. His entire war on the \"angels of a mercy he had never been shown\" was a grand, elaborate performance to cover up a much smaller, uglier, and more common story: a lonely man, a spurned advance, and a woman who had paid for it with her life.\n\nLater that night, Galt stood in the community garden, the snow crunching under her boots. The raised beds were dormant, sleeping under their thick white blanket, their life-giving potential a quiet promise waiting for the spring. She thought of Alice Tremblay, the forgotten woman, the true genesis of the horror. Her death laid bare the pathetic truth at the heart of Garris\u2019s monstrousness. He wasn\u2019t a dark avenger; he was just a garden-variety killer who had dressed his mundane cruelty in the borrowed robes of a righteous crusade.\n\nThe knowledge didn\u2019t diminish the tragedy, but it clarified it. The darkness wasn\u2019t a mythical beast. It was a human failure. And the only answer to it, she knew with a bone-deep certainty, was a stubborn, relentless, human determination to do better. To plant, to nurture, to teach, to heal. To answer the silence not with vengeance, but with a chorus of new voices, rising against the cold. The snow continued to fall, covering the old world, waiting for the new one to begin.One year later, the snow fell on Charlottetown in thick, silent flakes, burying the city in a soft, forgiving white.

Spring had come again to the island, a riot of defiant green that painted over the long, monochrome memory of winter. The community garden in the east end was no longer a project; it was an institution. It had tripled in size, a sprawling, chaotic tapestry of vegetable patches, flower beds, and fruit trees, punctuated by a small playground and a cedar-walled community classroom. On a warm Tuesday afternoon in May, Isolde Galt was on her hands and knees in the dirt, her silver-streaked hair pulled back in a loose ponytail, showing a group of schoolchildren how to identify and pull chickweed without disturbing the delicate roots of the peas they were protecting. She was not Detective Inspector Galt anymore. That title, along with the badge and the weary authority that came with it, had been retired three years ago. She was simply Isolde, the Executive Director of the Galt Foundation, a woman who now measured her successes in bushels of produce and graduation rates, not in closed case files.\n\nThe Garris case had become a dark piece of island folklore, a story whispered by teenagers for a thrill, a case study taught at police colleges. For Galt, it was a closed book, its terrible lessons absorbed, its ghosts mostly laid to rest. Her work now was the answer she had forged in the aftermath: building, funding, nurturing. The Thirty-Seven Voices Scholarship had already sent dozens of nurses and paramedics out into the world, a living, breathing chorus of compassionate care that had long ago drowned out the memory of a basement\u2019s hateful hum. The garden, the scholarships, the shelters\u2014they were her life\u2019s work now, a barricade of proactive humanism built against the darkness she had once waded through daily. The soil under her fingernails felt more honest, more real, than the cold steel of a service weapon ever had.\n\nShe was explaining the symbiotic relationship between marigolds and tomato plants when a shadow fell over her. She looked up, squinting into the sun, at a young man in a dark, ill-fitting suit who looked profoundly out of place among the laughing children and buzzing bees. He was young, his face earnest and scrubbed, but his eyes held a premature weariness that she recognized instantly. It was the look of a man who had recently seen something that could never be unseen. He held his credentials in his hand as if he were presenting a holy relic. \u201cMs. Galt? I\u2019m Detective Cormier, Charlottetown Police. I\u2019m\u2026 sorry to interrupt you. I was told I might find you here.\u201d\n\nGalt rose slowly, wiping her earthy hands on a rag tucked into the waistband of her jeans. The name, the title, the look in his eyes\u2014it was a scene from another life, a ghost at the garden party. \u201cDetective,\u201d she said, her voice polite but cool, a subtle boundary being drawn. \u201cI\u2019m retired.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know, ma\u2019am,\u201d he said, his voice tight with a nervous energy she remembered well from her own early days. \u201cBut we have a situation. A bad one. It has\u2026 echoes. I\u2019ve read the Garris file, of course. We all have. And my inspector, he thought\u2026 he suggested I speak to you. Off the record. Just to get your perspective.\u201d\n\nA wave of profound weariness washed over Galt. She had consulted, unofficially, in the first year after her retirement, but had slowly extricated herself, letting the new generation take the lead. \u201cMy perspective is always the same, Detective. You\u2019re looking for a monster, but you will almost certainly find a small, pathetic man. Look for the mundane grievance that he has dressed up in ritual. Look for the human failure at the heart of it all. The theatrics are just a mask for something ugly and commonplace.\u201d It was the lesson she had learned from Alice Tremblay, the final, pathetic truth of Robert Garris, and she had made it her mantra. It was the best advice she had to give, and she hoped it would be enough to send him on his way.\n\nCormier swallowed, clearly steeling himself. He had expected the dismissal. \u201cWe\u2019ve considered that, ma\u2019am. But the ritual is\u2026 specific. The victim is a young nurse at the QEH. Sarah Birtwhistle. Found this morning in her apartment by a colleague. No forced entry. She was in her bed, tucked in neatly, as if she were sleeping. There were no marks on her, no violence. Not in the way you\u2019d think.\u201d He hesitated, his professional composure cracking. \u201cHer hands. They were posed on top of the covers, palms up. And they were\u2026 bare. The ME says they\u2019ve been scrubbed raw, chemically. All the way to the bone in some places. Every trace of her, her oils, her prints, her very skin, it\u2019s just\u2026 gone. And her work gloves, the box of them from her medical bag, they were missing.\u201d\n\nGalt felt a cold tendril of unease snake its way through her. The perversion of care was sickeningly familiar. Garris took their voices, the tools of their lies, as he saw it. This new killer was taking their hands, the instruments of their touch, of their healing. It was a different kind of violation, but it sang in the same terrible key. Still, she kept her distance. It was a horrific crime, another tragedy, but the world was full of them. Her job now was to build, not to deconstruct. \u201cLook at her life, Detective. Who did she refuse? Who did she fail to save? Whose ego did she inadvertently bruise? The answer is there. You just have to dig.\u201d\n\nThe young detective\u2019s face was a mask of desperation. He was out of his depth and he knew it. He took a deep breath, and played the only card he had left. \u201cThere\u2019s something else, ma\u2019am. The reason Inspector Davies sent me. The victim\u2019s name. Sarah Birtwhistle.\u201d He paused, letting the name hang in the warm, sun-drenched air. \u201cWe found her scholarship acceptance letter from your foundation, framed on her living room wall.\u201d Galt\u2019s blood ran cold. She could picture the letterhead, the formal, hopeful language. She had signed that letter herself. Cormier\u2019s voice dropped to a near-whisper. \u201cShe was one of the first. One of the Thirty-Seven Voices.\u201d\n\nThe name was not a case file. It was a promise. It was a brick in the wall she had built against the past. And now, a crack had appeared in that wall. Sarah Birtwhistle was not just a victim; she was one of Galt\u2019s own. The attack was not random. It was a desecration. It was an assault on the answer, a mockery of the defiant chorus she had spent the last five years conducting. The warmth of the afternoon sun vanished, replaced by a familiar, bone-deep chill. The philanthropist who nurtured seedlings and the detective who hunted men, two identities she had worked so hard to separate, slammed back together with the force of a physical collision. She looked away from the hopeful, thriving garden, her gaze turning toward the city beyond, her eyes regaining the sharp, analytical focus she thought she had left behind. The pathetic man could wait. First, she had to find out who was attacking her legacy.The children\u2019s laughter faded into a distant, irrelevant sound. The scent of rich soil and sweet alyssum was replaced by a phantom smell, the cold, chemical tang of a morgue. Isolde Galt\u2019s hands, smudged with the honest dirt of her new life, suddenly felt alien to her. She rose to her full height, her movements losing their relaxed, fluid grace and becoming sharp, economical. She turned to the parent volunteer who was helping with the children. \u201cHelene, could you take over? Something\u2019s come up.\u201d Her voice had changed. The warmth was gone, replaced by a cool, flat tone that Helene, who had only ever known her as the gentle patron of the garden, had never heard. It was a voice that did not invite questions.\n\nShe turned back to Detective Cormier, her eyes, which had been soft and encouraging moments before, now a pair of hard, grey stones. \u201cStart from the beginning. Everything you know, not what you think or what the press is guessing.\u201d They stood there, a jarring tableau of a grim police procedural unfolding amidst the riotous life of the spring garden. Cormier, sweating in his cheap suit, fumbled with his notebook as he recounted the sparse, terrible facts. The wellness check called in by a concerned colleague. The superintendent providing access. The eerily pristine scene. Galt listened without interruption, her gaze fixed on him, her mind assembling the pieces, feeling the old, familiar weight of a monstrous puzzle settling onto her shoulders.\n\n\u201cTake me there,\u201d she said when he had finished. It was not a request.\n\nCormier\u2019s head snapped up. \u201cMa\u2019am, I can\u2019t. It\u2019s an active crime scene. The protocols\u2026 a civilian consultant, maybe, but you\u2019re\u2026\u201d He trailed off, unwilling to state the obvious: she was nothing. A retired cop with a trust fund.\n\nGalt\u2019s expression did not change. \u201cDetective, your Inspector sent you to me for my perspective. My perspective is best acquired at the scene, not from a second-hand account delivered in a vegetable patch. Either you find a way to get me through that door, or I will call Inspector Davies myself and explain to him why his junior officer is obstructing a consultation he specifically requested. The choice is yours, but we are wasting time.\u201d The sheer, unyielding force of her will was a physical presence. Cormier, who had only ever read about the legendary DI Galt, was experiencing her firsthand. He nodded, a single, sharp dip of his chin. The argument was over before it had truly begun.\n\nThe drive across town was a journey back in time for Galt. The familiar streets of her city, which had for the past few years been the backdrop to a life of quiet purpose, now felt like a hunting ground once more. The spring day, with its brilliant sunshine and blossoming trees, seemed like a mockery. She was silent, her mind scrubbing away the past five years of board meetings and planting schedules, the old software of homicide investigation rebooting with a cold, ruthless efficiency. She could feel the mental pathways re-forming, the detached coolness she had cultivated as a shield against horror reasserting itself. The philanthropist was in retreat, and the hunter was re-emerging from a long hibernation.\n\nThe apartment building was a new, modern low-rise, its clean lines and landscaped entrance a stark contrast to the old brick walk-ups where she had spent so much of her career. The forensics van parked at the curb was an ugly, familiar scar on the peaceful scene. Galt moved past the uniformed officer at the door with an aura of authority so absolute that he simply stepped aside, assuming she belonged. Cormier followed in her wake, a nervous acolyte trailing a high priestess. The apartment itself was small, neat, and hopeful. A yoga mat was rolled up in one corner. A row of vibrant succulents lined the windowsill. And on the wall opposite the door, in a simple black frame, was the acceptance letter. *The Galt Foundation is pleased to award you a Thirty-Seven Voices Scholarship\u2026* The words, which she had written and signed herself, were a punch to the gut. This was not a stranger. This was one of hers.\n\nThe bedroom was worse. The horror was quiet, meticulous, and profoundly intimate. Sarah Birtwhistle lay in her bed, the covers drawn up to her chest, her head resting on the pillow. She looked peaceful, asleep. But the smell in the room was wrong. It wasn\u2019t the coppery tang of blood or the cloying sweetness of decay. It was a sharp, biting chemical odour, like bleach and industrial solvent, an antiseptic smell so powerful it was nauseating. And then Galt\u2019s eyes were drawn to the victim\u2019s hands, placed carefully on top of the duvet, palms up, in a gesture that might have been one of supplication. They were a ruin. The skin was gone, scrubbed and abraded away with a terrifying, obsessive thoroughness. In the places where the abrasion was deepest, the pale, glistening white of bone was visible. It was not the result of a frenzied attack; it was the product of a long, painstaking, ritualistic act of erasure.\n\nGalt put on a pair of gloves, the act feeling deeply, grotesquely ironic, and stepped further into the room. She circled the bed, her eyes missing nothing. The lack of struggle. The neatness of the room. She leaned closer, her gaze fixed on the horrifying remnants of the victim\u2019s hands. This was not a punishment. This was an unmaking. She turned to Cormier, who was standing white-faced in the doorway, unable to look directly at the bed. \u201cGarris was a collector of grievances,\u201d she said, her voice a low, analytical hum. \u201cHe wanted trophies, proof of his righteous anger. This is different.\u201d She gestured toward the bed. \u201cHe took her gloves, but he wasn\u2019t content with the symbol. He destroyed the source. He scrubbed away her identity, her touch, her ability to heal. This isn\u2019t about silencing a voice. It\u2019s about purifying a contamination.\u201d\n\nShe walked back out into the small living room, her mind racing, connecting the disparate, terrible pieces. The scholarship. The specific victim. The ritual. This was not a random act of violence. It was a message. It was a refutation. Her work, her legacy, her defiant answer to Garris\u2019s hatred, had provoked a new and terrible response. \u201cDon\u2019t look for a disgruntled patient, Detective,\u201d she said, her back to him as she stared at the framed letter on the wall. \u201cDon\u2019t look for a spurned lover. Garris was a brute who built a theology around his rage. This man is a zealot. He believes he is a purifier. And he didn\u2019t just kill a nurse. He chose his victim from a list. My list.\u201d She turned to face him, her eyes glittering with a cold, dangerous light. Her retirement was officially over. The war she thought she had won had just begun a new, more insidious campaign.",

                                        "text": "The hum was his only constant companion. A low, guttural thrum that vibrated through the concrete floor and up into the soles of his bare, calloused feet. It was the sound of preservation. The sound of his collection. Rob ran a long, three-jointed finger down the frosted white door of the freezer, his nail, thick and yellow as old horn, leaving a faint scratch in the ice. He smiled, a grimace that pulled his thin lips back over grey gums. The expression didn't reach his eyes. Nothing ever reached his eyes, two pits of glittering black obsidian sunk deep in a face the colour of damp parchment.\n\nHe hated the hum, but he needed it. He hated most things. He hated the cheerful, lilting way the morning news announcer on the cheap radio pronounced \u2018Charlottetown\u2019. He hated the smell of salt on the air, a constant reminder of the endless, mocking water that surrounded this stupid little island. He hated the colour red when it was on a stop sign or a valentine, but he loved it when it was wet and fresh and pooling on linoleum. Most of all, he hated nurses. He hated their clean, sterile smell that was a lie, a cover for the rot and decay they wallowed in every day. He hated their soft voices, their patronizing questions\u2014*are you comfortable? Is the pain manageable?*\u2014and the squeak of their rubber-soled shoes on polished floors. They were angels of a mercy he had never been shown, and for that, he would tear their wings off, one by one.\n\nWith a grunt, he pulled the heavy freezer door open. A cloud of frigid air, smelling faintly of meat and frost, billowed out into the damp basement air. His breath hitched. It was a cathedral. Inside, stacked with a disturbing neatness, were dozens of small, vacuum-sealed plastic bags. Each was labelled with a date and a name written in his spidery, cramped script. *Brenda. 14/08. Sharon. 29/08. Mary-Anne. 11/09.* Inside each opaque, frosted pouch was a tongue. He reached in, his long fingers brushing past Sharon, and plucked a more recent acquisition from the top. *Cynthia. 23/09.*\n\nHe carried the small, hard packet over to the single bare bulb that hung from a frayed cord, illuminating a small circle of his subterranean world. A stained mattress in the corner, a wobbly card table with a hot plate, and stacks of medical textbooks stolen from library dumpsters. He held the packet up to the light. The tongue inside was a pale, frozen lump. Cynthia\u2019s. He remembered her. The way she\u2019d tucked a loose strand of blonde hair behind her ear. The little humming sound she made while checking a patient\u2019s blood pressure. A song of life, so easily silenced. He\u2019d watched her for a week, learning her routine, the way she always left the back door unlocked for her cat, the way she drank peppermint tea before bed. The details were important. They were seasoning.\n\nHis stomach rumbled, a low, acidic growl. He wasn\u2019t hungry for the tongue. These were not for eating. They were for remembering. They were the punctuation marks in the long, rambling sentence of his hatred. The meal itself had been\u2026 nourishing. He could still feel the strength of it coursing through his sinewy frame, a warmth that fought back the perpetual chill of his existence. He placed the packet for Cynthia back in its place of honour, his fingers tracing the frozen shape. A good specimen. He had been careful with the excision, using the scalpel he\u2019d taken from Brenda\u2019s medical bag. Precision was a form of respect, in its own way. A respect for the purity of his own loathing. He closed the freezer door, and the hum settled back into its rhythm. Outside his grimy basement window, a sliver of which sat at ground level, he could see the ankles of people walking by on the sidewalk above. Squeaking shoes, purposeful strides. The world of the living. A world that did not know he was down here, waiting, and hating.\n\n* * *\n\nDetective Inspector Isolde Galt believed that philanthropy was simply a form of proactive policing. You could arrest a man for breaking into a house to feed his family, or you could fund a community kitchen that ensured he never got that hungry in the first place. One was a bandage, the other a cure. Her colleagues on the Charlottetown force thought her soft, a bleeding heart with a trust fund and a fancy title. They saw the Galt Foundation\u2019s donations to youth centres and urban gardens and saw a vanity project. They didn\u2019t see the long game. They didn\u2019t see the intricate web of community and trust she was weaving, a net that caught problems long before they washed up as files on her desk.\n\nToday, she was wrist-deep in rich, dark earth. The new community garden in the heart of the city\u2019s east end was her latest project, a patch of reclaimed land that had been an eyesore of weeds and broken glass a month ago. Now, it was a grid of freshly-built raised beds, smelling of cedar and possibility. She was showing a group of teenagers how to properly space kale seedlings, the sun warm on the back of her neck, when her phone buzzed in the pocket of her jeans. She wiped a muddy hand on her thigh before answering, a smear of brown earth a stark contrast to the crisp white of her blouse.\n\n\u201cGalt.\u201d\n\n\u201cMa\u2019am. It\u2019s Miller. We\u2019ve got a bad one. 115 Fitzroy, apartment 4B.\u201d\n\nSergeant Frank Miller\u2019s voice was stripped of its usual laconic drawl. There was a new tension in it, a wire pulled too tight. Galt\u2019s entire posture shifted. The philanthropist melted away, and the DI solidified in her place. Her spine straightened. Her gaze, which had been soft and encouraging, sharpened to a fine point.\n\n\u201cDefine \u2018bad one,\u2019 Frank.\u201d\n\nThere was a pause. She could hear him take a breath, trying to find the professional language for something that had clearly shaken him. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 a mess, ma\u2019am. The vic is Janine O\u2019Dell. A nurse at the QEH. A wellness check called in by her sister. The super let us in.\u201d He paused again. \u201cYou\u2019d better just come see for yourself. Forensics is on the way, but\u2026 this isn\u2019t like anything I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m on my way.\u201d She ended the call, her mind already scrubbing the kale seedlings and the smiling teenagers from its slate. She washed her hands under a garden hose, the cold water doing little to wash away the sudden iciness that had bloomed in her gut. Fitzroy Street. A quiet, respectable block of old brick walk-ups, home to students and young professionals. Janine O\u2019Dell. The name meant nothing to her, but \u2018nurse at the QEH\u2019 snagged in her thoughts. It was a detail that felt important, though she couldn\u2019t say why.\n\nThe drive across town was short. Charlottetown was not a large city, a fact that Galt usually cherished. It fostered a sense of community, of shared space. But today, its smallness felt claustrophobic, as if a predator had been released into a pen that was far too small. As she pulled up to the curb, the flashing lights of the first-responder vehicles seemed to bleed onto the vibrant gold and orange leaves of the maple trees lining the street, a garish, ugly stain on the perfect autumn afternoon.\n\nMiller was waiting for her on the sidewalk, his face pale, a shade lighter than his sandy hair. He was a good cop, solid and dependable, but his imagination was a blunt instrument. He saw the world in black and white, right and wrong. Galt knew that the truth was almost always found in the grey.\n\n\u201cWhat have we got?\u201d she asked, skipping the pleasantries.\n\n\u201cUpstairs. Like I said. It\u2019s\u2026 visceral.\u201d Miller led the way into the building. The lobby smelled of lemon polish and old carpets. There was no hint of the violence waiting three floors up. As they climbed the stairs, a different smell began to assert itself. Faint at first, then stronger. Copper. A butcher-shop smell that clung to the back of the throat. And something else underneath it. Something wilder. Gamey.\n\nThe door to 4B was ajar, a yellow ribbon of police tape already stretched across it. The apartment was small, tidy. A stack of magazines on a coffee table, a half-finished mug of tea on the kitchen counter, a cat-shaped cookie jar on top of the fridge. It was the picture of a quiet, ordinary life. Except for the body.\n\nJanine O\u2019Dell lay on the floor of her small living room, her limbs arranged in a way that was profoundly, hideously wrong. Galt\u2019s eyes took in the scene with a practiced, detached coolness that was the only shield she had against the horror. She catalogued the details. No signs of a struggle at the door. No forced entry. The victim was in her pyjamas. The television was on, muted. The violence had been sudden, and it had been personal. Her gaze swept the room, looking for the inconsistency, the thing that didn\u2019t belong. Her eyes landed on the half-empty mug on the counter. Peppermint tea. The bag was still in it. An open box of the same tea sat beside it.\n\n\u201cThe ME is going to have a field day,\u201d Miller muttered, his voice low. \u201cWounds are\u2026 I don\u2019t even know what to call them. Not knife, not bullet. Tearing. Bites, maybe? Big ones.\u201d\n\nGalt didn\u2019t answer. She crouched down, careful not to disturb anything, her gaze fixed on the victim\u2019s face. The woman\u2019s eyes were open, wide with a final, uncomprehending terror. Her mouth was agape. And it was empty. Not just empty of a scream, but empty of the organ that would have produced it.\n\nGalt felt a cold dread snake its way up her spine, colder and more primal than the initial shock. This was the detail Miller had struggled to articulate. This was the thing that made the scene more than a simple, brutal murder.\n\n\u201cFrank,\u201d she said, her voice quiet but sharp as a shard of glass. \u201cCheck her medical records. Check her work locker, her car. I want to know if she carried a personal medical kit. I want to know if she\u2019s missing a scalpel.\u201d\n\nMiller looked at her, confused. \u201cA scalpel? Ma\u2019am, whatever did this, it wasn\u2019t a scalpel.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe wounds, no,\u201d Galt agreed, standing up and looking around the pristine apartment again. The cat cookie jar. The tidy magazines. The brutalized body. The surgically absent tongue. \u201cBut the thing that was taken\u2026 that was done with precision.\u201d She walked towards the window and looked down at the street below, at the flashing lights that seemed so inadequate now. This wasn't a crime of passion. It wasn't a robbery gone wrong. This was a harvest. And the terrible, chilling thought that settled over her was that the harvest was not yet over. Somewhere in her small, peaceful city, a monster was putting his tools away, sated for now, and waiting for his hunger to rise again."

You think this is connected to her work?\u201d He gestured vaguely at the carnage on the floor. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t look like a disgruntled patient.\u201d\n\n\u201cA disgruntled patient doesn\u2019t do this, Frank. This is\u2026 worship. This is a ritual.\u201d Galt\u2019s gaze was distant, seeing not just the room but the invisible lines of connection that might stretch out from it. \u201cThe brutality is a performance, but the trophy is the point. He\u2019s taking their voices. I want a list of every female nurse or care worker reported missing in the Maritimes in the last six months. Check New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, too. We don't know how far he travels. Cross-reference it with any unsolved homicides with unusual levels of violence, even if the details don\u2019t match this exactly. The M.O. might have evolved. This might be the first time he\u2019s left a body to be found.\u201d\n\nThe implication hung in the air. That there were others. That Janine O\u2019Dell was not the beginning, but simply the first time the killer had become visible. Miller swallowed hard, his notepad already in his hand. The scope of the investigation had just exploded from a single, horrific murder in Charlottetown to a potential multi-province serial killer case. He nodded, the dependable soldier receiving his orders, and moved towards the door to start making calls. The case had grown teeth, and he could feel them at his throat.\n\nGalt heard the forensics team arriving, the clatter of their metal cases a starkly practical sound in the charged atmosphere. Dr. Ben Carter, the chief medical examiner, entered first. He was a small, neat man with a bird-like curiosity that was at odds with his grim profession. He took in the scene with a practiced eye, his expression unreadable as he put on a fresh pair of gloves. He exchanged a brief, solemn nod with Galt before turning his full attention to the victim.\n\n\u201cWhat a contradiction,\u201d he murmured, more to himself than to her, as he knelt. Galt moved closer, staying outside the perimeter of the body. \u201cThe primary wounds\u2026 massive tissue damage, avulsions, serrated edges on the bone. Looks like he used his teeth and his hands. The sheer force is\u2026 staggering. But then you look at the oral cavity.\u201d He shone a penlight into Janine O\u2019Dell\u2019s open mouth. \u201cThe glossectomy is a masterpiece of butchery. Not a nick on the gums, the lips, or the palate. The lingual artery was perfectly clamped or cauterized. Minimal peripheral bleeding. He used a tool for this part. Something incredibly sharp and precise. And he knew exactly what he was doing.\u201d\n\nGalt\u2019s theory solidified into a cold, hard certainty. A scalpel. Or something very much like it. The killer was a brute and a surgeon, a monster with a steady hand. She turned away from the body, her mind needing a different problem to solve. The apartment itself. She walked into the small kitchen, her eyes scanning every surface. The cat-shaped cookie jar. The open box of peppermint tea. The half-drunk mug. She picked up a framed photo from the counter. Janine O\u2019Dell, smiling, holding a fluffy ginger cat.\n\n\u201cFrank,\u201d she called out to Miller, who was standing in the doorway. \u201cThe sister who called in the wellness check. Get her on the phone. I want to know about the cat. I want to know if Janine was in the habit of leaving a door or a window open for it.\u201d The lack of forced entry was a scream in the quiet apartment. A killer this careful, this deliberate, would not have been clumsy. He wouldn\u2019t have kicked in the door. He would have slipped in, a shadow through a crack that his victim provided. He had studied her. He had known her habits. The thought made the crime feel even more intimate, more violating.\n\nLeaving Carter and his team to their meticulous, grim work, Galt walked back out into the hallway. The scent of copper and decay clung to her clothes. As she descended the stairs, the smell of lemon polish in the lobby seemed like a pathetic lie. The whole building, the whole street, the whole, beautiful, sun-drenched autumn city felt like a lie. A flimsy stage set behind which something ancient and ravenous was stirring. She stepped out into the fresh air, but it brought no relief. She could feel the killer\u2019s presence settle over Charlottetown like a low-pressure system, a promise of the storm to come.

She was not a woman given to flights of fancy, but she could almost hear the ghost of a scream, a soundless cry of violation that was more chilling than any noise. Her phone buzzed again, and she answered without looking at the screen, her voice flat. \u201cGalt.\u201d It was Miller. \u201cMa\u2019am, I just got off the phone with the sister, Eleanor. You were right. Janine had a cat, Marmalade. She was worried sick about him getting out onto the street, so she never used the front door. But the kitchen has a back door that opens onto an old iron fire escape. She had a small cat flap installed in that door last year. The sister says it leads to a little enclosed landing one storey up from the alley. Janine thought it was perfectly safe, just a little private balcony for the cat.\u201d\n\nA cold thread of certainty stitched itself through Galt\u2019s thoughts. It wasn\u2019t a guess anymore. The killer had watched. He had learned. He knew about the cat, the back door, the illusion of safety. He would have scaled the wall in the darkness of the alley, silent and unseen, and slipped through that small opening meant for a beloved pet. He had turned her sanctuary into a trapdoor. \u201cGet forensics to dust every inch of that fire escape and the alley wall below it,\u201d she ordered, her voice low and tight. \u201cHe\u2019s careful, but he\u2019s not a ghost. He had to touch something.\u201d She ended the call and stared through the windshield at the street, at the ordinary brick of the building that now seemed to hold a terrible secret. The killer hadn\u2019t broken in. He had been let in by the simple, trusting habits of his victim\u2019s daily life.\n\nThe hum was his choir, the single droning note of his private hymn. Rob sat at the wobbly card table, the book open before him under the stark light of the single bulb. *Gray\u2019s Anatomy for Students.* The pages were worn, the diagrams of the human head and neck smudged with his fingerprints. He wasn\u2019t a student, not in any formal sense. He was a scholar of a much older, more fundamental discipline. He traced the elegant curve of the glossopharyngeal nerve with a grimy fingernail, marvelling at its complexity. All of it, the intricate wiring for taste, for speech, for the simple act of swallowing, all of it serving that one fleshy muscle. A muscle designed for lies. *Are you comfortable?* A lie. *This won\u2019t hurt a bit.* A lie. *I\u2019m here to help.* The biggest lie of all.\n\nHis work on Janine\u2014he didn\u2019t know her name, he thought of her as \u2018Peppermint Tea\u2019\u2014had been exquisite. He\u2019d made the incision just posterior to the circumvallate papillae, a clean, deep cut. He had ligated the arteries with a practiced efficiency born of study and repetition. The brachial strength required for the rest of it, for the breaking and the tearing, was a different kind of skill, a primal satisfaction that sang in his blood. But the precision, that was his art. He flexed his long, three-jointed fingers. They were instruments of a terrible and exacting craft. He had learned from his mistakes. Brenda had been messy. Sharon had been better. With Cynthia, and now with Peppermint Tea, he had achieved a kind of perfection. He closed the book, the dry rustle of the page an Amen to his silent prayer. He was not just a collector. He was an archivist of silence, the sole curator of a museum of stolen voices.\n\nBy evening, the organized chaos of the investigation had found a home in the main briefing room of the Charlottetown station. A large whiteboard dominated one wall, with \u201cJanine O\u2019Dell\u201d written at the top. Galt stood before it, a mug of black coffee in her hand, watching as the sparse details began to populate the sterile white surface. Miller came in, looking tired but wired, and pinned a plastic-enclosed photograph to the board. It was a blurry shot of a partial footprint, taken in the damp soil of the alleyway behind Janine\u2019s apartment building. \u201cForensics found scuff marks on the bricks below the fire escape, ma\u2019am. Consistent with someone climbing the wall. They found this print by a dumpster about twenty feet away. The soil was too soft for a clean impression, but the lab says it\u2019s from a work boot, men\u2019s size twelve or thirteen. Big guy.\u201d\n\nGalt nodded, her eyes fixed on the print. It was a ghost, a faint trace, but it was something tangible. It gave their unsubstance a footprint. As Miller stepped back, a junior analyst, a young woman with wide, nervous eyes, approached Galt holding a flimsy sheet of paper. \u201cDI Galt? We ran that search you asked for. Missing female healthcare workers in the Maritimes, last six months.\u201d She hesitated, swallowing. \u201cWe got a hit. A probable. A Licensed Practical Nurse named Sharon Delaney. Went missing from Moncton, New Brunswick, nine weeks ago. Vanished from the hospital parking garage after a double shift. No witnesses, no ransom, no activity on her accounts. Her case file is cold.\u201d\n\nGalt took the paper. Sharon Delaney. 29. LPN at The Moncton Hospital. A smiling, professional headshot was clipped to the report. Galt stared at the photo, a chill creeping over her that had nothing to do with the station\u2019s aggressive air conditioning. The name itself meant nothing, but the profession, the timeline, the simple, quiet vanishing\u2014it all fit. It was a perfect echo of the silence that now filled Janine O\u2019Dell\u2019s apartment. \u201cGet me everything Moncton has on her case,\u201d Galt said, her voice dangerously quiet. \u201cAnd run another search. Broaden the parameters. Look for any single-fatality accidents or un-witnessed suicides involving female nurses or paramedics in the region over the last year. Our man might not have started out this bold. He may have been practicing, hiding his work inside tragedies.\u201d The analyst scurried away, and Galt turned back to the whiteboard. She took a black marker and, underneath Janine O\u2019Dell\u2019s name, she wrote SHARON DELANEY, underlining it twice. The list had begun."

                                        "text": "The morning light that filtered through the high, grimy window of the basement was weak and grey, doing little to dilute the oppressive gloom. Rob was not a creature of the day. The sun was an accusation, a bright, stupid eye that saw too much. He preferred the world muted, wrapped in shadow and fog, where he could move without being noticed. He sat on the edge of the stained mattress, lacing up a pair of heavy, steel-toed work boots, the thick leather scarred and scuffed. The footprint in the alley. He was not a fool. He knew enough to be careful, but the damp earth had been a treachery he hadn't anticipated. It was a minor irritation, a loose thread in an otherwise perfect tapestry. He would simply have to be more vigilant.\n\nThe hum of the freezer was a familiar bass line, but it was punctuated now by a new sound: the sputtering cough of the small gasoline generator he kept in the far corner, tucked behind a stack of yellowed newspapers. It was his greatest vulnerability. The machine required fuel, and fuel required trips to the outside world, interactions with pimply-faced clerks who asked if you wanted to buy a lottery ticket. Every trip was a risk, a brief, unwanted immersion in the world he so thoroughly despised. He checked the fuel level, the fumes catching in his throat. He had enough for another day. Enough to keep the choir singing. He ran his hand over the top of the freezer, a gesture that was almost tender. His collection was safe. His memories were preserved. That was all that mattered.\n\nHe ascended the creaking wooden stairs that led up to a heavy, padlocked door at the back of a derelict laundromat. The business had been closed for years, a husk of forgotten chores and soap-scummed linoleum. He was the building\u2019s unofficial, unknown caretaker. He slipped out a side door into a weed-choked alley, pulling the collar of his worn canvas jacket up against the morning chill. The salt on the air was sharp today, an abrasive scrub against his senses. He began his walk, a steady, loping gait that ate up the pavement. His destination was the place he hated most, the place that was both his hunting ground and the very font of his revulsion. The Queen Elizabeth Hospital. He was a porter there. A ghost in green scrubs, pushing laundry carts and biohazard bins, utterly invisible. It was the perfect vantage point. He was a wolf paid to guard the sheep, and he saw everything.\n\n* * *\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a match.\u201d Sergeant Miller\u2019s voice cut through the early morning hush of the briefing room. He dropped a thick file marked MONCTON R.C.M.P. onto the central table. The sound was unnervingly loud. Isolde Galt, who had been staring at the two names on the whiteboard for the better part of an hour, turned, her eyes sharp. She had not slept. She had showered and changed, but the scent of blood and peppermint tea seemed to have permanently embedded itself in her memory.\n\n\u201cTell me,\u201d she said.\n\nMiller opened the file, his finger tracing a line in the report. \u201cSharon Delaney. LPN. Her colleagues described her as meticulous. She was working a double and was exhausted. They thought she might have just walked away, burnout. But her sister insisted she would never leave without her medical kit. It was a graduation gift from her parents. She took it everywhere.\u201d He flipped a page to a supplemental report. \u201cA junior officer canvassed the local pawn shops a week after she disappeared. Found the kit. Some junkie had sold it for twenty bucks. Most of the contents were there, but one item was noted as missing.\u201d Miller looked up at Galt, his expression grim. \u201cA number three scalpel handle with a fresh number ten blade.\u201d\n\nThe room was silent. It was the confirmation they dreaded and expected. The scalpel. The precision tool for the trophy. Janine O\u2019Dell had not been the first. She was just the latest entry in a ledger written in blood. Galt felt a grim satisfaction warring with the horror. Her instincts had been right. This wasn't a single act; it was a campaign. A long, patient war against a specific type of person.\n\n\u201cHe took Delaney\u2019s scalpel and used it to kill O\u2019Dell,\u201d Galt mused, her mind racing, connecting the points. \u201cHe\u2019s a scavenger. He takes trophies, but he takes tools, too. He\u2019s building his kit as he goes.\u201d She turned back to the board and uncapped her marker. She drew a line connecting the two names, and next to it, she wrote \u2018SCALPEL\u2019. The word looked obscene next to the names of the dead. \u201cThe lab report on the footprint?\u201d\n\n\u201cSize thirteen work boot, as suspected,\u201d Miller confirmed. \u201cCommon brand, could be from any hardware store on the island. But it\u2019s a starting point. We\u2019re pulling sales records for the last year. It\u2019s a mountain of data, but it\u2019s something.\u201d He hesitated. \u201cThere\u2019s more, ma\u2019am. From that wider search you requested. Four months ago. A paramedic in Summerside. Brenda Akerley. Drove her car off a pier on a foggy night. Ruled an accident. She was on her way home after a forty-eight-hour shift. The divers recovered the car, but the driver\u2019s side door was torn almost clean off its hinges. The M.E. at the time flagged it as anomalous but couldn\u2019t explain it. Attributed it to the force of the impact and the water pressure.\u201d\n\nGalt felt a leaden weight settle in her stomach. \u201cHer body?\u201d\n\nMiller swallowed. \u201cMostly recovered. The crabs had gotten to her. But the autopsy report is\u2026 vague on certain details. Given the state of decomposition and the marine life, the pathologist couldn\u2019t be certain about the cause of death beyond drowning. But he did note that the hyoid bone was missing. He chalked it up to predation.\u201d\n\nGalt closed her eyes. The tongue. The base of it attaches to the hyoid bone. A careful excision, a 'masterpiece of butchery' as Ben Carter had called it, would take the bone with it. This wasn\u2019t predation by crabs. It was predation by a monster. She opened her eyes and walked to the board. She wrote BRENDA AKERLEY underneath the other two names. The list was growing. He hadn't just become visible. He had been hiding his work in plain sight, using the chaos of accidents to mask his terrible signature. He was getting bolder. The ritual was the same, but now he was leaving the bodies as monuments to his hatred.\n\n\u201cGet me that full autopsy report from Summerside,\u201d she commanded. \u201cAnd issue a bulletin to all healthcare facilities on the island. Not public, internal. Advise staff to be aware of their surroundings, to walk in groups, to report any unusual behaviour. Emphasize security around staff entrances and parking lots. We can\u2019t tell them what we\u2019re looking for, not yet. The panic would be uncontainable. But we have to warn them. The flock needs to know there\u2019s a wolf inside the fence.\u201d She looked at the names on the board, no longer just case files but a gathering of silent ghosts. \"He's hunting them, Frank. One by one.\""

He was a creature of the hospital\u2019s underbelly, a silent ferryman of its filth and refuse. Dressed in the anonymous green scrubs of a porter, he was functionally invisible, a large, shambling shape pushing a cart of soiled linens or a red bin of biohazardous waste. The invisibility was a cloak he wore with pride. It allowed him to watch.\n\nHe hated the sound of the place\u2014the insistent beeping of a thousand machines keeping the dying alive for one more miserable day, the forced cheerfulness in the voices that crackled from the overhead intercom, the pathetic, wet sound of weeping from behind closed doors. Most of all, he hated the nurses. He saw the way they moved, a blur of pastel scrubs and sensible shoes. He watched them dispense pills in tiny paper cups and adjust pillows with hands that were meant to look gentle. He saw the performance in it, the rehearsed compassion. They were actresses in a long, tedious play about healing, and he was the only one in the audience who knew it was all a lie.\n\nHis cart rumbled quietly over the polished linoleum. He kept his head down, his gaze fixed on the floor a few feet in front of him, a posture of subservience that no one ever questioned. From beneath the brim of his imagined cap, his eyes flickered, taking in everything. A nurse at the far end of the hall, leaning against a counter, laughing with a young doctor. The sound was like grinding glass in his ears. He memorized the precise shade of her strawberry-blonde hair, the way she absently twisted a silver ring on her finger. A detail. Another piece of kindling for the cold fire inside him. He passed a room where another nurse, young and dark-haired, was patiently explaining a procedure to an elderly woman, her voice a soft, condescending murmur. Rob\u2019s hand tightened on the handle of his cart, the knuckles of his long fingers turning white. *Are you comfortable? Is the pain manageable?* The lies were a poison, and he was the only antidote.\n\n\u201cThe Summerside M.E. confirms it,\u201d Dr. Ben Carter said, sliding a folder across the briefing room table towards Galt. His face, usually a mask of professional detachment, was tight with a grim fascination. \u201cBrenda Akerley\u2019s autopsy was a mess, but the initial report was thorough. The pathologist noted the absence of the tongue and the hyoid bone but, as we know, attributed it to marine scavengers. Looking at his photos with what we now know about Janine O\u2019Dell, it\u2019s not scavenging. It\u2019s excision. The tissue margins around the base of the tongue, what\u2019s left of them, are too clean. The damage to the mandible is\u2026 well, it looks like someone used a pry bar.\u201d\n\n\u201cOr just his hands,\u201d Miller added quietly from his corner of the room. He looked as if he hadn't slept, his uniform rumpled, his face a landscape of fatigue.\n\nGalt stared at the photo of Brenda Akerley that was now pinned to the board. Three women. A paramedic, an LPN, a registered nurse. Summerside, Moncton, Charlottetown. A deadly triangle spreading across the Maritimes. \u201cHe\u2019s escalating,\u201d she said, her voice a low thrum that matched the intensity in her eyes. \u201cFrom hiding his work inside an accident to staging a disappearance to\u2026 this.\u201d She gestured towards Janine O\u2019Dell\u2019s file. \u201cA public declaration. He left her for us to find. He\u2019s getting more confident. More arrogant.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe work boot lead is a swamp,\u201d Miller reported, rubbing his eyes. \u201cWe\u2019ve pulled sales records from every major retailer on the island. Over five thousand pairs of that brand and size sold in the last two years. We\u2019re trying to cross-reference it with hospital employees, delivery drivers, anyone with a reason to be at these locations, but it\u2019s a mammoth task.\u201d\n\n\u201cKeep digging,\u201d Galt ordered, though she knew it was a long shot. The killer was careful. He wouldn\u2019t be so easily caught. \u201cWhat about the bulletin? What\u2019s the response?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat you\u2019d expect,\u201d Miller sighed. \u201cQuiet panic. The hospital administrators are cooperating, reviewing security protocols. The staff\u2026 they\u2019re scared. A few calls have come in, but it\u2019s all been benign. A janitor who seemed \u2018shifty,\u2019 a patient\u2019s cousin who was \u2018staring.\u2019 People are seeing ghosts in every shadow.\u201d\n\nGalt nodded, unsurprised. Fear was a blunt instrument. It rarely pointed in the right direction. She turned back to the board, her gaze drifting over the three smiling faces. The tools, the locations, the methods\u2014those were the \u2018what\u2019 and the \u2018how\u2019. But they were just branches. She needed the root. \u201cThis isn't random violence, Frank. This is personal. This level of hatred has a source. He feels wronged by them, specifically. For a \u2018mercy he had never been shown.\u2019\u201d She was quoting her own theory, speaking it aloud to give it weight. \u201cI want a new search. Not missing persons. I want to look at the hospitals themselves. Pull records for the last two decades from the QEH, Moncton General, and Summerside\u2019s Prince County Hospital. I want every formal complaint, every lawsuit, every incident report involving a male patient or the male family member of a patient who died under a female nurse\u2019s care.\u201d\n\nMiller\u2019s pen froze over his notepad. \u201cMa\u2019am, that\u2019s\u2026 that\u2019s not just a mountain of data. That\u2019s an entire mountain range. We\u2019d need a team of paralegals and a court order just to get started.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen get a court order,\u201d Galt said, her tone leaving no room for argument. \u201cThe answer isn\u2019t on the street. It\u2019s buried in a file somewhere. In a piece of paper that details the moment this man\u2019s hatred was born. Find that moment.\u201d\n\nThe break room at the QEH buzzed with a nervous energy that coffee couldn\u2019t fix. The official-looking memo pinned to the bulletin board was vague\u2014\"an ongoing police matter,\" \"exercise increased vigilance\"\u2014but the whispers filled in the blanks. Everyone knew Janine O\u2019Dell. Everyone had heard the rumours about how she was found. Fear, thick and cloying as cheap air freshener, hung in the air.\n\n\u201cThey say it was someone she knew,\u201d a surgical nurse whispered, twisting a paper cup in her hands.\n\n\u201cI heard there was no forced entry,\u201d another added. \u201cHe just\u2026 walked in.\u201d\n\nElodie Michaud, a young RN only six months out of school, listened with a growing sense of unease. She was pragmatic, not one to indulge in gossip, but the fear was contagious. She tried to focus on the chart in her lap, but her mind kept drifting. Her gaze went to the hallway, where one of the porters was passing, pushing a large grey bin. He was a big man, broad and tall, with a strange, loping walk. He always kept his head down, and she\u2019d never heard him speak a single word, not even a grunt of acknowledgement. She\u2019d tried to say hello to him once, a few weeks ago, and he had looked right through her, his eyes like two black stones.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just so creepy,\u201d she said, more to herself than to anyone else. \u201cYou just never know who you\u2019re working with.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho, old Grumpy?\u201d another nurse chuckled, following her gaze. \u201cThe porter? Yeah, he\u2019s a weird one. Been here for ages. Harmless, though. Just one of those people who hates the world.\u201d\n\nElodie watched as he turned a corner and disappeared from view. Harmless. Maybe. But there was a stillness about him, a coiled tension that was different from simple bad temper. It was an absence of something, a void where normal human interaction should be. She shook her head, dismissing the thought as a product of the day\u2019s paranoia. It was easier to believe that he was just a miserable man in a miserable job. It was much, much harder to consider what else he might be."

                                        "text": "### Chapter 3\n\nHe had been seen. The thought did not produce panic\u2014panic was a useless, messy emotion\u2014but a cold, clarifying alertness. As he pushed his cart of soiled linens down the long, sterile corridor, he replayed the moment. The young nurse, the new one, Michaud. Her gaze had not simply slid off him as most did. It had lingered for a second too long, snagged on the anomaly of his presence. She had not seen a porter; she had seen a man. It was a distinction he could not afford. He knew her name, of course. He knew all their names. He was a meticulous student. Elodie Michaud. Six months on the ward, diligent, quick, still possessing that infuriating earnestness of the newly anointed, the belief that she was actually making a difference.\n\nHis invisibility was his most crucial tool, more vital than Brenda\u2019s scalpel or the strength in his hands. It allowed him to move through their world, this temple of false hope, as a janissary of its secrets. He saw the shortcuts they took, heard the unprofessional gossip they shared, noted the exhaustion that frayed the edges of their compassion. Now, a single pair of eyes had threatened to pierce that cloak. He continued his rounds, his movements unchanged, his head still bowed in that perfect pantomime of weary servitude. But his attention had a new, sharp focus. He began to watch Elodie Michaud, not as part of the general flock he loathed, but as an individual problem to be assessed. He noted the way she chewed on her pen while charting, the way she always refilled the water pitcher for Mrs. Henderson in room 214 without being asked, the little hum of an old folk song she murmured when she thought no one was listening. Another singer. Another song he could imagine silencing.\n\nThe first wave of hospital data crashed into the Charlottetown police station like a tidal wave of paper and bureaucratic red tape. Miller stood before Galt\u2019s desk, a veritable mountain of binders and accordion files threatening to spill from his arms. \u201cWe got the warrants,\u201d he said, his voice laced with the weariness of a man fighting a war on two fronts: one against a monster and the other against hospital administration. \u201cQEH legal fought us every step of the way, citing privacy. We\u2019ve started with them, going back twenty years. It\u2019s\u2026 a lot, ma\u2019am. Complaints, incident reports, wrongful death suits. Thousands of pages. We\u2019ve got three temps just scanning and digitizing, but it\u2019s going to take weeks to create a searchable database.\u201d\n\nIsolde Galt looked at the mountain of paper, undaunted. The answer was in there. The first tremor of the earthquake to come. She knew it with a certainty that defied the sheer statistical improbability of finding it. \u201cFocus the search terms,\u201d she instructed, her voice calm and clear amidst the paper chaos. \u201cWe\u2019re not just looking for a death. We\u2019re looking for a specific narrative. A male patient or close male relative. A grievance centered on perceived neglect or unnecessary suffering. And the primary caregiver in the complaint must be a female nurse. Look for words like \u2018pain,\u2019 \u2018ignored,\u2019 \u2018suffering,\u2019 \u2018begged,\u2019 \u2018mercy.\u2019\u201d She was sketching the outline of the killer\u2019s memory, the foundational trauma that had metastasized into this campaign of butchery.\n\nLater that day, Galt found herself back at the community garden. The sharp, antiseptic smells of the police station had been replaced by the rich perfume of damp earth and late-blooming marigolds. The setting sun cast long shadows, striping the neat garden beds with gold and black. One of the teenagers from her first day, a quiet girl named Maya, was carefully watering a row of fledgling spinach. \u201cYou have to do it at the base,\u201d Galt found herself saying, her voice softer than it had been all day. \u201cDon\u2019t wash the soil off the leaves.\u201d For a few minutes, she lost herself in the simple, honest work of cultivation. Here, things grew. They reached for the light. It was the antithesis of her current world, which was consumed by decay and darkness, by a man who harvested life instead of nurturing it. But even here, she couldn\u2019t escape. Looking at the neat rows, she thought of the terrible neatness of the freezer, the stacked and labelled pouches. A perversion of order. A garden of death.\n\nThe quiet on the ward after 10 p.m. was a special kind of silence, thin and fragile, easily broken by a cough or a monitor\u2019s alarm. Elodie Michaud moved through it on soft-soled shoes, completing her final chartings. The nervous buzz from the morning had faded, replaced by the dull ache of a twelve-hour shift. She wanted nothing more than to go home, lock her door, and fall into bed. Her path to the exit took her past the entrance to the staff locker room. The light was off, but the door was propped open by a rubber wedge, a common practice for the late-night cleaning crew. She pushed it open, her mind already on the drive home. And then she froze.\n\nHe was there. In the far corner of the long, narrow room, half-hidden in the deep shadows between the metal lockers and the large, red biohazard bins. The porter. He wasn\u2019t moving, wasn\u2019t cleaning. He was just standing, a tall, hulking silhouette, perfectly still. The air grew thick and cold. Her heart hammered against her ribs, a frantic bird in a cage. This was wrong. There was no reason for him to be in here, and certainly not like this, waiting in the dark like a statue. As if sensing her presence, his head turned, a slow, deliberate motion. His face was a pale mask in the gloom, but she could feel his eyes on her, two points of absolute darkness. He didn\u2019t speak. He didn\u2019t move another inch. The silence stretched, becoming a physical pressure. It was a hunter\u2019s silence, a predator\u2019s stillness. After a moment that felt like an eternity, he turned his head away, grabbed the handle of a bin, and wheeled it out a rear service exit with his strange, loping gait, the quiet rumble of the wheels fading down the service corridor.\n\nElodie didn\u2019t realize she\u2019d been holding her breath until it came out in a ragged, shuddering gasp. She backed out of the locker room, not bothering to retrieve her things. The casual explanation from her colleague\u2014*harmless, just hates the world*\u2014evaporated in a flash of pure, instinctual terror. It wasn\u2019t the world he hated. It was something far more specific. She fumbled for her phone as she hurried down the main hall, her footsteps echoing far too loudly in the empty space. She didn\u2019t know who to call or what to say. How do you report a look? How do you describe a silence that felt like a threat?\n\nIt was after midnight when the junior analyst, eyes blurry from staring at a screen for ten hours straight, flagged a file. It was old, from fifteen years ago, buried in the QEH\u2019s archived complaints. The analyst printed it and, with a trembling hand, carried it to Detective Inspector Galt, who was still at her desk, staring at the three smiling photos on the whiteboard. Galt took the sheet. It was a formal grievance filed by a Mr. Robert Garris, concerning the end-of-life care of his mother, who had died of metastatic bone cancer. The complaint was rambling, filled with vitriol and grief, accusing the nurse on duty of being callous, of ignoring his mother\u2019s agonized pleas for more morphine in her final hours. He wrote that the nurse had smiled, a \u201cpitiless plastic smile,\u201d and told him that the dosage was fixed, that they had to manage the pain, not chase it. He accused her of letting his mother suffer.\n\nGalt\u2019s eyes scanned the document, her focus narrowing to a single, crucial line. The name of the nurse who had signed the chart, the target of all that fifteen-year-old rage. Her blood ran cold. She walked to the evidence table, where the preliminary list of items from the killer\u2019s basement was being catalogued for the file. The list was still fragmented, based on the spidery script from the freezer bags, names without context. Galt stared at the name on the complaint form, then back at the list in her head. A perfect, chilling match. It was more than a lead; it was a genesis. The name of the nurse who had shown him a mercy he had deemed insufficient. The name of one of his first trophies. Mary-Anne."

As he pushed his cart of soiled linens down the long, sterile corridor, he replayed the moment. The young nurse, the new one, Michaud. Her gaze had not simply slid off him as most did. It had lingered for a second too long, snagged on the anomaly of his presence. She had not seen a porter; she had seen a man. It was a distinction he could not afford. He knew her name, of course. He knew all their names. He was a meticulous student. Elodie Michaud. Six months on the ward, diligent, quick, still possessing that infuriating earnestness of the newly anointed, the belief that she was actually making a difference.\n\nHis invisibility was his most crucial tool, more vital than Brenda\u2019s scalpel or the strength in his hands. It allowed him to move through their world, this temple of false hope, as a janissary of its secrets. He saw the shortcuts they took, heard the unprofessional gossip they shared, noted the exhaustion that frayed the edges of their compassion. Now, a single pair of eyes had threatened to pierce that cloak. He continued his rounds, his movements unchanged, his head still bowed in that perfect pantomime of weary servitude. But his attention had a new, sharp focus. He began to watch Elodie Michaud, not as part of the general flock he loathed, but as an individual problem to be assessed. He noted the way she chewed on her pen while charting, the way she always refilled the water pitcher for Mrs. Henderson in room 214 without being asked, the little hum of an old folk song she murmured when she thought no one was listening. Another singer. Another song he could imagine silencing.\n\n* * *\n\nThe quiet on the ward after 10 p.m. was a special kind of silence, thin and fragile, easily broken by a cough or a monitor\u2019s alarm. Elodie Michaud moved through it on soft-soled shoes, completing her final chartings. The nervous buzz from the morning had faded, replaced by the dull ache of a twelve-hour shift. She wanted nothing more than to go home, lock her door, and fall into bed. Her path to the exit took her past the entrance to the staff locker room. The light was off, but the door was propped open by a rubber wedge, a common practice for the late-night cleaning crew. She pushed it open, her mind already on the drive home. And then she froze.\n\nHe was there. In the far corner of the long, narrow room, half-hidden in the deep shadows between the metal lockers and the large, red biohazard bins. The porter. He wasn\u2019t moving, wasn\u2019t cleaning. He was just standing, a tall, hulking silhouette, perfectly still. The air grew thick and cold. Her heart hammered against her ribs, a frantic bird in a cage. This was wrong. There was no reason for him to be in here, and certainly not like this, waiting in the dark like a statue. As if sensing her presence, his head turned, a slow, deliberate motion. His face was a pale mask in the gloom, but she could feel his eyes on her, two points of absolute darkness. He didn\u2019t speak. He didn\u2019t move another inch. The silence stretched, becoming a physical pressure. It was a hunter\u2019s silence, a predator\u2019s stillness. After a moment that felt like an eternity, he turned his head away, grabbed the handle of a bin, and wheeled it out a rear service exit with his strange, loping gait, the quiet rumble of the wheels fading down the service corridor.\n\nElodie didn\u2019t realize she\u2019d been holding her breath until it came out in a ragged, shuddering gasp. She backed out of the locker room, not bothering to retrieve her things. The casual explanation from her colleague\u2014*harmless, just hates the world*\u2014evaporated in a flash of pure, instinctual terror. It wasn\u2019t the world he hated. It was something far more specific. She fumbled for her phone as she hurried down the main hall, her footsteps echoing far too loudly in the empty space. She didn\u2019t know who to call or what to say. How do you report a look? How do you describe a silence that felt like a threat? She reached the brightly lit main entrance and all but ran to her car, the feeling of his eyes on her back all the way.\n\n* * *\n\nIt was after midnight when the junior analyst, eyes blurry from staring at a screen for ten hours straight, flagged a file. It was old, from fifteen years ago, buried in the QEH\u2019s archived complaints. The analyst printed it and, with a trembling hand, carried it to Detective Inspector Galt, who was still at her desk, staring at the three smiling photos on the whiteboard.\n\nGalt took the sheet. It was a formal grievance filed by a Mr. Robert Garris, concerning the end-of-life care of his mother, who had died of metastatic bone cancer. The complaint was a rambling screed of vitriol and grief, accusing the nurse on duty of being callous, of ignoring his mother\u2019s agonized pleas for more morphine in her final hours. He wrote that the nurse had smiled, a \u201cpitiless plastic smile,\u201d and told him that the dosage was fixed, that they had to manage the pain, not chase it. He accused her of letting his mother suffer, of being an angel of a false and inadequate mercy.\n\nGalt\u2019s blood ran cold as her eyes scanned the document, her focus narrowing to a single, crucial line. The name of the nurse who had signed the chart, the target of all that fifteen-year-old rage. She walked over to the whiteboard where Miller had tacked up a preliminary list of names transcribed from the freezer bags, names that were still just ghosts without stories attached. Her finger traced down the list. *Brenda. Sharon.* And there it was. *Mary-Anne. 11/09.* The date was from years ago, long before the recent spree. Galt stared at the complaint form and then at the board. It was more than a lead; it was a genesis. They had found the first wound, the one that had festered for a decade and a half before poisoning the world. And they had the name of the man who carried it.\n\n\u201cMiller,\u201d she said, her voice a low, dangerous command that cut through the tired hum of the station. \u201cGet me everything you can find on a Robert Garris. Right now.\u201d\n\nFrank Miller, fueled by stale coffee and adrenaline, moved with a speed that belied his exhaustion. The name was a key, and they threw it at every lock they had. Criminal records, credit history, vehicle registration, property deeds. For forty-five minutes, the name Robert Garris was a ghost. No criminal record. No current driver\u2019s license. No property in his name. It was as if he\u2019d fallen off the face of the earth after filing that complaint fifteen years ago.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s living off the grid,\u201d Miller said, frustration etching new lines on his face. \u201cPaying cash, staying in the shadows. He\u2019s been practicing this for years.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo one is a ghost, Frank,\u201d Galt insisted, pacing in front of the whiteboard. \u201cHe has to eat. He has to sleep. He has to work. Check government records. Employment insurance, tax rolls, social assistance. Go back fifteen years.\u201d\n\nIt was another twenty minutes before the hit came, so mundane and so shocking it left them all breathless. The analyst who found it just pointed at her screen, her mouth agape. Miller leaned over her shoulder, read it, and then looked at Galt, his face ashen.\n\n\u201cMa\u2019am,\u201d he said, his voice barely a whisper. \u201cRobert Garris has been on the payroll of the Queen Elizabeth Hospital for the last twelve years. He\u2019s a full-time porter.\u201d\n\nThe air in the room seemed to crystallize. The wolf was not just in the flock. He was being paid to walk among them, to push his carts through their halls, to breathe their air. He had been there all along, hiding in the one place they were trying to protect. Galt\u2019s mind flashed to the hospital bulletin, the warnings for staff to be vigilant. It was a mockery. They\u2019d been warned to watch the windows while the monster was already inside, mopping the floors.\n\nHer phone rang, a shrill, piercing sound that made them all jump. It was the station\u2019s front desk. \u201cDI Galt, there\u2019s a nurse on line one for you. An Elodie Michaud. Says she works at the QEH. She sounds\u2026 distressed. Says she needs to report something, but she\u2019s afraid she\u2019s just being paranoid.\u201d\n\nGalt grabbed the receiver, a terrible, cold certainty closing around her heart. \u201cPut her through,\u201d she said, her eyes meeting Miller\u2019s across the room. The hunt had just become a race."

I'm a nurse at the QEH. I... I know this sounds crazy, but I think I need to report something.\"\n\nIsolde Galt\u2019s entire body went on high alert, a hunter sensing its quarry just beyond the next rise. Every nerve ending seemed to hum with a terrible, vibrant energy. \"You're not crazy, Elodie,\" she said, her voice a lifeline of pure calm in a sea of static. \"I need you to talk to me. Tell me exactly what happened.\"\n\nElodie\u2019s words came out in a rush, a torrent of fear held back until this very moment. She described the locker room, the darkness, the hulking shape of the porter standing perfectly still. She tried to explain the look, the weight of his stare, the way the silence had felt not empty, but full of a terrible intent. As she spoke, Galt understood. This was not a report of a crime; it was a distress call from a target. Robert Garris had been evaluating her, assessing the threat she posed, and in that moment of being truly seen, he had marked her as his next project.\n\n\"Elodie, listen to me very carefully,\" Galt said, her tone leaving no room for doubt. \"Where are you right now?\"\n\n\"In my car. In the staff parking lot. I was about to go home.\"\n\n\"Stay in your car. Lock your doors. Do not leave that parking lot. There are officers on their way to you, and they will be there in minutes. They will approach your car. Do not get out until you see my face. Do you understand me?\" The instruction was absolute, a steel command wrapped in a blanket of reassurance. Elodie\u2019s shaky affirmative was all she needed to hear before she hung up, her mind already several steps ahead.\n\nThe briefing room exploded into controlled motion. Galt was the calm centre of the storm, issuing orders with a speed and precision that left no room for error. \"He's at the hospital, or was just minutes ago,\" she announced, her voice cutting through the exhausted quiet. \"Miller, I want a tactical team, silent deployment. Full containment of the QEH, every entrance, every exit, every service tunnel. Get his photo to every officer en route. He's Robert Garris, hospital porter. No sirens, no lights. I want that place sealed before he even knows we're there. Go!\"\n\nMiller was already on his radio, his voice a low, urgent litany of commands as he relayed the information, his professionalism a thin shield against the sheer horror of the situation. The abstract monster on the whiteboard had just become a man in green scrubs, walking the same halls as his next intended victim. The hunt was no longer a matter of sifting through old files; it was a race against a clock that was ticking down towards another unspeakable act of violence.\n\nIn the damp, echoing utility tunnels beneath the hospital, Rob felt the change. The encounter with the nurse, Elodie, was a fracture in the perfect, smooth surface of his world. She had seen him. The thought was a stone dropped into a still, black pond, the ripples spreading out to touch everything. For years, he had been a ghost, a function, a pair of hands pushing a cart. That was his power. Now, that power was compromised. A single person who saw the man instead of the uniform was a liability he could not afford. The loose, patient timeline he maintained for his collection snapped taut. Elodie Michaud was no longer a name on a potential list for some future date. She had become an immediate and urgent problem that required a permanent solution. He knew her schedule, he knew her car\u2014a small blue hatchback with a faded environmental sticker on the bumper. He had already traced her route home one evening last week, a preliminary survey for a project he\u2019d been considering. The details were important. They were seasoning. He had what he needed. His shift was over. It was time to go hunting.\n\nThe drive to the hospital was a blur of red lights that Galt barely registered. She was on the phone with Miller, who was coordinating the deployment from his own vehicle. \"We've got his old address from the complaint fifteen years ago,\" Miller said, his voice crackling with road noise. \"A derelict property on Weymouth Street, zoned commercial. Looks like an abandoned laundromat. I'm taking a secondary team to check it out. It could be his nest. You take the primary tactical team at the hospital.\"\n\n\"Agreed,\" Galt said, her hands tight on the wheel. \"Find his home, Frank. Find the proof.\" The thought of what that 'proof' might entail, the physical reality of the freezer and its contents, was a cold knot of dread in her gut. She pulled into a service lane behind the hospital, killing her headlights. Unmarked cars were already stationed at strategic points, and she could see the dark shapes of tactical officers melting into the shadows of the building. The hospital, usually a beacon of light, now looked like a fortress under silent siege.\n\nInside a cramped security office, the tactical team lead had the hospital blueprints spread across a desk. \"This place is a nightmare, Inspector,\" he said, his finger tracing the labyrinth of corridors. \"It's designed for public access, but it's full of service tunnels, old storage rooms, restricted areas. We can lock it down, but finding one man who knows it like the back of his hand is like finding a needle in a haystack made of needles.\"\n\n\"He's a porter,\" Galt stated, her eyes scanning the blueprints, seeing not just a map but a hunting ground. \"He operates in the filth, in the places no one wants to go. Laundry, bio-waste disposal, the sub-level maintenance tunnels. Have security pull his access card records for the last three hours. I want to know every door he's opened.\" Her gaze was drawn to the complex network of lines indicating the basement levels. The hospital had a subterranean world all its own, a place for secrets and forgotten things. \"That's where we'll find him. In the dark.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Sergeant Miller\u2019s team arrived at the address on Weymouth Street. The building was a carcass, a long-dead laundromat with boarded-up windows and peeling paint. It looked forgotten, but Miller saw the subtle signs of life. A new, heavy-duty padlock on a side service door, too robust for a derelict property. They cut through it with bolt cutters, the snap of the metal unnervingly loud in the night air. The interior smelled of dust, decay, and damp concrete. Footprints were visible in the grime, leading to a heavy door at the back of the building. It was padlocked from the outside. They breached it, their weapons raised as they descended a set of rickety wooden stairs into absolute darkness. Their flashlights sliced through the gloom, revealing a subterranean world. A stained mattress in the corner. Stacks of stolen medical textbooks. A wobbly card table with a hot plate. And in the far corner, a large, white chest freezer. It was humming. The low, guttural thrum vibrated through the concrete floor, a sound of preservation. A sound of abomination. Miller felt a wave of nausea, a sickness so profound it was almost spiritual. He knew, with chilling certainty, that he had found the monster\u2019s cathedral."

                                        "text": "The first thing Miller noticed was the smell. Not the overt scent of decay, which the cold contained, but something older. The smell of frost, stale meat, and a profound, lingering wrongness that seemed to seep from the concrete itself. He drew his weapon, the click of the safety seeming obscenely loud in the humming silence. A junior officer behind him gagged, turning away. Miller\u2019s gaze was fixed on the freezer. It was the altar in this subterranean church of horrors. He nodded to another officer, who approached it slowly, as if it were a bomb. With a deep breath and a grunt of effort, the officer lifted the heavy lid.\n\nA thick cloud of frigid air billowed out, carrying with it the full, undeniable truth. Inside, stacked with a disturbing, librarian\u2019s neatness, were dozens of small, vacuum-sealed plastic bags. They were opaque with frost, but their contents were unmistakable. Each was labelled with his spidery, cramped script. Miller could read the names on the top layer, names that were now seared into his memory. *Brenda. 14/08. Sharon. 29/08. Mary-Anne. 11/09. Cynthia. 23/09.* And there, on the very top, still separate and colder than the rest, was the small, hard packet from his most recent harvest. Janine O\u2019Dell. He had not had time to properly label and file her. Miller felt a hot, acidic bile rise in his throat. He keyed his radio, his voice strained, a wire pulled to its breaking point. \u201cInspector\u2026 you need to hear this. We found it. We\u2019re in his lair. We\u2019ve found the collection.\u201d\n\nGalt\u2019s sedan slid into the designated spot at the edge of the QEH staff parking lot. The vast expanse of asphalt was a grid of light and shadow, a perfect playing field for a predator. She spotted Elodie\u2019s blue hatchback three rows in. Flanked by two tactical officers who materialized from the darkness, she moved quickly and silently. She tapped on the driver\u2019s side window, holding up her badge. The locks clicked and the door swung open. Elodie Michaud looked out, her face a pale, tear-streaked mask in the dim interior light. Her terror was a living thing in the small car.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Elodie. You\u2019re safe now,\u201d Galt said, her voice a low, steady anchor. She slid into the passenger seat, the two officers taking up positions outside the car, their attention fixed on the surrounding darkness. \u201cTell me again. Everything.\u201d Elodie recounted the story, her voice trembling but clear, the trained mind of a nurse reciting symptoms. She focused on the stillness, the unnerving quiet of the man in the dark. As she spoke, Galt\u2019s radio crackled to life. It was Miller\u2019s choked voice, delivering the news from the monster\u2019s cathedral. *\u201cWe found it\u2026 We\u2019ve found the collection.\u201d* The words landed like body blows. The full, monstrous scope of his crusade was confirmed, stacked and frozen in a concrete basement.\n\nAt the far edge of the parking lot, concealed by a thicket of untrimmed cedar trees that bordered an adjacent property, Rob watched. He had seen the first unmarked car slide into place and had instantly understood. His hunt was over before it began. They knew. The nurse had talked. His cloak of invisibility had been torn away completely. He watched as Galt\u2019s car arrived, watched the officers materialize, watched the woman with the authoritative stride get into the car with Elodie. He was not a fool to be trapped in a burning building. He had already slipped out a rear service door the moment he felt the shift in the hospital\u2019s atmosphere. But now he was here, and she was there. Trapped. He could run, disappear into the night, find another island, another hospital, another collection. Or, he could finish the job. He looked at the woman in the car with the nurse, the one clearly in charge, the one who had hunted him down. His hatred, usually a slow-burning coal, roared into a furnace. It was not just about the nurses anymore. It was about anyone who stood with them. His eyes scanned the edge of the lot, and he saw it. A large, grey utility box. The main power junction for the parking area lighting. A new plan, born of rage and opportunity, bloomed in the darkness of his mind.\n\nGalt was processing Miller\u2019s words, a cold dread washing over her, when it happened. With a loud, metallic *clank* that echoed across the asphalt, the entire parking lot was plunged into absolute, disorienting blackness. The tall sodium lamps went out in a single, dying hum. Shouts erupted from the tactical officers, their world suddenly reduced to what their flashlights could pierce. The interior of the car became a claustrophobic box, the windows reflecting only their own startled faces in the dim emergency light of Galt\u2019s radio.\n\nBefore anyone could react to the new threat, a thunderous crash came from directly above them. Not a gunshot, but a massive, concussive impact on the roof of the small hatchback, making the entire frame groan. Elodie screamed, a raw, piercing sound of pure terror. Galt drew her sidearm, her flashlight beam dancing wildly, trying to penetrate the oppressive dark outside the car. Then came a new sound, a sound of grotesque strength and horrifying intent. The screech of tortured metal. She looked at her door, where the top of the window frame was beginning to bend inwards, pulled by an impossible force. Long, three-jointed fingers, thick and powerful as steel hooks, curled over the buckling frame, the nails yellow as old horn. Robert Garris hadn\u2019t gone for the nurse. He was on the roof of the car, tearing his way in, and he was coming for the detective."

The shriek of tearing metal was the sound of the world ending, a sound punctuated by Elodie\u2019s raw, animal screams beside her. Galt shoved the younger woman\u2019s head down toward the floor mat with a force that was almost a blow. \u201cStay down!\u201d she roared, the command a guttural blast of authority in the claustrophobic space. Her own weapon was up, a steady point of purpose in the chaos, but she had no shot. The roof was caving in, the windshield was fracturing into a thousand spidery cracks, and the monstrous fingers curling over the window frame were a promise of what was to come. He was peeling the car open like a can.\n\nThe blackness outside the car was absolute for a heart-stopping second, and then it was shattered by blades of pure white light. The tactical officers, blind but not helpless, activated their weapon-mounted lights, sweeping the area, trying to find the source of the attack. The beams converged on the small blue hatchback, illuminating a scene from a nightmare. There, crouched on the buckling roof of the car, was Robert Garris. He was no longer the invisible porter, the shuffling, downtrodden man in green scrubs. He was a leviathan revealed. His face was a mask of pure, contorted rage, his thin lips pulled back from his grey gums in a soundless snarl. His immense frame, coiled with a terrifying, brachial strength, was braced as he ripped at the door frame, his eyes, those pits of glittering black obsidian, fixed on Galt inside the car.\n\nGalt didn\u2019t wait for an invitation. She shoved her shoulder against the passenger door, forcing it open against the groaning chassis, and scrambled out into the night, using the car as a shield. She came up into a low crouch at the rear of the vehicle, her pistol held in a two-handed grip, the tactical lights from her team throwing her own long, dancing shadow across the asphalt. She could see him clearly now, a monster bathed in the harsh glare of judgement. He saw her at the same moment. He abandoned his efforts to tear the door off its hinges, his singular focus shifting to the woman who had unearthed him. With a roar that was less human and more the sound of a rockslide, a raw, guttural expression of pure hatred, he launched himself from the roof of the car, not away from the lights, but directly at her.\n\n\"Police! Drop it!\" The words were a formality, a required piece of procedure shouted into the face of an apocalypse. He was a two-hundred-and-fifty-pound projectile of muscle and bone, his long arms reaching for her, his three-jointed fingers spread like talons. Galt stood her ground. Time seemed to slow, the space between them compressing. She fired. The first shot struck him high in the chest, a solid, thudding impact that would have stopped any normal man. It barely broke his stride. He staggered, but his immense forward momentum carried him on. She fired again. And again. The bullets slammed into his torso, each one a hammer blow. He gave a final, shuddering grunt, a sound of surprise and fury, his eyes still locked on hers, full of a hatred that even death could not immediately extinguish. He collapsed less than three feet from her, hitting the pavement with a heavy, final thud that seemed to shake the ground.\n\nAn instant of deafening silence followed the final gunshot, broken only by the high-pitched ringing in Galt\u2019s ears and the terrified, hiccupping sobs coming from inside the car. The parking lot was a tableau, frozen in the stark white beams of the tactical lights. Galt stood over the body, her pistol still aimed at the centre mass of the motionless giant, her breath coming in ragged plumes of white in the cold night air. The tactical team swarmed forward, shouting commands, securing the scene, their professionalism a stark contrast to the primal violence that had just unfolded. Someone gently took Elodie from the car, wrapping her in a blanket, her body shaking uncontrollably.\n\nGalt lowered her weapon, the adrenaline beginning its slow, sickening retreat, leaving a hollow ache in its place. She looked down at Robert Garris. In death, the monstrous rage had drained from his features, leaving behind the face of a large, empty man. A man whose entire existence had been powered by a fifteen-year-old wound and the drone of a basement freezer. The long, rambling sentence of his hatred had finally found its period. From her radio, she could hear the distant, tinny voice of Frank Miller, shouting for a situation report. She raised the radio to her lips, her gaze still on the body at her feet. \"Suspect is down,\" she said, her voice steady, betraying none of the tremor she felt deep in her bones. \"The hum has stopped.\""

The strobing tactical lights carved the scene into disjointed fragments of action: an officer shouting into a radio, a paramedic rushing toward Elodie, the glint of shattered glass on dark asphalt. Galt\u2019s hands, which had been so steady, began to tremble, a violent, delayed reaction to the adrenaline that had held them rigid. She forced them to still, reloading her weapon with practiced, mechanical movements that belied the tremor in her soul. She looked down at the dead man. The monster who had torn a car apart with his bare hands was gone, replaced by a large, pathetic corpse bleeding out on the pavement. The hatred that had animated him, that had given him his preternatural strength, had vanished, leaving only a hollow, empty vessel.\n\nSergeant Miller\u2019s car skidded to a halt a short time later, its headlights cutting a swathe through the organized chaos. He stumbled out, his face pale and drawn not from the scene before him, but from the one he had just left. He saw the body bag, the mangled car, and then Galt, standing alone near the edge of the police cordon, staring up at the brightly lit windows of the hospital. He walked over to her, the smell of the basement\u2014of frost and old blood\u2014still clinging to his clothes. He didn't need to ask what happened. He had heard the gunshots over the radio.\n\n\u201cIt was\u2026 a museum, ma\u2019am,\u201d he said, his voice raspy. \u201cHe had them all. Labelled. By date.\u201d He didn\u2019t need to say what \u2018them\u2019 were. They both knew. The stolen voices, the punctuation marks in his long sentence of hate. \u201cAll those years, he was just down there, hating and remembering. It\u2019s hard to believe a man can hold that much darkness inside him.\u201d\n\nGalt didn\u2019t turn to look at him. Her gaze remained fixed on the hospital, a place of healing that had harboured a festering sickness for over a decade. \u201cIt isn\u2019t the darkness that\u2019s hard to believe, Frank,\u201d she said, her voice low and weary. \u201cIt\u2019s how long it can go unnoticed. How easily we can walk right past it every single day.\u201d She thought of the community garden, of the rich, dark earth, and how this man had cultivated his own terrible garden in a basement, feeding it with pain instead of water, growing monuments of silence instead of life. The contrast was a physical ache in her chest.\n\nHer eyes found Elodie Michaud, wrapped in a thick blanket, speaking to a counsellor near an ambulance, her small frame still wracked with shudders. The young nurse had survived, but Galt knew that the shadow of this night would follow her for the rest of her life. Galt walked over, her presence cutting through the procedural bubble around the young woman. She knelt, bringing herself to eye level with the traumatized nurse. \u201cHe can\u2019t hurt you anymore,\u201d she said, the words feeling horribly inadequate. \u201cWe will make sure you have everything you need. Whatever it takes, for as long as it takes.\u201d It was a promise made not by a Detective Inspector, but by Isolde Galt, the philanthropist, the woman who believed that the only way to fight the rot was to relentlessly, painstakingly, cultivate the good. It was the only cure she knew."

                                        "text": "The world snapped back into sharp, ugly focus. The strobing tactical lights carved the scene into disjointed fragments of action: an officer shouting into a radio, a paramedic rushing toward Elodie, the glint of shattered glass on dark asphalt. Galt\u2019s hands, which had been so steady, began to tremble, a violent, delayed reaction to the adrenaline that had held them rigid. She forced them to still, reloading her weapon with practiced, mechanical movements that belied the tremor in her soul. She looked down at the dead man. The monster who had torn a car apart with his bare hands was gone, replaced by a large, pathetic corpse bleeding out on the pavement. The hatred that had animated him, that had given him his preternatural strength, had vanished, leaving only a hollow, empty vessel.\n\nSergeant Miller\u2019s car skidded to a halt a short time later, its headlights cutting a swathe through the organized chaos. He stumbled out, his face pale and drawn not from the scene before him, but from the one he had just left. He saw the body bag, the mangled car, and then Galt, standing alone near the edge of the police cordon, staring up at the brightly lit windows of the hospital. He walked over to her, the smell of the basement\u2014of frost and old blood\u2014still clinging to his clothes. He didn't need to ask what happened. He had heard the gunshots over the radio.\n\n\u201cIt was\u2026 a museum, ma\u2019am,\u201d he said, his voice raspy. \u201cHe had them all. Labelled. By date.\u201d He didn\u2019t need to say what \u2018them\u2019 were. They both knew. The stolen voices, the punctuation marks in his long sentence of hate. \u201cAll those years, he was just down there, hating and remembering. It\u2019s hard to believe a man can hold that much darkness inside him.\u201d\n\nGalt didn\u2019t turn to look at him. Her gaze remained fixed on the hospital, a place of healing that had harboured a festering sickness for over a decade. \u201cIt isn\u2019t the darkness that\u2019s hard to believe, Frank,\u201d she said, her voice low and weary. \u201cIt\u2019s how long it can go unnoticed. How easily we can walk right past it every single day.\u201d She thought of the community garden, of the rich, dark earth, and how this man had cultivated his own terrible garden in a basement, feeding it with pain instead of water, growing monuments of silence instead of life. The contrast was a physical ache in her chest.\n\nHer eyes found Elodie Michaud, wrapped in a thick blanket, speaking to a counsellor near an ambulance, her small frame still wracked with shudders. The young nurse had survived, but Galt knew that the shadow of this night would follow her for the rest of her life. Galt walked over, her presence cutting through the procedural bubble around the young woman. She knelt, bringing herself to eye level with the traumatized nurse. \u201cHe can\u2019t hurt you anymore,\u201d she said, the words feeling horribly inadequate. \u201cWe will make sure you have everything you need. Whatever it takes, for as long as it takes.\u201d It was a promise made not by a Detective Inspector, but by Isolde Galt, the philanthropist, the woman who believed that the only way to fight the rot was to relentlessly, painstakingly, cultivate the good. It was the only cure she knew.\n\nAs the first hint of a bruised, purple dawn began to lighten the eastern sky, Galt stood alone after the last ambulance had gone. The crime scene was a sterile field of yellow tape and official vehicles. She had taken a life. It was a clean shoot, justified a dozen times over, but the fact of it settled on her like a shroud. It was the ultimate bandage, a reactive, violent solution to a problem she would have given anything to have cured decades ago, in a quiet hospital room filled with a grieving boy and his dying mother. The work wasn't over. In a basement on Weymouth Street, a freezer full of frozen evidence was waiting. Each packet was a cold case, a ghost waiting for its name to be spoken, its story to be told. The harvest was over, but now, the long, slow work of giving back the stolen voices was about to begin."

                                        "text": "### Chapter 6\n\nThe sun rose on a city that was, for the most part, completely unaware of the abyss that had opened and closed in its midst. At the Charlottetown police station, the morning shift arrived to the smell of burnt coffee and the hushed, grim atmosphere of a battlefield after the fighting has stopped. The main briefing room, which had been the vibrant nerve centre of a manhunt, now felt like a wake. The whiteboard was a monument, with the names of Brenda, Sharon, and Janine underlined in black, and the name Robert Garris circled and slashed through with a single, vicious red line. Galt stood before it, a fresh mug of coffee in her hand that she had yet to touch. She had been here for hours, a silent sentinel watching the dawn crawl over the city, feeling the weight of the silence that Garris had left in his wake, a silence far more profound than the one he had so violently imposed on his victims.\n\nFrank Miller came in, his face the colour of old parchment, his uniform looking two sizes too big for him. He had spent the last four hours at the morgue, overseeing the transfer of evidence from the derelict laundromat. He didn't look at the whiteboard. He couldn\u2019t. His gaze was fixed on a point somewhere in the middle distance, as if he were still staring into the frigid, humming darkness of that basement freezer. He slumped into a chair at the briefing table, the plastic creaking under his weight. Galt didn\u2019t have to ask. She could see the horror radiating from him in waves.\n\n\u201cThe lab started the initial inventory,\u201d he said, his voice a dead, flat monotone. \u201cThirty-seven, ma\u2019am. Thirty-seven bags. Some of them\u2026 some of them are over a decade old. The dates go all the way back. Mary-Anne was one of the first. He was just getting started. The precision improved over time, the packaging got better. He treated them like\u2026 like biological specimens he was archiving for a study.\u201d He finally looked at Galt, his eyes hollowed out, dark pools of exhaustion and disgust. \u201cHow does a man do that? How does he live like that, with that\u2026 humming in his basement, for all those years, and just go to work every day?\u201d\n\nGalt turned from the board and looked at her sergeant, seeing not just a subordinate but a good man who had been forced to look into the void. \u201cBecause the work was the only thing that made him feel alive, Frank. The hatred was his fuel, and the collection was his proof. Proof that he had power over the one thing he felt had powerless over him: the quiet, smiling mercy of a nurse.\u201d She walked over and sat down opposite him, her voice dropping, becoming a tool to pull him back from the edge. \u201cThey are not specimens. They are not his collection. They are thirty-seven women whose families need to know what happened to them. That is our job now. We are no longer hunting a monster. We are identifying his victims. We\u2019re giving them back their names.\u201d\n\nThe order galvanized the exhausted team. The focus shifted from tactics and pursuit to the painstaking, heartbreaking work of forensic anthropology and cold case investigation. They began the mammoth task of building a timeline, matching the spidery dates on the frosted bags to missing persons reports from across the Maritimes and beyond. Every name\u2014*Cynthia, Heather, Karen, Louise*\u2014was a ghost story waiting for its first and final chapter to be written. Galt coordinated it all, her mind a clear, sharp instrument of logic and process, even as the image of Garris\u2019s face, contorted in a final rictus of rage, flashed behind her eyes every time she blinked. She had taken a life to save others, but the grim arithmetic of her profession did little to quiet the deep, resonant toll of that final, violent act.\n\nHours later, she found herself walking through the neat, cedar-lined paths of the community garden. The sun was high and warm, a stark contrast to the bone-deep chill that had settled in her marrow. The teenagers she had been teaching were there, laughing as they wrestled with a tangled garden hose, their lives blessedly untouched by the darkness she trafficked in. She knelt, her fingers sinking into the rich, dark soil of a raised bed. The earth smelled of life, of possibility, of things growing towards the light. It was the absolute antithesis of the cold, sterile basement on Weymouth Street. She had told her colleagues that philanthropy was proactive policing, a cure instead of a bandage. But she knew now, with a clarity that was both terrible and freeing, that it wasn\u2019t that simple. You could build a thousand gardens, but it wouldn't stop a man like Robert Garris, a man whose soul was a barren, salted field where nothing good could ever grow. You had to nurture the soil, yes. But you also had to be willing to stand on the wall and face the blight that threatened to consume it all.\n\nHer phone buzzed, pulling her from her reverie. It was the young analyst from the station, her voice lacking its usual nervous tremor, replaced now with a quiet, somber professionalism. \u201cInspector? We have one. A positive ID, we think. We ran the DNA from one of the first unidentified bags, a \u2018Cynthia, 23/09,\u2019 against the national database. We got a familial match to a couple in Digby, Nova Scotia. They filed a missing persons report for their daughter, Cynthia Morrell, almost two years ago. The date matches.\u201d Galt listened, her heart a heavy, leaden thing in her chest. Cynthia Morrell. A home care nurse who worked with palliative patients. She had vanished after a late-night house call. Local police had suspected she\u2019d run off, tired of a difficult life and a thankless job. The case had been cold for eighteen months.\n\nA life, sketched out in a few database fields. She was no longer just a name on a bag, a piece of frozen evidence. She was Cynthia Morrell from Digby. A daughter. A caregiver. Another woman whose compassion had made her a target for a man who had none. Galt closed her eyes, picturing the young woman, imagining the little humming sound she might have made as she checked on a patient, a song of life so easily, so brutally silenced. One voice. They had found one. It was a victory that felt exactly like a defeat. It was the first step on a long, hard road of delivering unbearable news to families who had clung to the thinnest slivers of hope. The harvest was over. But the bitter, sorrowful work of counting the dead had just begun."

                                        "text": "\"Thank you,\" Galt said, her voice quiet, before ending the call. She remained kneeling in the rich, dark earth, the warmth of the sun on her back a stark, almost offensive contrast to the ice-cold dread that had just been confirmed over the phone. Cynthia Morrell. The name hung in the air, a fragile, tragic thing. A home care nurse. A woman who spent her days in the quiet, lonely rooms of the dying, offering a final measure of comfort. She was the very embodiment of the mercy Robert Garris had so despised. The bitter irony was a taste like rust in Galt\u2019s mouth. She looked at the kale seedlings she had planted, their leaves unfurling toward the light, so full of simple, uncomplicated life. This garden was a place of beginnings, but her work now was solely concerned with endings.\n\nBack at the station, the grim machinery of the investigation had already ground into a new gear. The frenetic energy of the hunt was gone, replaced by the somber, methodical hum of processing a mass casualty event. Whiteboards were covered in lists, cross-referencing dates from the freezer bags with a multi-province database of missing women. Each potential match was a deep dive into another family\u2019s private tragedy, a new wound to be re-opened. The air was thick with the quiet, respectful murmurs of officers speaking to other jurisdictions, requesting dental records, DNA samples, and old case files. It was a factory of sorrow, and Isolde Galt was its reluctant forewoman.\n\nShe found Miller in the small station kitchen, staring into a cup of black coffee as if it held the answers to the universe. He looked up as she entered, his eyes bloodshot and ancient. \"They're still taking things out of the basement,\" he said, his voice a gravelly whisper. \"The textbooks... he'd written in the margins. Next to diagrams of the glossopharyngeal nerve, he'd just written the word 'liar' over and over again. And in a section on pain receptors, he'd underlined a passage about chronic suffering and written, 'she smiled.' Just that. 'She smiled.'\" The detail was so small, so intimate, it was more chilling than the mountain of physical evidence. It was a direct look into the heart of his fifteen-year obsession, the single moment that had curdled his grief into a world-ending poison. Miller shook his head slowly. \"He wasn't just killing them, ma'am. He was trying to kill a memory. Thirty-seven times.\"\n\nGalt took the file for Cynthia Morrell and retreated to the quiet of her own office, closing the door on the symphony of grief being assembled outside. The notification was the next step. It was a task usually delegated to officers in the correct jurisdiction, a formal, terrible message to be delivered by strangers. She made the call to the RCMP detachment in Digby, her voice a cool, professional instrument as she relayed the confirmed DNA match and the context of the homicide investigation. She gave them the facts, devoid of the horror, but she could feel the weight of the coming conversation pressing down on her. Somewhere in a small Nova Scotian town, a mother and father who had spent two years cycling between desperate hope and numb resignation were about to have their world irrevocably shattered. She had caught the monster, but her victory was their devastation.\n\nAfter the call, she sat at her desk, the silence of her office a stark contrast to the hum that had defined her thoughts for days. She looked down at her hands. They were smudged with the dark, rich soil of the garden, but beneath the dirt, she could still feel the phantom recoil of her pistol, the grim finality of the trigger pulls. These were the hands that funded youth centres and planted vegetables, and they were the hands that had ended a man's life. The contradiction was the very essence of her existence, the razor's edge she walked every day. She opened a drawer and pulled out a thick binder, its cover simply stamped with the Galt Foundation logo. She flipped through the pages, through proposals for literacy programs, funding requests for addiction counselling, blueprints for a new women's shelter. It was her catechism, her shield against the cynicism that threatened to consume her. She could not undo the horror that Robert Garris had unleashed, and she could not bring back the thirty-seven women he had silenced. All she could do was continue to build, to cultivate, to stubbornly, defiantly, pour life and resources into the very communities that darkness sought to devour. It was not a cure, she knew. It was just an act of faith."

                                        "text": "The quiet in her office was a physical presence, a heavy blanket that smothered the procedural noise from the bullpen outside. Galt sat motionless, her hand still resting on the phone. The call to Digby was complete, a sterile exchange of information that had set in motion a small, personal apocalypse for the Morrell family. She pictured the two RCMP officers, their car pulling up to a quiet house, the grim set of their jaws as they walked to the door. She imagined the polite knock, the initial confusion on the faces of Cynthia's parents turning to a dawning, uncomprehending terror as the officers spoke the words she herself had put in their mouths. *Remains have been located. Homicide investigation.* The language of the profession was a cold, inadequate shield against the raw, howling grief that would follow. The system was designed to deliver facts, not to absorb pain. The pain was an externality, a byproduct left for the families to manage alone, long after the files were closed.\n\nShe finally rose and walked back out into the main briefing room. The energy had shifted. The initial shock had given way to a grim, focused industry. A team of analysts sat at a bank of computers, their faces illuminated by the blue glow of screens displaying missing persons reports, their quiet keyboard taps a counterpoint to the hushed phone conversations of detectives coordinating with other forces. Frank Miller stood before the whiteboard, which was now covered in a sprawling web of names, dates, and locations. He was pinning up another photograph, a grainy driver\u2019s license photo of a woman with a weary smile. \u201cWe think we have a match for \u2018Karen, 03/12\u2019,\u201d he said, not turning around. \u201cKaren Crosby. Paramedic from Saint John. Disappeared seven years ago. Her car was found abandoned near the Reversing Falls. They assumed it was a suicide.\u201d He finally turned, his eyes finding Galt\u2019s. \u201cHe wrote in her file, too. The one he made. Just a single sentence. \u2018She told me to be brave.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe simple, damning quote hung in the air, a testament to a kindness weaponized by Garris\u2019s broken mind. Galt felt a fresh wave of revulsion, not just for the killer, but for the random, cruel nature of his selections. These women had not been chosen for any malice on their part, but for the very best of what they were. They were punished for their compassion. She looked at the sprawling map of tragedy on the board, at the dozens of names that were still just placeholders, ghosts waiting for their stories. It was not enough to send files and notifications. That was a bureaucrat\u2019s solution. She saw each name not as a case, but as a debt. A debt of dignity. \u201cFrank,\u201d she said, her voice cutting through the room\u2019s somber hum, \u201cI want a lead liaison assigned to each confirmed victim. Not just a call to the local jurisdiction. I want a single point of contact for every family, from now until the end of the judicial process. They will not be passed from department to department. They will have a name and a number here. We will walk them through all of it.\u201d Miller nodded, a flicker of his old, solid self returning to his eyes. It was a Galt solution: methodical, human, and absolute.\n\nThat evening, long after most had gone home, Galt found herself back at the community garden. The air was cool and smelled of damp earth and the promise of autumn\u2019s end. Under the pale light of a solitary streetlamp, the neat rows of sleeping plants looked like a promise kept. She knelt, her fingers brushing the delicate fronds of a carrot top. This place was a quiet rebellion against the chaos. But it wasn\u2019t enough. She thought of the thirty-seven women, all of them healers, all of them silenced for the crime of offering comfort. Their voices were gone, but their purpose, their calling, did not have to die with them. An idea began to form, a plan that was both a memorial and a defiance. It was a project for the Galt Foundation, a perfect fusion of her two worlds. It would be a scholarship fund, endowed in perpetuity. The \u201cThirty-Seven Voices Scholarship,\u201d for nursing and paramedic students across the Maritimes. Their names would be attached not to a gruesome police file, but to the education of a new generation of healers. It would not bring them back. It would not erase the pain. But it would be a cure of a different kind. It would ensure that for every voice Robert Garris had stolen, a new one would be trained to speak words of comfort into the darkness, a quiet, constant, and unending reply to his hateful hum."

                                        "text": "### Chapter 7\n\nA week had passed. The silence left by Robert Garris\u2019s death was not a peaceful one. It was a vacuum, and into it rushed the noise of bureaucracy, of media speculation, and of a grief so profound and wide-ranging that it had settled over Charlottetown like a permanent, low-hanging fog. The city\u2019s cherished sense of small-town safety had been shattered, replaced by a grim new notoriety. The newspapers had christened him, with their typical ghoulish flair, the \u201cLaundromat Butcher.\u201d His face, a grainy, fifteen-year-old DMV photo, was plastered everywhere, a bland and forgettable visage that made the horror of his actions feel all the more obscene.\n\nIn the police station, the briefing room had been transformed. The \"hunt\" was over, but the work had only intensified. The murder board was now a vast grid of sorrow, thirty-seven columns waiting to be filled. Ten names had been officially identified, their smiling photos a gut-wrenching contrast to the clinical details of their disappearances. Miller was the reluctant master of this domain, a gaunt Cerberus guarding the gates of a paper hell. He moved with a slow, deliberate exhaustion, the horror of the basement having etched itself into the lines around his eyes. He rarely spoke of what he\u2019d seen, but Galt saw it every time he pinned a new photo to the board, his hand lingering for a moment as if in silent apology.\n\nGalt herself moved through the storm on a separate, parallel track. She had sat for her official inquiry, a three-hour debriefing in a sterile room with two stone-faced internal affairs officers. She recounted the events of the parking lot in the flat, precise language of a police report. *\u201cThe suspect initiated a physical assault with lethal intent\u2026 I perceived a clear and present danger to myself and a civilian\u2026 I discharged my firearm until the threat was neutralized.\u201d* Each sanitized phrase was a betrayal of the chaotic, terrifying reality\u2014the shriek of tearing metal, the raw animal roar of the man, the percussive kick of her weapon, the final, heavy thud of his body hitting the asphalt. The inquiry had cleared her in under an hour, a procedural necessity that felt like a profound irrelevance. Neutralizing the threat had been the simple part. The true challenge was navigating the vast, echoing crater his evil had left behind.\n\nHer answer to that challenge took shape in a polished boardroom overlooking the Charlottetown harbour. The trustees of the Galt Foundation, men and women of finance and law accustomed to discussing capital gains and tax-efficient donations, sat in stunned silence as Isolde laid out her proposal. She spoke not as a police inspector, but as the foundation\u2019s chair, her voice devoid of emotion yet vibrating with an unshakeable resolve. She proposed the \u201cThirty-Seven Voices Scholarship,\u201d a permanent endowment to fund the education of nursing and paramedic students across the Maritime provinces.\n\n\u201cHis goal was to silence the voices of caregivers,\u201d she concluded, her gaze sweeping across the table, meeting each of their eyes. \u201cHe failed. This foundation will ensure that for every one voice he took, a dozen more will be amplified. Their names will not be footnotes in a monster\u2019s story. They will be the foundation of a legacy of healing. We will not let his hatred have the last word.\u201d There was no argument. The motion passed unanimously, a quiet, somber consensus in the face of a grief that demanded action.\n\nThat afternoon, Galt drove to Elodie Michaud\u2019s apartment. She found the young nurse surrounded by cardboard boxes, her small living room a chaotic landscape of a life in mid-flight. Elodie was pale, her movements skittish, a deer perpetually sensing a predator that was no longer there. She had quit her job at the QEH. The thought of walking those halls, of seeing the locker room where he had stood watching her from the darkness, was an impossibility.\n\n\u201cI keep hearing it,\u201d Elodie said, her voice a fragile whisper as she hugged a mug of tea to her chest. \u201cThe sound of the metal. The way the roof\u2026 buckled.\u201d She looked at Galt, her eyes wide with a question that had clearly been tormenting her. \u201cWhy did he come after you? He was on the roof, he could have\u2026 but he came for you.\u201d\n\nGalt sat on a sealed box, the makeshift seat bringing her to the younger woman\u2019s level. She chose her words with a surgeon\u2019s care. \u201cBecause his hatred wasn\u2019t just for nurses anymore, Elodie. It had grown. In the end, he hated anyone who stood in his way, anyone who tried to stop him. Most of all, he hated being seen. You were the first person in a long time who truly saw him, and that made him afraid. It made him clumsy. You saved your own life long before I ever got there.\u201d The words were a partial truth, a therapeutic construction designed to give the traumatized woman a sliver of agency in a situation where she\u2019d had none. It seemed to land. A flicker of something other than fear crossed Elodie\u2019s face, a hint of understanding that Galt hoped would one day grow into a scar, rather than an open wound. She stayed for an hour, not talking about the case, but about moving companies and new neighbourhoods, the simple, forward-looking logistics of a life that had to continue.\n\nThe next day, Galt did something far outside the bounds of protocol. She drove to Digby. She found the Morrells\u2019 house without trouble, a neat little bungalow with a carefully tended garden out front, now succumbing to the first frosts of the season. An elderly couple answered the door, their faces a matched set of exhausted grief. They had been expecting a call, perhaps, but not a personal visit from the Detective Inspector from Prince Edward Island. She introduced herself simply, and they invited her in with the weary resignation of people for whom the worst has already happened. They sat in a living room filled with photos of their daughter. Cynthia laughing on a beach. Cynthia in her nursing school graduation cap. Cynthia holding a grumpy-looking cat.\n\nThey didn\u2019t ask for details about how she died. They had been spared the worst of it by the sensitive RCMP liaison. Instead, her mother, a small woman with her daughter\u2019s kind eyes, asked a single, heartbreaking question. \u201cWas she scared?\u201d Galt thought of the scene in the basement, of the detached, clinical way he had handled his \u2018specimens.\u2019 She thought of the scalpel, of his obsession with precision. \u201cThe medical examiner believes it would have been\u2026 very fast,\u201d she lied, the falsehood a small, final mercy she could offer. \u201cI don\u2019t believe she would have been aware for very long.\u201d\n\nIt was then that she told them about the scholarship. She explained that their daughter\u2019s name, along with the others, would be honoured, used to help young people pursue the same calling Cynthia had. For the first time, a flicker of light broke through the suffocating gloom in the room. Cynthia\u2019s father, who had not spoken a word, finally looked at Galt, tears streaming silently down his weathered face. \u201cShe would have liked that,\u201d he rasped. \u201cShe always wanted to help.\u201d Galt left an hour later, carrying the weight of their gratitude and their grief. It was a burden heavier than any case file, more real than any internal inquiry. As she drove back toward the ferry, she knew that this was the work that mattered. Not just catching the killer, but tending to the wounds left in his wake, one quiet conversation, one scholarship, one act of defiant remembrance at a time. The hum of his hatred had been silenced, but the quiet work of answering it would go on for a very long time."

                                        "text": "A week had passed. The silence left by Robert Garris\u2019s death was not a peaceful one. It was a vacuum, and into it rushed the noise of bureaucracy, of media speculation, and of a grief so profound and wide-ranging that it had settled over Charlottetown like a permanent, low-hanging fog. The city\u2019s cherished sense of small-town safety had been shattered, replaced by a grim new notoriety. The newspapers had christened him, with their typical ghoulish flair, the \u201cLaundromat Butcher.\u201d His face, a grainy, fifteen-year-old DMV photo, was plastered everywhere, a bland and forgettable visage that made the horror of his actions feel all the more obscene.\n\nIn the police station, the briefing room had been transformed. The \"hunt\" was over, but the work had only intensified. The murder board was now a vast grid of sorrow, thirty-seven columns waiting to be filled. Ten names had been officially identified, their smiling photos a gut-wrenching contrast to the clinical details of their disappearances. Miller was the reluctant master of this domain, a gaunt Cerberus guarding the gates of a paper hell. He moved with a slow, deliberate exhaustion, the horror of the basement having etched itself into the lines around his eyes. He rarely spoke of what he\u2019d seen, but Galt saw it every time he pinned a new photo to the board, his hand lingering for a moment as if in silent apology.\n\nGalt herself moved through the storm on a separate, parallel track. She had sat for her official inquiry, a three-hour debriefing in a sterile room with two stone-faced internal affairs officers. She recounted the events of the parking lot in the flat, precise language of a police report. *\u201cThe suspect initiated a physical assault with lethal intent\u2026 I perceived a clear and present danger to myself and a civilian\u2026 I discharged my firearm until the threat was neutralized.\u201d* Each sanitized phrase was a betrayal of the chaotic, terrifying reality\u2014the shriek of tearing metal, the raw animal roar of the man, the percussive kick of her weapon, the final, heavy thud of his body hitting the asphalt. The inquiry had cleared her in under an hour, a procedural necessity that felt like a profound irrelevance. Neutralizing the threat had been the simple part. The true challenge was navigating the vast, echoing crater his evil had left behind.\n\nHer answer to that challenge took shape in a polished boardroom overlooking the Charlottetown harbour. The trustees of the Galt Foundation, men and women of finance and law accustomed to discussing capital gains and tax-efficient donations, sat in stunned silence as Isolde laid out her proposal. She spoke not as a police inspector, but as the foundation\u2019s chair, her voice devoid of emotion yet vibrating with an unshakeable resolve. She proposed the \u201cThirty-Seven Voices Scholarship,\u201d a permanent endowment to fund the education of nursing and paramedic students across the Maritime provinces.\n\n\u201cHis goal was to silence the voices of caregivers,\u201d she concluded, her gaze sweeping across the table, meeting each of their eyes. \u201cHe failed. This foundation will ensure that for every one voice he took, a dozen more will be amplified. Their names will not be footnotes in a monster\u2019s story. They will be the foundation of a legacy of healing. We will not let his hatred have the last word.\u201d There was no argument. The motion passed unanimously, a quiet, somber consensus in the face of a grief that demanded action.\n\nThat afternoon, Galt drove to Elodie Michaud\u2019s apartment. She found the young nurse surrounded by cardboard boxes, her small living room a chaotic landscape of a life in mid-flight. Elodie was pale, her movements skittish, a deer perpetually sensing a predator that was no longer there. She had quit her job at the QEH. The thought of walking those halls, of seeing the locker room where he had stood watching her from the darkness, was an impossibility.\n\n\u201cI keep hearing it,\u201d Elodie said, her voice a fragile whisper as she hugged a mug of tea to her chest. \u201cThe sound of the metal. The way the roof\u2026 buckled.\u201d She looked at Galt, her eyes wide with a question that had clearly been tormenting her. \u201cWhy did he come after you? He was on the roof, he could have\u2026 but he came for you.\u201d\n\nGalt sat on a sealed box, the makeshift seat bringing her to the younger woman\u2019s level. She chose her words with a surgeon\u2019s care. \u201cBecause his hatred wasn\u2019t just for nurses anymore, Elodie. It had grown. In the end, he hated anyone who stood in his way, anyone who tried to stop him. Most of all, he hated being seen. You were the first person in a long time who truly saw him, and that made him afraid. It made him clumsy. You saved your own life long before I ever got there.\u201d The words were a partial truth, a therapeutic construction designed to give the traumatized woman a sliver of agency in a situation where she\u2019d had none. It seemed to land. A flicker of something other than fear crossed Elodie\u2019s face, a hint of understanding that Galt hoped would one day grow into a scar, rather than an open wound. She stayed for an hour, not talking about the case, but about moving companies and new neighbourhoods, the simple, forward-looking logistics of a life that had to continue.\n\nThe next day, Galt did something far outside the bounds of protocol. She drove to Digby. She found the Morrells\u2019 house without trouble, a neat little bungalow with a carefully tended garden out front, now succumbing to the first frosts of the season. An elderly couple answered the door, their faces a matched set of exhausted grief. They had been expecting a call, perhaps, but not a personal visit from the Detective Inspector from Prince Edward Island. She introduced herself simply, and they invited her in with the weary resignation of people for whom the worst has already happened. They sat in a living room filled with photos of their daughter. Cynthia laughing on a beach. Cynthia in her nursing school graduation cap. Cynthia holding a grumpy-looking cat.\n\nThey didn\u2019t ask for details about how she died. They had been spared the worst of it by the sensitive RCMP liaison. Instead, her mother, a small woman with her daughter\u2019s kind eyes, asked a single, heartbreaking question. \u201cWas she scared?\u201d Galt thought of the scene in the basement, of the detached, clinical way he had handled his \u2018specimens.\u2019 She thought of the scalpel, of his obsession with precision. \u201cThe medical examiner believes it would have been\u2026 very fast,\u201d she lied, the falsehood a small, final mercy she could offer. \u201cI don\u2019t believe she would have been aware for very long.\u201d\n\nIt was then that she told them about the scholarship. She explained that their daughter\u2019s name, along with the others, would be honoured, used to help young people pursue the same calling Cynthia had. For the first time, a flicker of light broke through the suffocating gloom in the room. Cynthia\u2019s father, who had not spoken a word, finally looked at Galt, tears streaming silently down his weathered face. \u201cShe would have liked that,\u201d he rasped. \u201cShe always wanted to help.\u201d Galt left an hour later, carrying the weight of their gratitude and their grief. It was a burden heavier than any case file, more real than any internal inquiry. As she drove back toward the ferry, she knew that this was the work that mattered. Not just catching the killer, but tending to the wounds left in his wake, one quiet conversation, one scholarship, one act of defiant remembrance at a time. The hum of his hatred had been silenced, but the quiet work of answering it would go on for a very long time."

The vibrant, garish colours of autumn had long since bled out, and winter had descended upon the island with a quiet, smothering finality. A thick blanket of snow muffled the city, muting sound and burying the world in a clean, white lie of purity. In the Charlottetown station, the manic energy had given way to a persistent, low-grade exhaustion. The case of Robert Garris was no longer a manhunt or even a fresh investigation; it had become a vast, heartbreaking administrative task, a grim accounting of a life\u2019s work devoted to death. The murder board in the briefing room remained, but it was no longer a tool of deduction. It was a memorial. Thirty-four of the thirty-seven columns now had a smiling face and a name. The final three, whose degradation was too severe for a quick DNA match against existing databases, remained stubbornly blank, their files awaiting a more complex genealogical search. They were the last of the ghosts.\n\nIsolde Galt spent most of her days orchestrating this final, sad chapter, but her nights were increasingly devoted to the Galt Foundation. The Thirty-Seven Voices Scholarship had been announced to a wave of national media coverage, a small, bright story of hope emerging from a narrative of pure horror. The first round of applications had flooded in, and Galt found herself reading the essays late into the night in the quiet of her study, the snow falling softly outside her window. They were filled with the earnest, hopeful ambitions of the young, stories of inspiration and a desire to serve. Each one felt like a small act of defiance against the silence that had so nearly consumed her.\n\nShe was reviewing a particularly poignant essay from a young woman in Cape Breton when Sergeant Miller appeared at her office door, knocking softly. He had lost the haunted, hollowed-out look from the initial days after the discovery, but it had been replaced by a deep, settled weariness that seemed to have taken root in his bones. He was holding a file, but he didn\u2019t move to hand it to her. \u201cMa\u2019am,\u201d he began, his voice quiet. \u201cThey\u2019ve identified number thirty-five. A Jane Doe from a highway ditch in New Brunswick sixteen years ago. She was never reported missing. No one was looking for her.\u201d He paused, the simple tragedy of that statement hanging in the air. \u201cI\u2019ve also put in my transfer request. I\u2019m moving to the financial crimes unit. I\u2019ve had my fill of this side of the ledger.\u201d\n\nGalt looked at him, seeing not a subordinate quitting a difficult post, but a good man who understood his own limits. She had seen too many cops like Miller burn out, turning their trauma into a bitter, corrosive cynicism that poisoned everything around them. His decision was not an act of surrender, but one of self-preservation. \u201cI understand, Frank,\u201d she said, her voice soft with a genuine warmth. \u201cThe world will always need people to dig into the darkness. But it also needs people to follow the paper trail. You\u2019ve done more than your share here. More than anyone should ever have to.\u201d He gave her a small, grateful nod, the first flicker of his old self she\u2019d seen in months. He placed the final file on her desk and left, closing the door quietly behind him, leaving Galt alone with the thirty-fifth ghost.\n\nA week later, a thick manila envelope arrived, forwarded from her office. It had a postmark from Vancouver. Inside was a letter, handwritten on crisp, heavy stationery. The penmanship was neat, deliberate. *Dear Inspector Galt,* it began. *I hope this letter finds you well. I\u2019m enrolled now. University of British Columbia. I\u2019ve decided to specialize in psychiatric nursing, with a focus on trauma and PTSD. For a while, after everything, I thought I was broken. I thought all I could ever be was a victim. A survivor. But you said I saved myself that night, and I\u2019ve thought about that a lot. I think what you meant was that I didn\u2019t just lie down and let the darkness take me. So I\u2019m not going to. I\u2019m going to learn how to be the person who sits with people in the dark, the one who helps them find the light switch. Thank you for showing me that was an option. Sincerely, Elodie Michaud.* Galt read the letter twice, a rare, unfamiliar warmth spreading through her chest. It was a receipt for a debt she hadn\u2019t realized she was owed.\n\nThat evening, she sat at her desk at home, a glass of wine untouched beside her, the final batch of scholarship essays before her. She picked up one at random. The applicant was a young man from Saint John, New Brunswick. His essay was about his aunt, a paramedic who had been his childhood hero. He wrote of how she could command a crisis with a calm voice, how she could make a scared child laugh even while putting a splint on their arm. He wrote about the hole she had left in their family when she had died, and how he wanted to follow in her footsteps, to be that calm voice for someone else\u2019s family. He wanted to honour her memory. Galt\u2019s eyes scanned to the top of the application. The applicant\u2019s name was Michael Crosby. His aunt, the one he was writing about, was Karen Crosby, victim number twenty-eight. The woman Garris had killed for telling him to be brave.\n\nThe hum of the universe seemed to shift, to settle into a new, more harmonious key. Here it was. The answer to the hatred. It wasn't a scholarship fund or a police raid or a bullet in the dark. It was this. A young man, having no idea of the monstrous injustice of his aunt's death, choosing to pick up her fallen banner and carry it forward, not out of vengeance, but out of love. It was the echo of a good voice, refusing to be silenced. Galt closed her eyes, a single, hot tear tracing a path down her cheek. It was not a tear of sadness, but of a profound, overwhelming, and fiercely hopeful relief. The harvest was over. The accounting was almost done. And now, finally, the new seeds were beginning to sprout."

No one was looking for her.\u201d He paused, the simple tragedy of that statement hanging in the air. \u201cI\u2019ve also put in my transfer request. I\u2019m moving to the financial crimes unit. I\u2019ve had my fill of this side of the ledger.\u201d\n\nGalt looked at him, seeing not a subordinate quitting a difficult post, but a good man who understood his own limits. She had seen too many cops like Miller burn out, turning their trauma into a bitter, corrosive cynicism that poisoned everything around them. His decision was not an act of surrender, but one of self-preservation. \u201cI understand, Frank,\u201d she said, her voice soft with a genuine warmth. \u201cThe world will always need people to dig into the darkness. But it also needs people to follow the paper trail. You\u2019ve done more than your share here. More than anyone should ever have to.\u201d He gave her a small, grateful nod, the first flicker of his old self she\u2019d seen in months. He placed the final file on her desk and left, closing the door quietly behind him, leaving Galt alone with the thirty-fifth ghost.\n\nA week later, a thick manila envelope arrived, forwarded from her office. It had a postmark from Vancouver. Inside was a letter, handwritten on crisp, heavy stationery. The penmanship was neat, deliberate. *Dear Inspector Galt,* it began. *I hope this letter finds you well. I\u2019m enrolled now. University of British Columbia. I\u2019ve decided to specialize in psychiatric nursing, with a focus on trauma and PTSD. For a while, after everything, I thought I was broken. I thought all I could ever be was a victim. A survivor. But you said I saved myself that night, and I\u2019ve thought about that a lot. I think what you meant was that I didn\u2019t just lie down and let the darkness take me. So I\u2019m not going to. I\u2019m going to learn how to be the person who sits with people in the dark, the one who helps them find the light switch. Thank you for showing me that was an option. Sincerely, Elodie Michaud.* Galt read the letter twice, a rare, unfamiliar warmth spreading through her chest. It was a receipt for a debt she hadn\u2019t realized she was owed.\n\nThat evening, she sat at her desk at home, a glass of wine untouched beside her, the final batch of scholarship essays before her. She picked up one at random. The applicant was a young man from Saint John, New Brunswick. His essay was about his aunt, a paramedic who had been his childhood hero. He wrote of how she could command a crisis with a calm voice, how she could make a scared child laugh even while putting a splint on their arm. He wrote about the hole she had left in their family when she had died, and how he wanted to follow in her footsteps, to be that calm voice for someone else\u2019s family. He wanted to honour her memory. Galt\u2019s eyes scanned to the top of the application. The applicant\u2019s name was Michael Crosby. His aunt, the one he was writing about, was Karen Crosby, victim number twenty-eight. The woman Garris had killed for telling him to be brave.\n\nThe hum of the universe seemed to shift, to settle into a new, more harmonious key. Here it was. The answer to the hatred. It wasn't a scholarship fund or a police raid or a bullet in the dark. It was this. A young man, having no idea of the monstrous injustice of his aunt's death, choosing to pick up her fallen banner and carry it forward, not out of vengeance, but out of love. It was the echo of a good voice, refusing to be silenced. Galt closed her eyes, a single, hot tear tracing a path down her cheek. It was not a tear of sadness, but of a profound, overwhelming, and fiercely hopeful relief. The harvest was over. The accounting was almost done. And now, finally, the new seeds were beginning to sprout."

The vibrant, garish colours of autumn had long since bled out, and winter had descended upon the island with a quiet, smothering finality. A thick blanket of snow muffled the city, burying the world in a clean, white lie of purity that did nothing to scrub the psychological stain left by Robert Garris. In the Charlottetown police station, the manic energy of the hunt had been replaced by a persistent, low-grade exhaustion that settled in the corners of rooms like dust. The case was no longer a living thing; it had become a vast, heartbreaking administrative task, a grim accounting of a life\u2019s work devoted to death. The murder board in the briefing room remained, but its function had changed. It was no longer a tool of deduction but a memorial, its surface a sprawling grid of sorrow. Thirty-four of the thirty-seven columns now held a smiling face and a name, a gut-wrenching gallery of stolen lives. The final three, whose degradation from time and circumstance was too severe for a quick DNA match against existing databases, remained stubbornly blank, their files awaiting a more complex genealogical search that felt like a search for ghosts.\n\nIsolde Galt spent most of her days orchestrating this final, sad chapter, her focus divided between the meticulous demands of the investigation and the burgeoning life of her new foundation project. The Thirty-Seven Voices Scholarship had been announced to a wave of national media coverage, a small, bright story of hope emerging from a narrative of pure horror. The first round of applications had flooded in, and Galt found herself reading the essays late into the night in the quiet of her study, the snow falling softly outside her window, each one a small act of defiance against the silence that had so nearly consumed her. They were filled with the earnest, hopeful ambitions of the young, stories of personal inspiration and a deep desire to serve. Each essay she read felt like a vote cast against the darkness, a quiet affirmation of the very compassion that Garris had sought to extinguish.\n\nShe was reviewing a particularly poignant essay from a young woman in Cape Breton who wrote of caring for her grandfather, when Sergeant Miller appeared at her office door, knocking softly. The months had hollowed him out, but a different kind of light had begun to return to his eyes. The haunted, frantic look was gone, replaced by a deep, settled weariness that seemed to have taken permanent root in his bones. He held a single file, but he didn't move to hand it to her, as if reluctant to pass on its sad weight. \u201cMa\u2019am,\u201d he began, his voice quiet but steady. \u201cThey\u2019ve identified number thirty-five. A Jane Doe from a highway ditch in New Brunswick sixteen years ago. She was never reported missing. No one was looking for her.\u201d He paused, the simple, devastating tragedy of that statement hanging in the air between them. \u201cI\u2019ve also put in my transfer request. I\u2019m moving to the financial crimes unit. I think I\u2019ve had my fill of this side of the ledger for a while.\u201d\n\nGalt looked at him, truly looked at him, and saw not a subordinate quitting a difficult post, but a good man who had stared into the abyss and had the wisdom to step back from the edge. She had seen too many cops like Miller burn out, turning their trauma into a bitter, corrosive cynicism that poisoned everything around them. His decision was not an act of surrender, but one of profound self-preservation. \u201cI understand, Frank,\u201d she said, her voice soft with a genuine, unforced warmth. \u201cThe world will always need people to dig into the darkness and find the monsters. But it also needs people who can follow the paper trail and find the thieves. You\u2019ve done more than your share here. More than anyone should ever have to.\u201d He gave her a small, grateful nod, the first flicker of his old, solid self she\u2019d seen in months. He placed the final file on her desk and left, closing the door quietly behind him. Galt was left alone with the thirty-fifth ghost, a woman so thoroughly erased from the world that not even her absence had been noticed.\n\nA week later, a thick manila envelope arrived, forwarded from her office to her home. The postmark was from Vancouver, British Columbia. Inside, she found a letter, handwritten on crisp, heavy stationery. The penmanship was neat, deliberate, each letter formed with a confidence that spoke of a newfound purpose. *Dear Inspector Galt,* it began. *I hope this letter finds you well. I\u2019m enrolled now.

Sincerely, Elodie Michaud.* Galt read the letter twice, a rare, unfamiliar warmth spreading through her chest. It was not just a thank you; it was a receipt for a debt she hadn\u2019t realized she was owed, a piece of irrefutable proof that her method, her quiet philosophy of proactive restoration, could actually bear fruit.\n\nThat evening, she sat at her desk at home, a glass of wine untouched beside her, the final batch of scholarship essays before her. She was tired, the weight of the day and the accumulated grief of the past months pressing down on her. She decided to read one last application before calling it a night. The applicant was a young man from Saint John, New Brunswick. His essay was about his aunt, a paramedic who had been his childhood hero. He wrote of how she could command a crisis with a calm voice, how she could make a scared child laugh even while putting a splint on their arm. He wrote about the hole she had left in their family when she had died suddenly seven years ago, and how he wanted to follow in her footsteps, to be that calm voice for someone else\u2019s family. He wanted to honour her memory, to carry her legacy of service forward. Galt\u2019s eyes, heavy with fatigue, scanned to the top of the application for the name. The applicant\u2019s name was Michael Crosby. His aunt, the one he was writing about with such love and admiration, was Karen Crosby, victim number twenty-eight. The woman Robert Garris had murdered for telling him to be brave.\n\nThe hum of the universe seemed to shift, to recalibrate, to settle into a new, more harmonious key. Here it was. The final, definitive answer to the hatred. It wasn't the scholarship fund itself, or the police raid, or the bullet in the dark. It was this. A young man, having no idea of the monstrous injustice of his aunt's death, choosing to pick up her fallen banner and carry it forward, not out of vengeance, but out of pure, uncomplicated love. It was the echo of a good voice, refusing to be silenced, amplified by the next generation. Galt closed her eyes, a single, hot tear escaping and tracing a slow path down her cheek. It was not a tear of sadness, but of a profound, overwhelming, and fiercely hopeful relief. The harvest was over. The accounting was almost done. And now, finally, against all odds, the new seeds were beginning to sprout."

                                        "text": "### Chapter 9\n\nOne year later, the snow fell on Charlottetown in thick, silent flakes, burying the city in a soft, forgiving white. In a brightly lit auditorium at Holland College, the air was warm and filled with a hopeful murmur. It was the inaugural awards ceremony for the Thirty-Seven Voices Scholarship. The front rows were filled with bright, nervous young faces\u2014the first cohort of nursing and paramedic students to benefit from the fund. Behind them sat families, some beaming with pride, others with a more fragile, bittersweet expression. They were the families of the victims, brought together by a tragedy that had been painstakingly, intentionally, transformed into a legacy.\n\nIsolde Galt stood at the podium, a position she had occupied a hundred times at foundation events, but this time felt different. The weight of the thirty-seven names, now engraved on a simple, elegant plaque to her right, was a physical presence. She looked out at the assembled faces\u2014at Cynthia Morrell\u2019s parents sitting in the third row, their expressions a mixture of profound sadness and a quiet, fragile pride; at Michael Crosby, Karen Crosby\u2019s nephew, his posture straight and eager, a young man on the cusp of fulfilling a dream his aunt had inspired. Her gaze found Elodie Michaud, sitting near the front. Elodie had flown in from Vancouver, her presence a quiet testament to the resilience of the human spirit. The terrified, haunted young woman from the parking lot was gone, replaced by a calm, composed individual whose eyes held a depth and wisdom far beyond her years.\n\n\u201cA voice is a powerful thing,\u201d Galt began, her own voice clear and steady, filling the auditorium. \u201cIt can offer comfort. It can express love. It can speak truth to power. It can calm a frightened child or soothe a soul in its final moments. The goal of the man who committed these acts was to create silence. To steal voices. He believed that by doing so, he could somehow win a war against a memory, against a kindness he could not comprehend.\u201d She paused, letting the weight of the statement settle. \u201cTonight, looking at these students, at these families, I can say with absolute certainty that he failed. He created a silence, and we have answered it with a chorus. For every voice he took, a new generation of voices will rise. Stronger. More determined. A legacy not of hatred, but of healing.\u201d\n\nAfter the ceremony, as refreshments were served, the room buzzed with quiet conversations. Galt moved through the crowd, a word of encouragement for a student here, a quiet, respectful nod to a grieving parent there. Michael Crosby approached her, his face flushed with excitement. \u201cInspector Galt\u2014I mean, Ms. Galt,\u201d he stammered, \u201cI just wanted to thank you. My aunt Karen\u2026 she would have loved this. She believed everyone deserved a chance to get help, and a chance to give it. This scholarship\u2026 it feels like I\u2019m carrying a piece of her with me.\u201d Galt looked at the earnest young man, a living, breathing continuation of his aunt\u2019s compassion, and felt a profound sense of rightness, a small but significant victory against the chaos. He still didn\u2019t know the full, horrific truth of how his aunt had died; the family, in consultation with the police, had decided the public story of a tragic accident was a kinder memory to live with. All he knew was that her spirit was being honoured, and that was enough.\n\nLater, she found Elodie by the large windows, looking out at the falling snow. \u201cYour speech was perfect,\u201d Elodie said, turning to her. There was a quiet strength in her demeanour that was astonishing. \u201cYou gave them a narrative that wasn\u2019t about being a victim.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re the one who taught me that was possible,\u201d Galt replied, her voice softer. \u201cYour letter\u2026 it meant a great deal.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy studies are fascinating,\u201d Elodie continued, a new, academic passion in her voice. \u201cWe\u2019re learning about malignant narcissism, pathological grievance\u2026 the way some people build an entire identity around a single perceived injustice, nurturing it like a precious flame. They become the heroes of their own tragic story, and anyone who doesn't fit that narrative becomes a villain who must be destroyed.\u201d She looked at Galt, her expression clear and analytical. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t a monster, was he? Not in a supernatural sense. He was just a man. A broken, pathetic man who chose to burn the world down rather than admit he needed help. That\u2019s almost scarier.\u201d\n\nGalt nodded, sobered by the young woman\u2019s insight. She was right. The myth of the monster was a comfort. The reality of the broken man was a far more terrifying prospect.\n\nJust as the crowd was beginning to thin, her phone vibrated with a text message from the lead analyst on the Garris task force, a young woman who had inherited the final, lingering threads of the case.

In a brightly lit auditorium at Holland College, the air was warm and filled with a hopeful murmur. It was the inaugural awards ceremony for the Thirty-Seven Voices Scholarship. The front rows were filled with bright, nervous young faces\u2014the first cohort of nursing and paramedic students to benefit from the fund. Behind them sat families, some beaming with pride, others with a more fragile, bittersweet expression. They were the families of the victims, brought together by a tragedy that had been painstakingly, intentionally, transformed into a legacy.\n\nIsolde Galt stood at the podium, a position she had occupied a hundred times at foundation events, but this time felt different. The weight of the thirty-seven names, now engraved on a simple, elegant plaque to her right, was a physical presence. She looked out at the assembled faces\u2014at Cynthia Morrell\u2019s parents sitting in the third row, their expressions a mixture of profound sadness and a quiet, fragile pride; at Michael Crosby, Karen Crosby\u2019s nephew, his posture straight and eager, a young man on the cusp of fulfilling a dream his aunt had inspired. Her gaze found Elodie Michaud, sitting near the front. Elodie had flown in from Vancouver, her presence a quiet testament to the resilience of the human spirit. The terrified, haunted young woman from the parking lot was gone, replaced by a calm, composed individual whose eyes held a depth and wisdom far beyond her years.\n\n\u201cA voice is a powerful thing,\u201d Galt began, her own voice clear and steady, filling the auditorium. \u201cIt can offer comfort. It can express love. It can speak truth to power. It can calm a frightened child or soothe a soul in its final moments. The goal of the man who committed these acts was to create silence. To steal voices. He believed that by doing so, he could somehow win a war against a memory, against a kindness he could not comprehend.\u201d She paused, letting the weight of the statement settle. \u201cTonight, looking at these students, at these families, I can say with absolute certainty that he failed. He created a silence, and we have answered it with a chorus. For every voice he took, a new generation of voices will rise. Stronger. More determined. A legacy not of hatred, but of healing.\u201d\n\nAfter the ceremony, as refreshments were served, the room buzzed with quiet conversations. Galt moved through the crowd, a word of encouragement for a student here, a quiet, respectful nod to a grieving parent there. Michael Crosby approached her, his face flushed with excitement. \u201cInspector Galt\u2014I mean, Ms. Galt,\u201d he stammered, \u201cI just wanted to thank you. My aunt Karen\u2026 she would have loved this. She believed everyone deserved a chance to get help, and a chance to give it. This scholarship\u2026 it feels like I\u2019m carrying a piece of her with me.\u201d Galt looked at the earnest young man, a living, breathing continuation of his aunt\u2019s compassion, and felt a profound sense of rightness, a small but significant victory against the chaos. He still didn\u2019t know the full, horrific truth of how his aunt had died; the family, in consultation with the police, had decided the public story of a tragic accident was a kinder memory to live with. All he knew was that her spirit was being honoured, and that was enough.\n\nLater, she found Elodie by the large windows, looking out at the falling snow. \u201cYour speech was perfect,\u201d Elodie said, turning to her. There was a quiet strength in her demeanour that was astonishing. \u201cYou gave them a narrative that wasn\u2019t about being a victim.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re the one who taught me that was possible,\u201d Galt replied, her voice softer. \u201cYour letter\u2026 it meant a great deal.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy studies are fascinating,\u201d Elodie continued, a new, academic passion in her voice. \u201cWe\u2019re learning about malignant narcissism, pathological grievance\u2026 the way some people build an entire identity around a single perceived injustice, nurturing it like a precious flame. They become the heroes of their own tragic story, and anyone who doesn't fit that narrative becomes a villain who must be destroyed.\u201d She looked at Galt, her expression clear and analytical. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t a monster, was he? Not in a supernatural sense. He was just a man. A broken, pathetic man who chose to burn the world down rather than admit he needed help. That\u2019s almost scarier.\u201d\n\nGalt nodded, sobered by the young woman\u2019s insight. She was right. The myth of the monster was a comfort. The reality of the broken man was a far more terrifying prospect.\n\nJust as the crowd was beginning to thin, her phone vibrated with a text message from the lead analyst on the Garris task force, a young woman who had inherited the final, lingering threads of the case. Galt stepped into a quiet hallway to read it. *Ma\u2019am, you asked to be notified personally. We finally got a hit on victim #37. The last one. Her name was Alice Tremblay.

Spring had come again to the island, a riot of defiant green that painted over the long, monochrome memory of winter. The community garden in the east end was no longer a project; it was an institution. It had tripled in size, a sprawling, chaotic tapestry of vegetable patches, flower beds, and fruit trees, punctuated by a small playground and a cedar-walled community classroom. On a warm Tuesday afternoon in May, Isolde Galt was on her hands and knees in the dirt, her silver-streaked hair pulled back in a loose ponytail, showing a group of schoolchildren how to identify and pull chickweed without disturbing the delicate roots of the peas they were protecting. She was not Detective Inspector Galt anymore. That title, along with the badge and the weary authority that came with it, had been retired three years ago. She was simply Isolde, the Executive Director of the Galt Foundation, a woman who now measured her successes in bushels of produce and graduation rates, not in closed case files.\n\nThe Garris case had become a dark piece of island folklore, a story whispered by teenagers for a thrill, a case study taught at police colleges. For Galt, it was a closed book, its terrible lessons absorbed, its ghosts mostly laid to rest. Her work now was the answer she had forged in the aftermath: building, funding, nurturing. The Thirty-Seven Voices Scholarship had already sent dozens of nurses and paramedics out into the world, a living, breathing chorus of compassionate care that had long ago drowned out the memory of a basement\u2019s hateful hum. The garden, the scholarships, the shelters\u2014they were her life\u2019s work now, a barricade of proactive humanism built against the darkness she had once waded through daily. The soil under her fingernails felt more honest, more real, than the cold steel of a service weapon ever had.\n\nShe was explaining the symbiotic relationship between marigolds and tomato plants when a shadow fell over her. She looked up, squinting into the sun, at a young man in a dark, ill-fitting suit who looked profoundly out of place among the laughing children and buzzing bees. He was young, his face earnest and scrubbed, but his eyes held a premature weariness that she recognized instantly. It was the look of a man who had recently seen something that could never be unseen. He held his credentials in his hand as if he were presenting a holy relic. \u201cMs. Galt? I\u2019m Detective Cormier, Charlottetown Police. I\u2019m\u2026 sorry to interrupt you. I was told I might find you here.\u201d\n\nGalt rose slowly, wiping her earthy hands on a rag tucked into the waistband of her jeans. The name, the title, the look in his eyes\u2014it was a scene from another life, a ghost at the garden party. \u201cDetective,\u201d she said, her voice polite but cool, a subtle boundary being drawn. \u201cI\u2019m retired.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know, ma\u2019am,\u201d he said, his voice tight with a nervous energy she remembered well from her own early days. \u201cBut we have a situation. A bad one. It has\u2026 echoes. I\u2019ve read the Garris file, of course. We all have. And my inspector, he thought\u2026 he suggested I speak to you. Off the record. Just to get your perspective.\u201d\n\nA wave of profound weariness washed over Galt. She had consulted, unofficially, in the first year after her retirement, but had slowly extricated herself, letting the new generation take the lead. \u201cMy perspective is always the same, Detective. You\u2019re looking for a monster, but you will almost certainly find a small, pathetic man. Look for the mundane grievance that he has dressed up in ritual. Look for the human failure at the heart of it all. The theatrics are just a mask for something ugly and commonplace.\u201d It was the lesson she had learned from Alice Tremblay, the final, pathetic truth of Robert Garris, and she had made it her mantra. It was the best advice she had to give, and she hoped it would be enough to send him on his way.\n\nCormier swallowed, clearly steeling himself. He had expected the dismissal. \u201cWe\u2019ve considered that, ma\u2019am. But the ritual is\u2026 specific. The victim is a young nurse at the QEH. Sarah Birtwhistle. Found this morning in her apartment by a colleague. No forced entry. She was in her bed, tucked in neatly, as if she were sleeping. There were no marks on her, no violence. Not in the way you\u2019d think.\u201d He hesitated, his professional composure cracking. \u201cHer hands. They were posed on top of the covers, palms up. And they were\u2026 bare. The ME says they\u2019ve been scrubbed raw, chemically. All the way to the bone in some places. Every trace of her, her oils, her prints, her very skin, it\u2019s just\u2026 gone. And her work gloves, the box of them from her medical bag, they were missing.\u201d\n\nGalt felt a cold tendril of unease snake its way through her. The perversion of care was sickeningly familiar. Garris took their voices, the tools of their lies, as he saw it. This new killer was taking their hands, the instruments of their touch, of their healing. It was a different kind of violation, but it sang in the same terrible key. Still, she kept her distance. It was a horrific crime, another tragedy, but the world was full of them. Her job now was to build, not to deconstruct. \u201cLook at her life, Detective. Who did she refuse? Who did she fail to save? Whose ego did she inadvertently bruise? The answer is there. You just have to dig.\u201d\n\nThe young detective\u2019s face was a mask of desperation. He was out of his depth and he knew it. He took a deep breath, and played the only card he had left. \u201cThere\u2019s something else, ma\u2019am. The reason Inspector Davies sent me. The victim\u2019s name. Sarah Birtwhistle.\u201d He paused, letting the name hang in the warm, sun-drenched air. \u201cWe found her scholarship acceptance letter from your foundation, framed on her living room wall.\u201d Galt\u2019s blood ran cold. She could picture the letterhead, the formal, hopeful language. She had signed that letter herself. Cormier\u2019s voice dropped to a near-whisper. \u201cShe was one of the first. One of the Thirty-Seven Voices.\u201d\n\nThe name was not a case file. It was a promise. It was a brick in the wall she had built against the past. And now, a crack had appeared in that wall. Sarah Birtwhistle was not just a victim; she was one of Galt\u2019s own. The attack was not random. It was a desecration. It was an assault on the answer, a mockery of the defiant chorus she had spent the last five years conducting. The warmth of the afternoon sun vanished, replaced by a familiar, bone-deep chill. The philanthropist who nurtured seedlings and the detective who hunted men, two identities she had worked so hard to separate, slammed back together with the force of a physical collision. She looked away from the hopeful, thriving garden, her gaze turning toward the city beyond, her eyes regaining the sharp, analytical focus she thought she had left behind. The pathetic man could wait. First, she had to find out who was attacking her legacy."

                                        "text": "The children\u2019s laughter faded into a distant, irrelevant sound. The scent of rich soil and sweet alyssum was replaced by a phantom smell, the cold, chemical tang of a morgue. Isolde Galt\u2019s hands, smudged with the honest dirt of her new life, suddenly felt alien to her. She rose to her full height, her movements losing their relaxed, fluid grace and becoming sharp, economical. She turned to the parent volunteer who was helping with the children. \u201cHelene, could you take over? Something\u2019s come up.\u201d Her voice had changed. The warmth was gone, replaced by a cool, flat tone that Helene, who had only ever known her as the gentle patron of the garden, had never heard. It was a voice that did not invite questions.\n\nShe turned back to Detective Cormier, her eyes, which had been soft and encouraging moments before, now a pair of hard, grey stones. \u201cStart from the beginning. Everything you know, not what you think or what the press is guessing.\u201d They stood there, a jarring tableau of a grim police procedural unfolding amidst the riotous life of the spring garden. Cormier, sweating in his cheap suit, fumbled with his notebook as he recounted the sparse, terrible facts. The wellness check called in by a concerned colleague. The superintendent providing access. The eerily pristine scene. Galt listened without interruption, her gaze fixed on him, her mind assembling the pieces, feeling the old, familiar weight of a monstrous puzzle settling onto her shoulders.\n\n\u201cTake me there,\u201d she said when he had finished. It was not a request.\n\nCormier\u2019s head snapped up. \u201cMa\u2019am, I can\u2019t. It\u2019s an active crime scene. The protocols\u2026 a civilian consultant, maybe, but you\u2019re\u2026\u201d He trailed off, unwilling to state the obvious: she was nothing. A retired cop with a trust fund.\n\nGalt\u2019s expression did not change. \u201cDetective, your Inspector sent you to me for my perspective. My perspective is best acquired at the scene, not from a second-hand account delivered in a vegetable patch. Either you find a way to get me through that door, or I will call Inspector Davies myself and explain to him why his junior officer is obstructing a consultation he specifically requested. The choice is yours, but we are wasting time.\u201d The sheer, unyielding force of her will was a physical presence. Cormier, who had only ever read about the legendary DI Galt, was experiencing her firsthand. He nodded, a single, sharp dip of his chin. The argument was over before it had truly begun.\n\nThe drive across town was a journey back in time for Galt. The familiar streets of her city, which had for the past few years been the backdrop to a life of quiet purpose, now felt like a hunting ground once more. The spring day, with its brilliant sunshine and blossoming trees, seemed like a mockery. She was silent, her mind scrubbing away the past five years of board meetings and planting schedules, the old software of homicide investigation rebooting with a cold, ruthless efficiency. She could feel the mental pathways re-forming, the detached coolness she had cultivated as a shield against horror reasserting itself. The philanthropist was in retreat, and the hunter was re-emerging from a long hibernation.\n\nThe apartment building was a new, modern low-rise, its clean lines and landscaped entrance a stark contrast to the old brick walk-ups where she had spent so much of her career. The forensics van parked at the curb was an ugly, familiar scar on the peaceful scene. Galt moved past the uniformed officer at the door with an aura of authority so absolute that he simply stepped aside, assuming she belonged. Cormier followed in her wake, a nervous acolyte trailing a high priestess. The apartment itself was small, neat, and hopeful. A yoga mat was rolled up in one corner. A row of vibrant succulents lined the windowsill. And on the wall opposite the door, in a simple black frame, was the acceptance letter. *The Galt Foundation is pleased to award you a Thirty-Seven Voices Scholarship\u2026* The words, which she had written and signed herself, were a punch to the gut. This was not a stranger. This was one of hers.\n\nThe bedroom was worse. The horror was quiet, meticulous, and profoundly intimate. Sarah Birtwhistle lay in her bed, the covers drawn up to her chest, her head resting on the pillow. She looked peaceful, asleep. But the smell in the room was wrong. It wasn\u2019t the coppery tang of blood or the cloying sweetness of decay. It was a sharp, biting chemical odour, like bleach and industrial solvent, an antiseptic smell so powerful it was nauseating. And then Galt\u2019s eyes were drawn to the victim\u2019s hands, placed carefully on top of the duvet, palms up, in a gesture that might have been one of supplication. They were a ruin. The skin was gone, scrubbed and abraded away with a terrifying, obsessive thoroughness. In the places where the abrasion was deepest, the pale, glistening white of bone was visible. It was not the result of a frenzied attack; it was the product of a long, painstaking, ritualistic act of erasure.\n\nGalt put on a pair of gloves, the act feeling deeply, grotesquely ironic, and stepped further into the room. She circled the bed, her eyes missing nothing. The lack of struggle. The neatness of the room. She leaned closer, her gaze fixed on the horrifying remnants of the victim\u2019s hands. This was not a punishment. This was an unmaking. She turned to Cormier, who was standing white-faced in the doorway, unable to look directly at the bed. \u201cGarris was a collector of grievances,\u201d she said, her voice a low, analytical hum. \u201cHe wanted trophies, proof of his righteous anger. This is different.\u201d She gestured toward the bed. \u201cHe took her gloves, but he wasn\u2019t content with the symbol. He destroyed the source. He scrubbed away her identity, her touch, her ability to heal. This isn\u2019t about silencing a voice. It\u2019s about purifying a contamination.\u201d\n\nShe walked back out into the small living room, her mind racing, connecting the disparate, terrible pieces. The scholarship. The specific victim. The ritual. This was not a random act of violence. It was a message. It was a refutation. Her work, her legacy, her defiant answer to Garris\u2019s hatred, had provoked a new and terrible response. \u201cDon\u2019t look for a disgruntled patient, Detective,\u201d she said, her back to him as she stared at the framed letter on the wall. \u201cDon\u2019t look for a spurned lover. Garris was a brute who built a theology around his rage. This man is a zealot. He believes he is a purifier. And he didn\u2019t just kill a nurse. He chose his victim from a list. My list.\u201d She turned to face him, her eyes glittering with a cold, dangerous light. Her retirement was officially over. The war she thought she had won had just begun a new, more insidious campaign."
