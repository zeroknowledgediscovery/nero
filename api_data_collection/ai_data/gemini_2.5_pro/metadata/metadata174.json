     "novel_text": "The mist was a shroud over the Foyle, thick and biblical. It clung to the steel sinews of the Peace Bridge and ghosted through the cobbled alleys of the Craft Village, a damp, grey breath that tasted of river water and old stone. Sergeant Ragan, a title she\u2019d earned not through any constabulary but by a lifetime of sorting things out, felt the dampness in her bones. It was a Tuesday. Tuesdays were for the grim jobs. The ones where the council tenancy agreement had outlasted the tenant.\n\nHer van, a Ford Transit with 'Ragan's Responsive Caretaking' stencilled on the side in a sensible blue, rattled over the Craigavon Bridge. She was fifty-four, with a face that had been carved by Derry winds and a no-nonsense set to her jaw. Her hair, once a fiery red, was now a disciplined salt-and-pepper bun. She was a caretaker. She cleaned up what was left behind. Spills, stains, lives.\n\nToday it was a flat in the Bogside. A young fella, the dispatcher had said. A \u2018welfare concern\u2019 that had graduated, as they so often did, to a coroner\u2019s concern. The police had already been, done their cursory sweep, and left the grim aftermath for her. Just another job. But the moment she opened the door, a smell hit her that was not the familiar, tragic odour of lonely death. It was sweet. Cloyingly, sickeningly sweet, like a patisserie on the verge of putrescence. It was the smell of rot trying to disguise itself as confection.\n\nThe flat was a single room, a bedsit of squalor and despair. A mattress on the floor, stained takeaway cartons, a universe of dust motes dancing in the single beam of light from the grime-caked window. And in the centre of it all, the source. The young man, Liam, the neighbours had called him, was slumped in a computer chair, his head at an unnatural angle against the desk. The police had said overdose, a needle still pathetically limp in his hand. But Ragan\u2019s eyes, trained to see the details others missed\u2014the subtle watermark of a leak, the first bloom of black mould\u2014saw something else.\n\nAll around the base of the chair, on the floor, and spattered up the legs of the desk, was a thick, viscous, pink substance. It was hardening into a brittle shell, shimmering with a strange, pearlescent quality. It was the source of the smell. Scattered within the goo, like macabre sprinkles on a devil\u2019s dessert, were the tiny, black bodies of ants. Hundreds of them. A trail of them led from a crack in the skirting board, a tiny doomed pilgrimage that ended in a sticky, pink apocalypse.\n\nRagan pulled on a pair of latex gloves from her pocket, her movements precise and economical. She knelt, her knees cracking in protest. She touched the substance. It was brittle, sugary. She scraped a little with a fingernail. It flaked away like cheap paint. Her gaze drifted from the floor to the desk. Beside the young man\u2019s pale, cold hand was a device that looked like a child\u2019s water pistol, a garish thing of orange and green plastic. Its reservoir, however, was filled with the same shimmering pink liquid. A makeshift label, written in black marker, was peeling off its side. \u2018Splurge-Gun v.2\u2019.\n\nThis was not an overdose. Not just an overdose. Something was terribly, performatively wrong.\n\nHer eyes went to the laptop screen, still glowing with a phantom life. It was a Facebook page. The profile picture wasn't a face, but a pair of feet. Two pale, slender feet, immaculately clean, resting on a plush, crimson velvet cushion. The toenails were painted a delicate shell-pink, the very same shade as the goo hardening on the floor around her. The profile name was simple, almost innocent: Josephine.\n\nRagan used a pen to nudge the trackpad, scrolling down the feed. It was a gallery of feet. Feet on a beach, the sand like powdered sugar around the perfect toes. Feet in a bubble bath, peeking out from the foam. Feet tangled in white silk sheets. The posts were interspersed with short, jerky videos. Ragan clicked on one.\n\nThe view was from above, looking down at a line of ants marching across a pristine white countertop. The same perfect, pink-toed feet were visible at the bottom of the frame, wiggling slightly. A sweet, tinkling music-box melody began to play. Then the orange-and-green nozzle of the Splurge-Gun entered the shot. A voice, soft and breathy, a strange mix of girlishness and something else, something cloying and possessive, whispered.\n\n\"My darlings. My little sweeties. You're all marching to see me. You love me so much, don't you? I love you too. I love you so, so much. I want us to be together. Forever.\"\n\nThe gun fired. Not with a bang, but a wet, sickening *splat*. A thick jet of pink goo erupted from the nozzle, coating the ants in a single, messy burst. They struggled for a moment, their tiny legs churning in the viscous tide, and then were still. The camera zoomed in on the sticky carnage, the music box melody swelling.\n\n\"Now we're one,\" the voice cooed. \"My love is all over you. My sweet, sweet love.\"\n\nThe video ended. Below it were thousands of comments.\n*'So beautiful, Josephine! Your love is so pure!'*\n*'I wish I could feel your love like that! \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f'*\n*'The way you care for them is an inspiration. You're an angel.'*\n\nRagan felt a coldness that had nothing to do with the damp Derry air. She scrolled further, her breath catching in her throat. The dead boy, Liam, had commented just yesterday.\n*'Josephine, I made my own gun. I want to show you my love. I want to be one with them, just like you.'*\n\nHis comment had one reply, from Josephine herself. A string of heart emojis and a single, chilling sentence.\n*'Show me, my sweet. Show everyone how much you love.'*\n\nRagan stood up, backing away from the desk, from the sweet smell and the dead boy and the glowing screen. The police had seen a junkie. She saw a disciple. A victim of a madness so bizarre, so grotesquely twee, it defied all logic. She looked at the trail of ants from the skirting board. They were just ants. Insignificant. But in this room, they were the runes of a new and terrible scripture.\n\nShe pulled out her phone, her fingers fumbling with the cold screen. She dialled the number for the station, for Detective Inspector McIlvanney, a man whose patience she had tested many times with her insistence on details he considered beneath him.\n\n\"Christ, Ragan, what is it now?\" his voice was a tired rasp. \"Did a pigeon look at you funny? I've got three stabbings and a ram-raid to deal with.\"\n\n\"It's the Bogside flat, the overdose,\" she said, her voice low and urgent. \"It's not what you think. You need to come back. There's something here. Something you missed.\"\n\n\"We found the needle, Ragan. The coroner will do the rest. Just get it cleaned up. That\u2019s your job, isn\u2019t it?\"\n\n\"There's a gun,\" she insisted. \"A toy gun. And... and feet. On the internet.\" She heard herself saying it and knew how it sounded. Insane.\n\nThere was a long-suffering sigh from the other end of the line. \"Have you been on the sherry, Sergeant? It's not even lunchtime. Clean the damn flat. Send the bill to the council. Out.\" The line went dead.\n\nRagan stood alone in the silence, the sweet smell crawling down her throat. She was a caretaker. She cleaned up messes. But this wasn't a mess of squalor or neglect. This was the beginning of something. A stain that was spreading. She looked from the dead boy to the glowing screen, the perfect, pink-toed feet offering a silent, obscene benediction over the scene. She didn't know who Josephine was, or where she was. But she knew, with a certainty that settled deep in her marrow, that she had to be stopped. And in that moment, Sergeant Ragan\u2019s job description changed. She wasn't just cleaning up the aftermath anymore. She was going to have to clean up the source.\n\nShe spent the next two hours in a grim, methodical ritual. She bagged the makeshift gun and the boy\u2019s laptop as evidence, knowing the police would likely laugh and lose them. She documented everything with her phone's camera, taking pictures of the spatter patterns, the dead ants, the brand of cheap energy drink beside the monitor. Every detail was a potential weapon. When the physical cleaning began, she worked with a cold fury, scrubbing the viscous pink substance from the floorboards. As she worked, the music-box melody from the video played on a loop in her head, a maddeningly cheerful accompaniment to the carnage.\n\nThat night, sleep offered no escape. She dreamt of marching ants, millions of them, their tiny legs clicking on pavement, forming swirling patterns that resolved into a pair of pale, perfect feet. She dreamt of the sweet, cloying smell, and a soft voice whispering, \"I love you, I love you, I love you,\" as a tide of pink goo rose around her. She woke up sweating, the phantom scent of it in her nostrils.\n\nThe next day, she started her own investigation, the only way she knew how. With meticulous, dogged persistence. She sat in her small office at the back of her garage, the smell of disinfectant and engine oil a comforting antidote to the sweetness in her memory. The laptop she\u2019d taken from the flat sat on her desk, a Trojan horse filled with digital horrors. She created a dummy Facebook profile, a grey silhouette named 'John Smith', and descended into Josephine\u2019s world.\n\nIt was a rabbit hole lined with velvet and decorated with pictures of feet. Josephine had over a hundred thousand followers. Her feed was a relentless stream of positivity and barely concealed malice. Posts about 'finding beauty in the small things' were illustrated with close-ups of her pedicure. Exhortations to 'share your love with the world' were punctuated by videos of insect annihilation. The community that had sprung up around her was a cult of the lonely and the lost. They called themselves 'Josephine's Sweeties'. They praised her 'gentleness', her 'empathy'. They shared pictures of their own feet, seeking her approval. And, terrifyingly, they were beginning to share pictures of their own Splurge-Guns.\n\nThey were everywhere. A teenager in Ohio, posing with a modified Super Soaker filled with what looked like strawberry jam. A middle-aged man in suburban Tokyo, his face blurred, holding a delicate, airbrushed device that was a clear imitation of Josephine\u2019s. A woman in Italy, her post written in flowery, dramatic prose, describing the 'ecstasy of shared love' as she aimed a glitter-covered glue gun at a spider. They were building the weapons. They were following the gospel. The gospel of Josephine.\n\nRagan felt like she was watching a plague incubate in real time. She searched for news reports, for anything that might connect to this bizarre subculture. At first, nothing. Just the usual static of global tragedy. Then she refined her search terms, using the slang she was picking up from the forums. 'Sweetie ceremony'. 'Love sharing'. 'Forever nap'.\n\nAnd then she found it. A small news item from a local paper in Phoenix, Arizona. A man found dead in his apartment. An apparent suicide. The report mentioned 'a strange pink substance' found at the scene. A week later, another report, this one from a blog in Germany. A woman who had 'fallen' from her balcony. The blogger, a neighbour, mentioned the woman's recent obsession with her feet and a strange, sweet smell that had lingered in the hallway for days.\n\nIt wasn't just Liam in Derry. It was happening already. Sporadic, disconnected events, dismissed by local authorities as suicides, accidents, the sad, lonely ends of sad, lonely people. No one was connecting the dots. No one was seeing the pink, sticky thread that tied them all together. No one but her. A caretaker from Londonderry, staring at a screen in her garage, the weight of a silent, creeping, global horror settling on her shoulders. The death count wasn't rising yet. It was seeding. Germinating in dark rooms and lonely apartments all over the world, nurtured by a girl who posted pictures of her feet and whispered sweet nothings to the dying. Ragan scrolled through the faces of the 'Sweeties', their hopeful, lost eyes staring out from their profile pictures, and a cold, hard resolve solidified within her. She would care for them. She would clean this up. She had to.Her first move was to pivot from the macabre gallery of followers to the source itself. She began to deconstruct Josephine\u2019s online persona, piece by meticulous piece. She saved every photograph, every video, archiving them into folders on her desktop with grim, functional titles: \u2018Feet_Beach\u2019, \u2018Feet_Bath\u2019, \u2018Ant_Ceremony_14\u2019. She treated it like she was inventorying the contents of a derelict property, creating a sterile catalogue of a deeply unwell fantasy. The profile was a fortress of anonymity, a carefully curated fiction. There were no accidental reflections in sunglasses, no geotags left on photos, no friends tagged in pictures, because there were no pictures with other people. Josephine\u2019s world contained only two things: her own fetishised extremities and her adoring, faceless flock.\n\nThe substance, the pink goo, was the key. It was the communion wafer of this new religion. Ragan, reasoning that the 'Sweeties' would need instructions, delved into the message boards and private groups linked from the main page. It didn't take long. In a forum titled \u2018Sharing Our Sweetness\u2019, buried under dozens of fawning posts, she found a thread: \u2018Getting the Consistency Right?\u2019. Here, in chillingly domestic terms, the followers exchanged recipes. It was a bizarre confection of corn syrup, industrial-grade food colouring, gelatin, and, disturbingly, a specific brand of quick-set craft adhesive. The combination created the exact properties Ragan had witnessed: a cloying sweetness, a viscous flow that rapidly hardened into a brittle, pearlescent shell. The ingredients were all readily available, purchasable online or in any large supermarket. This plague was not only spiritual, it was DIY.\n\nShe printed the recipes, the pages warm from the laser printer, and laid them out on her desk like battle plans. The sheer banality of the components made the whole affair more grotesque. This wasn't some exotic poison; it was a perversion of the pantry, a weaponization of the craft aisle. She cross-referenced the adhesive brand with the items she\u2019d photographed in Liam's flat. There it was, an empty tube of \u2018Crafter\u2019s Bond\u2019 half-hidden in the mess of takeaway cartons. The connection clicked into place with the solid, satisfying finality of a mortise lock. Liam hadn't just followed Josephine; he had studied her, replicated her methods with the desperate precision of a true believer.\n\nFor days, Ragan\u2019s life fell into a new rhythm. By day, she attended to her duties, fixing leaking taps in student lets and clearing gutters in the Waterside, the mundane reality of her job a strange counterpoint to the madness she explored by night. Her van became a mobile command centre, parked in quiet streets where she could snatch moments on Liam\u2019s laptop, tethering it to her phone's data. She ate sandwiches over the keyboard, the faint, lingering sweetness from the Bogside flat still a ghost in her senses. The world of Josephine\u2019s Sweeties was her new, grim territory. She learned their language, the cloying euphemisms for death and self-destruction. She learned the hierarchy, the followers who received a rare 'like' from Josephine and were elevated to the status of minor saints.\n\nIt was in one of the videos, \u2018Ant_Ceremony_21\u2019, that she found the first crack in the pristine facade. Josephine\u2019s videos were usually shot in a sterile, white environment that could be anywhere. But in this one, for a fraction of a second, as the Splurge-Gun panned across the countertop, a reflection was caught in the polished chrome of a coffee machine in the background. It was a distorted, fish-eye view of the room, but it was something. Ragan played the clip over and over, pausing and enlarging the image until it was a pixelated mess. Through the digital noise, she could just make out the distinctive shape of a window. A large, arched window, with a specific pattern of leading between the panes. It was a piece of the real world, a clue Josephine had carelessly let slip. She took a screenshot, cleaned it up as best she could with the basic software on her computer, and printed it. A single, arched window. It wasn't much, but it was more than she'd had before. It was a shape. It was a start.The image of the window was her new obsession. It was ecclesiastical, she thought, or at least inspired by that kind of architecture. The gentle curve at the top, the lead latticework forming simple diamonds. It spoke of old money or old faith. A converted chapel, a Victorian university library, a wing of a grand, decaying hotel. She ran the grainy screenshot through every reverse image search engine she could find, a process that felt like shouting a single, garbled word into a hurricane. The results were a meaningless torrent of gothic cathedrals, pub windows, and stock photos of romantic doorways. The internet, for all its vaunted omniscience, was a fool. It saw shapes, not significance.\n\nShe changed her approach, thinking like a caretaker. Where do you find windows like that? She spent hours scrolling through the online archives of architectural magazines, real estate listings for \u2018unique properties\u2019 in English-speaking countries, and the digital prospectuses of hundreds of universities. The task was monumental, a search for one specific pane of glass on a planet full of them. Every arched window she saw sent a jolt through her, followed by the dull thud of disappointment. The curve was too steep, the leading too ornate, the setting all wrong. The world was full of arched windows, each one a silent mockery of her efforts. After three nights of this, with gritty eyes and a spine aching from her cheap office chair, she admitted a temporary defeat. The window was a clue for later. For now, it was a dead end.\n\nShe needed a different lever. If she couldn\u2019t find the puppeteer, she would have to focus on the puppets. She returned to the gallery of Josephine\u2019s Sweeties, her digital flock. She had to believe that Liam wasn\u2019t the only one in Ireland, that this digital infection hadn\u2019t respected the borders of the Irish Sea. Methodically, she began to sift, abandoning the global view for a local one. She used the platform's search function, looking for followers who listed their location as anywhere on the island. Belfast, Dublin, Cork, Galway. The names scrolled by, a grim census of the lonely. And then, a hit that made the hairs on her arms stand up. A profile located in Derry. Her city.\n\nThe profile belonged to a girl named Ciara, her face a pale, heart-shaped thing surrounded by a dyed-black fringe. She looked no older than seventeen. Her feed, once filled with the typical teenage ephemera of song lyrics and selfies with friends, had changed drastically over the past two months. The friends had vanished. The music had been replaced by links to Josephine's page. Then came the first picture of her own feet, propped on a pillow, the toenails painted a hesitant, streaky pink. The caption read: *\u2018Trying to be beautiful too. @Josephine.\u2019*\n\nRagan scrolled, a sense of dread coiling in her stomach. The posts grew more frequent, more desperate. Pictures of insects. A spider in a jam jar. A line of woodlice on a windowsill. Ciara\u2019s comments on Josephine\u2019s page were pleading. *\u2018You are so full of love. I wish I could feel it.\u2019* Two weeks ago, Ciara had posted a picture of a garish, bright yellow water pistol. Last week, a small tub of pink food colouring. Yesterday, just hours after Ragan had been scrubbing Liam\u2019s floor, Ciara had posted a new photograph. It was her own feet again, but this time the pink on her toenails was perfect, immaculate. The exact shell-pink. They rested on a dark green rug. At the edge of the frame, just visible, was the yellow nozzle of the water pistol. The caption was a single, chilling sentence. *\u2018I think I\u2019m ready to share my love, Josephine. I\u2019m ready to be with the sweeties.\u2019*\n\nThis was it. Not a theory. Not a bizarre story about feet and the internet. This was a child in her own city, standing on the same precipice Liam had just thrown himself from. Ragan printed everything. Ciara\u2019s profile, her increasingly alarming posts, the picture of the water pistol, the final, terrifying photo. She stapled them together with a decisive thwack. She had the needle, and she had the damage done. Now she had a chance to stop the next injection.\n\nShe dialled McIlvanney\u2019s number again, her heart hammering a hard, steady rhythm against her ribs. He answered on the third ring, his voice already saturated with exhaustion. \u201cRagan, I swear to God, if this is about a bin dispute\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about the Bogside overdose,\u201d she cut in, her tone leaving no room for argument. \u201cI have proof he wasn\u2019t the only one. There\u2019s another one, DI McIlvanney. A girl. Here. In the city. And she\u2019s about to do the same thing.\u201d\n\nThere was a pause. She could hear the muffled sounds of the station, a phone ringing in the distance. \u201cWhat are you talking about, \u2018another one\u2019?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m talking about a suicide cult that meets on Facebook,\u201d Ragan said, the words tasting like acid. \u201cThey\u2019re called \u2018Josephine\u2019s Sweeties\u2019. They\u2019re killing themselves with a mixture of corn syrup and craft glue they shoot from toy guns. Liam was one of them. I\u2019ve found another. A teenage girl named Ciara. She\u2019s posting pictures of her own gun. She\u2019s saying she\u2019s \u2018ready\u2019. You have to do something.\u201d\n\nThe silence on the other end stretched. She imagined him rubbing the bridge of his nose, picturing the mountain of paperwork on his desk. \u201cRagan, this is\u2026 a welfare check based on a Facebook post? Do you know how many of those we\u2019d have to do a day? It\u2019s probably just teenage drama.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid Liam\u2019s death look like drama to you?\u201d she shot back, her voice low and fierce. \u201cThe pink goo all over the floor? The ants? The Splurge-Gun? I have his laptop. I have the video that told him to do it. And I have the profile of a seventeen-year-old girl in this city who is following the exact same script. Her name is Ciara Healy. She lives in the Rosemount area. Are you going to wait until I\u2019m the one called to clean out her flat, too?\u201d\n\nThe mention of a specific name and area seemed to land with more weight than all her theories. It made it real. It made it a liability. Another long, weary sigh travelled down the line. It was the sound of a man being cornered by a problem he desperately didn\u2019t want.\n\n\u201cAlright, Ragan. Alright,\u201d McIlvanney conceded, his voice heavy with reluctance. \u201cI\u2019ll send a car around. A welfare check. But if she\u2019s just painting her bloody toenails, you and I are going to have a very serious conversation about wasting police time. And for Christ\u2019s sake, stop calling yourself Sergeant.\u201d He hung up.\n\nRagan didn\u2019t care. She let out a breath she hadn\u2019t realised she was holding, her knuckles white where she gripped her phone. It was a partial victory, a grudging acknowledgement. She had, for a moment, made him see the stain. Now she could only wait, and pray the car would be fast enough, and that when they opened Ciara Healy\u2019s door, the air wouldn\u2019t already smell sickeningly sweet. She looked at the laptop screen, at Josephine\u2019s page, which had just updated with a new post. It was a picture of a single, perfect foot, half-buried in pristine white sand. The caption read: *\u2018Thinking of all my sweeties, waiting to come home to me. Be brave. Your love makes the world beautiful.\u2019*Waiting was a state Ragan was constitutionally unsuited for. It was a form of idleness, and idleness was a rot that she had spent her life scrubbing from corners and scouring from surfaces. She stood in her own kitchen, the kettle boiling for a cup of tea she didn\u2019t want, the silence of her small house amplifying the manic, looping soundtrack in her head: the music-box melody, the wet *splat* of the Splurge-Gun, the soft, cooing voice. She couldn\u2019t stay here. She couldn\u2019t just wait for a phone call that might deliver news of another failure, another room that would need her services.\n\nThe keys to the Transit were in her hand before she\u2019d made a conscious decision to move. The van grumbled to life in the damp evening air, its headlights cutting twin paths through the descending gloom. Rosemount was a steep climb of red-brick terraces and semi-detached houses, a world away from the tight-knit, historic warren of the Bogside. It was a place of neatly kept gardens and cars parked carefully on the pavement. A place of apparent normality that Ragan knew was the most fragile facade of all.\n\nShe found the address easily, a two-storey house halfway up a quiet street. A single PSNI patrol car was parked at the kerb, its presence as loud and incongruous as a scream in a library. Its blue lights were off, but a faint, rhythmic pulse of light from within the house\u2014an ambulance\u2014stroked the windows of the neighbouring properties, where curtains were already twitching. She hadn't been too late. The relief was a physical thing, a loosening in her chest, but it was followed immediately by a cold wave of dread for what they had found.\n\nRagan parked her van across the street and walked over, her work boots making a heavy, purposeful sound on the tarmac. A young, fresh-faced constable stood by the open front door, looking pale and overwhelmed. He held up a hand as she approached. \"Sorry, miss, police incident. You'll have to stay back.\"\n\n\"I'm Ragan,\" she said, not breaking her stride. \"The DI sent me. I'm the one who called it in.\" The name, delivered with her customary lack of ceremony, seemed to carry a strange weight. The constable's eyes flickered with a flicker of recognition, or perhaps just confusion. He was clearly out of his depth.\n\n\"You're\u2026 the caretaker?\" he asked, his voice cracking slightly.\n\n\"Something like that,\" Ragan said, moving past him into the hallway. \"Where is she?\"\n\nThe house smelled of air freshener and simmering anxiety. A man and a woman, presumably the parents, were huddled in the living room with another officer, their faces blank with a shock that hadn't yet curdled into comprehension. The constable pointed up the stairs. \"Paramedics are with her. In her room. It's... it's a mess, miss.\"\n\nRagan took the stairs two at a time. The door to the front bedroom was open. The scene within was a twisted diorama of teenage life and ritual preparation. It was a girl's room, walls covered with posters of bands Ragan didn't recognise. But in the centre, on a dark green rug, the ritual had been interrupted. A mixing bowl, smeared with the same viscous, bubblegum-pink goo, sat beside an overturned carton of corn syrup and a half-squeezed tube of \u2018Crafter\u2019s Bond\u2019. The yellow water pistol lay on the floor, its reservoir full. And on the bed, sitting upright and wrapped in a foil blanket by a paramedic, was the girl. Ciara. She was weeping, but her tears were not of relief. They were tears of pure, unadulterated rage.\n\n\"You've ruined it!\" she shrieked, her voice thin and high. \"You ruined everything! I was going to be with them! She was waiting for me!\" Her small fists were clenched, beating a frantic, useless rhythm against her own legs. She wasn't looking at the paramedics trying to soothe her; she was staring at the police officer in the doorway, and then at Ragan, with an expression of profound, bottomless hatred. \"You don't understand! It's love! You've spoiled the love!\"\n\nRagan stood back, letting the professionals work, but her eyes took in every detail. Ciara\u2019s laptop was open on her desk, the screen glowing with Josephine\u2019s profile page. Her toenails, just as in the photo, were painted a perfect, shell-pink. A small, dead beetle, its legs curled in, lay on the windowsill, a single, tiny drop of the pink goo hardening on its iridescent shell. A practice run. A rehearsal for the main performance. The young constable from the front door was right. It was a mess. But it was a mess with a clear and terrifying blueprint.\n\nHer phone buzzed in her pocket. It was McIlvanney. She stepped out onto the landing, the girl\u2019s furious sobs echoing behind her. \"Ragan,\" he said. There was no preamble, no weary complaint. His voice was tight, stripped of all its usual cynicism. \"The lads at the scene just called me. A bowl of pink\u2026 gunk. A water pistol. The girl screaming about 'sharing her love'. What in the name of God is this?\"\n\n\"It's exactly what I told you it was,\" Ragan said, her voice low. \"A cult. Liam in the Bogside was a successful initiation. Ciara Healy was a failed one. They're getting instructions from a Facebook profile run by someone calling herself Josephine. They think covering themselves and a few insects in this stuff is a beautiful act of love that unites them forever. They call it becoming 'one with the sweeties'.\"\n\nShe heard him exhale, a long, sharp hiss of air. It was the sound of a man staring into an abyss he hadn't known existed five minutes before. \"Christ. Okay. Okay. The girl, Ciara, they're taking her to Altnagelvin for psychiatric assessment. The parents are in pieces, they had no idea. They thought she was just being a moody teenager.\" He paused. \"You have the boy's laptop?\"\n\n\"I do,\" Ragan confirmed.\n\n\"Don't let it out of your sight. Bring it to the station. First thing in the morning. We're opening a file on this\u2026 Josephine. And Ragan,\" he added, his voice dropping, losing its official tone for a moment and becoming something closer to a plea. \"Tell me everything you know.\"\n\nAfter the ambulance had gone, taking the still-raging Ciara with it, and the family had been left in the hollowed-out shell of their evening, Ragan was left alone in the room with the two officers, who were now bagging up the evidence with a newfound solemnity. They treated her differently now, with a kind of cautious respect. She was no longer the cleaner who had made a lucky guess; she was the one who had seen the pattern in the madness. She stood by the desk, looking at Ciara\u2019s laptop. Josephine\u2019s page was still there. No new posts. No acknowledgement of the drama unfolding in a small house in Derry. The profile was a silent, smiling monolith, its influence radiating out across the globe, utterly indifferent to the chaos it caused.\n\nShe pulled the printed screenshot of the arched window from her pocket. It looked flimsy, ridiculous, a piece of pixelated nonsense. But looking from the distraught family downstairs to the evidence of the ritual in this room, she knew it wasn't nonsense. It was a fragment of the real world intruding on the fantasy. It was the only solid thing she had that belonged to Josephine herself. Somewhere, behind a window just like that one, a woman was sitting at a computer, posting pictures of her feet, and whispering promises of a sweet, sticky eternity to the lost and the lonely. The police could open their files and start their official procedures, but Ragan knew they were playing catch-up. This wasn't a crime that could be solved with search warrants and uniformed patrols. It was a sickness. And the only way to cure it was to find the source of the infection.The next morning, the air had a sharp, clean edge to it, the mist having been scoured from the sky by an insistent wind. Ragan drove the Transit to the Strand Road police station, Liam\u2019s laptop sitting on the passenger seat like a malevolent passenger. She felt a grim sense of vindication, a feeling as tasteless and unwelcome as the sweet smell from the Bogside flat. She had been right, but being right meant a teenage girl had been seconds away from coating herself in a sugary tomb, and a young man was already in the morgue. It was a victory that felt entirely like a loss.\n\nThe reception she received was markedly different from her usual encounters with the constabulary. The desk sergeant, a man who had on previous occasions treated her with the weary condescension reserved for persistent complainers, now looked at her with an expression of guarded curiosity. He picked up his phone. \u201cDI McIlvanney? Your\u2026 appointment is here. Ragan.\u201d The word \u2018appointment\u2019 hung in the air, a small, significant alteration to their established order. She wasn't just the cleaner anymore. She was a source.\n\nMcIlvanney met her by the stairwell, his face looking even more haggard in the harsh fluorescent lighting of the station. He\u2019d swapped the exhaustion of yesterday for a new, wired intensity. He gestured for her to follow him, leading her not to a sterile interview room, but into the noisy, cluttered heart of the C.I.D. office. Heads turned as she walked through, carrying the laptop. She recognised the blend of suspicion and intrigue; she was an outsider, an anomaly in their rigidly structured world. \u201cIn here,\u201d McIlvanney said, ushering her into a small glass-walled office. A young man in a rumpled shirt and tie, who looked barely old enough to have a mortgage, was already seated at a table, a sleek police-issue laptop open in front of him. \u201cThis is Detective Constable Byrne. He\u2019s our cybercrime liaison. Byrne, this is Mrs Ragan. She\u2019s the one who put us onto this whole bloody mess.\u201d\n\nByrne stood and offered a polite, limp handshake. \u201cMa\u2019am. The DI\u2019s been giving me the overview. It\u2019s\u2026 unorthodox.\u201d He had the bland, passionless expression of someone who spent his life translating human misery into data packets. Ragan simply placed Liam\u2019s laptop on the table between them. \u201cThe password is his cat\u2019s name, \u2018Tiddles\u2019, followed by the year he was born, 1998. It was written on a post-it note on the monitor,\u201d she said, the mundane detail a stark contrast to the horrors the machine contained. While Byrne plugged in a series of drives and began his methodical violation of Liam\u2019s digital life, Ragan laid out her own evidence for McIlvanney: the stapled printouts of Ciara\u2019s profile, the recipes for the pink goo, the list of news articles from Phoenix and Germany.\n\nMcIlvanney stared at the pages, his jaw tight. He picked up the recipe. \u201cCorn syrup and craft glue. Jesus, Mary and Joseph. It\u2019s like a primary school art project from hell.\u201d He looked from the papers to Ragan. \u201cYou assembled all this in two days? From a single overdose call-out?\u201d The question was laced with a reluctant awe that was more valuable to Ragan than any official commendation. \u201cIt\u2019s my job to see the details, Inspector,\u201d she replied flatly. \u201cI just look for a different kind of mess.\u201d Her gaze shifted to Byrne, who was clicking rapidly through files, his face impassive. \u201cWe\u2019ve got his browser history,\u201d the young DC announced. \u201cHours and hours on the Josephine page, a few linked forums. He downloaded all her videos. He ordered the food colouring and adhesive from Amazon two weeks ago. It\u2019s all here. It corroborates your narrative perfectly, ma\u2019am.\u201d\n\nRagan felt a surge of impatience. Corroborating her narrative wasn\u2019t the point. Stopping the next Liam, the next Ciara, was the point. \u201cWhat about her? Josephine?\u201d she asked, her voice sharp. \u201cCan you find her?\u201d Byrne didn\u2019t look up from his screen. \u201cWe\u2019ll submit an emergency disclosure request to Facebook for the account\u2019s data. IP address, linked email, creation date. But these people are rarely stupid. She\u2019s likely using a VPN, bouncing her signal all over the planet. The email will probably be a dead-end burner account. It\u2019s a process. It takes time.\u201d Ragan pulled the folded, grainy image of the arched window from her pocket and slid it across the table. \u201cWhat about this? It\u2019s a reflection from a coffee machine in one of her videos. It\u2019s a real place. It has to be.\u201d\n\nByrne glanced at it for a fraction of a second before dismissing it with a shake of his head. \u201cA window? Ma\u2019am, with respect, there are millions of arched windows in the world. The resolution is too low to get any meaningful data. It\u2019s not actionable intelligence.\u201d He turned back to his screen, his attention already elsewhere. But McIlvanney picked up the printout, his thumb tracing the blurry curve of the frame. He looked at Ragan, and for the first time, she saw that he understood. He saw the gulf between the slow, methodical grind of police procedure and the speed at which this digital plague was spreading. They could gather data and file reports, but Josephine would still be out there, whispering her sweet poisons into the ether. \"We'll do what we can, Ragan,\" he said, his voice heavy. \"Officially. But you... you keep seeing the details. You have a knack for it. Keep me informed. Directly.\"\n\nLeaving the station, Ragan felt a profound sense of anticlimax. The wheels of justice were turning, but they were grinding with the slowness of millstones. She had handed over her discovery, and in return had been given platitudes about process. She drove back to her garage, the familiar smell of oil and solvent a grounding force. This was her place. The station was their world, of procedure and protocol. This was hers, a world of practical solutions and hands-on work. She knew in her bones that by the time Byrne\u2019s emergency disclosure request came back from some server farm in California, another \u2018Sweetie\u2019 somewhere would be mixing a bowl of pink goo.\n\nShe sat at her own desk, the silence of the garage a welcome respite. She had given them the laptop, but she had her own copies of everything. The archived videos, the screenshots, the reams of forum posts. She couldn\u2019t shake Byrne\u2019s casual dismissal of the window. It felt like he\u2019d discarded the one piece of the puzzle that was actually real. Frustrated, she decided to re-watch the video, the one with the coffee machine reflection. \u2018Ant_Ceremony_21\u2019. She put on a pair of old, foam-padded headphones to block out the world and hit play. The sickeningly sweet music-box melody filled her ears. The soft, breathy voice. \u201cMy darlings. My little sweeties.\u201d She closed her eyes, trying to force herself to see something, anything, new. But it was no use. The reflection was too distorted.\n\nThen, an idea struck her. She wasn't a cybercrime expert, but she was a caretaker. She knew that to find the source of a problem, you had to use all of your senses. She had been so focused on what she could see, she hadn\u2019t truly been listening. She played the clip again. And again. This time, she forced her mind to push past the foreground, to ignore the twee music and Josephine\u2019s cloying whispers. She was listening for the background. For the ambient noise of the room, the sounds that bleed in from the outside world. Most of the videos were sterile, silent save for the performance. But this one, \u2018Ant_Ceremony_21\u2019, was different. Behind the whisper, beneath the melody, there was something else. A faint, rhythmic sound.\n\nShe used the basic audio editing software on her computer, a tool she normally used to check for humming refrigerators on tenant complaint calls. She isolated the few seconds of audio, filtering out the high frequencies of the music and the low rumble of the voice. She amplified what was left. At first, it was just a digital hiss. Then, as she tweaked the levels, it emerged from the static, faint but unmistakable. It was a chime. A sequence of bells, playing a distinct, slightly melancholic tune. It wasn't the single toll of a common church clock. It was a proper carillon, a set of bells playing a short, specific melody. Four notes, a brief pause, then three more. A hesitant, memorable pattern. It was a sound that would repeat, on the hour or the quarter-hour. A sound that was as specific to a location as a street sign. Byrne could have his IP addresses and his server logs. Ragan had a window and a song. The hunt wasn't just digital anymore. It had a soundtrack.The melody was her only lead, a ghost of a song captured on a dead boy\u2019s laptop. Ragan, a woman more attuned to the percussive clang of a faulty radiator than the nuances of a musical scale, knew she was out of her depth. But a problem was a problem, whether it was damp rot or a digital death cult, and the first step was always to identify the source. She sat in her garage office, the world outside reduced to the soft drumming of rain on the corrugated roof, and played the four-second audio clip on a loop. *Da-da-da-dum\u2026 da-da-dum.* It was a simple, mournful little phrase, a pattern of notes that snagged in the memory.\n\nShe tried humming it into her phone, feeling a flush of foolishness as she held the cold glass to her lips. The music identification app, usually so adept at naming pop songs from a noisy pub, churned and processed before delivering a verdict of \u2018No Result Found\u2019. It was too short, too faint, too muddled with the digital hiss she couldn't quite scrub away. Defeated on the technological front, she fell back on the analogue. She downloaded a simple piano keyboard app and, with a thick, calloused finger more used to gripping a wrench, she began to tap out the notes, hunting for them one by one. The process was slow, painstaking. The first note, then the second, trying to match the interval she heard in her head. It took nearly an hour of clumsy plinking and replaying the clip until she had something that sounded close. A seven-note sequence. A key to a lock she couldn't see.\n\nWith the sequence of notes crudely transcribed, she returned to the internet, her search terms now more specific. \u2018Folk melody G-E-D-C G-A-C\u2019. \u2018Clock tower chime identification\u2019. She waded through forums for campanologists\u2014bell-ringers\u2014and music theory websites, places of arcane knowledge where she felt like a trespasser. Then, on a site dedicated to cataloguing traditional folk tunes, she found it. The melody was part of a Welsh air called \u2018Llwyn Onn\u2019, or, in English, \u2018The Ash Grove\u2019. It was a song of love and loss, its lyrics speaking of a lover\u2019s grief by a grove of trees that had witnessed their happiness. The irony was so bitter it almost tasted metallic. Josephine, the architect of a cult of sticky, sweet self-annihilation, had set her rituals to the soundtrack of a traditional lament.\n\nThe name of the song was a crowbar, a tool she could use to pry open the world. Her search immediately became more focused: \u2018Carillons that play The Ash Grove\u2019. The initial results were a dispiritingly long list. Cathedrals, university clock towers, and municipal buildings across the globe. A university in Toronto, Canada. A town hall in a suburb of Melbourne, Australia. A private memorial in Princeton, New Jersey. A church in Cardiff. The list spanned continents, a testament to the long reach of the British Empire and its cultural exports. Josephine could be anywhere.\n\nRagan began a grim, systematic process of elimination, a virtual world tour from the discomfort of her office chair. For each location on the list, she opened a new browser tab and began her hunt. She used Google Maps and its Street View function, becoming a spectral tourist, her disembodied view gliding down digital streets. She looked for the window. Her precious, grainy, arched window. The university in Toronto was a fortress of brutalist concrete, all sharp angles and unforgiving grey slabs. No arches. Melbourne\u2019s town hall was a grand Victorian affair, but its windows were all ornate rectangles. No. Princeton had the gothic arches, hundreds of them, but none matched the simple, clean diamond pattern of the leading in her screenshot. The search was a new kind of exhaustion, a long, scrolling journey to nowhere. For two solid nights, she drank bitter instant coffee and \u2018walked\u2019 the streets of cities she would never visit, her eyes aching from the screen\u2019s glow. Every promising curve in a building would resolve into the wrong shape, the wrong pattern, the wrong place. The world was full of arched windows, and all of them were taunting her.\n\nShe was about to give up for the night, her back a knot of pain, when she got to a less likely candidate on her list. The city of Bath, in England. The primary hit was the famous Abbey, but she\u2019d already dismissed it; its windows were vast, complex things of stained glass. But further down the search results was a smaller, more obscure reference: a private hospital, built in the Victorian era as a sanatorium for the wealthy, had been converted in the late 1990s into luxury apartments. An article in a local history blog mentioned its unique clock tower, a later addition, whose carillon was programmed to play a rotation of gentle folk melodies, including \u2018The Ash Grove\u2019, to avoid disturbing the residents with traditional, booming chimes. The name of the building was \u2018The Royal Victoria Crescent\u2019.\n\nWith a feeling of weary obligation, Ragan typed the name into the search bar. The satellite view showed a magnificent, sweeping curve of honey-coloured stone, perched on a hill overlooking the city. It was a monument to Georgian elegance and old money. It felt right. She dropped the little yellow Street View peg man onto the road in front of the crescent. The digital camera resolved, and she was there, on a quiet, tree-lined street. She began to pan the view across the facade of the building. Four storeys of symmetrical sash windows, gleaming white porticos, and black iron railings. It was beautiful, imposing, and completely uniform. Her heart sank. It was another dead end. She was about to click away when she noticed a section of the building set slightly back from the main crescent, an annex or a later addition. The architecture was subtly different, the windows larger.\n\nHer mouse clicks became frantic. She moved her viewpoint down the street, trying to get a clearer angle. And then she stopped. Her breath caught in her throat. There it was. On the third floor of the annex, set above a small stone balcony, was a single, large, arched window. The curve was identical. She zoomed in, the image pixelating, the quality degrading, but the pattern was undeniable. The simple, clean, diamond-shaped leading. It was the window. She had found it. It was real.\n\nRagan leaned back in her chair, the springs groaning in protest. She didn\u2019t feel a sense of triumph. There was no elation. Instead, a cold, heavy certainty settled in her gut, the feeling a caretaker gets when they finally trace a network of damp patches and hairline cracks back to the one rotten, burst pipe that is silently, steadily destroying the building\u2019s foundations. She was looking at it. The source. Josephine lived there. In a luxury apartment in a historic crescent in Bath, a place of serene, moneyed beauty. Ragan looked from the glowing screen to her own hands, stained with a faint trace of engine grease. The distance between her world and Josephine\u2019s seemed immense, insurmountable. The police, with their procedures and their requests for disclosure, would take weeks, months, to get to this point, if they ever did. And by then, how many more Liams would there be? How many more bowls of pink goo mixed in teenage bedrooms? She looked at the image of the window, a dark, blank eye in a wall of pale stone. She had found the nest. Now she had to figure out how to get to the spider.The journey from Derry to Bath was not a matter of impulse, but of logistics. For Ragan, it was no different from planning the deep clean of a derelict commercial property: you identified the objective, you assembled your tools, and you accounted for the variables. The objective was the apartment in the Royal Victoria Crescent. The variables were many. Her tools, however, were familiar. She spent an hour in the garage, methodically packing the back of the Transit. Alongside the usual accoutrements of her trade\u2014buckets, heavy-duty cleaning agents, a box of latex gloves, a formidable-looking floor scraper\u2014she placed a small holdall with a few changes of clothes, a thermos, and a thick ordnance survey map of southwest England. She packed the printouts of her research into a waterproof document wallet and copied all the files from Liam\u2019s laptop onto a cheap USB stick, which she then threaded onto her van\u2019s keychain. It was a meagre arsenal for the battle she intended to fight.\n\nBefore leaving, she made two calls. The first was to a reliable subcontractor, a man named Eamonn who handled her overflow jobs. She told him she had a family emergency in England and that he was in charge for a few days, a lie that tasted unfamiliar and unpleasant in her mouth. The second call was to DI McIlvanney. She dialled his mobile directly, knowing he\u2019d be home, the day\u2019s wreckage behind him. He answered with a grunt. \u201cRagan. It\u2019s nine o\u2019clock at night.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve found her,\u201d Ragan said, her voice devoid of triumph. It was a statement of fact. \u201cJosephine. I know where she lives.\u201d She heard a rustle on the other end, the sound of a man sitting up straighter, his attention suddenly snagged. She gave him the address, The Royal Victoria Crescent in Bath, and explained in concise, clipped sentences how she had found it: the bell chime, the Welsh folk song, the architectural blogs, the final, painstaking search on Street View. She left nothing out.\n\n\u201cAre you certain?\u201d McIlvanney\u2019s voice had lost all its weariness, replaced by a sharp, focused edge. \u201cA bell and a window? That\u2019s what you have?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the place,\u201d Ragan said with unshakeable certainty. \u201cI\u2019m on my way there now. I\u2019ll be on the midnight ferry from Belfast to Birkenhead.\u201d The silence that followed was long and heavy. She could almost hear the calculations whirring in his head: the jurisdictional nightmare, the lack of a formal warrant, the sheer, bloody-minded insanity of his civilian informant going on a freelance crusade. \u201cRagan, for the love of God, do not do this,\u201d he finally said, his voice a low, urgent command. \u201cYou are a civilian. You have no authority. You\u2019ll be arrested for harassment before you even find a parking space. Let me handle it. I\u2019ll call the Avon and Somerset police in the morning. We\u2019ll do it by the book.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy the time you get your book open, she\u2019ll have whispered in another ten ears,\u201d Ragan countered, the engine of the Transit already rumbling beneath her. \u201cHow\u2019s Ciara Healy doing, Inspector? Is she thanking you for doing it by the book?\u201d The question was cruel, and she knew it, but it was a necessary cruelty. She needed him to understand the urgency that was thrumming in her own veins. \u201cI\u2019m not going to kick her door in. I\u2019m a caretaker. I\u2019m going to do what I do. I\u2019m going to watch. I\u2019m going to see the details. I\u2019ll be your eyes on the ground until your book gets you there. But I am going.\u201d She didn\u2019t wait for his reply. She ended the call and put the phone in the glove compartment, severing her last tie to the world she was leaving behind. The van pulled out of the garage, its sensible blue lettering a flag of mundane purpose in the dark Derry night.\n\nThe journey was a long, suspended passage through a world of tarmac and sodium lights. The Irish Sea was a black, churning void, the ferry a brightly lit island of tired truckers and families on budget holidays. Ragan sat in the near-empty cafeteria, nursing a stewed tea, the map spread out on the table before her. She was an incongruous figure, a woman of fifty-four with a face carved by the Atlantic winds, planning a solo intelligence mission a hundred miles inside enemy territory. She felt the absurdity of it, a cold knot of fear in her stomach that she pushed down with the sheer force of her will. She had cleaned up after every kind of human tragedy\u2014loneliness, addiction, violence, despair. This was simply a different kind of mess, one that required travel. She repeated this to herself like a mantra as the English coastline appeared, a smear of distant lights in the pre-dawn gloom.\n\nBath, when she finally arrived in the late afternoon, was a shock. It was like driving into a postcard. The city was carved from a single, luminous golden stone, its streets flowing with a Georgian grace that felt utterly alien. Derry was a city of defiant grit, its history a visible scar. Bath was a city of preserved elegance, its history a curated tourist attraction. Her Ford Transit, with its Derry plates and functional, scuffed exterior, felt like a barge navigating a regatta of gleaming yachts. She saw tourists pointing cameras, students with tote bags, well-dressed locals walking tiny, expensive dogs. There was a serene, moneyed quietness to the place that felt more unnerving than any city noise she had ever known. This was Josephine\u2019s world. It was a world built to keep people like Ragan out.\n\nFinding the Royal Victoria Crescent was easy. It dominated the northern slopes of the city, a majestic, sweeping curve of perfect architecture. Parking the Transit was another matter. Every space was reserved for residents, marked with signs that threatened fines and clamping with polite, implacable ruthlessness. Ragan eventually found a spot on a side street a quarter of a mile away, a position that offered a partial, obscured view of the annex she had identified online. She killed the engine, and the ensuing silence was profound. She was here. From the driver\u2019s seat, she raised the pair of cheap but powerful binoculars she kept for inspecting roof tiles and focused on the building. Her heart beat a little faster as she found it. The third floor. The small balcony. The arched window. It was just as it had been on the screen, a dark, unreadable shape in the pale stone facade. There were no lights on inside. It looked empty, dormant. Ragan took a long, slow breath, the air tasting of damp leaves and old money. She was a caretaker, come to fix a problem. She settled back in her seat, pulled the thermos of tea towards her, and began to watch. The grim, patient surveillance had begun.The first twenty-four hours were a lesson in stillness. Ragan existed within the cramped confines of her Transit, a ghost in the machine. She moved only to shift her weight in the driver\u2019s seat, to raise the binoculars to her eyes, or to pour another cup of lukewarm tea from the thermos. The quiet, affluent street operated on a rhythm entirely alien to her. Women in expensive athletic wear jogged past with looks of mild disdain for the grubby white van. A fleet of Amazon delivery drivers formed a near-constant parade, depositing parcels on pristine doorsteps. Ragan watched it all, her gaze patient and methodical, her presence a small, stubborn stain of reality on the neighbourhood\u2019s polished veneer. She was an expert at waiting. She had waited for floor sealant to dry, for paint to cure, for the slow, inevitable decay of a building to reveal its deepest flaws. Waiting for a monster to show her face was no different.\n\nIt happened on the second day, in the pale light of a late afternoon. A high-end grocery delivery van, the kind that promised organic, artisan produce at extortionate prices, pulled up outside the main entrance to the annex. Ragan\u2019s hands, already holding the binoculars, tightened their grip. The intercom buzzed, and after a moment, the heavy oak door swung inward. A figure emerged, stepping out into the daylight for just a moment to sign for the delivery boxes. Ragan zoomed in, her breath held tight in her chest. It was a woman, or perhaps a girl, barely out of her teens. She was slight, almost bird-like, with long, mousy-brown hair tied back in a careless ponytail. She wore grey sweatpants and an oversized, plain black jumper, her feet clad in simple slippers. Her face was pale and unremarkable, devoid of makeup, her expression a blank mask of neutrality. There was no hint of the malevolent coquette from the videos, no trace of the cloying, saccharine poison. This was not the grand villain Ragan had built in her mind. This was a girl who looked like she hadn\u2019t felt the sun on her skin in months. She signed the tablet, took the boxes without a word, and disappeared back inside, the heavy door clicking shut, sealing her back into her stone fortress. Ragan lowered the binoculars, a profound sense of cognitive dissonance washing over her. The monster was just a lonely girl in sweatpants. The thought made her skin crawl.\n\nThe days settled into a grim routine. Ragan would watch the silent window, which remained dark and lifeless. She slept in snatches in the reclined passenger seat, the unfamiliar quiet of the street more disruptive than the noises of Derry she was used to. She subsisted on sandwiches and service-station coffee, using the facilities at a nearby supermarket with the grim efficiency of a soldier on campaign. At night, illuminated by the cold blue light of her phone, she would descend back into Josephine\u2019s world. The page was alive, a constant churn of activity. New pictures were posted: a foot dangling over the edge of a bathtub Ragan could only assume was inside the flat she was watching; toes peeking from under a silk duvet. And the comments from the \u2018Sweeties\u2019 grew more fervent, more desperate. They were sharing pictures of their own completed \u2018Splurge-Guns\u2019, holding them up like trophies, their faces alight with a terrifying, misguided devotion. Ragan was watching a global catastrophe unfolding in slow motion, and the epicentre was a single, dark window in a silent, golden building just a few hundred yards away.\n\nPassive observation, she realised, was a luxury she could no longer afford. She was a caretaker, and caretakers dealt with problems at the source, which meant getting closer. On the morning of the third day, she saw her opportunity. A man in khaki overalls was on his knees, tending to a bed of immaculate rose bushes near the entrance to the annex. He moved with the slow, deliberate rhythm of a lifer, someone for whom this was not a passion but a long-held job. Ragan got out of the Transit, shrugging on her own navy work coat. The stencilled words 'Ragan's Responsive Caretaking' gave her a uniform, a role, a reason to be there. She walked over, her boots crunching on the gravel path. \"Morning,\" she said, her Derry accent thick in the genteel air. \"Fighting a losing battle with the black spot on those, are you?\"\n\nThe gardener, a man in his late sixties with a face like a weathered paving slab, looked up, his expression shifting from suspicion to the weary camaraderie of the trade. \"Tell me about it,\" he grumbled, sitting back on his heels. \"Mrs Henderson in number twelve thinks it\u2019s a personal insult. You in the business?\" he asked, nodding towards her van. Ragan launched into a believable fiction about a difficult client in a neighbouring street, a litany of blocked drains and peeling paint that forged an instant, unspoken bond between them. They were the invisible army that kept these beautiful houses running, the people who saw the dirt that the residents paid handsomely to ignore. After a few minutes of shared grievance, Ragan steered the conversation, gesturing with her chin towards the annex. \"That's a handsome bit of stonework. Bet the window frames are a nightmare to maintain.\"\n\n\"That they are,\" the gardener affirmed, glad of the distraction. \"Especially the big arched one up on the third floor. Listed building, you see. Can't just replace it. Have to use specialist contractors. Costs a fortune.\" He lowered his voice conspiratorially. \"Not that the owner minds. Some big-shot lawyer in London. It\u2019s his daughter lives there. Miss Vance. Elara Vance. Proper strange one. Never comes out, far as I can tell. Has everything delivered to the door. Gives the other residents the creeps, but her daddy's money keeps the committee quiet.\" He snipped a dead head off a rose with a vicious snap of his secateurs. \"Far as I'm concerned, as long as the service charge is paid, she can conduct s\u00e9ances with Elvis for all I care.\" Ragan\u2019s heart hammered in her chest, but she kept her face a mask of professional interest. Elara Vance. She had a name. A real name. It felt like a key, cold and heavy in her hand.\n\nBack in the humming silence of the van, the name 'Elara Vance' became the lens through which everything focused. It grounded the phantom. Ragan's fingers flew over her phone\u2019s keyboard, the search now surgically precise. The father, Marcus Vance QC, was easy to find: a titan of corporate law, with a fearsome reputation and a string of articles praising his ruthless courtroom tactics. Then she found Elara. A handful of mentions in society pages from a decade ago, noting her presence at charity galas on her father's arm. Then, a single school photograph from a prestigious boarding school, dated five years prior. A pale, dark-haired girl with a forced smile and haunted, oversized eyes stared out from the screen. She was the ghost at the feast, a child who had everything and nothing. The pieces of the puzzle weren't just fitting together; they were locking into place with grim finality. A girl with a powerful, absent father, isolated in a golden cage with nothing but an internet connection for company, had twisted her loneliness and privilege into a weapon and aimed it at the world.\n\nThat evening, the stakes changed with a terrifying suddenness. A new video appeared on the Josephine page. It was different from the others. The camera was steady, the lighting soft and deliberate. It showed only Josephine's mouth, lips painted a glossy, perfect pink, and the delicate line of her jaw. Her voice was no longer a whisper; it was imbued with a new, hypnotic authority. \"My sweet, sweet darlings,\" she began, the music-box melody playing softly beneath her words. \"You have all shown me such devotion. You have prepared your love. Now, it is time for our Grand Union.\" Her pink lips curved into a gentle smile. \"This Saturday. The summer solstice. The longest day. A day of perfect, beautiful light. We will all feel my love together. We will all become one. Prepare yourselves. It will be the most beautiful day of our lives.\" The video ended. Below it, the comments section exploded into a frenzy of ecstasy and devotion. Pledges from Ohio, from Tokyo, from Italy, from Derry. They were all preparing for Saturday. A coordinated, global, mass suicide event, orchestrated from a luxury flat in Bath. Ragan felt a cold sickness rise in her throat. She looked at the date on her phone. It was Wednesday. The solstice was in three days. The book, as McIlvanney called it, was useless. The law was a blunt instrument, and this was a cancer that needed to be excised with a scalpel. She looked from the ecstatic comments on her screen to the dark, silent, arched window. The time for watching was over.The announcement of the Grand Union was a declaration of war. It transformed the abstract threat into a timed explosive, its fuse sputtering down towards Saturday. Ragan sat in the driver\u2019s seat of the Transit, the glow of the phone illuminating the hard, resolute set of her jaw. There was no more time for observation, for gathering evidence, for waiting on a system that moved at the speed of paperwork. A caretaker does not watch a flood rise; they find the stopcock and they turn it off. With force, if necessary.\n\nHer first action was a final courtesy, or perhaps a warning. She dialled DI McIlvanney\u2019s number one last time. He answered instantly, his voice sharp with anxiety. \u201cRagan, what\u2019s happening? I\u2019ve spoken to Avon and Somerset. They\u2019re treating it as a high-priority online harassment case, but they need more\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cThey need more time,\u201d Ragan finished for him, her voice flat and cold. \u201cAnd they have until Saturday. She\u2019s just announced it. A \u2018Grand Union\u2019. The summer solstice. She\u2019s calling them all home. It\u2019s going to be a bloodbath, Inspector, a global, coordinated event, and it\u2019s going to be directed from that flat.\u201d\n\nA string of muttered curses came down the line. \u201cWe can get a welfare check, maybe a psychiatric hold if we have a doctor sign off, but we can\u2019t just break the door down based on your theory\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cIt stopped being a theory when I was scrubbing Liam\u2019s brains and a mixture of corn syrup off his floor,\u201d she cut back, the image as sharp and brutal as the day she\u2019d seen it. \u201cIt stopped being a theory when Ciara Healy tried to join him. I\u2019m going in, McIlvanney.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you dare, Ragan,\u201d he ordered, his voice rising in panic and fury. \u201cThat is an order. You are a material witness. You are not a police officer. You will compromise the entire investigation. You will be arrested.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen you\u2019d better hope your colleagues in Bath are quick about it,\u201d she said, and for the first time, a sliver of the Derry wind crept into her voice. \u201cBecause I\u2019m a caretaker. And there\u2019s a mess in that building that needs sorting out. Immediately.\u201d She ended the call, the finality of the act a physical release. She was untethered. The responsibility was now hers alone.\n\nShe spent the next hour preparing, not for a confrontation, but for a job. She slipped into the back of the van, the familiar metallic and chemical smells of her trade a comfort. From a long storage tube, she pulled a set of drain rods, their brass fittings gleaming dully in the low light. From a locked metal box, she took a powerful, waterproof endoscope camera on a flexible cable, a tool she used for inspecting collapsed pipes. She selected a tub of thick, black, non-setting waterproof mastic, a substance designed to seal leaks but which could, with judicious application, create them. She was not arming herself with weapons, but with the implements of her profession. She was going to fix this problem the only way she knew how: by breaking it in a way that only she could fix.\n\nUnder the deep cover of a moonless, rainy night, she put her plan into action. Dressed in dark work trousers and a black waterproof jacket, she was just another shadow in a street of sleeping houses. She approached the annex not from the front, but from the rear, slipping down a narrow service alley she had scouted earlier. The building\u2019s elegance was a facade; like all buildings, it had a grubby, functional backside. Here, the drainpipes ran down the exterior of the honey-coloured stone, a network of arteries carrying the rainwater away from the precious structure. Ragan located the primary downpipe that served the annex roof. Using a drain rod as a lever, she prised open the access hatch to the roof gulley, a sound muffled by the persistent drumming of the rain. She worked quickly, her movements economical and certain. With a glob of the thick, black mastic, she systematically blocked the entrance to the downpipe, creating an insidious, invisible dam. Then she waited, watching as the rain, her unwitting accomplice, began to pool in the gulley, a dark mirror reflecting the starless sky. It would take hours, but eventually, the water would find the path of least resistance. And that path, she knew from a lifetime of experience, would be inwards.\n\nShe was back in her van before dawn, a cold, damp chill having settled deep into her bones. She watched the sun rise on a new day, Thursday, and felt the clock ticking with a visceral, physical pressure. Around mid-morning, it happened. A dark, tell-tale patch began to bloom on the pale stone wall of the annex, high up, just below the roofline. The water had found its way in. She gave it another hour, letting the problem fester, letting the water seep into plaster and behind skirting boards, before she made her move. She walked to the front of the building, her phone in her hand, and feigned a call, her voice loud enough to carry to the gardener who was, as ever, tending to his roses. \u201cAye, it\u2019s a shocking bit of water damage,\u201d she said into the phone, her eyes fixed on the stain. \u201cRight up under the eaves. That\u2019ll be into the wall cavity by now. A real mess.\u201d The gardener looked up, followed her gaze, and his face fell. He saw the dark patch, and his expression was one of pure, professional horror.\n\n\u201cWhere in God\u2019s name did that come from?\u201d he exclaimed, dropping his trowel. Ragan ended her fake call. \u201cJust spotted it,\u201d she said, her tone all business. \u201cLooks like a blocked gulley on the roof. The rain last night\u2019s found its way in. You need to get that looked at sharpish, or the whole wall will be ruined.\u201d She gestured back towards her van. \u201cI\u2019ve got the gear for it, if your usual fellas are busy.\u201d The gardener looked from the rapidly darkening stain to her van, a lifeline appearing just as the ship was sinking. He knew how much a specialist call-out would cost, and how long it would take. Ragan could see the calculations turning over in his head. \u201cThe management company will have my hide,\u201d he muttered. \u201cAlright. Can you get up there? See what the damage is?\u201d\n\nAn hour later, after a series of frantic phone calls between the gardener, a flustered property manager in Bristol, and a tacit approval from Marcus Vance\u2019s personal assistant in London, Ragan was standing inside the silent, plushly carpeted lobby of the annex. She had been hired. She carried a toolbox in one hand and the coiled endoscope in the other. \u201cThe leak seems to be affecting the top two flats,\u201d the gardener had told her. \u201cNumber six, that\u2019s the Vances\u2019. And number five below it. You\u2019ll need to check them both for internal damage.\u201d It was a perfect, unimpeachable pretext. She took the lift to the third floor, the ride smooth and silent. The lift doors opened onto a small, private landing, serving only one apartment. Number Six. The air was still and smelled faintly of lavender and dust. She stood before a plain, dark wood door with a simple, elegant silver \u20186\u2019 on it. She took a breath, raised her hand, and knocked. The sound was unnervingly loud in the quiet building. She waited, her heart a steady, heavy drum in her chest. For a long moment, there was only silence. Then, she heard the delicate click of multiple locks being undone. The door opened a few inches, held by a security chain. A single, pale blue eye, magnified by the narrow gap, peered out at her. It was the eye of Elara Vance. \u201cYes?\u201d the voice was small, thin, and laced with an undisguised annoyance. \u201cI\u2019m from Responsive Caretaking,\u201d Ragan said, her voice calm and level, holding up a work order a-flutter with fabricated details. \u201cI\u2019m here about the leak. I need to check your interior walls for water damage.\u201dThe single eye in the sliver of doorway was cold, devoid of curiosity, and held the deep, flat stillness of a predator that has never known fear. For a moment, Ragan felt the sheer force of the girl's cloistered world pushing back at her, a silent pressure telling her to leave. But Ragan\u2019s own gravity was stronger, forged in a lifetime of dealing with obstinate reality. She held the work order steady, a flimsy paper shield imbued with all the authority of the mundane world.\n\n\"The property manager authorised it,\" Ragan added, her voice a solid, immovable object. \"The water could be getting into the floorboards. It'll cause rot. Structural damage. It\u2019s a bigger job if you leave it.\" She was speaking the language of consequence, a tongue Elara's father would undoubtedly understand, and therefore one that held power even here. The eye blinked. A flicker of calculation. A bigger job meant more people, more disruption. The security chain rattled and slid back. The door swung open.\n\nRagan stepped inside, and the smell hit her with the force of a physical blow. It was the same sickeningly sweet scent from the Bogside, but stripped of the tragic undertones of decay. Here, it was pure, clean, and horribly potent, the smell of a laboratory dedicated to the creation of a single, toxic perfume. The apartment was not a home. It was a stage set. The walls and floor were a sterile, seamless white. The furniture was minimal, chosen for form rather than comfort: a single metal chair, a low white table, and in the corner, a plush crimson velvet cushion resting on a polished steel stool, exactly as it appeared in the photographs. It was a sterile, lifeless space, meticulously designed to be the perfect, anonymous backdrop for Josephine\u2019s performance.\n\nElara Vance closed the door behind Ragan, the sound of the locks clicking back into place echoing in the minimalist space. In person, she was an absence, a void where a personality should be. Her eyes, which held such hypnotic power online, were dull and empty. She watched Ragan with a detached impatience, her arms crossed tight against her chest as if warding off a chill. \"The wall is over there,\" she said, her voice a monotone, gesturing vaguely towards the far side of the room.\n\nRagan nodded, her own performance beginning. She set down her toolbox with a solid clunk and uncoiled the endoscope camera, its black cable snaking onto the pristine white floor. \"I'll need to check the whole wall. See how far it's spread,\" she said, her gaze sweeping the room, her mind a rapid-fire inventory. There it was. On a long white desk against the far wall. The command centre. A high-end laptop, a professional-grade camera on a tripod aimed at an empty chair, studio lighting, and beside it all, like a grotesque trophy, sat the 'Splurge-Gun v.2'. It was identical to Liam\u2019s, a garish thing of orange and green plastic, its reservoir gleaming with the familiar, pearlescent pink liquid.\n\n\"I need to get behind the desk, miss,\" Ragan said, her tone matter-of-fact. \"The damp often follows the electrical conduits. Have to be thorough.\" Elara\u2019s expression tightened, a flicker of annoyance crossing her blank features. This was an intrusion into the inner sanctum. For a moment, she looked as if she might refuse, but the logic of the situation, the unassailable authority of a practical problem, held sway. With a sigh of profound irritation, she moved to the desk and slid the chair out of the way, her movements grudging and stiff.\n\nAs Ragan knelt, pretending to inspect the skirting board with a small moisture meter, she glanced up at the laptop screen. It was open to a private messaging forum. The screen was a rolling cascade of adoration and anticipation. *\u2018I\u2019m so ready, Josephine. I can\u2019t wait for Saturday.\u2019 \u2018My gun is full of love for you!\u2019 \u2018We will be so beautiful together!\u2019* Below the messages, a countdown clock ticked relentlessly downwards. Two days, fourteen hours, thirty-one minutes. Ragan felt a surge of cold fury. These were the voices of the damned, singing praises to their executioner. She looked at Elara, who was watching her with narrowed, suspicious eyes, a queen disturbed at her work. The time was now.\n\n\"Ah, found a bit of a damp patch here,\" Ragan grunted, shifting her weight. \"Just need to get a better look. Tricky angle.\" It was the oldest trick in her book: the feigned stumble, the moment of contrived clumsiness that created an opportunity. She rose, turning as if to get a different tool from her box. In a single, fluid motion that was both awkward and utterly deliberate, her heavy work boot caught the leg of the tripod holding the studio light. It swayed for a dramatic second before crashing sideways, directly into the desk. Elara let out a sharp, involuntary gasp.\n\nThe chaos was a perfect cover. As the light hit the desk, Ragan, in her lunge to \u2018save\u2019 it, sent a heavy-duty wrench skittering from her tool belt. It slid across the smooth white surface and struck the 'Splurge-Gun', knocking it from its perch. It hit the floor with a wet, sickening crack, the brittle plastic of its reservoir shattering. A thick, viscous tide of pink goo spread instantly across the pristine white floor, the smell intensifying to an overwhelming, suffocating sweetness. \"Oh, Christ, I'm so sorry!\" Ragan exclaimed, her voice a pitch-perfect blend of panic and apology. \"Clumsy oaf, my feet are all over the place today.\"\n\nBut Elara wasn't looking at the spreading pink mess. Her eyes were fixed on the laptop. In the chaos, the falling tripod had knocked a half-full glass of water, left on the desk, directly over the machine's keyboard. The screen flickered violently, displayed a frantic scramble of multicoloured pixels, and then went black. A final, pathetic hiss of dying electronics was the only sound. Elara stared at the dead screen, her mouth slightly agape. For a full five seconds, she was frozen, her brain unable to process the catastrophe. Then, a sound emerged from her throat, a sound unlike the cooing whispers or the flat monotones Ragan had heard before. It was a raw, guttural shriek of pure, animalistic rage and loss.\n\n\"NO!\" she screamed, her voice cracking, her entire body trembling. \"No, no, no, what did you DO?\" She scrambled towards the desk, ignoring the pink goo that soaked into the hem of her sweatpants. Her fingers flew frantically over the dead, wet keyboard, slapping at the keys as if she could physically beat the machine back to life. \"My darlings! I can't talk to them! They're waiting for me!\" The mask of Josephine, the serene goddess, and the mask of Elara, the bored recluse, had both been shattered. What was left was a terrified, powerless child, her favourite toy broken beyond repair, her entire world gone dark.\n\nRagan backed away, her face a carefully constructed mask of horrified apology. \"I am so, so sorry, miss. It was a complete accident. I'll pay for the damages, of course. My insurance will cover everything.\" She was already gathering her things, her movements swift and purposeful. She had done the job. She had not only severed the connection; she had destroyed the tools of the trade, all under the perfect, unimpeachable cover of a workplace accident. \"I'll have to file a full incident report. We'll need to get an electrician to check the wiring now, and a technician for the computer.\" Every word was another layer of bureaucratic nightmare designed to keep Elara isolated and offline. Ragan left her there, kneeling in a sticky pink apocalypse of her own making, cradling the dead laptop to her chest and emitting a series of high, wounded keening sounds. The Grand Union had been cancelled. Ragan stepped out into the landing, pulled the door shut, and leaned against the wall, the adrenaline finally washing over her in a great, shuddering wave. She had cleaned up the source. Now she just had to get away before the real mess began.The silence that followed the closing of the door was a physical entity, pressing in on Ragan from all sides. It was broken only by the muffled, animalistic sobs from within apartment six, the sound of a god whose universe had just winked out of existence. Ragan took a single, ragged breath, the clean, cool air of the landing a shocking antidote to the cloying sweetness that still coated the back of her throat. She flexed her hands, which were trembling slightly, not with fear, but with the subsiding surge of pure, focused adrenaline. The job was done. The immediate threat was neutralized. Now came the most dangerous part: the clean-up and the getaway. She picked up her toolbox and the endoscope, her movements returning to their usual economy, her face settling back into a mask of grim professional concern.\n\nHer descent in the lift was the longest thirty seconds of her life. She half-expected the doors to open on a phalanx of police officers, summoned by a panicked Elara. She expected to hear alarms, shouts, the sound of running feet. But there was only the gentle hum of the lift\u2019s motor and the soft ping as it arrived at the ground floor. She stepped out into the lobby, her heart hammering a steady, powerful rhythm against her ribs. The gardener was there, hovering anxiously by the main door, his face a mask of worry. He saw her and rushed forward. \"What happened? I heard a crash, and a scream\u2026\"\n\n\"A disaster,\" Ragan said, shaking her head with a pitch-perfect display of exhausted frustration. \"A pure disaster. The tenant, the young woman, she startled me while I was on my knees, and I went over like a sack of spuds. Knocked over a lamp, a load of computer stuff. Water everywhere. The machine's fried. And I've knocked over some\u2026 craft project she was working on. Pink stuff. All over her white floor. It\u2019s a complete write-off.\" She ran a hand over her face, the very picture of a tradeswoman having the worst day of her career. \"She\u2019s hysterical, and I don't blame her. You\u2019ll need to get the management company to send a specialist cleaner, an electrician, a computer technician\u2026 the lot. My insurance will cover it all, of course. I'll call my office now and get the incident report started.\" She was building a wall of paperwork and procedure around the event, a firewall of mundane bureaucracy that would, with any luck, obscure the truth of what had just happened. The gardener paled, imagining the phone calls and angry emails. \"Right,\" he said, deflating. \"Right. I\u2019ll\u2026 I\u2019ll call the manager.\" Ragan nodded, gave him a grim look of shared misery, and pushed her way out into the blessedly fresh, damp air of the Bath afternoon.\n\nThe walk back to the van was a slow, deliberate march away from a blast zone. She did not look back. Every step was a small victory, carrying her further from the gilded cage she had just rattled to its foundations. Once inside the familiar, scuffed interior of the Transit, she locked the doors and leaned her forehead against the cold steering wheel, the scent of diesel and old tea a profound comfort. She allowed herself sixty seconds of stillness, her body finally acknowledging the strain. Then she sat up, pulled her phone from her pocket, and dialled. McIlvanney answered on the first ring, his voice a taut wire of stress. \"Ragan, where are you? We've had a team on standby\u2026\"\n\n\"Stand them down,\" Ragan said, her voice a low, gravelly rasp. \"Or rather, send them in. But they'll need a paramedic, not an arrest warrant.\" She gave him a clipped, professional summary, editing out her own intent and presenting it as a chain of unfortunate events. \"There was an accident during the inspection. The subject's equipment has been\u2026 decommissioned. Permanently. The laptop is destroyed. Her communication with the network is severed. The primary device for the\u2026 ritual\u2026 is also broken. Subject is in a state of extreme distress. The connection is cut, Inspector.\"\n\nThere was a stunned silence on the other end of the line, so profound that Ragan could hear the faint hum of a computer in his office. \"You had an *accident*,\" McIlvanney repeated slowly, the words dripping with a mixture of incandescent fury and utter, incredulous relief. \"You just happened to have an *accident* that accomplished in ten minutes what would have taken my colleagues in Somerset a week of court orders to even attempt.\"\n\n\"I'm a caretaker, Inspector,\" Ragan replied, the engine of the Transit already turning over. \"Messes happen. My job is to sort them out. This one\u2019s sorted. The rest is up to you.\" She pulled away from the kerb without another word, merging into the traffic, a shabby white van disappearing into the elegant city. She was just another contractor leaving a job, a ghost slipping away from the scene of the crime she had both committed and prevented.\n\nThe long drive north was a journey through a decompression chamber. As the honeyed stone of Bath gave way to the anonymous grey of the motorway, Ragan felt the tension slowly begin to recede from her shoulders. The silence in the van was broken only by the drone of the engine and the rhythmic slap of the windscreen wipers. The adrenaline had worn off, leaving behind a bone-deep weariness that settled in her marrow. She had averted the Grand Union. She had saved God knows how many lost souls from a sticky, grotesque end. But she felt no triumph. She had seen the void in Elara Vance\u2019s eyes, the terrifying emptiness that she had filled with this monstrous, twee fantasy. She had not vanquished a monster; she had broken a profoundly sick and lonely child, and the thought left a bitter, metallic taste in her mouth.\n\nHours later, parked in the grim, fluorescent glare of a motorway service station somewhere in the Midlands, she allowed herself to look. She pulled out her phone, her fingers fumbling slightly with exhaustion, and navigated to the forums of Josephine\u2019s Sweeties. The change was instantaneous and seismic. The countdown clock was gone. The page was a chaotic storm of panic and confusion. *'Where is she? Josephine, are you there?' 'The video has been deleted!' 'I was ready! What is happening?' 'Is this a test? A test of our love?'* The ecstatic devotion had curdled into fear. Their god had gone silent on the eve of their ascension. Ragan scrolled through the frantic messages, a new kind of coldness creeping over her. She had cut the head off the snake, but the body was still thrashing, leaderless and unpredictable. The stain hadn't been entirely cleaned. It had just been smeared. She closed the browser, finished her bitter, lukewarm coffee, and pointed the van north, towards the sea, towards home. The job was done, but the aftermath, she knew, was just beginning.The ferry ride back was a passage through purgatory. Ragan sat in the sterile cafeteria, staring out at the churning, slate-grey water of the Irish Sea, the rhythmic vibration of the engines a constant thrum in her bones. She felt hollowed out, scoured clean by the events of the past week. The other passengers, families returning from holidays with sun-pinked skin and oversized bags of souvenirs, existed in a different universe, one governed by schedules and simple pleasures. Ragan felt like she was returning from a war no one else knew was being fought, carrying the invisible shrapnel of it home with her. The familiar sight of the Northern Irish coast, a dark green smudge on the horizon, brought no comfort, only a profound sense of dislocation.\n\nStepping out of her van in Derry felt like stepping onto a different planet. The air was thick with the familiar, damp chill, a mixture of river water, old stone, and the faint, acrid scent of distant coal smoke. It was the smell of home, but her senses were still tainted by the ghost of that other smell, the cloying, synthetic sweetness that now felt like a permanent stain on her memory. She drove to her small terraced house, the streets of her city looking both achingly familiar and subtly changed, as if a filter had been placed over her eyes. The mundane details\u2014a neighbour putting out their recycling bin, a gaggle of schoolchildren in uniform\u2014seemed impossibly, beautifully normal, yet she felt utterly disconnected from them, a spectator watching a play about a life she used to live.\n\nThe next day, she forced herself back into her routine, accepting a small job Eamonn had left for her: a blocked gutter in a house near the university. She stood on a ladder in the light drizzle, her hands working with their old, familiar competence, pulling out fistfuls of sodden leaves and black sludge. The physical work was a relief, a grounding reality. But as she worked, her mind kept drifting. The curve of the gutter reminded her of the Royal Victoria Crescent; the gurgle of the newly cleared downpipe sounded like the hiss of a dying laptop. She found herself scanning the faces of the students walking past, their faces buried in their phones, and wondered how many of them were lonely, how many were lost, how many were just a few clicks away from finding their own Josephine. The world suddenly seemed filled with invisible traps, its surfaces hiding a deep and terrifying rot.\n\nThe call from McIlvanney came that afternoon, as she was cleaning her tools in the garage. His voice was different, stripped of its usual layers of sarcasm and irritation. It was the flat, tired voice of a man who had seen too much and now had to file the paperwork. He told her the official story, the one that would be fed to the press if anyone ever asked. There had been an incident at a luxury apartment in Bath. A young woman, Elara Vance, had suffered a severe psychotic break. There had been a minor electrical fire from a faulty lamp, and the water used to douse it had damaged some electronics. She was now in a secure private psychiatric facility, her father\u2019s money ensuring complete discretion. The police had logged it as a mental health crisis, case closed.\n\n\"They found her kneeling on the floor, covered in pink paint, holding a broken laptop and talking to people who weren't there,\" McIlvanney said, his voice low. \"The IT guys in Somerset managed to get a ghost of her hard drive. It was all there. Just like you said. The forums, the videos, the\u2026 recipes. They\u2019re calling it \u2018induced delusional disorder on a mass scale\u2019. Christ, Ragan. There were thousands of them, all waiting for the signal on Saturday. God only knows how many would have gone through with it.\" He paused, and Ragan heard him draw a heavy breath. \"Off the record, you did a good thing. A mad, illegal, reckless thing that I will deny until my dying day. But you did it. Thank you.\"\n\nThe thanks landed with a dull thud, offering no comfort. \"And the others?\" Ragan asked, her gaze falling on the corner of her desk where her own computer sat, a silent gateway to that other world. \"The Sweeties? What about them?\" A weary sigh came down the line. \"They\u2019re scattered. Panicked. The main Josephine page was taken down by the platform\u2019s moderators once Somerset sent them the warrant. But the smaller forums are still active. It\u2019s like smashing a mercury thermometer. You\u2019re just left with hundreds of toxic little balls rolling into dark corners. We can\u2019t police them all. It's over, Ragan. We stopped the main event. Now let it go. Go back to fixing taps. It's what you're good at.\"\n\nBut Ragan knew she couldn't let it go. That night, sleep offered no rest, only a frantic, looping dream of a countdown clock ticking towards zero. Before the sun had even risen, she was in her small office, the familiar smell of disinfectant doing little to cleanse the phantom sweetness from her mind. She turned on her computer and descended once more into the digital underworld. The main Josephine page was gone, replaced with a sterile, corporate notice about terms of service violations. But McIlvanney was right. The smaller forums, the private messaging groups, were still there, and they were mutating. In the power vacuum, new narratives were being born. The confusion of the first few days had given way to something harder, more dangerous. A schism had occurred. Some groups had dissolved, their members expressing disillusionment and fear. But others had coalesced around a new, darker faith.\n\nShe found a forum called \u2018The Sweetest Truth\u2019, and what she saw there made her blood run cold. They had a new prophet. A user named \u2018Anthem\u2019, who had previously been a minor but zealous disciple, was now holding court. His posts were not the cloying, whispery prose of Josephine. They were filled with rage and a call to arms. He had created a new mythology. Josephine had not abandoned them. She had been martyred. She had been taken from them by the \u2018Bitters\u2019, the \u2018Unsweet\u2019\u2014the cruel, unloving world that could not understand their purity. The \u2018accident\u2019 in her apartment was an attack. Josephine was a prisoner, and it was their duty not to join her in a passive union, but to fight for her. The language had shifted from self-annihilation to retribution. The posts were no longer about feet and candy. They were about identifying the Bitters. They were about \u2018sharing their love\u2019 in a new, more aggressive way. Anthem had posted a new design for a Splurge-Gun, \u2018v.3\u2019, reinforced, with a higher-pressure nozzle. Not a tool for a ritual, but a weapon.\n\nRagan felt a sickness rise in her, a feeling worse than anything she had felt in Bath. She had cut off the head of the hydra, only for two more to grow in its place, uglier and more venomous than the first. She scrolled through the messages, her caretaker\u2019s eye for detail picking out the chilling specifics. They were trying to find out who had been in the apartment. They were looking for the \u2018Bitter\u2019 who had taken their Queen. They were piecing together a puzzle, sharing scraps of information gleaned from the gardener\u2019s gossip passed through the building\u2019s other residents, filtered through the property management company. They were looking for a cleaning company. For a woman with a Derry accent. For a white Ford Transit. Ragan stood up, backing away from the screen as if it were radioactive. The stain wasn't just smeared. It was spreading back towards her. Her job wasn\u2019t over. She hadn\u2019t just cleaned up the source. She had become the target.The transition from a global threat to a personal one was seamless, a simple re-angling of the lens. Ragan stood in the cold, familiar silence of her garage, the only light coming from the computer screen where the words \u2018a woman with a Derry accent\u2019 burned with a malevolent, phosphorescent glow. The space, her sanctuary of order and solvent, suddenly felt porous, its brick walls no defence against a danger that could travel as a whisper on a forum and arrive as a footstep in the night. The digital mess she had tried to contain in Bath had not been cleaned up; it had aerosolized, and now she was breathing it in. This was no longer about saving the lost. This was about survival.\n\nHer first move was not one of panic, but of ingrained, methodical habit. She shut down the computer, cutting the connection to the seething digital hive. She went to her small kitchenette in the corner of the office and boiled the kettle, her movements precise and unhurried. As she brewed a mug of tea so strong it was almost black, she catalogued the problem as she would a complex structural fault. The enemy knew her profession. They knew her city. They knew the type of vehicle she drove. They knew her gender and accent. They did not, she reasoned, have her name or her face. Not yet. The information was fractured, a collection of details gathered from the periphery. They were hunting a ghost, a description, not a person. It was a small advantage, but Ragan had built her life on the marginal gains found in small details.\n\nWhen she stepped outside the next morning, the world had been re-contextualized. Every white van parked on a residential street was a potential surveillance post. Every passing pedestrian whose gaze lingered for a second too long was a possible scout. Her own Transit, parked in its usual spot, was no longer a symbol of her trade but a billboard advertising her presence. The sensible blue lettering spelling 'Ragan's Responsive Caretaking' seemed to scream her identity into the quiet morning air. For the first time, she felt a flicker of true, cold fear. It was the feeling of being exposed, of having her carefully ordered world rendered vulnerable by an enemy who obeyed no rules but their own grotesque scripture. She had spent a lifetime making places safe, and now her own had become the most dangerous place of all.\n\nThe message arrived not through a screen, but on glass. It was placed on the windscreen of her van, directly in her line of sight. It was a single, black ant, its tiny legs curled in death, perfectly preserved within a small, domed drop of hardened pink goo. It was a jewel of malice, a piece of their ritual art delivered to her doorstep. The morning dew had collected around its base, making the obscene little relic glitter in the weak sunlight. There was no note, no threat scrawled in lipstick. There didn't need to be. The symbol was the message: *We see you. We are here. The Bitters will be made sweet.* It was a declaration of intent, a promise that the war had come home to Derry.\n\nAny other person might have recoiled, might have wiped the thing away in disgust and fear. Ragan\u2019s reaction was colder, more practical. She went back into her garage and returned with a small evidence bag and a thin, flexible palette knife she used for removing old sealant. With the delicate precision of an archaeologist uncovering a fossil, she carefully scraped the pink dome from the glass. The substance was brittle, flaking slightly at the edges, but it held. She sealed it in the bag, her name for the new exhibit already forming in her mind: \u2018Anthem, Exhibit A\u2019. She was not a victim to be terrorized. She was an opponent, and this was the enemy\u2019s first mistake. They had given her a piece of themselves, a physical clue in a world of digital ghosts. She had a sample of their new work.\n\nShe knew she could not handle this alone. The game had changed, and her solitary crusade was no longer sustainable. She sat in the driver\u2019s seat of her van, the small plastic bag with its macabre contents lying on the passenger seat, and dialled DI McIlvanney. He sounded relieved to hear from her, his tone that of a man who had successfully closed a difficult file. The relief evaporated as she spoke. She described the new forum, the 'Sweetest Truth'. She described the shift in ideology from self-harm to retribution, and the hunt for the \u2018Bitter\u2019 who had martyred their queen. She told him about the ant.\n\n\u201cThey left me a present on my van this morning, Inspector,\u201d she said, her voice a low, steady thrum of controlled anger. \u201cOne of their little pink bonbons. They are here. In the city. And they are looking for me.\u201d A long, heavy silence stretched down the line, filled with the unspoken weight of McIlvanney\u2019s dawning horror. This wasn\u2019t a case he had closed; it was a shapeshifting nightmare that had followed his informant home. \u201cStay inside, Ragan,\u201d he said, his voice dropping to an urgent command. \u201cLock your doors. Don\u2019t go anywhere. I\u2019ll have a patrol car do a drive-by every hour. We\u2019ll look into the forum, see if we can get a location on this \u2018Anthem\u2019 character.\u201d His words were meant to be reassuring, but to Ragan they sounded like a recipe for a siege, for becoming a prisoner in her own home.\n\nLaying low was not a solution; it was a delaying tactic. It was waiting for the damp to become rot, for the crack to become a chasm. She looked at the bag on the seat, at the tiny, silent messenger. They thought they were hunting her, but they had misjudged their quarry. They saw a caretaker, a cleaner, an old woman. They didn\u2019t see the person who had dismantled their goddess with a toolbox and a lie. The fear she had felt earlier was now burning away, replaced by a cold, hard resolve that settled deep in her bones. She would not wait for them to find her. She would not hide behind locked doors while a patrol car drove past. She would do what she always did. She would trace the problem to its source. Her garage was no longer just a sanctuary; it was a command post. Her van was not a liability; it was a tool. The hunt for Josephine was over. The hunt for Anthem was about to begin.The siege lasted exactly twelve hours. For twelve hours, Ragan did as she was told. She locked the heavy-duty bolts on her garage door and the reinforced locks on the house. She sat in her small, tidy living room, a place she normally only used for paperwork and Sunday evenings, and felt the silence of the house press in on her. The hourly drive-by of the PSNI patrol car was not a comfort; it was a rhythmic reminder of her own imprisonment. Each time its headlights swept across her front window, she felt a fresh surge of impotent fury. This was not safety. This was containment. She was a specimen in a jar, waiting for the researchers to decide what to do next, while the danger grew unchecked outside.\n\nBy dawn, her patience, a notoriously shallow reservoir to begin with, had evaporated completely. She moved from the house to the garage, her true domain, and placed the small evidence bag on her steel workbench under the stark, unforgiving light of a fluorescent tube. The hardened pink dome was a perfect, obscene little jewel. She took a scalpel from her toolbox and, with a surgeon\u2019s precision, shaved off a small sliver of the material. It was sugary, yes, but there was a new undertone to the scent, a sharper, more chemical bite than the craft glue she remembered from Liam\u2019s flat. She subjected a fragment to the flame of a butane torch; it blackened and hissed, giving off an acrid smoke that was nothing like burning sugar. It was a polymer. A plastic. Her eyes scanned the shelves of her own supplies, the cans of solvents and resins she used for specialised repairs. She knew this smell. It was epoxy. The new recipe for the Splurge-Gun was not just a confection; it was an industrial adhesive, designed for a permanent, unyielding bond. This was not a weapon for a symbolic, gentle union. This was a weapon designed to incapacitate, to bind, to hold.\n\nThe realisation that they had upgraded their arsenal galvanised her. Hiding was no longer just an affront to her nature; it was a tactical error of the highest order. She went to work on her van, not to fortify it, but to erase it. The 'Ragan's Responsive Caretaking' lettering had been on the side of the Transit for fifteen years, a proud declaration of her independence and competence. With a heat gun and a plastic scraper, she began the painstaking process of peeling it away. The vinyl came off in stubborn, ragged strips, taking slivers of paint with it, leaving behind a ghostly, pale blue silhouette of her name on the darker, weathered paintwork. When she was done, the Transit was anonymous, a generic work van, one of thousands that traversed the city\u2019s streets every day. She had shed her skin, becoming just another part of the city's background noise, a perfect camouflage for a hunter.\n\nHer new caretaking rounds began. Her search grid was a map of Derry\u2019s commercial arteries, marked with every large supermarket, DIY chain, and, most importantly, every small, specialist hobby shop. She reasoned that this new cult, this \u2018Sweetest Truth\u2019, would be sourcing its materials locally. Anthem was building a cell here in her city, and cells needed supplies. For two days, she drifted through the city like a ghost, her van parked in rain-slicked car parks, her eyes scanning the flow of humanity. She walked the aisles of Tesco and B&Q, her gaze sweeping over the baking supplies and the adhesives, watching for anyone buying the wrong combination of items. It was a search for a needle in a haystack the size of a city, and it was maddening, soul-crushingly tedious work. McIlvanney called, his voice tight with controlled anger. \"My patrol car reported your van was gone, Ragan. Where the hell are you?\" She told him she was running an errand. \"Your errand is to stay alive!\" he\u2019d barked back. \"Get home. That's an order.\" She had hung up, the order dying in the empty air of her van.\n\nThe breakthrough came on the third day, not in a gleaming superstore, but in a cramped, dusty model shop tucked away on a side street off the Strand Road, a place that smelled of enamel paint and old cardboard. It catered to a dedicated clientele of model railway enthusiasts and wargamers. Through the grime-caked window, she saw him. He was young, no more than twenty, with a thin, wispy beard and the pale, indoor complexion of someone who lived their life through a screen. His eyes had the same unsettling combination of vacancy and zealous intensity she had seen in the profile pictures of the Sweeties. He was at the counter, and the shopkeeper was bagging his purchases: two large twin-packs of a high-performance epoxy resin, the kind used for building remote-control aircraft, and three small vials of a vivid, glossy 'Signal Pink' acrylic paint. It was the V.3 recipe. It was the blood of the new sacrament.\n\nRagan\u2019s heart began a slow, heavy beat, a drum signaling the start of the real hunt. She entered the shop, picked up a can of matte varnish she had no use for, and got in line behind him. She could smell the faint, unwashed scent of him, the odour of someone who had forgotten the basic rituals of self-care in favour of a more consuming devotion. He paid in cash, his hands trembling slightly as he stuffed the small plastic bag into the pocket of his anorak. He scurried out of the shop like a nocturnal creature startled by the light. Ragan paid for her varnish, her movements calm, her expression placid. She walked out, got into her anonymous blue van, and waited. A moment later, the young man appeared at the end of the street, pulling up the hood of his coat against the drizzle and beginning to walk, his pace hurried and furtive.\n\nThe pursuit was a delicate art. She gave him a hundred-yard lead, following him not as a car, but as a slow, patient predator. She tracked his route through the city, past the Guildhall, over the Craigavon Bridge, and into the sprawling, anonymous housing estates of the Waterside. These were newer streets, a labyrinth of identical semi-detached houses and neatly trimmed lawns that all blurred into one. This was a world away from the historic intensity of the Bogside; it was a landscape of quiet, suburban isolation, the perfect breeding ground for a bedroom cult. The young man turned into a cul-de-sac, walked up the driveway of a neat but slightly neglected-looking house\u2014the grass a little too long, a newspaper still in the letterbox from the day before\u2014and let himself in. Ragan drove past slowly, her eyes fixing the house number, the colour of the door, the make of the car in the drive. She continued to the end of the street, turned the van around, and parked in a spot that gave her a clear, unobstructed view of the front of the house. The thread she had found in the model shop had led her here. She had found the nest. The lights were on inside, and somewhere in that unassuming brick house, Anthem and his disciples were preparing for their war.The house in the Waterside was a monument to suburban anonymity. It was a semi-detached brick box, identical to its neighbours on the left and right, distinguished only by a slightly overgrown lawn and curtains that remained perpetually drawn. From her vantage point at the far end of the quiet cul-de-sac, Ragan watched the rhythms of the street unfold. Children on bicycles wobbled past, a postman made his cheerful rounds, neighbours exchanged pleasantries over garden fences. It was a portrait of mundane peace, and the house in the centre of her vision was a cancer hidden within it, its occupants utterly alien to the world just inches from their front door. For a full day and night, she watched, a patient, motionless figure in the driver's seat of an unremarkable blue van, her existence marked only by the slow clouding of her own breath on the inside of the windscreen.\n\nMore of them arrived. Not in a fleet of black cars, but drifting in one by one, like leaves caught in an invisible current. The young man from the model shop was the first. Later, a girl with haunted, hollowed-out eyes and a limp jacket two sizes too big for her arrived on a bus, walking the last half-mile with her head bowed. A boy who couldn't have been more than seventeen was dropped off by his mother, who waved cheerfully from her hatchback as he scurried inside without a backward glance. There were four of them in total, plus whoever lived there permanently. A coven of the lost and the lonely, drawn to the promise of Anthem's new, violent gospel. They did not emerge. Lights burned in the upstairs windows throughout the night, casting a sickly yellow glow that seemed fundamentally different from the warm, domestic light of the surrounding houses. They were busy. They were preparing.\n\nThe opportunity, when it came, was a gift from the Derry City Council. Tuesday was bin day. In the pre-dawn darkness, long before the first hint of grey lightened the sky, Ragan slipped from her van. She was a shadow in work boots, moving with a silent, purposeful grace. The bins from the target house had been left at the edge of the drive, overflowing. This was Ragan\u2019s true area of expertise: the analysis of what people discard. She worked quickly, her gloved hands sifting through the domestic refuse. The findings were a chilling confirmation. She found the empty, stiff plastic packets of the epoxy resin, dozens of them. She found the small, empty vials of \u2018Signal Pink\u2019 paint. She found a mountain of takeaway cartons and energy drink cans, the fuel for their manic preparations. And then, at the bottom of a black bag, wrapped in a grease-stained pizza box, she found their plans.\n\nIt was a promotional leaflet for the upcoming \u2018Festival of Unity\u2019, a free peace concert scheduled for the next evening in Guildhall Square. The leaflet was covered in frantic, handwritten notes. A crude map had been drawn, marking out the main stage, the exits, and the position of the first aid tents. Three locations around the perimeter of the square were circled in thick black marker. And on the back of the leaflet, a list. Not of names, but of titles: \u2018The Mayor\u2019, \u2018The Chief Constable\u2019, \u2018The Bishop\u2019. It was a target list. They weren't planning a symbolic protest. They weren't planning on harming themselves. They were planning an attack. They intended to use their new, industrial-grade Splurge-Guns to incapacitate the city\u2019s leadership in the middle of a peace concert. The irony was so grotesque, so utterly perverse, it made Ragan feel physically sick. The \u2018Sweetest Truth\u2019 was not a metaphor. It was a battle plan.\n\nShe was on the phone to McIlvanney before she was even back in her van, the leaflet clutched in her gloved hand like a death warrant. She didn't give him time to berate her. She laid it out in a cold, clear monotone: the house, the cell, the epoxy, the target, the concert, the list of civic leaders. She was not presenting a theory; she was delivering a finished intelligence report. The silence on the other end was a stretched, taut thing, the sound of a man\u2019s entire worldview being forcibly realigned. He didn't question her. He didn't doubt her. The time for that was long past. \"I'll get the warrant,\" he said, his voice a low, dangerous growl she had never heard from him before. \"I'll call the Tactical Support Group myself. We'll take them down tonight.\"\n\nBut Ragan, looking at the quiet, sleeping house, felt a cold dread that had nothing to do with the occupants. The concert was less than thirty-six hours away. A warrant, even a rush job, had to navigate a chain of command. It had to be signed by a judge. It had to be planned. It was a process, and processes had delays, hitches, unforeseen complications. The system was a cumbersome, heavy machine, and she had seen firsthand how quickly these new cults could move. She could not afford to put her faith in a signature. She had to build an insurance policy. She watched as a bedroom light went out in the house, a sign that one of the zealots was finally sleeping. She looked at the family car parked in the driveway, a perfectly ordinary Ford Focus. It was their only means of transporting themselves and their grotesque arsenal to the city centre. And in that moment, Ragan the informant was once again replaced by Ragan the caretaker. She saw a problem that needed a practical, hands-on solution.\n\nThat night, as the last of the streetlights flickered off and the cul-de-sac was plunged into a deep, suburban darkness, she moved. She was not a saboteur; she was a mechanic performing a very specific, preventative repair. She slid under the Ford Focus, the damp tarmac cold against her back, a small penlight held between her teeth. She located the fuel line, a thin, vulnerable artery running along the chassis. With a pair of wire snips from her tool belt, she didn't sever it completely. That would be too obvious, a pool of petrol on the driveway that would be seen immediately. Instead, she made a small, precise nick in the rubber, a tiny wound that would weep, not gush. It would be enough. The car would start. It would drive a few hundred yards, maybe half a mile. And then, as the air bled into the line and starved the engine, it would die. It would fail them, not on their doorstep where they could fix it, but out in the open, exposed on a public road. As she slid back out from under the car, a movement in an upstairs window caught her eye. A curtain was pulled back an inch. A pale face, featureless in the dark, looked out. Ragan froze, her body becoming one with the deep shadow of a neighbour\u2019s hedge. For a long, heart-stopping moment, the face remained, a silent observer in the night. Then, the curtain fell back into place. Ragan didn\u2019t know if she had been seen. It didn\u2019t matter. The job was done. She retreated to her van, her heart a cold, steady engine, and settled in to wait for the morning, and for the inevitable chaos to begin.The morning broke grey and indecisive, the sky a canopy of bruised clouds that threatened a rain that never quite came. From her position of vigil, Ragan watched the house. The drawn curtains were a blank, unreadable face, giving nothing away. The silence of the cul-de-sac was a thin veneer over a pit of churning activity she could only imagine. Inside that brick box, a small group of radicalised youths were preparing to bring their bizarre, sticky jihad to the heart of the city. Ragan nursed a cold mug of tea, the bitter taste a welcome anchor in the surreal stillness. She was a landmine, buried and waiting. She had laid her trap. Now, all she could do was wait for the pressure that would trigger it.\n\nThe phone call from McIlvanney came just after ten o'clock, his voice a low, frantic rasp, frayed at the edges with the static of bureaucratic friction. \"The warrant's stalled, Ragan. The judge we need is at a conference in Belfast. His deputy won't sign off on a no-knock raid based on evidence retrieved from a dustbin by a civilian informant. They\u2019re calling it circumstantial. The TSG are sat in their briefing room playing cards. I can\u2019t move them. I can\u2019t do a bloody thing until I get that signature, and that might not be until this afternoon. Too late.\" It was the sound of a good man being strangled by the red tape he was sworn to uphold. \"For the love of all that's holy, stay put. Do not engage. Do not even breathe in their direction. Wait for my call.\"\n\nRagan looked at the quiet house. Waiting was a death sentence. The concert was tonight. Her insurance policy was now the only plan in motion. \"They won't wait for your signature, Inspector,\" she said, her voice flat. \"They're on a schedule.\" She ended the call, the Inspector's unheard protest a faint squawk of frustration. The hours crawled by. The normal life of the cul-de-sac continued around the epicentre of the planned attack. A delivery van dropped off a parcel next door. A dog barked. Ragan felt a strange, chilling detachment, as if she were watching two different films projected onto the same screen.\n\nThen, at half-past three in the afternoon, the front door of the target house opened. They emerged, not as a charging horde, but as a shuffling, nervous pack. There were five of them. Anthem, the pale-faced zealot from the model shop, was clearly the leader, his movements jerky and agitated. The others huddled close behind him, their faces a mixture of fear and ecstatic, wide-eyed resolve. Each of them carried a heavy-looking, overstuffed backpack. They piled into the Ford Focus, a clumsy, uncoordinated scramble of limbs and bags. The engine turned over, coughed, and caught. For a heart-stopping second, Ragan felt a cold spike of doubt. Had the nick been too small? Had it sealed itself? But then the car pulled away from the kerb, its engine sounding rough but functional. It reached the end of the cul-de-sac and turned out onto the main road, heading towards the city centre. Ragan gave them fifty yards, then pulled her own anonymous van out, joining the flow of traffic, a silent, blue shadow in their wake.\n\nThe end came three streets later, on a busy artery clogged with afternoon school-run traffic. Just as Ragan had calculated, the air entering the fuel line finally reached the engine. The Ford Focus sputtered violently, its forward momentum dying as if it had hit an invisible wall. It bucked once, twice, and then coasted to a dead, silent halt in the middle of the lane. Horns immediately began to blare. The sudden, public failure was a catastrophe for them. Their carefully timed, covert plan had disintegrated into a public spectacle of incompetence.\n\nPanic erupted inside the car. Doors flew open and they spilled out onto the tarmac, their faces masks of disbelief and terror. Anthem was shouting, his voice thin and reedy against the cacophony of angry drivers. He tried to herd his small, terrified flock onto the pavement, their backpacks suddenly seeming impossibly large and conspicuous. Their anonymity was gone. They were just a gaggle of strange kids with heavy bags, causing a traffic jam, drawing the one thing they could not afford: attention. They abandoned the car and began to move, a frantic, disorganised cluster, heading on foot towards the city.\n\nThis was the moment. Ragan pulled her van into a side street, her hands steady, her mind clear and cold. She dialled McIlvanney. \"Your warrant is irrelevant,\" she said, her voice cutting through his frantic greeting. \"Your targets' transport has failed. They are on foot. On Glenside Road, heading towards the Craigavon Bridge. Five of them, carrying backpacks. I suspect those packs are full of epoxy resin and high-pressure water pistols. You have a public order situation, reasonable suspicion for a stop and search, and a group of panicked hostiles completely exposed. Your move, Inspector.\"\n\nShe didn't need to say more. She had created the circumstances. She had served the problem up on a platter, right in the middle of a public road where procedure and protocol could not be ignored. She heard McIlvanney barking orders in the background, the controlled chaos of a police response kicking into high gear. Ragan parked her van where she had a clear view of the bridge in the distance. She didn't have to wait long. First came the sirens, a faint, rising wail from multiple directions. Then she saw them: the five small figures, hurrying, almost running now, halfway across the bridge. And from both ends, the flashing blue lights converged. PSNI patrol cars screeched to a halt, blocking their path, trapping them. Uniformed officers, some with protective vests, spilled out, forming a tight, professional cordon. The five cultists froze, their pathetic rebellion ending not with a bang, but with the shriek of tires on wet tarmac. They were ordered to the ground, their hands on their heads. The officers were firm, loud, and utterly in control. One by one, the backpacks were removed and opened. Ragan was too far away to see the contents, but she didn't need to. She saw the sudden stiffening of the officers\u2019 postures, the sharp, unbelieving glances they exchanged. They had found the Splurge-Guns.\n\nRagan watched as her city\u2019s defenders cleaned up the mess she had served to them. She watched as the five pathetic disciples of a broken goddess were cuffed and led away, their faces crumpling from zealous fury into the simple, bewildered terror of children who had been caught. There was no victory in it, only a vast, soul-deep weariness. She had cut out the rot, but the decay was in the wood itself. She started the engine of her van. The peace concert would go on tonight. The Mayor would speak. The Bishop would pray. The city would celebrate its hard-won harmony, blissfully unaware of the bizarre, sticky war that had been fought and won in its streets that afternoon by a caretaker in a sensible blue van. As the last of the police cars sped away, carrying the last vestiges of Anthem\u2019s truth to a cold cell, Sergeant Ragan simply drove home.The peace was a thin, brittle skin stretched over the city. The Festival of Unity had gone ahead, a vibrant, noisy celebration of resilience that Ragan watched on a small television in her kitchen, her hands smelling of bleach and industrial soap. She saw the Mayor speak, her words full of civic pride. She saw the Bishop offer a blessing, his mitre a stark white shape against the darkening sky. She saw teenagers dancing, their faces illuminated by flashing stage lights, utterly oblivious to the fact that their world had almost been painted a sticky, permanent pink. The disconnect was a physical ache in Ragan\u2019s chest. She had averted a catastrophe, and the only evidence was a quiet space in the local holding cells and a profound, bone-deep exhaustion in her own soul.\n\nIn the days that followed, she threw herself back into her work with a ferocity that bordered on punishment. She took on the grim jobs, the ones that involved backed-up sewerage and years of accumulated grime, as if she could scour the memory of the past weeks from her own mind through sheer physical exertion. She scrubbed floors, unblocked drains, and repointed brickwork, the familiar, honest labour a temporary balm. But the city had changed for her. The familiar tapestry of Derry life now seemed to have a rotten thread running through it. A lonely-looking student hunched over a laptop in a cafe was no longer just a student, but a potential Liam. A sullen teenager arguing with their mother was a potential Ciara. The world she had once seen as simply messy, now seemed actively malevolent, full of hidden currents and digital poisons that could pull the unwary under.\n\nMcIlvanney called her a week after the arrests. His voice had regained some of its weary authority, the sharp edge of crisis having dulled into the blunter instrument of due process. \u201cIt\u2019s done, Ragan,\u201d he said, the finality in his voice like the closing of a heavy door. \u201cThey\u2019re all on remand. Conspiracy to cause public nuisance, possession of an offensive weapon\u2026 the book\u2019s been thrown at them. The ringleader, the one you called Anthem, hasn't said a word. Just sits in his cell, smiling. He\u2019s a strange one.\u201d He paused. \u201cThe others have all started talking. Crying for their mothers. They\u2019re just kids, Ragan. Scared, stupid kids who got caught in something they didn\u2019t understand.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey understood enough to build the weapons,\u201d Ragan replied, her voice flat. She was stripping old varnish from a doorframe, the acrid smell of the chemicals a welcome sharpness in the air. \u201cDid you get the leaflet?\u201d \u201cWe did,\u201d McIlvanney confirmed. \u201cIt will be exhibit A. Look, the point is, the local threat is neutralized. Somerset police have Elara Vance under a court order in a facility that\u2019s harder to get out of than Magilligan. The main forums are being shut down. You did it. You cleaned it all up. Now, for the last time, I\u2019m telling you as a friend, not a policeman. Let it go. Delete the files. Throw the laptop in the Foyle. Live your life.\u201d\n\nFor a few days, she tried. She scrubbed the ghost of her business name from the side of the Transit until the paintwork was raw. She worked from dawn until dusk, falling into bed each night in a state of physical collapse that she hoped would be enough to keep the dreams at bay. But the caretaker\u2019s instinct, the deep, ingrained need to check the dark corners and inspect the hidden pipes, was a part of her she could not scrub away. The silence from the digital world was not comforting; it was suspicious. It was the silence of a blocked drain before the pressure builds and the filth erupts somewhere unexpected.\n\nOne night, unable to sleep, she found herself in her small office, the glow of the monitor illuminating her stern, tired face. She navigated the dark warren of the internet, her fingers moving with a grim familiarity. McIlvanney was right; the main hubs were gone, replaced by error messages and takedown notices. But the mercury balls had, as he\u2019d predicted, scattered. She found them in the encrypted comment sections of obscure video-sharing sites, in password-protected image boards, and in newly created, private messaging groups. They were smaller, more paranoid, and infinitely more zealous. In these fragmented echo chambers, the mythology of the Sweeties was being rewritten. Josephine and Anthem were no longer just leaders; they were the First Martyrs. Their defeat was not a failure, but a holy sacrifice.\n\nIn a group named \u2018The Forever Garden\u2019, Ragan found the new scripture taking shape. The language had evolved again. It was no longer about a passive 'Grand Union' or an aggressive 'retribution'. The new philosophy was more insidious. It was about \u2018cultivation\u2019. They believed the world of the Bitters was not to be destroyed, but to be 'saved'. The new posts were filled with a strange, botanical terminology. The lonely and the lost were 'seeds'. The Splurge-Guns were 'watering cans'. Their mission was to 'plant the truth' in the 'barren soil' of the world. And they had a new ceremony, a new sacrament they called \u2018The Grafting\u2019. It was described in chilling, allegorical detail. It was about finding a Bitter, someone who had rejected or spoken against the Sweeties, and 'grafting' a piece of their truth onto them. It was about making the unwilling 'bloom'.\n\nRagan felt a cold dread that was deeper and more personal than anything she had felt before. This was not about suicide or terrorism anymore. This was a philosophy of violation. Of forced conversion. She scrolled through the posts, her eyes scanning for specifics, for a sign of their next move. She found it in a thread discussing the 'First Bitter'. They were talking about her. About the woman who had brought down their Queen. They had pieced together a fractured narrative from news reports of the \u2018incident\u2019 in Bath and the arrests in Derry. They had connected the two events. And at the bottom of the thread, one user had posted a new image. It wasn't a picture of feet. It was a grainy, pixelated screenshot from a Derry news website\u2019s video report on the traffic chaos caused by the arrests on the Craigavon Bridge. The camera had panned across the line of stuck traffic, and for a fleeting second, it had captured an anonymous blue Ford Transit parked on a side street. The driver\u2019s side window was down, and a figure was visible inside, partly obscured, holding a phone to their ear. The resolution was terrible, a smudge of colour and shape. But a new user, one Ragan hadn\u2019t seen before, with the simple handle \u2018Gardener\u2019, had replied to the image with a single, chilling sentence. 'I know that van. I know that face.'The screen\u2019s cold light etched the single sentence onto Ragan\u2019s retinas: *'I know that van. I know that face.'* The name, \u2018Gardener\u2019, was not a clue; it was a signed confession. The world, which had for a week felt dangerously abstract, snapped into terrifyingly sharp focus. The threat was no longer a faceless horde of digital phantoms. It was a man she had spoken to, a man whose weary complaints about black spot on roses she had listened to with feigned sympathy. It was Arthur Finch, the groundskeeper of the Royal Victoria Crescent, and he had just painted a target on her back for an international cult of violent fanatics.\n\nRagan pushed back from the desk, the scrape of her chair legs on the concrete floor a harsh, grating sound in the silence of the garage. She walked to the sink and splashed cold water on her face, the familiar shock of it a grounding sensation. She was not prey. She did not panic. She was a caretaker, and a new, critical fault had been identified in the system. The source of the leak was not Elara Vance, but the lonely, gossiping old man who had tended her gilded cage. He had seen Ragan's face, unfiltered by digital noise. He had heard her Derry accent. He had been given her company\u2019s name. And now, radicalised by the new mythology of Josephine\u2019s martyrdom, he was feeding that information, piece by priceless piece, into the churning, hateful engine of The Forever Garden.\n\nHer first and only call was to McIlvanney. She laid out the new development with the dispassionate clarity of a surgeon describing a tumour. The screenshot. The comment. The name 'Gardener'. \u201cHe saw my face in Bath, Inspector. He\u2019s feeding them everything he knows. The present on my windscreen wasn\u2019t from a local. It was a message to let me know the hunt had begun in earnest.\u201d\n\nMcIlvanney\u2019s response was a torrent of frustrated, terrified commands. \u201cWitness protection, Ragan. Now. We\u2019ll move you. A safe house. You can\u2019t stay there. They have your face. It\u2019s over.\u201d The very idea was anathema to her. A \u2018safe house\u2019 was just another name for a box, a form of sterile, indefinite imprisonment where she would be a passive victim waiting for the world to change. It was a council flat with better locks, and she would rather face a dozen Splurge-Guns than be reduced to that.\n\n\u201cYou want me to run?\u201d she said, the words laced with a cold incredulity. \u201cYou want me to abandon my home, my business, my life, because of some bitter old man with a laptop and a grudge? That isn\u2019t a solution, Inspector. That\u2019s letting them win. That\u2019s letting the mess spread until it fills everything.\u201d \u201cThis isn\u2019t a leaking pipe you can patch, Ragan!\u201d he roared, his voice cracking with a fear that was purely for her. \u201cThis is a man who has pointed a weapon at you, and the bullet is being carried by a thousand willing hands. We will find him, but we need time!\u201d\n\nRagan looked around her garage, at the orderly rows of tools, the neatly coiled hoses, the catalogues of parts she had memorised over thirty years. This was her world. She had built it, she maintained it, and she would be damned if she let it be dismantled by a ghost. \u201cTime is the one thing I don\u2019t have,\u201d she said, and quietly ended the call. She knew this was the last time she and McIlvanney would speak as quasi-allies. The next time they spoke, she would be a suspect.\n\nThe first step was to confirm the identity of the ghost. Ragan still had the leaflet from the Bath property management company, a relic from her fabricated insurance claim. The next morning, she put on her \u2018official business\u2019 voice, a clipped, no-nonsense tone that brooked no argument, and dialled their number. \u201cGood morning,\u201d she began, \u201cthis is a follow-up call regarding the water damage incident at Royal Victoria Crescent, flat six. Insurance claim reference [she reeled off a string of numbers]. My report requires the full name of the on-site staff member who first reported the issue. I have him down here as Mr. Finch, the groundskeeper.\u201d There was a rustle of papers on the other end, the click of a keyboard. \u201cYes, that\u2019s correct,\u201d a bored voice eventually replied. \u201cArthur Finch. He\u2019s been with us for years.\u201d\n\nArthur Finch. The name was a key, and it opened a series of small, mundane doors on the internet. He was not a ghost. He was a man in his late sixties, a widower living in a small, council-owned bungalow on the less-fashionable, southern edge of Bath. A search of local news archives brought up a handful of articles: a prize for \u2018Best Kept Allotment\u2019 three years running; a photograph of him at a charity bowling tournament, his face a mask of intense concentration. He was a man of small routines and smaller victories, a man so deeply embedded in the quiet fabric of his life that he was practically invisible. And that, Ragan knew, was what made him so dangerous. He was the lonely, overlooked man who had finally found a place where he mattered, a place where his small scraps of information made him a hero, a prophet of the \u2018Sweetest Truth\u2019.\n\nThe decision was not made; it simply presented itself as the only logical course of action. You do not wait for the pest controller when you have a rat in the wall. You deal with the rat yourself. She could not wait for one of Anthem\u2019s faithful to cross the Irish Sea with a backpack full of epoxy. She had to cut off the flow of information at its source. She had to go and have a word with Mr. Finch.\n\nThat night, for the third time in as many weeks, the anonymous blue Transit slipped out of Derry under the cover of darkness. This journey felt different from the others. The first had been a mission of discovery. The second, a mission of prevention. This was a mission of confrontation. The tools in the back of the van were the same, but her intent had been honed to a fine, sharp point. She was no longer just a caretaker cleaning up a mess. The mess had become personal. It had followed her home, it had threatened her world, and now she was going to follow it back to its origin and excise it, permanently. As the ferry pulled out into the black, silent expanse of the sea, Ragan did not look back at the receding lights of home. She looked forward, towards the dark horizon of England, her face set like stone, a sergeant going to war, a caretaker going to fix the final, most dangerous leak of all.The second journey south was a descent into a familiar hell, but this time Ragan knew the landscape. The motorways were grey, featureless ribbons spooling her towards the city of honey-coloured stone, a place she now associated not with Georgian elegance, but with a deep and cancerous rot. The beauty of Bath, when she finally rolled into its outskirts, was obscene. The perfect crescents and manicured parks seemed to mock her with their serene, oblivious grandeur. She felt a visceral disgust for its placid surface, knowing the sickness that festered just beneath. This was not a mission of discovery; it was pest control.\n\nArthur Finch\u2019s bungalow was on a small, neat council estate of post-war builds, a world away from the aristocratic sweep of the Royal Victoria Crescent. The houses were identical, functional, and imbued with a quiet, palpable loneliness. From her new parking spot, two streets away, she watched the rhythm of his life through her binoculars. It was a life of small, precise routines. At nine-thirty, he walked to a nearby allotment, a small, stooped figure in a worn flat cap. He returned at midday for lunch, his posture slightly prouder, carrying a bunch of leeks or a handful of new potatoes. The afternoons were spent indoors, the curtains slightly ajar, the flicker of a television the only sign of life within. He was a ghost in his own life, a man whose existence had been worn down by time and solitude into a predictable, circular path. This, Ragan understood with a chilling clarity, was the perfect petri dish for a cult like The Forever Garden. They hadn't offered him an escape from his life; they had offered him a purpose within it.\n\nHer plan was an echo of her previous success, a variation on a theme she had perfected over a lifetime. Deception was a tool, and Ragan was a master craftswoman. In the back of the Transit, she assembled her disguise. A high-visibility vest, stained with just the right amount of authentic grime. A laminated ID badge, created on her small portable printer, complete with a blurry photo of herself and the imposing crest of the local council. She was no longer Ragan of Responsive Caretaking. She was \u2018Brenda Watts\u2019, a Senior Damp & Structural Surveyor for the Bath & North East Somerset Housing Division. She carried a heavy-duty clipboard and a large metal case that held not surveying equipment, but a selection of carefully chosen tools for a different kind of structural adjustment.\n\nShe knocked on his door just after two o\u2019clock, the time when post-lunch lethargy would be at its peak. He opened it, and he was smaller and greyer than she remembered, his face a roadmap of mild, perpetual disappointment. His eyes flickered over her, taking in the uniform, the badge, the clipboard. He saw the costume, not the woman wearing it. Recognition did not dawn. He saw only an official inconvenience, another small trial sent to test his patience. \u201cMr. Finch?\u201d she asked, her voice adopting a flat, bureaucratic English accent she\u2019d practiced on the journey down. \u201cBrenda Watts, council housing. We\u2019re conducting mandatory damp surveys on all properties in this block. Won\u2019t take long.\u201d With a weary, put-upon sigh, he stepped back and let her in, holding the door open just wide enough for her to pass. The trap was set, and the target had walked into it of his own accord.\n\nThe inside of the bungalow was obsessively tidy, a shrine to a life that no longer existed. The air smelled of lavender polish and loneliness. On the mantelpiece, a row of silver-framed photographs showed a smiling, dark-haired woman, aging progressively through the decades, her image a constant, silent presence in the room. This was the house of a man who had lost his world and was now meticulously preserving the museum of what remained. But in the corner, by the window overlooking the neat, sterile back garden, was the portal to his new world. A modern computer desk, a powerful desktop PC, its monitor glowing with the sickly light of The Forever Garden forum. And on the desk, next to the keyboard, sat a small, clay pot. In it, nestled on a bed of cotton wool, was a single, perfect rosebud, coated in a shimmering, pearlescent shell of pink epoxy. A tribute. A devotional object. Ragan felt a cold, hard knot form in her stomach.\n\nShe went through the motions, her performance flawless. She tapped walls with the handle of a screwdriver. She made notes on her clipboard. She tutted about condensation and poor ventilation. Arthur Finch hovered nearby, wringing his hands, a bundle of nervous energy. \u201cEverything in order, I hope?\u201d he asked, his voice thin. \u201cI\u2019m very particular about the upkeep.\u201d Ragan\u2019s gaze drifted to the computer. \u201cIt\u2019s funny,\u201d she said, her voice still in character, \u201chow things can take hold in a house. You get a little bit of damp in a dark corner, you ignore it, and before you know it, the rot is in the very structure of the place.\u201d She walked slowly towards the desk, her eyes fixed on the screen. He hadn\u2019t even bothered to close the forum. He was logged in as \u2018Gardener\u2019. The screenshot of her van was still visible in the thread. \u201cIt takes a lot of care, a garden, doesn\u2019t it, Mr. Finch?\u201d she said, her voice losing its English flatness, the hard, unmistakable cadence of Derry creeping back in. \u201cYou have to be vigilant. You have to pull the weeds out by the root. Before they poison everything.\u201d\n\nHe froze. The shift in her accent was the key turning in the lock. His head snapped up, and for the first time, he looked, *truly looked*, at her face. The colour drained from his cheeks, his mouth opening in a silent gasp of horrified recognition. The official from the council dissolved, and in her place stood the woman from the Crescent, the Bitter, the First Heretic. The ghost he had been hunting was standing in his living room. \u201cYou,\u201d he whispered, the word a tiny, terrified puff of air. \"Brenda Watts has left the building, Arthur,\u201d Ragan said, her voice a low, dangerous rumble. She nodded towards the screen. \u201cI believe you and I have some things to discuss. About your online horticultural activities.\u201d\n\nPanic flared in his eyes, raw and animalistic. He made a move, a clumsy lunge towards the phone on a small side table. Ragan was faster. She didn't touch him. She simply moved to block his path, her presence suddenly filling the small room, a solid, immovable object of consequence. \u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d she said, the single word carrying the weight of an iron bar. \u201cThere is no one you can call who can help you now. The police? You think DI McIlvanney in Derry would be interested in your story? Or do you want to tell your new friends that you invited their arch-enemy into your house for a cup of tea?\u201d His entire body seemed to collapse in on itself. The fight went out of him, replaced by a trembling, abject terror. He sank into an armchair, his face grey, his breath coming in ragged, shallow gasps. He was just a lonely old man who had chosen the wrong god.\n\nRagan walked to the desk. She looked at the glowing screen, at the hateful, adoring words, at the plans to \u2018graft\u2019 her and others like her. Then she opened her metal case. She didn\u2019t pull out a weapon. She pulled out a tool. A large, powerful degaussing magnet, designed to completely erase the data from magnetic tape storage, but brutally effective on older mechanical hard drives. \u201cYou have caused a great deal of trouble, Arthur,\u201d she said, her voice calm and steady, like a doctor explaining a terminal diagnosis. \u201cYou have pointed a great many broken people in my direction. You have made my life\u2026 complicated. And I am a woman who prefers a simple, tidy life.\u201d With a slow, deliberate movement, she passed the magnet over the computer tower, a single, silent wipe that scrambled every byte of data, every hateful word, every saved image of Josephine\u2019s feet, into meaningless digital noise. She then unplugged the monitor, methodically wrapping the cord around it. She did the same to the keyboard, the mouse, the speakers. She was dismantling his shrine, piece by methodical piece. \u201cThis garden of yours,\u201d she said, coiling the final cable, \u201cis now closed. Permanently.\u201d\n\nShe turned to face him one last time. He was weeping silently, tears tracking paths through the weathered skin of his cheeks. He wasn\u2019t crying for his safety; he was crying for his lost purpose, for the silence that would now rush in to fill the void. \u201cYou will forget my name,\u201d Ragan said, her voice dropping to a near whisper, a tone far more terrifying than any shout. \u201cYou will forget my face. You will delete your accounts, or what\u2019s left of them. If I ever see the name \u2018Gardener\u2019 again, if I ever read one more post about \u2018The Grafting\u2019, if so much as a single pink-coated insect appears on my property, I will not come back for your computer. Do you understand me, Arthur?\u201d He could only nod, a series of tiny, jerky movements, a puppet with its strings cut. Ragan picked up her case and her clipboard and walked to the door. She didn't look back. She left him there, a man marooned in the wreckage of his own quiet life, the silence of the bungalow his new, permanent companion. As she walked down the path, she felt no triumph, only the grim, hollow satisfaction of a job finally, properly, done. The last leak had been sealed. The house was, for now, quiet.The long drive north was a journey through a vacuum. Ragan drove with a mechanical, relentless focus, the monotonous rhythm of the motorway a hypnotic metronome marking the slow passage of miles. The adrenaline had long since burned away, leaving behind not the satisfaction of a job well done, but a strange, hollow ache in the centre of her chest. What she had done in Arthur Finch\u2019s bungalow was not a repair; it was a demolition. She had not patched a leak; she had taken a sledgehammer to a man\u2019s psyche, leaving him adrift in the silent ruins of his life. She had crossed a line, moving from a protector of the vulnerable to a terroriser of the pathetic, and the knowledge settled in her like a cold, heavy stone. There was no procedure for this, no form to fill out, no insurance policy to cover the moral damage. She was a woman who fixed things, and she had just broken a man, perhaps irreparably. The thought offered no triumph, only the grim, metallic taste of necessity.\n\nBack in Derry, the familiar rain felt like a benediction, a grey baptism washing the dust of England from her van. She drove straight to her garage, the small brick building a fortress of comforting, comprehensible order. The first thing she did was unpack her tools, cleaning each one with a meticulous, almost reverent care. She wiped the phantom fingerprints of Finch\u2019s tidy, lonely house from her metal case. She purged her high-visibility vest of its lingering scent of lavender polish. It was a ritual of purification, an attempt to scrub away the stain of what she had become in that quiet, desperate bungalow. She did not call McIlvanney. There was nothing to report, nothing that could be spoken of in the language of law and order. She had gone outside the book, torn out the relevant pages, and set them on fire. She was on her own, a rogue state of one, and the silence from the police was both a blessing and a confirmation of her complete and utter isolation.\n\nWeeks bled into a month. Ragan forced herself back into the comforting harness of her old life. She fixed dripping taps in student flats, re-mortared crumbling garden walls, and cleared the gutters of elderly widows who paid her in tea and biscuits. She worked with a grim, punishing intensity, seeking exhaustion as a shield against thought. The world tried to convince her it was normal again. The news was full of politics and football, the everyday dramas of a city at peace with itself. And in the dark, silent hours of the night, when the physical tiredness was not enough, she would go online. She stalked the dead forums and defunct message boards like a ghost haunting a graveyard. They were silent. The Forever Garden had withered. The Sweetest Truth had become a lie. The digital world seemed to have forgotten Josephine and her disciples. The silence was absolute. And it was the most terrifying thing she had ever known.\n\nThe call came on a Tuesday, of course. It was a grim job. A landlord needed a flat cleared in a rundown block overlooking the Foyle. The tenant, a young woman, had simply vanished, leaving behind three months of rent arrears and all her worldly possessions. The moment Ragan opened the door, she was hit by a wall of stale air, the familiar scent of neglect and cheap incense. The flat was a chaotic mess of discarded clothes, art supplies, and esoteric books. Ragan began her work, bagging clothes for charity, boxing books, her movements methodical. It was in the bedroom, on a small corkboard pinned with sketches and postcards, that she found it. It was not a Splurge-Gun or a pot of pink goo. It was a single, pressed flower, a white rose, its petals turning a delicate, papery brown. And stuck through its centre with a pearl-headed pin was the tiny, black, desiccated body of an ant. Beneath it, written in a delicate, spidery script, were two words: \u2018He bloomed.\u2019\n\nRagan stared at the macabre little icon, her blood turning to ice. The language was unmistakable. This was not a remnant of the old cult. This was a sign of the new one, the one that whispered of \u2018grafting\u2019 and \u2018cultivation\u2019. The tenant hadn\u2019t just vanished. She had graduated. She was a gardener now. She was out in the world, looking for barren soil in which to plant her seeds. Ragan took a step back, her gaze sweeping the room, seeing it now with new, horrified eyes. She had been so focused on the leaders, on the source, that she had failed to see the most fundamental truth of her trade: a leak doesn\u2019t need a plumber to spread. It just needs a crack. And the world was full of cracks. Elara Vance was locked away, Anthem and his pathetic cell were on remand, and Arthur Finch was a broken man staring at a blank wall. But the idea, the sweet, poisonous scripture of Josephine, was still out there. It had gone feral. It was mutating, adapting, surviving in small, hidden pockets of loneliness, tended by a new generation of believers who had learned from the mistakes of their martyrs.\n\nThat night, Ragan did not go to bed. She sat in her office, the single desklamp carving a small island of light out of the deep darkness of the garage. She had been a fool to think it was over, to believe that a problem this deeply rooted could be solved by cutting off a few visible branches. You didn't just fix a mess like this. You managed it. You monitored it. You became its custodian. She opened her laptop, the hum of its fan the only sound. Her old dummy profiles were useless, burned by her previous investigations. She began to create a new identity, a new ghost to send into the machine. This one was not a curious bystander or a potential convert. This one was a mourner. A lost \u2018Sweetie\u2019 looking for a new garden. Her fingers moved over the keyboard, crafting a plausible backstory, choosing a profile picture of a grey, rain-slicked street, a picture of anonymous, universal despair. She was no longer just a caretaker of buildings. That job was too small for the scale of the decay she now saw everywhere. She was a warden of the dark places, a sentinel posted on the crumbling border wall between the real world and the one that festered just behind the screen. The title she had earned, the one that had started as a joke and had become a burden, now settled upon her like a heavy but perfectly fitted coat. Sergeant Ragan was on duty. The watch was hers, and she knew, with a certainty that chilled her to the bone, that it would be for the rest of her life.The creation of \u2018Ash_ling\u2019 was a meticulous, grim piece of artifice. Ragan, who had never posted a personal photograph online in her life, now found herself curating a gallery of profound and believable despair. Her profile picture was a close-up of raindrops on a spider\u2019s web, each droplet a perfect, tiny world of distortion. Her feed became a portfolio of melancholia: a lone, skeletal leaf skittering across wet pavement; the blurred lights of traffic seen through a rain-streaked window; an empty swing moving slightly in the wind. They were the kind of pictures a lonely teenager might take, imbued with a significance that only they could understand. Her text posts were equally crafted, poetic fragments of grief and longing. She wrote of the \u2018Silence\u2019 where Josephine\u2019s voice used to be, of the \u2018coldness\u2019 of a world without her light, and of a desperate hope for a new \u2018bloom\u2019. She was planting a garden of digital sorrow, baiting the trap with the most potent lure she knew: shared loneliness.\n\nShe cast her lines into the dark water, revisiting the digital graveyards of the old cult. In the comment sections of deleted videos, under archived forum posts, she left her mournful little messages. *\u2018The garden is untended. The roses have withered. Is anyone else still waiting for the sun?\u2019* It was a message in a bottle, a coded lament for the initiated. For weeks, the only response was the vast, echoing silence of the dead internet. She felt a growing, gnawing anxiety that she had been wrong, that the cult had truly died, leaving her to be a lonely sentinel guarding an empty fortress. She continued her day job, the physical reality of blocked drains and peeling paint a stark contrast to the ethereal hunt she conducted at night. The Transit, now a blank, anonymous blue, felt less like camouflage and more like the skin of a ghost.\n\nThe first reply came not as a public comment, but as a flicker in the corner of her screen. A private message request from a user with a blank profile named \u2018Rhizome\u2019. The message was a single, cryptic question: *\u2018What colour were the thorns?\u2019* Ragan\u2019s mind raced. It was a test. A security question from a paranoid, fragmented cell. Thorns. Roses. Josephine. The pink goo. The answer had to be simple, obvious to a true believer but opaque to an outsider. She thought of the grotesque spatter in Liam\u2019s flat, the macabre sprinkles on a devil\u2019s dessert. The ants. The tiny, doomed pilgrims. She typed her reply, her fingers steady. *\u2018Black. The thorns were black and beautiful, and they marched to feel her love.\u2019*\n\nShe waited, her breath held tight in her chest. An hour passed. Then, a new message from \u2018Rhizome\u2019. It was a string of meaningless characters, a data-scramble that she recognised as an invitation link to an encrypted messaging server. The link was set to expire in sixty seconds. With a hurried click, she was pulled from the familiar architecture of the open internet into a dark, claustrophobic digital space. It was a single chat room, the background a stark, funereal black, the text appearing in a faint, phosphorescent green. There were only a dozen other users online. This was not a forum for thousands. This was a sealed bunker.\n\nThe vetting process was immediate and brutal. A user named \u2018Perennial\u2019 took the role of inquisitor, their questions sharp and mistrustful. *\u2018Why are you here, Ash_ling? The sun is gone. The garden is salted.\u2019* Ragan, channelling the ghosts of Liam and Ciara, let her grief flow into the keyboard. *\u2018I still have my seeds,\u2019* she wrote. *\u2018I was preparing my own watering can when the Silence came. I want to find a place to plant them.\u2019* They interrogated her for hours, testing her knowledge of the lost scripture. They asked about specific videos, the names of certain shades of pink paint Josephine had favoured, the music-box melodies she used. Ragan, with her perfect, grim archive of the cult\u2019s entire history, answered every question flawlessly. She became one of them, her sorrow and anger a perfect, fabricated reflection of their own. She told them the \u2018First Bitter\u2019 had taken the sun from them, that this heretic must be a creature of profound ugliness and hate. She typed the words, describing herself as a monster, and felt a piece of her own soul turn to cold, hard stone.\n\nFinally, after a night of relentless psychological pressure, she was accepted. She was now part of the cell. And in the days that followed, she was granted access to their inner sanctum, to the private channels where the new doctrine was taught. The full, horrifying reality of \u2018The Grafting\u2019 was laid bare. It was a systematic process of psychological warfare. The chosen target, a \u2018Bitter\u2019, would be stalked, their routines learned, their weaknesses identified. The initial phase was \u2018tilling the soil\u2019\u2014a campaign of subtle gaslighting and terror. Small objects moved in their home. A single black ant left on a pillow. A whispered word on a bad phone line. The goal was to destabilize, to create cracks in the victim\u2019s perception of reality.\n\nThe final stage, the Grafting itself, was a ritual of abduction and conversion. The plan was to isolate the victim and subject them to a relentless barrage of Josephine\u2019s ideology: her videos played on a loop, her whispers piped in through headphones, the air filled with the sweet, sickening scent of the pink mixture. The ceremony would culminate in the victim being physically bound and \u2018grafted\u2019 with an object of symbolic power\u2014a pink-coated rose, a shard of a broken mirror\u2014using the new, permanent epoxy. They would be marked, branded, their \u2018bitterness\u2019 forcibly plastered over with a symbol of the Sweeties\u2019 \u2018love\u2019. The goal was not to kill the body, but to annihilate the self, to force the victim to \u2018bloom\u2019 into one of them. It was a violation more intimate and terrifying than anything Ragan could have imagined.\n\nShe had to find their next target. She searched the chat logs, looking for any mention of a new project. She found it in a conversation between \u2018Perennial\u2019 and \u2018Rhizome\u2019. They were discussing their next Grafting, their most ambitious yet. They weren\u2019t targeting a local politician or a minor blogger. They were targeting the source of all their current pain. They had been trying for weeks to identify the judge who had signed the warrants for Anthem\u2019s arrest, the judge who had denied their prophet bail. And they had succeeded. They had a name: Judge Alistair Carmichael. And they had a location. He was scheduled to give the keynote address at a legal conference in two weeks\u2019 time. Not in Derry, not in London, but in the neutral, unassuming city of Glasgow. The cell was mobile. And their plan was already in motion. The hunt was on again, and Ragan, the sole guardian of this terrible knowledge, knew she had to get there first.",

                                        "text": "The mist was a shroud over the Foyle, thick and biblical. It clung to the steel sinews of the Peace Bridge and ghosted through the cobbled alleys of the Craft Village, a damp, grey breath that tasted of river water and old stone. Sergeant Ragan, a title she\u2019d earned not through any constabulary but by a lifetime of sorting things out, felt the dampness in her bones. It was a Tuesday. Tuesdays were for the grim jobs. The ones where the council tenancy agreement had outlasted the tenant.\n\nHer van, a Ford Transit with 'Ragan's Responsive Caretaking' stencilled on the side in a sensible blue, rattled over the Craigavon Bridge. She was fifty-four, with a face that had been carved by Derry winds and a no-nonsense set to her jaw. Her hair, once a fiery red, was now a disciplined salt-and-pepper bun. She was a caretaker. She cleaned up what was left behind. Spills, stains, lives.\n\nToday it was a flat in the Bogside. A young fella, the dispatcher had said. A \u2018welfare concern\u2019 that had graduated, as they so often did, to a coroner\u2019s concern. The police had already been, done their cursory sweep, and left the grim aftermath for her. Just another job. But the moment she opened the door, a smell hit her that was not the familiar, tragic odour of lonely death. It was sweet. Cloyingly, sickeningly sweet, like a patisserie on the verge of putrescence. It was the smell of rot trying to disguise itself as confection.\n\nThe flat was a single room, a bedsit of squalor and despair. A mattress on the floor, stained takeaway cartons, a universe of dust motes dancing in the single beam of light from the grime-caked window. And in the centre of it all, the source. The young man, Liam, the neighbours had called him, was slumped in a computer chair, his head at an unnatural angle against the desk. The police had said overdose, a needle still pathetically limp in his hand. But Ragan\u2019s eyes, trained to see the details others missed\u2014the subtle watermark of a leak, the first bloom of black mould\u2014saw something else.\n\nAll around the base of the chair, on the floor, and spattered up the legs of the desk, was a thick, viscous, pink substance. It was hardening into a brittle shell, shimmering with a strange, pearlescent quality. It was the source of the smell. Scattered within the goo, like macabre sprinkles on a devil\u2019s dessert, were the tiny, black bodies of ants. Hundreds of them. A trail of them led from a crack in the skirting board, a tiny doomed pilgrimage that ended in a sticky, pink apocalypse.\n\nRagan pulled on a pair of latex gloves from her pocket, her movements precise and economical. She knelt, her knees cracking in protest. She touched the substance. It was brittle, sugary. She scraped a little with a fingernail. It flaked away like cheap paint. Her gaze drifted from the floor to the desk. Beside the young man\u2019s pale, cold hand was a device that looked like a child\u2019s water pistol, a garish thing of orange and green plastic. Its reservoir, however, was filled with the same shimmering pink liquid. A makeshift label, written in black marker, was peeling off its side. \u2018Splurge-Gun v.2\u2019.\n\nThis was not an overdose. Not just an overdose. Something was terribly, performatively wrong.\n\nHer eyes went to the laptop screen, still glowing with a phantom life. It was a Facebook page. The profile picture wasn't a face, but a pair of feet. Two pale, slender feet, immaculately clean, resting on a plush, crimson velvet cushion. The toenails were painted a delicate shell-pink, the very same shade as the goo hardening on the floor around her. The profile name was simple, almost innocent: Josephine.\n\nRagan used a pen to nudge the trackpad, scrolling down the feed. It was a gallery of feet. Feet on a beach, the sand like powdered sugar around the perfect toes. Feet in a bubble bath, peeking out from the foam. Feet tangled in white silk sheets. The posts were interspersed with short, jerky videos. Ragan clicked on one.\n\nThe view was from above, looking down at a line of ants marching across a pristine white countertop. The same perfect, pink-toed feet were visible at the bottom of the frame, wiggling slightly. A sweet, tinkling music-box melody began to play. Then the orange-and-green nozzle of the Splurge-Gun entered the shot. A voice, soft and breathy, a strange mix of girlishness and something else, something cloying and possessive, whispered.\n\n\"My darlings. My little sweeties. You're all marching to see me. You love me so much, don't you? I love you too. I love you so, so much. I want us to be together. Forever.\"\n\nThe gun fired. Not with a bang, but a wet, sickening *splat*. A thick jet of pink goo erupted from the nozzle, coating the ants in a single, messy burst. They struggled for a moment, their tiny legs churning in the viscous tide, and then were still. The camera zoomed in on the sticky carnage, the music box melody swelling.\n\n\"Now we're one,\" the voice cooed. \"My love is all over you. My sweet, sweet love.\"\n\nThe video ended. Below it were thousands of comments.\n*'So beautiful, Josephine! Your love is so pure!'*\n*'I wish I could feel your love like that! \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f'*\n*'The way you care for them is an inspiration. You're an angel.'*\n\nRagan felt a coldness that had nothing to do with the damp Derry air. She scrolled further, her breath catching in her throat. The dead boy, Liam, had commented just yesterday.\n*'Josephine, I made my own gun. I want to show you my love. I want to be one with them, just like you.'*\n\nHis comment had one reply, from Josephine herself. A string of heart emojis and a single, chilling sentence.\n*'Show me, my sweet. Show everyone how much you love.'*\n\nRagan stood up, backing away from the desk, from the sweet smell and the dead boy and the glowing screen. The police had seen a junkie. She saw a disciple. A victim of a madness so bizarre, so grotesquely twee, it defied all logic. She looked at the trail of ants from the skirting board. They were just ants. Insignificant. But in this room, they were the runes of a new and terrible scripture.\n\nShe pulled out her phone, her fingers fumbling with the cold screen. She dialled the number for the station, for Detective Inspector McIlvanney, a man whose patience she had tested many times with her insistence on details he considered beneath him.\n\n\"Christ, Ragan, what is it now?\" his voice was a tired rasp. \"Did a pigeon look at you funny? I've got three stabbings and a ram-raid to deal with.\"\n\n\"It's the Bogside flat, the overdose,\" she said, her voice low and urgent. \"It's not what you think. You need to come back. There's something here. Something you missed.\"\n\n\"We found the needle, Ragan. The coroner will do the rest. Just get it cleaned up. That\u2019s your job, isn\u2019t it?\"\n\n\"There's a gun,\" she insisted. \"A toy gun. And... and feet. On the internet.\" She heard herself saying it and knew how it sounded. Insane.\n\nThere was a long-suffering sigh from the other end of the line. \"Have you been on the sherry, Sergeant? It's not even lunchtime. Clean the damn flat. Send the bill to the council. Out.\" The line went dead.\n\nRagan stood alone in the silence, the sweet smell crawling down her throat. She was a caretaker. She cleaned up messes. But this wasn't a mess of squalor or neglect. This was the beginning of something. A stain that was spreading. She looked from the dead boy to the glowing screen, the perfect, pink-toed feet offering a silent, obscene benediction over the scene. She didn't know who Josephine was, or where she was. But she knew, with a certainty that settled deep in her marrow, that she had to be stopped. And in that moment, Sergeant Ragan\u2019s job description changed. She wasn't just cleaning up the aftermath anymore. She was going to have to clean up the source.\n\nShe spent the next two hours in a grim, methodical ritual. She bagged the makeshift gun and the boy\u2019s laptop as evidence, knowing the police would likely laugh and lose them. She documented everything with her phone's camera, taking pictures of the spatter patterns, the dead ants, the brand of cheap energy drink beside the monitor. Every detail was a potential weapon. When the physical cleaning began, she worked with a cold fury, scrubbing the viscous pink substance from the floorboards. As she worked, the music-box melody from the video played on a loop in her head, a maddeningly cheerful accompaniment to the carnage.\n\nThat night, sleep offered no escape. She dreamt of marching ants, millions of them, their tiny legs clicking on pavement, forming swirling patterns that resolved into a pair of pale, perfect feet. She dreamt of the sweet, cloying smell, and a soft voice whispering, \"I love you, I love you, I love you,\" as a tide of pink goo rose around her. She woke up sweating, the phantom scent of it in her nostrils.\n\nThe next day, she started her own investigation, the only way she knew how. With meticulous, dogged persistence. She sat in her small office at the back of her garage, the smell of disinfectant and engine oil a comforting antidote to the sweetness in her memory. The laptop she\u2019d taken from the flat sat on her desk, a Trojan horse filled with digital horrors. She created a dummy Facebook profile, a grey silhouette named 'John Smith', and descended into Josephine\u2019s world.\n\nIt was a rabbit hole lined with velvet and decorated with pictures of feet. Josephine had over a hundred thousand followers. Her feed was a relentless stream of positivity and barely concealed malice. Posts about 'finding beauty in the small things' were illustrated with close-ups of her pedicure. Exhortations to 'share your love with the world' were punctuated by videos of insect annihilation. The community that had sprung up around her was a cult of the lonely and the lost. They called themselves 'Josephine's Sweeties'. They praised her 'gentleness', her 'empathy'. They shared pictures of their own feet, seeking her approval. And, terrifyingly, they were beginning to share pictures of their own Splurge-Guns.\n\nThey were everywhere. A teenager in Ohio, posing with a modified Super Soaker filled with what looked like strawberry jam. A middle-aged man in suburban Tokyo, his face blurred, holding a delicate, airbrushed device that was a clear imitation of Josephine\u2019s. A woman in Italy, her post written in flowery, dramatic prose, describing the 'ecstasy of shared love' as she aimed a glitter-covered glue gun at a spider. They were building the weapons. They were following the gospel. The gospel of Josephine.\n\nRagan felt like she was watching a plague incubate in real time. She searched for news reports, for anything that might connect to this bizarre subculture. At first, nothing. Just the usual static of global tragedy. Then she refined her search terms, using the slang she was picking up from the forums. 'Sweetie ceremony'. 'Love sharing'. 'Forever nap'.\n\nAnd then she found it. A small news item from a local paper in Phoenix, Arizona. A man found dead in his apartment. An apparent suicide. The report mentioned 'a strange pink substance' found at the scene. A week later, another report, this one from a blog in Germany. A woman who had 'fallen' from her balcony. The blogger, a neighbour, mentioned the woman's recent obsession with her feet and a strange, sweet smell that had lingered in the hallway for days.\n\nIt wasn't just Liam in Derry. It was happening already. Sporadic, disconnected events, dismissed by local authorities as suicides, accidents, the sad, lonely ends of sad, lonely people. No one was connecting the dots. No one was seeing the pink, sticky thread that tied them all together. No one but her. A caretaker from Londonderry, staring at a screen in her garage, the weight of a silent, creeping, global horror settling on her shoulders. The death count wasn't rising yet. It was seeding. Germinating in dark rooms and lonely apartments all over the world, nurtured by a girl who posted pictures of her feet and whispered sweet nothings to the dying. Ragan scrolled through the faces of the 'Sweeties', their hopeful, lost eyes staring out from their profile pictures, and a cold, hard resolve solidified within her. She would care for them. She would clean this up. She had to."

                                        "text": "Her first move was to pivot from the macabre gallery of followers to the source itself. She began to deconstruct Josephine\u2019s online persona, piece by meticulous piece. She saved every photograph, every video, archiving them into folders on her desktop with grim, functional titles: \u2018Feet_Beach\u2019, \u2018Feet_Bath\u2019, \u2018Ant_Ceremony_14\u2019. She treated it like she was inventorying the contents of a derelict property, creating a sterile catalogue of a deeply unwell fantasy. The profile was a fortress of anonymity, a carefully curated fiction. There were no accidental reflections in sunglasses, no geotags left on photos, no friends tagged in pictures, because there were no pictures with other people. Josephine\u2019s world contained only two things: her own fetishised extremities and her adoring, faceless flock.\n\nThe substance, the pink goo, was the key. It was the communion wafer of this new religion. Ragan, reasoning that the 'Sweeties' would need instructions, delved into the message boards and private groups linked from the main page. It didn't take long. In a forum titled \u2018Sharing Our Sweetness\u2019, buried under dozens of fawning posts, she found a thread: \u2018Getting the Consistency Right?\u2019. Here, in chillingly domestic terms, the followers exchanged recipes. It was a bizarre confection of corn syrup, industrial-grade food colouring, gelatin, and, disturbingly, a specific brand of quick-set craft adhesive. The combination created the exact properties Ragan had witnessed: a cloying sweetness, a viscous flow that rapidly hardened into a brittle, pearlescent shell. The ingredients were all readily available, purchasable online or in any large supermarket. This plague was not only spiritual, it was DIY.\n\nShe printed the recipes, the pages warm from the laser printer, and laid them out on her desk like battle plans. The sheer banality of the components made the whole affair more grotesque. This wasn't some exotic poison; it was a perversion of the pantry, a weaponization of the craft aisle. She cross-referenced the adhesive brand with the items she\u2019d photographed in Liam's flat. There it was, an empty tube of \u2018Crafter\u2019s Bond\u2019 half-hidden in the mess of takeaway cartons. The connection clicked into place with the solid, satisfying finality of a mortise lock. Liam hadn't just followed Josephine; he had studied her, replicated her methods with the desperate precision of a true believer.\n\nFor days, Ragan\u2019s life fell into a new rhythm. By day, she attended to her duties, fixing leaking taps in student lets and clearing gutters in the Waterside, the mundane reality of her job a strange counterpoint to the madness she explored by night. Her van became a mobile command centre, parked in quiet streets where she could snatch moments on Liam\u2019s laptop, tethering it to her phone's data. She ate sandwiches over the keyboard, the faint, lingering sweetness from the Bogside flat still a ghost in her senses. The world of Josephine\u2019s Sweeties was her new, grim territory. She learned their language, the cloying euphemisms for death and self-destruction. She learned the hierarchy, the followers who received a rare 'like' from Josephine and were elevated to the status of minor saints.\n\nIt was in one of the videos, \u2018Ant_Ceremony_21\u2019, that she found the first crack in the pristine facade. Josephine\u2019s videos were usually shot in a sterile, white environment that could be anywhere. But in this one, for a fraction of a second, as the Splurge-Gun panned across the countertop, a reflection was caught in the polished chrome of a coffee machine in the background. It was a distorted, fish-eye view of the room, but it was something. Ragan played the clip over and over, pausing and enlarging the image until it was a pixelated mess. Through the digital noise, she could just make out the distinctive shape of a window. A large, arched window, with a specific pattern of leading between the panes. It was a piece of the real world, a clue Josephine had carelessly let slip. She took a screenshot, cleaned it up as best she could with the basic software on her computer, and printed it. A single, arched window. It wasn't much, but it was more than she'd had before. It was a shape. It was a start."

                                        "text": "The image of the window was her new obsession. It was ecclesiastical, she thought, or at least inspired by that kind of architecture. The gentle curve at the top, the lead latticework forming simple diamonds. It spoke of old money or old faith. A converted chapel, a Victorian university library, a wing of a grand, decaying hotel. She ran the grainy screenshot through every reverse image search engine she could find, a process that felt like shouting a single, garbled word into a hurricane. The results were a meaningless torrent of gothic cathedrals, pub windows, and stock photos of romantic doorways. The internet, for all its vaunted omniscience, was a fool. It saw shapes, not significance.\n\nShe changed her approach, thinking like a caretaker. Where do you find windows like that? She spent hours scrolling through the online archives of architectural magazines, real estate listings for \u2018unique properties\u2019 in English-speaking countries, and the digital prospectuses of hundreds of universities. The task was monumental, a search for one specific pane of glass on a planet full of them. Every arched window she saw sent a jolt through her, followed by the dull thud of disappointment. The curve was too steep, the leading too ornate, the setting all wrong. The world was full of arched windows, each one a silent mockery of her efforts. After three nights of this, with gritty eyes and a spine aching from her cheap office chair, she admitted a temporary defeat. The window was a clue for later. For now, it was a dead end.\n\nShe needed a different lever. If she couldn\u2019t find the puppeteer, she would have to focus on the puppets. She returned to the gallery of Josephine\u2019s Sweeties, her digital flock. She had to believe that Liam wasn\u2019t the only one in Ireland, that this digital infection hadn\u2019t respected the borders of the Irish Sea. Methodically, she began to sift, abandoning the global view for a local one. She used the platform's search function, looking for followers who listed their location as anywhere on the island. Belfast, Dublin, Cork, Galway. The names scrolled by, a grim census of the lonely. And then, a hit that made the hairs on her arms stand up. A profile located in Derry. Her city.\n\nThe profile belonged to a girl named Ciara, her face a pale, heart-shaped thing surrounded by a dyed-black fringe. She looked no older than seventeen. Her feed, once filled with the typical teenage ephemera of song lyrics and selfies with friends, had changed drastically over the past two months. The friends had vanished. The music had been replaced by links to Josephine's page. Then came the first picture of her own feet, propped on a pillow, the toenails painted a hesitant, streaky pink. The caption read: *\u2018Trying to be beautiful too. @Josephine.\u2019*\n\nRagan scrolled, a sense of dread coiling in her stomach. The posts grew more frequent, more desperate. Pictures of insects. A spider in a jam jar. A line of woodlice on a windowsill. Ciara\u2019s comments on Josephine\u2019s page were pleading. *\u2018You are so full of love. I wish I could feel it.\u2019* Two weeks ago, Ciara had posted a picture of a garish, bright yellow water pistol. Last week, a small tub of pink food colouring. Yesterday, just hours after Ragan had been scrubbing Liam\u2019s floor, Ciara had posted a new photograph. It was her own feet again, but this time the pink on her toenails was perfect, immaculate. The exact shell-pink. They rested on a dark green rug. At the edge of the frame, just visible, was the yellow nozzle of the water pistol. The caption was a single, chilling sentence. *\u2018I think I\u2019m ready to share my love, Josephine. I\u2019m ready to be with the sweeties.\u2019*\n\nThis was it. Not a theory. Not a bizarre story about feet and the internet. This was a child in her own city, standing on the same precipice Liam had just thrown himself from. Ragan printed everything. Ciara\u2019s profile, her increasingly alarming posts, the picture of the water pistol, the final, terrifying photo. She stapled them together with a decisive thwack. She had the needle, and she had the damage done. Now she had a chance to stop the next injection.\n\nShe dialled McIlvanney\u2019s number again, her heart hammering a hard, steady rhythm against her ribs. He answered on the third ring, his voice already saturated with exhaustion. \u201cRagan, I swear to God, if this is about a bin dispute\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about the Bogside overdose,\u201d she cut in, her tone leaving no room for argument. \u201cI have proof he wasn\u2019t the only one. There\u2019s another one, DI McIlvanney. A girl. Here. In the city. And she\u2019s about to do the same thing.\u201d\n\nThere was a pause. She could hear the muffled sounds of the station, a phone ringing in the distance. \u201cWhat are you talking about, \u2018another one\u2019?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m talking about a suicide cult that meets on Facebook,\u201d Ragan said, the words tasting like acid. \u201cThey\u2019re called \u2018Josephine\u2019s Sweeties\u2019. They\u2019re killing themselves with a mixture of corn syrup and craft glue they shoot from toy guns. Liam was one of them. I\u2019ve found another. A teenage girl named Ciara. She\u2019s posting pictures of her own gun. She\u2019s saying she\u2019s \u2018ready\u2019. You have to do something.\u201d\n\nThe silence on the other end stretched. She imagined him rubbing the bridge of his nose, picturing the mountain of paperwork on his desk. \u201cRagan, this is\u2026 a welfare check based on a Facebook post? Do you know how many of those we\u2019d have to do a day? It\u2019s probably just teenage drama.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid Liam\u2019s death look like drama to you?\u201d she shot back, her voice low and fierce. \u201cThe pink goo all over the floor? The ants? The Splurge-Gun? I have his laptop. I have the video that told him to do it. And I have the profile of a seventeen-year-old girl in this city who is following the exact same script. Her name is Ciara Healy. She lives in the Rosemount area. Are you going to wait until I\u2019m the one called to clean out her flat, too?\u201d\n\nThe mention of a specific name and area seemed to land with more weight than all her theories. It made it real. It made it a liability. Another long, weary sigh travelled down the line. It was the sound of a man being cornered by a problem he desperately didn\u2019t want.\n\n\u201cAlright, Ragan. Alright,\u201d McIlvanney conceded, his voice heavy with reluctance. \u201cI\u2019ll send a car around. A welfare check. But if she\u2019s just painting her bloody toenails, you and I are going to have a very serious conversation about wasting police time. And for Christ\u2019s sake, stop calling yourself Sergeant.\u201d He hung up.\n\nRagan didn\u2019t care. She let out a breath she hadn\u2019t realised she was holding, her knuckles white where she gripped her phone. It was a partial victory, a grudging acknowledgement. She had, for a moment, made him see the stain. Now she could only wait, and pray the car would be fast enough, and that when they opened Ciara Healy\u2019s door, the air wouldn\u2019t already smell sickeningly sweet. She looked at the laptop screen, at Josephine\u2019s page, which had just updated with a new post. It was a picture of a single, perfect foot, half-buried in pristine white sand. The caption read: *\u2018Thinking of all my sweeties, waiting to come home to me. Be brave. Your love makes the world beautiful.\u2019*"

                                        "text": "Waiting was a state Ragan was constitutionally unsuited for. It was a form of idleness, and idleness was a rot that she had spent her life scrubbing from corners and scouring from surfaces. She stood in her own kitchen, the kettle boiling for a cup of tea she didn\u2019t want, the silence of her small house amplifying the manic, looping soundtrack in her head: the music-box melody, the wet *splat* of the Splurge-Gun, the soft, cooing voice. She couldn\u2019t stay here. She couldn\u2019t just wait for a phone call that might deliver news of another failure, another room that would need her services.\n\nThe keys to the Transit were in her hand before she\u2019d made a conscious decision to move. The van grumbled to life in the damp evening air, its headlights cutting twin paths through the descending gloom. Rosemount was a steep climb of red-brick terraces and semi-detached houses, a world away from the tight-knit, historic warren of the Bogside. It was a place of neatly kept gardens and cars parked carefully on the pavement. A place of apparent normality that Ragan knew was the most fragile facade of all.\n\nShe found the address easily, a two-storey house halfway up a quiet street. A single PSNI patrol car was parked at the kerb, its presence as loud and incongruous as a scream in a library. Its blue lights were off, but a faint, rhythmic pulse of light from within the house\u2014an ambulance\u2014stroked the windows of the neighbouring properties, where curtains were already twitching. She hadn't been too late. The relief was a physical thing, a loosening in her chest, but it was followed immediately by a cold wave of dread for what they had found.\n\nRagan parked her van across the street and walked over, her work boots making a heavy, purposeful sound on the tarmac. A young, fresh-faced constable stood by the open front door, looking pale and overwhelmed. He held up a hand as she approached. \"Sorry, miss, police incident. You'll have to stay back.\"\n\n\"I'm Ragan,\" she said, not breaking her stride. \"The DI sent me. I'm the one who called it in.\" The name, delivered with her customary lack of ceremony, seemed to carry a strange weight. The constable's eyes flickered with a flicker of recognition, or perhaps just confusion. He was clearly out of his depth.\n\n\"You're\u2026 the caretaker?\" he asked, his voice cracking slightly.\n\n\"Something like that,\" Ragan said, moving past him into the hallway. \"Where is she?\"\n\nThe house smelled of air freshener and simmering anxiety. A man and a woman, presumably the parents, were huddled in the living room with another officer, their faces blank with a shock that hadn't yet curdled into comprehension. The constable pointed up the stairs. \"Paramedics are with her. In her room. It's... it's a mess, miss.\"\n\nRagan took the stairs two at a time. The door to the front bedroom was open. The scene within was a twisted diorama of teenage life and ritual preparation. It was a girl's room, walls covered with posters of bands Ragan didn't recognise. But in the centre, on a dark green rug, the ritual had been interrupted. A mixing bowl, smeared with the same viscous, bubblegum-pink goo, sat beside an overturned carton of corn syrup and a half-squeezed tube of \u2018Crafter\u2019s Bond\u2019. The yellow water pistol lay on the floor, its reservoir full. And on the bed, sitting upright and wrapped in a foil blanket by a paramedic, was the girl. Ciara. She was weeping, but her tears were not of relief. They were tears of pure, unadulterated rage.\n\n\"You've ruined it!\" she shrieked, her voice thin and high. \"You ruined everything! I was going to be with them! She was waiting for me!\" Her small fists were clenched, beating a frantic, useless rhythm against her own legs. She wasn't looking at the paramedics trying to soothe her; she was staring at the police officer in the doorway, and then at Ragan, with an expression of profound, bottomless hatred. \"You don't understand! It's love! You've spoiled the love!\"\n\nRagan stood back, letting the professionals work, but her eyes took in every detail. Ciara\u2019s laptop was open on her desk, the screen glowing with Josephine\u2019s profile page. Her toenails, just as in the photo, were painted a perfect, shell-pink. A small, dead beetle, its legs curled in, lay on the windowsill, a single, tiny drop of the pink goo hardening on its iridescent shell. A practice run. A rehearsal for the main performance. The young constable from the front door was right. It was a mess. But it was a mess with a clear and terrifying blueprint.\n\nHer phone buzzed in her pocket. It was McIlvanney. She stepped out onto the landing, the girl\u2019s furious sobs echoing behind her. \"Ragan,\" he said. There was no preamble, no weary complaint. His voice was tight, stripped of all its usual cynicism. \"The lads at the scene just called me. A bowl of pink\u2026 gunk. A water pistol. The girl screaming about 'sharing her love'. What in the name of God is this?\"\n\n\"It's exactly what I told you it was,\" Ragan said, her voice low. \"A cult. Liam in the Bogside was a successful initiation. Ciara Healy was a failed one. They're getting instructions from a Facebook profile run by someone calling herself Josephine. They think covering themselves and a few insects in this stuff is a beautiful act of love that unites them forever. They call it becoming 'one with the sweeties'.\"\n\nShe heard him exhale, a long, sharp hiss of air. It was the sound of a man staring into an abyss he hadn't known existed five minutes before. \"Christ. Okay. Okay. The girl, Ciara, they're taking her to Altnagelvin for psychiatric assessment. The parents are in pieces, they had no idea. They thought she was just being a moody teenager.\" He paused. \"You have the boy's laptop?\"\n\n\"I do,\" Ragan confirmed.\n\n\"Don't let it out of your sight. Bring it to the station. First thing in the morning. We're opening a file on this\u2026 Josephine. And Ragan,\" he added, his voice dropping, losing its official tone for a moment and becoming something closer to a plea. \"Tell me everything you know.\"\n\nAfter the ambulance had gone, taking the still-raging Ciara with it, and the family had been left in the hollowed-out shell of their evening, Ragan was left alone in the room with the two officers, who were now bagging up the evidence with a newfound solemnity. They treated her differently now, with a kind of cautious respect. She was no longer the cleaner who had made a lucky guess; she was the one who had seen the pattern in the madness. She stood by the desk, looking at Ciara\u2019s laptop. Josephine\u2019s page was still there. No new posts. No acknowledgement of the drama unfolding in a small house in Derry. The profile was a silent, smiling monolith, its influence radiating out across the globe, utterly indifferent to the chaos it caused.\n\nShe pulled the printed screenshot of the arched window from her pocket. It looked flimsy, ridiculous, a piece of pixelated nonsense. But looking from the distraught family downstairs to the evidence of the ritual in this room, she knew it wasn't nonsense. It was a fragment of the real world intruding on the fantasy. It was the only solid thing she had that belonged to Josephine herself. Somewhere, behind a window just like that one, a woman was sitting at a computer, posting pictures of her feet, and whispering promises of a sweet, sticky eternity to the lost and the lonely. The police could open their files and start their official procedures, but Ragan knew they were playing catch-up. This wasn't a crime that could be solved with search warrants and uniformed patrols. It was a sickness. And the only way to cure it was to find the source of the infection."

                                        "text": "The next morning, the air had a sharp, clean edge to it, the mist having been scoured from the sky by an insistent wind. Ragan drove the Transit to the Strand Road police station, Liam\u2019s laptop sitting on the passenger seat like a malevolent passenger. She felt a grim sense of vindication, a feeling as tasteless and unwelcome as the sweet smell from the Bogside flat. She had been right, but being right meant a teenage girl had been seconds away from coating herself in a sugary tomb, and a young man was already in the morgue. It was a victory that felt entirely like a loss.\n\nThe reception she received was markedly different from her usual encounters with the constabulary. The desk sergeant, a man who had on previous occasions treated her with the weary condescension reserved for persistent complainers, now looked at her with an expression of guarded curiosity. He picked up his phone. \u201cDI McIlvanney? Your\u2026 appointment is here. Ragan.\u201d The word \u2018appointment\u2019 hung in the air, a small, significant alteration to their established order. She wasn't just the cleaner anymore. She was a source.\n\nMcIlvanney met her by the stairwell, his face looking even more haggard in the harsh fluorescent lighting of the station. He\u2019d swapped the exhaustion of yesterday for a new, wired intensity. He gestured for her to follow him, leading her not to a sterile interview room, but into the noisy, cluttered heart of the C.I.D. office. Heads turned as she walked through, carrying the laptop. She recognised the blend of suspicion and intrigue; she was an outsider, an anomaly in their rigidly structured world. \u201cIn here,\u201d McIlvanney said, ushering her into a small glass-walled office. A young man in a rumpled shirt and tie, who looked barely old enough to have a mortgage, was already seated at a table, a sleek police-issue laptop open in front of him. \u201cThis is Detective Constable Byrne. He\u2019s our cybercrime liaison. Byrne, this is Mrs Ragan. She\u2019s the one who put us onto this whole bloody mess.\u201d\n\nByrne stood and offered a polite, limp handshake. \u201cMa\u2019am. The DI\u2019s been giving me the overview. It\u2019s\u2026 unorthodox.\u201d He had the bland, passionless expression of someone who spent his life translating human misery into data packets. Ragan simply placed Liam\u2019s laptop on the table between them. \u201cThe password is his cat\u2019s name, \u2018Tiddles\u2019, followed by the year he was born, 1998. It was written on a post-it note on the monitor,\u201d she said, the mundane detail a stark contrast to the horrors the machine contained. While Byrne plugged in a series of drives and began his methodical violation of Liam\u2019s digital life, Ragan laid out her own evidence for McIlvanney: the stapled printouts of Ciara\u2019s profile, the recipes for the pink goo, the list of news articles from Phoenix and Germany.\n\nMcIlvanney stared at the pages, his jaw tight. He picked up the recipe. \u201cCorn syrup and craft glue. Jesus, Mary and Joseph. It\u2019s like a primary school art project from hell.\u201d He looked from the papers to Ragan. \u201cYou assembled all this in two days? From a single overdose call-out?\u201d The question was laced with a reluctant awe that was more valuable to Ragan than any official commendation. \u201cIt\u2019s my job to see the details, Inspector,\u201d she replied flatly. \u201cI just look for a different kind of mess.\u201d Her gaze shifted to Byrne, who was clicking rapidly through files, his face impassive. \u201cWe\u2019ve got his browser history,\u201d the young DC announced. \u201cHours and hours on the Josephine page, a few linked forums. He downloaded all her videos. He ordered the food colouring and adhesive from Amazon two weeks ago. It\u2019s all here. It corroborates your narrative perfectly, ma\u2019am.\u201d\n\nRagan felt a surge of impatience. Corroborating her narrative wasn\u2019t the point. Stopping the next Liam, the next Ciara, was the point. \u201cWhat about her? Josephine?\u201d she asked, her voice sharp. \u201cCan you find her?\u201d Byrne didn\u2019t look up from his screen. \u201cWe\u2019ll submit an emergency disclosure request to Facebook for the account\u2019s data. IP address, linked email, creation date. But these people are rarely stupid. She\u2019s likely using a VPN, bouncing her signal all over the planet. The email will probably be a dead-end burner account. It\u2019s a process. It takes time.\u201d Ragan pulled the folded, grainy image of the arched window from her pocket and slid it across the table. \u201cWhat about this? It\u2019s a reflection from a coffee machine in one of her videos. It\u2019s a real place. It has to be.\u201d\n\nByrne glanced at it for a fraction of a second before dismissing it with a shake of his head. \u201cA window? Ma\u2019am, with respect, there are millions of arched windows in the world. The resolution is too low to get any meaningful data. It\u2019s not actionable intelligence.\u201d He turned back to his screen, his attention already elsewhere. But McIlvanney picked up the printout, his thumb tracing the blurry curve of the frame. He looked at Ragan, and for the first time, she saw that he understood. He saw the gulf between the slow, methodical grind of police procedure and the speed at which this digital plague was spreading. They could gather data and file reports, but Josephine would still be out there, whispering her sweet poisons into the ether. \"We'll do what we can, Ragan,\" he said, his voice heavy. \"Officially. But you... you keep seeing the details. You have a knack for it. Keep me informed. Directly.\"\n\nLeaving the station, Ragan felt a profound sense of anticlimax. The wheels of justice were turning, but they were grinding with the slowness of millstones. She had handed over her discovery, and in return had been given platitudes about process. She drove back to her garage, the familiar smell of oil and solvent a grounding force. This was her place. The station was their world, of procedure and protocol. This was hers, a world of practical solutions and hands-on work. She knew in her bones that by the time Byrne\u2019s emergency disclosure request came back from some server farm in California, another \u2018Sweetie\u2019 somewhere would be mixing a bowl of pink goo.\n\nShe sat at her own desk, the silence of the garage a welcome respite. She had given them the laptop, but she had her own copies of everything. The archived videos, the screenshots, the reams of forum posts. She couldn\u2019t shake Byrne\u2019s casual dismissal of the window. It felt like he\u2019d discarded the one piece of the puzzle that was actually real. Frustrated, she decided to re-watch the video, the one with the coffee machine reflection. \u2018Ant_Ceremony_21\u2019. She put on a pair of old, foam-padded headphones to block out the world and hit play. The sickeningly sweet music-box melody filled her ears. The soft, breathy voice. \u201cMy darlings. My little sweeties.\u201d She closed her eyes, trying to force herself to see something, anything, new. But it was no use. The reflection was too distorted.\n\nThen, an idea struck her. She wasn't a cybercrime expert, but she was a caretaker. She knew that to find the source of a problem, you had to use all of your senses. She had been so focused on what she could see, she hadn\u2019t truly been listening. She played the clip again. And again. This time, she forced her mind to push past the foreground, to ignore the twee music and Josephine\u2019s cloying whispers. She was listening for the background. For the ambient noise of the room, the sounds that bleed in from the outside world. Most of the videos were sterile, silent save for the performance. But this one, \u2018Ant_Ceremony_21\u2019, was different. Behind the whisper, beneath the melody, there was something else. A faint, rhythmic sound.\n\nShe used the basic audio editing software on her computer, a tool she normally used to check for humming refrigerators on tenant complaint calls. She isolated the few seconds of audio, filtering out the high frequencies of the music and the low rumble of the voice. She amplified what was left. At first, it was just a digital hiss. Then, as she tweaked the levels, it emerged from the static, faint but unmistakable. It was a chime. A sequence of bells, playing a distinct, slightly melancholic tune. It wasn't the single toll of a common church clock. It was a proper carillon, a set of bells playing a short, specific melody. Four notes, a brief pause, then three more. A hesitant, memorable pattern. It was a sound that would repeat, on the hour or the quarter-hour. A sound that was as specific to a location as a street sign. Byrne could have his IP addresses and his server logs. Ragan had a window and a song. The hunt wasn't just digital anymore. It had a soundtrack."

Ragan, a woman more attuned to the percussive clang of a faulty radiator than the nuances of a musical scale, knew she was out of her depth. But a problem was a problem, whether it was damp rot or a digital death cult, and the first step was always to identify the source. She sat in her garage office, the world outside reduced to the soft drumming of rain on the corrugated roof, and played the four-second audio clip on a loop. *Da-da-da-dum\u2026 da-da-dum.* It was a simple, mournful little phrase, a pattern of notes that snagged in the memory.\n\nShe tried humming it into her phone, feeling a flush of foolishness as she held the cold glass to her lips. The music identification app, usually so adept at naming pop songs from a noisy pub, churned and processed before delivering a verdict of \u2018No Result Found\u2019. It was too short, too faint, too muddled with the digital hiss she couldn't quite scrub away. Defeated on the technological front, she fell back on the analogue. She downloaded a simple piano keyboard app and, with a thick, calloused finger more used to gripping a wrench, she began to tap out the notes, hunting for them one by one. The process was slow, painstaking. The first note, then the second, trying to match the interval she heard in her head. It took nearly an hour of clumsy plinking and replaying the clip until she had something that sounded close. A seven-note sequence. A key to a lock she couldn't see.\n\nWith the sequence of notes crudely transcribed, she returned to the internet, her search terms now more specific. \u2018Folk melody G-E-D-C G-A-C\u2019. \u2018Clock tower chime identification\u2019. She waded through forums for campanologists\u2014bell-ringers\u2014and music theory websites, places of arcane knowledge where she felt like a trespasser. Then, on a site dedicated to cataloguing traditional folk tunes, she found it. The melody was part of a Welsh air called \u2018Llwyn Onn\u2019, or, in English, \u2018The Ash Grove\u2019. It was a song of love and loss, its lyrics speaking of a lover\u2019s grief by a grove of trees that had witnessed their happiness. The irony was so bitter it almost tasted metallic. Josephine, the architect of a cult of sticky, sweet self-annihilation, had set her rituals to the soundtrack of a traditional lament.\n\nThe name of the song was a crowbar, a tool she could use to pry open the world. Her search immediately became more focused: \u2018Carillons that play The Ash Grove\u2019. The initial results were a dispiritingly long list. Cathedrals, university clock towers, and municipal buildings across the globe. A university in Toronto, Canada. A town hall in a suburb of Melbourne, Australia. A private memorial in Princeton, New Jersey. A church in Cardiff. The list spanned continents, a testament to the long reach of the British Empire and its cultural exports. Josephine could be anywhere.\n\nRagan began a grim, systematic process of elimination, a virtual world tour from the discomfort of her office chair. For each location on the list, she opened a new browser tab and began her hunt. She used Google Maps and its Street View function, becoming a spectral tourist, her disembodied view gliding down digital streets. She looked for the window. Her precious, grainy, arched window. The university in Toronto was a fortress of brutalist concrete, all sharp angles and unforgiving grey slabs. No arches. Melbourne\u2019s town hall was a grand Victorian affair, but its windows were all ornate rectangles. No. Princeton had the gothic arches, hundreds of them, but none matched the simple, clean diamond pattern of the leading in her screenshot. The search was a new kind of exhaustion, a long, scrolling journey to nowhere. For two solid nights, she drank bitter instant coffee and \u2018walked\u2019 the streets of cities she would never visit, her eyes aching from the screen\u2019s glow. Every promising curve in a building would resolve into the wrong shape, the wrong pattern, the wrong place. The world was full of arched windows, and all of them were taunting her.\n\nShe was about to give up for the night, her back a knot of pain, when she got to a less likely candidate on her list. The city of Bath, in England. The primary hit was the famous Abbey, but she\u2019d already dismissed it; its windows were vast, complex things of stained glass. But further down the search results was a smaller, more obscure reference: a private hospital, built in the Victorian era as a sanatorium for the wealthy, had been converted in the late 1990s into luxury apartments. An article in a local history blog mentioned its unique clock tower, a later addition, whose carillon was programmed to play a rotation of gentle folk melodies, including \u2018The Ash Grove\u2019, to avoid disturbing the residents with traditional, booming chimes. The name of the building was \u2018The Royal Victoria Crescent\u2019.\n\nWith a feeling of weary obligation, Ragan typed the name into the search bar. The satellite view showed a magnificent, sweeping curve of honey-coloured stone, perched on a hill overlooking the city. It was a monument to Georgian elegance and old money. It felt right. She dropped the little yellow Street View peg man onto the road in front of the crescent. The digital camera resolved, and she was there, on a quiet, tree-lined street. She began to pan the view across the facade of the building. Four storeys of symmetrical sash windows, gleaming white porticos, and black iron railings. It was beautiful, imposing, and completely uniform. Her heart sank. It was another dead end. She was about to click away when she noticed a section of the building set slightly back from the main crescent, an annex or a later addition. The architecture was subtly different, the windows larger.\n\nHer mouse clicks became frantic. She moved her viewpoint down the street, trying to get a clearer angle. And then she stopped. Her breath caught in her throat. There it was. On the third floor of the annex, set above a small stone balcony, was a single, large, arched window. The curve was identical. She zoomed in, the image pixelating, the quality degrading, but the pattern was undeniable. The simple, clean, diamond-shaped leading. It was the window. She had found it. It was real.\n\nRagan leaned back in her chair, the springs groaning in protest. She didn\u2019t feel a sense of triumph. There was no elation. Instead, a cold, heavy certainty settled in her gut, the feeling a caretaker gets when they finally trace a network of damp patches and hairline cracks back to the one rotten, burst pipe that is silently, steadily destroying the building\u2019s foundations. She was looking at it. The source. Josephine lived there. In a luxury apartment in a historic crescent in Bath, a place of serene, moneyed beauty. Ragan looked from the glowing screen to her own hands, stained with a faint trace of engine grease. The distance between her world and Josephine\u2019s seemed immense, insurmountable. The police, with their procedures and their requests for disclosure, would take weeks, months, to get to this point, if they ever did. And by then, how many more Liams would there be? How many more bowls of pink goo mixed in teenage bedrooms? She looked at the image of the window, a dark, blank eye in a wall of pale stone. She had found the nest. Now she had to figure out how to get to the spider."

For Ragan, it was no different from planning the deep clean of a derelict commercial property: you identified the objective, you assembled your tools, and you accounted for the variables. The objective was the apartment in the Royal Victoria Crescent. The variables were many. Her tools, however, were familiar. She spent an hour in the garage, methodically packing the back of the Transit. Alongside the usual accoutrements of her trade\u2014buckets, heavy-duty cleaning agents, a box of latex gloves, a formidable-looking floor scraper\u2014she placed a small holdall with a few changes of clothes, a thermos, and a thick ordnance survey map of southwest England. She packed the printouts of her research into a waterproof document wallet and copied all the files from Liam\u2019s laptop onto a cheap USB stick, which she then threaded onto her van\u2019s keychain. It was a meagre arsenal for the battle she intended to fight.\n\nBefore leaving, she made two calls. The first was to a reliable subcontractor, a man named Eamonn who handled her overflow jobs. She told him she had a family emergency in England and that he was in charge for a few days, a lie that tasted unfamiliar and unpleasant in her mouth. The second call was to DI McIlvanney. She dialled his mobile directly, knowing he\u2019d be home, the day\u2019s wreckage behind him. He answered with a grunt. \u201cRagan. It\u2019s nine o\u2019clock at night.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve found her,\u201d Ragan said, her voice devoid of triumph. It was a statement of fact. \u201cJosephine. I know where she lives.\u201d She heard a rustle on the other end, the sound of a man sitting up straighter, his attention suddenly snagged. She gave him the address, The Royal Victoria Crescent in Bath, and explained in concise, clipped sentences how she had found it: the bell chime, the Welsh folk song, the architectural blogs, the final, painstaking search on Street View. She left nothing out.\n\n\u201cAre you certain?\u201d McIlvanney\u2019s voice had lost all its weariness, replaced by a sharp, focused edge. \u201cA bell and a window? That\u2019s what you have?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the place,\u201d Ragan said with unshakeable certainty. \u201cI\u2019m on my way there now. I\u2019ll be on the midnight ferry from Belfast to Birkenhead.\u201d The silence that followed was long and heavy. She could almost hear the calculations whirring in his head: the jurisdictional nightmare, the lack of a formal warrant, the sheer, bloody-minded insanity of his civilian informant going on a freelance crusade. \u201cRagan, for the love of God, do not do this,\u201d he finally said, his voice a low, urgent command. \u201cYou are a civilian. You have no authority. You\u2019ll be arrested for harassment before you even find a parking space. Let me handle it. I\u2019ll call the Avon and Somerset police in the morning. We\u2019ll do it by the book.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy the time you get your book open, she\u2019ll have whispered in another ten ears,\u201d Ragan countered, the engine of the Transit already rumbling beneath her. \u201cHow\u2019s Ciara Healy doing, Inspector? Is she thanking you for doing it by the book?\u201d The question was cruel, and she knew it, but it was a necessary cruelty. She needed him to understand the urgency that was thrumming in her own veins. \u201cI\u2019m not going to kick her door in. I\u2019m a caretaker. I\u2019m going to do what I do. I\u2019m going to watch. I\u2019m going to see the details. I\u2019ll be your eyes on the ground until your book gets you there. But I am going.\u201d She didn\u2019t wait for his reply. She ended the call and put the phone in the glove compartment, severing her last tie to the world she was leaving behind. The van pulled out of the garage, its sensible blue lettering a flag of mundane purpose in the dark Derry night.\n\nThe journey was a long, suspended passage through a world of tarmac and sodium lights. The Irish Sea was a black, churning void, the ferry a brightly lit island of tired truckers and families on budget holidays. Ragan sat in the near-empty cafeteria, nursing a stewed tea, the map spread out on the table before her. She was an incongruous figure, a woman of fifty-four with a face carved by the Atlantic winds, planning a solo intelligence mission a hundred miles inside enemy territory. She felt the absurdity of it, a cold knot of fear in her stomach that she pushed down with the sheer force of her will. She had cleaned up after every kind of human tragedy\u2014loneliness, addiction, violence, despair. This was simply a different kind of mess, one that required travel. She repeated this to herself like a mantra as the English coastline appeared, a smear of distant lights in the pre-dawn gloom.\n\nBath, when she finally arrived in the late afternoon, was a shock. It was like driving into a postcard. The city was carved from a single, luminous golden stone, its streets flowing with a Georgian grace that felt utterly alien. Derry was a city of defiant grit, its history a visible scar. Bath was a city of preserved elegance, its history a curated tourist attraction. Her Ford Transit, with its Derry plates and functional, scuffed exterior, felt like a barge navigating a regatta of gleaming yachts. She saw tourists pointing cameras, students with tote bags, well-dressed locals walking tiny, expensive dogs. There was a serene, moneyed quietness to the place that felt more unnerving than any city noise she had ever known. This was Josephine\u2019s world. It was a world built to keep people like Ragan out.\n\nFinding the Royal Victoria Crescent was easy. It dominated the northern slopes of the city, a majestic, sweeping curve of perfect architecture. Parking the Transit was another matter. Every space was reserved for residents, marked with signs that threatened fines and clamping with polite, implacable ruthlessness. Ragan eventually found a spot on a side street a quarter of a mile away, a position that offered a partial, obscured view of the annex she had identified online. She killed the engine, and the ensuing silence was profound. She was here. From the driver\u2019s seat, she raised the pair of cheap but powerful binoculars she kept for inspecting roof tiles and focused on the building. Her heart beat a little faster as she found it. The third floor. The small balcony. The arched window. It was just as it had been on the screen, a dark, unreadable shape in the pale stone facade. There were no lights on inside. It looked empty, dormant. Ragan took a long, slow breath, the air tasting of damp leaves and old money. She was a caretaker, come to fix a problem. She settled back in her seat, pulled the thermos of tea towards her, and began to watch. The grim, patient surveillance had begun."

                                        "text": "The first twenty-four hours were a lesson in stillness. Ragan existed within the cramped confines of her Transit, a ghost in the machine. She moved only to shift her weight in the driver\u2019s seat, to raise the binoculars to her eyes, or to pour another cup of lukewarm tea from the thermos. The quiet, affluent street operated on a rhythm entirely alien to her. Women in expensive athletic wear jogged past with looks of mild disdain for the grubby white van. A fleet of Amazon delivery drivers formed a near-constant parade, depositing parcels on pristine doorsteps. Ragan watched it all, her gaze patient and methodical, her presence a small, stubborn stain of reality on the neighbourhood\u2019s polished veneer. She was an expert at waiting. She had waited for floor sealant to dry, for paint to cure, for the slow, inevitable decay of a building to reveal its deepest flaws. Waiting for a monster to show her face was no different.\n\nIt happened on the second day, in the pale light of a late afternoon. A high-end grocery delivery van, the kind that promised organic, artisan produce at extortionate prices, pulled up outside the main entrance to the annex. Ragan\u2019s hands, already holding the binoculars, tightened their grip. The intercom buzzed, and after a moment, the heavy oak door swung inward. A figure emerged, stepping out into the daylight for just a moment to sign for the delivery boxes. Ragan zoomed in, her breath held tight in her chest. It was a woman, or perhaps a girl, barely out of her teens. She was slight, almost bird-like, with long, mousy-brown hair tied back in a careless ponytail. She wore grey sweatpants and an oversized, plain black jumper, her feet clad in simple slippers. Her face was pale and unremarkable, devoid of makeup, her expression a blank mask of neutrality. There was no hint of the malevolent coquette from the videos, no trace of the cloying, saccharine poison. This was not the grand villain Ragan had built in her mind. This was a girl who looked like she hadn\u2019t felt the sun on her skin in months. She signed the tablet, took the boxes without a word, and disappeared back inside, the heavy door clicking shut, sealing her back into her stone fortress. Ragan lowered the binoculars, a profound sense of cognitive dissonance washing over her. The monster was just a lonely girl in sweatpants. The thought made her skin crawl.\n\nThe days settled into a grim routine. Ragan would watch the silent window, which remained dark and lifeless. She slept in snatches in the reclined passenger seat, the unfamiliar quiet of the street more disruptive than the noises of Derry she was used to. She subsisted on sandwiches and service-station coffee, using the facilities at a nearby supermarket with the grim efficiency of a soldier on campaign. At night, illuminated by the cold blue light of her phone, she would descend back into Josephine\u2019s world. The page was alive, a constant churn of activity. New pictures were posted: a foot dangling over the edge of a bathtub Ragan could only assume was inside the flat she was watching; toes peeking from under a silk duvet. And the comments from the \u2018Sweeties\u2019 grew more fervent, more desperate. They were sharing pictures of their own completed \u2018Splurge-Guns\u2019, holding them up like trophies, their faces alight with a terrifying, misguided devotion. Ragan was watching a global catastrophe unfolding in slow motion, and the epicentre was a single, dark window in a silent, golden building just a few hundred yards away.\n\nPassive observation, she realised, was a luxury she could no longer afford. She was a caretaker, and caretakers dealt with problems at the source, which meant getting closer. On the morning of the third day, she saw her opportunity. A man in khaki overalls was on his knees, tending to a bed of immaculate rose bushes near the entrance to the annex. He moved with the slow, deliberate rhythm of a lifer, someone for whom this was not a passion but a long-held job. Ragan got out of the Transit, shrugging on her own navy work coat. The stencilled words 'Ragan's Responsive Caretaking' gave her a uniform, a role, a reason to be there. She walked over, her boots crunching on the gravel path. \"Morning,\" she said, her Derry accent thick in the genteel air. \"Fighting a losing battle with the black spot on those, are you?\"\n\nThe gardener, a man in his late sixties with a face like a weathered paving slab, looked up, his expression shifting from suspicion to the weary camaraderie of the trade. \"Tell me about it,\" he grumbled, sitting back on his heels. \"Mrs Henderson in number twelve thinks it\u2019s a personal insult. You in the business?\" he asked, nodding towards her van. Ragan launched into a believable fiction about a difficult client in a neighbouring street, a litany of blocked drains and peeling paint that forged an instant, unspoken bond between them. They were the invisible army that kept these beautiful houses running, the people who saw the dirt that the residents paid handsomely to ignore. After a few minutes of shared grievance, Ragan steered the conversation, gesturing with her chin towards the annex. \"That's a handsome bit of stonework. Bet the window frames are a nightmare to maintain.\"\n\n\"That they are,\" the gardener affirmed, glad of the distraction. \"Especially the big arched one up on the third floor. Listed building, you see. Can't just replace it. Have to use specialist contractors. Costs a fortune.\" He lowered his voice conspiratorially. \"Not that the owner minds. Some big-shot lawyer in London. It\u2019s his daughter lives there. Miss Vance. Elara Vance. Proper strange one. Never comes out, far as I can tell. Has everything delivered to the door. Gives the other residents the creeps, but her daddy's money keeps the committee quiet.\" He snipped a dead head off a rose with a vicious snap of his secateurs. \"Far as I'm concerned, as long as the service charge is paid, she can conduct s\u00e9ances with Elvis for all I care.\" Ragan\u2019s heart hammered in her chest, but she kept her face a mask of professional interest. Elara Vance. She had a name. A real name. It felt like a key, cold and heavy in her hand.\n\nBack in the humming silence of the van, the name 'Elara Vance' became the lens through which everything focused. It grounded the phantom. Ragan's fingers flew over her phone\u2019s keyboard, the search now surgically precise. The father, Marcus Vance QC, was easy to find: a titan of corporate law, with a fearsome reputation and a string of articles praising his ruthless courtroom tactics. Then she found Elara. A handful of mentions in society pages from a decade ago, noting her presence at charity galas on her father's arm. Then, a single school photograph from a prestigious boarding school, dated five years prior. A pale, dark-haired girl with a forced smile and haunted, oversized eyes stared out from the screen. She was the ghost at the feast, a child who had everything and nothing. The pieces of the puzzle weren't just fitting together; they were locking into place with grim finality. A girl with a powerful, absent father, isolated in a golden cage with nothing but an internet connection for company, had twisted her loneliness and privilege into a weapon and aimed it at the world.\n\nThat evening, the stakes changed with a terrifying suddenness. A new video appeared on the Josephine page. It was different from the others. The camera was steady, the lighting soft and deliberate. It showed only Josephine's mouth, lips painted a glossy, perfect pink, and the delicate line of her jaw. Her voice was no longer a whisper; it was imbued with a new, hypnotic authority. \"My sweet, sweet darlings,\" she began, the music-box melody playing softly beneath her words. \"You have all shown me such devotion. You have prepared your love. Now, it is time for our Grand Union.\" Her pink lips curved into a gentle smile. \"This Saturday. The summer solstice. The longest day. A day of perfect, beautiful light. We will all feel my love together. We will all become one. Prepare yourselves. It will be the most beautiful day of our lives.\" The video ended. Below it, the comments section exploded into a frenzy of ecstasy and devotion. Pledges from Ohio, from Tokyo, from Italy, from Derry. They were all preparing for Saturday. A coordinated, global, mass suicide event, orchestrated from a luxury flat in Bath. Ragan felt a cold sickness rise in her throat. She looked at the date on her phone. It was Wednesday. The solstice was in three days. The book, as McIlvanney called it, was useless. The law was a blunt instrument, and this was a cancer that needed to be excised with a scalpel. She looked from the ecstatic comments on her screen to the dark, silent, arched window. The time for watching was over."

It transformed the abstract threat into a timed explosive, its fuse sputtering down towards Saturday. Ragan sat in the driver\u2019s seat of the Transit, the glow of the phone illuminating the hard, resolute set of her jaw. There was no more time for observation, for gathering evidence, for waiting on a system that moved at the speed of paperwork. A caretaker does not watch a flood rise; they find the stopcock and they turn it off. With force, if necessary.\n\nHer first action was a final courtesy, or perhaps a warning. She dialled DI McIlvanney\u2019s number one last time. He answered instantly, his voice sharp with anxiety. \u201cRagan, what\u2019s happening? I\u2019ve spoken to Avon and Somerset. They\u2019re treating it as a high-priority online harassment case, but they need more\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cThey need more time,\u201d Ragan finished for him, her voice flat and cold. \u201cAnd they have until Saturday. She\u2019s just announced it. A \u2018Grand Union\u2019. The summer solstice. She\u2019s calling them all home. It\u2019s going to be a bloodbath, Inspector, a global, coordinated event, and it\u2019s going to be directed from that flat.\u201d\n\nA string of muttered curses came down the line. \u201cWe can get a welfare check, maybe a psychiatric hold if we have a doctor sign off, but we can\u2019t just break the door down based on your theory\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cIt stopped being a theory when I was scrubbing Liam\u2019s brains and a mixture of corn syrup off his floor,\u201d she cut back, the image as sharp and brutal as the day she\u2019d seen it. \u201cIt stopped being a theory when Ciara Healy tried to join him. I\u2019m going in, McIlvanney.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you dare, Ragan,\u201d he ordered, his voice rising in panic and fury. \u201cThat is an order. You are a material witness. You are not a police officer. You will compromise the entire investigation. You will be arrested.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen you\u2019d better hope your colleagues in Bath are quick about it,\u201d she said, and for the first time, a sliver of the Derry wind crept into her voice. \u201cBecause I\u2019m a caretaker. And there\u2019s a mess in that building that needs sorting out. Immediately.\u201d She ended the call, the finality of the act a physical release. She was untethered. The responsibility was now hers alone.\n\nShe spent the next hour preparing, not for a confrontation, but for a job. She slipped into the back of the van, the familiar metallic and chemical smells of her trade a comfort. From a long storage tube, she pulled a set of drain rods, their brass fittings gleaming dully in the low light. From a locked metal box, she took a powerful, waterproof endoscope camera on a flexible cable, a tool she used for inspecting collapsed pipes. She selected a tub of thick, black, non-setting waterproof mastic, a substance designed to seal leaks but which could, with judicious application, create them. She was not arming herself with weapons, but with the implements of her profession. She was going to fix this problem the only way she knew how: by breaking it in a way that only she could fix.\n\nUnder the deep cover of a moonless, rainy night, she put her plan into action. Dressed in dark work trousers and a black waterproof jacket, she was just another shadow in a street of sleeping houses. She approached the annex not from the front, but from the rear, slipping down a narrow service alley she had scouted earlier. The building\u2019s elegance was a facade; like all buildings, it had a grubby, functional backside. Here, the drainpipes ran down the exterior of the honey-coloured stone, a network of arteries carrying the rainwater away from the precious structure. Ragan located the primary downpipe that served the annex roof. Using a drain rod as a lever, she prised open the access hatch to the roof gulley, a sound muffled by the persistent drumming of the rain. She worked quickly, her movements economical and certain. With a glob of the thick, black mastic, she systematically blocked the entrance to the downpipe, creating an insidious, invisible dam. Then she waited, watching as the rain, her unwitting accomplice, began to pool in the gulley, a dark mirror reflecting the starless sky. It would take hours, but eventually, the water would find the path of least resistance. And that path, she knew from a lifetime of experience, would be inwards.\n\nShe was back in her van before dawn, a cold, damp chill having settled deep into her bones. She watched the sun rise on a new day, Thursday, and felt the clock ticking with a visceral, physical pressure. Around mid-morning, it happened. A dark, tell-tale patch began to bloom on the pale stone wall of the annex, high up, just below the roofline. The water had found its way in. She gave it another hour, letting the problem fester, letting the water seep into plaster and behind skirting boards, before she made her move. She walked to the front of the building, her phone in her hand, and feigned a call, her voice loud enough to carry to the gardener who was, as ever, tending to his roses. \u201cAye, it\u2019s a shocking bit of water damage,\u201d she said into the phone, her eyes fixed on the stain. \u201cRight up under the eaves. That\u2019ll be into the wall cavity by now. A real mess.\u201d The gardener looked up, followed her gaze, and his face fell. He saw the dark patch, and his expression was one of pure, professional horror.\n\n\u201cWhere in God\u2019s name did that come from?\u201d he exclaimed, dropping his trowel. Ragan ended her fake call. \u201cJust spotted it,\u201d she said, her tone all business. \u201cLooks like a blocked gulley on the roof. The rain last night\u2019s found its way in. You need to get that looked at sharpish, or the whole wall will be ruined.\u201d She gestured back towards her van. \u201cI\u2019ve got the gear for it, if your usual fellas are busy.\u201d The gardener looked from the rapidly darkening stain to her van, a lifeline appearing just as the ship was sinking. He knew how much a specialist call-out would cost, and how long it would take. Ragan could see the calculations turning over in his head. \u201cThe management company will have my hide,\u201d he muttered. \u201cAlright. Can you get up there? See what the damage is?\u201d\n\nAn hour later, after a series of frantic phone calls between the gardener, a flustered property manager in Bristol, and a tacit approval from Marcus Vance\u2019s personal assistant in London, Ragan was standing inside the silent, plushly carpeted lobby of the annex. She had been hired. She carried a toolbox in one hand and the coiled endoscope in the other. \u201cThe leak seems to be affecting the top two flats,\u201d the gardener had told her. \u201cNumber six, that\u2019s the Vances\u2019. And number five below it. You\u2019ll need to check them both for internal damage.\u201d It was a perfect, unimpeachable pretext. She took the lift to the third floor, the ride smooth and silent. The lift doors opened onto a small, private landing, serving only one apartment. Number Six. The air was still and smelled faintly of lavender and dust. She stood before a plain, dark wood door with a simple, elegant silver \u20186\u2019 on it. She took a breath, raised her hand, and knocked. The sound was unnervingly loud in the quiet building. She waited, her heart a steady, heavy drum in her chest. For a long moment, there was only silence. Then, she heard the delicate click of multiple locks being undone. The door opened a few inches, held by a security chain. A single, pale blue eye, magnified by the narrow gap, peered out at her. It was the eye of Elara Vance. \u201cYes?\u201d the voice was small, thin, and laced with an undisguised annoyance. \u201cI\u2019m from Responsive Caretaking,\u201d Ragan said, her voice calm and level, holding up a work order a-flutter with fabricated details. \u201cI\u2019m here about the leak. I need to check your interior walls for water damage.\u201d"

                                        "text": "The single eye in the sliver of doorway was cold, devoid of curiosity, and held the deep, flat stillness of a predator that has never known fear. For a moment, Ragan felt the sheer force of the girl's cloistered world pushing back at her, a silent pressure telling her to leave. But Ragan\u2019s own gravity was stronger, forged in a lifetime of dealing with obstinate reality. She held the work order steady, a flimsy paper shield imbued with all the authority of the mundane world.\n\n\"The property manager authorised it,\" Ragan added, her voice a solid, immovable object. \"The water could be getting into the floorboards. It'll cause rot. Structural damage. It\u2019s a bigger job if you leave it.\" She was speaking the language of consequence, a tongue Elara's father would undoubtedly understand, and therefore one that held power even here. The eye blinked. A flicker of calculation. A bigger job meant more people, more disruption. The security chain rattled and slid back. The door swung open.\n\nRagan stepped inside, and the smell hit her with the force of a physical blow. It was the same sickeningly sweet scent from the Bogside, but stripped of the tragic undertones of decay. Here, it was pure, clean, and horribly potent, the smell of a laboratory dedicated to the creation of a single, toxic perfume. The apartment was not a home. It was a stage set. The walls and floor were a sterile, seamless white. The furniture was minimal, chosen for form rather than comfort: a single metal chair, a low white table, and in the corner, a plush crimson velvet cushion resting on a polished steel stool, exactly as it appeared in the photographs. It was a sterile, lifeless space, meticulously designed to be the perfect, anonymous backdrop for Josephine\u2019s performance.\n\nElara Vance closed the door behind Ragan, the sound of the locks clicking back into place echoing in the minimalist space. In person, she was an absence, a void where a personality should be. Her eyes, which held such hypnotic power online, were dull and empty. She watched Ragan with a detached impatience, her arms crossed tight against her chest as if warding off a chill. \"The wall is over there,\" she said, her voice a monotone, gesturing vaguely towards the far side of the room.\n\nRagan nodded, her own performance beginning. She set down her toolbox with a solid clunk and uncoiled the endoscope camera, its black cable snaking onto the pristine white floor. \"I'll need to check the whole wall. See how far it's spread,\" she said, her gaze sweeping the room, her mind a rapid-fire inventory. There it was. On a long white desk against the far wall. The command centre. A high-end laptop, a professional-grade camera on a tripod aimed at an empty chair, studio lighting, and beside it all, like a grotesque trophy, sat the 'Splurge-Gun v.2'. It was identical to Liam\u2019s, a garish thing of orange and green plastic, its reservoir gleaming with the familiar, pearlescent pink liquid.\n\n\"I need to get behind the desk, miss,\" Ragan said, her tone matter-of-fact. \"The damp often follows the electrical conduits. Have to be thorough.\" Elara\u2019s expression tightened, a flicker of annoyance crossing her blank features. This was an intrusion into the inner sanctum. For a moment, she looked as if she might refuse, but the logic of the situation, the unassailable authority of a practical problem, held sway. With a sigh of profound irritation, she moved to the desk and slid the chair out of the way, her movements grudging and stiff.\n\nAs Ragan knelt, pretending to inspect the skirting board with a small moisture meter, she glanced up at the laptop screen. It was open to a private messaging forum. The screen was a rolling cascade of adoration and anticipation. *\u2018I\u2019m so ready, Josephine. I can\u2019t wait for Saturday.\u2019 \u2018My gun is full of love for you!\u2019 \u2018We will be so beautiful together!\u2019* Below the messages, a countdown clock ticked relentlessly downwards. Two days, fourteen hours, thirty-one minutes. Ragan felt a surge of cold fury. These were the voices of the damned, singing praises to their executioner. She looked at Elara, who was watching her with narrowed, suspicious eyes, a queen disturbed at her work. The time was now.\n\n\"Ah, found a bit of a damp patch here,\" Ragan grunted, shifting her weight. \"Just need to get a better look. Tricky angle.\" It was the oldest trick in her book: the feigned stumble, the moment of contrived clumsiness that created an opportunity. She rose, turning as if to get a different tool from her box. In a single, fluid motion that was both awkward and utterly deliberate, her heavy work boot caught the leg of the tripod holding the studio light. It swayed for a dramatic second before crashing sideways, directly into the desk. Elara let out a sharp, involuntary gasp.\n\nThe chaos was a perfect cover. As the light hit the desk, Ragan, in her lunge to \u2018save\u2019 it, sent a heavy-duty wrench skittering from her tool belt. It slid across the smooth white surface and struck the 'Splurge-Gun', knocking it from its perch. It hit the floor with a wet, sickening crack, the brittle plastic of its reservoir shattering. A thick, viscous tide of pink goo spread instantly across the pristine white floor, the smell intensifying to an overwhelming, suffocating sweetness. \"Oh, Christ, I'm so sorry!\" Ragan exclaimed, her voice a pitch-perfect blend of panic and apology. \"Clumsy oaf, my feet are all over the place today.\"\n\nBut Elara wasn't looking at the spreading pink mess. Her eyes were fixed on the laptop. In the chaos, the falling tripod had knocked a half-full glass of water, left on the desk, directly over the machine's keyboard. The screen flickered violently, displayed a frantic scramble of multicoloured pixels, and then went black. A final, pathetic hiss of dying electronics was the only sound. Elara stared at the dead screen, her mouth slightly agape. For a full five seconds, she was frozen, her brain unable to process the catastrophe. Then, a sound emerged from her throat, a sound unlike the cooing whispers or the flat monotones Ragan had heard before. It was a raw, guttural shriek of pure, animalistic rage and loss.\n\n\"NO!\" she screamed, her voice cracking, her entire body trembling. \"No, no, no, what did you DO?\" She scrambled towards the desk, ignoring the pink goo that soaked into the hem of her sweatpants. Her fingers flew frantically over the dead, wet keyboard, slapping at the keys as if she could physically beat the machine back to life. \"My darlings! I can't talk to them! They're waiting for me!\" The mask of Josephine, the serene goddess, and the mask of Elara, the bored recluse, had both been shattered. What was left was a terrified, powerless child, her favourite toy broken beyond repair, her entire world gone dark.\n\nRagan backed away, her face a carefully constructed mask of horrified apology. \"I am so, so sorry, miss. It was a complete accident. I'll pay for the damages, of course. My insurance will cover everything.\" She was already gathering her things, her movements swift and purposeful. She had done the job. She had not only severed the connection; she had destroyed the tools of the trade, all under the perfect, unimpeachable cover of a workplace accident. \"I'll have to file a full incident report. We'll need to get an electrician to check the wiring now, and a technician for the computer.\" Every word was another layer of bureaucratic nightmare designed to keep Elara isolated and offline. Ragan left her there, kneeling in a sticky pink apocalypse of her own making, cradling the dead laptop to her chest and emitting a series of high, wounded keening sounds. The Grand Union had been cancelled. Ragan stepped out into the landing, pulled the door shut, and leaned against the wall, the adrenaline finally washing over her in a great, shuddering wave. She had cleaned up the source. Now she just had to get away before the real mess began."

It was broken only by the muffled, animalistic sobs from within apartment six, the sound of a god whose universe had just winked out of existence. Ragan took a single, ragged breath, the clean, cool air of the landing a shocking antidote to the cloying sweetness that still coated the back of her throat. She flexed her hands, which were trembling slightly, not with fear, but with the subsiding surge of pure, focused adrenaline. The job was done. The immediate threat was neutralized. Now came the most dangerous part: the clean-up and the getaway. She picked up her toolbox and the endoscope, her movements returning to their usual economy, her face settling back into a mask of grim professional concern.\n\nHer descent in the lift was the longest thirty seconds of her life. She half-expected the doors to open on a phalanx of police officers, summoned by a panicked Elara. She expected to hear alarms, shouts, the sound of running feet. But there was only the gentle hum of the lift\u2019s motor and the soft ping as it arrived at the ground floor. She stepped out into the lobby, her heart hammering a steady, powerful rhythm against her ribs. The gardener was there, hovering anxiously by the main door, his face a mask of worry. He saw her and rushed forward. \"What happened? I heard a crash, and a scream\u2026\"\n\n\"A disaster,\" Ragan said, shaking her head with a pitch-perfect display of exhausted frustration. \"A pure disaster. The tenant, the young woman, she startled me while I was on my knees, and I went over like a sack of spuds. Knocked over a lamp, a load of computer stuff. Water everywhere. The machine's fried. And I've knocked over some\u2026 craft project she was working on. Pink stuff. All over her white floor. It\u2019s a complete write-off.\" She ran a hand over her face, the very picture of a tradeswoman having the worst day of her career. \"She\u2019s hysterical, and I don't blame her. You\u2019ll need to get the management company to send a specialist cleaner, an electrician, a computer technician\u2026 the lot. My insurance will cover it all, of course. I'll call my office now and get the incident report started.\" She was building a wall of paperwork and procedure around the event, a firewall of mundane bureaucracy that would, with any luck, obscure the truth of what had just happened. The gardener paled, imagining the phone calls and angry emails. \"Right,\" he said, deflating. \"Right. I\u2019ll\u2026 I\u2019ll call the manager.\" Ragan nodded, gave him a grim look of shared misery, and pushed her way out into the blessedly fresh, damp air of the Bath afternoon.\n\nThe walk back to the van was a slow, deliberate march away from a blast zone. She did not look back. Every step was a small victory, carrying her further from the gilded cage she had just rattled to its foundations. Once inside the familiar, scuffed interior of the Transit, she locked the doors and leaned her forehead against the cold steering wheel, the scent of diesel and old tea a profound comfort. She allowed herself sixty seconds of stillness, her body finally acknowledging the strain. Then she sat up, pulled her phone from her pocket, and dialled. McIlvanney answered on the first ring, his voice a taut wire of stress. \"Ragan, where are you? We've had a team on standby\u2026\"\n\n\"Stand them down,\" Ragan said, her voice a low, gravelly rasp. \"Or rather, send them in. But they'll need a paramedic, not an arrest warrant.\" She gave him a clipped, professional summary, editing out her own intent and presenting it as a chain of unfortunate events. \"There was an accident during the inspection. The subject's equipment has been\u2026 decommissioned. Permanently. The laptop is destroyed. Her communication with the network is severed. The primary device for the\u2026 ritual\u2026 is also broken. Subject is in a state of extreme distress. The connection is cut, Inspector.\"\n\nThere was a stunned silence on the other end of the line, so profound that Ragan could hear the faint hum of a computer in his office. \"You had an *accident*,\" McIlvanney repeated slowly, the words dripping with a mixture of incandescent fury and utter, incredulous relief. \"You just happened to have an *accident* that accomplished in ten minutes what would have taken my colleagues in Somerset a week of court orders to even attempt.\"\n\n\"I'm a caretaker, Inspector,\" Ragan replied, the engine of the Transit already turning over. \"Messes happen. My job is to sort them out. This one\u2019s sorted. The rest is up to you.\" She pulled away from the kerb without another word, merging into the traffic, a shabby white van disappearing into the elegant city. She was just another contractor leaving a job, a ghost slipping away from the scene of the crime she had both committed and prevented.\n\nThe long drive north was a journey through a decompression chamber. As the honeyed stone of Bath gave way to the anonymous grey of the motorway, Ragan felt the tension slowly begin to recede from her shoulders. The silence in the van was broken only by the drone of the engine and the rhythmic slap of the windscreen wipers. The adrenaline had worn off, leaving behind a bone-deep weariness that settled in her marrow. She had averted the Grand Union. She had saved God knows how many lost souls from a sticky, grotesque end. But she felt no triumph. She had seen the void in Elara Vance\u2019s eyes, the terrifying emptiness that she had filled with this monstrous, twee fantasy. She had not vanquished a monster; she had broken a profoundly sick and lonely child, and the thought left a bitter, metallic taste in her mouth.\n\nHours later, parked in the grim, fluorescent glare of a motorway service station somewhere in the Midlands, she allowed herself to look. She pulled out her phone, her fingers fumbling slightly with exhaustion, and navigated to the forums of Josephine\u2019s Sweeties. The change was instantaneous and seismic. The countdown clock was gone. The page was a chaotic storm of panic and confusion. *'Where is she? Josephine, are you there?' 'The video has been deleted!' 'I was ready! What is happening?' 'Is this a test? A test of our love?'* The ecstatic devotion had curdled into fear. Their god had gone silent on the eve of their ascension. Ragan scrolled through the frantic messages, a new kind of coldness creeping over her. She had cut the head off the snake, but the body was still thrashing, leaderless and unpredictable. The stain hadn't been entirely cleaned. It had just been smeared. She closed the browser, finished her bitter, lukewarm coffee, and pointed the van north, towards the sea, towards home. The job was done, but the aftermath, she knew, was just beginning."

Ragan sat in the sterile cafeteria, staring out at the churning, slate-grey water of the Irish Sea, the rhythmic vibration of the engines a constant thrum in her bones. She felt hollowed out, scoured clean by the events of the past week. The other passengers, families returning from holidays with sun-pinked skin and oversized bags of souvenirs, existed in a different universe, one governed by schedules and simple pleasures. Ragan felt like she was returning from a war no one else knew was being fought, carrying the invisible shrapnel of it home with her. The familiar sight of the Northern Irish coast, a dark green smudge on the horizon, brought no comfort, only a profound sense of dislocation.\n\nStepping out of her van in Derry felt like stepping onto a different planet. The air was thick with the familiar, damp chill, a mixture of river water, old stone, and the faint, acrid scent of distant coal smoke. It was the smell of home, but her senses were still tainted by the ghost of that other smell, the cloying, synthetic sweetness that now felt like a permanent stain on her memory. She drove to her small terraced house, the streets of her city looking both achingly familiar and subtly changed, as if a filter had been placed over her eyes. The mundane details\u2014a neighbour putting out their recycling bin, a gaggle of schoolchildren in uniform\u2014seemed impossibly, beautifully normal, yet she felt utterly disconnected from them, a spectator watching a play about a life she used to live.\n\nThe next day, she forced herself back into her routine, accepting a small job Eamonn had left for her: a blocked gutter in a house near the university. She stood on a ladder in the light drizzle, her hands working with their old, familiar competence, pulling out fistfuls of sodden leaves and black sludge. The physical work was a relief, a grounding reality. But as she worked, her mind kept drifting. The curve of the gutter reminded her of the Royal Victoria Crescent; the gurgle of the newly cleared downpipe sounded like the hiss of a dying laptop. She found herself scanning the faces of the students walking past, their faces buried in their phones, and wondered how many of them were lonely, how many were lost, how many were just a few clicks away from finding their own Josephine. The world suddenly seemed filled with invisible traps, its surfaces hiding a deep and terrifying rot.\n\nThe call from McIlvanney came that afternoon, as she was cleaning her tools in the garage. His voice was different, stripped of its usual layers of sarcasm and irritation. It was the flat, tired voice of a man who had seen too much and now had to file the paperwork. He told her the official story, the one that would be fed to the press if anyone ever asked. There had been an incident at a luxury apartment in Bath. A young woman, Elara Vance, had suffered a severe psychotic break. There had been a minor electrical fire from a faulty lamp, and the water used to douse it had damaged some electronics. She was now in a secure private psychiatric facility, her father\u2019s money ensuring complete discretion. The police had logged it as a mental health crisis, case closed.\n\n\"They found her kneeling on the floor, covered in pink paint, holding a broken laptop and talking to people who weren't there,\" McIlvanney said, his voice low. \"The IT guys in Somerset managed to get a ghost of her hard drive. It was all there. Just like you said. The forums, the videos, the\u2026 recipes. They\u2019re calling it \u2018induced delusional disorder on a mass scale\u2019. Christ, Ragan. There were thousands of them, all waiting for the signal on Saturday. God only knows how many would have gone through with it.\" He paused, and Ragan heard him draw a heavy breath. \"Off the record, you did a good thing. A mad, illegal, reckless thing that I will deny until my dying day. But you did it. Thank you.\"\n\nThe thanks landed with a dull thud, offering no comfort. \"And the others?\" Ragan asked, her gaze falling on the corner of her desk where her own computer sat, a silent gateway to that other world. \"The Sweeties? What about them?\" A weary sigh came down the line. \"They\u2019re scattered. Panicked. The main Josephine page was taken down by the platform\u2019s moderators once Somerset sent them the warrant. But the smaller forums are still active. It\u2019s like smashing a mercury thermometer. You\u2019re just left with hundreds of toxic little balls rolling into dark corners. We can\u2019t police them all. It's over, Ragan. We stopped the main event. Now let it go. Go back to fixing taps. It's what you're good at.\"\n\nBut Ragan knew she couldn't let it go. That night, sleep offered no rest, only a frantic, looping dream of a countdown clock ticking towards zero. Before the sun had even risen, she was in her small office, the familiar smell of disinfectant doing little to cleanse the phantom sweetness from her mind. She turned on her computer and descended once more into the digital underworld. The main Josephine page was gone, replaced with a sterile, corporate notice about terms of service violations. But McIlvanney was right. The smaller forums, the private messaging groups, were still there, and they were mutating. In the power vacuum, new narratives were being born. The confusion of the first few days had given way to something harder, more dangerous. A schism had occurred. Some groups had dissolved, their members expressing disillusionment and fear. But others had coalesced around a new, darker faith.\n\nShe found a forum called \u2018The Sweetest Truth\u2019, and what she saw there made her blood run cold. They had a new prophet. A user named \u2018Anthem\u2019, who had previously been a minor but zealous disciple, was now holding court. His posts were not the cloying, whispery prose of Josephine. They were filled with rage and a call to arms. He had created a new mythology. Josephine had not abandoned them. She had been martyred. She had been taken from them by the \u2018Bitters\u2019, the \u2018Unsweet\u2019\u2014the cruel, unloving world that could not understand their purity. The \u2018accident\u2019 in her apartment was an attack. Josephine was a prisoner, and it was their duty not to join her in a passive union, but to fight for her. The language had shifted from self-annihilation to retribution. The posts were no longer about feet and candy. They were about identifying the Bitters. They were about \u2018sharing their love\u2019 in a new, more aggressive way. Anthem had posted a new design for a Splurge-Gun, \u2018v.3\u2019, reinforced, with a higher-pressure nozzle. Not a tool for a ritual, but a weapon.\n\nRagan felt a sickness rise in her, a feeling worse than anything she had felt in Bath. She had cut off the head of the hydra, only for two more to grow in its place, uglier and more venomous than the first. She scrolled through the messages, her caretaker\u2019s eye for detail picking out the chilling specifics. They were trying to find out who had been in the apartment. They were looking for the \u2018Bitter\u2019 who had taken their Queen. They were piecing together a puzzle, sharing scraps of information gleaned from the gardener\u2019s gossip passed through the building\u2019s other residents, filtered through the property management company. They were looking for a cleaning company. For a woman with a Derry accent. For a white Ford Transit. Ragan stood up, backing away from the screen as if it were radioactive. The stain wasn't just smeared. It was spreading back towards her. Her job wasn\u2019t over. She hadn\u2019t just cleaned up the source. She had become the target."

                                        "text": "The transition from a global threat to a personal one was seamless, a simple re-angling of the lens. Ragan stood in the cold, familiar silence of her garage, the only light coming from the computer screen where the words \u2018a woman with a Derry accent\u2019 burned with a malevolent, phosphorescent glow. The space, her sanctuary of order and solvent, suddenly felt porous, its brick walls no defence against a danger that could travel as a whisper on a forum and arrive as a footstep in the night. The digital mess she had tried to contain in Bath had not been cleaned up; it had aerosolized, and now she was breathing it in. This was no longer about saving the lost. This was about survival.\n\nHer first move was not one of panic, but of ingrained, methodical habit. She shut down the computer, cutting the connection to the seething digital hive. She went to her small kitchenette in the corner of the office and boiled the kettle, her movements precise and unhurried. As she brewed a mug of tea so strong it was almost black, she catalogued the problem as she would a complex structural fault. The enemy knew her profession. They knew her city. They knew the type of vehicle she drove. They knew her gender and accent. They did not, she reasoned, have her name or her face. Not yet. The information was fractured, a collection of details gathered from the periphery. They were hunting a ghost, a description, not a person. It was a small advantage, but Ragan had built her life on the marginal gains found in small details.\n\nWhen she stepped outside the next morning, the world had been re-contextualized. Every white van parked on a residential street was a potential surveillance post. Every passing pedestrian whose gaze lingered for a second too long was a possible scout. Her own Transit, parked in its usual spot, was no longer a symbol of her trade but a billboard advertising her presence. The sensible blue lettering spelling 'Ragan's Responsive Caretaking' seemed to scream her identity into the quiet morning air. For the first time, she felt a flicker of true, cold fear. It was the feeling of being exposed, of having her carefully ordered world rendered vulnerable by an enemy who obeyed no rules but their own grotesque scripture. She had spent a lifetime making places safe, and now her own had become the most dangerous place of all.\n\nThe message arrived not through a screen, but on glass. It was placed on the windscreen of her van, directly in her line of sight. It was a single, black ant, its tiny legs curled in death, perfectly preserved within a small, domed drop of hardened pink goo. It was a jewel of malice, a piece of their ritual art delivered to her doorstep. The morning dew had collected around its base, making the obscene little relic glitter in the weak sunlight. There was no note, no threat scrawled in lipstick. There didn't need to be. The symbol was the message: *We see you. We are here. The Bitters will be made sweet.* It was a declaration of intent, a promise that the war had come home to Derry.\n\nAny other person might have recoiled, might have wiped the thing away in disgust and fear. Ragan\u2019s reaction was colder, more practical. She went back into her garage and returned with a small evidence bag and a thin, flexible palette knife she used for removing old sealant. With the delicate precision of an archaeologist uncovering a fossil, she carefully scraped the pink dome from the glass. The substance was brittle, flaking slightly at the edges, but it held. She sealed it in the bag, her name for the new exhibit already forming in her mind: \u2018Anthem, Exhibit A\u2019. She was not a victim to be terrorized. She was an opponent, and this was the enemy\u2019s first mistake. They had given her a piece of themselves, a physical clue in a world of digital ghosts. She had a sample of their new work.\n\nShe knew she could not handle this alone. The game had changed, and her solitary crusade was no longer sustainable. She sat in the driver\u2019s seat of her van, the small plastic bag with its macabre contents lying on the passenger seat, and dialled DI McIlvanney. He sounded relieved to hear from her, his tone that of a man who had successfully closed a difficult file. The relief evaporated as she spoke. She described the new forum, the 'Sweetest Truth'. She described the shift in ideology from self-harm to retribution, and the hunt for the \u2018Bitter\u2019 who had martyred their queen. She told him about the ant.\n\n\u201cThey left me a present on my van this morning, Inspector,\u201d she said, her voice a low, steady thrum of controlled anger. \u201cOne of their little pink bonbons. They are here. In the city. And they are looking for me.\u201d A long, heavy silence stretched down the line, filled with the unspoken weight of McIlvanney\u2019s dawning horror. This wasn\u2019t a case he had closed; it was a shapeshifting nightmare that had followed his informant home. \u201cStay inside, Ragan,\u201d he said, his voice dropping to an urgent command. \u201cLock your doors. Don\u2019t go anywhere. I\u2019ll have a patrol car do a drive-by every hour. We\u2019ll look into the forum, see if we can get a location on this \u2018Anthem\u2019 character.\u201d His words were meant to be reassuring, but to Ragan they sounded like a recipe for a siege, for becoming a prisoner in her own home.\n\nLaying low was not a solution; it was a delaying tactic. It was waiting for the damp to become rot, for the crack to become a chasm. She looked at the bag on the seat, at the tiny, silent messenger. They thought they were hunting her, but they had misjudged their quarry. They saw a caretaker, a cleaner, an old woman. They didn\u2019t see the person who had dismantled their goddess with a toolbox and a lie. The fear she had felt earlier was now burning away, replaced by a cold, hard resolve that settled deep in her bones. She would not wait for them to find her. She would not hide behind locked doors while a patrol car drove past. She would do what she always did. She would trace the problem to its source. Her garage was no longer just a sanctuary; it was a command post. Her van was not a liability; it was a tool. The hunt for Josephine was over. The hunt for Anthem was about to begin."

                                        "text": "The siege lasted exactly twelve hours. For twelve hours, Ragan did as she was told. She locked the heavy-duty bolts on her garage door and the reinforced locks on the house. She sat in her small, tidy living room, a place she normally only used for paperwork and Sunday evenings, and felt the silence of the house press in on her. The hourly drive-by of the PSNI patrol car was not a comfort; it was a rhythmic reminder of her own imprisonment. Each time its headlights swept across her front window, she felt a fresh surge of impotent fury. This was not safety. This was containment. She was a specimen in a jar, waiting for the researchers to decide what to do next, while the danger grew unchecked outside.\n\nBy dawn, her patience, a notoriously shallow reservoir to begin with, had evaporated completely. She moved from the house to the garage, her true domain, and placed the small evidence bag on her steel workbench under the stark, unforgiving light of a fluorescent tube. The hardened pink dome was a perfect, obscene little jewel. She took a scalpel from her toolbox and, with a surgeon\u2019s precision, shaved off a small sliver of the material. It was sugary, yes, but there was a new undertone to the scent, a sharper, more chemical bite than the craft glue she remembered from Liam\u2019s flat. She subjected a fragment to the flame of a butane torch; it blackened and hissed, giving off an acrid smoke that was nothing like burning sugar. It was a polymer. A plastic. Her eyes scanned the shelves of her own supplies, the cans of solvents and resins she used for specialised repairs. She knew this smell. It was epoxy. The new recipe for the Splurge-Gun was not just a confection; it was an industrial adhesive, designed for a permanent, unyielding bond. This was not a weapon for a symbolic, gentle union. This was a weapon designed to incapacitate, to bind, to hold.\n\nThe realisation that they had upgraded their arsenal galvanised her. Hiding was no longer just an affront to her nature; it was a tactical error of the highest order. She went to work on her van, not to fortify it, but to erase it. The 'Ragan's Responsive Caretaking' lettering had been on the side of the Transit for fifteen years, a proud declaration of her independence and competence. With a heat gun and a plastic scraper, she began the painstaking process of peeling it away. The vinyl came off in stubborn, ragged strips, taking slivers of paint with it, leaving behind a ghostly, pale blue silhouette of her name on the darker, weathered paintwork. When she was done, the Transit was anonymous, a generic work van, one of thousands that traversed the city\u2019s streets every day. She had shed her skin, becoming just another part of the city's background noise, a perfect camouflage for a hunter.\n\nHer new caretaking rounds began. Her search grid was a map of Derry\u2019s commercial arteries, marked with every large supermarket, DIY chain, and, most importantly, every small, specialist hobby shop. She reasoned that this new cult, this \u2018Sweetest Truth\u2019, would be sourcing its materials locally. Anthem was building a cell here in her city, and cells needed supplies. For two days, she drifted through the city like a ghost, her van parked in rain-slicked car parks, her eyes scanning the flow of humanity. She walked the aisles of Tesco and B&Q, her gaze sweeping over the baking supplies and the adhesives, watching for anyone buying the wrong combination of items. It was a search for a needle in a haystack the size of a city, and it was maddening, soul-crushingly tedious work. McIlvanney called, his voice tight with controlled anger. \"My patrol car reported your van was gone, Ragan. Where the hell are you?\" She told him she was running an errand. \"Your errand is to stay alive!\" he\u2019d barked back. \"Get home. That's an order.\" She had hung up, the order dying in the empty air of her van.\n\nThe breakthrough came on the third day, not in a gleaming superstore, but in a cramped, dusty model shop tucked away on a side street off the Strand Road, a place that smelled of enamel paint and old cardboard. It catered to a dedicated clientele of model railway enthusiasts and wargamers. Through the grime-caked window, she saw him. He was young, no more than twenty, with a thin, wispy beard and the pale, indoor complexion of someone who lived their life through a screen. His eyes had the same unsettling combination of vacancy and zealous intensity she had seen in the profile pictures of the Sweeties. He was at the counter, and the shopkeeper was bagging his purchases: two large twin-packs of a high-performance epoxy resin, the kind used for building remote-control aircraft, and three small vials of a vivid, glossy 'Signal Pink' acrylic paint. It was the V.3 recipe. It was the blood of the new sacrament.\n\nRagan\u2019s heart began a slow, heavy beat, a drum signaling the start of the real hunt. She entered the shop, picked up a can of matte varnish she had no use for, and got in line behind him. She could smell the faint, unwashed scent of him, the odour of someone who had forgotten the basic rituals of self-care in favour of a more consuming devotion. He paid in cash, his hands trembling slightly as he stuffed the small plastic bag into the pocket of his anorak. He scurried out of the shop like a nocturnal creature startled by the light. Ragan paid for her varnish, her movements calm, her expression placid. She walked out, got into her anonymous blue van, and waited. A moment later, the young man appeared at the end of the street, pulling up the hood of his coat against the drizzle and beginning to walk, his pace hurried and furtive.\n\nThe pursuit was a delicate art. She gave him a hundred-yard lead, following him not as a car, but as a slow, patient predator. She tracked his route through the city, past the Guildhall, over the Craigavon Bridge, and into the sprawling, anonymous housing estates of the Waterside. These were newer streets, a labyrinth of identical semi-detached houses and neatly trimmed lawns that all blurred into one. This was a world away from the historic intensity of the Bogside; it was a landscape of quiet, suburban isolation, the perfect breeding ground for a bedroom cult. The young man turned into a cul-de-sac, walked up the driveway of a neat but slightly neglected-looking house\u2014the grass a little too long, a newspaper still in the letterbox from the day before\u2014and let himself in. Ragan drove past slowly, her eyes fixing the house number, the colour of the door, the make of the car in the drive. She continued to the end of the street, turned the van around, and parked in a spot that gave her a clear, unobstructed view of the front of the house. The thread she had found in the model shop had led her here. She had found the nest. The lights were on inside, and somewhere in that unassuming brick house, Anthem and his disciples were preparing for their war."

                                        "text": "The house in the Waterside was a monument to suburban anonymity. It was a semi-detached brick box, identical to its neighbours on the left and right, distinguished only by a slightly overgrown lawn and curtains that remained perpetually drawn. From her vantage point at the far end of the quiet cul-de-sac, Ragan watched the rhythms of the street unfold. Children on bicycles wobbled past, a postman made his cheerful rounds, neighbours exchanged pleasantries over garden fences. It was a portrait of mundane peace, and the house in the centre of her vision was a cancer hidden within it, its occupants utterly alien to the world just inches from their front door. For a full day and night, she watched, a patient, motionless figure in the driver's seat of an unremarkable blue van, her existence marked only by the slow clouding of her own breath on the inside of the windscreen.\n\nMore of them arrived. Not in a fleet of black cars, but drifting in one by one, like leaves caught in an invisible current. The young man from the model shop was the first. Later, a girl with haunted, hollowed-out eyes and a limp jacket two sizes too big for her arrived on a bus, walking the last half-mile with her head bowed. A boy who couldn't have been more than seventeen was dropped off by his mother, who waved cheerfully from her hatchback as he scurried inside without a backward glance. There were four of them in total, plus whoever lived there permanently. A coven of the lost and the lonely, drawn to the promise of Anthem's new, violent gospel. They did not emerge. Lights burned in the upstairs windows throughout the night, casting a sickly yellow glow that seemed fundamentally different from the warm, domestic light of the surrounding houses. They were busy. They were preparing.\n\nThe opportunity, when it came, was a gift from the Derry City Council. Tuesday was bin day. In the pre-dawn darkness, long before the first hint of grey lightened the sky, Ragan slipped from her van. She was a shadow in work boots, moving with a silent, purposeful grace. The bins from the target house had been left at the edge of the drive, overflowing. This was Ragan\u2019s true area of expertise: the analysis of what people discard. She worked quickly, her gloved hands sifting through the domestic refuse. The findings were a chilling confirmation. She found the empty, stiff plastic packets of the epoxy resin, dozens of them. She found the small, empty vials of \u2018Signal Pink\u2019 paint. She found a mountain of takeaway cartons and energy drink cans, the fuel for their manic preparations. And then, at the bottom of a black bag, wrapped in a grease-stained pizza box, she found their plans.\n\nIt was a promotional leaflet for the upcoming \u2018Festival of Unity\u2019, a free peace concert scheduled for the next evening in Guildhall Square. The leaflet was covered in frantic, handwritten notes. A crude map had been drawn, marking out the main stage, the exits, and the position of the first aid tents. Three locations around the perimeter of the square were circled in thick black marker. And on the back of the leaflet, a list. Not of names, but of titles: \u2018The Mayor\u2019, \u2018The Chief Constable\u2019, \u2018The Bishop\u2019. It was a target list. They weren't planning a symbolic protest. They weren't planning on harming themselves. They were planning an attack. They intended to use their new, industrial-grade Splurge-Guns to incapacitate the city\u2019s leadership in the middle of a peace concert. The irony was so grotesque, so utterly perverse, it made Ragan feel physically sick. The \u2018Sweetest Truth\u2019 was not a metaphor. It was a battle plan.\n\nShe was on the phone to McIlvanney before she was even back in her van, the leaflet clutched in her gloved hand like a death warrant. She didn't give him time to berate her. She laid it out in a cold, clear monotone: the house, the cell, the epoxy, the target, the concert, the list of civic leaders. She was not presenting a theory; she was delivering a finished intelligence report. The silence on the other end was a stretched, taut thing, the sound of a man\u2019s entire worldview being forcibly realigned. He didn't question her. He didn't doubt her. The time for that was long past. \"I'll get the warrant,\" he said, his voice a low, dangerous growl she had never heard from him before. \"I'll call the Tactical Support Group myself. We'll take them down tonight.\"\n\nBut Ragan, looking at the quiet, sleeping house, felt a cold dread that had nothing to do with the occupants. The concert was less than thirty-six hours away. A warrant, even a rush job, had to navigate a chain of command. It had to be signed by a judge. It had to be planned. It was a process, and processes had delays, hitches, unforeseen complications. The system was a cumbersome, heavy machine, and she had seen firsthand how quickly these new cults could move. She could not afford to put her faith in a signature. She had to build an insurance policy. She watched as a bedroom light went out in the house, a sign that one of the zealots was finally sleeping. She looked at the family car parked in the driveway, a perfectly ordinary Ford Focus. It was their only means of transporting themselves and their grotesque arsenal to the city centre. And in that moment, Ragan the informant was once again replaced by Ragan the caretaker. She saw a problem that needed a practical, hands-on solution.\n\nThat night, as the last of the streetlights flickered off and the cul-de-sac was plunged into a deep, suburban darkness, she moved. She was not a saboteur; she was a mechanic performing a very specific, preventative repair. She slid under the Ford Focus, the damp tarmac cold against her back, a small penlight held between her teeth. She located the fuel line, a thin, vulnerable artery running along the chassis. With a pair of wire snips from her tool belt, she didn't sever it completely. That would be too obvious, a pool of petrol on the driveway that would be seen immediately. Instead, she made a small, precise nick in the rubber, a tiny wound that would weep, not gush. It would be enough. The car would start. It would drive a few hundred yards, maybe half a mile. And then, as the air bled into the line and starved the engine, it would die. It would fail them, not on their doorstep where they could fix it, but out in the open, exposed on a public road. As she slid back out from under the car, a movement in an upstairs window caught her eye. A curtain was pulled back an inch. A pale face, featureless in the dark, looked out. Ragan froze, her body becoming one with the deep shadow of a neighbour\u2019s hedge. For a long, heart-stopping moment, the face remained, a silent observer in the night. Then, the curtain fell back into place. Ragan didn\u2019t know if she had been seen. It didn\u2019t matter. The job was done. She retreated to her van, her heart a cold, steady engine, and settled in to wait for the morning, and for the inevitable chaos to begin."

                                        "text": "The morning broke grey and indecisive, the sky a canopy of bruised clouds that threatened a rain that never quite came. From her position of vigil, Ragan watched the house. The drawn curtains were a blank, unreadable face, giving nothing away. The silence of the cul-de-sac was a thin veneer over a pit of churning activity she could only imagine. Inside that brick box, a small group of radicalised youths were preparing to bring their bizarre, sticky jihad to the heart of the city. Ragan nursed a cold mug of tea, the bitter taste a welcome anchor in the surreal stillness. She was a landmine, buried and waiting. She had laid her trap. Now, all she could do was wait for the pressure that would trigger it.\n\nThe phone call from McIlvanney came just after ten o'clock, his voice a low, frantic rasp, frayed at the edges with the static of bureaucratic friction. \"The warrant's stalled, Ragan. The judge we need is at a conference in Belfast. His deputy won't sign off on a no-knock raid based on evidence retrieved from a dustbin by a civilian informant. They\u2019re calling it circumstantial. The TSG are sat in their briefing room playing cards. I can\u2019t move them. I can\u2019t do a bloody thing until I get that signature, and that might not be until this afternoon. Too late.\" It was the sound of a good man being strangled by the red tape he was sworn to uphold. \"For the love of all that's holy, stay put. Do not engage. Do not even breathe in their direction. Wait for my call.\"\n\nRagan looked at the quiet house. Waiting was a death sentence. The concert was tonight. Her insurance policy was now the only plan in motion. \"They won't wait for your signature, Inspector,\" she said, her voice flat. \"They're on a schedule.\" She ended the call, the Inspector's unheard protest a faint squawk of frustration. The hours crawled by. The normal life of the cul-de-sac continued around the epicentre of the planned attack. A delivery van dropped off a parcel next door. A dog barked. Ragan felt a strange, chilling detachment, as if she were watching two different films projected onto the same screen.\n\nThen, at half-past three in the afternoon, the front door of the target house opened. They emerged, not as a charging horde, but as a shuffling, nervous pack. There were five of them. Anthem, the pale-faced zealot from the model shop, was clearly the leader, his movements jerky and agitated. The others huddled close behind him, their faces a mixture of fear and ecstatic, wide-eyed resolve. Each of them carried a heavy-looking, overstuffed backpack. They piled into the Ford Focus, a clumsy, uncoordinated scramble of limbs and bags. The engine turned over, coughed, and caught. For a heart-stopping second, Ragan felt a cold spike of doubt. Had the nick been too small? Had it sealed itself? But then the car pulled away from the kerb, its engine sounding rough but functional. It reached the end of the cul-de-sac and turned out onto the main road, heading towards the city centre. Ragan gave them fifty yards, then pulled her own anonymous van out, joining the flow of traffic, a silent, blue shadow in their wake.\n\nThe end came three streets later, on a busy artery clogged with afternoon school-run traffic. Just as Ragan had calculated, the air entering the fuel line finally reached the engine. The Ford Focus sputtered violently, its forward momentum dying as if it had hit an invisible wall. It bucked once, twice, and then coasted to a dead, silent halt in the middle of the lane. Horns immediately began to blare. The sudden, public failure was a catastrophe for them. Their carefully timed, covert plan had disintegrated into a public spectacle of incompetence.\n\nPanic erupted inside the car. Doors flew open and they spilled out onto the tarmac, their faces masks of disbelief and terror. Anthem was shouting, his voice thin and reedy against the cacophony of angry drivers. He tried to herd his small, terrified flock onto the pavement, their backpacks suddenly seeming impossibly large and conspicuous. Their anonymity was gone. They were just a gaggle of strange kids with heavy bags, causing a traffic jam, drawing the one thing they could not afford: attention. They abandoned the car and began to move, a frantic, disorganised cluster, heading on foot towards the city.\n\nThis was the moment. Ragan pulled her van into a side street, her hands steady, her mind clear and cold. She dialled McIlvanney. \"Your warrant is irrelevant,\" she said, her voice cutting through his frantic greeting. \"Your targets' transport has failed. They are on foot. On Glenside Road, heading towards the Craigavon Bridge. Five of them, carrying backpacks. I suspect those packs are full of epoxy resin and high-pressure water pistols. You have a public order situation, reasonable suspicion for a stop and search, and a group of panicked hostiles completely exposed. Your move, Inspector.\"\n\nShe didn't need to say more. She had created the circumstances. She had served the problem up on a platter, right in the middle of a public road where procedure and protocol could not be ignored. She heard McIlvanney barking orders in the background, the controlled chaos of a police response kicking into high gear. Ragan parked her van where she had a clear view of the bridge in the distance. She didn't have to wait long. First came the sirens, a faint, rising wail from multiple directions. Then she saw them: the five small figures, hurrying, almost running now, halfway across the bridge. And from both ends, the flashing blue lights converged. PSNI patrol cars screeched to a halt, blocking their path, trapping them. Uniformed officers, some with protective vests, spilled out, forming a tight, professional cordon. The five cultists froze, their pathetic rebellion ending not with a bang, but with the shriek of tires on wet tarmac. They were ordered to the ground, their hands on their heads. The officers were firm, loud, and utterly in control. One by one, the backpacks were removed and opened. Ragan was too far away to see the contents, but she didn't need to. She saw the sudden stiffening of the officers\u2019 postures, the sharp, unbelieving glances they exchanged. They had found the Splurge-Guns.\n\nRagan watched as her city\u2019s defenders cleaned up the mess she had served to them. She watched as the five pathetic disciples of a broken goddess were cuffed and led away, their faces crumpling from zealous fury into the simple, bewildered terror of children who had been caught. There was no victory in it, only a vast, soul-deep weariness. She had cut out the rot, but the decay was in the wood itself. She started the engine of her van. The peace concert would go on tonight. The Mayor would speak. The Bishop would pray. The city would celebrate its hard-won harmony, blissfully unaware of the bizarre, sticky war that had been fought and won in its streets that afternoon by a caretaker in a sensible blue van. As the last of the police cars sped away, carrying the last vestiges of Anthem\u2019s truth to a cold cell, Sergeant Ragan simply drove home."

                                        "text": "The peace was a thin, brittle skin stretched over the city. The Festival of Unity had gone ahead, a vibrant, noisy celebration of resilience that Ragan watched on a small television in her kitchen, her hands smelling of bleach and industrial soap. She saw the Mayor speak, her words full of civic pride. She saw the Bishop offer a blessing, his mitre a stark white shape against the darkening sky. She saw teenagers dancing, their faces illuminated by flashing stage lights, utterly oblivious to the fact that their world had almost been painted a sticky, permanent pink. The disconnect was a physical ache in Ragan\u2019s chest. She had averted a catastrophe, and the only evidence was a quiet space in the local holding cells and a profound, bone-deep exhaustion in her own soul.\n\nIn the days that followed, she threw herself back into her work with a ferocity that bordered on punishment. She took on the grim jobs, the ones that involved backed-up sewerage and years of accumulated grime, as if she could scour the memory of the past weeks from her own mind through sheer physical exertion. She scrubbed floors, unblocked drains, and repointed brickwork, the familiar, honest labour a temporary balm. But the city had changed for her. The familiar tapestry of Derry life now seemed to have a rotten thread running through it. A lonely-looking student hunched over a laptop in a cafe was no longer just a student, but a potential Liam. A sullen teenager arguing with their mother was a potential Ciara. The world she had once seen as simply messy, now seemed actively malevolent, full of hidden currents and digital poisons that could pull the unwary under.\n\nMcIlvanney called her a week after the arrests. His voice had regained some of its weary authority, the sharp edge of crisis having dulled into the blunter instrument of due process. \u201cIt\u2019s done, Ragan,\u201d he said, the finality in his voice like the closing of a heavy door. \u201cThey\u2019re all on remand. Conspiracy to cause public nuisance, possession of an offensive weapon\u2026 the book\u2019s been thrown at them. The ringleader, the one you called Anthem, hasn't said a word. Just sits in his cell, smiling. He\u2019s a strange one.\u201d He paused. \u201cThe others have all started talking. Crying for their mothers. They\u2019re just kids, Ragan. Scared, stupid kids who got caught in something they didn\u2019t understand.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey understood enough to build the weapons,\u201d Ragan replied, her voice flat. She was stripping old varnish from a doorframe, the acrid smell of the chemicals a welcome sharpness in the air. \u201cDid you get the leaflet?\u201d \u201cWe did,\u201d McIlvanney confirmed. \u201cIt will be exhibit A. Look, the point is, the local threat is neutralized. Somerset police have Elara Vance under a court order in a facility that\u2019s harder to get out of than Magilligan. The main forums are being shut down. You did it. You cleaned it all up. Now, for the last time, I\u2019m telling you as a friend, not a policeman. Let it go. Delete the files. Throw the laptop in the Foyle. Live your life.\u201d\n\nFor a few days, she tried. She scrubbed the ghost of her business name from the side of the Transit until the paintwork was raw. She worked from dawn until dusk, falling into bed each night in a state of physical collapse that she hoped would be enough to keep the dreams at bay. But the caretaker\u2019s instinct, the deep, ingrained need to check the dark corners and inspect the hidden pipes, was a part of her she could not scrub away. The silence from the digital world was not comforting; it was suspicious. It was the silence of a blocked drain before the pressure builds and the filth erupts somewhere unexpected.\n\nOne night, unable to sleep, she found herself in her small office, the glow of the monitor illuminating her stern, tired face. She navigated the dark warren of the internet, her fingers moving with a grim familiarity. McIlvanney was right; the main hubs were gone, replaced by error messages and takedown notices. But the mercury balls had, as he\u2019d predicted, scattered. She found them in the encrypted comment sections of obscure video-sharing sites, in password-protected image boards, and in newly created, private messaging groups. They were smaller, more paranoid, and infinitely more zealous. In these fragmented echo chambers, the mythology of the Sweeties was being rewritten. Josephine and Anthem were no longer just leaders; they were the First Martyrs. Their defeat was not a failure, but a holy sacrifice.\n\nIn a group named \u2018The Forever Garden\u2019, Ragan found the new scripture taking shape. The language had evolved again. It was no longer about a passive 'Grand Union' or an aggressive 'retribution'. The new philosophy was more insidious. It was about \u2018cultivation\u2019. They believed the world of the Bitters was not to be destroyed, but to be 'saved'. The new posts were filled with a strange, botanical terminology. The lonely and the lost were 'seeds'. The Splurge-Guns were 'watering cans'. Their mission was to 'plant the truth' in the 'barren soil' of the world. And they had a new ceremony, a new sacrament they called \u2018The Grafting\u2019. It was described in chilling, allegorical detail. It was about finding a Bitter, someone who had rejected or spoken against the Sweeties, and 'grafting' a piece of their truth onto them. It was about making the unwilling 'bloom'.\n\nRagan felt a cold dread that was deeper and more personal than anything she had felt before. This was not about suicide or terrorism anymore. This was a philosophy of violation. Of forced conversion. She scrolled through the posts, her eyes scanning for specifics, for a sign of their next move. She found it in a thread discussing the 'First Bitter'. They were talking about her. About the woman who had brought down their Queen. They had pieced together a fractured narrative from news reports of the \u2018incident\u2019 in Bath and the arrests in Derry. They had connected the two events. And at the bottom of the thread, one user had posted a new image. It wasn't a picture of feet. It was a grainy, pixelated screenshot from a Derry news website\u2019s video report on the traffic chaos caused by the arrests on the Craigavon Bridge. The camera had panned across the line of stuck traffic, and for a fleeting second, it had captured an anonymous blue Ford Transit parked on a side street. The driver\u2019s side window was down, and a figure was visible inside, partly obscured, holding a phone to their ear. The resolution was terrible, a smudge of colour and shape. But a new user, one Ragan hadn\u2019t seen before, with the simple handle \u2018Gardener\u2019, had replied to the image with a single, chilling sentence. 'I know that van. I know that face.'"

I know that face.'* The name, \u2018Gardener\u2019, was not a clue; it was a signed confession. The world, which had for a week felt dangerously abstract, snapped into terrifyingly sharp focus. The threat was no longer a faceless horde of digital phantoms. It was a man she had spoken to, a man whose weary complaints about black spot on roses she had listened to with feigned sympathy. It was Arthur Finch, the groundskeeper of the Royal Victoria Crescent, and he had just painted a target on her back for an international cult of violent fanatics.\n\nRagan pushed back from the desk, the scrape of her chair legs on the concrete floor a harsh, grating sound in the silence of the garage. She walked to the sink and splashed cold water on her face, the familiar shock of it a grounding sensation. She was not prey. She did not panic. She was a caretaker, and a new, critical fault had been identified in the system. The source of the leak was not Elara Vance, but the lonely, gossiping old man who had tended her gilded cage. He had seen Ragan's face, unfiltered by digital noise. He had heard her Derry accent. He had been given her company\u2019s name. And now, radicalised by the new mythology of Josephine\u2019s martyrdom, he was feeding that information, piece by priceless piece, into the churning, hateful engine of The Forever Garden.\n\nHer first and only call was to McIlvanney. She laid out the new development with the dispassionate clarity of a surgeon describing a tumour. The screenshot. The comment. The name 'Gardener'. \u201cHe saw my face in Bath, Inspector. He\u2019s feeding them everything he knows. The present on my windscreen wasn\u2019t from a local. It was a message to let me know the hunt had begun in earnest.\u201d\n\nMcIlvanney\u2019s response was a torrent of frustrated, terrified commands. \u201cWitness protection, Ragan. Now. We\u2019ll move you. A safe house. You can\u2019t stay there. They have your face. It\u2019s over.\u201d The very idea was anathema to her. A \u2018safe house\u2019 was just another name for a box, a form of sterile, indefinite imprisonment where she would be a passive victim waiting for the world to change. It was a council flat with better locks, and she would rather face a dozen Splurge-Guns than be reduced to that.\n\n\u201cYou want me to run?\u201d she said, the words laced with a cold incredulity. \u201cYou want me to abandon my home, my business, my life, because of some bitter old man with a laptop and a grudge? That isn\u2019t a solution, Inspector. That\u2019s letting them win. That\u2019s letting the mess spread until it fills everything.\u201d \u201cThis isn\u2019t a leaking pipe you can patch, Ragan!\u201d he roared, his voice cracking with a fear that was purely for her. \u201cThis is a man who has pointed a weapon at you, and the bullet is being carried by a thousand willing hands. We will find him, but we need time!\u201d\n\nRagan looked around her garage, at the orderly rows of tools, the neatly coiled hoses, the catalogues of parts she had memorised over thirty years. This was her world. She had built it, she maintained it, and she would be damned if she let it be dismantled by a ghost. \u201cTime is the one thing I don\u2019t have,\u201d she said, and quietly ended the call. She knew this was the last time she and McIlvanney would speak as quasi-allies. The next time they spoke, she would be a suspect.\n\nThe first step was to confirm the identity of the ghost. Ragan still had the leaflet from the Bath property management company, a relic from her fabricated insurance claim. The next morning, she put on her \u2018official business\u2019 voice, a clipped, no-nonsense tone that brooked no argument, and dialled their number. \u201cGood morning,\u201d she began, \u201cthis is a follow-up call regarding the water damage incident at Royal Victoria Crescent, flat six. Insurance claim reference [she reeled off a string of numbers]. My report requires the full name of the on-site staff member who first reported the issue. I have him down here as Mr. Finch, the groundskeeper.\u201d There was a rustle of papers on the other end, the click of a keyboard. \u201cYes, that\u2019s correct,\u201d a bored voice eventually replied. \u201cArthur Finch. He\u2019s been with us for years.\u201d\n\nArthur Finch. The name was a key, and it opened a series of small, mundane doors on the internet. He was not a ghost. He was a man in his late sixties, a widower living in a small, council-owned bungalow on the less-fashionable, southern edge of Bath. A search of local news archives brought up a handful of articles: a prize for \u2018Best Kept Allotment\u2019 three years running; a photograph of him at a charity bowling tournament, his face a mask of intense concentration. He was a man of small routines and smaller victories, a man so deeply embedded in the quiet fabric of his life that he was practically invisible. And that, Ragan knew, was what made him so dangerous. He was the lonely, overlooked man who had finally found a place where he mattered, a place where his small scraps of information made him a hero, a prophet of the \u2018Sweetest Truth\u2019.\n\nThe decision was not made; it simply presented itself as the only logical course of action. You do not wait for the pest controller when you have a rat in the wall. You deal with the rat yourself. She could not wait for one of Anthem\u2019s faithful to cross the Irish Sea with a backpack full of epoxy. She had to cut off the flow of information at its source. She had to go and have a word with Mr. Finch.\n\nThat night, for the third time in as many weeks, the anonymous blue Transit slipped out of Derry under the cover of darkness. This journey felt different from the others. The first had been a mission of discovery. The second, a mission of prevention. This was a mission of confrontation. The tools in the back of the van were the same, but her intent had been honed to a fine, sharp point. She was no longer just a caretaker cleaning up a mess. The mess had become personal. It had followed her home, it had threatened her world, and now she was going to follow it back to its origin and excise it, permanently. As the ferry pulled out into the black, silent expanse of the sea, Ragan did not look back at the receding lights of home. She looked forward, towards the dark horizon of England, her face set like stone, a sergeant going to war, a caretaker going to fix the final, most dangerous leak of all."

                                        "text": "The second journey south was a descent into a familiar hell, but this time Ragan knew the landscape. The motorways were grey, featureless ribbons spooling her towards the city of honey-coloured stone, a place she now associated not with Georgian elegance, but with a deep and cancerous rot. The beauty of Bath, when she finally rolled into its outskirts, was obscene. The perfect crescents and manicured parks seemed to mock her with their serene, oblivious grandeur. She felt a visceral disgust for its placid surface, knowing the sickness that festered just beneath. This was not a mission of discovery; it was pest control.\n\nArthur Finch\u2019s bungalow was on a small, neat council estate of post-war builds, a world away from the aristocratic sweep of the Royal Victoria Crescent. The houses were identical, functional, and imbued with a quiet, palpable loneliness. From her new parking spot, two streets away, she watched the rhythm of his life through her binoculars. It was a life of small, precise routines. At nine-thirty, he walked to a nearby allotment, a small, stooped figure in a worn flat cap. He returned at midday for lunch, his posture slightly prouder, carrying a bunch of leeks or a handful of new potatoes. The afternoons were spent indoors, the curtains slightly ajar, the flicker of a television the only sign of life within. He was a ghost in his own life, a man whose existence had been worn down by time and solitude into a predictable, circular path. This, Ragan understood with a chilling clarity, was the perfect petri dish for a cult like The Forever Garden. They hadn't offered him an escape from his life; they had offered him a purpose within it.\n\nHer plan was an echo of her previous success, a variation on a theme she had perfected over a lifetime. Deception was a tool, and Ragan was a master craftswoman. In the back of the Transit, she assembled her disguise. A high-visibility vest, stained with just the right amount of authentic grime. A laminated ID badge, created on her small portable printer, complete with a blurry photo of herself and the imposing crest of the local council. She was no longer Ragan of Responsive Caretaking. She was \u2018Brenda Watts\u2019, a Senior Damp & Structural Surveyor for the Bath & North East Somerset Housing Division. She carried a heavy-duty clipboard and a large metal case that held not surveying equipment, but a selection of carefully chosen tools for a different kind of structural adjustment.\n\nShe knocked on his door just after two o\u2019clock, the time when post-lunch lethargy would be at its peak. He opened it, and he was smaller and greyer than she remembered, his face a roadmap of mild, perpetual disappointment. His eyes flickered over her, taking in the uniform, the badge, the clipboard. He saw the costume, not the woman wearing it. Recognition did not dawn. He saw only an official inconvenience, another small trial sent to test his patience. \u201cMr. Finch?\u201d she asked, her voice adopting a flat, bureaucratic English accent she\u2019d practiced on the journey down. \u201cBrenda Watts, council housing. We\u2019re conducting mandatory damp surveys on all properties in this block. Won\u2019t take long.\u201d With a weary, put-upon sigh, he stepped back and let her in, holding the door open just wide enough for her to pass. The trap was set, and the target had walked into it of his own accord.\n\nThe inside of the bungalow was obsessively tidy, a shrine to a life that no longer existed. The air smelled of lavender polish and loneliness. On the mantelpiece, a row of silver-framed photographs showed a smiling, dark-haired woman, aging progressively through the decades, her image a constant, silent presence in the room. This was the house of a man who had lost his world and was now meticulously preserving the museum of what remained. But in the corner, by the window overlooking the neat, sterile back garden, was the portal to his new world. A modern computer desk, a powerful desktop PC, its monitor glowing with the sickly light of The Forever Garden forum. And on the desk, next to the keyboard, sat a small, clay pot. In it, nestled on a bed of cotton wool, was a single, perfect rosebud, coated in a shimmering, pearlescent shell of pink epoxy. A tribute. A devotional object. Ragan felt a cold, hard knot form in her stomach.\n\nShe went through the motions, her performance flawless. She tapped walls with the handle of a screwdriver. She made notes on her clipboard. She tutted about condensation and poor ventilation. Arthur Finch hovered nearby, wringing his hands, a bundle of nervous energy. \u201cEverything in order, I hope?\u201d he asked, his voice thin. \u201cI\u2019m very particular about the upkeep.\u201d Ragan\u2019s gaze drifted to the computer. \u201cIt\u2019s funny,\u201d she said, her voice still in character, \u201chow things can take hold in a house. You get a little bit of damp in a dark corner, you ignore it, and before you know it, the rot is in the very structure of the place.\u201d She walked slowly towards the desk, her eyes fixed on the screen. He hadn\u2019t even bothered to close the forum. He was logged in as \u2018Gardener\u2019. The screenshot of her van was still visible in the thread. \u201cIt takes a lot of care, a garden, doesn\u2019t it, Mr. Finch?\u201d she said, her voice losing its English flatness, the hard, unmistakable cadence of Derry creeping back in. \u201cYou have to be vigilant. You have to pull the weeds out by the root. Before they poison everything.\u201d\n\nHe froze. The shift in her accent was the key turning in the lock. His head snapped up, and for the first time, he looked, *truly looked*, at her face. The colour drained from his cheeks, his mouth opening in a silent gasp of horrified recognition. The official from the council dissolved, and in her place stood the woman from the Crescent, the Bitter, the First Heretic. The ghost he had been hunting was standing in his living room. \u201cYou,\u201d he whispered, the word a tiny, terrified puff of air. \"Brenda Watts has left the building, Arthur,\u201d Ragan said, her voice a low, dangerous rumble. She nodded towards the screen. \u201cI believe you and I have some things to discuss. About your online horticultural activities.\u201d\n\nPanic flared in his eyes, raw and animalistic. He made a move, a clumsy lunge towards the phone on a small side table. Ragan was faster. She didn't touch him. She simply moved to block his path, her presence suddenly filling the small room, a solid, immovable object of consequence. \u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d she said, the single word carrying the weight of an iron bar. \u201cThere is no one you can call who can help you now. The police? You think DI McIlvanney in Derry would be interested in your story? Or do you want to tell your new friends that you invited their arch-enemy into your house for a cup of tea?\u201d His entire body seemed to collapse in on itself. The fight went out of him, replaced by a trembling, abject terror. He sank into an armchair, his face grey, his breath coming in ragged, shallow gasps. He was just a lonely old man who had chosen the wrong god.\n\nRagan walked to the desk. She looked at the glowing screen, at the hateful, adoring words, at the plans to \u2018graft\u2019 her and others like her. Then she opened her metal case. She didn\u2019t pull out a weapon. She pulled out a tool. A large, powerful degaussing magnet, designed to completely erase the data from magnetic tape storage, but brutally effective on older mechanical hard drives. \u201cYou have caused a great deal of trouble, Arthur,\u201d she said, her voice calm and steady, like a doctor explaining a terminal diagnosis. \u201cYou have pointed a great many broken people in my direction. You have made my life\u2026 complicated. And I am a woman who prefers a simple, tidy life.\u201d With a slow, deliberate movement, she passed the magnet over the computer tower, a single, silent wipe that scrambled every byte of data, every hateful word, every saved image of Josephine\u2019s feet, into meaningless digital noise. She then unplugged the monitor, methodically wrapping the cord around it. She did the same to the keyboard, the mouse, the speakers. She was dismantling his shrine, piece by methodical piece. \u201cThis garden of yours,\u201d she said, coiling the final cable, \u201cis now closed. Permanently.\u201d\n\nShe turned to face him one last time. He was weeping silently, tears tracking paths through the weathered skin of his cheeks. He wasn\u2019t crying for his safety; he was crying for his lost purpose, for the silence that would now rush in to fill the void. \u201cYou will forget my name,\u201d Ragan said, her voice dropping to a near whisper, a tone far more terrifying than any shout. \u201cYou will forget my face. You will delete your accounts, or what\u2019s left of them. If I ever see the name \u2018Gardener\u2019 again, if I ever read one more post about \u2018The Grafting\u2019, if so much as a single pink-coated insect appears on my property, I will not come back for your computer. Do you understand me, Arthur?\u201d He could only nod, a series of tiny, jerky movements, a puppet with its strings cut. Ragan picked up her case and her clipboard and walked to the door. She didn't look back. She left him there, a man marooned in the wreckage of his own quiet life, the silence of the bungalow his new, permanent companion. As she walked down the path, she felt no triumph, only the grim, hollow satisfaction of a job finally, properly, done. The last leak had been sealed. The house was, for now, quiet."

Ragan drove with a mechanical, relentless focus, the monotonous rhythm of the motorway a hypnotic metronome marking the slow passage of miles. The adrenaline had long since burned away, leaving behind not the satisfaction of a job well done, but a strange, hollow ache in the centre of her chest. What she had done in Arthur Finch\u2019s bungalow was not a repair; it was a demolition. She had not patched a leak; she had taken a sledgehammer to a man\u2019s psyche, leaving him adrift in the silent ruins of his life. She had crossed a line, moving from a protector of the vulnerable to a terroriser of the pathetic, and the knowledge settled in her like a cold, heavy stone. There was no procedure for this, no form to fill out, no insurance policy to cover the moral damage. She was a woman who fixed things, and she had just broken a man, perhaps irreparably. The thought offered no triumph, only the grim, metallic taste of necessity.\n\nBack in Derry, the familiar rain felt like a benediction, a grey baptism washing the dust of England from her van. She drove straight to her garage, the small brick building a fortress of comforting, comprehensible order. The first thing she did was unpack her tools, cleaning each one with a meticulous, almost reverent care. She wiped the phantom fingerprints of Finch\u2019s tidy, lonely house from her metal case. She purged her high-visibility vest of its lingering scent of lavender polish. It was a ritual of purification, an attempt to scrub away the stain of what she had become in that quiet, desperate bungalow. She did not call McIlvanney. There was nothing to report, nothing that could be spoken of in the language of law and order. She had gone outside the book, torn out the relevant pages, and set them on fire. She was on her own, a rogue state of one, and the silence from the police was both a blessing and a confirmation of her complete and utter isolation.\n\nWeeks bled into a month. Ragan forced herself back into the comforting harness of her old life. She fixed dripping taps in student flats, re-mortared crumbling garden walls, and cleared the gutters of elderly widows who paid her in tea and biscuits. She worked with a grim, punishing intensity, seeking exhaustion as a shield against thought. The world tried to convince her it was normal again. The news was full of politics and football, the everyday dramas of a city at peace with itself. And in the dark, silent hours of the night, when the physical tiredness was not enough, she would go online. She stalked the dead forums and defunct message boards like a ghost haunting a graveyard. They were silent. The Forever Garden had withered. The Sweetest Truth had become a lie. The digital world seemed to have forgotten Josephine and her disciples. The silence was absolute. And it was the most terrifying thing she had ever known.\n\nThe call came on a Tuesday, of course. It was a grim job. A landlord needed a flat cleared in a rundown block overlooking the Foyle. The tenant, a young woman, had simply vanished, leaving behind three months of rent arrears and all her worldly possessions. The moment Ragan opened the door, she was hit by a wall of stale air, the familiar scent of neglect and cheap incense. The flat was a chaotic mess of discarded clothes, art supplies, and esoteric books. Ragan began her work, bagging clothes for charity, boxing books, her movements methodical. It was in the bedroom, on a small corkboard pinned with sketches and postcards, that she found it. It was not a Splurge-Gun or a pot of pink goo. It was a single, pressed flower, a white rose, its petals turning a delicate, papery brown. And stuck through its centre with a pearl-headed pin was the tiny, black, desiccated body of an ant. Beneath it, written in a delicate, spidery script, were two words: \u2018He bloomed.\u2019\n\nRagan stared at the macabre little icon, her blood turning to ice. The language was unmistakable. This was not a remnant of the old cult. This was a sign of the new one, the one that whispered of \u2018grafting\u2019 and \u2018cultivation\u2019. The tenant hadn\u2019t just vanished. She had graduated. She was a gardener now. She was out in the world, looking for barren soil in which to plant her seeds. Ragan took a step back, her gaze sweeping the room, seeing it now with new, horrified eyes. She had been so focused on the leaders, on the source, that she had failed to see the most fundamental truth of her trade: a leak doesn\u2019t need a plumber to spread. It just needs a crack. And the world was full of cracks. Elara Vance was locked away, Anthem and his pathetic cell were on remand, and Arthur Finch was a broken man staring at a blank wall. But the idea, the sweet, poisonous scripture of Josephine, was still out there. It had gone feral. It was mutating, adapting, surviving in small, hidden pockets of loneliness, tended by a new generation of believers who had learned from the mistakes of their martyrs.\n\nThat night, Ragan did not go to bed. She sat in her office, the single desklamp carving a small island of light out of the deep darkness of the garage. She had been a fool to think it was over, to believe that a problem this deeply rooted could be solved by cutting off a few visible branches. You didn't just fix a mess like this. You managed it. You monitored it. You became its custodian. She opened her laptop, the hum of its fan the only sound. Her old dummy profiles were useless, burned by her previous investigations. She began to create a new identity, a new ghost to send into the machine. This one was not a curious bystander or a potential convert. This one was a mourner. A lost \u2018Sweetie\u2019 looking for a new garden. Her fingers moved over the keyboard, crafting a plausible backstory, choosing a profile picture of a grey, rain-slicked street, a picture of anonymous, universal despair. She was no longer just a caretaker of buildings. That job was too small for the scale of the decay she now saw everywhere. She was a warden of the dark places, a sentinel posted on the crumbling border wall between the real world and the one that festered just behind the screen. The title she had earned, the one that had started as a joke and had become a burden, now settled upon her like a heavy but perfectly fitted coat. Sergeant Ragan was on duty. The watch was hers, and she knew, with a certainty that chilled her to the bone, that it would be for the rest of her life."

                                        "text": "The creation of \u2018Ash_ling\u2019 was a meticulous, grim piece of artifice. Ragan, who had never posted a personal photograph online in her life, now found herself curating a gallery of profound and believable despair. Her profile picture was a close-up of raindrops on a spider\u2019s web, each droplet a perfect, tiny world of distortion. Her feed became a portfolio of melancholia: a lone, skeletal leaf skittering across wet pavement; the blurred lights of traffic seen through a rain-streaked window; an empty swing moving slightly in the wind. They were the kind of pictures a lonely teenager might take, imbued with a significance that only they could understand. Her text posts were equally crafted, poetic fragments of grief and longing. She wrote of the \u2018Silence\u2019 where Josephine\u2019s voice used to be, of the \u2018coldness\u2019 of a world without her light, and of a desperate hope for a new \u2018bloom\u2019. She was planting a garden of digital sorrow, baiting the trap with the most potent lure she knew: shared loneliness.\n\nShe cast her lines into the dark water, revisiting the digital graveyards of the old cult. In the comment sections of deleted videos, under archived forum posts, she left her mournful little messages. *\u2018The garden is untended. The roses have withered. Is anyone else still waiting for the sun?\u2019* It was a message in a bottle, a coded lament for the initiated. For weeks, the only response was the vast, echoing silence of the dead internet. She felt a growing, gnawing anxiety that she had been wrong, that the cult had truly died, leaving her to be a lonely sentinel guarding an empty fortress. She continued her day job, the physical reality of blocked drains and peeling paint a stark contrast to the ethereal hunt she conducted at night. The Transit, now a blank, anonymous blue, felt less like camouflage and more like the skin of a ghost.\n\nThe first reply came not as a public comment, but as a flicker in the corner of her screen. A private message request from a user with a blank profile named \u2018Rhizome\u2019. The message was a single, cryptic question: *\u2018What colour were the thorns?\u2019* Ragan\u2019s mind raced. It was a test. A security question from a paranoid, fragmented cell. Thorns. Roses. Josephine. The pink goo. The answer had to be simple, obvious to a true believer but opaque to an outsider. She thought of the grotesque spatter in Liam\u2019s flat, the macabre sprinkles on a devil\u2019s dessert. The ants. The tiny, doomed pilgrims. She typed her reply, her fingers steady. *\u2018Black. The thorns were black and beautiful, and they marched to feel her love.\u2019*\n\nShe waited, her breath held tight in her chest. An hour passed. Then, a new message from \u2018Rhizome\u2019. It was a string of meaningless characters, a data-scramble that she recognised as an invitation link to an encrypted messaging server. The link was set to expire in sixty seconds. With a hurried click, she was pulled from the familiar architecture of the open internet into a dark, claustrophobic digital space. It was a single chat room, the background a stark, funereal black, the text appearing in a faint, phosphorescent green. There were only a dozen other users online. This was not a forum for thousands. This was a sealed bunker.\n\nThe vetting process was immediate and brutal. A user named \u2018Perennial\u2019 took the role of inquisitor, their questions sharp and mistrustful. *\u2018Why are you here, Ash_ling? The sun is gone. The garden is salted.\u2019* Ragan, channelling the ghosts of Liam and Ciara, let her grief flow into the keyboard. *\u2018I still have my seeds,\u2019* she wrote. *\u2018I was preparing my own watering can when the Silence came. I want to find a place to plant them.\u2019* They interrogated her for hours, testing her knowledge of the lost scripture. They asked about specific videos, the names of certain shades of pink paint Josephine had favoured, the music-box melodies she used. Ragan, with her perfect, grim archive of the cult\u2019s entire history, answered every question flawlessly. She became one of them, her sorrow and anger a perfect, fabricated reflection of their own. She told them the \u2018First Bitter\u2019 had taken the sun from them, that this heretic must be a creature of profound ugliness and hate. She typed the words, describing herself as a monster, and felt a piece of her own soul turn to cold, hard stone.\n\nFinally, after a night of relentless psychological pressure, she was accepted. She was now part of the cell. And in the days that followed, she was granted access to their inner sanctum, to the private channels where the new doctrine was taught. The full, horrifying reality of \u2018The Grafting\u2019 was laid bare. It was a systematic process of psychological warfare. The chosen target, a \u2018Bitter\u2019, would be stalked, their routines learned, their weaknesses identified. The initial phase was \u2018tilling the soil\u2019\u2014a campaign of subtle gaslighting and terror. Small objects moved in their home. A single black ant left on a pillow. A whispered word on a bad phone line. The goal was to destabilize, to create cracks in the victim\u2019s perception of reality.\n\nThe final stage, the Grafting itself, was a ritual of abduction and conversion. The plan was to isolate the victim and subject them to a relentless barrage of Josephine\u2019s ideology: her videos played on a loop, her whispers piped in through headphones, the air filled with the sweet, sickening scent of the pink mixture. The ceremony would culminate in the victim being physically bound and \u2018grafted\u2019 with an object of symbolic power\u2014a pink-coated rose, a shard of a broken mirror\u2014using the new, permanent epoxy. They would be marked, branded, their \u2018bitterness\u2019 forcibly plastered over with a symbol of the Sweeties\u2019 \u2018love\u2019. The goal was not to kill the body, but to annihilate the self, to force the victim to \u2018bloom\u2019 into one of them. It was a violation more intimate and terrifying than anything Ragan could have imagined.\n\nShe had to find their next target. She searched the chat logs, looking for any mention of a new project. She found it in a conversation between \u2018Perennial\u2019 and \u2018Rhizome\u2019. They were discussing their next Grafting, their most ambitious yet. They weren\u2019t targeting a local politician or a minor blogger. They were targeting the source of all their current pain. They had been trying for weeks to identify the judge who had signed the warrants for Anthem\u2019s arrest, the judge who had denied their prophet bail. And they had succeeded. They had a name: Judge Alistair Carmichael. And they had a location. He was scheduled to give the keynote address at a legal conference in two weeks\u2019 time. Not in Derry, not in London, but in the neutral, unassuming city of Glasgow. The cell was mobile. And their plan was already in motion. The hunt was on again, and Ragan, the sole guardian of this terrible knowledge, knew she had to get there first."
