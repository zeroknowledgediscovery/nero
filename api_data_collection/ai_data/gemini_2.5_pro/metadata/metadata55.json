     "novel_text": "The chalk dust, a fine, ghostly powder, settled on everything in Dr. Eleanor Vance\u2019s life. It coated the tweed of her jacket, found its way into the crevices of her leather satchel, and sometimes, she swore, she could taste its dry, mineral tang at the back of her throat as she lectured on the syntactical evolution of Middle English. Her world was one of quiet corridors and the hushed turning of pages in the university library, a world measured in semesters and the patient, slow erosion of ignorance. Wokingham, with its tidy brickwork and polite Saturday market, was the perfect backdrop for such a life. It was a town that didn\u2019t believe in making a scene.\n\nEllie, conversely, was about to make the biggest scene of her life.\n\nIt had started as a dare. A drunken, giddy dare from her sister, Imogen, on a rare night out that had strayed past ten o\u2019clock. \u201cGo on, El,\u201d Imogen had sloshed her gin and tonic, ice cubes clinking a frantic rhythm. \u201cYou\u2019re always humming. You\u2019ve got that big, booming voice you only use when you think no one\u2019s listening. Just send in a video. What\u2019s the worst that could happen?\u201d The worst that could happen, in Ellie\u2019s mind, was a vast and horrifying spectrum of possibilities, starting with mild embarrassment and ending with complete and utter professional ruin. A professor of linguistics, a woman who deconstructed the poetics of Chaucer, belting out an Etta James number for a panel of judges with surgically perfected smiles? The very idea was a category error.\n\nYet, she had done it. Fuelled by a second, uncharacteristic glass of Sauvignon Blanc and the persistent, needling voice of her sister, she had propped her phone against a stack of books (A History of the Schwa, The Canterbury Tales: A Modern Translation), and sung. Not to the phone, but to the memory of her mother, who had filled their childhood home with the sounds of jazz and soul, whose voice had been a warm blanket on cold nights. She sang \u2018At Last\u2019, her voice, surprisingly clear and resonant in the acoustically unforgiving space of her study, filling the room, pushing back against the silent judgment of a thousand bound volumes. She\u2019d sent the video, deleted it immediately from her phone as if to erase the evidence, and tried to forget the entire, mortifying episode.\n\nThe show, \u2018Britain\u2019s Next Star,\u2019 had not forgotten. An email had arrived a week later. An invitation to a preliminary audition in London. Ellie had stared at the subject line \u2013 *Your Journey to Stardom Begins!* \u2013 with the same detached horror she might reserve for a spider crawling across a priceless manuscript. She\u2019d almost deleted it. But Imogen had snatched the phone from her hand. \u201cNo way! You\u2019re going. I\u2019ll come with you. It\u2019ll be a laugh.\u201d\n\nIt hadn\u2019t been a laugh. It had been a blur of fluorescent lighting, trembling hands, and the manufactured encouragement of a production assistant who looked about twelve. But she had sung again. And again. Each time, she expected the journey to end, for the polite dismissal that would send her scuttling back to the comforting obscurity of Wokingham and the passive voice. Each time, she had been waved through to the next round. The producers, it seemed, were fascinated by the novelty. \u2018The Prof,\u2019 they\u2019d nicknamed her. They dressed her in sensible, slightly quirky outfits \u2013 a polka-dot tea dress one week, a sharp blazer with a vintage brooch the next. They filmed segments of her in her natural habitat, looking bewildered amongst the library stacks, a stark, academic bird of paradise in a jungle of vapid pop.\n\nNow, she was in the semi-final. The absurdity had reached a fever pitch. Her students were whispering in the corridors, some with awe, some with ill-concealed mirth. The head of her department, Professor Albright, a man whose fossilised heart was rumoured to beat only in iambic pentameter, had cornered her by the staff room kettle. He\u2019d peered at her over his spectacles. \u201cDr. Vance,\u201d he\u2019d said, his voice a dry rustle. \u201cThis\u2026 extracurricular activity. It is not, I hope, distracting you from your marking?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot at all, Professor,\u201d she\u2019d replied, her smile feeling brittle. \u201cI find it\u2026 creatively stimulating.\u201d\n\nA lie. It was creatively, emotionally, and physically draining. It was a monstrous cuckoo in the neat nest of her life. And yet. There was a secret, shameful thrill to it. Standing on that stage, the hot wash of the lights on her face, the wall of sound from the band, the brief, terrifying silence before she began to sing\u2026 in those moments, she wasn't Dr. Vance, the expert on Anglo-Saxon verb conjugations. She was just a voice. A feeling. It was a liberation so profound it felt like a betrayal of her own carefully constructed identity.\n\nHer phone buzzed, dragging her from her reverie. She was sitting in her usual armchair, the one with the worn floral pattern, a cup of rapidly cooling chamomile tea by her side. Rain lashed against the windowpanes of her small Wokingham semi, a typical Tuesday evening. The phone\u2019s screen lit up with a picture of Imogen, grinning maniacally, a stolen traffic cone perched on her head. The photo was five years old, but it was still Ellie\u2019s favourite. She answered.\n\n\u201cDid you watch? Did you see it? You\u2019re a bloody legend, El!\u201d Imogen\u2019s voice was a crackle of static and excitement, a whirlwind tearing through the quiet of the room.\n\n\u201cI was there, Immy,\u201d Ellie said, a smile pulling at her lips despite herself. \u201cI\u2019m fairly sure I remember performing.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, but did you watch it back? The judges\u2019 faces! That Simon Cowell-wannabe, Julian, he looked like he was going to propose. And the other one, Chastity, she actually cried! You made Chastity Diamond cry! People get knighthoods for less.\u201d\n\nEllie sank deeper into her chair. The show had been recorded two days ago, and she\u2019d spent the intervening forty-eight hours in a state of suspended anxiety, trying to teach a seminar on post-colonial literature while half her mind was replaying every flat note, every clumsy bit of stage banter. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t crying, she was\u2026 emoting for the cameras.\u201d\n\n\u201cNonsense. They were real tears. My sister, the giant-slayer. So. The vote\u2019s in an hour. Are you freaking out? You should be freaking out.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m cultivating an aura of academic detachment,\u201d Ellie said primly.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re chewing your thumbnail to the quick, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\n\nEllie glanced at her hand. She was. \u201cMaybe.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook, whatever happens, you\u2019ve done it. You\u2019ve shaken things up. Dad would have been so proud.\u201d The mention of their father, a quiet man who had loved his wife\u2019s loud music, hung in the air between them. He\u2019d passed away five years ago, a sudden, shocking silence in their lives.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019d have been mortified,\u201d Ellie countered, but her voice was thick. \u201cA Vance on a television talent contest? He\u2019d have written a strongly worded letter to The Times.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019d have secretly recorded it every week and watched it when he thought no one was looking,\u201d Imogen said, and Ellie knew she was right. A comfortable silence settled between them, filled only by the crackle of the line and the drumming of the rain. It was Imogen who broke it, her tone shifting, becoming a little too bright, a little too breezy. \u201cAnyway, listen, El. I might be\u2026 out of touch for a bit.\u201d\n\nEllie\u2019s internal alarms, finely tuned by years of Imogen\u2019s chaos, began to chime. \u201cOut of touch? What does that mean? Are you going away?\u201d\n\n\u201cJust for a little while. A trip. You know. Find myself. That sort of rubbish.\u201d\n\n\u201cImmy, where are you going? Is this about that guy, a\u2026 what\u2019s his name? Rik? The one with the questionable neck tattoos?\u201d Ellie sat up, the chamomile tea forgotten. Imogen\u2019s life was a revolving door of unsuitable men and half-baked plans. She was a firework, dazzling and beautiful but always on the verge of exploding. Ellie was the safety inspector, constantly running after her with a bucket of sand.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be a snob, El. Rik\u2019s a visionary. He\u2019s into\u2026 sustainable living. We\u2019re going to a retreat. Off-grid. In Wales, I think.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou *think*? You\u2019re going off-grid to a place you can only vaguely locate with a man who communicates in grunts?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a man of action, not words,\u201d Imogen said defensively. \u201cUnlike some people\u2019s colleagues.\u201d A dig at Ben, Ellie\u2019s fellow linguistics professor, a man so dedicated to the nuances of language that he could spend twenty minutes debating the placement of a comma. \u201cLook, I just wanted to call and say good luck. I won\u2019t be able to watch the results. No signal, you see. Very rustic. But I\u2019ll be thinking of you. Break a leg. But, you know, not literally.\u201d\n\n\u201cImogen, wait\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cGotta go, El! The yurt awaits! Love you!\u201d\n\nThe line went dead. Ellie stared at the phone, a cold knot of dread tightening in her stomach. A yurt. In Wales. With a man named Rik. It was exactly the sort of thing Imogen would do, and it never, ever ended well. The dread was a familiar companion, a dark shadow that her sister\u2019s vibrant light always seemed to cast. She tried to call back. The number went straight to an automated message. *The mobile phone you are calling is switched off. Please try again later.*\n\nShe tried again. And again. The same metallic voice, the same dead end.\n\nThe chiming of the grandfather clock in the hall jolted her. It was nine o\u2019clock. The results show was starting. On the television, a man with teeth too white for nature began to speak, his voice booming with synthetic excitement. *\u201cLast night, six semi-finalists sang their hearts out. But only THREE can make it through to next week\u2019s spectacular Grand Final! The public have been voting\u2026 and the lines are\u2026 CLOSED!\u201d*\n\nEllie barely heard him. She was scrolling through her contacts, her thumb hovering over Ben\u2019s name. He\u2019d understand. Or at least, he\u2019d listen. But what was there to say? \u2018My sister has run off with a tattooed troglodyte to live in a glorified tent\u2019? He\u2019d just raise a skeptical eyebrow and make a dry comment about the etymology of the word \u2018yurt\u2019.\n\nHer attention was snagged by the screen. They were showing a recap of her performance. There she was, a stranger in a teal-coloured dress, her face pale under the lights. The camera zoomed in as she took a breath, her eyes closing. And then the music started, a slow, mournful piano intro to Nina Simone\u2019s \u2018I Put a Spell on You\u2019. She watched herself, a disconnected observer. She saw the tension in her shoulders, the slight tremble in her hands. But then she saw the change as the voice took over. A power she rarely acknowledged filled the screen, raw and aching. It was a voice full of a longing she barely admitted to herself. The performance ended. The studio audience erupted. On screen, the judge, Chastity, dabbed a perfectly mascaraed eye. Maybe Imogen was right.\n\nThe host was holding a golden envelope. \u201cThe first act through to the Grand Final of Britain\u2019s Next Star\u2026 is\u2026\u201d He milked the pause, his grin stretching impossibly wider. Ellie\u2019s heart hammered against her ribs, a frantic, trapped bird. The dread about Imogen warred with the stupid, dazzling hope of the show. It was a sickening cocktail of emotions. She shouldn't care. It was a silly, frivolous thing. Her life was here, in this quiet, book-lined room. Her work was important. This was just\u2026 noise.\n\nBut she did care. She cared with a childish, desperate intensity that shamed her.\n\n\u201cCongratulations\u2026\u201d the host boomed, tearing open the envelope. \u201cYou\u2019re in the final\u2026\u201d\n\nEllie held her breath, her knuckles white as she gripped her phone. The world seemed to shrink to the dimensions of the television screen.\n\n\u201c\u2026THE PROF!\u201d\n\nThe sound from the TV \u2013 the roar of the crowd, the triumphant blast of music \u2013 was deafening, but Ellie barely registered it. Her own living room was utterly silent, save for the frantic beating of her own heart and the incessant, worrying whisper in her mind. *The mobile phone you are calling is switched off.* A wave of dizziness washed over her. She had made it. She was in the final of Britain\u2019s Next Star. And her sister, the one person who had pushed her into this madness, the one person she needed to tell, was gone. The delight, so sharp and dazzling on the television screen, felt distant and muted, a firework exploding miles away. In its place, the cold dread about Imogen bloomed, dark and chilling, wrapping its tendrils around the fragile stem of her victory. She pressed redial, the useless hope flickering. *The mobile phone you are calling is switched off. Please try again later.* She was in the final. And she was completely, utterly alone.The television blared, replaying the moment her name was announced. A camera had been trained on her face in the studio, catching her expression of pure, unadulterated shock. The woman on the screen looked like a stranger, her mouth a perfect 'O' of disbelief before it was subsumed by a shaky, tearful smile. Confetti, shimmering gold and silver, rained down from the ceiling. It was the pinnacle of a fairytale, the climax of the narrative the producers had so carefully crafted. In her quiet living room, Ellie felt none of it. The victory was a hollow echo, the confetti just a mess for someone else to sweep up. Her thumb, raw and sore, pressed the redial button again, an involuntary tic. *The mobile phone you are calling is switched off.*\n\nHer phone, which had been a dead link to her sister, suddenly came alive with a furious, vibrating energy. It buzzed against the worn fabric of the armchair like an angry wasp. The screen became a waterfall of notifications. A WhatsApp group for her department, usually reserved for passive-aggressive reminders about recycling coffee cups, was now a string of exclamation marks and clapping emojis. Emails flooded in, subject lines screaming CONGRATULATIONS!!! from people she hadn\u2019t spoken to in years. It was a digital avalanche of well-wishing, a chorus of voices that knew nothing of yurts, or neck tattoos, or the specific, chilling silence that now occupied the space where her sister's chaotic energy should have been. Each ping felt less like a celebration and more like a stone being thrown against the fragile window of her composure.\n\nBefore she could silence the device, a call came through, the caller ID flashing a London number she recognised from the past few weeks. It was Tamsin, the relentlessly cheerful production assistant. Ellie let it ring four times before answering, the effort of forming a greeting feeling monumental. \u201cHello?\u201d she managed, her voice a reedy whisper.\n\n\u201cEllie! Oh my god, you did it! We\u2019re all screaming here! You are a superstar!\u201d Tamsin\u2019s voice was so high-pitched it threatened to shatter glass. \u201cThe press office is going absolutely mental. We\u2019ve got \u2018Good Morning Britain\u2019 tentatively pencilled in for Thursday, and we need to schedule a costume fitting tomorrow afternoon. And we need to talk song choices for the final! The theme is \u2018Winner\u2019s Anthem\u2019! We\u2019re thinking something huge, something epic! Maybe a bit of Adele? Or something classic like \u2018My Way\u2019? What says \u2018I am The Prof and hear me roar\u2019 to you?\u201d\n\nThe questions pummelled her, a barrage of absurd, trivial details. Winner\u2019s Anthem. Costume fitting. She felt a hysterical laugh bubbling in her chest and ruthlessly suppressed it. \u201cTamsin, I\u2026 thank you. I\u2019m just a little overwhelmed right now.\u201d It was the truth, but not the version Tamsin would understand. \u201cCan we\u2026 can we talk about this tomorrow?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course, of course! You soak it all in! Champagne, I hope? We\u2019ve sent a bottle round to your hotel, by the way. Oh, wait, you went home, didn\u2019t you? Silly me. Well, drink something bubbly anyway! You\u2019ve earned it! Talk tomorrow, star!\u201d The line clicked dead, leaving Ellie in a silence that felt more profound than before. The cuckoo hadn\u2019t just taken over the nest; it was redecorating.\n\nShe threw the phone onto the opposite sofa cushion as if it were contaminated. The anxiety about Imogen, temporarily pushed aside by the phone\u2019s assault, returned with a vengeance, sharp and sickening. For a moment, she was paralysed by the sheer uselessness of her situation. She was a finalist in the country's biggest talent show, yet she couldn't even find her own sister. What good was a voice that could make a nation vote if it couldn\u2019t even get a response from the one person she needed to hear? She mentally scanned a map of Wales, a vast, green, unknowable space. Where would someone even put an off-grid yurt retreat? How would she even start to look? The problem was too big, too nebulous, and her own world of footnotes and historical precedents offered no guide.\n\nHer gaze fell back to the phone. She needed an anchor. She needed a voice that spoke her language. Scrolling past the endless stream of new contacts with job titles like \u2018Publicist\u2019 and \u2018Show Runner\u2019, her thumb found a familiar, unassuming name: *Ben Carter*. Her prediction from earlier echoed in her mind \u2013 the skeptical eyebrow, the dry comment on etymology. But Ben was also logical. He was precise. He solved problems for a living, albeit problems that were usually several centuries old. More than that, he was steady. While her life had become a tempest, Ben was solid ground. Taking a shuddering breath, she pressed the call button. It rang once, twice, a lifeline cast into the dark.\n\n\u201cVance?\u201d His voice was exactly as she\u2019d imagined: calm, a little quizzical, blessedly free of manufactured excitement. There was the sound of a page turning in the background. Of course. \u201cI assume my television has not developed a fault and I did just see you on it. Congratulations are in order, I suppose. Though it does rather throw my theory that the public has no taste whatsoever into disarray.\u201d\n\nThe dry, academic humour was so familiar it almost made her weep with relief. It was a fragment of her real life, her proper life. All the prepared sentences, the attempts to sound normal, evaporated. The carefully constructed dam of Dr. Eleanor Vance finally broke.\n\n\u201cBen,\u201d she said, and her voice cracked, betraying the full weight of her panic. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to call so late. It\u2019s not about the show. It\u2019s Imogen. She\u2019s gone.\u201dThere was a beat of profound silence on the other end of the line, a quiet so complete that Ellie could hear the faint, electrical hum of the connection itself. The imagined sound of a turning page ceased. When Ben spoke again, the dry, academic irony was gone, replaced by a focused calm that was infinitely more comforting. \u201cGone? Vance, what do you mean, gone?\u201d\n\nThe words tumbled out of her, a disorderly, panicked jumble that defied all the syntactical rules she held so dear. She told him about the phone call, the breezy, too-bright tone in Imogen\u2019s voice, the mention of a man named Rik with his questionable tattoos and his vision of sustainable living. The details, which had been merely alarming when rattling inside her own head, sounded utterly insane when spoken aloud to Ben Carter. \u201cA yurt, Ben. She\u2019s gone to live in a yurt. In Wales, she *thinks*. With a man she\u2019s known for what must be a matter of weeks. And her phone is off. She said she\u2019d be out of touch.\u201d The last sentence came out as a whisper of pure dread.\n\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Ben\u2019s voice was a low, steady anchor in the storm of her anxiety. \u201cOkay, Ellie, slow down. Just breathe for a moment.\u201d He called her Ellie, something he rarely did, and the small shift in formality was like a hand on her shoulder. \u201cLet\u2019s be systematic. What, precisely, do we know? His name is Rik. Do you know how he spells it? Any surname?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, just Rik. R-I-K, I assume. Imogen mentioned he was a man of action, not words, which I\u2019ve translated as \u2018illiterate\u2019.\u201d The flash of her usual wit felt brittle, a reflex action that offered no comfort. \u201cI don\u2019t know anything else. He\u2019s a visionary, apparently. A visionary who lures women to collapsible tents in undisclosed locations.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight.\u201d There was a new sound on the line, the soft, rapid clatter of a keyboard. Ben was at his computer. The sound was purposeful, logical. It was the sound of a problem being approached, not surrendered to. \u201cOkay, \u2018Imogen Vance\u2019 and \u2018Rik\u2019. Not a likely search combination. How about \u2018Off-grid yurt retreat Wales\u2019? Let\u2019s see.\u201d Ellie could picture him, leaning forward in his desk chair, his brow furrowed in concentration, applying the same forensic intensity to this modern-day chaos as he would to a disputed Anglo-Saxon manuscript. There was a pause. \u201cUnsurprisingly, that yields\u2026 a lot. It seems going off-grid is a remarkably popular and well-advertised enterprise. It\u2019s a paradox.\u201d\n\nWhile he typed, Ellie\u2019s phone, still lying on the sofa cushion, lit up with a news alert from a major media outlet. The headline was stark against the small screen: *\u2018The Prof\u2019 Sings Her Way To The Final! Shock Favourite Stuns The Judges*. Below it was the photo of her on stage, mid-song, her face a mask of raw emotion. The disconnect was dizzying. Here she was, repackaged as a heart-warming national story, a narrative of hidden talents and second chances. Meanwhile, in the quiet of her own life, a real and terrifying story was unfolding, one with no uplifting soundtrack or slow-motion recap. She felt like a character in two different books at the same time, and she was losing the plot in both.\n\n\u201cDoes your sister have any social media presence?\u201d Ben asked, his voice cutting through her spiralling thoughts. \u201cA Facebook profile? Instagram? She\u2019s a millennial, it\u2019s practically a given.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe is, but she\u2019s\u2026 erratic with it,\u201d Ellie said, forcing herself to focus. \u201cShe\u2019ll post a hundred photos in a week and then disappear for six months. I\u2019ll look.\u201d With trembling fingers, she picked up her phone and navigated to Imogen\u2019s Instagram page. It was a chaotic collage of her life: blurry photos from nights out, artistic shots of her shadow, a picture of a half-eaten plate of chips captioned \u2018Carbicide\u2019. It was so perfectly Imogen that a fresh wave of panic hit Ellie. This was a digital ghost. She scrolled down, her heart thumping, looking for any clue, any tag, any mention of a Rik or a trip to Wales. There was nothing recent. Nothing at all.\n\n\u201cWait,\u201d Ben said suddenly. \u201cI\u2019m on her Facebook. It\u2019s mostly public. She added a new friend three days ago. I\u2019m sending you a screenshot.\u201d Ellie\u2019s phone pinged. She opened the image. It was a profile picture of a man with a shaved head, a thick beard, and a dizzying array of tattoos that crept up from his collar and onto his neck. He was squinting into the sun, a look of profound intensity on his face. The name below the picture read: *Rik \u2018The Root\u2019 Jones*.\n\n\u201c\u2018The Root\u2019?\u201d The name dropped into the silent room with a dead thud. It was so perfectly, dreadfully absurd that Ellie didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry. Ben\u2019s voice was deadpan. \u201cIndeed. A nom de guerre, one presumes. His profile is\u2026 sparse. Lots of pictures of sunsets and mud. A few maxims about \u2018reconnecting with Gaia\u2019 and \u2018unplugging from the matrix\u2019. No location tags, of course. That would defeat the purpose.\u201d\n\nShe stared at the face of Rik \u2018The Root\u2019 Jones, the visionary who had her sister. He didn\u2019t look like a monster. He just looked like a man trying very, very hard to be something he wasn\u2019t, a clich\u00e9 ripped from a brochure about spiritual awakening. And that was almost more frightening. Monsters were easy to understand; deluded idealists were unpredictable. They believed their own press.\n\n\u201cSo what do we do?\u201d Ellie asked, her voice small. The task felt just as impossible as it had ten minutes ago, but the panic had receded slightly, replaced by a cold, sharp-edged resolve.\n\n\u201cFor now, you do nothing,\u201d Ben said, his tone firm. \u201cYou have a television appearance on Thursday, apparently. You need to sleep. I will spend some time cross-referencing Mr. Jones\u2019s friends list with businesses advertising yurt-based spiritual journeys in the greater Welsh area. It\u2019s a long shot, but it\u2019s a data-processing problem. And I\u2019m good at those.\u201d\n\nThe offer was so simple, so practical, so completely Ben. He would trawl the internet for her. He would sit in his quiet, orderly study and search for her chaotic, wandering sister. The relief was so immense it almost buckled her. She wasn\u2019t alone with this anymore. \u201cBen, I\u2026 thank you. I don\u2019t know what to say.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t say anything, Vance,\u201d he replied, the return to her surname a comforting signal that the crisis was now a managed project. \u201cJust try and rest. We\u2019ll speak in the morning.\u201d\n\nAfter they hung up, Ellie sat in the stillness for a long time. The house was quiet again, the only sounds the ticking of the clock and the drumming of the rain. She looked from the screenshot of the intense, bearded face of Rik the Root to the glowing news alert celebrating her unlikely triumph. One was the messy, terrifying truth of her life; the other was the beautiful, simple lie the world wanted to believe. And tomorrow, she would have to wake up and perform the lie, all while the truth was lost somewhere in a field in Wales, sleeping in a yurt.### Chapter 2\n\nSleep, when it finally came, was a shallow, fitful thing, populated by dreams of dusty manuscripts turning into television contracts and Simon Cowell-wannabes demanding she conjugate irregular verbs. Ellie awoke with a gasp to a grey, washed-out morning. The rain had ceased, leaving behind a world that looked damp and desaturated. For a single, blissful second, she didn't remember. She was just Dr. Vance, in her own bed, on a Wednesday morning with a seminar to prepare. Then the twin weights of the last twenty-four hours dropped back into place. She was a finalist. Her sister was missing. The two facts felt so grotesquely mismatched, so fundamentally incompatible, that her mind struggled to hold them both at once. Her phone lay on the bedside table where she had left it, a sleeping viper. She stared at it, her heart beginning its familiar, anxious thrum against her ribs.\n\nBefore she could work up the courage to check for a message from Ben, the viper sprang to life. The screen lit up with Tamsin\u2019s name, her cheerfulness somehow radiating through the very pixels. Ellie answered with a sense of grim inevitability. \u201cGood morning, superstar!\u201d The voice was a jolt of caffeine she didn\u2019t want. \u201cHope you\u2019re bright-eyed and bushy-tailed! It\u2019s a huge day! We\u2019ve got a car picking you up at eleven to bring you to London. We\u2019ll start with a quick debrief, then it\u2019s straight into costume with the style team at one. After that, vocal coaching with Melody, and then a big old strategy meeting at four-thirty to brainstorm your Winner\u2019s Anthem. It\u2019s going to be epic!\u201d\n\nThe schedule was a precision-tooled assault on her day, a high-speed train she was expected to board without question. Each item on the list \u2013 costume, coaching, strategy \u2013 felt like a prop in a play she no longer had any interest in performing. An image of Imogen, cold and lost in a Welsh field, flashed through her mind. \u201cYes,\u201d she heard herself say, her voice sounding unnervingly normal. \u201cOf course. Eleven o\u2019clock. I\u2019ll be ready.\u201d It was the first lie of the day, but she had a sinking feeling it would not be the last. Her life was now a matter of performing, both on and off the stage.\n\nShe hung up and immediately dialled Ben\u2019s number. He answered on the first ring, his voice thick with fatigue. \u201cVance.\u201d \u201cBen. Did you\u2026 find anything?\u201d she asked, skipping all pleasantries. There was a rustle of papers, the sound of a man who had not been to bed. \u201cPotentially. I spent the night in the less salubrious corners of the internet. Our Mr. \u2018The Root\u2019 Jones is careful, but he\u2019s also arrogant. He wants to be a guru, and a guru needs a following, even a digital one.\u201d Ben paused, and Ellie heard him take a sip of what was undoubtedly brutally strong coffee. \u201cHe had an old blog. \u2018The Earth-Pulse\u2019. Mostly unreadable poetry about mycelial networks. But, in a post from two years ago, he talks about his \u2018awakening\u2019 under the guidance of a mentor, a man he calls \u2018Brother Sol\u2019.\u201d\n\nEllie\u2019s knuckles were white where she gripped the phone. \u201cBrother Sol?\u201d she repeated, the name tasting like snake oil on her tongue. \u201cAnd does Brother Sol have a real name? An address?\u201d \u201cNo. That would be far too simple. But he is mentioned on a few obscure forums dedicated to alternative lifestyles. He\u2019s said to run a community called \u2018Gwawr Newydd\u2019 \u2013 it\u2019s Welsh for \u2018New Dawn\u2019. They\u2019re strictly anti-technology, completely off-grid. There\u2019s no website, no phone number. But the general consensus is that it\u2019s located somewhere deep in the Brecon Beacons.\u201d\n\nThe Brecon Beacons. A vast, mountainous national park. It was a concrete location, yet it was so large as to be almost meaningless. A needle in a haystack the size of a county. Still, it was a start. A direction. \u201cThank you, Ben,\u201d she said, her voice thick with genuine gratitude. \u201cReally. I owe you.\u201d \u201cJust try not to get yourself into a situation that requires a formal rescue operation, Vance,\u201d he said, a hint of the old dryness returning. \u201cAnd for goodness\u2019 sake, win the bloody thing. It\u2019ll make a better story.\u201d\n\nHer nine a.m. seminar on the sociolinguistics of the Great Vowel Shift seemed like a dispatch from another dimension. How could she possibly stand in front of twenty bright, earnest students and discuss the phonological restructuring of Early Modern English when her own world was deconstructing in real time? She couldn\u2019t. Sitting at her laptop, she typed a brief, formal email to Professor Albright, citing a \u201csevere and unforeseen domestic emergency\u201d that required her immediate attention. It was the truth, stretched and reshaped to fit the contours of professional acceptability. She pressed send before she could change her mind, the action feeling like a small, decisive snip of one of the many threads that tied her to her old life.\n\nHer plan required cash, a road atlas, and a full tank of petrol. The polite Saturday market was in full swing, and Wokingham was out in force, buying artisan cheese and organic vegetables. The anonymity she had always cherished here was gone. \u201cIt\u2019s you!\u201d a woman by the bread stall exclaimed, her voice loud enough to turn heads. \u201cThe Prof! Oh, you have to win! My mother and I are voting for you every week!\u201d Before Ellie could formulate a reply, the woman\u2019s phone was out. \u201cCould we just get a quick photo?\u201d Ellie found herself smiling, a rictus grin of pure panic, as the woman snapped a selfie. The flash felt like an accusation. The photo would show a happy, confident finalist enjoying her newfound fame. It was a perfect, beautiful lie. The encounter left her feeling scraped out and fraudulent, a hollow chocolate Easter egg in a human shell.\n\nBack in the quiet of her house, the two futures laid themselves out before her. One path led east, to a waiting car, to London, to costume fittings and television studios and a chance at a career so bizarrely brilliant she could scarcely comprehend it. The other path led west, into her own ageing hatchback, towards the mountains and the rain and the terrifying unknown. It wasn\u2019t really a choice. The carefully curated world of Dr. Eleanor Vance had been an identity built on caution and quiet intellect. But that person had sung Etta James to a phone propped against a Chaucer translation. That person had already stepped off the path. Her real, non-negotiable duty was not to a panel of judges, but to a wild-haired sister who had dared her to sing in the first place.\n\nHer phone rang again, Tamsin\u2019s name flashing with insistent brightness. It was ten-fifty. The car would be outside. Ellie took a deep, steadying breath, marshalling all the performative skills she had unwittingly acquired over the past few weeks. \u201cTamsin, hi,\u201d she began, injecting a note of pure, theatrical panic into her voice. \u201cIt\u2019s a disaster. An absolute catastrophe. A pipe\u2019s burst in the upstairs bathroom. There\u2019s water coming through the ceiling of my study. It\u2019s pouring all over the books! I can\u2019t possibly leave!\u201d She threw in a few choice details \u2013 a panicked call to a plumber, the threat to her first-edition copy of *Piers Plowman* \u2013 creating a fiction so vivid she almost believed it herself.\n\n\u201cOh, Ellie, you poor thing! That\u2019s awful!\u201d Tamsin\u2019s sympathy was immediate and absolute. The world of television dealt in high drama; a domestic flood was a narrative it could understand. \u201cDon\u2019t you worry about a thing. We\u2019ll rearrange. Just save the books! Let me know when the crisis is averted and you can get a train down. The team sends their love!\u201d\n\nEllie hung up the phone, the silence of her perfectly dry house ringing in her ears. The lie, audacious and complete, had worked. She looked at her leather satchel, a vessel that had only ever known lecture notes and red biros. She emptied it out on the floral armchair, the familiar scent of old paper and chalk dust rising from the worn leather. In place of the books, she packed the atlas, a heavy-duty torch, a protein bar, and a portable phone charger. She pulled on a practical pair of boots and her oldest waterproof jacket, a far cry from the quirky tea dresses chosen by the show's stylists. As she locked the front door behind her, she glanced down the tidy brick street. There was no limousine waiting. There was only her ten-year-old Ford Focus. The scene was made. And this time, it was all hers.### Chapter 3\n\nThe Ford Focus felt alien after weeks of being ferried around in blacked-out cars with drivers who called her \u201cma\u2019am\u201d. Here, there was no air-conditioned hush, only the familiar hum of the engine and the squeak of a windscreen wiper she\u2019d been meaning to get fixed for six months. Driving away from Wokingham was like pulling a thread on a perfectly knitted jumper; with every mile that passed, she felt her carefully constructed life unravelling behind her. The neat hedges and polite roundabouts gave way to the brutalist concrete of the M4 corridor, a ribbon of grey tarmac pulling her relentlessly west. Her world had shrunk to the confines of the car, a metal and glass capsule hurtling towards an unknown. The notifications on her phone had fallen silent, her single lie having bought her a temporary, fragile peace. But the silence in the car was louder, filled with the ghost of Imogen\u2019s breezy sign-off and the imagined, bearded face of Rik \u2018The Root\u2019 Jones.\n\nAs she crossed the Severn Bridge, a great iron harp humming in the wind, England fell away behind her. The road signs became bilingual, the soft, lyrical mutations of Welsh appearing above the familiar English. It was a language she understood purely on a theoretical level, a subject of academic papers on linguistic drift and Celtic revivalism. Seeing it now, on a green sign pointing towards Cas-gwent, it felt tangible and foreign, a clear marker that she had passed through a boundary into a place where her own rules no longer applied. The landscape began to swell and darken, the gentle, rolling hills of the home counties replaced by dramatic, cloud-shadowed escarpments. This was a land that did not care for syntactical evolution or television ratings. It was ancient and indifferent, and she felt her own significance shrink with every mile.\n\nThe absurdity of her situation was a constant, low-grade fever. Hours ago, she had been \u2018The Prof,\u2019 a national curiosity, a walking, singing Cinderella story. Now she was a lone woman in a ten-year-old hatchback, armed with a road atlas and the name of a pseudo-mystic called Brother Sol. What would Tamsin, with her clipboard and her talk of \u2018Winner\u2019s Anthems\u2019, make of this? What would Professor Albright, who considered a trip to the Bodleian Library a wild adventure, say about his star lecturer chasing a rumour into the Welsh mountains? She felt a sharp, painful pang of anger at Imogen, hot and quick, for her spectacular, life-derailing foolishness. It was always like this. Imogen would light the fuse, and Ellie would be the one left to deal with the explosion. The anger was swiftly extinguished by a cold wave of fear. This was not a broken-down car or a forgotten rent payment. This felt different. This felt dangerous.\n\nBy mid-afternoon, she had reached the edge of the Brecon Beacons. She pulled off the main road into a small town nestled in a valley, a cluster of grey stone houses huddled together against the vast, empty green of the surrounding fells. Aberglynn. A pub, The Dragon\u2019s Head, stood on the corner of the small market square, a plume of woodsmoke curling from its chimney. It looked like the kind of place where time moved slowly, and secrets were kept. Her life in Wokingham had taught her the value of blending in, of observing from the sidelines. Here, she felt as conspicuous as a flamingo in a flock of sheep. Her London-centric, slightly quirky academic style had been stripped away, leaving her in jeans and a waterproof jacket, a costume that felt just as inauthentic.\n\nInside, the pub was dark and warm, smelling of damp wool, beer, and frying onions. A few old men sat nursing pints at a corner table, their conversation, conducted in the low music of Welsh-inflected English, stopping the moment she walked in. They watched her over their glasses as she approached the bar. The man behind the counter was built like a prop forward, with a florid face and hands that could palm a barrel. Ellie\u2019s heart hammered against her ribs. She was a linguist, a master of nuance and subtext, but the direct, unadorned question she needed to ask felt like a boulder on her tongue. She ordered a lemonade, her voice sounding unnaturally high in the quiet room.\n\nAfter taking a sip of the sweet, fizzy drink, she forced herself to speak. \u201cExcuse me,\u201d she began, her tone a careful mixture of lost tourist and casual enquirer. \u201cI was wondering if you might be able to help me. I\u2019m trying to find some friends. They said they were staying at a sort of retreat nearby, a place called\u2026 Gwawr Newydd?\u201d She let the Welsh name hang in the air, hoping her pronunciation, honed by phonetic charts rather than conversation, wasn\u2019t too jarringly awful. The bartender paused in the act of polishing a glass, his expression unreadable. He looked at her, then at the old men in the corner, a silent communication passing between them. \u201cCan\u2019t say I\u2019ve heard of it,\u201d he said, his voice a flat, unwelcoming rumble. He turned his back to her and resumed his polishing with a pointed finality.\n\nThe dismissal was absolute. A wall had come down, and she was on the wrong side of it. Dejected, she was about to turn and leave when one of the old men at the table cleared his throat. He was wiry and weathered, his face a roadmap of wrinkles, his eyes a sharp, startling blue. \u201cNew Dawn,\u201d he said, his voice a dry rustle, like autumn leaves. \u201cThat\u2019s what they call it in English, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Ellie turned towards him, her heart giving a hopeful leap. \u201cYes. That\u2019s it. Do you know where it is?\u201d The man took a long, slow sip of his pint, his bright eyes appraising her from head to foot. \u201cNot for visitors, that place,\u201d he said slowly. \u201cThey like to be left alone. Came here a few years back. Bought the old sheep farm up on Mynydd Du, the Black Mountain. The one that failed.\u201d\n\nHe gestured vaguely with his chin towards the window, towards the brooding mass of the mountain that dominated the skyline. \u201cYou\u2019ll not find it on a map. You take the road up towards the reservoir. Past the cattle grid, there\u2019s a track breaks off to the left, by a pair of old standing stones. Can\u2019t miss them. But the track\u2019s not fit for a car like that.\u201d He gave her Ford a dismissive glance through the window. \u201cAnd they don\u2019t take kindly to folk just turning up. Especially not\u2026 well-dressed folk from off.\u201d The way he said \u2018off\u2019 made it sound like another country, a place of noise and trouble. He turned back to his companions, the audience over. She had her information. It was more than she had hoped for, but it came with a clear, unspoken warning. Ellie left her lemonade on the bar, the fizz and the falseness of it suddenly unbearable. Outside, the air was cold and sharp. The sun was beginning its descent, painting the undersides of the clouds in shades of bruised purple and orange. She got back in her car and spread the rumpled road atlas across the passenger seat. The Black Mountain. The Reservoir. The standing stones. It was a treasure map to a place that did not want to be found. The urgency to find Imogen warred with the old man\u2019s warning. For a moment, she hesitated. Then she thought of her sister, vibrant and reckless and alone, and the choice was gone. She started the engine, pulling out of the square and onto the narrow road that wound its way up, and up, into the rising darkness of the mountain.The road narrowed almost immediately, the thin ribbon of tarmac clinging to the side of the mountain like a stubborn weed. The Ford\u2019s engine, accustomed to the flat civility of the Thames Valley, whined in a low gear as the incline steepened. To her left, the ground fell away into a deep, bracken-choked valley where shadows were already pooling like black ink. To her right, the mountain rose up, a sheer wall of rock and coarse grass. She was no longer in a landscape designed for human convenience. This was a place of older, harsher rules, and her car felt like a fragile, anachronistic toy. The setting sun had lit the horizon on fire, but the flames were dying, leaving behind the cold embers of a purple and grey twilight. The world was losing its colour, and with it, her confidence was leaching away into the vast, indifferent emptiness.\n\nShe almost missed them. In the deepening gloom, they were just two darker shapes against the dark hillside. But a flicker of her headlights caught the lichen-spotted granite, and she slammed on the brakes, the car skidding slightly on the damp road. The standing stones. They were exactly as the old man had described, planted on either side of a muddy track that broke away from the road and vanished into the darkness above. They were not picturesque. They were brutal and immense, ancient teeth jutting from the gums of the earth, silent sentinels guarding a path to nowhere. Ellie switched off the engine, and the sudden, profound silence was terrifying. There was no hum of traffic, no distant siren, only the low moan of the wind rushing through the tall grasses. This was the threshold.\n\nShe got out of the car, and the wind hit her like a physical blow, cold and smelling of rain and damp earth. She looked at the track. It was less a path and more a channel carved by water and the occasional tractor, a treacherous morass of deep, muddy ruts and slick stones. The old man was right; her Focus wouldn't make it twenty yards. For a long, heart-stopping moment, she stood frozen between the two worlds. She looked back down the winding road, a faint, silvery line disappearing into the encroaching night. Down there was safety, reason, a world where pipes burst and TV shows had finals. And then she looked up the track, into the utter blackness where her sister might be. There was no real choice to be made. Taking a deep breath that felt thin and useless in her lungs, she reached into the car, grabbed her leather satchel, and locked the door. The electronic chirp of the central locking sounded absurdly out of place, a final, futile protest from the 21st century.\n\nThe first few steps were a shock. The mud was a living thing, cold and greedy, sucking at her boots and threatening to pull her down with every step. Her body, conditioned by years of pacing lecture theatres and navigating library aisles, protested immediately. A sharp burn ignited in her calves, and her breath came in ragged, misty puffs in the cold air. The comfortable, intellectual detachment of Dr. Vance was useless here. That woman could deconstruct a text, but she had no idea how to read a landscape like this, how to place her feet to avoid the worst of the mire. Here, she was clumsy, weak, and completely out of her element. She was just Ellie, stumbling through the dark, propelled only by a stubborn, terrified love for her sister.\n\nWith the last of the light gone, the world became a terrifying realm of sound and shadow. The wind howled around the tors, carrying with it the mournful cry of a distant sheep. Every rustle in the gorse beside the track sounded like a footstep, every shadow looked like a watching figure. Her phone, a dead weight in her pocket, was no comfort. She was utterly disconnected, a single, struggling point of life in a vast, empty wilderness. The anger at Imogen returned, but this time it was different, a desperate, hollow ache. How could she have chosen this? This bleak emptiness, this man with a nickname, over everything else? Over her? The thought was a shard of ice in her gut, but she pushed it down, focusing only on the next step, and the next, her progress a slow, painful crawl into the heart of the mountain.\n\nShe had been walking for what felt like hours, a mindless rhythm of step and slide, when she saw it. Cresting a small rise, her legs trembling with exhaustion, she stopped dead. Below her, nestled in a shallow, sheltered bowl of the mountain, was a small cluster of pale, round shapes. Yurts. Five of them, arranged in a rough circle around a larger central structure from which a thin tendril of woodsmoke coiled into the star-dusted sky. A few were dimly illuminated from within, the canvas glowing with the soft, flickering light of lamps or candles. They looked like a colony of strange fungi, alien and unsettling against the ancient blackness of the mountain. There was no sound, no movement. It was a picture of absolute stillness, but it was a watchful, unnerving stillness. She had found Gwawr Newydd. She had arrived at the edge of her sister's new world, and it looked more frightening than she could ever have imagined.### Chapter 4\n\nFor a long time, she just stood there on the ridge, a cold, wind-lashed ghost looking down on the land of the living dead. The glowing yurts exerted a strange, hypnotic pull, a promise of warmth and light in the crushing dark, but it was a siren\u2019s call. This was not a sanctuary; it was a trap. Her academic mind, trained to dissect and categorise, tried to find a framework for it. A subculture. A social experiment. A cult. The last word landed and stuck, cold and hard. Her exhaustion was a heavy cloak, but the adrenaline of fear was a sharp pin pricking her awake. She couldn't storm in. She had no authority here, no power. She was an intruder, a contamination from the world they had so deliberately escaped. Her only advantage was the darkness. Holding her breath, she began to pick her way down the slick, grassy slope, moving from one patch of deeper shadow to the next, her footsteps silent on the damp turf.\n\nAs she drew closer, the eerie stillness was broken by a low, rhythmic sound emanating from the largest, central yurt. It wasn't music, not exactly. It was a single, deep, resonant hum, a human drone that seemed to vibrate in the very soil beneath her feet. The sound was hypnotic and deeply unsettling, the vocal equivalent of a flickering gaslight. She crept to the edge of the circle of yurts, crouching behind a low gorse bush that tore at her jacket. From here, she could see the entrance to the main structure, its canvas flap tied back. The interior was lit by dozens of candles, their light casting long, dancing shadows. She could make out figures sitting on the floor in a circle, their heads bowed, their bodies swaying slightly in time with the unending hum. She scanned the shapes, her heart pounding, searching for the familiar, chaotic silhouette of her sister. But the figures were anonymous, their identities lost to the shadows and the collective sound.\n\nA canvas flap on one of the smaller yurts to her right was suddenly thrown back, spilling a slice of warm, yellow lantern light onto the muddy ground. A man stepped out, and Ellie instinctively shrank further into the bush, her breath catching in her throat. Even in the gloom, she recognised him from the screenshot. The shaved head, the thick beard, the tattoos coiling up his neck like dark ivy. Rik \u2018The Root\u2019 Jones. He stretched, his back arching, every movement imbued with a self-conscious, cat-like deliberation. He looked up at the sky, breathing in the night air with a theatrical profundity, a man performing the role of being one with nature. Then he froze. His head tilted, his gaze sweeping the darkness beyond the circle of light. Ellie\u2019s heart stopped. He hadn\u2019t seen her, not yet, but he had sensed something. A shift in the air. A foreign presence. He took a slow, deliberate step out of the light, his eyes adjusting, scanning the perimeter.\n\n\"The world sends its little spies, even to the last free places on earth,\" he said, his voice a low, conversational growl directed at the darkness. He wasn't shouting, but the sound carried with unnerving clarity on the wind. \"Come out. You are trespassing on sacred ground.\" Ellie remained frozen, her mind racing. To run was to be hunted. To stay was to be found. She was caught. Taking a shuddering breath that felt like she was inhaling ice, she slowly, deliberately, stood up. Her legs were trembling so violently she was surprised she could stand at all. As she stepped out of the shadow of the gorse bush, Rik\u2019s eyes locked onto hers. There was no surprise in his expression, only a kind of weary, patronising confirmation. \"Ah,\" he said, as if identifying a common garden pest. \"The Professor. Imogen told me you'd have trouble letting go.\"\n\nHis condescension was a lit match on the dry tinder of her fear and fury. \"Where is she?\" Ellie demanded, her voice hard, stripped of all academic politeness. \"I want to see my sister.\" Rik smiled, a slow, infuriatingly serene spreading of his lips. \"Imogen is not a possession to be seen on demand. She is on a journey. She is cleansing. She is shedding the skin of the toxic world you represent. Your world of stress, and noise, and\u2026 chalk dust.\" He said the last two words as if they were a terminal diagnosis, a detail Imogen had clearly shared. \"You can't just come here, with your frantic energy, and disrupt her healing.\" \"Her healing?\" Ellie took a step forward, her fists clenched. \"She's been here a few days! She's not healing, she's hiding. You've brought her to the middle of nowhere and cut her off from everyone!\"\n\n\"I brought her nowhere. She chose to come. She chose peace,\" another voice said, and Ellie spun around. The droning from the central yurt had stopped. Imogen was standing in the entrance, a silhouette against the candlelight. As she walked forward into the lantern light, Ellie\u2019s breath caught in her throat. It was Imogen, but it wasn't. Her wild, flyaway hair was tied back in a neat braid. Her usual uniform of band t-shirts and ripped jeans was gone, replaced by simple, loose-fitting cream trousers and a tunic. Her face, scrubbed clean of make-up, was pale and calm, and her eyes, which usually crackled with manic energy, were placid and still. It was the stillness that terrified Ellie most of all. \"What are you doing here, El?\" Imogen asked, her voice lacking its usual warmth. It was flat, weary, as if Ellie's arrival was not a rescue, but a tedious and predictable complication.\n\n\"What am I doing here? Immy, I've been out of my mind! I drove for hours, I walked up a mountain in the dark! I thought\u2026 I thought something terrible had happened!\" Ellie\u2019s voice cracked with a mixture of relief and hurt. \"Something has happened, El,\" Imogen replied, her gaze unwavering. \"For the first time in my life, I'm happy. I'm calm. I can breathe here.\" She gestured to the vast, empty darkness around them. \"There's no pressure. No expectations. There's just\u2026 this.\" She looked at Rik, a small, beatific smile on her face. \"Rik and Brother Sol, they understand.\" Ellie stared at her, at the serene stranger wearing her sister\u2019s face. \"Imogen, this isn't you. A yurt? A man who calls himself 'The Root'? This is another one of your projects, another phase. But this one is dangerous. These people are cutting you off.\" \"You mean cutting me off from you?\" Imogen shot back, a flicker of the old fire showing through. \"From you calling me every five minutes to check I haven't messed up again? From you looking at me with that worried, disappointed expression? I love you, Ellie, but your love is heavy. It's an anchor. This,\" she said, her voice softening again, \"this is learning to fly.\"\n\nThe insult, that her love was a burden, struck Ellie with the force of a physical blow. All the worry, the sleepless nights, the constant, low-level anxiety she had carried for Imogen her whole life, was being thrown back in her face as a fault. As the sisters stood locked in a painful stalemate, another figure emerged from the central yurt. He was an older man, perhaps in his late sixties, with a mane of long, silver hair and a neatly trimmed beard. He wore a simple, dark-blue robe, and his eyes, as he surveyed the scene, were intelligent and disconcertingly calm. He exuded an aura of quiet, unshakeable authority that made Rik\u2019s posturing look childish. \"It seems our sanctuary has a visitor,\" he said, his voice a rich, soothing baritone. \"Eleanor, is it? Imogen has told us so much about you. I am Brother Sol. Welcome to Gwawr Newydd.\" He smiled, a warm, paternal smile that didn\u2019t reach his watchful eyes. \"You have come a long way. You must be tired and cold. Please, come inside. Join us.\"\n\nThe invitation was smooth as silk, and as strong as a steel chain. It was not a request. Ellie looked from the charismatic leader to the blank, placid face of her sister. She looked at the circle of dark yurts and the endless, crushing blackness of the mountain beyond. She had found Imogen, but she had lost her completely. She was an uninvited guest, a party of one in a hostile land, and they were asking her to come inside. She had no car to escape in, no signal to call for help, and no way of forcing a person to be rescued when they believed they were already saved. She was utterly, terrifyingly trapped.The word \u2018welcome\u2019 had never sounded so much like a threat. Brother Sol\u2019s voice was a rich, practiced instrument, tuned to the frequency of persuasion. To refuse his invitation was to declare war, a war she was equipped to fight with semantic arguments but not with boots mired in Welsh mud. To accept was to walk into the belly of the beast. With the hollow eyes of her sister on her and the smug certainty of Rik Jones at her back, Ellie understood that she had run out of road. She gave a single, sharp nod, a gesture of capitulation that cost her a mountain of pride. She was no longer Dr. Vance, expert and authority. She was a supplicant, a problem to be managed.\n\nBrother Sol smiled, a slow, beatific expression of triumph, and gestured for her to precede him. As she stepped over the threshold of the large yurt, the change in atmosphere was dizzying. The raw, howling wind was replaced by a close, encompassing warmth that smelled of woodsmoke, beeswax, and something else, a sweet, cloying herbal scent like boiled nettles. The single, hypnotic drone had fractured back into individual human beings, about a dozen of them, who now sat on threadbare cushions and sheepskins arranged around a pot-bellied stove that glowed a cheerful, malevolent red. They looked up as she entered, their faces, illuminated by the flickering dance of candlelight, uniformly placid. They were young, mostly, with the earnest, searching eyes of people who had traded one set of certainties for another. Imogen drifted away from her side without a word, sinking gracefully onto a cushion between a young man with a wispy beard and a woman with vacant, staring eyes. She had been reabsorbed into the group, leaving Ellie standing alone and exposed in the centre of the circle, a stark, foreign object.\n\n\"Please,\" Brother Sol\u2019s voice was a soft murmur behind her. He guided her to an empty cushion opposite Imogen, the light pressure of his hand on her back both a courtesy and a command. \"You must forgive our humble surroundings. We value simplicity.\" Ellie sat, her exhausted muscles screaming in protest. The cushion was lumpy, and the proximity to the stove made her face feel flushed and hot. She felt like an exhibit in a zoo, the specimen of a frantic, over-complicated species, brought in for the calm inhabitants to observe. Rik settled himself beside Brother Sol, his arms crossed, a smug guard dog at his master\u2019s side. The circle was complete again, with her now sealed inside it. \"Tea,\" Brother Sol announced quietly, and the woman with the vacant eyes rose without a word, moving to a collection of pots near the stove to pour a steaming, dark liquid into a clay mug.\n\n\"Imogen told me you were a scholar,\" Brother Sol began, his tone gentle, conversational, as he settled onto his own cushion. \"A woman of great intellect. Your world is one of facts, of evidence, of neatly ordered arguments. It must be very difficult for you to comprehend a place like this, a place that is governed not by the head, but by the heart.\" He folded his hands in his lap, the picture of serene wisdom. The woman returned and handed Ellie the mug of tea. It smelled strongly of the sweet, herbal scent that filled the yurt. Ellie stared into the murky liquid, her mind screaming at her not to drink it, not to ingest anything, not to cede one more inch of control. She placed it on the floor beside her. Brother Sol\u2019s eyes noted the gesture, a flicker of something\u2014amusement? annoyance?\u2014passing through them before the placid mask returned. \"You fear what you don\u2019t understand, Eleanor. It\u2019s a natural human response. You see your sister, and you think she is lost. But what if she is finally found? What if the life you saw as vibrant was simply the frantic thrashing of a drowning woman, and this,\" he gestured around the candlelit yurt, \"is the shore she has finally reached?\"\n\nThe patronising, infuriating calm of his voice was a fine-honed weapon. He was taking all of her legitimate concerns, all of her love and fear for Imogen, and recasting them as intellectual arrogance, as emotional blindness. And Imogen just sat there, her hands resting in her lap, her expression one of beatific agreement. \"He\u2019s right, El,\" she said, her voice soft, but carrying with devastating force across the circle. \"You always wanted to fix me. You proofread my life, circling all the mistakes in red pen. Here, there are no mistakes. There's no past. I don\u2019t have to be the screw-up little sister anymore.\" The words, so clearly a version of her own private agonies, were now a public indictment, served up for the approval of these strangers. Every frantic phone call, every loan, every time Ellie had dropped everything to pull her out of a mess\u2014all of it had been filed away not as love, but as criticism. The hurt was so sharp, so specific, it stole the air from her lungs.\n\n\"You see?\" Brother Sol\u2019s voice was as soft as a shroud. \"The healing has already begun. But we are not unreasonable people, Eleanor. We are not the prison you imagine us to be.\" He leaned forward, his gaze intense, pinning her in place. \"Your world and your sister\u2019s world have collided. You cannot drag her back, and we would not force you to stay. So I propose a compromise.\" A silence fell over the yurt, broken only by the crackle of the stove. Ellie looked at her sister\u2019s calm, distant face, and knew she was losing, utterly and completely. \"Stay the night,\" Brother Sol said, his voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. \"Stay with us until the sun rises. Eat our food, listen to our silence. See us not as a threat, but as a possibility. In the morning, if you still wish to leave, you are free to do so. And Imogen\u2026 Imogen will make her own choice, as a free woman.\" He sat back, his hands spread wide in a gesture of absolute reasonableness. The offer was a perfectly constructed trap. To refuse was to prove his every accusation: that she was closed-minded, controlling, afraid. To accept was to spend a night in this place, breathing this air, surrounded by these placid, empty faces, playing by their rules on their territory. It was a checkmate, delivered with a gentle smile.### Chapter 5\n\nThe silence in the yurt was a held breath, a collective pause as the dozen pairs of eyes watched her, waiting for her to break. Every instinct, honed by a lifetime of self-preservation and common sense, screamed at her to run, to scramble back up the dark mountain and away from this place of suffocating calm. But to run was to abandon Imogen to this soft-spoken monster and his vacant-eyed disciples. It was to prove him right, to cast herself as the hysteric he so clearly believed her to be. Her intellect, the tool she had always relied upon, was being turned against her, but it was still the only weapon she had. If she could not win by force, she would have to win by strategy. The terror did not recede, but it solidified into something cold and hard: resolve. She was no longer just here to rescue her sister. She was here to understand her enemy.\n\n\u201cFine,\u201d Ellie said, the single word dropping into the quiet like a stone. Her voice was flat, devoid of the emotion they were all expecting. \u201cI\u2019ll stay.\u201d Brother Sol\u2019s smile did not widen; it simply settled, like dust on a forgotten object. He had won this round, and he knew it. Imogen\u2019s expression remained unchanged, a placid mask that betrayed nothing, which was in itself the most terrifying betrayal of all. A quiet sigh of relaxation passed through the circle, as if they had been holding a collective spiritual posture that could now be released. The crisis, it seemed, was over. The wild animal had been coaxed into the enclosure.\n\n\u201cExcellent,\u201d Brother Sol murmured, his voice once again a balm. \u201cA wise decision. We grow our own food here, Eleanor. It is a simple meal, but it is pure. It will help to ground you after your journey.\u201d He made a small gesture, and two of the other members rose silently to ladle a thick, pale vegetable stew into wooden bowls. The ritual was performed with a practiced, unhurried grace that spoke of endless repetition. A bowl was placed before her, its steam carrying the same vaguely sweet, earthy smell as the tea. This was the next test. She looked down at the anonymous mush. It was probably just potatoes and parsnips, a harmless, bland meal. But in this place, nothing felt harmless. It felt like a sacrament, an act of communion she had no desire to join. She looked across the circle at Imogen, who had already begun to eat, lifting the wooden spoon to her mouth with a slow, meditative reverence, as if partaking in the most exquisite feast. The sight decided her. She would not starve, but she would not surrender. She picked up her spoon and took a small, cautious mouthful. It was bland, lukewarm, and tasted of boiled roots and self-righteousness.\n\nAs they ate, in a silence that felt more performative than peaceful, Brother Sol began to speak again, his voice a low, didactic purr. \u201cThe world you come from, Eleanor, is a world of noise. A world of constant, meaningless stimulation. Television shows.\u201d He glanced at her, a knowing glint in his eye, and she felt a hot flush of shame. He knew. Imogen had told him everything. \u201cIt offers the illusion of connection, but it only deepens the isolation. It makes you crave applause from strangers while the people who love you are right beside you, unheard. It teaches you that your own, true voice is not enough.\u201d He was a master, she had to grant him that. He was taking the specific, absurd details of her life and twisting them into a universal spiritual malady, with Gwawr Newydd as the only cure. He was not just trying to keep Imogen; he was actively trying to recruit Ellie.\n\n\u201cBut my voice *is* enough,\u201d Ellie said, her own voice quiet but clear, cutting through his sermon. She placed her spoon down in the half-empty bowl. \u201cMy sister was the one who told me to use it. She was the one who believed in it.\u201d She looked directly at Imogen, willing her to meet her gaze, to remember the giddy, drunken dare, the shared history that predated this place. For a flicker of a second, something shifted in Imogen\u2019s eyes. A flicker of confusion, of memory. Then it was gone, smoothed over by the placid calm. \u201cThat was before I understood what real belief was,\u201d Imogen said, her voice a parroted echo. \u201cThat was before I found my real voice. A quiet one.\u201d The words were Imogen\u2019s, but the syntax, the sentiment, was all Brother Sol\u2019s. He had not just given her new clothes; he had given her a new language, a whole new internal text to recite.\n\nThe meal ended as it began, in silence. The bowls were collected, and a new ritual began. Brother Sol produced a small, hand-carved wooden flute and began to play a simple, haunting melody that wound its way around the warm, close air of the yurt. Some of the others closed their eyes, their heads lolling gently. It was meant to be peaceful, a lullaby for troubled souls, but Ellie found it menacing. It was music as a tool, a sedative. It was the antithesis of the raw, joyful, chaotic noise of Etta James or Nina Simone, the music she and Imogen had been raised on. This was a sound designed to smooth over the rough edges of a personality, to lull the critical mind to sleep. She watched them, her exhaustion a physical pain, and for the first time, she saw the cracks. The woman with the vacant eyes had a faint tremor in her hand. The young man with the wispy beard was staring into the flames of the stove with an intensity that looked less like peace and more like desperation. They were not saved. they were sedated.\n\nFinally, after an eternity, Brother Sol placed his flute down. \u201cIt is time for rest,\u201d he announced. \u201cThe mountain requires you to be strong.\u201d He looked at Ellie. \u201cRik will show you to a guest yurt. We will speak again in the morning light.\u201d The dismissal was final. Rik got to his feet, the smug satisfaction back on his face. \u201cThis way, Professor,\u201d he said, his use of her title a deliberate mockery. Ellie stood, her legs stiff and sore. \u201cImmy,\u201d she said, her voice a plea. \u201cGoodnight, Eleanor,\u201d Imogen replied, not looking at her. The use of her full name was a final, devastating wall between them. She was no longer El. She was a visitor. A stranger.\n\nRik led her out of the warm, cloying yurt and into the biting cold of the night. The wind had picked up, and the stars were gone, hidden behind a thick blanket of cloud. He gestured towards the smallest, most isolated of the yurts, which stood at the very edge of the clearing, its canvas flapping listlessly in the wind. Inside, it was stark and cold. A simple cot with a thin mattress and a pile of rough blankets was the only furniture. A single, unlit lantern sat on the floor. \u201cSleep well,\u201d Rik said from the doorway, his silhouette blocking out what little light there was. \u201cThe mountain has a way of clearing the head.\u201d He then pulled the canvas flap shut, and Ellie was plunged into absolute darkness, the sound of his footsteps crunching away on the stony ground a final, departing punctuation. She stood there for a full minute, her heart hammering, listening to the wind howl and the canvas strain against its ropes. She was alone, unarmed, and miles from anyone who knew her name was anything other than \u2018The Prof\u2019. The absurdity was so profound it bordered on hysteria. She had to choose a song for the final. A Winner\u2019s Anthem. In the freezing, pitch-black silence of the yurt, a single, wild, inappropriate bubble of laughter escaped her lips before she choked it back, swallowing it like a sob.The laugh died in her throat, strangled by the raw, biting cold that seemed to radiate from the very ground beneath her feet. The darkness was absolute, a physical pressure on her eyes. For a moment, she was nothing but a collection of frantic senses: the rough weave of the canvas flapping violently just inches from her face, the howl of the wind like a hungry animal, the metallic taste of fear in her mouth. She fumbled in her satchel, her numb fingers closing around the reassuring, cylindrical shape of her torch. The sudden, piercingly bright beam of white LED light was a violent intrusion, an act of technological defiance in this self-consciously primitive world. It sliced through the gloom, revealing the stark reality of her prison. The yurt was barely eight feet across, the canvas walls stained with mildew. The cot was a simple wooden frame, the blankets a pile of coarse, unwashed wool. The only way out was the entrance flap, secured from the outside by a simple leather thong tied in a knot. She was not a guest being offered shelter; she was a package that had been received and stored.\n\nHer academic detachment, the very quality she had joked about with Imogen over the phone in what felt like another lifetime, descended on her now as a survival mechanism. Panic was a luxury she could not afford. She began to dissect her situation with the same cold precision she would apply to a flawed thesis. Premise: Brother Sol was not a spiritual guide but a predator. Evidence: the practiced manipulation, the isolation tactics, the cloying, uniform serenity of his followers. Hypothesis: the 'compromise' was a trap. He had no intention of letting Imogen make a free choice in the morning. The purpose of the night was to disorient and exhaust her, the sole dissenting voice, until she was too broken to argue effectively. The morning would not be a discussion; it would be a public performance of her failure, designed to cement Imogen\u2019s loyalty and reinforce his own power. Waiting for sunrise was not just passive; it was suicidal.\n\nThe plan formed in her mind, a sharp, clear counter-argument to Brother Sol\u2019s suffocating narrative. She would not sleep. She would not wait to be ritually humiliated. She was a researcher, and this was an unsanctioned, high-stakes piece of fieldwork. She needed data. She needed leverage. She needed something that could shatter the fragile, carefully constructed reality of Gwawr Newydd. Her gaze fell on her satchel. She laid its contents on the thin mattress: the road atlas, the protein bar, the now-useless phone charger, and the heavy-duty torch. The torch was her only tool. Its bright, unwavering beam felt like an extension of her own will, a projection of reason into a world of murky belief. She had to get out of the yurt. She had to observe them when they believed they were unobserved.\n\nThe wind was her ally. It battered the canvas walls with such ferocity that any small noise she made would be swallowed by the gale. She crept to the flap, her heart a frantic drum against her ribs. The leather thong was tied in a complex, self-tightening knot, designed to be opened from the outside. Her fingers, stiff with cold, fumbled with the knot, picking at it with her raw thumbnail. For a frustrating minute, it held fast, a simple, infuriating puzzle. Then, with a final, desperate tug, it loosened. She paused, listening, but there was only the wind. She slowly, carefully, pulled the flap inwards, creating a narrow gap. A blast of freezing, rain-laced air hit her face. Peering out, she saw that the main yurt was still glowing, but the other smaller yurts were dark. She had to assume they were all occupied. Her own yurt, the \u2018guest\u2019 quarters, was deliberately placed at the furthest edge of the circle, a quarantine zone. It gave her a precious few yards of open, unlit ground. Taking a deep, shuddering breath, she slipped out into the night, pulling the flap closed behind her. The cold was a shock that stole her breath, but it was a clean cold, a vast and honest cold, and it felt infinitely better than the close, herbal warmth of the central yurt.\n\nCrouching low, she scurried across the open ground to the shadow of the next yurt in the circle, pressing her back against its cold, damp canvas. From here, she had a partial view of the entire compound. She needed a target. The main yurt was a possibility, but it was too populated, too risky. Her mind raced, creating a mental map of the power structure. Rik was the muscle, but Brother Sol was the brain. And the brain of any operation requires an office, a place to think, to plan, to keep its secrets. She scanned the remaining yurts. One stood slightly apart from the others, on a small, raised patch of ground that gave it a commanding view of the small community. It was no larger than the rest, but its placement spoke of status. That had to be his. That was her destination.\n\nThe journey from one shadow to the next was the longest hundred yards of her life. The ground was treacherous, a mixture of slippery grass and loose stones that threatened to betray her with every step. She moved in short, breathless bursts, her torch off, her eyes straining in the profound darkness. The wind whipped her hair across her face and tore at her jacket. Twice she froze as the cry of a sheep echoed across the valley, mistaking it for a human shout. Finally, she reached it, pressing herself against the canvas of Brother Sol\u2019s yurt. She held her breath and listened. There was no sound from within, only the incessant drumming of the wind. Taking a risk that made her stomach clench with fear, she crept around to the entrance flap. It was untied. With infinite slowness, she lifted a corner and peered inside. It was empty.\n\nSlipping inside, she was met not with the spartan simplicity she expected, but with the subtle signs of a hidden life. While a simple cot and a few sheepskins occupied one side of the space, the other was arranged as a workspace. A small, handcrafted wooden desk stood against the wall, and beside it, a heavy, iron-bound wooden chest. The air lacked the cloying herbal scent of the main yurt; it smelled only of canvas and old wood. This was the nerve centre. The facade of a simple man living a simple life was a lie. This was the office of a CEO. Her torch beam, shielded and narrowed by her cupped hand, darted around the space. The desk drawers were unlocked but contained nothing more than spare candles and bundles of dried herbs, a piece of stage-dressing. The chest was the real prize. It was secured with a heavy, ornate padlock. She swore silently. Her search had hit a dead end. Despair began to prick at the edges of her resolve. Then her light caught a glint of something on the floor, half-tucked under the edge of the sheepskin rug beside the cot. A small, brass key on a loop of leather cord. It was a careless, arrogant mistake, the kind of mistake made by a man who believed himself to be untouchable.\n\nHer hands were trembling so badly she could barely fit the key into the lock. It turned with a loud, grating click that sounded, in the silence, like a gunshot. She froze, listening, but there was only the wind. She lifted the heavy lid of the chest, her torch beam dipping inside. Her breath caught in her throat. There were no spiritual texts, no sacred objects. The chest was filled with the profane relics of the world he claimed to despise. There were neat, tight bundles of fifty-pound notes, thousands of them. There was a satellite phone and a portable solar charger. And beneath them, a thick, leather-bound ledger. She lifted it out, her fingers numb. She opened it to the first page. It was a meticulously detailed accounting book. Down the left-hand column was a list of names, twenty or thirty of them, dating back three years. Beside each name was a column titled \u2018Initial Investment\u2019 and a series of columns for \u2018Monthly Tithe\u2019. She ran her finger down the list of names until she found it, written in Brother Sol\u2019s elegant, looping script: *Imogen Vance*. Next to her name, in the \u2018Initial Investment\u2019 column, was a figure that made Ellie feel physically sick: \u00a340,000. It was the exact amount Imogen had inherited when their mother passed away, money Ellie had begged her to put aside for a deposit on a flat. It wasn't a community; it was a liquidation. He was stripping these lost, lonely people of everything they had. The cold, academic fury solidified into a pure, white-hot rage. This man hadn't just taken her sister; he had plundered her. As this single, devastating truth exploded in her mind, a sound from outside cut through the howl of the wind. It was the distinct, unmistakable crunch of heavy boots on the gravel path, coming closer. And they were heading directly for this yurt.### Chapter 6\n\nPanic, cold and absolute, slammed into Ellie, extinguishing the hot flame of her rage. The footsteps were seconds away. The ledger felt like a tombstone in her hand, the torch a confession. Her mind, a finely tuned instrument for textual analysis, now became a frantic machine for tactical survival. Hiding was impossible; the yurt was a drum, and she was the pea about to be discovered inside it. She couldn't run. But she could fight, not with her fists, but with her data. The ledger was too heavy, too conspicuous to take, but the information within it was weightless. Her phone. The thought was a spark in the black terror. Her fingers, clumsy with cold and fear, scrambled in her satchel, closing around the smooth, cool glass and metal rectangle. With a surge of adrenaline that made her vision swim, she jabbed the screen to life. The sudden, invasive brightness of the display felt like a betrayal, a beacon signalling her presence.\n\nThe footsteps stopped directly outside the flap. There was a pause, a moment of dreadful stillness where the only sound was the screaming wind. Her thumb, slick with nervous sweat, swiped and tapped, opening the camera app. She aimed the phone at the ledger, the viewfinder a small, chaotic rectangle of her shaking hands, the flickering torchlight, and the damning, elegant script. She fought to steady her hand, to bring the words into focus: *Imogen Vance\u2026 \u00a340,000*. A shadow fell across the canvas flap. A hand was reaching for the tie. She jabbed the shutter icon. The phone registered the capture with a subtle, haptic buzz that felt like an electric shock. With no time to check the image, she shoved the phone deep into the inner pocket of her jacket, zipping it shut. The ledger was still clutched in her other hand as the canvas flap was ripped open with a violent tearing sound.\n\nIt was Brother Sol. The wind billowed in around him, throwing the candlelight on his desk into a frenzy and threatening to extinguish it. He stood framed in the entrance, a dark, broad silhouette against the turbulent night. The beam of Ellie's torch, held in her trembling hand, caught his face, and she saw that the guru was gone. The paternal warmth, the serene wisdom, had been burned away, leaving behind something hard, cold, and reptilian. His eyes were not disappointed or sad; they were filled with a flat, murderous fury. For a long, stretched second, neither of them moved. It was a tableau of discovery: the thief, the evidence, and the avenging academic caught in the act. The wind howled through the yurt, a chorus for the drama about to unfold.\n\n\u201cYou have a deep-seated need to trespass,\u201d he said, his voice no longer a soothing baritone but a low, dangerous gravel. He took a step inside, letting the flap fall closed behind him, plunging them into the intimate, suffocating space. He looked from her face to the ledger in her hand, then to the open, plundered chest. \u201cA scholar\u2019s curiosity, I presume?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m a linguist,\u201d Ellie shot back, her own voice sharp and brittle, forged in the terror of the last few minutes. \u201cI specialise in rooting out fraudulent narratives. And this,\u201d she held the ledger up, the heavy book a shield between them, \u201cis a masterpiece of the genre. Tell me, is \u2018Brother Sol\u2019 the name you were born with, or is it just a trading name for your business?\u201d She was goading him, pulling the argument onto her own intellectual turf, the only ground where she had ever felt secure.\n\nHe laughed, a short, ugly bark that held no humour. \u201cYou think you\u2019re clever. You think your little words and your degrees give you power here.\u201d He began to advance on her slowly, his movements measured, predatory. The tight space of the yurt shrank around them. \u201cThese people are broken. The world you champion broke them. I give them a story they can live in. I give them peace. They give me what they no longer need. It\u2019s the oldest transaction in the world, Professor. It\u2019s called faith.\u201d \u201cYou call it faith, I call it theft,\u201d Ellie retorted, backing away until her legs hit the wooden frame of the cot. \u201cYou took my sister\u2019s inheritance. Forty thousand pounds. That wasn't a tithe. That was her future. You stole it.\u201d \u201cShe invested it!\u201d he roared, his composure finally cracking, his face contorting with rage. \u201cShe invested it in her own salvation!\u201d\n\nHe lunged, not at her, but at the ledger. Ellie reacted instinctively, twisting away, but he was faster, stronger. His hand clamped around her wrist, his grip like iron. The torch fell from her hand, rolling across the floor and casting wild, spinning shadows across the canvas walls. A sharp, searing pain shot up her arm. He wrenched the ledger from her grasp with a grunt of triumph. \u201cYou have seen nothing,\u201d he hissed, his face inches from hers, his breath sour. \u201cYou are a hysterical woman who got lost on a mountain. No one will believe you.\u201d \u201cThey won\u2019t have to,\u201d Ellie gasped, the pain in her wrist making her dizzy. She thought of the phone, safe in her zipped pocket, a secret victory. The thought must have shown on her face, because his eyes narrowed. His gaze dropped from her face to her jacket, to the slight, rectangular bulge of the inner pocket. A new, dawning horror washed over Ellie as she realised her mistake. He hadn't known. Now he did. With his free hand, he reached for her jacket. \u201cGive it to me,\u201d he snarled. As Ellie began to struggle in earnest, a frantic, desperate fight for the last piece of evidence she possessed, a voice called from outside, sharp with alarm. \u201cSol? Is everything alright?\u201d The flap was pulled open again, and Rik stood there, his bulk filling the doorway, his face a mask of confusion that quickly hardened as he took in the scene: Brother Sol grappling with a terrified Ellie, the fallen torch, the open chest. The odds had just become impossible.Rik\u2019s arrival was the closing of the steel trap. The brief, flicker of confusion on his face was instantly extinguished, replaced by a dull, brutish certainty as Brother Sol, a master of immediate narrative control, gave him his script. \u201cRik! She is an infection!\u201d Sol snarled, his grip tightening painfully on Ellie\u2019s wrist. \u201cShe came here to desecrate this place, to destroy what we have built! She is trying to steal from us!\u201d The accusation was a perfect inversion of the truth, and Rik absorbed it without question. His loyalty was not to reason, but to the man who had given him a purpose, and that purpose was now to subdue the threat. He moved forward into the yurt, his large frame blocking the exit completely, his face set in a mask of righteous anger.\n\nThe fight became a frantic, desperate scrabble in the claustrophobic space. Rik grabbed Ellie\u2019s other arm, his powerful hands easily overpowering her resistance. She was trapped between them, a doll being torn apart. Sol, his face contorted in a venomous sneer, abandoned her wrist and went directly for her jacket, his fingers scrabbling at the zip of the inner pocket. Ellie twisted and kicked, her academic mind replaced by a primal, cornered-animal instinct to protect her young. The phone was her only cub, her only proof, the only thing that gave this entire nightmare meaning. \"He's the thief!\" she screamed, the words torn from her throat, directed not at Sol but at Rik. \"He's lying to you! He stole my sister's money! He's stealing from all of you! Check the book!\"\n\nIt was in that chaotic, violent moment of struggle that the world tilted. Whether it was Ellie\u2019s flailing leg or Sol\u2019s clumsy lunge, a heavy boot connected with the small wooden desk. The delicate balance was broken. The desk tipped, scattering its contents\u2014candles, dried herbs, a half-empty mug\u2014across the floor. One of the lit candles, a thick stub of beeswax, rolled under the edge of the cot and came to rest against the pile of dry, oily sheepskins. For a single, horrifying second, nothing happened. Then, a tiny orange flame, no bigger than a thumbnail, licked at a strand of wool. It hesitated, then bloomed with an eager, hungry life.\n\nThe fire did not grow; it exploded. The tinder-dry wool and the resins in the wood of the cot ignited with a terrifying \u2018whoosh\u2019. A wall of sudden, intense heat blasted through the yurt, forcing Sol and Rik to recoil with curses of pain and shock. Black, acrid smoke billowed upwards, instantly filling the small space. The roar of the flames joined the howl of the wind, creating a deafening, hellish symphony. The struggle for the phone was forgotten, replaced by the more immediate, primal fear of being burned alive. Sol, his face a mask of disbelief and fury at this turn of events, scrambled for the ledger, snatching it from the floor where it had fallen near the spreading flames. Rik, momentarily stunned, backed away towards the entrance. The spell was broken. The sanctuary was on fire. And Ellie was, for the first time, free.\n\nShe didn't hesitate. In the smoke and confusion, as Sol and Rik were blinded and choking, she wrenched herself free of their loosened grips. She stumbled backwards, her lungs screaming for air, her eyes streaming. The fire was now a roaring furnace, climbing the canvas walls with terrifying speed, turning the entire structure into a giant, glowing lantern of destruction. She scrambled out of the entrance flap, gulping in the clean, freezing, rain-laced air, and fell to her knees on the muddy ground, coughing and gasping. The fire was a beacon on the dark mountain, a funeral pyre for Gwawr Newydd. From the other yurts, doors were being thrown open, and confused, sleepy figures were emerging, their faces lit by the terrifying orange glow. Shouts of alarm and panic cut through the night. And then she saw her. Imogen. She was standing outside her own yurt, her hand to her mouth, her face a canvas of utter horror and disbelief. Her placid calm was shattered, replaced by a raw, naked terror as she stared at the inferno that had been Brother Sol\u2019s sanctum. Her eyes, wide and wild, left the fire and found Ellie, smoke-stained, dishevelled, and gasping for air, emerging from the heart of the flames like a vengeful spirit.The two sisters stared at each other across a chasm of fire and lies. The inferno behind Ellie painted her in demonic light, the wind whipping her hair into a wild halo, her face streaked with soot. To Imogen, standing frozen in the clearing, the serene, controlled world of Gwawr Newydd had been ripped open, revealing a roaring, chaotic hell. And from the heart of that hell had walked her sister. The woman she had accused of being an anchor, a weight, had just torn through the fabric of her new reality. In Imogen\u2019s eyes, the placid emptiness of the last few days was being burned away, replaced by the old, familiar terror, but this time it was clear, sharp, and directed at the right people. Her lips formed a single, broken word, a name that was a question, an apology, and a plea all at once. \"El...\"\n\nBefore Ellie could respond, before she could close the distance between them, Brother Sol exploded from the burning yurt, a creature of pure, unrestrained fury. He clutched the heavy ledger to his chest like a holy text, his silver hair wild, his robes stained with soot, his face a mask of rage that was far more terrifying than any serene smile. Rik was a step behind him, a bewildered but obedient bull. The remaining followers, drawn from their sleep by the light and the noise, were a panicked, confused flock, their faces illuminated by the destruction of their sanctuary. Sol raised a trembling, accusatory hand, pointing it directly at Ellie. \"She did this!\" he bellowed, his voice raw, stripped of all its soothing artifice. \"The outsider! The poison! She came here to destroy our peace! To burn us from our home! Don't let her escape!\"\n\nThe command hung in the air, a final, desperate attempt to reassert control. The followers hesitated, caught between the instinct to flee the fire and the ingrained habit of obedience. But it was Imogen who acted. She saw it all in that one, horrifying instant: the man of peace revealed as a screaming, vengeful tyrant, and the sister who she had rejected, smoke-stained and desperate, who had walked through fire for her. The choice was not a choice at all; it was a violent realignment of her entire world. With a strangled cry that was part sob, part war cry, she broke from her frozen stance. She did not run from the chaos. She ran directly into it, straight towards Ellie. Her hand, cold and trembling, found Ellie\u2019s and gripped it with a fierce, desperate strength. \"Run, El!\" she screamed, her voice raw with terror and a lifetime of unspoken apologies. \"Just run!\"\n\nChaos was their cover. Ellie, yanked into motion by Imogen\u2019s sudden, decisive action, plunged with her into the darkness at the edge of the clearing. They scrambled up the steep, muddy bank that led back towards the track, their feet slipping, their lungs burning. The roar of the fire behind them was a physical pressure, and the shouts of Sol and Rik were sharp and clear above the din. \"Get them! Don't let them reach the road!\" The fire that had saved Ellie now betrayed her, lighting up their frantic escape, making them stark, running silhouettes against the dark hillside. They were utterly exposed. Ellie risked a glance back and saw Rik, his powerful frame built for this kind of terrain, already starting up the slope after them, his face a grim mask of determination.\n\nTheir flight down the mountain was a terrifying, stumbling parody of Ellie's ascent. The path was a treacherous stream of mud and loose rock, made slick by the rain that had begun to fall in earnest, a cold, stinging curtain against their faces. They were running blind, guided only by the memory of the path and the frantic, animal need to escape. Ellie\u2019s body, already pushed past its limits, screamed in protest. Her legs were leaden, her breath a series of ragged, tearing gasps. But Imogen, whose life had been a series of sprints away from self-made disasters, was in her element. She pulled Ellie along, her grip like a vice, navigating the treacherous path with a reckless, instinctive energy. The heavy, pounding footsteps behind them grew louder, a relentless drumbeat counting down the seconds until they were caught.\n\n\"He knows about the phone!\" Ellie gasped, the words wrenched from her as they half-fell, half-slid down a steep, gravelly section of the track. \"I have proof, Immy! I have it on my phone!\" Imogen didn't look back. The information seemed to galvanize her, lending a new, steely desperation to her flight. It wasn't just an escape anymore; it was a mission. They had to get the evidence out. They had to expose him. The darkness, which had been so terrifying on the way up, was now their only true friend. They rounded a sharp bend in the track, plunging them momentarily out of the fire's direct light. Ahead, the world was a uniform, impenetrable black, the path ahead a matter of pure faith. Behind them, they heard Rik\u2019s furious grunt as he stumbled, buying them a few precious seconds. They were no longer the academic and the screw-up. They were two women running for their lives down a dark mountain, carrying a single, fragile spark of truth, with the monsters closing in behind them.### Chapter 7\n\nThe descent was a controlled fall, a chaotic, breathless scramble into the heart of the storm. The wind and rain were a united force, lashing at their faces, stealing their breath, and turning the track into a slick, treacherous river of mud. Every step was a gamble. Rocks, loosened by the downpour, shifted and rolled under their feet. The air burned in Ellie\u2019s lungs, a raw, acidic fire that was more painful than the protesting scream of her muscles. She was a liability, a dead weight, and she knew it. The intellectual stamina that could see her through a fourteen-hour archival session was useless here; her body was a foreign country, and its government was in full-scale revolt. It was Imogen who kept them moving, her grip on Ellie\u2019s hand an unbreakable, live wire of energy. She moved with a desperate, animal grace, her feet finding purchase where Ellie saw only black, churning mire.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t look back, El! Just breathe! In through your nose, out through your mouth. Like we used to do, running for the bus!\u201d Imogen\u2019s voice was a ragged gasp beside her, but it was a commander\u2019s gasp, a leader\u2019s. It was a jarring, disorienting role reversal. For their entire lives, Ellie had been the planner, the navigator, the one who saw the pitfalls and steered them to safety. Now, in this raw, elemental chaos, Imogen was the one in charge. All her years of running from bad decisions, of scrambling away from the consequences of her own impulsive nature, had, it seemed, been a kind of brutal, unorthodox training. She knew how to flee. The heavy, rhythmic pounding of Rik\u2019s pursuit was a terrifyingly constant bass note to the high-pitched shriek of the wind. He was not tiring. The mountain was his home, and he was simply walking it, while they were being broken by it.\n\n\u201cDown!\u201d Imogen hissed, the command so sudden and sharp that Ellie obeyed without thinking. Imogen yanked her sideways, pulling her off the relative clarity of the track and into a thick, tangled mass of gorse and bracken. They fell, tumbling a few feet down a steep, muddy bank, the thorny branches tearing at their clothes and skin. They came to a halt in a sodden, earthy heap, shielded from the path by a dense curtain of foliage. \u201cDon't move. Don\u2019t even breathe,\u201d Imogen whispered, her mouth right by Ellie\u2019s ear. A few seconds later, Rik\u2019s heavy form pounded past their hiding place, a dark shape moving with relentless, brutish purpose down the track. He didn\u2019t even break his stride. In the darkness, he hadn\u2019t seen them veer off. They had bought themselves a handful of seconds, nothing more.\n\nHuddled together in the freezing, wet darkness, the world was a cacophony of their own ragged breathing and the frantic, terrified thumping of their hearts. The gorse thorns dug into Ellie\u2019s back, a series of small, sharp anchors to their terrifying reality. \u201cHe\u2019s a machine,\u201d Ellie gasped, her body trembling with a combination of cold, exhaustion, and pure terror. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to make it.\u201d Imogen squeezed her hand, a fierce, reassuring pressure. \u201cYes, we are,\u201d she whispered back, her voice shaking but laced with a core of steel Ellie had never heard before. \u201cYou didn\u2019t walk up a bloody mountain and walk out of a fire just to get caught now, El. You have the phone. You have the proof. We\u2019re getting out.\u201d She looked at Ellie then, her eyes, just visible in the gloom, wide and stripped of all pretense. \u201cYou came for me. You actually came.\u201d The statement was not an accusation, but a marvel, a discovery. Before Ellie could answer, a furious roar echoed up from further down the track. Rik had reached the spot where the path flattened out and realised he had lost them. He knew they had to be hiding somewhere between. The footsteps started again, slower this time, more deliberate. He was hunting them now.\n\n\"He'll check the sides,\" Ellie whispered, her strategic mind kicking back into gear through the fog of exhaustion. \"He'll comb the whole area. We can't stay here.\" Imogen nodded, her eyes darting into the darkness around them. \"Then we don't use the path,\" she said, her voice low and decisive. \"We go straight down. It's steeper, but he'll expect us to stick to the track.\" It was a reckless, insane plan, a direct plunge through uncharted, treacherous terrain in the pitch black. It was exactly the kind of plan Imogen would come up with. And it was their only hope. Pushing themselves up, ignoring the scrapes and the pain, they turned their backs on the track and began to fight their way directly down the mountainside, a desperate, near-vertical scramble through thorns, slick grass, and loose shale.\n\nIt was a nightmare of controlled falling, of grabbing at thin air and tough, rooted heather to slow their descent. Their world was a blur of mud, pain, and the frantic, whipping sting of rain on their faces. They were no longer running, but surviving, moving on pure, animal instinct. And then, through the driving rain, they saw them. Two immense, black shapes, starker than the surrounding darkness, loomed up before them. The standing stones. They had bypassed the final loop of the track and had come out right above the road. A wild, desperate hope surged through Ellie, a jolt of energy that propelled her the last few feet. They slid the last few yards on a wave of mud and gravel, landing in a heap on the narrow verge of the road itself. And there it was. Fifty yards away. Her Ford Focus, a solid, beautiful, miraculously real object, its familiar, unassuming shape the most beautiful thing Ellie had ever seen.\n\nBut their relief was instantly shattered. A figure detached itself from the shadow of the larger standing stone, stepping out onto the road to block their path to the car. It was Rik. He hadn't been fooled. He had taken the same shortcut, his knowledge of the mountain far superior to their desperate improvisation. He stood there, his chest heaving, his face a grim rictus of triumph in the gloom. He had them. They were cornered, with the empty road stretching into darkness on one side and the impassable mountain on the other. \"Nowhere left to run,\" he grunted, taking a slow, heavy step towards them. Ellie\u2019s mind raced, a final, frantic calculation. Her hand dove into her pocket, not for the phone, but for her car keys. \"Immy!\" she yelled, and threw the keys in a high arc towards her sister. For a fraction of a second, Rik's eyes followed the glint of metal, a fatal, instinctive flicker of distraction. It was the only opening she would get. Instead of running for the car, Ellie feinted right, then charged left, directly at him. It was a move of such suicidal, unexpected foolishness that it worked. He stumbled back, bracing for an impact that never came, as she veered at the last second and sprinted past him, down the road, away from the car.\n\nImogen, catching the keys with the same reflexive skill she usually reserved for a thrown gin and tonic, didn't hesitate. She bolted for the car, her fingers jamming the fob, searching for the unlock button. The car let out a loud, cheerful chirp and its lights flashed once, a beacon of glorious, mundane technology in the ancient darkness. Rik, realising he'd been tricked, let out a roar of fury and turned from Ellie to charge after Imogen. But he was too late. Imogen wrenched the driver's side door open and threw herself inside. The engine coughed, then roared to life with a sound more beautiful than any symphony. The headlights blazed on, catching Rik full in the face. He stopped, blinded, raising a hand to shield his eyes, a great beast caught in the glare. That was Ellie\u2019s moment. She changed direction, sprinting back towards the passenger side of the car, wrenching the door open and diving in headfirst just as Imogen stamped her foot on the accelerator. The tires screamed on the wet tarmac. For a heart-stopping second, Rik's furious, contorted face appeared at the passenger window, his fist raised to smash the glass. Then the car lurched forward, throwing him off balance. They were moving. They were free. In the rearview mirror, Ellie saw his figure shrink, a furious, impotent shape standing alone on the dark, rain-swept mountain road, growing smaller and smaller, until he was swallowed completely by the night.The car fishtailed on the slick, winding road, the tires screaming in protest as Imogen fought to keep them from plunging into the dark valley below. The engine roared, a frantic, high-pitched whine that seemed to mirror the panic in Ellie\u2019s own chest. The world outside the windscreen was a liquid chaos of lashing rain and a darkness so total it felt like they were driving through the bottom of the ocean. Inside the car, the only sounds were the frantic, rhythmic slap of the windscreen wipers battling the deluge and their own ragged, desperate gasps for air. Ellie pressed her forehead against the cold glass of the passenger window, her body one great, trembling ache. The image of Rik\u2019s face at the window, contorted with a primal, murderous rage, was burned onto the back of her eyelids. They were moving, they were safe, but the terror was still inside the car with them, a third passenger buckled in by adrenaline and shock.\n\nThey drove in a profound, shell-shocked silence for what felt like an eternity, the narrow mountain road slowly descending and widening into a more civilised A-road. The signs for Aberglynn, the small town that now felt like a lifetime ago, appeared in the headlights. Imogen pulled the car over into a deserted, rain-swept lay-by, the engine ticking and groaning as she finally killed the ignition. The sudden silence was absolute, broken only by the drumming of the rain on the car roof. For a long moment, neither of them moved. They just sat, staring into the darkness, two survivors washed up on the shore of a nightmare. It was Imogen who broke first. A single, ragged sob escaped her, a sound wrenched from a place of deep, foundational shame. Then another, and another, until she was weeping without restraint, her shoulders shaking, her face buried in her hands.\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" she choked out between sobs, the words thick and almost incomprehensible. \"Oh god, El, I'm so, so sorry. I was so stupid. I believed him. I believed all of it.\" Ellie turned to her, the anger she had felt, the frustration, the hurt \u2013 it all just evaporated, leaving behind only a vast, hollowed-out ache of love and relief. She reached across the centre console, her hand finding her sister\u2019s shaking shoulder. \"It's okay,\" Ellie said, her own voice a raw, cracked whisper. \"Immy, it's okay. We're okay.\" \"No, it's not!\" Imogen wailed, lifting her head, her face a mess of tears and streaked mud in the dim glow of the dashboard lights. \"I gave him everything, El. The money from Mum. I just\u2026 handed it to him. He said it was an investment in the community, in my own soul. I was so lost, and he sounded so certain. And I accused you\u2026 I said your love was heavy.\" The memory of the words, spoken with such placid cruelty in the yurt, hung between them, more painful than any physical blow.\n\n\"We can talk about that later,\" Ellie said, her voice gentle but firm. \"Right now, we need to think.\" Her mind, slowly coming back online, began to triage the situation. They were out, but they were not safe. Her jacket felt heavy, and she remembered why. \"The phone,\" she said, her voice sharp with a new urgency. She fumbled with the zip of her inner pocket, her fingers clumsy and numb. She pulled the phone out. The screen was a spiderweb of fine cracks, and the case was slick with rainwater. Her heart sank. It was dead. Useless. \"No,\" she whispered, a fresh wave of despair washing over her. All of it\u2014the fire, the fight, the terrifying escape\u2014it had all been for nothing. \"Wait,\" Imogen said, wiping her eyes with the back of her muddy hand. She pointed to the dashboard. \"The charger.\" Ellie stared at the familiar USB port in the car, a piece of mundane technology she had never been more grateful to see. With trembling hands, she found the charging cable she always kept tangled in the glove compartment and plugged the phone in. For a terrible, breathless second, nothing happened. Then the screen flickered to life, displaying a low battery symbol. It was working.\n\nThe relief was so immense it felt like a physical blow. As the phone drank in the car's power, Ellie\u2019s mind turned to the next problem. \"He knows who I am, Immy. He has my name. He probably knows where I live. We can't go back to Wokingham.\" \"We go to the police,\" Imogen said immediately, her voice gaining a sliver of its old resolve. \"We show them the photo. We tell them everything.\" \"And say what?\" Ellie countered, the full absurdity of their situation crashing down on her. \"That we were held captive by a cult leader named Brother Sol, who we provoked into a fight, accidentally set his yurt on fire, and then fled down a mountain? Look at us. We look like criminals. He's probably already called them himself on his satellite phone, telling them two hysterical women from the city attacked him and committed arson.\" Her phone, now with a few percent of life, buzzed weakly. A notification from a news app lit up the cracked screen. *'Britain's Next Star' Finalist 'The Prof' Incommunicado Ahead of Grand Final*. The headline was a dispatch from a parallel universe, a grotesque, comical counterpoint to their grim reality. Ellie let out a short, hysterical laugh. \"And apparently, I'm a missing person in another, much more public, story.\" She showed the screen to Imogen, whose eyes widened in disbelief.\n\n\"Oh my god,\" Imogen whispered. \"The final. That's this week.\" The two worlds had finally collided with the force of a head-on crash. Dr. Vance, the fugitive academic, and The Prof, the nation\u2019s sweetheart, were the same person, and both of them were sitting in a beat-up Ford Focus in a rainy lay-by in the middle of Wales, covered in mud and fear. They needed help. Not from the police, not yet. They needed someone who could bridge those two worlds. Someone who knew about the chalk dust and the singing. Someone logical and steady, who would believe their insane story without question. There was only one person. \"Ben,\" Ellie said, the name a prayer. She swiped past the news alerts, her thumb finding his name in her contacts. She looked at Imogen, who just nodded, her eyes wide with trust. Ellie pressed the call button, listening to the electronic burr of the ringing tone, a lifeline cast out from the heart of the storm into the quiet, sane, book-lined world she had left behind. \"Please pick up, Ben,\" she whispered to the cracked screen. \"Please, just pick up.\"### Chapter 8\n\nThe phone rang four times, each electronic burr an eternity stretching across the chasm of the night. Ellie\u2019s hope, a fragile, flickering candle, was beginning to gutter. Then, just as she was about to give up, the ringing stopped, replaced by a click and a voice, miraculously clear and utterly calm. \u201cVance? Do you have any idea what time it is?\u201d Ben\u2019s voice, blessedly familiar and tinged with its usual dry irritation, was the most beautiful sound she had ever heard. It was the voice of reason, of footnotes and library fines, of a world where the worst thing that could happen was a misplaced semi-colon. The relief was so profound it almost broke her.\n\n\u201cBen,\u201d she breathed, the name a prayer answered. The dam of her composure, which had held through fire and flight, finally cracked. The words came out in a torrent, a frantic, jumbled narrative of chaos. \u201cBen, we\u2019re in Wales. I found her. It\u2019s a cult. He has a ledger, I have a photo, he stole her money. There was a fire, he tried to take my phone, we ran, they chased us. We have the car. We can\u2019t go home. He knows where I live. We can\u2019t go to the police. Ben, I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d The story spilled out, a raw data stream of terror, defying all the syntactical and logical structures she held so dear. There was a long, profound silence on the other end of the line, a quiet so complete she thought he might have hung up. She could picture him, sitting in his armchair, a book lying open in his lap, processing the incoherent, hysterical report from the field.\n\nWhen he finally spoke, his voice was stripped of all academic languor. It was sharp, focused, and absolute. \u201cRight. Listen to me, Ellie. Where, precisely, are you?\u201d \u201cA lay-by. Just outside a town called Aberglynn,\u201d she said, her voice shaking. \u201cOkay. Your phone. What is its battery level?\u201d \u201cCharging. About six percent.\u201d \u201cGood. First, I want you to open your email. Attach the photograph from your camera roll. Send it to me. Send it to your university address. Send it to Imogen. Create a digital footprint. Now.\u201d The command was so clear, so authoritative, it cut through her panic like a scalpel. She did as she was told, her trembling fingers navigating the cracked screen. She found the photo \u2013 blurry, backlit by the torch, but the script, the name, the figure, all horrifyingly legible. She attached it to a new email, her thumb hovering over the send button.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s sent,\u201d she whispered. \u201cGood. Now, I want you to drive to me. Do not stop. Do not go to Wokingham. Come directly to my house. I\u2019m sending you my address now. It will take you about three hours. Can you do that?\u201d \u201cI\u2026 I think so,\u201d Ellie stammered. Imogen was staring at her, her tear-streaked face pale with dawning hope. \u201cYou can,\u201d Ben\u2019s voice was firm, a rock in the swirling sea of her fear. \u201cPut the phone down. Concentrate on the road. I will see you in three hours.\u201d The line went dead, leaving Ellie in the rain-lashed silence of the car, clutching the phone that now held a single, clear instruction. A destination. A safe harbour. She turned to Imogen, a flicker of her old, capable self returning. \u201cYou heard him. We have a plan.\u201d\n\nThe journey east was a surreal, silent pilgrimage. Imogen drove, her hands gripping the steering wheel with a white-knuckled intensity, her eyes fixed on the road ahead as if the tarmac itself was a tightrope over a chasm. The weeping had stopped, replaced by a brittle, focused silence. Ellie navigated, the soft, calm voice of the GPS on her phone a bizarrely normal narrator for their desperate flight. They didn\u2019t speak of what had happened. The trauma was too large, too raw, to be dissected in the fragile confines of the car. It sat between them, a great, wounded beast, and they were both afraid to touch it. Instead, they focused on the mundane. The turn-off for the M4. The low fuel light blinking on. The tense, heart-stopping moment they had to pull into a brightly lit, twenty-four-hour service station.\n\nThe service station was a portal to another universe. People were buying coffee, reading magazines, laughing. A television mounted in the corner of the shop was playing a rolling news broadcast, and Ellie\u2019s heart seized as a familiar photograph flashed onto the screen: one of the show\u2019s glossy publicity shots of her, smiling in a polka-dot tea dress. The chyron beneath read: *STAR FINALIST MISSING: Concerns Grow for \u2018The Prof\u2019*. A man in a high-vis jacket glanced from the screen to Ellie, who had pulled her muddy hood up to hide her face, and did a slight double-take. Ellie grabbed a handful of protein bars, paid in cash without making eye contact, and fled back to the car, her heart hammering. The two stories of her life were beginning to merge, and the result was going to be an explosion.\n\nBack on the motorway, cocooned in the anonymity of the moving traffic, Imogen finally spoke, her voice barely a whisper. \u201cThey\u2019ll think you\u2019ve been kidnapped. Or that you\u2019ve had a breakdown because of the pressure.\u201d She glanced at Ellie, her expression hollowed out with guilt. \u201cThis is all my fault. Your whole life, your career\u2026 I\u2019ve ruined it.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous,\u201d Ellie said, her tone sharper than she intended. \u201cYou didn\u2019t ruin anything. I walked up that mountain. I took the photo. I made a choice, Immy. Maybe for the first time in a long time, I actually made a real one.\u201d The words hung in the air, a startling, unvarnished truth. All her life, she had moved along a safe, predictable track, from degree to degree, from semester to semester. This mad, terrifying detour was the first truly unscheduled thing she had ever done. It was horrifying, and it was, in a strange, terrifying way, utterly her own.\n\nThree hours and a lifetime later, they turned onto Ben\u2019s street. It was a quiet, tree-lined road of dark brick Victorian terraces, the kind of street where the loudest noise was the rustle of turning pages. It was a world away from the howling emptiness of the mountain. A single light burned in the downstairs window of number twenty-seven, a beacon in the pre-dawn gloom. Imogen pulled the car to a halt and killed the engine. They were here. They were safe. The adrenaline that had sustained Ellie for the past twelve hours finally drained away, leaving behind a bone-deep exhaustion so profound she wasn't sure she could even open the car door. As if sensing their arrival, the front door of the house opened. Ben stood there, silhouetted in the warm light of the hallway. He was just as she had pictured him: wearing an old university sweatshirt and a pair of worn corduroys, a book still in one hand. He took one look at the mud-caked car, then at the two dishevelled, haunted figures who stumbled out of it. He did not rush forward. He did not exclaim. His face registered no shock, only a kind of grim, intellectual confirmation. The problem he had been analysing remotely for the past three hours had finally downloaded onto his doorstep. \"Right,\" he said, his voice quiet but carrying clearly in the still morning air. \"Get inside. Both of you. I'll put the kettle on.\"Stepping across the threshold of Ben\u2019s house was like entering a different dimension. The chaotic, elemental violence of the night was instantly banished, replaced by a profound and orderly quiet. The air smelled of old paper, floor polish, and the rich, malty aroma of brewing tea. Books were everywhere, not just in shelves that lined the hallway from floor to ceiling, but in neat, carefully curated stacks on side tables and mantelpieces. It was a fortress of logic and learning, a bastion against the madness of the world, and Ellie felt a wave of gratitude so intense it almost buckled her knees. Ben took their wet, muddy jackets without a word, his expression unreadable, and hung them carefully on a coat stand where they dripped onto a waiting newspaper, a small, controlled containment of the chaos they had brought with them.\n\nHe led them into his living room, a space that was a continuation of the library in the hall. Two worn leather armchairs faced a fireplace, and a thick Persian rug covered the floor. He motioned for them to sit, then disappeared into the kitchen, the clink of mugs and the click of the kettle providing a soundtrack of reassuring domesticity. Imogen curled into one of the chairs, pulling her knees up to her chest and wrapping her arms around them, making herself as small as possible. She stared into the empty fireplace, her body trembling with a fine, continuous tremor. Ellie sat opposite, her posture rigid, her hands clasped tightly in her lap to stop them from shaking. She felt scrubbed raw, every nerve exposed, every muscle a screaming knot of pain. The warmth of the room felt alien, a comfort she hadn\u2019t yet earned. Ben returned with three large mugs of steaming tea, placing one on a coaster beside each of them. He pulled up a hard-backed dining chair and sat opposite the two sisters, his gaze steady and patient. He waited, letting the warmth of the mugs and the quiet of the room do their work.\n\nFinally, after taking a long, scalding sip of tea, Ellie began to speak. The story, which had been a frantic, panicked jumble on the phone, now came out in a more linear, if no less horrifying, sequence. She spoke with the detached precision of a witness giving a statement, describing the serene welcome, the placid faces, the conversation with Brother Sol. Imogen flinched at his name, but remained silent, her gaze fixed on the floor. Ellie recounted the discovery in the yurt, the ledger, the satellite phone, the bundles of cash. She described the confrontation, the fire, and the desperate, terrifying flight down the mountain. She did not embellish or editorialize; she simply presented the facts, a litany of horrors delivered in a flat, exhausted monotone. Through it all, Ben listened without interruption, his steepled fingers resting against his lips, his eyes never leaving her face. He was not just hearing her story; he was analysing it, cataloguing it, searching for the patterns and the weaknesses.\n\nWhen she finished, the silence in the room was thick with the weight of her narrative. \u201cThe phone,\u201d Ben said, his voice quiet. Ellie produced it, the screen a fractured mosaic, and handed it to him. He examined it for a moment, then took it to a charging port by his desk. While it powered up, he walked to a bureau and returned with a bottle of single malt whisky and three small glasses. He poured a generous measure into each without asking. \u201cMedicinal,\u201d he stated, handing one to each of them. Ellie took a sip, and the fiery liquid burned a welcome, steadying path down her throat. Imogen took the glass, but just held it, staring into its amber depths. A few minutes later, Ben retrieved the phone. He navigated to the photo gallery, his expression grim. He stared at the blurry image of the ledger, his analytical mind processing the raw data of the crime. \u201cHe\u2019s not even trying to hide it,\u201d he murmured, more to himself than to them. \u201cThe arrogance of it.\u201d He looked up at Ellie, his eyes hard with a cold, intellectual anger. \u201cThis isn\u2019t just about your sister\u2019s money, Ellie. This is a pattern. There are two dozen names in this book. This man is a predator who has been operating for years, completely under the radar.\u201d\n\nHe set the phone down on the coffee table between them, the cracked screen displaying its damning evidence. \u201cAnd now,\u201d he said, turning to his laptop which sat open on his desk, \u201cwe have the other complication.\u201d He tapped a key, and the screen came to life, showing a major news website. The lead story was a picture of her, smiling benevolently on the set of the show, under the headline: *\u2018The Prof\u2019 Vanishes: Mystery and Concern Surround Finalist\u2019s Disappearance*. There were quotes from a frantic Tamsin, worried comments from the judges, and wild speculation from the public in the comments section. They were theorising everything from a last-minute crisis of confidence to a secret, elaborate publicity stunt. Ben scrolled down to another article, this one from a tabloid, its headline more lurid: *STAR\u2019S STRESS MELTDOWN? Singer Professor Goes AWOL Before Live Final*. Ellie stared at the screen, at the smiling, confident stranger who was supposed to be her. It was like looking at her own obituary. The person in those photos, the quirky, heart-warming story the nation had bought into, was a fiction. The reality was the mud-streaked, terrified woman sitting in this room.\n\nImogen finally spoke, her voice a croak. \u201cSo we\u2019re trapped. We can\u2019t go to the police because he\u2019ll paint us as arsonists. And you can\u2019t show your face because the whole country is looking for you. He\u2019s won. He\u2019s just going to get away with it.\u201d A fresh wave of despair washed over her, and she buried her face in her hands again. \u201cNo,\u201d Ben said, his voice cutting through her hopelessness. He stood up and began to pace in front of the fireplace, his mind visibly at work, connecting the disparate, impossible threads of their situation. \u201cNo, he hasn\u2019t won. He\u2019s made a critical mistake. He\u2019s underestimated you. He thinks your public profile is a vulnerability, a source of pressure that will make you crack. He sees you as a media confection. He\u2019s wrong.\u201d Ben stopped pacing and turned to face Ellie, his eyes alight with a sudden, brilliant, and utterly terrifying idea. \u201cHe is hiding in the shadows, counting on silence and obscurity to protect him. His greatest fear is the light. And you, Ellie, are about to step onto the most brightly lit stage in the entire country.\u201d He paused, letting the weight of his words sink in. \u201cThe final is in two days. You\u2019re not going to hide. You\u2019re going to go back. You\u2019re going to get ready. And for your Winner\u2019s Anthem, you\u2019re not just going to sing a song. You\u2019re going to tell a story.\u201d### Chapter 9\n\nThe silence that followed Ben\u2019s proposal was more profound than the quiet of the mountain. It was a vacuum, sucking the very air from the room. Imogen was the first to find her voice, and it was a choked, horrified whisper. \u201cNo. Absolutely not. You can\u2019t. It\u2019s insane.\u201d She scrambled out of her chair and stood between Ellie and Ben, a makeshift, trembling bodyguard. \u201cDid you not hear what she just said? They chased us. That man, Rik, he would have killed us. You want to send her back into the spotlight where they can see her? Where they can find her? No.\u201d Her fierce protectiveness was a startling, beautiful thing, a mirror image of all the times Ellie had stood between her and a bad decision.\n\nEllie, however, did not move. She stared at Ben, not at the terrifying scale of his idea, but at the cold, impeccable logic that underpinned it. Hide, and they would be hunted forever, their lives shrinking to the size of their fear. Go to the police, and their story would be a confusing, improbable mess against the word of a charismatic, plausible man. But the show\u2026 the show was a nuclear option. It was a stage watched by millions. It was a platform of such blinding light that the shadows Brother Sol lived in could not survive its glare. The thought was so audacious, so terrifying, it was almost sublime. \u201cHe\u2019s right, Immy,\u201d Ellie said, her voice quiet but steady. The exhaustion was still there, a deep, resonant ache, but beneath it, something else was hardening into existence: purpose. \u201cHe thinks I\u2019m a joke. A TV novelty. He thinks I\u2019ll run and hide. He will never, in a million years, expect me to walk back onto that stage.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t one of your books, Ben!\u201d Imogen rounded on him, her voice rising with frantic energy. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a clever plot twist! This is my sister\u2019s life!\u201d \u201cI am acutely aware of that,\u201d Ben replied, his voice calm and even, a steadying counterpoint to her panic. \u201cAnd right now, her life as she knows it is over. His power is in his anonymity, his ability to operate in the dark. Ellie\u2019s power, the one thing she has that he can never touch, is her voice. And a platform to use it. This isn\u2019t about revenge, Imogen. It\u2019s about creating a situation so public, so undeniable, that he has nowhere left to run.\u201d He turned his gaze back to Ellie. \u201cBut it only works if you can do it. Can you lie to them all for two days? Can you stand on that stage and perform, knowing what\u2019s at stake?\u201d\n\nEllie thought of the names in the ledger. She thought of the vacant eyes of the woman who had served her the drugged-tasting tea. She thought of Imogen\u2019s inheritance, turned into bundles of cash in a wooden chest. This was no longer just about her sister. It was about all of them. \u201cYes,\u201d she said. The single word was a vow.\n\nThe next hour was a council of war held in the pre-dawn gloom of Ben\u2019s living room. They drank more tea and meticulously constructed the cover story. It had to be plausible, emotional, and, crucially, private. \u201cA family crisis,\u201d Ben stated. \u201cIt\u2019s the perfect explanation. It\u2019s unimpeachable. No one has the right to question the details.\u201d \u201cMy fault,\u201d Imogen murmured. \u201cIt can be my fault. A breakdown. An episode. It\u2019s believable.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d Ellie said firmly, looking her sister in the eye. \u201cNo more blame. It was a crisis, and I had to go to you. That\u2019s all they need to know. The rest is private.\u201d\n\nWith the story set, the first performance had to begin. Ellie took a deep, shuddering breath and found Tamsin\u2019s number. She walked into the hallway for a sliver of privacy, her heart hammering a frantic rhythm against her ribs. When the production assistant answered, her voice was a squeak of relief and exhaustion. \u201cEllie! Oh my God, Ellie, where are you? Are you okay? We\u2019ve been going out of our minds!\u201d Ellie leaned her forehead against the cool, book-lined wall and began to act. She let her voice crack. She infused it with the genuine exhaustion and trauma she was feeling, but channelled it into the fictional narrative. \u201cTamsin, I\u2019m so, so sorry,\u201d she began, her voice a reedy whisper. \u201cI had a\u2026 a severe family emergency. With my sister. I had to go. I couldn\u2019t call, there was no signal. It\u2019s been\u2026 awful. I\u2019ve only just managed to sort things out. I\u2019m so sorry to have let everyone down.\u201d\n\nThe performance was flawless. Tamsin\u2019s frantic professionalism immediately softened into gushing, maternal sympathy. \u201cOh, you poor, poor thing! Don\u2019t you apologise for a second! Family comes first, always! Is your sister okay? Is there anything we can do?\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s\u2026 she\u2019s going to be okay,\u201d Ellie said, the lie tasting like ash. \u201cBut Tamsin\u2026 the final. I still want to do it. I need to do it. Can I\u2026 can I still come back?\u201d The effect was instantaneous. The relief in Tamsin\u2019s voice was palpable. The show was saved. Her star was back. \u201cOf course you can! We\u2019ll hold the car! Just get yourself to Paddington Station, we\u2019ll have someone meet you right at the ticket barrier. Oh, Ellie, we\u2019re all so relieved! You\u2019re so brave!\u201d\n\nAfter she hung up, Ellie leaned against the wall, drained. The first lie had been told. The clock was now ticking. Ben drove her to the station through the quiet, grey streets of the awakening city. Imogen sat in the back, a silent, watchful presence. At the drop-off point, Imogen hugged her, a fierce, desperate embrace. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to do this, El,\u201d she whispered into her sister\u2019s hair. \u201cWe can just disappear. Go to Ireland. I\u2019ll change my name.\u201d \u201cAnd let him win?\u201d Ellie whispered back, pulling away to look her in the eye. \u201cNo. I\u2019m tired of running.\u201d She gave Imogen\u2019s hand one last squeeze, then turned and walked into the station without looking back, the automatic doors sliding shut behind her, sealing her off from her old life.\n\nThe return to the machine was a dizzying, disorienting whirlwind. A production assistant met her at the station, shielding her from the curious glances of the public and bundling her into a black car. At the production office, she was met with a flurry of hugs, sympathetic looks, and murmurs of \u201cYou\u2019re so brave.\u201d She repeated her story, the vague, sad tale of a family crisis, until the words felt worn and smooth, a mantra of deception. Then came the meeting about the song. She was ushered into a glass-walled office with Tamsin and the show\u2019s formidable executive producer, a man named Marcus who had the predatory stillness of a patient shark. \u201cEllie, welcome back,\u201d he said, his smile not quite reaching his eyes. \u201cWe\u2019re all delighted you\u2019re safe and ready to perform. Now, the Winner\u2019s Anthem. We\u2019re thinking something triumphant. \u2018The Show Must Go On\u2019. \u2018I\u2019m Still Standing\u2019. Something to celebrate your journey, your resilience.\u201d\n\nThis was it. The critical juncture. Ellie took a breath. \u201cNo,\u201d she said, her voice quiet but firm. The two producers looked at her, surprised. \u201cI appreciate that, Marcus, but after the week I\u2019ve had\u2026 those songs don\u2019t feel true. They feel\u2026 hollow.\u201d \u201cWhat do you have in mind?\u201d Marcus asked, a hint of impatience in his tone. \u201cI want to sing \u2018Sinnerman\u2019,\u201d Ellie said. \u201cThe Nina Simone version.\u201d Tamsin\u2019s face fell. \u201cOh, Ellie, but that\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s so dark. And it\u2019s ten minutes long! We can\u2019t possibly fit that into the live show.\u201d \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be ten minutes,\u201d Ellie countered, her mind racing, feeding off the energy of her own desperate improvisation. \u201cBut it\u2019s about running. It\u2019s about having nowhere left to hide. It\u2019s the story of the last few days of my life. It\u2019s the only honest song I can sing right now.\u201d Marcus steepled his fingers, his shark-like eyes assessing her. He was weighing the commercial risk against the potential for a legendary television \u2018moment\u2019. \u201cIt\u2019s a funeral dirge, not a winner\u2019s anthem,\u201d he said flatly.\n\n\u201cLet me show you,\u201d Ellie said, a reckless impulse taking over. She stood up, and in the sterile, air-conditioned silence of the office, she sang. She didn\u2019t sing the whole song, just the frantic, desperate plea from the heart of it, her voice, raw and ragged with exhaustion and genuine fear, filling the small room. *\u201cSo I ran to the river, it was bleedin\u2019 / I ran to the sea, it was bleedin\u2019 / I ran to the Lord, \u2018Please hide me, Lord\u2019 / Don\u2019t you see me prayin\u2019?\u201d* The sound was not pretty. It was visceral, harrowing, and utterly, undeniably real. When she finished, the silence was absolute. Tamsin had tears in her eyes. Marcus just stared at her, his predatory stillness replaced by a look of profound, calculating awe. He saw the story. He saw the headlines. He saw the awards. \u201cGet her a vocal coach,\u201d he said, a slow, wolfish grin spreading across his face. \u201cAnd get me a new arrangement. I want every single second of that on my show.\u201d\n\nLater that night, alone in the sterile luxury of her hotel room, the full weight of her decision crashed down on her. The city hummed and glittered outside her window, a world away from the silent, menacing darkness of the mountain. She had done it. She had set the wheels in motion. In two days, she would stand on a stage in front of twenty million people and sing a song that was a confession, an accusation, and a declaration of war. She pulled out her phone, the cracked screen glowing in the dark. She opened the photo, the blurry image of the ledger. She looked at her own sister\u2019s name, at the stolen sum beside it. This was not a song choice anymore. It was a promise. It was her verdict. And she was going to deliver it to the world.The two days leading up to the Grand Final were the strangest, most gruelling performance of Ellie\u2019s life, and they took place far from any stage. She was an actress in a one-woman show, playing the role of the \u2018Brave Finalist\u2019 returning from a private tragedy. The hotel, the rehearsal studios, the chauffeured cars\u2014it all formed a gilded cage, a bubble of manufactured reality that was, in its own way, as insidiously false as the community at Gwawr Newydd. Everyone she met, from sound technicians to the other finalists, treated her with a delicate, sympathetic reverence. They offered her sad, knowing smiles and cups of herbal tea, never pressing for details about the \u201cfamily crisis,\u201d but allowing a compassionate silence to hang in the air, a silence which Ellie was expected to fill with grateful, watery-eyed nods. Each act of kindness felt like a betrayal, each sympathetic murmur a fresh layer of deceit. She was a ghost haunting her own public narrative, her mind a split screen: on one side, the smiling, brave face of \u2018The Prof\u2019; on the other, the stark, looping memory of a burning yurt and a face contorted with rage.\n\nThe first battle was fought in the music rehearsal room with the show\u2019s musical director, a wiry, cynical veteran named Milo who had arranged pop songs for three decades and believed he had seen every possible gimmick. He had a three-minute, radio-friendly version of \u201cSinnerman\u201d mapped out, complete with a soaring key change and a potential for backing dancers. Ellie, running on three hours of sleep and a core of pure, unadulterated fury, refused. She didn\u2019t raise her voice. She simply took him through the song, not as a piece of music, but as a text to be deconstructed. \u201cThe song has a clear tripartite structure, Milo,\u201d she began, her voice the calm, authoritative tone of a seminar leader. \u201cIt begins with the protagonist\u2019s realisation of sin, the dawning horror. It needs to start quietly, almost acapella, to establish the isolation. The second act is the frantic, percussive chase\u2014the running to the river, the sea, the rock. That\u2019s where your arrangement is perfect. But the third act, the confrontation with the Devil, the final judgement\u2026 that cannot be triumphant. It has to be an indictment. It has to be cold and damning.\u201d Milo stared at her, his pen hovering over his sheet music, the cynical smirk slowly fading from his face. He had been prepared for a novelty act. He was not prepared for a formal exegesis. \u201cOkay, Professor,\u201d he said slowly, a new, grudging respect in his eyes. \u201cLet\u2019s try it your way.\u201d\n\nHer second battle was with the wardrobe department. They brought her racks of glittering, sequined gowns in gold and silver, fabrics designed to catch the light and scream \u2018Winner\u2019. \u201cWe want you to look like a star, Ellie! A beacon of hope!\u201d the head stylist chirped. Ellie gently pushed the glittering garments aside. \u201cI need something simple,\u201d she said. \u201cDark. Navy blue, or black. Long sleeves. Nothing that distracts from the words.\u201d The stylist\u2019s face fell, her vision of a triumphant Cinderella crushed. \u201cBut\u2026 it\u2019s a final! It\u2019s a celebration!\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a story,\u201d Ellie corrected her gently. \u201cAnd this story doesn\u2019t have a happy ending.\u201d The request was so unusual it had to be kicked upstairs to Marcus, who, to everyone\u2019s surprise, approved it instantly. \u201cGive her whatever she wants,\u201d he\u2019d decreed. \u201cThe woman is a storyteller. Let her tell it.\u201d She was no longer just a contestant; she was a concept, and the machine was recalibrating itself to sell her new, darker brand of authenticity. She was being given the rope, and she prayed it was long enough to hang a con man, and not just herself.\n\nContact with the outside world was sparse and dangerous. Ben\u2019s house had become their mission control. She would find an empty corridor or a deserted fire escape and call, her voice a low murmur. Imogen, sounding stronger and clearer with each call, would answer, her updates a mixture of the mundane and the terrifying. \u201cI\u2019ve eaten a whole pizza, El. And Ben made me alphabetise his collection of eighteenth-century periodicals. I think it\u2019s his version of therapy.\u201d But beneath the forced normality, fear was a constant hum. \u201cHave you seen them? Have they tried to contact you?\u201d Ellie would ask. \u201cNo,\u201d Ben\u2019s voice would cut in, taking over the phone. \u201cNothing. Which is exactly what worries me. I\u2019ve cross-referenced the names in the ledger with public records. A significant number of them are listed as beneficiaries of recent, substantial inheritances. Your sister fits the profile perfectly. He\u2019s not just a charlatan, Ellie, he\u2019s a financial predator with a system. He\u2019ll be lying low, confident that you\u2019re too scared and discredited to be a threat.\u201d His words were a cold comfort, reinforcing the necessity of her insane plan. He was counting on her fear. It was the only variable in his equation that he couldn't control, and she was about to prove his calculations catastrophically wrong.\n\nThe day of the Grand Final dawned grey and oppressive. The air in the studio complex was thick with the electric hum of anticipation. Hairspray, nervous sweat, and the smell of hot television lights created a heady, claustrophobic perfume. Ellie moved through the final hours in a state of hyper-aware detachment. She sat in the makeup chair, a serene smile fixed on her face, as a makeup artist carefully concealed the dark circles under her eyes and spoke in hushed, sympathetic tones about the importance of self-care. She endured a final, brief press call where she spoke vaguely of \u201cdrawing strength from adversity\u201d and the \u201chealing power of music,\u201d the platitudes feeling like stones in her mouth. She saw the other two finalists, a fresh-faced boyband and a powerhouse female vocalist, whispering in a corner, occasionally glancing at her with a mixture of pity and professional curiosity. She was the wild card, the human-interest story, the one whose narrative had eclipsed her talent. They had no idea just how wild the card was that she was about to play.\n\nAn hour before the show went live, Tamsin found her in her dressing room, a small, windowless box filled with flowers from the production company and good-luck cards from strangers. Tamsin was holding a tablet, her face pale. \u201cEllie\u2026 I think you need to see this.\u201d She showed Ellie the screen. It was a news alert from a local Welsh media outlet. *Police Investigating Brecon Beacons Fire Conclude \u2018No Suspicious Circumstances\u2019*. The article quoted an unnamed police source stating the fire at the \u201cisolated off-grid community\u201d was likely caused by a faulty flue on a wood-burning stove. The community\u2019s leader, who was not named, was reportedly \u201cdevastated\u201d by the loss but grateful that no one was harmed. The final sentence was a chilling masterstroke of public relations: *\u201cThe community, which values its privacy, has asked to be left alone to rebuild and heal in peace.\u201d*\n\nHe had done it. With a few phone calls, Brother Sol had cauterized the wound. He had taken control of the narrative, painting himself as the victim and sealing his sanctuary off from any further official scrutiny. A cold, terrifying calm descended over Ellie. The police wouldn't be coming. The law, in its slow, methodical way, had been outmanoeuvred. There was no one left to tell the story but her. She handed the tablet back to Tamsin. \u201cThank you for showing me,\u201d she said, her voice unnervingly steady. Tamsin looked at her, concerned. \u201cAre you alright, Ellie? You\u2019ve gone completely white.\u201d Ellie looked at her reflection in the mirror. The woman looking back was a stranger, her face a pale mask, her eyes burning with a light that looked nothing like stage fright. \u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she said. \u201cActually, I\u2019ve never been more ready.\u201d A knock on the door, and a stage manager\u2019s voice, muffled and distant. \u201cFive minutes to air, Ellie. Five minutes.\u201d The countdown had begun.### Chapter 10\n\nThe five minutes evaporated in a heartbeat. They were a strange, compressed eternity where the world outside her dressing room door ceased to exist. Ellie sat in the artificial silence, the distant, muffled thunder of the live audience a constant, low vibration she could feel in her bones. She was not afraid. The fear had been burned out of her on the mountain, leaving behind a cold, clear certainty. This was not stage fright. This was the chilling focus of a sniper, the calm of a bomb disposal expert. She had one shot, one chance to cut the right wire, and the margin for error was zero. She smoothed the dark fabric of her simple, long-sleeved dress, a stark statement of intent amidst the glitter and bombast of the night. It was a mourning dress. It was combat fatigues. It was the plain, severe robe of a hanging judge.\n\nThe stage manager\u2019s final knock came, and she rose. The walk from the dressing room to the wings was a journey through the grimy, functional guts of the television machine. She moved through a labyrinth of black-painted corridors and thick snaking cables, past crew members with headsets who averted their eyes as if she were a mourner on the way to a funeral. They had all heard the story of the \u2018brave finalist,\u2019 and her somber-clad figure, her face a pale, determined mask, seemed to confirm their narrative. She was a ghost at her own coronation. As she drew closer to the stage, the muffled thunder of the crowd grew into a deafening, physical roar. She could feel the bass of the boyband\u2019s triumphant pop anthem vibrating through the floor, a sound of such synthetic, uncomplicated joy it felt like a message from another planet.\n\nShe reached the wings, a place of organised chaos just beyond the curtain of light. The boyband, five beaming, perfectly coiffed young men, were taking their final bow to a screaming sea of fans. As they ran offstage, flushed with victory and adrenaline, one of them gave her a quick, sympathetic thumbs-up. \u201cBreak a leg, Prof! You got this!\u201d he whispered, before being swept away by a gaggle of producers. Ellie just nodded, her eyes fixed on the stage. She could see the host, a man whose teeth seemed to generate their own light, waiting in the centre. She could see the judges at their long, glowing desk: Chastity Diamond, looking impossibly glamorous and concerned; Julian, the Cowell-wannabe, his arms crossed in a pose of feigned severity; and the third judge, a kindly older musician who would probably weep. They were all pieces on a board, their reactions a predictable part of the machine.\n\n\u201cAnd now,\u201d the host\u2019s voice boomed, amplified to the heavens, \u201ca performer whose journey this season has touched the heart of the nation. She\u2019s faced down adversity with a courage that has inspired us all. After a difficult week, she\u2019s back where she belongs, to sing one final, incredible song. Ladies and gentlemen, give all the love you have to\u2026 The Prof!\u201d The roar of the crowd was a physical blow, a wall of sound and expectation. Ellie took a single, steadying breath and walked from the shadows into the blinding, surgical light. The heat was instantaneous and intense. She felt the gaze of thousands of strangers in the arena, and the silent, unblinking stare of the millions more watching through the lens of a camera that was now gliding towards her. She walked to the centre of the vast, circular stage, a lone, dark figure in a galaxy of swirling lights and manufactured starlight. The host gave her hand a practiced, reassuring squeeze. \u201cWe\u2019re all so glad you\u2019re here, Ellie,\u201d he murmured, just for her and the twenty million people listening. \u201cWhatever happens, you\u2019re already a winner.\u201d She gave him a small, brittle smile and turned to face the microphone.\n\nThe piano began, a single, mournful chord played into a vast, expectant silence. It was not the intro Milo had written. It was the intro she had demanded: stark, isolated, funereal. The lights dimmed, leaving her in a single, tight, white spotlight. The arena, moments before a roaring beast, fell utterly silent. This was not what they were expecting. This was not a celebration. Ellie closed her eyes for a fraction of a second, not to summon courage, but to bring a single image into sharp focus: the ledger, and the list of names. Then she opened them, looked directly into the dark lens of the main camera, and she began to sing. Her voice, alone and unadorned, cut through the silence, not with power, but with a chilling, conversational clarity. *\u201cOh Sinnerman, where you gonna run to? Sinnerman, where you gonna run to? Sinnerman, where you gonna run to? All on that day.\u201d*\n\nIt was not a question. It was a pronouncement. She saw, on the monitors at the side of the stage, the feed cut to the judges\u2019 faces. Confusion was dawning on them. This was not the song of a brave victim. This was the song of a prosecutor. The percussive beat kicked in, a frantic, hunted heartbeat, and Ellie\u2019s body came alive. She was not just singing the words; she was reliving them. When she sang of running to the river, she saw the dark, churning mud of the mountain track. When she sang of the rock crying out \u201cI can\u2019t hide you,\u201d she saw the blank, unwelcoming faces in the Aberglynn pub. Her performance was a frenzy of contained terror, her hands clenched, her body tight with the memory of flight. The camera operators, sensing a seismic shift in the emotional landscape of the show, abandoned their pre-planned swoops and locked their cameras on her face, capturing the raw, unscripted truth of her performance.\n\nThen came the final verse, the confrontation. The frantic beat dropped away, leaving only the cold, tolling piano chords. The lights tightened even further, casting the rest of the stage into shadow. Her voice dropped, losing its frantic edge and taking on a cold, damning weight. *\u201cSo I ran to the Devil, he was waitin\u2019.\u201d* She delivered the line not to the audience, but to the camera, to the man she knew would be watching, drawn by his own arrogance to witness her public humiliation. She could see him, in his new bolthole, his followers gathered around him, his face twisting from smug satisfaction to dawning, horrified realisation. This was not her breakdown. This was his. *\u201cSo I said \u2018Power\u2026 give me Power!\u2019\u201d* Her voice rose, not in a plea, but in a furious, mocking imitation of his greed. Then it dropped again, to a final, deadly whisper, each word a perfectly enunciated bullet. *\u201cAnd the Devil, he\u2019s a-waitin\u2019. And the Devil, he\u2019s a-waitin\u2019. All\u2026 on\u2026 that\u2026 day.\u201d*\n\nThe final piano chord hung in the air, a dissonant, unresolved question. And then, silence. An absolute, unbroken silence that stretched for one second, then two, then five. The arena was a cathedral of stunned stillness. The twenty million people at home leaned closer to their television screens. The applause did not come. The spectacle of television had been shattered, and in its place was a raw, uncomfortable, and terrifying piece of truth. Ellie stood, unmoving, in her single shaft of light, her chest heaving, her eyes still locked on the camera lens. She had thrown her grenade. And now, in the ringing silence, she waited for the world to explode.The first sound to break the spell was a choked, audible gasp, caught on a live microphone. It was Chastity Diamond. The camera, still locked on Ellie, caught the movement at the judges\u2019 desk in the background. Chastity had her hands over her mouth, her perfectly constructed mask of glamour shattered, revealing a woman looking at a terrible, real-world car crash. Julian, the cynic, was leaning forward, his elbows on the desk, his jaw slack. He wasn\u2019t looking at a contestant anymore; he was looking at a phenomenon, a broadcast event so far off the script that it was terrifying and magnificent. The kindly third judge was openly weeping, her face buried in her hands. In the vast, dark auditorium, a few tentative, confused claps started, then sputtered and died, as if the audience collectively understood that applause was the wrong response. It was not a performance to be judged; it was a testimony that had to be witnessed.\n\nThe show\u2019s host, a man programmed for seamless transitions and boundless enthusiasm, was visibly malfunctioning. He took a half-step towards Ellie, his mouth opening and closing silently for a moment before he found his voice. It was strained, a pale imitation of his usual booming confidence. \u201cEllie,\u201d he began, his eyes darting frantically towards the autocue, which was, of course, blank. The producers in his earpiece were likely screaming, a torrent of contradictory commands. \u201cThat was\u2026 that was the most powerful\u2026 the most emotional performance we have ever seen on this stage.\u201d He was trying to wrestle the moment back into the safe, familiar language of television, to frame her raw cry of pain as a ratings-grabbing piece of emotional theatre. \u201cCan you\u2026 can you tell us what that song means to you?\u201d\n\nThis was her moment. Her one, final opening before they cut to a commercial break and buried her story forever. She turned her head slowly, pulling her gaze from the camera lens and fixing it on the host. His reassuring smile was frozen on his face, a rictus of pure panic. She gave him a small, sad shake of her head. \u201cThat song wasn\u2019t for you,\u201d she said, her voice quiet but carrying with absolute authority through the microphone, silencing the few murmurs that had started in the crowd. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t for the judges. It wasn\u2019t for a record contract.\u201d She took a breath, and then she delivered the payload. \u201cThat song was for a man who calls himself Brother Sol. It was for his victims, the people whose lives he has destroyed at a place called Gwawr Newydd, in the Brecon Beacons. People like my sister, Imogen Vance.\u201d\n\nShe said the names clearly, deliberately, turning them from a private horror into a public record. The host\u2019s face went completely white. He was no longer trying to smile. In the production gallery, chaos would have erupted. In Ben\u2019s living room, he would be leaning forward, his work just beginning. In a hidden bolthole somewhere, a predator was hearing his name spoken to the nation. Ellie knew she had only seconds left. She raised her voice, letting the cool, authoritative tone of the lecturer, the expert, take over. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a story. It\u2019s a crime. And there is evidence.\u201d She looked back down the barrel of the camera, speaking now not just to the man in hiding, but to every journalist, every police officer, every person watching. \u201cMy colleague, Dr. Ben Carter, has just created a website. FindMySister.co.uk. On it, you will find a photograph of a ledger. A list of names. The proof of the theft. Please. Find it. Share it. Help them.\u201d\n\nIt was done. She had turned a talent show into a press conference, a grand final into a call to arms. The host, finally receiving a clear, frantic command in his ear, blurted out, \u201cWe\u2026 we have to go to a break!\u201d But it was too late. The sound from the audience was no longer silence or confusion. It was a roar of shock, of outrage, of a thousand people talking at once. It was the sound of the real world crashing through the fourth wall. On the monitors, Ellie saw the feed cut abruptly to a pre-recorded car advertisement, a jarring, nonsensical transition from stark reality to glossy commerce. But on the stage, the chaos was real. Two large men in black suits, the show\u2019s security, were walking briskly towards her from the wings. Tamsin was behind them, her face a mask of utter, uncomprehending shock. The machine was moving to contain her, to remove the source of the malfunction.\n\nAs the security guards reached her, each taking one of her arms in a firm but not unkindly grip, she did not resist. She felt strangely light, hollowed out. She had carried this terrible weight up a mountain and onto a stage, and now she had finally set it down. She risked one last glance at the judges\u2019 desk. Julian was already on his phone. Chastity was being comforted by the third judge. They were no longer part of her story. As she was escorted off the stage, past the stunned crew and the flapping curtains, she heard the first ripples of her actions echoing back from the world. A stagehand, staring at his phone, his eyes wide, looked up at her as she passed. \u201cIt\u2019s true,\u201d he whispered, to no one in particular. \u201cIt\u2019s all over Twitter. The website\u2019s already crashed.\u201d She was led down the dark corridor, a prisoner of the very show she had just detonated. The door to her dressing room was opened, and she was guided inside. The door closed, and she heard the distinct, heavy click of a lock turning. She was alone. In the silence, a single, wild thought broke through. She was in the final of Britain\u2019s Next Star. She wondered if she had won.",

It coated the tweed of her jacket, found its way into the crevices of her leather satchel, and sometimes, she swore, she could taste its dry, mineral tang at the back of her throat as she lectured on the syntactical evolution of Middle English. Her world was one of quiet corridors and the hushed turning of pages in the university library, a world measured in semesters and the patient, slow erosion of ignorance. Wokingham, with its tidy brickwork and polite Saturday market, was the perfect backdrop for such a life. It was a town that didn\u2019t believe in making a scene.\n\nEllie, conversely, was about to make the biggest scene of her life.\n\nIt had started as a dare. A drunken, giddy dare from her sister, Imogen, on a rare night out that had strayed past ten o\u2019clock. \u201cGo on, El,\u201d Imogen had sloshed her gin and tonic, ice cubes clinking a frantic rhythm. \u201cYou\u2019re always humming. You\u2019ve got that big, booming voice you only use when you think no one\u2019s listening. Just send in a video. What\u2019s the worst that could happen?\u201d The worst that could happen, in Ellie\u2019s mind, was a vast and horrifying spectrum of possibilities, starting with mild embarrassment and ending with complete and utter professional ruin. A professor of linguistics, a woman who deconstructed the poetics of Chaucer, belting out an Etta James number for a panel of judges with surgically perfected smiles? The very idea was a category error.\n\nYet, she had done it. Fuelled by a second, uncharacteristic glass of Sauvignon Blanc and the persistent, needling voice of her sister, she had propped her phone against a stack of books (A History of the Schwa, The Canterbury Tales: A Modern Translation), and sung. Not to the phone, but to the memory of her mother, who had filled their childhood home with the sounds of jazz and soul, whose voice had been a warm blanket on cold nights. She sang \u2018At Last\u2019, her voice, surprisingly clear and resonant in the acoustically unforgiving space of her study, filling the room, pushing back against the silent judgment of a thousand bound volumes. She\u2019d sent the video, deleted it immediately from her phone as if to erase the evidence, and tried to forget the entire, mortifying episode.\n\nThe show, \u2018Britain\u2019s Next Star,\u2019 had not forgotten. An email had arrived a week later. An invitation to a preliminary audition in London. Ellie had stared at the subject line \u2013 *Your Journey to Stardom Begins!* \u2013 with the same detached horror she might reserve for a spider crawling across a priceless manuscript. She\u2019d almost deleted it. But Imogen had snatched the phone from her hand. \u201cNo way! You\u2019re going. I\u2019ll come with you. It\u2019ll be a laugh.\u201d\n\nIt hadn\u2019t been a laugh. It had been a blur of fluorescent lighting, trembling hands, and the manufactured encouragement of a production assistant who looked about twelve. But she had sung again. And again. Each time, she expected the journey to end, for the polite dismissal that would send her scuttling back to the comforting obscurity of Wokingham and the passive voice. Each time, she had been waved through to the next round. The producers, it seemed, were fascinated by the novelty. \u2018The Prof,\u2019 they\u2019d nicknamed her. They dressed her in sensible, slightly quirky outfits \u2013 a polka-dot tea dress one week, a sharp blazer with a vintage brooch the next. They filmed segments of her in her natural habitat, looking bewildered amongst the library stacks, a stark, academic bird of paradise in a jungle of vapid pop.\n\nNow, she was in the semi-final. The absurdity had reached a fever pitch. Her students were whispering in the corridors, some with awe, some with ill-concealed mirth. The head of her department, Professor Albright, a man whose fossilised heart was rumoured to beat only in iambic pentameter, had cornered her by the staff room kettle. He\u2019d peered at her over his spectacles. \u201cDr. Vance,\u201d he\u2019d said, his voice a dry rustle. \u201cThis\u2026 extracurricular activity. It is not, I hope, distracting you from your marking?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot at all, Professor,\u201d she\u2019d replied, her smile feeling brittle. \u201cI find it\u2026 creatively stimulating.\u201d\n\nA lie. It was creatively, emotionally, and physically draining. It was a monstrous cuckoo in the neat nest of her life. And yet. There was a secret, shameful thrill to it. Standing on that stage, the hot wash of the lights on her face, the wall of sound from the band, the brief, terrifying silence before she began to sing\u2026 in those moments, she wasn't Dr. Vance, the expert on Anglo-Saxon verb conjugations. She was just a voice. A feeling. It was a liberation so profound it felt like a betrayal of her own carefully constructed identity.\n\nHer phone buzzed, dragging her from her reverie. She was sitting in her usual armchair, the one with the worn floral pattern, a cup of rapidly cooling chamomile tea by her side. Rain lashed against the windowpanes of her small Wokingham semi, a typical Tuesday evening. The phone\u2019s screen lit up with a picture of Imogen, grinning maniacally, a stolen traffic cone perched on her head. The photo was five years old, but it was still Ellie\u2019s favourite. She answered.\n\n\u201cDid you watch? Did you see it? You\u2019re a bloody legend, El!\u201d Imogen\u2019s voice was a crackle of static and excitement, a whirlwind tearing through the quiet of the room.\n\n\u201cI was there, Immy,\u201d Ellie said, a smile pulling at her lips despite herself. \u201cI\u2019m fairly sure I remember performing.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, but did you watch it back? The judges\u2019 faces! That Simon Cowell-wannabe, Julian, he looked like he was going to propose. And the other one, Chastity, she actually cried! You made Chastity Diamond cry! People get knighthoods for less.\u201d\n\nEllie sank deeper into her chair. The show had been recorded two days ago, and she\u2019d spent the intervening forty-eight hours in a state of suspended anxiety, trying to teach a seminar on post-colonial literature while half her mind was replaying every flat note, every clumsy bit of stage banter. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t crying, she was\u2026 emoting for the cameras.\u201d\n\n\u201cNonsense. They were real tears. My sister, the giant-slayer. So. The vote\u2019s in an hour. Are you freaking out? You should be freaking out.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m cultivating an aura of academic detachment,\u201d Ellie said primly.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re chewing your thumbnail to the quick, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\n\nEllie glanced at her hand. She was. \u201cMaybe.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook, whatever happens, you\u2019ve done it. You\u2019ve shaken things up. Dad would have been so proud.\u201d The mention of their father, a quiet man who had loved his wife\u2019s loud music, hung in the air between them. He\u2019d passed away five years ago, a sudden, shocking silence in their lives.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019d have been mortified,\u201d Ellie countered, but her voice was thick. \u201cA Vance on a television talent contest? He\u2019d have written a strongly worded letter to The Times.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019d have secretly recorded it every week and watched it when he thought no one was looking,\u201d Imogen said, and Ellie knew she was right. A comfortable silence settled between them, filled only by the crackle of the line and the drumming of the rain. It was Imogen who broke it, her tone shifting, becoming a little too bright, a little too breezy. \u201cAnyway, listen, El. I might be\u2026 out of touch for a bit.\u201d\n\nEllie\u2019s internal alarms, finely tuned by years of Imogen\u2019s chaos, began to chime. \u201cOut of touch? What does that mean? Are you going away?\u201d\n\n\u201cJust for a little while. A trip. You know. Find myself. That sort of rubbish.\u201d\n\n\u201cImmy, where are you going? Is this about that guy, a\u2026 what\u2019s his name? Rik? The one with the questionable neck tattoos?\u201d Ellie sat up, the chamomile tea forgotten. Imogen\u2019s life was a revolving door of unsuitable men and half-baked plans. She was a firework, dazzling and beautiful but always on the verge of exploding. Ellie was the safety inspector, constantly running after her with a bucket of sand.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be a snob, El. Rik\u2019s a visionary. He\u2019s into\u2026 sustainable living. We\u2019re going to a retreat. Off-grid. In Wales, I think.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou *think*? You\u2019re going off-grid to a place you can only vaguely locate with a man who communicates in grunts?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a man of action, not words,\u201d Imogen said defensively. \u201cUnlike some people\u2019s colleagues.\u201d A dig at Ben, Ellie\u2019s fellow linguistics professor, a man so dedicated to the nuances of language that he could spend twenty minutes debating the placement of a comma. \u201cLook, I just wanted to call and say good luck. I won\u2019t be able to watch the results. No signal, you see. Very rustic. But I\u2019ll be thinking of you. Break a leg. But, you know, not literally.\u201d\n\n\u201cImogen, wait\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cGotta go, El! The yurt awaits! Love you!\u201d\n\nThe line went dead. Ellie stared at the phone, a cold knot of dread tightening in her stomach. A yurt. In Wales. With a man named Rik. It was exactly the sort of thing Imogen would do, and it never, ever ended well. The dread was a familiar companion, a dark shadow that her sister\u2019s vibrant light always seemed to cast. She tried to call back. The number went straight to an automated message. *The mobile phone you are calling is switched off. Please try again later.*\n\nShe tried again. And again. The same metallic voice, the same dead end.\n\nThe chiming of the grandfather clock in the hall jolted her. It was nine o\u2019clock. The results show was starting. On the television, a man with teeth too white for nature began to speak, his voice booming with synthetic excitement. *\u201cLast night, six semi-finalists sang their hearts out. But only THREE can make it through to next week\u2019s spectacular Grand Final! The public have been voting\u2026 and the lines are\u2026 CLOSED!\u201d*\n\nEllie barely heard him. She was scrolling through her contacts, her thumb hovering over Ben\u2019s name. He\u2019d understand. Or at least, he\u2019d listen. But what was there to say? \u2018My sister has run off with a tattooed troglodyte to live in a glorified tent\u2019? He\u2019d just raise a skeptical eyebrow and make a dry comment about the etymology of the word \u2018yurt\u2019.\n\nHer attention was snagged by the screen. They were showing a recap of her performance. There she was, a stranger in a teal-coloured dress, her face pale under the lights. The camera zoomed in as she took a breath, her eyes closing. And then the music started, a slow, mournful piano intro to Nina Simone\u2019s \u2018I Put a Spell on You\u2019. She watched herself, a disconnected observer. She saw the tension in her shoulders, the slight tremble in her hands. But then she saw the change as the voice took over. A power she rarely acknowledged filled the screen, raw and aching. It was a voice full of a longing she barely admitted to herself. The performance ended. The studio audience erupted. On screen, the judge, Chastity, dabbed a perfectly mascaraed eye. Maybe Imogen was right.\n\nThe host was holding a golden envelope. \u201cThe first act through to the Grand Final of Britain\u2019s Next Star\u2026 is\u2026\u201d He milked the pause, his grin stretching impossibly wider. Ellie\u2019s heart hammered against her ribs, a frantic, trapped bird. The dread about Imogen warred with the stupid, dazzling hope of the show. It was a sickening cocktail of emotions. She shouldn't care. It was a silly, frivolous thing. Her life was here, in this quiet, book-lined room. Her work was important. This was just\u2026 noise.\n\nBut she did care. She cared with a childish, desperate intensity that shamed her.\n\n\u201cCongratulations\u2026\u201d the host boomed, tearing open the envelope. \u201cYou\u2019re in the final\u2026\u201d\n\nEllie held her breath, her knuckles white as she gripped her phone. The world seemed to shrink to the dimensions of the television screen.\n\n\u201c\u2026THE PROF!\u201d\n\nThe sound from the TV \u2013 the roar of the crowd, the triumphant blast of music \u2013 was deafening, but Ellie barely registered it. Her own living room was utterly silent, save for the frantic beating of her own heart and the incessant, worrying whisper in her mind. *The mobile phone you are calling is switched off.* A wave of dizziness washed over her. She had made it. She was in the final of Britain\u2019s Next Star. And her sister, the one person who had pushed her into this madness, the one person she needed to tell, was gone. The delight, so sharp and dazzling on the television screen, felt distant and muted, a firework exploding miles away. In its place, the cold dread about Imogen bloomed, dark and chilling, wrapping its tendrils around the fragile stem of her victory. She pressed redial, the useless hope flickering. *The mobile phone you are calling is switched off. Please try again later.* She was in the final. And she was completely, utterly alone."

                                        "text": "The television blared, replaying the moment her name was announced. A camera had been trained on her face in the studio, catching her expression of pure, unadulterated shock. The woman on the screen looked like a stranger, her mouth a perfect 'O' of disbelief before it was subsumed by a shaky, tearful smile. Confetti, shimmering gold and silver, rained down from the ceiling. It was the pinnacle of a fairytale, the climax of the narrative the producers had so carefully crafted. In her quiet living room, Ellie felt none of it. The victory was a hollow echo, the confetti just a mess for someone else to sweep up. Her thumb, raw and sore, pressed the redial button again, an involuntary tic. *The mobile phone you are calling is switched off.*\n\nHer phone, which had been a dead link to her sister, suddenly came alive with a furious, vibrating energy. It buzzed against the worn fabric of the armchair like an angry wasp. The screen became a waterfall of notifications. A WhatsApp group for her department, usually reserved for passive-aggressive reminders about recycling coffee cups, was now a string of exclamation marks and clapping emojis. Emails flooded in, subject lines screaming CONGRATULATIONS!!! from people she hadn\u2019t spoken to in years. It was a digital avalanche of well-wishing, a chorus of voices that knew nothing of yurts, or neck tattoos, or the specific, chilling silence that now occupied the space where her sister's chaotic energy should have been. Each ping felt less like a celebration and more like a stone being thrown against the fragile window of her composure.\n\nBefore she could silence the device, a call came through, the caller ID flashing a London number she recognised from the past few weeks. It was Tamsin, the relentlessly cheerful production assistant. Ellie let it ring four times before answering, the effort of forming a greeting feeling monumental. \u201cHello?\u201d she managed, her voice a reedy whisper.\n\n\u201cEllie! Oh my god, you did it! We\u2019re all screaming here! You are a superstar!\u201d Tamsin\u2019s voice was so high-pitched it threatened to shatter glass. \u201cThe press office is going absolutely mental. We\u2019ve got \u2018Good Morning Britain\u2019 tentatively pencilled in for Thursday, and we need to schedule a costume fitting tomorrow afternoon. And we need to talk song choices for the final! The theme is \u2018Winner\u2019s Anthem\u2019! We\u2019re thinking something huge, something epic! Maybe a bit of Adele? Or something classic like \u2018My Way\u2019? What says \u2018I am The Prof and hear me roar\u2019 to you?\u201d\n\nThe questions pummelled her, a barrage of absurd, trivial details. Winner\u2019s Anthem. Costume fitting. She felt a hysterical laugh bubbling in her chest and ruthlessly suppressed it. \u201cTamsin, I\u2026 thank you. I\u2019m just a little overwhelmed right now.\u201d It was the truth, but not the version Tamsin would understand. \u201cCan we\u2026 can we talk about this tomorrow?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course, of course! You soak it all in! Champagne, I hope? We\u2019ve sent a bottle round to your hotel, by the way. Oh, wait, you went home, didn\u2019t you? Silly me. Well, drink something bubbly anyway! You\u2019ve earned it! Talk tomorrow, star!\u201d The line clicked dead, leaving Ellie in a silence that felt more profound than before. The cuckoo hadn\u2019t just taken over the nest; it was redecorating.\n\nShe threw the phone onto the opposite sofa cushion as if it were contaminated. The anxiety about Imogen, temporarily pushed aside by the phone\u2019s assault, returned with a vengeance, sharp and sickening. For a moment, she was paralysed by the sheer uselessness of her situation. She was a finalist in the country's biggest talent show, yet she couldn't even find her own sister. What good was a voice that could make a nation vote if it couldn\u2019t even get a response from the one person she needed to hear? She mentally scanned a map of Wales, a vast, green, unknowable space. Where would someone even put an off-grid yurt retreat? How would she even start to look? The problem was too big, too nebulous, and her own world of footnotes and historical precedents offered no guide.\n\nHer gaze fell back to the phone. She needed an anchor. She needed a voice that spoke her language. Scrolling past the endless stream of new contacts with job titles like \u2018Publicist\u2019 and \u2018Show Runner\u2019, her thumb found a familiar, unassuming name: *Ben Carter*. Her prediction from earlier echoed in her mind \u2013 the skeptical eyebrow, the dry comment on etymology. But Ben was also logical. He was precise. He solved problems for a living, albeit problems that were usually several centuries old. More than that, he was steady. While her life had become a tempest, Ben was solid ground. Taking a shuddering breath, she pressed the call button. It rang once, twice, a lifeline cast into the dark.\n\n\u201cVance?\u201d His voice was exactly as she\u2019d imagined: calm, a little quizzical, blessedly free of manufactured excitement. There was the sound of a page turning in the background. Of course. \u201cI assume my television has not developed a fault and I did just see you on it. Congratulations are in order, I suppose. Though it does rather throw my theory that the public has no taste whatsoever into disarray.\u201d\n\nThe dry, academic humour was so familiar it almost made her weep with relief. It was a fragment of her real life, her proper life. All the prepared sentences, the attempts to sound normal, evaporated. The carefully constructed dam of Dr. Eleanor Vance finally broke.\n\n\u201cBen,\u201d she said, and her voice cracked, betraying the full weight of her panic. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to call so late. It\u2019s not about the show. It\u2019s Imogen. She\u2019s gone.\u201d"

The imagined sound of a turning page ceased. When Ben spoke again, the dry, academic irony was gone, replaced by a focused calm that was infinitely more comforting. \u201cGone? Vance, what do you mean, gone?\u201d\n\nThe words tumbled out of her, a disorderly, panicked jumble that defied all the syntactical rules she held so dear. She told him about the phone call, the breezy, too-bright tone in Imogen\u2019s voice, the mention of a man named Rik with his questionable tattoos and his vision of sustainable living. The details, which had been merely alarming when rattling inside her own head, sounded utterly insane when spoken aloud to Ben Carter. \u201cA yurt, Ben. She\u2019s gone to live in a yurt. In Wales, she *thinks*. With a man she\u2019s known for what must be a matter of weeks. And her phone is off. She said she\u2019d be out of touch.\u201d The last sentence came out as a whisper of pure dread.\n\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Ben\u2019s voice was a low, steady anchor in the storm of her anxiety. \u201cOkay, Ellie, slow down. Just breathe for a moment.\u201d He called her Ellie, something he rarely did, and the small shift in formality was like a hand on her shoulder. \u201cLet\u2019s be systematic. What, precisely, do we know? His name is Rik. Do you know how he spells it? Any surname?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, just Rik. R-I-K, I assume. Imogen mentioned he was a man of action, not words, which I\u2019ve translated as \u2018illiterate\u2019.\u201d The flash of her usual wit felt brittle, a reflex action that offered no comfort. \u201cI don\u2019t know anything else. He\u2019s a visionary, apparently. A visionary who lures women to collapsible tents in undisclosed locations.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight.\u201d There was a new sound on the line, the soft, rapid clatter of a keyboard. Ben was at his computer. The sound was purposeful, logical. It was the sound of a problem being approached, not surrendered to. \u201cOkay, \u2018Imogen Vance\u2019 and \u2018Rik\u2019. Not a likely search combination. How about \u2018Off-grid yurt retreat Wales\u2019? Let\u2019s see.\u201d Ellie could picture him, leaning forward in his desk chair, his brow furrowed in concentration, applying the same forensic intensity to this modern-day chaos as he would to a disputed Anglo-Saxon manuscript. There was a pause. \u201cUnsurprisingly, that yields\u2026 a lot. It seems going off-grid is a remarkably popular and well-advertised enterprise. It\u2019s a paradox.\u201d\n\nWhile he typed, Ellie\u2019s phone, still lying on the sofa cushion, lit up with a news alert from a major media outlet. The headline was stark against the small screen: *\u2018The Prof\u2019 Sings Her Way To The Final! Shock Favourite Stuns The Judges*. Below it was the photo of her on stage, mid-song, her face a mask of raw emotion. The disconnect was dizzying. Here she was, repackaged as a heart-warming national story, a narrative of hidden talents and second chances. Meanwhile, in the quiet of her own life, a real and terrifying story was unfolding, one with no uplifting soundtrack or slow-motion recap. She felt like a character in two different books at the same time, and she was losing the plot in both.\n\n\u201cDoes your sister have any social media presence?\u201d Ben asked, his voice cutting through her spiralling thoughts. \u201cA Facebook profile? Instagram? She\u2019s a millennial, it\u2019s practically a given.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe is, but she\u2019s\u2026 erratic with it,\u201d Ellie said, forcing herself to focus. \u201cShe\u2019ll post a hundred photos in a week and then disappear for six months. I\u2019ll look.\u201d With trembling fingers, she picked up her phone and navigated to Imogen\u2019s Instagram page. It was a chaotic collage of her life: blurry photos from nights out, artistic shots of her shadow, a picture of a half-eaten plate of chips captioned \u2018Carbicide\u2019. It was so perfectly Imogen that a fresh wave of panic hit Ellie. This was a digital ghost. She scrolled down, her heart thumping, looking for any clue, any tag, any mention of a Rik or a trip to Wales. There was nothing recent. Nothing at all.\n\n\u201cWait,\u201d Ben said suddenly. \u201cI\u2019m on her Facebook. It\u2019s mostly public. She added a new friend three days ago. I\u2019m sending you a screenshot.\u201d Ellie\u2019s phone pinged. She opened the image. It was a profile picture of a man with a shaved head, a thick beard, and a dizzying array of tattoos that crept up from his collar and onto his neck. He was squinting into the sun, a look of profound intensity on his face. The name below the picture read: *Rik \u2018The Root\u2019 Jones*.\n\n\u201c\u2018The Root\u2019?\u201d The name dropped into the silent room with a dead thud. It was so perfectly, dreadfully absurd that Ellie didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry. Ben\u2019s voice was deadpan. \u201cIndeed. A nom de guerre, one presumes. His profile is\u2026 sparse. Lots of pictures of sunsets and mud. A few maxims about \u2018reconnecting with Gaia\u2019 and \u2018unplugging from the matrix\u2019. No location tags, of course. That would defeat the purpose.\u201d\n\nShe stared at the face of Rik \u2018The Root\u2019 Jones, the visionary who had her sister. He didn\u2019t look like a monster. He just looked like a man trying very, very hard to be something he wasn\u2019t, a clich\u00e9 ripped from a brochure about spiritual awakening. And that was almost more frightening. Monsters were easy to understand; deluded idealists were unpredictable. They believed their own press.\n\n\u201cSo what do we do?\u201d Ellie asked, her voice small. The task felt just as impossible as it had ten minutes ago, but the panic had receded slightly, replaced by a cold, sharp-edged resolve.\n\n\u201cFor now, you do nothing,\u201d Ben said, his tone firm. \u201cYou have a television appearance on Thursday, apparently. You need to sleep. I will spend some time cross-referencing Mr. Jones\u2019s friends list with businesses advertising yurt-based spiritual journeys in the greater Welsh area. It\u2019s a long shot, but it\u2019s a data-processing problem. And I\u2019m good at those.\u201d\n\nThe offer was so simple, so practical, so completely Ben. He would trawl the internet for her. He would sit in his quiet, orderly study and search for her chaotic, wandering sister. The relief was so immense it almost buckled her. She wasn\u2019t alone with this anymore. \u201cBen, I\u2026 thank you. I don\u2019t know what to say.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t say anything, Vance,\u201d he replied, the return to her surname a comforting signal that the crisis was now a managed project. \u201cJust try and rest. We\u2019ll speak in the morning.\u201d\n\nAfter they hung up, Ellie sat in the stillness for a long time. The house was quiet again, the only sounds the ticking of the clock and the drumming of the rain. She looked from the screenshot of the intense, bearded face of Rik the Root to the glowing news alert celebrating her unlikely triumph. One was the messy, terrifying truth of her life; the other was the beautiful, simple lie the world wanted to believe. And tomorrow, she would have to wake up and perform the lie, all while the truth was lost somewhere in a field in Wales, sleeping in a yurt."

Ellie awoke with a gasp to a grey, washed-out morning. The rain had ceased, leaving behind a world that looked damp and desaturated. For a single, blissful second, she didn't remember. She was just Dr. Vance, in her own bed, on a Wednesday morning with a seminar to prepare. Then the twin weights of the last twenty-four hours dropped back into place. She was a finalist. Her sister was missing. The two facts felt so grotesquely mismatched, so fundamentally incompatible, that her mind struggled to hold them both at once. Her phone lay on the bedside table where she had left it, a sleeping viper. She stared at it, her heart beginning its familiar, anxious thrum against her ribs.\n\nBefore she could work up the courage to check for a message from Ben, the viper sprang to life. The screen lit up with Tamsin\u2019s name, her cheerfulness somehow radiating through the very pixels. Ellie answered with a sense of grim inevitability. \u201cGood morning, superstar!\u201d The voice was a jolt of caffeine she didn\u2019t want. \u201cHope you\u2019re bright-eyed and bushy-tailed! It\u2019s a huge day! We\u2019ve got a car picking you up at eleven to bring you to London. We\u2019ll start with a quick debrief, then it\u2019s straight into costume with the style team at one. After that, vocal coaching with Melody, and then a big old strategy meeting at four-thirty to brainstorm your Winner\u2019s Anthem. It\u2019s going to be epic!\u201d\n\nThe schedule was a precision-tooled assault on her day, a high-speed train she was expected to board without question. Each item on the list \u2013 costume, coaching, strategy \u2013 felt like a prop in a play she no longer had any interest in performing. An image of Imogen, cold and lost in a Welsh field, flashed through her mind. \u201cYes,\u201d she heard herself say, her voice sounding unnervingly normal. \u201cOf course. Eleven o\u2019clock. I\u2019ll be ready.\u201d It was the first lie of the day, but she had a sinking feeling it would not be the last. Her life was now a matter of performing, both on and off the stage.\n\nShe hung up and immediately dialled Ben\u2019s number. He answered on the first ring, his voice thick with fatigue. \u201cVance.\u201d \u201cBen. Did you\u2026 find anything?\u201d she asked, skipping all pleasantries. There was a rustle of papers, the sound of a man who had not been to bed. \u201cPotentially. I spent the night in the less salubrious corners of the internet. Our Mr. \u2018The Root\u2019 Jones is careful, but he\u2019s also arrogant. He wants to be a guru, and a guru needs a following, even a digital one.\u201d Ben paused, and Ellie heard him take a sip of what was undoubtedly brutally strong coffee. \u201cHe had an old blog. \u2018The Earth-Pulse\u2019. Mostly unreadable poetry about mycelial networks. But, in a post from two years ago, he talks about his \u2018awakening\u2019 under the guidance of a mentor, a man he calls \u2018Brother Sol\u2019.\u201d\n\nEllie\u2019s knuckles were white where she gripped the phone. \u201cBrother Sol?\u201d she repeated, the name tasting like snake oil on her tongue. \u201cAnd does Brother Sol have a real name? An address?\u201d \u201cNo. That would be far too simple. But he is mentioned on a few obscure forums dedicated to alternative lifestyles. He\u2019s said to run a community called \u2018Gwawr Newydd\u2019 \u2013 it\u2019s Welsh for \u2018New Dawn\u2019. They\u2019re strictly anti-technology, completely off-grid. There\u2019s no website, no phone number. But the general consensus is that it\u2019s located somewhere deep in the Brecon Beacons.\u201d\n\nThe Brecon Beacons. A vast, mountainous national park. It was a concrete location, yet it was so large as to be almost meaningless. A needle in a haystack the size of a county. Still, it was a start. A direction. \u201cThank you, Ben,\u201d she said, her voice thick with genuine gratitude. \u201cReally. I owe you.\u201d \u201cJust try not to get yourself into a situation that requires a formal rescue operation, Vance,\u201d he said, a hint of the old dryness returning. \u201cAnd for goodness\u2019 sake, win the bloody thing. It\u2019ll make a better story.\u201d\n\nHer nine a.m. seminar on the sociolinguistics of the Great Vowel Shift seemed like a dispatch from another dimension. How could she possibly stand in front of twenty bright, earnest students and discuss the phonological restructuring of Early Modern English when her own world was deconstructing in real time? She couldn\u2019t. Sitting at her laptop, she typed a brief, formal email to Professor Albright, citing a \u201csevere and unforeseen domestic emergency\u201d that required her immediate attention. It was the truth, stretched and reshaped to fit the contours of professional acceptability. She pressed send before she could change her mind, the action feeling like a small, decisive snip of one of the many threads that tied her to her old life.\n\nHer plan required cash, a road atlas, and a full tank of petrol. The polite Saturday market was in full swing, and Wokingham was out in force, buying artisan cheese and organic vegetables. The anonymity she had always cherished here was gone. \u201cIt\u2019s you!\u201d a woman by the bread stall exclaimed, her voice loud enough to turn heads. \u201cThe Prof! Oh, you have to win! My mother and I are voting for you every week!\u201d Before Ellie could formulate a reply, the woman\u2019s phone was out. \u201cCould we just get a quick photo?\u201d Ellie found herself smiling, a rictus grin of pure panic, as the woman snapped a selfie. The flash felt like an accusation. The photo would show a happy, confident finalist enjoying her newfound fame. It was a perfect, beautiful lie. The encounter left her feeling scraped out and fraudulent, a hollow chocolate Easter egg in a human shell.\n\nBack in the quiet of her house, the two futures laid themselves out before her. One path led east, to a waiting car, to London, to costume fittings and television studios and a chance at a career so bizarrely brilliant she could scarcely comprehend it. The other path led west, into her own ageing hatchback, towards the mountains and the rain and the terrifying unknown. It wasn\u2019t really a choice. The carefully curated world of Dr. Eleanor Vance had been an identity built on caution and quiet intellect. But that person had sung Etta James to a phone propped against a Chaucer translation. That person had already stepped off the path. Her real, non-negotiable duty was not to a panel of judges, but to a wild-haired sister who had dared her to sing in the first place.\n\nHer phone rang again, Tamsin\u2019s name flashing with insistent brightness. It was ten-fifty. The car would be outside. Ellie took a deep, steadying breath, marshalling all the performative skills she had unwittingly acquired over the past few weeks. \u201cTamsin, hi,\u201d she began, injecting a note of pure, theatrical panic into her voice. \u201cIt\u2019s a disaster. An absolute catastrophe. A pipe\u2019s burst in the upstairs bathroom. There\u2019s water coming through the ceiling of my study. It\u2019s pouring all over the books! I can\u2019t possibly leave!\u201d She threw in a few choice details \u2013 a panicked call to a plumber, the threat to her first-edition copy of *Piers Plowman* \u2013 creating a fiction so vivid she almost believed it herself.\n\n\u201cOh, Ellie, you poor thing! That\u2019s awful!\u201d Tamsin\u2019s sympathy was immediate and absolute. The world of television dealt in high drama; a domestic flood was a narrative it could understand. \u201cDon\u2019t you worry about a thing. We\u2019ll rearrange. Just save the books! Let me know when the crisis is averted and you can get a train down. The team sends their love!\u201d\n\nEllie hung up the phone, the silence of her perfectly dry house ringing in her ears. The lie, audacious and complete, had worked. She looked at her leather satchel, a vessel that had only ever known lecture notes and red biros. She emptied it out on the floral armchair, the familiar scent of old paper and chalk dust rising from the worn leather. In place of the books, she packed the atlas, a heavy-duty torch, a protein bar, and a portable phone charger. She pulled on a practical pair of boots and her oldest waterproof jacket, a far cry from the quirky tea dresses chosen by the show's stylists. As she locked the front door behind her, she glanced down the tidy brick street. There was no limousine waiting. There was only her ten-year-old Ford Focus. The scene was made. And this time, it was all hers."

                                        "text": "### Chapter 3\n\nThe Ford Focus felt alien after weeks of being ferried around in blacked-out cars with drivers who called her \u201cma\u2019am\u201d. Here, there was no air-conditioned hush, only the familiar hum of the engine and the squeak of a windscreen wiper she\u2019d been meaning to get fixed for six months. Driving away from Wokingham was like pulling a thread on a perfectly knitted jumper; with every mile that passed, she felt her carefully constructed life unravelling behind her. The neat hedges and polite roundabouts gave way to the brutalist concrete of the M4 corridor, a ribbon of grey tarmac pulling her relentlessly west. Her world had shrunk to the confines of the car, a metal and glass capsule hurtling towards an unknown. The notifications on her phone had fallen silent, her single lie having bought her a temporary, fragile peace. But the silence in the car was louder, filled with the ghost of Imogen\u2019s breezy sign-off and the imagined, bearded face of Rik \u2018The Root\u2019 Jones.\n\nAs she crossed the Severn Bridge, a great iron harp humming in the wind, England fell away behind her. The road signs became bilingual, the soft, lyrical mutations of Welsh appearing above the familiar English. It was a language she understood purely on a theoretical level, a subject of academic papers on linguistic drift and Celtic revivalism. Seeing it now, on a green sign pointing towards Cas-gwent, it felt tangible and foreign, a clear marker that she had passed through a boundary into a place where her own rules no longer applied. The landscape began to swell and darken, the gentle, rolling hills of the home counties replaced by dramatic, cloud-shadowed escarpments. This was a land that did not care for syntactical evolution or television ratings. It was ancient and indifferent, and she felt her own significance shrink with every mile.\n\nThe absurdity of her situation was a constant, low-grade fever. Hours ago, she had been \u2018The Prof,\u2019 a national curiosity, a walking, singing Cinderella story. Now she was a lone woman in a ten-year-old hatchback, armed with a road atlas and the name of a pseudo-mystic called Brother Sol. What would Tamsin, with her clipboard and her talk of \u2018Winner\u2019s Anthems\u2019, make of this? What would Professor Albright, who considered a trip to the Bodleian Library a wild adventure, say about his star lecturer chasing a rumour into the Welsh mountains? She felt a sharp, painful pang of anger at Imogen, hot and quick, for her spectacular, life-derailing foolishness. It was always like this. Imogen would light the fuse, and Ellie would be the one left to deal with the explosion. The anger was swiftly extinguished by a cold wave of fear. This was not a broken-down car or a forgotten rent payment. This felt different. This felt dangerous.\n\nBy mid-afternoon, she had reached the edge of the Brecon Beacons. She pulled off the main road into a small town nestled in a valley, a cluster of grey stone houses huddled together against the vast, empty green of the surrounding fells. Aberglynn. A pub, The Dragon\u2019s Head, stood on the corner of the small market square, a plume of woodsmoke curling from its chimney. It looked like the kind of place where time moved slowly, and secrets were kept. Her life in Wokingham had taught her the value of blending in, of observing from the sidelines. Here, she felt as conspicuous as a flamingo in a flock of sheep. Her London-centric, slightly quirky academic style had been stripped away, leaving her in jeans and a waterproof jacket, a costume that felt just as inauthentic.\n\nInside, the pub was dark and warm, smelling of damp wool, beer, and frying onions. A few old men sat nursing pints at a corner table, their conversation, conducted in the low music of Welsh-inflected English, stopping the moment she walked in. They watched her over their glasses as she approached the bar. The man behind the counter was built like a prop forward, with a florid face and hands that could palm a barrel. Ellie\u2019s heart hammered against her ribs. She was a linguist, a master of nuance and subtext, but the direct, unadorned question she needed to ask felt like a boulder on her tongue. She ordered a lemonade, her voice sounding unnaturally high in the quiet room.\n\nAfter taking a sip of the sweet, fizzy drink, she forced herself to speak. \u201cExcuse me,\u201d she began, her tone a careful mixture of lost tourist and casual enquirer. \u201cI was wondering if you might be able to help me. I\u2019m trying to find some friends. They said they were staying at a sort of retreat nearby, a place called\u2026 Gwawr Newydd?\u201d She let the Welsh name hang in the air, hoping her pronunciation, honed by phonetic charts rather than conversation, wasn\u2019t too jarringly awful. The bartender paused in the act of polishing a glass, his expression unreadable. He looked at her, then at the old men in the corner, a silent communication passing between them. \u201cCan\u2019t say I\u2019ve heard of it,\u201d he said, his voice a flat, unwelcoming rumble. He turned his back to her and resumed his polishing with a pointed finality.\n\nThe dismissal was absolute. A wall had come down, and she was on the wrong side of it. Dejected, she was about to turn and leave when one of the old men at the table cleared his throat. He was wiry and weathered, his face a roadmap of wrinkles, his eyes a sharp, startling blue. \u201cNew Dawn,\u201d he said, his voice a dry rustle, like autumn leaves. \u201cThat\u2019s what they call it in English, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Ellie turned towards him, her heart giving a hopeful leap. \u201cYes. That\u2019s it. Do you know where it is?\u201d The man took a long, slow sip of his pint, his bright eyes appraising her from head to foot. \u201cNot for visitors, that place,\u201d he said slowly. \u201cThey like to be left alone. Came here a few years back. Bought the old sheep farm up on Mynydd Du, the Black Mountain. The one that failed.\u201d\n\nHe gestured vaguely with his chin towards the window, towards the brooding mass of the mountain that dominated the skyline. \u201cYou\u2019ll not find it on a map. You take the road up towards the reservoir. Past the cattle grid, there\u2019s a track breaks off to the left, by a pair of old standing stones. Can\u2019t miss them. But the track\u2019s not fit for a car like that.\u201d He gave her Ford a dismissive glance through the window. \u201cAnd they don\u2019t take kindly to folk just turning up. Especially not\u2026 well-dressed folk from off.\u201d The way he said \u2018off\u2019 made it sound like another country, a place of noise and trouble. He turned back to his companions, the audience over. She had her information. It was more than she had hoped for, but it came with a clear, unspoken warning. Ellie left her lemonade on the bar, the fizz and the falseness of it suddenly unbearable. Outside, the air was cold and sharp. The sun was beginning its descent, painting the undersides of the clouds in shades of bruised purple and orange. She got back in her car and spread the rumpled road atlas across the passenger seat. The Black Mountain. The Reservoir. The standing stones. It was a treasure map to a place that did not want to be found. The urgency to find Imogen warred with the old man\u2019s warning. For a moment, she hesitated. Then she thought of her sister, vibrant and reckless and alone, and the choice was gone. She started the engine, pulling out of the square and onto the narrow road that wound its way up, and up, into the rising darkness of the mountain."

                                        "text": "The road narrowed almost immediately, the thin ribbon of tarmac clinging to the side of the mountain like a stubborn weed. The Ford\u2019s engine, accustomed to the flat civility of the Thames Valley, whined in a low gear as the incline steepened. To her left, the ground fell away into a deep, bracken-choked valley where shadows were already pooling like black ink. To her right, the mountain rose up, a sheer wall of rock and coarse grass. She was no longer in a landscape designed for human convenience. This was a place of older, harsher rules, and her car felt like a fragile, anachronistic toy. The setting sun had lit the horizon on fire, but the flames were dying, leaving behind the cold embers of a purple and grey twilight. The world was losing its colour, and with it, her confidence was leaching away into the vast, indifferent emptiness.\n\nShe almost missed them. In the deepening gloom, they were just two darker shapes against the dark hillside. But a flicker of her headlights caught the lichen-spotted granite, and she slammed on the brakes, the car skidding slightly on the damp road. The standing stones. They were exactly as the old man had described, planted on either side of a muddy track that broke away from the road and vanished into the darkness above. They were not picturesque. They were brutal and immense, ancient teeth jutting from the gums of the earth, silent sentinels guarding a path to nowhere. Ellie switched off the engine, and the sudden, profound silence was terrifying. There was no hum of traffic, no distant siren, only the low moan of the wind rushing through the tall grasses. This was the threshold.\n\nShe got out of the car, and the wind hit her like a physical blow, cold and smelling of rain and damp earth. She looked at the track. It was less a path and more a channel carved by water and the occasional tractor, a treacherous morass of deep, muddy ruts and slick stones. The old man was right; her Focus wouldn't make it twenty yards. For a long, heart-stopping moment, she stood frozen between the two worlds. She looked back down the winding road, a faint, silvery line disappearing into the encroaching night. Down there was safety, reason, a world where pipes burst and TV shows had finals. And then she looked up the track, into the utter blackness where her sister might be. There was no real choice to be made. Taking a deep breath that felt thin and useless in her lungs, she reached into the car, grabbed her leather satchel, and locked the door. The electronic chirp of the central locking sounded absurdly out of place, a final, futile protest from the 21st century.\n\nThe first few steps were a shock. The mud was a living thing, cold and greedy, sucking at her boots and threatening to pull her down with every step. Her body, conditioned by years of pacing lecture theatres and navigating library aisles, protested immediately. A sharp burn ignited in her calves, and her breath came in ragged, misty puffs in the cold air. The comfortable, intellectual detachment of Dr. Vance was useless here. That woman could deconstruct a text, but she had no idea how to read a landscape like this, how to place her feet to avoid the worst of the mire. Here, she was clumsy, weak, and completely out of her element. She was just Ellie, stumbling through the dark, propelled only by a stubborn, terrified love for her sister.\n\nWith the last of the light gone, the world became a terrifying realm of sound and shadow. The wind howled around the tors, carrying with it the mournful cry of a distant sheep. Every rustle in the gorse beside the track sounded like a footstep, every shadow looked like a watching figure. Her phone, a dead weight in her pocket, was no comfort. She was utterly disconnected, a single, struggling point of life in a vast, empty wilderness. The anger at Imogen returned, but this time it was different, a desperate, hollow ache. How could she have chosen this? This bleak emptiness, this man with a nickname, over everything else? Over her? The thought was a shard of ice in her gut, but she pushed it down, focusing only on the next step, and the next, her progress a slow, painful crawl into the heart of the mountain.\n\nShe had been walking for what felt like hours, a mindless rhythm of step and slide, when she saw it. Cresting a small rise, her legs trembling with exhaustion, she stopped dead. Below her, nestled in a shallow, sheltered bowl of the mountain, was a small cluster of pale, round shapes. Yurts. Five of them, arranged in a rough circle around a larger central structure from which a thin tendril of woodsmoke coiled into the star-dusted sky. A few were dimly illuminated from within, the canvas glowing with the soft, flickering light of lamps or candles. They looked like a colony of strange fungi, alien and unsettling against the ancient blackness of the mountain. There was no sound, no movement. It was a picture of absolute stillness, but it was a watchful, unnerving stillness. She had found Gwawr Newydd. She had arrived at the edge of her sister's new world, and it looked more frightening than she could ever have imagined."

                                        "text": "### Chapter 4\n\nFor a long time, she just stood there on the ridge, a cold, wind-lashed ghost looking down on the land of the living dead. The glowing yurts exerted a strange, hypnotic pull, a promise of warmth and light in the crushing dark, but it was a siren\u2019s call. This was not a sanctuary; it was a trap. Her academic mind, trained to dissect and categorise, tried to find a framework for it. A subculture. A social experiment. A cult. The last word landed and stuck, cold and hard. Her exhaustion was a heavy cloak, but the adrenaline of fear was a sharp pin pricking her awake. She couldn't storm in. She had no authority here, no power. She was an intruder, a contamination from the world they had so deliberately escaped. Her only advantage was the darkness. Holding her breath, she began to pick her way down the slick, grassy slope, moving from one patch of deeper shadow to the next, her footsteps silent on the damp turf.\n\nAs she drew closer, the eerie stillness was broken by a low, rhythmic sound emanating from the largest, central yurt. It wasn't music, not exactly. It was a single, deep, resonant hum, a human drone that seemed to vibrate in the very soil beneath her feet. The sound was hypnotic and deeply unsettling, the vocal equivalent of a flickering gaslight. She crept to the edge of the circle of yurts, crouching behind a low gorse bush that tore at her jacket. From here, she could see the entrance to the main structure, its canvas flap tied back. The interior was lit by dozens of candles, their light casting long, dancing shadows. She could make out figures sitting on the floor in a circle, their heads bowed, their bodies swaying slightly in time with the unending hum. She scanned the shapes, her heart pounding, searching for the familiar, chaotic silhouette of her sister. But the figures were anonymous, their identities lost to the shadows and the collective sound.\n\nA canvas flap on one of the smaller yurts to her right was suddenly thrown back, spilling a slice of warm, yellow lantern light onto the muddy ground. A man stepped out, and Ellie instinctively shrank further into the bush, her breath catching in her throat. Even in the gloom, she recognised him from the screenshot. The shaved head, the thick beard, the tattoos coiling up his neck like dark ivy. Rik \u2018The Root\u2019 Jones. He stretched, his back arching, every movement imbued with a self-conscious, cat-like deliberation. He looked up at the sky, breathing in the night air with a theatrical profundity, a man performing the role of being one with nature. Then he froze. His head tilted, his gaze sweeping the darkness beyond the circle of light. Ellie\u2019s heart stopped. He hadn\u2019t seen her, not yet, but he had sensed something. A shift in the air. A foreign presence. He took a slow, deliberate step out of the light, his eyes adjusting, scanning the perimeter.\n\n\"The world sends its little spies, even to the last free places on earth,\" he said, his voice a low, conversational growl directed at the darkness. He wasn't shouting, but the sound carried with unnerving clarity on the wind. \"Come out. You are trespassing on sacred ground.\" Ellie remained frozen, her mind racing. To run was to be hunted. To stay was to be found. She was caught. Taking a shuddering breath that felt like she was inhaling ice, she slowly, deliberately, stood up. Her legs were trembling so violently she was surprised she could stand at all. As she stepped out of the shadow of the gorse bush, Rik\u2019s eyes locked onto hers. There was no surprise in his expression, only a kind of weary, patronising confirmation. \"Ah,\" he said, as if identifying a common garden pest. \"The Professor. Imogen told me you'd have trouble letting go.\"\n\nHis condescension was a lit match on the dry tinder of her fear and fury. \"Where is she?\" Ellie demanded, her voice hard, stripped of all academic politeness. \"I want to see my sister.\" Rik smiled, a slow, infuriatingly serene spreading of his lips. \"Imogen is not a possession to be seen on demand. She is on a journey. She is cleansing. She is shedding the skin of the toxic world you represent. Your world of stress, and noise, and\u2026 chalk dust.\" He said the last two words as if they were a terminal diagnosis, a detail Imogen had clearly shared. \"You can't just come here, with your frantic energy, and disrupt her healing.\" \"Her healing?\" Ellie took a step forward, her fists clenched. \"She's been here a few days! She's not healing, she's hiding. You've brought her to the middle of nowhere and cut her off from everyone!\"\n\n\"I brought her nowhere. She chose to come. She chose peace,\" another voice said, and Ellie spun around. The droning from the central yurt had stopped. Imogen was standing in the entrance, a silhouette against the candlelight. As she walked forward into the lantern light, Ellie\u2019s breath caught in her throat. It was Imogen, but it wasn't. Her wild, flyaway hair was tied back in a neat braid. Her usual uniform of band t-shirts and ripped jeans was gone, replaced by simple, loose-fitting cream trousers and a tunic. Her face, scrubbed clean of make-up, was pale and calm, and her eyes, which usually crackled with manic energy, were placid and still. It was the stillness that terrified Ellie most of all. \"What are you doing here, El?\" Imogen asked, her voice lacking its usual warmth. It was flat, weary, as if Ellie's arrival was not a rescue, but a tedious and predictable complication.\n\n\"What am I doing here? Immy, I've been out of my mind! I drove for hours, I walked up a mountain in the dark! I thought\u2026 I thought something terrible had happened!\" Ellie\u2019s voice cracked with a mixture of relief and hurt. \"Something has happened, El,\" Imogen replied, her gaze unwavering. \"For the first time in my life, I'm happy. I'm calm. I can breathe here.\" She gestured to the vast, empty darkness around them. \"There's no pressure. No expectations. There's just\u2026 this.\" She looked at Rik, a small, beatific smile on her face. \"Rik and Brother Sol, they understand.\" Ellie stared at her, at the serene stranger wearing her sister\u2019s face. \"Imogen, this isn't you. A yurt? A man who calls himself 'The Root'? This is another one of your projects, another phase. But this one is dangerous. These people are cutting you off.\" \"You mean cutting me off from you?\" Imogen shot back, a flicker of the old fire showing through. \"From you calling me every five minutes to check I haven't messed up again? From you looking at me with that worried, disappointed expression? I love you, Ellie, but your love is heavy. It's an anchor. This,\" she said, her voice softening again, \"this is learning to fly.\"\n\nThe insult, that her love was a burden, struck Ellie with the force of a physical blow. All the worry, the sleepless nights, the constant, low-level anxiety she had carried for Imogen her whole life, was being thrown back in her face as a fault. As the sisters stood locked in a painful stalemate, another figure emerged from the central yurt. He was an older man, perhaps in his late sixties, with a mane of long, silver hair and a neatly trimmed beard. He wore a simple, dark-blue robe, and his eyes, as he surveyed the scene, were intelligent and disconcertingly calm. He exuded an aura of quiet, unshakeable authority that made Rik\u2019s posturing look childish. \"It seems our sanctuary has a visitor,\" he said, his voice a rich, soothing baritone. \"Eleanor, is it? Imogen has told us so much about you. I am Brother Sol. Welcome to Gwawr Newydd.\" He smiled, a warm, paternal smile that didn\u2019t reach his watchful eyes. \"You have come a long way. You must be tired and cold. Please, come inside. Join us.\"\n\nThe invitation was smooth as silk, and as strong as a steel chain. It was not a request. Ellie looked from the charismatic leader to the blank, placid face of her sister. She looked at the circle of dark yurts and the endless, crushing blackness of the mountain beyond. She had found Imogen, but she had lost her completely. She was an uninvited guest, a party of one in a hostile land, and they were asking her to come inside. She had no car to escape in, no signal to call for help, and no way of forcing a person to be rescued when they believed they were already saved. She was utterly, terrifyingly trapped."

Brother Sol\u2019s voice was a rich, practiced instrument, tuned to the frequency of persuasion. To refuse his invitation was to declare war, a war she was equipped to fight with semantic arguments but not with boots mired in Welsh mud. To accept was to walk into the belly of the beast. With the hollow eyes of her sister on her and the smug certainty of Rik Jones at her back, Ellie understood that she had run out of road. She gave a single, sharp nod, a gesture of capitulation that cost her a mountain of pride. She was no longer Dr. Vance, expert and authority. She was a supplicant, a problem to be managed.\n\nBrother Sol smiled, a slow, beatific expression of triumph, and gestured for her to precede him. As she stepped over the threshold of the large yurt, the change in atmosphere was dizzying. The raw, howling wind was replaced by a close, encompassing warmth that smelled of woodsmoke, beeswax, and something else, a sweet, cloying herbal scent like boiled nettles. The single, hypnotic drone had fractured back into individual human beings, about a dozen of them, who now sat on threadbare cushions and sheepskins arranged around a pot-bellied stove that glowed a cheerful, malevolent red. They looked up as she entered, their faces, illuminated by the flickering dance of candlelight, uniformly placid. They were young, mostly, with the earnest, searching eyes of people who had traded one set of certainties for another. Imogen drifted away from her side without a word, sinking gracefully onto a cushion between a young man with a wispy beard and a woman with vacant, staring eyes. She had been reabsorbed into the group, leaving Ellie standing alone and exposed in the centre of the circle, a stark, foreign object.\n\n\"Please,\" Brother Sol\u2019s voice was a soft murmur behind her. He guided her to an empty cushion opposite Imogen, the light pressure of his hand on her back both a courtesy and a command. \"You must forgive our humble surroundings. We value simplicity.\" Ellie sat, her exhausted muscles screaming in protest. The cushion was lumpy, and the proximity to the stove made her face feel flushed and hot. She felt like an exhibit in a zoo, the specimen of a frantic, over-complicated species, brought in for the calm inhabitants to observe. Rik settled himself beside Brother Sol, his arms crossed, a smug guard dog at his master\u2019s side. The circle was complete again, with her now sealed inside it. \"Tea,\" Brother Sol announced quietly, and the woman with the vacant eyes rose without a word, moving to a collection of pots near the stove to pour a steaming, dark liquid into a clay mug.\n\n\"Imogen told me you were a scholar,\" Brother Sol began, his tone gentle, conversational, as he settled onto his own cushion. \"A woman of great intellect. Your world is one of facts, of evidence, of neatly ordered arguments. It must be very difficult for you to comprehend a place like this, a place that is governed not by the head, but by the heart.\" He folded his hands in his lap, the picture of serene wisdom. The woman returned and handed Ellie the mug of tea. It smelled strongly of the sweet, herbal scent that filled the yurt. Ellie stared into the murky liquid, her mind screaming at her not to drink it, not to ingest anything, not to cede one more inch of control. She placed it on the floor beside her. Brother Sol\u2019s eyes noted the gesture, a flicker of something\u2014amusement? annoyance?\u2014passing through them before the placid mask returned. \"You fear what you don\u2019t understand, Eleanor. It\u2019s a natural human response. You see your sister, and you think she is lost. But what if she is finally found? What if the life you saw as vibrant was simply the frantic thrashing of a drowning woman, and this,\" he gestured around the candlelit yurt, \"is the shore she has finally reached?\"\n\nThe patronising, infuriating calm of his voice was a fine-honed weapon. He was taking all of her legitimate concerns, all of her love and fear for Imogen, and recasting them as intellectual arrogance, as emotional blindness. And Imogen just sat there, her hands resting in her lap, her expression one of beatific agreement. \"He\u2019s right, El,\" she said, her voice soft, but carrying with devastating force across the circle. \"You always wanted to fix me. You proofread my life, circling all the mistakes in red pen. Here, there are no mistakes. There's no past. I don\u2019t have to be the screw-up little sister anymore.\" The words, so clearly a version of her own private agonies, were now a public indictment, served up for the approval of these strangers. Every frantic phone call, every loan, every time Ellie had dropped everything to pull her out of a mess\u2014all of it had been filed away not as love, but as criticism. The hurt was so sharp, so specific, it stole the air from her lungs.\n\n\"You see?\" Brother Sol\u2019s voice was as soft as a shroud. \"The healing has already begun. But we are not unreasonable people, Eleanor. We are not the prison you imagine us to be.\" He leaned forward, his gaze intense, pinning her in place. \"Your world and your sister\u2019s world have collided. You cannot drag her back, and we would not force you to stay. So I propose a compromise.\" A silence fell over the yurt, broken only by the crackle of the stove. Ellie looked at her sister\u2019s calm, distant face, and knew she was losing, utterly and completely. \"Stay the night,\" Brother Sol said, his voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. \"Stay with us until the sun rises. Eat our food, listen to our silence. See us not as a threat, but as a possibility. In the morning, if you still wish to leave, you are free to do so. And Imogen\u2026 Imogen will make her own choice, as a free woman.\" He sat back, his hands spread wide in a gesture of absolute reasonableness. The offer was a perfectly constructed trap. To refuse was to prove his every accusation: that she was closed-minded, controlling, afraid. To accept was to spend a night in this place, breathing this air, surrounded by these placid, empty faces, playing by their rules on their territory. It was a checkmate, delivered with a gentle smile."

Every instinct, honed by a lifetime of self-preservation and common sense, screamed at her to run, to scramble back up the dark mountain and away from this place of suffocating calm. But to run was to abandon Imogen to this soft-spoken monster and his vacant-eyed disciples. It was to prove him right, to cast herself as the hysteric he so clearly believed her to be. Her intellect, the tool she had always relied upon, was being turned against her, but it was still the only weapon she had. If she could not win by force, she would have to win by strategy. The terror did not recede, but it solidified into something cold and hard: resolve. She was no longer just here to rescue her sister. She was here to understand her enemy.\n\n\u201cFine,\u201d Ellie said, the single word dropping into the quiet like a stone. Her voice was flat, devoid of the emotion they were all expecting. \u201cI\u2019ll stay.\u201d Brother Sol\u2019s smile did not widen; it simply settled, like dust on a forgotten object. He had won this round, and he knew it. Imogen\u2019s expression remained unchanged, a placid mask that betrayed nothing, which was in itself the most terrifying betrayal of all. A quiet sigh of relaxation passed through the circle, as if they had been holding a collective spiritual posture that could now be released. The crisis, it seemed, was over. The wild animal had been coaxed into the enclosure.\n\n\u201cExcellent,\u201d Brother Sol murmured, his voice once again a balm. \u201cA wise decision. We grow our own food here, Eleanor. It is a simple meal, but it is pure. It will help to ground you after your journey.\u201d He made a small gesture, and two of the other members rose silently to ladle a thick, pale vegetable stew into wooden bowls. The ritual was performed with a practiced, unhurried grace that spoke of endless repetition. A bowl was placed before her, its steam carrying the same vaguely sweet, earthy smell as the tea. This was the next test. She looked down at the anonymous mush. It was probably just potatoes and parsnips, a harmless, bland meal. But in this place, nothing felt harmless. It felt like a sacrament, an act of communion she had no desire to join. She looked across the circle at Imogen, who had already begun to eat, lifting the wooden spoon to her mouth with a slow, meditative reverence, as if partaking in the most exquisite feast. The sight decided her. She would not starve, but she would not surrender. She picked up her spoon and took a small, cautious mouthful. It was bland, lukewarm, and tasted of boiled roots and self-righteousness.\n\nAs they ate, in a silence that felt more performative than peaceful, Brother Sol began to speak again, his voice a low, didactic purr. \u201cThe world you come from, Eleanor, is a world of noise. A world of constant, meaningless stimulation. Television shows.\u201d He glanced at her, a knowing glint in his eye, and she felt a hot flush of shame. He knew. Imogen had told him everything. \u201cIt offers the illusion of connection, but it only deepens the isolation. It makes you crave applause from strangers while the people who love you are right beside you, unheard. It teaches you that your own, true voice is not enough.\u201d He was a master, she had to grant him that. He was taking the specific, absurd details of her life and twisting them into a universal spiritual malady, with Gwawr Newydd as the only cure. He was not just trying to keep Imogen; he was actively trying to recruit Ellie.\n\n\u201cBut my voice *is* enough,\u201d Ellie said, her own voice quiet but clear, cutting through his sermon. She placed her spoon down in the half-empty bowl. \u201cMy sister was the one who told me to use it. She was the one who believed in it.\u201d She looked directly at Imogen, willing her to meet her gaze, to remember the giddy, drunken dare, the shared history that predated this place. For a flicker of a second, something shifted in Imogen\u2019s eyes. A flicker of confusion, of memory. Then it was gone, smoothed over by the placid calm. \u201cThat was before I understood what real belief was,\u201d Imogen said, her voice a parroted echo. \u201cThat was before I found my real voice. A quiet one.\u201d The words were Imogen\u2019s, but the syntax, the sentiment, was all Brother Sol\u2019s. He had not just given her new clothes; he had given her a new language, a whole new internal text to recite.\n\nThe meal ended as it began, in silence. The bowls were collected, and a new ritual began. Brother Sol produced a small, hand-carved wooden flute and began to play a simple, haunting melody that wound its way around the warm, close air of the yurt. Some of the others closed their eyes, their heads lolling gently. It was meant to be peaceful, a lullaby for troubled souls, but Ellie found it menacing. It was music as a tool, a sedative. It was the antithesis of the raw, joyful, chaotic noise of Etta James or Nina Simone, the music she and Imogen had been raised on. This was a sound designed to smooth over the rough edges of a personality, to lull the critical mind to sleep. She watched them, her exhaustion a physical pain, and for the first time, she saw the cracks. The woman with the vacant eyes had a faint tremor in her hand. The young man with the wispy beard was staring into the flames of the stove with an intensity that looked less like peace and more like desperation. They were not saved. they were sedated.\n\nFinally, after an eternity, Brother Sol placed his flute down. \u201cIt is time for rest,\u201d he announced. \u201cThe mountain requires you to be strong.\u201d He looked at Ellie. \u201cRik will show you to a guest yurt. We will speak again in the morning light.\u201d The dismissal was final. Rik got to his feet, the smug satisfaction back on his face. \u201cThis way, Professor,\u201d he said, his use of her title a deliberate mockery. Ellie stood, her legs stiff and sore. \u201cImmy,\u201d she said, her voice a plea. \u201cGoodnight, Eleanor,\u201d Imogen replied, not looking at her. The use of her full name was a final, devastating wall between them. She was no longer El. She was a visitor. A stranger.\n\nRik led her out of the warm, cloying yurt and into the biting cold of the night. The wind had picked up, and the stars were gone, hidden behind a thick blanket of cloud. He gestured towards the smallest, most isolated of the yurts, which stood at the very edge of the clearing, its canvas flapping listlessly in the wind. Inside, it was stark and cold. A simple cot with a thin mattress and a pile of rough blankets was the only furniture. A single, unlit lantern sat on the floor. \u201cSleep well,\u201d Rik said from the doorway, his silhouette blocking out what little light there was. \u201cThe mountain has a way of clearing the head.\u201d He then pulled the canvas flap shut, and Ellie was plunged into absolute darkness, the sound of his footsteps crunching away on the stony ground a final, departing punctuation. She stood there for a full minute, her heart hammering, listening to the wind howl and the canvas strain against its ropes. She was alone, unarmed, and miles from anyone who knew her name was anything other than \u2018The Prof\u2019. The absurdity was so profound it bordered on hysteria. She had to choose a song for the final. A Winner\u2019s Anthem. In the freezing, pitch-black silence of the yurt, a single, wild, inappropriate bubble of laughter escaped her lips before she choked it back, swallowing it like a sob."

                                        "text": "The laugh died in her throat, strangled by the raw, biting cold that seemed to radiate from the very ground beneath her feet. The darkness was absolute, a physical pressure on her eyes. For a moment, she was nothing but a collection of frantic senses: the rough weave of the canvas flapping violently just inches from her face, the howl of the wind like a hungry animal, the metallic taste of fear in her mouth. She fumbled in her satchel, her numb fingers closing around the reassuring, cylindrical shape of her torch. The sudden, piercingly bright beam of white LED light was a violent intrusion, an act of technological defiance in this self-consciously primitive world. It sliced through the gloom, revealing the stark reality of her prison. The yurt was barely eight feet across, the canvas walls stained with mildew. The cot was a simple wooden frame, the blankets a pile of coarse, unwashed wool. The only way out was the entrance flap, secured from the outside by a simple leather thong tied in a knot. She was not a guest being offered shelter; she was a package that had been received and stored.\n\nHer academic detachment, the very quality she had joked about with Imogen over the phone in what felt like another lifetime, descended on her now as a survival mechanism. Panic was a luxury she could not afford. She began to dissect her situation with the same cold precision she would apply to a flawed thesis. Premise: Brother Sol was not a spiritual guide but a predator. Evidence: the practiced manipulation, the isolation tactics, the cloying, uniform serenity of his followers. Hypothesis: the 'compromise' was a trap. He had no intention of letting Imogen make a free choice in the morning. The purpose of the night was to disorient and exhaust her, the sole dissenting voice, until she was too broken to argue effectively. The morning would not be a discussion; it would be a public performance of her failure, designed to cement Imogen\u2019s loyalty and reinforce his own power. Waiting for sunrise was not just passive; it was suicidal.\n\nThe plan formed in her mind, a sharp, clear counter-argument to Brother Sol\u2019s suffocating narrative. She would not sleep. She would not wait to be ritually humiliated. She was a researcher, and this was an unsanctioned, high-stakes piece of fieldwork. She needed data. She needed leverage. She needed something that could shatter the fragile, carefully constructed reality of Gwawr Newydd. Her gaze fell on her satchel. She laid its contents on the thin mattress: the road atlas, the protein bar, the now-useless phone charger, and the heavy-duty torch. The torch was her only tool. Its bright, unwavering beam felt like an extension of her own will, a projection of reason into a world of murky belief. She had to get out of the yurt. She had to observe them when they believed they were unobserved.\n\nThe wind was her ally. It battered the canvas walls with such ferocity that any small noise she made would be swallowed by the gale. She crept to the flap, her heart a frantic drum against her ribs. The leather thong was tied in a complex, self-tightening knot, designed to be opened from the outside. Her fingers, stiff with cold, fumbled with the knot, picking at it with her raw thumbnail. For a frustrating minute, it held fast, a simple, infuriating puzzle. Then, with a final, desperate tug, it loosened. She paused, listening, but there was only the wind. She slowly, carefully, pulled the flap inwards, creating a narrow gap. A blast of freezing, rain-laced air hit her face. Peering out, she saw that the main yurt was still glowing, but the other smaller yurts were dark. She had to assume they were all occupied. Her own yurt, the \u2018guest\u2019 quarters, was deliberately placed at the furthest edge of the circle, a quarantine zone. It gave her a precious few yards of open, unlit ground. Taking a deep, shuddering breath, she slipped out into the night, pulling the flap closed behind her. The cold was a shock that stole her breath, but it was a clean cold, a vast and honest cold, and it felt infinitely better than the close, herbal warmth of the central yurt.\n\nCrouching low, she scurried across the open ground to the shadow of the next yurt in the circle, pressing her back against its cold, damp canvas. From here, she had a partial view of the entire compound. She needed a target. The main yurt was a possibility, but it was too populated, too risky. Her mind raced, creating a mental map of the power structure. Rik was the muscle, but Brother Sol was the brain. And the brain of any operation requires an office, a place to think, to plan, to keep its secrets. She scanned the remaining yurts. One stood slightly apart from the others, on a small, raised patch of ground that gave it a commanding view of the small community. It was no larger than the rest, but its placement spoke of status. That had to be his. That was her destination.\n\nThe journey from one shadow to the next was the longest hundred yards of her life. The ground was treacherous, a mixture of slippery grass and loose stones that threatened to betray her with every step. She moved in short, breathless bursts, her torch off, her eyes straining in the profound darkness. The wind whipped her hair across her face and tore at her jacket. Twice she froze as the cry of a sheep echoed across the valley, mistaking it for a human shout. Finally, she reached it, pressing herself against the canvas of Brother Sol\u2019s yurt. She held her breath and listened. There was no sound from within, only the incessant drumming of the wind. Taking a risk that made her stomach clench with fear, she crept around to the entrance flap. It was untied. With infinite slowness, she lifted a corner and peered inside. It was empty.\n\nSlipping inside, she was met not with the spartan simplicity she expected, but with the subtle signs of a hidden life. While a simple cot and a few sheepskins occupied one side of the space, the other was arranged as a workspace. A small, handcrafted wooden desk stood against the wall, and beside it, a heavy, iron-bound wooden chest. The air lacked the cloying herbal scent of the main yurt; it smelled only of canvas and old wood. This was the nerve centre. The facade of a simple man living a simple life was a lie. This was the office of a CEO. Her torch beam, shielded and narrowed by her cupped hand, darted around the space. The desk drawers were unlocked but contained nothing more than spare candles and bundles of dried herbs, a piece of stage-dressing. The chest was the real prize. It was secured with a heavy, ornate padlock. She swore silently. Her search had hit a dead end. Despair began to prick at the edges of her resolve. Then her light caught a glint of something on the floor, half-tucked under the edge of the sheepskin rug beside the cot. A small, brass key on a loop of leather cord. It was a careless, arrogant mistake, the kind of mistake made by a man who believed himself to be untouchable.\n\nHer hands were trembling so badly she could barely fit the key into the lock. It turned with a loud, grating click that sounded, in the silence, like a gunshot. She froze, listening, but there was only the wind. She lifted the heavy lid of the chest, her torch beam dipping inside. Her breath caught in her throat. There were no spiritual texts, no sacred objects. The chest was filled with the profane relics of the world he claimed to despise. There were neat, tight bundles of fifty-pound notes, thousands of them. There was a satellite phone and a portable solar charger. And beneath them, a thick, leather-bound ledger. She lifted it out, her fingers numb. She opened it to the first page. It was a meticulously detailed accounting book. Down the left-hand column was a list of names, twenty or thirty of them, dating back three years. Beside each name was a column titled \u2018Initial Investment\u2019 and a series of columns for \u2018Monthly Tithe\u2019. She ran her finger down the list of names until she found it, written in Brother Sol\u2019s elegant, looping script: *Imogen Vance*. Next to her name, in the \u2018Initial Investment\u2019 column, was a figure that made Ellie feel physically sick: \u00a340,000. It was the exact amount Imogen had inherited when their mother passed away, money Ellie had begged her to put aside for a deposit on a flat. It wasn't a community; it was a liquidation. He was stripping these lost, lonely people of everything they had. The cold, academic fury solidified into a pure, white-hot rage. This man hadn't just taken her sister; he had plundered her. As this single, devastating truth exploded in her mind, a sound from outside cut through the howl of the wind. It was the distinct, unmistakable crunch of heavy boots on the gravel path, coming closer. And they were heading directly for this yurt."

The ledger felt like a tombstone in her hand, the torch a confession. Her mind, a finely tuned instrument for textual analysis, now became a frantic machine for tactical survival. Hiding was impossible; the yurt was a drum, and she was the pea about to be discovered inside it. She couldn't run. But she could fight, not with her fists, but with her data. The ledger was too heavy, too conspicuous to take, but the information within it was weightless. Her phone. The thought was a spark in the black terror. Her fingers, clumsy with cold and fear, scrambled in her satchel, closing around the smooth, cool glass and metal rectangle. With a surge of adrenaline that made her vision swim, she jabbed the screen to life. The sudden, invasive brightness of the display felt like a betrayal, a beacon signalling her presence.\n\nThe footsteps stopped directly outside the flap. There was a pause, a moment of dreadful stillness where the only sound was the screaming wind. Her thumb, slick with nervous sweat, swiped and tapped, opening the camera app. She aimed the phone at the ledger, the viewfinder a small, chaotic rectangle of her shaking hands, the flickering torchlight, and the damning, elegant script. She fought to steady her hand, to bring the words into focus: *Imogen Vance\u2026 \u00a340,000*. A shadow fell across the canvas flap. A hand was reaching for the tie. She jabbed the shutter icon. The phone registered the capture with a subtle, haptic buzz that felt like an electric shock. With no time to check the image, she shoved the phone deep into the inner pocket of her jacket, zipping it shut. The ledger was still clutched in her other hand as the canvas flap was ripped open with a violent tearing sound.\n\nIt was Brother Sol. The wind billowed in around him, throwing the candlelight on his desk into a frenzy and threatening to extinguish it. He stood framed in the entrance, a dark, broad silhouette against the turbulent night. The beam of Ellie's torch, held in her trembling hand, caught his face, and she saw that the guru was gone. The paternal warmth, the serene wisdom, had been burned away, leaving behind something hard, cold, and reptilian. His eyes were not disappointed or sad; they were filled with a flat, murderous fury. For a long, stretched second, neither of them moved. It was a tableau of discovery: the thief, the evidence, and the avenging academic caught in the act. The wind howled through the yurt, a chorus for the drama about to unfold.\n\n\u201cYou have a deep-seated need to trespass,\u201d he said, his voice no longer a soothing baritone but a low, dangerous gravel. He took a step inside, letting the flap fall closed behind him, plunging them into the intimate, suffocating space. He looked from her face to the ledger in her hand, then to the open, plundered chest. \u201cA scholar\u2019s curiosity, I presume?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m a linguist,\u201d Ellie shot back, her own voice sharp and brittle, forged in the terror of the last few minutes. \u201cI specialise in rooting out fraudulent narratives. And this,\u201d she held the ledger up, the heavy book a shield between them, \u201cis a masterpiece of the genre. Tell me, is \u2018Brother Sol\u2019 the name you were born with, or is it just a trading name for your business?\u201d She was goading him, pulling the argument onto her own intellectual turf, the only ground where she had ever felt secure.\n\nHe laughed, a short, ugly bark that held no humour. \u201cYou think you\u2019re clever. You think your little words and your degrees give you power here.\u201d He began to advance on her slowly, his movements measured, predatory. The tight space of the yurt shrank around them. \u201cThese people are broken. The world you champion broke them. I give them a story they can live in. I give them peace. They give me what they no longer need. It\u2019s the oldest transaction in the world, Professor. It\u2019s called faith.\u201d \u201cYou call it faith, I call it theft,\u201d Ellie retorted, backing away until her legs hit the wooden frame of the cot. \u201cYou took my sister\u2019s inheritance. Forty thousand pounds. That wasn't a tithe. That was her future. You stole it.\u201d \u201cShe invested it!\u201d he roared, his composure finally cracking, his face contorting with rage. \u201cShe invested it in her own salvation!\u201d\n\nHe lunged, not at her, but at the ledger. Ellie reacted instinctively, twisting away, but he was faster, stronger. His hand clamped around her wrist, his grip like iron. The torch fell from her hand, rolling across the floor and casting wild, spinning shadows across the canvas walls. A sharp, searing pain shot up her arm. He wrenched the ledger from her grasp with a grunt of triumph. \u201cYou have seen nothing,\u201d he hissed, his face inches from hers, his breath sour. \u201cYou are a hysterical woman who got lost on a mountain. No one will believe you.\u201d \u201cThey won\u2019t have to,\u201d Ellie gasped, the pain in her wrist making her dizzy. She thought of the phone, safe in her zipped pocket, a secret victory. The thought must have shown on her face, because his eyes narrowed. His gaze dropped from her face to her jacket, to the slight, rectangular bulge of the inner pocket. A new, dawning horror washed over Ellie as she realised her mistake. He hadn't known. Now he did. With his free hand, he reached for her jacket. \u201cGive it to me,\u201d he snarled. As Ellie began to struggle in earnest, a frantic, desperate fight for the last piece of evidence she possessed, a voice called from outside, sharp with alarm. \u201cSol? Is everything alright?\u201d The flap was pulled open again, and Rik stood there, his bulk filling the doorway, his face a mask of confusion that quickly hardened as he took in the scene: Brother Sol grappling with a terrified Ellie, the fallen torch, the open chest. The odds had just become impossible."

                                        "text": "Rik\u2019s arrival was the closing of the steel trap. The brief, flicker of confusion on his face was instantly extinguished, replaced by a dull, brutish certainty as Brother Sol, a master of immediate narrative control, gave him his script. \u201cRik! She is an infection!\u201d Sol snarled, his grip tightening painfully on Ellie\u2019s wrist. \u201cShe came here to desecrate this place, to destroy what we have built! She is trying to steal from us!\u201d The accusation was a perfect inversion of the truth, and Rik absorbed it without question. His loyalty was not to reason, but to the man who had given him a purpose, and that purpose was now to subdue the threat. He moved forward into the yurt, his large frame blocking the exit completely, his face set in a mask of righteous anger.\n\nThe fight became a frantic, desperate scrabble in the claustrophobic space. Rik grabbed Ellie\u2019s other arm, his powerful hands easily overpowering her resistance. She was trapped between them, a doll being torn apart. Sol, his face contorted in a venomous sneer, abandoned her wrist and went directly for her jacket, his fingers scrabbling at the zip of the inner pocket. Ellie twisted and kicked, her academic mind replaced by a primal, cornered-animal instinct to protect her young. The phone was her only cub, her only proof, the only thing that gave this entire nightmare meaning. \"He's the thief!\" she screamed, the words torn from her throat, directed not at Sol but at Rik. \"He's lying to you! He stole my sister's money! He's stealing from all of you! Check the book!\"\n\nIt was in that chaotic, violent moment of struggle that the world tilted. Whether it was Ellie\u2019s flailing leg or Sol\u2019s clumsy lunge, a heavy boot connected with the small wooden desk. The delicate balance was broken. The desk tipped, scattering its contents\u2014candles, dried herbs, a half-empty mug\u2014across the floor. One of the lit candles, a thick stub of beeswax, rolled under the edge of the cot and came to rest against the pile of dry, oily sheepskins. For a single, horrifying second, nothing happened. Then, a tiny orange flame, no bigger than a thumbnail, licked at a strand of wool. It hesitated, then bloomed with an eager, hungry life.\n\nThe fire did not grow; it exploded. The tinder-dry wool and the resins in the wood of the cot ignited with a terrifying \u2018whoosh\u2019. A wall of sudden, intense heat blasted through the yurt, forcing Sol and Rik to recoil with curses of pain and shock. Black, acrid smoke billowed upwards, instantly filling the small space. The roar of the flames joined the howl of the wind, creating a deafening, hellish symphony. The struggle for the phone was forgotten, replaced by the more immediate, primal fear of being burned alive. Sol, his face a mask of disbelief and fury at this turn of events, scrambled for the ledger, snatching it from the floor where it had fallen near the spreading flames. Rik, momentarily stunned, backed away towards the entrance. The spell was broken. The sanctuary was on fire. And Ellie was, for the first time, free.\n\nShe didn't hesitate. In the smoke and confusion, as Sol and Rik were blinded and choking, she wrenched herself free of their loosened grips. She stumbled backwards, her lungs screaming for air, her eyes streaming. The fire was now a roaring furnace, climbing the canvas walls with terrifying speed, turning the entire structure into a giant, glowing lantern of destruction. She scrambled out of the entrance flap, gulping in the clean, freezing, rain-laced air, and fell to her knees on the muddy ground, coughing and gasping. The fire was a beacon on the dark mountain, a funeral pyre for Gwawr Newydd. From the other yurts, doors were being thrown open, and confused, sleepy figures were emerging, their faces lit by the terrifying orange glow. Shouts of alarm and panic cut through the night. And then she saw her. Imogen. She was standing outside her own yurt, her hand to her mouth, her face a canvas of utter horror and disbelief. Her placid calm was shattered, replaced by a raw, naked terror as she stared at the inferno that had been Brother Sol\u2019s sanctum. Her eyes, wide and wild, left the fire and found Ellie, smoke-stained, dishevelled, and gasping for air, emerging from the heart of the flames like a vengeful spirit."

The inferno behind Ellie painted her in demonic light, the wind whipping her hair into a wild halo, her face streaked with soot. To Imogen, standing frozen in the clearing, the serene, controlled world of Gwawr Newydd had been ripped open, revealing a roaring, chaotic hell. And from the heart of that hell had walked her sister. The woman she had accused of being an anchor, a weight, had just torn through the fabric of her new reality. In Imogen\u2019s eyes, the placid emptiness of the last few days was being burned away, replaced by the old, familiar terror, but this time it was clear, sharp, and directed at the right people. Her lips formed a single, broken word, a name that was a question, an apology, and a plea all at once. \"El...\"\n\nBefore Ellie could respond, before she could close the distance between them, Brother Sol exploded from the burning yurt, a creature of pure, unrestrained fury. He clutched the heavy ledger to his chest like a holy text, his silver hair wild, his robes stained with soot, his face a mask of rage that was far more terrifying than any serene smile. Rik was a step behind him, a bewildered but obedient bull. The remaining followers, drawn from their sleep by the light and the noise, were a panicked, confused flock, their faces illuminated by the destruction of their sanctuary. Sol raised a trembling, accusatory hand, pointing it directly at Ellie. \"She did this!\" he bellowed, his voice raw, stripped of all its soothing artifice. \"The outsider! The poison! She came here to destroy our peace! To burn us from our home! Don't let her escape!\"\n\nThe command hung in the air, a final, desperate attempt to reassert control. The followers hesitated, caught between the instinct to flee the fire and the ingrained habit of obedience. But it was Imogen who acted. She saw it all in that one, horrifying instant: the man of peace revealed as a screaming, vengeful tyrant, and the sister who she had rejected, smoke-stained and desperate, who had walked through fire for her. The choice was not a choice at all; it was a violent realignment of her entire world. With a strangled cry that was part sob, part war cry, she broke from her frozen stance. She did not run from the chaos. She ran directly into it, straight towards Ellie. Her hand, cold and trembling, found Ellie\u2019s and gripped it with a fierce, desperate strength. \"Run, El!\" she screamed, her voice raw with terror and a lifetime of unspoken apologies. \"Just run!\"\n\nChaos was their cover. Ellie, yanked into motion by Imogen\u2019s sudden, decisive action, plunged with her into the darkness at the edge of the clearing. They scrambled up the steep, muddy bank that led back towards the track, their feet slipping, their lungs burning. The roar of the fire behind them was a physical pressure, and the shouts of Sol and Rik were sharp and clear above the din. \"Get them! Don't let them reach the road!\" The fire that had saved Ellie now betrayed her, lighting up their frantic escape, making them stark, running silhouettes against the dark hillside. They were utterly exposed. Ellie risked a glance back and saw Rik, his powerful frame built for this kind of terrain, already starting up the slope after them, his face a grim mask of determination.\n\nTheir flight down the mountain was a terrifying, stumbling parody of Ellie's ascent. The path was a treacherous stream of mud and loose rock, made slick by the rain that had begun to fall in earnest, a cold, stinging curtain against their faces. They were running blind, guided only by the memory of the path and the frantic, animal need to escape. Ellie\u2019s body, already pushed past its limits, screamed in protest. Her legs were leaden, her breath a series of ragged, tearing gasps. But Imogen, whose life had been a series of sprints away from self-made disasters, was in her element. She pulled Ellie along, her grip like a vice, navigating the treacherous path with a reckless, instinctive energy. The heavy, pounding footsteps behind them grew louder, a relentless drumbeat counting down the seconds until they were caught.\n\n\"He knows about the phone!\" Ellie gasped, the words wrenched from her as they half-fell, half-slid down a steep, gravelly section of the track. \"I have proof, Immy! I have it on my phone!\" Imogen didn't look back. The information seemed to galvanize her, lending a new, steely desperation to her flight. It wasn't just an escape anymore; it was a mission. They had to get the evidence out. They had to expose him. The darkness, which had been so terrifying on the way up, was now their only true friend. They rounded a sharp bend in the track, plunging them momentarily out of the fire's direct light. Ahead, the world was a uniform, impenetrable black, the path ahead a matter of pure faith. Behind them, they heard Rik\u2019s furious grunt as he stumbled, buying them a few precious seconds. They were no longer the academic and the screw-up. They were two women running for their lives down a dark mountain, carrying a single, fragile spark of truth, with the monsters closing in behind them."

The wind and rain were a united force, lashing at their faces, stealing their breath, and turning the track into a slick, treacherous river of mud. Every step was a gamble. Rocks, loosened by the downpour, shifted and rolled under their feet. The air burned in Ellie\u2019s lungs, a raw, acidic fire that was more painful than the protesting scream of her muscles. She was a liability, a dead weight, and she knew it. The intellectual stamina that could see her through a fourteen-hour archival session was useless here; her body was a foreign country, and its government was in full-scale revolt. It was Imogen who kept them moving, her grip on Ellie\u2019s hand an unbreakable, live wire of energy. She moved with a desperate, animal grace, her feet finding purchase where Ellie saw only black, churning mire.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t look back, El! Just breathe! In through your nose, out through your mouth. Like we used to do, running for the bus!\u201d Imogen\u2019s voice was a ragged gasp beside her, but it was a commander\u2019s gasp, a leader\u2019s. It was a jarring, disorienting role reversal. For their entire lives, Ellie had been the planner, the navigator, the one who saw the pitfalls and steered them to safety. Now, in this raw, elemental chaos, Imogen was the one in charge. All her years of running from bad decisions, of scrambling away from the consequences of her own impulsive nature, had, it seemed, been a kind of brutal, unorthodox training. She knew how to flee. The heavy, rhythmic pounding of Rik\u2019s pursuit was a terrifyingly constant bass note to the high-pitched shriek of the wind. He was not tiring. The mountain was his home, and he was simply walking it, while they were being broken by it.\n\n\u201cDown!\u201d Imogen hissed, the command so sudden and sharp that Ellie obeyed without thinking. Imogen yanked her sideways, pulling her off the relative clarity of the track and into a thick, tangled mass of gorse and bracken. They fell, tumbling a few feet down a steep, muddy bank, the thorny branches tearing at their clothes and skin. They came to a halt in a sodden, earthy heap, shielded from the path by a dense curtain of foliage. \u201cDon't move. Don\u2019t even breathe,\u201d Imogen whispered, her mouth right by Ellie\u2019s ear. A few seconds later, Rik\u2019s heavy form pounded past their hiding place, a dark shape moving with relentless, brutish purpose down the track. He didn\u2019t even break his stride. In the darkness, he hadn\u2019t seen them veer off. They had bought themselves a handful of seconds, nothing more.\n\nHuddled together in the freezing, wet darkness, the world was a cacophony of their own ragged breathing and the frantic, terrified thumping of their hearts. The gorse thorns dug into Ellie\u2019s back, a series of small, sharp anchors to their terrifying reality. \u201cHe\u2019s a machine,\u201d Ellie gasped, her body trembling with a combination of cold, exhaustion, and pure terror. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to make it.\u201d Imogen squeezed her hand, a fierce, reassuring pressure. \u201cYes, we are,\u201d she whispered back, her voice shaking but laced with a core of steel Ellie had never heard before. \u201cYou didn\u2019t walk up a bloody mountain and walk out of a fire just to get caught now, El. You have the phone. You have the proof. We\u2019re getting out.\u201d She looked at Ellie then, her eyes, just visible in the gloom, wide and stripped of all pretense. \u201cYou came for me. You actually came.\u201d The statement was not an accusation, but a marvel, a discovery. Before Ellie could answer, a furious roar echoed up from further down the track. Rik had reached the spot where the path flattened out and realised he had lost them. He knew they had to be hiding somewhere between. The footsteps started again, slower this time, more deliberate. He was hunting them now.\n\n\"He'll check the sides,\" Ellie whispered, her strategic mind kicking back into gear through the fog of exhaustion. \"He'll comb the whole area. We can't stay here.\" Imogen nodded, her eyes darting into the darkness around them. \"Then we don't use the path,\" she said, her voice low and decisive. \"We go straight down. It's steeper, but he'll expect us to stick to the track.\" It was a reckless, insane plan, a direct plunge through uncharted, treacherous terrain in the pitch black. It was exactly the kind of plan Imogen would come up with. And it was their only hope. Pushing themselves up, ignoring the scrapes and the pain, they turned their backs on the track and began to fight their way directly down the mountainside, a desperate, near-vertical scramble through thorns, slick grass, and loose shale.\n\nIt was a nightmare of controlled falling, of grabbing at thin air and tough, rooted heather to slow their descent. Their world was a blur of mud, pain, and the frantic, whipping sting of rain on their faces. They were no longer running, but surviving, moving on pure, animal instinct. And then, through the driving rain, they saw them. Two immense, black shapes, starker than the surrounding darkness, loomed up before them. The standing stones. They had bypassed the final loop of the track and had come out right above the road. A wild, desperate hope surged through Ellie, a jolt of energy that propelled her the last few feet. They slid the last few yards on a wave of mud and gravel, landing in a heap on the narrow verge of the road itself. And there it was. Fifty yards away. Her Ford Focus, a solid, beautiful, miraculously real object, its familiar, unassuming shape the most beautiful thing Ellie had ever seen.\n\nBut their relief was instantly shattered. A figure detached itself from the shadow of the larger standing stone, stepping out onto the road to block their path to the car. It was Rik. He hadn't been fooled. He had taken the same shortcut, his knowledge of the mountain far superior to their desperate improvisation. He stood there, his chest heaving, his face a grim rictus of triumph in the gloom. He had them. They were cornered, with the empty road stretching into darkness on one side and the impassable mountain on the other. \"Nowhere left to run,\" he grunted, taking a slow, heavy step towards them. Ellie\u2019s mind raced, a final, frantic calculation. Her hand dove into her pocket, not for the phone, but for her car keys. \"Immy!\" she yelled, and threw the keys in a high arc towards her sister. For a fraction of a second, Rik's eyes followed the glint of metal, a fatal, instinctive flicker of distraction. It was the only opening she would get. Instead of running for the car, Ellie feinted right, then charged left, directly at him. It was a move of such suicidal, unexpected foolishness that it worked. He stumbled back, bracing for an impact that never came, as she veered at the last second and sprinted past him, down the road, away from the car.\n\nImogen, catching the keys with the same reflexive skill she usually reserved for a thrown gin and tonic, didn't hesitate. She bolted for the car, her fingers jamming the fob, searching for the unlock button. The car let out a loud, cheerful chirp and its lights flashed once, a beacon of glorious, mundane technology in the ancient darkness. Rik, realising he'd been tricked, let out a roar of fury and turned from Ellie to charge after Imogen. But he was too late. Imogen wrenched the driver's side door open and threw herself inside. The engine coughed, then roared to life with a sound more beautiful than any symphony. The headlights blazed on, catching Rik full in the face. He stopped, blinded, raising a hand to shield his eyes, a great beast caught in the glare. That was Ellie\u2019s moment. She changed direction, sprinting back towards the passenger side of the car, wrenching the door open and diving in headfirst just as Imogen stamped her foot on the accelerator. The tires screamed on the wet tarmac. For a heart-stopping second, Rik's furious, contorted face appeared at the passenger window, his fist raised to smash the glass. Then the car lurched forward, throwing him off balance. They were moving. They were free. In the rearview mirror, Ellie saw his figure shrink, a furious, impotent shape standing alone on the dark, rain-swept mountain road, growing smaller and smaller, until he was swallowed completely by the night."

The engine roared, a frantic, high-pitched whine that seemed to mirror the panic in Ellie\u2019s own chest. The world outside the windscreen was a liquid chaos of lashing rain and a darkness so total it felt like they were driving through the bottom of the ocean. Inside the car, the only sounds were the frantic, rhythmic slap of the windscreen wipers battling the deluge and their own ragged, desperate gasps for air. Ellie pressed her forehead against the cold glass of the passenger window, her body one great, trembling ache. The image of Rik\u2019s face at the window, contorted with a primal, murderous rage, was burned onto the back of her eyelids. They were moving, they were safe, but the terror was still inside the car with them, a third passenger buckled in by adrenaline and shock.\n\nThey drove in a profound, shell-shocked silence for what felt like an eternity, the narrow mountain road slowly descending and widening into a more civilised A-road. The signs for Aberglynn, the small town that now felt like a lifetime ago, appeared in the headlights. Imogen pulled the car over into a deserted, rain-swept lay-by, the engine ticking and groaning as she finally killed the ignition. The sudden silence was absolute, broken only by the drumming of the rain on the car roof. For a long moment, neither of them moved. They just sat, staring into the darkness, two survivors washed up on the shore of a nightmare. It was Imogen who broke first. A single, ragged sob escaped her, a sound wrenched from a place of deep, foundational shame. Then another, and another, until she was weeping without restraint, her shoulders shaking, her face buried in her hands.\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" she choked out between sobs, the words thick and almost incomprehensible. \"Oh god, El, I'm so, so sorry. I was so stupid. I believed him. I believed all of it.\" Ellie turned to her, the anger she had felt, the frustration, the hurt \u2013 it all just evaporated, leaving behind only a vast, hollowed-out ache of love and relief. She reached across the centre console, her hand finding her sister\u2019s shaking shoulder. \"It's okay,\" Ellie said, her own voice a raw, cracked whisper. \"Immy, it's okay. We're okay.\" \"No, it's not!\" Imogen wailed, lifting her head, her face a mess of tears and streaked mud in the dim glow of the dashboard lights. \"I gave him everything, El. The money from Mum. I just\u2026 handed it to him. He said it was an investment in the community, in my own soul. I was so lost, and he sounded so certain. And I accused you\u2026 I said your love was heavy.\" The memory of the words, spoken with such placid cruelty in the yurt, hung between them, more painful than any physical blow.\n\n\"We can talk about that later,\" Ellie said, her voice gentle but firm. \"Right now, we need to think.\" Her mind, slowly coming back online, began to triage the situation. They were out, but they were not safe. Her jacket felt heavy, and she remembered why. \"The phone,\" she said, her voice sharp with a new urgency. She fumbled with the zip of her inner pocket, her fingers clumsy and numb. She pulled the phone out. The screen was a spiderweb of fine cracks, and the case was slick with rainwater. Her heart sank. It was dead. Useless. \"No,\" she whispered, a fresh wave of despair washing over her. All of it\u2014the fire, the fight, the terrifying escape\u2014it had all been for nothing. \"Wait,\" Imogen said, wiping her eyes with the back of her muddy hand. She pointed to the dashboard. \"The charger.\" Ellie stared at the familiar USB port in the car, a piece of mundane technology she had never been more grateful to see. With trembling hands, she found the charging cable she always kept tangled in the glove compartment and plugged the phone in. For a terrible, breathless second, nothing happened. Then the screen flickered to life, displaying a low battery symbol. It was working.\n\nThe relief was so immense it felt like a physical blow. As the phone drank in the car's power, Ellie\u2019s mind turned to the next problem. \"He knows who I am, Immy. He has my name. He probably knows where I live. We can't go back to Wokingham.\" \"We go to the police,\" Imogen said immediately, her voice gaining a sliver of its old resolve. \"We show them the photo. We tell them everything.\" \"And say what?\" Ellie countered, the full absurdity of their situation crashing down on her. \"That we were held captive by a cult leader named Brother Sol, who we provoked into a fight, accidentally set his yurt on fire, and then fled down a mountain? Look at us. We look like criminals. He's probably already called them himself on his satellite phone, telling them two hysterical women from the city attacked him and committed arson.\" Her phone, now with a few percent of life, buzzed weakly. A notification from a news app lit up the cracked screen. *'Britain's Next Star' Finalist 'The Prof' Incommunicado Ahead of Grand Final*. The headline was a dispatch from a parallel universe, a grotesque, comical counterpoint to their grim reality. Ellie let out a short, hysterical laugh. \"And apparently, I'm a missing person in another, much more public, story.\" She showed the screen to Imogen, whose eyes widened in disbelief.\n\n\"Oh my god,\" Imogen whispered. \"The final. That's this week.\" The two worlds had finally collided with the force of a head-on crash. Dr. Vance, the fugitive academic, and The Prof, the nation\u2019s sweetheart, were the same person, and both of them were sitting in a beat-up Ford Focus in a rainy lay-by in the middle of Wales, covered in mud and fear. They needed help. Not from the police, not yet. They needed someone who could bridge those two worlds. Someone who knew about the chalk dust and the singing. Someone logical and steady, who would believe their insane story without question. There was only one person. \"Ben,\" Ellie said, the name a prayer. She swiped past the news alerts, her thumb finding his name in her contacts. She looked at Imogen, who just nodded, her eyes wide with trust. Ellie pressed the call button, listening to the electronic burr of the ringing tone, a lifeline cast out from the heart of the storm into the quiet, sane, book-lined world she had left behind. \"Please pick up, Ben,\" she whispered to the cracked screen. \"Please, just pick up.\""

Ellie\u2019s hope, a fragile, flickering candle, was beginning to gutter. Then, just as she was about to give up, the ringing stopped, replaced by a click and a voice, miraculously clear and utterly calm. \u201cVance? Do you have any idea what time it is?\u201d Ben\u2019s voice, blessedly familiar and tinged with its usual dry irritation, was the most beautiful sound she had ever heard. It was the voice of reason, of footnotes and library fines, of a world where the worst thing that could happen was a misplaced semi-colon. The relief was so profound it almost broke her.\n\n\u201cBen,\u201d she breathed, the name a prayer answered. The dam of her composure, which had held through fire and flight, finally cracked. The words came out in a torrent, a frantic, jumbled narrative of chaos. \u201cBen, we\u2019re in Wales. I found her. It\u2019s a cult. He has a ledger, I have a photo, he stole her money. There was a fire, he tried to take my phone, we ran, they chased us. We have the car. We can\u2019t go home. He knows where I live. We can\u2019t go to the police. Ben, I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d The story spilled out, a raw data stream of terror, defying all the syntactical and logical structures she held so dear. There was a long, profound silence on the other end of the line, a quiet so complete she thought he might have hung up. She could picture him, sitting in his armchair, a book lying open in his lap, processing the incoherent, hysterical report from the field.\n\nWhen he finally spoke, his voice was stripped of all academic languor. It was sharp, focused, and absolute. \u201cRight. Listen to me, Ellie. Where, precisely, are you?\u201d \u201cA lay-by. Just outside a town called Aberglynn,\u201d she said, her voice shaking. \u201cOkay. Your phone. What is its battery level?\u201d \u201cCharging. About six percent.\u201d \u201cGood. First, I want you to open your email. Attach the photograph from your camera roll. Send it to me. Send it to your university address. Send it to Imogen. Create a digital footprint. Now.\u201d The command was so clear, so authoritative, it cut through her panic like a scalpel. She did as she was told, her trembling fingers navigating the cracked screen. She found the photo \u2013 blurry, backlit by the torch, but the script, the name, the figure, all horrifyingly legible. She attached it to a new email, her thumb hovering over the send button.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s sent,\u201d she whispered. \u201cGood. Now, I want you to drive to me. Do not stop. Do not go to Wokingham. Come directly to my house. I\u2019m sending you my address now. It will take you about three hours. Can you do that?\u201d \u201cI\u2026 I think so,\u201d Ellie stammered. Imogen was staring at her, her tear-streaked face pale with dawning hope. \u201cYou can,\u201d Ben\u2019s voice was firm, a rock in the swirling sea of her fear. \u201cPut the phone down. Concentrate on the road. I will see you in three hours.\u201d The line went dead, leaving Ellie in the rain-lashed silence of the car, clutching the phone that now held a single, clear instruction. A destination. A safe harbour. She turned to Imogen, a flicker of her old, capable self returning. \u201cYou heard him. We have a plan.\u201d\n\nThe journey east was a surreal, silent pilgrimage. Imogen drove, her hands gripping the steering wheel with a white-knuckled intensity, her eyes fixed on the road ahead as if the tarmac itself was a tightrope over a chasm. The weeping had stopped, replaced by a brittle, focused silence. Ellie navigated, the soft, calm voice of the GPS on her phone a bizarrely normal narrator for their desperate flight. They didn\u2019t speak of what had happened. The trauma was too large, too raw, to be dissected in the fragile confines of the car. It sat between them, a great, wounded beast, and they were both afraid to touch it. Instead, they focused on the mundane. The turn-off for the M4. The low fuel light blinking on. The tense, heart-stopping moment they had to pull into a brightly lit, twenty-four-hour service station.\n\nThe service station was a portal to another universe. People were buying coffee, reading magazines, laughing. A television mounted in the corner of the shop was playing a rolling news broadcast, and Ellie\u2019s heart seized as a familiar photograph flashed onto the screen: one of the show\u2019s glossy publicity shots of her, smiling in a polka-dot tea dress. The chyron beneath read: *STAR FINALIST MISSING: Concerns Grow for \u2018The Prof\u2019*. A man in a high-vis jacket glanced from the screen to Ellie, who had pulled her muddy hood up to hide her face, and did a slight double-take. Ellie grabbed a handful of protein bars, paid in cash without making eye contact, and fled back to the car, her heart hammering. The two stories of her life were beginning to merge, and the result was going to be an explosion.\n\nBack on the motorway, cocooned in the anonymity of the moving traffic, Imogen finally spoke, her voice barely a whisper. \u201cThey\u2019ll think you\u2019ve been kidnapped. Or that you\u2019ve had a breakdown because of the pressure.\u201d She glanced at Ellie, her expression hollowed out with guilt. \u201cThis is all my fault. Your whole life, your career\u2026 I\u2019ve ruined it.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous,\u201d Ellie said, her tone sharper than she intended. \u201cYou didn\u2019t ruin anything. I walked up that mountain. I took the photo. I made a choice, Immy. Maybe for the first time in a long time, I actually made a real one.\u201d The words hung in the air, a startling, unvarnished truth. All her life, she had moved along a safe, predictable track, from degree to degree, from semester to semester. This mad, terrifying detour was the first truly unscheduled thing she had ever done. It was horrifying, and it was, in a strange, terrifying way, utterly her own.\n\nThree hours and a lifetime later, they turned onto Ben\u2019s street. It was a quiet, tree-lined road of dark brick Victorian terraces, the kind of street where the loudest noise was the rustle of turning pages. It was a world away from the howling emptiness of the mountain. A single light burned in the downstairs window of number twenty-seven, a beacon in the pre-dawn gloom. Imogen pulled the car to a halt and killed the engine. They were here. They were safe. The adrenaline that had sustained Ellie for the past twelve hours finally drained away, leaving behind a bone-deep exhaustion so profound she wasn't sure she could even open the car door. As if sensing their arrival, the front door of the house opened. Ben stood there, silhouetted in the warm light of the hallway. He was just as she had pictured him: wearing an old university sweatshirt and a pair of worn corduroys, a book still in one hand. He took one look at the mud-caked car, then at the two dishevelled, haunted figures who stumbled out of it. He did not rush forward. He did not exclaim. His face registered no shock, only a kind of grim, intellectual confirmation. The problem he had been analysing remotely for the past three hours had finally downloaded onto his doorstep. \"Right,\" he said, his voice quiet but carrying clearly in the still morning air. \"Get inside. Both of you. I'll put the kettle on.\""

                                        "text": "Stepping across the threshold of Ben\u2019s house was like entering a different dimension. The chaotic, elemental violence of the night was instantly banished, replaced by a profound and orderly quiet. The air smelled of old paper, floor polish, and the rich, malty aroma of brewing tea. Books were everywhere, not just in shelves that lined the hallway from floor to ceiling, but in neat, carefully curated stacks on side tables and mantelpieces. It was a fortress of logic and learning, a bastion against the madness of the world, and Ellie felt a wave of gratitude so intense it almost buckled her knees. Ben took their wet, muddy jackets without a word, his expression unreadable, and hung them carefully on a coat stand where they dripped onto a waiting newspaper, a small, controlled containment of the chaos they had brought with them.\n\nHe led them into his living room, a space that was a continuation of the library in the hall. Two worn leather armchairs faced a fireplace, and a thick Persian rug covered the floor. He motioned for them to sit, then disappeared into the kitchen, the clink of mugs and the click of the kettle providing a soundtrack of reassuring domesticity. Imogen curled into one of the chairs, pulling her knees up to her chest and wrapping her arms around them, making herself as small as possible. She stared into the empty fireplace, her body trembling with a fine, continuous tremor. Ellie sat opposite, her posture rigid, her hands clasped tightly in her lap to stop them from shaking. She felt scrubbed raw, every nerve exposed, every muscle a screaming knot of pain. The warmth of the room felt alien, a comfort she hadn\u2019t yet earned. Ben returned with three large mugs of steaming tea, placing one on a coaster beside each of them. He pulled up a hard-backed dining chair and sat opposite the two sisters, his gaze steady and patient. He waited, letting the warmth of the mugs and the quiet of the room do their work.\n\nFinally, after taking a long, scalding sip of tea, Ellie began to speak. The story, which had been a frantic, panicked jumble on the phone, now came out in a more linear, if no less horrifying, sequence. She spoke with the detached precision of a witness giving a statement, describing the serene welcome, the placid faces, the conversation with Brother Sol. Imogen flinched at his name, but remained silent, her gaze fixed on the floor. Ellie recounted the discovery in the yurt, the ledger, the satellite phone, the bundles of cash. She described the confrontation, the fire, and the desperate, terrifying flight down the mountain. She did not embellish or editorialize; she simply presented the facts, a litany of horrors delivered in a flat, exhausted monotone. Through it all, Ben listened without interruption, his steepled fingers resting against his lips, his eyes never leaving her face. He was not just hearing her story; he was analysing it, cataloguing it, searching for the patterns and the weaknesses.\n\nWhen she finished, the silence in the room was thick with the weight of her narrative. \u201cThe phone,\u201d Ben said, his voice quiet. Ellie produced it, the screen a fractured mosaic, and handed it to him. He examined it for a moment, then took it to a charging port by his desk. While it powered up, he walked to a bureau and returned with a bottle of single malt whisky and three small glasses. He poured a generous measure into each without asking. \u201cMedicinal,\u201d he stated, handing one to each of them. Ellie took a sip, and the fiery liquid burned a welcome, steadying path down her throat. Imogen took the glass, but just held it, staring into its amber depths. A few minutes later, Ben retrieved the phone. He navigated to the photo gallery, his expression grim. He stared at the blurry image of the ledger, his analytical mind processing the raw data of the crime. \u201cHe\u2019s not even trying to hide it,\u201d he murmured, more to himself than to them. \u201cThe arrogance of it.\u201d He looked up at Ellie, his eyes hard with a cold, intellectual anger. \u201cThis isn\u2019t just about your sister\u2019s money, Ellie. This is a pattern. There are two dozen names in this book. This man is a predator who has been operating for years, completely under the radar.\u201d\n\nHe set the phone down on the coffee table between them, the cracked screen displaying its damning evidence. \u201cAnd now,\u201d he said, turning to his laptop which sat open on his desk, \u201cwe have the other complication.\u201d He tapped a key, and the screen came to life, showing a major news website. The lead story was a picture of her, smiling benevolently on the set of the show, under the headline: *\u2018The Prof\u2019 Vanishes: Mystery and Concern Surround Finalist\u2019s Disappearance*. There were quotes from a frantic Tamsin, worried comments from the judges, and wild speculation from the public in the comments section. They were theorising everything from a last-minute crisis of confidence to a secret, elaborate publicity stunt. Ben scrolled down to another article, this one from a tabloid, its headline more lurid: *STAR\u2019S STRESS MELTDOWN? Singer Professor Goes AWOL Before Live Final*. Ellie stared at the screen, at the smiling, confident stranger who was supposed to be her. It was like looking at her own obituary. The person in those photos, the quirky, heart-warming story the nation had bought into, was a fiction. The reality was the mud-streaked, terrified woman sitting in this room.\n\nImogen finally spoke, her voice a croak. \u201cSo we\u2019re trapped. We can\u2019t go to the police because he\u2019ll paint us as arsonists. And you can\u2019t show your face because the whole country is looking for you. He\u2019s won. He\u2019s just going to get away with it.\u201d A fresh wave of despair washed over her, and she buried her face in her hands again. \u201cNo,\u201d Ben said, his voice cutting through her hopelessness. He stood up and began to pace in front of the fireplace, his mind visibly at work, connecting the disparate, impossible threads of their situation. \u201cNo, he hasn\u2019t won. He\u2019s made a critical mistake. He\u2019s underestimated you. He thinks your public profile is a vulnerability, a source of pressure that will make you crack. He sees you as a media confection. He\u2019s wrong.\u201d Ben stopped pacing and turned to face Ellie, his eyes alight with a sudden, brilliant, and utterly terrifying idea. \u201cHe is hiding in the shadows, counting on silence and obscurity to protect him. His greatest fear is the light. And you, Ellie, are about to step onto the most brightly lit stage in the entire country.\u201d He paused, letting the weight of his words sink in. \u201cThe final is in two days. You\u2019re not going to hide. You\u2019re going to go back. You\u2019re going to get ready. And for your Winner\u2019s Anthem, you\u2019re not just going to sing a song. You\u2019re going to tell a story.\u201d"

It was a vacuum, sucking the very air from the room. Imogen was the first to find her voice, and it was a choked, horrified whisper. \u201cNo. Absolutely not. You can\u2019t. It\u2019s insane.\u201d She scrambled out of her chair and stood between Ellie and Ben, a makeshift, trembling bodyguard. \u201cDid you not hear what she just said? They chased us. That man, Rik, he would have killed us. You want to send her back into the spotlight where they can see her? Where they can find her? No.\u201d Her fierce protectiveness was a startling, beautiful thing, a mirror image of all the times Ellie had stood between her and a bad decision.\n\nEllie, however, did not move. She stared at Ben, not at the terrifying scale of his idea, but at the cold, impeccable logic that underpinned it. Hide, and they would be hunted forever, their lives shrinking to the size of their fear. Go to the police, and their story would be a confusing, improbable mess against the word of a charismatic, plausible man. But the show\u2026 the show was a nuclear option. It was a stage watched by millions. It was a platform of such blinding light that the shadows Brother Sol lived in could not survive its glare. The thought was so audacious, so terrifying, it was almost sublime. \u201cHe\u2019s right, Immy,\u201d Ellie said, her voice quiet but steady. The exhaustion was still there, a deep, resonant ache, but beneath it, something else was hardening into existence: purpose. \u201cHe thinks I\u2019m a joke. A TV novelty. He thinks I\u2019ll run and hide. He will never, in a million years, expect me to walk back onto that stage.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t one of your books, Ben!\u201d Imogen rounded on him, her voice rising with frantic energy. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a clever plot twist! This is my sister\u2019s life!\u201d \u201cI am acutely aware of that,\u201d Ben replied, his voice calm and even, a steadying counterpoint to her panic. \u201cAnd right now, her life as she knows it is over. His power is in his anonymity, his ability to operate in the dark. Ellie\u2019s power, the one thing she has that he can never touch, is her voice. And a platform to use it. This isn\u2019t about revenge, Imogen. It\u2019s about creating a situation so public, so undeniable, that he has nowhere left to run.\u201d He turned his gaze back to Ellie. \u201cBut it only works if you can do it. Can you lie to them all for two days? Can you stand on that stage and perform, knowing what\u2019s at stake?\u201d\n\nEllie thought of the names in the ledger. She thought of the vacant eyes of the woman who had served her the drugged-tasting tea. She thought of Imogen\u2019s inheritance, turned into bundles of cash in a wooden chest. This was no longer just about her sister. It was about all of them. \u201cYes,\u201d she said. The single word was a vow.\n\nThe next hour was a council of war held in the pre-dawn gloom of Ben\u2019s living room. They drank more tea and meticulously constructed the cover story. It had to be plausible, emotional, and, crucially, private. \u201cA family crisis,\u201d Ben stated. \u201cIt\u2019s the perfect explanation. It\u2019s unimpeachable. No one has the right to question the details.\u201d \u201cMy fault,\u201d Imogen murmured. \u201cIt can be my fault. A breakdown. An episode. It\u2019s believable.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d Ellie said firmly, looking her sister in the eye. \u201cNo more blame. It was a crisis, and I had to go to you. That\u2019s all they need to know. The rest is private.\u201d\n\nWith the story set, the first performance had to begin. Ellie took a deep, shuddering breath and found Tamsin\u2019s number. She walked into the hallway for a sliver of privacy, her heart hammering a frantic rhythm against her ribs. When the production assistant answered, her voice was a squeak of relief and exhaustion. \u201cEllie! Oh my God, Ellie, where are you? Are you okay? We\u2019ve been going out of our minds!\u201d Ellie leaned her forehead against the cool, book-lined wall and began to act. She let her voice crack. She infused it with the genuine exhaustion and trauma she was feeling, but channelled it into the fictional narrative. \u201cTamsin, I\u2019m so, so sorry,\u201d she began, her voice a reedy whisper. \u201cI had a\u2026 a severe family emergency. With my sister. I had to go. I couldn\u2019t call, there was no signal. It\u2019s been\u2026 awful. I\u2019ve only just managed to sort things out. I\u2019m so sorry to have let everyone down.\u201d\n\nThe performance was flawless. Tamsin\u2019s frantic professionalism immediately softened into gushing, maternal sympathy. \u201cOh, you poor, poor thing! Don\u2019t you apologise for a second! Family comes first, always! Is your sister okay? Is there anything we can do?\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s\u2026 she\u2019s going to be okay,\u201d Ellie said, the lie tasting like ash. \u201cBut Tamsin\u2026 the final. I still want to do it. I need to do it. Can I\u2026 can I still come back?\u201d The effect was instantaneous. The relief in Tamsin\u2019s voice was palpable. The show was saved. Her star was back. \u201cOf course you can! We\u2019ll hold the car! Just get yourself to Paddington Station, we\u2019ll have someone meet you right at the ticket barrier. Oh, Ellie, we\u2019re all so relieved! You\u2019re so brave!\u201d\n\nAfter she hung up, Ellie leaned against the wall, drained. The first lie had been told. The clock was now ticking. Ben drove her to the station through the quiet, grey streets of the awakening city. Imogen sat in the back, a silent, watchful presence. At the drop-off point, Imogen hugged her, a fierce, desperate embrace. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to do this, El,\u201d she whispered into her sister\u2019s hair. \u201cWe can just disappear. Go to Ireland. I\u2019ll change my name.\u201d \u201cAnd let him win?\u201d Ellie whispered back, pulling away to look her in the eye. \u201cNo. I\u2019m tired of running.\u201d She gave Imogen\u2019s hand one last squeeze, then turned and walked into the station without looking back, the automatic doors sliding shut behind her, sealing her off from her old life.\n\nThe return to the machine was a dizzying, disorienting whirlwind. A production assistant met her at the station, shielding her from the curious glances of the public and bundling her into a black car. At the production office, she was met with a flurry of hugs, sympathetic looks, and murmurs of \u201cYou\u2019re so brave.\u201d She repeated her story, the vague, sad tale of a family crisis, until the words felt worn and smooth, a mantra of deception. Then came the meeting about the song. She was ushered into a glass-walled office with Tamsin and the show\u2019s formidable executive producer, a man named Marcus who had the predatory stillness of a patient shark. \u201cEllie, welcome back,\u201d he said, his smile not quite reaching his eyes. \u201cWe\u2019re all delighted you\u2019re safe and ready to perform. Now, the Winner\u2019s Anthem. We\u2019re thinking something triumphant. \u2018The Show Must Go On\u2019. \u2018I\u2019m Still Standing\u2019. Something to celebrate your journey, your resilience.\u201d\n\nThis was it. The critical juncture. Ellie took a breath. \u201cNo,\u201d she said, her voice quiet but firm. The two producers looked at her, surprised. \u201cI appreciate that, Marcus, but after the week I\u2019ve had\u2026 those songs don\u2019t feel true. They feel\u2026 hollow.\u201d \u201cWhat do you have in mind?\u201d Marcus asked, a hint of impatience in his tone. \u201cI want to sing \u2018Sinnerman\u2019,\u201d Ellie said. \u201cThe Nina Simone version.\u201d Tamsin\u2019s face fell. \u201cOh, Ellie, but that\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s so dark. And it\u2019s ten minutes long! We can\u2019t possibly fit that into the live show.\u201d \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be ten minutes,\u201d Ellie countered, her mind racing, feeding off the energy of her own desperate improvisation. \u201cBut it\u2019s about running. It\u2019s about having nowhere left to hide. It\u2019s the story of the last few days of my life. It\u2019s the only honest song I can sing right now.\u201d Marcus steepled his fingers, his shark-like eyes assessing her. He was weighing the commercial risk against the potential for a legendary television \u2018moment\u2019. \u201cIt\u2019s a funeral dirge, not a winner\u2019s anthem,\u201d he said flatly.\n\n\u201cLet me show you,\u201d Ellie said, a reckless impulse taking over. She stood up, and in the sterile, air-conditioned silence of the office, she sang. She didn\u2019t sing the whole song, just the frantic, desperate plea from the heart of it, her voice, raw and ragged with exhaustion and genuine fear, filling the small room. *\u201cSo I ran to the river, it was bleedin\u2019 / I ran to the sea, it was bleedin\u2019 / I ran to the Lord, \u2018Please hide me, Lord\u2019 / Don\u2019t you see me prayin\u2019?\u201d* The sound was not pretty. It was visceral, harrowing, and utterly, undeniably real. When she finished, the silence was absolute. Tamsin had tears in her eyes. Marcus just stared at her, his predatory stillness replaced by a look of profound, calculating awe. He saw the story. He saw the headlines. He saw the awards. \u201cGet her a vocal coach,\u201d he said, a slow, wolfish grin spreading across his face. \u201cAnd get me a new arrangement. I want every single second of that on my show.\u201d\n\nLater that night, alone in the sterile luxury of her hotel room, the full weight of her decision crashed down on her. The city hummed and glittered outside her window, a world away from the silent, menacing darkness of the mountain. She had done it. She had set the wheels in motion. In two days, she would stand on a stage in front of twenty million people and sing a song that was a confession, an accusation, and a declaration of war. She pulled out her phone, the cracked screen glowing in the dark. She opened the photo, the blurry image of the ledger. She looked at her own sister\u2019s name, at the stolen sum beside it. This was not a song choice anymore. It was a promise. It was her verdict. And she was going to deliver it to the world."

                                        "text": "The two days leading up to the Grand Final were the strangest, most gruelling performance of Ellie\u2019s life, and they took place far from any stage. She was an actress in a one-woman show, playing the role of the \u2018Brave Finalist\u2019 returning from a private tragedy. The hotel, the rehearsal studios, the chauffeured cars\u2014it all formed a gilded cage, a bubble of manufactured reality that was, in its own way, as insidiously false as the community at Gwawr Newydd. Everyone she met, from sound technicians to the other finalists, treated her with a delicate, sympathetic reverence. They offered her sad, knowing smiles and cups of herbal tea, never pressing for details about the \u201cfamily crisis,\u201d but allowing a compassionate silence to hang in the air, a silence which Ellie was expected to fill with grateful, watery-eyed nods. Each act of kindness felt like a betrayal, each sympathetic murmur a fresh layer of deceit. She was a ghost haunting her own public narrative, her mind a split screen: on one side, the smiling, brave face of \u2018The Prof\u2019; on the other, the stark, looping memory of a burning yurt and a face contorted with rage.\n\nThe first battle was fought in the music rehearsal room with the show\u2019s musical director, a wiry, cynical veteran named Milo who had arranged pop songs for three decades and believed he had seen every possible gimmick. He had a three-minute, radio-friendly version of \u201cSinnerman\u201d mapped out, complete with a soaring key change and a potential for backing dancers. Ellie, running on three hours of sleep and a core of pure, unadulterated fury, refused. She didn\u2019t raise her voice. She simply took him through the song, not as a piece of music, but as a text to be deconstructed. \u201cThe song has a clear tripartite structure, Milo,\u201d she began, her voice the calm, authoritative tone of a seminar leader. \u201cIt begins with the protagonist\u2019s realisation of sin, the dawning horror. It needs to start quietly, almost acapella, to establish the isolation. The second act is the frantic, percussive chase\u2014the running to the river, the sea, the rock. That\u2019s where your arrangement is perfect. But the third act, the confrontation with the Devil, the final judgement\u2026 that cannot be triumphant. It has to be an indictment. It has to be cold and damning.\u201d Milo stared at her, his pen hovering over his sheet music, the cynical smirk slowly fading from his face. He had been prepared for a novelty act. He was not prepared for a formal exegesis. \u201cOkay, Professor,\u201d he said slowly, a new, grudging respect in his eyes. \u201cLet\u2019s try it your way.\u201d\n\nHer second battle was with the wardrobe department. They brought her racks of glittering, sequined gowns in gold and silver, fabrics designed to catch the light and scream \u2018Winner\u2019. \u201cWe want you to look like a star, Ellie! A beacon of hope!\u201d the head stylist chirped. Ellie gently pushed the glittering garments aside. \u201cI need something simple,\u201d she said. \u201cDark. Navy blue, or black. Long sleeves. Nothing that distracts from the words.\u201d The stylist\u2019s face fell, her vision of a triumphant Cinderella crushed. \u201cBut\u2026 it\u2019s a final! It\u2019s a celebration!\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a story,\u201d Ellie corrected her gently. \u201cAnd this story doesn\u2019t have a happy ending.\u201d The request was so unusual it had to be kicked upstairs to Marcus, who, to everyone\u2019s surprise, approved it instantly. \u201cGive her whatever she wants,\u201d he\u2019d decreed. \u201cThe woman is a storyteller. Let her tell it.\u201d She was no longer just a contestant; she was a concept, and the machine was recalibrating itself to sell her new, darker brand of authenticity. She was being given the rope, and she prayed it was long enough to hang a con man, and not just herself.\n\nContact with the outside world was sparse and dangerous. Ben\u2019s house had become their mission control. She would find an empty corridor or a deserted fire escape and call, her voice a low murmur. Imogen, sounding stronger and clearer with each call, would answer, her updates a mixture of the mundane and the terrifying. \u201cI\u2019ve eaten a whole pizza, El. And Ben made me alphabetise his collection of eighteenth-century periodicals. I think it\u2019s his version of therapy.\u201d But beneath the forced normality, fear was a constant hum. \u201cHave you seen them? Have they tried to contact you?\u201d Ellie would ask. \u201cNo,\u201d Ben\u2019s voice would cut in, taking over the phone. \u201cNothing. Which is exactly what worries me. I\u2019ve cross-referenced the names in the ledger with public records. A significant number of them are listed as beneficiaries of recent, substantial inheritances. Your sister fits the profile perfectly. He\u2019s not just a charlatan, Ellie, he\u2019s a financial predator with a system. He\u2019ll be lying low, confident that you\u2019re too scared and discredited to be a threat.\u201d His words were a cold comfort, reinforcing the necessity of her insane plan. He was counting on her fear. It was the only variable in his equation that he couldn't control, and she was about to prove his calculations catastrophically wrong.\n\nThe day of the Grand Final dawned grey and oppressive. The air in the studio complex was thick with the electric hum of anticipation. Hairspray, nervous sweat, and the smell of hot television lights created a heady, claustrophobic perfume. Ellie moved through the final hours in a state of hyper-aware detachment. She sat in the makeup chair, a serene smile fixed on her face, as a makeup artist carefully concealed the dark circles under her eyes and spoke in hushed, sympathetic tones about the importance of self-care. She endured a final, brief press call where she spoke vaguely of \u201cdrawing strength from adversity\u201d and the \u201chealing power of music,\u201d the platitudes feeling like stones in her mouth. She saw the other two finalists, a fresh-faced boyband and a powerhouse female vocalist, whispering in a corner, occasionally glancing at her with a mixture of pity and professional curiosity. She was the wild card, the human-interest story, the one whose narrative had eclipsed her talent. They had no idea just how wild the card was that she was about to play.\n\nAn hour before the show went live, Tamsin found her in her dressing room, a small, windowless box filled with flowers from the production company and good-luck cards from strangers. Tamsin was holding a tablet, her face pale. \u201cEllie\u2026 I think you need to see this.\u201d She showed Ellie the screen. It was a news alert from a local Welsh media outlet. *Police Investigating Brecon Beacons Fire Conclude \u2018No Suspicious Circumstances\u2019*. The article quoted an unnamed police source stating the fire at the \u201cisolated off-grid community\u201d was likely caused by a faulty flue on a wood-burning stove. The community\u2019s leader, who was not named, was reportedly \u201cdevastated\u201d by the loss but grateful that no one was harmed. The final sentence was a chilling masterstroke of public relations: *\u201cThe community, which values its privacy, has asked to be left alone to rebuild and heal in peace.\u201d*\n\nHe had done it. With a few phone calls, Brother Sol had cauterized the wound. He had taken control of the narrative, painting himself as the victim and sealing his sanctuary off from any further official scrutiny. A cold, terrifying calm descended over Ellie. The police wouldn't be coming. The law, in its slow, methodical way, had been outmanoeuvred. There was no one left to tell the story but her. She handed the tablet back to Tamsin. \u201cThank you for showing me,\u201d she said, her voice unnervingly steady. Tamsin looked at her, concerned. \u201cAre you alright, Ellie? You\u2019ve gone completely white.\u201d Ellie looked at her reflection in the mirror. The woman looking back was a stranger, her face a pale mask, her eyes burning with a light that looked nothing like stage fright. \u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she said. \u201cActually, I\u2019ve never been more ready.\u201d A knock on the door, and a stage manager\u2019s voice, muffled and distant. \u201cFive minutes to air, Ellie. Five minutes.\u201d The countdown had begun."

                                        "text": "### Chapter 10\n\nThe five minutes evaporated in a heartbeat. They were a strange, compressed eternity where the world outside her dressing room door ceased to exist. Ellie sat in the artificial silence, the distant, muffled thunder of the live audience a constant, low vibration she could feel in her bones. She was not afraid. The fear had been burned out of her on the mountain, leaving behind a cold, clear certainty. This was not stage fright. This was the chilling focus of a sniper, the calm of a bomb disposal expert. She had one shot, one chance to cut the right wire, and the margin for error was zero. She smoothed the dark fabric of her simple, long-sleeved dress, a stark statement of intent amidst the glitter and bombast of the night. It was a mourning dress. It was combat fatigues. It was the plain, severe robe of a hanging judge.\n\nThe stage manager\u2019s final knock came, and she rose. The walk from the dressing room to the wings was a journey through the grimy, functional guts of the television machine. She moved through a labyrinth of black-painted corridors and thick snaking cables, past crew members with headsets who averted their eyes as if she were a mourner on the way to a funeral. They had all heard the story of the \u2018brave finalist,\u2019 and her somber-clad figure, her face a pale, determined mask, seemed to confirm their narrative. She was a ghost at her own coronation. As she drew closer to the stage, the muffled thunder of the crowd grew into a deafening, physical roar. She could feel the bass of the boyband\u2019s triumphant pop anthem vibrating through the floor, a sound of such synthetic, uncomplicated joy it felt like a message from another planet.\n\nShe reached the wings, a place of organised chaos just beyond the curtain of light. The boyband, five beaming, perfectly coiffed young men, were taking their final bow to a screaming sea of fans. As they ran offstage, flushed with victory and adrenaline, one of them gave her a quick, sympathetic thumbs-up. \u201cBreak a leg, Prof! You got this!\u201d he whispered, before being swept away by a gaggle of producers. Ellie just nodded, her eyes fixed on the stage. She could see the host, a man whose teeth seemed to generate their own light, waiting in the centre. She could see the judges at their long, glowing desk: Chastity Diamond, looking impossibly glamorous and concerned; Julian, the Cowell-wannabe, his arms crossed in a pose of feigned severity; and the third judge, a kindly older musician who would probably weep. They were all pieces on a board, their reactions a predictable part of the machine.\n\n\u201cAnd now,\u201d the host\u2019s voice boomed, amplified to the heavens, \u201ca performer whose journey this season has touched the heart of the nation. She\u2019s faced down adversity with a courage that has inspired us all. After a difficult week, she\u2019s back where she belongs, to sing one final, incredible song. Ladies and gentlemen, give all the love you have to\u2026 The Prof!\u201d The roar of the crowd was a physical blow, a wall of sound and expectation. Ellie took a single, steadying breath and walked from the shadows into the blinding, surgical light. The heat was instantaneous and intense. She felt the gaze of thousands of strangers in the arena, and the silent, unblinking stare of the millions more watching through the lens of a camera that was now gliding towards her. She walked to the centre of the vast, circular stage, a lone, dark figure in a galaxy of swirling lights and manufactured starlight. The host gave her hand a practiced, reassuring squeeze. \u201cWe\u2019re all so glad you\u2019re here, Ellie,\u201d he murmured, just for her and the twenty million people listening. \u201cWhatever happens, you\u2019re already a winner.\u201d She gave him a small, brittle smile and turned to face the microphone.\n\nThe piano began, a single, mournful chord played into a vast, expectant silence. It was not the intro Milo had written. It was the intro she had demanded: stark, isolated, funereal. The lights dimmed, leaving her in a single, tight, white spotlight. The arena, moments before a roaring beast, fell utterly silent. This was not what they were expecting. This was not a celebration. Ellie closed her eyes for a fraction of a second, not to summon courage, but to bring a single image into sharp focus: the ledger, and the list of names. Then she opened them, looked directly into the dark lens of the main camera, and she began to sing. Her voice, alone and unadorned, cut through the silence, not with power, but with a chilling, conversational clarity. *\u201cOh Sinnerman, where you gonna run to? Sinnerman, where you gonna run to? Sinnerman, where you gonna run to? All on that day.\u201d*\n\nIt was not a question. It was a pronouncement. She saw, on the monitors at the side of the stage, the feed cut to the judges\u2019 faces. Confusion was dawning on them. This was not the song of a brave victim. This was the song of a prosecutor. The percussive beat kicked in, a frantic, hunted heartbeat, and Ellie\u2019s body came alive. She was not just singing the words; she was reliving them. When she sang of running to the river, she saw the dark, churning mud of the mountain track. When she sang of the rock crying out \u201cI can\u2019t hide you,\u201d she saw the blank, unwelcoming faces in the Aberglynn pub. Her performance was a frenzy of contained terror, her hands clenched, her body tight with the memory of flight. The camera operators, sensing a seismic shift in the emotional landscape of the show, abandoned their pre-planned swoops and locked their cameras on her face, capturing the raw, unscripted truth of her performance.\n\nThen came the final verse, the confrontation. The frantic beat dropped away, leaving only the cold, tolling piano chords. The lights tightened even further, casting the rest of the stage into shadow. Her voice dropped, losing its frantic edge and taking on a cold, damning weight. *\u201cSo I ran to the Devil, he was waitin\u2019.\u201d* She delivered the line not to the audience, but to the camera, to the man she knew would be watching, drawn by his own arrogance to witness her public humiliation. She could see him, in his new bolthole, his followers gathered around him, his face twisting from smug satisfaction to dawning, horrified realisation. This was not her breakdown. This was his. *\u201cSo I said \u2018Power\u2026 give me Power!\u2019\u201d* Her voice rose, not in a plea, but in a furious, mocking imitation of his greed. Then it dropped again, to a final, deadly whisper, each word a perfectly enunciated bullet. *\u201cAnd the Devil, he\u2019s a-waitin\u2019. And the Devil, he\u2019s a-waitin\u2019. All\u2026 on\u2026 that\u2026 day.\u201d*\n\nThe final piano chord hung in the air, a dissonant, unresolved question. And then, silence. An absolute, unbroken silence that stretched for one second, then two, then five. The arena was a cathedral of stunned stillness. The twenty million people at home leaned closer to their television screens. The applause did not come. The spectacle of television had been shattered, and in its place was a raw, uncomfortable, and terrifying piece of truth. Ellie stood, unmoving, in her single shaft of light, her chest heaving, her eyes still locked on the camera lens. She had thrown her grenade. And now, in the ringing silence, she waited for the world to explode."

                                        "text": "The first sound to break the spell was a choked, audible gasp, caught on a live microphone. It was Chastity Diamond. The camera, still locked on Ellie, caught the movement at the judges\u2019 desk in the background. Chastity had her hands over her mouth, her perfectly constructed mask of glamour shattered, revealing a woman looking at a terrible, real-world car crash. Julian, the cynic, was leaning forward, his elbows on the desk, his jaw slack. He wasn\u2019t looking at a contestant anymore; he was looking at a phenomenon, a broadcast event so far off the script that it was terrifying and magnificent. The kindly third judge was openly weeping, her face buried in her hands. In the vast, dark auditorium, a few tentative, confused claps started, then sputtered and died, as if the audience collectively understood that applause was the wrong response. It was not a performance to be judged; it was a testimony that had to be witnessed.\n\nThe show\u2019s host, a man programmed for seamless transitions and boundless enthusiasm, was visibly malfunctioning. He took a half-step towards Ellie, his mouth opening and closing silently for a moment before he found his voice. It was strained, a pale imitation of his usual booming confidence. \u201cEllie,\u201d he began, his eyes darting frantically towards the autocue, which was, of course, blank. The producers in his earpiece were likely screaming, a torrent of contradictory commands. \u201cThat was\u2026 that was the most powerful\u2026 the most emotional performance we have ever seen on this stage.\u201d He was trying to wrestle the moment back into the safe, familiar language of television, to frame her raw cry of pain as a ratings-grabbing piece of emotional theatre. \u201cCan you\u2026 can you tell us what that song means to you?\u201d\n\nThis was her moment. Her one, final opening before they cut to a commercial break and buried her story forever. She turned her head slowly, pulling her gaze from the camera lens and fixing it on the host. His reassuring smile was frozen on his face, a rictus of pure panic. She gave him a small, sad shake of her head. \u201cThat song wasn\u2019t for you,\u201d she said, her voice quiet but carrying with absolute authority through the microphone, silencing the few murmurs that had started in the crowd. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t for the judges. It wasn\u2019t for a record contract.\u201d She took a breath, and then she delivered the payload. \u201cThat song was for a man who calls himself Brother Sol. It was for his victims, the people whose lives he has destroyed at a place called Gwawr Newydd, in the Brecon Beacons. People like my sister, Imogen Vance.\u201d\n\nShe said the names clearly, deliberately, turning them from a private horror into a public record. The host\u2019s face went completely white. He was no longer trying to smile. In the production gallery, chaos would have erupted. In Ben\u2019s living room, he would be leaning forward, his work just beginning. In a hidden bolthole somewhere, a predator was hearing his name spoken to the nation. Ellie knew she had only seconds left. She raised her voice, letting the cool, authoritative tone of the lecturer, the expert, take over. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a story. It\u2019s a crime. And there is evidence.\u201d She looked back down the barrel of the camera, speaking now not just to the man in hiding, but to every journalist, every police officer, every person watching. \u201cMy colleague, Dr. Ben Carter, has just created a website. FindMySister.co.uk. On it, you will find a photograph of a ledger. A list of names. The proof of the theft. Please. Find it. Share it. Help them.\u201d\n\nIt was done. She had turned a talent show into a press conference, a grand final into a call to arms. The host, finally receiving a clear, frantic command in his ear, blurted out, \u201cWe\u2026 we have to go to a break!\u201d But it was too late. The sound from the audience was no longer silence or confusion. It was a roar of shock, of outrage, of a thousand people talking at once. It was the sound of the real world crashing through the fourth wall. On the monitors, Ellie saw the feed cut abruptly to a pre-recorded car advertisement, a jarring, nonsensical transition from stark reality to glossy commerce. But on the stage, the chaos was real. Two large men in black suits, the show\u2019s security, were walking briskly towards her from the wings. Tamsin was behind them, her face a mask of utter, uncomprehending shock. The machine was moving to contain her, to remove the source of the malfunction.\n\nAs the security guards reached her, each taking one of her arms in a firm but not unkindly grip, she did not resist. She felt strangely light, hollowed out. She had carried this terrible weight up a mountain and onto a stage, and now she had finally set it down. She risked one last glance at the judges\u2019 desk. Julian was already on his phone. Chastity was being comforted by the third judge. They were no longer part of her story. As she was escorted off the stage, past the stunned crew and the flapping curtains, she heard the first ripples of her actions echoing back from the world. A stagehand, staring at his phone, his eyes wide, looked up at her as she passed. \u201cIt\u2019s true,\u201d he whispered, to no one in particular. \u201cIt\u2019s all over Twitter. The website\u2019s already crashed.\u201d She was led down the dark corridor, a prisoner of the very show she had just detonated. The door to her dressing room was opened, and she was guided inside. The door closed, and she heard the distinct, heavy click of a lock turning. She was alone. In the silence, a single, wild thought broke through. She was in the final of Britain\u2019s Next Star. She wondered if she had won."
