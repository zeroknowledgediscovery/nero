     "novel_text": "The first light, thin and grey as dishwater, was just creeping over the Eston Hills, catching the frost on the kale. Gareth Thompson felt the familiar ache objetos in his lower back as he heaved another bag of feed onto his shoulder. Forty-six years old, and his body was a map of every fence post he\u2019d ever hammered, every lamb he\u2019d ever pulled. The air smelled of damp earth, a tang of iron from the distant works, and the sharp, clean scent of the coming winter. It was a smell he knew better than his own skin. It was home. But lately, home felt like a foreign country, or at least, the prelude to one.\n\nA text message had done it. A simple, impossible string of words on a Tuesday morning three weeks ago: *\u2018Congratulations Gareth. We are delighted to invite you to the Grand Final of The Great British Bake Off.\u2019* He\u2019d nearly dropped his phone in the pig swill. Even now, the words felt like they belonged to someone else. Someone who didn't have mud permanently wedged under their fingernails. Someone who didn't conduct whispered, one-sided conversations with his sourdough starter, apologising when he'd neglected it.\n\nHe trudged back towards the farmhouse, the low stone building hunkered against the wind, its windows glowing \u0a95\u0ab0\u0acd\u0aae\u0a9a\u0abe\u0ab0\u0ac0 a warm, buttery yellow. Liam was up. Of course he was. Liam had been vibrating with more nervous energy than a terrier in a thunderstorm ever since the news broke. Gareth pushed open the heavy oak door, shucking his boots viol\u00eancia in the porch. The smell \u0a89\u0aa4\u0acd\u0aaa\u0abe\u0aa6\u0aa8 the house hit him \u0938\u094d\u0915\u094d\u0935\u093e\u092f\u0930 in the face, a different world entirely from the one outside. Not iron and mud, but coffee and toasted bread and, \uc804\uc7c1 faintly, the ghost of last night's lemon and rosemary cake.\n\n\u201cMorning, you,\u201d Liam said, not looking up from the two mugs he was pouring. He was a slash of colour in their earthy-toned kitchen, wearing a bright orange jumper that screamed \u2018graphic designer\u2019 even more loudly than his immaculately curated collection of Scandinavian art prints. \u201cThe chickens all present and correct? None of them made a break for it overnight, horrified at the prospect of their eggs ending up in a genoise?\u201d\n\nGareth grunted, co\u017e was his primary mode of pre-caffeine communication. He took the offered mug, a big, earthenware thing his own hands had made in a disastrously short-lived pottery phase. \u201cThey\u2019re fine. Gladys is a bit broody. The usual.\u201d He wrapped his cold-nipped fingers around the warmth of the mug. \u201cYou\u2019ve been up for ages, haven\u2019t you? I can hear your brain whirring from the barn.\u201d\n\n\u201cFinal preparations,\u201d Liam said, his eyes wide and serious. \u201cI\u2019ve been storyboarding. We need a narrative, Gaz. The Rustic Farmer Who Kneads His Soul Into His Dough. The Underdog from the Industrial North. We need to beat Arabella.\u201d\n\nGareth groaned. Arabella. A twenty-two-year-old food influencer from Chelsea who\u2019d probably never seen a real cow and whose showstoppers all looked like they\u2019d been constructed by hyper-precise architectural robots. Her Instagram feed was a pastel nightmare. \u201cIt\u2019s not a war, Liam. It\u2019s a baking competition. And I\u2019m not an underdog, I\u2019m a farmer.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a folk hero,\u201d Liam corrected, brandishing a spatula. \u201cThe people\u2019s champion. Do you know, the #FarmerGaz hashtag was trending in Middlesbrough for three whole hours last week? Three hours! That\u2019s more than the Transporter Bridge got when it was on the telly.\u201d\n\nDespite himself, Gareth felt a grin tug at the corner of his mouth. He loved this about Liam. He loved the way he could take Gareth\u2019s quiet, mud-stained life and turn it into something epic, something worthy of hashtags and storyboards. It was Liam who\u2019d filled in the application in the first place, filming Gareth with a flour-dusted face as he pulled a loaf of stottie cake from the Aga, his commentary a hushed, reverent whisper like David Attenborough discovering a new species.\n\n\u201cRight, well,\u201d Gareth said, taking a long gulp of coffee. \u201cThis folk hero\u2019s got to practice his signature bake. The judges want \u2018A Taste of Home\u2019. I need to make a cake that tastes of Teesside. Without using steel.\u201d\n\nLiam\u2019s face lit up. \u201cThe Roseberry Topping! Gaz, it\u2019s genius. The gingerbread, the local bilberries in the cream, the spun sugar parmo on top!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a parmo, it\u2019s a delicate caramel lattice, you melt,\u201d Gareth chuckled, heading towards the pantry. \u201cAnd I\u2019m still not sure about the bilberries. Might be too tart. Prudence will pull a face like she\u2019s sucking a wasp.\u201d\n\nHe set about his work, the familiar rituals soothing the low-level hum of anxiety in his chest. The weighing of the flour, the precise measurements of ginger and black treacle, the alchemy of it all. This was his turf. In the Bake Off tent, under the glare of the lights and the scrutiny of the cameras, he felt like an imposter. A great, lumbering farm animal who\u2019d somehow wandered into a doll\u2019s house. But here, in his own kitchen, with the radio murmuring quietly in the corner and the familiar heft of a wooden spoon in his hand, he was a creator. He was in control.\n\nThe dough came together, dark and fragrant. He worked it on the floured countertop, the rhythmic push and pull of the kneading a form of meditation. Outside, a lorry rumbled past on the main road. The radio announcer, in his smooth, placid tones, was talking about a localised disruption over in Hartlepool. Something about a chemical leak at one of the industrial plants. A precautionary cordon. Nothing to worry about. Gareth barely registered it, his mind on the consistency of his gingerbread, on the exact moment of \u2018soft peak\u2019 in his whipped cream.\n\nLiam was hovering, phone in hand. \u201cThe Guardian\u2019s done a profile on all the finalists. They called you \u2018ruggedly authentic\u2019. They called Arabella\u2019s baking \u2018technically flawless but emotionally vacant\u2019. See? Narrative, Gaz. It\u2019s all about the narrative.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019d rather they called my baking \u2018tastes bloody good\u2019,\u201d Gareth muttered, shaping the dough into two rounds, ready for the tins. He was just greasing the tins when Liam\u2019s phone rang. Not with its usual jaunty, custom-composed ringtone, but the default, jarring buzz it used for unknown numbers.\n\nLiam\u2019s smile tightened. He turned away from Gareth, his voice dropping. \u201cHello?... Yes, this is he... I\u2019m not sure I understand. Now? It\u2019s just, it\u2019s a bit of a difficult time... No, no, I get that it\u2019s important.\u201d\n\nGareth paused, a lump of butter on his fingers. He could see Liam\u2019s reflection in the dark glass of the oven door. His shoulders were tense, his free hand raking through his hair. It was his \u2018something\u2019s very wrong\u2019 posture.\n\n\u201cAlright,\u201d Liam said, his voice strained. \u201cYes. I\u2019ll come now. Where?\u201d He grabbed a pen and scribbled something on the back of an envelope, a series of letters and numbers that made no sense to Gareth. \u201cOkay. I\u2019m on my way.\u201d\n\nHe hung up, his face pale.\n\n\u201cEverything alright, love?\u201d Gareth asked, wiping his hands on a tea towel.\n\n\u201cYeah. Fine,\u201d Liam said, too quickly. He wouldn't meet Gareth's eye. \u201cIt\u2019s just... a work thing. A client. Last minute panic for that gallery launch. You know how they are.\u201d\n\nGareth didn't. Liam\u2019s work was a world of fonts and pantones and deadlines that seemed entirely abstract to him. But he knew Liam. And Liam was lying. There was a tremor in his hand as he picked up his car keys from the hook by the door.\n\n\u201cIn Hartlepool, is it?\u201d Gareth asked, a vague memory of the radio report surfacing. \u201cWith that chemical leak? Be careful.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not near there. It\u2019s the other side of town,\u201d Liam said, shrugging on his coat. He came over and gave Gareth a quick, tight-lipped kiss that tasted of coffee and anxiety. His lips were cold. \u201cSmells amazing in here, by the way. Don\u2019t you dare eat a single slice of that cake until I\u2019m back. Promise?\u201d\n\n\u201cPromise,\u201d Gareth said, his own unease solidifying in his gut. \u201cWon\u2019t be long, will you?\u201d\n\n\u201cAn hour. Two, max,\u201d Liam said, already opening the door. \u201cJust got to sort this idiot out. Love you.\u201d\n\n\u201cLove you too,\u201d Gareth called after him.\n\nThe door clicked shut. Gareth listened to the crunch of Liam\u2019s tyres on the gravel drive, the sound fading until it was swallowed by the vast, indifferent silence of the fields. The kitchen suddenly felt too big. He looked at the gingerbread batter, at the carefully weighed ingredients for the filling, at the pristine, empty space where Liam had been standing. A deep, cold sense of wrongness washed over him, as unwelcome and invasive as blight on his potatoes. He shook his head, trying to dislodge the feeling. Liam was a worrier. It was a client. It was fine.\n\nHe slid the cakes into the preheated Aga, the familiar metallic clang echoing in the quiet room. Two hours, he thought. I've got two hours. Plenty of time to whip up the filling, practice the spun sugar, and get this bloody cake looking like a winner. He turned the radio up, needing the noise. The news was on. The incident in Hartlepool had been upgraded. The police were calling it a \"mass casualty event\" and advising residents to stay indoors. The announcer\u2019s voice was no longer placid. It had a new edge. An edge of something that sounded horribly like fear. Gareth stood frozen in the middle of his warm, fragrant kitchen, the scent of ginger and treacle mixing with the sudden, metallic taste of dread in his own mouth. Two hours. The clock on the wall ticked, each second a tiny hammer blow against the silence.The gingerbread was burning. He could smell it. The sweet, spicy aroma was thickening, taking on a bitter, acrid edge. The smell of failure. He yanked open the Aga\u2019s heavy door, a blast of heat hitting him in the face. The tops of the cakes were dark, almost black at the edges. He\u2019d left them in too long, distracted by the disembodied voice on the radio. With a curse, he pulled the tins out, his hands clumsy in the oven gloves, and slammed them onto the cooling rack. A small, insignificant disaster, but it felt monumental. It felt like an omen.\n\nHe leaned against the countertop, his breath coming in ragged bursts. He tried to rationalise. Hartlepool was miles away. It was a big town. Liam had said the other side, a last-minute client panic. It was plausible. Liam\u2019s clients were notoriously flaky. But the lie sat between them, a cold, hard stone in the warmth of the kitchen. Liam didn't lie. Not like that. Not with that look in his eyes, a frantic, cornered look that Gareth hadn\u2019t seen since Liam\u2019s father had been ill. This wasn\u2019t about pantones or gallery launches.\n\nHe pulled his own phone from his pocket, his thumb hovering over Liam\u2019s name. The picture he used was from their holiday in Northumberland last summer, Liam squinting into the sun, a piece of wind-whipped hair stuck to his forehead, a genuine, un-storyboarded smile on his face. He pressed \u2018call\u2019. It rang once, twice, then clicked over. *\u2018Hi, you\u2019ve reached Liam. Sorry I can\u2019t take your call. Leave a message, and I\u2019ll get back to you. Be brilliant.\u2019* The cheerful, recorded voice was a punch to the gut. Gareth hung up without leaving a message. He tried again. This time, the call didn\u2019t even connect. A recorded female voice, clipped and impersonal, informed him that the network was busy.\n\nHe paced the length of the kitchen, from the cooling gingerbread to the window overlooking the empty yard, a caged animal. The radio announcer was now interviewing an \u2018expert\u2019, a professor of toxicology who spoke in grave, measured tones about respiratory damage, neurological symptoms, and the critical importance of decontamination. The words were clinical, abstract, but they painted vivid, terrifying pictures in Gareth\u2019s mind. He imagined Liam\u2019s orange jumper, a bright, foolish beacon in a grey, chemical fog. He imagined him struggling to breathe, the clean air of the farm a distant memory.\n\nHe had to do something. He couldn't just stand here, waiting, while the smell of burned cake filled his lungs. His eyes scanned the kitchen, searching for an answer, for anything. They landed on the discarded envelope on the table, the one Liam had scribbled on. He snatched it up. It wasn't a series of letters and numbers; it was a postcode. TS24 8BY. And underneath, a single word: \u2018Hannah\u2019.\n\nGareth\u2019s blood ran cold. Hannah. Liam\u2019s sister. The sister he hadn\u2019t spoken to in five years, not since a blazing row that had fractured their family, a row Gareth had only ever heard about in vague, pained whispers. Hannah, who had a history of making bad decisions. Hannah, who, last they\u2019d heard, was living in a grim little flat in Hartlepool, working a dead-end job. Gareth\u2019s fingers fumbled as he opened Liam\u2019s laptop, still open to an article titled \u2018How to Craft the Perfect Hero\u2019s Journey\u2019. He ignored it, opening a new tab and typing the postcode into the search bar.\n\nA map appeared on the screen. A little red pin dropped onto a street name. Burnel Gardens. He switched back to the news website, which now had a live map of the incident. A thick red line was drawn in a two-mile circle around the EPIC chemical plant. The exclusion zone. Gareth\u2019s heart hammered against his ribs as he traced the streets with his finger. There it was. Burnel Gardens. Not near the cordon. Not on the edge of the cordon. It was nestled deep inside it, a stone\u2019s throw from the plant itself.\n\nThe lie wasn\u2019t a small one to spare his feelings. It was a monumental one, designed to stop him from interfering. Liam had gone into the heart of a chemical disaster zone to find his estranged sister. Of course he had. Because underneath the Scandinavian art prints and the talk of narratives, Liam was fiercely, stupidly loyal. He was the man who would drive a hundred miles in a storm to fix a friend\u2019s boiler, the man who had sat with Gareth for three solid days in a draughty barn when his prize-winning ewe was struggling to give birth. He ran towards trouble, not away from it.\n\n\u201cYou idiot,\u201d Gareth whispered to the empty room. \u201cYou absolute, bloody idiot.\u201d He looked at the ruined cakes on the rack. A Taste of Home. What a joke. Home wasn\u2019t ginger and treacle. Home was Liam, with his stupid orange jumper and his anxious energy and his unwavering belief that a farmer from Eston could win a baking competition. And he was in trouble. The Bake Off, the judges, the ridiculous #FarmerGaz hashtag\u2014it all evaporated, turning to smoke and ash like the burned edges of his cake. There was only one thing that mattered. He grabbed his coat and keys from the hook by the door, not even bothering to change out of his flour-dusted clothes. He wasn't the people's champion. He wasn't a folk hero. He was just a man whose partner had walked into a disaster, and he was going to get him back.The battered door of his Land Rover groaned in protest as he wrenched it open. The cab smelled the same as it always did: a heady mix of diesel, wet dog, and the faint, sweet scent of sheep feed. It was the smell of his life, a life that had felt solid and predictable just this morning. He threw himself into the driver's seat, the worn springs squeaking beneath his weight. The key, caked with a film of mud and grease, felt alien in his trembling hand. For a second, he thought about calling the police, telling them Liam was in there. But what would they do? Tell him to stay put? Put Liam\u2019s name on a list? They were trying to contain a disaster, not launch a rescue for one stupid, selfless man who had gone in willingly. No. This was on him.\n\nHe slammed the truck into gear, spitting gravel as he sped down the farm track. In the rearview mirror, he saw the farmhouse shrink, the buttery glow of its windows looking impossibly warm and safe. He passed the field where Gladys the broody hen was probably still sitting stubbornly on an empty nest, and the kale patch where the frost was now beginning to melt in the strengthening light. It was a world carrying on as normal, oblivious. He pushed the accelerator to the floor, the engine roaring as he hit the main road, ignoring the usual cautious pace he took on the winding country lanes. The radio was a torrent of frantic information. They were closing the A19. A two-mile cordon was being enforced. Evacuation centres were being set up in Billingham and Peterlee. Every announcement was another turn of the screw, tightening the knot of fear in his chest.\n\nTen minutes down the road, the first real sign of the chaos appeared. A stream of cars coming towards him, a slow-moving exodus. He saw the faces of the drivers through their windscreens: a mixture of panic, confusion, and blank-eyed shock. A woman was crying. A man was shouting into his phone. Then, in the distance, a wall of flashing blue and red lights, a barricade of police cars and emergency vehicles blocking the road ahead. They were funnelling all traffic away, turning them back. There was no way through. Not this way.\n\nGareth\u2019s mind, usually occupied with crop rotation and livestock prices, raced with a new and terrifying clarity. Liam had gone to Burnel Gardens. He pictured the map from the laptop, the red pin of his destination, the angry red circle of the exclusion zone. He knew this area. Not the towns, not the grid of streets, but the land underneath it all. He\u2019d driven it for years, buying and selling livestock, visiting other farms that had long since been swallowed up by industrial estates and housing developments. He knew the old ways, the forgotten tracks that stitched the fields together behind the new-build fences.\n\nHe swerved abruptly, pulling the Land Rover into the mouth of a narrow lane just before the main roadblock, earning a furious blast of a horn from the car behind him. He ignored it. The lane was little more than a dirt track, flanked by hawthorn hedges. A faded sign warned of 'Unsuitable for Motor Vehicles'. He grunted. It was unsuitable for Arabella\u2019s pristine little convertible, maybe. For his truck, it was a back-road home. He navigated the ruts and potholes from memory, the suspension groaning as the truck bucked and lurched. This was his territory. This was the narrative Liam had tried to sell: the rustic farmer. The irony was bitter. The skills Liam had romanticised for television were now the only tools he had to save him.\n\nThe truck bounced back onto a B-road, bypassing the main cordon entirely. He was closer now. The air itself felt different, heavy and still. And then he smelled it. Faint at first, but unmistakable. A sharp, astringent odour, like bleach mixed with burnt plastic. It caught in the back of his throat, a chemical ghost that had no place among the familiar scents of the countryside. The radio announcer was listing initial symptoms: dizziness, nausea, shortness of breath. Gareth instinctively held his own, as if he could keep the poisoned air out by force of will. Through a gap in the skeletal winter trees, he saw it: a plume of sickly yellow-grey smoke, rising lazily into the morning sky from the direction of the industrial coast. It wasn't just a news report anymore. It was real. And he was driving right into it.### Chapter 2\n\nThe Land Rover rattled onto tarmac, leaving the muddy farm track behind. He was in the suburbs of Hartlepool now, but it felt like a town on another planet. The silence was the first thing that struck him. It was a dead, heavy quiet, utterly different from the peace of his own fields. There were no children shouting, no dogs barking, no distant hum of traffic from the A19. The world had been muted. He drove past rows of neat semi-detached houses, their curtains drawn as if against a simple dark night and not this toxic twilight. An automatic sprinkler on one perfect lawn was still dutifully arcing water back and forth, a piece of mindless clockwork in a town where time had stopped.\n\nHe pressed deeper into the town, his knuckles white on the steering wheel. The evidence of a panicked flight was everywhere. A red Ford Focus was abandoned in the middle of a roundabout, its driver-side door hanging open. A child\u2019s scooter lay on its side on the pavement, one wheel still spinning lazily in the slight, foul-smelling breeze. A set of house keys, a bright pink fob attached, dangled from the lock of a front door, forgotten. Each detail was a small, sharp stab of vicarious terror. These were people who had grabbed their children, their wallets, maybe a pet, and fled for their lives. And Liam, his Liam, had driven deliberately into the centre of it.\n\nThe chemical smell was no longer a ghost. It was a physical presence in the cab, thick and cloying. Gareth could taste it now, a bitter, metallic film coating his tongue and the back of his throat. A dull throb had started behind his eyes. He coughed, a dry, rasping sound that did nothing to clear the irritation in his lungs. He thought of Liam\u2019s carefully curated life, his obsession with organic vegetables and filtered water, his horror at Gareth using cheap supermarket bleach. And here he was, walking into a chemical cloud for a sister who had brought him nothing but grief for years. The sheer, idiotic nobility of it made Gareth want to punch something.\n\nHe forced the anger down, channelling it into focus. He was a farmer. His mind worked in maps of fields and fences, not street names. But he\u2019d driven these roads enough to have a rough geography of the place lodged in his brain. The steelworks, the docks, the newer industrial parks, and the old terraced streets that huddled in their shadow. Burnel Gardens. The name felt like a curse. He took a right turn, then a left, following a half-remembered route towards the industrial heartland of the town, towards the rising column of smoke that now blotted out a significant portion of the sky. The light had taken on a strange, jaundiced quality, as if filtered through dirty water.\n\nAnd then he saw the sign, green and peeling: Burnel Gardens. It wasn't a garden. It was a grim, treeless cul-de-sac of three-storey flat-roofed blocks, built from a drab, soot-stained brick that seemed to soak up what little light there was. Bins had been knocked over, spilling their contents across the cracked pavement. A single, grimy window on the top floor was smashed, a dark, gaping mouth. The air here was visibly hazy, a shimmering vapour that made Gareth\u2019s eyes sting and water. This was it. This was the place Liam had lied about. The place he had walked into.\n\nHe drove slowly down the short street, his gaze sweeping across the desolate scene, his heart a cold, heavy stone in his chest. He didn't know the flat number. He didn\u2019t even know which block. He might have to get out and shout their names, a desperate, foolish act. Then he saw it. Tucked in at the far end of the street, parked with a chaotic urgency half on the pavement, was a dark blue Audi A4. Liam\u2019s car. It looked like a spaceship that had landed by mistake in a scrapyard. So polished, so clean, so utterly out of place. Relief and a fresh, sharper wave of dread washed over Gareth in equal measure. He had found him. He was here. He was still inside.\n\nGareth pulled the Land Rover to a halt beside it, the rumbling diesel engine cutting out with a final, shuddering cough. The resulting silence was absolute, broken only by the sound of his own ragged breathing and a faint, rhythmic beeping from somewhere deep within the building. It was an alarm, ignored and insistent. He pushed the heavy driver\u2019s door open and stepped out. The air hit him like a physical blow, acrid and suffocating. He pulled the collar of his coat up over his mouth and nose, a useless, instinctive gesture. He looked at the anonymous facade of the building, at the rows of dark, unseeing windows. Liam was behind one of them. He took a breath that felt like breathing in ground glass and walked towards the communal entrance, his mud-caked farm boots crunching on the littered pavement.The communal entrance door was metal, painted a colour that might once have been green, and it wasn't locked. It swung open with a low groan into a narrow, windowless hallway that smelled even worse than the street outside. Here, the chemical odour was trapped, mingled with the stale, sour notes of damp and decay. The rhythmic beeping was louder, a frantic, electronic heartbeat coming from somewhere above. Gareth\u2019s eyes, already streaming, struggled to adjust to the gloom. The only light came from the open doorway behind him. A flight of bare concrete stairs led upwards into darkness.\n\nHe took them two at a time, his hand trailing against the gritty, damp wall for balance. The air grew thicker with every step, a visible miasma under the single, flickering emergency light on the first-floor landing. His head swam, and a wave of nausea rolled through him. He paused, leaning against the wall, fighting the urge to retch. The beeping was almost deafening now, originating from the floor above. It was a smoke alarm, he realised, its sensor likely triggered by the dense chemical particles in the air. He forced himself onwards, his boots making hollow, echoing thuds on the concrete, a lonely sound in the profound silence.\n\nThe second-floor landing was a small, square space with four identical, battered doors. The alarm was coming from behind one of them: 7B. The sound was a high-pitched, insistent shriek that grated on his already frayed nerves. A piece of paper, a final demand notice, had been wedged under the door and was now scuffed and trampled. He didn't hesitate. He hammered his fist against the thin wood, the sound barely audible over the piercing alarm. \u201cLiam!\u201d he roared, his voice cracking. \u201cLiam, are you in there?\u201d\n\nThere was no answer. Only the relentless, maddening beep. He could feel the poison in the air seeping into him, a cold heaviness settling in his chest. Panic, cold and sharp, cut through the dizzying fog in his brain. He wasn't going to stand here and die waiting. He grabbed the doorknob. It was locked. \u201cLiam!\u201d he shouted again, then stepped back. He threw his full weight against the door, his shoulder connecting with the flimsy frame just beside the lock. The wood splintered with a sharp crack, but held. He did it again, a guttural roar of effort tearing from his raw throat. On the third impact, the cheap lock burst from its housing and the door flew inwards, slamming against an interior wall.\n\nGareth stumbled across the threshold into the flat, his vision swimming. The room was a disaster. Piles of clothes, takeaway containers, and overflowing ashtrays covered every surface. The air was thick with the reek of stale smoke and old food, a foul undertone to the dominant chemical stench. The shrieking smoke alarm was directly above his head, its little red light flashing in the gloom. And in the middle of the chaos, he saw them. A thin, pale woman with lank, dark hair was slumped on a sofa, her head lolled to one side, her breathing shallow and ragged. And kneeling on the floor beside her, his bright orange jumper a shocking slash of colour against the grime, was Liam. He was holding the woman\u2019s hand, his head bowed, his shoulders shaking with violent, racking coughs that echoed wetly in the small room. He didn\u2019t seem to have heard Gareth come in.For a frozen second, Gareth was rooted to the spot, his brain unable to process the tableau. The shrieking alarm, the squalor, Liam's convulsive coughing, and the still, pale form of the woman on the sofa all merged into a single, nightmarish image. Then, instinct took over. He lunged forward, stumbling over a pile of magazines, and grabbed Liam\u2019s shoulder, shaking him hard. \u201cLiam!\u201d\n\nLiam\u2019s head snapped up. His face, usually so animated and alive, was ashen grey, his lips tinged with blue. His eyes were wide with a frantic, unfocused terror, slick with tears that might have been from the chemicals or from despair. It took him a moment to recognise the flour-dusted man holding him. \u201cGaz?\u201d he rasped, his voice a shredded whisper. The name was followed by another gut-wrenching cough that doubled him over. He gestured weakly towards the sofa. \u201cHannah\u2026 she won\u2019t\u2026 she won\u2019t wake up.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have to go. Now,\u201d Gareth said, his voice a low, urgent growl. He didn't waste a glance at the woman. His only focus was the man gasping for air on the floor. He hauled Liam up, his arm hooking under Liam\u2019s own, taking most of his weight. Liam was limp, his energy spent. \u201cWe are leaving. Right now.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, we can\u2019t leave her,\u201d Liam protested, trying to pull away, a pathetic gesture of resistance. \u201cI came to get her. I can\u2019t just\u2026 leave her here to die.\u201d His gaze was fixed on his sister\u2019s placid, worryingly still face. The frantic beeping of the alarm seemed to count down the seconds they were losing, the seconds the poison was working its way deeper into their lungs.\n\nGareth understood. In that one, desperate plea, he saw the whole, stupid, heartbreaking story. The argument, the five years of silence, the guilt, and Liam\u2019s impossible, self-destructive need to make it right, even if it cost him everything. \u201cRight then,\u201d Gareth said, his voice devoid of any emotion but grim resolve. \u201cWe take her with us.\u201d He looked from Liam\u2019s devastated face to the piercing smoke alarm on the ceiling. He reached up, his greater height allowing him to get a firm grip on the plastic casing, and tore it from its mounting with a single, furious wrench. The shriek was cut off abruptly. The silence that rushed in was suddenly heavier, deeper, filled only with the sound of three people struggling to breathe.\n\nHe turned to the sofa. \u201cYou take her feet. I\u2019ll take her shoulders. On three.\u201d Liam, spurred into action by Gareth's certainty, nodded, wiping his streaming eyes with the back of his hand. He shuffled to the end of the sofa, his movements clumsy and uncoordinated. Gareth bent down, sliding his arms under the woman\u2019s back and shoulders. She was terrifyingly light, a bird-boned fragility beneath her thin jumper. \u201cOne\u2026 two\u2026 three!\u201d They lifted together. Hannah was a dead weight, her head lolling back with a horrifying looseness. Liam staggered, his knees buckling, and Gareth took the strain, his back and shoulder muscles, honed by decades of manual labour, screaming in protest.\n\nThe journey to the door was a shuffling, stumbling nightmare. They scraped against the grimy wall, knocked over a lamp that crashed to the floor unseen in the gloom. The two flights of concrete stairs were a descent into hell. Liam\u2019s coughing worsened, each gasp for air a wet, tearing sound that scared Gareth more than the chemical fog. He was faltering, his grip on Hannah\u2019s ankles slackening. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare drop her, Liam,\u201d Gareth snarled, not out of anger but sheer terror. The command seemed to find a spark in Liam, who tightened his hold, his knuckles white. Gareth moved backwards down the stairs, one cautious step at a time, bearing the brunt of the weight, the muscles in his thighs burning, his own lungs feeling as if they were full of hot sand.\n\nThey burst out of the communal door into the hazy, yellow light of the street. The air outside was no elixir, but it was thinner, less concentrated than the toxic soup in the hallway. Gareth sucked in a breath that was still painful, but felt like oxygen after the suffocation inside. He didn't pause. He half-dragged, half-carried his part of their burden across the pavement to the Land Rover. \u201cOpen the back,\u201d he grunted at Liam. Liam fumbled with the handle, his fingers seemingly refusing to obey him, but finally managed to pull the heavy door open. Together, they manoeuvred Hannah onto the back seat, an awkward, undignified process that left her lying in a heap on the worn upholstery.\n\nLiam collapsed against the side of the truck, his body wracked with another fit of coughing, his forehead pressed against the cold metal. He looked utterly broken. There was no time for comfort, no time for \u2018I told you so\u2019. Gareth grabbed him by the collar of his ridiculously bright jumper, now stained with grime, and bundled him into the front passenger seat as if he were a sack of feed. He slammed the door shut, ran around to the driver's side, and threw himself behind the wheel. He slammed his own door, sealing the three of them inside the cab. For a moment, there was only the sound of Liam's agonised breathing and the quiet ticking of the cooling engine. Gareth looked at his partner, slumped and gasping, and at the reflection of the still, silent woman in the rearview mirror. He had found them. Now he just had to get them out alive. He jammed the key into the ignition and the old diesel engine coughed, sputtered, and roared back into life.### Chapter 3\n\nThe Land Rover roared, its old diesel engine a coarse, defiant shout in the dead quiet of Burnel Gardens. Gareth didn\u2019t look back. He shoved the gearstick into first, and the truck leaped forward, its tyres crunching over unseen debris. His focus narrowed to a single, sharp point: the end of the street. He drove with a ferocity he usually reserved for wrestling a stubborn ram at shearing time, his hands locked on the wheel, his knuckles like knots of bone. Beside him, Liam\u2019s breathing was a terrible, liquid metronome counting out the seconds they were losing. Each wet, ragged gasp was a spur, pushing Gareth faster.\n\nHe navigated the ghost town by a primal kind of dead reckoning. The street signs were meaningless; his internal compass was tuned to the direction of the clean air, the way back to the hills. He shot through a red light at a deserted intersection without a second thought. The world outside the windscreen was a series of surreal vignettes: a line of empty prams outside a shuttered nursery, a flock of pigeons pecking at a spilled bag of chips, oblivious to the invisible poison they were breathing. The yellow haze seemed to cling to the buildings, a visible stain of disaster. Gareth felt a tremor in his own hands, a dizzying lightness in his head. He was breathing it too. How much time did they have before he was as useless as Liam?\n\n\u201cGaz\u2026\u201d Liam\u2019s voice was a thread of sound, barely there. \u201cIt hurts\u2026 to breathe.\u201d\n\nGareth risked a glance. Liam\u2019s eyes were half-closed, his face slick with a cold sweat that plastered his hair to his temples. The vibrant orange of his jumper seemed to be mocking his fading vitality. \u201cJust hold on,\u201d Gareth commanded, his voice rougher than he intended. \u201cJust hold on. We\u2019re nearly out.\u201d He reached over, his hand clumsy and large, and gripped Liam\u2019s knee. The contact was meant to be reassuring, but through the denim of Liam's jeans, he could feel a fine, violent trembling.\n\nHe saw the roadblock ahead before he heard it: a solid wall of flashing blue lights sealing off a major artery out of the town. Police cars, ambulances, a fire engine, all parked diagonally to form an impassable barrier. He couldn't go that way. They\u2019d be stopped, questioned, dragged into a chaos of decontamination tents and overwhelmed paramedics. They\u2019d be separated. The thought was a shard of ice in his gut. He slammed on the brakes, the Land Rover skidding to a halt, and wrenched the wheel hard left, turning down a residential street of identical new-build houses. It was a gamble, a blind dive into the suburban maze.\n\nThe throb in his head was a blacksmith\u2019s hammer now. He drove on, the neat, manicured lawns and pristine driveways blurring past. He was looking for a gap, a seam, any kind of escape route that wasn't an official road. And then he saw it. At the end of a cul-de-sac, where the developer\u2019s plans had met the old world, was a simple wooden fence. And beyond it, a familiar sight: a gently sloping field of winter wheat, its pale green shoots a promise of life. It was farmland. It was his world.\n\n\u201cHold on,\u201d he grunted, more to himself than to Liam. He didn't slow down. The Land Rover mounted the pavement, crushed a meticulously cultivated rose bush, and smashed head-on into the fence. The wooden panels exploded into splinters. With a jarring lurch, the truck was off the tarmac and onto the soft, yielding earth of the field. The ride was suddenly rough, the truck bucking and heaving as its tyres sank into the damp soil, but it was moving. It was progress. In the rearview mirror, Gareth saw Hannah\u2019s limp form slide across the back seat with the motion, her face mercifully hidden from view.\n\nHe ploughed a muddy scar across the winter wheat, aiming for a stand of skeletal oak trees on the far side that he knew marked an old drover\u2019s road. The chemical smell began to recede, diluted by the cleaner air blowing in from the sea. Or perhaps his senses were just becoming numb to it. The flashing lights of the cordon disappeared behind them, swallowed by the housing estate. They were out. They had breached the perimeter. A wave of profound, dizzying relief washed over him, so potent it almost made him stop. But Liam coughed again, a deep, rattling sound that brought fresh bile to the back of Gareth\u2019s throat. The escape wasn\u2019t over. It had just entered a new stage.\n\nHe found the drover\u2019s road and followed its winding, rutted path back towards the familiar lanes that crisscrossed the countryside around his farm. The twenty-minute drive felt like an eternity. Liam had fallen silent, his head lolling against the passenger window. His shivering had stopped. That, somehow, was worse. Gareth kept talking to him, a low, running monologue of nonsense. \u201cNearly there, love. See? There\u2019s the old quarry. Remember we came here for a picnic? You hated the wasps. Nearly home. I\u2019ll put the kettle on. Just a few more minutes, Liam. Stay with me.\u201d He didn\u2019t know if Liam could hear him. He didn\u2019t care. The sound of his own voice was the only thing keeping the rising tide of panic at bay.\n\nAs he turned onto his own farm track, the sight of the farmhouse, solid and dependable, hunkered against the Eston Hills, nearly broke him. Home. He\u2019d left it that morning, a baker worried about his signature challenge. He was returning a fugitive, a kidnapper, a rescuer, with a cab full of poison and two lives hanging by a thread. He brought the Land Rover to a stop in the middle of the yard, the engine shuddering into silence. The quiet that followed was a blessing. The air, when he cracked open the window, smelled of damp earth and cow muck. It was the most beautiful smell in the world.\n\nHe sat for a moment, his forehead resting on the steering wheel, his body screaming with exhaustion and a deep, cellular ache. The adrenaline was draining away, leaving a hollow, terrifying weakness in its place. But he couldn't rest. He straightened up, his back protesting with a familiar, agonised groan. He looked at Liam, so terrifyingly still. Then he opened the driver\u2019s door. From the kitchen, through the thick stone walls, he could just faintly smell it. The bitter, acrid scent of his ruined gingerbread. The smell of another life.He stumbled out of the Land Rover, his legs unsteady beneath him. The cold, clean air of the farm was a shock after the toxic fug of the town, but it did little to clear the fog in his head. His body was a symphony of aches, a deep, resonant pain that went all the way to his bones. He stood for a moment in the gravel yard, caught between the rumbling silence of the Land Rover\u2019s engine and the oppressive quiet of the house. From the kitchen window, he could just make out the two blackened cake tins on the cooling rack. A lifetime ago.\n\nThere was no time for exhaustion. He wrenched open the passenger door. Liam was slumped against the window, his chest rising and falling in shallow, hitching movements. His eyes were closed. \u201cLiam,\u201d Gareth said, his voice a hoarse croak. \u201cWe\u2019re home. Come on, love. I need you to move.\u201d There was no response. Gareth reached in, unbuckling the seatbelt and gathering Liam into his arms. Liam was a dead weight, his body pliant and terrifyingly unresponsive. With a grunt of effort that tore at his already strained back, Gareth hauled him out of the cab and half-carried, half-dragged him across the yard, away from the house.\n\nHe didn\u2019t go towards the warm, buttery light of the kitchen. He went towards the cavernous darkness of the big Dutch barn. The familiar smells of hay, dust, and livestock washed over him, a scent of sanity in a world gone mad. He found a pile of clean straw in an empty stall and gently laid Liam down. Liam\u2019s head lolled to one side, his face a waxy, unnatural colour in the gloom. Gareth pushed his damp hair back from his forehead, his rough thumb tracing the line of his jaw. \u201cJust a bit longer,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI\u2019ll sort this.\u201d\n\nHe turned and strode back to the truck, his movements stiff but purposeful. Now for Hannah. He felt no tenderness, only a grim sense of responsibility. She was the cause, the catalyst, but she was also Liam\u2019s sister, and leaving her to die had never been an option. He pulled open the rear door and hauled her out with a blunt, functional strength, hooking his shoulder under her middle and carrying her in a fireman\u2019s lift. She was lighter than Liam, but her stillness was more profound, more absolute. He carried her into the barn and deposited her on another pile of straw a few feet from her brother, his movements efficient and detached.\n\nHe found the long green hosepipe coiled by the cattle trough, its brass nozzle glinting dully. He turned the cast-iron tap, and with a judder, icy water blasted from the end. This was the part he dreaded. He knelt beside Liam, his heart twisting. With methodical, grim-faced determination, he began to cut and tear the clothes from Liam\u2019s body. The bright orange jumper, a thing of such vibrant life just hours before, was now a filthy, contaminated rag. He stripped him bare, his movements gentle despite their urgency, and threw the clothes into a heap in the corner. Then he took the hose and began to wash him down, the freezing water splashing onto the straw. Liam gasped, his body convulsing as the cold shocked him, a faint moan escaping his lips. It was the most welcome sound Gareth had ever heard. He grabbed a bar of the harsh, carbolic soap he used for scouring the milk buckets and scrubbed Liam\u2019s skin, his hair, every inch of him, trying to wash away the invisible poison.\n\nWhen he was done, he turned to Hannah. The process was the same, but the feeling was entirely different. There was no tenderness here, only a brutal, necessary cleansing. He cut her clothes away with his penknife, his gaze averted, and scrubbed her down with the same dispassionate force, as if he were scouring a piece of machinery. He worked quickly, efficiently, the only sound the hiss of the water and his own ragged breathing. Finally, he turned the hose on himself, stripping off his own clothes and gasping as the numbing cold hit his skin. He stood shivering in the vast, draughty barn, the water pooling around his bare feet, washing away the grime and the sweat and, he prayed, the toxins.\n\nFrom the tack room, he fetched two old, thick horse blankets. They smelled of lanolin and dust, the scent of honest work. He wrapped Liam first, swaddling him carefully, tucking the rough wool under his chin. He held his fingers to Liam\u2019s neck, feeling for the faint, thready pulse. It was there. Weak, but it was there. He wrapped the second blanket around Hannah, then grabbed a third for himself, pulling it around his own shivering shoulders. He was a great, lumbering shape in the gloom, his skin red and raw from the cold. He looked at the two figures cocooned in the dark wool. The escape was over. The siege was just beginning.\n\nCarrying Liam to the house was the hardest physical task of Gareth\u2019s life. He gathered him up, blanket and all, and the weight seemed to have doubled. Every step across the yard was an agony, his muscles screaming, his lungs burning. He kicked the back door open and stumbled into the warmth of the kitchen. The smell of burned gingerbread and treacle was overpowering, a sweet, cloying monument to his shattered morning. He ignored it, carrying Liam through to the living room and laying him gently on the big, comfortable sofa that faced the cold hearth.\n\nHe went back for Hannah. The second journey was fuelled by the last dregs of his adrenaline. He carried her in and deposited her, with far less ceremony, into the large wingback armchair in the corner of the room, a silent, shrouded figure in the shadows. Finally, he slumped against the doorframe, his own horse blanket clutched around him, dripping water onto the flagstone floor. He was a wild, primitive thing in his own home. He looked at Liam, pale and still on the sofa, at Hannah, a motionless lump in the chair, and at the ticking clock on the mantelpiece. He had brought them home. But home was no longer a sanctuary. It was a prison, and a hospital, and he was the only guard.The first priority was warmth. The deep, penetrating cold of the water and the lingering shock had to be fought. Shivering, still wrapped in his own damp horse blanket, Gareth moved to the hearth. His hands, clumsy and stiff, fumbled with the kindling and logs in the basket. He worked with a grim, automatic competence, the familiar ritual of building a fire a small, steadying anchor in the chaos. He crumpled pages from an old copy of the *Farmer\u2019s Weekly*, laid the kindling in a lattice, and struck a match. The flame caught, a fragile flicker of orange that grew steadily, casting dancing shadows on the walls and, most importantly, on Liam\u2019s pale, still face.\n\nHe fetched every blanket and duvet he could find from upstairs, piling them onto Liam until he was buried under a mound of wool and goose-down. He knelt by the sofa, placing his ear close to Liam\u2019s mouth. The breath came in shallow, stuttering rasps, a faint wheezing sound on the exhale. It was the sound his old Border Collie, Jess, had made in her final days with pneumonia. The memory sent a bolt of pure, undiluted terror through him. He gently tilted Liam\u2019s head back, trying to open his airway, his farmer\u2019s hands, so used to clearing the passages of newborn lambs, feeling clumsy and useless against the delicate human form of the man he loved.\n\nWith Liam tended to for the moment, he forced himself to turn his attention to the woman in the armchair. He approached her as he would a nervous animal, with reluctance and a sense of duty. He pulled back the rough blanket from her face. In the growing firelight, he could see she was younger than he\u2019d imagined, her face gaunt, with dark circles under her eyes that spoke of more than just chemical exposure. Her lips were cracked, and a small, faded tattoo of a butterfly peeked out from the collar of the blanket. He felt for a pulse in her neck. It was there, a faint, fluttery beat, as fragile as the tattoo. Her breathing was almost imperceptible. She was a stranger who had brought a plague to his door, yet she was also Liam's blood, and for that reason alone, he tucked the blanket more securely around her, a gesture of grim acceptance.\n\nAs he stood up, the room tilted violently. The blacksmith\u2019s hammer in his head struck a deafening blow, and a wave of nausea so powerful it made his knees buckle sent him staggering towards the kitchen. He barely made it to the sink before he was violently sick, his body convulsing as it tried to expel the poison he\u2019d inhaled. He retched until there was nothing left but bitter bile, his throat raw, his body shaking uncontrollably. He gripped the edge of the stone sink, gasping for air, his reflection in the dark kitchen window a wild, haggard stranger. He couldn\u2019t be sick. He was the strong one, the healthy one. If he went down, they all went down. He splashed his face with cold water from the tap, the shock of it clearing his head for a moment, and stared at his own reflection. The #FarmerGaz hashtag Liam had been so proud of. The people\u2019s champion. He looked like a cornered beast.\n\nHe forced himself back into the living room, his own weakness a new enemy to be fought. He needed information. He switched on the small, portable radio on the bookshelf, keeping the volume low. A stern, official voice replaced the usual gentle tones of the afternoon show. \u201c\u2026reiterate, the exclusion zone is total. Any residents remaining within the cordon are advised to stay indoors, seal all doors and windows, and await instruction. Do not, under any circumstances, attempt to leave the area. Emergency services are stretched to capacity. Decontamination centres are operational at\u2026\u201d Gareth switched it off. It was useless. They were offering advice for those still trapped inside. There was no advice for those who had escaped, carrying the contamination with them. They were on their own, an island of infection in a sea of normality.\n\nThe afternoon bled away into a long, grey dusk. The fire crackled and spat, the only lively thing in the room. Gareth sat in the one remaining armchair, a sentinel watching over his two patients. He didn't move, except to put more logs on the fire or to check Liam\u2019s breathing. He watched the rise and fall of the mound of blankets, praying for each shallow breath. He thought of the Bake Off tent, a place of bright lights, cheerful camaraderie, and perfectly piped buttercream. It seemed as preposterous and distant as a half-remembered dream. All that mattered now was the rasp of air in this quiet, fire-lit room. The clock on the mantelpiece, a wedding gift from Liam\u2019s parents, ticked on, each second a tiny hammer blow, marking not the time until his showstopper was due, but the slow, agonizing passage of a siege he didn't know how to win.### Chapter 4\n\nNight fell, not with the gentle fading of a summer\u2019s evening, but like a heavy black shutter slamming down on the farmhouse. Outside, the familiar sounds of the rural dark\u2014the hoot of an owl, the distant bark of a fox\u2014were drowned out by the roaring of the wind that had picked up, rattling the window frames as if trying to find a way in. Inside, the only sounds were the crackle and hiss of the logs in the hearth and the shallow, laboured counterpoint of two people struggling to breathe. Gareth sat wedged into the armchair, the horse blanket still draped over his shoulders, a silent, unmoving guardian. The exhaustion he\u2019d held at bay for hours was now a physical presence, a crushing weight on his chest and a gritty burning behind his eyes. Sleep was a siren, luring him towards a soft, dark oblivion, but he fought it with a grim tenacity, knowing that if he succumbed, the fire might die, and with it, the fragile warmth that was keeping them all alive.\n\nHe forced himself to move, his joints creaking in protest. Each step was a deliberate act of will. He added another log to the fire, the wood catching with a shower of sparks that momentarily lit the room in a flare of orange. In that brief, bright light, he saw Liam\u2019s face clearly. It was flushed with fever, a sheen of sweat on his forehead despite the mountain of blankets. He was stirring, his head moving restlessly on the cushion, a low moan catching in his throat. Gareth knelt beside the sofa, his heart clenching. He took a tea towel from the kitchen, soaked it in a bowl of cold water, and gently bathed Liam's face and neck. The skin was shockingly hot to the touch.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s alright, love,\u201d Gareth whispered, his voice a low rumble. \u201cI\u2019m here. Just rest.\u201d Liam\u2019s eyes fluttered, but didn't open. He muttered something, a jumble of words lost in a wheezing breath. Gareth leaned closer, straining to hear. \u201c...sorry... Gaz... the cake...\u201d The words were a knife twisting in Gareth's gut. Even in his fevered delirium, Liam was apologising, his mind still tangled in the ruins of their ordinary Tuesday morning. Gareth\u2019s throat tightened. He thought of Liam\u2019s storyboards, his ridiculous hashtags, his unwavering, almost childlike belief in Gareth\u2019s abilities. It was all for him. And this, the lying, the reckless trip into a chemical hell, this was for his sister. Liam\u2019s loyalties were fierce, absolute things, and Gareth, kneeling beside him in the firelight, loved him for it with an aching, desperate intensity.\n\nDuty, cold and unwelcome, pulled him away. He crossed the room to the wingback chair where Hannah lay. He hadn\u2019t given her any water yet, a small, vindictive part of him reasoning that she was the source of this nightmare. But looking at her now, a shrouded, anonymous shape, the anger felt petty and useless. He lifted her head, which was surprisingly heavy, and dribbled a little water from a spoon between her cracked lips. Most of it ran down her chin, but she swallowed once, a reflexive, bird-like motion. Her pulse was still a faint, thready beat against his fingertips. She was a problem he would solve for Liam. Nothing more. He pulled the blanket back up to her chin and turned away.\n\nThe hours crawled by, each one a small victory against the darkness. Gareth patrolled the small space of the living room, a restless animal in his own den. The headache had settled into a dull, persistent ache behind his eyes, and a sour, metallic taste coated his tongue that no amount of water could wash away. He was sick, he knew it. He could feel the poison working on him, a slow, creeping fatigue that made his limbs feel like lead. But his own symptoms were a distant concern, a low hum of static behind the screaming urgency of Liam\u2019s condition.\n\nSometime after midnight, the crisis came. The wheezing in Liam\u2019s chest suddenly worsened, escalating into a harsh, choking rattle. He began to cough, a deep, unproductive sound that shook his entire body. His face, already flushed, took on a dusky, purplish hue in the firelight. He was drowning. Panic, absolute and electrifying, seized Gareth. For one terrible, frozen moment, he was back in the barn with the struggling ewe, seeing the life flicker and fail. He grabbed the phone from the mantelpiece, his thumb hovering over the emergency call button. The image of flashing blue lights, of faceless figures in protective suits taking Liam away from him, of being separated and questioned in a sterile, impersonal hospital, flooded his mind. They wouldn't understand. They would treat them like a contamination risk, not like people. He would lose him in the system.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d he snarled to the empty room. He tossed the phone onto the sofa. He had brought them here to keep them safe, and he would not hand them over to strangers now. He fell back on his own knowledge, the hard-won, practical wisdom of a stockman. He hauled Liam up, turning him onto his side. \"Cough, Liam! You have to cough it up!\" he commanded, his voice a harsh bark. He began to strike him firmly between the shoulder blades with the heel of his hand, a technique he\u2019d used a hundred times to clear the lungs of a newborn calf. It felt brutal, violent, but it was all he had. On the third strike, Liam gave a great, shuddering retch, and a thick stream of fluid gushed from his mouth onto the floorboards. The relief was so immediate, so profound, that Gareth almost collapsed. Liam fell back against the cushions, gasping, but the dreadful rattling was gone. The air was moving in and out of his lungs again, raggedly, but it was moving.\n\nThe rest of the night passed in a state of hyper-vigilant exhaustion. Gareth didn't sit down again. He paced, he tended the fire, he wiped Liam\u2019s face, he listened to every single breath. As the black of the window began to soften to a deep, bruised purple, he sensed a change. The frantic heat radiating from Liam\u2019s body had lessened. The restless tossing had ceased. Gareth laid a hand on his forehead. It was still warm, but the raging fever had broken, leaving behind a damp, clammy coolness. Liam was sleeping, a deep, natural sleep, his breathing finally evening out into a quiet, steady rhythm.\n\nUtterly spent, Gareth sagged against the mantelpiece. He had faced down the crisis and, for now, he had won. He looked out the window. The first light, thin and grey as dishwater, was just creeping over the Eston Hills, catching the dew on the fields. It was the same light as the morning before. A whole universe had existed in the twenty-four hours between that sunrise and this one. He had left home a baker. He had become a rescuer, a fugitive, a nurse. He didn't know what the new day would bring, what new battles would have to be fought. But as he watched the light strengthen over the land he knew better than his own skin, a single, stubborn thought took root: he had gotten them through the night. And he would get them through the day.The victory was a fragile thing, brittle as frost. As the sun climbed higher, asserting its cold, clear light over the landscape, the adrenaline that had sustained Gareth through the night began to recede, leaving a chasm of exhaustion in its wake. His body felt like a foreign country, every muscle and joint a geography of pain. He sat in the armchair, the horse blanket still around his shoulders, and watched the steady, precious rise and fall of the blankets on the sofa. Liam was breathing. That was the only thought that had any weight, any meaning. The fire had burned down to a heap of glowing red embers, and a chill was beginning to creep back into the room, a reminder that the world had not stopped turning, that his small, desperate battle was not the only thing happening.\n\nThe animals wouldn't wait. The thought rose through the fog in his mind, a simple, non-negotiable fact of life. The chickens needed letting out and feeding, the single milking cow he kept for the house would be uncomfortable, her udder full. For a moment, the sheer, mundane weight of it all felt impossible. But the routine was also a lifeline. It was a piece of the world that still made sense. Stiffly, his back screaming in protest, Gareth pushed himself to his feet. He found a set of old, dry overalls and a thick jumper in the utility room, pulling them on over his raw, chilled skin. The act of dressing was an effort, his fingers clumsy, his movements slow and deliberate as an old man\u2019s.\n\nOutside, the world was painfully, beautifully normal. The air was sharp and clean, scouring his raw lungs. A light frost still silvered the grass in the shadows. He walked to the hen house, the familiar crunch of gravel under his boots a comforting rhythm. He scattered feed, his movements automatic, his mind a thousand miles away, back in the fire-lit living room. He leaned his forehead against the flank of the cow in the small milking parlour, the animal\u2019s warmth and placid cud-chewing a temporary balm. The rhythmic pull and squeeze of milking was a meditation, a physical task that required no thought, allowing his mind to circle the terrible truths of their situation. They were trapped. They were sick. And he had no idea what to do next.\n\nWhen he returned to the house, carrying a pail of fresh, warm milk, the atmosphere inside had changed. The weak morning light illuminated the squalor of their makeshift hospital: the spilled fluid on the floorboards, the discarded, contaminated clothes in the corner, the heap of blankets. It looked sordid and desperate. And in the middle of it, on the sofa, Liam\u2019s eyes were open. They weren't the wild, feverish eyes of the night before. They were cloudy with confusion, but they were his. He was looking at Gareth.\n\n\"You're awake,\" Gareth said, his voice a rough croak. He put the milk pail down on the hearth, his hands trembling slightly.\n\nLiam tried to push himself up, a weak, fumbling motion, before falling back against the cushions. \"Gaz?\" he whispered, his throat raw. \"What\u2026 what happened? My head feels like it's full of broken glass.\" He looked around the room, his gaze settling on the figure in the armchair, then back to Gareth, a dawning horror entering his eyes. \"Hartlepool. Oh god. Hannah.\"\n\n\"I came and got you,\" Gareth said simply, pulling a small footstool to the side of the sofa and sitting down, his large frame hunched. \"Both of you.\"\n\nLiam stared at him, his expression a mixture of disbelief, relief, and a crushing, visible guilt. \"You came in? After me? Gaz, you shouldn't have. It was a bloody disaster zone. You could have been\u2026\" He couldn't finish the sentence. He just shook his head, a single tear tracking a clean path through the grime on his temple. \"I'm so sorry.\"\n\nAs if summoned by the mention of her name, a low groan came from the wingback chair. A hand emerged from the blanket, thin and pale, and pushed the heavy wool away. Hannah was awake. She blinked slowly, her pupils contracting in the daylight. Her dark, matted hair was plastered to her skull, and her face, in the unforgiving morning light, was sallow and drawn. She looked around the unfamiliar room with a wild, cornered-animal panic, her gaze darting from the fire to Gareth, and finally settling on Liam. Her expression was not one of relief or sisterly concern. It was hard, and bitter, and deeply suspicious.\n\n\"Liam?\" she rasped, her voice thick with sleep and sickness. \"What the hell have you done? Where am I?\"### Chapter 5\n\nThe question hung in the cold air of the room, sharp and jagged as a shard of broken glass. Liam flinched as if struck, his face, already pale with sickness, crumpling with a familiar, weary pain. He tried to push himself up again, a little more desperately this time. \"Hannah, I\u2026 I was worried. When I heard about the leak, I knew where your flat was. I had to come.\" His voice was a raw, pleading whisper, an apology five years in the making.\n\n\"You had to come?\" she repeated, her voice acquiring a venomous strength that belied her physical weakness. She pulled the horse blanket tighter around her thin shoulders, a defensive barrier against him, against the room, against the whole world. \"You had to come and do what? Play the hero? Drag me out of my life because you decided it wasn't good enough? Again? You haven't spoken to me in five years, Liam, not one single word, and then you just kick my door down and decide you're my saviour? What do you want, a medal?\"\n\nGareth stood by the hearth, the pail of milk forgotten in his hand. He watched the exchange, a low, guttural anger beginning to burn through the fog of his exhaustion. He had pictured this moment, if he\u2019d allowed himself to picture anything beyond the next breath, as a tearful reunion, a reconciliation born of trauma. The reality was this ugly, bitter pantomime, a re-enactment of an old wound, raw and festering. He saw the way Liam withered under her attack, the way his shoulders slumped in defeat. He had seen that look before, in the early days of their relationship, whenever Liam spoke of his family. It was the look of a man who had been trying and failing to please someone his entire life.\n\n\"It wasn't like that,\" Liam stammered, his gaze dropping to the floor. \"I just wanted to make sure you were safe.\"\n\n\"Safe?\" Hannah let out a harsh, barking laugh that dissolved into a hacking cough. She clutched her chest, her face contorting in pain. When she looked up again, her eyes were swimming with unshed, angry tears. \"I was fine. I was sleeping. Then you and your\u2026 farmer boyfriend turn up like the bloody apocalypse and now I'm here. Wherever the hell 'here' is.\" She gestured vaguely at the rustic room, at the dying fire and the stone walls, her expression one of profound disgust.\n\nThat was the final straw. The casual, dismissive contempt in her voice, the utter lack of comprehension of what had happened, what they had all just survived, ignited Gareth\u2019s temper like a stray spark in a dry barn. \u201cEnough!\u201d The word was a roar, a physical force that silenced the room. Both Liam and Hannah flinched, staring at him as if seeing him for the first time. He took a step forward, the floorboards groaning under his weight, his huge frame seeming to fill the entire space. His headache was a blinding, white-hot agony, and the last of his patience had been burned away.\n\n\u201cHere,\u201d he snarled, his voice low and shaking with fury, \u201cis my home. And you are in it because your brother, your brother who you seem to despise so much, walked into a chemical disaster to pull you out of a flat you were too passed out to even know was filling with poison. And I,\u201d he jabbed a thick, trembling finger at his own chest, \u201cwalked in after him. So forgive me if I\u2019m not particularly interested in your five-year-old family squabbles right now. We are all sick. We are all breathing god-knows-what. And I didn\u2019t risk my life, and his, just to listen to you spit bile at the only person on this planet who was stupid enough to come and get you.\u201d\n\nThe silence that followed was absolute, broken only by the faint ticking of the clock on the mantelpiece. Liam stared at Gareth, his mouth slightly agape, a look of stunned awe on his face. Hannah had shrunk back into the armchair, her bitter defiance replaced by a wide-eyed, wary stillness. She was looking at Gareth not as Liam's 'farmer boyfriend', but as a large, dangerous man who was utterly, terrifyingly serious. For the first time since she had woken up, she looked afraid.\n\nGareth took a deep, shuddering breath, the anger leaving him as quickly as it had come, replaced by a vast, hollow weariness. He ran a hand over his face, the rough stubble rasping against his palm. \u201cRight,\u201d he said, his voice flat now, devoid of heat. \u201cHere\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen. We are going to drink some water. We are going to try and eat something. And then I am going to make a phone call. And you,\u201d he looked directly at Hannah, his gaze hard and unwavering, \u201care going to be quiet.\u201d He turned away from them, his point made, and strode into the kitchen, his back a rigid wall of dismissal. He felt their eyes on him, but he didn't care. The dynamic in the room had shifted. He was no longer just the driver, the rescuer. He was in charge.\n\nHe returned a few minutes later with three mugs of water and a plate of dry bread, the only food he could stomach the thought of preparing. He handed a mug to Liam, who took it with a grateful, trembling hand. He then walked over to Hannah and held out the other mug and a slice of bread. She hesitated for a moment, her jaw tight, before taking them from him, her fingers brushing his. Her hand was as cold as ice. He said nothing, simply turned and went back to his own chair, taking a long, slow swallow of water that did little to quench the fire in his throat. They sat in a tense, fragile truce, the only sound the soft clink of a mug against the hearth. The argument was over, but the real problems were just beginning. Gareth picked up his mobile phone from the floor where it had fallen, its screen dark. He scrolled through his contacts, past the vet, the feed merchant, the livestock haulier. He needed help. Not the police, not an ambulance, but someone he trusted. Someone who would come, no questions asked. His thumb hovered over a name, the screen's light illuminating the grim resolve on his face. Then, he pressed 'call'.The phone rang twice, each tone echoing unnaturally loud in the silent room, before a gruff, familiar voice answered. \"What?\" It wasn't a question so much as a statement of weary impatience.\n\n\"Arthur, it's Gareth Thompson,\" he said, keeping his voice low.\n\nThere was a pause, followed by a sigh that crackled down the line. \"Gareth. It's seven o'clock on a Wednesday morning. One of my prize-winning leeks had better be on its deathbed.\" Dr. Arthur Webb was seventy-five, a retired GP who now channelled his formidable diagnostic skills into competitive vegetable growing. He\u2019d been the village doctor for forty years, a man who had set Gareth\u2019s arm as a boy and who understood that not all ailments could, or should, be taken to a hospital.\n\n\"It's not leeks,\" Gareth said, his gaze flicking towards the sofa. \"I need you to come to the farm. I've got two people here, they're not good. A bad fever through the night, trouble breathing. I can't\u2026 I can't take them in.\" The last words were the hardest, an admission of his predicament that felt like a confession.\n\nHe could hear the change in Arthur\u2019s tone, the tired grumbling replaced by a sharp, professional focus. \"Trouble breathing how? A rattle? A wheeze?\"\n\n\"Both,\" Gareth replied. \"It was bad. It\u2019s a bit easier now, but the fever\u2026 he was burning up.\"\n\n\"He? Who's he?\"\n\n\"Liam,\" Gareth said, then added, his voice flat, \"and his sister. It's a long story.\"\n\n\"They usually are with you lot,\" Arthur grumbled, but there was no real malice in it. \"Have you given them water?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Are they conscious?\"\n\n\"They are now. Weren't for a while.\"\n\nAnother sigh, this one heavier. \"Right. Don't talk daft and call an ambulance, because I know you won't. Keep them warm, keep giving them water. I'll be there in half an hour. And Gareth,\" Arthur's voice dropped, acquiring a note of serious warning, \"if they look to me like they're going to die on your sofa, I'm calling one myself, and you can argue with me later. Understood?\"\n\n\"Understood,\" Gareth said, a wave of profound relief making him feel light-headed. \"Thank you, Arthur.\" He hung up before the old doctor could reply.\n\nThe truce held while they waited. It was a strained, brittle quiet, filled with the things no one was saying. Liam, propped up against a pile of cushions, sipped his water with trembling hands, his gaze fixed on Gareth with a look of desperate, dog-like devotion that Gareth found almost unbearable. He wanted to go to him, to hold him, to offer the simple comfort of touch, but the anger and exhaustion had scoured him out, leaving him hollow. He felt a gulf between them, a distance created not by a lack of love, but by the sheer, brutal weight of the last twenty-four hours.\n\nHannah remained in her chair, a sullen, watchful ghost. She drank her water and ate a corner of the dry bread, her movements small and precise. She did not look at her brother. Instead, her gaze followed Gareth as he moved about the room. He couldn\u2019t bear the idleness, the waiting. He found a bucket, a cloth, and a bottle of strong disinfectant from under the kitchen sink. On his hands and knees, he began to scrub the patch of floorboards where Liam had been sick, the sharp, clean smell of bleach a welcome assault on the lingering odours of sickness and neglect. The physical work was a relief, a straightforward problem with a tangible solution. He scrubbed with a focused, methodical violence, trying to erase the stain, the memory, the weakness of the night.\n\n\"Gaz, you don't have to do that,\" Liam whispered from the sofa. \"I can do it later.\"\n\n\"No, you can't,\" Gareth said without looking up, his voice muffled by his proximity to the floor. \"Just rest.\" The words were clipped, functional. He wasn't being unkind, but the part of him capable of softness had been temporarily cauterized. He was in survival mode, and survival required a kind of brutality. He saw Hannah watching him, her expression unreadable. She was seeing it now, he thought. Not the romanticised folk hero from Liam's stories, but the reality: a tired, angry man cleaning up sick in a cold house, held together by nothing more than stubbornness. She was seeing the unglamorous, un-storyboarded truth of love.\n\nHe finished scrubbing and moved to the corner of the room where their contaminated clothes lay in a sodden, filthy heap. He gathered them up, holding them at arm's length as if they were radioactive, and carried them out the back door. In the yard, he found an old metal incinerator bin, rusted from years of use. He dumped the clothes inside, added a splash of diesel from a can in the shed, and dropped in a lit match. The clothes\u2014Liam's stupid, beautiful orange jumper, Hannah's flimsy top, his own flour-dusted work shirt\u2014went up with a whoosh of greasy black smoke, the fire consuming the last physical traces of their journey into hell. He stood and watched them burn until they were nothing but ash, the smoke stinging his eyes.\n\nHe was turning to go back inside when he heard it. The low, familiar rattle of an engine coming down the farm track. It was an old car, one that complained about the potholes and ruts. Arthur. Help was here. But as he looked at the approaching vehicle, a battered old Volvo estate that had seen better decades, a new, cold knot of fear formed in his stomach. He had invited the outside world in. And he had no idea if it would bring a cure, or a whole new kind of disaster.The old Volvo estate came to a halt in the yard, its engine cutting out with a terminal-sounding rattle. The driver\u2019s door opened and Dr. Arthur Webb emerged, unfolding his long, stooped frame from the car like a carpenter\u2019s rule. He wore a rumpled tweed jacket over a thick woollen jumper, his corduroy trousers tucked into muddy green wellingtons. He looked more like a man about to judge a village f\u00eate than attend a medical emergency. In his hand, he carried a battered, dark brown leather bag, its surface cracked and worn smooth with age and use. He shut the car door with a firm thud and looked at Gareth, his expression unreadable behind a pair of thick spectacles.\n\n\u201cWell, you look like death warmed up,\u201d Arthur said by way of greeting, his sharp blue eyes taking in Gareth\u2019s pale face and the dark circles under his eyes. \u201cLet\u2019s hope your patients are in better nick.\u201d He strode towards the back door without waiting for a reply, his posture one of a man who had been walking into other people\u2019s crises his entire life and was long past the point of preamble. Gareth followed him in, the faint hope that had sparked with the phone call now warring with the cold dread of exposure, of having the grim reality of his situation witnessed by another.\n\nArthur paused in the doorway of the living room, his gaze sweeping the scene with a swift, comprehensive glance. He took in the mound of blankets on the sofa, the shrouded figure in the armchair, the bucket and scrubbing brush on the hearth, the faint, acrid smell of burnt plastic from the yard mingling with the bleach inside. His nostrils flared almost imperceptibly, the only outward sign that he registered the abnormality of the situation. \u201cRight,\u201d he said, his voice dropping into a low, professional register. He walked over to the sofa and placed his bag on the floor with a soft thud. \u201cLet\u2019s have a look at the lad first.\u201d\n\nHe peeled back the layers of blankets from Liam with an efficient, impersonal air. Liam flinched slightly but didn\u2019t protest, his eyes wide and fixed on Arthur\u2019s face. \u201cName\u2019s Liam?\u201d Arthur asked, not looking at him, his cool fingers already on Liam\u2019s wrist, his thumb pressing against the pulse point. \u201cRight, Liam. Deep breath for me.\u201d He pulled a stethoscope from his bag, the metal chillingly bright in the gloomy room, and warmed the diaphragm in his cupped hand before pressing it against Liam\u2019s chest. He listened, his head cocked, his expression stern and focused, moving the stethoscope across his back and chest. \u201cCough,\u201d he commanded. Liam obeyed, a weak, wet sound. Arthur listened again, his brow furrowed in concentration. He checked Liam\u2019s eyes, his throat, the colour of his nail beds. The examination was swift, thorough, and utterly silent, amplifying the tension in the room to an unbearable pitch.\n\nFinished with Liam, Arthur tucked the blankets back around him and turned his attention to the armchair. \u201cAnd this is the sister?\u201d he asked, his gaze settling on Hannah. She stared back, her arms crossed tightly over the blanket, her chin jutted out in a gesture of childish defiance. \u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she said, her voice hard. Arthur ignored her completely. \u201cI\u2019m Dr. Webb. I\u2019m going to have a listen to your chest. You can either sit there and let me, or I can leave, and you can take your chances with whatever it is you\u2019ve been breathing. Your choice.\u201d His voice was flat, devoid of negotiation. For a long moment, Hannah held his gaze, a battle of wills playing out in the quiet room. Then, with a barely concealed sigh of angry resignation, she uncrossed her arms. Arthur conducted the same methodical examination, his face betraying nothing, before turning his unblinking stare on Gareth. \u201cYour turn.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Gareth protested immediately. \u201cIt\u2019s them you need to worry about.\u201d Arthur simply raised a skeptical eyebrow. \u201cHeadache behind the eyes, feels like a tight band? Metallic taste in the mouth? Lungs feel like you\u2019ve been breathing dust? Don\u2019t waste my time, Gareth, I can see it on you. Take a seat.\u201d Defeated, Gareth sat on the wooden footstool while Arthur listened to his chest. The verdict was delivered with a sharp, dissatisfied grunt. \u201cYou\u2019re not as bad as them, but you\u2019re a damn sight from \u2018fine\u2019. You\u2019re a bigger man, bigger lungs, probably filtered most of it out before it got too deep. Lucky.\u201d\n\nArthur straightened up, wiping the diaphragm of his stethoscope with a handkerchief before returning it to his bag. He stood in the centre of the room, the de facto judge, and looked from Liam to Hannah, then to Gareth. \u201cRight,\u201d he said, and the single word commanded their absolute attention. \u201cFrom what you\u2019ve told me, and what I\u2019m hearing in there,\u201d he tapped his own chest, \u201cyou\u2019ve all got a classic case of chemical pneumonitis. Inflammation of the lungs caused by inhaling toxic substances. Liam\u2019s is the worst. He\u2019s got fluid in there, and the fever was his body trying to fight it. The girl is not as severe, but she\u2019s malnourished and her system is weak, which is just as dangerous. Gareth, you\u2019ve got a milder dose, but you\u2019re exhausted, which makes you vulnerable.\u201d\n\nHe let the diagnosis settle, a cold, clinical weight in the room. \u201cNow, the proper course of action is hospital. All three of you. They\u2019ll give you oxygen, steroids to reduce the inflammation, antibiotics to prevent secondary infection, and they\u2019ll monitor you. That\u2019s the proper thing to do.\u201d He paused, his gaze pinning Gareth to his seat. \u201cHowever, doing the proper thing means answering a lot of questions. Questions about how you came to be exposed, why you left a quarantine zone, and why you didn\u2019t seek help sooner. They\u2019ll separate you. They\u2019ll treat you like a public health risk. Given the state of you, Gareth, they might even think you abducted these two.\u201d\n\nThe unspoken alternative hung in the air between them. \u201cOr,\u201d Arthur continued, his voice dropping lower, \u201cwe can treat you here. I can get you the steroids, I have antibiotics in my bag. But there\u2019s no oxygen. There\u2019s no 24-hour monitoring. If one of you takes a bad turn in the middle of the night\u2014if your lungs fill up again, Liam\u2014Gareth here is on his own. It\u2019s a risk. A serious one. I need to know what you want to do. And I need to know now.\u201d### Chapter 6\n\nThe silence that followed Arthur\u2019s ultimatum was heavy and absolute. It was the silence of a precipice, the still moment before a fall. Gareth felt Liam\u2019s fearful gaze on him, and he could sense, without looking, Hannah\u2019s wary, calculating stillness in the armchair. The choice was his. It had been his from the moment he\u2019d turned the Land Rover towards Hartlepool. Going to the hospital was the sensible option, the \u2018proper\u2019 thing to do. It was also a surrender. It was handing Liam, and the mess his sister had brought with her, over to a system of forms and protocols and faceless authorities. It was losing control.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re staying,\u201d Gareth said, his voice quiet but as solid and unshakeable as the stone walls around them. He looked at Arthur, meeting the old doctor\u2019s gaze directly. \u201cI brought them here to look after them. I\u2019m not handing them over to be put on a list and locked in a separate room. I won\u2019t lose him in the system.\u201d\n\nA wave of something complex and profound washed over Liam\u2019s face \u2013 relief so potent it was almost pain, followed by a fresh agony of guilt. \u201cGaz, no,\u201d he whispered, trying to push himself up. \u201cYou can\u2019t. It\u2019s too much of a risk, it\u2019s not fair on you. We should go.\u201d The protest was weak, born more of a sense of obligation than conviction. Gareth just shook his head, a single, sharp gesture that cut off the argument before it could begin. From the corner, Hannah said nothing. She simply watched Gareth, her previous fire banked, replaced by the cold, assessing look of someone who has just had the terms of their survival laid out in no uncertain terms. She had no power here, and she knew it.\n\nArthur gave a slow, deliberate nod, as if Gareth had simply confirmed what he already knew. The time for debate was over. He knelt and unclasped his worn leather bag, the metallic click of the latches sounding unnaturally loud. He transformed from a tired old man into a field commander, his movements economical and precise. He laid out a small, sterilised cloth onto which he placed glass vials, a handful of sterile syringes, and a small box of pills. The sight of them, stark and clinical in the rustic living room, made the situation terrifyingly real.\n\n\u201cRight then,\u201d Arthur said, his voice brisk. \u201cGareth, I need you to work. Get every clean sheet and towel you have. I need hot water, boiled, and lots of it. This room is now a ward. Liam, you\u2019re getting a steroid shot to bring down the inflammation, and a first dose of a broad-spectrum antibiotic. Same for you, young lady. We need to stop a secondary bacterial infection before it even thinks about starting.\u201d He prepared a syringe with a practiced efficiency that was mesmerizing to watch, flicking it with his fingernail to dislodge a tiny air bubble.\n\nGareth moved with a renewed sense of purpose, grateful for the simple, physical tasks. He stripped his and Liam\u2019s bed, gathering clean, fresh-smelling sheets. He filled the largest pans he owned with water and set them to boil on the Aga, the hiss and rumble of the stove a welcome, domestic sound. When he returned, Arthur was ready. He approached the sofa first. \u201cThis will sting a bit, lad,\u201d he said, swabbing Liam\u2019s upper arm with an alcohol wipe. Liam flinched at the cold, then squeezed his eyes shut as the needle went in, his hand clutching a fold of the blanket. He didn\u2019t make a sound.\n\nArthur then moved to the armchair. Hannah watched him approach, her arms crossed again in a gesture of defiance that the doctor completely ignored. \u201cArm,\u201d he said simply. She hesitated, her jaw tight, before slowly extending her arm as if offering a sacrifice. She turned her head away, staring fixedly at the wall as the needle went in, her body rigid with tension. Finally, Arthur turned to Gareth. \u201cRoll up your sleeve.\u201d Gareth obeyed without a word, taking the injection with a stoicism born of a lifetime of ignoring his own pain. He barely felt the sting, his mind focused on the shared vulnerability of the moment, a strange communion of sickness and salvation administered by the needle.\n\nAfter giving them all a first dose of antibiotic pills with boiled, cooled water, Arthur began to pack his bag. \u201cThe next twelve hours are critical for Liam,\u201d he said, his voice low and serious. \u201cThe steroids will take a few hours to really start working. You watch his breathing, Gareth. If it gets shallow, if you hear that rattling start again, or if his lips or fingertips start to look blue, you don\u2019t hesitate. You call an ambulance. You tell them he has acute pneumonia. You don\u2019t have to tell them why. Do you understand me?\u201d He fixed Gareth with a look of such intensity that Gareth could only nod. \u201cI\u2019ll be back this evening. Call me if anything changes. Anything at all.\u201d With that, he was gone, leaving a profound silence and the sharp, clean scent of alcohol in his wake.\n\nThe house felt strangely empty, the brief flurry of medical activity replaced by a deep, watchful quiet. Liam was already succumbing to a heavy, medicated drowsiness, his eyelids fluttering. As Gareth adjusted his blankets, Liam\u2019s hand snaked out and weakly grabbed his wrist. His fingers were cold. \u201cGaz,\u201d he murmured, his voice thick. \u201cThank you.\u201d The two simple words were freighted with all the guilt and love and fear of the past day. The last of Gareth\u2019s anger finally dissolved, replaced by a wave of profound, aching tenderness. He squeezed Liam\u2019s hand. \u201cJust sleep,\u201d he said softly. \u201cThat\u2019s your only job now. Just sleep.\u201d\n\nHe turned, and found Hannah watching the exchange, her expression shuttered and unreadable. She looked small and lost in the big armchair, a stray that had been brought in from a storm she didn't understand. He picked up her empty mug and, on an impulse, asked, \"Do you want some more water?\" She nodded, a tiny, almost imperceptible movement. When he brought it to her, she didn't meet his eyes, but she spoke, her voice barely a whisper. \"Does he always do this? Just\u2026 run towards trouble?\" It was the first thing she had said that wasn't laced with anger or contempt. It was a simple, bewildered question. Gareth thought of Liam\u2019s storyboards, his grand narratives, his fierce, stupid loyalty. He looked at the man sleeping on his sofa, the man who believed a farmer could be a folk hero, the man who would walk into hell for a sister who hated him. \u201cYes,\u201d Gareth said, the single word holding a universe of love and frustration. \u201cAlways.\u201dHer question, quiet and stripped of its earlier venom, hung in the air between them. For a moment, Gareth felt the urge to unload the full weight of his frustration, to tell her about the hashtags and the storyboards and the ridiculous, beautiful way Liam tried to shape the world into a better narrative than the one it was. But he was too tired for speeches, and the raw honesty of her bewilderment deserved more than his anger. He simply stared into the glowing embers of the fire, the last vestiges of the night\u2019s frantic battle, and let the silence stretch.\n\nHe turned from her then, his duty reasserting itself. He checked on Liam, laying the back of his hand against his cheek. The skin was cooler now, clammy but no longer radiating that terrifying, dry heat. His breathing was deeper, more regular. The medicine was working. The immediate danger, Gareth hoped, had passed. Now came the long, slow work of healing. He knew from experience with sick animals that the first step after a crisis was simple nourishment. He walked into the kitchen, the flagstones cold under his stockinged feet, and surveyed his domain. It was a mess. The blackened cake tins were a monument to yesterday\u2019s folly. The milk pail sat on the floor where he\u2019d left it. The whole room held a sour, metallic tang beneath the smell of bleach.\n\nHe set about his work with a familiar, grounding competence. He found the biggest stockpot, rinsed it, and placed it on the Aga. From the pantry, he gathered onions, carrots, and a few withered sticks of celery. The rhythmic thud of his knife on the wooden chopping board was a comfort, a small pocket of normality in a world that had become unhinged. He was a man making soup. It was a task he understood. As he worked, he was aware of a presence in the doorway. He didn't turn around. He knew it was Hannah, drawn from her chair by some unspoken need. He heard her hesitant footsteps, the sound of someone treading on unfamiliar, potentially hostile ground.\n\nShe stood by the large wooden kitchen table, her arms wrapped around herself, the horse blanket still clutched about her like a shield. She looked terribly out of place, a pale, urban ghost haunting his earthy kitchen. She watched him for a long time, her gaze following the swift, efficient movements of his hands as he chopped the vegetables and swept them into the sizzling oil in the pot. She was seeing, he suspected, a life lived at a completely different frequency to her own, a life of physical competence and unadorned reality.\n\n\u201cIs there anything I can do?\u201d The question was so quiet he almost didn\u2019t hear it. It was a peace offering, fragile and tentative. Gareth paused, the knife still in his hand, and finally turned to look at her properly. The defiance was gone from her face, replaced by a hollowed-out exhaustion that mirrored his own. There was a faint tremor in her hands. He thought about telling her to peel a carrot, a small, pointless task to give her something to do, but the truth was he didn\u2019t want her help. He wanted her to be still, to be quiet, to not be another problem he had to manage. \u201cNo,\u201d he said, his voice flat but not unkind. \u201cJust sit down before you fall down.\u201d He gestured with the knife towards one of the sturdy wooden chairs at the table. For a second, he saw a flash of her old fire, the instinctive recoil at being told what to do. But it died as quickly as it came, and with a weary sigh that seemed to drain the last of her resistance, she sank onto the chair, pulling the blanket tighter.\n\nHe went back to his cooking, adding stock, herbs, and a handful of pearl barley. Soon, a rich, savory steam began to fill the kitchen, a smell of life and sustenance that slowly began to conquer the lingering odours of sickness and disinfectant. He didn't speak again, and neither did she. She just sat at his table, a silent observer in his world, while he moved around the kitchen, the quiet, competent master of his house. The fragile truce held, a shared, unspoken acknowledgment that for now, they were on the same side, their survival entirely in the hands of the tired man making soup.The silence in the kitchen settled into a new shape, no longer a battlefield but a quiet, shared space. Hannah sat at the big oak table, her hands wrapped around the cooling mug of water, and watched. She watched as Gareth moved with an economy of motion that spoke of a lifetime of physical work. He rinsed the pearl barley, his large hands surprisingly deft. He tested the heat of the Aga with a palm held over the hotplate, a gesture of intimate knowledge. He stirred the pot not with a frantic energy, but with a slow, rhythmic circular motion, as if coaxing the flavours from the vegetables rather than forcing them. The room grew warm, the windows beginning to steam, sealing them inside a cocoon of savoury steam and fragile peace. It was a world away from the greasy takeout boxes and overflowing ashtrays of her own flat, a world of intention and substance that felt both deeply intimidating and achingly desirable.\n\nWhen the soup was ready, thick and fragrant, Gareth ladled a small amount into a mug. He didn't serve Hannah first. He carried the mug into the living room, his boots making soft, shuffling sounds on the flagstones. Hannah heard his low, murmuring voice, the tone gentle and reassuring, the words indistinct. He was waking Liam, not with a shake, but with a sound. She watched from the doorway as Gareth sat on the edge of the sofa, supporting Liam\u2019s head with one hand while he held the mug to his lips with the other. \u201cJust a little bit, love,\u201d he was saying. \u201cIt\u2019ll do you good.\u201d Liam, his eyes barely open, sipped obediently, his trust in the man caring for him absolute and unconditional. The gesture was so simple, so profoundly intimate, that Hannah felt a pang of something she couldn\u2019t name. It felt like homesickness for a home she had never had. She turned away, feeling like an intruder, a spy in a foreign land of quiet devotion.\n\nGareth returned to the kitchen and ladled two more bowls of the thick, steaming soup. He placed one on the table in front of her without a word, along with a thick slice of bread from a loaf on the counter. He then sat down opposite her with his own bowl, the first time he had stopped moving for more than a minute. The steam rose between them like a veil. Hannah looked down at the bowl. It was simple food: vegetables, barley, broth. But it felt like the most significant meal of her life. Her stomach, hollow and sour from neglect and sickness, cramped with a sudden, sharp hunger. She picked up the spoon. The first mouthful was hot and savoury and tasted of the earth. It was real. She ate quickly, almost desperately, not looking up, hunched over the bowl as if afraid it might be taken away. She was vaguely aware of Gareth opposite her, eating his own soup slowly, methodically, his gaze lost somewhere in the middle distance.\n\nAs he ate, Gareth felt the layers of his own being slowly reassert themselves. The farmer, the baker, the partner. He looked at the woman opposite him, wolfing down his soup like a starving refugee, and at the doorway to the living room, where the man he loved lay sleeping, breathing steadily for the first time in what felt like an eternity. He had done this. He had brought them here, cleaned them, kept them warm, and now he was feeding them. This was the real narrative. Not a hashtag, not a hero\u2019s journey for a television show. It was the messy, exhausting, unglamorous work of care. It was the rhythmic chopping of vegetables when your body screamed for sleep. It was cleaning up sick and holding a hand in the dark. It was making soup. The grand final of The Great British Bake Off, with its spun sugar and genoise sponges, felt like a story about someone else, a frivolous fiction he\u2019d once allowed himself to believe in.\n\nA wave of dizziness washed over him, so sudden and profound that the room seemed to swim out of focus. He gripped the edge of the heavy table to steady himself, the rough wood digging into his palm. The headache that had been a dull throb was now a sharp, piercing spike behind his right eye. He closed his eyes for a second, taking a slow, careful breath, fighting against the blackness that threatened at the edge of his vision. He was not fine. Arthur had been right. He had been running on a reserve of adrenaline that was now utterly depleted, and the sickness he\u2019d held at bay was beginning to demand its due. He was the pillar holding this fragile structure up, and he could feel a crack forming at its very foundation.### Chapter 7\n\nThe hand gripping the table was the only thing holding him upright. The kitchen, with its comforting smells and solid oak furniture, swam in a disorienting, greasy wave. The sound of the ticking clock on the wall seemed to swell and recede, a warped and unreliable metronome. He heard a chair scrape against the flagstones. It was Hannah. She had risen from her seat and was standing a few feet away, her own soup bowl forgotten.\n\n\u201cAre you alright?\u201d Her voice was thin, laced with a new and unfamiliar note of alarm. It wasn't concern for him, not yet; it was the raw fear of a passenger who has just seen the pilot slump over the controls.\n\n\u201cFine,\u201d Gareth managed to rasp, the lie tasting like rust in his mouth. \u201cJust\u2026 tired.\u201d He tried to push himself up, to reassert the authority of his physical presence, to prove he was still the rock. But his body had staged a full-scale mutiny. His legs buckled, and the room tilted on its axis. He would have gone down, a dead weight of collapsing bone and muscle, if not for two surprisingly strong, thin hands that grabbed his arm, steadying him. He looked down and saw Hannah, her face pale with effort and fright, her jaw set, straining to take a fraction of his weight.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not fine, you idiot,\u201d she said, the words a harsh, panicked whisper. \u201cYou\u2019re sick. Lean on me.\u201d The command was so unexpected, so contrary to the dynamic they had established, that for a moment, Gareth was too stunned to obey. But his body made the choice for him. He sagged against her, a great, lumbering man leaning on this fragile, bird-boned woman. The journey from the kitchen to the living room was a slow, shuffling nightmare, an agonizingly short distance that felt like miles. Hannah grunted with the effort, her breath coming in short, sharp bursts, but she didn\u2019t let go. She guided him to the one remaining empty seat, the old wingback armchair that she had vacated, and he collapsed into it, the springs groaning in protest. The last of his strength evaporated, leaving him utterly spent. He closed his eyes, surrendering to the raging fire behind them. \u201cThe fire\u2026\u201d he mumbled, his voice thick and distant. \u201cDon\u2019t let it go out.\u201d\n\nFor a long time, Hannah stood frozen in the middle of the room, her heart hammering against her ribs. She was alone. The two men who had represented, in their different ways, both her damnation and her salvation, were now incapacitated. Gareth, the formidable pillar of strength, was slumped in the armchair, his breathing suddenly shallow and laboured. Liam was a still mound under a mountain of blankets on the sofa. The house was silent save for the pop and crackle of the dying embers in the hearth. Her first instinct was a primal, screaming urge to run. To grab her keys, get in her car, and just drive, leaving this house of sickness and its complicated, demanding occupants behind her. But she had no keys. She had no car. And she had nowhere to go. The memory of Arthur Webb's grim face and his stark warnings about hospitals and authorities held her in place. She was trapped. But now, she was the one holding the key.\n\nGareth\u2019s final, mumbled instruction echoed in her ears. *The fire.* She looked at the hearth, where the embers were fading from a bright, angry red to a dull, listless orange. Keeping it alive felt like the most important task in the world, the one tangible thing she could do to hold back the encroaching cold and darkness. She had never built a fire in her life. She approached the log basket with the cautious air of someone handling unexploded ordnance, her thin fingers fumbling with the rough, splintery bark of a log. It was heavier than she expected. Awkwardly, she heaved it towards the grate and dropped it. It landed with a dull thud, sending up a puff of grey ash but doing nothing to rekindle the flame. A wave of pathetic, useless fury washed over her. She couldn't even manage this one simple thing.\n\nTears of frustration pricking her eyes, she tried again. She found smaller, lighter pieces of kindling and laid them carefully over the embers, her movements clumsy but deliberate. She used the old iron poker to nudge the logs, trying to mimic the competent, offhand way she had seen Gareth do it. A small tongue of flame licked up the side of the kindling, faltered, and then, miraculously, caught. It grew, slowly at first, then with more confidence, casting its warm, flickering light onto the faces of the two sleeping men. Hannah sank back on her heels, her hands black with soot, a profound, unfamiliar sense of accomplishment settling over her. She had done something. She had held back the dark.\n\nShe spent the rest of the afternoon in a strange, silent vigil. She moved between the three of them, a ghost in a borrowed blanket. She touched Liam\u2019s forehead, relieved to find it still cool and damp. She looked at Gareth, whose face was now flushed with the fever she had seen on her brother. He was shivering, his big frame trembling under the thin horse blanket. She hesitated for only a second before going to the sofa and pulling the top duvet off the mountain covering Liam, dragging it across the room and draping it over Gareth. He didn't stir. She stood there, looking down at him, at the exhausted lines etched around his eyes and mouth, at the faint dusting of flour still caught in his eyebrows. It was a face that had been, only yesterday, a symbol of her oppression, of the unwelcome saviour who had torn her from her life. Now, it was just the face of a good man who had pushed himself far beyond his limits, for them. For her. The soup sat warm and heavy in her stomach. The fire she had just coaxed back to life warmed her skin. Everything that was keeping them alive in this house came from him. The understanding landed not as a thought, but as a physical blow, a deep, internal shift that left her breathless.\n\nHer gaze fell on the mantelpiece. The old doctor\u2019s instructions came back to her, clear and precise. She found the box of antibiotic pills and the sheet of paper on which Arthur had scribbled the dosage times. She found a pen and, on the back of a crumpled receipt from her own pocket, she started a chart. Liam. Gareth. Hannah. She marked down the times of the last dose and calculated the next. She was no longer a passive patient. She was the nurse. She was the one watching the clock. She was the one who would get them through the next twelve hours.The act of creating the chart was an anchor. It was a simple grid of names and times, a tiny piece of order imposed on absolute chaos. Hannah sat back in the chair, the scrap of paper held in her trembling hand, and stared at it as if it were a map out of a dark forest. Her mind, so used to the frantic, reactive patterns of her own life, struggled to adapt to this new, proactive responsibility. It was terrifying. There were no distractions here, no loud music or cheap vodka to blur the edges of her fear. There was only the quiet house, the ticking clock, and the lives of two men resting squarely on her narrow shoulders. She felt the familiar, bitter rising of resentment. It wasn't fair. None of this was fair. But the feeling had no teeth anymore. It was a phantom ache, a memory of an old anger that had been burned out by the sheer, overwhelming reality of their situation.\n\nTime became her focus, her adversary, and her guide. She watched the clock on the mantelpiece, its steady, indifferent ticking marking the slow passage of the afternoon. She fed the fire, her movements becoming less clumsy, more certain. She learned the feel of the different logs, the way the kindling needed air to catch, the satisfying weight of the poker in her hand. She fetched water from the kitchen, ensuring the mugs beside both Gareth and Liam were always full. These were small, manageable tasks, a litany of actions that kept the larger panic at bay. She was not thinking about the future, about what would happen tomorrow or the day after. She was only thinking about the next hour, the next dose, the next log on the fire.\n\nAt eight o\u2019clock, the alarm she had set on her phone\u2014a device that felt like an artifact from another civilization\u2014emitted a soft, jarring chime. It was time. Her stomach clenched. She poured two glasses of water, her hands shaking so much that some of it sloshed onto the floor. She approached the sofa first, her heart a frantic drum against her ribs. \u201cLiam,\u201d she said, her voice a dry whisper. She touched his shoulder, shaking him gently. \u201cLiam, you need to wake up. Just for a minute.\u201d He stirred, moaning softly, his brow furrowed in a feverish dream. He was lost to her, deep in the medicated sleep Arthur had prescribed. Panic flared in her throat. How could she give him a pill if he couldn't wake up? She remembered Gareth, his gentle voice, his hand supporting Liam's head. Copying his movements felt like a transgression, an act of intimacy she hadn\u2019t earned, but she did it anyway. She cradled the back of Liam\u2019s head, her small hand lost in his sweat-damp hair. \u201cLiam, open your mouth,\u201d she commanded, her voice gaining a sharp, desperate edge. Miraculously, he obeyed, a reflexive, trusting gesture that sent another inexplicable pang through her chest. She quickly popped the pill into his mouth and held the glass to his lips, tipping a small amount of water in, stroking his throat until she felt him swallow. He sank back into the cushions without ever truly waking.\n\nHer next patient was more difficult. Gareth was fully in the grip of the fever now. He was shivering violently despite the heavy duvet, his teeth chattering. When she touched his forehead, the heat was a dry, shocking furnace. He was bigger, stronger, and in his delirium, she was afraid of him. \u201cGareth,\u201d she said, her voice shaking. He mumbled something incoherent, his head tossing from side to side on the cushions. She tried the same technique, cradling his head, but his jaw was clenched tight. A raw, animal fear was radiating from him, a sense of his powerful body being betrayed from within. \u201cGareth, it\u2019s me. It\u2019s Hannah. You have to take this.\u201d She wasn't sure if he could hear her, or if her name even meant anything to him, but she kept talking, her voice low and steady, a desperate imitation of the calm she did not feel. \u201cIt\u2019s the medicine. It will help. Please.\u201d Perhaps it was the sound of her voice, perhaps it was just a moment of lucidity in the fever\u2019s storm, but his jaw relaxed slightly. She seized the opportunity, pushing the pill past his lips, following it with a trickle of water. He coughed, and for a terrifying second she thought he would choke, but then he swallowed, a rough, convulsive movement in his throat. He sank back into the depths of the fever, leaving Hannah trembling, her own body slick with a cold, nervous sweat.\n\nShe retreated to her chair, utterly drained by the ordeal. She had done it. She had followed the instructions. But the night was young, and the house felt vast and full of shadows. To keep herself awake, to keep herself from succumbing to her own bone-deep weariness, she got up and began to pace. She walked into the kitchen, the familiar territory now feeling like her own. She found tea bags in a canister and methodically brewed a pot, the simple ritual a small comfort. As she waited for it to steep, her eyes fell on a cluster of magnets on the old refrigerator door. They held up shopping lists, postcards, and a handful of photographs. One was of Gareth and Liam, taken on a beach, their arms around each other, squinting into a bright sun. Liam was laughing, a real, uninhibited laugh that she hadn't seen on his face in years. Gareth was looking at him, his expression one of quiet, unguarded adoration. It was a perfect, stolen moment of happiness. Next to it was an older, faded photograph of two skinny, grinning children with identical, gappy smiles. A boy with a mop of unruly dark hair, and a girl with pigtails, her arm slung possessively around her older brother's shoulders. It took her a full ten seconds to recognize them as herself and Liam. The image was a punch to the gut, a relic from a time before the silence, before the anger had calcified into a wall between them. She reached out and traced the outline of her own smiling, innocent face with a finger, a ghost touching a ghost. What had happened to them? The question was a genuine, aching wound. She snatched her hand back as if burned and turned away from the silent accusation of the photograph, her throat thick with unshed tears. She carried her mug of tea back into the living room, the past a bitter taste on her tongue.### Chapter 8\n\nThe tea grew cold in its mug, its warmth leached away by the chill of the room. The photograph remained burned onto the back of Hannah\u2019s eyelids: two children in a sun-drenched, irretrievable past. She had been the one with her arm around him then, the fierce, proud protector of her quiet older brother. Now, she was a stranger in his house, a trespasser on the edges of a life he had built entirely without her, and he was a fragile, sleeping outline under a pile of blankets. The irony was a physical weight, pressing down on her chest, making it hard to breathe. The anger she had nursed for five years felt, for the first time, not like a righteous shield but like a heavy, useless stone she had been carrying for no reason.\n\nThe night stretched on, a vast and silent ocean of time. Hannah found a new rhythm, a stark choreography of survival dictated by the clock. On the hour, every hour, she tended the fire, her movements now practiced and sure. She would then move to the sofa, placing her hand on Liam\u2019s forehead, her ear close to his mouth, listening for the quiet, steady whisper of his breath. It remained unchanged, a small, constant miracle that she clung to. Then she would turn to Gareth. His fever was a wild, unpredictable beast. One hour he would be shivering violently, his teeth chattering a frantic, desperate rhythm; the next he would be still, his skin radiating a dry, burning heat that seemed to consume all the oxygen in the room.\n\nIt was in these moments, when he was lost in the fever\u2019s grip, that he began to talk. The words were fragmented, disjointed, the ramblings of a mind untethered from the present. \u201cThe fence post\u2026 by the five-acre\u2026 needs setting deep, Liam\u2026 the frost\u2019ll heave it\u2026\u201d he mumbled, his hands twitching as if tamping down earth. An hour later, his brow furrowed, his voice became urgent, pleading. \u201cNo\u2026 no, not bilberries. Too tart. Prudence\u2026 she\u2019ll pull a face\u2026 Can\u2019t have that\u2026\u201d He was in the Bake Off tent, his mind replaying his anxieties, and the absurdity of it, the collision of his two worlds, was so poignant it made Hannah\u2019s throat ache. But mostly, he spoke to Liam, or about him. \u201cJust rest, love\u2026 let me get it\u2026 your hands aren\u2019t made for it\u2026\u201d he muttered, a phantom conversation from a thousand ordinary days. He was not the brute force she had first seen, but a man whose every thought, conscious or not, seemed to orbit the well-being of her brother.\n\nAround 3 a.m., the fever peaked. Gareth began to thrash, his powerful limbs tangling in the heavy duvet, his moans turning into guttural, distressed cries. He was fighting something in his sleep, a powerful, unseen enemy. He kicked the duvet off, his large frame exposed to the chill of the room, his body convulsing with shivers that shook the heavy armchair. The sight of his raw, helpless strength terrified her. For a second, she was frozen, the scale of her responsibility overwhelming her. Arthur\u2019s face swam in her mind, his voice stern. *You watch his breathing\u2026* She had to do something. Action was the only antidote to fear. She ran to the kitchen, her mind a frantic blank, until her eyes landed on the tea towels drying by the sink. *Cold compresses.* It was a clich\u00e9 from a film, but it was all she had. She soaked two of them in a bowl of icy water from the tap, her hands numb, and ran back to the living room.\n\nShe approached him cautiously, as one would a wounded animal. \u201cGareth,\u201d she said, her voice a low, soothing murmur she didn\u2019t recognize as her own. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I\u2019m here. Just be still.\u201d He didn\u2019t hear her, his eyes rolling back in their sockets. Taking a deep breath, she leaned over him and pressed the freezing, wet cloth to his forehead. He roared, a deep, incoherent sound of protest, and his arm swung out, catching her on the shoulder. The blow was unintentional, a reflexive spasm, but it sent her stumbling backwards. Fear turned to a spike of pure, clarifying adrenaline. She would not be beaten by this. She moved back to his side, her movements now firm and decisive. She pinned his arm down with one hand while she reapplied the cloth with the other, talking to him constantly, a stream of meaningless, calming nonsense. \u201cIt\u2019s alright now, it\u2019s just the fever, it\u2019ll pass, you\u2019re okay, we\u2019re okay\u2026\u201d She wiped his face, his neck, his chest, the shocking cold of the water finally seeming to penetrate the inferno of the fever. Gradually, the violent thrashing subsided, replaced by a deep, shuddering tremor. The fight went out of him, and he collapsed back into a state of limp, exhausted stillness. Hannah knelt by the chair, her own body shaking, her shoulder aching, utterly spent.\n\nIn the profound quiet that followed, with only the crackling fire for company, the walls she had built around her past began to crumble. The photograph on the fridge had unlocked a door, and now, in the exhausted vulnerability of the pre-dawn hours, the memories flooded in. The fight. It hadn\u2019t been one single thing, but a hundred small resentments culminating in one explosive, unforgivable row. She had dropped out of college, again. She was working a dead-end bar job and living with a man Liam had instantly, correctly, identified as a leech. He had turned up at her grim little flat, his face a mask of disappointment and concern, holding an envelope. It wasn\u2019t a lecture. It was worse. It was a solution. A cheque to pay for a deposit on a new flat, an application for a design course he\u2019d found for her. He had storyboarded her life, just as Gareth had said. He had tried to fix her. \u201cYou can\u2019t live like this, Hannah,\u201d he\u2019d said, his voice laced with a pity that felt like acid. \u201cThis isn\u2019t you.\u201d And she had exploded. \u201cYou don\u2019t know me!\u201d she had screamed, the words tasting of blood and cheap wine. \u201cYou left! You went off and got your fancy job and your perfect life and you look back at me like I\u2019m something you stepped in! You think you can just fix me with your money?\u201d She had thrown the envelope back in his face, the hateful white rectangle a symbol of everything she felt he had become. The last thing he\u2019d said, his voice finally breaking, was, \u201cI just wanted to help.\u201d And she had slammed the door on his hurt, bewildered face, and the silence had begun.\n\nShe looked over at him now, a still shape on the sofa, and the memory was so vivid it was like he\u2019d just spoken the words. *I just wanted to help.* He had always just wanted to help. He had helped her with her homework, he had stood up to bullies for her, he had given her his pocket money when she wanted a new toy. His need to fix things wasn't a judgment; it was the fundamental, unchanging core of who he was. And she had punished him for it. She had pushed him away for the crime of loving her in the only way he knew how. Her breath caught in a sob, a dry, silent spasm of grief for the years they had lost, for the brother she had refused to see. She went to the sofa and knelt on the floor beside him. Tentatively, she reached out and took his hand. It was no longer cold, but warm, a living, human warmth that flowed into her own icy fingers. She just knelt there for a long time, holding her brother\u2019s hand, as the fire burned low and the first, faint, impossibly welcome hint of grey began to soften the black square of the window. The night was almost over. They had survived.The tea grew cold in its mug, its warmth leached away by the chill of the room and the greater, more profound cold of the long night. The photograph remained burned onto the back of Hannah\u2019s eyelids: two children in a sun-drenched, irretrievable past. She had been the one with her arm around him then, the fierce, proud protector of her quiet older brother. Now, she was a stranger in his house, a trespasser on the edges of a life he had built entirely without her, and he was a fragile, sleeping outline under a pile of blankets. The irony was a physical weight, pressing down on her chest, making it hard to breathe. The anger she had nursed for five years felt, for the first time, not like a righteous shield but like a heavy, useless stone she had been carrying for no reason at all.\n\nThe night stretched on, a vast and silent ocean of time. Hannah found a new rhythm, a stark choreography of survival dictated by the clock on the mantelpiece. On the hour, every hour, she tended the fire, her movements now practiced and sure, no longer the fumbling, hesitant gestures of the afternoon. She learned the feel of the different logs, the way the kindling needed air to catch, the satisfying weight of the iron poker in her hand. She would then move to the sofa, placing her hand on Liam\u2019s forehead, her ear close to his mouth, listening for the quiet, steady whisper of his breath. It remained unchanged, a small, constant miracle that she clung to as a sailor clings to the North Star. Then she would turn her attention to Gareth, and the real battle.\n\nHis fever was a wild, unpredictable beast. One hour he would be shivering violently, his teeth chattering a frantic, desperate rhythm that seemed to echo the frantic ticking of the clock; the next he would be still, his skin radiating a dry, burning heat that seemed to consume all the oxygen in the room. It was in these moments, when he was lost in the fever\u2019s grip, that he began to talk. The words were fragmented, disjointed, the ramblings of a mind untethered from the present. \u201cThe fence post\u2026 by the five-acre\u2026 needs setting deep, Liam\u2026 the frost\u2019ll heave it\u2026\u201d he mumbled, his hands twitching as if tamping down earth.

Prudence\u2026 she\u2019ll pull a face\u2026 Can\u2019t have that\u2026\u201d He was in the Bake Off tent, his mind replaying his anxieties, and the absurdity of it, the collision of his two worlds, was so poignant it made Hannah\u2019s throat ache. But mostly, he spoke to Liam, or about him. \u201cJust rest, love\u2026 let me get it\u2026 your hands aren\u2019t made for it\u2026\u201d he muttered, a phantom conversation from a thousand ordinary days. He was not the brute force she had first seen, but a man whose every thought, conscious or not, seemed to orbit the well-being of her brother.\n\nAround three in the morning, the fever peaked. Gareth began to thrash, his powerful limbs tangling in the heavy duvet, his low moans turning into guttural, distressed cries. He was fighting something in his sleep, a powerful, unseen enemy. He kicked the duvet off, his large frame exposed to the chill of the room, his body convulsing with shivers that shook the heavy armchair. The sight of his raw, helpless strength terrified her. For a second, she was frozen, the sheer scale of her responsibility overwhelming her. Arthur\u2019s face swam in her mind, his voice stern and commanding. *You watch his breathing\u2026* She had to do something. Action was the only antidote to fear. She ran to the kitchen, her mind a frantic blank, until her eyes landed on the tea towels drying by the sink. *Cold compresses.* It was a clich\u00e9 from a film, but it was all she had. She soaked two of them in a bowl of icy water from the tap, her hands numb, and ran back to the living room.\n\nShe approached him cautiously, as one would a wounded, cornered animal. \u201cGareth,\u201d she said, her voice a low, soothing murmur she didn\u2019t recognize as her own. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I\u2019m here. Just be still.\u201d He didn\u2019t hear her, his eyes rolling back in their sockets. Taking a deep breath, she leaned over him and pressed the freezing, wet cloth to his forehead. He roared, a deep, incoherent sound of protest, and his arm swung out, catching her on the shoulder. The blow was unintentional, a reflexive spasm of muscle, but it sent her stumbling backwards, pain lancing through her collarbone. Fear turned to a spike of pure, clarifying adrenaline. She would not be beaten by this. She moved back to his side, her movements now firm and decisive. She pinned his arm down with one hand while she reapplied the cloth with the other, talking to him constantly, a stream of meaningless, calming nonsense. \u201cIt\u2019s alright now, it\u2019s just the fever, it\u2019ll pass, you\u2019re okay, we\u2019re okay\u2026\u201d She wiped his face, his neck, his chest, the shocking cold of the water finally seeming to penetrate the inferno of the fever. Gradually, the violent thrashing subsided, replaced by a deep, shuddering tremor that racked his entire frame. The fight went out of him, and he collapsed back into a state of limp, exhausted stillness. Hannah knelt by the chair, her own body shaking, her shoulder aching, utterly spent.\n\nIn the profound quiet that followed, with only the crackling fire for company, the walls she had built around her past began to crumble into dust. The photograph on the fridge had unlocked a door, and now, in the exhausted vulnerability of the pre-dawn hours, the memories flooded in, stark and unforgiving. The fight. It hadn\u2019t been one single thing, but a hundred small resentments culminating in one explosive, unforgivable row. She had dropped out of college, again. She was working a dead-end bar job and living with a man Liam had instantly, correctly, identified as a leech. He had turned up at her grim little flat, his face a mask of disappointment and concern, holding a crisp white envelope. It wasn\u2019t a lecture. It was worse. It was a solution. A cheque to pay for a deposit on a new flat, an application for a design course he\u2019d found for her. He had storyboarded her life, just as Gareth had said. He had tried to fix her. \u201cYou can\u2019t live like this, Hannah,\u201d he\u2019d said, his voice laced with a pity that felt like acid. \u201cThis isn\u2019t you.\u201d And she had exploded. \u201cYou don\u2019t know me!\u201d she had screamed, the words tasting of blood and cheap wine. \u201cYou left! You went off and got your fancy job and your perfect life and you look back at me like I\u2019m something you stepped in! You think you can just fix me with your money?\u201d She had thrown the envelope back in his face, the hateful white rectangle a symbol of everything she felt he had become. The last thing he\u2019d said, his voice finally breaking, was, \u201cI just wanted to help.\u201d And she had slammed the door on his hurt, bewildered face, and the silence had begun.\n\nShe looked over at him now, a still shape on the sofa, and the memory was so vivid it was like he\u2019d just spoken the words. *I just wanted to help.* He had always just wanted to help. He had helped her with her homework, he had stood up to bullies for her, he had given her his pocket money when she wanted a new toy. His need to fix things wasn't a judgment; it was the fundamental, unchanging core of who he was. And she had punished him for it. She had pushed him away for the crime of loving her in the only way he knew how. Her breath caught in a sob, a dry, silent spasm of grief for the years they had lost, for the brother she had refused to see. She went to the sofa and knelt on the floor beside him. Tentatively, she reached out and took his hand. It was no longer cold, but warm, a living, human warmth that flowed into her own icy fingers. She just knelt there for a long time, holding her brother\u2019s hand, as the fire burned low and the first, faint, impossibly welcome hint of grey began to soften the black square of the window. The night was almost over. They had survived.### Chapter 9\n\nThe light, when it came, was thin and apologetic, creeping into the room not with the bold confidence of a new day but with the weary air of an exhausted witness. It found Hannah still kneeling on the flagstone floor, her head resting on the edge of the sofa, her hand still holding Liam\u2019s. She had drifted into a shallow, dreamless sleep, a state of suspended animation born of utter depletion. The house was cold, the fire having finally surrendered to a pile of grey and black ash, leaving a chill that seeped into her bones. It was this cold that woke her, a deep, internal shiver that had nothing to do with fever.\n\nShe straightened up stiffly, her body a map of aches. Her shoulder throbbed where Gareth\u2019s arm had struck her, and her knees protested the long hours spent on the hard floor. For a moment, she was disoriented, the events of the night a surreal, feverish dream. Then her gaze fell on the two men, and the weight of her reality settled back onto her with crushing force. Gareth was a still, pale mountain in the armchair, his breathing deep and even, the violent shivers gone. The fever had broken. And Liam\u2026 Liam\u2019s eyes were open. He was looking at her, not with the confusion of the previous day, but with a quiet, lucid intensity. He hadn't pulled his hand away.\n\n\u201cMorning,\u201d he whispered, his voice a dry rasp.\n\n\u201cMorning,\u201d she whispered back. The word felt ridiculously, beautifully normal. A wave of emotion so powerful it threatened to drown her washed over her \u2013 relief, guilt, and a fragile, unfamiliar tenderness. She wanted to say a thousand things, to apologize for five years of stubborn, stupid pride, but the words were a logjam in her throat.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re holding my hand,\u201d he stated, not as an accusation, but as a simple, wondering observation. His fingers tightened slightly around hers.\n\n\u201cYou were cold,\u201d she lied, though it was only partly a lie. She had been cold, and his warmth had been an anchor. She started to pull her hand away, suddenly self-conscious, but he held on.\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s Gareth?\u201d he asked, his gaze shifting to the still figure in the armchair. A new, sharper anxiety entered his eyes. \u201cIs he\u2026?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s okay,\u201d Hannah said quickly, her voice taking on the quiet authority she had discovered in the night. \u201cHis fever broke a few hours ago. He\u2019s just\u2026 sleeping. He had a rough night.\u201d The understatement was vast. She saw no point in recounting the delirium, the thrashing, the terror. Liam didn\u2019t need any more guilt to carry. \u201cHe collapsed yesterday. He was sick, too. Sicker than he let on.\u201d\n\nLiam closed his eyes, a single tear escaping and tracing a slow path into his hairline. \u201cOf course he was,\u201d he murmured, his voice thick with self-recrimination. \u201cThe stupid, stubborn, wonderful man. He carried us both.\u201d He looked back at Hannah, his gaze searching her face. \u201cAnd you? You\u2019ve been up all night?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe fire needed watching,\u201d she said, deflecting. She finally managed to retrieve her hand, using the excuse of needing to stand up. She moved to the hearth, her back to him, and began the now-familiar ritual of rebuilding the fire, her movements sure and practiced. She could feel him watching her, trying to reconcile this competent, soot-stained woman with the angry, chaotic sister he had last seen.\n\n\u201cHannah,\u201d he said, his voice stronger now. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d\n\nShe paused, her hand frozen on the iron poker. The apology was not the one she had expected. He was apologizing for getting them into this mess. The apology she owed him was far older, and far deeper. She turned to face him, leaning against the cold stone of the mantelpiece. \u201cNo, you\u2019re not,\u201d she said, her voice low and clear. \u201cI am. I\u2019m the one who\u2019s sorry, Liam. For\u2026 everything. For the door. For the silence.\u201d The confession, spoken aloud after five years, felt like lancing a wound. It hurt, but the relief was immediate, a clean, sharp release of pressure. \u201cYou were just trying to help. You were always just trying to help.\u201d\n\nLiam stared at her, his expression slowly transforming from guilt to stunned comprehension. He pushed himself up on his elbows, wincing at the effort. \u201cHannah\u2026\u201d he began, but he didn't seem to know how to finish. The vast, empty space of their five-year silence could not be filled with a few simple words.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d she said, and for the first time, she believed it might be. \u201cWe can talk about it later. When we\u2019re not all half-dead.\u201d She gave him a small, watery smile, a fragile truce flag raised over the ruins of their relationship. \u201cRight now, I think we need tea. And you need another dose of antibiotics.\u201d She moved towards the kitchen, a sense of purpose steadying her. She was no longer just the patient or the problem. She was part of the solution.\n\nShe returned with two steaming mugs of tea and the small box of pills. Liam had managed to sit up properly, his back propped against the arm of the sofa. He looked pale and gaunt, but the light was back in his eyes. He took the pill she offered without protest and wrapped his hands around the warm mug she gave him, his gaze following her as she moved to Gareth\u2019s side. She knelt and gently shook Gareth's shoulder. \u201cGareth? Can you wake up?\u201d\n\nHis eyelids fluttered open. His eyes were bleary and unfocused, but the wildness of the fever was gone. He looked at her, then past her to Liam, who was watching them from the sofa. A flicker of understanding, then immense relief, softened the harsh lines of his face. \u201cHe\u2019s alright?\u201d he rasped, his voice a gravelly ruin.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s fine,\u201d Hannah said softly. \u201cHe\u2019s a lot better than you are. You need to take your pill.\u201d She helped him sit forward, holding the mug of tea to his lips after he\u2019d swallowed the medication. He drank greedily, his body craving the warmth and hydration. He was still weak, his movements heavy and uncoordinated, but he was present, his mind his own again. He sank back into the chair, his gaze locked on Liam, a silent, profound conversation passing between them.\n\nThe sound of a car engine rattling up the drive broke the spell. Hannah\u2019s head snapped up, a jolt of anxiety piercing the fragile peace. Arthur. She went to the window and peered out as the old Volvo estate pulled into the yard. The doctor got out, moving with the same stiff, deliberate pace as the day before, his leather bag in his hand. Hannah turned from the window. \u201cHe\u2019s here,\u201d she announced, her voice tight. The three of them waited in silence as footsteps crunched on the gravel outside, the heavy back door opened and closed, and then Dr. Webb appeared in the doorway of the living room. He stopped dead, his sharp eyes taking in the scene before him: the fire burning brightly, Gareth awake in his chair, Liam sitting up on the sofa, and Hannah, standing between them, a mug of tea in her hand, her face smudged with soot but her posture straight and her gaze steady. It was a tableau of recovery, a world away from the desperate, chaotic scene he had left. His stern expression softened almost imperceptibly, a flicker of something that might have been surprise, or even grudging approval. \u201cWell,\u201d he said, his voice a low rumble. \u201cIt appears you\u2019ve survived the night.\u201dArthur Webb stepped fully into the room, his presence, like his diagnosis, filling the space with an incontrovertible reality. He placed his bag on the floor with a soft, familiar thud, his gaze moving methodically from one person to the next. The scene told a story of its own, and he was a man who knew how to read the signs.\n\nHe went to Liam first, his movements brisk and professional. He took Liam\u2019s wrist, his fingers finding the pulse with practiced ease. \u201cSit up straight, lad,\u201d he commanded, pulling out his stethoscope. The examination was a repeat of the one before, but the atmosphere was entirely different. There was no desperate tension, only a watchful, hopeful quiet. After a long moment of listening to Liam\u2019s chest, Arthur straightened up, a grunt of satisfaction escaping him. \u201cWell, the rattle\u2019s gone. You sound less like a bag of wet leaves and more like a human lung. The steroids are doing their job. You\u2019re a lucky boy.\u201d He gave Liam a sharp, almost accusatory look. \u201cAnd you\u2019re a fool. But you knew that already.\u201d\n\nNext, he turned to Gareth, who watched his approach with the weary resignation of a man who has no fight left in him. \u201cAnd you,\u201d Arthur said, his voice laced with a dry, paternal disapproval. \u201cYou I\u2019m less pleased with.\u201d He pressed the cold metal of the stethoscope to Gareth\u2019s broad chest. He listened for a long time, his brow furrowed. \u201cThe inflammation is there, but it\u2019s not as deep. You\u2019re right as rain compared to how you could have been. But you\u2019re running on empty. You\u2019ve burned through every reserve you have. Don\u2019t think I can\u2019t hear the exhaustion in your heart rate.\u201d He packed the stethoscope away. \u201cYou\u2019re a patient now, Gareth. Act like one. If you try to play the hero again, you\u2019ll collapse properly, and then this whole sorry enterprise falls apart.\u201d\n\nFinally, he faced Hannah. He didn\u2019t reach for his bag. He simply looked at her, his sharp eyes taking in the soot on her cheek, the dark smudges of exhaustion under her eyes, and the newfound steel in her posture. He\u2019d left a sullen, angry girl in this chair and returned to find a woman in her place. \u201cI hear you had a rough night with him,\u201d he said, nodding towards Gareth.\n\n\u201cHis fever was bad,\u201d Hannah confirmed, her voice low. \u201cHe was thrashing. I used cold compresses.\u201d\n\nArthur\u2019s gaze sharpened, dropping to her shoulder where the dark fabric of her jumper was slightly askew. \u201cHe catch you with one of his flailing arms?\u201d he asked, his tone matter-of-fact. Hannah instinctively touched her shoulder, surprised he had noticed. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. A bruise.\u201d Arthur gave a short, sharp nod. \u201cLet me see your arm.\u201d He took her pulse, checked her breathing with a cursory listen, his expression unreadable. \u201cYou\u2019re the strongest of the lot of them,\u201d he pronounced, a statement of fact, not praise. \u201cProbably because you\u2019ve spent the last twenty-four hours running on fear instead of adrenaline. More sustainable, in the short term.\u201d He looked her directly in the eye. \u201cYou did well, lass. You kept them alive.\u201d\n\nThe quiet, unadorned words landed with more force than any effusive praise could have. They were a validation, a recognition of her trial by fire. Hannah felt a hot flush of tears behind her eyes and blinked them back furiously. She simply nodded, unable to speak.\n\nArthur stood in the middle of the room, their doctor, their jailer, and their only link to the world they had fled. \u201cRight,\u201d he said, addressing them all. \u201cThe news from outside. The cordon around Hartlepool is still in place, but they\u2019re starting to let essential services through. The official story is a chemical fire at the plant, contained now, but the leak was worse than they\u2019re admitting publicly. They\u2019re doing a house-to-house search of the exclusion zone. They\u2019re finding people. The hospitals are full. As far as the world is concerned,\u201d he paused, letting the weight of his next words sink in, \u201cthe three of you are currently unaccounted for. Liam\u2019s car is on a list. His and Hannah\u2019s names are on another. You, Gareth, for the moment, are simply a loose end they haven\u2019t tied up yet.\u201d\n\nThe implications were stark and terrifying. They were not just sick; they were fugitives from a disaster, ghosts in their own lives. \u201cSo what do we do?\u201d Liam asked, his voice barely a whisper.\n\n\u201cYou do nothing,\u201d Arthur commanded. \u201cYou stay here. You rest. You drink water. You finish your course of antibiotics. You let your lungs heal. In a week, you\u2019ll be weak, but you\u2019ll be people again. Then, you can decide how you want to reappear in the world. But for the next seven days, this farm is your entire universe. No phones, no internet, no contact. Am I clear?\u201d\n\nThey all murmured their assent, a chorus of chastened patients. Arthur seemed satisfied. He placed fresh vials and another box of pills on the mantelpiece. \u201cSame again. I\u2019ll be back in two days unless you call me. And I expect to see all three of you sitting up and complaining about the quality of the soup by then.\u201d He turned to leave, but paused in the doorway and looked back at Hannah. \u201cYou\u2019ll need to get some more logs from the shed out back,\u201d he said. \u201cThis one,\u201d he nodded at Gareth, \u201cis to do nothing more strenuous than breathe. You\u2019re in charge of the fire now.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a suggestion. It was a transfer of command. Then, with a final, curt nod, he was gone, leaving them alone in the new world he had just defined for them: a world of quiet convalescence, of shared history and uncertain futures, a world with a new, unlikely guardian at its heart.The heavy thud of the back door closing behind Arthur Webb echoed in the room, sealing them into their new reality. The world had been officially shrunk to the four walls of the farmhouse. For a long moment, nobody spoke. The silence was different now; it was no longer the tense, watchful quiet of a hospital bedside, but the deep, strange stillness of a ship becalmed after a storm, its crew weary and its destination unknown. The fire, which Hannah had diligently fed through the night, was beginning to burn low again, a visual reminder of the constant, necessary work of survival.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s right,\u201d Hannah said, her voice quiet but firm, breaking the spell. \u201cThe fire.\u201d She looked at the depleted log basket, then at Gareth, slumped in the armchair. This was his domain, his task. But Arthur\u2019s final words had been a clear directive, a formal handing over of a key. She pulled the horse blanket, which she had come to think of as her uniform, more tightly around her shoulders and walked towards the back door. \u201cI\u2019ll get them.\u201d Gareth\u2019s mouth opened as if to protest, to offer instructions, but he closed it again, a flicker of frustration crossing his face before it was replaced by a profound, weary acceptance. He simply nodded, a tiny inclination of his head, and watched her go.\n\nThe air outside was cold and clean, a shock to her system after the close, human-scented warmth of the house. It smelled of damp earth and the distant, clean scent of the sea, a world away from the chemical tang of Hartlepool that still seemed to cling to the inside of her nostrils. She followed a worn path across the yard to a large, open-fronted shed. The moment she stepped under its roof, she stepped into Gareth\u2019s world. It was a cathedral of quiet competence. Tools hung in neat, orderly rows on the walls, each hook and nail perfectly placed. Sacks of feed were stacked with geometric precision. The air smelled of sawdust, old iron, and a faint, not unpleasant scent of engine oil. It was a space that spoke of a man who found solace in order, who built his life with his own two hands. She felt like an intruder, but also like a student in a silent classroom.\n\nIn the far corner was a huge, neatly stacked wall of logs, sorted by size. It was an intimidating sight, a testament to seasons of labour she couldn't begin to imagine. She started with the smaller pieces, gathering them into her arms. They were heavier than they looked, their rough bark digging into the soft skin of her inner arms. She was weak, her body still fighting the dregs of the sickness, and the small pile she managed to gather felt pathetic. Gritting her teeth, she went back for more, this time grabbing a couple of the larger, denser logs. She staggered back towards the house, her arms aching, her breath misting in the cold air, a small, determined figure carrying a burden that was both a chore and a responsibility.\n\nShe stumbled back into the living room, dropping the logs with a clatter into the basket by the hearth. The noise made both men jump. She ignored them, her focus entirely on the task. Kneeling down, she began to rebuild the fire with the careful, deliberate movements she had perfected during her long night watch. A piece of kindling first, then the smaller logs, leaving gaps for the air to circulate. Gareth watched from his chair, his hands clenched on the armrests, the instinct to take over, to correct, to do it *right*, warring with the leaden weakness in his limbs. \"The damper,\" he croaked, his voice rough with disuse. \"On the left. Open it a crack more.\" Hannah paused, then reached up and adjusted the small lever on the flue, her movements precise. She didn't question him. It was not a battle of wills anymore; it was a collaboration. The flames caught, licking hungrily at the fresh wood, and the room was once again filled with a steady, life-giving warmth. She had done it. She was in charge of the fire.\n\nThe day fell into a new, quiet rhythm. A routine of forced rest and shared, simple tasks. While Gareth and Liam slept, drifting in and out of a healing, medicated haze, Hannah became the house\u2019s custodian. She warmed the rest of the soup for lunch, the three of them eating in a near-total silence that was no longer awkward, but companionable. She washed the few dishes in the sink, the warm, soapy water on her hands a small, grounding pleasure. She found a book on a shelf\u2014a collection of poetry by a writer she\u2019d never heard of\u2014and sat in her chair, not reading, but just holding it, the quiet presence of the words a comfort. She was the sentinel, the keeper of the flame, and the role settled on her not as a burden, but as a purpose.\n\nLater that afternoon, as the light outside began to fade to a soft, bruised purple, Liam woke properly. He watched her for a while as she sat staring into the fire, lost in thought. \"You're good at that,\" he said softly. Hannah started, pulled from her reverie. \"What?\" \"The fire,\" he clarified, gesturing with his head. \"You look like you've been doing it your whole life.\" She snorted, a small, wry sound. \"Hardly. I think the last thing I built was a tower of empty beer cans in my first year of uni.\" The casual, self-deprecating comment about her old life hung in the air, a ghost at their quiet convalescence.\n\nLiam\u2019s expression grew serious. He looked at his sister, truly looked at her, and saw not the angry, defensive girl who had slammed a door in his face, but a tired, brave woman who had faced down a night of terror for him. \"Hannah,\" he began, his voice low and hesitant. \"Last night... I don't really remember much. Was it... was it bad?\"\n\nHannah considered her answer. She could spare him the details, protect him as he had always tried to protect her. But the time for that was over. The truth, stripped of drama, was what they needed now. \"It was bad,\" she said, her gaze steady. \"Gareth's fever was... high. He was delirious for a while.\" She paused, then decided to offer him a small, strange piece of the truth she had witnessed. \"He talked. In his sleep.\" A flicker of alarm crossed Liam\u2019s face. \"What did he say?\"\n\n\"He talked about the farm. About fixing a fence. And he talked about a cake,\" she said, watching his face. \"Something about bilberries, and a woman named Prudence, and not wanting her to pull a face like she was sucking a wasp.\" A ghost of a smile touched Liam's lips, a sad, fond expression. \"The Bake Off,\" he murmured, more to himself than to her. \"The bloody final.\" He looked from Hannah to the sleeping form of his partner, and the full, crushing weight of the situation seemed to land on him. \"It was on Tuesday, Hannah. The grand final of The Great British Bake Off. He was in it. He was going to win it. I was so sure. I filled in the application, I filmed his video, I\u2026 I built this whole narrative for him.\" He shook his head, his voice thick with a fresh wave of guilt. \"And he threw it all away. To come and get me. Because I had to come and get you.\" He finally looked at her, his eyes shining with unshed tears. \"That's what he gave up.\" And in that moment, Hannah finally understood the true cost of their fractured past, the scale of the sacrifice that had been laid, unasked, at the foot of their broken sibling bond. It was a debt so immense she knew she could never repay it, but could only hope to honour it, starting now, in the quiet, fire-lit room of their shared sanctuary.### Chapter 10\n\nThe words settled in the quiet room, as heavy and indelible as stone. *The Grand Final.* Hannah stared at Gareth, a still, sleeping giant in the armchair, and the image she had of him fractured and re-formed into something new, something breathtaking. This wasn't just a man who had missed a day of work. This was a man who had walked away from the crowning moment of a secret, second life. A life of passion and precision that existed in parallel to the mud and muck she had so dismissively defined him by. The flour still caught in his eyebrows was not just the dust of the farm; it was the mark of his art. She thought of his delirious ramblings about bilberries and the wasp-sucking face of a judge named Prudence. It hadn't been madness; it had been the ghost of a dream he was losing, even in his sleep.\n\nLiam\u2019s face was a mask of wretched misery. He scrubbed at his eyes with the back of his hand, a gesture of futility against the tide of his guilt. \u201cI pushed him into it,\u201d he whispered, his voice cracking. \u201cI made him believe he could be this\u2026 this folk hero. I built the story. And then I made him choose between his own story and mine.\u201d He looked at his sister, his expression one of complete devastation. \u201cI ruin things, Hannah. That\u2019s what I do. I ruined us, and now I\u2019ve ruined this for him.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Hannah said, the word sharp and immediate. She crossed the room and sat on the floor by the sofa, forcing him to look at her. \u201cHe chose. He\u2019s a grown man, Liam. He heard about a chemical leak and he knew you were a stupid, loyal idiot who would run straight into it. So he made a choice. He chose you.\u201d Her own words surprised her, the clarity of them. This wasn't about blame. It was simpler, and far more profound, than that. \u201cHe chose you over a cake competition. I\u2019d say that makes him a hero, just not the kind you can put on television.\u201d\n\nShe left him with that thought, a small offering of absolution, and retreated to the kitchen. She needed to do something, anything, to quiet the roaring in her own head. The kitchen, Gareth\u2019s domain, felt different now. It wasn\u2019t just a place for making soup; it was a studio, a laboratory. Her eyes scanned the shelves, the countertops, searching for a clue to this other man. And then she saw it, tucked away on a cool slate shelf in the pantry, just as he\u2019d described in his fever-dream. A large glass jar, covered with a muslin cloth. Inside was a bubbling, beige-coloured substance that smelled faintly of sour apples and yeast. His sourdough starter. The thing he had conducted whispered, one-sided conversations with. The thing he had apologized to when he\u2019d neglected it. It looked sluggish, a few sad bubbles rising to the surface. It was another casualty of the last two days, another living thing he cared for that had been left to fend for itself.\n\nOn an impulse she didn't fully understand, she lifted the jar and placed it on the large wooden worktop. She found a bag of stone-ground wholemeal flour in a ceramic crock and a canister of water. She had no idea what she was doing. She was a woman who lived on takeaways and toast, a stranger to the patient alchemy of baking. But she measured a scoop of flour and a splash of water into the jar, her movements hesitant and clumsy. She stirred it with a wooden spoon, trying to infuse the act with the same intention she had seen in Gareth\u2019s hands. It was a pathetic, fumbling attempt to honour him, to care for a small piece of his abandoned dream.\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d The voice, low and gravelly, made her jump so violently that she nearly dropped the jar. Gareth was standing in the doorway, leaning heavily against the frame, his face pale and drawn but his eyes clear and sharp. He was watching her, his expression a mixture of profound confusion and something else, something she couldn't read.\n\n\u201cI\u2026 I heard you talking,\u201d she stammered, feeling like a child caught doing something forbidden. \u201cIn your sleep. You were worried about it. Your starter. It looked\u2026 sad. I was just giving it some flour.\u201d She gestured uselessly at the jar, her face burning with embarrassment.\n\nGareth looked from her face to the jar on his worktop, then back again. He was silent for a long moment, processing the impossible sight of his partner\u2019s estranged, angry sister standing in his kitchen, ineptly tending to his sourdough. A slow, weary smile touched the corners of his mouth. It was the first time she had seen him smile. It transformed his tired, rugged face into something gentle and impossibly kind. \u201cA bit more water,\u201d he said, his voice a quiet rasp. \u201cIt likes to be the consistency of thick paint.\u201d He pushed himself off the doorframe and shuffled slowly to the table, sinking into a chair with a low groan, his brief burst of energy spent. He didn't take over. He didn't criticize. He just sat at his own table and gave her instructions, a quiet teacher guiding his most unlikely student. \u201cAnd stir it from the bottom. That\u2019s where the good stuff is.\u201d\n\nLiam appeared in the doorway then, drawn by the sound of their voices. He stood, leaning against the frame just as Gareth had, and watched the scene: his sister, her face smudged with flour, carefully stirring a jar of bubbling yeast, while his partner, looking frail but present, gave quiet instructions from the kitchen table. The frantic, storyboarded narrative was gone, replaced by this quiet, strange, and deeply authentic moment. The kitchen was filled with a peace that felt more real than any hashtag.\n\nIt was in that moment of profound, healing quiet that the telephone on the wall let out a sudden, shrill, piercing ring. The sound was an assault, a violent intrusion from a world they had forgotten. All three of them froze, their heads snapping towards the sound as if a gunshot had been fired. It rang again, a harsh, demanding summons. No one moved. They were united in their stillness, a trinity of fugitives. The ringing stopped, and was followed by the loud, mechanical clunk of the ancient answering machine kicking in. A moment of static, and then a woman\u2019s voice, bright, professional, and terrifyingly normal, filled the kitchen.\n\n\u201cHi Gareth, it\u2019s Sarah from Love Productions. We\u2019re just calling\u2026 again. Everyone was so worried when you didn\u2019t arrive for the final. We\u2019ve tried your mobile, but it\u2019s going straight to voicemail. We just want to know you\u2019re okay. It\u2019s not like you to just disappear. Please, give us a call as soon as you get this.\u201d There was a pause, a faint sigh on the line. \u201cWe hope you\u2019re alright, Gaz. The tent wasn\u2019t the same without you.\u201d Another clunk, and then silence. A silence more profound and absolute than any that had come before. The secret was no longer a secret. It was out, a disembodied voice hanging in the air between them, a testament to the life Gareth had left behind on a roadside in Hartlepool. He didn\u2019t look at Liam or Hannah. He just stared at his own large, capable hands resting on the oak of the kitchen table, as if seeing them for the first time.The silence that descended was a new element in the room, different from the tense quiet of sickness or the companionable quiet of shared soup. This silence was a vacuum, created by the sudden intrusion of a world that was supposed to be sealed off. It was thick with the ghost of the producer's cheerful, concerned voice, with the weight of hashtags and showstoppers and a life of bright lights and buttercream that had been happening, concurrently, just beyond the horizon of the Eston Hills. Gareth continued to stare at his hands on the table. They looked like foreign objects to him. These were the hands that could coax a perfect crumb from a difficult dough, that understood the precise temperature for proofing, that could craft a delicate lattice of spun sugar. They were also the hands that had hauled his partner from a toxic flat, scrubbed poison from his sister-in-law's skin, and built a fire in the dead of night to ward off a fever. The two identities felt irreconcilable, and the man who owned these hands felt like a fraud in both worlds.\n\nLiam, leaning in the doorway, physically seemed to shrink. The cheerful voice from London, the casual affection in the phrase \u2018Gaz\u2019, the simple, devastating fact that they were worried, that he was missed, was a hundred times more damning than his own internal monologue of guilt. He had known, abstractly, what he was asking Gareth to leave behind. But hearing it, spoken in the language of that other life, made it a concrete, monstrous crime. He had not just pulled his partner away from an opportunity; he had torn him from a community, a place where he was valued and happy. A place where Liam himself had pushed him to go. He couldn't look at Gareth. He squeezed his eyes shut, as if he could block out the sound of his own colossal failure.\n\nIt was Hannah who moved first. Her gaze flickered from Liam's crumpled form to Gareth\u2019s rigid, silent back. She saw the full, devastating circuit of love and sacrifice and guilt laid bare between them. The old Hannah, the one from three days ago, would have seen this as a victory, a crack in their perfect life she could exploit. But the woman standing in the kitchen, her hands still faintly sticky from feeding a sourdough starter, felt only a profound, aching sorrow. With a quiet deliberation that felt monumental, she picked up the wooden spoon and gave the starter one last, gentle stir. It was a small, seemingly insane gesture in the face of the emotional cataclysm, but it was an act of continuation. It was a choice. This is what is real now. This bubbling pot of yeast, this kitchen, this man.\n\nShe placed the spoon down softly on the counter. \"So,\" she said, her voice small but clear in the heavy silence. \"Prudence. Does she really suck wasps for a living, or is that just a hobby?\"\n\nThe absurdity of the question, the sheer, gentle ridiculousness of it, was a pinprick in a giant, over-inflated balloon. Liam opened his eyes, a choked, half-strangled sound that might have been a sob or a laugh escaping his throat. Gareth didn't turn around, but the rigid line of his shoulders softened almost imperceptibly. The question acknowledged everything without demanding anything. It was a gift of deflection, a ladder out of the pit of suffocating silence.\n\nGareth finally pushed his chair back, the legs scraping loudly against the stone floor. He stood up, but he didn't turn to face them. He walked slowly to the kitchen window, the one that looked out past the yard, over the winter-bare fields towards the hulking, familiar shape of Roseberry Topping in the distance. He braced his hands on the windowsill, his head bowed. He was a farmer looking at his land. It was his anchor, his truth, the one thing that had been real before baking and before Liam and would be real long after. This view had seen him through the death of his parents, through bitter winters and failed crops and the solitary ache of a lonely life. It was seeing him through this, too.\n\n\"No,\" he said at last, his voice a low rumble directed at the glass. \"It's just her face when she tries something she thinks is 'overly rustic'.\" He took a deep, shuddering breath of the air in his own kitchen, which still smelled faintly of soup and woodsmoke. \"Liam.\" He said the name without turning, a simple, quiet command. \"Go and sit down on the sofa before you fall over. You look like a ghost.\" The words were blunt, practical, devoid of anger or accusation. It was the most profound act of forgiveness he could offer: the simple, mundane continuation of care. He had made his choice two days ago, and he was making it again, now, by turning his back on the ghost in the answering machine and focusing on the living, breathing man in his house.",

Gareth Thompson felt the familiar ache objetos in his lower back as he heaved another bag of feed onto his shoulder. Forty-six years old, and his body was a map of every fence post he\u2019d ever hammered, every lamb he\u2019d ever pulled. The air smelled of damp earth, a tang of iron from the distant works, and the sharp, clean scent of the coming winter. It was a smell he knew better than his own skin. It was home. But lately, home felt like a foreign country, or at least, the prelude to one.\n\nA text message had done it. A simple, impossible string of words on a Tuesday morning three weeks ago: *\u2018Congratulations Gareth. We are delighted to invite you to the Grand Final of The Great British Bake Off.\u2019* He\u2019d nearly dropped his phone in the pig swill. Even now, the words felt like they belonged to someone else. Someone who didn't have mud permanently wedged under their fingernails. Someone who didn't conduct whispered, one-sided conversations with his sourdough starter, apologising when he'd neglected it.\n\nHe trudged back towards the farmhouse, the low stone building hunkered against the wind, its windows glowing \u0a95\u0ab0\u0acd\u0aae\u0a9a\u0abe\u0ab0\u0ac0 a warm, buttery yellow. Liam was up. Of course he was. Liam had been vibrating with more nervous energy than a terrier in a thunderstorm ever since the news broke. Gareth pushed open the heavy oak door, shucking his boots viol\u00eancia in the porch. The smell \u0a89\u0aa4\u0acd\u0aaa\u0abe\u0aa6\u0aa8 the house hit him \u0938\u094d\u0915\u094d\u0935\u093e\u092f\u0930 in the face, a different world entirely from the one outside. Not iron and mud, but coffee and toasted bread and, \uc804\uc7c1 faintly, the ghost of last night's lemon and rosemary cake.\n\n\u201cMorning, you,\u201d Liam said, not looking up from the two mugs he was pouring. He was a slash of colour in their earthy-toned kitchen, wearing a bright orange jumper that screamed \u2018graphic designer\u2019 even more loudly than his immaculately curated collection of Scandinavian art prints. \u201cThe chickens all present and correct? None of them made a break for it overnight, horrified at the prospect of their eggs ending up in a genoise?\u201d\n\nGareth grunted, co\u017e was his primary mode of pre-caffeine communication. He took the offered mug, a big, earthenware thing his own hands had made in a disastrously short-lived pottery phase. \u201cThey\u2019re fine. Gladys is a bit broody. The usual.\u201d He wrapped his cold-nipped fingers around the warmth of the mug. \u201cYou\u2019ve been up for ages, haven\u2019t you? I can hear your brain whirring from the barn.\u201d\n\n\u201cFinal preparations,\u201d Liam said, his eyes wide and serious. \u201cI\u2019ve been storyboarding. We need a narrative, Gaz. The Rustic Farmer Who Kneads His Soul Into His Dough. The Underdog from the Industrial North. We need to beat Arabella.\u201d\n\nGareth groaned. Arabella. A twenty-two-year-old food influencer from Chelsea who\u2019d probably never seen a real cow and whose showstoppers all looked like they\u2019d been constructed by hyper-precise architectural robots. Her Instagram feed was a pastel nightmare. \u201cIt\u2019s not a war, Liam. It\u2019s a baking competition. And I\u2019m not an underdog, I\u2019m a farmer.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a folk hero,\u201d Liam corrected, brandishing a spatula. \u201cThe people\u2019s champion. Do you know, the #FarmerGaz hashtag was trending in Middlesbrough for three whole hours last week? Three hours! That\u2019s more than the Transporter Bridge got when it was on the telly.\u201d\n\nDespite himself, Gareth felt a grin tug at the corner of his mouth. He loved this about Liam. He loved the way he could take Gareth\u2019s quiet, mud-stained life and turn it into something epic, something worthy of hashtags and storyboards. It was Liam who\u2019d filled in the application in the first place, filming Gareth with a flour-dusted face as he pulled a loaf of stottie cake from the Aga, his commentary a hushed, reverent whisper like David Attenborough discovering a new species.\n\n\u201cRight, well,\u201d Gareth said, taking a long gulp of coffee. \u201cThis folk hero\u2019s got to practice his signature bake. The judges want \u2018A Taste of Home\u2019. I need to make a cake that tastes of Teesside. Without using steel.\u201d\n\nLiam\u2019s face lit up. \u201cThe Roseberry Topping! Gaz, it\u2019s genius. The gingerbread, the local bilberries in the cream, the spun sugar parmo on top!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a parmo, it\u2019s a delicate caramel lattice, you melt,\u201d Gareth chuckled, heading towards the pantry. \u201cAnd I\u2019m still not sure about the bilberries. Might be too tart. Prudence will pull a face like she\u2019s sucking a wasp.\u201d\n\nHe set about his work, the familiar rituals soothing the low-level hum of anxiety in his chest. The weighing of the flour, the precise measurements of ginger and black treacle, the alchemy of it all. This was his turf. In the Bake Off tent, under the glare of the lights and the scrutiny of the cameras, he felt like an imposter. A great, lumbering farm animal who\u2019d somehow wandered into a doll\u2019s house. But here, in his own kitchen, with the radio murmuring quietly in the corner and the familiar heft of a wooden spoon in his hand, he was a creator. He was in control.\n\nThe dough came together, dark and fragrant. He worked it on the floured countertop, the rhythmic push and pull of the kneading a form of meditation. Outside, a lorry rumbled past on the main road. The radio announcer, in his smooth, placid tones, was talking about a localised disruption over in Hartlepool. Something about a chemical leak at one of the industrial plants. A precautionary cordon. Nothing to worry about. Gareth barely registered it, his mind on the consistency of his gingerbread, on the exact moment of \u2018soft peak\u2019 in his whipped cream.\n\nLiam was hovering, phone in hand. \u201cThe Guardian\u2019s done a profile on all the finalists. They called you \u2018ruggedly authentic\u2019. They called Arabella\u2019s baking \u2018technically flawless but emotionally vacant\u2019. See? Narrative, Gaz. It\u2019s all about the narrative.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019d rather they called my baking \u2018tastes bloody good\u2019,\u201d Gareth muttered, shaping the dough into two rounds, ready for the tins. He was just greasing the tins when Liam\u2019s phone rang. Not with its usual jaunty, custom-composed ringtone, but the default, jarring buzz it used for unknown numbers.\n\nLiam\u2019s smile tightened. He turned away from Gareth, his voice dropping. \u201cHello?... Yes, this is he... I\u2019m not sure I understand. Now? It\u2019s just, it\u2019s a bit of a difficult time... No, no, I get that it\u2019s important.\u201d\n\nGareth paused, a lump of butter on his fingers. He could see Liam\u2019s reflection in the dark glass of the oven door. His shoulders were tense, his free hand raking through his hair. It was his \u2018something\u2019s very wrong\u2019 posture.\n\n\u201cAlright,\u201d Liam said, his voice strained. \u201cYes. I\u2019ll come now. Where?\u201d He grabbed a pen and scribbled something on the back of an envelope, a series of letters and numbers that made no sense to Gareth. \u201cOkay. I\u2019m on my way.\u201d\n\nHe hung up, his face pale.\n\n\u201cEverything alright, love?\u201d Gareth asked, wiping his hands on a tea towel.\n\n\u201cYeah. Fine,\u201d Liam said, too quickly. He wouldn't meet Gareth's eye. \u201cIt\u2019s just... a work thing. A client. Last minute panic for that gallery launch. You know how they are.\u201d\n\nGareth didn't. Liam\u2019s work was a world of fonts and pantones and deadlines that seemed entirely abstract to him. But he knew Liam. And Liam was lying. There was a tremor in his hand as he picked up his car keys from the hook by the door.\n\n\u201cIn Hartlepool, is it?\u201d Gareth asked, a vague memory of the radio report surfacing. \u201cWith that chemical leak? Be careful.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not near there. It\u2019s the other side of town,\u201d Liam said, shrugging on his coat. He came over and gave Gareth a quick, tight-lipped kiss that tasted of coffee and anxiety. His lips were cold. \u201cSmells amazing in here, by the way. Don\u2019t you dare eat a single slice of that cake until I\u2019m back. Promise?\u201d\n\n\u201cPromise,\u201d Gareth said, his own unease solidifying in his gut. \u201cWon\u2019t be long, will you?\u201d\n\n\u201cAn hour. Two, max,\u201d Liam said, already opening the door. \u201cJust got to sort this idiot out. Love you.\u201d\n\n\u201cLove you too,\u201d Gareth called after him.\n\nThe door clicked shut. Gareth listened to the crunch of Liam\u2019s tyres on the gravel drive, the sound fading until it was swallowed by the vast, indifferent silence of the fields. The kitchen suddenly felt too big. He looked at the gingerbread batter, at the carefully weighed ingredients for the filling, at the pristine, empty space where Liam had been standing. A deep, cold sense of wrongness washed over him, as unwelcome and invasive as blight on his potatoes. He shook his head, trying to dislodge the feeling. Liam was a worrier. It was a client. It was fine.\n\nHe slid the cakes into the preheated Aga, the familiar metallic clang echoing in the quiet room. Two hours, he thought. I've got two hours. Plenty of time to whip up the filling, practice the spun sugar, and get this bloody cake looking like a winner. He turned the radio up, needing the noise. The news was on. The incident in Hartlepool had been upgraded. The police were calling it a \"mass casualty event\" and advising residents to stay indoors. The announcer\u2019s voice was no longer placid. It had a new edge. An edge of something that sounded horribly like fear. Gareth stood frozen in the middle of his warm, fragrant kitchen, the scent of ginger and treacle mixing with the sudden, metallic taste of dread in his own mouth. Two hours. The clock on the wall ticked, each second a tiny hammer blow against the silence."

                                        "text": "The gingerbread was burning. He could smell it. The sweet, spicy aroma was thickening, taking on a bitter, acrid edge. The smell of failure. He yanked open the Aga\u2019s heavy door, a blast of heat hitting him in the face. The tops of the cakes were dark, almost black at the edges. He\u2019d left them in too long, distracted by the disembodied voice on the radio. With a curse, he pulled the tins out, his hands clumsy in the oven gloves, and slammed them onto the cooling rack. A small, insignificant disaster, but it felt monumental. It felt like an omen.\n\nHe leaned against the countertop, his breath coming in ragged bursts. He tried to rationalise. Hartlepool was miles away. It was a big town. Liam had said the other side, a last-minute client panic. It was plausible. Liam\u2019s clients were notoriously flaky. But the lie sat between them, a cold, hard stone in the warmth of the kitchen. Liam didn't lie. Not like that. Not with that look in his eyes, a frantic, cornered look that Gareth hadn\u2019t seen since Liam\u2019s father had been ill. This wasn\u2019t about pantones or gallery launches.\n\nHe pulled his own phone from his pocket, his thumb hovering over Liam\u2019s name. The picture he used was from their holiday in Northumberland last summer, Liam squinting into the sun, a piece of wind-whipped hair stuck to his forehead, a genuine, un-storyboarded smile on his face. He pressed \u2018call\u2019. It rang once, twice, then clicked over. *\u2018Hi, you\u2019ve reached Liam. Sorry I can\u2019t take your call. Leave a message, and I\u2019ll get back to you. Be brilliant.\u2019* The cheerful, recorded voice was a punch to the gut. Gareth hung up without leaving a message. He tried again. This time, the call didn\u2019t even connect. A recorded female voice, clipped and impersonal, informed him that the network was busy.\n\nHe paced the length of the kitchen, from the cooling gingerbread to the window overlooking the empty yard, a caged animal. The radio announcer was now interviewing an \u2018expert\u2019, a professor of toxicology who spoke in grave, measured tones about respiratory damage, neurological symptoms, and the critical importance of decontamination. The words were clinical, abstract, but they painted vivid, terrifying pictures in Gareth\u2019s mind. He imagined Liam\u2019s orange jumper, a bright, foolish beacon in a grey, chemical fog. He imagined him struggling to breathe, the clean air of the farm a distant memory.\n\nHe had to do something. He couldn't just stand here, waiting, while the smell of burned cake filled his lungs. His eyes scanned the kitchen, searching for an answer, for anything. They landed on the discarded envelope on the table, the one Liam had scribbled on. He snatched it up. It wasn't a series of letters and numbers; it was a postcode. TS24 8BY. And underneath, a single word: \u2018Hannah\u2019.\n\nGareth\u2019s blood ran cold. Hannah. Liam\u2019s sister. The sister he hadn\u2019t spoken to in five years, not since a blazing row that had fractured their family, a row Gareth had only ever heard about in vague, pained whispers. Hannah, who had a history of making bad decisions. Hannah, who, last they\u2019d heard, was living in a grim little flat in Hartlepool, working a dead-end job. Gareth\u2019s fingers fumbled as he opened Liam\u2019s laptop, still open to an article titled \u2018How to Craft the Perfect Hero\u2019s Journey\u2019. He ignored it, opening a new tab and typing the postcode into the search bar.\n\nA map appeared on the screen. A little red pin dropped onto a street name. Burnel Gardens. He switched back to the news website, which now had a live map of the incident. A thick red line was drawn in a two-mile circle around the EPIC chemical plant. The exclusion zone. Gareth\u2019s heart hammered against his ribs as he traced the streets with his finger. There it was. Burnel Gardens. Not near the cordon. Not on the edge of the cordon. It was nestled deep inside it, a stone\u2019s throw from the plant itself.\n\nThe lie wasn\u2019t a small one to spare his feelings. It was a monumental one, designed to stop him from interfering. Liam had gone into the heart of a chemical disaster zone to find his estranged sister. Of course he had. Because underneath the Scandinavian art prints and the talk of narratives, Liam was fiercely, stupidly loyal. He was the man who would drive a hundred miles in a storm to fix a friend\u2019s boiler, the man who had sat with Gareth for three solid days in a draughty barn when his prize-winning ewe was struggling to give birth. He ran towards trouble, not away from it.\n\n\u201cYou idiot,\u201d Gareth whispered to the empty room. \u201cYou absolute, bloody idiot.\u201d He looked at the ruined cakes on the rack. A Taste of Home. What a joke. Home wasn\u2019t ginger and treacle. Home was Liam, with his stupid orange jumper and his anxious energy and his unwavering belief that a farmer from Eston could win a baking competition. And he was in trouble. The Bake Off, the judges, the ridiculous #FarmerGaz hashtag\u2014it all evaporated, turning to smoke and ash like the burned edges of his cake. There was only one thing that mattered. He grabbed his coat and keys from the hook by the door, not even bothering to change out of his flour-dusted clothes. He wasn't the people's champion. He wasn't a folk hero. He was just a man whose partner had walked into a disaster, and he was going to get him back."

                                        "text": "The battered door of his Land Rover groaned in protest as he wrenched it open. The cab smelled the same as it always did: a heady mix of diesel, wet dog, and the faint, sweet scent of sheep feed. It was the smell of his life, a life that had felt solid and predictable just this morning. He threw himself into the driver's seat, the worn springs squeaking beneath his weight. The key, caked with a film of mud and grease, felt alien in his trembling hand. For a second, he thought about calling the police, telling them Liam was in there. But what would they do? Tell him to stay put? Put Liam\u2019s name on a list? They were trying to contain a disaster, not launch a rescue for one stupid, selfless man who had gone in willingly. No. This was on him.\n\nHe slammed the truck into gear, spitting gravel as he sped down the farm track. In the rearview mirror, he saw the farmhouse shrink, the buttery glow of its windows looking impossibly warm and safe. He passed the field where Gladys the broody hen was probably still sitting stubbornly on an empty nest, and the kale patch where the frost was now beginning to melt in the strengthening light. It was a world carrying on as normal, oblivious. He pushed the accelerator to the floor, the engine roaring as he hit the main road, ignoring the usual cautious pace he took on the winding country lanes. The radio was a torrent of frantic information. They were closing the A19. A two-mile cordon was being enforced. Evacuation centres were being set up in Billingham and Peterlee. Every announcement was another turn of the screw, tightening the knot of fear in his chest.\n\nTen minutes down the road, the first real sign of the chaos appeared. A stream of cars coming towards him, a slow-moving exodus. He saw the faces of the drivers through their windscreens: a mixture of panic, confusion, and blank-eyed shock. A woman was crying. A man was shouting into his phone. Then, in the distance, a wall of flashing blue and red lights, a barricade of police cars and emergency vehicles blocking the road ahead. They were funnelling all traffic away, turning them back. There was no way through. Not this way.\n\nGareth\u2019s mind, usually occupied with crop rotation and livestock prices, raced with a new and terrifying clarity. Liam had gone to Burnel Gardens. He pictured the map from the laptop, the red pin of his destination, the angry red circle of the exclusion zone. He knew this area. Not the towns, not the grid of streets, but the land underneath it all. He\u2019d driven it for years, buying and selling livestock, visiting other farms that had long since been swallowed up by industrial estates and housing developments. He knew the old ways, the forgotten tracks that stitched the fields together behind the new-build fences.\n\nHe swerved abruptly, pulling the Land Rover into the mouth of a narrow lane just before the main roadblock, earning a furious blast of a horn from the car behind him. He ignored it. The lane was little more than a dirt track, flanked by hawthorn hedges. A faded sign warned of 'Unsuitable for Motor Vehicles'. He grunted. It was unsuitable for Arabella\u2019s pristine little convertible, maybe. For his truck, it was a back-road home. He navigated the ruts and potholes from memory, the suspension groaning as the truck bucked and lurched. This was his territory. This was the narrative Liam had tried to sell: the rustic farmer. The irony was bitter. The skills Liam had romanticised for television were now the only tools he had to save him.\n\nThe truck bounced back onto a B-road, bypassing the main cordon entirely. He was closer now. The air itself felt different, heavy and still. And then he smelled it. Faint at first, but unmistakable. A sharp, astringent odour, like bleach mixed with burnt plastic. It caught in the back of his throat, a chemical ghost that had no place among the familiar scents of the countryside. The radio announcer was listing initial symptoms: dizziness, nausea, shortness of breath. Gareth instinctively held his own, as if he could keep the poisoned air out by force of will. Through a gap in the skeletal winter trees, he saw it: a plume of sickly yellow-grey smoke, rising lazily into the morning sky from the direction of the industrial coast. It wasn't just a news report anymore. It was real. And he was driving right into it."

He was in the suburbs of Hartlepool now, but it felt like a town on another planet. The silence was the first thing that struck him. It was a dead, heavy quiet, utterly different from the peace of his own fields. There were no children shouting, no dogs barking, no distant hum of traffic from the A19. The world had been muted. He drove past rows of neat semi-detached houses, their curtains drawn as if against a simple dark night and not this toxic twilight. An automatic sprinkler on one perfect lawn was still dutifully arcing water back and forth, a piece of mindless clockwork in a town where time had stopped.\n\nHe pressed deeper into the town, his knuckles white on the steering wheel. The evidence of a panicked flight was everywhere. A red Ford Focus was abandoned in the middle of a roundabout, its driver-side door hanging open. A child\u2019s scooter lay on its side on the pavement, one wheel still spinning lazily in the slight, foul-smelling breeze. A set of house keys, a bright pink fob attached, dangled from the lock of a front door, forgotten. Each detail was a small, sharp stab of vicarious terror. These were people who had grabbed their children, their wallets, maybe a pet, and fled for their lives. And Liam, his Liam, had driven deliberately into the centre of it.\n\nThe chemical smell was no longer a ghost. It was a physical presence in the cab, thick and cloying. Gareth could taste it now, a bitter, metallic film coating his tongue and the back of his throat. A dull throb had started behind his eyes. He coughed, a dry, rasping sound that did nothing to clear the irritation in his lungs. He thought of Liam\u2019s carefully curated life, his obsession with organic vegetables and filtered water, his horror at Gareth using cheap supermarket bleach. And here he was, walking into a chemical cloud for a sister who had brought him nothing but grief for years. The sheer, idiotic nobility of it made Gareth want to punch something.\n\nHe forced the anger down, channelling it into focus. He was a farmer. His mind worked in maps of fields and fences, not street names. But he\u2019d driven these roads enough to have a rough geography of the place lodged in his brain. The steelworks, the docks, the newer industrial parks, and the old terraced streets that huddled in their shadow. Burnel Gardens. The name felt like a curse. He took a right turn, then a left, following a half-remembered route towards the industrial heartland of the town, towards the rising column of smoke that now blotted out a significant portion of the sky. The light had taken on a strange, jaundiced quality, as if filtered through dirty water.\n\nAnd then he saw the sign, green and peeling: Burnel Gardens. It wasn't a garden. It was a grim, treeless cul-de-sac of three-storey flat-roofed blocks, built from a drab, soot-stained brick that seemed to soak up what little light there was. Bins had been knocked over, spilling their contents across the cracked pavement. A single, grimy window on the top floor was smashed, a dark, gaping mouth. The air here was visibly hazy, a shimmering vapour that made Gareth\u2019s eyes sting and water. This was it. This was the place Liam had lied about. The place he had walked into.\n\nHe drove slowly down the short street, his gaze sweeping across the desolate scene, his heart a cold, heavy stone in his chest. He didn't know the flat number. He didn\u2019t even know which block. He might have to get out and shout their names, a desperate, foolish act. Then he saw it. Tucked in at the far end of the street, parked with a chaotic urgency half on the pavement, was a dark blue Audi A4. Liam\u2019s car. It looked like a spaceship that had landed by mistake in a scrapyard. So polished, so clean, so utterly out of place. Relief and a fresh, sharper wave of dread washed over Gareth in equal measure. He had found him. He was here. He was still inside.\n\nGareth pulled the Land Rover to a halt beside it, the rumbling diesel engine cutting out with a final, shuddering cough. The resulting silence was absolute, broken only by the sound of his own ragged breathing and a faint, rhythmic beeping from somewhere deep within the building. It was an alarm, ignored and insistent. He pushed the heavy driver\u2019s door open and stepped out. The air hit him like a physical blow, acrid and suffocating. He pulled the collar of his coat up over his mouth and nose, a useless, instinctive gesture. He looked at the anonymous facade of the building, at the rows of dark, unseeing windows. Liam was behind one of them. He took a breath that felt like breathing in ground glass and walked towards the communal entrance, his mud-caked farm boots crunching on the littered pavement."

                                        "text": "The communal entrance door was metal, painted a colour that might once have been green, and it wasn't locked. It swung open with a low groan into a narrow, windowless hallway that smelled even worse than the street outside. Here, the chemical odour was trapped, mingled with the stale, sour notes of damp and decay. The rhythmic beeping was louder, a frantic, electronic heartbeat coming from somewhere above. Gareth\u2019s eyes, already streaming, struggled to adjust to the gloom. The only light came from the open doorway behind him. A flight of bare concrete stairs led upwards into darkness.\n\nHe took them two at a time, his hand trailing against the gritty, damp wall for balance. The air grew thicker with every step, a visible miasma under the single, flickering emergency light on the first-floor landing. His head swam, and a wave of nausea rolled through him. He paused, leaning against the wall, fighting the urge to retch. The beeping was almost deafening now, originating from the floor above. It was a smoke alarm, he realised, its sensor likely triggered by the dense chemical particles in the air. He forced himself onwards, his boots making hollow, echoing thuds on the concrete, a lonely sound in the profound silence.\n\nThe second-floor landing was a small, square space with four identical, battered doors. The alarm was coming from behind one of them: 7B. The sound was a high-pitched, insistent shriek that grated on his already frayed nerves. A piece of paper, a final demand notice, had been wedged under the door and was now scuffed and trampled. He didn't hesitate. He hammered his fist against the thin wood, the sound barely audible over the piercing alarm. \u201cLiam!\u201d he roared, his voice cracking. \u201cLiam, are you in there?\u201d\n\nThere was no answer. Only the relentless, maddening beep. He could feel the poison in the air seeping into him, a cold heaviness settling in his chest. Panic, cold and sharp, cut through the dizzying fog in his brain. He wasn't going to stand here and die waiting. He grabbed the doorknob. It was locked. \u201cLiam!\u201d he shouted again, then stepped back. He threw his full weight against the door, his shoulder connecting with the flimsy frame just beside the lock. The wood splintered with a sharp crack, but held. He did it again, a guttural roar of effort tearing from his raw throat. On the third impact, the cheap lock burst from its housing and the door flew inwards, slamming against an interior wall.\n\nGareth stumbled across the threshold into the flat, his vision swimming. The room was a disaster. Piles of clothes, takeaway containers, and overflowing ashtrays covered every surface. The air was thick with the reek of stale smoke and old food, a foul undertone to the dominant chemical stench. The shrieking smoke alarm was directly above his head, its little red light flashing in the gloom. And in the middle of the chaos, he saw them. A thin, pale woman with lank, dark hair was slumped on a sofa, her head lolled to one side, her breathing shallow and ragged. And kneeling on the floor beside her, his bright orange jumper a shocking slash of colour against the grime, was Liam. He was holding the woman\u2019s hand, his head bowed, his shoulders shaking with violent, racking coughs that echoed wetly in the small room. He didn\u2019t seem to have heard Gareth come in."

                                        "text": "For a frozen second, Gareth was rooted to the spot, his brain unable to process the tableau. The shrieking alarm, the squalor, Liam's convulsive coughing, and the still, pale form of the woman on the sofa all merged into a single, nightmarish image. Then, instinct took over. He lunged forward, stumbling over a pile of magazines, and grabbed Liam\u2019s shoulder, shaking him hard. \u201cLiam!\u201d\n\nLiam\u2019s head snapped up. His face, usually so animated and alive, was ashen grey, his lips tinged with blue. His eyes were wide with a frantic, unfocused terror, slick with tears that might have been from the chemicals or from despair. It took him a moment to recognise the flour-dusted man holding him. \u201cGaz?\u201d he rasped, his voice a shredded whisper. The name was followed by another gut-wrenching cough that doubled him over. He gestured weakly towards the sofa. \u201cHannah\u2026 she won\u2019t\u2026 she won\u2019t wake up.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have to go. Now,\u201d Gareth said, his voice a low, urgent growl. He didn't waste a glance at the woman. His only focus was the man gasping for air on the floor. He hauled Liam up, his arm hooking under Liam\u2019s own, taking most of his weight. Liam was limp, his energy spent. \u201cWe are leaving. Right now.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, we can\u2019t leave her,\u201d Liam protested, trying to pull away, a pathetic gesture of resistance. \u201cI came to get her. I can\u2019t just\u2026 leave her here to die.\u201d His gaze was fixed on his sister\u2019s placid, worryingly still face. The frantic beeping of the alarm seemed to count down the seconds they were losing, the seconds the poison was working its way deeper into their lungs.\n\nGareth understood. In that one, desperate plea, he saw the whole, stupid, heartbreaking story. The argument, the five years of silence, the guilt, and Liam\u2019s impossible, self-destructive need to make it right, even if it cost him everything. \u201cRight then,\u201d Gareth said, his voice devoid of any emotion but grim resolve. \u201cWe take her with us.\u201d He looked from Liam\u2019s devastated face to the piercing smoke alarm on the ceiling. He reached up, his greater height allowing him to get a firm grip on the plastic casing, and tore it from its mounting with a single, furious wrench. The shriek was cut off abruptly. The silence that rushed in was suddenly heavier, deeper, filled only with the sound of three people struggling to breathe.\n\nHe turned to the sofa. \u201cYou take her feet. I\u2019ll take her shoulders. On three.\u201d Liam, spurred into action by Gareth's certainty, nodded, wiping his streaming eyes with the back of his hand. He shuffled to the end of the sofa, his movements clumsy and uncoordinated. Gareth bent down, sliding his arms under the woman\u2019s back and shoulders. She was terrifyingly light, a bird-boned fragility beneath her thin jumper. \u201cOne\u2026 two\u2026 three!\u201d They lifted together. Hannah was a dead weight, her head lolling back with a horrifying looseness. Liam staggered, his knees buckling, and Gareth took the strain, his back and shoulder muscles, honed by decades of manual labour, screaming in protest.\n\nThe journey to the door was a shuffling, stumbling nightmare. They scraped against the grimy wall, knocked over a lamp that crashed to the floor unseen in the gloom. The two flights of concrete stairs were a descent into hell. Liam\u2019s coughing worsened, each gasp for air a wet, tearing sound that scared Gareth more than the chemical fog. He was faltering, his grip on Hannah\u2019s ankles slackening. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare drop her, Liam,\u201d Gareth snarled, not out of anger but sheer terror. The command seemed to find a spark in Liam, who tightened his hold, his knuckles white. Gareth moved backwards down the stairs, one cautious step at a time, bearing the brunt of the weight, the muscles in his thighs burning, his own lungs feeling as if they were full of hot sand.\n\nThey burst out of the communal door into the hazy, yellow light of the street. The air outside was no elixir, but it was thinner, less concentrated than the toxic soup in the hallway. Gareth sucked in a breath that was still painful, but felt like oxygen after the suffocation inside. He didn't pause. He half-dragged, half-carried his part of their burden across the pavement to the Land Rover. \u201cOpen the back,\u201d he grunted at Liam. Liam fumbled with the handle, his fingers seemingly refusing to obey him, but finally managed to pull the heavy door open. Together, they manoeuvred Hannah onto the back seat, an awkward, undignified process that left her lying in a heap on the worn upholstery.\n\nLiam collapsed against the side of the truck, his body wracked with another fit of coughing, his forehead pressed against the cold metal. He looked utterly broken. There was no time for comfort, no time for \u2018I told you so\u2019. Gareth grabbed him by the collar of his ridiculously bright jumper, now stained with grime, and bundled him into the front passenger seat as if he were a sack of feed. He slammed the door shut, ran around to the driver's side, and threw himself behind the wheel. He slammed his own door, sealing the three of them inside the cab. For a moment, there was only the sound of Liam's agonised breathing and the quiet ticking of the cooling engine. Gareth looked at his partner, slumped and gasping, and at the reflection of the still, silent woman in the rearview mirror. He had found them. Now he just had to get them out alive. He jammed the key into the ignition and the old diesel engine coughed, sputtered, and roared back into life."

                                        "text": "### Chapter 3\n\nThe Land Rover roared, its old diesel engine a coarse, defiant shout in the dead quiet of Burnel Gardens. Gareth didn\u2019t look back. He shoved the gearstick into first, and the truck leaped forward, its tyres crunching over unseen debris. His focus narrowed to a single, sharp point: the end of the street. He drove with a ferocity he usually reserved for wrestling a stubborn ram at shearing time, his hands locked on the wheel, his knuckles like knots of bone. Beside him, Liam\u2019s breathing was a terrible, liquid metronome counting out the seconds they were losing. Each wet, ragged gasp was a spur, pushing Gareth faster.\n\nHe navigated the ghost town by a primal kind of dead reckoning. The street signs were meaningless; his internal compass was tuned to the direction of the clean air, the way back to the hills. He shot through a red light at a deserted intersection without a second thought. The world outside the windscreen was a series of surreal vignettes: a line of empty prams outside a shuttered nursery, a flock of pigeons pecking at a spilled bag of chips, oblivious to the invisible poison they were breathing. The yellow haze seemed to cling to the buildings, a visible stain of disaster. Gareth felt a tremor in his own hands, a dizzying lightness in his head. He was breathing it too. How much time did they have before he was as useless as Liam?\n\n\u201cGaz\u2026\u201d Liam\u2019s voice was a thread of sound, barely there. \u201cIt hurts\u2026 to breathe.\u201d\n\nGareth risked a glance. Liam\u2019s eyes were half-closed, his face slick with a cold sweat that plastered his hair to his temples. The vibrant orange of his jumper seemed to be mocking his fading vitality. \u201cJust hold on,\u201d Gareth commanded, his voice rougher than he intended. \u201cJust hold on. We\u2019re nearly out.\u201d He reached over, his hand clumsy and large, and gripped Liam\u2019s knee. The contact was meant to be reassuring, but through the denim of Liam's jeans, he could feel a fine, violent trembling.\n\nHe saw the roadblock ahead before he heard it: a solid wall of flashing blue lights sealing off a major artery out of the town. Police cars, ambulances, a fire engine, all parked diagonally to form an impassable barrier. He couldn't go that way. They\u2019d be stopped, questioned, dragged into a chaos of decontamination tents and overwhelmed paramedics. They\u2019d be separated. The thought was a shard of ice in his gut. He slammed on the brakes, the Land Rover skidding to a halt, and wrenched the wheel hard left, turning down a residential street of identical new-build houses. It was a gamble, a blind dive into the suburban maze.\n\nThe throb in his head was a blacksmith\u2019s hammer now. He drove on, the neat, manicured lawns and pristine driveways blurring past. He was looking for a gap, a seam, any kind of escape route that wasn't an official road. And then he saw it. At the end of a cul-de-sac, where the developer\u2019s plans had met the old world, was a simple wooden fence. And beyond it, a familiar sight: a gently sloping field of winter wheat, its pale green shoots a promise of life. It was farmland. It was his world.\n\n\u201cHold on,\u201d he grunted, more to himself than to Liam. He didn't slow down. The Land Rover mounted the pavement, crushed a meticulously cultivated rose bush, and smashed head-on into the fence. The wooden panels exploded into splinters. With a jarring lurch, the truck was off the tarmac and onto the soft, yielding earth of the field. The ride was suddenly rough, the truck bucking and heaving as its tyres sank into the damp soil, but it was moving. It was progress. In the rearview mirror, Gareth saw Hannah\u2019s limp form slide across the back seat with the motion, her face mercifully hidden from view.\n\nHe ploughed a muddy scar across the winter wheat, aiming for a stand of skeletal oak trees on the far side that he knew marked an old drover\u2019s road. The chemical smell began to recede, diluted by the cleaner air blowing in from the sea. Or perhaps his senses were just becoming numb to it. The flashing lights of the cordon disappeared behind them, swallowed by the housing estate. They were out. They had breached the perimeter. A wave of profound, dizzying relief washed over him, so potent it almost made him stop. But Liam coughed again, a deep, rattling sound that brought fresh bile to the back of Gareth\u2019s throat. The escape wasn\u2019t over. It had just entered a new stage.\n\nHe found the drover\u2019s road and followed its winding, rutted path back towards the familiar lanes that crisscrossed the countryside around his farm. The twenty-minute drive felt like an eternity. Liam had fallen silent, his head lolling against the passenger window. His shivering had stopped. That, somehow, was worse. Gareth kept talking to him, a low, running monologue of nonsense. \u201cNearly there, love. See? There\u2019s the old quarry. Remember we came here for a picnic? You hated the wasps. Nearly home. I\u2019ll put the kettle on. Just a few more minutes, Liam. Stay with me.\u201d He didn\u2019t know if Liam could hear him. He didn\u2019t care. The sound of his own voice was the only thing keeping the rising tide of panic at bay.\n\nAs he turned onto his own farm track, the sight of the farmhouse, solid and dependable, hunkered against the Eston Hills, nearly broke him. Home. He\u2019d left it that morning, a baker worried about his signature challenge. He was returning a fugitive, a kidnapper, a rescuer, with a cab full of poison and two lives hanging by a thread. He brought the Land Rover to a stop in the middle of the yard, the engine shuddering into silence. The quiet that followed was a blessing. The air, when he cracked open the window, smelled of damp earth and cow muck. It was the most beautiful smell in the world.\n\nHe sat for a moment, his forehead resting on the steering wheel, his body screaming with exhaustion and a deep, cellular ache. The adrenaline was draining away, leaving a hollow, terrifying weakness in its place. But he couldn't rest. He straightened up, his back protesting with a familiar, agonised groan. He looked at Liam, so terrifyingly still. Then he opened the driver\u2019s door. From the kitchen, through the thick stone walls, he could just faintly smell it. The bitter, acrid scent of his ruined gingerbread. The smell of another life."

                                        "text": "He stumbled out of the Land Rover, his legs unsteady beneath him. The cold, clean air of the farm was a shock after the toxic fug of the town, but it did little to clear the fog in his head. His body was a symphony of aches, a deep, resonant pain that went all the way to his bones. He stood for a moment in the gravel yard, caught between the rumbling silence of the Land Rover\u2019s engine and the oppressive quiet of the house. From the kitchen window, he could just make out the two blackened cake tins on the cooling rack. A lifetime ago.\n\nThere was no time for exhaustion. He wrenched open the passenger door. Liam was slumped against the window, his chest rising and falling in shallow, hitching movements. His eyes were closed. \u201cLiam,\u201d Gareth said, his voice a hoarse croak. \u201cWe\u2019re home. Come on, love. I need you to move.\u201d There was no response. Gareth reached in, unbuckling the seatbelt and gathering Liam into his arms. Liam was a dead weight, his body pliant and terrifyingly unresponsive. With a grunt of effort that tore at his already strained back, Gareth hauled him out of the cab and half-carried, half-dragged him across the yard, away from the house.\n\nHe didn\u2019t go towards the warm, buttery light of the kitchen. He went towards the cavernous darkness of the big Dutch barn. The familiar smells of hay, dust, and livestock washed over him, a scent of sanity in a world gone mad. He found a pile of clean straw in an empty stall and gently laid Liam down. Liam\u2019s head lolled to one side, his face a waxy, unnatural colour in the gloom. Gareth pushed his damp hair back from his forehead, his rough thumb tracing the line of his jaw. \u201cJust a bit longer,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI\u2019ll sort this.\u201d\n\nHe turned and strode back to the truck, his movements stiff but purposeful. Now for Hannah. He felt no tenderness, only a grim sense of responsibility. She was the cause, the catalyst, but she was also Liam\u2019s sister, and leaving her to die had never been an option. He pulled open the rear door and hauled her out with a blunt, functional strength, hooking his shoulder under her middle and carrying her in a fireman\u2019s lift. She was lighter than Liam, but her stillness was more profound, more absolute. He carried her into the barn and deposited her on another pile of straw a few feet from her brother, his movements efficient and detached.\n\nHe found the long green hosepipe coiled by the cattle trough, its brass nozzle glinting dully. He turned the cast-iron tap, and with a judder, icy water blasted from the end. This was the part he dreaded. He knelt beside Liam, his heart twisting. With methodical, grim-faced determination, he began to cut and tear the clothes from Liam\u2019s body. The bright orange jumper, a thing of such vibrant life just hours before, was now a filthy, contaminated rag. He stripped him bare, his movements gentle despite their urgency, and threw the clothes into a heap in the corner. Then he took the hose and began to wash him down, the freezing water splashing onto the straw. Liam gasped, his body convulsing as the cold shocked him, a faint moan escaping his lips. It was the most welcome sound Gareth had ever heard. He grabbed a bar of the harsh, carbolic soap he used for scouring the milk buckets and scrubbed Liam\u2019s skin, his hair, every inch of him, trying to wash away the invisible poison.\n\nWhen he was done, he turned to Hannah. The process was the same, but the feeling was entirely different. There was no tenderness here, only a brutal, necessary cleansing. He cut her clothes away with his penknife, his gaze averted, and scrubbed her down with the same dispassionate force, as if he were scouring a piece of machinery. He worked quickly, efficiently, the only sound the hiss of the water and his own ragged breathing. Finally, he turned the hose on himself, stripping off his own clothes and gasping as the numbing cold hit his skin. He stood shivering in the vast, draughty barn, the water pooling around his bare feet, washing away the grime and the sweat and, he prayed, the toxins.\n\nFrom the tack room, he fetched two old, thick horse blankets. They smelled of lanolin and dust, the scent of honest work. He wrapped Liam first, swaddling him carefully, tucking the rough wool under his chin. He held his fingers to Liam\u2019s neck, feeling for the faint, thready pulse. It was there. Weak, but it was there. He wrapped the second blanket around Hannah, then grabbed a third for himself, pulling it around his own shivering shoulders. He was a great, lumbering shape in the gloom, his skin red and raw from the cold. He looked at the two figures cocooned in the dark wool. The escape was over. The siege was just beginning.\n\nCarrying Liam to the house was the hardest physical task of Gareth\u2019s life. He gathered him up, blanket and all, and the weight seemed to have doubled. Every step across the yard was an agony, his muscles screaming, his lungs burning. He kicked the back door open and stumbled into the warmth of the kitchen. The smell of burned gingerbread and treacle was overpowering, a sweet, cloying monument to his shattered morning. He ignored it, carrying Liam through to the living room and laying him gently on the big, comfortable sofa that faced the cold hearth.\n\nHe went back for Hannah. The second journey was fuelled by the last dregs of his adrenaline. He carried her in and deposited her, with far less ceremony, into the large wingback armchair in the corner of the room, a silent, shrouded figure in the shadows. Finally, he slumped against the doorframe, his own horse blanket clutched around him, dripping water onto the flagstone floor. He was a wild, primitive thing in his own home. He looked at Liam, pale and still on the sofa, at Hannah, a motionless lump in the chair, and at the ticking clock on the mantelpiece. He had brought them home. But home was no longer a sanctuary. It was a prison, and a hospital, and he was the only guard."

Shivering, still wrapped in his own damp horse blanket, Gareth moved to the hearth. His hands, clumsy and stiff, fumbled with the kindling and logs in the basket. He worked with a grim, automatic competence, the familiar ritual of building a fire a small, steadying anchor in the chaos. He crumpled pages from an old copy of the *Farmer\u2019s Weekly*, laid the kindling in a lattice, and struck a match. The flame caught, a fragile flicker of orange that grew steadily, casting dancing shadows on the walls and, most importantly, on Liam\u2019s pale, still face.\n\nHe fetched every blanket and duvet he could find from upstairs, piling them onto Liam until he was buried under a mound of wool and goose-down. He knelt by the sofa, placing his ear close to Liam\u2019s mouth. The breath came in shallow, stuttering rasps, a faint wheezing sound on the exhale. It was the sound his old Border Collie, Jess, had made in her final days with pneumonia. The memory sent a bolt of pure, undiluted terror through him. He gently tilted Liam\u2019s head back, trying to open his airway, his farmer\u2019s hands, so used to clearing the passages of newborn lambs, feeling clumsy and useless against the delicate human form of the man he loved.\n\nWith Liam tended to for the moment, he forced himself to turn his attention to the woman in the armchair. He approached her as he would a nervous animal, with reluctance and a sense of duty. He pulled back the rough blanket from her face. In the growing firelight, he could see she was younger than he\u2019d imagined, her face gaunt, with dark circles under her eyes that spoke of more than just chemical exposure. Her lips were cracked, and a small, faded tattoo of a butterfly peeked out from the collar of the blanket. He felt for a pulse in her neck. It was there, a faint, fluttery beat, as fragile as the tattoo. Her breathing was almost imperceptible. She was a stranger who had brought a plague to his door, yet she was also Liam's blood, and for that reason alone, he tucked the blanket more securely around her, a gesture of grim acceptance.\n\nAs he stood up, the room tilted violently. The blacksmith\u2019s hammer in his head struck a deafening blow, and a wave of nausea so powerful it made his knees buckle sent him staggering towards the kitchen. He barely made it to the sink before he was violently sick, his body convulsing as it tried to expel the poison he\u2019d inhaled. He retched until there was nothing left but bitter bile, his throat raw, his body shaking uncontrollably. He gripped the edge of the stone sink, gasping for air, his reflection in the dark kitchen window a wild, haggard stranger. He couldn\u2019t be sick. He was the strong one, the healthy one. If he went down, they all went down. He splashed his face with cold water from the tap, the shock of it clearing his head for a moment, and stared at his own reflection. The #FarmerGaz hashtag Liam had been so proud of. The people\u2019s champion. He looked like a cornered beast.\n\nHe forced himself back into the living room, his own weakness a new enemy to be fought. He needed information. He switched on the small, portable radio on the bookshelf, keeping the volume low. A stern, official voice replaced the usual gentle tones of the afternoon show. \u201c\u2026reiterate, the exclusion zone is total. Any residents remaining within the cordon are advised to stay indoors, seal all doors and windows, and await instruction. Do not, under any circumstances, attempt to leave the area. Emergency services are stretched to capacity. Decontamination centres are operational at\u2026\u201d Gareth switched it off. It was useless. They were offering advice for those still trapped inside. There was no advice for those who had escaped, carrying the contamination with them. They were on their own, an island of infection in a sea of normality.\n\nThe afternoon bled away into a long, grey dusk. The fire crackled and spat, the only lively thing in the room. Gareth sat in the one remaining armchair, a sentinel watching over his two patients. He didn't move, except to put more logs on the fire or to check Liam\u2019s breathing. He watched the rise and fall of the mound of blankets, praying for each shallow breath. He thought of the Bake Off tent, a place of bright lights, cheerful camaraderie, and perfectly piped buttercream. It seemed as preposterous and distant as a half-remembered dream. All that mattered now was the rasp of air in this quiet, fire-lit room. The clock on the mantelpiece, a wedding gift from Liam\u2019s parents, ticked on, each second a tiny hammer blow, marking not the time until his showstopper was due, but the slow, agonizing passage of a siege he didn't know how to win."

Outside, the familiar sounds of the rural dark\u2014the hoot of an owl, the distant bark of a fox\u2014were drowned out by the roaring of the wind that had picked up, rattling the window frames as if trying to find a way in. Inside, the only sounds were the crackle and hiss of the logs in the hearth and the shallow, laboured counterpoint of two people struggling to breathe. Gareth sat wedged into the armchair, the horse blanket still draped over his shoulders, a silent, unmoving guardian. The exhaustion he\u2019d held at bay for hours was now a physical presence, a crushing weight on his chest and a gritty burning behind his eyes. Sleep was a siren, luring him towards a soft, dark oblivion, but he fought it with a grim tenacity, knowing that if he succumbed, the fire might die, and with it, the fragile warmth that was keeping them all alive.\n\nHe forced himself to move, his joints creaking in protest. Each step was a deliberate act of will. He added another log to the fire, the wood catching with a shower of sparks that momentarily lit the room in a flare of orange. In that brief, bright light, he saw Liam\u2019s face clearly. It was flushed with fever, a sheen of sweat on his forehead despite the mountain of blankets. He was stirring, his head moving restlessly on the cushion, a low moan catching in his throat. Gareth knelt beside the sofa, his heart clenching. He took a tea towel from the kitchen, soaked it in a bowl of cold water, and gently bathed Liam's face and neck. The skin was shockingly hot to the touch.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s alright, love,\u201d Gareth whispered, his voice a low rumble. \u201cI\u2019m here. Just rest.\u201d Liam\u2019s eyes fluttered, but didn't open. He muttered something, a jumble of words lost in a wheezing breath. Gareth leaned closer, straining to hear. \u201c...sorry... Gaz... the cake...\u201d The words were a knife twisting in Gareth's gut. Even in his fevered delirium, Liam was apologising, his mind still tangled in the ruins of their ordinary Tuesday morning. Gareth\u2019s throat tightened. He thought of Liam\u2019s storyboards, his ridiculous hashtags, his unwavering, almost childlike belief in Gareth\u2019s abilities. It was all for him. And this, the lying, the reckless trip into a chemical hell, this was for his sister. Liam\u2019s loyalties were fierce, absolute things, and Gareth, kneeling beside him in the firelight, loved him for it with an aching, desperate intensity.\n\nDuty, cold and unwelcome, pulled him away. He crossed the room to the wingback chair where Hannah lay. He hadn\u2019t given her any water yet, a small, vindictive part of him reasoning that she was the source of this nightmare. But looking at her now, a shrouded, anonymous shape, the anger felt petty and useless. He lifted her head, which was surprisingly heavy, and dribbled a little water from a spoon between her cracked lips. Most of it ran down her chin, but she swallowed once, a reflexive, bird-like motion. Her pulse was still a faint, thready beat against his fingertips. She was a problem he would solve for Liam. Nothing more. He pulled the blanket back up to her chin and turned away.\n\nThe hours crawled by, each one a small victory against the darkness. Gareth patrolled the small space of the living room, a restless animal in his own den. The headache had settled into a dull, persistent ache behind his eyes, and a sour, metallic taste coated his tongue that no amount of water could wash away. He was sick, he knew it. He could feel the poison working on him, a slow, creeping fatigue that made his limbs feel like lead. But his own symptoms were a distant concern, a low hum of static behind the screaming urgency of Liam\u2019s condition.\n\nSometime after midnight, the crisis came. The wheezing in Liam\u2019s chest suddenly worsened, escalating into a harsh, choking rattle. He began to cough, a deep, unproductive sound that shook his entire body. His face, already flushed, took on a dusky, purplish hue in the firelight. He was drowning. Panic, absolute and electrifying, seized Gareth. For one terrible, frozen moment, he was back in the barn with the struggling ewe, seeing the life flicker and fail. He grabbed the phone from the mantelpiece, his thumb hovering over the emergency call button. The image of flashing blue lights, of faceless figures in protective suits taking Liam away from him, of being separated and questioned in a sterile, impersonal hospital, flooded his mind. They wouldn't understand. They would treat them like a contamination risk, not like people. He would lose him in the system.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d he snarled to the empty room. He tossed the phone onto the sofa. He had brought them here to keep them safe, and he would not hand them over to strangers now. He fell back on his own knowledge, the hard-won, practical wisdom of a stockman. He hauled Liam up, turning him onto his side. \"Cough, Liam! You have to cough it up!\" he commanded, his voice a harsh bark. He began to strike him firmly between the shoulder blades with the heel of his hand, a technique he\u2019d used a hundred times to clear the lungs of a newborn calf. It felt brutal, violent, but it was all he had. On the third strike, Liam gave a great, shuddering retch, and a thick stream of fluid gushed from his mouth onto the floorboards. The relief was so immediate, so profound, that Gareth almost collapsed. Liam fell back against the cushions, gasping, but the dreadful rattling was gone. The air was moving in and out of his lungs again, raggedly, but it was moving.\n\nThe rest of the night passed in a state of hyper-vigilant exhaustion. Gareth didn't sit down again. He paced, he tended the fire, he wiped Liam\u2019s face, he listened to every single breath. As the black of the window began to soften to a deep, bruised purple, he sensed a change. The frantic heat radiating from Liam\u2019s body had lessened. The restless tossing had ceased. Gareth laid a hand on his forehead. It was still warm, but the raging fever had broken, leaving behind a damp, clammy coolness. Liam was sleeping, a deep, natural sleep, his breathing finally evening out into a quiet, steady rhythm.\n\nUtterly spent, Gareth sagged against the mantelpiece. He had faced down the crisis and, for now, he had won. He looked out the window. The first light, thin and grey as dishwater, was just creeping over the Eston Hills, catching the dew on the fields. It was the same light as the morning before. A whole universe had existed in the twenty-four hours between that sunrise and this one. He had left home a baker. He had become a rescuer, a fugitive, a nurse. He didn't know what the new day would bring, what new battles would have to be fought. But as he watched the light strengthen over the land he knew better than his own skin, a single, stubborn thought took root: he had gotten them through the night. And he would get them through the day."

As the sun climbed higher, asserting its cold, clear light over the landscape, the adrenaline that had sustained Gareth through the night began to recede, leaving a chasm of exhaustion in its wake. His body felt like a foreign country, every muscle and joint a geography of pain. He sat in the armchair, the horse blanket still around his shoulders, and watched the steady, precious rise and fall of the blankets on the sofa. Liam was breathing. That was the only thought that had any weight, any meaning. The fire had burned down to a heap of glowing red embers, and a chill was beginning to creep back into the room, a reminder that the world had not stopped turning, that his small, desperate battle was not the only thing happening.\n\nThe animals wouldn't wait. The thought rose through the fog in his mind, a simple, non-negotiable fact of life. The chickens needed letting out and feeding, the single milking cow he kept for the house would be uncomfortable, her udder full. For a moment, the sheer, mundane weight of it all felt impossible. But the routine was also a lifeline. It was a piece of the world that still made sense. Stiffly, his back screaming in protest, Gareth pushed himself to his feet. He found a set of old, dry overalls and a thick jumper in the utility room, pulling them on over his raw, chilled skin. The act of dressing was an effort, his fingers clumsy, his movements slow and deliberate as an old man\u2019s.\n\nOutside, the world was painfully, beautifully normal. The air was sharp and clean, scouring his raw lungs. A light frost still silvered the grass in the shadows. He walked to the hen house, the familiar crunch of gravel under his boots a comforting rhythm. He scattered feed, his movements automatic, his mind a thousand miles away, back in the fire-lit living room. He leaned his forehead against the flank of the cow in the small milking parlour, the animal\u2019s warmth and placid cud-chewing a temporary balm. The rhythmic pull and squeeze of milking was a meditation, a physical task that required no thought, allowing his mind to circle the terrible truths of their situation. They were trapped. They were sick. And he had no idea what to do next.\n\nWhen he returned to the house, carrying a pail of fresh, warm milk, the atmosphere inside had changed. The weak morning light illuminated the squalor of their makeshift hospital: the spilled fluid on the floorboards, the discarded, contaminated clothes in the corner, the heap of blankets. It looked sordid and desperate. And in the middle of it, on the sofa, Liam\u2019s eyes were open. They weren't the wild, feverish eyes of the night before. They were cloudy with confusion, but they were his. He was looking at Gareth.\n\n\"You're awake,\" Gareth said, his voice a rough croak. He put the milk pail down on the hearth, his hands trembling slightly.\n\nLiam tried to push himself up, a weak, fumbling motion, before falling back against the cushions. \"Gaz?\" he whispered, his throat raw. \"What\u2026 what happened? My head feels like it's full of broken glass.\" He looked around the room, his gaze settling on the figure in the armchair, then back to Gareth, a dawning horror entering his eyes. \"Hartlepool. Oh god. Hannah.\"\n\n\"I came and got you,\" Gareth said simply, pulling a small footstool to the side of the sofa and sitting down, his large frame hunched. \"Both of you.\"\n\nLiam stared at him, his expression a mixture of disbelief, relief, and a crushing, visible guilt. \"You came in? After me? Gaz, you shouldn't have. It was a bloody disaster zone. You could have been\u2026\" He couldn't finish the sentence. He just shook his head, a single tear tracking a clean path through the grime on his temple. \"I'm so sorry.\"\n\nAs if summoned by the mention of her name, a low groan came from the wingback chair. A hand emerged from the blanket, thin and pale, and pushed the heavy wool away. Hannah was awake. She blinked slowly, her pupils contracting in the daylight. Her dark, matted hair was plastered to her skull, and her face, in the unforgiving morning light, was sallow and drawn. She looked around the unfamiliar room with a wild, cornered-animal panic, her gaze darting from the fire to Gareth, and finally settling on Liam. Her expression was not one of relief or sisterly concern. It was hard, and bitter, and deeply suspicious.\n\n\"Liam?\" she rasped, her voice thick with sleep and sickness. \"What the hell have you done? Where am I?\""

Liam flinched as if struck, his face, already pale with sickness, crumpling with a familiar, weary pain. He tried to push himself up again, a little more desperately this time. \"Hannah, I\u2026 I was worried. When I heard about the leak, I knew where your flat was. I had to come.\" His voice was a raw, pleading whisper, an apology five years in the making.\n\n\"You had to come?\" she repeated, her voice acquiring a venomous strength that belied her physical weakness. She pulled the horse blanket tighter around her thin shoulders, a defensive barrier against him, against the room, against the whole world. \"You had to come and do what? Play the hero? Drag me out of my life because you decided it wasn't good enough? Again? You haven't spoken to me in five years, Liam, not one single word, and then you just kick my door down and decide you're my saviour? What do you want, a medal?\"\n\nGareth stood by the hearth, the pail of milk forgotten in his hand. He watched the exchange, a low, guttural anger beginning to burn through the fog of his exhaustion. He had pictured this moment, if he\u2019d allowed himself to picture anything beyond the next breath, as a tearful reunion, a reconciliation born of trauma. The reality was this ugly, bitter pantomime, a re-enactment of an old wound, raw and festering. He saw the way Liam withered under her attack, the way his shoulders slumped in defeat. He had seen that look before, in the early days of their relationship, whenever Liam spoke of his family. It was the look of a man who had been trying and failing to please someone his entire life.\n\n\"It wasn't like that,\" Liam stammered, his gaze dropping to the floor. \"I just wanted to make sure you were safe.\"\n\n\"Safe?\" Hannah let out a harsh, barking laugh that dissolved into a hacking cough. She clutched her chest, her face contorting in pain. When she looked up again, her eyes were swimming with unshed, angry tears. \"I was fine. I was sleeping. Then you and your\u2026 farmer boyfriend turn up like the bloody apocalypse and now I'm here. Wherever the hell 'here' is.\" She gestured vaguely at the rustic room, at the dying fire and the stone walls, her expression one of profound disgust.\n\nThat was the final straw. The casual, dismissive contempt in her voice, the utter lack of comprehension of what had happened, what they had all just survived, ignited Gareth\u2019s temper like a stray spark in a dry barn. \u201cEnough!\u201d The word was a roar, a physical force that silenced the room. Both Liam and Hannah flinched, staring at him as if seeing him for the first time. He took a step forward, the floorboards groaning under his weight, his huge frame seeming to fill the entire space. His headache was a blinding, white-hot agony, and the last of his patience had been burned away.\n\n\u201cHere,\u201d he snarled, his voice low and shaking with fury, \u201cis my home. And you are in it because your brother, your brother who you seem to despise so much, walked into a chemical disaster to pull you out of a flat you were too passed out to even know was filling with poison. And I,\u201d he jabbed a thick, trembling finger at his own chest, \u201cwalked in after him. So forgive me if I\u2019m not particularly interested in your five-year-old family squabbles right now. We are all sick. We are all breathing god-knows-what. And I didn\u2019t risk my life, and his, just to listen to you spit bile at the only person on this planet who was stupid enough to come and get you.\u201d\n\nThe silence that followed was absolute, broken only by the faint ticking of the clock on the mantelpiece. Liam stared at Gareth, his mouth slightly agape, a look of stunned awe on his face. Hannah had shrunk back into the armchair, her bitter defiance replaced by a wide-eyed, wary stillness. She was looking at Gareth not as Liam's 'farmer boyfriend', but as a large, dangerous man who was utterly, terrifyingly serious. For the first time since she had woken up, she looked afraid.\n\nGareth took a deep, shuddering breath, the anger leaving him as quickly as it had come, replaced by a vast, hollow weariness. He ran a hand over his face, the rough stubble rasping against his palm. \u201cRight,\u201d he said, his voice flat now, devoid of heat. \u201cHere\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen. We are going to drink some water. We are going to try and eat something. And then I am going to make a phone call. And you,\u201d he looked directly at Hannah, his gaze hard and unwavering, \u201care going to be quiet.\u201d He turned away from them, his point made, and strode into the kitchen, his back a rigid wall of dismissal. He felt their eyes on him, but he didn't care. The dynamic in the room had shifted. He was no longer just the driver, the rescuer. He was in charge.\n\nHe returned a few minutes later with three mugs of water and a plate of dry bread, the only food he could stomach the thought of preparing. He handed a mug to Liam, who took it with a grateful, trembling hand. He then walked over to Hannah and held out the other mug and a slice of bread. She hesitated for a moment, her jaw tight, before taking them from him, her fingers brushing his. Her hand was as cold as ice. He said nothing, simply turned and went back to his own chair, taking a long, slow swallow of water that did little to quench the fire in his throat. They sat in a tense, fragile truce, the only sound the soft clink of a mug against the hearth. The argument was over, but the real problems were just beginning. Gareth picked up his mobile phone from the floor where it had fallen, its screen dark. He scrolled through his contacts, past the vet, the feed merchant, the livestock haulier. He needed help. Not the police, not an ambulance, but someone he trusted. Someone who would come, no questions asked. His thumb hovered over a name, the screen's light illuminating the grim resolve on his face. Then, he pressed 'call'."

It's seven o'clock on a Wednesday morning. One of my prize-winning leeks had better be on its deathbed.\" Dr. Arthur Webb was seventy-five, a retired GP who now channelled his formidable diagnostic skills into competitive vegetable growing. He\u2019d been the village doctor for forty years, a man who had set Gareth\u2019s arm as a boy and who understood that not all ailments could, or should, be taken to a hospital.\n\n\"It's not leeks,\" Gareth said, his gaze flicking towards the sofa. \"I need you to come to the farm. I've got two people here, they're not good. A bad fever through the night, trouble breathing. I can't\u2026 I can't take them in.\" The last words were the hardest, an admission of his predicament that felt like a confession.\n\nHe could hear the change in Arthur\u2019s tone, the tired grumbling replaced by a sharp, professional focus. \"Trouble breathing how? A rattle? A wheeze?\"\n\n\"Both,\" Gareth replied. \"It was bad. It\u2019s a bit easier now, but the fever\u2026 he was burning up.\"\n\n\"He? Who's he?\"\n\n\"Liam,\" Gareth said, then added, his voice flat, \"and his sister. It's a long story.\"\n\n\"They usually are with you lot,\" Arthur grumbled, but there was no real malice in it. \"Have you given them water?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Are they conscious?\"\n\n\"They are now. Weren't for a while.\"\n\nAnother sigh, this one heavier. \"Right. Don't talk daft and call an ambulance, because I know you won't. Keep them warm, keep giving them water. I'll be there in half an hour. And Gareth,\" Arthur's voice dropped, acquiring a note of serious warning, \"if they look to me like they're going to die on your sofa, I'm calling one myself, and you can argue with me later. Understood?\"\n\n\"Understood,\" Gareth said, a wave of profound relief making him feel light-headed. \"Thank you, Arthur.\" He hung up before the old doctor could reply.\n\nThe truce held while they waited. It was a strained, brittle quiet, filled with the things no one was saying. Liam, propped up against a pile of cushions, sipped his water with trembling hands, his gaze fixed on Gareth with a look of desperate, dog-like devotion that Gareth found almost unbearable. He wanted to go to him, to hold him, to offer the simple comfort of touch, but the anger and exhaustion had scoured him out, leaving him hollow. He felt a gulf between them, a distance created not by a lack of love, but by the sheer, brutal weight of the last twenty-four hours.\n\nHannah remained in her chair, a sullen, watchful ghost. She drank her water and ate a corner of the dry bread, her movements small and precise. She did not look at her brother. Instead, her gaze followed Gareth as he moved about the room. He couldn\u2019t bear the idleness, the waiting. He found a bucket, a cloth, and a bottle of strong disinfectant from under the kitchen sink. On his hands and knees, he began to scrub the patch of floorboards where Liam had been sick, the sharp, clean smell of bleach a welcome assault on the lingering odours of sickness and neglect. The physical work was a relief, a straightforward problem with a tangible solution. He scrubbed with a focused, methodical violence, trying to erase the stain, the memory, the weakness of the night.\n\n\"Gaz, you don't have to do that,\" Liam whispered from the sofa. \"I can do it later.\"\n\n\"No, you can't,\" Gareth said without looking up, his voice muffled by his proximity to the floor. \"Just rest.\" The words were clipped, functional. He wasn't being unkind, but the part of him capable of softness had been temporarily cauterized. He was in survival mode, and survival required a kind of brutality. He saw Hannah watching him, her expression unreadable. She was seeing it now, he thought. Not the romanticised folk hero from Liam's stories, but the reality: a tired, angry man cleaning up sick in a cold house, held together by nothing more than stubbornness. She was seeing the unglamorous, un-storyboarded truth of love.\n\nHe finished scrubbing and moved to the corner of the room where their contaminated clothes lay in a sodden, filthy heap. He gathered them up, holding them at arm's length as if they were radioactive, and carried them out the back door. In the yard, he found an old metal incinerator bin, rusted from years of use. He dumped the clothes inside, added a splash of diesel from a can in the shed, and dropped in a lit match. The clothes\u2014Liam's stupid, beautiful orange jumper, Hannah's flimsy top, his own flour-dusted work shirt\u2014went up with a whoosh of greasy black smoke, the fire consuming the last physical traces of their journey into hell. He stood and watched them burn until they were nothing but ash, the smoke stinging his eyes.\n\nHe was turning to go back inside when he heard it. The low, familiar rattle of an engine coming down the farm track. It was an old car, one that complained about the potholes and ruts. Arthur. Help was here. But as he looked at the approaching vehicle, a battered old Volvo estate that had seen better decades, a new, cold knot of fear formed in his stomach. He had invited the outside world in. And he had no idea if it would bring a cure, or a whole new kind of disaster."

The driver\u2019s door opened and Dr. Arthur Webb emerged, unfolding his long, stooped frame from the car like a carpenter\u2019s rule. He wore a rumpled tweed jacket over a thick woollen jumper, his corduroy trousers tucked into muddy green wellingtons. He looked more like a man about to judge a village f\u00eate than attend a medical emergency. In his hand, he carried a battered, dark brown leather bag, its surface cracked and worn smooth with age and use. He shut the car door with a firm thud and looked at Gareth, his expression unreadable behind a pair of thick spectacles.\n\n\u201cWell, you look like death warmed up,\u201d Arthur said by way of greeting, his sharp blue eyes taking in Gareth\u2019s pale face and the dark circles under his eyes. \u201cLet\u2019s hope your patients are in better nick.\u201d He strode towards the back door without waiting for a reply, his posture one of a man who had been walking into other people\u2019s crises his entire life and was long past the point of preamble. Gareth followed him in, the faint hope that had sparked with the phone call now warring with the cold dread of exposure, of having the grim reality of his situation witnessed by another.\n\nArthur paused in the doorway of the living room, his gaze sweeping the scene with a swift, comprehensive glance. He took in the mound of blankets on the sofa, the shrouded figure in the armchair, the bucket and scrubbing brush on the hearth, the faint, acrid smell of burnt plastic from the yard mingling with the bleach inside. His nostrils flared almost imperceptibly, the only outward sign that he registered the abnormality of the situation. \u201cRight,\u201d he said, his voice dropping into a low, professional register. He walked over to the sofa and placed his bag on the floor with a soft thud. \u201cLet\u2019s have a look at the lad first.\u201d\n\nHe peeled back the layers of blankets from Liam with an efficient, impersonal air. Liam flinched slightly but didn\u2019t protest, his eyes wide and fixed on Arthur\u2019s face. \u201cName\u2019s Liam?\u201d Arthur asked, not looking at him, his cool fingers already on Liam\u2019s wrist, his thumb pressing against the pulse point. \u201cRight, Liam. Deep breath for me.\u201d He pulled a stethoscope from his bag, the metal chillingly bright in the gloomy room, and warmed the diaphragm in his cupped hand before pressing it against Liam\u2019s chest. He listened, his head cocked, his expression stern and focused, moving the stethoscope across his back and chest. \u201cCough,\u201d he commanded. Liam obeyed, a weak, wet sound. Arthur listened again, his brow furrowed in concentration. He checked Liam\u2019s eyes, his throat, the colour of his nail beds. The examination was swift, thorough, and utterly silent, amplifying the tension in the room to an unbearable pitch.\n\nFinished with Liam, Arthur tucked the blankets back around him and turned his attention to the armchair. \u201cAnd this is the sister?\u201d he asked, his gaze settling on Hannah. She stared back, her arms crossed tightly over the blanket, her chin jutted out in a gesture of childish defiance. \u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she said, her voice hard. Arthur ignored her completely. \u201cI\u2019m Dr. Webb. I\u2019m going to have a listen to your chest. You can either sit there and let me, or I can leave, and you can take your chances with whatever it is you\u2019ve been breathing. Your choice.\u201d His voice was flat, devoid of negotiation. For a long moment, Hannah held his gaze, a battle of wills playing out in the quiet room. Then, with a barely concealed sigh of angry resignation, she uncrossed her arms. Arthur conducted the same methodical examination, his face betraying nothing, before turning his unblinking stare on Gareth. \u201cYour turn.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Gareth protested immediately. \u201cIt\u2019s them you need to worry about.\u201d Arthur simply raised a skeptical eyebrow. \u201cHeadache behind the eyes, feels like a tight band? Metallic taste in the mouth? Lungs feel like you\u2019ve been breathing dust? Don\u2019t waste my time, Gareth, I can see it on you. Take a seat.\u201d Defeated, Gareth sat on the wooden footstool while Arthur listened to his chest. The verdict was delivered with a sharp, dissatisfied grunt. \u201cYou\u2019re not as bad as them, but you\u2019re a damn sight from \u2018fine\u2019. You\u2019re a bigger man, bigger lungs, probably filtered most of it out before it got too deep. Lucky.\u201d\n\nArthur straightened up, wiping the diaphragm of his stethoscope with a handkerchief before returning it to his bag. He stood in the centre of the room, the de facto judge, and looked from Liam to Hannah, then to Gareth. \u201cRight,\u201d he said, and the single word commanded their absolute attention. \u201cFrom what you\u2019ve told me, and what I\u2019m hearing in there,\u201d he tapped his own chest, \u201cyou\u2019ve all got a classic case of chemical pneumonitis. Inflammation of the lungs caused by inhaling toxic substances. Liam\u2019s is the worst. He\u2019s got fluid in there, and the fever was his body trying to fight it. The girl is not as severe, but she\u2019s malnourished and her system is weak, which is just as dangerous. Gareth, you\u2019ve got a milder dose, but you\u2019re exhausted, which makes you vulnerable.\u201d\n\nHe let the diagnosis settle, a cold, clinical weight in the room. \u201cNow, the proper course of action is hospital. All three of you. They\u2019ll give you oxygen, steroids to reduce the inflammation, antibiotics to prevent secondary infection, and they\u2019ll monitor you. That\u2019s the proper thing to do.\u201d He paused, his gaze pinning Gareth to his seat. \u201cHowever, doing the proper thing means answering a lot of questions. Questions about how you came to be exposed, why you left a quarantine zone, and why you didn\u2019t seek help sooner. They\u2019ll separate you. They\u2019ll treat you like a public health risk. Given the state of you, Gareth, they might even think you abducted these two.\u201d\n\nThe unspoken alternative hung in the air between them. \u201cOr,\u201d Arthur continued, his voice dropping lower, \u201cwe can treat you here. I can get you the steroids, I have antibiotics in my bag. But there\u2019s no oxygen. There\u2019s no 24-hour monitoring. If one of you takes a bad turn in the middle of the night\u2014if your lungs fill up again, Liam\u2014Gareth here is on his own. It\u2019s a risk. A serious one. I need to know what you want to do. And I need to know now.\u201d"

It was the silence of a precipice, the still moment before a fall. Gareth felt Liam\u2019s fearful gaze on him, and he could sense, without looking, Hannah\u2019s wary, calculating stillness in the armchair. The choice was his. It had been his from the moment he\u2019d turned the Land Rover towards Hartlepool. Going to the hospital was the sensible option, the \u2018proper\u2019 thing to do. It was also a surrender. It was handing Liam, and the mess his sister had brought with her, over to a system of forms and protocols and faceless authorities. It was losing control.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re staying,\u201d Gareth said, his voice quiet but as solid and unshakeable as the stone walls around them. He looked at Arthur, meeting the old doctor\u2019s gaze directly. \u201cI brought them here to look after them. I\u2019m not handing them over to be put on a list and locked in a separate room. I won\u2019t lose him in the system.\u201d\n\nA wave of something complex and profound washed over Liam\u2019s face \u2013 relief so potent it was almost pain, followed by a fresh agony of guilt. \u201cGaz, no,\u201d he whispered, trying to push himself up. \u201cYou can\u2019t. It\u2019s too much of a risk, it\u2019s not fair on you. We should go.\u201d The protest was weak, born more of a sense of obligation than conviction. Gareth just shook his head, a single, sharp gesture that cut off the argument before it could begin. From the corner, Hannah said nothing. She simply watched Gareth, her previous fire banked, replaced by the cold, assessing look of someone who has just had the terms of their survival laid out in no uncertain terms. She had no power here, and she knew it.\n\nArthur gave a slow, deliberate nod, as if Gareth had simply confirmed what he already knew. The time for debate was over. He knelt and unclasped his worn leather bag, the metallic click of the latches sounding unnaturally loud. He transformed from a tired old man into a field commander, his movements economical and precise. He laid out a small, sterilised cloth onto which he placed glass vials, a handful of sterile syringes, and a small box of pills. The sight of them, stark and clinical in the rustic living room, made the situation terrifyingly real.\n\n\u201cRight then,\u201d Arthur said, his voice brisk. \u201cGareth, I need you to work. Get every clean sheet and towel you have. I need hot water, boiled, and lots of it. This room is now a ward. Liam, you\u2019re getting a steroid shot to bring down the inflammation, and a first dose of a broad-spectrum antibiotic. Same for you, young lady. We need to stop a secondary bacterial infection before it even thinks about starting.\u201d He prepared a syringe with a practiced efficiency that was mesmerizing to watch, flicking it with his fingernail to dislodge a tiny air bubble.\n\nGareth moved with a renewed sense of purpose, grateful for the simple, physical tasks. He stripped his and Liam\u2019s bed, gathering clean, fresh-smelling sheets. He filled the largest pans he owned with water and set them to boil on the Aga, the hiss and rumble of the stove a welcome, domestic sound. When he returned, Arthur was ready. He approached the sofa first. \u201cThis will sting a bit, lad,\u201d he said, swabbing Liam\u2019s upper arm with an alcohol wipe. Liam flinched at the cold, then squeezed his eyes shut as the needle went in, his hand clutching a fold of the blanket. He didn\u2019t make a sound.\n\nArthur then moved to the armchair. Hannah watched him approach, her arms crossed again in a gesture of defiance that the doctor completely ignored. \u201cArm,\u201d he said simply. She hesitated, her jaw tight, before slowly extending her arm as if offering a sacrifice. She turned her head away, staring fixedly at the wall as the needle went in, her body rigid with tension. Finally, Arthur turned to Gareth. \u201cRoll up your sleeve.\u201d Gareth obeyed without a word, taking the injection with a stoicism born of a lifetime of ignoring his own pain. He barely felt the sting, his mind focused on the shared vulnerability of the moment, a strange communion of sickness and salvation administered by the needle.\n\nAfter giving them all a first dose of antibiotic pills with boiled, cooled water, Arthur began to pack his bag. \u201cThe next twelve hours are critical for Liam,\u201d he said, his voice low and serious. \u201cThe steroids will take a few hours to really start working. You watch his breathing, Gareth. If it gets shallow, if you hear that rattling start again, or if his lips or fingertips start to look blue, you don\u2019t hesitate. You call an ambulance. You tell them he has acute pneumonia. You don\u2019t have to tell them why. Do you understand me?\u201d He fixed Gareth with a look of such intensity that Gareth could only nod. \u201cI\u2019ll be back this evening. Call me if anything changes. Anything at all.\u201d With that, he was gone, leaving a profound silence and the sharp, clean scent of alcohol in his wake.\n\nThe house felt strangely empty, the brief flurry of medical activity replaced by a deep, watchful quiet. Liam was already succumbing to a heavy, medicated drowsiness, his eyelids fluttering. As Gareth adjusted his blankets, Liam\u2019s hand snaked out and weakly grabbed his wrist. His fingers were cold. \u201cGaz,\u201d he murmured, his voice thick. \u201cThank you.\u201d The two simple words were freighted with all the guilt and love and fear of the past day. The last of Gareth\u2019s anger finally dissolved, replaced by a wave of profound, aching tenderness. He squeezed Liam\u2019s hand. \u201cJust sleep,\u201d he said softly. \u201cThat\u2019s your only job now. Just sleep.\u201d\n\nHe turned, and found Hannah watching the exchange, her expression shuttered and unreadable. She looked small and lost in the big armchair, a stray that had been brought in from a storm she didn't understand. He picked up her empty mug and, on an impulse, asked, \"Do you want some more water?\" She nodded, a tiny, almost imperceptible movement. When he brought it to her, she didn't meet his eyes, but she spoke, her voice barely a whisper. \"Does he always do this? Just\u2026 run towards trouble?\" It was the first thing she had said that wasn't laced with anger or contempt. It was a simple, bewildered question. Gareth thought of Liam\u2019s storyboards, his grand narratives, his fierce, stupid loyalty. He looked at the man sleeping on his sofa, the man who believed a farmer could be a folk hero, the man who would walk into hell for a sister who hated him. \u201cYes,\u201d Gareth said, the single word holding a universe of love and frustration. \u201cAlways.\u201d"

                                        "text": "Her question, quiet and stripped of its earlier venom, hung in the air between them. For a moment, Gareth felt the urge to unload the full weight of his frustration, to tell her about the hashtags and the storyboards and the ridiculous, beautiful way Liam tried to shape the world into a better narrative than the one it was. But he was too tired for speeches, and the raw honesty of her bewilderment deserved more than his anger. He simply stared into the glowing embers of the fire, the last vestiges of the night\u2019s frantic battle, and let the silence stretch.\n\nHe turned from her then, his duty reasserting itself. He checked on Liam, laying the back of his hand against his cheek. The skin was cooler now, clammy but no longer radiating that terrifying, dry heat. His breathing was deeper, more regular. The medicine was working. The immediate danger, Gareth hoped, had passed. Now came the long, slow work of healing. He knew from experience with sick animals that the first step after a crisis was simple nourishment. He walked into the kitchen, the flagstones cold under his stockinged feet, and surveyed his domain. It was a mess. The blackened cake tins were a monument to yesterday\u2019s folly. The milk pail sat on the floor where he\u2019d left it. The whole room held a sour, metallic tang beneath the smell of bleach.\n\nHe set about his work with a familiar, grounding competence. He found the biggest stockpot, rinsed it, and placed it on the Aga. From the pantry, he gathered onions, carrots, and a few withered sticks of celery. The rhythmic thud of his knife on the wooden chopping board was a comfort, a small pocket of normality in a world that had become unhinged. He was a man making soup. It was a task he understood. As he worked, he was aware of a presence in the doorway. He didn't turn around. He knew it was Hannah, drawn from her chair by some unspoken need. He heard her hesitant footsteps, the sound of someone treading on unfamiliar, potentially hostile ground.\n\nShe stood by the large wooden kitchen table, her arms wrapped around herself, the horse blanket still clutched about her like a shield. She looked terribly out of place, a pale, urban ghost haunting his earthy kitchen. She watched him for a long time, her gaze following the swift, efficient movements of his hands as he chopped the vegetables and swept them into the sizzling oil in the pot. She was seeing, he suspected, a life lived at a completely different frequency to her own, a life of physical competence and unadorned reality.\n\n\u201cIs there anything I can do?\u201d The question was so quiet he almost didn\u2019t hear it. It was a peace offering, fragile and tentative. Gareth paused, the knife still in his hand, and finally turned to look at her properly. The defiance was gone from her face, replaced by a hollowed-out exhaustion that mirrored his own. There was a faint tremor in her hands. He thought about telling her to peel a carrot, a small, pointless task to give her something to do, but the truth was he didn\u2019t want her help. He wanted her to be still, to be quiet, to not be another problem he had to manage. \u201cNo,\u201d he said, his voice flat but not unkind. \u201cJust sit down before you fall down.\u201d He gestured with the knife towards one of the sturdy wooden chairs at the table. For a second, he saw a flash of her old fire, the instinctive recoil at being told what to do. But it died as quickly as it came, and with a weary sigh that seemed to drain the last of her resistance, she sank onto the chair, pulling the blanket tighter.\n\nHe went back to his cooking, adding stock, herbs, and a handful of pearl barley. Soon, a rich, savory steam began to fill the kitchen, a smell of life and sustenance that slowly began to conquer the lingering odours of sickness and disinfectant. He didn't speak again, and neither did she. She just sat at his table, a silent observer in his world, while he moved around the kitchen, the quiet, competent master of his house. The fragile truce held, a shared, unspoken acknowledgment that for now, they were on the same side, their survival entirely in the hands of the tired man making soup."

Hannah sat at the big oak table, her hands wrapped around the cooling mug of water, and watched. She watched as Gareth moved with an economy of motion that spoke of a lifetime of physical work. He rinsed the pearl barley, his large hands surprisingly deft. He tested the heat of the Aga with a palm held over the hotplate, a gesture of intimate knowledge. He stirred the pot not with a frantic energy, but with a slow, rhythmic circular motion, as if coaxing the flavours from the vegetables rather than forcing them. The room grew warm, the windows beginning to steam, sealing them inside a cocoon of savoury steam and fragile peace. It was a world away from the greasy takeout boxes and overflowing ashtrays of her own flat, a world of intention and substance that felt both deeply intimidating and achingly desirable.\n\nWhen the soup was ready, thick and fragrant, Gareth ladled a small amount into a mug. He didn't serve Hannah first. He carried the mug into the living room, his boots making soft, shuffling sounds on the flagstones. Hannah heard his low, murmuring voice, the tone gentle and reassuring, the words indistinct. He was waking Liam, not with a shake, but with a sound. She watched from the doorway as Gareth sat on the edge of the sofa, supporting Liam\u2019s head with one hand while he held the mug to his lips with the other. \u201cJust a little bit, love,\u201d he was saying. \u201cIt\u2019ll do you good.\u201d Liam, his eyes barely open, sipped obediently, his trust in the man caring for him absolute and unconditional. The gesture was so simple, so profoundly intimate, that Hannah felt a pang of something she couldn\u2019t name. It felt like homesickness for a home she had never had. She turned away, feeling like an intruder, a spy in a foreign land of quiet devotion.\n\nGareth returned to the kitchen and ladled two more bowls of the thick, steaming soup. He placed one on the table in front of her without a word, along with a thick slice of bread from a loaf on the counter. He then sat down opposite her with his own bowl, the first time he had stopped moving for more than a minute. The steam rose between them like a veil. Hannah looked down at the bowl. It was simple food: vegetables, barley, broth. But it felt like the most significant meal of her life. Her stomach, hollow and sour from neglect and sickness, cramped with a sudden, sharp hunger. She picked up the spoon. The first mouthful was hot and savoury and tasted of the earth. It was real. She ate quickly, almost desperately, not looking up, hunched over the bowl as if afraid it might be taken away. She was vaguely aware of Gareth opposite her, eating his own soup slowly, methodically, his gaze lost somewhere in the middle distance.\n\nAs he ate, Gareth felt the layers of his own being slowly reassert themselves. The farmer, the baker, the partner. He looked at the woman opposite him, wolfing down his soup like a starving refugee, and at the doorway to the living room, where the man he loved lay sleeping, breathing steadily for the first time in what felt like an eternity. He had done this. He had brought them here, cleaned them, kept them warm, and now he was feeding them. This was the real narrative. Not a hashtag, not a hero\u2019s journey for a television show. It was the messy, exhausting, unglamorous work of care. It was the rhythmic chopping of vegetables when your body screamed for sleep. It was cleaning up sick and holding a hand in the dark. It was making soup. The grand final of The Great British Bake Off, with its spun sugar and genoise sponges, felt like a story about someone else, a frivolous fiction he\u2019d once allowed himself to believe in.\n\nA wave of dizziness washed over him, so sudden and profound that the room seemed to swim out of focus. He gripped the edge of the heavy table to steady himself, the rough wood digging into his palm. The headache that had been a dull throb was now a sharp, piercing spike behind his right eye. He closed his eyes for a second, taking a slow, careful breath, fighting against the blackness that threatened at the edge of his vision. He was not fine. Arthur had been right. He had been running on a reserve of adrenaline that was now utterly depleted, and the sickness he\u2019d held at bay was beginning to demand its due. He was the pillar holding this fragile structure up, and he could feel a crack forming at its very foundation."

The kitchen, with its comforting smells and solid oak furniture, swam in a disorienting, greasy wave. The sound of the ticking clock on the wall seemed to swell and recede, a warped and unreliable metronome. He heard a chair scrape against the flagstones. It was Hannah. She had risen from her seat and was standing a few feet away, her own soup bowl forgotten.\n\n\u201cAre you alright?\u201d Her voice was thin, laced with a new and unfamiliar note of alarm. It wasn't concern for him, not yet; it was the raw fear of a passenger who has just seen the pilot slump over the controls.\n\n\u201cFine,\u201d Gareth managed to rasp, the lie tasting like rust in his mouth. \u201cJust\u2026 tired.\u201d He tried to push himself up, to reassert the authority of his physical presence, to prove he was still the rock. But his body had staged a full-scale mutiny. His legs buckled, and the room tilted on its axis. He would have gone down, a dead weight of collapsing bone and muscle, if not for two surprisingly strong, thin hands that grabbed his arm, steadying him. He looked down and saw Hannah, her face pale with effort and fright, her jaw set, straining to take a fraction of his weight.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not fine, you idiot,\u201d she said, the words a harsh, panicked whisper. \u201cYou\u2019re sick. Lean on me.\u201d The command was so unexpected, so contrary to the dynamic they had established, that for a moment, Gareth was too stunned to obey. But his body made the choice for him. He sagged against her, a great, lumbering man leaning on this fragile, bird-boned woman. The journey from the kitchen to the living room was a slow, shuffling nightmare, an agonizingly short distance that felt like miles. Hannah grunted with the effort, her breath coming in short, sharp bursts, but she didn\u2019t let go. She guided him to the one remaining empty seat, the old wingback armchair that she had vacated, and he collapsed into it, the springs groaning in protest. The last of his strength evaporated, leaving him utterly spent. He closed his eyes, surrendering to the raging fire behind them. \u201cThe fire\u2026\u201d he mumbled, his voice thick and distant. \u201cDon\u2019t let it go out.\u201d\n\nFor a long time, Hannah stood frozen in the middle of the room, her heart hammering against her ribs. She was alone. The two men who had represented, in their different ways, both her damnation and her salvation, were now incapacitated. Gareth, the formidable pillar of strength, was slumped in the armchair, his breathing suddenly shallow and laboured. Liam was a still mound under a mountain of blankets on the sofa. The house was silent save for the pop and crackle of the dying embers in the hearth. Her first instinct was a primal, screaming urge to run. To grab her keys, get in her car, and just drive, leaving this house of sickness and its complicated, demanding occupants behind her. But she had no keys. She had no car. And she had nowhere to go. The memory of Arthur Webb's grim face and his stark warnings about hospitals and authorities held her in place. She was trapped. But now, she was the one holding the key.\n\nGareth\u2019s final, mumbled instruction echoed in her ears. *The fire.* She looked at the hearth, where the embers were fading from a bright, angry red to a dull, listless orange. Keeping it alive felt like the most important task in the world, the one tangible thing she could do to hold back the encroaching cold and darkness. She had never built a fire in her life. She approached the log basket with the cautious air of someone handling unexploded ordnance, her thin fingers fumbling with the rough, splintery bark of a log. It was heavier than she expected. Awkwardly, she heaved it towards the grate and dropped it. It landed with a dull thud, sending up a puff of grey ash but doing nothing to rekindle the flame. A wave of pathetic, useless fury washed over her. She couldn't even manage this one simple thing.\n\nTears of frustration pricking her eyes, she tried again. She found smaller, lighter pieces of kindling and laid them carefully over the embers, her movements clumsy but deliberate. She used the old iron poker to nudge the logs, trying to mimic the competent, offhand way she had seen Gareth do it. A small tongue of flame licked up the side of the kindling, faltered, and then, miraculously, caught. It grew, slowly at first, then with more confidence, casting its warm, flickering light onto the faces of the two sleeping men. Hannah sank back on her heels, her hands black with soot, a profound, unfamiliar sense of accomplishment settling over her. She had done something. She had held back the dark.\n\nShe spent the rest of the afternoon in a strange, silent vigil. She moved between the three of them, a ghost in a borrowed blanket. She touched Liam\u2019s forehead, relieved to find it still cool and damp. She looked at Gareth, whose face was now flushed with the fever she had seen on her brother. He was shivering, his big frame trembling under the thin horse blanket. She hesitated for only a second before going to the sofa and pulling the top duvet off the mountain covering Liam, dragging it across the room and draping it over Gareth. He didn't stir. She stood there, looking down at him, at the exhausted lines etched around his eyes and mouth, at the faint dusting of flour still caught in his eyebrows. It was a face that had been, only yesterday, a symbol of her oppression, of the unwelcome saviour who had torn her from her life. Now, it was just the face of a good man who had pushed himself far beyond his limits, for them. For her. The soup sat warm and heavy in her stomach. The fire she had just coaxed back to life warmed her skin. Everything that was keeping them alive in this house came from him. The understanding landed not as a thought, but as a physical blow, a deep, internal shift that left her breathless.\n\nHer gaze fell on the mantelpiece. The old doctor\u2019s instructions came back to her, clear and precise. She found the box of antibiotic pills and the sheet of paper on which Arthur had scribbled the dosage times. She found a pen and, on the back of a crumpled receipt from her own pocket, she started a chart. Liam. Gareth. Hannah. She marked down the times of the last dose and calculated the next. She was no longer a passive patient. She was the nurse. She was the one watching the clock. She was the one who would get them through the next twelve hours."

Hannah sat back in the chair, the scrap of paper held in her trembling hand, and stared at it as if it were a map out of a dark forest. Her mind, so used to the frantic, reactive patterns of her own life, struggled to adapt to this new, proactive responsibility. It was terrifying. There were no distractions here, no loud music or cheap vodka to blur the edges of her fear. There was only the quiet house, the ticking clock, and the lives of two men resting squarely on her narrow shoulders. She felt the familiar, bitter rising of resentment. It wasn't fair. None of this was fair. But the feeling had no teeth anymore. It was a phantom ache, a memory of an old anger that had been burned out by the sheer, overwhelming reality of their situation.\n\nTime became her focus, her adversary, and her guide. She watched the clock on the mantelpiece, its steady, indifferent ticking marking the slow passage of the afternoon. She fed the fire, her movements becoming less clumsy, more certain. She learned the feel of the different logs, the way the kindling needed air to catch, the satisfying weight of the poker in her hand. She fetched water from the kitchen, ensuring the mugs beside both Gareth and Liam were always full. These were small, manageable tasks, a litany of actions that kept the larger panic at bay. She was not thinking about the future, about what would happen tomorrow or the day after. She was only thinking about the next hour, the next dose, the next log on the fire.\n\nAt eight o\u2019clock, the alarm she had set on her phone\u2014a device that felt like an artifact from another civilization\u2014emitted a soft, jarring chime. It was time. Her stomach clenched. She poured two glasses of water, her hands shaking so much that some of it sloshed onto the floor. She approached the sofa first, her heart a frantic drum against her ribs. \u201cLiam,\u201d she said, her voice a dry whisper. She touched his shoulder, shaking him gently. \u201cLiam, you need to wake up. Just for a minute.\u201d He stirred, moaning softly, his brow furrowed in a feverish dream. He was lost to her, deep in the medicated sleep Arthur had prescribed. Panic flared in her throat. How could she give him a pill if he couldn't wake up? She remembered Gareth, his gentle voice, his hand supporting Liam's head. Copying his movements felt like a transgression, an act of intimacy she hadn\u2019t earned, but she did it anyway. She cradled the back of Liam\u2019s head, her small hand lost in his sweat-damp hair. \u201cLiam, open your mouth,\u201d she commanded, her voice gaining a sharp, desperate edge. Miraculously, he obeyed, a reflexive, trusting gesture that sent another inexplicable pang through her chest. She quickly popped the pill into his mouth and held the glass to his lips, tipping a small amount of water in, stroking his throat until she felt him swallow. He sank back into the cushions without ever truly waking.\n\nHer next patient was more difficult. Gareth was fully in the grip of the fever now. He was shivering violently despite the heavy duvet, his teeth chattering. When she touched his forehead, the heat was a dry, shocking furnace. He was bigger, stronger, and in his delirium, she was afraid of him. \u201cGareth,\u201d she said, her voice shaking. He mumbled something incoherent, his head tossing from side to side on the cushions. She tried the same technique, cradling his head, but his jaw was clenched tight. A raw, animal fear was radiating from him, a sense of his powerful body being betrayed from within. \u201cGareth, it\u2019s me. It\u2019s Hannah. You have to take this.\u201d She wasn't sure if he could hear her, or if her name even meant anything to him, but she kept talking, her voice low and steady, a desperate imitation of the calm she did not feel. \u201cIt\u2019s the medicine. It will help. Please.\u201d Perhaps it was the sound of her voice, perhaps it was just a moment of lucidity in the fever\u2019s storm, but his jaw relaxed slightly. She seized the opportunity, pushing the pill past his lips, following it with a trickle of water. He coughed, and for a terrifying second she thought he would choke, but then he swallowed, a rough, convulsive movement in his throat. He sank back into the depths of the fever, leaving Hannah trembling, her own body slick with a cold, nervous sweat.\n\nShe retreated to her chair, utterly drained by the ordeal. She had done it. She had followed the instructions. But the night was young, and the house felt vast and full of shadows. To keep herself awake, to keep herself from succumbing to her own bone-deep weariness, she got up and began to pace. She walked into the kitchen, the familiar territory now feeling like her own. She found tea bags in a canister and methodically brewed a pot, the simple ritual a small comfort. As she waited for it to steep, her eyes fell on a cluster of magnets on the old refrigerator door. They held up shopping lists, postcards, and a handful of photographs. One was of Gareth and Liam, taken on a beach, their arms around each other, squinting into a bright sun. Liam was laughing, a real, uninhibited laugh that she hadn't seen on his face in years. Gareth was looking at him, his expression one of quiet, unguarded adoration. It was a perfect, stolen moment of happiness. Next to it was an older, faded photograph of two skinny, grinning children with identical, gappy smiles. A boy with a mop of unruly dark hair, and a girl with pigtails, her arm slung possessively around her older brother's shoulders. It took her a full ten seconds to recognize them as herself and Liam. The image was a punch to the gut, a relic from a time before the silence, before the anger had calcified into a wall between them. She reached out and traced the outline of her own smiling, innocent face with a finger, a ghost touching a ghost. What had happened to them? The question was a genuine, aching wound. She snatched her hand back as if burned and turned away from the silent accusation of the photograph, her throat thick with unshed tears. She carried her mug of tea back into the living room, the past a bitter taste on her tongue."

The photograph remained burned onto the back of Hannah\u2019s eyelids: two children in a sun-drenched, irretrievable past. She had been the one with her arm around him then, the fierce, proud protector of her quiet older brother. Now, she was a stranger in his house, a trespasser on the edges of a life he had built entirely without her, and he was a fragile, sleeping outline under a pile of blankets. The irony was a physical weight, pressing down on her chest, making it hard to breathe. The anger she had nursed for five years felt, for the first time, not like a righteous shield but like a heavy, useless stone she had been carrying for no reason.\n\nThe night stretched on, a vast and silent ocean of time. Hannah found a new rhythm, a stark choreography of survival dictated by the clock. On the hour, every hour, she tended the fire, her movements now practiced and sure. She would then move to the sofa, placing her hand on Liam\u2019s forehead, her ear close to his mouth, listening for the quiet, steady whisper of his breath. It remained unchanged, a small, constant miracle that she clung to. Then she would turn to Gareth. His fever was a wild, unpredictable beast. One hour he would be shivering violently, his teeth chattering a frantic, desperate rhythm; the next he would be still, his skin radiating a dry, burning heat that seemed to consume all the oxygen in the room.\n\nIt was in these moments, when he was lost in the fever\u2019s grip, that he began to talk. The words were fragmented, disjointed, the ramblings of a mind untethered from the present. \u201cThe fence post\u2026 by the five-acre\u2026 needs setting deep, Liam\u2026 the frost\u2019ll heave it\u2026\u201d he mumbled, his hands twitching as if tamping down earth. An hour later, his brow furrowed, his voice became urgent, pleading. \u201cNo\u2026 no, not bilberries. Too tart. Prudence\u2026 she\u2019ll pull a face\u2026 Can\u2019t have that\u2026\u201d He was in the Bake Off tent, his mind replaying his anxieties, and the absurdity of it, the collision of his two worlds, was so poignant it made Hannah\u2019s throat ache. But mostly, he spoke to Liam, or about him. \u201cJust rest, love\u2026 let me get it\u2026 your hands aren\u2019t made for it\u2026\u201d he muttered, a phantom conversation from a thousand ordinary days. He was not the brute force she had first seen, but a man whose every thought, conscious or not, seemed to orbit the well-being of her brother.\n\nAround 3 a.m., the fever peaked. Gareth began to thrash, his powerful limbs tangling in the heavy duvet, his moans turning into guttural, distressed cries. He was fighting something in his sleep, a powerful, unseen enemy. He kicked the duvet off, his large frame exposed to the chill of the room, his body convulsing with shivers that shook the heavy armchair. The sight of his raw, helpless strength terrified her. For a second, she was frozen, the scale of her responsibility overwhelming her. Arthur\u2019s face swam in her mind, his voice stern. *You watch his breathing\u2026* She had to do something. Action was the only antidote to fear. She ran to the kitchen, her mind a frantic blank, until her eyes landed on the tea towels drying by the sink. *Cold compresses.* It was a clich\u00e9 from a film, but it was all she had. She soaked two of them in a bowl of icy water from the tap, her hands numb, and ran back to the living room.\n\nShe approached him cautiously, as one would a wounded animal. \u201cGareth,\u201d she said, her voice a low, soothing murmur she didn\u2019t recognize as her own. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I\u2019m here. Just be still.\u201d He didn\u2019t hear her, his eyes rolling back in their sockets. Taking a deep breath, she leaned over him and pressed the freezing, wet cloth to his forehead. He roared, a deep, incoherent sound of protest, and his arm swung out, catching her on the shoulder. The blow was unintentional, a reflexive spasm, but it sent her stumbling backwards. Fear turned to a spike of pure, clarifying adrenaline. She would not be beaten by this. She moved back to his side, her movements now firm and decisive. She pinned his arm down with one hand while she reapplied the cloth with the other, talking to him constantly, a stream of meaningless, calming nonsense. \u201cIt\u2019s alright now, it\u2019s just the fever, it\u2019ll pass, you\u2019re okay, we\u2019re okay\u2026\u201d She wiped his face, his neck, his chest, the shocking cold of the water finally seeming to penetrate the inferno of the fever. Gradually, the violent thrashing subsided, replaced by a deep, shuddering tremor. The fight went out of him, and he collapsed back into a state of limp, exhausted stillness. Hannah knelt by the chair, her own body shaking, her shoulder aching, utterly spent.\n\nIn the profound quiet that followed, with only the crackling fire for company, the walls she had built around her past began to crumble. The photograph on the fridge had unlocked a door, and now, in the exhausted vulnerability of the pre-dawn hours, the memories flooded in. The fight. It hadn\u2019t been one single thing, but a hundred small resentments culminating in one explosive, unforgivable row. She had dropped out of college, again. She was working a dead-end bar job and living with a man Liam had instantly, correctly, identified as a leech. He had turned up at her grim little flat, his face a mask of disappointment and concern, holding an envelope. It wasn\u2019t a lecture. It was worse. It was a solution. A cheque to pay for a deposit on a new flat, an application for a design course he\u2019d found for her. He had storyboarded her life, just as Gareth had said. He had tried to fix her. \u201cYou can\u2019t live like this, Hannah,\u201d he\u2019d said, his voice laced with a pity that felt like acid. \u201cThis isn\u2019t you.\u201d And she had exploded. \u201cYou don\u2019t know me!\u201d she had screamed, the words tasting of blood and cheap wine. \u201cYou left! You went off and got your fancy job and your perfect life and you look back at me like I\u2019m something you stepped in! You think you can just fix me with your money?\u201d She had thrown the envelope back in his face, the hateful white rectangle a symbol of everything she felt he had become. The last thing he\u2019d said, his voice finally breaking, was, \u201cI just wanted to help.\u201d And she had slammed the door on his hurt, bewildered face, and the silence had begun.\n\nShe looked over at him now, a still shape on the sofa, and the memory was so vivid it was like he\u2019d just spoken the words. *I just wanted to help.* He had always just wanted to help. He had helped her with her homework, he had stood up to bullies for her, he had given her his pocket money when she wanted a new toy. His need to fix things wasn't a judgment; it was the fundamental, unchanging core of who he was. And she had punished him for it. She had pushed him away for the crime of loving her in the only way he knew how. Her breath caught in a sob, a dry, silent spasm of grief for the years they had lost, for the brother she had refused to see. She went to the sofa and knelt on the floor beside him. Tentatively, she reached out and took his hand. It was no longer cold, but warm, a living, human warmth that flowed into her own icy fingers. She just knelt there for a long time, holding her brother\u2019s hand, as the fire burned low and the first, faint, impossibly welcome hint of grey began to soften the black square of the window. The night was almost over. They had survived."

The photograph remained burned onto the back of Hannah\u2019s eyelids: two children in a sun-drenched, irretrievable past. She had been the one with her arm around him then, the fierce, proud protector of her quiet older brother. Now, she was a stranger in his house, a trespasser on the edges of a life he had built entirely without her, and he was a fragile, sleeping outline under a pile of blankets. The irony was a physical weight, pressing down on her chest, making it hard to breathe. The anger she had nursed for five years felt, for the first time, not like a righteous shield but like a heavy, useless stone she had been carrying for no reason at all.\n\nThe night stretched on, a vast and silent ocean of time. Hannah found a new rhythm, a stark choreography of survival dictated by the clock on the mantelpiece. On the hour, every hour, she tended the fire, her movements now practiced and sure, no longer the fumbling, hesitant gestures of the afternoon. She learned the feel of the different logs, the way the kindling needed air to catch, the satisfying weight of the iron poker in her hand. She would then move to the sofa, placing her hand on Liam\u2019s forehead, her ear close to his mouth, listening for the quiet, steady whisper of his breath. It remained unchanged, a small, constant miracle that she clung to as a sailor clings to the North Star. Then she would turn her attention to Gareth, and the real battle.\n\nHis fever was a wild, unpredictable beast. One hour he would be shivering violently, his teeth chattering a frantic, desperate rhythm that seemed to echo the frantic ticking of the clock; the next he would be still, his skin radiating a dry, burning heat that seemed to consume all the oxygen in the room.

It found Hannah still kneeling on the flagstone floor, her head resting on the edge of the sofa, her hand still holding Liam\u2019s. She had drifted into a shallow, dreamless sleep, a state of suspended animation born of utter depletion. The house was cold, the fire having finally surrendered to a pile of grey and black ash, leaving a chill that seeped into her bones. It was this cold that woke her, a deep, internal shiver that had nothing to do with fever.\n\nShe straightened up stiffly, her body a map of aches. Her shoulder throbbed where Gareth\u2019s arm had struck her, and her knees protested the long hours spent on the hard floor. For a moment, she was disoriented, the events of the night a surreal, feverish dream. Then her gaze fell on the two men, and the weight of her reality settled back onto her with crushing force. Gareth was a still, pale mountain in the armchair, his breathing deep and even, the violent shivers gone. The fever had broken. And Liam\u2026 Liam\u2019s eyes were open. He was looking at her, not with the confusion of the previous day, but with a quiet, lucid intensity. He hadn't pulled his hand away.\n\n\u201cMorning,\u201d he whispered, his voice a dry rasp.\n\n\u201cMorning,\u201d she whispered back. The word felt ridiculously, beautifully normal. A wave of emotion so powerful it threatened to drown her washed over her \u2013 relief, guilt, and a fragile, unfamiliar tenderness. She wanted to say a thousand things, to apologize for five years of stubborn, stupid pride, but the words were a logjam in her throat.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re holding my hand,\u201d he stated, not as an accusation, but as a simple, wondering observation. His fingers tightened slightly around hers.\n\n\u201cYou were cold,\u201d she lied, though it was only partly a lie. She had been cold, and his warmth had been an anchor. She started to pull her hand away, suddenly self-conscious, but he held on.\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s Gareth?\u201d he asked, his gaze shifting to the still figure in the armchair. A new, sharper anxiety entered his eyes. \u201cIs he\u2026?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s okay,\u201d Hannah said quickly, her voice taking on the quiet authority she had discovered in the night. \u201cHis fever broke a few hours ago. He\u2019s just\u2026 sleeping. He had a rough night.\u201d The understatement was vast. She saw no point in recounting the delirium, the thrashing, the terror. Liam didn\u2019t need any more guilt to carry. \u201cHe collapsed yesterday. He was sick, too. Sicker than he let on.\u201d\n\nLiam closed his eyes, a single tear escaping and tracing a slow path into his hairline. \u201cOf course he was,\u201d he murmured, his voice thick with self-recrimination. \u201cThe stupid, stubborn, wonderful man. He carried us both.\u201d He looked back at Hannah, his gaze searching her face. \u201cAnd you? You\u2019ve been up all night?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe fire needed watching,\u201d she said, deflecting. She finally managed to retrieve her hand, using the excuse of needing to stand up. She moved to the hearth, her back to him, and began the now-familiar ritual of rebuilding the fire, her movements sure and practiced. She could feel him watching her, trying to reconcile this competent, soot-stained woman with the angry, chaotic sister he had last seen.\n\n\u201cHannah,\u201d he said, his voice stronger now. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d\n\nShe paused, her hand frozen on the iron poker. The apology was not the one she had expected. He was apologizing for getting them into this mess. The apology she owed him was far older, and far deeper. She turned to face him, leaning against the cold stone of the mantelpiece. \u201cNo, you\u2019re not,\u201d she said, her voice low and clear. \u201cI am. I\u2019m the one who\u2019s sorry, Liam. For\u2026 everything. For the door. For the silence.\u201d The confession, spoken aloud after five years, felt like lancing a wound. It hurt, but the relief was immediate, a clean, sharp release of pressure. \u201cYou were just trying to help. You were always just trying to help.\u201d\n\nLiam stared at her, his expression slowly transforming from guilt to stunned comprehension. He pushed himself up on his elbows, wincing at the effort. \u201cHannah\u2026\u201d he began, but he didn't seem to know how to finish. The vast, empty space of their five-year silence could not be filled with a few simple words.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d she said, and for the first time, she believed it might be. \u201cWe can talk about it later. When we\u2019re not all half-dead.\u201d She gave him a small, watery smile, a fragile truce flag raised over the ruins of their relationship. \u201cRight now, I think we need tea. And you need another dose of antibiotics.\u201d She moved towards the kitchen, a sense of purpose steadying her. She was no longer just the patient or the problem. She was part of the solution.\n\nShe returned with two steaming mugs of tea and the small box of pills. Liam had managed to sit up properly, his back propped against the arm of the sofa. He looked pale and gaunt, but the light was back in his eyes. He took the pill she offered without protest and wrapped his hands around the warm mug she gave him, his gaze following her as she moved to Gareth\u2019s side. She knelt and gently shook Gareth's shoulder. \u201cGareth? Can you wake up?\u201d\n\nHis eyelids fluttered open. His eyes were bleary and unfocused, but the wildness of the fever was gone. He looked at her, then past her to Liam, who was watching them from the sofa. A flicker of understanding, then immense relief, softened the harsh lines of his face. \u201cHe\u2019s alright?\u201d he rasped, his voice a gravelly ruin.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s fine,\u201d Hannah said softly. \u201cHe\u2019s a lot better than you are. You need to take your pill.\u201d She helped him sit forward, holding the mug of tea to his lips after he\u2019d swallowed the medication. He drank greedily, his body craving the warmth and hydration. He was still weak, his movements heavy and uncoordinated, but he was present, his mind his own again. He sank back into the chair, his gaze locked on Liam, a silent, profound conversation passing between them.\n\nThe sound of a car engine rattling up the drive broke the spell. Hannah\u2019s head snapped up, a jolt of anxiety piercing the fragile peace. Arthur. She went to the window and peered out as the old Volvo estate pulled into the yard. The doctor got out, moving with the same stiff, deliberate pace as the day before, his leather bag in his hand. Hannah turned from the window. \u201cHe\u2019s here,\u201d she announced, her voice tight. The three of them waited in silence as footsteps crunched on the gravel outside, the heavy back door opened and closed, and then Dr. Webb appeared in the doorway of the living room. He stopped dead, his sharp eyes taking in the scene before him: the fire burning brightly, Gareth awake in his chair, Liam sitting up on the sofa, and Hannah, standing between them, a mug of tea in her hand, her face smudged with soot but her posture straight and her gaze steady. It was a tableau of recovery, a world away from the desperate, chaotic scene he had left. His stern expression softened almost imperceptibly, a flicker of something that might have been surprise, or even grudging approval. \u201cWell,\u201d he said, his voice a low rumble. \u201cIt appears you\u2019ve survived the night.\u201d"

He placed his bag on the floor with a soft, familiar thud, his gaze moving methodically from one person to the next. The scene told a story of its own, and he was a man who knew how to read the signs.\n\nHe went to Liam first, his movements brisk and professional. He took Liam\u2019s wrist, his fingers finding the pulse with practiced ease. \u201cSit up straight, lad,\u201d he commanded, pulling out his stethoscope. The examination was a repeat of the one before, but the atmosphere was entirely different. There was no desperate tension, only a watchful, hopeful quiet. After a long moment of listening to Liam\u2019s chest, Arthur straightened up, a grunt of satisfaction escaping him. \u201cWell, the rattle\u2019s gone. You sound less like a bag of wet leaves and more like a human lung. The steroids are doing their job. You\u2019re a lucky boy.\u201d He gave Liam a sharp, almost accusatory look. \u201cAnd you\u2019re a fool. But you knew that already.\u201d\n\nNext, he turned to Gareth, who watched his approach with the weary resignation of a man who has no fight left in him. \u201cAnd you,\u201d Arthur said, his voice laced with a dry, paternal disapproval. \u201cYou I\u2019m less pleased with.\u201d He pressed the cold metal of the stethoscope to Gareth\u2019s broad chest. He listened for a long time, his brow furrowed. \u201cThe inflammation is there, but it\u2019s not as deep. You\u2019re right as rain compared to how you could have been. But you\u2019re running on empty. You\u2019ve burned through every reserve you have. Don\u2019t think I can\u2019t hear the exhaustion in your heart rate.\u201d He packed the stethoscope away. \u201cYou\u2019re a patient now, Gareth. Act like one. If you try to play the hero again, you\u2019ll collapse properly, and then this whole sorry enterprise falls apart.\u201d\n\nFinally, he faced Hannah. He didn\u2019t reach for his bag. He simply looked at her, his sharp eyes taking in the soot on her cheek, the dark smudges of exhaustion under her eyes, and the newfound steel in her posture. He\u2019d left a sullen, angry girl in this chair and returned to find a woman in her place. \u201cI hear you had a rough night with him,\u201d he said, nodding towards Gareth.\n\n\u201cHis fever was bad,\u201d Hannah confirmed, her voice low. \u201cHe was thrashing. I used cold compresses.\u201d\n\nArthur\u2019s gaze sharpened, dropping to her shoulder where the dark fabric of her jumper was slightly askew. \u201cHe catch you with one of his flailing arms?\u201d he asked, his tone matter-of-fact. Hannah instinctively touched her shoulder, surprised he had noticed. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. A bruise.\u201d Arthur gave a short, sharp nod. \u201cLet me see your arm.\u201d He took her pulse, checked her breathing with a cursory listen, his expression unreadable. \u201cYou\u2019re the strongest of the lot of them,\u201d he pronounced, a statement of fact, not praise. \u201cProbably because you\u2019ve spent the last twenty-four hours running on fear instead of adrenaline. More sustainable, in the short term.\u201d He looked her directly in the eye. \u201cYou did well, lass. You kept them alive.\u201d\n\nThe quiet, unadorned words landed with more force than any effusive praise could have. They were a validation, a recognition of her trial by fire. Hannah felt a hot flush of tears behind her eyes and blinked them back furiously. She simply nodded, unable to speak.\n\nArthur stood in the middle of the room, their doctor, their jailer, and their only link to the world they had fled. \u201cRight,\u201d he said, addressing them all. \u201cThe news from outside. The cordon around Hartlepool is still in place, but they\u2019re starting to let essential services through. The official story is a chemical fire at the plant, contained now, but the leak was worse than they\u2019re admitting publicly. They\u2019re doing a house-to-house search of the exclusion zone. They\u2019re finding people. The hospitals are full. As far as the world is concerned,\u201d he paused, letting the weight of his next words sink in, \u201cthe three of you are currently unaccounted for. Liam\u2019s car is on a list. His and Hannah\u2019s names are on another. You, Gareth, for the moment, are simply a loose end they haven\u2019t tied up yet.\u201d\n\nThe implications were stark and terrifying. They were not just sick; they were fugitives from a disaster, ghosts in their own lives. \u201cSo what do we do?\u201d Liam asked, his voice barely a whisper.\n\n\u201cYou do nothing,\u201d Arthur commanded. \u201cYou stay here. You rest. You drink water. You finish your course of antibiotics. You let your lungs heal. In a week, you\u2019ll be weak, but you\u2019ll be people again. Then, you can decide how you want to reappear in the world. But for the next seven days, this farm is your entire universe. No phones, no internet, no contact. Am I clear?\u201d\n\nThey all murmured their assent, a chorus of chastened patients. Arthur seemed satisfied. He placed fresh vials and another box of pills on the mantelpiece. \u201cSame again. I\u2019ll be back in two days unless you call me. And I expect to see all three of you sitting up and complaining about the quality of the soup by then.\u201d He turned to leave, but paused in the doorway and looked back at Hannah. \u201cYou\u2019ll need to get some more logs from the shed out back,\u201d he said. \u201cThis one,\u201d he nodded at Gareth, \u201cis to do nothing more strenuous than breathe. You\u2019re in charge of the fire now.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a suggestion. It was a transfer of command. Then, with a final, curt nod, he was gone, leaving them alone in the new world he had just defined for them: a world of quiet convalescence, of shared history and uncertain futures, a world with a new, unlikely guardian at its heart."

                                        "text": "The heavy thud of the back door closing behind Arthur Webb echoed in the room, sealing them into their new reality. The world had been officially shrunk to the four walls of the farmhouse. For a long moment, nobody spoke. The silence was different now; it was no longer the tense, watchful quiet of a hospital bedside, but the deep, strange stillness of a ship becalmed after a storm, its crew weary and its destination unknown. The fire, which Hannah had diligently fed through the night, was beginning to burn low again, a visual reminder of the constant, necessary work of survival.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s right,\u201d Hannah said, her voice quiet but firm, breaking the spell. \u201cThe fire.\u201d She looked at the depleted log basket, then at Gareth, slumped in the armchair. This was his domain, his task. But Arthur\u2019s final words had been a clear directive, a formal handing over of a key. She pulled the horse blanket, which she had come to think of as her uniform, more tightly around her shoulders and walked towards the back door. \u201cI\u2019ll get them.\u201d Gareth\u2019s mouth opened as if to protest, to offer instructions, but he closed it again, a flicker of frustration crossing his face before it was replaced by a profound, weary acceptance. He simply nodded, a tiny inclination of his head, and watched her go.\n\nThe air outside was cold and clean, a shock to her system after the close, human-scented warmth of the house. It smelled of damp earth and the distant, clean scent of the sea, a world away from the chemical tang of Hartlepool that still seemed to cling to the inside of her nostrils. She followed a worn path across the yard to a large, open-fronted shed. The moment she stepped under its roof, she stepped into Gareth\u2019s world. It was a cathedral of quiet competence. Tools hung in neat, orderly rows on the walls, each hook and nail perfectly placed. Sacks of feed were stacked with geometric precision. The air smelled of sawdust, old iron, and a faint, not unpleasant scent of engine oil. It was a space that spoke of a man who found solace in order, who built his life with his own two hands. She felt like an intruder, but also like a student in a silent classroom.\n\nIn the far corner was a huge, neatly stacked wall of logs, sorted by size. It was an intimidating sight, a testament to seasons of labour she couldn't begin to imagine. She started with the smaller pieces, gathering them into her arms. They were heavier than they looked, their rough bark digging into the soft skin of her inner arms. She was weak, her body still fighting the dregs of the sickness, and the small pile she managed to gather felt pathetic. Gritting her teeth, she went back for more, this time grabbing a couple of the larger, denser logs. She staggered back towards the house, her arms aching, her breath misting in the cold air, a small, determined figure carrying a burden that was both a chore and a responsibility.\n\nShe stumbled back into the living room, dropping the logs with a clatter into the basket by the hearth. The noise made both men jump. She ignored them, her focus entirely on the task. Kneeling down, she began to rebuild the fire with the careful, deliberate movements she had perfected during her long night watch. A piece of kindling first, then the smaller logs, leaving gaps for the air to circulate. Gareth watched from his chair, his hands clenched on the armrests, the instinct to take over, to correct, to do it *right*, warring with the leaden weakness in his limbs. \"The damper,\" he croaked, his voice rough with disuse. \"On the left. Open it a crack more.\" Hannah paused, then reached up and adjusted the small lever on the flue, her movements precise. She didn't question him. It was not a battle of wills anymore; it was a collaboration. The flames caught, licking hungrily at the fresh wood, and the room was once again filled with a steady, life-giving warmth. She had done it. She was in charge of the fire.\n\nThe day fell into a new, quiet rhythm. A routine of forced rest and shared, simple tasks. While Gareth and Liam slept, drifting in and out of a healing, medicated haze, Hannah became the house\u2019s custodian. She warmed the rest of the soup for lunch, the three of them eating in a near-total silence that was no longer awkward, but companionable. She washed the few dishes in the sink, the warm, soapy water on her hands a small, grounding pleasure. She found a book on a shelf\u2014a collection of poetry by a writer she\u2019d never heard of\u2014and sat in her chair, not reading, but just holding it, the quiet presence of the words a comfort. She was the sentinel, the keeper of the flame, and the role settled on her not as a burden, but as a purpose.\n\nLater that afternoon, as the light outside began to fade to a soft, bruised purple, Liam woke properly. He watched her for a while as she sat staring into the fire, lost in thought. \"You're good at that,\" he said softly. Hannah started, pulled from her reverie. \"What?\" \"The fire,\" he clarified, gesturing with his head. \"You look like you've been doing it your whole life.\" She snorted, a small, wry sound. \"Hardly. I think the last thing I built was a tower of empty beer cans in my first year of uni.\" The casual, self-deprecating comment about her old life hung in the air, a ghost at their quiet convalescence.\n\nLiam\u2019s expression grew serious. He looked at his sister, truly looked at her, and saw not the angry, defensive girl who had slammed a door in his face, but a tired, brave woman who had faced down a night of terror for him. \"Hannah,\" he began, his voice low and hesitant. \"Last night... I don't really remember much. Was it... was it bad?\"\n\nHannah considered her answer. She could spare him the details, protect him as he had always tried to protect her. But the time for that was over. The truth, stripped of drama, was what they needed now. \"It was bad,\" she said, her gaze steady. \"Gareth's fever was... high. He was delirious for a while.\" She paused, then decided to offer him a small, strange piece of the truth she had witnessed. \"He talked. In his sleep.\" A flicker of alarm crossed Liam\u2019s face. \"What did he say?\"\n\n\"He talked about the farm. About fixing a fence. And he talked about a cake,\" she said, watching his face. \"Something about bilberries, and a woman named Prudence, and not wanting her to pull a face like she was sucking a wasp.\" A ghost of a smile touched Liam's lips, a sad, fond expression. \"The Bake Off,\" he murmured, more to himself than to her. \"The bloody final.\" He looked from Hannah to the sleeping form of his partner, and the full, crushing weight of the situation seemed to land on him. \"It was on Tuesday, Hannah. The grand final of The Great British Bake Off. He was in it. He was going to win it. I was so sure. I filled in the application, I filmed his video, I\u2026 I built this whole narrative for him.\" He shook his head, his voice thick with a fresh wave of guilt. \"And he threw it all away. To come and get me. Because I had to come and get you.\" He finally looked at her, his eyes shining with unshed tears. \"That's what he gave up.\" And in that moment, Hannah finally understood the true cost of their fractured past, the scale of the sacrifice that had been laid, unasked, at the foot of their broken sibling bond. It was a debt so immense she knew she could never repay it, but could only hope to honour it, starting now, in the quiet, fire-lit room of their shared sanctuary."

This wasn't just a man who had missed a day of work. This was a man who had walked away from the crowning moment of a secret, second life. A life of passion and precision that existed in parallel to the mud and muck she had so dismissively defined him by. The flour still caught in his eyebrows was not just the dust of the farm; it was the mark of his art. She thought of his delirious ramblings about bilberries and the wasp-sucking face of a judge named Prudence. It hadn't been madness; it had been the ghost of a dream he was losing, even in his sleep.\n\nLiam\u2019s face was a mask of wretched misery. He scrubbed at his eyes with the back of his hand, a gesture of futility against the tide of his guilt. \u201cI pushed him into it,\u201d he whispered, his voice cracking. \u201cI made him believe he could be this\u2026 this folk hero. I built the story. And then I made him choose between his own story and mine.\u201d He looked at his sister, his expression one of complete devastation. \u201cI ruin things, Hannah. That\u2019s what I do. I ruined us, and now I\u2019ve ruined this for him.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Hannah said, the word sharp and immediate. She crossed the room and sat on the floor by the sofa, forcing him to look at her. \u201cHe chose. He\u2019s a grown man, Liam. He heard about a chemical leak and he knew you were a stupid, loyal idiot who would run straight into it. So he made a choice. He chose you.\u201d Her own words surprised her, the clarity of them. This wasn't about blame. It was simpler, and far more profound, than that. \u201cHe chose you over a cake competition. I\u2019d say that makes him a hero, just not the kind you can put on television.\u201d\n\nShe left him with that thought, a small offering of absolution, and retreated to the kitchen. She needed to do something, anything, to quiet the roaring in her own head. The kitchen, Gareth\u2019s domain, felt different now. It wasn\u2019t just a place for making soup; it was a studio, a laboratory. Her eyes scanned the shelves, the countertops, searching for a clue to this other man. And then she saw it, tucked away on a cool slate shelf in the pantry, just as he\u2019d described in his fever-dream. A large glass jar, covered with a muslin cloth. Inside was a bubbling, beige-coloured substance that smelled faintly of sour apples and yeast. His sourdough starter. The thing he had conducted whispered, one-sided conversations with. The thing he had apologized to when he\u2019d neglected it. It looked sluggish, a few sad bubbles rising to the surface. It was another casualty of the last two days, another living thing he cared for that had been left to fend for itself.\n\nOn an impulse she didn't fully understand, she lifted the jar and placed it on the large wooden worktop. She found a bag of stone-ground wholemeal flour in a ceramic crock and a canister of water. She had no idea what she was doing. She was a woman who lived on takeaways and toast, a stranger to the patient alchemy of baking. But she measured a scoop of flour and a splash of water into the jar, her movements hesitant and clumsy. She stirred it with a wooden spoon, trying to infuse the act with the same intention she had seen in Gareth\u2019s hands. It was a pathetic, fumbling attempt to honour him, to care for a small piece of his abandoned dream.\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d The voice, low and gravelly, made her jump so violently that she nearly dropped the jar. Gareth was standing in the doorway, leaning heavily against the frame, his face pale and drawn but his eyes clear and sharp. He was watching her, his expression a mixture of profound confusion and something else, something she couldn't read.\n\n\u201cI\u2026 I heard you talking,\u201d she stammered, feeling like a child caught doing something forbidden. \u201cIn your sleep. You were worried about it. Your starter. It looked\u2026 sad. I was just giving it some flour.\u201d She gestured uselessly at the jar, her face burning with embarrassment.\n\nGareth looked from her face to the jar on his worktop, then back again. He was silent for a long moment, processing the impossible sight of his partner\u2019s estranged, angry sister standing in his kitchen, ineptly tending to his sourdough. A slow, weary smile touched the corners of his mouth. It was the first time she had seen him smile. It transformed his tired, rugged face into something gentle and impossibly kind. \u201cA bit more water,\u201d he said, his voice a quiet rasp. \u201cIt likes to be the consistency of thick paint.\u201d He pushed himself off the doorframe and shuffled slowly to the table, sinking into a chair with a low groan, his brief burst of energy spent. He didn't take over. He didn't criticize. He just sat at his own table and gave her instructions, a quiet teacher guiding his most unlikely student. \u201cAnd stir it from the bottom. That\u2019s where the good stuff is.\u201d\n\nLiam appeared in the doorway then, drawn by the sound of their voices. He stood, leaning against the frame just as Gareth had, and watched the scene: his sister, her face smudged with flour, carefully stirring a jar of bubbling yeast, while his partner, looking frail but present, gave quiet instructions from the kitchen table. The frantic, storyboarded narrative was gone, replaced by this quiet, strange, and deeply authentic moment. The kitchen was filled with a peace that felt more real than any hashtag.\n\nIt was in that moment of profound, healing quiet that the telephone on the wall let out a sudden, shrill, piercing ring. The sound was an assault, a violent intrusion from a world they had forgotten. All three of them froze, their heads snapping towards the sound as if a gunshot had been fired. It rang again, a harsh, demanding summons. No one moved. They were united in their stillness, a trinity of fugitives. The ringing stopped, and was followed by the loud, mechanical clunk of the ancient answering machine kicking in. A moment of static, and then a woman\u2019s voice, bright, professional, and terrifyingly normal, filled the kitchen.\n\n\u201cHi Gareth, it\u2019s Sarah from Love Productions. We\u2019re just calling\u2026 again. Everyone was so worried when you didn\u2019t arrive for the final. We\u2019ve tried your mobile, but it\u2019s going straight to voicemail. We just want to know you\u2019re okay. It\u2019s not like you to just disappear. Please, give us a call as soon as you get this.\u201d There was a pause, a faint sigh on the line. \u201cWe hope you\u2019re alright, Gaz. The tent wasn\u2019t the same without you.\u201d Another clunk, and then silence. A silence more profound and absolute than any that had come before. The secret was no longer a secret. It was out, a disembodied voice hanging in the air between them, a testament to the life Gareth had left behind on a roadside in Hartlepool. He didn\u2019t look at Liam or Hannah. He just stared at his own large, capable hands resting on the oak of the kitchen table, as if seeing them for the first time."

                                        "text": "The silence that descended was a new element in the room, different from the tense quiet of sickness or the companionable quiet of shared soup. This silence was a vacuum, created by the sudden intrusion of a world that was supposed to be sealed off. It was thick with the ghost of the producer's cheerful, concerned voice, with the weight of hashtags and showstoppers and a life of bright lights and buttercream that had been happening, concurrently, just beyond the horizon of the Eston Hills. Gareth continued to stare at his hands on the table. They looked like foreign objects to him. These were the hands that could coax a perfect crumb from a difficult dough, that understood the precise temperature for proofing, that could craft a delicate lattice of spun sugar. They were also the hands that had hauled his partner from a toxic flat, scrubbed poison from his sister-in-law's skin, and built a fire in the dead of night to ward off a fever. The two identities felt irreconcilable, and the man who owned these hands felt like a fraud in both worlds.\n\nLiam, leaning in the doorway, physically seemed to shrink. The cheerful voice from London, the casual affection in the phrase \u2018Gaz\u2019, the simple, devastating fact that they were worried, that he was missed, was a hundred times more damning than his own internal monologue of guilt. He had known, abstractly, what he was asking Gareth to leave behind. But hearing it, spoken in the language of that other life, made it a concrete, monstrous crime. He had not just pulled his partner away from an opportunity; he had torn him from a community, a place where he was valued and happy. A place where Liam himself had pushed him to go. He couldn't look at Gareth. He squeezed his eyes shut, as if he could block out the sound of his own colossal failure.\n\nIt was Hannah who moved first. Her gaze flickered from Liam's crumpled form to Gareth\u2019s rigid, silent back. She saw the full, devastating circuit of love and sacrifice and guilt laid bare between them. The old Hannah, the one from three days ago, would have seen this as a victory, a crack in their perfect life she could exploit. But the woman standing in the kitchen, her hands still faintly sticky from feeding a sourdough starter, felt only a profound, aching sorrow. With a quiet deliberation that felt monumental, she picked up the wooden spoon and gave the starter one last, gentle stir. It was a small, seemingly insane gesture in the face of the emotional cataclysm, but it was an act of continuation. It was a choice. This is what is real now. This bubbling pot of yeast, this kitchen, this man.\n\nShe placed the spoon down softly on the counter. \"So,\" she said, her voice small but clear in the heavy silence. \"Prudence. Does she really suck wasps for a living, or is that just a hobby?\"\n\nThe absurdity of the question, the sheer, gentle ridiculousness of it, was a pinprick in a giant, over-inflated balloon. Liam opened his eyes, a choked, half-strangled sound that might have been a sob or a laugh escaping his throat. Gareth didn't turn around, but the rigid line of his shoulders softened almost imperceptibly. The question acknowledged everything without demanding anything. It was a gift of deflection, a ladder out of the pit of suffocating silence.\n\nGareth finally pushed his chair back, the legs scraping loudly against the stone floor. He stood up, but he didn't turn to face them. He walked slowly to the kitchen window, the one that looked out past the yard, over the winter-bare fields towards the hulking, familiar shape of Roseberry Topping in the distance. He braced his hands on the windowsill, his head bowed. He was a farmer looking at his land. It was his anchor, his truth, the one thing that had been real before baking and before Liam and would be real long after. This view had seen him through the death of his parents, through bitter winters and failed crops and the solitary ache of a lonely life. It was seeing him through this, too.\n\n\"No,\" he said at last, his voice a low rumble directed at the glass. \"It's just her face when she tries something she thinks is 'overly rustic'.\" He took a deep, shuddering breath of the air in his own kitchen, which still smelled faintly of soup and woodsmoke. \"Liam.\" He said the name without turning, a simple, quiet command. \"Go and sit down on the sofa before you fall over. You look like a ghost.\" The words were blunt, practical, devoid of anger or accusation. It was the most profound act of forgiveness he could offer: the simple, mundane continuation of care. He had made his choice two days ago, and he was making it again, now, by turning his back on the ghost in the answering machine and focusing on the living, breathing man in his house."
