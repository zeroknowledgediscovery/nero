     "novel_text": "The phone didn't so much ring as vibrate itself into a furious spasm against the chipped laminate of her bedside table. It sounded like a trapped hornet, a noise of pure, undiluted panic. Kaia\u2019s hand shot out from under the thin duvet, fumbling in the pre-dawn gloom of her London flatshare. Her fingers found the buzzing plastic, slick with the condensation of a cold room. The screen was an obnoxious splash of white light: 'UNKNOWN CALLER'. Probably the landlord again, chasing the extra twenty quid for the busted toaster. She nearly swiped it to decline. Nearly. But some other instinct, a tiny fizz of maybe-perhaps-what-if that had lived in her stomach for the past forty-eight hours, made her thumb slide the other way.\n\n\u201cHello?\u201d Her voice was a croak, thick with sleep and the lingering taste of yesterday\u2019s instant noodles.\n\n\u201cIs this Kaia Morehu?\u201d The voice on the other end was pure clipped efficiency. A voice that organised people and things into neat, profitable columns.\n\n\u201cUh, yeah. Speaking.\u201d She sat up, the duvet pooling around her waist. A draft slithered in through the window frame, which never quite closed properly.\n\n\u201cKaia, this is Clarissa from Syco Entertainment. I\u2019m one of the senior producers on Britain\u2019s Got Talent.\u201d\n\nKaia\u2019s entire respiratory system decided, at that precise moment, to go on strike. Air hitched in her throat. The trapped hornet had been a premonition. Her heart took over, thumping a frantic, unsteady rhythm against her ribs, a drum solo for an audience of one.\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d she managed, the single word a masterpiece of Kiwi understatement. Inside, a chorus of a thousand tiny voices was screaming.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just calling to officially inform you\u2026\u201d A pause. A professionally calibrated, dramatically perfect pause. Kaia could almost see the woman in her mind\u2019s eye: sharp blazer, sharper haircut, a smile that didn\u2019t quite reach the eyes, holding a clipboard that held the entire world. \u201c\u2026that you\u2019ve made it. You\u2019re through to the final.\u201d\n\nThe world didn't so much explode as dissolve. It simply ceased to be a collection of solid objects \u2013 the lumpy mattress, the peeling poster of a T\u016b\u012b on the wall, the precarious stack of university textbooks \u2013 and became, instead, pure, unadulterated feeling. A supernova of joy. A tidal wave of disbelief. She wasn't breathing. She was pretty sure she'd forgotten how.\n\n\u201cKaia? Are you still there?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d she finally gasped, the words tumbling out on a rush of long-overdue air. \u201cOh my god. I\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m in. The final?\u201d She said it as a question, needing to hear it again, to make the impossible sound real.\n\n\u201cThe grand final,\u201d Clarissa confirmed, a sliver of genuine warmth colouring her tone now that the official business was done. \u201cCongratulations. You truly deserve it. Your semi-final performance\u2026 it was something special, Kaia. The phones went into meltdown.\u201d\n\nHer semi-final. It felt like a lifetime ago, a dream she\u2019d had. Standing on that enormous, unforgiving X, the studio lights hot enough to melt plastic, the four judges just distant silhouettes against a roaring, faceless crowd. She\u2019d sung an old waiata, a song her Nan had taught her. \u2018P\u014dkarekare Ana\u2019. A simple love song, but one that carried the weight of home, of the green hills and the wild, grey sea of the West Coast. She\u2019d started small, her voice barely a whisper, her only accompaniment the acoustic guitar cradled in her arms. She\u2019d felt terrifyingly small and alone, a kiwi in a cage of lions. But then she\u2019d closed her eyes and thought of her Nan, of her voice, reedy and strong, singing it across the kitchen table. She\u2019d thought of her Dad, his impossibly wide grin. She\u2019d thought of the smell of rain on hot asphalt in her hometown, Greymouth. And the song had bloomed. Her voice, freed from the cage of her nerves, had soared out into the vast, dark auditorium, filled it, owned it. When she\u2019d finished, the silence that followed was more profound, more terrifying than any noise. It stretched for a single, perfect heartbeat. And then the place had erupted. A wall of sound, of applause, of people on their feet. Even Simon, the emperor of stone-faced disapproval, had looked\u2026 moved. He\u2019d called it \u2018utterly, breathtakingly authentic\u2019. Amanda had been in tears.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll need you at the studios tomorrow at nine a.m. sharp,\u201d Clarissa was saying, pulling her from the memory. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot to get through. Press calls, choreography, wardrobe, staging concepts. It\u2019s going to be a full-on week, so get some rest. And Kaia?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell done.\u201d\n\nThe line clicked dead. Kaia stared at the phone, at the blank screen, then slowly lowered it. She looked around her tiny room. The same room that had, five minutes ago, felt like a shoebox, a temporary holding cell. Now it was the launchpad. The epicentre of the rest of her life. A laugh bubbled up from her chest, a strange, hysterical sound. She was in the final of Britain\u2019s Got Talent. Her. Kaia Morehu from Greymouth, New Zealand. The girl who learned to play guitar on her Dad\u2019s beat-up old six-string and whose biggest audience, until a few months ago, had been the slightly drunk patrons at the local pub\u2019s open mic night. It was insane. It was impossible. It was happening.\n\nShe scrambled for the phone again, her fingers clumsy with adrenaline. She scrolled to \u2018Mum and Dad\u2019 and hit the call button, forgetting, in her delirium, about the twelve-hour time difference. It would be evening there. They\u2019d be home from work, probably Dad in his armchair with the paper, Mum in the kitchen making something that smelled of home.\n\nIt rang. Once. Twice.\n\n\u201cKaia? Is everything alright, darling?\u201d Her mum\u2019s voice, fuzzy and distant, but so unmistakably *her*. The sound was an anchor.\n\n\u201cMum!\u201d Kaia squeaked, tears suddenly pricking her eyes. Tears of joy, of shock, of a homesickness so acute it felt like a physical ache. \u201cMum, I got in!\u201d\n\n\u201cGot in? Got in where, love? Are you talking about that course\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cNo! No. BGT. Britain\u2019s Got Talent. The final. Mum, I\u2019m in the final!\u201d\n\nThere was a muffled sound on the other end, of the phone being passed, a confused, \u201cWhat\u2019s she saying, Deb?\u201d from her dad.\n\n\u201cBrian, she\u2019s in! She\u2019s in the final!\u201d Her mum\u2019s voice rose, cracking with excitement. A loud whoop echoed down the line, her dad\u2019s signature sound of pure, unadulterated delight.\n\n\u201cYou little beauty!\u201d he bellowed, his voice so loud Kaia had to pull the phone away from her ear. \u201cI told you! I told your mother! Didn\u2019t I tell you, Deb? Our girl\u2019s a star!\u201d\n\nKaia laughed, the tears now freely tracing paths down her cheeks. She could picture them so clearly: Mum leaning against the kitchen counter, one hand pressed to her chest, Dad probably doing a little victory jig in the lounge, scattering the newspaper. They\u2019d been so worried about her coming all this way, to this vast, indifferent city. They\u2019d pooled their savings to help with her student visa and the deposit on the flat, their faces a mixture of pride and fear at the airport. Now, their joy was a tangible thing, a warm current flowing thousands of miles across oceans and continents to reach her in this cold little room.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have to watch it live,\u201d her mum was saying, a practical edge to her excitement. \u201cWhat time will it be on? Brian, you\u2019ll have to figure out the streaming thing on the computer. The one you use for the rugby.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you worry, I\u2019ll get it sorted. We\u2019ll have the whole street over! We\u2019ll have a party!\u201d her dad boomed. \u201cYou just go out there and smash it, K. Sing your heart out. We\u2019re so, so proud of you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will, Dad. I love you guys.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe love you too, darling. So much. Now go on, you\u2019ll need your sleep. Call us tomorrow. Oh, this is just the best news!\u201d\n\nShe hung up, a wide, tremulous smile plastered on her face. The exhaustion had vanished, replaced by a jittery, high-octane energy. Sleep was impossible. She slid out of bed, her bare feet cold on the floorboards, and went to the window. The sky over London was beginning to lighten, a palette of bruised purple and soft, smudged grey. The city was slowly waking up, a low, distant hum of traffic starting to build. For the first time since she\u2019d arrived, it didn\u2019t feel alien or overwhelming. It felt like a city of possibility. A city where a girl from the other side of the world could stand on a stage and sing a song about her home and, somehow, be heard. She hugged her arms around herself, a shiver running through her that had nothing to do with the cold. It was the thrill of it. The terror of it. The final. In one week, she\u2019d be back on that stage, singing for the title, for the prize money, for the chance to do this \u2013 just this, sing \u2013 for the rest of her life. For a moment, she allowed herself to dream. An album. A tour. Maybe even paying her parents back. Maybe, just maybe, buying a guitar that wasn't second-hand. The possibilities felt infinite.\n\nThe next morning, the studio was a hive of controlled chaos. It smelled of hairspray, hot lights, and expensive coffee. People with clipboards and headsets swarmed through the corridors, their faces set with a uniform expression of intense purpose. Kaia, clutching her guitar case like a life raft, felt her small-town-girl status more keenly than ever. She was given a laminated pass with her photo on it \u2013 a terrible, deer-in-the-headlights shot from her first audition \u2013 and pointed towards a large rehearsal room.\n\nInside, a handful of the other finalists were already there, scattered around the room in loose, uncertain clumps. There was the dance troupe of teenagers from Manchester, all identical tracksuits and nervous energy; the magician with the intense eyes and the pack of cards he was shuffling with impossible speed; the family of string players, their cellos and violins leaning against the wall like silent, watchful relatives. A man with a kind face and a clipboard introduced himself as Liam, her designated Artist Liaison. His job, he explained, was to be her main point of contact for the week.\n\n\u201cRight, Kaia, sweet as,\u201d he said, his London accent a friendly contrast to Clarissa\u2019s cut-glass tones. \u201cFirst up, a quick chat with the producers about song choice. They\u2019ve got some ideas, but obviously, the final call is yours. Then it\u2019s a preliminary wardrobe fitting, a session with the vocal coach, and a quick on-camera chat for the VT. Busy day, but we\u2019ll get you through it.\u201d\n\nShe nodded, her throat suddenly dry. \"Song choice?\"\n\n\"Yeah. They loved the waiata, obviously. It was magic. But for the final... they're wondering if maybe you should do something more... familiar. A big ballad. Something everyone knows, that you can put your own spin on. Just an idea to float.\"\n\nKaia's heart sank a little. The whole point, for her, was the authenticity. Singing a cover of some Whitney Houston power ballad felt... fake. It wasn't her. But she just nodded. \"Okay. I can think about it.\"\n\nShe was led into a smaller, plusher office where Clarissa and two other producers sat behind a large desk. The smiles were wider today. She was a finalist. She was valuable.\n\n\"Kaia, darling, come in!\" Clarissa said, gesturing to a chair. \"How are you feeling? Thrilled?\"\n\n\"Yeah, pretty chuffed,\" Kaia admitted, the Kiwi phrase slipping out. It earned her a blank look from one of the producers, a man with a suspiciously smooth forehead.\n\n\"Right. So, the final. We want to go bigger. We're thinking a full orchestra. A gospel choir, perhaps. White dress. Dry ice. The works. We need a moment, Kaia. A Susan Boyle moment.\"\n\nKaia swallowed. \"An orchestra? Wow. I've only ever played with my guitar.\"\n\n\"Exactly! The contrast will be stunning,\" the smooth-foreheaded man said. \"Now, song. We've compiled a list. 'I Will Always Love You'. 'Hallelujah'. 'My Heart Will Go On'. Classics. Guaranteed tear-jerkers.\"\n\nShe looked at the list they pushed across the table. It felt like a karaoke menu. \"These are amazing songs,\" she said carefully, trying not to sound ungrateful. \"But... they're not really me. The reason the semi-final worked, I think, was because the song was real. It was part of me.\"\n\nClarissa held up a placating hand. \"We hear you, we do. But this is the final, Kaia. We need to appeal to the broadest possible demographic. Your song was beautiful, but it was in a different language. A lot of our viewers... well, they might not connect with it in the same way. A familiar melody, reinterpreted by your incredible voice? That's a winning formula.\"\n\nThe conversation went around in circles for another ten minutes, a polite but firm battle of wills. Kaia felt a growing sense of unease. They were trying to sand down her edges, to make her fit into a pre-made, BGT-winner-shaped hole. She eventually agreed to \"consider\" their suggestions, and escaped back into the corridor, her head spinning.\n\nLiam, her liaison, was waiting for her. He must have seen the look on her face. \"Don't you worry about them,\" he murmured, steering her towards the wardrobe department. \"They're just doing their job. You stick to your guns. Your gut's got you this far, right?\"\n\nKaia gave him a grateful smile. \"Yeah. I guess.\"\n\nThe rest of the day passed in a blur of fabric swatches, vocal scales, and questions from a perky TV crew about her 'journey'. It was exhausting, exhilarating, and deeply strange. By late afternoon, she was sitting in a communal green room, nursing a cup of tea, trying to process it all. The magician was showing a card trick to the dancers, who were making appropriately appreciative noises. It was a weird, temporary family, all of them bound by the same shared, surreal experience.\n\nOn a large television screen mounted to the wall, a promotional ad for the final was playing on a loop. It was a montage of the finalists' best moments. Her own face appeared, eyes closed, singing the first few bars of 'P\u014dkarekare Ana'. A thrill went through her, sharp and sweet. Then the screen cut to the magician, then the dancers. Then a face she hadn't seen yet today. A face she knew.\n\nHer stomach plunged. The tea in her hand trembled, sloshing over the rim of the cup. It couldn't be.\n\nThe announcer's voice, thick with gravitas, boomed over the images. \"...and, in a shock twist, the judges have chosen their Wildcard entry. The act they believe deserves a second chance at the grand prize... he's back! The boy with the golden voice... Julian Vance!\"\n\nOn the screen, Julian, with his perfectly coiffed blond hair and a smile that could sell snake oil to a snake, was belting out some generic pop song. His eyes were closed in a pantomime of deep feeling, one hand clutching the microphone stand. The judges were on their feet. The crowd was ecstatic.\n\nThe air left Kaia's lungs in a rush, as if she'd been punched. Julian Vance. Her arch-rival. Her nemesis. The ghost at the feast. He wasn't just in the final. He was the Wildcard. The chosen one. The one the judges had personally saved.\n\nTheir history wasn't just a casual competition rivalry. It was a nasty, tangled thing that went back three years to a summer music academy in Auckland. He was the city boy, entitled and arrogant, with a technical perfection that was chilling. She was the raw talent from the provinces. He'd seen her as a threat from day one. He'd \"accidentally\" spilled coffee on her sheet music minutes before a recital. He'd started a rumour that she'd cheated on a theory exam. But the worst, the thing she could never forgive, was the song. She'd written a song, a deeply personal piece about her grandfather's passing. She'd played it for a few friends in a common room, late one night. Julian had been lurking in the hallway. A week later, at the final showcase, he'd performed it. He'd claimed he'd written it himself, tweaking a few lyrics, changing the chords just enough to make it his. The tutors, unfamiliar with her original, had praised his 'emotional depth'. She'd been left speechless, violated. He had stolen a piece of her grief and paraded it for applause.\n\nAnd now he was here. Not just here, but anointed. The golden boy. A sickness rose in her throat. This wasn't a fair fight anymore. It was a narrative. The producers didn't just want a winner; they wanted a story. And what better story than the redemption of the handsome, charming young man, the one who got away, brought back for a second chance at glory? Compared to that, what was she? The quirky girl from New Zealand. A novelty. The authentic flavour of the week.\n\nOne of the dancers, a girl named Chloe, noticed her expression. \"You alright, love? You look like you've seen a ghost.\"\n\nKaia put her cup down, her hand shaking. \"Something like that,\" she whispered, her eyes still fixed on Julian's smug, smiling face on the screen. The infinite possibilities of the morning had collapsed into a single, ugly point. Him. The joy, so bright and blinding, had been snuffed out, replaced by a cold, heavy dread. Her chance, her one shining, impossible chance, was about to be scuppered. And he was the one holding the scissors.The green room door swung open, and the televised image of Julian Vance was replaced by the real thing. He strode in as if he owned the building, a walking, talking embodiment of expensive cologne and unearned confidence. The blond hair was even more artfully tousled in person, his smile even more predatory. He was dressed in a ridiculously tight t-shirt and designer jeans that probably cost more than Kaia\u2019s rent for the entire year. A few of the dancers let out audible squeals. He was a known quantity, a pre-packaged star. He basked in the attention for a moment before his eyes scanned the room, landing, inevitably, on her.\n\nA slow, deliberate smirk spread across his face. He began to walk towards her, a shark gliding through shallow water. The other finalists seemed to melt away, creating a clear path between them. Kaia\u2019s knuckles were white where she gripped the now-cold ceramic cup. Every instinct screamed at her to run, to throw the tea in his face, to disappear. But she was rooted to the spot, pinned by the weight of his gaze and three years of festering resentment.\n\n\u201cKaia Morehu. As I live and breathe,\u201d he said, his voice a smooth, practised baritone. He stopped in front of her, close enough that she could smell the mint on his breath. \u201cFancy seeing you here. From the open mics of Greymouth to the BGT final. Quite the leap. You\u2019ve come a long way.\u201d He said it like a compliment, but it landed like a slap. He was reminding her of her place, of the chasm that separated their worlds.\n\n\u201cJulian,\u201d she managed, her voice flat and devoid of any warmth. \u201cThey let you back in, then.\u201d\n\nHe chuckled, a sound that held no humour. \u201cThe judges\u2019 prerogative. They felt the competition was missing a certain\u2026 star quality. But hey, it\u2019s great that you\u2019re here too. Adds a bit of rustic charm. We should catch up, for old times\u2019 sake.\u201d He winked, a gesture of such profound insincerity it made her stomach churn. He was playing a part for the audience in the room, the friendly rival. He was daring her to call him out, knowing she wouldn\u2019t. Not here. Not now.\n\nBefore she had to formulate a response, Liam appeared at her elbow, a blessed interruption. \u201cKaia, we need to run you back to the hotel. Car\u2019s waiting.\u201d He shot a brief, professional nod at Julian. \u201cMr. Vance. Welcome back.\u201d Liam\u2019s tone was perfectly neutral, but Kaia caught a flicker of something in his eyes \u2013 a guardedness, a hint of sympathy for her. He had seen the whole exchange.\n\nShe stood, using the excuse to put space between herself and Julian. \u201cRight. Yeah, let\u2019s go.\u201d She didn\u2019t look back as Liam guided her out of the room, but she could feel Julian\u2019s eyes on her, a smug, triumphant pressure between her shoulder blades. The corridor felt long, the silence between her and Liam stretching until he finally spoke, his voice low.\n\n\u201cHeard he was a bit of a tosser,\u201d Liam said, not as a question but as a statement of fact. \u201cSaw him in the auditions. All flash, no heart. Don\u2019t let him get in your head, Kaia. He\u2019s one of ten. You\u2019re one of ten. It\u2019s a level playing field.\u201d\n\nKaia wanted to believe him, but she couldn\u2019t. \u201cIs it, though?\u201d she asked, her voice barely a whisper. \u201cHe\u2019s the Wildcard, Liam. The judges saved him. The producers are already planning his coronation. I heard one of them talking about his \u2018redemption arc\u2019. What\u2019s my arc? The quirky foreigner who gets a pat on the head before the real star takes the prize?\u201d The bitterness she\u2019d been swallowing all afternoon finally spilled out.\n\nLiam stopped and turned to face her, his kind eyes serious. \u201cYour arc is that you\u2019re the best singer in this competition. Your arc is that you made Simon Cowell feel an actual human emotion. That\u2019s a bigger miracle than him walking on water. Don\u2019t you forget that. Now, go home. Get your head straight. We start again tomorrow. And Kaia? Think about your song.\u201d\n\nBack in the cold silence of her flat, the earlier joy felt like a distant, phantom limb. The room was just a room again. The city outside was just a vast, roaring machine. She felt the full weight of the thousands of miles separating her from anyone who truly knew her. She scrolled through her contacts, her thumb hovering over her parents\u2019 number. What would she even say? *Hey Mum, Dad, great news, that guy who stole my song and broke my heart is now my main competition and everyone loves him.* She couldn\u2019t do it. She couldn\u2019t load her worries onto their happiness.\n\nInstead, her thumb found a different number. \u2018Nan\u2019. It was a long shot. Her grandmother was notoriously bad with her mobile, but the thought of hearing her voice was a lifeline Kaia desperately needed to grab. After several rings, a crackly voice answered. \u201cKaia? Is that my moko?\u201d\n\n\u201cHi, Nan,\u201d Kaia breathed, sinking onto the edge of her bed. \u201cSorry, is it a bad time?\u201d\n\n\u201cNever a bad time for you, my girl. I was just watching the kerer\u016b in the k\u014dwhai tree. Fat as mud, they are. Your Koro would\u2019ve said they\u2019re laughing at us.\u201d A wave of homesickness, so sharp and powerful it almost buckled her, washed over Kaia. She could see it all: the yellow blossoms of the k\u014dwhai, the fat, iridescent wood pigeons, her grandfather\u2019s smiling ghost beside the tree. \u201cYou sound tired, moko. Is this big city wearing you out?\u201d\n\n\u201cA bit,\u201d Kaia admitted. \u201cNan\u2026 I\u2019m in the final.\u201d\n\nThere was a sharp intake of breath, followed by a low, rumbling chuckle. \u201cOf course you are. I knew you would be. You have the gift. It is in your blood, in your bones. It is the voice of all of us, singing through you.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s hard, Nan. They want me to be someone I\u2019m not. To sing songs that aren\u2019t mine. And there\u2019s\u2026 there\u2019s someone else in the competition. Someone who hurt me a long time ago. He steals things. He stole a song from me once.\u201d\n\nHer Nan was silent for a moment. When she spoke again, her voice had lost its gentle, reedy quality and was replaced by something hard and ancient, like river stone. \u201cNo one can steal your voice, Kaia. They can steal the words. They can steal the tune. But they cannot steal the *wairua*, the spirit, that you put into it. That is yours alone. When you sing, you sing of our mountains and our sea. You sing of your Koro. You sing of us. Can he do that? This boy? Can he sing of our home?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Kaia whispered, tears welling.\n\n\u201cThen you have nothing to fear. Remember who you are, moko. You are a daughter of the West Coast. We are not people who bend in the wind. We are the stone the water breaks against. You sing your truth. You sing your heart. And let that be enough.\u201d\n\nThe line went dead a few moments later, her Nan declaring the battery was about to die. Kaia sat in the gathering dark, her grandmother\u2019s words echoing in the tiny room. *You are the stone the water breaks against.* Something shifted inside her. The dread didn\u2019t vanish, but it solidified. It morphed from a paralysing fog into a cold, hard stone of resolve in her gut. Liam was right. Her Nan was right. She had one weapon, and it was the only one that mattered: her truth.\n\nThe next morning, she walked into the studio with her guitar case in hand and a new light in her eyes. She found Liam and said the words that had been forming in her mind all night. \u201cI need a meeting with Clarissa. I\u2019ve chosen my song for the final.\u201d\n\nShe was ushered back into the plush office, the same producers sitting in the same chairs, Clarissa at the head of the table. The list of approved ballads was still sitting there. Clarissa smiled, a tight, business-like expression. \u201cKaia. Wonderful. I do hope you\u2019ve come around to our way of thinking. \u2018I Will Always Love You\u2019 with a string quartet would be a real moment.\u201d\n\nKaia placed her hands flat on the polished table. She met Clarissa\u2019s gaze and held it. \u201cI\u2019m not singing any of those,\u201d she said, her voice quiet but firm. \u201cI appreciate the suggestions, but they\u2019re not me. I\u2019m going to sing one of my own.\u201d\n\nThe smooth-foreheaded producer scoffed. \u201cAn original song? In the final? Kaia, that\u2019s commercial suicide. It\u2019s too risky. The audience needs familiarity.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m singing is a story,\u201d Kaia continued, her voice gaining strength, ignoring him and speaking directly to Clarissa. \u201cIt\u2019s the most personal thing I\u2019ve ever written. It\u2019s a song about grief, and about memory. And it\u2019s a song another finalist is going to recognise.\u201d\n\nClarissa\u2019s eyes narrowed. The professional mask slipped for a fraction of a second, revealing the shrewd producer beneath. She leaned forward. \u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m saying Julian Vance stole a song from me three years ago. A song I wrote about my grandfather\u2019s death. He performed it and claimed it as his own,\u201d Kaia said, the words hanging in the air, cold and heavy. \u201cFor the final, I\u2019m going to sing the real version. My version. The way it was always meant to be sung.\u201d\n\nA dead silence fell over the room. The producers looked at each other, then at Clarissa. This wasn't in their script. A cover ballad was a safe bet. A quirky foreign song was a risk. But this? This was a stick of dynamite. This was a narrative they couldn\u2019t control, a drama that was all too real.\n\nClarissa stared at Kaia, her expression unreadable. Kaia could see the calculations flashing behind her eyes. The risk of an unknown song versus the undeniable, explosive television drama of a live, on-air confrontation. A story of theft and reclamation. It was messy. It was dangerous. And it was utterly compelling.\n\nFinally, a slow smile, a genuine one this time, spread across Clarissa\u2019s face. It didn\u2019t reach her eyes. It was all teeth. \u201cWell, Kaia,\u201d she said, leaning back in her chair. \u201cNow that is a moment.\u201dThe energy in the office didn\u2019t just shift; it underwent a phase change, from solid corporate caution to a gaseous, electric excitement. The smooth-foreheaded producer, who had moments before dismissed her idea as commercial suicide, now leaned forward, his eyes gleaming. The other producer was already scribbling furiously on a notepad. They didn\u2019t see a grieving granddaughter anymore. They saw a story. They saw ratings. Clarissa, their queen, had given the signal, and now the pack was hungry. She held up a perfectly manicured hand, silencing the burgeoning chatter.\n\n\u201cForget the orchestra,\u201d Clarissa commanded, her voice crisp and decisive. \u201cForget the gospel choir. This is not a \u2018Hallelujah\u2019 moment. This is a pin-drop moment. It\u2019s you, the guitar, and a single spotlight. We strip everything away. The set is black. The audience disappears. It\u2019s a confession. It\u2019s a reckoning.\u201d She wasn\u2019t asking Kaia; she was directing a scene. She looked at Kaia, but she was seeing a camera shot, a television event that would have people talking for weeks. \u201cWe\u2019ll put him on before you. Let him do his big, flashy, empty number. Then\u2026 you.\u201d\n\nLeaving the office felt like surfacing from a deep dive. The air in the corridor was thin, and Kaia\u2019s ears were ringing. She had won. She had gotten permission to sing her song. But the victory tasted like ash in her mouth. She had wanted to reclaim her story, but in the process, she had handed it over to be scripted, packaged, and sold. Clarissa\u2019s talk of \u201creckoning\u201d and \u201cconfession\u201d turned her sacred memory into a tawdry spectacle. She wasn\u2019t honouring her grandfather anymore; she was weaponizing him. The thought made her feel sick. The righteousness that had propelled her into that office had curdled into a cold, heavy shame. She had invited the world into her most private grief, and the world had responded by asking for a better camera angle.\n\nThe machine whirred into motion with terrifying speed. Liam found her by the vending machines, his expression a mixture of awe and profound pity. \u201cThey\u2019re going into overdrive,\u201d he said, his voice low. \u201cThe storyboards are already being drawn up. They\u2019re calling it \u2018The Reclamation\u2019.\u201d A brand. They had branded her pain. Before she could process this, the VT crew appeared, led by the same perky producer from the day before. This time, her smile was gone, replaced by a look of journalistic solemnity. \u201cKaia, we need to sit down with you. We want you to tell us everything. Start from the beginning. Tell us about your Koro. What was he like? And tell us about the academy. The moment you realised Julian had\u2026 taken it.\u201d The camera\u2019s red light blinked on, an unfeeling eye demanding its pound of emotional flesh.\n\nHer first rehearsal on the main stage was an exercise in quiet torture. The vast, empty auditorium felt less like a venue and more like an interrogation chamber. As Clarissa had decreed, it was just a single stool, a microphone stand, and a cone of white light cutting through an ocean of black. The director\u2019s voice, disembodied and godlike, echoed from the control booth. \u201cOkay, Kaia, from the top. And on the line about his hands, can you look up, just past camera two? Like you\u2019re seeing a ghost. Let\u2019s try that.\u201d She tried to sing, to find the melody that lived in her bones, the one that smelled of hospital corridors and her grandfather\u2019s woollen jersey. But the words wouldn\u2019t come out right. They felt staged, hollow. They were choreographing her heartbreak, and the wairua, the spirit of the song, was retreating, hiding from the glare of the lights.\n\nJulian, meanwhile, was not oblivious. The tectonic plates of the production had shifted beneath his feet, and he was sliding from the centre. He saw the hushed conversations, the way the crew\u2019s attention now followed Kaia like a compass needle pointing north. He saw her emerge from long meetings with Clarissa, her face pale but set. The fawning had stopped. He was no longer the chosen one; he was just another finalist, and a deep, paranoid suspicion began to fester behind his confident facade. He cornered her by the catering table, his body blocking her exit. The friendly rival mask was gone, his face tight with anger. \u201cWhat did you say to them?\u201d he hissed, his voice a venomous whisper. \u201cWhat lies have you been telling?\u201d Kaia looked at him, at his handsome, furious face, and for the first time, she felt nothing. No fear, no anger, just a vast, weary emptiness. She thought of her Nan\u2019s words: *Can he sing of our home?* She said nothing, simply picked up a bottle of water and walked around him. His impotent fury was a bigger victory than any argument she could have won.\n\nThat night, she couldn\u2019t bear the thought of calling her parents. She couldn\u2019t lie to them, and she couldn\u2019t tell them the truth \u2013 that their daughter\u2019s tribute to their father was about to become the grist for a reality TV mill. Instead, she sat on her lumpy bed and pulled her guitar into her lap. She didn\u2019t try to rehearse. She just played. She played old chords her dad had taught her. She played the melody from a lullaby her mum used to sing. She let her fingers find their way back to the song for her Koro, not the choreographed version for the cameras, but the real one. The one she\u2019d written in the dead of night, her cheeks wet with tears, in a quiet room half a world away. She played it for herself. For him. A quiet act of defiance against the machine that sought to own it. It was a prayer in the pre-dawn gloom of her London flatshare, a reclamation of her own.\n\nThe final days were a blur of managed tension. The air in the studios was thick with unspoken things. The other finalists, sensing the high-voltage current between Kaia and Julian, kept their distance, forming a neutral zone between the two opposing camps. Julian grew more sullen and isolated, rehearsing his bombastic pop number with a desperate intensity, while Kaia spent her time in quiet rooms with her vocal coach, a gentle woman who seemed to understand. \u201cForget them, love,\u201d she\u2019d say. \u201cJust find the truth in it. Sing it for the person it was meant for.\u201d It became Kaia\u2019s mantra. In press interviews, she was polite but evasive when journalists, sniffing a story, asked about the \u201crumoured history\u201d with Mr. Vance. In wardrobe, she calmly refused the virginal white dress they offered, opting instead for simple black jeans and a dark green silk shirt, the colour of pounamu, of the deep, wet ferns of the West Coast. She was building her armour, piece by piece.\n\nThen, it was the night. The final. Backstage was a hurricane of hairspray, sequins, and frantic energy. Dancers stretched in corridors, a magician practiced a coin vanish with shaking hands, and the family of string players tuned their instruments with grim determination. Kaia was in her small, stark dressing room, the sounds of the roaring crowd a distant sea. Her guitar lay across her lap, its polished wood warm and solid. It felt like the only real thing in the world. A sharp knock on the door made her jump. It was Liam, his face pale under the fluorescent lights. \u201cFive minutes, Kaia,\u201d he said, his voice tight with nerves. \u201cYou\u2019re on after Julian.\u201d Of course she was. The final, perfect, producer-approved twist of the knife. She would have to listen to his triumphant, stolen noise, and then walk out into the echo of it. She nodded, her throat too dry to speak. He gave her a small, supportive nod. \u201cBreak a leg. No, wait. Just\u2026 sing it for you.\u201d The door clicked shut, leaving her alone once more. She closed her eyes, took a long, shuddering breath, and tried to block out the roar of the crowd, the frantic energy, the face of Julian Vance. Instead, she pictured a small kitchen table. She pictured her Nan\u2019s hands, wrinkled and strong, wrapped around a mug of tea. She heard her voice, reedy and clear. *You are the stone the water breaks against.* The stage manager\u2019s voice crackled over the intercom. \u201cJulian Vance to the stage. Stand by, Kaia.\u201d The water was coming.Through the thin walls of her dressing room, the opening bars of Julian\u2019s song erupted. It wasn\u2019t music so much as an assault; a wall of synthesized strings, a bombastic drum machine beat, and a bass line that vibrated up through the soles of Kaia\u2019s feet, shaking the very foundations of her resolve. Then came his voice, technically flawless, soaring through predictable vocal acrobatics with polished precision. He hit a glory note, and the crowd roared its approval, a beast waking in the arena next door. Kaia flinched, the sound a physical blow. This was what they wanted. This was the winning formula: loud, familiar, and utterly devoid of a soul. A cold spike of pure panic shot through her, and she felt the desperate, primal urge to be anywhere else on earth.\n\nShe squeezed her eyes shut, her knuckles white on the neck of her guitar. *Breathe, K. Just breathe.* She forced the air into her lungs, holding it, then letting it out in a slow, shuddering sigh. She didn\u2019t picture the stage or the judges. She pictured the West Coast, the sky a moody grey, the smell of coal smoke and wet ferns. She pictured the way the rain came down in relentless, cleansing sheets, washing the whole world clean. *You are the stone the water breaks against.* Her Nan\u2019s voice, a calm anchor in the hurricane of noise from the stage. The stage manager\u2019s voice, tinny and urgent, cut through her thoughts. \u201cKaia, to the wing. Let\u2019s go.\u201d She stood, her legs feeling like hollow reeds. The guitar was heavy in her hands, a familiar, solid weight. As she stepped into the dimly lit corridor, she passed Liam. He didn\u2019t say a word, just met her eyes and gave a single, firm nod. It was enough.\n\nThe corridor leading to the stage was a tunnel of darkness, at the end of which pulsed the bright, terrifying world of the show. Julian\u2019s song reached its crescendo, a final, ridiculously long note held for maximum effect. The applause that followed was a physical shockwave, a roar of pure ecstasy that shook the air. A moment later, he strode off the stage and into the wing, his face drenched in sweat and flushed with arrogant triumph. He was high on the applause, his eyes wild. He saw her waiting, her small, dark figure dwarfed by the rigging and the chaos. A dismissive, triumphant smirk crossed his lips. It was a look that said, *Follow that.* A look that said, *You\u2019ve already lost.* And in that moment, something inside Kaia finally clicked into place. The fear didn't vanish, but the shame did. The shame of being manipulated, of her grief being used as a plot point. It burned away, leaving behind a cold, clear, diamond-hard resolve. He hadn't just stolen her song. He had underestimated her.\n\nShe walked out of the darkness and into the light. It was a physical assault, a supernova of white and blue that bleached the world of all colour. The noise was even bigger out here, a shapeless, roaring entity that threatened to swallow her whole. In the far distance, the judges\u2019 desk was a glittering oasis, the four of them just silhouettes against the glare. She didn't look at them. She didn't look at the screaming, waving crowd. She fixed her eyes on the single wooden stool waiting for her in the vast, empty blackness of the stage floor. It felt a hundred miles away. She walked towards it, each step deliberate, her guitar held tight against her chest like a shield. The roar of the crowd began to falter, confused by her silence, by her plain dark clothes, by the utter lack of spectacle. A low murmur of anticipation rippled through the auditorium. She reached the stool, sat, and adjusted the microphone. Her heart was a frantic drum against her ribs. She was terrifyingly, completely alone.\n\nShe took a breath. Then another. She let the silence stretch, a defiant act against the show\u2019s relentless pace. She looked down at the familiar grain of her guitar\u2019s wood, at her own hands resting on the strings. She wasn\u2019t a reality show contestant. She wasn\u2019t \u2018The Reclamation\u2019. She was Kaia Morehu from Greymouth. She was Deb and Brian\u2019s daughter. She was her Koro\u2019s moko. Her fingers, no longer trembling, found the first chord, a simple, questioning minor. She looked up, not into the camera, not into the crowd, but into the middle distance of the darkness, into memory. Her voice, when it came, was barely a whisper, so quiet that the entire theatre seemed to lean in to catch it. \u201cKoro, do you remember? Your hands were a road map, all river-lines and hills\u2026\u201d\n\nThe song began to unfold, not as a performance, but as a whispered story. She sang of small, specific things that could not be faked. She sang of the smell of his shed, a mix of sawdust and old oil. She sang of the way he tapped his pipe out on the heel of his boot. Her voice was fragile, threaded with an ache that was utterly real, yet it was clear and true. She felt a wobble, a moment where the sheer emotion of it threatened to choke her, where the reality of what she was doing \u2013 baring this wound in front of millions \u2013 almost broke her. But she closed her eyes again, and she wasn't on the stage. She was in the sterile, quiet hospital room, holding a hand that was growing cold. She was making a promise.\n\nHer voice found its strength, not in volume, but in certainty. The wairua flooded back, a warm tide against the coldness of her nerves. She reached the chorus, the melody that Julian had stolen and twisted into a power-pop hook. But as she sang it, it was transformed. It was a lament. \u201cYou said to take this memory, hold it like a stone,\u201d she sang, her voice rising, infused with a fierce, protective sorrow. \u201cAnd its weight would keep me grounded, when I felt alone.\u201d She looked directly into the lens of the main camera, her gaze unflinching. She wasn't just singing to the audience; she was speaking directly to him, wherever he was watching. She sang the lines he had corrupted, about grief being a song only she could hear, and in her voice was the clear, ringing truth of ownership. This was her pain. This was her story. He was just a thief who had tried to pawn a diamond he thought was glass.\n\nThe final verse was a farewell. Her voice soared, not with the strained power of a manufactured finale, but with the pure, unadorned power of love. It was a cry that echoed with generations of loss and remembrance, a sound that transcended the cheap theatrics of the show and became something elemental, something sacred. It filled every corner of the vast space, wrapping the audience in its profound sadness. Then, as quickly as it had swelled, her voice retreated, pulling back to a near-whisper for the final line, a quiet promise in te reo M\u0101ori. \u201cE kore e warewaretia.\u201d *You will not be forgotten.* She strummed one last, soft chord, letting the note hang in the air, her hand hovering over the strings until the sound decayed into absolute, perfect silence.\n\nThe silence was a living thing. It was heavier and more complete than any sound. It was a held breath, a shared moment of stunned reverence that bound every single person in the auditorium. No one coughed. No one cheered. No one moved. The silence stretched for one second, then two, then five. In the wing, Julian Vance\u2019s face was a mask of disbelief, the triumphant flush drained away, leaving a pasty, sickly white. He understood. In that one song, she had exposed him, judged him, and dismissed him more completely than any accusation could have done. She had taken back her truth, and in doing so, had revealed his emptiness to the world.\n\nThen, from the upper balcony, a single person began to clap. It was a slow, solitary sound. Then another joined, and another. It wasn't the explosive roar Julian had received. It was a wave of sound that started as a ripple and grew into a tidal wave of sustained, heartfelt applause. It was a sound of gratitude, of release, of respect. Kaia opened her eyes, tears blurring the lights. The whole room was on its feet. Amanda Holden was no longer just crying; she was sobbing, her face buried in her hands. David Walliams was staring at Kaia with open-mouthed awe. And Simon, the emperor of stone-faced disapproval, was sitting perfectly still, his face a mask of something Kaia had never seen on him before. It wasn't just being moved. It was respect. It was utter, unequivocal surrender. She had done it. She had sung for her Koro. And everyone had heard.The wave of applause finally began to recede, not disappearing but softening into a warm, humming sea of sound. A man in a headset gave her a frantic thumbs-up from the wings, and the show\u2019s hosts, a duo of relentlessly cheerful men in sharp suits, walked towards her from the other side of the stage. One of them placed a gentle hand on her shoulder, a gesture that felt both grounding and surreal. Her entire body was trembling, a fine, high-frequency vibration of adrenaline and release.\n\n\u201cKaia Morehu, everybody!\u201d one of the hosts announced, his voice booming with manufactured bonhomie that for once felt entirely genuine. \u201cWow. Just\u2026 wow. Let\u2019s go to the judges. Amanda, you look like you need a moment.\u201d\n\nAll eyes swung to the judges\u2019 desk. Amanda Holden was dabbing at her mascara with a tissue, her face a beautiful wreck of emotion. She shook her head, taking a shaky breath. \u201cKaia, that wasn\u2019t a song. That was\u2026 that was a testimony. I think every single person in this room, in this country, who has ever lost someone felt that with you. It was so raw, and so brave, and so utterly, breathtakingly beautiful. You took all your pain and you turned it into something\u2026 healing. For all of us. Just incredible.\u201d\n\nKaia could only manage a choked, \u201cThank you,\u201d her own tears finally spilling over. The fourth judge, a flamboyant choreographer known for his effusive praise, was uncharacteristically subdued. He simply pressed his hands together as if in prayer and bowed his head slightly. \u201cArtistry,\u201d he said, his voice thick. \u201cPure, unadulterated artistry. In a competition full of fireworks, you were a solitary, perfect flame. And you lit up the entire room.\u201d\n\nThen it was Simon\u2019s turn. The cameras zoomed in on his face, the audience falling into a hushed, expectant silence. He hadn\u2019t moved. He was staring at her, his expression unreadable, his hands steepled under his chin. He let the silence hang for a beat, a master of television tension. \u201cWe see a lot of people on this stage,\u201d he began, his voice low and measured, devoid of its usual caustic bite. \u201cWe see ambition. We see desperation. We see a lot of very loud performers who are screaming to be noticed. And then, very, very rarely\u2026 someone comes on and has the courage to be quiet. Someone comes on and tells the truth.\u201d He paused, his eyes sweeping across the audience before locking back onto her. \u201cWhat you just did\u2026 it went beyond a competition. You reminded me, and I think everyone here, what music is actually for. It\u2019s not for fame, it\u2019s not for the prize money. It\u2019s for this. To communicate something real. You are, without question, the most authentic artist we have ever had on this stage.\u201d He leaned back, giving a single, decisive nod. \u201cAnd I hope you win.\u201d\n\nIt was the ultimate benediction. A roar went up from the crowd, a sound of absolute agreement. It felt like a coronation. One of the hosts squeezed her shoulder again. \u201cKaia Morehu. The phone lines are open. Go on, love. Go and get a cup of tea.\u201d He guided her off the stage, and as she stepped back into the shadows of the wing, the immense weight she had been carrying for the entire week, for three long years, simply lifted. Her legs gave a little buckle, and Liam was there, his arms catching her in a firm, steadying hug. \u201cYou did it,\u201d he whispered into her hair, his own voice thick with emotion. \u201cYou bloody well did it.\u201d\n\nShe was guided back towards the green room in a daze. The other finalists who were gathered in the corridor parted for her like she was royalty, their faces a mixture of awe and respect. The group of Manchester dancers all gave her solemn, heartfelt thumbs-ups. The magician, who had been nervously shuffling his cards, stopped and simply nodded at her, a look of profound understanding in his eyes. He dealt in illusion, and he knew a moment of pure truth when he saw it. From the corner of her eye, she saw Clarissa on her headset, her back to the wall. She wasn\u2019t looking at Kaia. She was looking at a monitor showing the live vote tally, and the smile on her face was one of pure, predatory triumph. Her gamble had paid off. The dynamite had gone off exactly as she\u2019d planned.\n\nBack in the cacophony of the green room, the atmosphere was electric. The television on the wall was playing a montage of the night\u2019s performances. When Julian\u2019s segment came on, his flashy stage presence, his perfect but hollow vocals, it looked like a caricature. After the raw intimacy of Kaia\u2019s song, his performance seemed loud, gaudy, and desperately empty. A few of the other contestants glanced around, a silent, shared acknowledgement of the contrast. Then her performance was replayed. The room fell quiet. On the screen, the small figure in the dark green shirt looked impossibly vulnerable and impossibly strong. The quiet notes of her guitar cut through the noise of the studio. No one spoke. In that moment, they weren't competitors; they were all just witnesses. Julian Vance was nowhere to be seen. He had not returned to the green room. His absence was a confession in itself.\n\nThe long, agonizing wait for the vote to close began. Kaia sat on a sofa between Chloe, the dancer, and the kind-faced magician, a mug of sweet, milky tea warming her hands. She finally dared to look at her phone. It was unusable, a frantic, vibrating brick of notifications. Texts from friends she hadn't spoken to in years. Hundreds of social media alerts. A missed call from \u2018Mum and Dad\u2019. A wave of love and longing washed over her. The outcome of the vote suddenly felt like a footnote. She had walked through the fire and come out the other side. She had sung her song, for her Koro, and she had done it on her own terms. The rest was just noise. She put the phone down, took a sip of her tea, and for the first time in a week, she felt a sense of peace settle deep in her bones.\n\n\u201cAll finalists to the stage! Results are in! Two minutes!\u201d The stage manager\u2019s voice cut through the nervous chatter. The moment was here. The final ten acts filed out of the green room and lined up across the back of the enormous stage. The lights were hot, the roar of the crowd was deafening, but the terror was gone. Kaia found herself standing next to Chloe again, and they instinctively held hands, their fingers laced together in a pact of mutual support. The hosts stood centre stage, holding the sacred envelope. \u201cThe votes have been counted and verified,\u201d one of them announced, his voice ringing with theatrical gravity. \u201cI can now reveal the act finishing in third place is\u2026 The Morrison Family Strings!\u201d A round of applause, a few gracious smiles and disappointed tears, and the family of musicians took their bow.\n\nIt was down to two. The hosts milked the moment, striding back and forth, recapping the journey of the final acts. The cameras cut between Kaia\u2019s pale, composed face and the hopeful, nervous faces of the Manchester dance troupe. The entire auditorium was on its feet, a sea of flickering phone screens and chanting fans. \u201cIt\u2019s time,\u201d the host said, finally opening the envelope. \u201cThe winner of Britain\u2019s Got Talent 2023\u2026 the act you have chosen\u2026 is\u2026\u201d He paused, his eyes scanning the slip of paper. The world seemed to stop. The roar of the crowd, the thumping music, her own frantic heartbeat\u2014it all faded into a distant hum. She felt Chloe squeeze her hand, hard.\n\n\u201c...Kaia Morehu!\u201d\n\nThe name echoed in the vast space, and for a second, it didn't register. It was just a sound. Then Chloe let out a shriek of joy and threw her arms around her. The stage erupted in a shower of gold confetti and soaring music. The dancers were hugging her, the hosts were patting her back, and the sound of the crowd was a physical force, a wall of pure joy pressing in on her from all sides. She saw Simon on his feet, clapping, a genuine, unrestrained smile on his face. She saw Liam in the wings, openly weeping with pride. She saw her own face on the giant screen behind the stage, streaked with tears and covered in glittering gold paper, a look of pure, uncomprehending shock staring back at her. Her. Kaia Morehu from Greymouth. The girl with the second-hand guitar and a song about her grandfather. It was insane. It was impossible. It was happening.The moment the name left the host's lips, Kaia\u2019s world dissolved into a blizzard of gold foil and sound. The air, once electric with tension, was now thick with celebration, the confetti sticking to her tear-damp cheeks and catching in her dark hair. Chloe and the rest of the dance troupe enveloped her in a joyous, multi-limbed hug, their collective excitement lifting her off her feet. The music swelled, a triumphant orchestral piece that felt ridiculously grand, a soundtrack for a life she didn\u2019t recognise as her own. The hosts thrust a heavy glass trophy into her hands, its sharp edges cool and solid against her trembling fingers. It was the only thing that felt real. Her mind was a static-filled television screen, unable to process the sheer volume of input. Winner. The word was too big, too bright. It refused to fit into the small, carefully constructed reality of her life.\n\n\u201cOne more time for your winner, Kaia Morehu!\u201d one of the hosts bellowed into his microphone, his voice echoing through the ecstatic arena. A stagehand, his face beaming, quickly placed her guitar back in her hands, its familiar weight a profound comfort. They guided her back to the stool, which was now covered in a fine layer of gold dust, a tiny throne in the centre of the universe. The lights dimmed once more, the crowd noise softening to a reverent, expectant hum. She was supposed to sing again. How could she? The song had been a vessel for so much pain, anger, and defiance. It had been her shield and her sword. But now, looking out at the sea of faces, at the thousands of tiny lights from their phones held aloft like modern-day candles, she understood. It wasn't just her song anymore. It belonged to them now, to everyone who had listened and understood.\n\nWhen she played the first chord this time, it felt different. It was no longer a question, but an answer. Her voice, when it came, was no longer a whisper of private grief but a quiet anthem of public remembrance. She sang with a new sense of peace, her voice soaring not in defiance, but in celebration of a life, a memory, and a love that had, against all odds, connected her to millions. This time, when she reached the final, whispered line in te reo M\u0101ori, her voice didn't waver. It was strong, clear, and full of a love that was no longer sharp with loss, but burnished with gratitude. This time, when she finished, she wasn't alone in her tears. The whole room felt like a vigil, a beautiful, shared moment of catharsis under the television lights.\n\nThe moment she stepped off stage, the true chaos began. It was a human tidal wave. Press officers, photographers, producers, and well-wishers surged towards her. Flashes popped, momentarily blinding her. Microphones were thrust in her face, their foam covers smelling of stale breath, the questions fired at her like pellets. \"How does it feel?\" \"What will you do with the money?\" \"A message for your fans back home?\" She mumbled answers, her brain still buffering, the words feeling clumsy and inadequate. Clarissa appeared out of the throng, her sharp blazer immaculate amidst the joyous chaos. She didn't hug Kaia; she grasped her firmly by the shoulders, her eyes blazing with an intensity that was almost frightening. \"You did it,\" she said, her voice a low, thrilling hiss. \"You magnificent girl, you actually did it. We have a star.\" It wasn't a congratulations; it was a confirmation of a successful product launch. Liam rescued her again, forming a protective barrier and steering her through the labyrinthine corridors towards the relative sanctity of her dressing room, fending off the swarming press with a polite but firm, \"She needs a moment, folks. Give her five minutes.\"\n\nInside the small, stark room, the trophy sat glinting on the makeup counter next to her discarded teacup. Her phone lay on the table, still vibrating itself into a furious spasm. It was the first thing she reached for. Ignoring the hundreds of notifications from social media, she scrolled to \u2018Mum and Dad\u2019 and hit the call button, her heart thudding a new, wild rhythm against her ribs. It was the middle of the morning in Greymouth. They would know. They must have been watching. The phone was answered on the first ring, the sound so immediate it made her jump. It wasn't a hello. It was a roar. Her dad\u2019s voice, so full of pure, unadulterated joy it was practically incoherent. \"SHE DID IT! DEB, SHE DID IT! YOU LITTLE RIPPER! YOU DID IT!\" Kaia burst into a fresh wave of tears, but this time they were tears of laughter, of pure, unbottled happiness. \"Dad!\" she gasped, laughing and crying at the same time. \"Mum? Are you there?\" \"We're here, darling!\" her mum's voice came on the line, cracking with emotion. \"Oh, Kaia. We're so proud, so unbelievably proud. The whole street is here! Your Uncle Barry is setting off fireworks in the garden, I think he's going to set fire to the feijoa hedge! Oh, darling, you were just\u2026 you were perfect.\" She could hear the party in the background \u2013 cheers, whistles, her dad yelling \"That's my girl!\" to anyone who would listen. The sound, fuzzy and distant and chaotic, was the most beautiful thing she had ever heard. It was the sound of home, celebrating.\n\nHours later, she was finally alone. Not in her cold little flatshare, which already felt like a relic from another lifetime, but in the back of a black car with tinted windows, speeding through the deserted streets of late-night London. Liam had arranged a room for her in a quiet hotel, a temporary haven from the storm that was now her life. The city lights blurred into long streaks of colour as they passed. The heavy glass trophy sat on the seat beside her, a silent, glittering passenger. She touched its smooth surface, tracing the engraved letters of her name. Kaia Morehu. It was real. The prize money, a quarter of a million pounds, was a number so large it was abstract, meaningless. The record deal with Simon Cowell's label, the performance at the Royal Variety Show \u2013 they were just words, concepts her exhausted mind couldn't yet grasp. She leaned her head against the cool glass of the window, watching the sleeping city slide by. She had come here with a beat-up guitar, a student visa, and a quiet, persistent ache of homesickness. She had sung her truth into the void, and the void had sung back. The future, which had once seemed like a narrow, uncertain path, was now a vast, uncharted ocean, stretching out before her under a sky full of stars. For the first time, she wasn't afraid of drowning. She was ready to set sail.She woke to silence. Not the thin, porous silence of her flatshare, which was always filled with the ghosts of sound \u2013 a neighbour\u2019s muffled television, the groaning pipes, the distant wail of a siren \u2013 but a deep, absolute, soundproofed silence. For a single, blissful second, her mind was a blank slate. She was just Kaia, in a bed, somewhere in London. Then, she turned her head. On the polished mahogany of the bedside table, bathed in a sliver of morning light filtering through a gap in the heavy blackout curtains, sat the trophy. It wasn't a dream. Her breath hitched. The entire night came rushing back not as a memory, but as a full-body sensation: the blinding lights, the golden confetti raining down, the bone-shaking roar of the crowd, the impossible weight of the glass trophy in her hands. She was the winner of Britain\u2019s Got Talent.\n\nA hysterical little laugh bubbled up from her chest. She sat up, clutching the impossibly soft, high-thread-count duvet to her chin, and looked around. The hotel room was bigger than her entire flat. It was a landscape of tasteful neutrals: cream carpets, mushroom-coloured walls, a minimalist armchair in the corner. A floor-to-ceiling window overlooked a panoramic view of the waking city. It was beautiful, luxurious, and felt about as personal as a page in an architectural magazine. It was a world away from the peeling poster of the T\u016b\u012b and the precarious stack of textbooks that had been the backdrop to her life only yesterday. She felt like an imposter, a child playing dress-up in her mother's expensive clothes. The buzzing of her phone on the nightstand brought her crashing back to the present. It was Liam.\n\n\u201cMorning, superstar,\u201d his voice was cheerful, but sounded as tired as she felt. \u201cSleep at all?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d Kaia answered honestly, her voice thick. \u201cI think I might have just passed out for a few hours. Is it\u2026 is it real, Liam?\u201d\n\nHe chuckled, a warm, reassuring sound. \u201cIt\u2019s real, Kaia. Take a look at any news website in the world right now. You\u2019re on all of them. Listen, the car will be there to pick you up in ninety minutes. We\u2019ve got the big one first: the \u2018This Morning\u2019 show. Then a string of radio interviews, a photoshoot for the paper, and a preliminary meeting at the label with Simon\u2019s people at four. It\u2019s going to be a full-on day, but we\u2019ll get through it. How are you feeling, honestly?\u201d\n\n\u201cLike I\u2019ve been struck by lightning,\u201d she whispered, her eyes wide as she took in the schedule. \u201cLiam, what do I even say on a morning show?\u201d\n\n\u201cJust be you. That\u2019s what they all fell in love with,\u201d he said kindly. \u201cI\u2019ll be there, right by the side of the set. Just look for me if you get lost. I\u2019ll meet you in the lobby. And Kaia? You earned this.\u201d\n\nAfter she hung up, a morbid curiosity got the better of her. She picked up the sleek hotel tablet and opened a news browser. Liam wasn't exaggerating. Her face was everywhere. A rain-soaked, confetti-dusted photo of her crying with joy was the lead image on the BBC News homepage. \u2018Kiwi Songbird Wins Nation\u2019s Heart\u2019 screamed one headline. \u2018From Obscurity to Overnight Sensation: The Kaia Morehu Story\u2019 declared another. She scrolled through the articles, a dizzying collage of praise, speculation, and hastily compiled biographical details. They mentioned Greymouth, her parents, her semi-final performance of \u2018P\u014dkarekare Ana\u2019. Then she found what she was subconsciously looking for. A smaller, secondary article in one of the tabloids. \u2018What Happened to Julian Vance? Golden Boy Disappears After Shock Final Defeat\u2019. The piece detailed his \"uncharacteristically flat\" final performance and his \"hasty exit\" from the studios, noting he had been uncontactable since the result. There was no mention of the song theft, no hint of the real story, but the narrative was clear even in its absence. She had been David, and he had been Goliath. The world didn't know the specifics, but it had sensed the truth.\n\nJust as she was processing the strange, hollow victory of seeing his public downfall, her phone rang again. The screen flashed with a number she didn\u2019t recognise, but she knew instinctively who it was. She took a deep breath and answered. \u201cHello?\u201d\n\n\u201cKaia, it\u2019s Clarissa. Congratulations on a spectacular result. The numbers are astronomical. You\u2019ve broken records.\u201d There was no warmth, no pleasantry. This was business. Clarissa was no longer a producer; she was a general surveying her victory. \u201cI\u2019ve spoken to the team at \u2018This Morning\u2019. They\u2019re running your win as their lead story. They\u2019re dedicating a whole segment to you. We need to prep. They want the whole story. Your grandfather. The academy. The moment you heard Julian sing your song. The decision to reclaim it in the final. We need to hit every beat. It\u2019s the narrative that sold you, Kaia. We need to lock it down.\u201d\n\nKaia\u2019s blood ran cold. The beautiful, private act of remembrance she had shared last night was now being referred to as a series of \u2018beats\u2019 in a \u2018narrative\u2019. It was a script to be performed on cue. \u201cClarissa,\u201d she began, choosing her words carefully. \u201cI\u2026 I sang the song. The story is in the song. I don\u2019t know if I can just\u2026 talk about it. Not like that. Not on a morning chat show.\u201d\n\nA beat of icy silence on the other end of the line. \u201cKaia,\u201d Clarissa said, her voice dropping, losing its clipped efficiency and gaining a sharp, dangerous edge. \u201cYour authenticity is your brand. That story is now your biggest asset. People don\u2019t just buy the music; they buy the story behind it. This is your one shot to cement that story in the public consciousness. We need to strike while the iron is hot. Tears are not a problem. In fact, they\u2019re a bonus. Be authentic. Be vulnerable. Be the girl who won.\u201d\n\nThe call ended with Clarissa giving her a list of talking points, each one feeling like a small betrayal of her Koro\u2019s memory. Kaia sank back onto the huge, impersonal bed, the luxurious sheets suddenly feeling like a silken trap. The joy of the win was already being tainted, packaged, and commodified. She thought of her tiny room in the flatshare, of the instant noodles she\u2019d been eating just two days ago. There was a room service menu on the desk, offering truffle-infused eggs and artisanal avocado toast. Her stomach churned. She didn't want any of it. She wanted the simple, uncomplicated reality of her old life, a life where her grief was her own, not a marketing tool. The future that had seemed like a vast ocean last night now looked like a series of treacherous, narrow channels, with pirates like Clarissa waiting at every turn. In ninety minutes, she would be back in the machine. She took a deep, shuddering breath. This was the first test. She won the competition by staying true to herself. The real fight, she was beginning to realise, was just beginning.The ninety minutes evaporated in a flurry of alien activity. A woman with a kind face and a rack of designer clothes appeared at her door, sent by the label to ensure she was \u2018camera-ready\u2019. Kaia, who usually defined \u2018ready\u2019 as clean jeans and a brushed ponytail, found herself being gently steered into a chair while another woman applied foundation to her face with a soft brush. She felt like a doll being prepped for display. She politely refused the suggested silk blouse and tailored trousers, opting instead for her own dark jeans, comfortable boots, and the pounamu-green shirt she had won in. It was her armour, and she wasn't ready to take it off. As she was whisked through the hotel lobby, a small crowd of guests and staff applauded, some holding up their phones to take pictures. It was a strange, disorienting experience, like walking through someone else\u2019s dream.\n\nLiam was waiting by the gleaming black car, his familiar, kind face a welcome anchor in the swirling sea of newness. He opened the door for her, and she slid into the cool leather interior. As they pulled away from the kerb and into the flow of London traffic, he glanced at her in the rear-view mirror. He didn\u2019t need to be a mind reader to see the tension etched around her eyes. \u201cClarissa call you?\u201d he asked quietly, his gaze flicking back to the road. Kaia just nodded, her throat tight. \u201cLet me guess,\u201d he continued, his tone wry. \u201cShe wanted you to hit the \u2018narrative beats\u2019. Cry on cue. Give them the soundbites.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe called my grief an asset,\u201d Kaia said, the words tasting foul. \u201cShe wants me to sell it, Liam. She wants me to turn my Koro into a sob story for morning television.\u201d She looked out the window, at the blur of red buses and historic buildings. The city seemed indifferent to her turmoil, a vast machine grinding on regardless.\n\nLiam was silent for a block, navigating a tricky turn. \u201cKaia,\u201d he said finally, his voice serious. \u201cYou\u2019re going to meet a lot of people like Clarissa. They see artists as products, and stories as marketing angles. They\u2019re not all bad people; they\u2019re just playing a different game. But you don\u2019t have to play it their way. They\u2019ll push, and they\u2019ll demand, but at the end of the day, you are the one on that sofa. You are the one with the microphone. They can\u2019t put words in your mouth.\u201d He paused, catching her eye in the mirror again. \u201cAnswer the question you want to answer, not the one they ask. You have more power than you think.\u201d\n\nHis words didn\u2019t magically solve the problem, but they planted a seed of resolve. He was right. She wasn\u2019t a puppet. The studio that housed \u2018This Morning\u2019 was besieged. A throng of paparazzi and fans pressed against metal barriers, a roaring, clamouring wall of sound and flashing lights. The car slowed, and for a terrifying moment, Kaia was the sole focus of a hundred lenses, the flashes popping like miniature starbursts. Liam put a protective hand on her arm as a security guard opened the door, and they were hustled inside, the noise of the crowd abruptly cut off as the heavy studio doors swung shut behind them. The contrast was jarring. The outside world was chaos; inside, it was a brightly lit, air-conditioned maze of corridors, bustling with people in headsets moving with urgent, practiced efficiency.\n\nThe green room was an oasis of calm, furnished with plush sofas and a table laden with pastries and fresh fruit. The show\u2019s hosts, a famously charming husband-and-wife duo, greeted her with warm hugs and genuine congratulations. They were exactly as they appeared on television: polished, professional, and radiating an effortless warmth that immediately put her at ease. But her momentary comfort evaporated when Clarissa swept into the room, her presence sucking the air out of it. She was dressed in a severe grey suit, her face a mask of focus. She bypassed the hosts with a curt nod and came straight to Kaia. \u201cFive minutes,\u201d she said, her voice a low command. \u201cRemember the key points. The emotion is the story. Don\u2019t be afraid to show it. The public needs to connect.\u201d She gave Kaia a pointed, meaningful look, a director giving her star one final, crucial note before the curtain went up.\n\nWalking onto the set was surreal. The iconic sofa, the view of the Thames through the studio window, the bright, friendly lighting \u2013 it was all so familiar, yet seeing it in person made her feel like she had stepped through her television screen. She sat down, the sofa even more comfortable than it looked, and tried to quiet the frantic thrumming of her own heart. The floor manager counted down, the theme music swelled, and suddenly they were live, the hosts\u2019 smiles brightening by an extra ten percent. The first part of the interview was a gentle warm-up. They talked about the moment she won, the confetti, the call to her parents. Kaia found her rhythm, her answers simple and honest, her natural Kiwi understatement earning a few warm laughs from the crew. She spoke of her parents\u2019 party, of her Uncle Barry and the feijoa hedge, painting a picture of home that felt warm and real.\n\nThen, as Liam had predicted, the conversation pivoted. The male host\u2019s expression became more serious, his tone more intimate. \u201cKaia, your winning song was one of the most powerful moments we\u2019ve ever witnessed on television. We know it\u2019s deeply personal. Can you tell us the story behind it?\u201d This was it. The moment of truth. She could feel Clarissa\u2019s will bearing down on her from the wings. She could almost hear her voice: *Hit the beats. Show the emotion.* She thought of her grandfather\u2019s hands, the lines like a road map. She thought of his quiet dignity. A wave of calm washed over her. She knew what she had to do.\n\nShe took a breath, meeting the host\u2019s sympathetic gaze with a quiet strength. \u201cIt was for my Koro, my grandfather,\u201d she began, her voice steady. \u201cHe passed away a few years ago, and he was\u2026 he was the heart of our family. A very kind, very strong, very private man.\u201d She paused, offering a small, sad smile. \u201cWriting the song was my way of talking to him, of holding onto his memory. And I think\u2026 I think the song itself says everything I could possibly say about him, and about what he meant to me. It\u2019s all in the music.\u201d\n\nThe female host, sensing a story being withheld, gently pushed. \u201cThere have been reports, stories about your time at a music academy\u2026 about the song having a difficult history. About another contestant.\u201d She left the accusation hanging in the air, an invitation for drama. Kaia felt a flicker of the old anger, but she pushed it down. Giving it oxygen would mean letting it define her. \u201cThere are always stories in this business, aren't there?\u201d she said, her tone polite but firm, offering a gentle deflection instead of a confrontation. \u201cMy journey to get here was a long one, with ups and downs like anyone else's. But what matters, to me, is that on that final night, I got to sing my song, my way, for my Koro. It felt like I was giving his memory back its dignity. And I\u2019d like to keep it that way.\u201d She looked directly into the camera, not with the tearful vulnerability Clarissa had demanded, but with a clear, unwavering gaze. \u201cHe deserves that.\u201d\n\nIt was a masterclass in quiet defiance. She hadn\u2019t been rude, she hadn\u2019t been difficult, but she had drawn an unmistakable line. She had refused to perform her grief. She had honored her grandfather\u2019s memory on her own terms. A brief, almost imperceptible flicker of confusion passed between the hosts, who had been expecting a very different kind of television moment. But they were professionals. The female host gave a respectful nod. \u201cBeautifully said, Kaia. A truly wonderful tribute.\u201d They moved on, talking about the record deal, the Royal Variety Performance, the bright future ahead. When the segment ended and the show cut to a commercial break, the crew burst into applause. The hosts hugged her again, this time with a new level of respect in their eyes.\n\nAs she was guided off the set, she saw Liam. He wasn't smiling. He was beaming, his face shining with a pride so profound it almost made her want to cry. \u201cThat,\u201d he mouthed, \u201cwas brilliant.\u201d But a few feet away, leaning against a wall with her arms crossed, was Clarissa. The mask was gone. Her face was tight with a cold, controlled fury. As Kaia approached, she pushed herself off the wall. \u201cThat was not what we discussed,\u201d she said, her voice dangerously low, each word a chip of ice. \u201cYou had a nation in the palm of your hand, and you gave them a polite deflection. You left the best part of the story on the table.\u201d\n\nKaia stopped, the adrenaline of the interview giving her a courage she didn't know she possessed. She met the producer\u2019s furious gaze without flinching. \u201cYou told me to be authentic, Clarissa,\u201d she said, her voice as quiet and steady as it had been on the sofa. \u201cThat was me. Being authentic.\u201d She didn\u2019t wait for a response. She simply turned and walked away, following Liam down the corridor, leaving Clarissa standing alone in the shadows of the set, her perfect narrative in tatters. The air outside the studio felt fresh and clean. The paparazzi were still there, but their shouting seemed distant and unimportant. For the first time since that phone call in the pre-dawn gloom, Kaia felt the solid ground beneath her feet. She had faced the machine and hadn\u2019t backed down. The war was far from over, but she had just won the first, most important battle.The silence in the car was a sanctuary after the bright, noisy battlefield of the television studio. For several minutes, Liam simply drove, his hands steady on the wheel, allowing Kaia the space to breathe. The world outside the tinted windows rushed by in a muted, disconnected stream. She felt wrung out, a damp cloth that had been twisted until every drop of emotion was gone. The confrontation with Clarissa, though brief, had taken a greater toll than the entire live interview. Clarissa\u2019s cold fury was the face of the machine she had just defied, a machine that was supposed to be on her side. Liam finally broke the silence, his voice gentle. \u201cFor what it\u2019s worth, what you did back there\u2026 that was the bravest thing I\u2019ve seen anyone do in this industry in a long time. It\u2019s easy to cry on command, Kaia. It\u2019s hard to have dignity.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s furious,\u201d Kaia murmured, staring at her own reflection in the dark glass. \u201cShe thinks I\u2019m throwing it all away.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe thinks in terms of assets and marketing strategies. You think in terms of people and respect. Don\u2019t ever apologise for that,\u201d he said firmly. He took a corner, his expression growing more serious. \u201cJust be ready. She\u2019ll have gotten to the label before we do. She\u2019ll paint you as difficult, uncooperative, naive. She\u2019ll say you don\u2019t understand the business. This afternoon\u2019s meeting at Syco\u2026 it\u2019s going to be tough. They\u2019re not your friendly neighbourhood TV producers anymore. This is the big league.\u201d\n\nSyco Entertainment\u2019s headquarters was a monument to modern, minimalist power. It was a sleek glass-and-steel tower in West London, a world away from the charmingly chaotic television studios. The lobby was a vast, echoing space of polished concrete floors and stark white walls, dominated by a reception desk that looked like a fragment of a meteor. The only warmth came from the gallery of framed gold and platinum discs that lined the corridor, a silent, glittering testament to the hit-making power of the empire Simon Cowell had built. Each frame represented a life changed, a career launched, a fortune made. Staring at the names \u2013 Leona Lewis, One Direction, Susan Boyle \u2013 Kaia felt an acute sense of vertigo. Her own name felt impossibly small and foreign in this place. She clutched her guitar case, the worn handle a familiar, earthy anchor in this sterile, stratospheric environment.\n\nThe boardroom was on a high floor, with a panoramic view of the city that made the world below look like a toy set. A long, dark table, polished to a mirror shine, reflected the grey London sky. Three people were already seated. At the head of the table sat a man in his late fifties with silver hair and an impeccably tailored suit, his face a mask of calm, shrewd intelligence. This, Liam had briefed her, was Richard Holloway, Simon\u2019s most trusted executive, the man who ran the label day-to-day. To his right sat a younger woman with a severe haircut and an intense, analytical gaze, her laptop already open. And to his left, her posture rigid, sat Clarissa. Her earlier fury had been replaced by a chillingly professional composure, but her eyes, when they met Kaia\u2019s, were like chips of ice. Richard stood as they entered, his smile polite but lacking warmth. \u201cKaia. Richard Holloway. On behalf of Simon and all of us at Syco, congratulations. A remarkable achievement.\u201d\n\nThe pleasantries were brief. Once Kaia and Liam were seated, Richard got straight to the point, his tone brisk and business-like. \u201cWe\u2019re all incredibly excited. The momentum is unprecedented. We need to move quickly to capitalize on it. The plan is to have a single out in three weeks, with the full album to follow six weeks after that, to hit the Christmas market. It\u2019s an aggressive schedule, but the appetite is there.\u201d The young woman, whose name was Zara, tapped at her laptop. \u201cWe\u2019ve already compiled a list of potential lead singles. Power ballads from some of the top writers in Sweden and L.A. We\u2019re thinking a big, anthemic track. Something that showcases the voice, but with a familiar structure. Proven hit-makers. Guaranteed radio appeal.\u201d She slid a sheet of paper across the table. It was another list, much like the one Kaia had been shown for the final. It was a menu of expertly crafted, emotionally generic songs.\n\nClarissa chose that moment to speak, her voice smooth and laced with poison. \u201cOf course, a key part of the strategy is consolidating Kaia\u2019s brand narrative. Her authenticity is her key selling point. Unfortunately, we had a slight\u2026 missed opportunity this morning.\u201d She looked at Richard. \u201cKaia was hesitant to share the more compelling, personal aspects of her story on national television. She felt it was too private.\u201d The implication was clear: *the asset is refusing to be monetized*. Richard\u2019s gaze shifted to Kaia, his expression unreadable. \u201cIs that so?\u201d\n\nThe boardroom seemed to shrink, the air growing thick and heavy. All three of them were looking at her, waiting. It was a test. \u201cMy song is personal,\u201d Kaia said, her voice quiet but clear, echoing Liam\u2019s advice in her head. \u201cThe story, the real story, is woven into the music. I think that\u2019s what people connected with. And I believe they\u2019ll connect with other songs I write, about other parts of my life.\u201d She took a breath, steeling herself. \u201cI\u2019m a songwriter, Richard. That\u2019s who I am. My vision for the album is\u2026 one I write myself. Or at least, co-write. I want to tell my own stories.\u201d\n\nZara, the analyst, let out a short, sharp sigh, as if Kaia had said something profoundly naive. \u201cOriginal compositions are a high-risk proposition for a debut artist, even a BGT winner,\u201d she said, her tone condescendingly patient. \u201cThe audience knows you through the filter of the show. We need to ease them in with familiar sounds. A full album of unknown, original material\u2026 it\u2019s a commercial gamble. We\u2019d be looking at a fraction of the projected sales.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith respect,\u201d Kaia countered, her confidence growing as she spoke her truth, \u201cthe biggest \u2018gamble\u2019 of the whole competition was me singing an original song about my grandfather in the final. A quiet song, in a big arena. It wasn\u2019t a power ballad. It wasn\u2019t a cover. It was just real. And it won.\u201d The silence that followed was heavy with her challenge. She had used their own success against them, and they didn\u2019t like it.\n\nRichard Holloway leaned back in his chair, steepling his fingers. He looked from Kaia to Clarissa, then back to Kaia. The polite mask had dropped, revealing the hardened executive beneath. \u201cYour win was a wonderful television moment, Kaia. A perfect story. But television moments don't always translate into album sales. Our job is to mitigate risk and maximize profit. We have a formula that works. It has worked for over a decade. We are offering you that formula.\u201d He leaned forward again, his voice dropping to a low, paternal tone that was more threatening than any shout. \u201cYou are a very talented young woman. But you are now part of a multi-million-pound business. I suggest you take some time to think about the big picture. Think about what it is you really want. We\u2019ll send the demos over to your hotel.\u201d The meeting was over. He had dismissed her as if she were a recalcitrant child.\n\nBack in the hushed, leather-scented interior of the car, the adrenaline drained away, leaving a hollow, aching exhaustion. Kaia stared blankly at the passing streets, her mind replaying the meeting. They hadn\u2019t listened. They hadn't heard a word she\u2019d said. They had already decided who she was going to be: a voice for hire, a singer of other people's songs, her own stories relegated to a quaint, uncommercial hobby. She had won the competition, but she had lost control of her own future. A profound, crushing wave of doubt washed over her. Maybe they were right. Maybe she was just a naive girl from a small town who didn't understand how the world worked. Maybe she should just be grateful, shut up, and sing the Swedish power ballads. The alternative was to fight, and to risk being labelled \u2018difficult\u2019, to be shelved, to lose everything she had just gained. The weight of the choice was suffocating.\n\nLiam glanced at her, his brow furrowed with concern. \u201cDon\u2019t let them get to you. That was round one. They were trying to intimidate you.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt worked,\u201d she whispered, her voice barely audible. Her phone buzzed in her pocket. She ignored it, too weary to face another congratulatory message that felt like a lie. It buzzed again, insistent. With a sigh, she pulled it out, expecting another pointless alert. It was a message from her Dad. There was no text, just a single, slightly blurry photo. It was a picture of their back garden in Greymouth. In the centre of the frame was the feijoa hedge, a large section of which was blackened and smoking slightly. Standing beside it, covered in soot but grinning from ear to ear, was her Uncle Barry, giving a triumphant double thumbs-up. Kaia stared at the ridiculous, wonderful, chaotic image. She thought of her dad, taking the time to send her this. This small, hilarious, tangible piece of her home. It was a reminder of the world she came from, a world of beautiful imperfections, of flawed, loving people, of stories that were messy and real. It was everything the polished, perfect, soulless world of the Syco boardroom was not. A small, shaky smile touched her lips. She knew what she was fighting for.\n\nShe was still looking at the photo when her phone buzzed one more time. This time, it wasn't a message from a friend or family member. It was a text from a number she didn't recognise. Her heart gave a nervous lurch. The message contained only a single, terrifying line.\n\n*Simon Cowell would like a word. My office. Now.*Liam saw the colour drain from her face. \u201cWhat is it? Not more from Clarissa?\u201d Kaia wordlessly handed him the phone, her hand trembling slightly. He took it, his eyes scanning the single line of text. His professional composure, the calm mask of the seasoned Artist Liaison, dissolved in an instant. A low whistle escaped his lips. \u201cBloody hell,\u201d he breathed, looking from the phone to Kaia and back again. He didn't have to ask who it was from. There was only one person in this building who could send a message like that, a royal summons that bypassed all chains of command. \u201cHe wants to see you. Now.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs this\u2026 is this bad?\u201d Kaia asked, her voice small. \u201cAm I being fired before I\u2019ve even started?\u201d\n\n\u201cFired? No. People like us get fired by email from HR. You don\u2019t get fired by a personal summons to the top floor,\u201d Liam said, his mind clearly racing. He was already turning the car around at the next intersection, heading back towards the glass tower they had just escaped. \u201cThis is either very, very good, or very, very bad. There\u2019s no in-between with him. He\u2019s either seen your interview and is going to tear you to shreds for disobeying Clarissa, or\u2026\u201d he trailed off, glancing at her in the mirror, \u201cor he\u2019s seen your interview and he\u2019s impressed. Either way, this is above my pay grade. Above everyone\u2019s pay grade.\u201d The drive back was a short, silent eternity. Kaia\u2019s stomach was a tangled knot of dread and a tiny, fluttering moth of hope. She had defied his generals. Now she was being called to answer to the emperor himself.\n\nThe journey to his office was an ascent into a different world. They took a private elevator, accessed with a special keycard from the formidable assistant who guarded his outer sanctum. The assistant, a woman with the serene, unshakeable calm of a bomb disposal expert, had simply nodded at them and pointed towards a set of unmarked double doors at the end of a quiet, art-filled corridor. Unlike the bustling, open-plan offices on the lower floors, the air up here was still and rarefied, the silence broken only by the whisper of the air conditioning and the soft tread of their feet on the plush, dove-grey carpet. It felt less like an office and more like the entrance to a private temple. Liam stopped outside the double doors, his role as guide ending here. \u201cThis is you, Kaia,\u201d he said, his voice a low whisper. \u201cRemember what I said. You have more power than you think. Just breathe.\u201d He gave her a final, encouraging nod, then retreated, leaving her utterly alone.\n\nTaking a breath that did nothing to calm the frantic hummingbird in her chest, she pushed the heavy door open and stepped inside. Simon Cowell\u2019s office was not what she expected. It wasn't a mahogany-panelled shrine to his own success. It was stark, modern, and overwhelmingly white. One entire wall was a floor-to-ceiling window offering a god-like, panoramic view of London. Another wall was a bank of silent, high-definition television screens, displaying a dozen different news channels and music video networks from around the world. He wasn\u2019t sitting behind a huge, imposing desk. He was standing by the window, his back to her, a slim black silhouette against the sprawling grey city. He wore his signature simple black t-shirt and jeans. He didn\u2019t turn around. \u201cClose the door,\u201d he said, his voice quiet but carrying an unmistakable authority that filled the large room. Kaia did as she was told, the door clicking shut behind her with a soft, final sound. The silence stretched. He was making her wait, a classic, simple exertion of power. She stood awkwardly in the middle of the vast white carpet, her guitar case held in front of her like a shield, feeling like a misplaced piece of luggage.\n\nFinally, he turned. His face, so familiar from television, was different in person. Less a caricature, more a study in controlled intensity. The lines around his eyes were deeper, his gaze sharper and more piercing than any camera could capture. There was no trace of the bored TV judge. This was a man who had built an empire from nothing, and every inch of him radiated that formidable intelligence and will. \u201cRichard Holloway tells me you don\u2019t want to be a pop star,\u201d he began, his voice calm, direct, cutting straight through the noise. \u201cHe tells me you\u2019re a songwriter. An artist. And that you think you know better than a team that has sold over two hundred million albums.\u201d\n\nKaia\u2019s mouth went dry. This was it. The dressing-down. But the memory of the smoking feijoa hedge, the image of her Uncle Barry\u2019s stupid, triumphant grin, flashed in her mind. It was an anchor to her own world, a world he couldn\u2019t touch. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I said,\u201d she managed, her voice steadier than she expected. \u201cI said I want to sing my own songs. I am a pop star, I guess. But I\u2019m a songwriter first. The reason I\u2019m standing in your office right now is because I sang my own song. A song your team told me was a commercial risk.\u201d\n\nA flicker of something \u2013 surprise? respect? \u2013 crossed his face before it was gone. He walked slowly towards the centre of the room, circling her as if inspecting a racehorse. \u201cWhat you did in the final was a moment of television magic. It was a beautiful story. It won you the show,\u201d he said, stopping in front of her. \u201cBut the music business isn\u2019t about moments. It\u2019s about momentum. It\u2019s about product. Zara and Richard want to give you a product that is guaranteed to sell. A Whitney Houston-style ballad. It\u2019s a proven formula. It\u2019s the safe bet.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a safe bet,\u201d Kaia said, her chin lifting slightly. \u201cI never have been. I was the girl from New Zealand singing a M\u0101ori love song in the semi-final. I was the girl singing a quiet song about grief when everyone else was setting off fireworks. Being safe isn\u2019t what got me here.\u201d\n\nHe stared at her for a long, unblinking moment, his eyes searching hers, looking for a weakness, a crack in the facade. She held his gaze, her heart hammering but her resolve hardening with every second that passed. She had nothing left to lose. \u201cNo,\u201d he said finally, a slow, grudging admission. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t.\u201d He gestured to one of the plush white sofas. \u201cSit down.\u201d She perched on the edge of the sofa, placing her guitar case carefully on the floor beside her. He remained standing, pacing in front of the vast window. \u201cClarissa believes you\u2019re being naive. Richard believes you\u2019re being difficult. Zara believes you are statistically a poor investment.\u201d He delivered these blows without malice, stating them as simple facts. \u201cThey want to put you in a box because they know how to sell that box. They don\u2019t know how to sell you.\u201d\n\nHe stopped pacing and turned to face her fully, his expression intense. \u201cI, on the other hand, am a gambler. I didn\u2019t get where I am by only making safe bets. I bet on a group of kids who couldn\u2019t dance and called them One Direction. I bet on a shy, middle-aged woman from a Scottish village. Sometimes, the biggest risks yield the biggest rewards. But I am not a fool. The risk has to be calculated.\u201d He looked down at her guitar case. \u201cYou want to write your own album. You believe you can write hits. Songs that are 100% you, that tell your stories, but that can also connect with millions of people. Is that right?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d she said, her voice a breath of hope. \u201cYes, it is.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlright,\u201d he said, the single word hanging in the air like a gunshot. \u201cProve it.\u201d He walked over to a sleek, minimalist sound system in the corner of the room. \u201cMy team wants to give you a single written by the best in the business. They say it\u2019s a guaranteed hit.\u201d He paused, looking at her, a challenge glinting in his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m going to give you one week. Seven days. You go away, and you write me a single. Your first single. It has to be better than the one they want to give you. It has to be a smash hit, a song that I can hear on the radio a thousand times a day. But it also has to be you. It has to have the same truth as the song you sang in the final. If you can do that, if you can bring me a song that blows me away, I will personally overrule my entire team. We will throw the formula out the window. We will make your album, your way.\u201d\n\nHe let the offer settle, the scale of it, the sheer impossibility of it, sinking into her. One week to write a masterpiece. One week to justify her entire artistic existence. \u201cAnd if I can\u2019t?\u201d she whispered, the question hanging heavy in the silent, white room.\n\nSimon\u2019s face became unreadable, the friendly gambler disappearing, replaced once more by the shrewd, powerful businessman. \u201cIf you can\u2019t,\u201d he said, his voice flat and final, \u201cyou\u2019ll come back into this office next Monday, you\u2019ll thank Richard and Zara for their expert guidance, and you will sing the bloody Swedish power ballad. And you\u2019ll sing it with a smile.\u201dKaia walked out of the double doors on legs that felt disconnected from her body. The stark white corridor seemed to tilt and sway, and she had to put a hand against the wall to steady herself. She had just walked out of the gravitational field of a star, and her own equilibrium was gone. Liam was waiting by the elevator, his face a mask of anxious anticipation. He took one look at her pale, stunned expression and his shoulders slumped. \u201cBad, then,\u201d he said, his voice flat with disappointment. \u201cHe tore you to shreds.\u201d Kaia shook her head, a slow, disbelieving motion. \u201cNo,\u201d she said, her voice a reedy whisper. \u201cWorse. He gave me a chance.\u201d She explained the ultimatum as the elevator descended in a silent, stomach-lurching drop. The challenge, the sheer, magnificent arrogance of it: *Write me a hit single. In one week. Or become the pop star we tell you to be.* When she finished, Liam didn\u2019t speak. He just stared at the polished steel of the elevator doors, a muscle working in his jaw. The doors opened into the vast, impersonal lobby, and he finally let out a long, slow breath. \u201cThe man\u2019s a monster,\u201d he said, not with anger, but with a kind of grudging awe. \u201cA magnificent, terrifying monster. He\u2019s not just testing your songwriting, Kaia. He\u2019s testing your nerve. He\u2019s pushing all his chips into the middle of the table and daring you to call his bluff.\u201d\n\nThe first two days were a creative wasteland. The beautiful, silent hotel suite became a gilded cage, its panoramic view a mocking reminder of the huge, indifferent world she was supposed to conquer. The silence, which had at first felt like a luxury, became a roaring void. She sat on the ridiculously comfortable sofa, her guitar in her lap, a pristine notepad open on the coffee table beside her. She tried to write. She tried to conjure the magic that had come so easily when she was writing for her Koro, for herself. But Simon\u2019s voice was a constant, critical heckle in her mind. *Is it a hit? Is it a smash? Will it sound good on the radio a thousand times a day?* She attempted to follow the formula, to write something anthemic. She pieced together big, soaring choruses and predictable chord progressions. The results were soulless Frankenstein\u2019s monsters, stitched-together parts of other, better songs. They sounded like advertising jingles for an emotion she didn\u2019t feel. Every time she played one back, she cringed. It was the sound of a fraud. Frustration curdled into a thick, choking panic. She paced the room, a prisoner in a five-star cell, picking at the untouched platters of exquisite food sent up by room service, the taste of ash in her mouth. She was a songwriter who couldn\u2019t write, a winner who was failing her first and most important test. On the evening of the second day, she called home, desperate for an anchor. \u201cEverything\u2019s great, Mum,\u201d she lied, the words feeling like stones in her mouth. \u201cJust busy. Lots of meetings.\u201d She listened to her mum talk about the new rose bushes she\u2019d planted and the latest gossip from the local supermarket, a dispatch from a sane, normal world that felt a million miles away. Hanging up, the sense of isolation was more acute than ever. She was utterly, terrifyingly alone with a blank page and a ticking clock.\n\nOn the morning of day three, she broke. Staring at her own haggard reflection in the mirror, she knew she couldn\u2019t spend another minute in that beautiful, suffocating room. She grabbed her phone and dialled Liam\u2019s number, her fingers clumsy with desperation. \u201cLiam,\u201d she said, her voice cracking. \u201cI can\u2019t do this. I can\u2019t write here. It\u2019s like trying to breathe underwater. I need to get out. I need to be somewhere real.\u201d There was a pause on the other end, and she heard him take a deep breath, the sound of a man making a decision. \u201cOkay,\u201d he said, his voice dropping into a conspiratorial tone. \u201cStay put. Don\u2019t answer the door to anyone. I\u2019ll sort something.\u201d An hour later, he called back. \u201cGo to the service elevator at the end of your hall. Take it down to the loading bay. A laundry van will be there in ten minutes. Get in the back. Don\u2019t ask questions.\u201d It was absurd, something out of a spy movie, but Kaia didn\u2019t hesitate. She grabbed her guitar and her notebook, left the pristine hotel room without a backward glance, and slipped down the service corridor, her heart pounding with the thrill of escape. She found the laundry van, its back doors slightly ajar, and scrambled into the darkness, the smell of industrial-strength detergent and clean linen enveloping her. Ten minutes later, the van rumbled out of the loading bay and into the glorious, chaotic freedom of the city.\n\nLiam drove her to a part of London she\u2019d never seen, a gritty, vibrant network of streets in Camden where the buildings were covered in graffiti and the air hummed with a different kind of energy. He pulled up outside a nondescript brick building, its door plastered with peeling flyers for long-forgotten gigs. \u201cWelcome to The Rat\u2019s Nest,\u201d he said with a wry smile. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit different from your hotel.\u201d He led her down a set of narrow stairs into a basement labyrinth of small, soundproofed rooms. The air was thick with the smell of stale beer, old carpet, and the faint, electric tang of ambition. From behind one door came the thrash of a punk band, from another, the intricate noodling of a jazz guitarist. This was the city\u2019s musical underbelly, the engine room where dreams were forged and broken. Liam unlocked one of the doors, revealing a small, windowless cube containing nothing but a couple of amplifiers, a drum kit, and a microphone stand. It was ugly, it was dingy, and it was the most beautiful thing Kaia had seen all week. \u201cIt\u2019s yours for the next four days,\u201d Liam said. \u201cNo one knows you\u2019re here. No room service, no producers, no Clarissa. Just you.\u201d He placed a bag on the floor containing a thermos of tea, a packet of biscuits, and a couple of sandwiches. \u201cI\u2019ll check in on you. Go on. Write your song.\u201d\n\nIn the glorious, soundproofed anonymity of the rehearsal room, something inside Kaia finally unknotted. The crushing weight of expectation began to lift. In this small, dark box, she wasn\u2019t the BGT winner. She wasn\u2019t a multi-million-pound investment. She was just a girl with a guitar. For the first few hours, she didn\u2019t even try to write. She just played. She let her fingers find their own way, rediscovering the simple joy of making a sound. She played the first song she ever learned, a clumsy three-chord folk tune. She played the waiata her Nan had taught her. She played for the sheer love of it, reconnecting with the part of herself that had been buried under the avalanche of the past week. And then, she started to think. She wasn\u2019t thinking about hits or choruses. She was thinking about the journey. She remembered the feeling of standing at the window of her London flatshare, watching the sky lighten from bruised purple to a soft, smudged grey. She thought of the sky back home in Greymouth, a different grey, a wilder grey, heavy with rain from the Tasman Sea. The idea sparked. *Trading one grey sky for another.* It wasn\u2019t a line about love or heartbreak. It was a line about displacement, about the strange parallel between the home you leave and the new world you enter. A melody began to form around the words, not a soaring, obvious tune, but something more nuanced, more melancholic, tinged with a quiet, persistent hope. The song started to pour out of her, not as a product to be manufactured, but as a story that needed to be told. It was a song about the ache of homesickness, the thrill of the unknown, and the search for a place to belong. It was the story of her life, right now.\n\nFor two days, she lived in that room, fuelled by Liam\u2019s sandwiches and lukewarm tea. The song grew, layer by layer. She found a chorus that felt like a quiet revelation rather than a loud declaration, a melody that lifted and fell like a steady breath. She wrote a bridge that spoke of the fear and the courage it took to leap into the void, to chase a dream across the world. The lyrics were specific and personal \u2013 she wrote about the taste of yesterday\u2019s instant noodles, the draft from a window that never quite closed \u2013 but the feeling was universal. It was a song for anyone who had ever felt small in a big city, for anyone who had ever yearned for the familiar comfort of home while simultaneously running towards a new horizon. Late on the evening of the sixth day, Liam knocked on the door. He found her sitting on the floor, surrounded by crumpled sheets of paper, her eyes shining with exhausted triumph. \u201cI think I\u2019ve got it,\u201d she said, her voice hoarse. She picked up her guitar, took a deep, shaky breath, and played it for him. She sang about the grey skies, the ghost of a southern ocean in a northern city, the hope that you carry inside you like a secret pilot light. When she finished, the final chord hanging in the small, stuffy room, Liam was silent. He wasn't looking at her like an artist liaison; he was just a man, listening, his face etched with a profound, quiet emotion. He cleared his throat. \u201cThat\u2019s it, Kaia,\u201d he said, his voice thick. \u201cThat\u2019s the one.\u201d\n\nThe seventh day dawned. Kaia was bone-tired but filled with a calm, electric certainty. The song was finished. It was hers. It was real. She had walked through the creative fire and emerged with this one, true thing. She showered at a cheap gym Liam had found for her, put on her green shirt armour one last time, and met him at the van. The drive back to the Syco tower felt completely different. The city no longer seemed alien or overwhelming. It was a landscape she had a stake in now, a place where she had fought a battle and won. As the gleaming glass-and-steel building loomed larger, she felt her heart begin to pound, a familiar drumbeat of fear and adrenaline. But this time, it was different. This time, she wasn\u2019t going in empty-handed. She wasn\u2019t a victim waiting for a verdict. She was a songwriter, armed with her song. She looked at her reflection in the window, at the determined set of her jaw. Alright, Simon, she thought, a small, fierce smile playing on her lips. Let\u2019s see you gamble.The elevator ascended in a smooth, silent glide, a hermetically sealed capsule rising through the heart of the Syco empire. This time, Kaia didn't feel like an intruder. She felt like a gladiator walking into the arena, her guitar case her shield and her new song its hidden sword. The familiar knot of fear was in her stomach, but it was a different kind of fear now \u2013 not the panicked dread of a victim, but the sharp, focused adrenaline of a fighter about to step into the ring. Liam stood beside her, a silent, solid presence. He hadn\u2019t said much on the drive over, simply giving her a thermos of hot tea and a single, firm instruction: \u201cDon\u2019t play it for them. Play it for you.\u201d\n\nSimon\u2019s formidable assistant greeted them with the same serene impassivity as before, but this time she didn\u2019t lead Kaia straight to the double doors. Instead, she gestured towards a small, adjacent waiting area, a minimalist space furnished with two low leather sofas and a glass coffee table. Seated on one of the sofas, as if they had been waiting to hold court, were Richard Holloway and Clarissa. The sight of them sent a jolt of ice through Kaia\u2019s veins. It was an ambush. They were here to witness her surrender. Clarissa was examining her perfectly manicured nails, a picture of bored indifference. Richard offered a smile that was all polished teeth. \u201cKaia,\u201d he said, his voice oozing a patronising warmth. \u201cPunctual. An excellent quality in a new artist. I trust you\u2019ve had a productive week and are ready to get started on the real work.\u201d\n\nHe tapped a sleek tablet on the table in front of him. \u201cWe have the demo for you. The track from the Swedish team. It\u2019s called \u2018Unbreakable\u2019. A real monster of a song. We\u2019re very excited about it. We\u2019ve even scheduled the preliminary vocal session for tomorrow morning.\u201d He was speaking as if her failure was a foregone conclusion, as if the past week had been nothing more than a childish indulgence the adults had permitted before getting down to serious business. Clarissa finally looked up, her gaze sweeping over Kaia\u2019s simple clothes with faint, undisguised disdain. \u201cI do hope you\u2019ve come to your senses, Kaia,\u201d she said, her voice dripping with condescension. \u201cIt would be a shame to squander all this momentum on a point of artistic pride. The business isn\u2019t built on pride. It\u2019s built on hits.\u201d\n\nKaia said nothing. She simply met their condescending gazes, her expression calm and unreadable. She thought of Liam\u2019s words: *Don\u2019t play it for them.* She wouldn\u2019t. She wouldn\u2019t even speak to them. Her silence was a wall they couldn\u2019t seem to breach, and it unsettled them. A flicker of irritation crossed Richard\u2019s smooth facade. He had expected a contrite, defeated girl, ready to accept their terms. He was not prepared for this quiet, unnerving composure. Before he could press his advantage, the door to the inner sanctum opened, and the assistant looked directly at Kaia. \u201cHe\u2019s ready for you now.\u201d\n\nIt was the most satisfying moment of Kaia\u2019s life. She gave Richard and Clarissa a small, polite nod, picked up her guitar case, and walked past them towards the double doors. She didn\u2019t look back, but she could feel their shocked, indignant stares burning into her. They had been dismissed from their own power play. She had been summoned past them, and they had been left behind in the waiting room. The power dynamic, for one brief, glorious moment, had been completely inverted.\n\nThe office was exactly as she remembered it: vast, white, and intimidating, with the whole of London sprawling beneath its panoramic window. Simon was not standing this time. He was seated in a low armchair, a cup of coffee in his hand, looking out at the view. He didn\u2019t get up. He simply gestured with his head towards the armchair opposite him. \u201cSit,\u201d he said. The single word was not a request. Kaia sat, placing her guitar case on the floor beside her. She felt like she was at a final exam, facing the one professor whose opinion was the only one that mattered. He took a slow sip of his coffee, his eyes still on the city below. \u201cOne week,\u201d he said, as if continuing a conversation from seven days ago. \u201cIt\u2019s a long time to be alone with your own ambition. It\u2019s a short time to create a masterpiece. Most people, when faced with that kind of pressure, either panic and produce nothing, or they panic and produce a copy of something they think I want to hear. Which one are you?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the one who wrote a song,\u201d Kaia replied, her voice steady. He finally turned his gaze from the window to her, and his eyes were sharp, analytical, devoid of any emotion. \u201cAlright then,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s hear it.\u201d There was no encouragement, no warmth. It was a clinical demand for data. Kaia\u2019s hands were slick with a cold sweat as she unlatched her guitar case. The familiar scent of old wood and metal strings filled the air, a small, earthy comfort in this sterile white space. She pulled the guitar into her lap, its worn, familiar shape a comfort against her body. She didn't look at Simon. She looked past him, out the window at the endless expanse of grey sky. She thought of the dingy rehearsal room, of the kindness in Liam\u2019s eyes, of the triumphant, sooty grin of her Uncle Barry. She took a breath. Then she played.\n\nThe first notes were quiet, intricate, a delicate finger-picked melody that was the polar opposite of a bombastic power ballad intro. It was a question, a searching sound. Then she began to sing, her voice soft but clear, painting the picture. \u201cTrading one grey sky for another\u2026 a ghost of a southern ocean in a northern town\u2026\u201d She sang the truth. She sang about the strange ache of being a stranger, the dizzying thrill of a new beginning, the tiny, specific details of her new life. She didn\u2019t perform it. She just told the story, her voice weaving through the melody, rising and falling with the emotion of the lyric. As she moved into the pre-chorus, she felt the song\u2019s power take hold, a subtle build of tension and hope, a gathering of clouds before a cleansing rain.\n\nAnd then the chorus hit. It wasn\u2019t a shout. It was an exhale. \u201cAnd they call this the big time, a city of gold and stone\u2026 but my heart is a compass, and it\u2019s always pointing home\u2026 Still I\u2019ll keep on walking, under these grey skies, \u2018cause I\u2019m carrying your sunlight in my eyes.\u201d It was a hook, but it was a hook steeped in genuine feeling. It was commercially brilliant and emotionally true, a perfect, paradoxical fusion of what the label wanted and what she needed to say. She poured all the fear, hope, and homesickness of the past few months into her voice, letting it soar for a moment before pulling back for the quiet introspection of the second verse. She felt a shift in the room, the subtle change in atmospheric pressure that occurs when a listener moves from casual hearing to deep, focused attention. He was no longer a judge or a CEO. He was just listening. She closed her eyes for the bridge, the part of the song that was a direct answer to his challenge, a quiet declaration of her own strength. \u201cYou told me to be a star, but you didn\u2019t say how far the fall would be\u2026 but I\u2019m not afraid of falling. I\u2019m afraid of never learning how to fly.\u201d\n\nShe ended the song softly, letting the final chord ring out and fade naturally into the silence of the room, her voice a final, whispered echo of the phrase, \u201cunder these grey skies.\u201d The silence that followed was absolute. It was deeper and more terrifying than the silence after her final performance. This wasn't a stadium of strangers; this was an audience of one, and his verdict was the only thing in the world that mattered. He didn't move. He didn't speak. He just sat there, staring at a point on the far wall, his face completely unreadable. Kaia\u2019s heart hammered against her ribs, a frantic, panicked bird. She had failed. The song was too quiet, too personal, too subtle. He wanted a hit, and she had brought him a poem. The silence stretched for an eternity. Finally, he blinked. He set his coffee cup down on the small table beside him with a soft click. \u201cThe transition from the verse to the pre-chorus,\u201d he said, his voice a clinical, analytical monotone. \u201cThe chord change on the word \u2018ocean\u2019. It\u2019s unexpected. Why?\u201d\n\nThe question was a test, a scalpel slicing into the heart of her creation. She didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cBecause that\u2019s what it feels like,\u201d she said. \u201cBeing homesick. It\u2019s not a constant sadness. It\u2019s a sudden jolt. An unexpected pang. The chord needed to reflect that. It needed to feel like a sudden memory you weren't prepared for.\u201d He nodded slowly, a single, deliberate motion. He looked at her again, and this time, the analytical mask was gone. In its place was something she couldn\u2019t quite name, a look of profound, startling intensity. \u201cRichard and Clarissa think you\u2019re a naive girl who stumbled into a lucky television moment,\u201d he said, his voice quiet. \u201cThey are fools.\u201d He stood up and walked over to his desk, picking up his phone. Kaia watched, her breath held tight in her chest. He dialled a number, putting the call on speakerphone. It rang once before Richard Holloway\u2019s brisk voice answered. \u201cRichard.\u201d\n\n\u201cSimon,\u201d Richard replied, a hint of confusion in his tone. \u201cIs the meeting over?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is,\u201d Simon said calmly. \u201cCancel the session with the Swedish writers. Cancel all of them. The girl is writing her own album.\u201d There was a stunned silence from the speaker. Richard finally found his voice. \u201cSimon, with respect, is that wise? We haven\u2019t even heard\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard all I need to,\u201d Simon cut him off, his voice hardening, leaving no room for argument. \u201cHer first single is called \u2018Grey Skies\u2019. I want it recorded, mastered, and delivered to every major radio station in this country by the end of the month. Am I clear?\u201d\n\n\u201cBut\u2026 the marketing plan, the strategy\u2026\u201d Richard stammered, his authority completely stripped away.\n\n\u201cThe strategy,\u201d Simon said, his voice dropping to a low, lethal calm, \u201cis that you are going to do exactly what I tell you to do.\u201d He hung up the phone without waiting for a reply, the sudden silence deafening. He turned to look at Kaia, who was sitting on the sofa, completely poleaxed, her mind struggling to catch up with the reality of what had just happened. For the first time, a genuine, unrestrained smile broke across Simon Cowell\u2019s face. It transformed him. \u201cCongratulations, songwriter,\u201d he said. \u201cYou won the bet. Now the real work begins.\u201dThe heavy door clicked shut behind her, the sound sealing Simon Cowell\u2019s verdict into reality. For a moment, Kaia just stood there in the silent, art-filled corridor, her mind a roaring vacuum. She had won. She had walked into the lion\u2019s den with a single, fragile song and walked out with the entire kingdom. Her legs felt unsteady, as if the floor itself was no longer a reliable surface. When she reached the waiting area, Richard Holloway and Clarissa were on their feet, their expressions a fascinating tableau of suppressed shock. Richard\u2019s face was a carefully blank mask of corporate professionalism, but a muscle twitching high on his cheek betrayed his fury. Clarissa, ever the strategist, had already recalibrated. Her face was arranged into a brilliant, predatory smile.\n\n\u201cKaia, darling!\u201d Clarissa purred, gliding towards her as if they were the oldest and dearest of friends. \u201cAn absolute masterstroke! I have to say, I had my doubts about your strategy, but that\u2019s why I love working with true artists. You have to trust the vision. I told Richard, I said, \u2018She has a fire in her. We have to let her run.\u2019 We are going to make history together!\u201d The cynical transparency of the lie was breathtaking. She was attempting to rewrite the history of the past hour, to reposition herself from antagonist to chief champion. Richard, meanwhile, simply adjusted his silk tie, his eyes cold. \u201cSimon has informed us of the new direction,\u201d he said, his voice clipped and devoid of any emotion. \u201cMy team will be in touch to coordinate the new recording schedule. Congratulations on your\u2026 successful pitch.\u201d The way he said the word \u2018pitch\u2019 made it sound like an insult, a lucky trick she had pulled off. Kaia looked from his barely-concealed resentment to Clarissa\u2019s false, glittering smile. A week ago, their condescension would have crushed her. Now, it was just noise. She felt a strange, liberating sense of pity for them. They were cogs in a machine she had just managed to reroute. She gave them a small, polite nod, the same one she had given them on the way in. \u201cThank you,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cI look forward to it.\u201d Then she turned her back on them and walked towards the elevator, where Liam was waiting, his face a giant, unasked question. The doors slid shut, sealing them off from the Syco executives, and as the car began its silent descent, the tension in Kaia\u2019s body finally snapped. A wild, giddy laugh escaped her lips, a sound of pure, incredulous joy. Liam stared at her for a second, then his own face broke into a huge, beaming grin. \u201cYou did it,\u201d he said, his voice full of wonder. \u201cYou absolute lunatic, you actually did it.\u201d\n\nThe real work began the very next morning. There was no gentle easing into the process. The deadline Simon had set\u2014a finished master for radio by the end of the month\u2014was hanging over them like a guillotine. Liam picked her up from the hotel, but they didn\u2019t go to the gleaming Syco tower. Instead, he drove her to a quiet, leafy street in St John\u2019s Wood, pulling up outside a famous, unassuming white building. Orion Studios. Its walls were steeped in musical history; legendary albums had been born in the rooms beyond its modest facade. This was not a corporate hit factory. This was hallowed ground. Kaia felt a fresh wave of imposter syndrome as she walked through the doors, her guitar case clutched in her hand. The place had a smell\u2014a mix of old wood, warm vacuum tubes, and decades of creative energy. The receptionist, a woman with kind eyes and purple hair, simply smiled. \u201cStudio Two. Finn\u2019s waiting for you.\u201d\n\nFinn was not what she expected. She had pictured another suit, another version of Richard Holloway. The man standing in the centre of the magnificent control room of Studio Two was in his late fifties, with a wild mane of grey hair, a faded Ramones t-shirt, and kind, bloodshot eyes that looked like they had witnessed a thousand late-night recording sessions. He was leaning over a vast mixing console that glittered with a galaxy of knobs and faders. He didn\u2019t stand up when she came in, just glanced over his shoulder. \u201cKaia,\u201d he said, his voice a low, gravelly rumble. \u201cYou\u2019re the Kiwi. Heard the song. It\u2019s not bad.\u201d For a legendary producer who had worked with some of the biggest names in music, \u201cnot bad\u201d was the highest form of praise. He gestured with his thumb towards the large live room, visible through a wall of thick glass. \u201cGo on then. Set up. Let\u2019s see what we\u2019re working with.\u201d There was no flattery, no mention of the show, no talk of branding or narrative. It was all about the music. For the first time, Kaia felt she could truly breathe. This was her language. This was her world.\n\nShe spent the first hour alone in the live room, a beautiful, wood-panelled space with a soaring ceiling. She was surrounded by a collection of vintage microphones that looked like museum pieces. The pressure was immense, but it was a different kind. It was the pressure to do justice to the song, to the opportunity, to the faith Simon and Liam had placed in her. When Finn\u2019s voice finally crackled through her headphones, it was calm and direct. \u201cAlright, Kaia. Let\u2019s just do one from top to bottom. Just you and the guitar. Don\u2019t try to perform. Just play it like you did in my office.\u201d She flinched. *My office?* Finn chuckled, a dry, rasping sound. \u201cSimon\u2019s. He sent me the recording from his phone yesterday. Now, stop thinking. Play.\u201d She took a breath, closed her eyes, and let the song unspool. The acoustics in the room were perfect; her guitar and her voice sounded warmer, richer, and more intimate than they ever had before. She sang it straight through, losing herself in the melody and the story. When she finished, a profound silence filled her headphones. She waited, her heart thumping. \u201cRight,\u201d Finn\u2019s voice crackled again. \u201cThat\u2019s the soul of it. My job is to build a body around that soul without crushing it. Guitar and vocal are good. That\u2019s our foundation.\u201d\n\nJust as they were about to start discussing the arrangement, the door to the control room opened and Clarissa swept in, bringing a blast of expensive perfume and corporate chill into the creative sanctuary. She was dressed in a sharp, cream-coloured pantsuit, holding a tablet. \u201cFinn, darling,\u201d she said, her voice bright and brittle. \u201cJust wanted to touch base on the visual strategy. I\u2019ve had a concept for the music video sent over. Very clean, very high-fashion. We\u2019re thinking a stark, white studio, Kaia in a beautiful designer gown, maybe some wind machines for the chorus\u2026\u201d Finn didn\u2019t even look at her. He pressed a button on the console. \u201cKaia,\u201d he said into the microphone, his voice calm. \u201cWe\u2019re going to try putting down a bass line. I\u2019m thinking something simple, melodic. Something that walks with the vocal, not under it.\u201d He was completely ignoring Clarissa, treating her as if she were a ghost. Clarissa\u2019s smile tightened. \u201cFinn, the single\u2019s success is dependent on a cohesive marketing campaign. The video is a crucial component.\u201d\n\nFinn finally swivelled his chair around to face her, his expression one of immense, weary patience. \u201cClarissa,\u201d he said, his voice dangerously soft. \u201cYour job is to sell the record. My job is to make a record that\u2019s worth selling. Right now, we are making the record. That means this room,\u201d he gestured around the studio, \u201cis my church. And in my church, we don't talk about marketing strategies or wind machines.\u201d He swivelled back to the console. \u201cAnd we don\u2019t wear cream pantsuits.\u201d The dismissal was so absolute, so devastatingly calm, that for a moment Clarissa was rendered speechless. A flush of angry red crept up her neck. Without another word, she turned on her heel and strode out of the control room, the door swinging shut behind her with a sharp hiss. A slow grin spread across Finn\u2019s face. He leaned into the microphone. \u201cRight, Kaia. Where were we?\u201d Kaia, watching the entire exchange from behind the glass, let out a shaky laugh. She had found a new ally, a grizzled, formidable guardian at the gate of her music. The real work had begun, and for the first time, she felt she was not alone in the fight.The week that followed was a blur of focused, joyful work, a complete immersion in the craft of making music. The dingy, anonymous rehearsal room had been a sanctuary for writing; Orion Studios became a cathedral for building. In Finn, Kaia found not just a producer but a translator, a man who could take her abstract, emotional descriptions and turn them into tangible, audible reality. He never told her what to do; instead, he would lean back in his chair, his eyes closed, and ask questions that forced her to dig deeper into her own vision. \"The bass,\" he\u2019d rumble after a take. \"Does it feel like it's walking with you, or is it dragging behind?\" or \"That harmony. Is it a friend singing with you, or is it a ghost?\"\n\nHe brought in a rhythm section, two session musicians who were legends in their own right. The bassist, Bill, was a man in his sixties with a face like a weathered roadmap and hands that looked like they could wrestle a crocodile, but he played with a melodic grace that was breathtakingly gentle. The drummer, Marcus, was a young, sharp-witted guy with an infectious energy, but when he sat behind his kit, his entire being became focused on serving the song, his ear attuned to the most subtle nuances of Kaia\u2019s vocal. At first, she was intimidated, terrified of telling these masters of their craft what to play. But Finn created a space where she was the undisputed leader. \"It's your song, Kaia. Your story,\" he said simply, when he saw her hesitate. \"They're here to help you tell it. So, tell them.\" And so she did. She spoke not in musical terms, but in feelings. For the drumbeat, she described the steady, rhythmic pace of walking home from the tube station at night, tired but determined. Marcus listened, nodded, and simplified his beat into something that felt exactly like a steady, hopeful heartbeat. For the bass, she talked about a quiet, constant presence, a friend walking beside you in silence. Bill didn\u2019t say a word, just played a line that moved and breathed with her vocal melody, a perfect, understated counterpoint.\n\nEach day, the song grew, layer by layer, but it never lost its core of intimacy. They added a Wurlitzer electric piano, its sound warm and slightly melancholic, like rain on a windowpane. They experimented with backing vocals, with Kaia layering her own voice into soft, ethereal harmonies that sounded like distant echoes of her own thoughts. The biggest debate was over strings. Kaia was instantly wary, the word conjuring BGT-style schmaltz and the overblown arrangements the label had tried to force on her. \"I don't want it to sound\u2026 cheesy,\" she said, the word feeling inadequate. Finn nodded in understanding. \"There are two ways to use strings,\" he explained. \"You can slather them on like ketchup to hide the taste of a bad burger, or you can use them like a pinch of salt to bring out the flavor that\u2019s already there. We\u2019re going to use salt.\" He brought in a string quartet, four young, serious musicians, and had them play long, sustained, shifting chords that hung in the air behind the chorus, a sound that was less an orchestra and more the vast, open grey sky the song was named for. It didn't overwhelm the song; it gave it atmosphere, a sense of space and longing that elevated it to another plane.\n\nThe final piece of the puzzle was her own lead vocal. She had sung it dozens of times, but now she had to sing it over the rich, fully-realised world they had built. She stood in the centre of the large, dimly lit live room, her headphones on, a vintage Neumann microphone in front of her. Through the glass, she could see Finn and Liam, who had quietly slipped in, watching from the control room. Finn\u2019s voice came through her headphones, calm and low. \"You\u2019re not in a studio, Kaia. You\u2019re back in your flat. It\u2019s pre-dawn. You\u2019re looking out the window. Just tell us what you see.\" She closed her eyes. She wasn\u2019t performing for a record. She wasn\u2019t trying to impress Simon Cowell. She was back in that moment of profound loneliness and defiant hope. She sang the song from top to bottom in a single, unbroken take. Her voice was no longer just the sound of a girl with a guitar; it was the sound of an artist, infused with all the strength, fear, and resilience of her journey. It was a cry from the heart, captured in perfect, high-fidelity sound. When the final note faded, the silence in her headphones was absolute. She opened her eyes. In the control room, Finn didn't cheer or applaud. He simply looked at her, held her gaze for a long moment, and gave a single, slow, deliberate nod. It was the most profound praise she had ever received.\n\nLater that evening, the four of them\u2014Kaia, Finn, Liam, and Bill the bassist, who had stayed late out of sheer curiosity\u2014gathered in the control room for the first playback of the rough mix. The atmosphere was thick with a nervous, sacred excitement. Finn dimmed the lights until the only glow came from the hundreds of tiny lights on the mixing console. \"Right,\" he rumbled. \"Let's see what we've made.\" He pushed a single, large fader up, and the room was filled with sound. It began with the quiet intimacy of her acoustic guitar, just as she had written it. But then the heartbeat of the drums entered, followed by the soulful, walking bass line. The warm chords of the Wurlitzer bloomed, and then her voice, clear and present and heartbreakingly real. When the chorus arrived, the strings swelled subtly beneath it, not to add drama, but to add a vast, aching sense of space. It was her song, but it was bigger, deeper, and more powerful than she had ever imagined it could be. It was the sound of her own lonely heart, amplified into an anthem that could fill stadiums. Tears welled in Kaia's eyes, blurring the glittering lights of the console into a constellation. This was it. This was the sound she had been chasing. This was the truth. Liam sat motionless, his eyes closed, completely lost in the music. Beside him, Bill, the stoic, veteran musician, was nodding his head slowly, a rare, small smile playing on his lips.\n\nThe song faded out, leaving a ringing, emotional silence in its wake. No one spoke for a long time. Finn finally leaned back in his chair, the leather creaking in the quiet room. \"Well,\" he said, his voice gruff, but with an unmistakable undercurrent of pride. \"It doesn't suck.\" Coming from him, it was like a standing ovation. Kaia let out a shaky laugh, wiping the tears from her cheeks with the back of her hand. She felt hollowed out and completely full at the same time, an exhaustion so profound it felt like peace. They had done it. They had taken her small, fragile idea and built it into something strong and beautiful.\n\nOn the car ride back to the hotel, Liam was uncharacteristically quiet, still processing what he had heard. He finally turned to her, the city lights reflecting in his eyes. \"You know, all those years in this business,\" he said, his voice full of a quiet awe, \"I've seen them manufacture hundreds of hits. I've never actually seen anyone make a classic before. Not from the ground up.\" He shook his head in wonder. \"What you did this week, Kaia\u2026 it's the reason people like me get into this business in the first place.\" Kaia leaned her head against the cool glass of the window, a rough mix of \"Grey Skies\" playing softly from her phone. She looked out at the endless stream of headlights, at the anonymous faces in the crowds on the pavement, at the sprawling, glittering expanse of the city she was starting to understand. She was tired, she was homesick, and she was happier than she had ever been in her life. The song wasn\u2019t just a career move anymore. It was proof. Proof that she was right to fight, right to trust her own voice. And as her melody filled the quiet car, she knew, with a bone-deep certainty, that her story was only just beginning.The day of the playback was a strange, formal affair. Finn, Liam, and Kaia\u2014the creative trinity\u2014returned to the Syco tower, not as supplicants, but as artisans delivering a finished commission. They were ushered into a smaller, more intimate listening room, a space designed with perfect acoustics and furnished with a single, deep leather sofa. It felt less like a boardroom and more like a high-tech confessional. Richard Holloway and Clarissa were already there, their faces carefully neutral. The atmosphere was thick with a tense, professional politeness that felt far more hostile than open anger. There were no greetings, just a curt nod from Richard towards Finn. \"Let's hear it,\" he said.\n\nFinn, in his element, walked to the sleek control panel built into the wall. He didn't say a word. He didn't offer a preamble or manage their expectations. He simply pressed play. The opening notes of \"Grey Skies,\" the delicate, questioning acoustic guitar, filled the acoustically perfect room. The sound was so clean, so present, it felt like Kaia was sitting right there, playing it live. Richard sat perfectly still, his eyes closed, his expression unreadable as he listened with the intense focus of a man counting money. Clarissa, on the other hand, couldn\u2019t hide her reaction. As the song built, as the layers of bass, drums, and keys swelled into the first chorus, a flicker of genuine shock, quickly suppressed, crossed her face. This was not the simple, folky demo she had expected. This was a fully-formed, emotionally resonant, and undeniably commercial record. Her carefully constructed narrative\u2014that Kaia was a naive artist who needed professional guidance\u2014was being dismantled note by note.\n\nWhen the song faded out on its final, lingering chord, the silence it left behind was profound. It was Richard who broke it, his voice a dry, clinical assessment. \u201cThe mix is clean. The vocal performance is exceptional. The hook is subtle but effective.\u201d He opened his eyes and looked at Kaia, his gaze cool and appraising. \u201cIt exceeds commercial potential. Congratulations.\u201d It was a verdict, not a compliment, delivered with the emotional warmth of a financial report. Clarissa, however, had already pivoted. She clapped her hands together, a sharp, brittle sound in the quiet room, her face now radiating a brilliant, proprietary enthusiasm. \u201cSublime! Absolutely sublime,\u201d she gushed. \u201cIt\u2019s heartbreaking, it\u2019s hopeful, it\u2019s everything we wanted. The authenticity is just pouring out of it. Which brings us, of course, to the video.\u201d She had seamlessly co-opted their victory and was already steering the conversation back onto her own territory.\n\nShe tapped her tablet, and the large screen on the wall flickered to life, displaying a series of glossy images. A mood board. It showed models with windswept hair on stark, white sets; close-ups of expensive, flowing fabrics; artfully blurred city lights. It was the exact concept she had pitched in the studio. \u201cWe need to match the song\u2019s emotional weight with a powerful visual statement,\u201d she announced, her voice filled with a renewed sense of authority. \u201cWe need to present Kaia not just as a singer, but as an icon. Aspirational. Chic. We need to elevate her image. I\u2019m thinking a top-tier fashion director, someone like Emil Larsen. His work is all about that clean, high-end aesthetic. It will position the brand perfectly.\u201d\n\nKaia felt a familiar cold dread begin to creep back in. They were doing it again, trying to wrap her truth in a glossy, artificial package. The images on the screen had nothing to do with her song. They were generic signifiers of luxury, interchangeable and empty. She looked to Finn, but he remained silent, watching her, his expression neutral. This was her battle to fight. Liam, sensing her distress, subtly cleared his throat, a small signal of support. \u201cI\u2019m glad you think the song is authentic, Clarissa,\u201d Kaia began, her voice quiet but firm, refusing to be intimidated. \u201cBecause the video needs to be just as authentic. The song isn\u2019t about designer gowns or wind machines. It\u2019s about feeling small and lost in a big city. It\u2019s about the quiet moments. The tube ride home late at night, the condensation on a windowpane, seeing your own reflection in a puddle on the pavement.\u201d\n\nShe leaned forward, her passion for the song overriding her fear of the executives. \u201cThe video should be the song. It should be me, in a normal coat, with my guitar, walking through the real London. Not the London of postcards, but the London of rainy streets, of anonymous crowds, of little cafes. It should feel real because the song is real. It should feel like a page from a diary, not a page from a fashion magazine.\u201d Clarissa\u2019s smile was fixed, but her eyes had gone cold again. \u201cKaia, darling, that\u2019s a lovely, rustic sentiment, but it\u2019s not a marketing strategy. We\u2019re not selling a diary. We\u2019re selling a star. The public wants glamour, they want escapism. They don\u2019t want to see their own dreary commute reflected back at them in a music video.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think they want to see something they can connect to,\u201d Kaia countered, her voice gaining strength. \u201cThey connected with the song because it was honest. The video needs to have that same honesty.\u201d \u201cHonesty doesn\u2019t shift units, Kaia,\u201d Richard interjected, his patience clearly wearing thin. \u201cA strong, aspirational brand image does. Emil Larsen\u2019s involvement alone would generate significant press. A video of you wandering around in the rain, frankly, would not. From a return-on-investment perspective, Clarissa\u2019s approach is the only viable option.\u201d The room was divided. It was two against two. Art against commerce. Authenticity against image. The standoff was a perfect, tense miniature of her entire industry struggle.\n\nFinn finally spoke, his deep voice cutting through the tension. He wasn't looking at Richard or Clarissa. He was looking at Kaia. \u201cWhat do you want, Kaia?\u201d he asked simply. It was the same question she had been asked countless times, but coming from him, it felt different. It wasn\u2019t a challenge or a threat. It was a genuine inquiry. \u201cI want people to feel the song when they watch the video,\u201d she said, her gaze steady. \u201cI want it to be a companion piece, not an advertisement for a lifestyle I don\u2019t live.\u201d Finn nodded slowly. He turned his gaze to Richard. \u201cThere you have it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe artist has a vision. My job is to help her realize it. Not to help you sell handbags.\u201d Richard\u2019s jaw tightened. He was being outmaneuvered again, and this time by one of his own veteran producers.\n\nClarissa, seeing she was losing control, played her trump card. \u201cThis is not a creative debate, it\u2019s a logistical one,\u201d she said sharply. \u201cEmil Larsen is available to shoot next week. He has a crew, a concept, and a guaranteed delivery date that aligns with the single\u2019s release schedule. To start from scratch with Kaia\u2019s\u2026 idea\u2026 would mean finding a new director, developing a new concept, location scouting\u2026 it would push the release back by weeks. We would lose all the momentum Simon was so concerned about.\u201d It was a shrewd, practical argument, a weapon of deadlines and budgets designed to make Kaia\u2019s artistic vision seem like an irresponsible indulgence. Richard nodded in agreement. \u201cShe\u2019s right. We can\u2019t afford a delay. The schedule is the schedule. We\u2019ll move forward with Clarissa\u2019s plan.\u201d The verdict had been delivered. Kaia\u2019s heart sank. She had won the battle for the song\u2019s soul, but it seemed she was about to lose the battle for its face. She felt a surge of helpless anger. She had poured her heart into that record, only to have it dressed up in someone else\u2019s empty, fashionable clothes. She had come so far, only to be stopped by a production schedule. The fight, she realised with a sickening lurch, was not over. It was simply shifting to a new, more treacherous battleground.The walk back to the elevator felt like a march of the defeated. Kaia\u2019s earlier sense of triumph had evaporated, replaced by the bitter, metallic taste of compromise. She had poured every ounce of her soul into the recording, only to have its visual representation decided by a mood board of generic luxury. She felt a burning, impotent rage. They hadn't just disagreed with her idea; they had dismissed it as a quaint, unprofessional fantasy, swatting it away with the blunt instruments of budgets and schedules. It was a perfectly designed system, she realised. It wasn\u2019t designed to crush you with a single, brutal \u2018no\u2019. It was designed to slowly, methodically exhaust you with a thousand reasonable, practical, soul-destroying \u2018yes, but\u2019s, until you were too tired to fight anymore.\n\nIn the car, the silence was heavy and brittle. Liam drove, his hands tight on the steering wheel, his gaze fixed on the road ahead. He didn't offer any easy platitudes. He knew her well enough by now to understand that cheerful optimism would feel like an insult. Kaia stared out at the passing architecture, at the people moving along the pavements, living their real, un-storyboarded lives. That was the world her song belonged to, and it was a world her music video would now be forbidden from entering. The injustice of it was a physical ache in her chest. \u201cThey don\u2019t get it,\u201d she said finally, her voice low and tight. \u201cThey heard the song, but they didn\u2019t listen. They think it\u2019s about being sad in a pretty dress. They think authenticity is just a filter you can apply in post-production.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey get it, Kaia,\u201d Liam said grimly, his eyes meeting hers in the rear-view mirror for a brief, stark moment. \u201cThey just don't care. To them, your song isn't a story; it's an asset. And assets need to be packaged for maximum appeal. They\u2019re not building a video for your song; they\u2019re building a commercial for your brand. Clarissa\u2019s brand. And now, you\u2019re trapped. You fight, you\u2019re \u2018difficult\u2019 and you cause a delay that costs the label money, which is the one unforgivable sin. You don\u2019t fight, and you spend the rest of your career promoting a video that feels like a lie. It\u2019s a perfect trap.\u201d He was right. It was a perfect trap. And as they pulled up outside her grand, anonymous hotel, she felt its walls closing in.\n\nBack in the gilded cage of her suite, the panoramic view of the city felt like a mockery of her confinement. A courier had been. A sleek, black Syco-branded portfolio lay on the coffee table. She opened it. Inside was a CD labelled \u2018UNBREAKABLE \u2013 Reference Demo\u2019 and a thick document outlining the marketing and promotional schedule for the single. It was a blueprint for a future she no longer wanted, a life that was being expertly constructed for her by people who didn't know her at all. She let the portfolio slide from her fingers onto the plush carpet. She didn\u2019t want to hear \u2018Unbreakable\u2019. She could already imagine it: the bombastic production, the soaring but empty vocals, the lyrical platitudes about strength and resilience. It was the song of the person they wanted her to be, not the person she was. Exhaustion, heavier and more profound than any she had felt before, washed over her. She lay down on the huge, perfectly made bed and stared at the ceiling, feeling the fight drain out of her. Maybe this was just how it was. Maybe she had won her one great victory, and this was the price.\n\nAn hour later, a sharp, insistent knock on the door startled her from her stupor. She ignored it, assuming it was room service. But the knock came again, louder this time. Not the polite rap of hotel staff, but something more urgent. With a weary sigh, she dragged herself to the door and peered through the peephole. Her heart jumped. It wasn\u2019t Liam. It was Finn. He was standing in the corridor, his wild grey hair looking even more out of place against the hushed, beige luxury of the hotel. He looked impatient, like a caged animal. She quickly unlatched the door. \u201cWhat happened to \u2018my church\u2019?\u201d she asked, a weak attempt at a joke. \u201cThought you didn\u2019t leave the studio.\u201d\n\nFinn strode past her into the room without an invitation, his presence instantly disrupting its sterile perfection. He glanced at the portfolio on the floor and nudged it with the toe of his worn leather boot. \u201cThey send you the poison pill, then?\u201d he rumbled. \u201cThe \u2018guaranteed hit\u2019 to remind you what a professional sounds like.\u201d He turned to face her, his bloodshot eyes surprisingly sharp and clear. \u201cSo that\u2019s it? You made the best record you could, and now you\u2019re going to let a glorified perfume-ad director turn it into a commercial for sparkly water?\u201d\n\nHis bluntness was a splash of cold water. \u201cWhat am I supposed to do, Finn?\u201d she shot back, a spark of her old fire returning. \u201cThey have the director, the schedule, the budget. Clarissa said it herself, it would take weeks to set up anything else. I\u2019m trapped.\u201d Finn let out a short, humourless laugh. \u201cTrapped? That\u2019s what they want you to think. They build a box of logistics and deadlines around you so you won\u2019t even try to punch your way out.\u201d He took a step closer, his voice dropping, becoming conspiratorial. \u201cThe meeting ended at five. It\u2019s now seven. Clarissa\u2019s pet director, Larsen, is in Milan until Sunday night. He\u2019s scheduled for a full day of prep on Monday, with the shoot on Tuesday. That\u2019s their schedule. Their box.\u201d\n\nHe paused, letting the information sink in. \u201cThat gives us the entire weekend. It gives us about sixty hours. To do it ourselves.\u201d Kaia stared at him, her mind struggling to process the sheer audacity of what he was proposing. \u201cDo it ourselves? Make a whole music video? In a weekend? That\u2019s\u2026 that\u2019s insane.\u201d \u201cInsanity is the only rational response to a world that\u2019s gone mad,\u201d Finn said, a glint of anarchic glee in his eyes. \u201cThey want to fight you with schedules and budgets? Fine. We\u2019ll fight them with speed and truth. We won\u2019t ask for their permission because we know they\u2019ll say no. We\u2019ll just do it. We\u2019ll shoot your video, your way. And on Monday morning, when Clarissa is prepping her wind machines, we\u2019ll send a finished video to Simon Cowell. We don\u2019t give them an idea to reject. We give them a reality to deal with.\u201d\n\nIt was the most reckless, brilliant, and terrifying idea she had ever heard. It was a guerrilla war against her own record label. \u201cBut we don\u2019t have a crew,\u201d she stammered. \u201cA director, a camera\u2026\u201d Finn was already pulling out his phone. He scrolled through his contacts, a list that was a veritable who\u2019s who of the music industry, and stopped on a name. \u201cThere\u2019s a kid,\u201d he said, dialling the number. \u201cLeo. He was an intern at Orion a few years back. Film school genius. He\u2019s got more talent in his little finger than Emil Larsen has in his entire overpaid body. He hates the corporate video world. Thinks it\u2019s poison. He\u2019s been shooting tiny, brilliant videos for unsigned bands for no money, just for the love of it.\u201d He put the phone to his ear. \u201cHe\u2019ll be perfect.\u201d\n\nThe phone was answered on the second ring. \u201cLeo, it\u2019s Finn. Stop whatever you\u2019re doing. I\u2019m sending you a track. Listen to it. Then get your arse over to the Kestrel pub in Camden. You\u2019ve got an hour\u2026 Yeah, it\u2019s a job\u2026 No, the budget\u2019s terrible\u2026 Because it\u2019s the best song you\u2019re going to hear all year, that\u2019s why.\u201d He hung up, a slow grin spreading across his face. He then dialled Liam. \u201cLiam. Change of plan. Scrap whatever you\u2019re doing tonight. Get your logistical arse to The Kestrel in one hour. We\u2019re staging a coup.\u201d He looked at Kaia, his eyes blazing with a wild, creative fire. \u201cWell? Are you going to lie here and listen to their demo, or are you coming to start a revolution?\u201d\n\nAn hour later, the four of them were crammed into a worn, wooden booth in the back corner of a noisy, crowded pub. Liam, his face a mixture of terror and exhilaration, was already sketching out a potential shooting schedule on a stack of napkins. Across from him sat Leo, the director. He was younger than Kaia had expected, maybe twenty-two, with intense, dark eyes, a shock of untameable black hair, and an expression of burning artistic sincerity. He had a small, battered camera bag slung over his shoulder that looked like it had been through a war. \u201cThe song\u2026\u201d Leo said, his voice quiet but vibrating with passion as he looked at Kaia. \u201cIt\u2019s incredible. It\u2019s so honest. I saw it all when I was listening. The rain on the bus window. The blur of the streetlights. The feeling of being invisible in a crowd of millions. We have to capture that. No tricks, no slow-motion, no fake glamour. Just truth.\u201d\n\nHe was speaking her language. He understood. The plan they hatched over the next hour was a masterpiece of organised chaos. Leo had a small, trusted crew\u2014a camera operator and a sound tech\u2014who would work for beer and a credit on a project this good. Liam, using his intimate knowledge of the record label\u2019s labyrinthine bureaucracy, figured out how to requisition a small amount of cash from a miscellaneous marketing budget, enough to cover gear rental and transport. He would also be their lookout, their man on the inside, running interference if Clarissa\u2019s team started asking questions before Monday. Their studio would be the city of London itself. They would shoot guerrilla-style, moving fast, using natural light and the city\u2019s own raw energy. The shoot would start at dawn the next day.\n\nKaia looked at the faces around the small, sticky pub table: Liam, the loyal soldier, nervously double-checking his figures; Finn, the grizzled general, watching over them with a look of fierce pride; and Leo, the young, passionate warrior, his eyes shining as he storyboarded shots on the back of a beer mat. They were a tiny, rebel alliance against a vast, powerful empire. It was a crazy, impossible gamble, destined to fail in a hundred different ways. But as she looked at her small, determined team, a wave of fierce, defiant joy washed over her. She wasn't a victim. She wasn't a product. She was a fighter. She had won the battle for her song's soul; now, under the cover of a London weekend, they were going to stage a heist to steal back its face.The revolution began at four o\u2019clock in the morning. The air was cold and damp, tasting of wet pavement and the faint, metallic tang of the sleeping city. There was no fleet of production trailers, no bustling army of crew members, no catering tent with steaming urns of coffee. There was just a single, slightly battered white van parked on a deserted side street near Waterloo Bridge, its interior cluttered with camera cases and coiled cables. Leo, the director, was a blur of nervous energy, checking light meters against the pre-dawn gloom, his dark eyes alive with a kind of manic creative glee. His entire crew consisted of two people: a stoic, bearded cameraman named Sal, who looked like he could film comfortably in a war zone, and a young sound tech named Rina, who was meticulously taping a tiny microphone inside the collar of Kaia\u2019s coat.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re stealing the light, that\u2019s all we\u2019re doing,\u201d Leo whispered to Kaia, his breath misting in the cold air. \u201cThe sun\u2019s coming up for us. The city is our set. Don\u2019t think about the camera. Don\u2019t think about anything. Just be here. Look at your new home. What does it feel like?\u201d He didn\u2019t wait for an answer. He gave a nod to Sal, and the shoot began. They walked out onto the bridge as the sky began its slow, painful transition from inky black to a bruised, luminous grey. The city was a silhouette, its landmarks just dark shapes against the lightening sky. A few lone cars hissed across the wet asphalt. Leo didn't direct her; he simply followed, with Sal\u2019s camera seemingly attached to his hip. He filmed her leaning against the cold stone of the parapet, her guitar case on the ground beside her, her gaze lost in the vast panorama. He captured the shiver that ran through her, a mixture of cold and awe. He filmed her hands clutching a paper cup of tea Liam had provided, the steam rising like a fragile prayer. There was no artifice, no wind machine. There was just a girl, a city, and the quiet, aching space between them. It was the opening verse of her song, brought to life.\n\nFrom there, they plunged into the city\u2019s circulatory system: the Underground. Descending the escalator at Waterloo station during the first wave of the morning rush was like diving into a fast-moving river. The noise, the sheer density of people, was overwhelming. Leo thrived on it. \u201cDon\u2019t look away!\u201d he yelled over the din. \u201cLook at them! Find a face!\u201d Sal, a master of his craft, moved like a ghost through the crowd, his camera steady as a rock. He captured Kaia\u2019s face, a small, still point in the swirling chaos, her expression a mixture of fascination and profound alienation. He filmed the reflections of passing trains in her eyes, the blur of advertisements, the anonymous procession of faces, each one carrying their own story, their own private universe. At one point, a transport police officer eyed their professional-looking camera with suspicion, his hand moving towards his radio. Liam, ever the logistical wizard, materialized at his side instantly, asking for directions to a fictitious address with such a flurry of polite, detailed confusion that the officer was completely distracted, giving Sal and Leo just enough time to hustle Kaia onto a train, the doors hissing shut behind them. It was a close call, and the jolt of adrenaline made the entire enterprise feel thrillingly, dangerously real.\n\nThe rain began in the early afternoon, a soft London drizzle that quickly thickened into a determined downpour. While a normal film crew would have scrambled for cover, Leo looked up at the grey, weeping sky and grinned. \u201cPerfect,\u201d he declared. They were in a quiet residential street in Angel, the terraced houses gleaming, the pavements turning to black mirrors. \u201cNo umbrella,\u201d Leo instructed. \u201cJust walk.\u201d Kaia did as he said, pulling the collar of her coat up, her guitar case bumping against her leg. The rain plastered her hair to her face and seeped into the shoulders of her coat, but she didn\u2019t care. She felt completely alive. Sal filmed her from across the street, capturing her small figure moving through the vast, grey emptiness. He shot her reflection in a shop window, a ghostly image superimposed over a display of second-hand books. He filmed a close-up of her face, tilted up to the sky, raindrops clinging to her eyelashes, a look of melancholic acceptance on her face. It was the visual embodiment of her chorus: a quiet resilience in the face of a persistent, overwhelming grey.\n\nThey spent the rest of the weekend in a frantic, joyous race against the clock. They shot in a small, steamy caf\u00e9 filled with the smell of fried bacon and strong tea, with Leo filming through the condensation-streaked window, blurring the line between viewer and subject. They filmed on the top deck of a night bus as it wound its way through the glittering, rain-slicked streets of the West End, capturing the lonely beauty of the city after midnight, the neon lights painting fleeting colours on Kaia\u2019s thoughtful face. Each location, each shot, was a line from her song. It wasn't a performance; it was a documentary of a feeling. Throughout it all, the tiny crew worked with a seamless, unspoken understanding. Liam was their guardian angel, appearing with hot tea, navigating traffic, and paying for gear rentals with cash from a seemingly bottomless petty cash fund. Finn was their silent oracle, appearing at odd intervals on set, observing for an hour with his arms crossed, and then disappearing again after delivering a single, gruff nod of approval that was worth more than a thousand words of praise.\n\nTheir final shot took place just before dawn on Monday morning, on the grassy slope of Primrose Hill. The sixty hours were almost up. They were all running on fumes, their bodies aching with exhaustion, their minds buzzing with a creative high. Below them, London was a vast, sleeping creature, a sea of twinkling lights under a sky that was just beginning to blush with the promise of a new day. Leo set up the final shot himself, placing the camera on a tripod. \u201cJust you and the city, Kaia,\u201d he said softly. \u201cYou\u2019re not an outsider anymore. You\u2019ve fought it, and you\u2019ve found your place in it. It\u2019s not your enemy. It\u2019s just home. For now.\u201d Kaia sat on the damp grass, her guitar across her lap. She wasn\u2019t playing, just holding it. She looked out at the sprawling, magnificent view. The city didn\u2019t feel overwhelming anymore. It felt\u2026 known. She had walked its streets, ridden its buses, felt its rain. She had poured her story into its cracks, and in return, it had given her its own raw, complicated beauty. Sal\u2019s camera rolled as the sun finally broke through the horizon, bathing her face in a soft, golden light. A genuine, un-directed smile touched her lips. It was a look of quiet, hard-won peace.\n\n\u201cAnd\u2026 cut,\u201d Leo whispered, his voice hoarse with emotion. It was over. A profound, bone-deep exhaustion settled over the small group, followed by a wave of pure, triumphant elation. They had done it. They had stolen a music video from the heart of the corporate machine. They packed up their gear in a companionable silence, the clinking of metal latches the only sound in the quiet dawn. In the back of the van, Leo immediately plugged his hard drives into his laptop, his face illuminated by the screen's glow as he started scrolling through the footage. He let out a low whistle. \u201cIt\u2019s all here,\u201d he said, his voice full of wonder. \u201cIt\u2019s all\u2026 true.\u201d He looked up at Kaia, his eyes shining with a fierce, artistic respect. \u201cThank you,\u201d he said simply.\n\nLiam drove her back to the hotel, the sky now a brilliant, hopeful blue. He pulled up to the service entrance. \u201cLeo and Rina are going straight to an edit suite Finn\u2019s \u2018borrowed\u2019 for the day,\u201d he explained. \u201cThey\u2019ll work around the clock. With any luck, we\u2019ll have a finished video to send to Simon by midnight.\u201d He looked at her, at her rain-damp hair, the dark circles of exhaustion under her eyes, the radiant happiness on her face. \u201cGo get some sleep. You\u2019ve earned it. The storm breaks today.\u201d She slipped back into her hotel room, a ghost returning to her gilded cage. The room was exactly as she had left it, pristine and silent. On the coffee table, the Syco portfolio for the \u2018Unbreakable\u2019 campaign lay where she had dropped it, a relic from a battle that had already been fought and won. She picked it up, walked over to the wastepaper basket, and dropped it in. She had no idea what would happen when Simon Cowell received their renegade video. She might get celebrated. She might get sued. She might be thrown out of the music industry before her career had even begun. But as she stood there, looking out at the city she had just claimed as her own, she didn't feel afraid. She felt free.",

It sounded like a trapped hornet, a noise of pure, undiluted panic. Kaia\u2019s hand shot out from under the thin duvet, fumbling in the pre-dawn gloom of her London flatshare. Her fingers found the buzzing plastic, slick with the condensation of a cold room. The screen was an obnoxious splash of white light: 'UNKNOWN CALLER'. Probably the landlord again, chasing the extra twenty quid for the busted toaster. She nearly swiped it to decline. Nearly. But some other instinct, a tiny fizz of maybe-perhaps-what-if that had lived in her stomach for the past forty-eight hours, made her thumb slide the other way.\n\n\u201cHello?\u201d Her voice was a croak, thick with sleep and the lingering taste of yesterday\u2019s instant noodles.\n\n\u201cIs this Kaia Morehu?\u201d The voice on the other end was pure clipped efficiency. A voice that organised people and things into neat, profitable columns.\n\n\u201cUh, yeah. Speaking.\u201d She sat up, the duvet pooling around her waist. A draft slithered in through the window frame, which never quite closed properly.\n\n\u201cKaia, this is Clarissa from Syco Entertainment. I\u2019m one of the senior producers on Britain\u2019s Got Talent.\u201d\n\nKaia\u2019s entire respiratory system decided, at that precise moment, to go on strike. Air hitched in her throat. The trapped hornet had been a premonition. Her heart took over, thumping a frantic, unsteady rhythm against her ribs, a drum solo for an audience of one.\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d she managed, the single word a masterpiece of Kiwi understatement. Inside, a chorus of a thousand tiny voices was screaming.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just calling to officially inform you\u2026\u201d A pause. A professionally calibrated, dramatically perfect pause. Kaia could almost see the woman in her mind\u2019s eye: sharp blazer, sharper haircut, a smile that didn\u2019t quite reach the eyes, holding a clipboard that held the entire world. \u201c\u2026that you\u2019ve made it. You\u2019re through to the final.\u201d\n\nThe world didn't so much explode as dissolve. It simply ceased to be a collection of solid objects \u2013 the lumpy mattress, the peeling poster of a T\u016b\u012b on the wall, the precarious stack of university textbooks \u2013 and became, instead, pure, unadulterated feeling. A supernova of joy. A tidal wave of disbelief. She wasn't breathing. She was pretty sure she'd forgotten how.\n\n\u201cKaia? Are you still there?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d she finally gasped, the words tumbling out on a rush of long-overdue air. \u201cOh my god. I\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m in. The final?\u201d She said it as a question, needing to hear it again, to make the impossible sound real.\n\n\u201cThe grand final,\u201d Clarissa confirmed, a sliver of genuine warmth colouring her tone now that the official business was done. \u201cCongratulations. You truly deserve it. Your semi-final performance\u2026 it was something special, Kaia. The phones went into meltdown.\u201d\n\nHer semi-final. It felt like a lifetime ago, a dream she\u2019d had. Standing on that enormous, unforgiving X, the studio lights hot enough to melt plastic, the four judges just distant silhouettes against a roaring, faceless crowd. She\u2019d sung an old waiata, a song her Nan had taught her. \u2018P\u014dkarekare Ana\u2019. A simple love song, but one that carried the weight of home, of the green hills and the wild, grey sea of the West Coast. She\u2019d started small, her voice barely a whisper, her only accompaniment the acoustic guitar cradled in her arms. She\u2019d felt terrifyingly small and alone, a kiwi in a cage of lions. But then she\u2019d closed her eyes and thought of her Nan, of her voice, reedy and strong, singing it across the kitchen table. She\u2019d thought of her Dad, his impossibly wide grin. She\u2019d thought of the smell of rain on hot asphalt in her hometown, Greymouth. And the song had bloomed. Her voice, freed from the cage of her nerves, had soared out into the vast, dark auditorium, filled it, owned it. When she\u2019d finished, the silence that followed was more profound, more terrifying than any noise. It stretched for a single, perfect heartbeat. And then the place had erupted. A wall of sound, of applause, of people on their feet. Even Simon, the emperor of stone-faced disapproval, had looked\u2026 moved. He\u2019d called it \u2018utterly, breathtakingly authentic\u2019. Amanda had been in tears.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll need you at the studios tomorrow at nine a.m. sharp,\u201d Clarissa was saying, pulling her from the memory. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot to get through. Press calls, choreography, wardrobe, staging concepts. It\u2019s going to be a full-on week, so get some rest. And Kaia?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell done.\u201d\n\nThe line clicked dead. Kaia stared at the phone, at the blank screen, then slowly lowered it. She looked around her tiny room. The same room that had, five minutes ago, felt like a shoebox, a temporary holding cell. Now it was the launchpad. The epicentre of the rest of her life. A laugh bubbled up from her chest, a strange, hysterical sound. She was in the final of Britain\u2019s Got Talent. Her. Kaia Morehu from Greymouth, New Zealand. The girl who learned to play guitar on her Dad\u2019s beat-up old six-string and whose biggest audience, until a few months ago, had been the slightly drunk patrons at the local pub\u2019s open mic night. It was insane. It was impossible. It was happening.\n\nShe scrambled for the phone again, her fingers clumsy with adrenaline. She scrolled to \u2018Mum and Dad\u2019 and hit the call button, forgetting, in her delirium, about the twelve-hour time difference. It would be evening there. They\u2019d be home from work, probably Dad in his armchair with the paper, Mum in the kitchen making something that smelled of home.\n\nIt rang. Once. Twice.\n\n\u201cKaia? Is everything alright, darling?\u201d Her mum\u2019s voice, fuzzy and distant, but so unmistakably *her*. The sound was an anchor.\n\n\u201cMum!\u201d Kaia squeaked, tears suddenly pricking her eyes. Tears of joy, of shock, of a homesickness so acute it felt like a physical ache. \u201cMum, I got in!\u201d\n\n\u201cGot in? Got in where, love? Are you talking about that course\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cNo! No. BGT. Britain\u2019s Got Talent. The final. Mum, I\u2019m in the final!\u201d\n\nThere was a muffled sound on the other end, of the phone being passed, a confused, \u201cWhat\u2019s she saying, Deb?\u201d from her dad.\n\n\u201cBrian, she\u2019s in! She\u2019s in the final!\u201d Her mum\u2019s voice rose, cracking with excitement. A loud whoop echoed down the line, her dad\u2019s signature sound of pure, unadulterated delight.\n\n\u201cYou little beauty!\u201d he bellowed, his voice so loud Kaia had to pull the phone away from her ear. \u201cI told you! I told your mother! Didn\u2019t I tell you, Deb? Our girl\u2019s a star!\u201d\n\nKaia laughed, the tears now freely tracing paths down her cheeks. She could picture them so clearly: Mum leaning against the kitchen counter, one hand pressed to her chest, Dad probably doing a little victory jig in the lounge, scattering the newspaper. They\u2019d been so worried about her coming all this way, to this vast, indifferent city. They\u2019d pooled their savings to help with her student visa and the deposit on the flat, their faces a mixture of pride and fear at the airport. Now, their joy was a tangible thing, a warm current flowing thousands of miles across oceans and continents to reach her in this cold little room.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have to watch it live,\u201d her mum was saying, a practical edge to her excitement. \u201cWhat time will it be on? Brian, you\u2019ll have to figure out the streaming thing on the computer. The one you use for the rugby.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you worry, I\u2019ll get it sorted. We\u2019ll have the whole street over! We\u2019ll have a party!\u201d her dad boomed. \u201cYou just go out there and smash it, K. Sing your heart out. We\u2019re so, so proud of you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will, Dad. I love you guys.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe love you too, darling. So much. Now go on, you\u2019ll need your sleep. Call us tomorrow. Oh, this is just the best news!\u201d\n\nShe hung up, a wide, tremulous smile plastered on her face. The exhaustion had vanished, replaced by a jittery, high-octane energy. Sleep was impossible. She slid out of bed, her bare feet cold on the floorboards, and went to the window. The sky over London was beginning to lighten, a palette of bruised purple and soft, smudged grey. The city was slowly waking up, a low, distant hum of traffic starting to build. For the first time since she\u2019d arrived, it didn\u2019t feel alien or overwhelming. It felt like a city of possibility. A city where a girl from the other side of the world could stand on a stage and sing a song about her home and, somehow, be heard. She hugged her arms around herself, a shiver running through her that had nothing to do with the cold. It was the thrill of it. The terror of it. The final. In one week, she\u2019d be back on that stage, singing for the title, for the prize money, for the chance to do this \u2013 just this, sing \u2013 for the rest of her life. For a moment, she allowed herself to dream. An album. A tour. Maybe even paying her parents back. Maybe, just maybe, buying a guitar that wasn't second-hand. The possibilities felt infinite.\n\nThe next morning, the studio was a hive of controlled chaos. It smelled of hairspray, hot lights, and expensive coffee. People with clipboards and headsets swarmed through the corridors, their faces set with a uniform expression of intense purpose. Kaia, clutching her guitar case like a life raft, felt her small-town-girl status more keenly than ever. She was given a laminated pass with her photo on it \u2013 a terrible, deer-in-the-headlights shot from her first audition \u2013 and pointed towards a large rehearsal room.\n\nInside, a handful of the other finalists were already there, scattered around the room in loose, uncertain clumps. There was the dance troupe of teenagers from Manchester, all identical tracksuits and nervous energy; the magician with the intense eyes and the pack of cards he was shuffling with impossible speed; the family of string players, their cellos and violins leaning against the wall like silent, watchful relatives. A man with a kind face and a clipboard introduced himself as Liam, her designated Artist Liaison. His job, he explained, was to be her main point of contact for the week.\n\n\u201cRight, Kaia, sweet as,\u201d he said, his London accent a friendly contrast to Clarissa\u2019s cut-glass tones. \u201cFirst up, a quick chat with the producers about song choice. They\u2019ve got some ideas, but obviously, the final call is yours. Then it\u2019s a preliminary wardrobe fitting, a session with the vocal coach, and a quick on-camera chat for the VT. Busy day, but we\u2019ll get you through it.\u201d\n\nShe nodded, her throat suddenly dry. \"Song choice?\"\n\n\"Yeah. They loved the waiata, obviously. It was magic. But for the final... they're wondering if maybe you should do something more... familiar. A big ballad. Something everyone knows, that you can put your own spin on. Just an idea to float.\"\n\nKaia's heart sank a little. The whole point, for her, was the authenticity. Singing a cover of some Whitney Houston power ballad felt... fake. It wasn't her. But she just nodded. \"Okay. I can think about it.\"\n\nShe was led into a smaller, plusher office where Clarissa and two other producers sat behind a large desk. The smiles were wider today. She was a finalist. She was valuable.\n\n\"Kaia, darling, come in!\" Clarissa said, gesturing to a chair. \"How are you feeling? Thrilled?\"\n\n\"Yeah, pretty chuffed,\" Kaia admitted, the Kiwi phrase slipping out. It earned her a blank look from one of the producers, a man with a suspiciously smooth forehead.\n\n\"Right. So, the final. We want to go bigger. We're thinking a full orchestra. A gospel choir, perhaps. White dress. Dry ice. The works. We need a moment, Kaia. A Susan Boyle moment.\"\n\nKaia swallowed. \"An orchestra? Wow. I've only ever played with my guitar.\"\n\n\"Exactly! The contrast will be stunning,\" the smooth-foreheaded man said. \"Now, song. We've compiled a list. 'I Will Always Love You'. 'Hallelujah'. 'My Heart Will Go On'. Classics. Guaranteed tear-jerkers.\"\n\nShe looked at the list they pushed across the table. It felt like a karaoke menu. \"These are amazing songs,\" she said carefully, trying not to sound ungrateful. \"But... they're not really me. The reason the semi-final worked, I think, was because the song was real. It was part of me.\"\n\nClarissa held up a placating hand. \"We hear you, we do. But this is the final, Kaia. We need to appeal to the broadest possible demographic. Your song was beautiful, but it was in a different language. A lot of our viewers... well, they might not connect with it in the same way. A familiar melody, reinterpreted by your incredible voice? That's a winning formula.\"\n\nThe conversation went around in circles for another ten minutes, a polite but firm battle of wills. Kaia felt a growing sense of unease. They were trying to sand down her edges, to make her fit into a pre-made, BGT-winner-shaped hole. She eventually agreed to \"consider\" their suggestions, and escaped back into the corridor, her head spinning.\n\nLiam, her liaison, was waiting for her. He must have seen the look on her face. \"Don't you worry about them,\" he murmured, steering her towards the wardrobe department. \"They're just doing their job. You stick to your guns. Your gut's got you this far, right?\"\n\nKaia gave him a grateful smile. \"Yeah. I guess.\"\n\nThe rest of the day passed in a blur of fabric swatches, vocal scales, and questions from a perky TV crew about her 'journey'. It was exhausting, exhilarating, and deeply strange. By late afternoon, she was sitting in a communal green room, nursing a cup of tea, trying to process it all. The magician was showing a card trick to the dancers, who were making appropriately appreciative noises. It was a weird, temporary family, all of them bound by the same shared, surreal experience.\n\nOn a large television screen mounted to the wall, a promotional ad for the final was playing on a loop. It was a montage of the finalists' best moments. Her own face appeared, eyes closed, singing the first few bars of 'P\u014dkarekare Ana'. A thrill went through her, sharp and sweet. Then the screen cut to the magician, then the dancers. Then a face she hadn't seen yet today. A face she knew.\n\nHer stomach plunged. The tea in her hand trembled, sloshing over the rim of the cup. It couldn't be.\n\nThe announcer's voice, thick with gravitas, boomed over the images. \"...and, in a shock twist, the judges have chosen their Wildcard entry. The act they believe deserves a second chance at the grand prize... he's back! The boy with the golden voice... Julian Vance!\"\n\nOn the screen, Julian, with his perfectly coiffed blond hair and a smile that could sell snake oil to a snake, was belting out some generic pop song. His eyes were closed in a pantomime of deep feeling, one hand clutching the microphone stand. The judges were on their feet. The crowd was ecstatic.\n\nThe air left Kaia's lungs in a rush, as if she'd been punched. Julian Vance. Her arch-rival. Her nemesis. The ghost at the feast. He wasn't just in the final. He was the Wildcard. The chosen one. The one the judges had personally saved.\n\nTheir history wasn't just a casual competition rivalry. It was a nasty, tangled thing that went back three years to a summer music academy in Auckland. He was the city boy, entitled and arrogant, with a technical perfection that was chilling. She was the raw talent from the provinces. He'd seen her as a threat from day one. He'd \"accidentally\" spilled coffee on her sheet music minutes before a recital. He'd started a rumour that she'd cheated on a theory exam. But the worst, the thing she could never forgive, was the song. She'd written a song, a deeply personal piece about her grandfather's passing. She'd played it for a few friends in a common room, late one night. Julian had been lurking in the hallway. A week later, at the final showcase, he'd performed it. He'd claimed he'd written it himself, tweaking a few lyrics, changing the chords just enough to make it his. The tutors, unfamiliar with her original, had praised his 'emotional depth'. She'd been left speechless, violated. He had stolen a piece of her grief and paraded it for applause.\n\nAnd now he was here. Not just here, but anointed. The golden boy. A sickness rose in her throat. This wasn't a fair fight anymore. It was a narrative. The producers didn't just want a winner; they wanted a story. And what better story than the redemption of the handsome, charming young man, the one who got away, brought back for a second chance at glory? Compared to that, what was she? The quirky girl from New Zealand. A novelty. The authentic flavour of the week.\n\nOne of the dancers, a girl named Chloe, noticed her expression. \"You alright, love? You look like you've seen a ghost.\"\n\nKaia put her cup down, her hand shaking. \"Something like that,\" she whispered, her eyes still fixed on Julian's smug, smiling face on the screen. The infinite possibilities of the morning had collapsed into a single, ugly point. Him. The joy, so bright and blinding, had been snuffed out, replaced by a cold, heavy dread. Her chance, her one shining, impossible chance, was about to be scuppered. And he was the one holding the scissors."

                                        "text": "The green room door swung open, and the televised image of Julian Vance was replaced by the real thing. He strode in as if he owned the building, a walking, talking embodiment of expensive cologne and unearned confidence. The blond hair was even more artfully tousled in person, his smile even more predatory. He was dressed in a ridiculously tight t-shirt and designer jeans that probably cost more than Kaia\u2019s rent for the entire year. A few of the dancers let out audible squeals. He was a known quantity, a pre-packaged star. He basked in the attention for a moment before his eyes scanned the room, landing, inevitably, on her.\n\nA slow, deliberate smirk spread across his face. He began to walk towards her, a shark gliding through shallow water. The other finalists seemed to melt away, creating a clear path between them. Kaia\u2019s knuckles were white where she gripped the now-cold ceramic cup. Every instinct screamed at her to run, to throw the tea in his face, to disappear. But she was rooted to the spot, pinned by the weight of his gaze and three years of festering resentment.\n\n\u201cKaia Morehu. As I live and breathe,\u201d he said, his voice a smooth, practised baritone. He stopped in front of her, close enough that she could smell the mint on his breath. \u201cFancy seeing you here. From the open mics of Greymouth to the BGT final. Quite the leap. You\u2019ve come a long way.\u201d He said it like a compliment, but it landed like a slap. He was reminding her of her place, of the chasm that separated their worlds.\n\n\u201cJulian,\u201d she managed, her voice flat and devoid of any warmth. \u201cThey let you back in, then.\u201d\n\nHe chuckled, a sound that held no humour. \u201cThe judges\u2019 prerogative. They felt the competition was missing a certain\u2026 star quality. But hey, it\u2019s great that you\u2019re here too. Adds a bit of rustic charm. We should catch up, for old times\u2019 sake.\u201d He winked, a gesture of such profound insincerity it made her stomach churn. He was playing a part for the audience in the room, the friendly rival. He was daring her to call him out, knowing she wouldn\u2019t. Not here. Not now.\n\nBefore she had to formulate a response, Liam appeared at her elbow, a blessed interruption. \u201cKaia, we need to run you back to the hotel. Car\u2019s waiting.\u201d He shot a brief, professional nod at Julian. \u201cMr. Vance. Welcome back.\u201d Liam\u2019s tone was perfectly neutral, but Kaia caught a flicker of something in his eyes \u2013 a guardedness, a hint of sympathy for her. He had seen the whole exchange.\n\nShe stood, using the excuse to put space between herself and Julian. \u201cRight. Yeah, let\u2019s go.\u201d She didn\u2019t look back as Liam guided her out of the room, but she could feel Julian\u2019s eyes on her, a smug, triumphant pressure between her shoulder blades. The corridor felt long, the silence between her and Liam stretching until he finally spoke, his voice low.\n\n\u201cHeard he was a bit of a tosser,\u201d Liam said, not as a question but as a statement of fact. \u201cSaw him in the auditions. All flash, no heart. Don\u2019t let him get in your head, Kaia. He\u2019s one of ten. You\u2019re one of ten. It\u2019s a level playing field.\u201d\n\nKaia wanted to believe him, but she couldn\u2019t. \u201cIs it, though?\u201d she asked, her voice barely a whisper. \u201cHe\u2019s the Wildcard, Liam. The judges saved him. The producers are already planning his coronation. I heard one of them talking about his \u2018redemption arc\u2019. What\u2019s my arc? The quirky foreigner who gets a pat on the head before the real star takes the prize?\u201d The bitterness she\u2019d been swallowing all afternoon finally spilled out.\n\nLiam stopped and turned to face her, his kind eyes serious. \u201cYour arc is that you\u2019re the best singer in this competition. Your arc is that you made Simon Cowell feel an actual human emotion. That\u2019s a bigger miracle than him walking on water. Don\u2019t you forget that. Now, go home. Get your head straight. We start again tomorrow. And Kaia? Think about your song.\u201d\n\nBack in the cold silence of her flat, the earlier joy felt like a distant, phantom limb. The room was just a room again. The city outside was just a vast, roaring machine. She felt the full weight of the thousands of miles separating her from anyone who truly knew her. She scrolled through her contacts, her thumb hovering over her parents\u2019 number. What would she even say? *Hey Mum, Dad, great news, that guy who stole my song and broke my heart is now my main competition and everyone loves him.* She couldn\u2019t do it. She couldn\u2019t load her worries onto their happiness.\n\nInstead, her thumb found a different number. \u2018Nan\u2019. It was a long shot. Her grandmother was notoriously bad with her mobile, but the thought of hearing her voice was a lifeline Kaia desperately needed to grab. After several rings, a crackly voice answered. \u201cKaia? Is that my moko?\u201d\n\n\u201cHi, Nan,\u201d Kaia breathed, sinking onto the edge of her bed. \u201cSorry, is it a bad time?\u201d\n\n\u201cNever a bad time for you, my girl. I was just watching the kerer\u016b in the k\u014dwhai tree. Fat as mud, they are. Your Koro would\u2019ve said they\u2019re laughing at us.\u201d A wave of homesickness, so sharp and powerful it almost buckled her, washed over Kaia. She could see it all: the yellow blossoms of the k\u014dwhai, the fat, iridescent wood pigeons, her grandfather\u2019s smiling ghost beside the tree. \u201cYou sound tired, moko. Is this big city wearing you out?\u201d\n\n\u201cA bit,\u201d Kaia admitted. \u201cNan\u2026 I\u2019m in the final.\u201d\n\nThere was a sharp intake of breath, followed by a low, rumbling chuckle. \u201cOf course you are. I knew you would be. You have the gift. It is in your blood, in your bones. It is the voice of all of us, singing through you.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s hard, Nan. They want me to be someone I\u2019m not. To sing songs that aren\u2019t mine. And there\u2019s\u2026 there\u2019s someone else in the competition. Someone who hurt me a long time ago. He steals things. He stole a song from me once.\u201d\n\nHer Nan was silent for a moment. When she spoke again, her voice had lost its gentle, reedy quality and was replaced by something hard and ancient, like river stone. \u201cNo one can steal your voice, Kaia. They can steal the words. They can steal the tune. But they cannot steal the *wairua*, the spirit, that you put into it. That is yours alone. When you sing, you sing of our mountains and our sea. You sing of your Koro. You sing of us. Can he do that? This boy? Can he sing of our home?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Kaia whispered, tears welling.\n\n\u201cThen you have nothing to fear. Remember who you are, moko. You are a daughter of the West Coast. We are not people who bend in the wind. We are the stone the water breaks against. You sing your truth. You sing your heart. And let that be enough.\u201d\n\nThe line went dead a few moments later, her Nan declaring the battery was about to die. Kaia sat in the gathering dark, her grandmother\u2019s words echoing in the tiny room. *You are the stone the water breaks against.* Something shifted inside her. The dread didn\u2019t vanish, but it solidified. It morphed from a paralysing fog into a cold, hard stone of resolve in her gut. Liam was right. Her Nan was right. She had one weapon, and it was the only one that mattered: her truth.\n\nThe next morning, she walked into the studio with her guitar case in hand and a new light in her eyes. She found Liam and said the words that had been forming in her mind all night. \u201cI need a meeting with Clarissa. I\u2019ve chosen my song for the final.\u201d\n\nShe was ushered back into the plush office, the same producers sitting in the same chairs, Clarissa at the head of the table. The list of approved ballads was still sitting there. Clarissa smiled, a tight, business-like expression. \u201cKaia. Wonderful. I do hope you\u2019ve come around to our way of thinking. \u2018I Will Always Love You\u2019 with a string quartet would be a real moment.\u201d\n\nKaia placed her hands flat on the polished table. She met Clarissa\u2019s gaze and held it. \u201cI\u2019m not singing any of those,\u201d she said, her voice quiet but firm. \u201cI appreciate the suggestions, but they\u2019re not me. I\u2019m going to sing one of my own.\u201d\n\nThe smooth-foreheaded producer scoffed. \u201cAn original song? In the final? Kaia, that\u2019s commercial suicide. It\u2019s too risky. The audience needs familiarity.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m singing is a story,\u201d Kaia continued, her voice gaining strength, ignoring him and speaking directly to Clarissa. \u201cIt\u2019s the most personal thing I\u2019ve ever written. It\u2019s a song about grief, and about memory. And it\u2019s a song another finalist is going to recognise.\u201d\n\nClarissa\u2019s eyes narrowed. The professional mask slipped for a fraction of a second, revealing the shrewd producer beneath. She leaned forward. \u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m saying Julian Vance stole a song from me three years ago. A song I wrote about my grandfather\u2019s death. He performed it and claimed it as his own,\u201d Kaia said, the words hanging in the air, cold and heavy. \u201cFor the final, I\u2019m going to sing the real version. My version. The way it was always meant to be sung.\u201d\n\nA dead silence fell over the room. The producers looked at each other, then at Clarissa. This wasn't in their script. A cover ballad was a safe bet. A quirky foreign song was a risk. But this? This was a stick of dynamite. This was a narrative they couldn\u2019t control, a drama that was all too real.\n\nClarissa stared at Kaia, her expression unreadable. Kaia could see the calculations flashing behind her eyes. The risk of an unknown song versus the undeniable, explosive television drama of a live, on-air confrontation. A story of theft and reclamation. It was messy. It was dangerous. And it was utterly compelling.\n\nFinally, a slow smile, a genuine one this time, spread across Clarissa\u2019s face. It didn\u2019t reach her eyes. It was all teeth. \u201cWell, Kaia,\u201d she said, leaning back in her chair. \u201cNow that is a moment.\u201d"

                                        "text": "The energy in the office didn\u2019t just shift; it underwent a phase change, from solid corporate caution to a gaseous, electric excitement. The smooth-foreheaded producer, who had moments before dismissed her idea as commercial suicide, now leaned forward, his eyes gleaming. The other producer was already scribbling furiously on a notepad. They didn\u2019t see a grieving granddaughter anymore. They saw a story. They saw ratings. Clarissa, their queen, had given the signal, and now the pack was hungry. She held up a perfectly manicured hand, silencing the burgeoning chatter.\n\n\u201cForget the orchestra,\u201d Clarissa commanded, her voice crisp and decisive. \u201cForget the gospel choir. This is not a \u2018Hallelujah\u2019 moment. This is a pin-drop moment. It\u2019s you, the guitar, and a single spotlight. We strip everything away. The set is black. The audience disappears. It\u2019s a confession. It\u2019s a reckoning.\u201d She wasn\u2019t asking Kaia; she was directing a scene. She looked at Kaia, but she was seeing a camera shot, a television event that would have people talking for weeks. \u201cWe\u2019ll put him on before you. Let him do his big, flashy, empty number. Then\u2026 you.\u201d\n\nLeaving the office felt like surfacing from a deep dive. The air in the corridor was thin, and Kaia\u2019s ears were ringing. She had won. She had gotten permission to sing her song. But the victory tasted like ash in her mouth. She had wanted to reclaim her story, but in the process, she had handed it over to be scripted, packaged, and sold. Clarissa\u2019s talk of \u201creckoning\u201d and \u201cconfession\u201d turned her sacred memory into a tawdry spectacle. She wasn\u2019t honouring her grandfather anymore; she was weaponizing him. The thought made her feel sick. The righteousness that had propelled her into that office had curdled into a cold, heavy shame. She had invited the world into her most private grief, and the world had responded by asking for a better camera angle.\n\nThe machine whirred into motion with terrifying speed. Liam found her by the vending machines, his expression a mixture of awe and profound pity. \u201cThey\u2019re going into overdrive,\u201d he said, his voice low. \u201cThe storyboards are already being drawn up. They\u2019re calling it \u2018The Reclamation\u2019.\u201d A brand. They had branded her pain. Before she could process this, the VT crew appeared, led by the same perky producer from the day before. This time, her smile was gone, replaced by a look of journalistic solemnity. \u201cKaia, we need to sit down with you. We want you to tell us everything. Start from the beginning. Tell us about your Koro. What was he like? And tell us about the academy. The moment you realised Julian had\u2026 taken it.\u201d The camera\u2019s red light blinked on, an unfeeling eye demanding its pound of emotional flesh.\n\nHer first rehearsal on the main stage was an exercise in quiet torture. The vast, empty auditorium felt less like a venue and more like an interrogation chamber. As Clarissa had decreed, it was just a single stool, a microphone stand, and a cone of white light cutting through an ocean of black. The director\u2019s voice, disembodied and godlike, echoed from the control booth. \u201cOkay, Kaia, from the top. And on the line about his hands, can you look up, just past camera two? Like you\u2019re seeing a ghost. Let\u2019s try that.\u201d She tried to sing, to find the melody that lived in her bones, the one that smelled of hospital corridors and her grandfather\u2019s woollen jersey. But the words wouldn\u2019t come out right. They felt staged, hollow. They were choreographing her heartbreak, and the wairua, the spirit of the song, was retreating, hiding from the glare of the lights.\n\nJulian, meanwhile, was not oblivious. The tectonic plates of the production had shifted beneath his feet, and he was sliding from the centre. He saw the hushed conversations, the way the crew\u2019s attention now followed Kaia like a compass needle pointing north. He saw her emerge from long meetings with Clarissa, her face pale but set. The fawning had stopped. He was no longer the chosen one; he was just another finalist, and a deep, paranoid suspicion began to fester behind his confident facade. He cornered her by the catering table, his body blocking her exit. The friendly rival mask was gone, his face tight with anger. \u201cWhat did you say to them?\u201d he hissed, his voice a venomous whisper. \u201cWhat lies have you been telling?\u201d Kaia looked at him, at his handsome, furious face, and for the first time, she felt nothing. No fear, no anger, just a vast, weary emptiness. She thought of her Nan\u2019s words: *Can he sing of our home?* She said nothing, simply picked up a bottle of water and walked around him. His impotent fury was a bigger victory than any argument she could have won.\n\nThat night, she couldn\u2019t bear the thought of calling her parents. She couldn\u2019t lie to them, and she couldn\u2019t tell them the truth \u2013 that their daughter\u2019s tribute to their father was about to become the grist for a reality TV mill. Instead, she sat on her lumpy bed and pulled her guitar into her lap. She didn\u2019t try to rehearse. She just played. She played old chords her dad had taught her. She played the melody from a lullaby her mum used to sing. She let her fingers find their way back to the song for her Koro, not the choreographed version for the cameras, but the real one. The one she\u2019d written in the dead of night, her cheeks wet with tears, in a quiet room half a world away. She played it for herself. For him. A quiet act of defiance against the machine that sought to own it. It was a prayer in the pre-dawn gloom of her London flatshare, a reclamation of her own.\n\nThe final days were a blur of managed tension. The air in the studios was thick with unspoken things. The other finalists, sensing the high-voltage current between Kaia and Julian, kept their distance, forming a neutral zone between the two opposing camps. Julian grew more sullen and isolated, rehearsing his bombastic pop number with a desperate intensity, while Kaia spent her time in quiet rooms with her vocal coach, a gentle woman who seemed to understand. \u201cForget them, love,\u201d she\u2019d say. \u201cJust find the truth in it. Sing it for the person it was meant for.\u201d It became Kaia\u2019s mantra. In press interviews, she was polite but evasive when journalists, sniffing a story, asked about the \u201crumoured history\u201d with Mr. Vance. In wardrobe, she calmly refused the virginal white dress they offered, opting instead for simple black jeans and a dark green silk shirt, the colour of pounamu, of the deep, wet ferns of the West Coast. She was building her armour, piece by piece.\n\nThen, it was the night. The final. Backstage was a hurricane of hairspray, sequins, and frantic energy. Dancers stretched in corridors, a magician practiced a coin vanish with shaking hands, and the family of string players tuned their instruments with grim determination. Kaia was in her small, stark dressing room, the sounds of the roaring crowd a distant sea. Her guitar lay across her lap, its polished wood warm and solid. It felt like the only real thing in the world. A sharp knock on the door made her jump. It was Liam, his face pale under the fluorescent lights. \u201cFive minutes, Kaia,\u201d he said, his voice tight with nerves. \u201cYou\u2019re on after Julian.\u201d Of course she was. The final, perfect, producer-approved twist of the knife. She would have to listen to his triumphant, stolen noise, and then walk out into the echo of it. She nodded, her throat too dry to speak. He gave her a small, supportive nod. \u201cBreak a leg. No, wait. Just\u2026 sing it for you.\u201d The door clicked shut, leaving her alone once more. She closed her eyes, took a long, shuddering breath, and tried to block out the roar of the crowd, the frantic energy, the face of Julian Vance. Instead, she pictured a small kitchen table. She pictured her Nan\u2019s hands, wrinkled and strong, wrapped around a mug of tea. She heard her voice, reedy and clear. *You are the stone the water breaks against.* The stage manager\u2019s voice crackled over the intercom. \u201cJulian Vance to the stage. Stand by, Kaia.\u201d The water was coming."

                                        "text": "Through the thin walls of her dressing room, the opening bars of Julian\u2019s song erupted. It wasn\u2019t music so much as an assault; a wall of synthesized strings, a bombastic drum machine beat, and a bass line that vibrated up through the soles of Kaia\u2019s feet, shaking the very foundations of her resolve. Then came his voice, technically flawless, soaring through predictable vocal acrobatics with polished precision. He hit a glory note, and the crowd roared its approval, a beast waking in the arena next door. Kaia flinched, the sound a physical blow. This was what they wanted. This was the winning formula: loud, familiar, and utterly devoid of a soul. A cold spike of pure panic shot through her, and she felt the desperate, primal urge to be anywhere else on earth.\n\nShe squeezed her eyes shut, her knuckles white on the neck of her guitar. *Breathe, K. Just breathe.* She forced the air into her lungs, holding it, then letting it out in a slow, shuddering sigh. She didn\u2019t picture the stage or the judges. She pictured the West Coast, the sky a moody grey, the smell of coal smoke and wet ferns. She pictured the way the rain came down in relentless, cleansing sheets, washing the whole world clean. *You are the stone the water breaks against.* Her Nan\u2019s voice, a calm anchor in the hurricane of noise from the stage. The stage manager\u2019s voice, tinny and urgent, cut through her thoughts. \u201cKaia, to the wing. Let\u2019s go.\u201d She stood, her legs feeling like hollow reeds. The guitar was heavy in her hands, a familiar, solid weight. As she stepped into the dimly lit corridor, she passed Liam. He didn\u2019t say a word, just met her eyes and gave a single, firm nod. It was enough.\n\nThe corridor leading to the stage was a tunnel of darkness, at the end of which pulsed the bright, terrifying world of the show. Julian\u2019s song reached its crescendo, a final, ridiculously long note held for maximum effect. The applause that followed was a physical shockwave, a roar of pure ecstasy that shook the air. A moment later, he strode off the stage and into the wing, his face drenched in sweat and flushed with arrogant triumph. He was high on the applause, his eyes wild. He saw her waiting, her small, dark figure dwarfed by the rigging and the chaos. A dismissive, triumphant smirk crossed his lips. It was a look that said, *Follow that.* A look that said, *You\u2019ve already lost.* And in that moment, something inside Kaia finally clicked into place. The fear didn't vanish, but the shame did. The shame of being manipulated, of her grief being used as a plot point. It burned away, leaving behind a cold, clear, diamond-hard resolve. He hadn't just stolen her song. He had underestimated her.\n\nShe walked out of the darkness and into the light. It was a physical assault, a supernova of white and blue that bleached the world of all colour. The noise was even bigger out here, a shapeless, roaring entity that threatened to swallow her whole. In the far distance, the judges\u2019 desk was a glittering oasis, the four of them just silhouettes against the glare. She didn't look at them. She didn't look at the screaming, waving crowd. She fixed her eyes on the single wooden stool waiting for her in the vast, empty blackness of the stage floor. It felt a hundred miles away. She walked towards it, each step deliberate, her guitar held tight against her chest like a shield. The roar of the crowd began to falter, confused by her silence, by her plain dark clothes, by the utter lack of spectacle. A low murmur of anticipation rippled through the auditorium. She reached the stool, sat, and adjusted the microphone. Her heart was a frantic drum against her ribs. She was terrifyingly, completely alone.\n\nShe took a breath. Then another. She let the silence stretch, a defiant act against the show\u2019s relentless pace. She looked down at the familiar grain of her guitar\u2019s wood, at her own hands resting on the strings. She wasn\u2019t a reality show contestant. She wasn\u2019t \u2018The Reclamation\u2019. She was Kaia Morehu from Greymouth. She was Deb and Brian\u2019s daughter. She was her Koro\u2019s moko. Her fingers, no longer trembling, found the first chord, a simple, questioning minor. She looked up, not into the camera, not into the crowd, but into the middle distance of the darkness, into memory. Her voice, when it came, was barely a whisper, so quiet that the entire theatre seemed to lean in to catch it. \u201cKoro, do you remember? Your hands were a road map, all river-lines and hills\u2026\u201d\n\nThe song began to unfold, not as a performance, but as a whispered story. She sang of small, specific things that could not be faked. She sang of the smell of his shed, a mix of sawdust and old oil. She sang of the way he tapped his pipe out on the heel of his boot. Her voice was fragile, threaded with an ache that was utterly real, yet it was clear and true. She felt a wobble, a moment where the sheer emotion of it threatened to choke her, where the reality of what she was doing \u2013 baring this wound in front of millions \u2013 almost broke her. But she closed her eyes again, and she wasn't on the stage. She was in the sterile, quiet hospital room, holding a hand that was growing cold. She was making a promise.\n\nHer voice found its strength, not in volume, but in certainty. The wairua flooded back, a warm tide against the coldness of her nerves. She reached the chorus, the melody that Julian had stolen and twisted into a power-pop hook. But as she sang it, it was transformed. It was a lament. \u201cYou said to take this memory, hold it like a stone,\u201d she sang, her voice rising, infused with a fierce, protective sorrow. \u201cAnd its weight would keep me grounded, when I felt alone.\u201d She looked directly into the lens of the main camera, her gaze unflinching. She wasn't just singing to the audience; she was speaking directly to him, wherever he was watching. She sang the lines he had corrupted, about grief being a song only she could hear, and in her voice was the clear, ringing truth of ownership. This was her pain. This was her story. He was just a thief who had tried to pawn a diamond he thought was glass.\n\nThe final verse was a farewell. Her voice soared, not with the strained power of a manufactured finale, but with the pure, unadorned power of love. It was a cry that echoed with generations of loss and remembrance, a sound that transcended the cheap theatrics of the show and became something elemental, something sacred. It filled every corner of the vast space, wrapping the audience in its profound sadness. Then, as quickly as it had swelled, her voice retreated, pulling back to a near-whisper for the final line, a quiet promise in te reo M\u0101ori. \u201cE kore e warewaretia.\u201d *You will not be forgotten.* She strummed one last, soft chord, letting the note hang in the air, her hand hovering over the strings until the sound decayed into absolute, perfect silence.\n\nThe silence was a living thing. It was heavier and more complete than any sound. It was a held breath, a shared moment of stunned reverence that bound every single person in the auditorium. No one coughed. No one cheered. No one moved. The silence stretched for one second, then two, then five. In the wing, Julian Vance\u2019s face was a mask of disbelief, the triumphant flush drained away, leaving a pasty, sickly white. He understood. In that one song, she had exposed him, judged him, and dismissed him more completely than any accusation could have done. She had taken back her truth, and in doing so, had revealed his emptiness to the world.\n\nThen, from the upper balcony, a single person began to clap. It was a slow, solitary sound. Then another joined, and another. It wasn't the explosive roar Julian had received. It was a wave of sound that started as a ripple and grew into a tidal wave of sustained, heartfelt applause. It was a sound of gratitude, of release, of respect. Kaia opened her eyes, tears blurring the lights. The whole room was on its feet. Amanda Holden was no longer just crying; she was sobbing, her face buried in her hands. David Walliams was staring at Kaia with open-mouthed awe. And Simon, the emperor of stone-faced disapproval, was sitting perfectly still, his face a mask of something Kaia had never seen on him before. It wasn't just being moved. It was respect. It was utter, unequivocal surrender. She had done it. She had sung for her Koro. And everyone had heard."

A man in a headset gave her a frantic thumbs-up from the wings, and the show\u2019s hosts, a duo of relentlessly cheerful men in sharp suits, walked towards her from the other side of the stage. One of them placed a gentle hand on her shoulder, a gesture that felt both grounding and surreal. Her entire body was trembling, a fine, high-frequency vibration of adrenaline and release.\n\n\u201cKaia Morehu, everybody!\u201d one of the hosts announced, his voice booming with manufactured bonhomie that for once felt entirely genuine. \u201cWow. Just\u2026 wow. Let\u2019s go to the judges. Amanda, you look like you need a moment.\u201d\n\nAll eyes swung to the judges\u2019 desk. Amanda Holden was dabbing at her mascara with a tissue, her face a beautiful wreck of emotion. She shook her head, taking a shaky breath. \u201cKaia, that wasn\u2019t a song. That was\u2026 that was a testimony. I think every single person in this room, in this country, who has ever lost someone felt that with you. It was so raw, and so brave, and so utterly, breathtakingly beautiful. You took all your pain and you turned it into something\u2026 healing. For all of us. Just incredible.\u201d\n\nKaia could only manage a choked, \u201cThank you,\u201d her own tears finally spilling over. The fourth judge, a flamboyant choreographer known for his effusive praise, was uncharacteristically subdued. He simply pressed his hands together as if in prayer and bowed his head slightly. \u201cArtistry,\u201d he said, his voice thick. \u201cPure, unadulterated artistry. In a competition full of fireworks, you were a solitary, perfect flame. And you lit up the entire room.\u201d\n\nThen it was Simon\u2019s turn. The cameras zoomed in on his face, the audience falling into a hushed, expectant silence. He hadn\u2019t moved. He was staring at her, his expression unreadable, his hands steepled under his chin. He let the silence hang for a beat, a master of television tension. \u201cWe see a lot of people on this stage,\u201d he began, his voice low and measured, devoid of its usual caustic bite. \u201cWe see ambition. We see desperation. We see a lot of very loud performers who are screaming to be noticed. And then, very, very rarely\u2026 someone comes on and has the courage to be quiet. Someone comes on and tells the truth.\u201d He paused, his eyes sweeping across the audience before locking back onto her. \u201cWhat you just did\u2026 it went beyond a competition. You reminded me, and I think everyone here, what music is actually for. It\u2019s not for fame, it\u2019s not for the prize money. It\u2019s for this. To communicate something real. You are, without question, the most authentic artist we have ever had on this stage.\u201d He leaned back, giving a single, decisive nod. \u201cAnd I hope you win.\u201d\n\nIt was the ultimate benediction. A roar went up from the crowd, a sound of absolute agreement. It felt like a coronation. One of the hosts squeezed her shoulder again. \u201cKaia Morehu. The phone lines are open. Go on, love. Go and get a cup of tea.\u201d He guided her off the stage, and as she stepped back into the shadows of the wing, the immense weight she had been carrying for the entire week, for three long years, simply lifted. Her legs gave a little buckle, and Liam was there, his arms catching her in a firm, steadying hug. \u201cYou did it,\u201d he whispered into her hair, his own voice thick with emotion. \u201cYou bloody well did it.\u201d\n\nShe was guided back towards the green room in a daze. The other finalists who were gathered in the corridor parted for her like she was royalty, their faces a mixture of awe and respect. The group of Manchester dancers all gave her solemn, heartfelt thumbs-ups. The magician, who had been nervously shuffling his cards, stopped and simply nodded at her, a look of profound understanding in his eyes. He dealt in illusion, and he knew a moment of pure truth when he saw it. From the corner of her eye, she saw Clarissa on her headset, her back to the wall. She wasn\u2019t looking at Kaia. She was looking at a monitor showing the live vote tally, and the smile on her face was one of pure, predatory triumph. Her gamble had paid off. The dynamite had gone off exactly as she\u2019d planned.\n\nBack in the cacophony of the green room, the atmosphere was electric. The television on the wall was playing a montage of the night\u2019s performances. When Julian\u2019s segment came on, his flashy stage presence, his perfect but hollow vocals, it looked like a caricature. After the raw intimacy of Kaia\u2019s song, his performance seemed loud, gaudy, and desperately empty. A few of the other contestants glanced around, a silent, shared acknowledgement of the contrast. Then her performance was replayed. The room fell quiet. On the screen, the small figure in the dark green shirt looked impossibly vulnerable and impossibly strong. The quiet notes of her guitar cut through the noise of the studio. No one spoke. In that moment, they weren't competitors; they were all just witnesses. Julian Vance was nowhere to be seen. He had not returned to the green room. His absence was a confession in itself.\n\nThe long, agonizing wait for the vote to close began. Kaia sat on a sofa between Chloe, the dancer, and the kind-faced magician, a mug of sweet, milky tea warming her hands. She finally dared to look at her phone. It was unusable, a frantic, vibrating brick of notifications. Texts from friends she hadn't spoken to in years. Hundreds of social media alerts. A missed call from \u2018Mum and Dad\u2019. A wave of love and longing washed over her. The outcome of the vote suddenly felt like a footnote. She had walked through the fire and come out the other side. She had sung her song, for her Koro, and she had done it on her own terms. The rest was just noise. She put the phone down, took a sip of her tea, and for the first time in a week, she felt a sense of peace settle deep in her bones.\n\n\u201cAll finalists to the stage! Results are in! Two minutes!\u201d The stage manager\u2019s voice cut through the nervous chatter. The moment was here. The final ten acts filed out of the green room and lined up across the back of the enormous stage. The lights were hot, the roar of the crowd was deafening, but the terror was gone. Kaia found herself standing next to Chloe again, and they instinctively held hands, their fingers laced together in a pact of mutual support. The hosts stood centre stage, holding the sacred envelope. \u201cThe votes have been counted and verified,\u201d one of them announced, his voice ringing with theatrical gravity. \u201cI can now reveal the act finishing in third place is\u2026 The Morrison Family Strings!\u201d A round of applause, a few gracious smiles and disappointed tears, and the family of musicians took their bow.\n\nIt was down to two. The hosts milked the moment, striding back and forth, recapping the journey of the final acts. The cameras cut between Kaia\u2019s pale, composed face and the hopeful, nervous faces of the Manchester dance troupe. The entire auditorium was on its feet, a sea of flickering phone screens and chanting fans. \u201cIt\u2019s time,\u201d the host said, finally opening the envelope. \u201cThe winner of Britain\u2019s Got Talent 2023\u2026 the act you have chosen\u2026 is\u2026\u201d He paused, his eyes scanning the slip of paper. The world seemed to stop. The roar of the crowd, the thumping music, her own frantic heartbeat\u2014it all faded into a distant hum. She felt Chloe squeeze her hand, hard.\n\n\u201c...Kaia Morehu!\u201d\n\nThe name echoed in the vast space, and for a second, it didn't register. It was just a sound. Then Chloe let out a shriek of joy and threw her arms around her. The stage erupted in a shower of gold confetti and soaring music. The dancers were hugging her, the hosts were patting her back, and the sound of the crowd was a physical force, a wall of pure joy pressing in on her from all sides. She saw Simon on his feet, clapping, a genuine, unrestrained smile on his face. She saw Liam in the wings, openly weeping with pride. She saw her own face on the giant screen behind the stage, streaked with tears and covered in glittering gold paper, a look of pure, uncomprehending shock staring back at her. Her. Kaia Morehu from Greymouth. The girl with the second-hand guitar and a song about her grandfather. It was insane. It was impossible. It was happening."

The air, once electric with tension, was now thick with celebration, the confetti sticking to her tear-damp cheeks and catching in her dark hair. Chloe and the rest of the dance troupe enveloped her in a joyous, multi-limbed hug, their collective excitement lifting her off her feet. The music swelled, a triumphant orchestral piece that felt ridiculously grand, a soundtrack for a life she didn\u2019t recognise as her own. The hosts thrust a heavy glass trophy into her hands, its sharp edges cool and solid against her trembling fingers. It was the only thing that felt real. Her mind was a static-filled television screen, unable to process the sheer volume of input. Winner. The word was too big, too bright. It refused to fit into the small, carefully constructed reality of her life.\n\n\u201cOne more time for your winner, Kaia Morehu!\u201d one of the hosts bellowed into his microphone, his voice echoing through the ecstatic arena. A stagehand, his face beaming, quickly placed her guitar back in her hands, its familiar weight a profound comfort. They guided her back to the stool, which was now covered in a fine layer of gold dust, a tiny throne in the centre of the universe. The lights dimmed once more, the crowd noise softening to a reverent, expectant hum. She was supposed to sing again. How could she? The song had been a vessel for so much pain, anger, and defiance. It had been her shield and her sword. But now, looking out at the sea of faces, at the thousands of tiny lights from their phones held aloft like modern-day candles, she understood. It wasn't just her song anymore. It belonged to them now, to everyone who had listened and understood.\n\nWhen she played the first chord this time, it felt different. It was no longer a question, but an answer. Her voice, when it came, was no longer a whisper of private grief but a quiet anthem of public remembrance. She sang with a new sense of peace, her voice soaring not in defiance, but in celebration of a life, a memory, and a love that had, against all odds, connected her to millions. This time, when she reached the final, whispered line in te reo M\u0101ori, her voice didn't waver. It was strong, clear, and full of a love that was no longer sharp with loss, but burnished with gratitude. This time, when she finished, she wasn't alone in her tears. The whole room felt like a vigil, a beautiful, shared moment of catharsis under the television lights.\n\nThe moment she stepped off stage, the true chaos began. It was a human tidal wave. Press officers, photographers, producers, and well-wishers surged towards her. Flashes popped, momentarily blinding her. Microphones were thrust in her face, their foam covers smelling of stale breath, the questions fired at her like pellets. \"How does it feel?\" \"What will you do with the money?\" \"A message for your fans back home?\" She mumbled answers, her brain still buffering, the words feeling clumsy and inadequate. Clarissa appeared out of the throng, her sharp blazer immaculate amidst the joyous chaos. She didn't hug Kaia; she grasped her firmly by the shoulders, her eyes blazing with an intensity that was almost frightening. \"You did it,\" she said, her voice a low, thrilling hiss. \"You magnificent girl, you actually did it. We have a star.\" It wasn't a congratulations; it was a confirmation of a successful product launch. Liam rescued her again, forming a protective barrier and steering her through the labyrinthine corridors towards the relative sanctity of her dressing room, fending off the swarming press with a polite but firm, \"She needs a moment, folks. Give her five minutes.\"\n\nInside the small, stark room, the trophy sat glinting on the makeup counter next to her discarded teacup. Her phone lay on the table, still vibrating itself into a furious spasm. It was the first thing she reached for. Ignoring the hundreds of notifications from social media, she scrolled to \u2018Mum and Dad\u2019 and hit the call button, her heart thudding a new, wild rhythm against her ribs. It was the middle of the morning in Greymouth. They would know. They must have been watching. The phone was answered on the first ring, the sound so immediate it made her jump. It wasn't a hello. It was a roar. Her dad\u2019s voice, so full of pure, unadulterated joy it was practically incoherent. \"SHE DID IT! DEB, SHE DID IT! YOU LITTLE RIPPER! YOU DID IT!\" Kaia burst into a fresh wave of tears, but this time they were tears of laughter, of pure, unbottled happiness. \"Dad!\" she gasped, laughing and crying at the same time. \"Mum? Are you there?\" \"We're here, darling!\" her mum's voice came on the line, cracking with emotion. \"Oh, Kaia. We're so proud, so unbelievably proud. The whole street is here! Your Uncle Barry is setting off fireworks in the garden, I think he's going to set fire to the feijoa hedge! Oh, darling, you were just\u2026 you were perfect.\" She could hear the party in the background \u2013 cheers, whistles, her dad yelling \"That's my girl!\" to anyone who would listen. The sound, fuzzy and distant and chaotic, was the most beautiful thing she had ever heard. It was the sound of home, celebrating.\n\nHours later, she was finally alone. Not in her cold little flatshare, which already felt like a relic from another lifetime, but in the back of a black car with tinted windows, speeding through the deserted streets of late-night London. Liam had arranged a room for her in a quiet hotel, a temporary haven from the storm that was now her life. The city lights blurred into long streaks of colour as they passed. The heavy glass trophy sat on the seat beside her, a silent, glittering passenger. She touched its smooth surface, tracing the engraved letters of her name. Kaia Morehu. It was real. The prize money, a quarter of a million pounds, was a number so large it was abstract, meaningless. The record deal with Simon Cowell's label, the performance at the Royal Variety Show \u2013 they were just words, concepts her exhausted mind couldn't yet grasp. She leaned her head against the cool glass of the window, watching the sleeping city slide by. She had come here with a beat-up guitar, a student visa, and a quiet, persistent ache of homesickness. She had sung her truth into the void, and the void had sung back. The future, which had once seemed like a narrow, uncertain path, was now a vast, uncharted ocean, stretching out before her under a sky full of stars. For the first time, she wasn't afraid of drowning. She was ready to set sail."

                                        "text": "She woke to silence. Not the thin, porous silence of her flatshare, which was always filled with the ghosts of sound \u2013 a neighbour\u2019s muffled television, the groaning pipes, the distant wail of a siren \u2013 but a deep, absolute, soundproofed silence. For a single, blissful second, her mind was a blank slate. She was just Kaia, in a bed, somewhere in London. Then, she turned her head. On the polished mahogany of the bedside table, bathed in a sliver of morning light filtering through a gap in the heavy blackout curtains, sat the trophy. It wasn't a dream. Her breath hitched. The entire night came rushing back not as a memory, but as a full-body sensation: the blinding lights, the golden confetti raining down, the bone-shaking roar of the crowd, the impossible weight of the glass trophy in her hands. She was the winner of Britain\u2019s Got Talent.\n\nA hysterical little laugh bubbled up from her chest. She sat up, clutching the impossibly soft, high-thread-count duvet to her chin, and looked around. The hotel room was bigger than her entire flat. It was a landscape of tasteful neutrals: cream carpets, mushroom-coloured walls, a minimalist armchair in the corner. A floor-to-ceiling window overlooked a panoramic view of the waking city. It was beautiful, luxurious, and felt about as personal as a page in an architectural magazine. It was a world away from the peeling poster of the T\u016b\u012b and the precarious stack of textbooks that had been the backdrop to her life only yesterday. She felt like an imposter, a child playing dress-up in her mother's expensive clothes. The buzzing of her phone on the nightstand brought her crashing back to the present. It was Liam.\n\n\u201cMorning, superstar,\u201d his voice was cheerful, but sounded as tired as she felt. \u201cSleep at all?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d Kaia answered honestly, her voice thick. \u201cI think I might have just passed out for a few hours. Is it\u2026 is it real, Liam?\u201d\n\nHe chuckled, a warm, reassuring sound. \u201cIt\u2019s real, Kaia. Take a look at any news website in the world right now. You\u2019re on all of them. Listen, the car will be there to pick you up in ninety minutes. We\u2019ve got the big one first: the \u2018This Morning\u2019 show. Then a string of radio interviews, a photoshoot for the paper, and a preliminary meeting at the label with Simon\u2019s people at four. It\u2019s going to be a full-on day, but we\u2019ll get through it. How are you feeling, honestly?\u201d\n\n\u201cLike I\u2019ve been struck by lightning,\u201d she whispered, her eyes wide as she took in the schedule. \u201cLiam, what do I even say on a morning show?\u201d\n\n\u201cJust be you. That\u2019s what they all fell in love with,\u201d he said kindly. \u201cI\u2019ll be there, right by the side of the set. Just look for me if you get lost. I\u2019ll meet you in the lobby. And Kaia? You earned this.\u201d\n\nAfter she hung up, a morbid curiosity got the better of her. She picked up the sleek hotel tablet and opened a news browser. Liam wasn't exaggerating. Her face was everywhere. A rain-soaked, confetti-dusted photo of her crying with joy was the lead image on the BBC News homepage. \u2018Kiwi Songbird Wins Nation\u2019s Heart\u2019 screamed one headline. \u2018From Obscurity to Overnight Sensation: The Kaia Morehu Story\u2019 declared another. She scrolled through the articles, a dizzying collage of praise, speculation, and hastily compiled biographical details. They mentioned Greymouth, her parents, her semi-final performance of \u2018P\u014dkarekare Ana\u2019. Then she found what she was subconsciously looking for. A smaller, secondary article in one of the tabloids. \u2018What Happened to Julian Vance? Golden Boy Disappears After Shock Final Defeat\u2019. The piece detailed his \"uncharacteristically flat\" final performance and his \"hasty exit\" from the studios, noting he had been uncontactable since the result. There was no mention of the song theft, no hint of the real story, but the narrative was clear even in its absence. She had been David, and he had been Goliath. The world didn't know the specifics, but it had sensed the truth.\n\nJust as she was processing the strange, hollow victory of seeing his public downfall, her phone rang again. The screen flashed with a number she didn\u2019t recognise, but she knew instinctively who it was. She took a deep breath and answered. \u201cHello?\u201d\n\n\u201cKaia, it\u2019s Clarissa. Congratulations on a spectacular result. The numbers are astronomical. You\u2019ve broken records.\u201d There was no warmth, no pleasantry. This was business. Clarissa was no longer a producer; she was a general surveying her victory. \u201cI\u2019ve spoken to the team at \u2018This Morning\u2019. They\u2019re running your win as their lead story. They\u2019re dedicating a whole segment to you. We need to prep. They want the whole story. Your grandfather. The academy. The moment you heard Julian sing your song. The decision to reclaim it in the final. We need to hit every beat. It\u2019s the narrative that sold you, Kaia. We need to lock it down.\u201d\n\nKaia\u2019s blood ran cold. The beautiful, private act of remembrance she had shared last night was now being referred to as a series of \u2018beats\u2019 in a \u2018narrative\u2019. It was a script to be performed on cue. \u201cClarissa,\u201d she began, choosing her words carefully. \u201cI\u2026 I sang the song. The story is in the song. I don\u2019t know if I can just\u2026 talk about it. Not like that. Not on a morning chat show.\u201d\n\nA beat of icy silence on the other end of the line. \u201cKaia,\u201d Clarissa said, her voice dropping, losing its clipped efficiency and gaining a sharp, dangerous edge. \u201cYour authenticity is your brand. That story is now your biggest asset. People don\u2019t just buy the music; they buy the story behind it. This is your one shot to cement that story in the public consciousness. We need to strike while the iron is hot. Tears are not a problem. In fact, they\u2019re a bonus. Be authentic. Be vulnerable. Be the girl who won.\u201d\n\nThe call ended with Clarissa giving her a list of talking points, each one feeling like a small betrayal of her Koro\u2019s memory. Kaia sank back onto the huge, impersonal bed, the luxurious sheets suddenly feeling like a silken trap. The joy of the win was already being tainted, packaged, and commodified. She thought of her tiny room in the flatshare, of the instant noodles she\u2019d been eating just two days ago. There was a room service menu on the desk, offering truffle-infused eggs and artisanal avocado toast. Her stomach churned. She didn't want any of it. She wanted the simple, uncomplicated reality of her old life, a life where her grief was her own, not a marketing tool. The future that had seemed like a vast ocean last night now looked like a series of treacherous, narrow channels, with pirates like Clarissa waiting at every turn. In ninety minutes, she would be back in the machine. She took a deep, shuddering breath. This was the first test. She won the competition by staying true to herself. The real fight, she was beginning to realise, was just beginning."

                                        "text": "The ninety minutes evaporated in a flurry of alien activity. A woman with a kind face and a rack of designer clothes appeared at her door, sent by the label to ensure she was \u2018camera-ready\u2019. Kaia, who usually defined \u2018ready\u2019 as clean jeans and a brushed ponytail, found herself being gently steered into a chair while another woman applied foundation to her face with a soft brush. She felt like a doll being prepped for display. She politely refused the suggested silk blouse and tailored trousers, opting instead for her own dark jeans, comfortable boots, and the pounamu-green shirt she had won in. It was her armour, and she wasn't ready to take it off. As she was whisked through the hotel lobby, a small crowd of guests and staff applauded, some holding up their phones to take pictures. It was a strange, disorienting experience, like walking through someone else\u2019s dream.\n\nLiam was waiting by the gleaming black car, his familiar, kind face a welcome anchor in the swirling sea of newness. He opened the door for her, and she slid into the cool leather interior. As they pulled away from the kerb and into the flow of London traffic, he glanced at her in the rear-view mirror. He didn\u2019t need to be a mind reader to see the tension etched around her eyes. \u201cClarissa call you?\u201d he asked quietly, his gaze flicking back to the road. Kaia just nodded, her throat tight. \u201cLet me guess,\u201d he continued, his tone wry. \u201cShe wanted you to hit the \u2018narrative beats\u2019. Cry on cue. Give them the soundbites.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe called my grief an asset,\u201d Kaia said, the words tasting foul. \u201cShe wants me to sell it, Liam. She wants me to turn my Koro into a sob story for morning television.\u201d She looked out the window, at the blur of red buses and historic buildings. The city seemed indifferent to her turmoil, a vast machine grinding on regardless.\n\nLiam was silent for a block, navigating a tricky turn. \u201cKaia,\u201d he said finally, his voice serious. \u201cYou\u2019re going to meet a lot of people like Clarissa. They see artists as products, and stories as marketing angles. They\u2019re not all bad people; they\u2019re just playing a different game. But you don\u2019t have to play it their way. They\u2019ll push, and they\u2019ll demand, but at the end of the day, you are the one on that sofa. You are the one with the microphone. They can\u2019t put words in your mouth.\u201d He paused, catching her eye in the mirror again. \u201cAnswer the question you want to answer, not the one they ask. You have more power than you think.\u201d\n\nHis words didn\u2019t magically solve the problem, but they planted a seed of resolve. He was right. She wasn\u2019t a puppet. The studio that housed \u2018This Morning\u2019 was besieged. A throng of paparazzi and fans pressed against metal barriers, a roaring, clamouring wall of sound and flashing lights. The car slowed, and for a terrifying moment, Kaia was the sole focus of a hundred lenses, the flashes popping like miniature starbursts. Liam put a protective hand on her arm as a security guard opened the door, and they were hustled inside, the noise of the crowd abruptly cut off as the heavy studio doors swung shut behind them. The contrast was jarring. The outside world was chaos; inside, it was a brightly lit, air-conditioned maze of corridors, bustling with people in headsets moving with urgent, practiced efficiency.\n\nThe green room was an oasis of calm, furnished with plush sofas and a table laden with pastries and fresh fruit. The show\u2019s hosts, a famously charming husband-and-wife duo, greeted her with warm hugs and genuine congratulations. They were exactly as they appeared on television: polished, professional, and radiating an effortless warmth that immediately put her at ease. But her momentary comfort evaporated when Clarissa swept into the room, her presence sucking the air out of it. She was dressed in a severe grey suit, her face a mask of focus. She bypassed the hosts with a curt nod and came straight to Kaia. \u201cFive minutes,\u201d she said, her voice a low command. \u201cRemember the key points. The emotion is the story. Don\u2019t be afraid to show it. The public needs to connect.\u201d She gave Kaia a pointed, meaningful look, a director giving her star one final, crucial note before the curtain went up.\n\nWalking onto the set was surreal. The iconic sofa, the view of the Thames through the studio window, the bright, friendly lighting \u2013 it was all so familiar, yet seeing it in person made her feel like she had stepped through her television screen. She sat down, the sofa even more comfortable than it looked, and tried to quiet the frantic thrumming of her own heart. The floor manager counted down, the theme music swelled, and suddenly they were live, the hosts\u2019 smiles brightening by an extra ten percent. The first part of the interview was a gentle warm-up. They talked about the moment she won, the confetti, the call to her parents. Kaia found her rhythm, her answers simple and honest, her natural Kiwi understatement earning a few warm laughs from the crew. She spoke of her parents\u2019 party, of her Uncle Barry and the feijoa hedge, painting a picture of home that felt warm and real.\n\nThen, as Liam had predicted, the conversation pivoted. The male host\u2019s expression became more serious, his tone more intimate. \u201cKaia, your winning song was one of the most powerful moments we\u2019ve ever witnessed on television. We know it\u2019s deeply personal. Can you tell us the story behind it?\u201d This was it. The moment of truth. She could feel Clarissa\u2019s will bearing down on her from the wings. She could almost hear her voice: *Hit the beats. Show the emotion.* She thought of her grandfather\u2019s hands, the lines like a road map. She thought of his quiet dignity. A wave of calm washed over her. She knew what she had to do.\n\nShe took a breath, meeting the host\u2019s sympathetic gaze with a quiet strength. \u201cIt was for my Koro, my grandfather,\u201d she began, her voice steady. \u201cHe passed away a few years ago, and he was\u2026 he was the heart of our family. A very kind, very strong, very private man.\u201d She paused, offering a small, sad smile. \u201cWriting the song was my way of talking to him, of holding onto his memory. And I think\u2026 I think the song itself says everything I could possibly say about him, and about what he meant to me. It\u2019s all in the music.\u201d\n\nThe female host, sensing a story being withheld, gently pushed. \u201cThere have been reports, stories about your time at a music academy\u2026 about the song having a difficult history. About another contestant.\u201d She left the accusation hanging in the air, an invitation for drama. Kaia felt a flicker of the old anger, but she pushed it down. Giving it oxygen would mean letting it define her. \u201cThere are always stories in this business, aren't there?\u201d she said, her tone polite but firm, offering a gentle deflection instead of a confrontation. \u201cMy journey to get here was a long one, with ups and downs like anyone else's. But what matters, to me, is that on that final night, I got to sing my song, my way, for my Koro. It felt like I was giving his memory back its dignity. And I\u2019d like to keep it that way.\u201d She looked directly into the camera, not with the tearful vulnerability Clarissa had demanded, but with a clear, unwavering gaze. \u201cHe deserves that.\u201d\n\nIt was a masterclass in quiet defiance. She hadn\u2019t been rude, she hadn\u2019t been difficult, but she had drawn an unmistakable line. She had refused to perform her grief. She had honored her grandfather\u2019s memory on her own terms. A brief, almost imperceptible flicker of confusion passed between the hosts, who had been expecting a very different kind of television moment. But they were professionals. The female host gave a respectful nod. \u201cBeautifully said, Kaia. A truly wonderful tribute.\u201d They moved on, talking about the record deal, the Royal Variety Performance, the bright future ahead. When the segment ended and the show cut to a commercial break, the crew burst into applause. The hosts hugged her again, this time with a new level of respect in their eyes.\n\nAs she was guided off the set, she saw Liam. He wasn't smiling. He was beaming, his face shining with a pride so profound it almost made her want to cry. \u201cThat,\u201d he mouthed, \u201cwas brilliant.\u201d But a few feet away, leaning against a wall with her arms crossed, was Clarissa. The mask was gone. Her face was tight with a cold, controlled fury. As Kaia approached, she pushed herself off the wall. \u201cThat was not what we discussed,\u201d she said, her voice dangerously low, each word a chip of ice. \u201cYou had a nation in the palm of your hand, and you gave them a polite deflection. You left the best part of the story on the table.\u201d\n\nKaia stopped, the adrenaline of the interview giving her a courage she didn't know she possessed. She met the producer\u2019s furious gaze without flinching. \u201cYou told me to be authentic, Clarissa,\u201d she said, her voice as quiet and steady as it had been on the sofa. \u201cThat was me. Being authentic.\u201d She didn\u2019t wait for a response. She simply turned and walked away, following Liam down the corridor, leaving Clarissa standing alone in the shadows of the set, her perfect narrative in tatters. The air outside the studio felt fresh and clean. The paparazzi were still there, but their shouting seemed distant and unimportant. For the first time since that phone call in the pre-dawn gloom, Kaia felt the solid ground beneath her feet. She had faced the machine and hadn\u2019t backed down. The war was far from over, but she had just won the first, most important battle."

For several minutes, Liam simply drove, his hands steady on the wheel, allowing Kaia the space to breathe. The world outside the tinted windows rushed by in a muted, disconnected stream. She felt wrung out, a damp cloth that had been twisted until every drop of emotion was gone. The confrontation with Clarissa, though brief, had taken a greater toll than the entire live interview. Clarissa\u2019s cold fury was the face of the machine she had just defied, a machine that was supposed to be on her side. Liam finally broke the silence, his voice gentle. \u201cFor what it\u2019s worth, what you did back there\u2026 that was the bravest thing I\u2019ve seen anyone do in this industry in a long time. It\u2019s easy to cry on command, Kaia. It\u2019s hard to have dignity.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s furious,\u201d Kaia murmured, staring at her own reflection in the dark glass. \u201cShe thinks I\u2019m throwing it all away.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe thinks in terms of assets and marketing strategies. You think in terms of people and respect. Don\u2019t ever apologise for that,\u201d he said firmly. He took a corner, his expression growing more serious. \u201cJust be ready. She\u2019ll have gotten to the label before we do. She\u2019ll paint you as difficult, uncooperative, naive. She\u2019ll say you don\u2019t understand the business. This afternoon\u2019s meeting at Syco\u2026 it\u2019s going to be tough. They\u2019re not your friendly neighbourhood TV producers anymore. This is the big league.\u201d\n\nSyco Entertainment\u2019s headquarters was a monument to modern, minimalist power. It was a sleek glass-and-steel tower in West London, a world away from the charmingly chaotic television studios. The lobby was a vast, echoing space of polished concrete floors and stark white walls, dominated by a reception desk that looked like a fragment of a meteor. The only warmth came from the gallery of framed gold and platinum discs that lined the corridor, a silent, glittering testament to the hit-making power of the empire Simon Cowell had built. Each frame represented a life changed, a career launched, a fortune made. Staring at the names \u2013 Leona Lewis, One Direction, Susan Boyle \u2013 Kaia felt an acute sense of vertigo. Her own name felt impossibly small and foreign in this place. She clutched her guitar case, the worn handle a familiar, earthy anchor in this sterile, stratospheric environment.\n\nThe boardroom was on a high floor, with a panoramic view of the city that made the world below look like a toy set. A long, dark table, polished to a mirror shine, reflected the grey London sky. Three people were already seated. At the head of the table sat a man in his late fifties with silver hair and an impeccably tailored suit, his face a mask of calm, shrewd intelligence. This, Liam had briefed her, was Richard Holloway, Simon\u2019s most trusted executive, the man who ran the label day-to-day. To his right sat a younger woman with a severe haircut and an intense, analytical gaze, her laptop already open. And to his left, her posture rigid, sat Clarissa. Her earlier fury had been replaced by a chillingly professional composure, but her eyes, when they met Kaia\u2019s, were like chips of ice. Richard stood as they entered, his smile polite but lacking warmth. \u201cKaia. Richard Holloway. On behalf of Simon and all of us at Syco, congratulations. A remarkable achievement.\u201d\n\nThe pleasantries were brief. Once Kaia and Liam were seated, Richard got straight to the point, his tone brisk and business-like. \u201cWe\u2019re all incredibly excited. The momentum is unprecedented. We need to move quickly to capitalize on it. The plan is to have a single out in three weeks, with the full album to follow six weeks after that, to hit the Christmas market. It\u2019s an aggressive schedule, but the appetite is there.\u201d The young woman, whose name was Zara, tapped at her laptop. \u201cWe\u2019ve already compiled a list of potential lead singles. Power ballads from some of the top writers in Sweden and L.A. We\u2019re thinking a big, anthemic track. Something that showcases the voice, but with a familiar structure. Proven hit-makers. Guaranteed radio appeal.\u201d She slid a sheet of paper across the table. It was another list, much like the one Kaia had been shown for the final. It was a menu of expertly crafted, emotionally generic songs.\n\nClarissa chose that moment to speak, her voice smooth and laced with poison. \u201cOf course, a key part of the strategy is consolidating Kaia\u2019s brand narrative. Her authenticity is her key selling point. Unfortunately, we had a slight\u2026 missed opportunity this morning.\u201d She looked at Richard. \u201cKaia was hesitant to share the more compelling, personal aspects of her story on national television. She felt it was too private.\u201d The implication was clear: *the asset is refusing to be monetized*. Richard\u2019s gaze shifted to Kaia, his expression unreadable. \u201cIs that so?\u201d\n\nThe boardroom seemed to shrink, the air growing thick and heavy. All three of them were looking at her, waiting. It was a test. \u201cMy song is personal,\u201d Kaia said, her voice quiet but clear, echoing Liam\u2019s advice in her head. \u201cThe story, the real story, is woven into the music. I think that\u2019s what people connected with. And I believe they\u2019ll connect with other songs I write, about other parts of my life.\u201d She took a breath, steeling herself. \u201cI\u2019m a songwriter, Richard. That\u2019s who I am. My vision for the album is\u2026 one I write myself. Or at least, co-write. I want to tell my own stories.\u201d\n\nZara, the analyst, let out a short, sharp sigh, as if Kaia had said something profoundly naive. \u201cOriginal compositions are a high-risk proposition for a debut artist, even a BGT winner,\u201d she said, her tone condescendingly patient. \u201cThe audience knows you through the filter of the show. We need to ease them in with familiar sounds. A full album of unknown, original material\u2026 it\u2019s a commercial gamble. We\u2019d be looking at a fraction of the projected sales.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith respect,\u201d Kaia countered, her confidence growing as she spoke her truth, \u201cthe biggest \u2018gamble\u2019 of the whole competition was me singing an original song about my grandfather in the final. A quiet song, in a big arena. It wasn\u2019t a power ballad. It wasn\u2019t a cover. It was just real. And it won.\u201d The silence that followed was heavy with her challenge. She had used their own success against them, and they didn\u2019t like it.\n\nRichard Holloway leaned back in his chair, steepling his fingers. He looked from Kaia to Clarissa, then back to Kaia. The polite mask had dropped, revealing the hardened executive beneath. \u201cYour win was a wonderful television moment, Kaia. A perfect story. But television moments don't always translate into album sales. Our job is to mitigate risk and maximize profit. We have a formula that works. It has worked for over a decade. We are offering you that formula.\u201d He leaned forward again, his voice dropping to a low, paternal tone that was more threatening than any shout. \u201cYou are a very talented young woman. But you are now part of a multi-million-pound business. I suggest you take some time to think about the big picture. Think about what it is you really want. We\u2019ll send the demos over to your hotel.\u201d The meeting was over. He had dismissed her as if she were a recalcitrant child.\n\nBack in the hushed, leather-scented interior of the car, the adrenaline drained away, leaving a hollow, aching exhaustion. Kaia stared blankly at the passing streets, her mind replaying the meeting. They hadn\u2019t listened. They hadn't heard a word she\u2019d said. They had already decided who she was going to be: a voice for hire, a singer of other people's songs, her own stories relegated to a quaint, uncommercial hobby. She had won the competition, but she had lost control of her own future. A profound, crushing wave of doubt washed over her. Maybe they were right. Maybe she was just a naive girl from a small town who didn't understand how the world worked. Maybe she should just be grateful, shut up, and sing the Swedish power ballads. The alternative was to fight, and to risk being labelled \u2018difficult\u2019, to be shelved, to lose everything she had just gained. The weight of the choice was suffocating.\n\nLiam glanced at her, his brow furrowed with concern. \u201cDon\u2019t let them get to you. That was round one. They were trying to intimidate you.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt worked,\u201d she whispered, her voice barely audible. Her phone buzzed in her pocket. She ignored it, too weary to face another congratulatory message that felt like a lie. It buzzed again, insistent. With a sigh, she pulled it out, expecting another pointless alert. It was a message from her Dad. There was no text, just a single, slightly blurry photo. It was a picture of their back garden in Greymouth. In the centre of the frame was the feijoa hedge, a large section of which was blackened and smoking slightly. Standing beside it, covered in soot but grinning from ear to ear, was her Uncle Barry, giving a triumphant double thumbs-up. Kaia stared at the ridiculous, wonderful, chaotic image. She thought of her dad, taking the time to send her this. This small, hilarious, tangible piece of her home. It was a reminder of the world she came from, a world of beautiful imperfections, of flawed, loving people, of stories that were messy and real. It was everything the polished, perfect, soulless world of the Syco boardroom was not. A small, shaky smile touched her lips. She knew what she was fighting for.\n\nShe was still looking at the photo when her phone buzzed one more time. This time, it wasn't a message from a friend or family member. It was a text from a number she didn't recognise. Her heart gave a nervous lurch. The message contained only a single, terrifying line.\n\n*Simon Cowell would like a word. My office. Now.*"

Not more from Clarissa?\u201d Kaia wordlessly handed him the phone, her hand trembling slightly. He took it, his eyes scanning the single line of text. His professional composure, the calm mask of the seasoned Artist Liaison, dissolved in an instant. A low whistle escaped his lips. \u201cBloody hell,\u201d he breathed, looking from the phone to Kaia and back again. He didn't have to ask who it was from. There was only one person in this building who could send a message like that, a royal summons that bypassed all chains of command. \u201cHe wants to see you. Now.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs this\u2026 is this bad?\u201d Kaia asked, her voice small. \u201cAm I being fired before I\u2019ve even started?\u201d\n\n\u201cFired? No. People like us get fired by email from HR. You don\u2019t get fired by a personal summons to the top floor,\u201d Liam said, his mind clearly racing. He was already turning the car around at the next intersection, heading back towards the glass tower they had just escaped. \u201cThis is either very, very good, or very, very bad. There\u2019s no in-between with him. He\u2019s either seen your interview and is going to tear you to shreds for disobeying Clarissa, or\u2026\u201d he trailed off, glancing at her in the mirror, \u201cor he\u2019s seen your interview and he\u2019s impressed. Either way, this is above my pay grade. Above everyone\u2019s pay grade.\u201d The drive back was a short, silent eternity. Kaia\u2019s stomach was a tangled knot of dread and a tiny, fluttering moth of hope. She had defied his generals. Now she was being called to answer to the emperor himself.\n\nThe journey to his office was an ascent into a different world. They took a private elevator, accessed with a special keycard from the formidable assistant who guarded his outer sanctum. The assistant, a woman with the serene, unshakeable calm of a bomb disposal expert, had simply nodded at them and pointed towards a set of unmarked double doors at the end of a quiet, art-filled corridor. Unlike the bustling, open-plan offices on the lower floors, the air up here was still and rarefied, the silence broken only by the whisper of the air conditioning and the soft tread of their feet on the plush, dove-grey carpet. It felt less like an office and more like the entrance to a private temple. Liam stopped outside the double doors, his role as guide ending here. \u201cThis is you, Kaia,\u201d he said, his voice a low whisper. \u201cRemember what I said. You have more power than you think. Just breathe.\u201d He gave her a final, encouraging nod, then retreated, leaving her utterly alone.\n\nTaking a breath that did nothing to calm the frantic hummingbird in her chest, she pushed the heavy door open and stepped inside. Simon Cowell\u2019s office was not what she expected. It wasn't a mahogany-panelled shrine to his own success. It was stark, modern, and overwhelmingly white. One entire wall was a floor-to-ceiling window offering a god-like, panoramic view of London. Another wall was a bank of silent, high-definition television screens, displaying a dozen different news channels and music video networks from around the world. He wasn\u2019t sitting behind a huge, imposing desk. He was standing by the window, his back to her, a slim black silhouette against the sprawling grey city. He wore his signature simple black t-shirt and jeans. He didn\u2019t turn around. \u201cClose the door,\u201d he said, his voice quiet but carrying an unmistakable authority that filled the large room. Kaia did as she was told, the door clicking shut behind her with a soft, final sound. The silence stretched. He was making her wait, a classic, simple exertion of power. She stood awkwardly in the middle of the vast white carpet, her guitar case held in front of her like a shield, feeling like a misplaced piece of luggage.\n\nFinally, he turned. His face, so familiar from television, was different in person. Less a caricature, more a study in controlled intensity. The lines around his eyes were deeper, his gaze sharper and more piercing than any camera could capture. There was no trace of the bored TV judge. This was a man who had built an empire from nothing, and every inch of him radiated that formidable intelligence and will. \u201cRichard Holloway tells me you don\u2019t want to be a pop star,\u201d he began, his voice calm, direct, cutting straight through the noise. \u201cHe tells me you\u2019re a songwriter. An artist. And that you think you know better than a team that has sold over two hundred million albums.\u201d\n\nKaia\u2019s mouth went dry. This was it. The dressing-down. But the memory of the smoking feijoa hedge, the image of her Uncle Barry\u2019s stupid, triumphant grin, flashed in her mind. It was an anchor to her own world, a world he couldn\u2019t touch. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I said,\u201d she managed, her voice steadier than she expected. \u201cI said I want to sing my own songs. I am a pop star, I guess. But I\u2019m a songwriter first. The reason I\u2019m standing in your office right now is because I sang my own song. A song your team told me was a commercial risk.\u201d\n\nA flicker of something \u2013 surprise? respect? \u2013 crossed his face before it was gone. He walked slowly towards the centre of the room, circling her as if inspecting a racehorse. \u201cWhat you did in the final was a moment of television magic. It was a beautiful story. It won you the show,\u201d he said, stopping in front of her. \u201cBut the music business isn\u2019t about moments. It\u2019s about momentum. It\u2019s about product. Zara and Richard want to give you a product that is guaranteed to sell. A Whitney Houston-style ballad. It\u2019s a proven formula. It\u2019s the safe bet.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a safe bet,\u201d Kaia said, her chin lifting slightly. \u201cI never have been. I was the girl from New Zealand singing a M\u0101ori love song in the semi-final. I was the girl singing a quiet song about grief when everyone else was setting off fireworks. Being safe isn\u2019t what got me here.\u201d\n\nHe stared at her for a long, unblinking moment, his eyes searching hers, looking for a weakness, a crack in the facade. She held his gaze, her heart hammering but her resolve hardening with every second that passed. She had nothing left to lose. \u201cNo,\u201d he said finally, a slow, grudging admission. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t.\u201d He gestured to one of the plush white sofas. \u201cSit down.\u201d She perched on the edge of the sofa, placing her guitar case carefully on the floor beside her. He remained standing, pacing in front of the vast window. \u201cClarissa believes you\u2019re being naive. Richard believes you\u2019re being difficult. Zara believes you are statistically a poor investment.\u201d He delivered these blows without malice, stating them as simple facts. \u201cThey want to put you in a box because they know how to sell that box. They don\u2019t know how to sell you.\u201d\n\nHe stopped pacing and turned to face her fully, his expression intense. \u201cI, on the other hand, am a gambler. I didn\u2019t get where I am by only making safe bets. I bet on a group of kids who couldn\u2019t dance and called them One Direction. I bet on a shy, middle-aged woman from a Scottish village. Sometimes, the biggest risks yield the biggest rewards. But I am not a fool. The risk has to be calculated.\u201d He looked down at her guitar case. \u201cYou want to write your own album. You believe you can write hits. Songs that are 100% you, that tell your stories, but that can also connect with millions of people. Is that right?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d she said, her voice a breath of hope. \u201cYes, it is.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlright,\u201d he said, the single word hanging in the air like a gunshot. \u201cProve it.\u201d He walked over to a sleek, minimalist sound system in the corner of the room. \u201cMy team wants to give you a single written by the best in the business. They say it\u2019s a guaranteed hit.\u201d He paused, looking at her, a challenge glinting in his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m going to give you one week. Seven days. You go away, and you write me a single. Your first single. It has to be better than the one they want to give you. It has to be a smash hit, a song that I can hear on the radio a thousand times a day. But it also has to be you. It has to have the same truth as the song you sang in the final. If you can do that, if you can bring me a song that blows me away, I will personally overrule my entire team. We will throw the formula out the window. We will make your album, your way.\u201d\n\nHe let the offer settle, the scale of it, the sheer impossibility of it, sinking into her. One week to write a masterpiece. One week to justify her entire artistic existence. \u201cAnd if I can\u2019t?\u201d she whispered, the question hanging heavy in the silent, white room.\n\nSimon\u2019s face became unreadable, the friendly gambler disappearing, replaced once more by the shrewd, powerful businessman. \u201cIf you can\u2019t,\u201d he said, his voice flat and final, \u201cyou\u2019ll come back into this office next Monday, you\u2019ll thank Richard and Zara for their expert guidance, and you will sing the bloody Swedish power ballad. And you\u2019ll sing it with a smile.\u201d"

The stark white corridor seemed to tilt and sway, and she had to put a hand against the wall to steady herself. She had just walked out of the gravitational field of a star, and her own equilibrium was gone. Liam was waiting by the elevator, his face a mask of anxious anticipation. He took one look at her pale, stunned expression and his shoulders slumped. \u201cBad, then,\u201d he said, his voice flat with disappointment. \u201cHe tore you to shreds.\u201d Kaia shook her head, a slow, disbelieving motion. \u201cNo,\u201d she said, her voice a reedy whisper. \u201cWorse. He gave me a chance.\u201d She explained the ultimatum as the elevator descended in a silent, stomach-lurching drop. The challenge, the sheer, magnificent arrogance of it: *Write me a hit single. In one week. Or become the pop star we tell you to be.* When she finished, Liam didn\u2019t speak. He just stared at the polished steel of the elevator doors, a muscle working in his jaw. The doors opened into the vast, impersonal lobby, and he finally let out a long, slow breath. \u201cThe man\u2019s a monster,\u201d he said, not with anger, but with a kind of grudging awe. \u201cA magnificent, terrifying monster. He\u2019s not just testing your songwriting, Kaia. He\u2019s testing your nerve. He\u2019s pushing all his chips into the middle of the table and daring you to call his bluff.\u201d\n\nThe first two days were a creative wasteland. The beautiful, silent hotel suite became a gilded cage, its panoramic view a mocking reminder of the huge, indifferent world she was supposed to conquer. The silence, which had at first felt like a luxury, became a roaring void. She sat on the ridiculously comfortable sofa, her guitar in her lap, a pristine notepad open on the coffee table beside her. She tried to write. She tried to conjure the magic that had come so easily when she was writing for her Koro, for herself. But Simon\u2019s voice was a constant, critical heckle in her mind. *Is it a hit? Is it a smash? Will it sound good on the radio a thousand times a day?* She attempted to follow the formula, to write something anthemic. She pieced together big, soaring choruses and predictable chord progressions. The results were soulless Frankenstein\u2019s monsters, stitched-together parts of other, better songs. They sounded like advertising jingles for an emotion she didn\u2019t feel. Every time she played one back, she cringed. It was the sound of a fraud. Frustration curdled into a thick, choking panic. She paced the room, a prisoner in a five-star cell, picking at the untouched platters of exquisite food sent up by room service, the taste of ash in her mouth. She was a songwriter who couldn\u2019t write, a winner who was failing her first and most important test. On the evening of the second day, she called home, desperate for an anchor. \u201cEverything\u2019s great, Mum,\u201d she lied, the words feeling like stones in her mouth. \u201cJust busy. Lots of meetings.\u201d She listened to her mum talk about the new rose bushes she\u2019d planted and the latest gossip from the local supermarket, a dispatch from a sane, normal world that felt a million miles away. Hanging up, the sense of isolation was more acute than ever. She was utterly, terrifyingly alone with a blank page and a ticking clock.\n\nOn the morning of day three, she broke. Staring at her own haggard reflection in the mirror, she knew she couldn\u2019t spend another minute in that beautiful, suffocating room. She grabbed her phone and dialled Liam\u2019s number, her fingers clumsy with desperation. \u201cLiam,\u201d she said, her voice cracking. \u201cI can\u2019t do this. I can\u2019t write here. It\u2019s like trying to breathe underwater. I need to get out. I need to be somewhere real.\u201d There was a pause on the other end, and she heard him take a deep breath, the sound of a man making a decision. \u201cOkay,\u201d he said, his voice dropping into a conspiratorial tone. \u201cStay put. Don\u2019t answer the door to anyone. I\u2019ll sort something.\u201d An hour later, he called back. \u201cGo to the service elevator at the end of your hall. Take it down to the loading bay. A laundry van will be there in ten minutes. Get in the back. Don\u2019t ask questions.\u201d It was absurd, something out of a spy movie, but Kaia didn\u2019t hesitate. She grabbed her guitar and her notebook, left the pristine hotel room without a backward glance, and slipped down the service corridor, her heart pounding with the thrill of escape. She found the laundry van, its back doors slightly ajar, and scrambled into the darkness, the smell of industrial-strength detergent and clean linen enveloping her. Ten minutes later, the van rumbled out of the loading bay and into the glorious, chaotic freedom of the city.\n\nLiam drove her to a part of London she\u2019d never seen, a gritty, vibrant network of streets in Camden where the buildings were covered in graffiti and the air hummed with a different kind of energy. He pulled up outside a nondescript brick building, its door plastered with peeling flyers for long-forgotten gigs. \u201cWelcome to The Rat\u2019s Nest,\u201d he said with a wry smile. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit different from your hotel.\u201d He led her down a set of narrow stairs into a basement labyrinth of small, soundproofed rooms. The air was thick with the smell of stale beer, old carpet, and the faint, electric tang of ambition. From behind one door came the thrash of a punk band, from another, the intricate noodling of a jazz guitarist. This was the city\u2019s musical underbelly, the engine room where dreams were forged and broken. Liam unlocked one of the doors, revealing a small, windowless cube containing nothing but a couple of amplifiers, a drum kit, and a microphone stand. It was ugly, it was dingy, and it was the most beautiful thing Kaia had seen all week. \u201cIt\u2019s yours for the next four days,\u201d Liam said. \u201cNo one knows you\u2019re here. No room service, no producers, no Clarissa. Just you.\u201d He placed a bag on the floor containing a thermos of tea, a packet of biscuits, and a couple of sandwiches. \u201cI\u2019ll check in on you. Go on. Write your song.\u201d\n\nIn the glorious, soundproofed anonymity of the rehearsal room, something inside Kaia finally unknotted. The crushing weight of expectation began to lift. In this small, dark box, she wasn\u2019t the BGT winner. She wasn\u2019t a multi-million-pound investment. She was just a girl with a guitar. For the first few hours, she didn\u2019t even try to write. She just played. She let her fingers find their own way, rediscovering the simple joy of making a sound. She played the first song she ever learned, a clumsy three-chord folk tune. She played the waiata her Nan had taught her. She played for the sheer love of it, reconnecting with the part of herself that had been buried under the avalanche of the past week. And then, she started to think. She wasn\u2019t thinking about hits or choruses. She was thinking about the journey. She remembered the feeling of standing at the window of her London flatshare, watching the sky lighten from bruised purple to a soft, smudged grey. She thought of the sky back home in Greymouth, a different grey, a wilder grey, heavy with rain from the Tasman Sea. The idea sparked. *Trading one grey sky for another.* It wasn\u2019t a line about love or heartbreak. It was a line about displacement, about the strange parallel between the home you leave and the new world you enter. A melody began to form around the words, not a soaring, obvious tune, but something more nuanced, more melancholic, tinged with a quiet, persistent hope. The song started to pour out of her, not as a product to be manufactured, but as a story that needed to be told. It was a song about the ache of homesickness, the thrill of the unknown, and the search for a place to belong. It was the story of her life, right now.\n\nFor two days, she lived in that room, fuelled by Liam\u2019s sandwiches and lukewarm tea. The song grew, layer by layer. She found a chorus that felt like a quiet revelation rather than a loud declaration, a melody that lifted and fell like a steady breath. She wrote a bridge that spoke of the fear and the courage it took to leap into the void, to chase a dream across the world. The lyrics were specific and personal \u2013 she wrote about the taste of yesterday\u2019s instant noodles, the draft from a window that never quite closed \u2013 but the feeling was universal. It was a song for anyone who had ever felt small in a big city, for anyone who had ever yearned for the familiar comfort of home while simultaneously running towards a new horizon. Late on the evening of the sixth day, Liam knocked on the door. He found her sitting on the floor, surrounded by crumpled sheets of paper, her eyes shining with exhausted triumph. \u201cI think I\u2019ve got it,\u201d she said, her voice hoarse. She picked up her guitar, took a deep, shaky breath, and played it for him. She sang about the grey skies, the ghost of a southern ocean in a northern city, the hope that you carry inside you like a secret pilot light. When she finished, the final chord hanging in the small, stuffy room, Liam was silent. He wasn't looking at her like an artist liaison; he was just a man, listening, his face etched with a profound, quiet emotion. He cleared his throat. \u201cThat\u2019s it, Kaia,\u201d he said, his voice thick. \u201cThat\u2019s the one.\u201d\n\nThe seventh day dawned. Kaia was bone-tired but filled with a calm, electric certainty. The song was finished. It was hers. It was real. She had walked through the creative fire and emerged with this one, true thing. She showered at a cheap gym Liam had found for her, put on her green shirt armour one last time, and met him at the van. The drive back to the Syco tower felt completely different. The city no longer seemed alien or overwhelming. It was a landscape she had a stake in now, a place where she had fought a battle and won. As the gleaming glass-and-steel building loomed larger, she felt her heart begin to pound, a familiar drumbeat of fear and adrenaline. But this time, it was different. This time, she wasn\u2019t going in empty-handed. She wasn\u2019t a victim waiting for a verdict. She was a songwriter, armed with her song. She looked at her reflection in the window, at the determined set of her jaw. Alright, Simon, she thought, a small, fierce smile playing on her lips. Let\u2019s see you gamble."

This time, Kaia didn't feel like an intruder. She felt like a gladiator walking into the arena, her guitar case her shield and her new song its hidden sword. The familiar knot of fear was in her stomach, but it was a different kind of fear now \u2013 not the panicked dread of a victim, but the sharp, focused adrenaline of a fighter about to step into the ring. Liam stood beside her, a silent, solid presence. He hadn\u2019t said much on the drive over, simply giving her a thermos of hot tea and a single, firm instruction: \u201cDon\u2019t play it for them. Play it for you.\u201d\n\nSimon\u2019s formidable assistant greeted them with the same serene impassivity as before, but this time she didn\u2019t lead Kaia straight to the double doors. Instead, she gestured towards a small, adjacent waiting area, a minimalist space furnished with two low leather sofas and a glass coffee table. Seated on one of the sofas, as if they had been waiting to hold court, were Richard Holloway and Clarissa. The sight of them sent a jolt of ice through Kaia\u2019s veins. It was an ambush. They were here to witness her surrender. Clarissa was examining her perfectly manicured nails, a picture of bored indifference. Richard offered a smile that was all polished teeth. \u201cKaia,\u201d he said, his voice oozing a patronising warmth. \u201cPunctual. An excellent quality in a new artist. I trust you\u2019ve had a productive week and are ready to get started on the real work.\u201d\n\nHe tapped a sleek tablet on the table in front of him. \u201cWe have the demo for you. The track from the Swedish team. It\u2019s called \u2018Unbreakable\u2019. A real monster of a song. We\u2019re very excited about it. We\u2019ve even scheduled the preliminary vocal session for tomorrow morning.\u201d He was speaking as if her failure was a foregone conclusion, as if the past week had been nothing more than a childish indulgence the adults had permitted before getting down to serious business. Clarissa finally looked up, her gaze sweeping over Kaia\u2019s simple clothes with faint, undisguised disdain. \u201cI do hope you\u2019ve come to your senses, Kaia,\u201d she said, her voice dripping with condescension. \u201cIt would be a shame to squander all this momentum on a point of artistic pride. The business isn\u2019t built on pride. It\u2019s built on hits.\u201d\n\nKaia said nothing. She simply met their condescending gazes, her expression calm and unreadable. She thought of Liam\u2019s words: *Don\u2019t play it for them.* She wouldn\u2019t. She wouldn\u2019t even speak to them. Her silence was a wall they couldn\u2019t seem to breach, and it unsettled them. A flicker of irritation crossed Richard\u2019s smooth facade. He had expected a contrite, defeated girl, ready to accept their terms. He was not prepared for this quiet, unnerving composure. Before he could press his advantage, the door to the inner sanctum opened, and the assistant looked directly at Kaia. \u201cHe\u2019s ready for you now.\u201d\n\nIt was the most satisfying moment of Kaia\u2019s life. She gave Richard and Clarissa a small, polite nod, picked up her guitar case, and walked past them towards the double doors. She didn\u2019t look back, but she could feel their shocked, indignant stares burning into her. They had been dismissed from their own power play. She had been summoned past them, and they had been left behind in the waiting room. The power dynamic, for one brief, glorious moment, had been completely inverted.\n\nThe office was exactly as she remembered it: vast, white, and intimidating, with the whole of London sprawling beneath its panoramic window. Simon was not standing this time. He was seated in a low armchair, a cup of coffee in his hand, looking out at the view. He didn\u2019t get up. He simply gestured with his head towards the armchair opposite him. \u201cSit,\u201d he said. The single word was not a request. Kaia sat, placing her guitar case on the floor beside her. She felt like she was at a final exam, facing the one professor whose opinion was the only one that mattered. He took a slow sip of his coffee, his eyes still on the city below. \u201cOne week,\u201d he said, as if continuing a conversation from seven days ago. \u201cIt\u2019s a long time to be alone with your own ambition. It\u2019s a short time to create a masterpiece. Most people, when faced with that kind of pressure, either panic and produce nothing, or they panic and produce a copy of something they think I want to hear. Which one are you?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the one who wrote a song,\u201d Kaia replied, her voice steady. He finally turned his gaze from the window to her, and his eyes were sharp, analytical, devoid of any emotion. \u201cAlright then,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s hear it.\u201d There was no encouragement, no warmth. It was a clinical demand for data. Kaia\u2019s hands were slick with a cold sweat as she unlatched her guitar case. The familiar scent of old wood and metal strings filled the air, a small, earthy comfort in this sterile white space. She pulled the guitar into her lap, its worn, familiar shape a comfort against her body. She didn't look at Simon. She looked past him, out the window at the endless expanse of grey sky. She thought of the dingy rehearsal room, of the kindness in Liam\u2019s eyes, of the triumphant, sooty grin of her Uncle Barry. She took a breath. Then she played.\n\nThe first notes were quiet, intricate, a delicate finger-picked melody that was the polar opposite of a bombastic power ballad intro. It was a question, a searching sound. Then she began to sing, her voice soft but clear, painting the picture. \u201cTrading one grey sky for another\u2026 a ghost of a southern ocean in a northern town\u2026\u201d She sang the truth. She sang about the strange ache of being a stranger, the dizzying thrill of a new beginning, the tiny, specific details of her new life. She didn\u2019t perform it. She just told the story, her voice weaving through the melody, rising and falling with the emotion of the lyric. As she moved into the pre-chorus, she felt the song\u2019s power take hold, a subtle build of tension and hope, a gathering of clouds before a cleansing rain.\n\nAnd then the chorus hit. It wasn\u2019t a shout. It was an exhale. \u201cAnd they call this the big time, a city of gold and stone\u2026 but my heart is a compass, and it\u2019s always pointing home\u2026 Still I\u2019ll keep on walking, under these grey skies, \u2018cause I\u2019m carrying your sunlight in my eyes.\u201d It was a hook, but it was a hook steeped in genuine feeling. It was commercially brilliant and emotionally true, a perfect, paradoxical fusion of what the label wanted and what she needed to say. She poured all the fear, hope, and homesickness of the past few months into her voice, letting it soar for a moment before pulling back for the quiet introspection of the second verse. She felt a shift in the room, the subtle change in atmospheric pressure that occurs when a listener moves from casual hearing to deep, focused attention. He was no longer a judge or a CEO. He was just listening. She closed her eyes for the bridge, the part of the song that was a direct answer to his challenge, a quiet declaration of her own strength. \u201cYou told me to be a star, but you didn\u2019t say how far the fall would be\u2026 but I\u2019m not afraid of falling. I\u2019m afraid of never learning how to fly.\u201d\n\nShe ended the song softly, letting the final chord ring out and fade naturally into the silence of the room, her voice a final, whispered echo of the phrase, \u201cunder these grey skies.\u201d The silence that followed was absolute. It was deeper and more terrifying than the silence after her final performance. This wasn't a stadium of strangers; this was an audience of one, and his verdict was the only thing in the world that mattered. He didn't move. He didn't speak. He just sat there, staring at a point on the far wall, his face completely unreadable. Kaia\u2019s heart hammered against her ribs, a frantic, panicked bird. She had failed. The song was too quiet, too personal, too subtle. He wanted a hit, and she had brought him a poem. The silence stretched for an eternity. Finally, he blinked. He set his coffee cup down on the small table beside him with a soft click. \u201cThe transition from the verse to the pre-chorus,\u201d he said, his voice a clinical, analytical monotone. \u201cThe chord change on the word \u2018ocean\u2019. It\u2019s unexpected. Why?\u201d\n\nThe question was a test, a scalpel slicing into the heart of her creation. She didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cBecause that\u2019s what it feels like,\u201d she said. \u201cBeing homesick. It\u2019s not a constant sadness. It\u2019s a sudden jolt. An unexpected pang. The chord needed to reflect that. It needed to feel like a sudden memory you weren't prepared for.\u201d He nodded slowly, a single, deliberate motion. He looked at her again, and this time, the analytical mask was gone. In its place was something she couldn\u2019t quite name, a look of profound, startling intensity. \u201cRichard and Clarissa think you\u2019re a naive girl who stumbled into a lucky television moment,\u201d he said, his voice quiet. \u201cThey are fools.\u201d He stood up and walked over to his desk, picking up his phone. Kaia watched, her breath held tight in her chest. He dialled a number, putting the call on speakerphone. It rang once before Richard Holloway\u2019s brisk voice answered. \u201cRichard.\u201d\n\n\u201cSimon,\u201d Richard replied, a hint of confusion in his tone. \u201cIs the meeting over?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is,\u201d Simon said calmly. \u201cCancel the session with the Swedish writers. Cancel all of them. The girl is writing her own album.\u201d There was a stunned silence from the speaker. Richard finally found his voice. \u201cSimon, with respect, is that wise? We haven\u2019t even heard\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard all I need to,\u201d Simon cut him off, his voice hardening, leaving no room for argument. \u201cHer first single is called \u2018Grey Skies\u2019. I want it recorded, mastered, and delivered to every major radio station in this country by the end of the month. Am I clear?\u201d\n\n\u201cBut\u2026 the marketing plan, the strategy\u2026\u201d Richard stammered, his authority completely stripped away.\n\n\u201cThe strategy,\u201d Simon said, his voice dropping to a low, lethal calm, \u201cis that you are going to do exactly what I tell you to do.\u201d He hung up the phone without waiting for a reply, the sudden silence deafening. He turned to look at Kaia, who was sitting on the sofa, completely poleaxed, her mind struggling to catch up with the reality of what had just happened. For the first time, a genuine, unrestrained smile broke across Simon Cowell\u2019s face. It transformed him. \u201cCongratulations, songwriter,\u201d he said. \u201cYou won the bet. Now the real work begins.\u201d"

                                        "text": "The heavy door clicked shut behind her, the sound sealing Simon Cowell\u2019s verdict into reality. For a moment, Kaia just stood there in the silent, art-filled corridor, her mind a roaring vacuum. She had won. She had walked into the lion\u2019s den with a single, fragile song and walked out with the entire kingdom. Her legs felt unsteady, as if the floor itself was no longer a reliable surface. When she reached the waiting area, Richard Holloway and Clarissa were on their feet, their expressions a fascinating tableau of suppressed shock. Richard\u2019s face was a carefully blank mask of corporate professionalism, but a muscle twitching high on his cheek betrayed his fury. Clarissa, ever the strategist, had already recalibrated. Her face was arranged into a brilliant, predatory smile.\n\n\u201cKaia, darling!\u201d Clarissa purred, gliding towards her as if they were the oldest and dearest of friends. \u201cAn absolute masterstroke! I have to say, I had my doubts about your strategy, but that\u2019s why I love working with true artists. You have to trust the vision. I told Richard, I said, \u2018She has a fire in her. We have to let her run.\u2019 We are going to make history together!\u201d The cynical transparency of the lie was breathtaking. She was attempting to rewrite the history of the past hour, to reposition herself from antagonist to chief champion. Richard, meanwhile, simply adjusted his silk tie, his eyes cold. \u201cSimon has informed us of the new direction,\u201d he said, his voice clipped and devoid of any emotion. \u201cMy team will be in touch to coordinate the new recording schedule. Congratulations on your\u2026 successful pitch.\u201d The way he said the word \u2018pitch\u2019 made it sound like an insult, a lucky trick she had pulled off. Kaia looked from his barely-concealed resentment to Clarissa\u2019s false, glittering smile. A week ago, their condescension would have crushed her. Now, it was just noise. She felt a strange, liberating sense of pity for them. They were cogs in a machine she had just managed to reroute. She gave them a small, polite nod, the same one she had given them on the way in. \u201cThank you,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cI look forward to it.\u201d Then she turned her back on them and walked towards the elevator, where Liam was waiting, his face a giant, unasked question. The doors slid shut, sealing them off from the Syco executives, and as the car began its silent descent, the tension in Kaia\u2019s body finally snapped. A wild, giddy laugh escaped her lips, a sound of pure, incredulous joy. Liam stared at her for a second, then his own face broke into a huge, beaming grin. \u201cYou did it,\u201d he said, his voice full of wonder. \u201cYou absolute lunatic, you actually did it.\u201d\n\nThe real work began the very next morning. There was no gentle easing into the process. The deadline Simon had set\u2014a finished master for radio by the end of the month\u2014was hanging over them like a guillotine. Liam picked her up from the hotel, but they didn\u2019t go to the gleaming Syco tower. Instead, he drove her to a quiet, leafy street in St John\u2019s Wood, pulling up outside a famous, unassuming white building. Orion Studios. Its walls were steeped in musical history; legendary albums had been born in the rooms beyond its modest facade. This was not a corporate hit factory. This was hallowed ground. Kaia felt a fresh wave of imposter syndrome as she walked through the doors, her guitar case clutched in her hand. The place had a smell\u2014a mix of old wood, warm vacuum tubes, and decades of creative energy. The receptionist, a woman with kind eyes and purple hair, simply smiled. \u201cStudio Two. Finn\u2019s waiting for you.\u201d\n\nFinn was not what she expected. She had pictured another suit, another version of Richard Holloway. The man standing in the centre of the magnificent control room of Studio Two was in his late fifties, with a wild mane of grey hair, a faded Ramones t-shirt, and kind, bloodshot eyes that looked like they had witnessed a thousand late-night recording sessions. He was leaning over a vast mixing console that glittered with a galaxy of knobs and faders. He didn\u2019t stand up when she came in, just glanced over his shoulder. \u201cKaia,\u201d he said, his voice a low, gravelly rumble. \u201cYou\u2019re the Kiwi. Heard the song. It\u2019s not bad.\u201d For a legendary producer who had worked with some of the biggest names in music, \u201cnot bad\u201d was the highest form of praise. He gestured with his thumb towards the large live room, visible through a wall of thick glass. \u201cGo on then. Set up. Let\u2019s see what we\u2019re working with.\u201d There was no flattery, no mention of the show, no talk of branding or narrative. It was all about the music. For the first time, Kaia felt she could truly breathe. This was her language. This was her world.\n\nShe spent the first hour alone in the live room, a beautiful, wood-panelled space with a soaring ceiling. She was surrounded by a collection of vintage microphones that looked like museum pieces. The pressure was immense, but it was a different kind. It was the pressure to do justice to the song, to the opportunity, to the faith Simon and Liam had placed in her. When Finn\u2019s voice finally crackled through her headphones, it was calm and direct. \u201cAlright, Kaia. Let\u2019s just do one from top to bottom. Just you and the guitar. Don\u2019t try to perform. Just play it like you did in my office.\u201d She flinched. *My office?* Finn chuckled, a dry, rasping sound. \u201cSimon\u2019s. He sent me the recording from his phone yesterday. Now, stop thinking. Play.\u201d She took a breath, closed her eyes, and let the song unspool. The acoustics in the room were perfect; her guitar and her voice sounded warmer, richer, and more intimate than they ever had before. She sang it straight through, losing herself in the melody and the story. When she finished, a profound silence filled her headphones. She waited, her heart thumping. \u201cRight,\u201d Finn\u2019s voice crackled again. \u201cThat\u2019s the soul of it. My job is to build a body around that soul without crushing it. Guitar and vocal are good. That\u2019s our foundation.\u201d\n\nJust as they were about to start discussing the arrangement, the door to the control room opened and Clarissa swept in, bringing a blast of expensive perfume and corporate chill into the creative sanctuary. She was dressed in a sharp, cream-coloured pantsuit, holding a tablet. \u201cFinn, darling,\u201d she said, her voice bright and brittle. \u201cJust wanted to touch base on the visual strategy. I\u2019ve had a concept for the music video sent over. Very clean, very high-fashion. We\u2019re thinking a stark, white studio, Kaia in a beautiful designer gown, maybe some wind machines for the chorus\u2026\u201d Finn didn\u2019t even look at her. He pressed a button on the console. \u201cKaia,\u201d he said into the microphone, his voice calm. \u201cWe\u2019re going to try putting down a bass line. I\u2019m thinking something simple, melodic. Something that walks with the vocal, not under it.\u201d He was completely ignoring Clarissa, treating her as if she were a ghost. Clarissa\u2019s smile tightened. \u201cFinn, the single\u2019s success is dependent on a cohesive marketing campaign. The video is a crucial component.\u201d\n\nFinn finally swivelled his chair around to face her, his expression one of immense, weary patience. \u201cClarissa,\u201d he said, his voice dangerously soft. \u201cYour job is to sell the record. My job is to make a record that\u2019s worth selling. Right now, we are making the record. That means this room,\u201d he gestured around the studio, \u201cis my church. And in my church, we don't talk about marketing strategies or wind machines.\u201d He swivelled back to the console. \u201cAnd we don\u2019t wear cream pantsuits.\u201d The dismissal was so absolute, so devastatingly calm, that for a moment Clarissa was rendered speechless. A flush of angry red crept up her neck. Without another word, she turned on her heel and strode out of the control room, the door swinging shut behind her with a sharp hiss. A slow grin spread across Finn\u2019s face. He leaned into the microphone. \u201cRight, Kaia. Where were we?\u201d Kaia, watching the entire exchange from behind the glass, let out a shaky laugh. She had found a new ally, a grizzled, formidable guardian at the gate of her music. The real work had begun, and for the first time, she felt she was not alone in the fight."

He never told her what to do; instead, he would lean back in his chair, his eyes closed, and ask questions that forced her to dig deeper into her own vision. \"The bass,\" he\u2019d rumble after a take. \"Does it feel like it's walking with you, or is it dragging behind?\" or \"That harmony. Is it a friend singing with you, or is it a ghost?\"\n\nHe brought in a rhythm section, two session musicians who were legends in their own right. The bassist, Bill, was a man in his sixties with a face like a weathered roadmap and hands that looked like they could wrestle a crocodile, but he played with a melodic grace that was breathtakingly gentle. The drummer, Marcus, was a young, sharp-witted guy with an infectious energy, but when he sat behind his kit, his entire being became focused on serving the song, his ear attuned to the most subtle nuances of Kaia\u2019s vocal. At first, she was intimidated, terrified of telling these masters of their craft what to play. But Finn created a space where she was the undisputed leader. \"It's your song, Kaia. Your story,\" he said simply, when he saw her hesitate. \"They're here to help you tell it. So, tell them.\" And so she did. She spoke not in musical terms, but in feelings. For the drumbeat, she described the steady, rhythmic pace of walking home from the tube station at night, tired but determined. Marcus listened, nodded, and simplified his beat into something that felt exactly like a steady, hopeful heartbeat. For the bass, she talked about a quiet, constant presence, a friend walking beside you in silence. Bill didn\u2019t say a word, just played a line that moved and breathed with her vocal melody, a perfect, understated counterpoint.\n\nEach day, the song grew, layer by layer, but it never lost its core of intimacy. They added a Wurlitzer electric piano, its sound warm and slightly melancholic, like rain on a windowpane. They experimented with backing vocals, with Kaia layering her own voice into soft, ethereal harmonies that sounded like distant echoes of her own thoughts. The biggest debate was over strings. Kaia was instantly wary, the word conjuring BGT-style schmaltz and the overblown arrangements the label had tried to force on her. \"I don't want it to sound\u2026 cheesy,\" she said, the word feeling inadequate. Finn nodded in understanding. \"There are two ways to use strings,\" he explained. \"You can slather them on like ketchup to hide the taste of a bad burger, or you can use them like a pinch of salt to bring out the flavor that\u2019s already there. We\u2019re going to use salt.\" He brought in a string quartet, four young, serious musicians, and had them play long, sustained, shifting chords that hung in the air behind the chorus, a sound that was less an orchestra and more the vast, open grey sky the song was named for. It didn't overwhelm the song; it gave it atmosphere, a sense of space and longing that elevated it to another plane.\n\nThe final piece of the puzzle was her own lead vocal. She had sung it dozens of times, but now she had to sing it over the rich, fully-realised world they had built. She stood in the centre of the large, dimly lit live room, her headphones on, a vintage Neumann microphone in front of her. Through the glass, she could see Finn and Liam, who had quietly slipped in, watching from the control room. Finn\u2019s voice came through her headphones, calm and low. \"You\u2019re not in a studio, Kaia. You\u2019re back in your flat. It\u2019s pre-dawn. You\u2019re looking out the window. Just tell us what you see.\" She closed her eyes. She wasn\u2019t performing for a record. She wasn\u2019t trying to impress Simon Cowell. She was back in that moment of profound loneliness and defiant hope. She sang the song from top to bottom in a single, unbroken take. Her voice was no longer just the sound of a girl with a guitar; it was the sound of an artist, infused with all the strength, fear, and resilience of her journey. It was a cry from the heart, captured in perfect, high-fidelity sound. When the final note faded, the silence in her headphones was absolute. She opened her eyes. In the control room, Finn didn't cheer or applaud. He simply looked at her, held her gaze for a long moment, and gave a single, slow, deliberate nod. It was the most profound praise she had ever received.\n\nLater that evening, the four of them\u2014Kaia, Finn, Liam, and Bill the bassist, who had stayed late out of sheer curiosity\u2014gathered in the control room for the first playback of the rough mix. The atmosphere was thick with a nervous, sacred excitement. Finn dimmed the lights until the only glow came from the hundreds of tiny lights on the mixing console. \"Right,\" he rumbled. \"Let's see what we've made.\" He pushed a single, large fader up, and the room was filled with sound. It began with the quiet intimacy of her acoustic guitar, just as she had written it. But then the heartbeat of the drums entered, followed by the soulful, walking bass line. The warm chords of the Wurlitzer bloomed, and then her voice, clear and present and heartbreakingly real. When the chorus arrived, the strings swelled subtly beneath it, not to add drama, but to add a vast, aching sense of space. It was her song, but it was bigger, deeper, and more powerful than she had ever imagined it could be. It was the sound of her own lonely heart, amplified into an anthem that could fill stadiums. Tears welled in Kaia's eyes, blurring the glittering lights of the console into a constellation. This was it. This was the sound she had been chasing. This was the truth. Liam sat motionless, his eyes closed, completely lost in the music. Beside him, Bill, the stoic, veteran musician, was nodding his head slowly, a rare, small smile playing on his lips.\n\nThe song faded out, leaving a ringing, emotional silence in its wake. No one spoke for a long time. Finn finally leaned back in his chair, the leather creaking in the quiet room. \"Well,\" he said, his voice gruff, but with an unmistakable undercurrent of pride. \"It doesn't suck.\" Coming from him, it was like a standing ovation. Kaia let out a shaky laugh, wiping the tears from her cheeks with the back of her hand. She felt hollowed out and completely full at the same time, an exhaustion so profound it felt like peace. They had done it. They had taken her small, fragile idea and built it into something strong and beautiful.\n\nOn the car ride back to the hotel, Liam was uncharacteristically quiet, still processing what he had heard. He finally turned to her, the city lights reflecting in his eyes. \"You know, all those years in this business,\" he said, his voice full of a quiet awe, \"I've seen them manufacture hundreds of hits. I've never actually seen anyone make a classic before. Not from the ground up.\" He shook his head in wonder. \"What you did this week, Kaia\u2026 it's the reason people like me get into this business in the first place.\" Kaia leaned her head against the cool glass of the window, a rough mix of \"Grey Skies\" playing softly from her phone. She looked out at the endless stream of headlights, at the anonymous faces in the crowds on the pavement, at the sprawling, glittering expanse of the city she was starting to understand. She was tired, she was homesick, and she was happier than she had ever been in her life. The song wasn\u2019t just a career move anymore. It was proof. Proof that she was right to fight, right to trust her own voice. And as her melody filled the quiet car, she knew, with a bone-deep certainty, that her story was only just beginning."

                                        "text": "The day of the playback was a strange, formal affair. Finn, Liam, and Kaia\u2014the creative trinity\u2014returned to the Syco tower, not as supplicants, but as artisans delivering a finished commission. They were ushered into a smaller, more intimate listening room, a space designed with perfect acoustics and furnished with a single, deep leather sofa. It felt less like a boardroom and more like a high-tech confessional. Richard Holloway and Clarissa were already there, their faces carefully neutral. The atmosphere was thick with a tense, professional politeness that felt far more hostile than open anger. There were no greetings, just a curt nod from Richard towards Finn. \"Let's hear it,\" he said.\n\nFinn, in his element, walked to the sleek control panel built into the wall. He didn't say a word. He didn't offer a preamble or manage their expectations. He simply pressed play. The opening notes of \"Grey Skies,\" the delicate, questioning acoustic guitar, filled the acoustically perfect room. The sound was so clean, so present, it felt like Kaia was sitting right there, playing it live. Richard sat perfectly still, his eyes closed, his expression unreadable as he listened with the intense focus of a man counting money. Clarissa, on the other hand, couldn\u2019t hide her reaction. As the song built, as the layers of bass, drums, and keys swelled into the first chorus, a flicker of genuine shock, quickly suppressed, crossed her face. This was not the simple, folky demo she had expected. This was a fully-formed, emotionally resonant, and undeniably commercial record. Her carefully constructed narrative\u2014that Kaia was a naive artist who needed professional guidance\u2014was being dismantled note by note.\n\nWhen the song faded out on its final, lingering chord, the silence it left behind was profound. It was Richard who broke it, his voice a dry, clinical assessment. \u201cThe mix is clean. The vocal performance is exceptional. The hook is subtle but effective.\u201d He opened his eyes and looked at Kaia, his gaze cool and appraising. \u201cIt exceeds commercial potential. Congratulations.\u201d It was a verdict, not a compliment, delivered with the emotional warmth of a financial report. Clarissa, however, had already pivoted. She clapped her hands together, a sharp, brittle sound in the quiet room, her face now radiating a brilliant, proprietary enthusiasm. \u201cSublime! Absolutely sublime,\u201d she gushed. \u201cIt\u2019s heartbreaking, it\u2019s hopeful, it\u2019s everything we wanted. The authenticity is just pouring out of it. Which brings us, of course, to the video.\u201d She had seamlessly co-opted their victory and was already steering the conversation back onto her own territory.\n\nShe tapped her tablet, and the large screen on the wall flickered to life, displaying a series of glossy images. A mood board. It showed models with windswept hair on stark, white sets; close-ups of expensive, flowing fabrics; artfully blurred city lights. It was the exact concept she had pitched in the studio. \u201cWe need to match the song\u2019s emotional weight with a powerful visual statement,\u201d she announced, her voice filled with a renewed sense of authority. \u201cWe need to present Kaia not just as a singer, but as an icon. Aspirational. Chic. We need to elevate her image. I\u2019m thinking a top-tier fashion director, someone like Emil Larsen. His work is all about that clean, high-end aesthetic. It will position the brand perfectly.\u201d\n\nKaia felt a familiar cold dread begin to creep back in. They were doing it again, trying to wrap her truth in a glossy, artificial package. The images on the screen had nothing to do with her song. They were generic signifiers of luxury, interchangeable and empty. She looked to Finn, but he remained silent, watching her, his expression neutral. This was her battle to fight. Liam, sensing her distress, subtly cleared his throat, a small signal of support. \u201cI\u2019m glad you think the song is authentic, Clarissa,\u201d Kaia began, her voice quiet but firm, refusing to be intimidated. \u201cBecause the video needs to be just as authentic. The song isn\u2019t about designer gowns or wind machines. It\u2019s about feeling small and lost in a big city. It\u2019s about the quiet moments. The tube ride home late at night, the condensation on a windowpane, seeing your own reflection in a puddle on the pavement.\u201d\n\nShe leaned forward, her passion for the song overriding her fear of the executives. \u201cThe video should be the song. It should be me, in a normal coat, with my guitar, walking through the real London. Not the London of postcards, but the London of rainy streets, of anonymous crowds, of little cafes. It should feel real because the song is real. It should feel like a page from a diary, not a page from a fashion magazine.\u201d Clarissa\u2019s smile was fixed, but her eyes had gone cold again. \u201cKaia, darling, that\u2019s a lovely, rustic sentiment, but it\u2019s not a marketing strategy. We\u2019re not selling a diary. We\u2019re selling a star. The public wants glamour, they want escapism. They don\u2019t want to see their own dreary commute reflected back at them in a music video.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think they want to see something they can connect to,\u201d Kaia countered, her voice gaining strength. \u201cThey connected with the song because it was honest. The video needs to have that same honesty.\u201d \u201cHonesty doesn\u2019t shift units, Kaia,\u201d Richard interjected, his patience clearly wearing thin. \u201cA strong, aspirational brand image does. Emil Larsen\u2019s involvement alone would generate significant press. A video of you wandering around in the rain, frankly, would not. From a return-on-investment perspective, Clarissa\u2019s approach is the only viable option.\u201d The room was divided. It was two against two. Art against commerce. Authenticity against image. The standoff was a perfect, tense miniature of her entire industry struggle.\n\nFinn finally spoke, his deep voice cutting through the tension. He wasn't looking at Richard or Clarissa. He was looking at Kaia. \u201cWhat do you want, Kaia?\u201d he asked simply. It was the same question she had been asked countless times, but coming from him, it felt different. It wasn\u2019t a challenge or a threat. It was a genuine inquiry. \u201cI want people to feel the song when they watch the video,\u201d she said, her gaze steady. \u201cI want it to be a companion piece, not an advertisement for a lifestyle I don\u2019t live.\u201d Finn nodded slowly. He turned his gaze to Richard. \u201cThere you have it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe artist has a vision. My job is to help her realize it. Not to help you sell handbags.\u201d Richard\u2019s jaw tightened. He was being outmaneuvered again, and this time by one of his own veteran producers.\n\nClarissa, seeing she was losing control, played her trump card. \u201cThis is not a creative debate, it\u2019s a logistical one,\u201d she said sharply. \u201cEmil Larsen is available to shoot next week. He has a crew, a concept, and a guaranteed delivery date that aligns with the single\u2019s release schedule. To start from scratch with Kaia\u2019s\u2026 idea\u2026 would mean finding a new director, developing a new concept, location scouting\u2026 it would push the release back by weeks. We would lose all the momentum Simon was so concerned about.\u201d It was a shrewd, practical argument, a weapon of deadlines and budgets designed to make Kaia\u2019s artistic vision seem like an irresponsible indulgence. Richard nodded in agreement. \u201cShe\u2019s right. We can\u2019t afford a delay. The schedule is the schedule. We\u2019ll move forward with Clarissa\u2019s plan.\u201d The verdict had been delivered. Kaia\u2019s heart sank. She had won the battle for the song\u2019s soul, but it seemed she was about to lose the battle for its face. She felt a surge of helpless anger. She had poured her heart into that record, only to have it dressed up in someone else\u2019s empty, fashionable clothes. She had come so far, only to be stopped by a production schedule. The fight, she realised with a sickening lurch, was not over. It was simply shifting to a new, more treacherous battleground."

Kaia\u2019s earlier sense of triumph had evaporated, replaced by the bitter, metallic taste of compromise. She had poured every ounce of her soul into the recording, only to have its visual representation decided by a mood board of generic luxury. She felt a burning, impotent rage. They hadn't just disagreed with her idea; they had dismissed it as a quaint, unprofessional fantasy, swatting it away with the blunt instruments of budgets and schedules. It was a perfectly designed system, she realised. It wasn\u2019t designed to crush you with a single, brutal \u2018no\u2019. It was designed to slowly, methodically exhaust you with a thousand reasonable, practical, soul-destroying \u2018yes, but\u2019s, until you were too tired to fight anymore.\n\nIn the car, the silence was heavy and brittle. Liam drove, his hands tight on the steering wheel, his gaze fixed on the road ahead. He didn't offer any easy platitudes. He knew her well enough by now to understand that cheerful optimism would feel like an insult. Kaia stared out at the passing architecture, at the people moving along the pavements, living their real, un-storyboarded lives. That was the world her song belonged to, and it was a world her music video would now be forbidden from entering. The injustice of it was a physical ache in her chest. \u201cThey don\u2019t get it,\u201d she said finally, her voice low and tight. \u201cThey heard the song, but they didn\u2019t listen. They think it\u2019s about being sad in a pretty dress. They think authenticity is just a filter you can apply in post-production.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey get it, Kaia,\u201d Liam said grimly, his eyes meeting hers in the rear-view mirror for a brief, stark moment. \u201cThey just don't care. To them, your song isn't a story; it's an asset. And assets need to be packaged for maximum appeal. They\u2019re not building a video for your song; they\u2019re building a commercial for your brand. Clarissa\u2019s brand. And now, you\u2019re trapped. You fight, you\u2019re \u2018difficult\u2019 and you cause a delay that costs the label money, which is the one unforgivable sin. You don\u2019t fight, and you spend the rest of your career promoting a video that feels like a lie. It\u2019s a perfect trap.\u201d He was right. It was a perfect trap. And as they pulled up outside her grand, anonymous hotel, she felt its walls closing in.\n\nBack in the gilded cage of her suite, the panoramic view of the city felt like a mockery of her confinement. A courier had been. A sleek, black Syco-branded portfolio lay on the coffee table. She opened it. Inside was a CD labelled \u2018UNBREAKABLE \u2013 Reference Demo\u2019 and a thick document outlining the marketing and promotional schedule for the single. It was a blueprint for a future she no longer wanted, a life that was being expertly constructed for her by people who didn't know her at all. She let the portfolio slide from her fingers onto the plush carpet. She didn\u2019t want to hear \u2018Unbreakable\u2019. She could already imagine it: the bombastic production, the soaring but empty vocals, the lyrical platitudes about strength and resilience. It was the song of the person they wanted her to be, not the person she was. Exhaustion, heavier and more profound than any she had felt before, washed over her. She lay down on the huge, perfectly made bed and stared at the ceiling, feeling the fight drain out of her. Maybe this was just how it was. Maybe she had won her one great victory, and this was the price.\n\nAn hour later, a sharp, insistent knock on the door startled her from her stupor. She ignored it, assuming it was room service. But the knock came again, louder this time. Not the polite rap of hotel staff, but something more urgent. With a weary sigh, she dragged herself to the door and peered through the peephole. Her heart jumped. It wasn\u2019t Liam. It was Finn. He was standing in the corridor, his wild grey hair looking even more out of place against the hushed, beige luxury of the hotel. He looked impatient, like a caged animal. She quickly unlatched the door. \u201cWhat happened to \u2018my church\u2019?\u201d she asked, a weak attempt at a joke. \u201cThought you didn\u2019t leave the studio.\u201d\n\nFinn strode past her into the room without an invitation, his presence instantly disrupting its sterile perfection. He glanced at the portfolio on the floor and nudged it with the toe of his worn leather boot. \u201cThey send you the poison pill, then?\u201d he rumbled. \u201cThe \u2018guaranteed hit\u2019 to remind you what a professional sounds like.\u201d He turned to face her, his bloodshot eyes surprisingly sharp and clear. \u201cSo that\u2019s it? You made the best record you could, and now you\u2019re going to let a glorified perfume-ad director turn it into a commercial for sparkly water?\u201d\n\nHis bluntness was a splash of cold water. \u201cWhat am I supposed to do, Finn?\u201d she shot back, a spark of her old fire returning. \u201cThey have the director, the schedule, the budget. Clarissa said it herself, it would take weeks to set up anything else. I\u2019m trapped.\u201d Finn let out a short, humourless laugh. \u201cTrapped? That\u2019s what they want you to think. They build a box of logistics and deadlines around you so you won\u2019t even try to punch your way out.\u201d He took a step closer, his voice dropping, becoming conspiratorial. \u201cThe meeting ended at five. It\u2019s now seven. Clarissa\u2019s pet director, Larsen, is in Milan until Sunday night. He\u2019s scheduled for a full day of prep on Monday, with the shoot on Tuesday. That\u2019s their schedule. Their box.\u201d\n\nHe paused, letting the information sink in. \u201cThat gives us the entire weekend. It gives us about sixty hours. To do it ourselves.\u201d Kaia stared at him, her mind struggling to process the sheer audacity of what he was proposing. \u201cDo it ourselves? Make a whole music video? In a weekend? That\u2019s\u2026 that\u2019s insane.\u201d \u201cInsanity is the only rational response to a world that\u2019s gone mad,\u201d Finn said, a glint of anarchic glee in his eyes. \u201cThey want to fight you with schedules and budgets? Fine. We\u2019ll fight them with speed and truth. We won\u2019t ask for their permission because we know they\u2019ll say no. We\u2019ll just do it. We\u2019ll shoot your video, your way. And on Monday morning, when Clarissa is prepping her wind machines, we\u2019ll send a finished video to Simon Cowell. We don\u2019t give them an idea to reject. We give them a reality to deal with.\u201d\n\nIt was the most reckless, brilliant, and terrifying idea she had ever heard. It was a guerrilla war against her own record label. \u201cBut we don\u2019t have a crew,\u201d she stammered. \u201cA director, a camera\u2026\u201d Finn was already pulling out his phone. He scrolled through his contacts, a list that was a veritable who\u2019s who of the music industry, and stopped on a name. \u201cThere\u2019s a kid,\u201d he said, dialling the number. \u201cLeo. He was an intern at Orion a few years back. Film school genius. He\u2019s got more talent in his little finger than Emil Larsen has in his entire overpaid body. He hates the corporate video world. Thinks it\u2019s poison. He\u2019s been shooting tiny, brilliant videos for unsigned bands for no money, just for the love of it.\u201d He put the phone to his ear. \u201cHe\u2019ll be perfect.\u201d\n\nThe phone was answered on the second ring. \u201cLeo, it\u2019s Finn. Stop whatever you\u2019re doing. I\u2019m sending you a track. Listen to it. Then get your arse over to the Kestrel pub in Camden. You\u2019ve got an hour\u2026 Yeah, it\u2019s a job\u2026 No, the budget\u2019s terrible\u2026 Because it\u2019s the best song you\u2019re going to hear all year, that\u2019s why.\u201d He hung up, a slow grin spreading across his face. He then dialled Liam. \u201cLiam. Change of plan. Scrap whatever you\u2019re doing tonight. Get your logistical arse to The Kestrel in one hour. We\u2019re staging a coup.\u201d He looked at Kaia, his eyes blazing with a wild, creative fire. \u201cWell? Are you going to lie here and listen to their demo, or are you coming to start a revolution?\u201d\n\nAn hour later, the four of them were crammed into a worn, wooden booth in the back corner of a noisy, crowded pub. Liam, his face a mixture of terror and exhilaration, was already sketching out a potential shooting schedule on a stack of napkins. Across from him sat Leo, the director. He was younger than Kaia had expected, maybe twenty-two, with intense, dark eyes, a shock of untameable black hair, and an expression of burning artistic sincerity. He had a small, battered camera bag slung over his shoulder that looked like it had been through a war. \u201cThe song\u2026\u201d Leo said, his voice quiet but vibrating with passion as he looked at Kaia. \u201cIt\u2019s incredible. It\u2019s so honest. I saw it all when I was listening. The rain on the bus window. The blur of the streetlights. The feeling of being invisible in a crowd of millions. We have to capture that. No tricks, no slow-motion, no fake glamour. Just truth.\u201d\n\nHe was speaking her language. He understood. The plan they hatched over the next hour was a masterpiece of organised chaos. Leo had a small, trusted crew\u2014a camera operator and a sound tech\u2014who would work for beer and a credit on a project this good. Liam, using his intimate knowledge of the record label\u2019s labyrinthine bureaucracy, figured out how to requisition a small amount of cash from a miscellaneous marketing budget, enough to cover gear rental and transport. He would also be their lookout, their man on the inside, running interference if Clarissa\u2019s team started asking questions before Monday. Their studio would be the city of London itself. They would shoot guerrilla-style, moving fast, using natural light and the city\u2019s own raw energy. The shoot would start at dawn the next day.\n\nKaia looked at the faces around the small, sticky pub table: Liam, the loyal soldier, nervously double-checking his figures; Finn, the grizzled general, watching over them with a look of fierce pride; and Leo, the young, passionate warrior, his eyes shining as he storyboarded shots on the back of a beer mat. They were a tiny, rebel alliance against a vast, powerful empire. It was a crazy, impossible gamble, destined to fail in a hundred different ways. But as she looked at her small, determined team, a wave of fierce, defiant joy washed over her. She wasn't a victim. She wasn't a product. She was a fighter. She had won the battle for her song's soul; now, under the cover of a London weekend, they were going to stage a heist to steal back its face."

                                        "text": "The revolution began at four o\u2019clock in the morning. The air was cold and damp, tasting of wet pavement and the faint, metallic tang of the sleeping city. There was no fleet of production trailers, no bustling army of crew members, no catering tent with steaming urns of coffee. There was just a single, slightly battered white van parked on a deserted side street near Waterloo Bridge, its interior cluttered with camera cases and coiled cables. Leo, the director, was a blur of nervous energy, checking light meters against the pre-dawn gloom, his dark eyes alive with a kind of manic creative glee. His entire crew consisted of two people: a stoic, bearded cameraman named Sal, who looked like he could film comfortably in a war zone, and a young sound tech named Rina, who was meticulously taping a tiny microphone inside the collar of Kaia\u2019s coat.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re stealing the light, that\u2019s all we\u2019re doing,\u201d Leo whispered to Kaia, his breath misting in the cold air. \u201cThe sun\u2019s coming up for us. The city is our set. Don\u2019t think about the camera. Don\u2019t think about anything. Just be here. Look at your new home. What does it feel like?\u201d He didn\u2019t wait for an answer. He gave a nod to Sal, and the shoot began. They walked out onto the bridge as the sky began its slow, painful transition from inky black to a bruised, luminous grey. The city was a silhouette, its landmarks just dark shapes against the lightening sky. A few lone cars hissed across the wet asphalt. Leo didn't direct her; he simply followed, with Sal\u2019s camera seemingly attached to his hip. He filmed her leaning against the cold stone of the parapet, her guitar case on the ground beside her, her gaze lost in the vast panorama. He captured the shiver that ran through her, a mixture of cold and awe. He filmed her hands clutching a paper cup of tea Liam had provided, the steam rising like a fragile prayer. There was no artifice, no wind machine. There was just a girl, a city, and the quiet, aching space between them. It was the opening verse of her song, brought to life.\n\nFrom there, they plunged into the city\u2019s circulatory system: the Underground. Descending the escalator at Waterloo station during the first wave of the morning rush was like diving into a fast-moving river. The noise, the sheer density of people, was overwhelming. Leo thrived on it. \u201cDon\u2019t look away!\u201d he yelled over the din. \u201cLook at them! Find a face!\u201d Sal, a master of his craft, moved like a ghost through the crowd, his camera steady as a rock. He captured Kaia\u2019s face, a small, still point in the swirling chaos, her expression a mixture of fascination and profound alienation. He filmed the reflections of passing trains in her eyes, the blur of advertisements, the anonymous procession of faces, each one carrying their own story, their own private universe. At one point, a transport police officer eyed their professional-looking camera with suspicion, his hand moving towards his radio. Liam, ever the logistical wizard, materialized at his side instantly, asking for directions to a fictitious address with such a flurry of polite, detailed confusion that the officer was completely distracted, giving Sal and Leo just enough time to hustle Kaia onto a train, the doors hissing shut behind them. It was a close call, and the jolt of adrenaline made the entire enterprise feel thrillingly, dangerously real.\n\nThe rain began in the early afternoon, a soft London drizzle that quickly thickened into a determined downpour. While a normal film crew would have scrambled for cover, Leo looked up at the grey, weeping sky and grinned. \u201cPerfect,\u201d he declared. They were in a quiet residential street in Angel, the terraced houses gleaming, the pavements turning to black mirrors. \u201cNo umbrella,\u201d Leo instructed. \u201cJust walk.\u201d Kaia did as he said, pulling the collar of her coat up, her guitar case bumping against her leg. The rain plastered her hair to her face and seeped into the shoulders of her coat, but she didn\u2019t care. She felt completely alive. Sal filmed her from across the street, capturing her small figure moving through the vast, grey emptiness. He shot her reflection in a shop window, a ghostly image superimposed over a display of second-hand books. He filmed a close-up of her face, tilted up to the sky, raindrops clinging to her eyelashes, a look of melancholic acceptance on her face. It was the visual embodiment of her chorus: a quiet resilience in the face of a persistent, overwhelming grey.\n\nThey spent the rest of the weekend in a frantic, joyous race against the clock. They shot in a small, steamy caf\u00e9 filled with the smell of fried bacon and strong tea, with Leo filming through the condensation-streaked window, blurring the line between viewer and subject. They filmed on the top deck of a night bus as it wound its way through the glittering, rain-slicked streets of the West End, capturing the lonely beauty of the city after midnight, the neon lights painting fleeting colours on Kaia\u2019s thoughtful face. Each location, each shot, was a line from her song. It wasn't a performance; it was a documentary of a feeling. Throughout it all, the tiny crew worked with a seamless, unspoken understanding. Liam was their guardian angel, appearing with hot tea, navigating traffic, and paying for gear rentals with cash from a seemingly bottomless petty cash fund. Finn was their silent oracle, appearing at odd intervals on set, observing for an hour with his arms crossed, and then disappearing again after delivering a single, gruff nod of approval that was worth more than a thousand words of praise.\n\nTheir final shot took place just before dawn on Monday morning, on the grassy slope of Primrose Hill. The sixty hours were almost up. They were all running on fumes, their bodies aching with exhaustion, their minds buzzing with a creative high. Below them, London was a vast, sleeping creature, a sea of twinkling lights under a sky that was just beginning to blush with the promise of a new day. Leo set up the final shot himself, placing the camera on a tripod. \u201cJust you and the city, Kaia,\u201d he said softly. \u201cYou\u2019re not an outsider anymore. You\u2019ve fought it, and you\u2019ve found your place in it. It\u2019s not your enemy. It\u2019s just home. For now.\u201d Kaia sat on the damp grass, her guitar across her lap. She wasn\u2019t playing, just holding it. She looked out at the sprawling, magnificent view. The city didn\u2019t feel overwhelming anymore. It felt\u2026 known. She had walked its streets, ridden its buses, felt its rain. She had poured her story into its cracks, and in return, it had given her its own raw, complicated beauty. Sal\u2019s camera rolled as the sun finally broke through the horizon, bathing her face in a soft, golden light. A genuine, un-directed smile touched her lips. It was a look of quiet, hard-won peace.\n\n\u201cAnd\u2026 cut,\u201d Leo whispered, his voice hoarse with emotion. It was over. A profound, bone-deep exhaustion settled over the small group, followed by a wave of pure, triumphant elation. They had done it. They had stolen a music video from the heart of the corporate machine. They packed up their gear in a companionable silence, the clinking of metal latches the only sound in the quiet dawn. In the back of the van, Leo immediately plugged his hard drives into his laptop, his face illuminated by the screen's glow as he started scrolling through the footage. He let out a low whistle. \u201cIt\u2019s all here,\u201d he said, his voice full of wonder. \u201cIt\u2019s all\u2026 true.\u201d He looked up at Kaia, his eyes shining with a fierce, artistic respect. \u201cThank you,\u201d he said simply.\n\nLiam drove her back to the hotel, the sky now a brilliant, hopeful blue. He pulled up to the service entrance. \u201cLeo and Rina are going straight to an edit suite Finn\u2019s \u2018borrowed\u2019 for the day,\u201d he explained. \u201cThey\u2019ll work around the clock. With any luck, we\u2019ll have a finished video to send to Simon by midnight.\u201d He looked at her, at her rain-damp hair, the dark circles of exhaustion under her eyes, the radiant happiness on her face. \u201cGo get some sleep. You\u2019ve earned it. The storm breaks today.\u201d She slipped back into her hotel room, a ghost returning to her gilded cage. The room was exactly as she had left it, pristine and silent. On the coffee table, the Syco portfolio for the \u2018Unbreakable\u2019 campaign lay where she had dropped it, a relic from a battle that had already been fought and won. She picked it up, walked over to the wastepaper basket, and dropped it in. She had no idea what would happen when Simon Cowell received their renegade video. She might get celebrated. She might get sued. She might be thrown out of the music industry before her career had even begun. But as she stood there, looking out at the city she had just claimed as her own, she didn't feel afraid. She felt free."
