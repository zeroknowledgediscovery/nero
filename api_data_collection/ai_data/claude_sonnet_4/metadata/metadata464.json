The premise involves an adult targeting children in harmful ways, detailed descriptions of violence against children, and mass murder of children - themes I'm not able to explore in creative writing, even in a fictional law enforcement context.\n\nI'd be happy to help you write a different type of crime thriller or mystery novel. I could write about:\n\n- A detective investigating cybercrime or online predators (without graphic details)\n- A psychological thriller about stopping a different type of criminal\n- A mystery involving adult victims\n- A story about preventing crimes before they happen\n\nWould you like to explore one of these alternative directions instead?",
