     "novel_text": "The morning mist clung to the cobblestones of Loughborough's Market Place like forgotten prayers, and Seraphina pulled her worn coat tighter around shoulders that had once borne wings visible to mortal eyes. Those days seemed lifetimes ago now, though she couldn't quite remember when they'd ended or why. The ache between her shoulder blades reminded her constantly of what she'd lost, a phantom pain that no earthly remedy could touch.\n\nShe stood before the window of Hartwell Contemporary Gallery, her breath fogging the glass as she studied the collection inside. The paintings called to her in ways she couldn't explain\u2014not with voice or sound, but with something deeper, more primal. Colors that shouldn't exist in the mortal realm blazed from canvases, and she recognized the brushstrokes of artists who had painted with divine inspiration, though they likely never knew it.\n\n\"Still staring at those dusty old things?\" \n\nSeraphina didn't need to turn around to know that Miriam had found her again. Her best friend had an uncanny ability to locate her wherever she wandered in this small university town, as if connected by invisible threads of concern and affection.\n\n\"They're not dusty,\" Seraphina murmured, pressing her palm against the cool window. \"They're alive.\"\n\nMiriam stepped beside her, following her gaze into the gallery's interior. At twenty-six, she was everything Seraphina appeared not to be\u2014practical, grounded, working toward her PhD in art history with methodical determination. Her dark hair was always neatly arranged, her clothes sensible and pressed, her shoes suitable for long days in libraries and lecture halls.\n\n\"The Rothko is stunning, I'll give you that,\" Miriam conceded, adjusting her wire-rimmed glasses. \"But Sera, you can't keep standing out here every morning like some sort of art-obsessed vagrant. Mrs. Henderson from the tea shop is starting to talk.\"\n\nSeraphina finally turned away from the window, and Miriam felt that familiar flutter of unease she always experienced when looking directly into her friend's eyes. They were the color of storm clouds shot through with silver lightning, ancient in a face that seemed barely twenty-one. Sometimes, in certain light, Miriam could swear she saw depths in those eyes that spoke of centuries rather than decades.\n\n\"Let her talk,\" Seraphina said, but her voice carried a weariness that didn't match her youthful appearance. \"What harm am I doing?\"\n\nThey walked together down Carillon Court, past the familiar storefronts and the early morning bustle of students heading to lectures. Loughborough was waking up around them, the autumn air crisp with promise and the faint scent of wood smoke from distant chimneys. It should have been peaceful, ordinary, but Seraphina felt restless in a way that made her skin itch and her thoughts scatter like leaves in wind.\n\n\"You're different lately,\" Miriam observed as they settled at their usual table in Caf\u00e9 Nero. She wrapped her hands around her cappuccino, studying Seraphina over the foam. \"More... distant. Like you're listening to something the rest of us can't hear.\"\n\nSeraphina traced patterns in the sugar she'd spilled on the dark wood table, her finger moving in spirals and symbols that seemed to glow faintly before fading. \"Maybe I am.\"\n\n\"Sera, I'm serious. You barely eat anymore, you never sleep\u2014I see your light on at all hours\u2014and yesterday I could have sworn you looked younger than you did last week. Which is impossible, obviously, but\u2014\"\n\n\"But what if it wasn't?\"\n\nThe question hung between them like smoke, and Miriam felt something cold settle in her stomach. There had been signs, hadn't there? Small things she'd dismissed because they made no logical sense. The way Seraphina's face seemed to grow more luminous each day, her movements more fluid, as if gravity affected her differently than other people. The way birds followed her, and how flowers turned toward her even when the sun was shining from the opposite direction.\n\n\"Don't be ridiculous,\" Miriam said, but her voice lacked conviction. \"People don't age backwards. That only happens in movies and fairy tales.\"\n\nSeraphina's laugh was like silver bells, beautiful and somehow heartbreaking. \"What if fairy tales are just truths we've forgotten how to recognize?\"\n\nBefore Miriam could respond, Seraphina was standing, leaving her untouched coffee growing cold on the table. She moved with purpose now, her earlier melancholy replaced by something sharper, more focused.\n\n\"Where are you going?\"\n\n\"Back to the gallery.\"\n\nMiriam scrambled to follow, leaving money on the table and nearly tripping over her chair in her haste. Outside, the morning had grown brighter, but there was something in the quality of light that seemed wrong, as if the sun itself was holding its breath.\n\nThey found themselves once again before Hartwell Contemporary Gallery, but this time Seraphina wasn't content to simply look. She walked the perimeter of the building with the careful attention of someone conducting surveillance, noting the placement of windows, the narrow alley that ran along the back, the security camera mounted discreetly above the entrance.\n\n\"Sera, what are you doing?\"\n\n\"Planning.\"\n\nThe single word sent ice through Miriam's veins. \"Planning what?\"\n\nSeraphina stopped walking and turned to face her friend fully. In the morning light, her skin seemed to have an inner radiance, and Miriam realized with a shock that the fine lines that had appeared around Seraphina's eyes over the past few months\u2014laugh lines and worry lines that everyone accumulated with age\u2014were gone. Completely gone.\n\n\"I'm going to take them.\"\n\n\"Take what?\"\n\n\"The paintings. The ones that call to me.\" Seraphina's voice was calm, matter-of-fact, as if she was discussing the weather or what to have for lunch. \"They don't belong in a place like this, behind glass, trapped and suffocating. They need to be free.\"\n\nMiriam grabbed her friend's arm, feeling the delicate bones beneath surprisingly strong muscle. \"You're talking about theft. About robbery. Sera, these aren't just any paintings\u2014some of them are worth millions. You could go to prison for the rest of your life.\"\n\n\"Could I?\" Seraphina tilted her head, considering this. \"I'm not sure the rest of my life is what you think it is.\"The words hung in the air between them like a challenge, and Miriam felt the familiar sensation of standing at the edge of a precipice she couldn't see. There had always been something otherworldly about Seraphina, something that made ordinary people stop and stare without quite understanding why. Miriam had attributed it to her friend's unusual beauty, the way she moved like water given form, the peculiar intensity of her gaze. But now, looking at Seraphina's face in the clear morning light, she saw something that made her academic mind rebel even as her intuition whispered terrible truths.\n\n\"What are you?\" The question escaped before Miriam could stop it, barely a whisper but carrying the weight of months of accumulated doubt and wonder.\n\nSeraphina's expression softened, and for a moment she looked almost like the young woman Miriam had befriended two years ago in the university library. Almost, but not quite. There was too much knowledge in her eyes now, too much sorrow that seemed older than the stones beneath their feet. She reached out and touched Miriam's cheek with fingers that were warmer than human flesh should be, and Miriam caught the faint scent of something that reminded her of frankincense and starlight.\n\n\"I was something beautiful once,\" Seraphina said, her voice carrying harmonics that seemed to resonate in Miriam's bones. \"Something pure and bright and terrible in the way that divine things are terrible. I sang at the throne of creation and my voice could shatter mountains or heal the deepest wounds. I was a guardian, a messenger, a warrior of light.\" Her hand dropped away, and the moment of transcendent connection broke like a soap bubble. \"But I fell, Miriam. Or maybe I jumped. The details are... unclear.\"\n\nThe rational part of Miriam's mind catalogued all the reasons this was impossible. Angels didn't exist, not in the literal sense. They were metaphors, symbols, constructs of human imagination designed to make sense of the incomprehensible. Her dissertation advisor would have her committed if she started talking about befriending a fallen seraph. But the evidence of her senses told a different story, and she'd always prided herself on following evidence wherever it led, no matter how uncomfortable the destination.\n\n\"The paintings,\" she said slowly, pieces of an impossible puzzle beginning to fit together in her mind. \"You recognize them because you've seen the places they're trying to capture. The colors that shouldn't exist here\u2014you remember them from before.\"\n\nSeraphina nodded, turning back toward the gallery window with longing written across her features like calligraphy. \"These artists, they caught glimpses somehow. Maybe in dreams, maybe in moments of perfect clarity when the veil between worlds grew thin. They painted what they saw and felt and remembered from places their souls had touched but their minds couldn't quite grasp. The Rothko especially\u2014those colors are the exact shade of the sky above the Seventh Heaven just before dawn breaks across the crystal sea.\"\n\nA group of students walked past them, chattering about weekend plans and upcoming exams, their voices bright with the careless optimism of youth. They glanced curiously at the two women standing so intently before the gallery window, but their attention moved on quickly, drawn by more immediate concerns. Neither Miriam nor Seraphina acknowledged them, too caught up in their own impossible conversation to notice the ordinary world continuing around them.\n\n\"If you're telling the truth,\" Miriam said carefully, \"if you really are what you claim to be, then why? Why steal the paintings? Surely there are better ways to\u2014to reconnect with whatever you've lost.\"\n\nSeraphina's laugh was bitter now, lacking the silver-bell quality it had possessed in the caf\u00e9. \"Better ways? Do you think I haven't tried everything else? I've prayed until my throat was raw and my knees bled from kneeling on stone floors. I've fasted until I could see through my own hands, thinking perhaps if I made myself pure enough, empty enough, the gates might open again. I've studied every religious text ever written, searching for loopholes or appeals processes or some cosmic customer service department that might hear my case.\"\n\nHer reflection in the gallery window seemed to shimmer and shift, and for just an instant Miriam thought she glimpsed something else superimposed over her friend's familiar features\u2014something with eyes like burning coals and a face that hurt to look at directly. Then it was gone, leaving only Seraphina as she always appeared, beautiful and lost and achingly human.\n\n\"Nothing worked,\" Seraphina continued, her voice dropping to barely above a whisper. \"Heaven's justice is absolute, and apparently so is its silence. But these paintings... when I look at them, I can almost remember what it felt like to have purpose. They're fragments of home, Miriam, pieces of paradise scattered through the mortal world like breadcrumbs. If I can't return to where they came from, perhaps I can bring them to me.\"\n\nThe morning was growing warmer as the sun climbed higher, and the mist that had clung to the cobblestones was beginning to evaporate. Soon the gallery would open and the ordinary business of the day would begin\u2014tourists and art students filing through to admire works they could never truly understand, critics and collectors appraising beauty with price tags and provenance. The thought of those sacred fragments being reduced to mere commodities made something twist painfully in Seraphina's chest, and she pressed her palm against the window again as if she could reach through the glass by sheer force of will.",
