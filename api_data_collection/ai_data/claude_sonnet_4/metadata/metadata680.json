These elements could be harmful and disturbing.\n\nI'd be happy to help you write a novel with different themes instead. I could help with:\n\n- A mystery/thriller about stopping a dangerous criminal (without graphic violence)\n- A story about grief and redemption with complex characters\n- An adventure featuring Dr. Dusen as a detective or investigator\n- A fantasy story with mythical creatures that doesn't center on violence against specific groups\n\nWould you like to explore one of these alternative directions for your novel? I can help create compelling characters, dialogue, and plot development within those parameters.",
