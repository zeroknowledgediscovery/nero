     "novel_text": "The morning sun cast long shadows across the marble floors of Viktor Kova\u010di\u0107's penthouse overlooking the Sava River. At thirty-four, he possessed everything money could acquire in Zagreb\u2014luxury automobiles, priceless artwork, and investments spanning three continents. Yet as he stood before his floor-to-ceiling windows, watching commuters hurry across the bridges below, an overwhelming emptiness consumed him.\n\nHis reflection stared back from the glass, revealing a man who appeared younger than his years despite the weight of responsibility that had aged his soul. Dark hair fell carelessly across his forehead, and his gray eyes held the particular weariness that came from achieving everything too easily. Viktor had inherited his father's shipping empire at twenty-five, transforming it into something far greater through shrewd decisions and calculated risks. Now, nine years later, success felt like a gilded cage.\n\n\"Another beautiful morning wasted on melancholy,\" came a cheerful voice from behind him.\n\nViktor turned to see his most trusted companion perched on the leather armchair\u2014a small finger puppet with wild orange yarn hair and button eyes that somehow conveyed more personality than most people he knew. Marko, as the puppet was called, had been with Viktor since childhood, a gift from his grandmother before she passed. What had begun as a child's toy had evolved into something far more complex over the years.\n\n\"You wouldn't understand, Marko. You don't have obligations weighing you down,\" Viktor replied, walking to his mahogany desk where morning reports awaited his attention.\n\nThe puppet tilted its diminutive head with exaggerated concern. \"Obligations? You mean counting money and attending charity galas where you pretend to care about causes you've never experienced personally?\"\n\nViktor's hand moved unconsciously, bringing Marko closer to eye level. Their conversations had become increasingly sophisticated over time, though Viktor couldn't quite explain how or when this evolution had occurred. Perhaps loneliness had a way of breathing life into imagination, or maybe there was something more mysterious at work.\n\n\"I've been thinking about joining the military,\" Viktor announced suddenly, the words surprising even himself as they left his lips.\n\nMarko's button eyes seemed to widen with genuine shock. \"The military? Viktor, my dear friend, have you completely lost your mind? You haven't done a day of physical labor in your entire privileged existence. You order groceries through an app because you find supermarkets 'overwhelming.'\"\n\n\"That's precisely why I need this,\" Viktor insisted, settling into his chair. \"I need to understand what real struggle means, what it's like to fight for something beyond profit margins and market shares. My father served in the Homeland War\u2014maybe this is my chance to honor that legacy.\"\n\nThe puppet appeared to contemplate this revelation with surprising seriousness. \"Your father fought because his country was being torn apart. You want to fight because you're bored. There's a significant difference between necessity and indulgence, Viktor.\"\n\nBefore Viktor could respond, his phone buzzed with an incoming call from his personal assistant, Ana Jurkovi\u0107. She had managed his affairs for six years with ruthless efficiency, anticipating his needs before he recognized them himself.\n\n\"Good morning, Ana,\" he answered.\n\n\"Mr. Kova\u010di\u0107, I have your mother on line two. She sounds... distressed. Also, the quarterly board meeting has been moved to this afternoon, and the Croatian Times wants to interview you about your recent charitable donations.\"\n\nViktor glanced at Marko, who was now pretending to file his tiny fingernails with complete disinterest. \"Transfer my mother, cancel the interview, and push the board meeting to tomorrow.\"\n\n\"Sir, the board meeting cannot be\u2014\"\n\n\"Ana, I'm about to make some significant life changes. Please just handle it.\"\n\nHe switched lines before she could protest further. His mother's voice filled the room with its familiar mixture of affection and exasperation.\n\n\"Viktor, darling, Ana mentioned something absolutely ridiculous about you wanting to join the army. Please tell me this is some sort of elaborate joke.\"\n\nMargarita Kova\u010di\u0107 had never been one to mince words. At sixty-two, she remained formidable\u2014a woman who had built her own successful interior design firm while raising Viktor essentially alone after his father's death. Her disapproval could cut through steel when properly applied.\n\n\"It's not a joke, Mama. I've given this considerable thought.\"\n\n\"Considerable thought? Viktor, you change your mind about dinner reservations three times a week. Now you want to make decisions involving firearms and combat training?\"\n\nMarko leaned closer to Viktor's ear, whispering loudly enough for his voice to carry: \"She has an excellent point. Remember last month when you couldn't decide between Italian and French cuisine and ended up ordering sushi?\"\n\n\"Who is that?\" his mother demanded sharply. \"Viktor, do you have someone there with you?\"\n\nViktor felt heat rise in his cheeks. \"It's... nobody, Mama. Just the television.\"\n\n\"The television doesn't make sarcastic comments about your decision-making abilities. Viktor, are you taking proper care of yourself? Perhaps you should speak with Dr. Petrov again.\"\n\nDr. Petrov was the family psychiatrist who had helped Viktor through his father's death and various other challenges over the years. The suggestion that he might need professional help stung more than Viktor cared to admit.\n\n\"I'm perfectly fine, and my decision is final. I'm meeting with a military recruiter this afternoon.\"\n\nThe silence on the other end of the line stretched uncomfortably long. When his mother finally spoke, her voice carried a tone Viktor hadn't heard since his teenage years\u2014disappointment mixed with genuine worry.\n\n\"Your father died serving his country, Viktor. He didn't choose that war; it chose him. You're choosing something you don't understand for reasons you can't properly explain. That's not honor\u2014it's selfishness dressed up as nobility.\"\n\nThe call ended abruptly, leaving Viktor staring at his phone with a mixture of guilt and determination. Marko crawled up his arm to perch on his shoulder, offering what passed for comfort from a fabric friend.\n\n\"Well, that went better than expected,\" the puppet observed dryly. \"Only one family member has declared you mentally unstable so far today. Shall we call your Uncle Tomislav for a second opinion?\"\n\nViktor stood abruptly, causing Marko to grip his shirt to avoid falling. \"Enough. I'm a grown man capable of making my own decisions. If no one else understands, then so be it.\"\n\nHe strode across the apartment to his walk-in closet, searching for something appropriate to wear to a military recruitment office. His wardrobe consisted primarily of tailored suits, casual wear that cost more than most people's monthly salaries, and formal attire for various social obligations. Nothing seemed suitable for declaring his intention to abandon luxury for service.\n\n\"Perhaps the Armani suit?\" Marko suggested helpfully. \"Nothing says 'I'm ready for military discipline' like Italian craftsmanship and silk lining.\"\n\n\"You're not helping,\" Viktor muttered, selecting his most conservative outfit\u2014dark pants and a simple white shirt that had somehow cost three hundred euros.\n\n\"I'm never helping, according to you. Yet here I am, the only one willing to accompany you on this journey of self-discovery. Your fair-weather human friends will disappear the moment you trade your platinum credit cards for military rations.\"\n\nThis observation struck Viktor with uncomfortable accuracy. His social circle consisted primarily of business associates, fellow wealthy individuals, and acquaintances drawn to his status rather than his personality. None of them would understand his desire to seek meaning through service, just as none of them had ever shown genuine concern for his emotional well-being.\n\nThe military recruitment office occupied a modest building in downtown Zagreb, far from the gleaming towers of Viktor's usual haunts. As he approached the entrance, several passersby stared at his expensive clothes and confident bearing with obvious curiosity. He felt simultaneously overdressed and underprepared.\n\n\"Last chance to reconsider,\" Marko whispered from Viktor's jacket pocket, where he had hidden for the journey. \"We could go to that new restaurant on Ilica Street instead. I hear they have excellent fish.\"\n\n\"You don't eat,\" Viktor reminded him quietly.\n\n\"I don't serve in armies either, yet here we are.\"\n\nThe recruitment office's interior was spartan but clean, with motivational posters featuring determined-looking soldiers and Croatian flags. Behind a metal desk sat Sergeant Major Ivica Novak, a man whose weathered face and rigid posture spoke of decades spent in military service. His eyes assessed Viktor with the kind of thorough evaluation reserved for potential threats or elaborate pranks.\n\n\"I'm here to inquire about enlistment,\" Viktor announced, attempting to project confidence despite feeling completely out of place.\n\nSergeant Major Novak's expression didn't change, but something skeptical flickered in his gaze. \"Name and age?\"\n\n\"Viktor Kova\u010di\u0107. I'm thirty-four years old.\"\n\n\"Occupation?\"\n\n\"I... I run several businesses. Shipping, primarily, with investments in real estate and technology.\"\n\nNow the sergeant major's eyebrows rose slightly. \"You run businesses, and you want to join the military? Mr. Kova\u010di\u0107, this isn't a weekend camping trip. This is serious commitment requiring sacrifice, discipline, and dedication to something greater than personal profit.\"\n\nFrom his pocket, Viktor heard Marko make a small snorting sound that he hoped wasn't audible to anyone else.\n\n\"I understand the seriousness of military service, Sergeant Major. That's exactly why I'm here. I want to contribute something meaningful to my country instead of simply accumulating wealth.\"\n\n\"Contributing something meaningful,\" Novak repeated slowly, as if testing the words for sincerity. \"Tell me, Mr. Kova\u010di\u0107, what military experience do you have? Any sports background? Physical training?\"\n\nViktor felt his confidence begin to waver. \"I... I work out regularly. I have a personal trainer. And I've done some hiking.\"\n\n\"Hiking.\" The sergeant major made a note on a form. \"What about handling stress? Working under pressure? Following orders from superiors who might be younger or less educated than yourself?\"\n\nThese questions struck at the heart of Viktor's uncertainty. He had always been the one giving orders, making final decisions, controlling every aspect of his environment. The idea of surrendering that autonomy both terrified and thrilled him.\n\n\"I believe I can adapt to military structure,\" he replied carefully.\n\nSergeant Major Novak studied him for a long moment before sliding several forms across the desk. \"Fill these out completely. Medical history, education, criminal background, emergency contacts. If you're serious about this, we'll schedule a full physical and psychological evaluation.\"\n\nAs Viktor began completing the paperwork, he became acutely aware of Marko shifting restlessly in his pocket. The puppet had remained unusually quiet during the interview, but Viktor could sense his growing agitation.\n\nThe forms were more invasive than Viktor had anticipated, requiring detailed information about his family, finances, relationships, and personal history. When he reached the section about emergency contacts, he hesitated. His mother was the obvious choice, but their conversation that morning suggested she would not be supportive if something happened to him during training or deployment.\n\n\"Having trouble with the forms?\" Sergeant Major Novak asked, not looking up from his own paperwork.\n\n\"Just... considering my options,\" Viktor replied.\n\nHe listed his mother's information and Ana's as well, then paused at a question about dependents or family members who might be affected by his military service. Technically, he had no dependents, but somehow leaving that section completely blank felt like denying Marko's existence entirely.\n\n\"This is ridiculous,\" he muttered under his breath.\n\n\"What was that?\" the sergeant major inquired.\n\n\"Nothing. Just talking to myself.\"\n\n\"That's a habit you'll need to break. Military service requires clear communication and mental discipline. Talking to yourself suggests scattered thinking.\"\n\nViktor completed the forms as thoroughly as possible, omitting only his relationship with Marko, which he couldn't have explained even if he'd wanted to. When he returned the paperwork, Sergeant Major Novak reviewed it quickly, his expression revealing nothing.\n\n\"We'll contact you within a week to schedule your evaluations. In the meantime, I suggest you begin preparing physically and mentally for what military service actually entails. Read about military history, start running longer distances, and think seriously about whether you're prepared to give up your comfortable lifestyle for something that will challenge everything you think you know about yourself.\"\n\nOutside the recruitment office, Viktor felt a mixture of excitement and dread. He had taken the first step toward changing his life completely, but the magnitude of that change was only beginning to register.\n\n\"Well, that was enlightening,\" Marko commented once they were safely in Viktor's car. \"Nothing like being interrogated about your fitness for military service to put your life choices in perspective.\"\n\n\"He was just doing his job,\" Viktor replied, starting the engine.\n\n\"His job is to weed out wealthy dilettantes who confuse boredom with patriotism. You made quite an impression with your hiking experience and personal trainer.\"\n\nViktor drove through Zagreb's afternoon traffic in thoughtful silence. The city looked different somehow, as if his decision to join the military had shifted his perspective on everything familiar. The cafes where he regularly met business associates, the shops where he bought expensive clothes without consideration of price, the restaurants where he dined alone while conducting business calls\u2014all of it seemed suddenly frivolous.\n\nHis phone rang as he navigated through a construction zone near the city center. Ana's name appeared on the display, and he answered reluctantly.\n\n\"Mr. Kova\u010di\u0107, I've managed to postpone the board meeting, but several members are asking questions about your availability. Also, your mother called three times, and there are reporters outside your building asking about rumors that you're joining the military. How would you like me to handle the media attention?\"\n\nViktor hadn't considered that his decision might become public knowledge so quickly. In a city like Zagreb, news traveled fast, especially when it involved prominent business figures making unexpected choices.\n\n\"No comments to the press. If the board members have concerns, schedule individual meetings later this week. And please ask building security to ensure my privacy is maintained.\"\n\n\"Of course. Will you be in the office tomorrow?\"\n\nViktor realized he hadn't thought about his business obligations in relation to his military plans. If he was accepted for service, someone would need to manage his affairs, possibly for months or years.\n\n\"We need to discuss contingency plans, Ana. If I'm deployed, you'll need expanded authority to handle day-to-day operations.\"\n\nThe silence on the phone suggested Ana was processing this information with her characteristic thoroughness.\n\n\"Sir, are you certain about this decision? Your businesses require hands-on leadership, and your investors rely on your personal involvement in strategic decisions.\"\n\n\"I'm certain,\" Viktor said, though he wondered if that was entirely true.\n\nThat evening, Viktor sat in his living room with a glass of wine, researching military service online while Marko provided commentary from his perch on the coffee table. The puppet had been unusually animated since their visit to the recruitment office, as if Viktor's decision to pursue military service had energized him in unexpected ways.**Chapter 2**\n\nThe week that followed Viktor's visit to the recruitment office passed with agonizing slowness. Each morning brought the same routine\u2014coffee on the terrace, reviewing business reports, and waiting for the phone call that would determine his future. Marko had grown increasingly philosophical during this period, offering observations about the nature of waiting and the peculiar anxiety that accompanied voluntary uncertainty.\n\n\"You know what's fascinating about this situation?\" the puppet mused from his usual spot on Viktor's shoulder as they watched the sunrise over Zagreb. \"For the first time in your adult life, you've initiated something where you're not guaranteed the outcome you want. It's quite refreshing to see you experience actual suspense.\"\n\nViktor adjusted his position in the outdoor chair, feeling the morning chill through his silk pajamas. The city below was awakening with its familiar sounds\u2014traffic beginning to build, construction crews starting their work, the distant hum of life carrying on regardless of his personal transformation. \"I've taken plenty of business risks over the years. This isn't entirely different.\"\n\n\"Oh, but it is,\" Marko insisted, his button eyes catching the early light. \"Business risks are calculated. You analyze market conditions, study your competitors, project potential outcomes. This military adventure of yours is pure leap of faith. You have no idea what you're jumping into, and that terrifies you in the most delicious way.\"\n\nThe truth in Marko's observation was unsettling. Viktor had built his success on careful planning and thorough preparation. He studied every deal from multiple angles, consulted experts, and rarely made decisions without comprehensive understanding of the consequences. Now he was contemplating a complete life change based primarily on emotional impulse and vague notions about finding meaning through service.\n\nHis phone buzzed with a text message from Ana, reminding him about a conference call with investors in London. The normalcy of business obligations felt increasingly surreal as he prepared to potentially abandon everything he had worked to build. How did one explain to shareholders that their CEO was considering trading boardrooms for barracks, profit margins for military discipline?\n\nThe conference call proceeded with its usual efficiency, discussions of quarterly projections and market expansion opportunities. Viktor participated automatically, his mind wandering to questions about basic training, deployment possibilities, and whether his decision to pursue military service represented courage or elaborate self-destruction. His colleagues in London noticed nothing unusual in his demeanor, which suggested either his acting skills were improving or his business persona had always been somewhat disconnected from his authentic self.\n\n\"Excellent work on the Romanian shipping contract, Viktor,\" came the voice of James Morrison, his primary contact in London. \"The profit margins exceeded our projections by twelve percent. Your negotiation skills continue to impress our board of directors.\"\n\n\"Thank you, James. The Romanian market has significant potential for expansion if we maintain our current approach.\" The words felt hollow as Viktor spoke them, like reciting lines from a play he no longer wanted to perform. Somewhere in the background, he could hear Marko making soft gagging sounds that threatened to disrupt his professional composure.\n\nAfter ending the call, Viktor found himself staring at his reflection in the darkened computer screen. The man looking back appeared successful, confident, and completely in control of his circumstances. Yet beneath that polished exterior lurked growing uncertainty about everything he had previously considered important. Money, status, professional achievement\u2014all of it seemed increasingly meaningless when measured against the possibility of genuine purpose.\n\n\"Identity crisis looks good on you,\" Marko observed from his position on the desk. \"Very existential, very sophisticated. You should consider writing poetry about your inner turmoil. Something dark and introspective about the burden of wealth.\"\n\n\"I'm not having an identity crisis,\" Viktor protested, though the denial felt unconvincing even to himself. \"I'm simply exploring new opportunities for personal growth and contribution to society.\"\n\n\"Personal growth and contribution to society,\" the puppet repeated in a mocking tone. \"You sound like a motivational seminar or a political campaign advertisement. Why can't you just admit that you're desperately unhappy with your current life and hoping that playing soldier will somehow fix whatever's broken inside you?\"\n\nThe bluntness of Marko's assessment stung because it contained uncomfortable truth. Viktor's dissatisfaction had been building for years, masked by material success and social obligations but never truly addressed. He had assumed that achieving his father's dreams and exceeding his business goals would provide lasting fulfillment, but instead he felt trapped in a gilded cage of his own construction.\n\nHis contemplation was interrupted by the arrival of his mother, who let herself into the apartment using the spare key Viktor had given her years earlier. Margarita Kova\u010di\u0107 entered like a force of nature, her heels clicking authoritatively across the marble floors as she surveyed her son's domain with maternal concern mixed with barely contained exasperation.\n\n\"Viktor, we need to discuss this military nonsense before you do something permanently stupid,\" she announced without preamble, settling into the leather chair across from his desk. Her designer handbag landed on the coffee table with decisive finality, suggesting this would not be a brief conversation.\n\nMarko immediately scrambled down Viktor's arm and positioned himself behind a stack of business journals, apparently recognizing the need for discretion during family confrontations. Viktor had never fully explained his relationship with the puppet to his mother, though she had occasionally made comments about his \"unusual attachment to childhood memories\" that suggested some awareness of the situation.\n\n\"Good afternoon, Mama. You look lovely today,\" Viktor offered, hoping to deflect the conversation with pleasantries.\n\n\"Don't charm me, Viktor. I raised you, which means I'm immune to your manipulation tactics. I've spent the week researching military service, and everything I've learned confirms that this decision is completely inappropriate for someone in your position.\" She opened her handbag and extracted several printed articles, spreading them across his desk like evidence in a legal proceeding.\n\nViktor glanced at the materials\u2014statistics about military casualties, articles about the psychological challenges of combat deployment, reports on the difficulties veterans faced when transitioning back to civilian life. His mother had approached his potential military service with the same thorough preparation she brought to her interior design projects, gathering comprehensive information before forming her conclusions.\n\n\"I appreciate your research, but these articles focus on combat situations. I'm not necessarily seeking deployment to active conflict zones,\" Viktor explained, though he realized he hadn't actually specified his preferences to the recruiter.\n\n\"Military service isn't a hobby, Viktor. You don't join the army for personal enrichment like you're taking up painting or learning a new language. Soldiers serve where they're needed, when they're needed, doing whatever tasks their country requires. Your individual preferences are irrelevant once you take the oath.\"\n\nMargarita's tone carried the authority of someone who had lived through actual military conflict, who had lost her husband to war and understood its true costs in ways Viktor could only imagine. Her opposition to his plans wasn't merely maternal overprotectiveness but informed concern based on genuine experience with military life and its consequences.\n\n\"Your father didn't choose to serve, Viktor. War came to our country, and he responded out of necessity, not adventure-seeking. He left behind a wife, a young son, and a business he had worked years to build. Do you think he wanted to abandon everything he loved to fight in trenches and dodge sniper fire? Do you imagine he found military service personally fulfilling?\"\n\nThe comparison to his father's situation was particularly painful because Viktor had always struggled to live up to his memory. Dragan Kova\u010di\u0107 had been respected as both a businessman and a patriot, someone who served his country when called upon but never confused duty with self-indulgence. Viktor's desire to join the military voluntarily might appear honorable on the surface, but his mother's questions forced him to examine his motivations more critically.\n\n\"I'm not trying to recreate Papa's experience,\" he said carefully. \"I'm attempting to find my own path toward meaningful contribution.\"\n\n\"Meaningful contribution,\" his mother repeated, echoing Marko's earlier mockery of his language. \"Viktor, you employ over two hundred people directly and thousands more through your various business interests. You provide shipping services that support international trade and economic development. You donate substantial amounts to charitable causes throughout Croatia. How is that not meaningful contribution?\"\n\nFrom behind the business journals, Viktor could hear Marko making soft applause sounds, apparently appreciating his mother's logical arguments. The puppet had always been fond of Margarita, perhaps because they shared a certain directness in addressing Viktor's self-deceptions and questionable decisions.\n\n\"Those contributions feel abstract,\" Viktor admitted. \"I write checks and attend board meetings, but I don't see the direct impact of my work on people's lives. Military service would provide tangible purpose, clear objectives, and immediate results.\"\n\n\"Military service would provide an escape from adult responsibilities,\" his mother countered sharply. \"You want someone else to make your decisions, tell you what to do, and provide external structure because you've grown bored with the freedom that success has given you. That's not noble purpose\u2014it's elaborate avoidance of the real work of building a meaningful life within your current circumstances.\"\n\nThe accuracy of this assessment was devastating because it suggested that his military aspirations were motivated by weakness rather than strength, by desire to escape rather than desire to serve. Viktor had convinced himself that joining the army represented courage and sacrifice, but his mother's analysis revealed it might actually be the opposite\u2014a privileged man's attempt to avoid the genuine challenges of using his advantages constructively.\n\n\"Perhaps,\" Viktor said quietly, \"but I need to explore this possibility before I can know for certain what my true motivations are.\"\n\nMargarita studied her son's face with the penetrating gaze that had always been able to discern his emotional state regardless of his attempts at concealment. After several moments of silence, her expression softened slightly, though her concern remained evident.\n\n\"Viktor, I understand that you're searching for something more than material success. Your father went through similar questioning when you were young, before the war gave him other priorities. But running away from your current life won't provide the answers you're seeking. Meaningful purpose isn't found by changing your circumstances\u2014it's created by changing your approach to existing circumstances.\"\n\nBefore Viktor could respond, his phone rang with the call he had been anticipating all week. The recruitment office number appeared on the display, and both Viktor and his mother stared at the device as if it were a ticking bomb. This conversation would determine whether his military aspirations could proceed or whether they would remain theoretical exploration of alternative life paths.\n\n\"I need to take this,\" Viktor said, reaching for the phone.\n\nHis mother nodded grimly, settling back in her chair to listen to whatever news would emerge from this pivotal conversation. Behind the business journals, Marko poked his small head up to observe the proceedings, his button eyes reflecting the tension that filled the room.\n\n\"Viktor Kova\u010di\u0107 speaking,\" he answered, attempting to sound confident despite his racing heartbeat.\n\n\"Mr. Kova\u010di\u0107, this is Sergeant Major Novak from the recruitment office. We've reviewed your application materials and scheduled your physical and psychological evaluations. Can you come in tomorrow morning at eight o'clock?\"\n\nThe matter-of-fact tone suggested this was routine procedure rather than indication of whether Viktor's application would ultimately be accepted. He glanced at his mother, who was watching him with barely concealed anxiety, then at Marko, who appeared to be holding his breath despite not actually needing to breathe.\n\n\"Yes, I can be there at eight tomorrow morning. What should I bring or do to prepare?\"\n\n\"Wear comfortable athletic clothing and bring identification. The evaluations will take most of the day. We'll determine your suitability for military service based on the results and contact you by the end of the week with our decision.\"\n\nAfter ending the call, Viktor sat in silence while his mother and Marko waited for him to share the details of the conversation. The reality of actually proceeding with military evaluations made his decision feel suddenly concrete in ways that filled him with equal parts excitement and terror.\n\n\"Tomorrow morning,\" he announced finally. \"Physical and psychological evaluations to determine if I'm suitable for military service.\"\n\nMargarita closed her eyes briefly, as if processing this information required significant emotional preparation. When she opened them again, her expression had shifted from opposition to resigned concern, the look of someone who recognized that further argument would be futile.\n\n\"If you're determined to proceed with this evaluation, then I suppose I should wish you success,\" she said carefully. \"But Viktor, please remember that proving you're capable of military service doesn't mean you should pursue military service. Capability and wisdom are not always the same thing.\"**Chapter 3**\n\nThe alarm clock's harsh buzzing at six o'clock the next morning found Viktor already awake, having spent most of the night alternating between nervous anticipation and profound second-guessing of his decision. He had laid out his athletic clothes the evening before\u2014simple black shorts, a gray t-shirt, and running shoes that had seen more treadmill time than actual outdoor exercise. Now, staring at the modest outfit, he felt a strange disconnect from his usual morning routine of selecting expensive suits and coordinating accessories for business meetings.\n\nMarko sat propped against the bedside lamp, having maintained a vigil throughout Viktor's restless night. The puppet's button eyes reflected the early morning light streaming through the windows, and his usually animated demeanor had given way to something resembling solemnity. Their conversations during the dark hours had ranged from practical concerns about the day's evaluations to deeper philosophical questions about the nature of identity and the courage required for genuine transformation.\n\n\"You know, I've been thinking about what your mother said yesterday,\" Marko offered as Viktor pulled on his athletic shirt. \"About meaningful purpose being created through changing your approach to existing circumstances rather than changing the circumstances themselves. There's considerable wisdom in that perspective, even if it's not what you want to hear right now.\"\n\nViktor paused in his preparation, considering the puppet's observation. \"Perhaps, but how does one change their approach when the current approach has led to such profound dissatisfaction? Sometimes radical change in circumstances is necessary to discover who you truly are beneath the expectations and assumptions others have built around you.\"\n\n\"Or sometimes radical change is simply another form of avoidance, dressed up in noble language to make it seem like growth rather than escape.\" Marko's tone carried a gentleness that made his challenging words easier to accept. \"I'm not saying your desire for military service is wrong, Viktor. I'm suggesting that understanding your true motivations might be more important than the specific path you choose to follow.\"\n\nThe drive to the recruitment office took Viktor through parts of Zagreb he rarely visited, working-class neighborhoods where people were beginning their daily routines with the kind of purposeful energy that came from necessity rather than choice. He observed construction workers gathering at job sites, parents walking children to school, shop owners preparing their businesses for another day of serving their communities. All of these people seemed to possess something Viktor felt he lacked\u2014a clear understanding of their role in the world and their contribution to something larger than themselves.\n\nAt a traffic light, he noticed an older man in military fatigues waiting at a bus stop, probably heading to work at one of the military installations outside the city. The man's bearing spoke of decades of service, of discipline earned through experience rather than imposed from outside. Viktor wondered if he would ever develop that kind of authentic authority, or if his privileged background would always mark him as someone playing at being a soldier rather than truly becoming one.\n\n\"Second thoughts?\" Marko inquired from the passenger seat, where he had positioned himself to observe the journey.\n\n\"Continuous thoughts,\" Viktor replied honestly. \"Not second thoughts, but layered thoughts. I'm simultaneously convinced this is the right decision and terrified it's completely wrong. I suppose that suggests it's genuinely important to me, since trivial decisions don't generate this level of internal conflict.\"\n\nThe recruitment office appeared different in the early morning light, more official and intimidating than it had seemed during his initial visit. Several other potential recruits were already waiting outside, most of them significantly younger than Viktor and displaying the kind of easy confidence that came from physical fitness and familiarity with challenge. He felt suddenly conscious of his age, his soft hands, and his complete inexperience with the kind of life he was attempting to enter.\n\nSergeant Major Novak emerged from the building precisely at eight o'clock, his uniform impeccable and his manner suggesting no tolerance for delay or uncertainty. He surveyed the assembled group with the practiced assessment of someone who had seen thousands of potential soldiers and developed reliable instincts about who would succeed and who would fail.\n\n\"Gentlemen, you're here because you've expressed interest in serving your country through military service. Today we'll determine whether that interest is backed by the physical capability, mental stability, and genuine commitment required for success in demanding circumstances. Some of you will proceed to the next phase of the recruitment process. Others will discover that military service is not appropriate for their current situation. Both outcomes are valuable if they lead to honest self-understanding.\"\n\nViktor found himself standing between a twenty-two-year-old university student who had been discussing his athletic achievements with obvious pride and a thirty-year-old mechanic who possessed the kind of practical confidence that came from working with his hands and solving real problems. Both men seemed to belong in this environment in ways that made Viktor's presence feel like an elaborate costume party where he hadn't quite mastered the appropriate character.\n\nThe physical evaluation began with basic measurements and medical history review, followed by tests of cardiovascular fitness, strength, and coordination. Viktor had maintained reasonable physical condition through regular gym workouts and occasional tennis games, but the military standards revealed how different recreational fitness was from functional capability. The running portion of the test left him winded in ways that suggested months of serious training would be required before he could match the performance of candidates with manual labor backgrounds.\n\nDuring the strength assessment, Viktor struggled with exercises that the younger candidates completed with ease. His personal trainer had focused on maintaining his physique for aesthetic and general health purposes rather than developing the kind of practical strength needed for carrying equipment, digging trenches, or performing the countless physical tasks that comprised military life. The gap between his comfortable gym workouts and actual physical demands became embarrassingly apparent as the evaluation progressed.\n\n\"Mr. Kova\u010di\u0107,\" Sergeant Major Novak called during a brief rest period. \"How would you assess your performance so far today?\"\n\nThe question was clearly designed to test Viktor's self-awareness and honesty rather than simply gather information. Around them, other candidates were breathing heavily but showing signs of recovery that suggested better baseline fitness than Viktor currently possessed.\n\n\"I'm performing below the standards I expected of myself,\" Viktor admitted, wiping sweat from his forehead with a towel provided by the testing staff. \"My regular exercise routine has not prepared me adequately for these demands. However, I believe I could reach required fitness levels with proper training and commitment to improvement.\"\n\nNovak nodded approvingly at the honest assessment. \"Recognizing your current limitations is more valuable than pretending they don't exist. Military training is designed to build capability in individuals who demonstrate potential and determination rather than requiring perfection from the beginning. Your willingness to acknowledge weakness suggests you might be capable of addressing it constructively.\"\n\nThe psychological evaluation proved more challenging in different ways. Viktor found himself in a small office across from a military psychologist, Dr. Petra Kralj, whose questions probed into his motivations, family background, and emotional stability with the kind of professional thoroughness that made casual deception impossible. She had clearly reviewed his application materials carefully and developed specific concerns about his suitability for military service.\n\n\"Mr. Kova\u010di\u0107, your application indicates considerable business success and financial security. Most people in your position seek ways to maintain and expand their advantages rather than voluntarily subjecting themselves to military discipline and potential danger. Help me understand what's driving this decision,\" Dr. Kralj began, her pen poised over a notepad that would presumably capture his responses for later analysis.\n\nViktor had prepared for this question during his sleepless night, but sitting in the clinical environment made his prepared answers feel inadequate and somewhat artificial. \"I've achieved the goals I set for myself professionally and financially, but I find myself questioning whether those achievements have contributed anything meaningful to my community or country. Military service represents an opportunity to use whatever capabilities I possess in service of something larger than personal profit.\"\n\n\"That's a thoughtful response, but it doesn't fully address the question of timing and method. There are many ways to contribute to community and country that wouldn't require abandoning your current responsibilities and capabilities. Why military service specifically, and why now?\" Dr. Kralj's follow-up questions demonstrated the kind of logical persistence that made superficial explanations impossible to maintain.\n\nViktor realized that his surface-level justifications were being systematically dismantled by someone trained to identify the psychological complexities behind major life decisions. \"I suppose I need to prove to myself that I'm capable of functioning in an environment where my background provides no advantages, where I'm evaluated purely on my ability to meet standards and contribute to group objectives. My current life feels insulated from real consequence and genuine challenge.\"\n\n\"So military service is a form of personal testing rather than genuine desire to serve?\" The psychologist's question was phrased neutrally, but Viktor sensed that his answer would be crucial to her assessment of his suitability.\n\n\"Both, I think. I can't separate my desire to serve from my need to test myself, because I'm not certain I have anything valuable to offer until I understand what I'm truly capable of when everything comfortable and familiar is removed.\" The honesty of this response surprised Viktor himself, as he hadn't fully articulated this connection between service and self-discovery even in his private thoughts.\n\nDr. Kralj made several notes before continuing with questions about his family relationships, social support systems, and methods of handling stress and conflict. Viktor found himself discussing his mother's opposition to his military plans, his relative isolation despite business success, and his tendency to make major decisions independently rather than seeking input from others. As the conversation progressed, he began to see patterns in his behavior that suggested both strengths and potential problems for military adaptation.\n\n\"Tell me about your support systems outside of work. Close friendships, romantic relationships, hobbies or activities that provide personal satisfaction,\" Dr. Kralj requested, and Viktor felt a familiar discomfort with questions that revealed the limitations of his social connections.\n\n\"I have business associates and social acquaintances, but few relationships I would characterize as close friendships. My work has been demanding, and I've tended to prioritize professional obligations over personal relationships. As for romantic involvement, there's been no one serious in recent years.\" Viktor paused, aware that his response painted a picture of isolation that might be concerning to a psychologist evaluating his emotional stability.\n\nWhat he couldn't explain was how Marko had filled some of the void left by limited human connections, providing companionship and honest feedback that his business relationships rarely offered. The puppet's presence in his life would be impossible to discuss without raising questions about his psychological state that would certainly disqualify him from military service. Yet omitting this significant relationship meant presenting an incomplete picture of his emotional landscape.\n\n\"Social isolation can be particularly challenging in military environments, which rely heavily on unit cohesion and mutual support among service members. How do you think you would adapt to living and working in close proximity with others, following orders from superiors, and potentially placing your life in the hands of people you've just met?\" Dr. Kralj's question highlighted one of Viktor's deepest concerns about military life.\n\n\"I acknowledge that would be a significant adjustment for me. I'm accustomed to independence and control over my environment. However, I believe that learning to function effectively within military structure would be valuable personal development, regardless of whether I ultimately pursue a long-term military career.\" Viktor tried to frame his inexperience with interdependence as an opportunity for growth rather than a liability that would hinder his military effectiveness.\n\nThe psychological evaluation continued for over an hour, covering topics from his relationship with authority figures to his methods of handling frustration and disappointment. Dr. Kralj's questions were designed to reveal both conscious and unconscious motivations, and Viktor found himself sharing thoughts and feelings he rarely acknowledged even to himself. The process was exhausting in ways that physical exertion hadn't been, requiring a level of self-examination that his comfortable life had rarely demanded.\n\nWhen the evaluations finally concluded in the late afternoon, Viktor felt simultaneously drained and oddly relieved. He had presented himself as honestly as possible given the constraints of the situation, and now the decision about his military suitability would be made by others based on objective criteria rather than his own self-assessment. There was something liberating about surrendering control of the outcome after months of internal debate and uncertainty.\n\n\"Results will be available by Friday,\" Sergeant Major Novak informed the candidates as they prepared to leave. \"Regardless of whether you're accepted for military service, today's experience should have provided valuable insights into your current capabilities and areas for potential improvement. Use that information constructively, whatever path you choose to follow.\"\n\nThe drive home gave Viktor time to process the day's experiences and consider what he had learned about himself through the evaluation process. His physical limitations had been humbling but not entirely surprising, and they represented challenges that could be addressed through dedicated training. The psychological assessment had been more revealing, forcing him to confront the extent of his social isolation and his tendency to use major life changes as substitutes for addressing underlying issues with his current circumstances.\n\nMarko had remained silent throughout the journey to and from the recruitment office, hidden in Viktor's gym bag and presumably observing everything without being able to comment. Now, as they sat in the apartment's living room with the city lights beginning to twinkle below, the puppet seemed eager to discuss the day's events and their implications for Viktor's future decisions.\n\n\"Well, that was certainly educational,\" Marko observed, positioning himself on the coffee table where he could face Viktor directly. \"Nothing like a thorough military evaluation to reveal the gaps between self-perception and objective reality. How are you feeling about your performance today?\"\n\nViktor considered the question while pouring himself a glass of wine, his first alcohol in several days as he had attempted to prepare his body for the physical demands of the evaluation. \"Humbled, primarily. I knew intellectually that military life would be different from business life, but experiencing the actual requirements made those differences much more concrete and challenging than I had anticipated.\"\n\n\"And the psychological evaluation? I noticed you were quite subdued when you returned to collect me from the gym bag. Dr. Kralj must have asked some pointed questions about your motivations and mental state.\" Marko's button eyes seemed particularly attentive as he waited for Viktor's response to this more sensitive topic.\n\n\"She was thorough and professional, but her questions forced me to examine aspects of my decision that I hadn't fully considered. The distinction between wanting to serve and needing to prove something to myself, the role that social isolation might be playing in my desire to join a structured group environment, the possibility that I'm using military service as an escape from problems that would still exist when I returned to civilian life.\" Viktor found himself grateful for Marko's presence and perspective, even as he remained unable to explain their relationship to others.\n\n\"Those are important distinctions,\" the puppet agreed thoughtfully. \"Military service motivated primarily by personal need rather than genuine desire to serve might not be sustainable when faced with real hardship and danger. On the other hand, complex motivations don't necessarily invalidate the desire to contribute something meaningful to your country's defense.\"\n\nTheir conversation was interrupted by Viktor's phone ringing with a call from Ana, who had been managing his business affairs with her usual efficiency while he focused on military preparations. Her voice carried a note of concern that suggested complications had arisen in his absence, the kind of issues that required his personal attention and decision-making authority.\n\n\"Mr. Kova\u010di\u0107, I'm sorry to disturb you this evening, but we've received an urgent request from our Romanian partners about the shipping contract you negotiated last month. There are questions about delivery schedules that they want to discuss with you personally tomorrow morning. Also, your mother called to ask about your evaluation today, and there are three reporters who somehow obtained your mobile number and want to interview you about your military plans.\"\n\nThe intrusion of normal business concerns and media attention felt jarring after a day spent focused entirely on physical capability and psychological fitness for military service. Viktor realized that his attempt to pursue military service was creating complications for his existing responsibilities that he hadn't fully anticipated, and that his decision would affect not only his own life but also the livelihoods of people who depended on his business leadership.\n\n\"Schedule the call with Romania for tomorrow afternoon, tell my mother I'll contact her this evening, and refer any media inquiries to our standard policy of not commenting on personal matters,\" Viktor instructed, though he wondered how long he could maintain separation between his public role as a business leader and his private exploration of alternative life paths.\n\nAfter ending the call, he found Marko watching him with an expression that seemed to combine sympathy with gentle amusement at the complexity Viktor had created for himself through his military aspirations.\n\n\"Nothing like a little reality intrusion to remind you that major life changes involve more than just personal transformation,\" the puppet observed wryly. \"Your business partners and employees have legitimate interests in your decisions that extend beyond your individual quest for meaning and purpose.\"\n\nViktor nodded grimly, recognizing that his romantic notions about abandoning his comfortable life for military service had overlooked the practical responsibilities and relationships that couldn't be easily abandoned or transferred to others. Whatever decision emerged from his military evaluation would need to account for these broader considerations, making his choice more complex than simply determining whether he was capable of military service.**Chapter 4**\n\nThe three days between Viktor's military evaluation and the promised results felt like an eternity suspended between two entirely different versions of his future. Wednesday brought the scheduled conference call with the Romanian partners, during which Viktor found himself negotiating shipping schedules and profit margins while simultaneously wondering if he would soon be learning to disassemble rifles and navigate obstacle courses. The cognitive dissonance between his business persona and his potential military identity created a strange sense of living in parallel realities, neither of which felt entirely authentic or sustainable.\n\nMarko had taken to offering running commentary on this internal division, perching on Viktor's shoulder during business calls and whispering observations about the absurdity of discussing quarterly projections when Viktor's mind was occupied with questions about basic training and deployment possibilities. The puppet seemed to find particular amusement in Viktor's attempts to maintain professional focus while privately rehearsing how he would respond to either acceptance or rejection of his military application. During a particularly tedious discussion of shipping insurance policies, Marko had suggested that Viktor should mention his potential military service as a way to make the conversation more interesting, a suggestion that Viktor had ignored with considerable effort.\n\nThursday morning brought an unexpected visit from his Uncle Tomislav, his father's younger brother who had served alongside Dragan during the Homeland War and maintained connections within Croatia's military community. Tomislav's appearance at Viktor's apartment was unprecedented, as their relationship had remained cordial but distant since his father's death, limited primarily to brief conversations at family gatherings and occasional business referrals. His presence suggested that news of Viktor's military aspirations had spread beyond his immediate family and attracted attention from quarters Viktor hadn't anticipated.\n\n\"Viktor, we need to discuss this military situation before you make any irreversible decisions,\" Tomislav announced as he settled into the living room's leather furniture, his weathered hands wrapped around the coffee cup Viktor had offered him. At fifty-eight, Tomislav bore the physical marks of his military service\u2014a slight limp from shrapnel wounds, scars on his left hand from combat injuries, and the particular alertness that came from years of training to notice potential threats. His civilian clothes couldn't entirely mask the bearing of someone who had spent decades in uniform, and his presence filled the apartment with an authority that made Viktor feel like a child playing at adult decisions.\n\nMarko had quickly hidden himself behind a decorative vase when Tomislav arrived, apparently recognizing that their conversation would require Viktor's complete attention without the distraction of puppet-based commentary. Viktor found himself missing the moral support of his unusual companion, particularly when facing a family member whose military experience provided the kind of credibility Viktor lacked in evaluating his own aspirations. Tomislav's opinions about military service carried weight that couldn't be dismissed as maternal overprotectiveness or civilian ignorance about the realities of military life.\n\n\"I understand your concerns, Uncle, but I've given this decision considerable thought and proceeded through the proper evaluation process. Whatever the recruitment office decides about my suitability will be based on professional assessment rather than family opinions about what's appropriate for someone in my position,\" Viktor replied, attempting to project confidence despite feeling increasingly uncertain about his motivations and capabilities as more people questioned his judgment.\n\nTomislav studied his nephew with the kind of penetrating gaze that seemed to see through surface explanations to underlying truths, a skill developed through years of evaluating soldiers under stress and making life-or-death decisions based on accurate assessment of human capabilities. His expression suggested neither approval nor disapproval but rather the careful consideration of someone weighing complex factors before offering judgment. When he finally spoke, his words carried the authority of experience rather than mere opinion.\n\n\"Viktor, military service isn't about proving yourself or finding meaning through hardship. Those might be side effects of military life, but they're not its purpose. Soldiers serve because their country needs protection, because someone has to stand between civilians and those who would harm them. If you're joining the military primarily for personal reasons\u2014to test yourself, to escape boredom, to find purpose\u2014then you're approaching it from the wrong direction, and that will create problems for both you and the people who have to depend on you in dangerous situations.\"\n\nThe directness of this assessment cut through Viktor's carefully constructed justifications and forced him to confront questions he had been avoiding about the distinction between service motivated by genuine commitment to others versus service motivated primarily by personal need. His uncle's combat experience provided perspective on the life-or-death consequences of military service that Viktor's comfortable civilian life had never required him to consider seriously. The possibility that his personal motivations might compromise his effectiveness as a soldier or endanger his fellow service members introduced moral dimensions to his decision that extended far beyond his individual quest for meaning and purpose.\n\n\"I want to serve my country, Uncle. The personal benefits are secondary to the desire to contribute something meaningful to Croatia's defense,\" Viktor insisted, though he wondered if this distinction was as clear in his own mind as he was attempting to make it sound to his uncle.\n\n\"Contributing to Croatia's defense is admirable, but there are many ways to serve your country that don't involve military service. You employ hundreds of people, pay substantial taxes, and contribute to economic development that strengthens our nation's foundation. Your shipping business supports international trade relationships that benefit Croatia's position in global markets. Why isn't that contribution sufficient? What specifically do you hope to accomplish through military service that you cannot accomplish through your current civilian role?\" Tomislav's questions echoed concerns that Viktor's mother and Dr. Kralj had raised, creating a pattern of challenges to his reasoning that was becoming increasingly difficult to dismiss or rationalize.\n\nViktor found himself struggling to articulate specific military objectives beyond vague notions about testing his character and proving his worth through service. The more people questioned his motivations, the more he realized how much of his decision was based on emotional impulse rather than rational analysis of how his capabilities could best serve his country's needs. His business success demonstrated his ability to contribute meaningfully to Croatia's prosperity, but he had convinced himself that civilian contribution was somehow less valuable or authentic than military service, a belief that was becoming harder to defend under scrutiny from people with actual military experience.\n\n\"Perhaps I need to understand what real service means before I can effectively contribute through civilian means,\" Viktor offered, recognizing even as he spoke that this justification sounded increasingly weak and self-serving. \"Military experience might provide perspective that would make my civilian contributions more meaningful and effective.\"\n\nTomislav's expression shifted to something that might have been sympathy mixed with concern, the look of someone who recognized sincere confusion beneath misguided reasoning. He leaned forward in his chair, his voice taking on the tone of someone sharing hard-earned wisdom rather than simply offering criticism. \"Viktor, military service will certainly provide perspective, but it's not the kind of perspective that necessarily translates into improved civilian leadership. Military experience teaches you to function within hierarchical structures, to follow orders without question, to prioritize group objectives over individual preferences. Those skills can be valuable, but they're quite different from the independent thinking and strategic decision-making that have made you successful in business. You might find that military service actually conflicts with rather than enhances your civilian capabilities.\"\n\nThis possibility had not occurred to Viktor during his months of contemplating military service. He had assumed that military discipline and leadership training would complement and improve his business skills, but his uncle's analysis suggested that military and civilian leadership might require fundamentally different approaches that could interfere with each other rather than creating synergistic benefits. The idea that military service might actually diminish his effectiveness in his current role introduced new complications to his decision-making process that he hadn't anticipated.\n\nTheir conversation was interrupted by Viktor's phone ringing with the call he had been anticipating and dreading in equal measure. The recruitment office number appeared on the display, and both Viktor and Tomislav fell silent as they recognized the significance of this moment. The conversation with Sergeant Major Novak would determine whether Viktor's military aspirations could proceed beyond theoretical consideration to actual implementation, and whatever news emerged would shape not only Viktor's immediate future but also his understanding of his own capabilities and limitations.\n\n\"Viktor Kova\u010di\u0107 speaking,\" he answered, his voice steadier than he felt as he prepared to receive either validation or rejection of his military suitability.\n\n\"Mr. Kova\u010di\u0107, this is Sergeant Major Novak. We've completed our evaluation of your application and assessment results. Can you come to the office this afternoon at three o'clock to discuss our findings and recommendations?\" The sergeant major's tone revealed nothing about whether the news would be positive or negative, maintaining the kind of professional neutrality that military personnel used when delivering potentially significant information.\n\n\"Yes, I can be there at three o'clock. Should I bring anything or prepare for any specific type of discussion?\" Viktor asked, glancing at his uncle, who was listening with obvious interest to this pivotal conversation.\n\n\"Just bring identification and be prepared for a frank conversation about your future options regarding military service. We'll discuss the details when you arrive this afternoon.\" Novak ended the call without providing any hints about whether Viktor's evaluation had been successful or whether he would be advised to pursue alternative forms of service to his country.\n\nAfter ending the call, Viktor sat in contemplative silence while his uncle waited patiently for him to share the details of the conversation. The appointment at three o'clock would provide definitive answers about his military eligibility, but Viktor realized that he was no longer certain which outcome he hoped to receive. The conversations with family members, the challenging evaluation process, and his uncle's pointed questions about his motivations had created doubt about whether military service was truly the right path for addressing his dissatisfaction with his current life.\n\n\"Three o'clock this afternoon for the results,\" Viktor announced finally. \"Sergeant Major Novak wants to discuss my evaluation findings and future options regarding military service.\"\n\nTomislav nodded thoughtfully, his expression suggesting that he was considering how to respond to whatever news emerged from that afternoon's meeting. \"Viktor, regardless of what the military evaluation concludes about your technical suitability for service, I want you to remember that there's no shame in deciding that military life isn't the right fit for your particular situation and goals. Choosing not to pursue military service doesn't indicate cowardice or lack of patriotism\u2014it indicates self-awareness and realistic assessment of how you can best contribute to your country's welfare.\"\n\nThe permission to change his mind without loss of honor was something Viktor hadn't realized he needed to hear, but his uncle's words provided relief from the pressure he had created for himself to follow through with military service regardless of whether it proved to be genuinely appropriate for his circumstances. The possibility that wisdom might lie in recognizing the limitations of military service for addressing his personal concerns rather than forcing himself to proceed with an ill-suited solution had not occurred to him during his months of single-minded focus on joining the army.\n\nAfter Tomislav left, Viktor found himself alone with his thoughts and Marko, who emerged from his hiding place with obvious curiosity about the conversation and its implications for their shared future. The puppet had been uncharacteristically subdued during the visit from Viktor's uncle, perhaps recognizing that this particular family discussion required serious consideration without the distraction of his usually irreverent commentary. Now, with the apartment returned to its normal quiet, Marko seemed eager to process the morning's developments and prepare for the afternoon's crucial meeting.\n\n\"Your uncle presented some compelling arguments against military service,\" Marko observed as he positioned himself on the coffee table where he could observe Viktor's facial expressions during their conversation. \"The distinction between service motivated by genuine commitment to others versus service motivated by personal need seems particularly relevant to your situation. How are you feeling about that analysis?\"\n\nViktor considered the puppet's question while preparing lunch, his hands moving automatically through the familiar routine of sandwich preparation while his mind wrestled with increasingly complex questions about his motivations and objectives. \"I think he's right that my reasons for wanting military service are primarily personal rather than genuinely focused on national defense. But I'm not certain that invalidates the decision entirely. Perhaps personal growth and national service can coexist as compatible objectives, even if one is more prominent than the other in my specific case.\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" Marko agreed, \"but your uncle's point about the potential conflict between military and civilian leadership styles seems worth considering seriously. If military service actually diminishes your effectiveness in your current role, then you might be reducing rather than enhancing your contribution to Croatia's welfare. That would be counterproductive regardless of what personal benefits you might derive from the military experience.\"\n\nThe possibility that his quest for personal meaning through military service might actually harm his ability to serve his country through civilian means was a troubling consideration that Viktor had not anticipated when he began this process. His business success provided employment for hundreds of people, contributed to Croatia's economic development, and generated tax revenue that supported government services including military funding. If military service compromised his civilian effectiveness, then his personal growth might come at the expense of his broader social contribution, creating an ethical dilemma about the proper balance between individual fulfillment and social responsibility.\n\n\"I suppose this afternoon's meeting will provide more clarity about whether these concerns are theoretical or practical,\" Viktor said finally. \"If I'm not accepted for military service, then the question becomes moot and I'll need to find alternative approaches to addressing my dissatisfaction with my current life. If I am accepted, then I'll have to decide whether the potential benefits outweigh the risks and complications that family members have identified.\"\n\nThe afternoon drive to the recruitment office felt different from his previous visits, carrying the weight of a decision point that would determine the direction of his immediate future and possibly reshape his understanding of his own identity and capabilities. Viktor found himself simultaneously hoping for acceptance and rejection, wanting validation of his military potential while also recognizing the wisdom in the concerns that had been raised about his motivations and the potential consequences of military service for his existing responsibilities and relationships.\n\nMarko had accompanied him on this journey, hidden in his jacket pocket and providing the kind of moral support that Viktor couldn't request from human companions who would find his relationship with the puppet impossible to understand or accept. The puppet's presence offered continuity and perspective that helped Viktor maintain some emotional equilibrium as he prepared to receive news that might fundamentally alter his life's trajectory or confirm that his current path, however unsatisfying, was his most appropriate option for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe recruitment office appeared unchanged from his previous visits, but Viktor's perception of the environment had evolved as his understanding of military service had become more sophisticated and nuanced. The motivational posters and displays of military equipment now represented not just abstract concepts of service and sacrifice but specific commitments that would require him to surrender much of his current independence and comfort in exchange for purposes and relationships he could only imagine based on limited civilian perspective.\n\nSergeant Major Novak emerged from his office precisely at three o'clock, his expression maintaining the same professional neutrality that had characterized all of Viktor's interactions with military personnel. His bearing suggested the importance of the conversation they were about to have, but provided no hints about whether Viktor's evaluation had been successful or whether he would be advised to pursue alternative paths for addressing his desire to serve his country.\n\n\"Mr. Kova\u010di\u0107, please come in. We have several matters to discuss regarding your evaluation results and potential future with military service,\" Novak said as he gestured toward his office, where Viktor noticed that Dr. Kralj was also present, her notepad and professional demeanor suggesting that the psychological aspects of his evaluation would be significant components of whatever recommendations emerged from this meeting.\n\nAs Viktor settled into the chair across from the two military professionals, he felt Marko shifting slightly in his jacket pocket, a subtle reminder that whatever news he received, he would not face the consequences entirely alone. The support of his unusual companion provided strength for receiving information that might validate his military aspirations or redirect his search for meaning toward less dramatic but potentially more appropriate civilian alternatives.**Chapter 5**\n\nThe recruitment office felt smaller with three people occupying the space, and Viktor found himself acutely aware of every detail\u2014the institutional fluorescent lighting that cast everything in harsh clarity, the smell of strong coffee mixed with the faint odor of cleaning supplies, and the weight of two pairs of professional eyes evaluating his reactions to whatever news they were about to deliver. Sergeant Major Novak arranged several documents on his desk with military precision while Dr. Kralj positioned her notepad at an angle that would allow her to observe Viktor's responses while taking notes. The formality of their preparation suggested that this conversation would be comprehensive and potentially challenging, requiring Viktor to process complex information about his military eligibility and make decisions with far-reaching consequences for his future.\n\n\"Mr. Kova\u010di\u0107, we've completed a thorough review of your physical and psychological evaluations, and we have both positive and concerning findings to discuss with you today,\" Sergeant Major Novak began, his tone suggesting that the news would be neither simple acceptance nor outright rejection but something more nuanced that would require careful consideration. \"Your psychological profile indicates high intelligence, leadership potential, and genuine motivation to serve, all of which are valuable qualities in military personnel. Dr. Kralj was particularly impressed with your honesty about your limitations and your willingness to acknowledge areas where you would need significant improvement to meet military standards.\"\n\nDr. Kralj nodded her agreement with this assessment before adding her own observations about Viktor's psychological evaluation. \"Your responses demonstrated self-awareness and realistic assessment of the challenges you would face in transitioning from civilian to military life. However, we also identified some concerns about your motivations and support systems that need to be addressed before we could recommend you for military service. The psychological evaluation suggested that your desire to join the military is driven primarily by personal dissatisfaction with your current circumstances rather than genuine commitment to military objectives and values. While personal motivations aren't inherently disqualifying, they can create problems if they're not balanced by authentic dedication to service above self.\"\n\nViktor felt a familiar tightness in his chest as the psychologist's words confirmed many of the concerns his family members had raised about his reasons for pursuing military service. The professional validation of his psychological suitability was gratifying, but the identification of motivational concerns struck at the heart of his own doubts about whether he was approaching military service for the right reasons. In his jacket pocket, he could feel Marko shifting slightly, perhaps responding to his increased tension as the conversation moved toward the core issues that would determine his military future.\n\n\"Regarding your physical evaluation,\" Sergeant Major Novak continued, consulting a different set of documents that presumably contained the results of Viktor's fitness testing, \"your current conditioning is below military standards but within the range that could be improved through intensive training. Your cardiovascular fitness, strength, and coordination would all require significant development before you could perform effectively in demanding military environments. However, your performance during the evaluation demonstrated determination and willingness to push through discomfort, which suggests you might be capable of the physical improvement necessary for military service if you're committed to the training requirements.\"\n\nThe mixed nature of these results created a complex situation where Viktor was neither clearly accepted nor definitively rejected but rather presented with conditional possibilities that would require substantial commitment and improvement on his part. The military's willingness to consider his application despite his current limitations suggested that they saw potential in his candidacy, but their concerns about his motivations and the extensive preparation he would need indicated that military service would not be the straightforward path to purpose and meaning that he had initially imagined.\n\n\"What specific steps would be required if I wanted to proceed with military service?\" Viktor asked, recognizing that understanding the practical requirements might help him determine whether his commitment to this path was genuine or merely theoretical. The question felt like a test of his own seriousness about military service, since the answer would reveal whether he was prepared to undertake the demanding process of transforming himself into someone capable of effective military performance.\n\nDr. Kralj consulted her notes before responding to Viktor's question with the kind of detailed explanation that suggested these requirements were standard procedure rather than special accommodations for his particular situation. \"We would recommend a six-month civilian preparation period during which you would work with military trainers to improve your physical conditioning and with military counselors to examine your motivations more thoroughly. This period would allow you to experience something closer to military discipline and demands while maintaining your civilian responsibilities, giving you a more realistic understanding of what military service would actually involve. At the end of six months, we would conduct another comprehensive evaluation to determine whether you had made sufficient progress in both physical and psychological preparation to warrant acceptance into basic training.\"\n\nThe proposed preparation period represented a significant commitment that would require Viktor to maintain his business obligations while simultaneously undergoing intensive physical and psychological training designed to prepare him for military life. The six-month timeline would allow him to test his commitment to military service without completely abandoning his current responsibilities, but it would also mean living in a state of uncertainty and divided focus that might be challenging to sustain over an extended period. Viktor realized that accepting this conditional path would essentially commit him to military service unless he discovered during the preparation period that he was unsuited for or uninterested in military life.\n\n\"This preparation period would involve reporting to military facilities for physical training three days per week, meeting with military counselors twice per week to work on motivational and psychological issues, and completing assignments designed to familiarize you with military culture, history, and expectations,\" Sergeant Major Novak added, providing specific details about what the six-month program would require from Viktor in terms of time, energy, and commitment. \"You would maintain your civilian status during this period, but you would be expected to conduct yourself according to military standards of discipline, punctuality, and respect for authority. Failure to meet these standards or significant absence from required activities would result in termination from the program and disqualification from future military service applications.\"\n\nThe structured nature of the preparation program appealed to Viktor's preference for clear objectives and measurable progress, but the intensive schedule would require significant adjustments to his current lifestyle and business practices. Three days per week of physical training plus twice-weekly counseling sessions would consume substantial time and energy that he currently devoted to business development and personal leisure. The requirement to maintain military standards of conduct during the preparation period would also mean surrendering some of the flexibility and independence that had characterized his civilian life, providing a preview of the more extensive surrendering of autonomy that military service would ultimately require.\n\n\"I appreciate the thoroughness of your evaluation and the opportunity to participate in this preparation program,\" Viktor said carefully, recognizing that his response to this offer would be crucial to how the military personnel assessed his genuine commitment to service. \"May I have some time to consider this proposal and discuss it with my family before making a final decision about proceeding with the preparation program?\"\n\nDr. Kralj and Sergeant Major Novak exchanged glances that suggested they had anticipated this request and discussed how to respond to it during their preparation for this meeting. Their willingness to allow Viktor time for consideration indicated that they viewed his decision as significant enough to warrant careful thought rather than impulsive commitment, but their expressions also suggested that extended delay would be interpreted as lack of genuine interest in military service.\n\n\"You may have one week to consider the preparation program and notify us of your decision,\" Novak replied after a moment of consideration. \"This timeline will allow you to discuss the opportunity with family members and business associates while ensuring that we can begin the preparation program with adequate time for you to complete it successfully before the next basic training cycle begins. If you decide to decline the preparation program, we ask that you notify us promptly so that we can offer the opportunity to other candidates who might benefit from intensive pre-military training.\"\n\nThe one-week deadline created urgency around Viktor's decision while providing sufficient time for him to have meaningful conversations with the people whose opinions he valued most. The knowledge that other candidates might benefit from the preparation program if he declined added weight to his decision by making it clear that his choice would have consequences beyond his individual situation. Viktor realized that declining the program would not only end his military aspirations but would also represent a lost opportunity for someone else who might be more genuinely committed to military service than his own psychologically complex motivations suggested he was.\n\nAs Viktor prepared to leave the recruitment office, Dr. Kralj offered a final observation that seemed designed to help him make his decision with full awareness of the psychological dimensions involved. \"Mr. Kova\u010di\u0107, the preparation program is designed not only to improve your military readiness but also to help you understand your true motivations for seeking military service. Many people discover during this process that their desire to join the military was actually a desire for something else\u2014structure, purpose, challenge, community\u2014that can be found through civilian means. Others discover that military service is indeed their calling and that the preparation period confirms their commitment to serving their country through military means. Both outcomes are valuable if they lead to honest self-understanding and appropriate life choices.\"\n\nThe drive home from the recruitment office gave Viktor time to process the complex news he had received and begin considering how to approach the decision about the preparation program. The conditional acceptance represented both validation of his potential and acknowledgment of his current limitations, creating a situation where his military future would depend entirely on his willingness to commit to substantial personal change and improvement. The six-month preparation period would test not only his physical capabilities and psychological readiness but also his genuine commitment to military service versus his interest in the idea of military service as a solution to his personal dissatisfaction.\n\nMarko remained silent during the drive, apparently recognizing that Viktor needed time to absorb the information and implications of the military's offer without the distraction of commentary or analysis. The puppet's presence provided comfort without demanding attention, allowing Viktor to think through the practical and emotional aspects of the decision he faced while maintaining the sense of companionship that helped him process complex situations. When they finally arrived at the apartment and Viktor settled into his familiar living room environment, Marko emerged from the jacket pocket and positioned himself where they could have their first conversation about the afternoon's developments.\n\n\"Well, that was more complicated than simple acceptance or rejection,\" Marko observed as he arranged himself on the coffee table where he could observe Viktor's facial expressions during their discussion. \"A six-month preparation program that might lead to military service if you prove capable of sufficient improvement in physical conditioning and psychological readiness. How are you feeling about this conditional opportunity?\"\n\nViktor poured himself a glass of wine and settled into his leather chair, recognizing that he needed to work through his thoughts about the military's offer before he could make an informed decision about proceeding with the preparation program. \"I'm simultaneously encouraged and daunted by their assessment. The fact that they see enough potential to warrant a preparation program suggests that my military aspirations aren't completely unrealistic, but the extensive requirements for improvement indicate that I'm much further from military readiness than I had realized when I began this process.\"\n\n\"The psychological concerns they identified seem particularly significant,\" Marko noted thoughtfully. \"Dr. Kralj's observation about your motivations being primarily personal rather than genuinely focused on military service echoes what your mother and uncle said about your reasons for wanting to join the army. That's a pattern of feedback that suggests the concern is legitimate rather than simply one person's opinion about your decision.\"\n\nThe consistency of the psychological assessment with his family members' concerns about his motivations was indeed troubling because it suggested that his self-understanding was less accurate than he had believed. Viktor had convinced himself that his desire to serve his country was genuine and that his personal needs for purpose and challenge were secondary considerations, but the professional evaluation indicated that he had the priority reversed in ways that could create problems for his military effectiveness and satisfaction. The recognition that his own analysis of his motivations might be flawed forced him to question other aspects of his reasoning about military service and its potential benefits for his personal and professional life.\n\n\"Perhaps the preparation program would provide the clarity I need about whether my interest in military service is genuine or whether I'm using it as an elaborate form of escapism from civilian responsibilities,\" Viktor suggested, recognizing that the six-month program might serve diagnostic purposes regardless of whether it ultimately led to military enlistment. \"If I discover during the preparation period that military life doesn't actually address my underlying dissatisfaction with my current circumstances, then I would have learned something valuable about myself without making irreversible commitments to military service.\"\n\n\"That's a reasonable approach,\" Marko agreed, \"but it requires acknowledging that the preparation program might lead you to conclude that military service isn't appropriate for your situation, and being genuinely open to that possibility rather than viewing the program as simply an obstacle to overcome on your way to inevitable enlistment. The value of the preparation period depends on your willingness to let it change your mind if the experience suggests that military service wouldn't actually provide what you're seeking.\"\n\nThis observation highlighted a crucial question about Viktor's flexibility regarding his military plans and his ability to change direction if the preparation program revealed that his motivations or capabilities were insufficient for effective military service. His tendency toward stubbornness and his discomfort with admitting mistakes might make it difficult for him to abandon military aspirations even if the evidence suggested that course correction would be wise. The preparation program would only be genuinely useful if he approached it with authentic openness to whatever conclusions emerged from the experience, rather than using it as a way to justify a decision he had already made for other reasons.\n\nTheir conversation was interrupted by the arrival of Viktor's mother, who had apparently been waiting for news about his military evaluation and decided that calling was insufficient for discussing whatever results he had received. Margarita entered the apartment with the determined energy that characterized her approach to situations she considered significant, and her expression suggested that she was prepared for either celebration or consolation depending on what news Viktor had received from the recruitment office. Marko quickly concealed himself behind a decorative bowl, recognizing that this conversation would require Viktor's complete attention and that the puppet's presence would complicate an already complex family discussion about his military future.\n\n\"Viktor, how did your evaluation go today? Ana said you had an appointment this afternoon to receive the results of your military testing,\" Margarita announced as she settled herself in the living room with the air of someone prepared for a lengthy and important conversation. Her tone suggested both anxiety about what news he might have received and determination to be supportive regardless of whether the military had accepted or rejected his application for service.\n\n\"The results were mixed, Mama. They identified both potential and significant concerns about my readiness for military service,\" Viktor replied, recognizing that his mother deserved a complete explanation of the situation but uncertain about how she would respond to news that his military future remained undecided and dependent on his performance during a six-month preparation program. \"They're offering me the opportunity to participate in intensive training to improve my physical conditioning and examine my motivations more thoroughly before making a final decision about military enlistment.\"\n\nMargarita's expression shifted from anxiety to something that might have been relief mixed with continued concern, as if the news that Viktor's military service was neither definitely accepted nor definitively rejected provided both reassurance that he wouldn't immediately abandon his civilian life and worry that the uncertainty might extend his internal conflict about his future direction. Her response suggested that she had been preparing herself for either complete acceptance or total rejection rather than the conditional opportunity that actually emerged from his evaluation.\n\n\"A preparation program sounds like a reasonable approach,\" she said carefully, apparently weighing her words to avoid either discouraging his military interests or encouraging what she still considered a questionable decision. \"It would allow you to explore military life more thoroughly before making irreversible commitments, and it would give you time to ensure that your business affairs are properly arranged if you ultimately decide to pursue military service. How are you feeling about this opportunity?\"\n\nViktor appreciated his mother's measured response, which acknowledged both the potential value of the preparation program and the ongoing concerns about his military plans without demanding that he abandon his aspirations or commit to them immediately. Her willingness to support his exploration of military service while maintaining her reservations about its appropriateness for his situation demonstrated the kind of parental wisdom that prioritized his autonomous decision-making over her personal preferences about his choices.\n\n\"I'm grateful for the opportunity, but I'm also aware that the preparation program represents a substantial commitment that would require significant changes to my current routine and responsibilities,\" Viktor replied honestly. \"The physical training alone would consume three days per week, plus twice-weekly counseling sessions and additional assignments related to military culture and expectations. It would essentially mean living a double life for six months while I determine whether military service is genuinely appropriate for my situation and goals.\"\n\n\"Living a double life might not be entirely negative if it helps you understand which life is more authentic and satisfying for you,\" Margarita observed with the kind of insight that reminded Viktor why he valued his mother's perspective despite disagreeing with some of her conclusions about his military plans. \"Your current dissatisfaction suggests that your civilian life, however successful it appears from the outside, isn't providing what you need for genuine fulfillment. The preparation program might help you determine whether military structure and purpose would address that dissatisfaction or whether you need to find different approaches to creating meaning within your existing circumstances.\"\n\nThis reframing of the preparation program as a diagnostic tool for understanding his authentic preferences rather than simply a hurdle to overcome on his way to military service was helpful for Viktor's thinking about how to approach the six-month program if he decided to accept the opportunity. Rather than viewing the preparation period as an obstacle that might prevent him from achieving his military goals, he could approach it as a learning experience that would provide valuable information about his genuine compatibility with military life regardless of whether it ultimately led to enlistment. The program's value would lie in the self-understanding it provided rather than simply its potential to qualify him for military service.\n\nTheir conversation was interrupted by Viktor's phone ringing with a call from Ana, who had been managing his business affairs with increasing concern about his extended focus on military planning at the expense of attention to commercial opportunities and obligations. Her timing suggested that she had been monitoring his schedule and knew that he would have received results from his military evaluation, making this call both a check on his emotional state and an opportunity to discuss how his military plans might affect his business responsibilities and decision-making authority.\n\n\"Mr. Kova\u010di\u0107, I hope your appointment went well today. I wanted to discuss several business matters that require your attention, and I also wanted to understand how your military plans might affect your availability for the various commitments and opportunities that are developing in the coming months,\" Ana said with her characteristic directness, cutting through social pleasantries to address the practical implications of Viktor's personal decisions for their shared professional responsibilities.\n\nThe reminder of his business obligations created immediate tension between Viktor's desire to explore military service through the preparation program and his recognition that his civilian responsibilities required consistent attention and leadership that might be compromised by the demanding schedule of military preparation. Three days per week of physical training plus twice-weekly counseling sessions would reduce his availability for business travel, client meetings, and strategic planning sessions that had been crucial components of his commercial success. The question of whether he could maintain his business effectiveness while pursuing military preparation represented a practical challenge that would need resolution before he could commit to the six-month program.\n\n\"We should schedule a comprehensive meeting to discuss contingency planning and delegation of authority that would allow business operations to continue smoothly if my schedule becomes less flexible due to military preparation activities,\" Viktor replied, recognizing that professional responsibility required him to ensure that his personal exploration of military service didn't compromise his obligations to employees, partners, and clients who depended on his leadership and decision-making. The conversation with Ana would need to address both immediate adjustments to accommodate military preparation and longer-term planning for potential extended absence if he ultimately enlisted in military service.\n\nAfter ending the call with Ana, Viktor found himself facing the complex task of integrating his personal desires for military service with his practical responsibilities as a business leader and family member. The preparation program offered the opportunity to explore military life without making irreversible commitments, but it also required substantial time and energy that would need to be redirected from his current activities and relationships. The decision about whether to accept the military's conditional offer would need to account for these broader implications rather than focusing exclusively on his individual interests and aspirations.\n\n\"The business complications add another layer of complexity to your decision about the preparation program,\" Margarita observed, having listened to his conversation with Ana and apparently recognizing the tension between his military interests and his civilian responsibilities. \"It's one thing to explore military service as an individual choice, but quite another to pursue it in ways that might compromise your obligations to the people who depend on your professional leadership and decision-making. How do you plan to balance these competing demands on your time and attention?\"\n\nThe question of balance was indeed central to Viktor's decision about the military preparation program, since the six-month commitment would require him to maintain high performance in his business role while simultaneously dedicating substantial time and energy to military training and counseling. The challenge would be determining whether he could honor both sets of obligations effectively or whether pursuing military preparation would necessarily mean accepting reduced effectiveness in his civilian responsibilities. The ethical implications of potentially compromising his business leadership in order to explore personal alternatives to his current life added moral dimensions to his decision that extended beyond his individual preferences and aspirations.\n\nAs the evening progressed and Viktor continued discussing the military opportunity with his mother, he became increasingly aware of the weight of the decision he faced and the multiple constituencies whose interests would be affected by whatever choice he made about the preparation program. His employees, business partners, family members, and potential military colleagues all had legitimate stakes in his decision, making it clear that his choice about military service was not simply a personal matter but a decision with broader social and professional implications that required careful consideration of competing obligations and commitments.**Chapter 7**\n\nThe weekend following Viktor's meeting at the recruitment office passed in a haze of contemplation and consultation that left him more uncertain about his decision than he had been before receiving the military's conditional offer. Saturday morning brought a long conversation with Ana about restructuring his business responsibilities to accommodate the demands of the preparation program, during which they discovered that his current hands-on leadership style would be difficult to maintain while dedicating twenty hours per week to military training and counseling. The realization that accepting the preparation program would require fundamental changes to his business operations forced Viktor to confront the extent to which his military aspirations might compromise his civilian effectiveness, creating practical obstacles to his military plans that he hadn't fully anticipated when he began pursuing service.\n\nAna's concerns extended beyond simple scheduling conflicts to questions about strategic decision-making and client relationships that required Viktor's personal attention and expertise. Several major contracts were entering crucial negotiation phases that would determine the company's revenue projections for the following year, and international partners had specifically requested Viktor's involvement in discussions about expanding their shipping arrangements into new markets. His absence or divided attention during these critical business developments could result in lost opportunities that would affect not only his personal financial situation but also the employment security of his staff and the economic relationships that supported Croatia's position in regional shipping markets.\n\n\"Mr. Kova\u010di\u0107, I understand your desire to explore military service, but I need you to consider the timing of this decision in relation to our business obligations,\" Ana had said during their Saturday morning meeting, her usual diplomatic tone carrying an edge of urgency that reflected her concern about the practical implications of his military preparation program. \"The Romanian expansion project alone will require intensive negotiation and oversight for the next four months, and the London partnership discussions are entering a phase where your personal credibility and relationships will be crucial to successful outcomes. These are opportunities that took years to develop and cannot be easily postponed or delegated to accommodate personal exploration of alternative career paths.\"\n\nThe weight of these business responsibilities created a moral dilemma for Viktor about whether pursuing personal fulfillment through military exploration justified potentially compromising his professional obligations and the livelihoods of people who depended on his commercial success. His dissatisfaction with his current life was genuine and significant, but it was also a luxury afforded by his financial security and professional achievement that many of his employees could not understand or support if it threatened their own economic stability. The question of whether his search for meaning through military service was ethically defensible when it might harm others who had contributed to his success represented a complex moral calculation that extended far beyond his individual preferences and aspirations.\n\nSunday afternoon brought an unexpected visit from Dr. Petra Kralj, the military psychologist who had conducted Viktor's evaluation, a development that suggested his case had generated more professional interest than typical recruitment situations warranted. Her appearance at his apartment was unprecedented and slightly unsettling, since military personnel rarely made house calls to discuss recruitment matters with potential candidates. Her presence suggested either exceptional concern about his psychological suitability for military service or recognition that his situation required more individualized attention than the standard recruitment process typically provided.\n\n\"Mr. Kova\u010di\u0107, I hope you'll forgive this unscheduled visit, but I wanted to discuss some additional observations about your evaluation that didn't seem appropriate to address in the formal military environment,\" Dr. Kralj explained as she accepted Viktor's offer of coffee and settled into his living room furniture with the professional composure that characterized all of her interactions. \"Your psychological profile raised some interesting questions about the role that social isolation might be playing in your desire for military service, and I thought a more informal conversation might help both of us understand your motivations more clearly.\"\n\nMarko had immediately hidden himself when Dr. Kralj arrived, apparently recognizing that her professional training would make her particularly observant about unusual elements in Viktor's living environment that might provide insights into his psychological state and social relationships. The puppet's absence left Viktor feeling somewhat exposed to the psychologist's analytical gaze, since Marko's presence had become such a consistent source of support and perspective that conversations without him felt incomplete and potentially more revealing than Viktor preferred. The irony that he was hiding his most significant relationship from someone whose job involved understanding his social connections was not lost on him, but explaining his friendship with a puppet would certainly raise questions about his mental stability that would disqualify him from military service immediately.\n\n\"I appreciate your concern about my psychological readiness for military service, Dr. Kralj, but I'm curious about what specific aspects of my evaluation suggested that additional discussion would be beneficial,\" Viktor replied carefully, recognizing that this conversation could significantly influence the military's final assessment of his suitability for the preparation program and eventual service. The psychologist's decision to visit him personally suggested that his case was more complex than routine recruitment situations, which could indicate either special potential or particular concerns that required resolution before the military could make appropriate recommendations about his future.\n\nDr. Kralj opened a leather portfolio that contained what appeared to be Viktor's complete evaluation file, including not only the formal test results and interview notes but also additional research that suggested she had investigated his background more thoroughly than he had realized during their initial meeting. Her preparation for this conversation indicated that the military took his application seriously enough to warrant comprehensive analysis of his psychological profile and social circumstances, but the extent of her research also felt somewhat invasive given that he had not yet committed to accepting their preparation program offer.\n\n\"Your evaluation responses indicated high intelligence and genuine motivation to serve, which are positive indicators for military success, but they also revealed patterns of social isolation and reliance on internal rather than external sources of validation and support that could create challenges in military environments that depend heavily on unit cohesion and peer relationships,\" she began, consulting her notes while speaking in the measured tone that mental health professionals used when discussing sensitive psychological observations. \"Military service requires individuals who can form strong bonds with their fellow service members, follow orders from superiors even when they disagree with those decisions, and subordinate their individual preferences to group objectives in ways that might be particularly difficult for someone who has operated independently for extended periods.\"\n\nThe accuracy of this assessment was uncomfortable because it identified precisely the aspects of military life that Viktor found most appealing and most threatening simultaneously. His desire to experience genuine camaraderie and shared purpose with other people was one of his primary motivations for seeking military service, but his inexperience with subordinating his individual judgment to group decisions and external authority represented a significant challenge that he hadn't fully acknowledged when he began pursuing military service. The psychological evaluation had apparently identified this tension between his needs and capabilities more clearly than he had recognized it himself, raising questions about whether military life would provide the social connections he sought or simply create new forms of frustration and isolation.\n\n\"I recognize that adapting to military culture would require significant adjustments in my approach to relationships and decision-making, but I believe that learning to function effectively within group structures would be valuable personal development regardless of whether I pursue a long-term military career,\" Viktor responded, attempting to frame his inexperience with military-style cooperation as an opportunity for growth rather than a liability that would hinder his effectiveness as a service member. \"The preparation program would presumably provide opportunities to develop these capabilities before I would be required to demonstrate them in more demanding military situations.\"\n\n\"The preparation program would certainly provide exposure to military culture and expectations, but developing genuine comfort with military social dynamics typically requires more time and experience than a six-month program can provide,\" Dr. Kralj replied with the kind of professional honesty that suggested she was more interested in helping him make an informed decision than in recruiting him for military service regardless of his suitability. \"Military relationships are built through shared hardship, mutual dependence, and demonstrated reliability under pressure, all of which require extended experience to develop authentically. The preparation program can introduce you to military expectations, but it cannot replicate the depth of relationships that sustain military personnel through genuinely difficult circumstances.\"\n\nThis limitation of the preparation program had not occurred to Viktor during his consideration of the military's offer, but it represented a significant constraint on his ability to determine whether military service would address his desire for meaningful social connections and shared purpose. If the six-month program could only provide superficial exposure to military culture rather than authentic experience of military relationships, then his decision about whether to pursue military service would still be based largely on theoretical expectations rather than practical understanding of what military life would actually provide for his psychological and social needs. The possibility that he might commit to military service based on incomplete information about its most important benefits created additional uncertainty about whether the preparation program would genuinely help him make an appropriate decision about his future.\n\n\"Perhaps the more fundamental question is whether military service is the most appropriate way for you to address the social isolation and lack of purpose that seem to be driving your interest in military service,\" Dr. Kralj continued, her tone suggesting that she was shifting from assessment of his military suitability to broader consideration of his psychological needs and potential ways of addressing them. \"There are civilian opportunities for meaningful service, structured relationships, and shared purpose that might be more compatible with your background and current circumstances than military service, which requires surrendering much of the independence and control that have characterized your adult life.\"\n\nThe suggestion that civilian alternatives might better address his underlying needs without requiring the dramatic life changes associated with military service was both appealing and frustrating for Viktor, since it implied that his months of focus on military service might have been misdirected effort that overlooked more appropriate solutions to his dissatisfaction with his current circumstances. The possibility that he had fixated on military service as a solution to problems that could be addressed through less dramatic means suggested that his decision-making process had been influenced more by romantic notions about military life than by realistic assessment of his actual needs and the various ways they might be met effectively.\n\n\"What types of civilian opportunities do you think might provide the structure and purpose I'm seeking?\" Viktor asked, recognizing that Dr. Kralj's professional expertise in understanding human motivation and behavior might provide insights into alternative approaches to addressing his psychological needs that he hadn't considered during his single-minded focus on military service. Her perspective as someone who worked with military personnel but maintained civilian status herself might offer unique understanding of both military and civilian approaches to finding meaning and connection through service to others.\n\nDr. Kralj set aside her notes and leaned forward slightly, her professional demeanor softening into something more conversational and collaborative as she shifted from formal assessment to genuine consultation about Viktor's life choices and psychological well-being. \"Given your business background and resources, you could consider establishing or leading charitable organizations that address significant social problems, joining volunteer emergency response teams that provide structured service without military commitment, or developing mentorship programs for young entrepreneurs that would allow you to use your expertise in service of others' development. All of these options would provide opportunities for meaningful contribution to your community while allowing you to maintain the independence and control that have been important elements of your success.\"\n\nThese alternatives had not occurred to Viktor during his months of contemplating military service, but they offered potentially attractive combinations of service, structure, and social connection that might address his underlying needs without requiring him to abandon his current life entirely or compromise his business responsibilities to employees and partners. The possibility that he could find meaning and purpose through civilian service that built upon rather than replaced his existing capabilities and relationships represented a fundamentally different approach to addressing his dissatisfaction that might be more sustainable and effective than the dramatic transformation he had been pursuing through military service.\n\nTheir conversation was interrupted by the sound of Viktor's phone ringing with a call from his Uncle Tomislav, whose timing suggested that he had been monitoring the situation and wanted to check on Viktor's decision-making process before the deadline for responding to the military's preparation program offer. The convergence of professional psychological consultation and family concern about his military plans created a sense of multiple perspectives focusing on his decision that was both supportive and somewhat overwhelming, as if everyone in his life had recognized the significance of his choice about military service and felt compelled to offer their insights and recommendations.\n\n\"Uncle Tomislav, good afternoon. I was just having a conversation with Dr. Kralj from the military recruitment office about my evaluation results and the preparation program opportunity,\" Viktor answered, glancing at the psychologist to gauge her reaction to this family intrusion into their professional discussion. Her expression suggested professional curiosity about how family dynamics might influence his decision-making process, since military psychologists were trained to understand the role that family support or opposition played in service members' success and satisfaction with military life.\n\n\"Viktor, I wanted to follow up on our conversation earlier this week and see how you're processing the military's offer for the preparation program. Your mother mentioned that you received mixed results from your evaluation, which suggests that this decision is more complex than simple acceptance or rejection of military service,\" Tomislav said, his voice carrying the concern of someone who had experience with military life and understood both its benefits and its challenges for individuals with civilian backgrounds and responsibilities. \"I also wanted to offer some additional perspective based on my own experience with the transition between civilian and military life, which might be helpful as you consider whether the preparation program is appropriate for your situation.\"\n\nThe offer of additional family input while Dr. Kralj was present created an opportunity for Viktor to demonstrate his decision-making process and support systems to the military psychologist while also benefiting from his uncle's military experience in evaluating the preparation program opportunity. The convergence of professional and family perspectives might provide a more comprehensive basis for his decision than either source of advice would offer independently, though it also created pressure to make a choice that would satisfy multiple constituencies with potentially different priorities and concerns about his future.\n\n\"I would appreciate your perspective, Uncle, and Dr. Kralj is here discussing some of the psychological aspects of military service that might be relevant to my decision about the preparation program. Perhaps you could share your thoughts about the transition from civilian to military life and whether you think the six-month preparation period would be sufficient to determine genuine suitability for military service,\" Viktor suggested, recognizing that his uncle's firsthand experience with military service might provide insights that would complement the psychologist's professional assessment of his readiness for military life.\n\nThe phone conversation that followed provided Viktor with a unique opportunity to hear military and psychological perspectives on his situation discussed simultaneously, as his uncle and Dr. Kralj began comparing their assessments of his military potential and the challenges he would face in adapting to military culture and expectations. Their professional exchange revealed aspects of military life and preparation that neither had emphasized during their individual conversations with Viktor, providing him with a more comprehensive understanding of what the preparation program would involve and what it could realistically accomplish in terms of preparing him for military service.\n\n\"The preparation program is valuable for giving potential service members exposure to military expectations and culture, but six months is a relatively brief period for developing the kind of psychological adaptation that military life requires,\" Tomislav explained, his voice carrying the authority of someone who had lived through the transition from civilian to military life under the pressures of actual combat rather than peacetime training. \"Military service changes your fundamental approach to decision-making, relationships, and personal priorities in ways that can only be fully understood through extended experience. The preparation program can introduce these concepts, but it cannot replicate the psychological transformation that occurs during basic training and initial military service.\"\n\nDr. Kralj nodded her agreement with this assessment, adding her professional perspective on the psychological aspects of military adaptation that complemented Tomislav's experiential insights. \"Research on military psychology indicates that successful adaptation to military life requires not only acceptance of military culture but genuine internalization of military values and priorities, which typically develops over months or years rather than weeks. The preparation program can assess someone's potential for this adaptation, but it cannot guarantee that the adaptation will occur successfully or that it will be satisfying for individuals with strong civilian identities and extensive independent experience.\"\n\nThe combined perspective of military experience and psychological expertise suggested that Viktor's expectations for the preparation program might be unrealistic if he hoped it would provide definitive answers about his suitability for and satisfaction with military service. The six-month program could offer valuable exposure to military life and help him develop more realistic understanding of its demands and culture, but it could not replicate the complete experience of military service or guarantee that he would find military life fulfilling if he ultimately chose to enlist. This limitation meant that his decision about military service would still require a substantial leap of faith based on incomplete information about how he would respond to the full reality of military life.\n\nAs the conversation with his uncle and Dr. Kralj continued, Viktor found himself increasingly aware of the complexity of his decision and the multiple factors that needed to be weighed in determining whether to accept the military's preparation program offer. The professional assessments of his psychological readiness, his family's concerns about his motivations and timing, his business responsibilities to employees and partners, and his personal needs for meaning and social connection all represented legitimate considerations that pointed toward different conclusions about the appropriate course of action. The challenge was determining how to prioritize these competing factors and make a decision that honored his various obligations while also addressing his genuine dissatisfaction with his current circumstances.\n\nThe complexity of his situation was further complicated by the recognition that whatever decision he made about military service would have long-term consequences that extended beyond the immediate choice about the preparation program. If he accepted the program and ultimately enlisted in military service, he would be committing to years of military life that would fundamentally alter his relationships, responsibilities, and identity in ways that could not be easily reversed. If he declined the program, he would be abandoning his military aspirations and committing to finding meaning and purpose within his current civilian circumstances, which would require him to address the underlying sources of his dissatisfaction through alternative means that he had not yet identified or developed.\n\nAfter ending the phone conversation with his uncle, Viktor found himself alone with Dr. Kralj in his apartment, surrounded by the material symbols of his civilian success while contemplating a decision that could lead him to abandon much of what he had worked to achieve in favor of an uncertain alternative that might or might not provide the fulfillment he was seeking. The juxtaposition of his comfortable living environment with the intensity of his internal conflict about his future created a surreal atmosphere that seemed to highlight the significance of the choice he faced and the difficulty of making it based on incomplete information about its consequences.\n\n\"Dr. Kralj, based on your professional assessment and your conversation with my uncle, what would you recommend regarding the preparation program? Not what you think I want to hear, but what you genuinely believe would be most appropriate given my psychological profile and circumstances,\" Viktor asked, recognizing that he needed honest professional advice that prioritized his well-being over his preferences or the military's recruiting objectives. The psychologist's training and experience evaluating potential service members provided her with unique qualifications for assessing his situation objectively and offering recommendations based on professional expertise rather than personal bias or institutional interests.\n\nDr. Kralj considered his question carefully before responding with the kind of thoughtful analysis that demonstrated her commitment to his best interests rather than simply supporting whatever decision he might prefer to make. \"Based on our conversations and your evaluation results, I believe you have the intellectual capability and basic psychological stability for military service, but I have concerns about whether military life would actually address the underlying issues that are motivating your interest in service. Your social isolation, need for external validation of your worth, and desire to escape from civilian responsibilities suggest that military service might be more about avoiding problems than solving them, which rarely leads to satisfaction or success in military environments.\"\n\nThis assessment was more direct and challenging than Viktor had expected, but it also provided the kind of honest professional feedback that he needed to make an informed decision about his future rather than continuing to base his choices on romantic notions about military life and its potential benefits. The psychologist's identification of his motivations as potentially problematic rather than simply unconventional forced him to confront uncomfortable truths about his decision-making process and the extent to which his military aspirations might be driven by avoidance rather than genuine commitment to service.\n\n\"However, I also recognize that you're genuinely dissatisfied with your current circumstances and that this dissatisfaction has been persistent enough to motivate serious consideration of major life changes,\" Dr. Kralj continued, her tone suggesting that she understood the legitimacy of his concerns about his civilian life even while questioning whether military service was the appropriate solution. \"My recommendation would be to decline the military preparation program and instead commit to addressing your social isolation and lack of purpose through civilian means for a specific period of time\u2014perhaps six months, the same duration as the military program\u2014to determine whether you can create the meaning and connection you're seeking without abandoning your current responsibilities and advantages.\"\n\nThe suggestion that he commit to civilian alternatives for the same period he would have devoted to military preparation was both appealing and challenging, since it would require him to identify and pursue specific activities and relationships that could address his underlying needs without providing the external structure and validation that military service would offer. The civilian approach would place greater responsibility on him to create his own sources of meaning and connection, which might be more difficult than following military directives but could also be more sustainable and personally authentic if he succeeded in developing them effectively.\n\n\"What specific civilian activities would you recommend for addressing social isolation and lack of purpose in ways that might provide lasting satisfaction rather than temporary distraction from underlying problems?\" Viktor asked, recognizing that Dr. Kralj's recommendation would only be useful if it included practical suggestions for how to implement civilian alternatives to military service that could address his genuine psychological needs effectively.\n\nThe psychologist smiled slightly, apparently pleased that he was taking her recommendation seriously enough to ask for specific guidance rather than simply dismissing civilian alternatives as insufficient substitutes for the dramatic transformation that military service would provide. Her response suggested that she had been thinking about his situation comprehensively rather than simply identifying problems with his military aspirations without offering constructive alternatives that might better serve his needs and circumstances.**Chapter 9**\n\n\"Based on your psychological profile and personal circumstances, I would recommend three specific areas of focus that could address your underlying needs while building upon your existing strengths and resources,\" Dr. Kralj began, settling back in her chair with the air of someone preparing to offer comprehensive guidance rather than quick suggestions. \"First, consider establishing a structured volunteer commitment with an organization that serves vulnerable populations in Croatia\u2014perhaps refugee assistance, elderly care, or youth mentorship programs. This would provide the sense of meaningful service and regular social interaction that you're seeking through military service, but in a context that utilizes your business skills and allows you to maintain your civilian responsibilities. The key is making a formal commitment with specific time requirements and measurable objectives, rather than casual volunteer work that you could abandon when business pressures increase.\"\n\nViktor found himself intrigued by this suggestion, recognizing that structured civilian service might indeed provide many of the benefits he associated with military service while avoiding the complications and uncertainties that military life would create for his existing relationships and responsibilities. The idea of applying his business expertise to social problems appealed to his desire to use his capabilities for purposes beyond personal profit, while the structured nature of formal volunteer commitment would address his need for external accountability and clear objectives that his current independent lifestyle lacked. The challenge would be identifying specific organizations and roles that would genuinely engage his interests and capabilities rather than simply providing busy work that masqueraded as meaningful service.\n\n\"The second recommendation involves addressing your social isolation through deliberate cultivation of peer relationships with other successful professionals who share interests beyond business networking and financial advancement,\" Dr. Kralj continued, consulting her notes about Viktor's psychological profile and social patterns. \"Your evaluation indicated that most of your current relationships are transactional rather than genuinely supportive, which contributes to your sense of isolation despite being surrounded by business associates and social acquaintances. Consider joining professional organizations, hobby groups, or recreational activities that would bring you into regular contact with people who could become genuine friends rather than simply useful contacts for business purposes.\"\n\nThis suggestion struck at one of Viktor's deepest vulnerabilities, since his success had indeed created a social environment where most relationships were based on mutual advantage rather than authentic connection and shared interests. His wealth and status attracted people who were interested in what he could provide for them professionally or financially, while simultaneously creating barriers to the kind of honest, reciprocal friendships that required vulnerability and equality between participants. The challenge of developing genuine friendships as a wealthy, successful adult was complicated by his own uncertainty about how to relate to people without the structure of business relationships and clear transactional purposes that had characterized most of his adult social interactions.\n\n\"The third area of focus should be creating structure and challenge within your existing professional life rather than seeking external sources of purpose and validation,\" the psychologist continued, her tone suggesting that this recommendation was particularly important for addressing the underlying causes of his dissatisfaction rather than simply treating its symptoms. \"Your business success has provided you with resources and influence that could be directed toward more meaningful objectives if you chose to restructure your companies' missions and practices. Consider transitioning some of your business operations toward social enterprises that generate profit while addressing significant social or environmental problems, or establish programs that use your shipping expertise to support humanitarian organizations and international development projects.\"\n\nThe concept of transforming his existing business activities to incorporate more meaningful social purposes had not occurred to Viktor during his months of contemplating military service, but it represented a potentially powerful approach to addressing his desire for purpose and contribution while building upon rather than abandoning his professional achievements and capabilities. His shipping business possessed logistical expertise and international relationships that could be valuable for humanitarian organizations, disaster relief efforts, and development projects that required efficient transportation of supplies and materials to underserved populations. The challenge would be determining how to integrate social missions into profitable business operations without compromising either his financial responsibilities to employees and investors or his effectiveness in addressing social problems through commercial means.\n\n\"These recommendations share several important characteristics that distinguish them from military service as approaches to addressing your underlying psychological needs,\" Dr. Kralj explained, apparently recognizing that Viktor would need to understand the theoretical foundation for her suggestions in order to evaluate their potential effectiveness compared to military alternatives. \"They build upon your existing strengths and resources rather than requiring you to develop entirely new capabilities, they allow you to maintain your current relationships and responsibilities while adding new sources of meaning and connection, and they provide opportunities for gradual adjustment and experimentation rather than requiring complete commitment before you can determine their suitability for your personality and circumstances.\"\n\nThe flexibility and reversibility of civilian approaches to addressing his dissatisfaction was indeed appealing compared to the irreversible nature of military commitment, which would require him to abandon his current life entirely based on incomplete understanding of whether military service would actually provide what he was seeking. Civilian alternatives would allow him to test different approaches to finding meaning and social connection while maintaining the security and relationships that had taken years to develop, creating opportunities for personal growth that enhanced rather than replaced his existing life circumstances. The gradual nature of civilian change would also allow him to adjust his approaches based on experience and feedback rather than committing to a single dramatic transformation that might prove unsuitable for his actual needs and preferences.\n\n\"However, I must emphasize that civilian approaches to addressing your psychological needs will require genuine commitment and sustained effort to be effective,\" Dr. Kralj warned, her professional experience apparently having taught her that people often preferred dramatic external changes to the more difficult work of internal transformation and relationship development. \"Military service provides external structure and accountability that can motivate people to persist through difficult periods of adjustment and growth, while civilian approaches require you to create and maintain your own motivation and discipline. The success of civilian alternatives depends entirely on your willingness to treat them with the same seriousness and commitment that you would bring to military service, rather than viewing them as temporary experiments that you can abandon when they become challenging or inconvenient.\"\n\nThis observation highlighted a crucial weakness in Viktor's character that had contributed to his current dissatisfaction and might undermine civilian alternatives to military service if he didn't address it directly. His tendency to lose interest in activities when they became routine or difficult had characterized many of his personal pursuits over the years, from hobbies that he abandoned when the initial excitement faded to relationships that he allowed to deteriorate when they required sustained effort to maintain. Military service would impose external consequences for this pattern of behavior that might force him to develop greater persistence and commitment, while civilian alternatives would require him to develop internal motivation and discipline that he had not consistently demonstrated in his personal life.\n\n\"Dr. Kralj, I appreciate the thoroughness of your recommendations, but I'm concerned about my own ability to maintain commitment to civilian alternatives when they lack the external structure and consequences that military service would provide,\" Viktor admitted, recognizing that honest self-assessment was necessary for making appropriate decisions about his future rather than simply choosing options that sounded appealing in theory but might prove unsustainable in practice. \"My track record with personal commitments that depend solely on internal motivation has been inconsistent, which suggests that I might abandon civilian approaches when they become challenging or when business pressures create competing demands on my time and attention.\"\n\nThe psychologist nodded thoughtfully, apparently pleased that Viktor was engaging seriously with the practical challenges of implementing her recommendations rather than simply accepting them as abstract solutions to his psychological concerns. Her response suggested that she had anticipated this concern and developed strategies for addressing it that could increase the likelihood of success with civilian approaches to personal transformation and meaningful engagement with others.\n\n\"Your concern about maintaining commitment is legitimate and suggests good self-awareness about your patterns of behavior, which is actually encouraging for your potential to develop greater consistency and persistence,\" she replied, consulting her notes about strategies for supporting sustained behavior change in individuals with Viktor's psychological profile. \"The key is creating external accountability and structure within civilian contexts rather than relying solely on internal motivation. This could involve formal agreements with volunteer organizations that include specific commitments and performance expectations, joining groups or programs that involve other people counting on your participation, or working with a professional coach or counselor who can provide regular check-ins and support for maintaining your commitments to personal growth and social engagement.\"\n\nThe suggestion of creating civilian equivalents to military accountability and structure was intriguing because it offered the possibility of addressing Viktor's need for external motivation and consequences without requiring him to abandon his current life entirely or commit to military service before determining whether it would actually provide lasting satisfaction. Professional coaching, formal volunteer commitments, and group memberships could provide the kind of regular expectations and social obligations that would make it more difficult for him to abandon civilian approaches to personal growth when they became challenging or when competing priorities emerged in his business life.\n\n\"Additionally, I would recommend establishing specific, measurable goals for your civilian service and social development activities, with regular evaluation periods where you assess your progress and adjust your approaches based on what you're learning about yourself and what methods are most effective for addressing your underlying needs,\" Dr. Kralj continued, apparently drawing upon research about successful behavior change and personal development programs. \"This would provide the kind of structured progress evaluation that military training includes, but adapted to civilian contexts and personal rather than military objectives. The key is treating your civilian development with the same systematic approach and serious commitment that you bring to your business ventures.\"\n\nThe business-like approach to personal development appealed to Viktor's preference for clear objectives and measurable results, suggesting that civilian alternatives to military service could be structured in ways that utilized his existing skills and preferences rather than requiring him to develop entirely different approaches to goal-setting and achievement. His success in business demonstrated his capability for sustained commitment and systematic progress toward complex objectives, which could potentially be transferred to personal and social development if he approached civilian alternatives with the same strategic thinking and dedicated effort that had characterized his professional achievements.\n\nTheir conversation was interrupted by the sound of the apartment door opening as Marko apparently decided that the lengthy absence from their usual companionship had become unbearable despite the professional nature of Viktor's discussion with Dr. Kralj. The puppet's emergence from his hiding place created an awkward moment of potential exposure that could significantly complicate Viktor's relationship with the military psychologist and his prospects for future military service if she interpreted his attachment to the puppet as evidence of psychological instability or social dysfunction that would disqualify him from military service.\n\n\"I'm sorry, I thought I heard something,\" Viktor said quickly, hoping to divert Dr. Kralj's attention from Marko's presence without having to provide explanations that would inevitably raise questions about his mental state and social relationships. The puppet had positioned himself partially behind a book on the coffee table in a way that made his presence obvious to anyone looking in that direction but might be overlooked by someone focused on conversation and note-taking rather than carefully observing the physical environment.\n\nDr. Kralj glanced toward the coffee table where Marko was attempting to remain inconspicuous, her professional training making her naturally observant of environmental details that might provide insights into her clients' psychological states and living circumstances. Her expression suggested curiosity rather than immediate concern, but Viktor realized that her psychological expertise would make it difficult to dismiss or explain away the puppet's presence without raising additional questions about his relationship with Marko and what it might indicate about his social needs and coping mechanisms.\n\n\"That's an interesting puppet,\" she observed neutrally, her tone carefully professional but clearly inviting explanation about Marko's significance in Viktor's living environment and daily routine. \"Does it have particular meaning or importance for you?\"\n\nThe direct question about Marko's role in his life created the exact situation Viktor had been hoping to avoid throughout his interactions with military personnel, since explaining his relationship with the puppet would inevitably raise questions about his psychological stability and social functioning that could disqualify him from military service regardless of his performance on formal evaluations. However, Dr. Kralj's professional training and observational skills made it unlikely that he could dismiss or minimize Marko's presence without creating suspicion that his evasiveness indicated more significant psychological concerns than honest explanation would reveal.\n\n\"Marko has been with me since childhood,\" Viktor replied carefully, attempting to frame his relationship with the puppet in terms that suggested sentimental attachment rather than active psychological dependence that might indicate social dysfunction or reality testing problems. \"He represents continuity with earlier phases of my life and provides a kind of companionship that I've found comforting during periods of stress and uncertainty. I recognize that maintaining this relationship as an adult might seem unusual, but it hasn't interfered with my professional functioning or social relationships in ways that create practical problems.\"\n\nDr. Kralj's expression remained professionally neutral, but Viktor could see her mental processing of this information and its implications for her assessment of his psychological state and suitability for military service. Her training would provide her with frameworks for evaluating the significance of adult relationships with childhood objects and companions, and Viktor suspected that those frameworks would not necessarily support interpretations that favored his mental stability or readiness for the interpersonal demands of military life.\n\n\"Adult relationships with transitional objects from childhood can serve various psychological functions,\" she said carefully, apparently choosing her words to avoid immediate judgment while gathering additional information about the nature and extent of Viktor's attachment to the puppet. \"Can you help me understand how your relationship with Marko functions in your daily life? For example, do you interact with him regularly, seek his input on decisions, or include him in your social activities in ways that might affect your relationships with other people?\"\n\nThe clinical language Dr. Kralj used to describe his relationship with Marko felt both accurate and somehow diminishing, reducing what Viktor experienced as genuine friendship and companionship to psychological concepts that implied dysfunction or immaturity that required professional attention. However, her questions about the practical impact of his relationship with the puppet on his social functioning and decision-making were legitimate concerns that would indeed be relevant to his suitability for military service, where interpersonal relationships and group functioning would be crucial for success and safety.\n\n\"I do interact with Marko regularly,\" Viktor admitted, recognizing that honesty about his relationship with the puppet was preferable to evasiveness that might suggest more serious psychological problems than the reality of his situation warranted. \"He provides perspective and companionship that I've found valuable, particularly during periods when my business responsibilities create isolation from other social relationships. However, I don't confuse these interactions with human relationships, and I'm capable of functioning effectively in social and professional environments where Marko isn't present. His role in my life supplements rather than replaces human connections, though I acknowledge that his importance to me might indicate needs for social relationship and emotional support that could be better addressed through expanded human connections.\"\n\nDr. Kralj made several notes while Viktor spoke, her professional demeanor revealing neither approval nor disapproval of his explanation but clearly documenting information that would become part of her assessment of his psychological readiness for military service. Her response to his honesty about Marko would likely influence her final recommendations about whether he should pursue the military preparation program or focus on civilian alternatives for addressing his personal and social needs.\n\n\"I appreciate your honesty about your relationship with Marko, and I don't consider adult attachment to childhood objects inherently problematic if it doesn't interfere with necessary functioning in adult relationships and responsibilities,\" she said finally, her tone suggesting that his explanation had been more reassuring than concerning from a clinical perspective. \"However, your acknowledgment that Marko's importance to you reflects unmet needs for social connection and emotional support reinforces my recommendation that you focus on developing human relationships and civilian sources of meaning rather than pursuing military service as a solution to social isolation. Military life would require you to form intense relationships with fellow service members under stressful conditions, and your current reliance on a childhood companion for emotional support suggests that developing those military relationships might be more challenging than you anticipate.\"\n\nThe psychologist's interpretation of his relationship with Marko as evidence supporting civilian rather than military approaches to addressing his social needs was both reasonable and frustrating, since it suggested that his most significant relationship actually demonstrated his unfitness for the kind of relationships that military service would require. The irony that his honesty about Marko had provided additional evidence against his military suitability was not lost on Viktor, though he also recognized that Dr. Kralj's assessment was based on legitimate professional concerns about his readiness for the interpersonal demands of military life rather than simple prejudice against unconventional relationships or coping mechanisms.\n\n\"Given this additional information about your social relationships and coping mechanisms, I would strengthen my recommendation that you decline the military preparation program and commit instead to a structured civilian approach to addressing your underlying needs for social connection, meaningful purpose, and personal challenge,\" Dr. Kralj concluded, closing her portfolio with the air of someone who had completed a comprehensive assessment and reached definitive conclusions about the most appropriate course of action. \"The civilian alternatives I described earlier would allow you to maintain the emotional supports that currently help you manage stress and uncertainty while gradually developing expanded human relationships and sources of meaning that could provide more sustainable satisfaction than either military service or continued reliance on current coping mechanisms.\"\n\nThe finality of her recommendation left Viktor feeling both relieved and disappointed, since it resolved his uncertainty about military service while simultaneously closing off what had seemed like the most promising path for transforming his dissatisfying life circumstances. Dr. Kralj's professional assessment provided clear guidance about his future direction, but it also meant accepting that his months of military planning and preparation had been based on unrealistic assessment of his suitability for military life and that his dramatic aspirations for personal transformation would need to be replaced by more gradual and modest approaches to addressing his underlying concerns about purpose and social connection.\n\nAfter Dr. Kralj departed, Viktor found himself alone with Marko for the first time since receiving the military's conditional offer, creating an opportunity for honest discussion about the psychologist's recommendations and their implications for his decision about the preparation program. The puppet had remained largely silent during the professional consultation, but Viktor could sense his eagerness to process the conversation and offer his own perspective on the civilian alternatives that Dr. Kralj had suggested as more appropriate approaches to addressing Viktor's personal and social needs.\n\n\"Well, that was certainly illuminating,\" Marko observed as he positioned himself where he could observe Viktor's facial expressions during their discussion of the afternoon's developments. \"Dr. Kralj's assessment of your military suitability was quite thorough, and her recommendations for civilian alternatives seem well-considered based on her understanding of your psychological profile and current circumstances. How are you feeling about her conclusion that military service would be inappropriate for your situation and needs?\"\n\nViktor poured himself a glass of wine and settled into his familiar chair, recognizing that he needed time to process the complexity of the afternoon's revelations and their implications for his immediate decision about the military preparation program as well as his longer-term approach to creating a more satisfying and meaningful life within his current circumstances. The conversation with Dr. Kralj had provided clarity about his military prospects while simultaneously presenting him with alternative approaches to personal growth that he had not seriously considered during his months of single-minded focus on military service as the solution to his dissatisfaction.\n\n\"I'm simultaneously disappointed and relieved by her assessment,\" Viktor replied honestly, acknowledging the conflicting emotions that Dr. Kralj's recommendations had generated about his future direction and the approaches he should take to addressing his underlying needs for purpose and social connection. \"Disappointed because military service represented a clear, dramatic path toward transformation that would have provided external structure and validation for changing my life in fundamental ways. Relieved because her civilian alternatives would allow me to address my underlying concerns without abandoning the relationships, responsibilities, and achievements that have positive value despite not providing complete satisfaction.\"\n\n\"The civilian alternatives she suggested do seem well-suited to your actual capabilities and circumstances,\" Marko agreed thoughtfully, apparently having listened carefully to Dr. Kralj's recommendations despite his attempts to remain inconspicuous during the professional consultation. \"Structured volunteer service, deliberate cultivation of genuine friendships, and transformation of your business operations to include meaningful social purposes could indeed address your needs for purpose, social connection, and personal challenge without requiring you to surrender the independence and control that have been important elements of your success and identity.\"\n\nThe puppet's analysis of Dr. Kralj's recommendations was characteristically insightful, identifying the ways in which civilian approaches to personal transformation could provide many of the benefits Viktor associated with military service while avoiding the complications and risks that military life would create for his existing relationships and achievements. The civilian path would require him to take responsibility for creating his own sources of meaning and social connection rather than relying on military structure to provide them, which might be more challenging initially but could also result in more sustainable and personally authentic solutions to his underlying concerns about purpose and fulfillment.\n\n\"However, I'm concerned about my ability to maintain commitment to civilian alternatives when they lack the external accountability and consequences that military service would provide,\" Viktor admitted, repeating the concern he had expressed to Dr. Kralj about his track record with personal commitments that depended primarily on internal motivation rather than external obligations and expectations. \"Military service would have imposed consequences for abandoning commitments or failing to meet standards, while civilian alternatives will require me to develop internal discipline and persistence that I haven't consistently demonstrated in my personal life.\"\n\nMarko nodded sympathetically, apparently recognizing the legitimacy of Viktor's concerns about his own patterns of behavior and their implications for the success of civilian approaches to personal growth and meaningful engagement with others. The puppet's long-term perspective on Viktor's personality and decision-making patterns provided him with unique insights into the challenges that civilian alternatives might present and the strategies that would be most effective for ensuring their success.\n\n\"Your concern about maintaining commitment is valid based on your historical patterns, but I think you may be underestimating your capacity for sustained effort when you're genuinely engaged with activities that utilize your strengths and align with your values,\" Marko observed, apparently drawing upon years of observing Viktor's behavior in various personal and professional contexts. \"Your business success demonstrates your capability for long-term commitment and systematic progress toward complex objectives when you believe the goals are worthwhile and achievable. The key would be structuring civilian alternatives in ways that provide clear objectives, measurable progress, and meaningful consequences for success or failure, rather than treating them as optional activities that you can abandon when they become inconvenient or challenging.\"\n\nThis perspective on Viktor's capacity for sustained commitment when properly motivated was encouraging because it suggested that civilian approaches to personal transformation could indeed be successful if they were structured appropriately and connected to his genuine values and interests rather than simply representing activities that sounded meaningful in theory but didn't engage his authentic enthusiasm and dedication. The challenge would be identifying specific volunteer opportunities, social activities, and business transformations that would genuinely capture his imagination and commitment rather than feeling like obligations imposed by professional recommendations that lacked personal significance or emotional resonance.\n\nThe afternoon had provided Viktor with clarity about his military prospects and alternative approaches to addressing his dissatisfaction with his current life, but it had also created new challenges related to implementing civilian alternatives that would require the same level of commitment and systematic effort that military service would have demanded. The decision about whether to decline the military preparation program in favor of civilian alternatives would need to be made within the next few days, but the more fundamental challenge would be developing and maintaining civilian approaches to personal growth and social connection that could provide lasting satisfaction and meaning rather than simply temporary distraction from underlying concerns about purpose and fulfillment.",

                         "text": "The morning sun cast long shadows across the marble floors of Viktor Kova\u010di\u0107's penthouse overlooking the Sava River. At thirty-four, he possessed everything money could acquire in Zagreb\u2014luxury automobiles, priceless artwork, and investments spanning three continents. Yet as he stood before his floor-to-ceiling windows, watching commuters hurry across the bridges below, an overwhelming emptiness consumed him.\n\nHis reflection stared back from the glass, revealing a man who appeared younger than his years despite the weight of responsibility that had aged his soul. Dark hair fell carelessly across his forehead, and his gray eyes held the particular weariness that came from achieving everything too easily. Viktor had inherited his father's shipping empire at twenty-five, transforming it into something far greater through shrewd decisions and calculated risks. Now, nine years later, success felt like a gilded cage.\n\n\"Another beautiful morning wasted on melancholy,\" came a cheerful voice from behind him.\n\nViktor turned to see his most trusted companion perched on the leather armchair\u2014a small finger puppet with wild orange yarn hair and button eyes that somehow conveyed more personality than most people he knew. Marko, as the puppet was called, had been with Viktor since childhood, a gift from his grandmother before she passed. What had begun as a child's toy had evolved into something far more complex over the years.\n\n\"You wouldn't understand, Marko. You don't have obligations weighing you down,\" Viktor replied, walking to his mahogany desk where morning reports awaited his attention.\n\nThe puppet tilted its diminutive head with exaggerated concern. \"Obligations? You mean counting money and attending charity galas where you pretend to care about causes you've never experienced personally?\"\n\nViktor's hand moved unconsciously, bringing Marko closer to eye level. Their conversations had become increasingly sophisticated over time, though Viktor couldn't quite explain how or when this evolution had occurred. Perhaps loneliness had a way of breathing life into imagination, or maybe there was something more mysterious at work.\n\n\"I've been thinking about joining the military,\" Viktor announced suddenly, the words surprising even himself as they left his lips.\n\nMarko's button eyes seemed to widen with genuine shock. \"The military? Viktor, my dear friend, have you completely lost your mind? You haven't done a day of physical labor in your entire privileged existence. You order groceries through an app because you find supermarkets 'overwhelming.'\"\n\n\"That's precisely why I need this,\" Viktor insisted, settling into his chair. \"I need to understand what real struggle means, what it's like to fight for something beyond profit margins and market shares. My father served in the Homeland War\u2014maybe this is my chance to honor that legacy.\"\n\nThe puppet appeared to contemplate this revelation with surprising seriousness. \"Your father fought because his country was being torn apart. You want to fight because you're bored. There's a significant difference between necessity and indulgence, Viktor.\"\n\nBefore Viktor could respond, his phone buzzed with an incoming call from his personal assistant, Ana Jurkovi\u0107. She had managed his affairs for six years with ruthless efficiency, anticipating his needs before he recognized them himself.\n\n\"Good morning, Ana,\" he answered.\n\n\"Mr. Kova\u010di\u0107, I have your mother on line two. She sounds... distressed. Also, the quarterly board meeting has been moved to this afternoon, and the Croatian Times wants to interview you about your recent charitable donations.\"\n\nViktor glanced at Marko, who was now pretending to file his tiny fingernails with complete disinterest. \"Transfer my mother, cancel the interview, and push the board meeting to tomorrow.\"\n\n\"Sir, the board meeting cannot be\u2014\"\n\n\"Ana, I'm about to make some significant life changes. Please just handle it.\"\n\nHe switched lines before she could protest further. His mother's voice filled the room with its familiar mixture of affection and exasperation.\n\n\"Viktor, darling, Ana mentioned something absolutely ridiculous about you wanting to join the army. Please tell me this is some sort of elaborate joke.\"\n\nMargarita Kova\u010di\u0107 had never been one to mince words. At sixty-two, she remained formidable\u2014a woman who had built her own successful interior design firm while raising Viktor essentially alone after his father's death. Her disapproval could cut through steel when properly applied.\n\n\"It's not a joke, Mama. I've given this considerable thought.\"\n\n\"Considerable thought? Viktor, you change your mind about dinner reservations three times a week. Now you want to make decisions involving firearms and combat training?\"\n\nMarko leaned closer to Viktor's ear, whispering loudly enough for his voice to carry: \"She has an excellent point. Remember last month when you couldn't decide between Italian and French cuisine and ended up ordering sushi?\"\n\n\"Who is that?\" his mother demanded sharply. \"Viktor, do you have someone there with you?\"\n\nViktor felt heat rise in his cheeks. \"It's... nobody, Mama. Just the television.\"\n\n\"The television doesn't make sarcastic comments about your decision-making abilities. Viktor, are you taking proper care of yourself? Perhaps you should speak with Dr. Petrov again.\"\n\nDr. Petrov was the family psychiatrist who had helped Viktor through his father's death and various other challenges over the years. The suggestion that he might need professional help stung more than Viktor cared to admit.\n\n\"I'm perfectly fine, and my decision is final. I'm meeting with a military recruiter this afternoon.\"\n\nThe silence on the other end of the line stretched uncomfortably long. When his mother finally spoke, her voice carried a tone Viktor hadn't heard since his teenage years\u2014disappointment mixed with genuine worry.\n\n\"Your father died serving his country, Viktor. He didn't choose that war; it chose him. You're choosing something you don't understand for reasons you can't properly explain. That's not honor\u2014it's selfishness dressed up as nobility.\"\n\nThe call ended abruptly, leaving Viktor staring at his phone with a mixture of guilt and determination. Marko crawled up his arm to perch on his shoulder, offering what passed for comfort from a fabric friend.\n\n\"Well, that went better than expected,\" the puppet observed dryly. \"Only one family member has declared you mentally unstable so far today. Shall we call your Uncle Tomislav for a second opinion?\"\n\nViktor stood abruptly, causing Marko to grip his shirt to avoid falling. \"Enough. I'm a grown man capable of making my own decisions. If no one else understands, then so be it.\"\n\nHe strode across the apartment to his walk-in closet, searching for something appropriate to wear to a military recruitment office. His wardrobe consisted primarily of tailored suits, casual wear that cost more than most people's monthly salaries, and formal attire for various social obligations. Nothing seemed suitable for declaring his intention to abandon luxury for service.\n\n\"Perhaps the Armani suit?\" Marko suggested helpfully. \"Nothing says 'I'm ready for military discipline' like Italian craftsmanship and silk lining.\"\n\n\"You're not helping,\" Viktor muttered, selecting his most conservative outfit\u2014dark pants and a simple white shirt that had somehow cost three hundred euros.\n\n\"I'm never helping, according to you. Yet here I am, the only one willing to accompany you on this journey of self-discovery. Your fair-weather human friends will disappear the moment you trade your platinum credit cards for military rations.\"\n\nThis observation struck Viktor with uncomfortable accuracy. His social circle consisted primarily of business associates, fellow wealthy individuals, and acquaintances drawn to his status rather than his personality. None of them would understand his desire to seek meaning through service, just as none of them had ever shown genuine concern for his emotional well-being.\n\nThe military recruitment office occupied a modest building in downtown Zagreb, far from the gleaming towers of Viktor's usual haunts. As he approached the entrance, several passersby stared at his expensive clothes and confident bearing with obvious curiosity. He felt simultaneously overdressed and underprepared.\n\n\"Last chance to reconsider,\" Marko whispered from Viktor's jacket pocket, where he had hidden for the journey. \"We could go to that new restaurant on Ilica Street instead. I hear they have excellent fish.\"\n\n\"You don't eat,\" Viktor reminded him quietly.\n\n\"I don't serve in armies either, yet here we are.\"\n\nThe recruitment office's interior was spartan but clean, with motivational posters featuring determined-looking soldiers and Croatian flags. Behind a metal desk sat Sergeant Major Ivica Novak, a man whose weathered face and rigid posture spoke of decades spent in military service. His eyes assessed Viktor with the kind of thorough evaluation reserved for potential threats or elaborate pranks.\n\n\"I'm here to inquire about enlistment,\" Viktor announced, attempting to project confidence despite feeling completely out of place.\n\nSergeant Major Novak's expression didn't change, but something skeptical flickered in his gaze. \"Name and age?\"\n\n\"Viktor Kova\u010di\u0107. I'm thirty-four years old.\"\n\n\"Occupation?\"\n\n\"I... I run several businesses. Shipping, primarily, with investments in real estate and technology.\"\n\nNow the sergeant major's eyebrows rose slightly. \"You run businesses, and you want to join the military? Mr. Kova\u010di\u0107, this isn't a weekend camping trip. This is serious commitment requiring sacrifice, discipline, and dedication to something greater than personal profit.\"\n\nFrom his pocket, Viktor heard Marko make a small snorting sound that he hoped wasn't audible to anyone else.\n\n\"I understand the seriousness of military service, Sergeant Major. That's exactly why I'm here. I want to contribute something meaningful to my country instead of simply accumulating wealth.\"\n\n\"Contributing something meaningful,\" Novak repeated slowly, as if testing the words for sincerity. \"Tell me, Mr. Kova\u010di\u0107, what military experience do you have? Any sports background? Physical training?\"\n\nViktor felt his confidence begin to waver. \"I... I work out regularly. I have a personal trainer. And I've done some hiking.\"\n\n\"Hiking.\" The sergeant major made a note on a form. \"What about handling stress? Working under pressure? Following orders from superiors who might be younger or less educated than yourself?\"\n\nThese questions struck at the heart of Viktor's uncertainty. He had always been the one giving orders, making final decisions, controlling every aspect of his environment. The idea of surrendering that autonomy both terrified and thrilled him.\n\n\"I believe I can adapt to military structure,\" he replied carefully.\n\nSergeant Major Novak studied him for a long moment before sliding several forms across the desk. \"Fill these out completely. Medical history, education, criminal background, emergency contacts. If you're serious about this, we'll schedule a full physical and psychological evaluation.\"\n\nAs Viktor began completing the paperwork, he became acutely aware of Marko shifting restlessly in his pocket. The puppet had remained unusually quiet during the interview, but Viktor could sense his growing agitation.\n\nThe forms were more invasive than Viktor had anticipated, requiring detailed information about his family, finances, relationships, and personal history. When he reached the section about emergency contacts, he hesitated. His mother was the obvious choice, but their conversation that morning suggested she would not be supportive if something happened to him during training or deployment.\n\n\"Having trouble with the forms?\" Sergeant Major Novak asked, not looking up from his own paperwork.\n\n\"Just... considering my options,\" Viktor replied.\n\nHe listed his mother's information and Ana's as well, then paused at a question about dependents or family members who might be affected by his military service. Technically, he had no dependents, but somehow leaving that section completely blank felt like denying Marko's existence entirely.\n\n\"This is ridiculous,\" he muttered under his breath.\n\n\"What was that?\" the sergeant major inquired.\n\n\"Nothing. Just talking to myself.\"\n\n\"That's a habit you'll need to break. Military service requires clear communication and mental discipline. Talking to yourself suggests scattered thinking.\"\n\nViktor completed the forms as thoroughly as possible, omitting only his relationship with Marko, which he couldn't have explained even if he'd wanted to. When he returned the paperwork, Sergeant Major Novak reviewed it quickly, his expression revealing nothing.\n\n\"We'll contact you within a week to schedule your evaluations. In the meantime, I suggest you begin preparing physically and mentally for what military service actually entails. Read about military history, start running longer distances, and think seriously about whether you're prepared to give up your comfortable lifestyle for something that will challenge everything you think you know about yourself.\"\n\nOutside the recruitment office, Viktor felt a mixture of excitement and dread. He had taken the first step toward changing his life completely, but the magnitude of that change was only beginning to register.\n\n\"Well, that was enlightening,\" Marko commented once they were safely in Viktor's car. \"Nothing like being interrogated about your fitness for military service to put your life choices in perspective.\"\n\n\"He was just doing his job,\" Viktor replied, starting the engine.\n\n\"His job is to weed out wealthy dilettantes who confuse boredom with patriotism. You made quite an impression with your hiking experience and personal trainer.\"\n\nViktor drove through Zagreb's afternoon traffic in thoughtful silence. The city looked different somehow, as if his decision to join the military had shifted his perspective on everything familiar. The cafes where he regularly met business associates, the shops where he bought expensive clothes without consideration of price, the restaurants where he dined alone while conducting business calls\u2014all of it seemed suddenly frivolous.\n\nHis phone rang as he navigated through a construction zone near the city center. Ana's name appeared on the display, and he answered reluctantly.\n\n\"Mr. Kova\u010di\u0107, I've managed to postpone the board meeting, but several members are asking questions about your availability. Also, your mother called three times, and there are reporters outside your building asking about rumors that you're joining the military. How would you like me to handle the media attention?\"\n\nViktor hadn't considered that his decision might become public knowledge so quickly. In a city like Zagreb, news traveled fast, especially when it involved prominent business figures making unexpected choices.\n\n\"No comments to the press. If the board members have concerns, schedule individual meetings later this week. And please ask building security to ensure my privacy is maintained.\"\n\n\"Of course. Will you be in the office tomorrow?\"\n\nViktor realized he hadn't thought about his business obligations in relation to his military plans. If he was accepted for service, someone would need to manage his affairs, possibly for months or years.\n\n\"We need to discuss contingency plans, Ana. If I'm deployed, you'll need expanded authority to handle day-to-day operations.\"\n\nThe silence on the phone suggested Ana was processing this information with her characteristic thoroughness.\n\n\"Sir, are you certain about this decision? Your businesses require hands-on leadership, and your investors rely on your personal involvement in strategic decisions.\"\n\n\"I'm certain,\" Viktor said, though he wondered if that was entirely true.\n\nThat evening, Viktor sat in his living room with a glass of wine, researching military service online while Marko provided commentary from his perch on the coffee table. The puppet had been unusually animated since their visit to the recruitment office, as if Viktor's decision to pursue military service had energized him in unexpected ways."

                         "text": "**Chapter 2**\n\nThe week that followed Viktor's visit to the recruitment office passed with agonizing slowness. Each morning brought the same routine\u2014coffee on the terrace, reviewing business reports, and waiting for the phone call that would determine his future. Marko had grown increasingly philosophical during this period, offering observations about the nature of waiting and the peculiar anxiety that accompanied voluntary uncertainty.\n\n\"You know what's fascinating about this situation?\" the puppet mused from his usual spot on Viktor's shoulder as they watched the sunrise over Zagreb. \"For the first time in your adult life, you've initiated something where you're not guaranteed the outcome you want. It's quite refreshing to see you experience actual suspense.\"\n\nViktor adjusted his position in the outdoor chair, feeling the morning chill through his silk pajamas. The city below was awakening with its familiar sounds\u2014traffic beginning to build, construction crews starting their work, the distant hum of life carrying on regardless of his personal transformation. \"I've taken plenty of business risks over the years. This isn't entirely different.\"\n\n\"Oh, but it is,\" Marko insisted, his button eyes catching the early light. \"Business risks are calculated. You analyze market conditions, study your competitors, project potential outcomes. This military adventure of yours is pure leap of faith. You have no idea what you're jumping into, and that terrifies you in the most delicious way.\"\n\nThe truth in Marko's observation was unsettling. Viktor had built his success on careful planning and thorough preparation. He studied every deal from multiple angles, consulted experts, and rarely made decisions without comprehensive understanding of the consequences. Now he was contemplating a complete life change based primarily on emotional impulse and vague notions about finding meaning through service.\n\nHis phone buzzed with a text message from Ana, reminding him about a conference call with investors in London. The normalcy of business obligations felt increasingly surreal as he prepared to potentially abandon everything he had worked to build. How did one explain to shareholders that their CEO was considering trading boardrooms for barracks, profit margins for military discipline?\n\nThe conference call proceeded with its usual efficiency, discussions of quarterly projections and market expansion opportunities. Viktor participated automatically, his mind wandering to questions about basic training, deployment possibilities, and whether his decision to pursue military service represented courage or elaborate self-destruction. His colleagues in London noticed nothing unusual in his demeanor, which suggested either his acting skills were improving or his business persona had always been somewhat disconnected from his authentic self.\n\n\"Excellent work on the Romanian shipping contract, Viktor,\" came the voice of James Morrison, his primary contact in London. \"The profit margins exceeded our projections by twelve percent. Your negotiation skills continue to impress our board of directors.\"\n\n\"Thank you, James. The Romanian market has significant potential for expansion if we maintain our current approach.\" The words felt hollow as Viktor spoke them, like reciting lines from a play he no longer wanted to perform. Somewhere in the background, he could hear Marko making soft gagging sounds that threatened to disrupt his professional composure.\n\nAfter ending the call, Viktor found himself staring at his reflection in the darkened computer screen. The man looking back appeared successful, confident, and completely in control of his circumstances. Yet beneath that polished exterior lurked growing uncertainty about everything he had previously considered important. Money, status, professional achievement\u2014all of it seemed increasingly meaningless when measured against the possibility of genuine purpose.\n\n\"Identity crisis looks good on you,\" Marko observed from his position on the desk. \"Very existential, very sophisticated. You should consider writing poetry about your inner turmoil. Something dark and introspective about the burden of wealth.\"\n\n\"I'm not having an identity crisis,\" Viktor protested, though the denial felt unconvincing even to himself. \"I'm simply exploring new opportunities for personal growth and contribution to society.\"\n\n\"Personal growth and contribution to society,\" the puppet repeated in a mocking tone. \"You sound like a motivational seminar or a political campaign advertisement. Why can't you just admit that you're desperately unhappy with your current life and hoping that playing soldier will somehow fix whatever's broken inside you?\"\n\nThe bluntness of Marko's assessment stung because it contained uncomfortable truth. Viktor's dissatisfaction had been building for years, masked by material success and social obligations but never truly addressed. He had assumed that achieving his father's dreams and exceeding his business goals would provide lasting fulfillment, but instead he felt trapped in a gilded cage of his own construction.\n\nHis contemplation was interrupted by the arrival of his mother, who let herself into the apartment using the spare key Viktor had given her years earlier. Margarita Kova\u010di\u0107 entered like a force of nature, her heels clicking authoritatively across the marble floors as she surveyed her son's domain with maternal concern mixed with barely contained exasperation.\n\n\"Viktor, we need to discuss this military nonsense before you do something permanently stupid,\" she announced without preamble, settling into the leather chair across from his desk. Her designer handbag landed on the coffee table with decisive finality, suggesting this would not be a brief conversation.\n\nMarko immediately scrambled down Viktor's arm and positioned himself behind a stack of business journals, apparently recognizing the need for discretion during family confrontations. Viktor had never fully explained his relationship with the puppet to his mother, though she had occasionally made comments about his \"unusual attachment to childhood memories\" that suggested some awareness of the situation.\n\n\"Good afternoon, Mama. You look lovely today,\" Viktor offered, hoping to deflect the conversation with pleasantries.\n\n\"Don't charm me, Viktor. I raised you, which means I'm immune to your manipulation tactics. I've spent the week researching military service, and everything I've learned confirms that this decision is completely inappropriate for someone in your position.\" She opened her handbag and extracted several printed articles, spreading them across his desk like evidence in a legal proceeding.\n\nViktor glanced at the materials\u2014statistics about military casualties, articles about the psychological challenges of combat deployment, reports on the difficulties veterans faced when transitioning back to civilian life. His mother had approached his potential military service with the same thorough preparation she brought to her interior design projects, gathering comprehensive information before forming her conclusions.\n\n\"I appreciate your research, but these articles focus on combat situations. I'm not necessarily seeking deployment to active conflict zones,\" Viktor explained, though he realized he hadn't actually specified his preferences to the recruiter.\n\n\"Military service isn't a hobby, Viktor. You don't join the army for personal enrichment like you're taking up painting or learning a new language. Soldiers serve where they're needed, when they're needed, doing whatever tasks their country requires. Your individual preferences are irrelevant once you take the oath.\"\n\nMargarita's tone carried the authority of someone who had lived through actual military conflict, who had lost her husband to war and understood its true costs in ways Viktor could only imagine. Her opposition to his plans wasn't merely maternal overprotectiveness but informed concern based on genuine experience with military life and its consequences.\n\n\"Your father didn't choose to serve, Viktor. War came to our country, and he responded out of necessity, not adventure-seeking. He left behind a wife, a young son, and a business he had worked years to build. Do you think he wanted to abandon everything he loved to fight in trenches and dodge sniper fire? Do you imagine he found military service personally fulfilling?\"\n\nThe comparison to his father's situation was particularly painful because Viktor had always struggled to live up to his memory. Dragan Kova\u010di\u0107 had been respected as both a businessman and a patriot, someone who served his country when called upon but never confused duty with self-indulgence. Viktor's desire to join the military voluntarily might appear honorable on the surface, but his mother's questions forced him to examine his motivations more critically.\n\n\"I'm not trying to recreate Papa's experience,\" he said carefully. \"I'm attempting to find my own path toward meaningful contribution.\"\n\n\"Meaningful contribution,\" his mother repeated, echoing Marko's earlier mockery of his language. \"Viktor, you employ over two hundred people directly and thousands more through your various business interests. You provide shipping services that support international trade and economic development. You donate substantial amounts to charitable causes throughout Croatia. How is that not meaningful contribution?\"\n\nFrom behind the business journals, Viktor could hear Marko making soft applause sounds, apparently appreciating his mother's logical arguments. The puppet had always been fond of Margarita, perhaps because they shared a certain directness in addressing Viktor's self-deceptions and questionable decisions.\n\n\"Those contributions feel abstract,\" Viktor admitted. \"I write checks and attend board meetings, but I don't see the direct impact of my work on people's lives. Military service would provide tangible purpose, clear objectives, and immediate results.\"\n\n\"Military service would provide an escape from adult responsibilities,\" his mother countered sharply. \"You want someone else to make your decisions, tell you what to do, and provide external structure because you've grown bored with the freedom that success has given you. That's not noble purpose\u2014it's elaborate avoidance of the real work of building a meaningful life within your current circumstances.\"\n\nThe accuracy of this assessment was devastating because it suggested that his military aspirations were motivated by weakness rather than strength, by desire to escape rather than desire to serve. Viktor had convinced himself that joining the army represented courage and sacrifice, but his mother's analysis revealed it might actually be the opposite\u2014a privileged man's attempt to avoid the genuine challenges of using his advantages constructively.\n\n\"Perhaps,\" Viktor said quietly, \"but I need to explore this possibility before I can know for certain what my true motivations are.\"\n\nMargarita studied her son's face with the penetrating gaze that had always been able to discern his emotional state regardless of his attempts at concealment. After several moments of silence, her expression softened slightly, though her concern remained evident.\n\n\"Viktor, I understand that you're searching for something more than material success. Your father went through similar questioning when you were young, before the war gave him other priorities. But running away from your current life won't provide the answers you're seeking. Meaningful purpose isn't found by changing your circumstances\u2014it's created by changing your approach to existing circumstances.\"\n\nBefore Viktor could respond, his phone rang with the call he had been anticipating all week. The recruitment office number appeared on the display, and both Viktor and his mother stared at the device as if it were a ticking bomb. This conversation would determine whether his military aspirations could proceed or whether they would remain theoretical exploration of alternative life paths.\n\n\"I need to take this,\" Viktor said, reaching for the phone.\n\nHis mother nodded grimly, settling back in her chair to listen to whatever news would emerge from this pivotal conversation. Behind the business journals, Marko poked his small head up to observe the proceedings, his button eyes reflecting the tension that filled the room.\n\n\"Viktor Kova\u010di\u0107 speaking,\" he answered, attempting to sound confident despite his racing heartbeat.\n\n\"Mr. Kova\u010di\u0107, this is Sergeant Major Novak from the recruitment office. We've reviewed your application materials and scheduled your physical and psychological evaluations. Can you come in tomorrow morning at eight o'clock?\"\n\nThe matter-of-fact tone suggested this was routine procedure rather than indication of whether Viktor's application would ultimately be accepted. He glanced at his mother, who was watching him with barely concealed anxiety, then at Marko, who appeared to be holding his breath despite not actually needing to breathe.\n\n\"Yes, I can be there at eight tomorrow morning. What should I bring or do to prepare?\"\n\n\"Wear comfortable athletic clothing and bring identification. The evaluations will take most of the day. We'll determine your suitability for military service based on the results and contact you by the end of the week with our decision.\"\n\nAfter ending the call, Viktor sat in silence while his mother and Marko waited for him to share the details of the conversation. The reality of actually proceeding with military evaluations made his decision feel suddenly concrete in ways that filled him with equal parts excitement and terror.\n\n\"Tomorrow morning,\" he announced finally. \"Physical and psychological evaluations to determine if I'm suitable for military service.\"\n\nMargarita closed her eyes briefly, as if processing this information required significant emotional preparation. When she opened them again, her expression had shifted from opposition to resigned concern, the look of someone who recognized that further argument would be futile.\n\n\"If you're determined to proceed with this evaluation, then I suppose I should wish you success,\" she said carefully. \"But Viktor, please remember that proving you're capable of military service doesn't mean you should pursue military service. Capability and wisdom are not always the same thing.\""

                         "text": "**Chapter 3**\n\nThe alarm clock's harsh buzzing at six o'clock the next morning found Viktor already awake, having spent most of the night alternating between nervous anticipation and profound second-guessing of his decision. He had laid out his athletic clothes the evening before\u2014simple black shorts, a gray t-shirt, and running shoes that had seen more treadmill time than actual outdoor exercise. Now, staring at the modest outfit, he felt a strange disconnect from his usual morning routine of selecting expensive suits and coordinating accessories for business meetings.\n\nMarko sat propped against the bedside lamp, having maintained a vigil throughout Viktor's restless night. The puppet's button eyes reflected the early morning light streaming through the windows, and his usually animated demeanor had given way to something resembling solemnity. Their conversations during the dark hours had ranged from practical concerns about the day's evaluations to deeper philosophical questions about the nature of identity and the courage required for genuine transformation.\n\n\"You know, I've been thinking about what your mother said yesterday,\" Marko offered as Viktor pulled on his athletic shirt. \"About meaningful purpose being created through changing your approach to existing circumstances rather than changing the circumstances themselves. There's considerable wisdom in that perspective, even if it's not what you want to hear right now.\"\n\nViktor paused in his preparation, considering the puppet's observation. \"Perhaps, but how does one change their approach when the current approach has led to such profound dissatisfaction? Sometimes radical change in circumstances is necessary to discover who you truly are beneath the expectations and assumptions others have built around you.\"\n\n\"Or sometimes radical change is simply another form of avoidance, dressed up in noble language to make it seem like growth rather than escape.\" Marko's tone carried a gentleness that made his challenging words easier to accept. \"I'm not saying your desire for military service is wrong, Viktor. I'm suggesting that understanding your true motivations might be more important than the specific path you choose to follow.\"\n\nThe drive to the recruitment office took Viktor through parts of Zagreb he rarely visited, working-class neighborhoods where people were beginning their daily routines with the kind of purposeful energy that came from necessity rather than choice. He observed construction workers gathering at job sites, parents walking children to school, shop owners preparing their businesses for another day of serving their communities. All of these people seemed to possess something Viktor felt he lacked\u2014a clear understanding of their role in the world and their contribution to something larger than themselves.\n\nAt a traffic light, he noticed an older man in military fatigues waiting at a bus stop, probably heading to work at one of the military installations outside the city. The man's bearing spoke of decades of service, of discipline earned through experience rather than imposed from outside. Viktor wondered if he would ever develop that kind of authentic authority, or if his privileged background would always mark him as someone playing at being a soldier rather than truly becoming one.\n\n\"Second thoughts?\" Marko inquired from the passenger seat, where he had positioned himself to observe the journey.\n\n\"Continuous thoughts,\" Viktor replied honestly. \"Not second thoughts, but layered thoughts. I'm simultaneously convinced this is the right decision and terrified it's completely wrong. I suppose that suggests it's genuinely important to me, since trivial decisions don't generate this level of internal conflict.\"\n\nThe recruitment office appeared different in the early morning light, more official and intimidating than it had seemed during his initial visit. Several other potential recruits were already waiting outside, most of them significantly younger than Viktor and displaying the kind of easy confidence that came from physical fitness and familiarity with challenge. He felt suddenly conscious of his age, his soft hands, and his complete inexperience with the kind of life he was attempting to enter.\n\nSergeant Major Novak emerged from the building precisely at eight o'clock, his uniform impeccable and his manner suggesting no tolerance for delay or uncertainty. He surveyed the assembled group with the practiced assessment of someone who had seen thousands of potential soldiers and developed reliable instincts about who would succeed and who would fail.\n\n\"Gentlemen, you're here because you've expressed interest in serving your country through military service. Today we'll determine whether that interest is backed by the physical capability, mental stability, and genuine commitment required for success in demanding circumstances. Some of you will proceed to the next phase of the recruitment process. Others will discover that military service is not appropriate for their current situation. Both outcomes are valuable if they lead to honest self-understanding.\"\n\nViktor found himself standing between a twenty-two-year-old university student who had been discussing his athletic achievements with obvious pride and a thirty-year-old mechanic who possessed the kind of practical confidence that came from working with his hands and solving real problems. Both men seemed to belong in this environment in ways that made Viktor's presence feel like an elaborate costume party where he hadn't quite mastered the appropriate character.\n\nThe physical evaluation began with basic measurements and medical history review, followed by tests of cardiovascular fitness, strength, and coordination. Viktor had maintained reasonable physical condition through regular gym workouts and occasional tennis games, but the military standards revealed how different recreational fitness was from functional capability. The running portion of the test left him winded in ways that suggested months of serious training would be required before he could match the performance of candidates with manual labor backgrounds.\n\nDuring the strength assessment, Viktor struggled with exercises that the younger candidates completed with ease. His personal trainer had focused on maintaining his physique for aesthetic and general health purposes rather than developing the kind of practical strength needed for carrying equipment, digging trenches, or performing the countless physical tasks that comprised military life. The gap between his comfortable gym workouts and actual physical demands became embarrassingly apparent as the evaluation progressed.\n\n\"Mr. Kova\u010di\u0107,\" Sergeant Major Novak called during a brief rest period. \"How would you assess your performance so far today?\"\n\nThe question was clearly designed to test Viktor's self-awareness and honesty rather than simply gather information. Around them, other candidates were breathing heavily but showing signs of recovery that suggested better baseline fitness than Viktor currently possessed.\n\n\"I'm performing below the standards I expected of myself,\" Viktor admitted, wiping sweat from his forehead with a towel provided by the testing staff. \"My regular exercise routine has not prepared me adequately for these demands. However, I believe I could reach required fitness levels with proper training and commitment to improvement.\"\n\nNovak nodded approvingly at the honest assessment. \"Recognizing your current limitations is more valuable than pretending they don't exist. Military training is designed to build capability in individuals who demonstrate potential and determination rather than requiring perfection from the beginning. Your willingness to acknowledge weakness suggests you might be capable of addressing it constructively.\"\n\nThe psychological evaluation proved more challenging in different ways. Viktor found himself in a small office across from a military psychologist, Dr. Petra Kralj, whose questions probed into his motivations, family background, and emotional stability with the kind of professional thoroughness that made casual deception impossible. She had clearly reviewed his application materials carefully and developed specific concerns about his suitability for military service.\n\n\"Mr. Kova\u010di\u0107, your application indicates considerable business success and financial security. Most people in your position seek ways to maintain and expand their advantages rather than voluntarily subjecting themselves to military discipline and potential danger. Help me understand what's driving this decision,\" Dr. Kralj began, her pen poised over a notepad that would presumably capture his responses for later analysis.\n\nViktor had prepared for this question during his sleepless night, but sitting in the clinical environment made his prepared answers feel inadequate and somewhat artificial. \"I've achieved the goals I set for myself professionally and financially, but I find myself questioning whether those achievements have contributed anything meaningful to my community or country. Military service represents an opportunity to use whatever capabilities I possess in service of something larger than personal profit.\"\n\n\"That's a thoughtful response, but it doesn't fully address the question of timing and method. There are many ways to contribute to community and country that wouldn't require abandoning your current responsibilities and capabilities. Why military service specifically, and why now?\" Dr. Kralj's follow-up questions demonstrated the kind of logical persistence that made superficial explanations impossible to maintain.\n\nViktor realized that his surface-level justifications were being systematically dismantled by someone trained to identify the psychological complexities behind major life decisions. \"I suppose I need to prove to myself that I'm capable of functioning in an environment where my background provides no advantages, where I'm evaluated purely on my ability to meet standards and contribute to group objectives. My current life feels insulated from real consequence and genuine challenge.\"\n\n\"So military service is a form of personal testing rather than genuine desire to serve?\" The psychologist's question was phrased neutrally, but Viktor sensed that his answer would be crucial to her assessment of his suitability.\n\n\"Both, I think. I can't separate my desire to serve from my need to test myself, because I'm not certain I have anything valuable to offer until I understand what I'm truly capable of when everything comfortable and familiar is removed.\" The honesty of this response surprised Viktor himself, as he hadn't fully articulated this connection between service and self-discovery even in his private thoughts.\n\nDr. Kralj made several notes before continuing with questions about his family relationships, social support systems, and methods of handling stress and conflict. Viktor found himself discussing his mother's opposition to his military plans, his relative isolation despite business success, and his tendency to make major decisions independently rather than seeking input from others. As the conversation progressed, he began to see patterns in his behavior that suggested both strengths and potential problems for military adaptation.\n\n\"Tell me about your support systems outside of work. Close friendships, romantic relationships, hobbies or activities that provide personal satisfaction,\" Dr. Kralj requested, and Viktor felt a familiar discomfort with questions that revealed the limitations of his social connections.\n\n\"I have business associates and social acquaintances, but few relationships I would characterize as close friendships. My work has been demanding, and I've tended to prioritize professional obligations over personal relationships. As for romantic involvement, there's been no one serious in recent years.\" Viktor paused, aware that his response painted a picture of isolation that might be concerning to a psychologist evaluating his emotional stability.\n\nWhat he couldn't explain was how Marko had filled some of the void left by limited human connections, providing companionship and honest feedback that his business relationships rarely offered. The puppet's presence in his life would be impossible to discuss without raising questions about his psychological state that would certainly disqualify him from military service. Yet omitting this significant relationship meant presenting an incomplete picture of his emotional landscape.\n\n\"Social isolation can be particularly challenging in military environments, which rely heavily on unit cohesion and mutual support among service members. How do you think you would adapt to living and working in close proximity with others, following orders from superiors, and potentially placing your life in the hands of people you've just met?\" Dr. Kralj's question highlighted one of Viktor's deepest concerns about military life.\n\n\"I acknowledge that would be a significant adjustment for me. I'm accustomed to independence and control over my environment. However, I believe that learning to function effectively within military structure would be valuable personal development, regardless of whether I ultimately pursue a long-term military career.\" Viktor tried to frame his inexperience with interdependence as an opportunity for growth rather than a liability that would hinder his military effectiveness.\n\nThe psychological evaluation continued for over an hour, covering topics from his relationship with authority figures to his methods of handling frustration and disappointment. Dr. Kralj's questions were designed to reveal both conscious and unconscious motivations, and Viktor found himself sharing thoughts and feelings he rarely acknowledged even to himself. The process was exhausting in ways that physical exertion hadn't been, requiring a level of self-examination that his comfortable life had rarely demanded.\n\nWhen the evaluations finally concluded in the late afternoon, Viktor felt simultaneously drained and oddly relieved. He had presented himself as honestly as possible given the constraints of the situation, and now the decision about his military suitability would be made by others based on objective criteria rather than his own self-assessment. There was something liberating about surrendering control of the outcome after months of internal debate and uncertainty.\n\n\"Results will be available by Friday,\" Sergeant Major Novak informed the candidates as they prepared to leave. \"Regardless of whether you're accepted for military service, today's experience should have provided valuable insights into your current capabilities and areas for potential improvement. Use that information constructively, whatever path you choose to follow.\"\n\nThe drive home gave Viktor time to process the day's experiences and consider what he had learned about himself through the evaluation process. His physical limitations had been humbling but not entirely surprising, and they represented challenges that could be addressed through dedicated training. The psychological assessment had been more revealing, forcing him to confront the extent of his social isolation and his tendency to use major life changes as substitutes for addressing underlying issues with his current circumstances.\n\nMarko had remained silent throughout the journey to and from the recruitment office, hidden in Viktor's gym bag and presumably observing everything without being able to comment. Now, as they sat in the apartment's living room with the city lights beginning to twinkle below, the puppet seemed eager to discuss the day's events and their implications for Viktor's future decisions.\n\n\"Well, that was certainly educational,\" Marko observed, positioning himself on the coffee table where he could face Viktor directly. \"Nothing like a thorough military evaluation to reveal the gaps between self-perception and objective reality. How are you feeling about your performance today?\"\n\nViktor considered the question while pouring himself a glass of wine, his first alcohol in several days as he had attempted to prepare his body for the physical demands of the evaluation. \"Humbled, primarily. I knew intellectually that military life would be different from business life, but experiencing the actual requirements made those differences much more concrete and challenging than I had anticipated.\"\n\n\"And the psychological evaluation? I noticed you were quite subdued when you returned to collect me from the gym bag. Dr. Kralj must have asked some pointed questions about your motivations and mental state.\" Marko's button eyes seemed particularly attentive as he waited for Viktor's response to this more sensitive topic.\n\n\"She was thorough and professional, but her questions forced me to examine aspects of my decision that I hadn't fully considered. The distinction between wanting to serve and needing to prove something to myself, the role that social isolation might be playing in my desire to join a structured group environment, the possibility that I'm using military service as an escape from problems that would still exist when I returned to civilian life.\" Viktor found himself grateful for Marko's presence and perspective, even as he remained unable to explain their relationship to others.\n\n\"Those are important distinctions,\" the puppet agreed thoughtfully. \"Military service motivated primarily by personal need rather than genuine desire to serve might not be sustainable when faced with real hardship and danger. On the other hand, complex motivations don't necessarily invalidate the desire to contribute something meaningful to your country's defense.\"\n\nTheir conversation was interrupted by Viktor's phone ringing with a call from Ana, who had been managing his business affairs with her usual efficiency while he focused on military preparations. Her voice carried a note of concern that suggested complications had arisen in his absence, the kind of issues that required his personal attention and decision-making authority.\n\n\"Mr. Kova\u010di\u0107, I'm sorry to disturb you this evening, but we've received an urgent request from our Romanian partners about the shipping contract you negotiated last month. There are questions about delivery schedules that they want to discuss with you personally tomorrow morning. Also, your mother called to ask about your evaluation today, and there are three reporters who somehow obtained your mobile number and want to interview you about your military plans.\"\n\nThe intrusion of normal business concerns and media attention felt jarring after a day spent focused entirely on physical capability and psychological fitness for military service. Viktor realized that his attempt to pursue military service was creating complications for his existing responsibilities that he hadn't fully anticipated, and that his decision would affect not only his own life but also the livelihoods of people who depended on his business leadership.\n\n\"Schedule the call with Romania for tomorrow afternoon, tell my mother I'll contact her this evening, and refer any media inquiries to our standard policy of not commenting on personal matters,\" Viktor instructed, though he wondered how long he could maintain separation between his public role as a business leader and his private exploration of alternative life paths.\n\nAfter ending the call, he found Marko watching him with an expression that seemed to combine sympathy with gentle amusement at the complexity Viktor had created for himself through his military aspirations.\n\n\"Nothing like a little reality intrusion to remind you that major life changes involve more than just personal transformation,\" the puppet observed wryly. \"Your business partners and employees have legitimate interests in your decisions that extend beyond your individual quest for meaning and purpose.\"\n\nViktor nodded grimly, recognizing that his romantic notions about abandoning his comfortable life for military service had overlooked the practical responsibilities and relationships that couldn't be easily abandoned or transferred to others. Whatever decision emerged from his military evaluation would need to account for these broader considerations, making his choice more complex than simply determining whether he was capable of military service."

                         "text": "**Chapter 4**\n\nThe three days between Viktor's military evaluation and the promised results felt like an eternity suspended between two entirely different versions of his future. Wednesday brought the scheduled conference call with the Romanian partners, during which Viktor found himself negotiating shipping schedules and profit margins while simultaneously wondering if he would soon be learning to disassemble rifles and navigate obstacle courses. The cognitive dissonance between his business persona and his potential military identity created a strange sense of living in parallel realities, neither of which felt entirely authentic or sustainable.\n\nMarko had taken to offering running commentary on this internal division, perching on Viktor's shoulder during business calls and whispering observations about the absurdity of discussing quarterly projections when Viktor's mind was occupied with questions about basic training and deployment possibilities. The puppet seemed to find particular amusement in Viktor's attempts to maintain professional focus while privately rehearsing how he would respond to either acceptance or rejection of his military application. During a particularly tedious discussion of shipping insurance policies, Marko had suggested that Viktor should mention his potential military service as a way to make the conversation more interesting, a suggestion that Viktor had ignored with considerable effort.\n\nThursday morning brought an unexpected visit from his Uncle Tomislav, his father's younger brother who had served alongside Dragan during the Homeland War and maintained connections within Croatia's military community. Tomislav's appearance at Viktor's apartment was unprecedented, as their relationship had remained cordial but distant since his father's death, limited primarily to brief conversations at family gatherings and occasional business referrals. His presence suggested that news of Viktor's military aspirations had spread beyond his immediate family and attracted attention from quarters Viktor hadn't anticipated.\n\n\"Viktor, we need to discuss this military situation before you make any irreversible decisions,\" Tomislav announced as he settled into the living room's leather furniture, his weathered hands wrapped around the coffee cup Viktor had offered him. At fifty-eight, Tomislav bore the physical marks of his military service\u2014a slight limp from shrapnel wounds, scars on his left hand from combat injuries, and the particular alertness that came from years of training to notice potential threats. His civilian clothes couldn't entirely mask the bearing of someone who had spent decades in uniform, and his presence filled the apartment with an authority that made Viktor feel like a child playing at adult decisions.\n\nMarko had quickly hidden himself behind a decorative vase when Tomislav arrived, apparently recognizing that their conversation would require Viktor's complete attention without the distraction of puppet-based commentary. Viktor found himself missing the moral support of his unusual companion, particularly when facing a family member whose military experience provided the kind of credibility Viktor lacked in evaluating his own aspirations. Tomislav's opinions about military service carried weight that couldn't be dismissed as maternal overprotectiveness or civilian ignorance about the realities of military life.\n\n\"I understand your concerns, Uncle, but I've given this decision considerable thought and proceeded through the proper evaluation process. Whatever the recruitment office decides about my suitability will be based on professional assessment rather than family opinions about what's appropriate for someone in my position,\" Viktor replied, attempting to project confidence despite feeling increasingly uncertain about his motivations and capabilities as more people questioned his judgment.\n\nTomislav studied his nephew with the kind of penetrating gaze that seemed to see through surface explanations to underlying truths, a skill developed through years of evaluating soldiers under stress and making life-or-death decisions based on accurate assessment of human capabilities. His expression suggested neither approval nor disapproval but rather the careful consideration of someone weighing complex factors before offering judgment. When he finally spoke, his words carried the authority of experience rather than mere opinion.\n\n\"Viktor, military service isn't about proving yourself or finding meaning through hardship. Those might be side effects of military life, but they're not its purpose. Soldiers serve because their country needs protection, because someone has to stand between civilians and those who would harm them. If you're joining the military primarily for personal reasons\u2014to test yourself, to escape boredom, to find purpose\u2014then you're approaching it from the wrong direction, and that will create problems for both you and the people who have to depend on you in dangerous situations.\"\n\nThe directness of this assessment cut through Viktor's carefully constructed justifications and forced him to confront questions he had been avoiding about the distinction between service motivated by genuine commitment to others versus service motivated primarily by personal need. His uncle's combat experience provided perspective on the life-or-death consequences of military service that Viktor's comfortable civilian life had never required him to consider seriously. The possibility that his personal motivations might compromise his effectiveness as a soldier or endanger his fellow service members introduced moral dimensions to his decision that extended far beyond his individual quest for meaning and purpose.\n\n\"I want to serve my country, Uncle. The personal benefits are secondary to the desire to contribute something meaningful to Croatia's defense,\" Viktor insisted, though he wondered if this distinction was as clear in his own mind as he was attempting to make it sound to his uncle.\n\n\"Contributing to Croatia's defense is admirable, but there are many ways to serve your country that don't involve military service. You employ hundreds of people, pay substantial taxes, and contribute to economic development that strengthens our nation's foundation. Your shipping business supports international trade relationships that benefit Croatia's position in global markets. Why isn't that contribution sufficient? What specifically do you hope to accomplish through military service that you cannot accomplish through your current civilian role?\" Tomislav's questions echoed concerns that Viktor's mother and Dr. Kralj had raised, creating a pattern of challenges to his reasoning that was becoming increasingly difficult to dismiss or rationalize.\n\nViktor found himself struggling to articulate specific military objectives beyond vague notions about testing his character and proving his worth through service. The more people questioned his motivations, the more he realized how much of his decision was based on emotional impulse rather than rational analysis of how his capabilities could best serve his country's needs. His business success demonstrated his ability to contribute meaningfully to Croatia's prosperity, but he had convinced himself that civilian contribution was somehow less valuable or authentic than military service, a belief that was becoming harder to defend under scrutiny from people with actual military experience.\n\n\"Perhaps I need to understand what real service means before I can effectively contribute through civilian means,\" Viktor offered, recognizing even as he spoke that this justification sounded increasingly weak and self-serving. \"Military experience might provide perspective that would make my civilian contributions more meaningful and effective.\"\n\nTomislav's expression shifted to something that might have been sympathy mixed with concern, the look of someone who recognized sincere confusion beneath misguided reasoning. He leaned forward in his chair, his voice taking on the tone of someone sharing hard-earned wisdom rather than simply offering criticism. \"Viktor, military service will certainly provide perspective, but it's not the kind of perspective that necessarily translates into improved civilian leadership. Military experience teaches you to function within hierarchical structures, to follow orders without question, to prioritize group objectives over individual preferences. Those skills can be valuable, but they're quite different from the independent thinking and strategic decision-making that have made you successful in business. You might find that military service actually conflicts with rather than enhances your civilian capabilities.\"\n\nThis possibility had not occurred to Viktor during his months of contemplating military service. He had assumed that military discipline and leadership training would complement and improve his business skills, but his uncle's analysis suggested that military and civilian leadership might require fundamentally different approaches that could interfere with each other rather than creating synergistic benefits. The idea that military service might actually diminish his effectiveness in his current role introduced new complications to his decision-making process that he hadn't anticipated.\n\nTheir conversation was interrupted by Viktor's phone ringing with the call he had been anticipating and dreading in equal measure. The recruitment office number appeared on the display, and both Viktor and Tomislav fell silent as they recognized the significance of this moment. The conversation with Sergeant Major Novak would determine whether Viktor's military aspirations could proceed beyond theoretical consideration to actual implementation, and whatever news emerged would shape not only Viktor's immediate future but also his understanding of his own capabilities and limitations.\n\n\"Viktor Kova\u010di\u0107 speaking,\" he answered, his voice steadier than he felt as he prepared to receive either validation or rejection of his military suitability.\n\n\"Mr. Kova\u010di\u0107, this is Sergeant Major Novak. We've completed our evaluation of your application and assessment results. Can you come to the office this afternoon at three o'clock to discuss our findings and recommendations?\" The sergeant major's tone revealed nothing about whether the news would be positive or negative, maintaining the kind of professional neutrality that military personnel used when delivering potentially significant information.\n\n\"Yes, I can be there at three o'clock. Should I bring anything or prepare for any specific type of discussion?\" Viktor asked, glancing at his uncle, who was listening with obvious interest to this pivotal conversation.\n\n\"Just bring identification and be prepared for a frank conversation about your future options regarding military service. We'll discuss the details when you arrive this afternoon.\" Novak ended the call without providing any hints about whether Viktor's evaluation had been successful or whether he would be advised to pursue alternative forms of service to his country.\n\nAfter ending the call, Viktor sat in contemplative silence while his uncle waited patiently for him to share the details of the conversation. The appointment at three o'clock would provide definitive answers about his military eligibility, but Viktor realized that he was no longer certain which outcome he hoped to receive. The conversations with family members, the challenging evaluation process, and his uncle's pointed questions about his motivations had created doubt about whether military service was truly the right path for addressing his dissatisfaction with his current life.\n\n\"Three o'clock this afternoon for the results,\" Viktor announced finally. \"Sergeant Major Novak wants to discuss my evaluation findings and future options regarding military service.\"\n\nTomislav nodded thoughtfully, his expression suggesting that he was considering how to respond to whatever news emerged from that afternoon's meeting. \"Viktor, regardless of what the military evaluation concludes about your technical suitability for service, I want you to remember that there's no shame in deciding that military life isn't the right fit for your particular situation and goals. Choosing not to pursue military service doesn't indicate cowardice or lack of patriotism\u2014it indicates self-awareness and realistic assessment of how you can best contribute to your country's welfare.\"\n\nThe permission to change his mind without loss of honor was something Viktor hadn't realized he needed to hear, but his uncle's words provided relief from the pressure he had created for himself to follow through with military service regardless of whether it proved to be genuinely appropriate for his circumstances. The possibility that wisdom might lie in recognizing the limitations of military service for addressing his personal concerns rather than forcing himself to proceed with an ill-suited solution had not occurred to him during his months of single-minded focus on joining the army.\n\nAfter Tomislav left, Viktor found himself alone with his thoughts and Marko, who emerged from his hiding place with obvious curiosity about the conversation and its implications for their shared future. The puppet had been uncharacteristically subdued during the visit from Viktor's uncle, perhaps recognizing that this particular family discussion required serious consideration without the distraction of his usually irreverent commentary. Now, with the apartment returned to its normal quiet, Marko seemed eager to process the morning's developments and prepare for the afternoon's crucial meeting.\n\n\"Your uncle presented some compelling arguments against military service,\" Marko observed as he positioned himself on the coffee table where he could observe Viktor's facial expressions during their conversation. \"The distinction between service motivated by genuine commitment to others versus service motivated by personal need seems particularly relevant to your situation. How are you feeling about that analysis?\"\n\nViktor considered the puppet's question while preparing lunch, his hands moving automatically through the familiar routine of sandwich preparation while his mind wrestled with increasingly complex questions about his motivations and objectives. \"I think he's right that my reasons for wanting military service are primarily personal rather than genuinely focused on national defense. But I'm not certain that invalidates the decision entirely. Perhaps personal growth and national service can coexist as compatible objectives, even if one is more prominent than the other in my specific case.\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" Marko agreed, \"but your uncle's point about the potential conflict between military and civilian leadership styles seems worth considering seriously. If military service actually diminishes your effectiveness in your current role, then you might be reducing rather than enhancing your contribution to Croatia's welfare. That would be counterproductive regardless of what personal benefits you might derive from the military experience.\"\n\nThe possibility that his quest for personal meaning through military service might actually harm his ability to serve his country through civilian means was a troubling consideration that Viktor had not anticipated when he began this process. His business success provided employment for hundreds of people, contributed to Croatia's economic development, and generated tax revenue that supported government services including military funding. If military service compromised his civilian effectiveness, then his personal growth might come at the expense of his broader social contribution, creating an ethical dilemma about the proper balance between individual fulfillment and social responsibility.\n\n\"I suppose this afternoon's meeting will provide more clarity about whether these concerns are theoretical or practical,\" Viktor said finally. \"If I'm not accepted for military service, then the question becomes moot and I'll need to find alternative approaches to addressing my dissatisfaction with my current life. If I am accepted, then I'll have to decide whether the potential benefits outweigh the risks and complications that family members have identified.\"\n\nThe afternoon drive to the recruitment office felt different from his previous visits, carrying the weight of a decision point that would determine the direction of his immediate future and possibly reshape his understanding of his own identity and capabilities. Viktor found himself simultaneously hoping for acceptance and rejection, wanting validation of his military potential while also recognizing the wisdom in the concerns that had been raised about his motivations and the potential consequences of military service for his existing responsibilities and relationships.\n\nMarko had accompanied him on this journey, hidden in his jacket pocket and providing the kind of moral support that Viktor couldn't request from human companions who would find his relationship with the puppet impossible to understand or accept. The puppet's presence offered continuity and perspective that helped Viktor maintain some emotional equilibrium as he prepared to receive news that might fundamentally alter his life's trajectory or confirm that his current path, however unsatisfying, was his most appropriate option for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe recruitment office appeared unchanged from his previous visits, but Viktor's perception of the environment had evolved as his understanding of military service had become more sophisticated and nuanced. The motivational posters and displays of military equipment now represented not just abstract concepts of service and sacrifice but specific commitments that would require him to surrender much of his current independence and comfort in exchange for purposes and relationships he could only imagine based on limited civilian perspective.\n\nSergeant Major Novak emerged from his office precisely at three o'clock, his expression maintaining the same professional neutrality that had characterized all of Viktor's interactions with military personnel. His bearing suggested the importance of the conversation they were about to have, but provided no hints about whether Viktor's evaluation had been successful or whether he would be advised to pursue alternative paths for addressing his desire to serve his country.\n\n\"Mr. Kova\u010di\u0107, please come in. We have several matters to discuss regarding your evaluation results and potential future with military service,\" Novak said as he gestured toward his office, where Viktor noticed that Dr. Kralj was also present, her notepad and professional demeanor suggesting that the psychological aspects of his evaluation would be significant components of whatever recommendations emerged from this meeting.\n\nAs Viktor settled into the chair across from the two military professionals, he felt Marko shifting slightly in his jacket pocket, a subtle reminder that whatever news he received, he would not face the consequences entirely alone. The support of his unusual companion provided strength for receiving information that might validate his military aspirations or redirect his search for meaning toward less dramatic but potentially more appropriate civilian alternatives."

                         "text": "**Chapter 5**\n\nThe recruitment office felt smaller with three people occupying the space, and Viktor found himself acutely aware of every detail\u2014the institutional fluorescent lighting that cast everything in harsh clarity, the smell of strong coffee mixed with the faint odor of cleaning supplies, and the weight of two pairs of professional eyes evaluating his reactions to whatever news they were about to deliver. Sergeant Major Novak arranged several documents on his desk with military precision while Dr. Kralj positioned her notepad at an angle that would allow her to observe Viktor's responses while taking notes. The formality of their preparation suggested that this conversation would be comprehensive and potentially challenging, requiring Viktor to process complex information about his military eligibility and make decisions with far-reaching consequences for his future.\n\n\"Mr. Kova\u010di\u0107, we've completed a thorough review of your physical and psychological evaluations, and we have both positive and concerning findings to discuss with you today,\" Sergeant Major Novak began, his tone suggesting that the news would be neither simple acceptance nor outright rejection but something more nuanced that would require careful consideration. \"Your psychological profile indicates high intelligence, leadership potential, and genuine motivation to serve, all of which are valuable qualities in military personnel. Dr. Kralj was particularly impressed with your honesty about your limitations and your willingness to acknowledge areas where you would need significant improvement to meet military standards.\"\n\nDr. Kralj nodded her agreement with this assessment before adding her own observations about Viktor's psychological evaluation. \"Your responses demonstrated self-awareness and realistic assessment of the challenges you would face in transitioning from civilian to military life. However, we also identified some concerns about your motivations and support systems that need to be addressed before we could recommend you for military service. The psychological evaluation suggested that your desire to join the military is driven primarily by personal dissatisfaction with your current circumstances rather than genuine commitment to military objectives and values. While personal motivations aren't inherently disqualifying, they can create problems if they're not balanced by authentic dedication to service above self.\"\n\nViktor felt a familiar tightness in his chest as the psychologist's words confirmed many of the concerns his family members had raised about his reasons for pursuing military service. The professional validation of his psychological suitability was gratifying, but the identification of motivational concerns struck at the heart of his own doubts about whether he was approaching military service for the right reasons. In his jacket pocket, he could feel Marko shifting slightly, perhaps responding to his increased tension as the conversation moved toward the core issues that would determine his military future.\n\n\"Regarding your physical evaluation,\" Sergeant Major Novak continued, consulting a different set of documents that presumably contained the results of Viktor's fitness testing, \"your current conditioning is below military standards but within the range that could be improved through intensive training. Your cardiovascular fitness, strength, and coordination would all require significant development before you could perform effectively in demanding military environments. However, your performance during the evaluation demonstrated determination and willingness to push through discomfort, which suggests you might be capable of the physical improvement necessary for military service if you're committed to the training requirements.\"\n\nThe mixed nature of these results created a complex situation where Viktor was neither clearly accepted nor definitively rejected but rather presented with conditional possibilities that would require substantial commitment and improvement on his part. The military's willingness to consider his application despite his current limitations suggested that they saw potential in his candidacy, but their concerns about his motivations and the extensive preparation he would need indicated that military service would not be the straightforward path to purpose and meaning that he had initially imagined.\n\n\"What specific steps would be required if I wanted to proceed with military service?\" Viktor asked, recognizing that understanding the practical requirements might help him determine whether his commitment to this path was genuine or merely theoretical. The question felt like a test of his own seriousness about military service, since the answer would reveal whether he was prepared to undertake the demanding process of transforming himself into someone capable of effective military performance.\n\nDr. Kralj consulted her notes before responding to Viktor's question with the kind of detailed explanation that suggested these requirements were standard procedure rather than special accommodations for his particular situation. \"We would recommend a six-month civilian preparation period during which you would work with military trainers to improve your physical conditioning and with military counselors to examine your motivations more thoroughly. This period would allow you to experience something closer to military discipline and demands while maintaining your civilian responsibilities, giving you a more realistic understanding of what military service would actually involve. At the end of six months, we would conduct another comprehensive evaluation to determine whether you had made sufficient progress in both physical and psychological preparation to warrant acceptance into basic training.\"\n\nThe proposed preparation period represented a significant commitment that would require Viktor to maintain his business obligations while simultaneously undergoing intensive physical and psychological training designed to prepare him for military life. The six-month timeline would allow him to test his commitment to military service without completely abandoning his current responsibilities, but it would also mean living in a state of uncertainty and divided focus that might be challenging to sustain over an extended period. Viktor realized that accepting this conditional path would essentially commit him to military service unless he discovered during the preparation period that he was unsuited for or uninterested in military life.\n\n\"This preparation period would involve reporting to military facilities for physical training three days per week, meeting with military counselors twice per week to work on motivational and psychological issues, and completing assignments designed to familiarize you with military culture, history, and expectations,\" Sergeant Major Novak added, providing specific details about what the six-month program would require from Viktor in terms of time, energy, and commitment. \"You would maintain your civilian status during this period, but you would be expected to conduct yourself according to military standards of discipline, punctuality, and respect for authority. Failure to meet these standards or significant absence from required activities would result in termination from the program and disqualification from future military service applications.\"\n\nThe structured nature of the preparation program appealed to Viktor's preference for clear objectives and measurable progress, but the intensive schedule would require significant adjustments to his current lifestyle and business practices. Three days per week of physical training plus twice-weekly counseling sessions would consume substantial time and energy that he currently devoted to business development and personal leisure. The requirement to maintain military standards of conduct during the preparation period would also mean surrendering some of the flexibility and independence that had characterized his civilian life, providing a preview of the more extensive surrendering of autonomy that military service would ultimately require.\n\n\"I appreciate the thoroughness of your evaluation and the opportunity to participate in this preparation program,\" Viktor said carefully, recognizing that his response to this offer would be crucial to how the military personnel assessed his genuine commitment to service. \"May I have some time to consider this proposal and discuss it with my family before making a final decision about proceeding with the preparation program?\"\n\nDr. Kralj and Sergeant Major Novak exchanged glances that suggested they had anticipated this request and discussed how to respond to it during their preparation for this meeting. Their willingness to allow Viktor time for consideration indicated that they viewed his decision as significant enough to warrant careful thought rather than impulsive commitment, but their expressions also suggested that extended delay would be interpreted as lack of genuine interest in military service.\n\n\"You may have one week to consider the preparation program and notify us of your decision,\" Novak replied after a moment of consideration. \"This timeline will allow you to discuss the opportunity with family members and business associates while ensuring that we can begin the preparation program with adequate time for you to complete it successfully before the next basic training cycle begins. If you decide to decline the preparation program, we ask that you notify us promptly so that we can offer the opportunity to other candidates who might benefit from intensive pre-military training.\"\n\nThe one-week deadline created urgency around Viktor's decision while providing sufficient time for him to have meaningful conversations with the people whose opinions he valued most. The knowledge that other candidates might benefit from the preparation program if he declined added weight to his decision by making it clear that his choice would have consequences beyond his individual situation. Viktor realized that declining the program would not only end his military aspirations but would also represent a lost opportunity for someone else who might be more genuinely committed to military service than his own psychologically complex motivations suggested he was.\n\nAs Viktor prepared to leave the recruitment office, Dr. Kralj offered a final observation that seemed designed to help him make his decision with full awareness of the psychological dimensions involved. \"Mr. Kova\u010di\u0107, the preparation program is designed not only to improve your military readiness but also to help you understand your true motivations for seeking military service. Many people discover during this process that their desire to join the military was actually a desire for something else\u2014structure, purpose, challenge, community\u2014that can be found through civilian means. Others discover that military service is indeed their calling and that the preparation period confirms their commitment to serving their country through military means. Both outcomes are valuable if they lead to honest self-understanding and appropriate life choices.\"\n\nThe drive home from the recruitment office gave Viktor time to process the complex news he had received and begin considering how to approach the decision about the preparation program. The conditional acceptance represented both validation of his potential and acknowledgment of his current limitations, creating a situation where his military future would depend entirely on his willingness to commit to substantial personal change and improvement. The six-month preparation period would test not only his physical capabilities and psychological readiness but also his genuine commitment to military service versus his interest in the idea of military service as a solution to his personal dissatisfaction.\n\nMarko remained silent during the drive, apparently recognizing that Viktor needed time to absorb the information and implications of the military's offer without the distraction of commentary or analysis. The puppet's presence provided comfort without demanding attention, allowing Viktor to think through the practical and emotional aspects of the decision he faced while maintaining the sense of companionship that helped him process complex situations. When they finally arrived at the apartment and Viktor settled into his familiar living room environment, Marko emerged from the jacket pocket and positioned himself where they could have their first conversation about the afternoon's developments.\n\n\"Well, that was more complicated than simple acceptance or rejection,\" Marko observed as he arranged himself on the coffee table where he could observe Viktor's facial expressions during their discussion. \"A six-month preparation program that might lead to military service if you prove capable of sufficient improvement in physical conditioning and psychological readiness. How are you feeling about this conditional opportunity?\"\n\nViktor poured himself a glass of wine and settled into his leather chair, recognizing that he needed to work through his thoughts about the military's offer before he could make an informed decision about proceeding with the preparation program. \"I'm simultaneously encouraged and daunted by their assessment. The fact that they see enough potential to warrant a preparation program suggests that my military aspirations aren't completely unrealistic, but the extensive requirements for improvement indicate that I'm much further from military readiness than I had realized when I began this process.\"\n\n\"The psychological concerns they identified seem particularly significant,\" Marko noted thoughtfully. \"Dr. Kralj's observation about your motivations being primarily personal rather than genuinely focused on military service echoes what your mother and uncle said about your reasons for wanting to join the army. That's a pattern of feedback that suggests the concern is legitimate rather than simply one person's opinion about your decision.\"\n\nThe consistency of the psychological assessment with his family members' concerns about his motivations was indeed troubling because it suggested that his self-understanding was less accurate than he had believed. Viktor had convinced himself that his desire to serve his country was genuine and that his personal needs for purpose and challenge were secondary considerations, but the professional evaluation indicated that he had the priority reversed in ways that could create problems for his military effectiveness and satisfaction. The recognition that his own analysis of his motivations might be flawed forced him to question other aspects of his reasoning about military service and its potential benefits for his personal and professional life.\n\n\"Perhaps the preparation program would provide the clarity I need about whether my interest in military service is genuine or whether I'm using it as an elaborate form of escapism from civilian responsibilities,\" Viktor suggested, recognizing that the six-month program might serve diagnostic purposes regardless of whether it ultimately led to military enlistment. \"If I discover during the preparation period that military life doesn't actually address my underlying dissatisfaction with my current circumstances, then I would have learned something valuable about myself without making irreversible commitments to military service.\"\n\n\"That's a reasonable approach,\" Marko agreed, \"but it requires acknowledging that the preparation program might lead you to conclude that military service isn't appropriate for your situation, and being genuinely open to that possibility rather than viewing the program as simply an obstacle to overcome on your way to inevitable enlistment. The value of the preparation period depends on your willingness to let it change your mind if the experience suggests that military service wouldn't actually provide what you're seeking.\"\n\nThis observation highlighted a crucial question about Viktor's flexibility regarding his military plans and his ability to change direction if the preparation program revealed that his motivations or capabilities were insufficient for effective military service. His tendency toward stubbornness and his discomfort with admitting mistakes might make it difficult for him to abandon military aspirations even if the evidence suggested that course correction would be wise. The preparation program would only be genuinely useful if he approached it with authentic openness to whatever conclusions emerged from the experience, rather than using it as a way to justify a decision he had already made for other reasons.\n\nTheir conversation was interrupted by the arrival of Viktor's mother, who had apparently been waiting for news about his military evaluation and decided that calling was insufficient for discussing whatever results he had received. Margarita entered the apartment with the determined energy that characterized her approach to situations she considered significant, and her expression suggested that she was prepared for either celebration or consolation depending on what news Viktor had received from the recruitment office. Marko quickly concealed himself behind a decorative bowl, recognizing that this conversation would require Viktor's complete attention and that the puppet's presence would complicate an already complex family discussion about his military future.\n\n\"Viktor, how did your evaluation go today? Ana said you had an appointment this afternoon to receive the results of your military testing,\" Margarita announced as she settled herself in the living room with the air of someone prepared for a lengthy and important conversation. Her tone suggested both anxiety about what news he might have received and determination to be supportive regardless of whether the military had accepted or rejected his application for service.\n\n\"The results were mixed, Mama. They identified both potential and significant concerns about my readiness for military service,\" Viktor replied, recognizing that his mother deserved a complete explanation of the situation but uncertain about how she would respond to news that his military future remained undecided and dependent on his performance during a six-month preparation program. \"They're offering me the opportunity to participate in intensive training to improve my physical conditioning and examine my motivations more thoroughly before making a final decision about military enlistment.\"\n\nMargarita's expression shifted from anxiety to something that might have been relief mixed with continued concern, as if the news that Viktor's military service was neither definitely accepted nor definitively rejected provided both reassurance that he wouldn't immediately abandon his civilian life and worry that the uncertainty might extend his internal conflict about his future direction. Her response suggested that she had been preparing herself for either complete acceptance or total rejection rather than the conditional opportunity that actually emerged from his evaluation.\n\n\"A preparation program sounds like a reasonable approach,\" she said carefully, apparently weighing her words to avoid either discouraging his military interests or encouraging what she still considered a questionable decision. \"It would allow you to explore military life more thoroughly before making irreversible commitments, and it would give you time to ensure that your business affairs are properly arranged if you ultimately decide to pursue military service. How are you feeling about this opportunity?\"\n\nViktor appreciated his mother's measured response, which acknowledged both the potential value of the preparation program and the ongoing concerns about his military plans without demanding that he abandon his aspirations or commit to them immediately. Her willingness to support his exploration of military service while maintaining her reservations about its appropriateness for his situation demonstrated the kind of parental wisdom that prioritized his autonomous decision-making over her personal preferences about his choices.\n\n\"I'm grateful for the opportunity, but I'm also aware that the preparation program represents a substantial commitment that would require significant changes to my current routine and responsibilities,\" Viktor replied honestly. \"The physical training alone would consume three days per week, plus twice-weekly counseling sessions and additional assignments related to military culture and expectations. It would essentially mean living a double life for six months while I determine whether military service is genuinely appropriate for my situation and goals.\"\n\n\"Living a double life might not be entirely negative if it helps you understand which life is more authentic and satisfying for you,\" Margarita observed with the kind of insight that reminded Viktor why he valued his mother's perspective despite disagreeing with some of her conclusions about his military plans. \"Your current dissatisfaction suggests that your civilian life, however successful it appears from the outside, isn't providing what you need for genuine fulfillment. The preparation program might help you determine whether military structure and purpose would address that dissatisfaction or whether you need to find different approaches to creating meaning within your existing circumstances.\"\n\nThis reframing of the preparation program as a diagnostic tool for understanding his authentic preferences rather than simply a hurdle to overcome on his way to military service was helpful for Viktor's thinking about how to approach the six-month program if he decided to accept the opportunity. Rather than viewing the preparation period as an obstacle that might prevent him from achieving his military goals, he could approach it as a learning experience that would provide valuable information about his genuine compatibility with military life regardless of whether it ultimately led to enlistment. The program's value would lie in the self-understanding it provided rather than simply its potential to qualify him for military service.\n\nTheir conversation was interrupted by Viktor's phone ringing with a call from Ana, who had been managing his business affairs with increasing concern about his extended focus on military planning at the expense of attention to commercial opportunities and obligations. Her timing suggested that she had been monitoring his schedule and knew that he would have received results from his military evaluation, making this call both a check on his emotional state and an opportunity to discuss how his military plans might affect his business responsibilities and decision-making authority.\n\n\"Mr. Kova\u010di\u0107, I hope your appointment went well today. I wanted to discuss several business matters that require your attention, and I also wanted to understand how your military plans might affect your availability for the various commitments and opportunities that are developing in the coming months,\" Ana said with her characteristic directness, cutting through social pleasantries to address the practical implications of Viktor's personal decisions for their shared professional responsibilities.\n\nThe reminder of his business obligations created immediate tension between Viktor's desire to explore military service through the preparation program and his recognition that his civilian responsibilities required consistent attention and leadership that might be compromised by the demanding schedule of military preparation. Three days per week of physical training plus twice-weekly counseling sessions would reduce his availability for business travel, client meetings, and strategic planning sessions that had been crucial components of his commercial success. The question of whether he could maintain his business effectiveness while pursuing military preparation represented a practical challenge that would need resolution before he could commit to the six-month program.\n\n\"We should schedule a comprehensive meeting to discuss contingency planning and delegation of authority that would allow business operations to continue smoothly if my schedule becomes less flexible due to military preparation activities,\" Viktor replied, recognizing that professional responsibility required him to ensure that his personal exploration of military service didn't compromise his obligations to employees, partners, and clients who depended on his leadership and decision-making. The conversation with Ana would need to address both immediate adjustments to accommodate military preparation and longer-term planning for potential extended absence if he ultimately enlisted in military service.\n\nAfter ending the call with Ana, Viktor found himself facing the complex task of integrating his personal desires for military service with his practical responsibilities as a business leader and family member. The preparation program offered the opportunity to explore military life without making irreversible commitments, but it also required substantial time and energy that would need to be redirected from his current activities and relationships. The decision about whether to accept the military's conditional offer would need to account for these broader implications rather than focusing exclusively on his individual interests and aspirations.\n\n\"The business complications add another layer of complexity to your decision about the preparation program,\" Margarita observed, having listened to his conversation with Ana and apparently recognizing the tension between his military interests and his civilian responsibilities. \"It's one thing to explore military service as an individual choice, but quite another to pursue it in ways that might compromise your obligations to the people who depend on your professional leadership and decision-making. How do you plan to balance these competing demands on your time and attention?\"\n\nThe question of balance was indeed central to Viktor's decision about the military preparation program, since the six-month commitment would require him to maintain high performance in his business role while simultaneously dedicating substantial time and energy to military training and counseling. The challenge would be determining whether he could honor both sets of obligations effectively or whether pursuing military preparation would necessarily mean accepting reduced effectiveness in his civilian responsibilities. The ethical implications of potentially compromising his business leadership in order to explore personal alternatives to his current life added moral dimensions to his decision that extended beyond his individual preferences and aspirations.\n\nAs the evening progressed and Viktor continued discussing the military opportunity with his mother, he became increasingly aware of the weight of the decision he faced and the multiple constituencies whose interests would be affected by whatever choice he made about the preparation program. His employees, business partners, family members, and potential military colleagues all had legitimate stakes in his decision, making it clear that his choice about military service was not simply a personal matter but a decision with broader social and professional implications that required careful consideration of competing obligations and commitments."

                         "text": "**Chapter 7**\n\nThe weekend following Viktor's meeting at the recruitment office passed in a haze of contemplation and consultation that left him more uncertain about his decision than he had been before receiving the military's conditional offer. Saturday morning brought a long conversation with Ana about restructuring his business responsibilities to accommodate the demands of the preparation program, during which they discovered that his current hands-on leadership style would be difficult to maintain while dedicating twenty hours per week to military training and counseling. The realization that accepting the preparation program would require fundamental changes to his business operations forced Viktor to confront the extent to which his military aspirations might compromise his civilian effectiveness, creating practical obstacles to his military plans that he hadn't fully anticipated when he began pursuing service.\n\nAna's concerns extended beyond simple scheduling conflicts to questions about strategic decision-making and client relationships that required Viktor's personal attention and expertise. Several major contracts were entering crucial negotiation phases that would determine the company's revenue projections for the following year, and international partners had specifically requested Viktor's involvement in discussions about expanding their shipping arrangements into new markets. His absence or divided attention during these critical business developments could result in lost opportunities that would affect not only his personal financial situation but also the employment security of his staff and the economic relationships that supported Croatia's position in regional shipping markets.\n\n\"Mr. Kova\u010di\u0107, I understand your desire to explore military service, but I need you to consider the timing of this decision in relation to our business obligations,\" Ana had said during their Saturday morning meeting, her usual diplomatic tone carrying an edge of urgency that reflected her concern about the practical implications of his military preparation program. \"The Romanian expansion project alone will require intensive negotiation and oversight for the next four months, and the London partnership discussions are entering a phase where your personal credibility and relationships will be crucial to successful outcomes. These are opportunities that took years to develop and cannot be easily postponed or delegated to accommodate personal exploration of alternative career paths.\"\n\nThe weight of these business responsibilities created a moral dilemma for Viktor about whether pursuing personal fulfillment through military exploration justified potentially compromising his professional obligations and the livelihoods of people who depended on his commercial success. His dissatisfaction with his current life was genuine and significant, but it was also a luxury afforded by his financial security and professional achievement that many of his employees could not understand or support if it threatened their own economic stability. The question of whether his search for meaning through military service was ethically defensible when it might harm others who had contributed to his success represented a complex moral calculation that extended far beyond his individual preferences and aspirations.\n\nSunday afternoon brought an unexpected visit from Dr. Petra Kralj, the military psychologist who had conducted Viktor's evaluation, a development that suggested his case had generated more professional interest than typical recruitment situations warranted. Her appearance at his apartment was unprecedented and slightly unsettling, since military personnel rarely made house calls to discuss recruitment matters with potential candidates. Her presence suggested either exceptional concern about his psychological suitability for military service or recognition that his situation required more individualized attention than the standard recruitment process typically provided.\n\n\"Mr. Kova\u010di\u0107, I hope you'll forgive this unscheduled visit, but I wanted to discuss some additional observations about your evaluation that didn't seem appropriate to address in the formal military environment,\" Dr. Kralj explained as she accepted Viktor's offer of coffee and settled into his living room furniture with the professional composure that characterized all of her interactions. \"Your psychological profile raised some interesting questions about the role that social isolation might be playing in your desire for military service, and I thought a more informal conversation might help both of us understand your motivations more clearly.\"\n\nMarko had immediately hidden himself when Dr. Kralj arrived, apparently recognizing that her professional training would make her particularly observant about unusual elements in Viktor's living environment that might provide insights into his psychological state and social relationships. The puppet's absence left Viktor feeling somewhat exposed to the psychologist's analytical gaze, since Marko's presence had become such a consistent source of support and perspective that conversations without him felt incomplete and potentially more revealing than Viktor preferred. The irony that he was hiding his most significant relationship from someone whose job involved understanding his social connections was not lost on him, but explaining his friendship with a puppet would certainly raise questions about his mental stability that would disqualify him from military service immediately.\n\n\"I appreciate your concern about my psychological readiness for military service, Dr. Kralj, but I'm curious about what specific aspects of my evaluation suggested that additional discussion would be beneficial,\" Viktor replied carefully, recognizing that this conversation could significantly influence the military's final assessment of his suitability for the preparation program and eventual service. The psychologist's decision to visit him personally suggested that his case was more complex than routine recruitment situations, which could indicate either special potential or particular concerns that required resolution before the military could make appropriate recommendations about his future.\n\nDr. Kralj opened a leather portfolio that contained what appeared to be Viktor's complete evaluation file, including not only the formal test results and interview notes but also additional research that suggested she had investigated his background more thoroughly than he had realized during their initial meeting. Her preparation for this conversation indicated that the military took his application seriously enough to warrant comprehensive analysis of his psychological profile and social circumstances, but the extent of her research also felt somewhat invasive given that he had not yet committed to accepting their preparation program offer.\n\n\"Your evaluation responses indicated high intelligence and genuine motivation to serve, which are positive indicators for military success, but they also revealed patterns of social isolation and reliance on internal rather than external sources of validation and support that could create challenges in military environments that depend heavily on unit cohesion and peer relationships,\" she began, consulting her notes while speaking in the measured tone that mental health professionals used when discussing sensitive psychological observations. \"Military service requires individuals who can form strong bonds with their fellow service members, follow orders from superiors even when they disagree with those decisions, and subordinate their individual preferences to group objectives in ways that might be particularly difficult for someone who has operated independently for extended periods.\"\n\nThe accuracy of this assessment was uncomfortable because it identified precisely the aspects of military life that Viktor found most appealing and most threatening simultaneously. His desire to experience genuine camaraderie and shared purpose with other people was one of his primary motivations for seeking military service, but his inexperience with subordinating his individual judgment to group decisions and external authority represented a significant challenge that he hadn't fully acknowledged when he began pursuing military service. The psychological evaluation had apparently identified this tension between his needs and capabilities more clearly than he had recognized it himself, raising questions about whether military life would provide the social connections he sought or simply create new forms of frustration and isolation.\n\n\"I recognize that adapting to military culture would require significant adjustments in my approach to relationships and decision-making, but I believe that learning to function effectively within group structures would be valuable personal development regardless of whether I pursue a long-term military career,\" Viktor responded, attempting to frame his inexperience with military-style cooperation as an opportunity for growth rather than a liability that would hinder his effectiveness as a service member. \"The preparation program would presumably provide opportunities to develop these capabilities before I would be required to demonstrate them in more demanding military situations.\"\n\n\"The preparation program would certainly provide exposure to military culture and expectations, but developing genuine comfort with military social dynamics typically requires more time and experience than a six-month program can provide,\" Dr. Kralj replied with the kind of professional honesty that suggested she was more interested in helping him make an informed decision than in recruiting him for military service regardless of his suitability. \"Military relationships are built through shared hardship, mutual dependence, and demonstrated reliability under pressure, all of which require extended experience to develop authentically. The preparation program can introduce you to military expectations, but it cannot replicate the depth of relationships that sustain military personnel through genuinely difficult circumstances.\"\n\nThis limitation of the preparation program had not occurred to Viktor during his consideration of the military's offer, but it represented a significant constraint on his ability to determine whether military service would address his desire for meaningful social connections and shared purpose. If the six-month program could only provide superficial exposure to military culture rather than authentic experience of military relationships, then his decision about whether to pursue military service would still be based largely on theoretical expectations rather than practical understanding of what military life would actually provide for his psychological and social needs. The possibility that he might commit to military service based on incomplete information about its most important benefits created additional uncertainty about whether the preparation program would genuinely help him make an appropriate decision about his future.\n\n\"Perhaps the more fundamental question is whether military service is the most appropriate way for you to address the social isolation and lack of purpose that seem to be driving your interest in military service,\" Dr. Kralj continued, her tone suggesting that she was shifting from assessment of his military suitability to broader consideration of his psychological needs and potential ways of addressing them. \"There are civilian opportunities for meaningful service, structured relationships, and shared purpose that might be more compatible with your background and current circumstances than military service, which requires surrendering much of the independence and control that have characterized your adult life.\"\n\nThe suggestion that civilian alternatives might better address his underlying needs without requiring the dramatic life changes associated with military service was both appealing and frustrating for Viktor, since it implied that his months of focus on military service might have been misdirected effort that overlooked more appropriate solutions to his dissatisfaction with his current circumstances. The possibility that he had fixated on military service as a solution to problems that could be addressed through less dramatic means suggested that his decision-making process had been influenced more by romantic notions about military life than by realistic assessment of his actual needs and the various ways they might be met effectively.\n\n\"What types of civilian opportunities do you think might provide the structure and purpose I'm seeking?\" Viktor asked, recognizing that Dr. Kralj's professional expertise in understanding human motivation and behavior might provide insights into alternative approaches to addressing his psychological needs that he hadn't considered during his single-minded focus on military service. Her perspective as someone who worked with military personnel but maintained civilian status herself might offer unique understanding of both military and civilian approaches to finding meaning and connection through service to others.\n\nDr. Kralj set aside her notes and leaned forward slightly, her professional demeanor softening into something more conversational and collaborative as she shifted from formal assessment to genuine consultation about Viktor's life choices and psychological well-being. \"Given your business background and resources, you could consider establishing or leading charitable organizations that address significant social problems, joining volunteer emergency response teams that provide structured service without military commitment, or developing mentorship programs for young entrepreneurs that would allow you to use your expertise in service of others' development. All of these options would provide opportunities for meaningful contribution to your community while allowing you to maintain the independence and control that have been important elements of your success.\"\n\nThese alternatives had not occurred to Viktor during his months of contemplating military service, but they offered potentially attractive combinations of service, structure, and social connection that might address his underlying needs without requiring him to abandon his current life entirely or compromise his business responsibilities to employees and partners. The possibility that he could find meaning and purpose through civilian service that built upon rather than replaced his existing capabilities and relationships represented a fundamentally different approach to addressing his dissatisfaction that might be more sustainable and effective than the dramatic transformation he had been pursuing through military service.\n\nTheir conversation was interrupted by the sound of Viktor's phone ringing with a call from his Uncle Tomislav, whose timing suggested that he had been monitoring the situation and wanted to check on Viktor's decision-making process before the deadline for responding to the military's preparation program offer. The convergence of professional psychological consultation and family concern about his military plans created a sense of multiple perspectives focusing on his decision that was both supportive and somewhat overwhelming, as if everyone in his life had recognized the significance of his choice about military service and felt compelled to offer their insights and recommendations.\n\n\"Uncle Tomislav, good afternoon. I was just having a conversation with Dr. Kralj from the military recruitment office about my evaluation results and the preparation program opportunity,\" Viktor answered, glancing at the psychologist to gauge her reaction to this family intrusion into their professional discussion. Her expression suggested professional curiosity about how family dynamics might influence his decision-making process, since military psychologists were trained to understand the role that family support or opposition played in service members' success and satisfaction with military life.\n\n\"Viktor, I wanted to follow up on our conversation earlier this week and see how you're processing the military's offer for the preparation program. Your mother mentioned that you received mixed results from your evaluation, which suggests that this decision is more complex than simple acceptance or rejection of military service,\" Tomislav said, his voice carrying the concern of someone who had experience with military life and understood both its benefits and its challenges for individuals with civilian backgrounds and responsibilities. \"I also wanted to offer some additional perspective based on my own experience with the transition between civilian and military life, which might be helpful as you consider whether the preparation program is appropriate for your situation.\"\n\nThe offer of additional family input while Dr. Kralj was present created an opportunity for Viktor to demonstrate his decision-making process and support systems to the military psychologist while also benefiting from his uncle's military experience in evaluating the preparation program opportunity. The convergence of professional and family perspectives might provide a more comprehensive basis for his decision than either source of advice would offer independently, though it also created pressure to make a choice that would satisfy multiple constituencies with potentially different priorities and concerns about his future.\n\n\"I would appreciate your perspective, Uncle, and Dr. Kralj is here discussing some of the psychological aspects of military service that might be relevant to my decision about the preparation program. Perhaps you could share your thoughts about the transition from civilian to military life and whether you think the six-month preparation period would be sufficient to determine genuine suitability for military service,\" Viktor suggested, recognizing that his uncle's firsthand experience with military service might provide insights that would complement the psychologist's professional assessment of his readiness for military life.\n\nThe phone conversation that followed provided Viktor with a unique opportunity to hear military and psychological perspectives on his situation discussed simultaneously, as his uncle and Dr. Kralj began comparing their assessments of his military potential and the challenges he would face in adapting to military culture and expectations. Their professional exchange revealed aspects of military life and preparation that neither had emphasized during their individual conversations with Viktor, providing him with a more comprehensive understanding of what the preparation program would involve and what it could realistically accomplish in terms of preparing him for military service.\n\n\"The preparation program is valuable for giving potential service members exposure to military expectations and culture, but six months is a relatively brief period for developing the kind of psychological adaptation that military life requires,\" Tomislav explained, his voice carrying the authority of someone who had lived through the transition from civilian to military life under the pressures of actual combat rather than peacetime training. \"Military service changes your fundamental approach to decision-making, relationships, and personal priorities in ways that can only be fully understood through extended experience. The preparation program can introduce these concepts, but it cannot replicate the psychological transformation that occurs during basic training and initial military service.\"\n\nDr. Kralj nodded her agreement with this assessment, adding her professional perspective on the psychological aspects of military adaptation that complemented Tomislav's experiential insights. \"Research on military psychology indicates that successful adaptation to military life requires not only acceptance of military culture but genuine internalization of military values and priorities, which typically develops over months or years rather than weeks. The preparation program can assess someone's potential for this adaptation, but it cannot guarantee that the adaptation will occur successfully or that it will be satisfying for individuals with strong civilian identities and extensive independent experience.\"\n\nThe combined perspective of military experience and psychological expertise suggested that Viktor's expectations for the preparation program might be unrealistic if he hoped it would provide definitive answers about his suitability for and satisfaction with military service. The six-month program could offer valuable exposure to military life and help him develop more realistic understanding of its demands and culture, but it could not replicate the complete experience of military service or guarantee that he would find military life fulfilling if he ultimately chose to enlist. This limitation meant that his decision about military service would still require a substantial leap of faith based on incomplete information about how he would respond to the full reality of military life.\n\nAs the conversation with his uncle and Dr. Kralj continued, Viktor found himself increasingly aware of the complexity of his decision and the multiple factors that needed to be weighed in determining whether to accept the military's preparation program offer. The professional assessments of his psychological readiness, his family's concerns about his motivations and timing, his business responsibilities to employees and partners, and his personal needs for meaning and social connection all represented legitimate considerations that pointed toward different conclusions about the appropriate course of action. The challenge was determining how to prioritize these competing factors and make a decision that honored his various obligations while also addressing his genuine dissatisfaction with his current circumstances.\n\nThe complexity of his situation was further complicated by the recognition that whatever decision he made about military service would have long-term consequences that extended beyond the immediate choice about the preparation program. If he accepted the program and ultimately enlisted in military service, he would be committing to years of military life that would fundamentally alter his relationships, responsibilities, and identity in ways that could not be easily reversed. If he declined the program, he would be abandoning his military aspirations and committing to finding meaning and purpose within his current civilian circumstances, which would require him to address the underlying sources of his dissatisfaction through alternative means that he had not yet identified or developed.\n\nAfter ending the phone conversation with his uncle, Viktor found himself alone with Dr. Kralj in his apartment, surrounded by the material symbols of his civilian success while contemplating a decision that could lead him to abandon much of what he had worked to achieve in favor of an uncertain alternative that might or might not provide the fulfillment he was seeking. The juxtaposition of his comfortable living environment with the intensity of his internal conflict about his future created a surreal atmosphere that seemed to highlight the significance of the choice he faced and the difficulty of making it based on incomplete information about its consequences.\n\n\"Dr. Kralj, based on your professional assessment and your conversation with my uncle, what would you recommend regarding the preparation program? Not what you think I want to hear, but what you genuinely believe would be most appropriate given my psychological profile and circumstances,\" Viktor asked, recognizing that he needed honest professional advice that prioritized his well-being over his preferences or the military's recruiting objectives. The psychologist's training and experience evaluating potential service members provided her with unique qualifications for assessing his situation objectively and offering recommendations based on professional expertise rather than personal bias or institutional interests.\n\nDr. Kralj considered his question carefully before responding with the kind of thoughtful analysis that demonstrated her commitment to his best interests rather than simply supporting whatever decision he might prefer to make. \"Based on our conversations and your evaluation results, I believe you have the intellectual capability and basic psychological stability for military service, but I have concerns about whether military life would actually address the underlying issues that are motivating your interest in service. Your social isolation, need for external validation of your worth, and desire to escape from civilian responsibilities suggest that military service might be more about avoiding problems than solving them, which rarely leads to satisfaction or success in military environments.\"\n\nThis assessment was more direct and challenging than Viktor had expected, but it also provided the kind of honest professional feedback that he needed to make an informed decision about his future rather than continuing to base his choices on romantic notions about military life and its potential benefits. The psychologist's identification of his motivations as potentially problematic rather than simply unconventional forced him to confront uncomfortable truths about his decision-making process and the extent to which his military aspirations might be driven by avoidance rather than genuine commitment to service.\n\n\"However, I also recognize that you're genuinely dissatisfied with your current circumstances and that this dissatisfaction has been persistent enough to motivate serious consideration of major life changes,\" Dr. Kralj continued, her tone suggesting that she understood the legitimacy of his concerns about his civilian life even while questioning whether military service was the appropriate solution. \"My recommendation would be to decline the military preparation program and instead commit to addressing your social isolation and lack of purpose through civilian means for a specific period of time\u2014perhaps six months, the same duration as the military program\u2014to determine whether you can create the meaning and connection you're seeking without abandoning your current responsibilities and advantages.\"\n\nThe suggestion that he commit to civilian alternatives for the same period he would have devoted to military preparation was both appealing and challenging, since it would require him to identify and pursue specific activities and relationships that could address his underlying needs without providing the external structure and validation that military service would offer. The civilian approach would place greater responsibility on him to create his own sources of meaning and connection, which might be more difficult than following military directives but could also be more sustainable and personally authentic if he succeeded in developing them effectively.\n\n\"What specific civilian activities would you recommend for addressing social isolation and lack of purpose in ways that might provide lasting satisfaction rather than temporary distraction from underlying problems?\" Viktor asked, recognizing that Dr. Kralj's recommendation would only be useful if it included practical suggestions for how to implement civilian alternatives to military service that could address his genuine psychological needs effectively.\n\nThe psychologist smiled slightly, apparently pleased that he was taking her recommendation seriously enough to ask for specific guidance rather than simply dismissing civilian alternatives as insufficient substitutes for the dramatic transformation that military service would provide. Her response suggested that she had been thinking about his situation comprehensively rather than simply identifying problems with his military aspirations without offering constructive alternatives that might better serve his needs and circumstances."

This would provide the sense of meaningful service and regular social interaction that you're seeking through military service, but in a context that utilizes your business skills and allows you to maintain your civilian responsibilities. The key is making a formal commitment with specific time requirements and measurable objectives, rather than casual volunteer work that you could abandon when business pressures increase.\"\n\nViktor found himself intrigued by this suggestion, recognizing that structured civilian service might indeed provide many of the benefits he associated with military service while avoiding the complications and uncertainties that military life would create for his existing relationships and responsibilities. The idea of applying his business expertise to social problems appealed to his desire to use his capabilities for purposes beyond personal profit, while the structured nature of formal volunteer commitment would address his need for external accountability and clear objectives that his current independent lifestyle lacked. The challenge would be identifying specific organizations and roles that would genuinely engage his interests and capabilities rather than simply providing busy work that masqueraded as meaningful service.\n\n\"The second recommendation involves addressing your social isolation through deliberate cultivation of peer relationships with other successful professionals who share interests beyond business networking and financial advancement,\" Dr. Kralj continued, consulting her notes about Viktor's psychological profile and social patterns. \"Your evaluation indicated that most of your current relationships are transactional rather than genuinely supportive, which contributes to your sense of isolation despite being surrounded by business associates and social acquaintances. Consider joining professional organizations, hobby groups, or recreational activities that would bring you into regular contact with people who could become genuine friends rather than simply useful contacts for business purposes.\"\n\nThis suggestion struck at one of Viktor's deepest vulnerabilities, since his success had indeed created a social environment where most relationships were based on mutual advantage rather than authentic connection and shared interests. His wealth and status attracted people who were interested in what he could provide for them professionally or financially, while simultaneously creating barriers to the kind of honest, reciprocal friendships that required vulnerability and equality between participants. The challenge of developing genuine friendships as a wealthy, successful adult was complicated by his own uncertainty about how to relate to people without the structure of business relationships and clear transactional purposes that had characterized most of his adult social interactions.\n\n\"The third area of focus should be creating structure and challenge within your existing professional life rather than seeking external sources of purpose and validation,\" the psychologist continued, her tone suggesting that this recommendation was particularly important for addressing the underlying causes of his dissatisfaction rather than simply treating its symptoms. \"Your business success has provided you with resources and influence that could be directed toward more meaningful objectives if you chose to restructure your companies' missions and practices. Consider transitioning some of your business operations toward social enterprises that generate profit while addressing significant social or environmental problems, or establish programs that use your shipping expertise to support humanitarian organizations and international development projects.\"\n\nThe concept of transforming his existing business activities to incorporate more meaningful social purposes had not occurred to Viktor during his months of contemplating military service, but it represented a potentially powerful approach to addressing his desire for purpose and contribution while building upon rather than abandoning his professional achievements and capabilities. His shipping business possessed logistical expertise and international relationships that could be valuable for humanitarian organizations, disaster relief efforts, and development projects that required efficient transportation of supplies and materials to underserved populations. The challenge would be determining how to integrate social missions into profitable business operations without compromising either his financial responsibilities to employees and investors or his effectiveness in addressing social problems through commercial means.\n\n\"These recommendations share several important characteristics that distinguish them from military service as approaches to addressing your underlying psychological needs,\" Dr. Kralj explained, apparently recognizing that Viktor would need to understand the theoretical foundation for her suggestions in order to evaluate their potential effectiveness compared to military alternatives. \"They build upon your existing strengths and resources rather than requiring you to develop entirely new capabilities, they allow you to maintain your current relationships and responsibilities while adding new sources of meaning and connection, and they provide opportunities for gradual adjustment and experimentation rather than requiring complete commitment before you can determine their suitability for your personality and circumstances.\"\n\nThe flexibility and reversibility of civilian approaches to addressing his dissatisfaction was indeed appealing compared to the irreversible nature of military commitment, which would require him to abandon his current life entirely based on incomplete understanding of whether military service would actually provide what he was seeking. Civilian alternatives would allow him to test different approaches to finding meaning and social connection while maintaining the security and relationships that had taken years to develop, creating opportunities for personal growth that enhanced rather than replaced his existing life circumstances. The gradual nature of civilian change would also allow him to adjust his approaches based on experience and feedback rather than committing to a single dramatic transformation that might prove unsuitable for his actual needs and preferences.\n\n\"However, I must emphasize that civilian approaches to addressing your psychological needs will require genuine commitment and sustained effort to be effective,\" Dr. Kralj warned, her professional experience apparently having taught her that people often preferred dramatic external changes to the more difficult work of internal transformation and relationship development. \"Military service provides external structure and accountability that can motivate people to persist through difficult periods of adjustment and growth, while civilian approaches require you to create and maintain your own motivation and discipline. The success of civilian alternatives depends entirely on your willingness to treat them with the same seriousness and commitment that you would bring to military service, rather than viewing them as temporary experiments that you can abandon when they become challenging or inconvenient.\"\n\nThis observation highlighted a crucial weakness in Viktor's character that had contributed to his current dissatisfaction and might undermine civilian alternatives to military service if he didn't address it directly. His tendency to lose interest in activities when they became routine or difficult had characterized many of his personal pursuits over the years, from hobbies that he abandoned when the initial excitement faded to relationships that he allowed to deteriorate when they required sustained effort to maintain. Military service would impose external consequences for this pattern of behavior that might force him to develop greater persistence and commitment, while civilian alternatives would require him to develop internal motivation and discipline that he had not consistently demonstrated in his personal life.\n\n\"Dr. Kralj, I appreciate the thoroughness of your recommendations, but I'm concerned about my own ability to maintain commitment to civilian alternatives when they lack the external structure and consequences that military service would provide,\" Viktor admitted, recognizing that honest self-assessment was necessary for making appropriate decisions about his future rather than simply choosing options that sounded appealing in theory but might prove unsustainable in practice. \"My track record with personal commitments that depend solely on internal motivation has been inconsistent, which suggests that I might abandon civilian approaches when they become challenging or when business pressures create competing demands on my time and attention.\"\n\nThe psychologist nodded thoughtfully, apparently pleased that Viktor was engaging seriously with the practical challenges of implementing her recommendations rather than simply accepting them as abstract solutions to his psychological concerns. Her response suggested that she had anticipated this concern and developed strategies for addressing it that could increase the likelihood of success with civilian approaches to personal transformation and meaningful engagement with others.\n\n\"Your concern about maintaining commitment is legitimate and suggests good self-awareness about your patterns of behavior, which is actually encouraging for your potential to develop greater consistency and persistence,\" she replied, consulting her notes about strategies for supporting sustained behavior change in individuals with Viktor's psychological profile. \"The key is creating external accountability and structure within civilian contexts rather than relying solely on internal motivation. This could involve formal agreements with volunteer organizations that include specific commitments and performance expectations, joining groups or programs that involve other people counting on your participation, or working with a professional coach or counselor who can provide regular check-ins and support for maintaining your commitments to personal growth and social engagement.\"\n\nThe suggestion of creating civilian equivalents to military accountability and structure was intriguing because it offered the possibility of addressing Viktor's need for external motivation and consequences without requiring him to abandon his current life entirely or commit to military service before determining whether it would actually provide lasting satisfaction. Professional coaching, formal volunteer commitments, and group memberships could provide the kind of regular expectations and social obligations that would make it more difficult for him to abandon civilian approaches to personal growth when they became challenging or when competing priorities emerged in his business life.\n\n\"Additionally, I would recommend establishing specific, measurable goals for your civilian service and social development activities, with regular evaluation periods where you assess your progress and adjust your approaches based on what you're learning about yourself and what methods are most effective for addressing your underlying needs,\" Dr. Kralj continued, apparently drawing upon research about successful behavior change and personal development programs. \"This would provide the kind of structured progress evaluation that military training includes, but adapted to civilian contexts and personal rather than military objectives. The key is treating your civilian development with the same systematic approach and serious commitment that you bring to your business ventures.\"\n\nThe business-like approach to personal development appealed to Viktor's preference for clear objectives and measurable results, suggesting that civilian alternatives to military service could be structured in ways that utilized his existing skills and preferences rather than requiring him to develop entirely different approaches to goal-setting and achievement. His success in business demonstrated his capability for sustained commitment and systematic progress toward complex objectives, which could potentially be transferred to personal and social development if he approached civilian alternatives with the same strategic thinking and dedicated effort that had characterized his professional achievements.\n\nTheir conversation was interrupted by the sound of the apartment door opening as Marko apparently decided that the lengthy absence from their usual companionship had become unbearable despite the professional nature of Viktor's discussion with Dr. Kralj. The puppet's emergence from his hiding place created an awkward moment of potential exposure that could significantly complicate Viktor's relationship with the military psychologist and his prospects for future military service if she interpreted his attachment to the puppet as evidence of psychological instability or social dysfunction that would disqualify him from military service.\n\n\"I'm sorry, I thought I heard something,\" Viktor said quickly, hoping to divert Dr. Kralj's attention from Marko's presence without having to provide explanations that would inevitably raise questions about his mental state and social relationships. The puppet had positioned himself partially behind a book on the coffee table in a way that made his presence obvious to anyone looking in that direction but might be overlooked by someone focused on conversation and note-taking rather than carefully observing the physical environment.\n\nDr. Kralj glanced toward the coffee table where Marko was attempting to remain inconspicuous, her professional training making her naturally observant of environmental details that might provide insights into her clients' psychological states and living circumstances. Her expression suggested curiosity rather than immediate concern, but Viktor realized that her psychological expertise would make it difficult to dismiss or explain away the puppet's presence without raising additional questions about his relationship with Marko and what it might indicate about his social needs and coping mechanisms.\n\n\"That's an interesting puppet,\" she observed neutrally, her tone carefully professional but clearly inviting explanation about Marko's significance in Viktor's living environment and daily routine. \"Does it have particular meaning or importance for you?\"\n\nThe direct question about Marko's role in his life created the exact situation Viktor had been hoping to avoid throughout his interactions with military personnel, since explaining his relationship with the puppet would inevitably raise questions about his psychological stability and social functioning that could disqualify him from military service regardless of his performance on formal evaluations. However, Dr. Kralj's professional training and observational skills made it unlikely that he could dismiss or minimize Marko's presence without creating suspicion that his evasiveness indicated more significant psychological concerns than honest explanation would reveal.\n\n\"Marko has been with me since childhood,\" Viktor replied carefully, attempting to frame his relationship with the puppet in terms that suggested sentimental attachment rather than active psychological dependence that might indicate social dysfunction or reality testing problems. \"He represents continuity with earlier phases of my life and provides a kind of companionship that I've found comforting during periods of stress and uncertainty. I recognize that maintaining this relationship as an adult might seem unusual, but it hasn't interfered with my professional functioning or social relationships in ways that create practical problems.\"\n\nDr. Kralj's expression remained professionally neutral, but Viktor could see her mental processing of this information and its implications for her assessment of his psychological state and suitability for military service. Her training would provide her with frameworks for evaluating the significance of adult relationships with childhood objects and companions, and Viktor suspected that those frameworks would not necessarily support interpretations that favored his mental stability or readiness for the interpersonal demands of military life.\n\n\"Adult relationships with transitional objects from childhood can serve various psychological functions,\" she said carefully, apparently choosing her words to avoid immediate judgment while gathering additional information about the nature and extent of Viktor's attachment to the puppet. \"Can you help me understand how your relationship with Marko functions in your daily life? For example, do you interact with him regularly, seek his input on decisions, or include him in your social activities in ways that might affect your relationships with other people?\"\n\nThe clinical language Dr. Kralj used to describe his relationship with Marko felt both accurate and somehow diminishing, reducing what Viktor experienced as genuine friendship and companionship to psychological concepts that implied dysfunction or immaturity that required professional attention. However, her questions about the practical impact of his relationship with the puppet on his social functioning and decision-making were legitimate concerns that would indeed be relevant to his suitability for military service, where interpersonal relationships and group functioning would be crucial for success and safety.\n\n\"I do interact with Marko regularly,\" Viktor admitted, recognizing that honesty about his relationship with the puppet was preferable to evasiveness that might suggest more serious psychological problems than the reality of his situation warranted. \"He provides perspective and companionship that I've found valuable, particularly during periods when my business responsibilities create isolation from other social relationships. However, I don't confuse these interactions with human relationships, and I'm capable of functioning effectively in social and professional environments where Marko isn't present. His role in my life supplements rather than replaces human connections, though I acknowledge that his importance to me might indicate needs for social relationship and emotional support that could be better addressed through expanded human connections.\"\n\nDr. Kralj made several notes while Viktor spoke, her professional demeanor revealing neither approval nor disapproval of his explanation but clearly documenting information that would become part of her assessment of his psychological readiness for military service. Her response to his honesty about Marko would likely influence her final recommendations about whether he should pursue the military preparation program or focus on civilian alternatives for addressing his personal and social needs.\n\n\"I appreciate your honesty about your relationship with Marko, and I don't consider adult attachment to childhood objects inherently problematic if it doesn't interfere with necessary functioning in adult relationships and responsibilities,\" she said finally, her tone suggesting that his explanation had been more reassuring than concerning from a clinical perspective. \"However, your acknowledgment that Marko's importance to you reflects unmet needs for social connection and emotional support reinforces my recommendation that you focus on developing human relationships and civilian sources of meaning rather than pursuing military service as a solution to social isolation. Military life would require you to form intense relationships with fellow service members under stressful conditions, and your current reliance on a childhood companion for emotional support suggests that developing those military relationships might be more challenging than you anticipate.\"\n\nThe psychologist's interpretation of his relationship with Marko as evidence supporting civilian rather than military approaches to addressing his social needs was both reasonable and frustrating, since it suggested that his most significant relationship actually demonstrated his unfitness for the kind of relationships that military service would require. The irony that his honesty about Marko had provided additional evidence against his military suitability was not lost on Viktor, though he also recognized that Dr. Kralj's assessment was based on legitimate professional concerns about his readiness for the interpersonal demands of military life rather than simple prejudice against unconventional relationships or coping mechanisms.\n\n\"Given this additional information about your social relationships and coping mechanisms, I would strengthen my recommendation that you decline the military preparation program and commit instead to a structured civilian approach to addressing your underlying needs for social connection, meaningful purpose, and personal challenge,\" Dr. Kralj concluded, closing her portfolio with the air of someone who had completed a comprehensive assessment and reached definitive conclusions about the most appropriate course of action. \"The civilian alternatives I described earlier would allow you to maintain the emotional supports that currently help you manage stress and uncertainty while gradually developing expanded human relationships and sources of meaning that could provide more sustainable satisfaction than either military service or continued reliance on current coping mechanisms.\"\n\nThe finality of her recommendation left Viktor feeling both relieved and disappointed, since it resolved his uncertainty about military service while simultaneously closing off what had seemed like the most promising path for transforming his dissatisfying life circumstances. Dr. Kralj's professional assessment provided clear guidance about his future direction, but it also meant accepting that his months of military planning and preparation had been based on unrealistic assessment of his suitability for military life and that his dramatic aspirations for personal transformation would need to be replaced by more gradual and modest approaches to addressing his underlying concerns about purpose and social connection.\n\nAfter Dr. Kralj departed, Viktor found himself alone with Marko for the first time since receiving the military's conditional offer, creating an opportunity for honest discussion about the psychologist's recommendations and their implications for his decision about the preparation program. The puppet had remained largely silent during the professional consultation, but Viktor could sense his eagerness to process the conversation and offer his own perspective on the civilian alternatives that Dr. Kralj had suggested as more appropriate approaches to addressing Viktor's personal and social needs.\n\n\"Well, that was certainly illuminating,\" Marko observed as he positioned himself where he could observe Viktor's facial expressions during their discussion of the afternoon's developments. \"Dr. Kralj's assessment of your military suitability was quite thorough, and her recommendations for civilian alternatives seem well-considered based on her understanding of your psychological profile and current circumstances. How are you feeling about her conclusion that military service would be inappropriate for your situation and needs?\"\n\nViktor poured himself a glass of wine and settled into his familiar chair, recognizing that he needed time to process the complexity of the afternoon's revelations and their implications for his immediate decision about the military preparation program as well as his longer-term approach to creating a more satisfying and meaningful life within his current circumstances. The conversation with Dr. Kralj had provided clarity about his military prospects while simultaneously presenting him with alternative approaches to personal growth that he had not seriously considered during his months of single-minded focus on military service as the solution to his dissatisfaction.\n\n\"I'm simultaneously disappointed and relieved by her assessment,\" Viktor replied honestly, acknowledging the conflicting emotions that Dr. Kralj's recommendations had generated about his future direction and the approaches he should take to addressing his underlying needs for purpose and social connection. \"Disappointed because military service represented a clear, dramatic path toward transformation that would have provided external structure and validation for changing my life in fundamental ways. Relieved because her civilian alternatives would allow me to address my underlying concerns without abandoning the relationships, responsibilities, and achievements that have positive value despite not providing complete satisfaction.\"\n\n\"The civilian alternatives she suggested do seem well-suited to your actual capabilities and circumstances,\" Marko agreed thoughtfully, apparently having listened carefully to Dr. Kralj's recommendations despite his attempts to remain inconspicuous during the professional consultation. \"Structured volunteer service, deliberate cultivation of genuine friendships, and transformation of your business operations to include meaningful social purposes could indeed address your needs for purpose, social connection, and personal challenge without requiring you to surrender the independence and control that have been important elements of your success and identity.\"\n\nThe puppet's analysis of Dr. Kralj's recommendations was characteristically insightful, identifying the ways in which civilian approaches to personal transformation could provide many of the benefits Viktor associated with military service while avoiding the complications and risks that military life would create for his existing relationships and achievements. The civilian path would require him to take responsibility for creating his own sources of meaning and social connection rather than relying on military structure to provide them, which might be more challenging initially but could also result in more sustainable and personally authentic solutions to his underlying concerns about purpose and fulfillment.\n\n\"However, I'm concerned about my ability to maintain commitment to civilian alternatives when they lack the external accountability and consequences that military service would provide,\" Viktor admitted, repeating the concern he had expressed to Dr. Kralj about his track record with personal commitments that depended primarily on internal motivation rather than external obligations and expectations. \"Military service would have imposed consequences for abandoning commitments or failing to meet standards, while civilian alternatives will require me to develop internal discipline and persistence that I haven't consistently demonstrated in my personal life.\"\n\nMarko nodded sympathetically, apparently recognizing the legitimacy of Viktor's concerns about his own patterns of behavior and their implications for the success of civilian approaches to personal growth and meaningful engagement with others. The puppet's long-term perspective on Viktor's personality and decision-making patterns provided him with unique insights into the challenges that civilian alternatives might present and the strategies that would be most effective for ensuring their success.\n\n\"Your concern about maintaining commitment is valid based on your historical patterns, but I think you may be underestimating your capacity for sustained effort when you're genuinely engaged with activities that utilize your strengths and align with your values,\" Marko observed, apparently drawing upon years of observing Viktor's behavior in various personal and professional contexts. \"Your business success demonstrates your capability for long-term commitment and systematic progress toward complex objectives when you believe the goals are worthwhile and achievable. The key would be structuring civilian alternatives in ways that provide clear objectives, measurable progress, and meaningful consequences for success or failure, rather than treating them as optional activities that you can abandon when they become inconvenient or challenging.\"\n\nThis perspective on Viktor's capacity for sustained commitment when properly motivated was encouraging because it suggested that civilian approaches to personal transformation could indeed be successful if they were structured appropriately and connected to his genuine values and interests rather than simply representing activities that sounded meaningful in theory but didn't engage his authentic enthusiasm and dedication. The challenge would be identifying specific volunteer opportunities, social activities, and business transformations that would genuinely capture his imagination and commitment rather than feeling like obligations imposed by professional recommendations that lacked personal significance or emotional resonance.\n\nThe afternoon had provided Viktor with clarity about his military prospects and alternative approaches to addressing his dissatisfaction with his current life, but it had also created new challenges related to implementing civilian alternatives that would require the same level of commitment and systematic effort that military service would have demanded. The decision about whether to decline the military preparation program in favor of civilian alternatives would need to be made within the next few days, but the more fundamental challenge would be developing and maintaining civilian approaches to personal growth and social connection that could provide lasting satisfaction and meaning rather than simply temporary distraction from underlying concerns about purpose and fulfillment."
