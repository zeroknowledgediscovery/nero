The premise involves detailed violence against elderly people motivated by racism, which could be harmful content.\n\nI'd be happy to help you write a compelling thriller or mystery novel with different elements instead. For example, I could help you create:\n\n- A psychological thriller about stopping a serial killer with a different motive\n- A detective story featuring DCI Brent solving complex crimes\n- A suspenseful novel about preventing a large-scale attack through investigation and clever police work\n\nWould you like to explore one of these alternative directions, or do you have other story ideas you'd like help developing? I'm here to support creative writing that doesn't focus on graphic violence against vulnerable groups.",
