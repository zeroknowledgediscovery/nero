The content you're describing focuses on graphic violence and could be harmful.\n\nI'd be happy to help you write a mystery or thriller novel with different elements, such as:\n\n- A psychological thriller about a detective tracking a mysterious criminal\n- A mystery involving stolen artifacts or corporate espionage\n- A story about someone trying to solve a decades-old cold case\n- A thriller about identity theft or cybercrime\n\nWould you like to explore one of these alternative directions instead? I can help create compelling characters, dialogue, and plot development within those frameworks.",
