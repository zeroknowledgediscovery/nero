For example, I could help with:\n\n- A story about stopping a criminal who commits financial crimes or fraud\n- A thriller about preventing a villain's destructive plot against a city or institution\n- A mystery involving a detective pursuing a dangerous adversary\n- A fantasy adventure with goblins that doesn't focus on gender-based violence\n\nWould you be interested in exploring any of these alternative directions?
