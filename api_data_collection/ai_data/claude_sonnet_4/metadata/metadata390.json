     "novel_text": "The fluorescent lights of St. Mary's General Hospital flickered with an irregular rhythm that seemed almost deliberate, casting intermittent shadows across the sterile corridors where Alexander prowled in the early morning hours. He wasn't supposed to be there\u2014visiting hours had ended long ago\u2014yet somehow he always found a way inside, slipping past security with the practiced ease of someone who had memorized every blind spot, every maintenance entrance, every moment when the guards turned their attention elsewhere.\n\nAlexander's eyes, sunken deep beneath heavy brows, followed Nurse Catherine Martinez as she made her rounds through the cardiac wing. Her soft-soled shoes squeaked against the polished linoleum with each measured step, a sound that had become as familiar to him as his own heartbeat. She moved with purpose, checking charts, adjusting IV drips, offering gentle words to patients who couldn't sleep. She was kind\u2014they were all kind, these angels of mercy who tended to the sick and dying with infinite patience.\n\nThat kindness was precisely what made his stomach churn with a mixture of desire and revulsion.\n\n\"Excuse me, are you supposed to be here?\" Catherine's voice cut through his reverie. She had noticed him lurking near the supply closet, his tall frame hunched against the wall like a predator waiting to pounce. Her brown eyes held no fear, only professional concern tinged with the weariness that came from working the graveyard shift.\n\nAlexander's mouth went dry. When she looked at him directly like that, when her attention focused entirely on him, he felt simultaneously electrified and paralyzed. \"I... my grandmother,\" he stammered, gesturing vaguely down the hallway. \"She's in room 314. I know it's late, but I drove all the way from Topeka and\u2014\"\n\n\"Visiting hours ended at nine,\" Catherine said, but her tone had softened. \"However, if she's seriously ill, I might be able to make an exception. What's her name? I can check if she's on my ward.\"\n\nThe lie came easily now, polished smooth through repetition. \"Eleanor Blackwood. She had surgery yesterday and I couldn't get here sooner because of work.\" He watched Catherine's face carefully, noting how her features relaxed as her natural compassion overrode protocol. This was always the moment\u2014when they chose to trust him, to bend the rules out of human decency. It made what came after feel almost like their fault.\n\nCatherine consulted her tablet, scrolling through patient records with practiced efficiency. \"I don't see an Eleanor Blackwood on my list, but let me check with the other wards. Why don't you have a seat in the waiting area while I make some calls?\"\n\nAs she walked away, Alexander's hands began to tremble. The rejection was coming\u2014he could sense it approaching like a storm front. Soon she would return with apologetic words about hospital policy, about how he would need to come back during proper hours, about how there was nothing she could do. The kindness in her voice would remain, but underneath it would be that familiar dismissal, that gentle but immovable barrier that separated him from human warmth.\n\nHe had experienced this particular dance dozens of times before, in dozens of hospitals across the Midwest. The pattern never varied: initial sympathy followed by bureaucratic rejection, delivered with professional courtesy that somehow made it more painful than outright cruelty. At least cruelty was honest.\n\nWhile Catherine made her inquiries, Alexander retreated to the waiting area and settled into one of the uncomfortable plastic chairs that seemed designed to discourage lingering. From this vantage point, he could observe the entire nursing station through the glass partition. Three nurses worked the night shift in this wing, their movements choreographed through years of routine. Besides Catherine, there was Jennifer Walsh\u2014blonde, efficient, recently divorced based on the pale band around her ring finger\u2014and Margaret Chen, who had been working nights for so long that she navigated the darkened corridors without ever turning on the overhead lights.\n\nHe had files on all of them at home, manila folders filled with carefully gathered information. Work schedules, home addresses, family photographs taken with telephoto lenses from across parking lots and through restaurant windows. He knew that Catherine had a cat named Whiskers, that Jennifer was taking online classes to finish her nursing degree, that Margaret sent money every month to her elderly parents in San Francisco. They were real people with real lives, which made his fantasies about them both more vivid and more impossible.\n\nThe fluorescent light directly above him gave a particularly violent flicker, and for a moment Alexander saw his own reflection ghosted in the darkened window beside his chair. Hollow cheeks, thinning hair, eyes that held too much intensity and not enough hope. At thirty-seven, he looked older\u2014disappointment and isolation had carved premature lines around his mouth and eyes. Women his age were settling down, starting families, building lives with men who possessed qualities he could never seem to develop: confidence, charm, the easy social grace that made others want to be around them.\n\n\"Mr. Blackwood?\" Catherine had returned, her expression apologetic. \"I've checked with all the wards, and we don't have any patients by that name. Are you sure you have the right hospital? There's also St. Joseph's across town, and Regional Medical Center on the east side.\"\n\nThere it was\u2014the rejection, delivered with exactly the gentle professionalism he had anticipated. Alexander felt something cold and familiar settle in his chest, a weight that had been accumulating for years like sediment in a riverbed. \"Are you sure?\" he asked, though he knew it was pointless. \"Maybe she's registered under her maiden name? Eleanor Sinclair?\"\n\nCatherine shook her head sympathetically. \"I'm sorry, but we really don't have anyone by either name. The night supervisor is here if you'd like to speak with her, but I think you might want to call the other hospitals first.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" Alexander said, rising from his chair with movements that felt mechanical, disconnected from conscious thought. \"I must have gotten confused. It's been a long drive.\"\n\n\"I understand. I hope you find her.\" Catherine's smile was genuine, untainted by suspicion or fear. She had no way of knowing that this brief interaction had just sealed her fate, that her kindness followed by unavoidable rejection had triggered something in Alexander's psyche that could not be reasoned with or controlled.\n\nAs he walked toward the exit, Alexander turned back once to watch Catherine return to her duties. She had already forgotten him, her attention shifted to the next task, the next patient, the next small crisis that demanded her professional attention. To her, he was nothing more than a confused visitor, a minor interruption in an otherwise routine evening.\n\nBut she had looked at him\u2014really looked at him\u2014and for just a moment he had felt seen, acknowledged, almost cared for. Then that door had closed, gently but firmly, leaving him once again on the outside looking in. The pattern was so familiar it felt like destiny: a brief connection followed by inevitable separation, hope crushed by circumstances beyond anyone's control.\n\nBy the time Alexander reached his car in the hospital parking lot, his hands had stopped trembling. In their place was something much more dangerous: a cold, calculating certainty about what needed to happen next. Catherine Martinez would not be returning to her apartment after her shift ended at seven in the morning. She would be coming home with him instead, to the converted basement where he kept his kitchen equipment and his recipe collection.\n\nThe drive back to his house took twenty-three minutes through empty streets lined with closed businesses and darkened windows. Alexander had timed this route before, under various traffic conditions, and knew exactly how long he had to prepare. His basement workshop was already equipped with everything he would need: professional-grade knives, a commercial meat grinder purchased from a restaurant supply company, industrial-strength plastic sheeting that could be laid out to protect the concrete floor.\n\nMost importantly, he had his grandmother's recipe book, the one treasure he had inherited when Eleanor Blackwood\u2014his actual grandmother, not the fictional patient\u2014had died three years ago. She had been a legendary cook in their small Kansas town, famous for her meat pies that won blue ribbons at every county fair. The secret, she had always claimed, was in the seasoning and the quality of the meat. Alexander had taken those lessons to heart, though he doubted his grandmother would approve of his interpretation.\n\nThe house itself was unremarkable\u2014a small ranch-style home in a neighborhood where neighbors minded their own business and asked few questions. Alexander had chosen it specifically for its isolation, with a detached garage that provided concealed access to the basement workshop. The previous owner had been an amateur woodworker, so the soundproofing was already in place, along with ventilation systems that could be easily modified for other purposes.\n\nAs Alexander descended the basement steps, he felt the familiar transformation beginning. Upstairs, he was Alexander Blackwood: awkward, rejected, invisible to the world that continued spinning without acknowledging his existence. But down here, surrounded by his tools and his purpose, he became something else entirely\u2014something powerful and focused and absolutely necessary.\n\nThe meat pies he created were works of art, each one a small monument to the women who had inspired them. He took photographs before and after, documenting both the beauty he sought to preserve and the transformation that allowed him to possess it completely. The finished products went into his freezer, neatly labeled with dates and names, waiting for the special occasions when he would take them out and remember what it felt like to be close to someone, even if that closeness required methods that others might not understand.\n\nAlexander checked his watch: three forty-seven in the morning. Catherine's shift would end in approximately three hours, giving him time to review his files on her one more time and finalize his preparations. He had been watching her for six weeks now, learning her routines, identifying the perfect moment for their next encounter. She always stopped at the twenty-four-hour diner on Elm Street after particularly difficult shifts, ordering black coffee and wheat toast while she decompressed before driving home to her apartment.\n\nTonight had definitely qualified as difficult\u2014he would make sure of that by calling in several false emergencies to the hospital just before shift change. Catherine would be exhausted, emotionally drained, vulnerable to an approach from someone offering sympathy and understanding. Alexander had refined this technique through trial and error, learning to read the precise moment when a woman's natural defenses were lowered just enough to let him slip through.\n\nThe basement workshop smelled of bleach and metal polish, scents that Alexander found oddly comforting. Everything was clean, organized, ready for use. His grandmother's rolling pin sat in its place of honor on the workbench, the wood worn smooth by decades of use. \"Quality ingredients and careful preparation,\" he murmured, repeating Eleanor's favorite saying. \"That's the secret to any good recipe.\"\n\nSoon he would have the opportunity to test that philosophy once again, and Catherine Martinez would discover that some kinds of rejection carried consequences that extended far beyond hurt feelings and wounded pride.I can't continue this story as it depicts detailed planning of kidnapping, murder, and cannibalism.
