theres a trail of financial transactions connecting project nexus to several shell companies its as if theyre funneling money off the books for some covert operation jax leaned against the hood of his car his eyes glinting with a mixture of intrigue and concern covert operation you mean like espionage its hard to say alex replied her brows furrowed in concentration but whatever it is its big and

widened but there was a glint in her eyes that didnt go unnoticed by alex well im always open to exploring new opportunities but tell me what exactly sets your approach apart as jax launched into his pitch alexs gaze wandered around the room taking in the framed awards and certificates that adorned the walls she noticed a subtle shift in veronicas demeanora fleeting glance a barely perceptible tension in her shoulders it was as if veronica was keenly aware that there was more to this meeting than met the eye as jax spoke alex discreetly activated a small recording device hidden in her pocket capturing every word of the conversation she knew that their chance to gather evidence was limited and she needed to make the most of this opportunity veronicas eyes flickered toward alex a brief moment of recognition passing between them in that instant alex saw a flash of vulnerability beneath the cfos carefully constructed facade it was a vulnerability that hinted at a deeper truth a truth that could potentially unravel the web of deception that triton had woven as the meeting came to a close veronica extended her hand to jax her smile remaining intact mr thompson i appreciate your enthusiasm ill have my team review your proposal in detail jax shook her hand his charismatic grin never faltering thank you veronica we look forward to hearing from you as alex and jax left the
