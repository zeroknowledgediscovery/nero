carried by the wind itself in cell b a man named jack turner sat hunched over a worn wooden desk a dim ray of sunlight filtering through the barred window onto his weathered face he stared at a faded photograph of his family his wife and daughter smiling back at him the photograph was a reminder of what he had lost and what he longed to regain but hope was a dangerous thing in alcatraz a beacon that could either guide one to salvation or drag them deeper into the abyss jacks cellmate frank donovan paced back and forth his restless energy filling the confined space youre crazy jack he muttered his voice a mixture of skepticism and curiosity nobodys ever escaped this place the currents the guards the sharks its a death wish jacks eyes remained fixed on the photograph as he spoke his voice steady with conviction weve been studying the tides frank we know the currents better than the guards do and with the right equipment and a bit of luck we can make it frank stopped his pacing and glanced at jack his skepticism slowly giving way to a glimmer of hope and how do you propose we get the equipment the guards search every corner of this place jack reached into the pocket of his prison uniform and pulled out a small piece of paper on it was a crude map showing the hidden locations of tools and supplies that had been smuggled into the prison over the years there are ways frank we just need to be smart patient and careful as days turned into weeks jack and frank meticulously executed their plan they forged alliances with other inmates gathered supplies and pieced together

flashlight we cant rush this jack whispered his voice carrying the weight of caution we need to wait for the right opportunity frank nodded in agreement his hands shaking with a mixture of fear and anticipation but how do we know when that opportunity will come jack looked towards the barred window the moonlight casting elongated shadows on the cell floor well know he replied a spark of determination in his eyes we just have to stay patient meanwhile another inmate named eddie rat collins watched the events unfold from the shadows rat was known for his ability to gather information and manipulate situations to his advantage he saw the growing tension between the inmates and the guards as an opportunity to secure his own escape rats beady eyes gleamed as he approached jack and frank during a rare moment of recreation time i hear you two are planning something big he hissed a sly grin playing on his lips i could help you know for a price jacks gaze hardened as he assessed

alliance days turned into weeks and the bond between jack frank and rat grew stronger as they continued to plot their daring escape the prison walls seemed to close in on them each cell block corridor becoming a labyrinth of suspicion and danger in the prison library a space where inmates were allowed to read and study jack discovered a weathered book about marine navigation with every stolen moment he pored over its pages learning about the tides currents and the treacherous waters that surrounded alcatraz frank helped him decode the complex language of charts and diagrams their shared determination cementing their partnership rat on the other hand used his cunning to gather valuable intelligence about the guards routines and habits he made connections both genuine and deceitful that gave him insight into the inner workings of the prison his ability to manipulate others became a weapon one he wielded with precision to advance the escape plan one evening as the sun dipped below the horizon casting an orange glow over the prison yard the trio met in the shadows of the exercise area were close rat whispered his eyes gleaming with a mix of excitement and apprehension ive

charge the prison buzzed with a nervous energy inmates practicing their acts and guards preparing for the event jack frank and rat finalized their plans each step a calculated risk that could lead to

suppliesropes tools and other essentials they would need for their escape were almost there rat whispered his voice a mixture of excitement and apprehension just a few more steps they emerged from the
