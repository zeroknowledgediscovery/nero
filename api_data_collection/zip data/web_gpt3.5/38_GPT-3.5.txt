her with longforgotten eyes they entered a grand parlour its walls lined with shelves bearing ancient tomes delicate porcelain figurines and strange trinkets from distant lands a fire crackled in the hearth casting dancing shadows that seemed to flicker with a life of their own the innkeeper gestured for sarah to take a seat in a plush armchair near the fireplace please make yourself comfortable

spine in the midst of the melody sarah began to hear whispers faint voices that seemed to speak from the shadows she strained to make out the words feeling a mixture of awe and trepidation the voices spoke of love lost of regrets that lingered like specters and of the inn itself a silent witness to the passage of time as the melody swelled to a crescendo sarahs heart raced the whispers grew louder

exploring a forgotten attic dust motes danced in the dim light as she browsed through old trunks filled with letters photographs and relics of eras gone by she picked up a faded photograph the faces of its subjects frozen in timea young couple their smiles a testament to their happiness the innkeepers voice startled her from her reverie ah youve stumbled upon the memories of the past he said his

clung to the walls like the tendrils of a ghostly vine one evening as the full moon cast an ethereal glow through the windows the innkeeper invited sarah to a grand ballroom that lay at the heart of the inn crystal chandeliers hung from the ceiling their prismatic light scattering rainbows across the polished floor the room seemed frozen in time a relic of opulence and elegance you are about to witness something special the innkeeper said his voice hushed with anticipation as if on cue a haunting melody began to fill the air it was the same melody that sarah had heard on her first nightthe melody that seemed to carry the weight of forgotten stories the music seemed to emanate from an ornate grand piano positioned at the center of the ballroom its keys played by invisible fingers sarah
