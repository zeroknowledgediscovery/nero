seemed to beckon her deeper into the mansions depths it was then that she stumbled upon a hidden chamber concealed behind a tapestry adorned with an intricate pattern cassandras heart quickened as she brushed the fabric aside and stepped into the dimly lit room the chamber was filled with ancient tomes and dusty scrolls their spines marked with cryptic symbols and runes it was a treasure trove of forgotten knowledge a repository of the blackwood familys arcane wisdom as she perused the texts cassandras eyes fell upon a particularly old and ornate book its pages were brittle with age and its leather cover was embossed with a serpent devouring its own tailan ouroboros it was a symbol of eternity and rebirth but in this context it felt more ominous the books title read the chronicles of blackwood a record of secrets cassandra gingerly opened its pages revealing handwritten accounts of the familys experiments rituals and encounters with supernatural entities she read about lady

artifacts dusty relics and rows upon rows of books and scrolls the air was thick with the scent of aged parchment cassandras eyes were drawn to an ornate pedestal in the center of the room upon it
